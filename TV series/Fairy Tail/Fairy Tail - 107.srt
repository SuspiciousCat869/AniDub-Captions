1
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,208
- LORD ZEREF.

2
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,791
AT LAST, I HAVE YOU
ALL TO MYSELF.

3
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,166
MY FREEDOM.

4
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,250
AND NO ONE CAN
TAKE YOU AWAY FROM ME.

5
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:40,333
I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU
THE RULER OF THIS WORLD.

6
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,833
AND THEN YOU WILL
BRING ABOUT MY SALVATION.

7
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,583
- ( theme music plays )

8
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:10,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

9
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,125
- ( explosion )

10
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,041
- ( panting )

11
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,500
- ( growls )

12
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,583
- I DON'T THINK
HE'S GONNA LET US GO.

13
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,750
IF HE CATCHES US,
WE'RE THROUGH.

14
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,958
- ( Elfman groans )
- DON'T STOP.

15
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,666
ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL US?

16
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,666
END OF THE LINE, HUH?

17
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,791
- OH, LOOK AT THAT VIEW.

18
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,416
- I'M SO SWITCHING SIDES.

19
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:52,500
- Happy:
"ARC OF EMBODIMENT"!

20
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,083
- I'VE HAD IT
UP TO HERE WITH YOU!

21
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,416
WHAT KIND OF LAMEBRAINED BUFFOON
RUNS FOR HIS LIFE

22
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,750
WITHOUT EVEN BOTHERING ONCE 
TO LOOK WHERE HE'S RUNNING?!

23
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,208
- YOU LOVE COMPLAINING,
DON'T YOU?

24
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,666
IF THAT'S HOW
YOU WANT TO BE,

25
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,291
YOU CAN GO THE REST
OF THE WAY ON YOUR OWN.

26
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,291
- SO NOT ONLY
ARE YOU AN IDIOT,

27
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,458
YOU'D ALSO LEAVE
A CRIPPLED COMRADE

28
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:07,791
TO FEND FOR HERSELF?!

29
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,291
- YOU LOOK HEALTHY
AS A HORSE TO ME! 

30
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,166
- NOT GOOD.

31
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,375
HE'S GOT US CORNERED.

32
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,583
AND IF HE GOES BERSERK 
THIS CLOSE TO THE EDGE,

33
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,625
WE'LL BE MAKING CRATERS
IN NO TIME.

34
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,083
I'M SO LOW ON MAGIC POWER,

35
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,708
I'M NOT EVEN SURE
I COULD FLY.

36
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,875
- I CAN'T BELIEVE I DIDN'T
THINK OF THAT BEFORE.

37
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,500
- YOU? THINKING?
NOT A CHANCE.

38
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,750
- THOSE SMARTY-PANTS SPECS
REALLY COME IN HANDY.

39
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,583
I SHOULD GET A PAIR.
- THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO

40
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:36,875
WITH MY INTELLIGENCE.

41
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,333
I'M SMART WITH
OR WITHOUT THEM.

42
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,458
OR DID YOU FORGET
THAT YOU'RE TALKING

43
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,041
TO ONE OF THE GREATEST FAIRIES--

44
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,041
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT.

45
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,083
- ( screams )

46
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,125
- Elfman:
EYES FORWARD, FREAK SHOW.

47
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,125
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR ME?
- ( growls )

48
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,791
- I'M READY TO THROW DOWN
IF YOU ARE, UGLY.

49
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,333
AND I WON'T HOLD BACK
SO GIVE ME YOUR BEST SHOT.

50
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,458
TAKE OVER BEAST SOUL!

51
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,166
HE FELL FOR IT.

52
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,500
- ( growls )

53
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,125
- Evergreen: ALL RIGHT, YOU.

54
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,166
- YO.

55
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,416
GOOD WORK.

56
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,125
WE TOTALLY FOOLED--
( grunts )

57
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,958
- NEXT TIME YOU COME UP
WITH A PLAN,

58
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,875
LEAVE ME OUT OF IT.
I AM NOT BAIT!

59
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,916
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?!
- SLIPPING! I'M SLIPPING!

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,125
- A HEATED DISCUSSION FOLLOWED
BY INTENSE PHYSICAL CONTACT?

61
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,416
TODAY'S LOVERS HAVE
NO SENSE OF SHAME, DO THEY?

62
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,208
- Both: SHUT UP!
- ( gasps )

63
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,625
- I'M IMPRESSED.

64
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,250
MANY HAVE MET THEIR END
BY MY BEAST.

65
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,625
SURVIVING THE THUNDER CLAP

66
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,416
IS A FEAT WORTHY
OF HEROIC SONG. 

67
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,375
IT WAS A TRULY SHOCKING
TURN OF EVENTS TO SAY THE LEAST,

68
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,083
FINDING VICTORY AFTER
SUCH A PITIFUL DISPLAY.

69
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,458
AND I DO MEAN PITIFUL.

70
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,041
WHERE WAS YOUR GRACEFULNESS?

71
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,583
MY POET'S SOUL
WEPT IN DISGUST.

72
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:57,125
WIZARDS LIKE YOU
ARE THE SOURCE OF MY IRE.

73
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,208
SCUM LIKE YOU CANNOT
BE PERMITTED.

74
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,166
THE GRAND MAGIC WORLD
WILL SNUFF YOU OUT.

75
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,583
AND THEN JUST LIKE THAT,
WE'LL BE FOREVER FREE.

76
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:07,125
- YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
A COWARD'S FREEDOM.

77
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,708
A REAL MAN DOESN'T NEED
TO DESTROY THE WORLD

78
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,583
JUST TO FEEL COMFORTABLE
LIVING IN IT.

79
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,541
- ( gasps )
- DON'T YOU GET IT?

80
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,791
MOST PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD
DON'T HAVE MAGIC POWER.

81
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,875
YOU'D PUT THEM THROUGH HELL
AND WIPE THEM OUT

82
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,625
JUST FOR YOUR "FREEDOM."

83
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:25,291
- THAT'S RIGHT. IF THE GRAND
MAGIC WORLD IS TO BE BORN,

84
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,666
THEY CANNOT BE
ALLOWED TO LIVE.

85
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,041
- I'M NOT GONNA
LET YOU DO THAT, BUB.

86
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,291
- YOU HONESTLY THINK
THEY'RE NECESSARY?

87
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,375
TELL ME WHAT GREAT PURPOSE
DO THEY SERVE?

88
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,708
PEOPLE WHO CAN'T USE MAGIC

89
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,541
ARE LIKE CANDLES
THAT CAN'T BE LIT.

90
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,416
THEY SHOULD BE DISCARDED.
- HAVING MAGIC POWER

91
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,708
DOESN'T MEAN YOUR MORE VALUABLE
THAN SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T.

92
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,916
ALL LIFE HAS MEANING!
( groans )

93
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,291
- OH NO, HE'S INJURED.

94
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:49,250
BELCUSAS MUST HAVE DONE MORE 
DAMAGE TO HIM THAN I THOUGHT.

95
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,541
- WHY DO YOU CARE?

96
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,333
AFRAID TO LOSE 
YOUR CASH CROP?

97
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,750
THAT'S A FINE EXAMPLE
OF HYPOCRISY.

98
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,291
YOU CALL ME A COWARD,
BUT IN THE END,

99
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,041
YOU'RE AFRAID OF BEING
LEFT WITH NOTHING.

100
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,250
HOW PATHETIC.

101
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,166
- YOU'RE WRONG.

102
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,875
WE WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE 
LIFE EASIER FOR EVERYONE.

103
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,208
IN EXCHANGE FOR OUR SERVICES,

104
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,291
THEY GIVE US COMPENSATION.

105
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,791
THAT RELATIONSHIP
AND TRUST

106
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,583
BUILT THE WORLD
WE LIVE IN.

107
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,583
IT GAVE BIRTH 
TO THE GUILDS.

108
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,833
I WON'T LET YOU MOCK
WHAT WE'VE MADE TOGETHER.

109
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,750
THIS WORLD BELONGS
TO EVERYONE!

110
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,000
AND I'LL BE DAMNED
IF I'M GONNA

111
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,041
LET YOU TEAR IT DOWN!

112
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,875
- HOW SAD.

113
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,125
YOU DON'T EVEN REALIZE
YOU'VE ALREADY LOST THE WAR.

114
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,791
YOU'VE STRAYED TOO FAR
FROM THE ABYSS OF SORCERY,

115
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,708
THE INFINITE VOID
FROM WHICH TRUE POWER FLOWS

116
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,541
INEXORABLY AND ETERNALLY.

117
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,583
ZEREF'S POWER ELUDES 
YOUR FEEBLE MIND NOW,

118
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,208
BUT YOU WILL LEARN
THAT LESSON SOON, 

119
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,916
AS WILL ALL WIZARDS.

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,458
AND THE ONLY OPTIONS LEFT
WILL BE SERVITUDE OR THE GRAVE.

121
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,916
- IF THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK,

122
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,375
YOU'VE GOT A WORLD
OF DISAPPOINTMENT AHEAD!

123
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,958
IF FAIRY TAIL'S
HEADING FOR THE GRAVE,

124
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,333
WE'RE TAKING
GRIMOIRE HEART WITH US!

125
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,000
STARTING WITH YOU!

126
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,875
- MY, WHAT AN ELEGANT LANGUAGE.

127
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,750
BUT AT LEAST YOU'VE MADE
YOUR POSITION CLEAR.

128
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,041
- ( groans )

129
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,000
- VERY WELL.

130
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,041
IF YOU WISH
TO ACT LIKE GARBAGE,

131
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,708
THEN YOU SHALL BE
DISPOSED OF ACCORDINGLY.

132
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,083
- LEAVE HIM ALONE!

133
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,250
- YOU CAN CALL ME GARBAGE
IF YOU WANT,

134
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,916
BUT YOU SURE AS HELL
WON'T GET AWAY

135
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,458
WITH TRASH-TALKING
MY FRIENDS!

136
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:20,250
AS A REAL MAN,
I WON'T LET YOU!

137
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,375
- OH, IS THAT SO?

138
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:27,666
- NO, ELFMAN!

139
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,375
HMM.
( gasps )

140
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,833
- ( chuckles )

141
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,416
I GOT YOU NOW.

142
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,208
TO OVERCOME AN OPPONENT,

143
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,458
YOU GOT TO LEARN 'EM 
INSIDE AND OUT FIRST.

144
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:42,166
AIN'T THAT RIGHT, BIG SIS?

145
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,041
( groans )

146
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,541
THANKS, PAL.
I NEEDED AN ARM.

147
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,791
- HOW DARE YOU TAINT MY WEAPON
WITH YOUR STENCH.

148
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,708
- YOU READY TO DIE?

149
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,500
- IN MY LEFT HAND APPEARS
A KITE SHIELD

150
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,375
THROUGH WHICH NO ATTACK
SHALL EVER PASS.

151
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,541
YOUR CHEAP TACTIC
HAS FAILED.

152
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:05,750
NOW WHAT WILL YOU DO?

153
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,000
- ( chuckles )

154
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,500
WHAT'S WRONG, PRETTY BOY.

155
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,458
DON'T FEEL SECURE
WITHOUT YOUR SPECS ON?

156
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,791
DO IT, EVER!

157
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,458
- I DON'T LET MANY PEOPLE 
CALL BE BY THAT NICKNAME, 

158
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:18,083
SAVE LAXUS AND THE MEMBERS
OF THE THUNDER LEGION,

159
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,125
BUT I'M IN A GOOD MOOD.

160
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,333
SO I GUESS I CAN
MAKE AN EXCEPTION THIS ONCE.

161
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,833
- ( gasps )
- TURNING THIS DRAMA-CLUB REJECT

162
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,750
INTO A PIGEON PERCH WILL BE
THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY DAY.

163
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,166
NO ONE TRASH-TALKS
FAIRY TAIL AND LIVES.

164
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,208
- NO!
- STONE EYE!

165
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,458
- OH, NO!

166
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,500
( screams )

167
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,500
DRAMA-CLUB REJECT, YOU SAY?

168
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,500
AHEM.

169
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,500
- ( gasps )

170
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,916
- ( gasps )

171
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,250
AHH!

172
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,375
- ELFMAN!

173
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,375
UGH!

174
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:54,291
WHY DIDN'T
MY STONE-EYE SPELL WORK?

175
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,916
- UHH, EVER!

176
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,291
- ( footsteps approach )
- HUH?

177
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,750
- SUCH A SHAME.

178
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,375
I HAD HOPED
YOUR LOVER'S BOND

179
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,500
WOULD SOMEHOW MOVE ME.

180
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,083
ALAS, IT SEEMS 
NOT EVEN A LOVE

181
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,375
BORN ON THE BATTLEFIELD

182
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,166
CAN MAKE
MY POET'S SOUL QUIVER.

183
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,708
THAT'S NOT TO SAY
THE SHOW WASN'T ENJOYABLE.

184
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,583
- YOUR GLASSES!

185
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,500
I CRUSHED THEM
WITH MY OWN HANDS.

186
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,000
- MY MAGIC IS THAT
OF IMAGINATION,

187
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:20,458
THE ARC OF EMBODIMENT.

188
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,833
IF I CAN ENVISION IT,

189
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,875
I CAN GIVE IT SHAPE
AND MAKE IT A REALITY.

190
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,666
- WHAT? BUT HOW?

191
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,041
THERE'S NO SUCH POWER.

192
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,458
- THE EMBODIMENT OF WISHES

193
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,416
IS LINKED TO
THE ROOT OF SORCERY.

194
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,833
WHILE IT HAS
ITS LIMITATIONS,

195
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,458
I'D SAY THEY ARE
A SMALL PRICE TO PAY

196
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,041
FOR I POSSESS MAGIC
THAT IS UNMATCHED IN POWER.

197
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,625
AND TO THIS DAY,

198
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,416
IT HAS NEVER BEEN VANQUISHED
BY ANOTHER WIZARD.

199
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,041
- ( growls )

200
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:49,791
- COME FORTH,
MY DARK TOWER OF DINGIR!

201
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,500
- ( rumbling ) 
- ( screaming )

202
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,916
- TURN ALL YOUR SORROW
ONTO THE FOOLISH FAIRIES

203
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,666
AND RETURN THEM TO THE REFUSE
FROM WHENCE THEY CAME.

204
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,041
- WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS THING?

205
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,791
I CAN'T MOVE.

206
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:07,250
- ( voice breaks )
ELFMAN, I--

207
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,916
- EVER, YOU GOT
TO HANG IN THERE.

208
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,708
- I'M SORRY.
- WHAT?

209
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:18,125
- IF ONLY I HADN'T BEEN
YOUR PARTNER,

210
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,625
YOU MIGHT HAVE BECOME
AN S-CLASS WIZARD.

211
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,791
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE LOST

212
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,208
OR BEEN HELD BACK
BY A WEAKLING LIKE ME.

213
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,958
- YOU IDIOT.

214
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:35,833
I MADE IT THIS FAR BECAUSE
YOU WERE BY MY SIDE.

215
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,291
- ( sobs )

216
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,583
ELFMAN.

217
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,958
- I'M GLAD
YOU'RE HERE, EVER.

218
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,791
- NOW WANE TO
THE ENDS OF DARKNESS.

219
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,541
- ( rumbling )

220
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,416
- ( no audio )

221
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,125
- ( groans )

222
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,958
- NATSU!
- YOU'RE ALIVE!

223
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,583
( giggles )
- WHERE'S GRAMPS?

224
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,875
- RIGHT HERE.
- BUT I AM AFRAID

225
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,583
HE ISN'T OUT
OF THE WOODS YET.

226
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,458
- ( growls )

227
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:30,541
HUH?

228
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,125
MY SCARF'S FIXED.

229
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,583
- WENDY USED HER SKY MAGIC
TO GET THE BAD GUNK OUT.

230
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,208
SHE ALSO FLIPPED 
YOUR CLOTHES BACK

231
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,500
WHILE YOU WERE CATNAPPING.

232
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,375
- I OWE YOU ONE.  THANKS.

233
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,458
- NO PROB.

234
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,208
- HMM?

235
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:44,916
- IS SOMETHING WRONG, NATSU?

236
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,916
- HMM.

237
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,291
( sniffs )
- UM, HELLO?

238
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,750
- GET YOUR SLIMY NOSTRILS
AWAY FROM HER,

239
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:52,875
YOU FIRE-BREATHING PERVERT!

240
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,375
- AH!
- I KNOW THIS SMELL.

241
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,625
- WHAT SMELL?
PLEASE TELL ME IT'S FISH.

242
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,625
- IT HAS TO BE HIM.

243
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,375
BUT WHY WOULD HE 
BE ON THE ISLAND?

244
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,083
- WHO IS HE TALKING ABOUT?

245
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,291
- WENDY, CAN YOU
SMELL IT TOO?

246
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,541
- UH, NOT REALLY.  SORRY.

247
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,208
THERE'RE SO MANY
NEW SCENTS OUT HERE

248
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,583
I'M HAVING TROUBLE
FIGURING OUT WHO'S WHO.

249
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,458
- NATSU, WHO'D YOU
CATCH A WHIFF OF? 

250
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,083
JELLAL?

251
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,500
- NO, IT'S THE GUY WE MET
ON GALUNA ISLAND.

252
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:19,208
- Narrator: YOU MAY REMEMBER
THIS SHORT-STATURED MAN

253
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,000
WITH AN AFFINITY FOR MASKS.

254
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,458
HE WENT BY THE NAME ZALTI

255
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,625
DURING THE GALUNA ISLAND
INCIDENT

256
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:27,291
WHERE HE CONSPIRED TO OBTAIN
THE POWER OF DELIORA,

257
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:30,291
A DESTRUCTIVE DEMON
FROM THE BOOK OF ZEREF.

258
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,500
AFTER BEING
DEFEATED BY NATSU,

259
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,416
HE WAS NEVER SEEN AGAIN.

260
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:40,875
- ( gasps )

261
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,416
HE'S CLOSE.

262
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,041
- Happy: NATSU, WAIT!

263
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,375
- Wendy: DON'T JUST RUN OFF!

264
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,958
- WELL, THERE'S NO POINT
IN TRYING TO STOP HIM.

265
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,666
- WHAT HAPPENED
ON GALUNA ISLAND?

266
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,625
WHO'S HE TALKING ABOUT?

267
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,625
- OH, YOU KNOW THE ROUTINE.
STUFF HAPPENED AND THEN

268
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,291
HE HAD AN ALL-OUT
MAGIC BRAWL WITH THE GUY.

269
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,125
- DO YOU THINK
HE WANTS REVENGE?

270
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,833
- I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT
ALL THIS LOST MAGIC BUSINESS.

271
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,541
- I MUST ADMIT I'M ENVIOUS
OF NATSU'S POWERFUL SNOUT.

272
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,416
HE'S JUST LIKE AN ANIMAL.

273
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,791
- Carla: WELL, IT IS NATSU.

274
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,166
- Pantherlily:
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT, HUH?

275
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,375
- Happy: PRETTY MUCH.

276
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,291
- ( heavy breathing )

277
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,250
( muffled ) THIS IS
A STICKY SITUATION.

278
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:29,625
I CAN'T FIND LORD ZEREF,
MY TEAMMATES ARE GONE,

279
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,708
AND MY APPETITE
IS OUT OF CONTROL.

280
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,708
I NOW THAT I'M EATING,

281
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:37,416
MY SWEET TOOTH IS BEGGING
FOR A SUGARY TREAT TIDE IT OVER.

282
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,166
LUCKILY I PREPARED
FOR THIS VERY THING.

283
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,750
THIS'LL BE GLORIOUS.

284
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,458
I'VE BEEN WAITING ALL DAY
JUST TO TASTE YOU.

285
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,916
COME TO PAPA,
ICE CREAM CONE.

286
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,666
NO!

287
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,458
- Lahar: LOOK ALIVE, PEOPLE.

288
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,833
GET THE WOUNDED TO THE TENTS
ALONG THE REEF AT ONCE.

289
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,750
WE MUST HEAL THEM QUICKLY.

290
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,125
WE'LL WORRY ABOUT REPAIRS
ONCE WE'VE SECURED THE ISLAND.

291
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,875
- Narrator:
REMEMBER THIS MAN

292
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,833
FROM THE ORACION SEIS
INCIDENT?

293
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,958
HE IS LAHAR,
CAPTAIN OF THE MAGIC COUNCIL'S

294
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,750
FOURTH CUSTODY
ENFORCEMENT UNIT.

295
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,625
A SERIOUS BUNCH
TO SAY THE LEAST.

296
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,166
AFTER NIRVANA HAD
BEEN DEALT WITH, 

297
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,541
LAHAR WAS RESPONSIBLE
FOR ARRESTING

298
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,375
THE REVIVED FUGITIVE JELLAL.

299
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,125
AND NOW HE'S IN COMMAND
OF THE COUNCIL'S BATTLE FLEET,

300
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,666
MONITORING THE SITUATION
ON TENROU ISLAND.

301
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,000
- WE'RE GOING TO LAUNCH
A FULL ASSAULT ON THE ISLAND.

302
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,583
IF YOU CAN HOLD A WEAPON--
- ( gasps )

303
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,666
- DORANBOLT!

304
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,666
- Narrator:
IT WAS RECENTLY REVEALED

305
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,166
THAT THIS MAN,
LIKE LAHAR, ALSO WORKS

306
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,583
FOR NEW MAGIC COUNCIL.

307
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,250
THOUGH HE WENT
BY THE NAME MEST

308
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,166
WHEN APPEARING TO
THE MEMBERS OF FAIRY TAIL,

309
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,958
HIS ACTUAL NAME
IS DORANBOLT.

310
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:44,208
HE IS A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL'S
INTELLIGENCE OFFICE

311
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,583
AND IS QUITE AMBITIOUS.

312
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,541
- WHAT HAPPENED?
YOU LOOK LIKE

313
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:48,916
YOU'VE BEEN PUT THROUGH
A MEAT GRINDER.

314
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,541
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

315
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,208
HOW'RE THE CREW MEMBERS?
- THEY'RE ALL FINE.

316
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,958
WE HAD A FEW INJURIES,
BUT THANKFULLY

317
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,708
NO SIGNIFICANT CASUALTIES.

318
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,541
- WHAT ABOUT
THE COMMUNICATION LACRIMA?

319
00:14:58,625 --> 00:14:59,958
- IT STILL WORKS.

320
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,625
NOW CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED OUT THERE?

321
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,666
- I WAS MAKING PROGRESS.

322
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,375
NEXT THING I KNOW--
A THREE-WAY WAR

323
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,541
BETWEEN FAIRY TAIL,
GRIMOIRE HEART, AND ZEREF

324
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,541
EXPLODES IN MY FACE.

325
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:13,541
THE ATTACK ON THE SHIPS
WAS GRIMOIRE HEART'S DIRTY WORK.

326
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,416
WHERE IS
THE COMMUNICATION LACRIMA?

327
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,833
THE COUNCIL NEEDS TO KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

328
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,416
- THIS CAN'T BE COINCIDENCE!

329
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,583
THE BIGGEST THORNS
IN OUR SIDE

330
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,750
SOMEHOW WIND UP GATHERED
AT THE SAME PLACE.

331
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:27,875
IF I WERE A GAMBLING MAN,
I'D SAY THIS GAME WAS RIGGED.

332
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,625
THE CHAIRMAN WON'T HESITATE.

333
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,291
YOU KNOW HOW HE IS:

334
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,916
AS RIGID AS STEEL AND SWIFT
TO CARRY OUT JUDGMENT.

335
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,500
WITH AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THIS
IN FRONT OF HIM,

336
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,458
HE MAY JUST DECIDE
TO WIPE THEM OUT. 

337
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,916
- AN ETHERION BLAST?!

338
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
- IF THE CHAIRMAN DOES
RESORT TO THAT,

339
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,250
WE HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO OBEY.

340
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,625
- OUT OF THE QUESTION!

341
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:47,916
I KNOW THAT
THE COUNCIL'S HAD IT IN

342
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,833
FOR FAIRY TAIL
FOR A LONG TIME NOW,

343
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,333
BUT THEY DON'T DESERVE
THE SAME FATE

344
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,791
AS ZEREF OR GRIMOIRE HEART.

345
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,791
- IF I'M ORDERED
TO EXECUTE THEM,

346
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:57,958
THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.

347
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,166
- ( gasps )

348
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,416
- ( no audio )

349
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:08,208
- NOW WILL YOU TELL
H.Q. OR SHALL I?

350
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,375
- WHAT YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT IS GENOCIDE.

351
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:32,541
- ONLY 10% OF THE POPULATION
WILL BE ALLOWED TO LIVE?

352
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,458
- YOU HONESTLY THINK
THAT WILL WORK?

353
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,333
PEOPLE WILL
FIGHT TO THE END

354
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,583
TILL THERE'S NO WORLD LEFT.

355
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,250
- PERHAPS.

356
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,916
THEN AGAIN, HADES
HAS YET TO REVEAL

357
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
THE FULL EXTENT OF HIS PLAN.

358
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,083
HE DREAMS OF A HEAVEN
FOR THOSE ATTUNED

359
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,583
WITH THE ABYSS OF SORCERY.

360
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,125
THE BLACK WIZARD
WILL BE OURS.

361
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,750
AND ONCE HE IS, THE WORLD
YOU KNOW WILL VANISH.

362
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,916
ONCE ALL THE FIRE
AND DUST HAVE SETTLED,

363
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,166
IT WILL BE REBORN.

364
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,458
- YOU TALK TOO MUCH.

365
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,583
ALL I CARE ABOUT
IS MAKING YOU PAY DEARLY

366
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,291
FOR COMING INTO OUR HOUSE
AND ACTING LIKE

367
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,916
YOU OWN THE PLACE. 
- MY COMRADES AND I

368
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,500
HAVE TWO MISSIONS.

369
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:06,916
THE FIRST
IS TO SEIZE ZEREF

370
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,500
AND THEN DELIVER HIM SAFELY
TO MASTER HADES.

371
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,000
AND THE SECOND ONE IS

372
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,000
TO WIPE FAIRY TAIL
FROM EXISTENCE.

373
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,583
- YOU THINK YOU CAN
WIPE US OUT?

374
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,208
LET'S PUT THAT THEORY
TO THE TEST.

375
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,833
- WAIT.
- HUH?

376
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,666
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- COVERING YOUR RETREAT.

377
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,125
SINCE HE'S JUST ONE
OF THE SEVEN KIN,

378
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,250
IT'S SAFE TO SAY
THERE'S A SIX PACK OF NASTY

379
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,291
SOMEWHERE OUT THERE.

380
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,250
I'LL HOLD HIM OFF

381
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,250
WHILE YOU HUNT DOWN
THE REST OF HIS CREW.

382
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,833
- DO YOU GOT A SCREW LOOSE?

383
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,833
THE FOUR OF US COMBINED
COULDN'T TAKE HIM DOWN

384
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,916
AND YOU WANT TO GO
SOLO ON HIM?

385
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,208
- THAT'S BECAUSE HIS MAGIC
WAS SAPPING YOUR STRENGTH.

386
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,333
HUMAN ENSLAVEMENT MAGIC,

387
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,333
IT'S ANCIENT
AND POWERFUL STUFF.

388
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,833
- HUMAN ENSLAVEMENT?

389
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,708
- Loke: IT'S ALSO
KNOWN AS RULER'S MAGIC.

390
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,125
IT TEMPORARILY REDUCES
THE COMBAT ABILITIES

391
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,291
AND MAGIC POWER
OF ANY HUMAN IT AFFECTS.

392
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,916
CELESTIAL SPIRITS
ARE IMMUNE TO IT,

393
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,833
SO WE CAN FIGHT EVENLY.

394
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,000
YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY
FIGURED THIS OUT,

395
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:03,000
BUT HE'S ALSO
CELESTIAL SPIRIT.

396
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,000
CAPRICORN, THE SEA GOAT.

397
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,208
- THAT'S CRAZY.
- SERIOUSLY?

398
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,250
- THIS IS BAD.

399
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,791
CELESTIAL SPIRITS
FIGHTING EACH OTHER?

400
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,000
I CAN'T LET THAT
HAPPEN AGAIN.

401
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,708
WE'LL STAY HERE AND HELP.
- I DON'T THINK SO.

402
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,000
HOW ABOUT IT, SEA GOAT,

403
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,875
FEEL LIKE GOING TOE-TO-TOE
WITH A SUPERIOR FIGHTER?

404
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,250
LET'S DO THIS.
- I ACCEPT YOUR CHALLENGE.

405
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,208
TO BE HONEST, LEO,
I WAS BEGINNING TO WONDER

406
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,291
WHETHER YOU
REMEMBERED THAT

407
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,583
YOU WERE
A CELESTIAL SPIRIT.

408
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,750
- GET OUT OF HERE.
I CAN HANDLE IT.

409
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,375
- WE CAN'T.

410
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,625
- I HATE TO ADMIT IT,
LUCY, BUT HE'S RIGHT.

411
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,166
- WE'RE JUST A BURDEN
WITHOUT OUR FULL MAGIC POWER.

412
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,875
LOKE KNOWS WHAT
HE'S GOT TO DO NOW.

413
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,250
SO LET'S MAKE SURE
THAT HE CAN.

414
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,333
- LOKE!

415
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,166
- DON'T WORRY, BEAUTIFUL.

416
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,000
I GOT THIS FIGHT
IN THE BAG.

417
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,541
JUST FOCUS ON FINDING THE OTHERS
AND STOPPING THEM.

418
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,333
- YOU CAN'T EXPECT ME
TO LEAVE YOU HERE

419
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,500
TO FIGHT ONE
OF YOUR OWN KIND.

420
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,125
- GET OUT OF HERE NOW!

421
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,000
- I GET THE FEELING
THERE'S MORE TO THIS FIGHT

422
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,500
THAN LOKE'S
WILLING TO TELL US.

423
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,250
- THERE'S DEFINITELY
SOME BAD BLOOD

424
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,416
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM
TIME FOR US TO GO.

425
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,708
SO COME ON.
YOU HAVE FAITH IN HIM, RIGHT?

426
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,875
ALL RIGHT THEN, 
WE GOT TO HURRY.

427
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,041
I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE OTHERS.
- ( sighs )

428
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,708
- Lucy: LOKE!

429
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,833
WIN THIS.
PLEASE PROMISE

430
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,416
YOU'LL COME BACK
SAFE AND SOUND. 

431
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,541
PROMISE ME!

432
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,500
- Gray: LUCY!

433
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,500
- ( gasps )
I KNOW THAT FACE.

434
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,458
- YOU'VE GOT BIGGER THINGS
TO WORRY ABOUT AT THE MOMENT.

435
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,291
( grunts )

436
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,125
JUST HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN

437
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,166
SINCE YOU LEFT
THE CELESTIAL SPIRIT WORLD?

438
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,208
- 17 YEARS.

439
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,125
- THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'VE MANAGED

440
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,083
TO LAST THAT LONG 
ON YOUR OWN POWER.

441
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,041
TELL ME WHO ARE YOU
CONTRACTED TO?!

442
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,625
- NO HUMAN CONTROLS ME,

443
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:07,166
BUT I HAVE PLENTY
OF SERVANTS OF MY OWN.

444
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,625
COME FORTH,
MIGHTY HERO OF RUBENGALD.

445
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,000
- ( gasps )

446
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,750
AN OTHERWORLDLY GATE?

447
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,083
- SAN ZHAO XIN.
- ( gasps )

448
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,166
HE'S NOT
A CELESTIAL SPIRIT.

449
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,375
WHAT'S GOING ON?

450
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,458
- Caprico:
GENERAL SAN ZHAO XIN

451
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,791
LED THE ANTI-GOVERNMENT FORCES
TO VICTORY

452
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,666
DURING THE RUBENGALD CIVIL WAR

453
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,458
IN THE YEAR 779.

454
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,375
HE WENT MISSING
SHORTLY AFTER, 

455
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,250
BUT THE TRUTH
OF THE MATTER

456
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,083
IS HE BECAME MY SLAVE.

457
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,833
HE LIVES AND DIES
BY MY WILL.

458
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,958
- YOU'VE GONE OVER THE EDGE.

459
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,166
KEEPING HUMANS AS PUPPETS
IS BARBARIC.

460
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:53,125
- AND BEING A SLAVE TO
YOUR OWNER IS SOMEHOW NOBLE?

461
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,875
- MY OWNER HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

462
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:58,750
- I WONDER.  WHO EXACTLY
IS HOLDING YOUR LEASH?

463
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:02,000
MIGHT IT BE THAT BLONDE GIRL
YOU TOLD TO FLEE.

464
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,458
SHE SEEMED
QUITE FOND OF YOU.

465
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,583
YOU NEVER WANTED TO
CHALLENGE ME TO A DUEL.

466
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,416
DID YOU, LEO?

467
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,250
THIS WAS JUST A WAY
OF GETTING HER TO SAFETY

468
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:14,833
WHILE FOOLING ME--
A CLEVER TACTIC.

469
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:18,250
BEING A PUPPET IS SUCH
A THANKLESS ROLE TO PLAY.

470
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,833
SUCH A BORING EXISTENCE.

471
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,333
- WIN THIS.
PLEASE PROMISE

472
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,916

474
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,666
- Woman: DEAR CAPRICORN.

475
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,916
PLEASE PROMISE YOU'LL
COME BACK SAFE AND SOUND.

476
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,083
PROMISE ME.

477
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,291
- THAT GIRL.

478
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,416
SHE COULDN'T POSSIBLY... NO!

479
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,208
- HE FIGURED IT OUT!

480
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,250
- I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO, LEO!

481
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:46,875
WHY YOU'RE
PROTECTING THAT ONE!

482
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:47,875
I SHOULD'VE SEEN IT BEFORE!

483
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,250
THE RESEMBLANCE IS UNCANNY.

484
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,166
SHE'S THE DAUGHTER
OF LAYLA HEARTFILIA.

485
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,791
- HERE IT GOES.

486
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,541
IT'S TIME TO BUST OUT
THE BIG GUNS!

487
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,250
- WHERE DID YOU SEND HER?!

488
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,625
SHE CAN'T BE ALLOWED TO LIVE!

489
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,208
- HE'S CLOSE.

490
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,250
I CAN SMELL HIM LIKE
HE'S RIGHT NEXT TO ME.

491
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,291
- I GOT A QUESTION
FOR YOU, NATSU.

492
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:10,833
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE
IT'S THE SAME GUY

493
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,916
FROM GALUNA ISLAND 
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

494
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,416
- THERE WAS SOMETHING
UNIQUE ABOUT HIM.

495
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,083
- YEAH, THAT MASK HE WORE
WAS PRETTY GNARLY.

496
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,750
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.
- SO WHEN YOU SAY

497
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:20,416
YOU CAN SMELL HIM
IS IT 'CAUSE OF THE SWEAT

498
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,875
INSIDE HIS MASK?
- NO, THAT'S JUST DISGUSTING!

499
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,250
WOULD YOU QUIT
GOOFING OFF ALREADY?

500
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:25,500
THIS IS SERIOUS.

501
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:28,833
- Narrator: JUST WHO IS ZALTI?

502
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,833
AND WHY HAS HE COME
TO TENROU ISLAND OF ALL PLACES?

503
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:35,208
- ( theme music plays )

504
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,791
- LORD ZEREF,

505
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:40,625
WITH YOU,
I WILL CREATE A NEW FUTURE.

506
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:46,500
- ( singing in Japanese )

507
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:14,500
- Natsu: MAN, ALL THESE SHEEP
ARE MAKING ME SLEEPY.

508
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,333
- Happy: HUH? WHAT ABOUT SHEEP?

509
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:18,083
- Natsu:
I MEAN CELESTIAL SPIRITS.

510
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,375
ISN'T THE SHY, FLUFFY SPIRIT
THAT LUCY HAS A SHEEP?

511
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,375
OR AM I DUMB?
- Happy: YES, ARIES IS A SHEEP.

512
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:24,458
AND, YES, YOU ARE DUMB. - Natsu:
AND THE GUY LOKE'S FIGHTING

513
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:27,750
IS A SHEEP TOO, RIGHT? ARE THEY
TWIN SPIRITS OR SOMETHING?

514
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,125
- Happy: NO, HE'S A GOAT.

515
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:30,208
THEY'RE TOTALLY
DIFFERENT FROM SHEEP.

516
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:34,958
- Natsu: OKAY,
SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

517
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,750
- Happy:
WELL, SHEEP GO, "BAAH."

518
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:39,250
WHILE GOATS YOU USUALLY
SOUND LIKE "BEEH."

519
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:40,500
GOT IT?
- Natsu: RIGHT.

520
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:41,583
AND I'M THE DUMB ONE.
