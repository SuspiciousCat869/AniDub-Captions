1
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,083
- HEY, GUYS!  READY FOR
SOME MORE "FAIRY TAIL"?

2
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:22,125
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING,

3
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:23,833
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE ROOM,

4
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:27,083
AND DON'T SIT TOO CLOSE
TO THE TV.

5
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:30,333
- Erza:
PREVIOUSLY, ON "FAIRY TAIL"...

6
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:33,958
- CONSPIRING?
- NOT EXACTLY.

7
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,458
- Gray: WE FOUND OUT THAT
SIEGRAIN AND JELLAL

8
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:37,875
ARE THE SAME PERSON.

9
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:40,125
AND THE ETHERION WAS FIRED,
RELEASING A HUGE AMOUNT

10
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,791
OF MAGIC ENERGY THAT TRANSFORMED
THE TOWER OF HEAVEN

11
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,666
INTO ITS TRUE FORM.

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,250
- Natsu: AND WHEN SHE WAKES UP
FROM THIS NIGHTMARE,

13
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,250
I WANT HER TO FEEL
LIKE HER OLD SELF AGAIN.

14
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:51,916
TO GET TO HER,
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO THROUGH ME.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,291
- ( theme music playing )

16
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:12,333
- ( singing in Japanese ) 

17
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,500
- Lucy: YOU THINK NATSU AND ERZA
ARE OKAY IN THERE?

18
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,291
- Happy: THEY'RE GONNA BE FINE.
I KNOW IT.

19
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,625
THEY'RE TWO OF FAIRY TAIL'S
STRONGEST WIZARDS.

20
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,250
THEY CAN HANDLE THIS.
- Gray: HE'S RIGHT.

21
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,625
SINCE WE CAN'T HELP 'EM,
WE JUST GOTTA HAVE FAITH

22
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,625
THAT THEY'RE GONNA MAKE IT
OUT OF THIS.

23
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,583
- NOW I'M ALL FIRED UP,

24
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,208
EVEN MORE THAN
I'VE EVER BEEN BEFORE.

25
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,791
- I'M NOT GOING TO
LET YOU GET IN MY WAY.

26
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:52,041
THIS'LL BE THE END OF YOU.
I'VE DREAMED OF THIS DAY,

27
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,791
AND I WON'T LET A FOOL
LIKE YOU SPOIL IT FOR ME.

28
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:58,125
- SORRY, PAL,
BUT I'M A PRETTY TOUGH GUY.

29
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,208
IF YOU THINK YOU CAN TAKE ME
THEN COME AND GET ME.

30
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,666
TOO SLOW, HUH?

31
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,166
I GOT YOU NOW.

32
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,625
( Happy speaking )

33
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,083
- NATSU!

34
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:38,125
- ( screaming )

35
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,500
- HA HA! YOU'RE SO WORRIED ABOUT
WRECKING YOUR PRECIOUS TOWER,

36
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,583
YOU'RE NOT GONNA 
FIGHT ME FULL-ON?

37
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,083
'CAUSE I GET THE FEELING
YOU'RE HOLDING BACK.

38
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,041
AND THAT AIN'T GONNA WORK
AGAINST ME.

39
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,333
- I'D WATCH MY MOUTH
IF I WERE YOU.

40
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:54,708
- FIRE DRAGON BRILLIANT FLAME!

41
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,291
- HE'S AIMING FOR THE TOWER.

42
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,166
- NOW I'M ANGRY.

43
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,916
I DIDN'T SPEND YEARS BUILDING
THIS TOWER JUST

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,583
TO HAVE SOME PUNK
TEAR IT DOWN.

45
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:20,916
I WON'T LET YOU.

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,500
- ( laughs )

47
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:27,125
TOUGH BREAK, PAL, BUT YOU
CAN'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU.

48
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:30,625
I TOLD YOU DESTROYING STUFF
IS ONE OF MY SPECIALTIES.

49
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:34,291
- BE CAREFUL, NATSU.
YOU'RE WEAK.

50
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,083
YOU BARELY HAVE THE STRENGTH
TO STAND.

51
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:39,041
- I'LL MAKE YOU PAY!

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,583
- ( gasps )

53
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,750
- WHOA, SOMETHING WEIRD'S
GOING ON WITH HIS MAGIC.

54
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,666
IT'S MAKING ME FEEL SICK.

55
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,166
- WHY'S MY SHADOW BENDING
TOWARDS THE LIGHT?  THAT SPELL!

56
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,958
IT COULD KILL NATSU.

57
00:04:56,041 --> 00:05:00,291
- AND NOW I'LL PLUNGE YOU
INTO INFINITE DARKNESS,

58
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,875
DRAGON SLAYER.
- Erza: DON'T DO IT.

59
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,458
UNLESS YOU WANT
TO KILL ME, TOO.

60
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:18,708
YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOUR
SACRIFICE TO ZEREF, DO YOU?

61
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,833
- THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM.

62
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,333
THE CEREMONY REQUIRES THE BODY
OF A WIZARD

63
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:26,791
COMPARABLE IN STRENGTH TO ONE
OF THE TEN WIZARD SAINTS.

64
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,833
HOWEVER, I CAN FIND
A SUITABLE REPLACEMENT.

65
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,875
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO FITS THAT BILL.

66
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:35,666
I'LL WORRY ABOUT THAT
AFTER I KILL BOTH OF YOU.

67
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,833
- WATCH OUT!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

68
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,416
- IT'S MY FAULT THAT YOU'RE
INVOLVED IN THIS MESS.

69
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,000
THE LEAST I CAN DO
IS PROTECT YOU.

70
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,458
- GET OUT OF THE WAY!

71
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:50,250
- HEAVENLY BODY MAGIC,
ALTAIRIS!

72
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,625
- Natsu: ERZA!

73
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,458
- ( grunting )

74
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:08,250
- WHOA, WHAT HAPPENED?
- THE TOP OF IT BLEW UP.

75
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,291
- BUT THEY'LL BE OKAY,
WON'T THEY?

76
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:14,125
- ( gasps )
- SHO, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

77
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,250
- I DON'T KNOW.

78
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:19,041
I GOT A BAD FEELING JUST NOW.

79
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,875
- Natsu: IT'S YOU.

80
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,625
- WHY, SIMON?

81
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,000
- ( grunting )

82
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,333
TO SAVE YOU.

83
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,375
- SIMON!

84
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,625
- I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE STILL
CRAWLING AROUND THE TOWER,

85
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,375
YOU DESPICABLE PEST.

86
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,250
- WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?

87
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,166
WHY DIDN'T YOU ESCAPE
WITH THE OTHERS?

88
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,250
TALK TO ME!

89
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,333
- ( ragged breathing )

90
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:03,833
PLEASE DON'T CRY.

91
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,291
IT'S OKAY.

92
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,583
I'M HAPPY

93
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,208
TO GIVE MY...

94
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,125
LIFE FOR YOU.

95
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,625
( coughs )
- SAVE YOUR ENERGY.

96
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,750
DON'T TALK ANYMORE.
JUST TRY TO STAY WITH ME.

97
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,250
- YOU WERE

98
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,250
THE ONLY PERSON

99
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:26,916
WHO MADE ME SMILE.

100
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,000
- DON'T DIE ON ME.

101
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:47,291
SIMON...  SIMON!

102
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,666
- I'VE ALWAYS

103
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,041
LOVED YOU.

104
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,166
- ( whimpering )

105
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,750
( crying )

106
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:23,583
NO!

107
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,458
( crying )

108
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,041
- ( laughing )

109
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,583
WHAT A PERFECTLY
FOOLISH THING TO DO.

110
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,916
HE TRIED TO PLAY
THE VALIANT HERO,

111
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,750
BUT HIS DEATH WON'T
CHANGE A THING.

112
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,875
SIMON GAVE HIS OWN LIFE
TO SAVE YOURS,

113
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,291
BUT HE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN I'M
NOT LETTING EITHER OF YOU

114
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,750
LEAVE THIS TOWER ALIVE.
- SHUT UP!

115
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,916
- ( screams )

116
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,625
( grunting )

117
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,958
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

118
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,083
HE'S EATING THE ETHER-NANO

119
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,458
FROM THE ETHERION BLAST.
- ( gulps )

120
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,500
( roaring )

121
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,916
( gagging )

122
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,333
- HOW COULD YOU BE SO STUPID?

123
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,000
ETHER-NANO IS MADE OUT
OF ALL TYPES OF ELEMENTAL MAGIC.

124
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:34,708
IT'LL POISON YOU.
- ( screaming )

125
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,541
- WHAT AN IDIOT.

126
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,791
DID HE REALLY THINK HE'D BE ABLE
TO POWER UP

127
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,875
BY CONSUMING ELEMENTS
OTHER THAN HIS OWN?

128
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:45,333
IT'LL CERTAINLY MAKE MY JOB
EASIER IF HE KILLS HIMSELF.

129
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,291
- ( screaming )

130
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,458
- NO.

131
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:03,375
- ( snarls )

132
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:07,083
- HIS BODY ABSORBED THE MAGIC
ENERGY FROM THE ETHER-NANO.

133
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,958
- YOU MADE ERZA CRY.

134
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,375
AND I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU
GET AWAY WITH THAT.

135
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,583
- ( screaming )
- I MADE A PROMISE

136
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,875
AND I'M NOT GONNA BREAK IT.

137
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,833
- NATSU, PROMISE YOU'LL
TAKE CARE OF HER.

138
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,583
- HURT HER AGAIN
AND I'LL KILL YOU!

139
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,541
- YOUR THREATS DON'T SCARE ME.

140
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,583
METEOR!
- ( gasps )

141
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,416
( screaming )

142
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,166
- YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO CATCH
ME AT THIS RATE OF SPEED.

143
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,500
I WON'T LOSE.
NOT TO YOU.

144
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:59,000
- UGH!

145
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:02,666
- I'M DESTINED TO CREATE
A LAND OF FREEDOM.

146
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,458
I KNOW BECAUSE
IN MY DARKEST HOUR,

147
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,666
I COULD HEAR LORD ZEREF
CALLING OUT TO ME.

148
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,625
HE TOLD ME HE COULD MAKE
ALL MY DREAMS COME TRUE,

149
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,791
AND I BELIEVE HIM.
THERE'S A REASON

150
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,791
I'M THE ONLY HUMAN
WHO CAN SENSE ZEREF'S PRESENCE.

151
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,208
IT'S BECAUSE
I AM THE CHOSEN ONE.

152
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,833
ONCE HE'S BEEN RESURRECTED,
WE'LL WORK TOGETHER

153
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,208
TO CREATE A LAND
THAT'S TRULY FREE.

154
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,958
- YOU'RE GONNA DO THAT

155
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,416
BY TAKING AWAY THE RIGHTS
OF EVERYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD?

156
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,625
- IF THAT'S WHAT HAS TO BE DONE
IN ORDER TO CHANGE THIS WORLD

157
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:32,333
INTO A BETTER PLACE,
THEN SO BE IT.

158
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,041
I COULDN'T CARE LESS
WHAT HAPPENS

159
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,916
TO FEEBLEMINDED
FOOLS LIKE YOU.

160
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,833
- HE'S CASTING THE ABYSS BREAK.
BUT WHY?

161
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,541
YOU'LL DESTROY THE TOWER
SO MANY DIED TO CREATE.

162
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,500
- THIS TOWER MEANS NOTHING.

163
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,333
YOU SEE, NOW THAT I'VE DONE IT,

164
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,166
I COULD BUILD ANOTHER
IN HALF THE TIME.

165
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,500
LORD ZEREF,
YOUR HOUR IS NEAR.

166
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,625
- YOU'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT
IT MEANS TO BE FREE.

167
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,666
NOT AS LONG AS YOU'RE POSSESSED
BY THAT SPIRIT.

168
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,375
WHY ARE YOU LETTING HIM
MANIPULATE YOU?

169
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,583
YOU CAN DO IT, JELLAL.

170
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,708
FREE YOURSELF!

171
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:35,791
- WHAT IN THE WORLD'S GOING ON?
- WAS THAT ANOTHER EXPLOSION?

172
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,250
- NO WAY.
THAT'S GOTTA BE NATSU.

173
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,125
- YOU'RE RIGHT.  HE MUST BE
UP THERE FIGHTING SOMEONE.

174
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:44,083
- OH, NO.  DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE GONNA BE OKAY?

175
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,875
- I SURE HOPE SO,
BUT IT'S STILL TOO SOON TO TELL,

176
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,291
'CAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S
GOING ON A MAJOR RAMPAGE.

177
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:10,375
- Erza: SO THIS IS THE POWER
THAT WAS HIDDEN WITHIN HIM.

178
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,291
THE TRUE FORM

179
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,083
OF THE DRAGON SLAYER.

180
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,791
HE WAS ABLE
TO DEFEAT JELLAL.

181
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,250
- ( laughs )

182
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,500
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

183
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:53,125
THE NIGHTMARE IS OVER.

184
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:57,000
NOW SHO AND THE OTHERS
CAN FINALLY BE FREE.

185
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,916
NATSU!

186
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,458
I KNEW YOU'D FIND
YOUR INNER STRENGTH.

187
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:18,125
YOU'RE AMAZING.

188
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,000
- ( rumbling )
- ( gasps )

189
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,416
- Millianna: SO PRETTY.
- Wally: THIS IS BAD NEWS.

190
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,250
- Juvia: THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE
AMOUNT OF MAGIC ENERGY

191
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,541
RESONATING FROM THAT LIGHT.
- Gray: THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN.

192
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,458
THE ETHER-NANO INSIDE THE TOWER
MUST BE GETTING OUT OF CONTROL.

193
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,125
- WHAT?  WHAT IS THAT?

194
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,375
- MAGIC ENERGY
FROM THE ETHERION.

195
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,333
- IT'S DANGEROUS FOR THAT MUCH
OF IT TO BE CONTAINED

196
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,833
IN ONE PLACE FOR TOO LONG 'CAUSE
THE ENERGY WILL KEEP BUILDING

197
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,625
TILL IT BECOMES UNSTABLE.

198
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,583
- WITH NOWHERE TO GO,
THE ETHER-NANO WILL KEEP GROWING

199
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,583
TILL IT BURSTS,
CAUSING A TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION.

200
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:54,166
- WHAT? WE'D BETTER START MAKING
TRACKS OR WE'RE DEAD MEAT.

201
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,000
- BUT WHAT ABOUT THE OTHERS
TRAPPED INSIDE?

202
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,541
- AT THIS POINT,
THERE'S NO SENSE IN WORRYING

203
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,458
ABOUT WHO'S GONNA MAKE IT OUT
OF THERE ALIVE AND WHO'S NOT.

204
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,250
'CAUSE IF THAT TOWER EXPLODES,
IT'LL WIPE US ALL OUT.

205
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,000
- GOODBYE.

206
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,708
UGH!

207
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:49,791
THE LACRIMA CAN'T CONTAIN
THIS MUCH MAGIC ENERGY.

208
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,416
IT'S TRANSFORMING.

209
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,458
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW MUCH
DESTRUCTIVE POWER IT HAS.

210
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,833
EVEN IF WE MADE IT
OUTSIDE THE TOWER,

211
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,375
WE'D STILL BE CAUGHT
IN THE EXPLOSION.

212
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,958
NO, IT'S OVER.

213
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,333
WHAT AM I SAYING?
I CAN'T GIVE UP.

214
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:15,916
NATSU,

215
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,666
NOW IT'S MY TURN
TO SAVE YOU.

216
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,625
BUT IF THERE'S NO WAY TO CONTAIN
THE BLAST OR ESCAPE IT,

217
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:26,125
THEN WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?
( gasps )

218
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,791
- THE MAGIC ENERGY HELD
WITHIN THIS LACRIMA

219
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:32,208
MUST NOW BE FUSED
WITH THE BODY OF MY SACRIFICE.

220
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,250
ONCE THAT HAPPENS, YOUR FLESH
WILL BEGIN TO BREAK DOWN

221
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,291
AND RECONSTRUCT ITSELF
INTO ZEREF'S BODY.

222
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,625
- THAT'S IT.

223
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,291
IF I FUSE MY BODY

224
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:45,083
WITH THE MAGIC ENERGY
INSIDE THE LACRIMA,

225
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,708
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO CONTROL IT

226
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,541
AND KEEP IT FROM EXPLODING.

227
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:56,041
IT'S A RISK
I'LL HAVE TO TAKE.

228
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:02,875
OH!  GOOD.

229
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,875
I WAS WORRIED THAT
IT MIGHT REJECT ME.

230
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,041
( grunting )

231
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,041
- ERZA.

232
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,500
- NATSU.

233
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:23,333
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I DON'T GET IT.

234
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:27,041
ARE YOU TRYING TO GO BACK
INSIDE THAT THING?

235
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,833
- I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

236
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,750
IT'S THE ONLY WAY I'LL
EVER BE ABLE TO STOP IT.

237
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,166
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
STOP WHAT?

238
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,333
- ( loud rumbling )
- NOW YOU SEE.

239
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,333
IT'S THE ETHER-NANO.

240
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,500
IF IT CONTINUES TO GAIN POWER,

241
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,041
THE LACRIMA WON'T BE ABLE
TO CONTAIN IT

242
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,625
AND THE WHOLE PLACE
WILL EXPLODE.

243
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,208
BUT IF I FUSE MY BODY
WITH THE MAGIC ENERGY,

244
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,666
I CAN PREVENT THAT
FROM HAPPENING.

245
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,833
- I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU DO THAT.

246
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,583
THERE'S GOTTA BE ANOTHER WAY
TO STOP IT.

247
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,708
- ( screaming )
- ERZA!

248
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,000
- I PROMISE I'LL STOP IT.
THERE'S NO NEED TO WORRY.

249
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,250
I'M DETERMINED
TO SAVE ALL OF YOU.

250
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,333
- NO!
- ( screaming )

251
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,500
- DON'T DO IT.

252
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,458
- I HAVE TO.

253
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,208
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE WHAT
MY LIFE WOULD'VE BEEN LIKE

254
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,625
WITHOUT FAIRY TAIL.

255
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,708
IF IT WEREN'T
FOR YOU AND THE OTHERS,

256
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,375
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T
BE HERE TODAY.

257
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:33,833
I HOPE YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT
YOU ALL ARE TO ME.

258
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,333
I CARE FOR YOU SO MUCH.

259
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,125
- ERZA.

260
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,041
- THAT'S WHY I'M WILLING TO MAKE
THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE.

261
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,416
IF IT MEANS MY LOVED ONES
WILL BE SPARED,

262
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,583
I'LL GLADLY GIVE MY LIFE--
( shudders )

263
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:58,000
SO THAT YOU MAY LIVE.

264
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,625
- NO WAY!
COME OUT OF THERE RIGHT NOW.

265
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:09,291
- NATSU, PLEASE WATCH OVER
EVERYONE FOR ME.

266
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,958
- YOU CAN'T LEAVE US.  NO!
- I PROMISE YOU,

267
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:16,250
I'LL ALWAYS BE THERE
BY YOUR SIDE.

268
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,416
- ERZA!

269
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,458
- Wally: OH, CRAP!
IT'S EXPLODING.

270
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:34,833
- NO, IT'S NOT.
TAKE A CLOSER LOOK.

271
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,625
THE MAGIC ENERGY'S SHOOTING
UPWARDS OUT OF THE TOWER,

272
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,500
INTO THE SKY.
- ( gasps )

273
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:49,041
- ( all screaming )

274
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,666
- WHERE'D THE TOWER GO?

275
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,958
- IT WAS JUST THERE
A SECOND AGO.

276
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,958
- NATSU, WHERE ARE YOU?

277
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:17,083
- I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT HER EYE
WAS SO BADLY INJURED.

278
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,875
IT'LL BE NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
FOR ME

279
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,458
TO COMPLETELY RESTORE
HER SIGHT AGAIN.

280
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,125
- AWW, COME ON,
DON'T BE SO NEGATIVE.

281
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,625
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.  IT'S JUST
A SHAME SHE HAS TO WEAR

282
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:29,208
THAT UGLY EYE PATCH WHEN SHE HAS
SUCH A PRETTY LITTLE FACE.

283
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,208
- ( gasps )
- MAKAROV.

284
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,875
- NO, NO, NOT THE EAR AGAIN.
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I HATE THAT.

285
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,083
- YOU'RE NOT PLANNING ON PUTTING
THE MOVES ON HER

286
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,750
WHEN SHE GROWS UP, ARE YOU?

287
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,708
- NOT LITTLE OLD ME.

288
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,083
- SO WHAT'S HER STORY?

289
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,125
- SHE'S NOT MUCH OF A TALKER.

290
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,041
BUT APPARENTLY, ROB
SENT HER TO ME.

291
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:51,875
- OUR ROB?  WELL, DOES SHE
KNOW WHERE HE IS NOW?

292
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,875
- ACCORDING TO THE CHILD,
HE'S DEAD.

293
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,833
- ( gasps )

294
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,083
- TAKE A LOOK.

295
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,083
- ( gasps )

296
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:32,291
IT'S HEALED.
- YOU CAN SEE WITH IT?

297
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,041
- YES, MA'AM.
- THEN I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME

298
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,458
YOU LEAVE, YOUNG LADY.
NOTHING PERSONAL,

299
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,125
BUT I DON'T CARE MUCH
FOR PEOPLE.

300
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,166
- ( cries )

301
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,125
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

302
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,166
- ( gasps ) WAIT A MINUTE.

303
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,625
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

304
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,291
WHEN YOU CRY, THE INJURED EYE
ISN'T TEARING UP.

305
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,791
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S WRONG.

306
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,291
I MIXED THE MEDICINAL COMPOUND
PERFECTLY.

307
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:04,291
WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED?
- IT'S OKAY, MA'AM.

308
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,875
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

309
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,166
IT'S PROBABLY 'CAUSE
I'VE CRIED SO MUCH,

310
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,916
