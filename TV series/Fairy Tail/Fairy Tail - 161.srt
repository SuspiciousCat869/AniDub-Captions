Well, well! If

Still a drunk.

And when I'm sober
you'll still be smokin' hot.

You know how
to flatter a girl.

I heard you'd gone
into hiding a while back.

148
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,333
It seemed like such a shame.

Something like that.
What about you?

150
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,500
I hear you're actually
competing in the magic games.

151
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,833
At first I saw this
little trip as an excuse

152
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,250
to get hammered and
sample the local color.

Maybe we'll have our own

160
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,125
little party in a battle round.

161
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,583
It'd be nice to
settle the score.

162
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,416
[BACCHUS] You know
what we say in our guild.

163
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,833
You will always be.

164
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,208
Wild.

165
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,750
At least you're still
good for a chuckle, Erza!

166
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,416
[Bacchus laughs]

167
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,416
[LUCY] Who was
that walking distillery?

168
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,333
[ERZA] A member
of Quatro Cerberus.

169
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,625
He's one of their
S-Class wizards.

170
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:48,916
I've run into
him on jobs more

171
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,250
than a few times
over the years.

172
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,708
And I know his
strength all too well.

173
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,541
[ERZA] Drunken Hawk
Bacchus, master of

174
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,750
the Drunken Chop-Hanging Palm.

175
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,791
We've fought
on many occasions,

176
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,791
but there's never
been a clear winner.

177
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,666
What?

178
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,333
Y'mean he's as strong as you?

179
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,541
What's it matter?

180
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,333
That's all ancient history now.

181
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,833
There's no way Erza would
lose to a cocky wino!

182
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,375
Who said Erza's even
gonna fight him, nerd?

183
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,583
If she won't, then
I call dibs on him!

184
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,625
Tell me more about
this vision of yours.

185
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,583
What, exactly, did you see?

186
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,041
[CARLA] It was confusing because

187
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,833
it was only bits and pieces.

188
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,750
They're never very clear.

189
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,666
There was
a white knight,

190
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,666
an enormous magic circle.

191
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,750
Can you recall any more?

192
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,875
[CARLA] I saw something
that defied all reason.

193
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,583
[PORLYUSICA]
What do you mean by that?

194
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,958
[CARLA] I saw Mercurius
come crashing down.

195
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,958
And, as it happened, I thought
I heard someone singing.

196
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,625
[CARLA] Lucy.

197
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,333
[CHAPATI] Its day two of
the Grand Magic Games

198
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,583
and the stands are
exploding with excitement!

199
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,625
Joining me once
again is Mr. Yajima,

200
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,416
and our new special guest,
Sorcerer Weekly's Jason!

201
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,791
[JASON] So cool!

202
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,916
[CHAPATI] Let's get back
to the action already

203
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,166
in progress, as our wizards
take on the Chariots!

204
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,083
[CHAPATI] The point
of this game is to reach

205
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,791
the final goal
without falling off.

206
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:14,791
Simple, right?

207
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,125
Wrong!

208
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,250
[CHAPATI] The chariots
are constantly in motion.

209
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,666
And though it's
at a snail's pace,

210
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,750
one false move could cost you!

211
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,375
[CHAPATI] Which team
will survive this rough and

212
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,291
tumble sight-seeing
tour through Crocus

213
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,875
and be the first to
cross the finish line?

214
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,750
[CHAPATI] For those of you
here with us at Domus Flau,

215
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,875
we'll be showing the race in
crystal clear lacrima-vision!

216
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,208
[JASON] Cool!

217
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,583
You've seen a lot in
your days. But would you

218
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,333
have ever predicted
anything remotely like this?

219
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,916
Well.

220
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,166
Why in the hell
did we pick him?

221
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,791
Yeah, you'd think
the name "Chariots"

222
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,458
would be a big clue,
even for Natsu.

223
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,166
He was absolutely
insistent on participating.

224
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,750
[ELFMAN] Maybe he
thought he was gonna

225
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,541
get to fight chariots
or something.

226
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,958
[CHAPATI] Uh, oh!

227
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,583
I don't know what's wrong
with Fairy Tail A's Natsu,

228
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:01,333
but he can barely put one
foot in front of the other!

229
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,166
That's it; the world's
against us.

230
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,000
[CHAPATI] But that's not all!

231
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,666
Mere feet away are
Fairy Tail B's Gajeel, and

232
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,750
Sabertooth's Sting, who seem
to be in the same boat!

233
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,666
Huh?! Why am
I feeling sick?

234
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,791
I can't imagine
what could

235
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,416
be causing them to
slow down like this.

236
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,000
I could be wrong,
but I'd say they

237
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,625
share a common weakness
for moving vehicles.

238
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,958
No, this is Salamander's
stupid weakness!

239
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:34,416
So why do I wanna throw up?

240
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,833
I don't understand.

241
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,583
What is happening to Gajeel?

242
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:38,625
I'll tell you what!

243
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,541
He's stealing Natsu's shtick!

244
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,458
Even the Sabertooth
guy's ill.

245
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,750
Talk about a text-book
case of rotten luck.

246
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,208
This game is all about Sting's
one and only weakness,

247
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,583
so those other guilds have
no clue how easy they got off.

248
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,666
Yeah, Sting would
rock their face!

249
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,416
[CHAPATI] Now let's take a look

250
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,875
at the group leading the pack!

251
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,750
This race is as neck
and neck as it gets, folks!

252
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,375
[CHAPATI] At the front is
Blacksnake from Raven Tail!

253
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,916
Followed closely by
Blue Pegasus' Ichiya,

254
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,333
Lamia Scale's Yuka,
and Mermaid Heel's Lislie!

255
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,041
Feel the burn!

256
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,041
I'm surprised someone with

257
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,750
your figure can
run for this long.

258
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,250
Don't underestimate
chubby power, short stuff.

259
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,333
[CHAPATI]
Coming in behind them is

260
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:26,291
Quatro Cerberus'
reserve member Bacchus!

261
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,375
Man, that guy's loud.

262
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,666
Can't you let a man work off

263
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,541
last night's booze in peace?

264
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,250
[YUKA] Feel my Wave Boost!

265
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,416
Good luck using any magic

266
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,375
while you're inside
my shockwave!

267
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,791
Weren't you
listening before?

268
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,666
Chubby power rules!

269
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,708
There it is!

270
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,750
Lislie's gravity change magic!

271
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,208
She dodged Yuka's
wave and is now

272
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,250
making her way
towards the leaders!

273
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,916
A magic-neutralizing
wave, huh?

274
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,958
In that case!

275
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,458
Watch my
Swiftness Parfum!

276
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,958
Point-Blank Absorption style!

277
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,583
Wow.

278
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,500
They're really goin'
all out, aren't they?

279
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,083
Gets my soul all
stirred up, y'know?

280
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,125
Welp, guess I
might as well put

281
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,375
a little effort
into this race, too!

282
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,166
[BACCHUS] Check this out!

283
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,708
[CHAPATI] I don't believe it!

284
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,916
Bacchus demolished the
chariots with brute force!

285
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,250
Amazing.

286
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,541
He's even stronger than before.

287
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,708
[ELFMAN] What's with this guy?

288
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,833
[BACCHUS]
Catch ya later, losers!

289
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,083
Try not to fall
off before the finish!

290
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,916
That was a dirty trick!

291
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,625
You said it!

292
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,416
[LISLIE] No one
makes chubby fly!

293
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,625
[CHAPATI] What
happened to Lislie?

294
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:40,875
[JASON] A gravity change!

295
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,291
So cool!

296
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,375
[BACCHUS] WILD!

297
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,541
[CHAPATI] We have a winner!

298
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,541
I'm shaken and
stirred, baby!

299
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,500
[CHAPATI] Quatro Cerberus
scores 10 points!

300
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,875
I didn't know Cerberus had
someone like him in their guild!

301
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,000
That's what I call wild.

302
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,166
[ALL] Wild!

303
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,166
[CHAPATI] In second place is
Raven Tail's Blacksnake!

304
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,208
[CHAPATI] Lislie's in third,
Yuka takes fourth,

305
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,500
and Ichiya comes in fifth!

306
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:17,375
[CHAPATI] That just leaves the

307
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,458
three-way battle for last place.

308
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,625
[GAJEEL] This is embarrassing.

309
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,916
I used to be able to ride
on vehicles just fine!

310
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,166
[STING] Hey, that just means

311
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,291
you've finally become one.

312
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,375
You're the
real deal now...

313
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,208
...a card-carryin'
Dragon Slayer.

314
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,625
[STING] I guess
congrats are in order.

315
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,250
Welcome, newbie.

316
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,583
[GAJEEL] Newbie?

317
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,625
What's up?

318
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,791
Where did all of
my strength go?

319
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,583
Come on!

320
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,375
This blows!

321
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,666
Okay?

322
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,416
He thinks puking in
slow-mo is entertaining?

323
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,208
This a common affliction
amongst your kind Rogue?

324
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,416
I had thought that
only Sting and I had trouble

325
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,500
with motion sickness,
but it seems I was wrong.

326
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,166
[ROGUE THINKING] I'm glad
that's not me out there.

327
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,250
Does it affect
you too, Laxus?

328
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,708
Just don't
let Natsu know;

329
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,083
I'll never live it down.

330
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,750
I probably wouldn't have
admitted that if I were you.

331
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:24,791
Gotta keep movin'!
I'm not gonna lose like this!

332
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,666
[STING] Talk about uncool.

333
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,333
Anyone can see ya
got no strength left.

334
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,625
You're just making
fools of yourselves.

335
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,250
[STING] Fine, whatever.

336
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,375
I didn't need this win,

337
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,166
so I'll just let
you guys have it.

338
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,500
Sabertooth's
just gonna keep

339
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,458
rackin' up the
points after this.

340
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,166
In the end,
one measly little point

341
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,708
isn't gonna change the outcome.

342
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,750
One point is nothin'
to scoff at, kid.

343
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,208
Don't you forget that!

344
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,166
[STING] I don't get it.

345
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,375
Can you explain somethin' to me?

346
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,208
Why'd you even bother
entering the tournament?

347
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,916
Seriously.

348
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:21,708
[STING] I mean,
you're nothin' like

349
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,708
the Fairy Tail I
knew growin' up.

350
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,166
[STING] You're obsessed
with how tough you

351
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,166
are and what the rest of
the world thinks of you.

352
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:30,833
[STING] What happened to the

353
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,041
Fairy Tail of my childhood?

354
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,333
The guild that did whatever the

355
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,541
hell it wanted
whenever it wanted?

356
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,458
[STING] They never
cared what anybody

357
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,625
else said or thought of them!

358
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,083
The reason we're here
is for our friends!

359
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,916
[NATSU] The ones who waited for

360
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,291
us for all the
years we were gone!

361
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,708
[NATSU] Who fought through
the pain and the heartache.

362
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,166
[NATSU] They were humiliated,

363
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,833
but even so, they stayed strong!

364
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,625
[NATSU] And they kept
our guild together!

365
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,791
[NATSU] We're doing
this for all of them!

366
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,875
And we're gonna make
sure that everyone here knows.

367
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,000
The Fairy Tail
guild never gave up!

368
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,583
Not for an instant!

369
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,416
So there's no way I'm
gonna give up now!

370
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,458
[ALL] Oh, Natsu!

371
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,625
[CHAPATI] He did it!
Fairy Tail A's Natsu nabs sixth

372
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,208
place and scores two points!

373
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,875
'Bout time we got
some points on the board.

374
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,458
[CHAPATI] Gajeel from
Fairy Tail B takes

375
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:08,291
seventh place
and scores one point!

376
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,125
Now those boys
have some moxie.

377
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,416
Yeah, that was awesome!

378
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,583
Well, they're gutsy,
I'll give 'em that.

379
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,125
They're from Fairy
Tail, aren't they?

380
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,250
Maybe their guild's
not so bad after all.

381
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,083
He got me right
in the feels, man.

382
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:22,125
You know, I just might start
rooting for those guys now.

383
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,791
[MALE SPECTATOR 161G]
Way to rock, Fairy Tail!

384
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,250
[MALE SPECTATOR 161H] You
just earned yourself a new fan!

385
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,666
[CHAPATI] Crowd
favorite Sting forfeited

386
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,541
the race, so Sabertooth
gets zero points!

387
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,125
You're doing
this for your friends?

388
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,416
That's a load of crap,
and you know it.

389
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,041
[CHAPATI] And Raven Tail
jumps ahead to first place!

390
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,500
[JASON] Cool!

391
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:53,916
[CHAPATI]
Which leaves Sabertooth tied

392
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,541
for second with Lamia Scale!

393
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,041
Wait, we're not first?
How did we fall behind?

394
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,833
Sting was feelin'
pukey and didn't finish.

395
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,791
Ugh, my stomach wants to
jump right out of my body.

396
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:09,083
[LUCY] So you're sure
Natsu will be okay?

397
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,666
Why wouldn't he?
It's just motion sickness.

398
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,625
Stop worrying and let
him get some rest.

399
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,333
[LUCY] What about Wendy?

400
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,708
[PORLYUSICA]
She's coming along nicely.

401
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,791
At least you're up now,
Carla. How're you feeling?

402
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:24,791
[CARLA] Fine.

403
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,708
I'm so glad to hear that.

404
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,333
The others are waiting,
so I'll check back later 'kay?

405
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,333
You're not going
to say anything to her?

406
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,458
I just don't think
that it would do any good.

407
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,458
They'd never believe me.

408
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,833
Not about a future
like that, anyway.

409
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,708
I suppose it's just as
well that you don't, then.

410
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,333
Besides, you don't seem
to believe it yourself.

411
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,250
You're right!
I don't believe it!

412
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:53,458
How can I? It's too
bizarre to be true!

413
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:58,291
It wasn't a premonition.
Just a silly dream.

414
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,250
[CHAPATI] And now for
the part you've all

415
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,875
been waiting for:
the battle portion!

416
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,750
[CHAPATI] Today's first
match pits, Blacksnake,

417
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,625
the dark python of our first
place guild, Raven Tail...

418
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:12,833
...against Lamia
Scale's own Toby Olorta!

419
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,458
[Toby howls]

420
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,083
[CHAPATI]
It's serpent vs. hound!

421
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,791
Which one of them
will end up top dog?

422
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,833
I expect to see a clean
fight out there, understand?

423
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:26,041
Toby is so ferocious!
Bad, dog!

424
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,000
Hey guys!
Did I miss anything?

425
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,833
They've been
takin' their sweet time.

426
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,250
It's just about to start.

427
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,750
That dog dude's gonna
be goin' in for Lyon's guild.

428
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,916
It's the Raven Tail
wizard you should watch.

429
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,916
Ya know
he won't play fair.

430
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,041
Yeah. I see
you too, Blondie.

431
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,375
[LUCY THINKS]
She's covered in bruises!

432
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,625
[ALEXAI (IVAN)] Flare.

433
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,500
I won't tolerate any
more embarrassment.

434
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:53,916
You do realize who you

435
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,666
owe your victory to, don't you?

436
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,000
Yes, sir.

437
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,791
But that Blonde bimbo
won't stop staring at me!

438
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:05,041
[ALEXAI (IVAN)] Are you
asking for another beating?

439
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:08,041
[FLARE] No.
I won't argue again!

440
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,916
Please have mercy on me.

441
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,750
[TOBY] Ultra-Poison Nails!

442
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,625
Mega-Mega Jellyfish!

443
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:27,958
[TOBY] He just vanished!

444
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:28,833
You fool!

445
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,750
He's using mimic magic!

446
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,375
[BLACKSNAKE] Sand Rebellion!

447
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,416
That freak stole my spell!

448
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,666
He must be able
to mimic different

449
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,708
types of magic or something!

450
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:44,791
Mimic magic.

451
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,750
I haven't seen that
in a long time.

452
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,041
Come on, dog guy!

453
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,083
Tear him up!

454
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,375
Obliterate that
Raven Tail scumbag,

455
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,250
and I'll pay your
weight in gold!

456
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,500
[Toby howls]

457
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,750
You're stronger
than I thought you were!

458
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,875
[BLACKSNAKE]
You're not so bad yourself.

459
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:01,333
[TOBY] I wish I had a
cool name like Blacksnake!

460
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,000
It's just my wizard name.

461
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,875
You mean you lied to me?

462
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,333
[BLACKSNAKE] What
are you talking about?

463
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,375
[TOBY] Alright!

464
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,458
Then, if I beat you,
you gotta tell

465
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:09,791
me what your real name is!

466
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:10,833
Deal?

467
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,125
[BLACKSNAKE] I'm fine with that.

468
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,708
But what if I win?

469
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,708
[TOBY] Then I'll tell
you my super-special

470
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,208
secret that nobody knows!

471
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,291
[BLACKSNAKE] Sounds intriguing.

struck a friendly wager.
