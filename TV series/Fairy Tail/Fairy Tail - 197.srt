a few rounds of drinks
to celebrate their victory!

We can't just bail on 'em!

I got him. I'm comin', Macao!

Just keep my boy safe!

We need you.
You're the only one

who can save him.
Please come. He'll die.

[MELDY] I'm sorry.
I think it's too late.

come for you to die.

You'd turn your back on
your own kind for this human?

[ATLAS FLAME]
Didn't you hear me?

32
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:04,166
He may have been born human,
but was raised by Igneel,

33
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,041
King of the Fire Dragons.
Therefore he is my family!

Such unbelievable hubris!

35

back down from this fight!

And this fire's
got me feelin' good!

That being said, you've still
sustained multiple injuries.

You can't continue buying time!

It just ain't my style!

[NATSU] Besides, there's a
promise that I gotta keep!

[PANTHERLILY]
I thought Laxus would have

58
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,041
more of an effect than that.

Is Zirconis really
that powerful?

[CARLA] It's true, he possesses
Dragon Slaying magic.

61
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,000
But nobody ever said
that it would be

62
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,708
an easy task to accomplish.

to recall that you were

71

flapping your gums earlier
about bluster, weren't ya?

72

[ZIRCONIS] You have the nerve
to hit my handsome face?

You're trying to make
me angry aren't ya?

Impossible! That did nothing?

00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,750

all it did was get him

riled up even further.

77
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,125
[ZIRCONIS] I've had
just about enough of this.

00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,750
I can play all night
with these little girls.

79
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:24,958
But I don't have much interest
in messing around with guys.

entire life in the shadows.

128
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,375
Ruled by darkness.

129
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:46,875
[ULTEAR] I thrived on deception,
contempt, rancor, and death.

130
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,083
And still, I received
forgiveness and compassion.

131
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:53,291
Gray allowed me a
second chance at life.

132
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:58,000
I wanted to atone for my sins
so I founded Crime Sorcière.

133
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,375
The "witch's crime."

134
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:05,791
But I will never find salvation.
At my core, I'm still the same.

135
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:09,291
A witch crumbling under
the weight of her own crimes.

136
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,791
One who'd take the life
of an innocent.

137
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,916
Perhaps that's because
I myself don't deserve to live.

Oh my. All these books.

140
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,166
I see that you've
developed a keen interest

141
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,958
in time magic, have you not?

142
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,208
[YOUNG ULTEAR]
Yes, Master Hades.

143
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,833
It's quite fascinating, sir.

144
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:47,041
You needn't be
so formal, child.

145
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,833
Please, get on your feet.

146
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,166
[YOUNG ULTEAR]
Master Hades.

147
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,250
You once sparked my
curiosity when you spoke of

148
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,666
a magic that can
retrieve lost happiness.

149
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,083
Do you remember, sir?

150
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,708
You're referring to
Arc of Time magic?

151
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,375
[YOUNG ULTEAR]
Yes, I've finally been able to

152
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,875
track down some information!

153
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,375
This book contains some notes

154
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,000
that I believe may
teach me how to use it.

155
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,041
[HADES]
The Last Ages spell.

156
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,375
I absolutely forbid its use.

157
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,583
[YOUNG ULTEAR] But why?
This is exactly the spell

158
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,875
that I was hoping to discover.

159
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,125
It turns back time!

160
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,125
It lets you do things
over again. This magic.

161
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:23,166
I would do whatever it takes
of me to master it someday.

162
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,708
[HADES] The price of
mastering the Last Ages spell

163
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,166
is quite a heavy one, indeed.

164
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,458
It does, in fact,
turn back time.

165
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,458
But the caster must forfeit
their time in return.

166
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,166
"Their time?"

167
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,083
In other words, their life.

168
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,000
[HADES] Time will travel back
for the world at large,

169
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,666
but, for the wizard
who casts the spell,

170
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,291
they'll lose the rest
of their remaining time.

171
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:54,708
[YOUNG ULTEAR gasps]
Oh. I see. Thank you.

172
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:02,583
[ULTEAR] At this point,
I will gladly pay.

173
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:06,333
If giving up this life
of sin and sorrow,

174
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:10,666
if that can truly set
the world as it was,

175
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,291
then so be it.

176
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:20,500
Arc of Time Last Ages!

177
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:41,791
[ULTEAR groaning]

178
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:45,250
[ULTEAR]
I must endure it! This pain.

179
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,708
It's nothing compared to what
I've brought into this world.

180
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,291
All the suffering
I've inflicted upon others.

181
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,541
Their pain. Their deaths!

182
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,791
Every cell in my body
feels like it's on fire!

183
00:12:56,875 --> 00:13:00,875
The very fabric of my
existence ripped to shreds.

184
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,458
My life is being
torn from me!

185
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,750
All as payment for
the lives of others.

186
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,458
This is what
I give to the world!

187
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,291
[ULTEAR] I will take this
pain and tenfold more!

188
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,500
Whatever the cost.
I will pay it!

189
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:22,166
I will sacrifice
my life. My future!

190
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,708
[ULTEAR screaming]

191
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,875
[ULTEAR] I ran through
the valley of death

192
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,708
reveling in sin
to escape my demons.

193
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,291
My loneliness.
Never truly realizing

194
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,125
that I was no longer alone.

195
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:41,125
Gray. Jellal.
And sweet Meldy.

196
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,000
[ULTEAR] I never
deserved their forgiveness. 

197
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:49,250
Their warmth was wasted on me.

198
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:53,125
I was blind to it.
Obsessed with my past,

199
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:57,083
I could never live in the
present, much less the future.

200
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,875
But now I can
find redemption.

201
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,333
I can give the time I would've
wasted in this world,

202
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:08,833
so the ones I love can
live and be a part of it.

203
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,583
I ask the hands
of time to reverse!

204
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:14,458
To return the world
to what it once was.

205
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:15,875
If only briefly.

206
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:20,083
Before it was thrown into
chaos by that damned gate!

207
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:23,625
Let my life be enough!

208
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,583
[ULTEAR gasps]

209
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:06,208
[ULTEAR]
It worked. I've done it.

210
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:09,958
I've turned back time.

211
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:16,125
[ULTEAR gasps]
What? One minute?

212
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:22,083
Is that what my life was
worth? Just one minute.

213
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:26,750
No. This can't
be all they get.

214
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:30,083
It's not enough.
I've failed them!

215
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,500
[GRAY]
Get down!

216
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,666
[LYON]
Stay focused!

217
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,458
This is a war-zone!

218
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,291
[MELDY]
Sorry!

219
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,291
[JUVIA gasps] I can still
feel the warmth of Gray's hand

220
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,166
on my tushie!

221
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,041
Juvia!

222
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,666
[MELDY, GRAY gasp]

223
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,708
[LYON]
What just happened here?

224
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:01,875
I died? I don't get it!

225
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,500
A dream?

226
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,250
But I saw it as well.

227
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,500
The hell? What was that?

228
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm starting to get totally
creeped out here you guys.

229
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,208
Some of the little ones

230
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,250
were climbing over
that rubble there.

231
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,541
[LYON grunts]

232
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,416
[LYON] They came just
like we knew they would!

233
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,458
[GRAY grunts]

234
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,250
[LYON]
What the hell is going on?

235
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,708
That was exactly
what we just saw!

236
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,250
We all knew. But how?

237
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:43,708
[JET] Whoa!
[DROY] That was way too close.

238
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,833
[DROY]
But it's like I saw it coming.

239
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,708
I could see that
far in the future.

240
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,875
[JET] Premonition?
Let's make sure

241
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,083
it doesn't come true! Come on!

242
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,208
[DROY]
Yeah!

243
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,833
[ROMEO]
It was like a dream.

244
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,333
[WAKABA]
But we were all wide-awake.

245
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,875
[MACAO]
It's dangerous to stay here.

246
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,083
[WAKABA, ROMEO gasp]

247
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,166
[NARRATOR] That night,
people all over the world

248
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,125
caught a glimpse
one minute into the future.

249
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,500
But much like a dream,

250
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,750
it quickly slipped
from their memories.

251
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,583
Leaving behind a faintly
eerie sensation for those

252
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,875
who experienced it firsthand.

253
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,291
So this phenomenon,
although miraculous,

254
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,250
went largely unnoticed.

255
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,291
However, for the
wizards doing battle,

256
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:32,125
that minute they peered into
the future was worth a lifetime.

257
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:35,833
It was the difference
between life, and death.

258
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,750
[WENDY]
What was that?

259
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,666
We can figure it out later!

260
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,166

[ZIRCONIS groaning]

264
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:58,750
That vision. Or premonition.

00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,375
Was that your doing, Carla?

266
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,875
I swear it wasn't me.

267
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,791
And it definitely wasn't me.

268
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,416
[PANTHERLILY, CARLA]
Nobody thought it was.

Oh.

Such a brief time.

Which is it gonna be?

00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,458
I got ya now!

276
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,541
[NARRATOR] But that one minute
bought humanity countless years,

277
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,083
and secured its future.

278
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,291
[GAJEEL]
That was weird.

279
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,166
It's like I knew
what it was gonna do!

What is this? It's like time
has been disrupted somehow.

Has something happened
to the Eclipse gate?

[FUTURE ROGUE] What promise?
What do you mean?

from this point on,
so we should leave.

00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,125
[LUCY huffs]
Read it!

317
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,791
[YUKINO] "Our one hope...
is that the Eclipse gate

318
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,083
in this time period
gets destroyed.

319
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,500
If that happens, the one
that exists in the future

320
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,250
will disappear as well.

321
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:47,458
And none of the horrible
things will ever happen."

322
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,041
[ARCADIOS]
But can that be true?

323
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,125
[LUCY] Yes, it can't still
be around in the future

324
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,166
if we destroy the
gate in our time!

325
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,875
There will be an entirely
new future where the eclipse

326
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:59,250
was destroyed in the past.
It'll be gone forever.

327
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:02,250
Just a part of ancient history.

328
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,541
And if it's not around,
Rogue won't have a way

329
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,083
to travel back in time.

330
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,041
[HISUI] But all of that has
already happened in our time,

331
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:09,833
so is it still
possible to change it?

332
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:11,333
[HAPPY]
Yeah, and if we're lucky,

333
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,833
Rogue and the dragons will
get out of our time for good.

334
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,833
Well, it's certainly
worth a try!

335
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:19,166
[ARCADIOS] You're right. But it
is a rather daunting task.

336
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,041
How can we destroy
that massive structure

337
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:22,875
when our resources
are spread so thin?

338
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,333
[PANTHERLILY] It won't be
an easy job, that's for sure.

339
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:27,916
[LUCY] Easy or not
we have to find a way!

340
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,500
The future of the
entire world is at stake here.

341
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,416
Let's take it down. I made
a promise to myself,

342
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,083
and there's no way
I'm gonna break it.

343
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,666
[NATSU] Hey man!
Did ya get a load of

344
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,041
that awesome news?

345
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:17,541
[HAPPY] All we gotta do
is destroy the Eclipse gate

346
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,125
and all our problems
will be solved!

347
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,000
[NATSU] I mean, could
the job be any more

348
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:22,416
perfect for us, or what?

349
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,583
[HAPPY] I know! Destroying
stuff is what we do best!

350
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,500
[NATSU] Aw yeah,
I'm fired up now!

351
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:27,958
[HAPPY] That thing
is pretty big though.

352
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:30,083
It's gonna take some kinda
plan to bring it down.

353
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,166
[NATSU]
Come on, isn't it obvious?

354
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,625
[HAPPY] Oh. I think
I know what to do!

355
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:37,041
[HAPPY and NATSU]
Next Time: Fields of Gold!

356
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:38,750
[NATSU] There's only
one thing to do!

357
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:40,250
[HAPPY]
That's right!

358
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:41,958
[HAPPY and NATSU] Blast it
with all the magic we've got!
