1
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:18,333
- HEY, GUYS.

2
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:19,958
READY FOR SOME
MORE "FAIRY TAIL"?

3
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,791
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING,

4
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,291
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE ROOM

5
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:26,375
AND DON'T SIT
TOO CLOSE TO THE TV.

6
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,625
- PREVIOUSLY
ON "FAIRY TAIL..."

7
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:30,916
- Happy: THE PHANTOM LORD
GUILD ATTACKED US.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,125
ERZA USED UP ALL HER
MAGIC ENERGY BLOCKING A BLAST

9
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:34,250
FROM THEIR CANNON JUPITER

10
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:35,708
AND NOW SHE'S OUT OF COMMISSION.

11
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,375
SO WE HAD NO CHOICE
BUT TO STORM

12
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:38,500
THEIR GUILD HALL
AND DESTROY THE CANNON

13
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,458
BEFORE IT FIRES AGAIN.

14
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,875
- ( singing in Japanese )

15
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,000
- ( static charge )

16
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,583
- Happy: HURRY, NATSU!

17
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,125
THE JUPITER CANNON
IS ALMOST READY TO FIRE AGAIN.

18
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,416
- YEAH, I KNOW!

19
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,416
- IT'S TOO LATE.
BLUE FIRE!

20
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,916
- WHOA, THAT WAS
COLD GOING DOWN.

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,750
I NEVER TASTED
FIRE LIKE THAT BEFORE.

22
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:34,958
- SO IT'S YOU,
FAIRY TAIL'S DRAGON SLAYER.

23
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,416
WELL, THIS ISN'T GOING TO
WORK OUT WELL FOR EITHER OF US.

24
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,125
IS IT?
- HUH?

25
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:41,708
- BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH
IMPERVIOUS TO FIRE ATTACKS.

26
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,375
- I HAVEN'T EVEN HIT YOU YET.

27
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,166
HOW DO YOU KNOW
MY FIRE WON'T HURT YOU?!

28
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,750
- GO AHEAD AND GIVE IT
YOUR BEST SHOT,

29
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,166
BUT YOU WON'T
BE ABLE TO HIT ME.

30
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,541
- WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

31
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,458
FIRE DRAGON...
- I TOLD YOU,

32
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,791
AS THE ELEMENT OF FIRE,
I CAN CONTROL ANY FLAME!

33
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,250
- ...SPIT!

34
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,875
- UGH.
- ( laughs )

35
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,125
I GOT YOU GOOD!

36
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,458
- Happy: TO KEEP FROM
SEEING THOSE TEARS.

37
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,666
- Woman: 15 MINUTES 
UNTIL JUPITER FIRES.

38
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,791
- NATSU, YOU GOT TO HURRY.

39
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,083
WE CAN'T LET THE CANNON FIRE.
- THAT WAS A DUMB MOVE.

40
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,583
DO YOU THINK
THIS IS A GAME?

41
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,416
ORANGE FIRE!

42
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,291
- YOU CALL THAT AN ATTACK?
WELL, I CALL IT MY DINNER.

43
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,375
( slurps )

44
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,875
BLEAH! NASTY!

45
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,250
UGH! IT STINKS!

46
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,833
- ( laughs )
IT SMELLS LIKE AN OLD RAG

47
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,708
SOAKED IN SPOILED MILK,
DOESN'T IT?

48
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,291
- THAT'S A DIRTY TRICK.

49
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,958
- AND A FACE
FULL OF SPIT ISN'T?

50
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,791
- Woman: ONE MINUTE 
UNTIL JUPITER FIRES.

51
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,625
- COME ON! HURRY UP, NATSU!

52
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,958
- LET GO!
- ( laughs )

53
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,000
NOW YOU WANT TO FIGHT
WITHOUT USING MAGIC. 

54
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:49,000
THAT'S FINE BY ME!
MY KATANA IS AT THE READY.

55
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,416
- ( chuckles )

56
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,833
- YOU THINK YOU'RE SO SMOOTH.

57
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,625
A LITTLE DING LIKE THAT
WON'T DESTROY A GIANT LACRIMA.

58
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,500
- MAYBE NOT, BUT NOW
YOU'RE SWORDLESS,

59
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,083
WHICH MEANS I'VE GOT
THE UPPER HAND.

60
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,291
- GEEZ, HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU 

61
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,500
THAT WON'T WORK.

62
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,750
- ( grunting )

63
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:19,708
- HOW'D HE DO THAT?

64
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,625
HE EXPANDED THE RANGE
OF HIS FIRE POWER

65
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:22,625
SO IT WOULD HIT ME.

66
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,958
- Mirajane:
WE ONLY HAVE 30 SECONDS.

67
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,125
- THIS ISN'T LOOKING GOOD.

68
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,583
- WHY'S HE TAKING SO LONG?

69
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,583
- OH NO!
WE'RE DEAD MEAT.

70
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,041
- Woman: 20 SECONDS
UNTIL JUPITER FIRES.

71
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,750
- ( growling )

72
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,875
- THINK YOU'RE GONNA
BLAST ME AGAIN?

73
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,000
NOT GONNA HAPPEN!
I'LL KEEP MY DISTANCE

74
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,416
AND CONTROL
YOUR FIRE FROM HERE.

75
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,958
- ( screaming )

76
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,125
- WHAT THE--
I CAN'T GET IT TO MOVE.

77
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,791
IT WON'T EVEN BUDGE.

78
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,833
( strains )

79
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,583
HE'S BLOCKING MY CONTROL.

80
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,583
HOW'D HE FIGURE OUT
HOW TO DO THAT...

81
00:04:58,666 --> 00:04:59,458
IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT?!

82
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,250
- Happy: NATSU!

83
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,916
- THIS IS MY FIRE!

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,041
AND I WON'T
LET YOU MESS WITH IT!

85
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,250
- HA! YOUR ATTACK'S NO GOOD

86
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,750
IF YOU CAN'T
HIT YOUR TARGET.

87
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,166
- Woman: THREE, TWO...

88
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,541
ONE...
- OH CRAP.

89
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,125
- WHOEVER SAID
YOU WERE MY TARGET?

90
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:30,916
- HEY, CHECK IT OUT.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,958
THEY BLEW IT UP. 
- YEAH, THEY DID.

92
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,041
THE JUPITER CANNON'S
BEEN DESTROYED JUST IN TIME.

93
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,125
- HE OUTSMARTED ME.

94
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,000
- HEY, BUDDY,
SOMEBODY TAUGHT ME

95
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,750
SOMETHING ABOUT FIRE MAGIC
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

96
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,375
YOU CAN NEVER CONTROL FIRE
IF YOUR HEART ISN'T IN IT.

97
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:51,666
- Happy: I GET IT.

98
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,708
HE HAD TO TAKE THE TIME
TO FIGURE OUT

99
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,916
HOW TO OVERCOME TOTOMARU'S
FIRE CONTROL

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,041
OR HE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO DESTROY THE CANNON.

101
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:02,541
NOW I FEEL KIND OF BAD
ABOUT RUSHING HIM LIKE THAT.

102
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,291
- ATTA' BOY, NATSU.  YEAH.
- WATCH OUT.

103
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,666
WE'RE COMING FOR YOU, PHANTOM.

104
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,250
- YEAH, WE GOT THIS.

105
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,125
WIPE OUT THE ENEMY!
- ( cheering )

106
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,833
- DON'T GET COCKY.
YOU HAVEN'T BEATEN ME YET.

107
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:19,208
AWAKEN THE GIANT!

108
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,958
- I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU
MESSING WITH MY MAGIC.

109
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,666
PLAY WITH MY FIRE AND
YOU'RE BOUND TO GET BURNED.

110
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,625
YOU GOT ME?!

111
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,875
- ELEMENT CONNECTION SECURED.
- ACTIVATING HORIZONTAL

112
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,083
STABILIZERS.
- ALL WIZARDS IN DANGER ZONE,

113
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,666
EVACUATE!
- THE GIANT AWAKENS!

114
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,833
- HEY, NOW, WHAT
THE HECK'S GOING ON?

115
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,416
- THE WHOLE PLACE IS TILTING.

116
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,125
- HE'S AWAKENING IT RIGHT NOW?

117
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:50,416
BUT THERE'S NO HORIZONTAL
STABILIZATION IN HERE.

118
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,625
- STABALI-- WHAT?

119
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:52,625
- ( both grunt )

120
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,708
- OH NO, WHAT'S IT DOING NOW?

121
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,875
- HIP JOINTS STABILIZED.
NOW STANDING.

122
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,916
- YOU FAIRY TAILERS ARE THROUGH.

123
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,750
PHANTOM'S GIANT
WILL SLAUGHTER YOU.

124
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,583
HUH?
- NATSU,

125
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,250
GET UP.
- I CAN'T.

126
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,750
- NO WAY.

127
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,750
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.
- THE GIANT.

128
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,666
PHANTOM'S MOST
POWERFUL WEAPON.

129
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,708
- Jose: KNEEL BEFORE ME,
YOU DETESTABLE BRATS...

130
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,416
OR YOU FALL VICTIM
TO MY WRATH.

131
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,291
SAVOR YOUR LAST MOMENTS 
BECAUSE SOON, I WILL END

132
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,291
YOUR PATHETIC
LITTLE LIVES.

133
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,083
- WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

134
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,750
- ( frightened murmurs )

135
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,791
- THEY'RE COMING
TO ATTACK AGAIN.

136
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:44,083
- GIANTS AND GHOSTS? HOW ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO HANDLE THIS?

137
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,333
- JUST FOCUS ON
THESE THINGS FOR NOW.

138
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,958
WE'LL LET NATSU TAKE CARE
OF THE GIANT FOR US.

139
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,000
- SURE, BUT WHAT ABOUT...

140
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,541
- HIS MOTION SICKNESS?

141
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,500
- ( all groans )

142
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:55,833
- ( moans )

143
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,708
- COME ON,
YOU GOT TO GET UP.

144
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,500
- WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
YOU GET MOTION SICKNESS?

145
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,875
GUESS YOU CAN'T EAT FIRE
RIGHT NOW, CAN YOU?

146
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:06,250
WELL THEN, TIME FOR ME
TO FINISH YOU OFF.

147
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,458
- NATSU!

148
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,333
- PREPARE TO DIE,
DRAGON SLAYER!

149
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,208
WAIT.

150
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,833
HEY.  NO!

151
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,416
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?!

152
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,958
- YOU'RE NOT A MAN.

153
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,291
YOU'RE A BACKWARDS 
SHOOTING SNOWFLAKE!

154
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,458
- Totomaru:
THAT MAKES NO SENSE!

155
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:24,375
- THANKS, YOU GUYS.
- YOU TWO ARE SO COOL.

156
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,541
YOU SHOWED THAT PHANTOM JERK
WHO'S BOSS.

157
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:29,166
- WHAT'S YOUR DEAL, NATSU?
THAT WAS JUST SAD.

158
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,666
- IF YOU WERE A REAL MAN,

159
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,958
YOU'D MAKE THE GIANT
MOTION SICK OF YOU. 

160
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,791
- SO IS THIS ALL THAT'S LEFT
OF THE JUPITER CANNON?

161
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,416
- AYE.
- THEN YOU DID GOOD.

162
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,250
- HE MUST HAVE STOPPED MOVING
BECAUSE I'M FEELING BETTER NOW.

163
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,000
- I'M GONNA FLY OUTSIDE 
AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.

164
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,833
- ( shouting )

165
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:50,166
- HEY, LOOK, WHAT'S THAT?
- IT'S DRAWING SOMETHING.

166
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,583
- A MAGIC CIRCLE!

167
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,250
- THAT'S THE MAGIC CIRCLE
FOR AN ABYSS BREAK,

168
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:59,333
ONE OF THE FORBIDDEN SPELLS.
- UH-OH.

169
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,041
- LOOK AT THE SIZE OF IT.

170
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:05,000
A BLACK WAVE THAT BIG WOULD
WIPE OUT THE ENTIRE CITY.

171
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,500
- WE'RE DOOMED.

172
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,291
- WHAT'LL WE DO?
WE GOT TO STOP 'EM.

173
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,875
- I GUESS WE SHOULD SPLIT UP
AND START LOOKING

174
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,041
FOR THIS THING'S
POWER SOURCE, RIGHT?

175
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,333
- MAN, ARE WE EVER GONNA
CATCH A BREAK?

176
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,750
- COME ON,
LET'S DO THIS, GUYS.

177
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,041
- YEAH.

178
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,666
- MIRA, HOW LONG
DO YOU THINK WE HAVE

179
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,750
UNTIL THE GIANT
CASTS THAT SPELL?

180
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,541
- I'D SAY ABOUT TEN MINUTES.

181
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,083
IF ONLY WE COULD FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S POWERING IT.

182
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,041
- DON'T WORRY.
I'M SURE THE GUYS INSIDE

183
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,750
ARE LOOKING FOR THE POWER SOURCE
RIGHT NOW.

184
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,708
- SOMEONE'S IN THERE
WITH NATSU?

185
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,375
- YEAH, GRAY AND ELFMAN.

186
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,416
- ELFMAN?! BUT WHY?

187
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,083
- WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
HE WANTED TO GO.

188
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,875
- YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO
THAT HE CAN'T FIGHT.

189
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,791
IT'S JUST TOO DANGEROUS.

190
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,500
- HE'LL BE FINE.

191
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,041
HE WAS ONE OF OUR BEST FIGHTERS
IN THE RAID EARLIER.

192
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,416
- FIGHTING GRUNTS IS ONE THING,
BUT IF HE WENT UP AGAINST

193
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,375
ONE OF PHANTOM'S BEST
AS HE IS NOW,

194
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,375
I DON'T KNOW
IF HE COULD HANDLE IT.

195
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,125
- WELL, YEAH,

196
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,291
I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE WORRIED

197
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,375
AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED BACK THEN.

198
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,416
I WOULD BE TOO.

199
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,375
LISTEN, WE ALL
SUFFERED WITH YOU.

200
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,416
BUT I THINK THIS IS HIS WAY

201
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,416
OF TRYING TO LEAVE
THE PAST BEHIND

202
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,250
AND MOVE FORWARD.
LET HIM DO IT.

203
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,291
- Mirajane:
ELFMAN...

204
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,958
FIGHTING TO LEAVE
THE PAST BEHIND.

205
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,666
LISANNA.

206
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:30,833
I NEED TO START
MOVING FORWARD TOO.

207
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,791
- ( muttering )

208
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,958
- OH NO!
- MIRA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

209
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,583
- STOP, DON'T DO IT.

210
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,750
- Man: NO, DON'T!
- Woman: STOP, COME BACK.

211
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,916
- WELL, WELL.

212
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,583
- LEAVE THEM ALONE.
I'M THE ONE THAT YOU'RE AFTER.

213
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,083
I'LL SURRENDER IF YOU SWEAR

214
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,333
TO STOP ATTACKING
OUR GUILD.

215
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,750
- Mirajane:
HOPEFULLY, THIS'LL BUY US

216
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,166
A LITTLE MORE TIME.

217
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,750
- MASTER!
- IS THAT HER?

218
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,000
- ( scoffs )

219
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,458
BE GONE, IMPOSTER.

220
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:00,208
- Mirajane: HOW'D HE KNOW?

221
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,791
- Jose: ( laughing )

222
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,416
NICE TRANSFORMATION,

223
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,708
BUT YOU CAN'T FOOL ME,
YOUNG LADY.

224
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:09,208
I KNEW FROM THE START THAT
LUCY HEARTFILIA WASN'T HERE.

225
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,416
- WHAT NOW?

226
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,208
- ( zapping )
- ( yelling )

227
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,750
- I'M USELESS.

228
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,625
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT.

229
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,250
- Elfman: ( roars )

230
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,750
AS A REAL MAN,
IT'S MY DUTY

231
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,833
TO PROTECT FAIRY TAIL
EVEN IF IT COSTS ME MY LIFE.

232
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:27,791
- <i>OUI?</i>

233
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,083
<i>SALUT.</i>

234
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,416
- ONE OF THE ELEMENT FOUR.

235
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,000
- Cana: ELFMAN CAN HOLD HIS OWN
AGAINST PHANTOM...

236
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:41,791
BECAUSE FAIRY TAIL WIZARDS
NEVER GIVE UP WITHOUT A FIGHT.

237
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:53,000
- ( whimpering )
- ( townspeople shouting )

238
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,083
- ( wizards shouting )
- ELFMAN...

239
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,958
- WHAT THE-- NO!
- ( screams )

240
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,375
( screams )

241
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,708
( grunts )

242
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,000
- Jose: DID YOU REALLY THINK

243
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,291
YOUR LITTLE PARLOR TRICK
WOULD FOOL ME?

244
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,791
AS PUNISHMENT,
I'LL CRUSH YOU TO DEATH

245
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,041
AS YOU WATCH
YOUR FRIENDS PERISH.

246
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,166
- ( murmurs )
- MIRA!

247
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,666
- WE GOT TO GET
HER DOWN SOMEHOW.

248
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,125
- BUT HOW?!

249
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:20,708
- PLEASE, GUYS.
PLEASE DON'T LET US DOWN.

250
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:23,916
WE'RE ALL COUNTING ON YOU
TO STOP THAT GIANT.

251
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,625
- ( speaks French )
MY NAME IS SOL,

252
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,875
MONSIEUR SOL. 
- LIKE I CARE.

253
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,333
ALL I WANT TO KNOW
IS HOW TO STOP THIS THING.

254
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,708
BEAST ARM!

255
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,541
BLACK BULL!

256
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,375
- WHAT'S THIS? ONLY YOUR
RIGHT ARM CAN TRANSFORM?

257
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,916
IT APPEARS THE RUMORS

258
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,083
FLOATING AROUND
ABOUT YOU ARE TRUE.

259
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,916
- IF YOU DON'T SHUT YOUR TRAP,
I'LL MAKE YOU.

260
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,458
- YOU HAVE A LITTLE SISTER?
( speaks French )

261
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,291
( speaks French )

262
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,125
( speaks French )

263
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,791
- ( groans )

264
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,458
- <i>NON, NON, NON.</i>

265
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,583
<i>SALUT.</i>

266
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,291
- YOU'RE SERIOUSLY CREEPY.

267
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,916
<i>- NON, NON, NON.</i>

268
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,250
WITH THREE <i>"NON",</i> YOU DON'T
STAND A CHANCE.

269
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,666
- GET OFF ME, MAN-SEWER SOL.

270
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,000
- IT'S "MONSIEUR," IDIOT.

271
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,958
- MAN, HE'S A LOT STRONGER
THAN HE LOOKS.

272
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,125
- MANY YEARS AGO,

273
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,250
YOU ATTEMPTED
A FULL-BODY TAKEOVER

274
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,750
AND FAILED, NO?
YOU WENT BERSERK.

275
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,583
- YOU SHUT UP!

276
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,666
BEAST ARM, IRON BULL!

277
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,458
LISANNA.

278
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:40,125
- I APOLOGIZE,
BUT I TOOK THE LIBERTY

279
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,291
OF SCANNING YOUR MEMORIES
WHEN YOU SO RUDELY

280
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,583
STEPPED ON ME EARLIER.

281
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,083
( chuckles )

282
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,416
- WHY YOU--
- MY, WHAT AN...

283
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,791
ADORABLE LITTLE
SISTER YOU HAVE.

284
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,166
I GATHERED FROM YOUR MEMORIES

285
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,208
THAT YOU HAVEN'T
SEEN HER IN A WHILE.

286
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,208
OH, <i>PARDONNEZ-MOI.</i>

287
00:13:56,291 --> 00:14:00,750
NOW I SEE THAT SHE WAS BURIED
IN THE COLD, DARK GROUND.

288
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,500
( speaks French )

289
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,041
HOW COULD YOU DO SOMETHING

290
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:08,208
SO CRUEL TO SOMEONE
WHO LOVED YOU SO MUCH?

291
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,250
- WELL, BIG BROTHER ELF?

292
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,791
- ( strains )

293
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,375
( screams )

294
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,375
I CAN'T LET HIM GET TO ME.

295
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,250
I'VE GOT TO DO THIS.

296
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,833
- <i>NON, NON, NON.</i>

297
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,541
( speaks French )

298
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,166
IF I WERE YOU,
I WOULDN'T ATTEMPT

299
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,458
ANOTHER FULL-BODY TAKEOVER.

300
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,166
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED

301
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,166
THE LAST TIME YOU TRIED?

302
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,708
YOU LOST CONROL...

303
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:34,958
- Sol and Lisanna:
BIG BROTHER ELF.

304
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,916
- Lisanna:
IT WAS ALL YOUR FAULT.

305
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,625
HOW COULD YOU FORGET?
I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME.

306
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:42,083
PLEASE, DON'T HURT ME.
I ONLY WANT TO HELP YOU.

307
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,291
NO! DON'T DO IT!
( echoes )

308
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,958
- ( speaks French )

309
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,708
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T ATTEMPT
TO DO SOMETHING

310
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,750
YOU KNOW YOU'RE INCAPABLE OF.

311
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:53,333
ALL YOU'VE DONE IS WASTED
YOUR MAGIC ENERGY.

312
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,291
- YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A COWARD.

313
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,916
A REAL MAN WOULD FIGHT ME

314
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,541
INSTEAD OF
MESSING WITH MY HEAD!

315
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:01,041
- ARE YOU INSINUATING
I'M NOT A "REAL MAN"?

316
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,750
<i>NON, NON, NON.</i>

317
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,875
HOW DARE YOU
INSULT ME LIKE THAT.

318
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,250
( speaks French )

319
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,500
WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT
TO TELL ME

320
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,291
HOW A "REAL MAN"
SHOULD BEHAVE?

321
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,000
YOU'RE NOT A MAN.
YOU'RE A MONSTER 

322
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,791
WHO MURDERED
HIS LITTLE SISTER.

323
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,791
( speaks French )

324
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,666
- ( gasps )

325
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,375
ELFMAN, NO!

326
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,458
ELFMAN!

327
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,333
- BIG SIS?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

328
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:34,125
HOW DID THEY
GET AHOLD OF YOU?!

329
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,916
MIRA!

330
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,916
- OH, THAT'S YOUR OLDER SISTER.

331
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,083
MADEMOISELLE MIRAJANE,

332
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,250
ALSO KNOWN AS
"THE SHE DEVIL."

333
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,250
QUITE FEARSOME ONCE,

334
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:49,041
BUT NOW HOLDS A MERE FRACTION
OF THE POWER SHE ONCE HAD.

335
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,000
( speaks French )

336
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,500
SHE'S BEING PUNISHED FOR
TRYING TO DECEIVE MASTER JOSE.

337
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,291
( speaks French )

338
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,000
...BUT IT WON'T BE LONG

339
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,291
BEFORE SHE'S
CRUSHED TO DEATH.

340
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,916
- RUN! GET OUT OF HERE!

341
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,583
- NO, I CAN'T LEAVE YOU!

342
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,416
- YOU KILLED LISANNA.

343
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,916
AND NOW MIRAJANE WILL DIE
BEFORE YOUR EYES.

344
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,166
IMPOSTER, YOUR MANLY IMAGE

345
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,291
IS JUST A FACADE
HIDING THE WEAK,

346
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:17,083
POWERLESS WIZARD
YOU REALLY ARE.

347
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:20,750
A REAL MAN WOULD NEVER LET THAT
HAPPEN TO SUCH FAIR CREATURES.

348
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,875
FOR THAT CRIME, YOU SHALL
RECEIVE ETERNAL TORMENT. 

349
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,791
- ( screams )
- SEALING MAGIC:

350
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,291
( speaks French )

351
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,916
YOU WILL BECOME
PART OF THE EARTH

352
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,333
AND RELIVE YOUR PAINFUL MEMORIES
OVER AND OVER AGAIN...

353
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,541
( speaks French )

354
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,541
- NO!

355
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,750
STOP IT!

356
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:48,791
- ( child crying )

357
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,291
- I KNOW THIS PLACE.

358
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:53,125
THAT'S ME.

359
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,916
- Lisanna:
BIG BROTHER ELF!

360
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,958
( panting )

361
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,833
- IT'S YOU.  HEY.

362
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,541
LISANNA, I--

363
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,833
- COME ON,
PLEASE TRY TO CHEER UP.

364
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,500
- NO, I CAN'T.

365
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,250
MY PARAKEET'S DEAD AND
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

366
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,083
- IT'S NOT.

367
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,125
YOU HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

368
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,166
EVEN THOUGH
IT MAKES US SAD,

369
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,083
ALL LIVING THINGS
HAVE TO DIE EVENTUALLY.

370
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:22,500
- REALLY?
EVERYTHING HAS TO DIE?

371
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,083
- IT'S SAD, BUT THAT'S
JUST THE WAY LIFE WORKS.

372
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:29,500
DON'T WORRY, YOUR FRIEND
WILL ALWAYS BE WITH YOU.

373
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,333
HE'LL LIVE ON IN YOUR HEART

374
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,083
FOR AS LONG AS YOU
CAN REMEMBER HIM.

375
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,416
- Young and Present Elf: 
LIVE ON IN MY HEART?

376
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,000
- SHUT UP!

377
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,916
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW I FEEL.
- NO, DON'T GO!

378
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,166
- ( sniffles )

379
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,666
( cries )

380
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,250
- UH, DON'T CRY, LISANNA.

381
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,333
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS SAYING.

382
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:52,958
- ( crying continues )

383
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,916
- GEEZ.

384
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,333
- MIRA.

385
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,791
- DON'T TELL ME YOU TWO
ARE FIGHTING AGAIN?

386
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:03,250
- OH, HEY, LISANNA.
- NATSU ATE MY WHOLE FISH.

387
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,041
AND HE DIDN'T
EVEN ASK ME FIRST.

388
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,458
- WHENEVER I EAT ANY FISH--
- HOLD ON.

389
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,458
THIS IS THE DAY THAT...

390
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,416
COME ON, LISANNA.

391
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,708
LET'S GO.
WE GOT TO GET TO WORK.

392
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,583
- WHAT? WE JUST FINISHED A JOB.

393
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,250
CAN'T WE TAKE A LITTLE BREAK?

394
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,208
- YEAH, BUT IT'S 
AN S-CLASS QUEST.

395
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:21,208
MIRAJANE WANTS US TO GO ALONG
AND HELP HER OUT WITH IT.

396
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:24,875
- NO WAY! TOTALLY UNFAIR!
- WHAT KIND OF JOB IS IT?

397
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,375
- AN EMERGENCY REQUEST.

398
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,791
IT JUST CAME IN.

399
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,333
THEY WANT US TO KILL OFF
THIS MONSTER

400
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,750
CALLED THE BEAST.

401
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,375
HEY, YOU WANT TO
COME WITH US, NATSU?

402
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,083
YOU MIGHT LEARN
A THING OR TWO.

403
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,666
- DO WHAT?!
I DON'T WANT HIM TAGGING ALONG.

404
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,500
I'M THE MAN IN THIS FAMILY
AND I CAN PROTECT YOU ON MY OWN!

405
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,250
- OH! WHY YOU GOT TO HOG
ALL THE FUN?!

406
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,333
TAKE ME WITH YOU!
- NO!

407
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,250
YOU CAN'T GO!
YOU'RE NOT READY YET!

408
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,666
AT LEAST TAKE
NATSU WITH YOU!

409
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,708
( gasping )

410
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,125
- ELFMAN, PULL
YOURSELF TOGETHER!

411
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,583
YOU GOT TO
SNAP OUT OF IT!

412
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,833
PLEASE!

413
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,666
ELFMAN!

414
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,625
- ( growling )

415
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:18,083
- ( gasps )
THAT MONSTER IS ME.

416
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,500
- ( growling )

417
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,500
- Mirajane: ELFMAN,
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER!

418
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,458
- MIRA!

419
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,125
I HAD EVERYONE IN TOWN EVACUATE.

420
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,125
NOW LET ME HELP YOU.
- YOU HAVE TO RUN, LISANNA.

421
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,916
IT'S DANGEROUS.

422
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,500
I WAS GETTING BEAT UP
PRETTY BAD,

423
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,083
SO ELFMAN TRIED TO TAKE OVER
THE BEAST TO PROTECT ME.

424
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,833
- OH MY GOSH, THAT'S HIM?

425
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,583
- IT ALMOST WORKED.

426
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,458
BUT THE BEAST WAS
TOO POWERFUL FOR HIM.

427
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,416
NOW HE'S TOTALLY
LOST CONTROL.

428
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,458
- OH NO.

429
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,041
WHAT DO WE DO?

430
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,583
HOW CAN WE SAVE HIM?

431
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,291
- WE HAVE TO GET HIM 
TO COME TO HIS SENSES

432
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,208
BEFORE THE BEAST COMPLETELY
TAKES OVER HIS SOUL.

433
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,208
- ( growls )

434
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,958
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
COME BACK HERE!

435
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,875
- BIG BROTHER ELF?
ARE YOU FEELING OKAY?

436
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,583
IT'S ME, LISANNA,
YOUR LITTLE SISTER.

437
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:10,250
OUR BIG SISTER MIRA
IS HERE TOO.

438
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,666
WE'RE A FAMILY AND
WHEN TIMES ARE TOUGH,

439
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,625
WE PULL TOGETHER
AND WORK THINGS OUT.

440
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,583
SO WHY DON'T
THE THREE OF US GO HOME

441
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,041
AND TALK ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?

442
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,833
I PROMISE WE'RE
NOT MAD AT YOU.

443
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,083
- IT'S NO USE.

444
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,625
DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.

445
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,083
JUST RUN!

446
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:32,375
- COME ON, DON'T BE AFRAID,
BIG BROTHER.

447
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,958
WE STILL LOVE YOU.

448
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,291
- ( silent )

449
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,833
- ( crying )

450
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,500
I'M SO SORRY.

451
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,916
IT'S MY FAULT THAT
LISANNA'S DEAD.

452
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,625
- NO, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

453
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,333
REMEMBER WHAT SHE TOLD YOU?

454
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,958
EVEN THOUGH IT MAKES US SAD,

455
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,583
ALL LIVING THINGS
HAVE TO DIE EVENTUALLY.

456
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,375
- YOU WERE THERE THAT DAY?

457
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,833
- LISANNA WILL
CONTINUE TO LIVE ON

458
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:24,666
INSIDE OUR HEARTS AS LONG
AS WE REMEMBER HER.

459
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,666
- WE WILL.

460
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,166
- FROM NOW ON,
WE'LL LIVE LIFE FOR HER

461
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,625
AND PROMISE
WE WILL NEVER FORGET.

462
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:40,833
- I'LL NEVER FORGET.

463
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,375
- Mirajane: ELFMAN!

464
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,208
YOU GOT TO SNAP OUT OF IT!

465
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:48,625
PLEASE, BROTHER,
I CAN'T LOSE YOU TOO!

466
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:52,250
- NOW IT'S TIME FOR
 THE <i>COUP DE GRACE.</i>

467
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,666
- Elfman:
SHE'S CRYING.

468
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,208
- UGH, WHAT NOW?

469
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,125
- I SWORE
I WOULD NEVER LET

470
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,250
ANYONE MAKE YOU CRY AGAIN.

471
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:02,916
TELL ME!
WHY ARE YOU CRYING?

472
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,625
- THAT LIGHT!

473
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:07,500
NO, DON'T DO IT, ELFMAN!
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS!

474
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:10,250
- WHO MADE YOU CRY, MIRA?!

475
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,833
- IMBECILE, YOU'RE NOT
STRONG ENOUGH

476
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,000
TO PERFORM
A FULL-BODY TAKEOVER.

477
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:17,958
- ( growling )

478
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:20,875
- <i>MON DIEU!</i>

479
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:23,041
- ( growling )

480
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,166
- ( whimpers )

481
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:29,375
- ( speaks French )
HE DID IT!

482
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,666
- THE FULL-BODY TAKEOVER!

483
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,166
BEAST SOUL!

484
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,625
- ( growling )

485
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,750
- ( singing in Japanese )

486
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:14,500
- HEY IS IT JUST ME

487
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,458
OR DOES IT SEEM
LIKE IT'S RAINING INSIDE?

488
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,750
- AYE, IT'S 'CAUSE OUR
GUILD HALL'S FULL OF HOLES

489
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,583
RIGHT NOW THANKS
TO PHANTOM'S ATTACKS.

490
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,625
SO WHEN IT'S A RAINY DAY
LIKE TODAY,

491
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,291
WE END UP WITH A FEW LEAKS.

492
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,041
- IT'S WAY MORE
THAN JUST A FEW LEAKS.

493
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:27,791
IT'S LIKE FULL-ON RAIN IN HERE.

494
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:30,250
- KIND OF GIVES THE PLACE
AN ABANDONED-RUINS VIBE, HUH?

495
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:32,958
- Both: NEXT TIME...

496
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:34,625
- Natsu: WE'D BETTER START
PATCHING THE ROOF

497
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,166
BEFORE SOMEONE CATCHES A COLD.

498
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,500
- Happy: OH, COME ON,
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

499
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:38,833
IT'S LIKE A BIG SHOWER.

500
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:40,083
- MAN, YOU TAKE
POSITIVE THINKING

501
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:41,458
TO THE EXTREME.
