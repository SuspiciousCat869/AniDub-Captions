- Nichiya: MY ROYAL GUARD
WAS HEROICALLY PURSUING

27
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:04,958
TWO FALLEN EXCEEDS OVER
THE CASTLE WALLS OF EDOLAS.

28
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,958
SUDDENLY, THE HUMANS, REEKING
OF THEIR MALODOROUS PARFUM,

29
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:12,041
DARED TO STRIKE OUT
IN DEFIANCE OF OUR QUEEN.

30
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:15,708
IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE, THE
ENTIRE REGIMENT WAS TRANSFORMED

31
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,333
INTO A GIANT LACRIMA.

32
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,583
WE PLUMMETED TO THE GROUND
AND WERE CAPTURED.

33
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,916
IT APPEARS KING FAUST OF EDOLAS
INTENDS TO HARNESS THE POWER

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,916
OF THE DRAGON SLAYERS AND LAUNCH
A FULL-SCALE ATTACK

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,041
ON OUR HOMELAND EXTALIA.

36
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,875
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE.

37
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:32,125
I CANNOT LET
THIS AGGRESSION STAND.

38
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:36,125
BUT RIGHT NOW I'M TRAPPED
INSIDE THIS THING.

39
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:40,541
I NEED SOMEONE TO FREE ME.
PLEASE HELP!

- THE EXCEEDS TOTAL DESTRUCTION,
CODE ETD FOR SHORT,

A PLAN TO LIBERATE THEMSELVES
FROM THESE SO-CALLED "ANGELS."

42
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,083
I WAS AFRAID IT WOULD COME
TO THIS SOMEDAY.

43
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:56,208
FOR NOW, I'LL TRY
TO PASS THE WORD ALONG.

44
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:01,583
- Woman: GREAT PEOPLE OF EDOLAS,
HELLO, AND WELCOME TO "E" LAND.

45
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:04,000
WE HOPE YOU'LL HAVE THE TIME
OF YOUR LIVES HERE TODAY.

WHETHER YOU RIDE THE DEATH
DEFYING HELL COASTER

47

OR BRAVE TO ENTER
THE MONSTER ACADEMY,

WE KNOW YOUR STAY HERE WILL
BE AN UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE.

49

KING FAUST HAS DESIGNED THIS
PARK HIMSELF TO THRILL YOU

50
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,291
AND TO SHOWCASE WHAT UNLIMITED
MAGIC POWER CAN DO.

51
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,666
- ( panting )
- NO!

52
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,375
- COCO, COME BACK HERE.

53
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:26,041
I SHALL WARN YOU
JUST ONE MORE TIME.

54
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,666
HAND OVER THE KEY
OR YOU'LL REGRET IT.

55
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,041
- LIKE I'D LET YOU LAY
A FINGER ON 'EM.

56
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,375
RELAX
I WON'T LET HIM HURT US.

57
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:43,416
- ( Happy speaking )

58
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,125
- YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE MEDDLING
WIZARDS FROM EARTH LAND,

59
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:49,416
AREN'T YOU?
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?

60
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,166
AND WHAT HAS BECOME
OF HUGHES AND SUGARBOY?

61
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,041
- I'M PRETTY SURE NATSU
CAN HANDLE HIMSELF,

62
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:58,208
BUT THIS GIRL DEFINITELY
NEEDS MY HELP.

63
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:01,041
AND WHY DOES THIS GUY
WANT ONE OF MY KEYS?

64
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:04,375
- I DEMAND YOU HAND OVER
THE KEY IMMEDIATELY.

65
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,541
- AWW, MAN, I'VE RUN INTO
A LOT OF CREEPS IN MY DAY,

66
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,250
BUT THIS GUY TAKES THE CAKE.

67
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,083
I'LL LET YOU HAVE SOMETHING,
ALL RIGHT.

68
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,666
- SAY WHAT?

69
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,083
- I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE,
BUT I DON'T THINK SHE GETS IT.

70
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,708
- ( roars )

71
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,208
TAKE THIS.

72
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,125
- THIS GUY'S DEFINITELY
GOT US ON THE ROPES.

73
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,791
I HOPE YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF
PLAN TO TURN THINGS AROUND.

74
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:38,291
- YEAH, I'M JUST HAVING A LITTLE
BIT OF FUN WITH HIM FIRST.

75
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,958
- YOU'D BE WISE
TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.

76
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,083
- ( grunting )
- ( screaming )

77
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,958
- ( groaning )

78
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,166
- TAKE YOUR EYES OFF ME 
FOR A SECOND,

79
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,041
IT COULD BE YOUR LAST MISTAKE.
- DON'T GET ME WRONG.

80
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,583
I'M TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY,
JUST ENJOYING FIGHTING

81
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,250
A REAL OPPONENT FOR ONCE.

82
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,125
- DID YOU REALLY HAVE
TO THROW ME LIKE THAT?

83
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,375
I'M NOT SOME RAG DOLL
YOU CAN JUST TOSS AROUND.

84
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,833
- I JUST SAVED YOUR LOUSY HIDE
AND YOU'RE GONNA COMPLAIN?

85
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,708
DON'T TEST ME, CAT.

86
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,166
I MAY HAVE TO TAKE YOU OUT
BEFORE THE BIG GUY HERE.

87
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,166
SO WATCH YOUR MOUTH.
- MAN, I SWEAR,

88
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,125
I HAVE THE SCARIEST
FRIENDS SOMETIMES.

89
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,833
- WHAT DO YOU SAY WE
CUT ALL THE COMEDY?

90
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,000
IT'S TIME TO GET DOWN
TO THE ACTION.

91
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,250
- GIVE ME EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT,
FILTHY EARTH LANDER.

92
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,750
- AFTER SEEING WHAT
WE'VE RUN INTO,

93
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,708
I'M WAY MORE WORRIED
ABOUT EVERYBODY ELSE.

94
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,541
- NOW OPEN,
GATE OF THE GOLDEN BULL.

95
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,208
TAURUS!

96
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,416
- ( roars )

97
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:39,458
NICE OUTFIT, MISS LUCY.
I GOTTA SAY I APPROVE.

98
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,041
- CAN'T YOU JUST COME THROUGH
WITHOUT COMING ON?

99
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:44,583
- WHAT IN BLAZES IS THAT?
A MAGIC COW?

100
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,125
- THE MAGIC FROM EARTH LAND
IS INCREDIBLE,

101
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:50,208
BUT HE SEEMS A LITTLE NAUGHTY.

102
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,750
- IF I DO THIS FOR YOU, WILL YOU
FINALLY GIVE ME THAT SMOOCH?

103
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,416
- MAKE HIM SEE STARS AND I'LL
AT LEAST THINK ABOUT IT.

104
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,791
NOW MOVE!
- STARS COMING RIGHT UP.

105
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,541
- THAT'S MY TAURUS.

106
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,583
- WELL, THIS AIN'T
MY FIRST RODEO.

107
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,708
- I CAN'T BELIEVE MY EYES

108
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:13,875
SHE PRODUCED THAT BOVINE BEAST
OUT OF THIN AIR.

109
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,708
HOW?
HOW CAN SHE DO THAT?

110
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:20,291
- NOW LIGHTS OUT.
- LIGHTS ON.

111
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:24,416
- ( screaming )

112
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,833
- FLAME LIQUID!
- NO, TAURUS.

113
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,458
THAT FIRE,
WHERE DID IT COME FROM?

114
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,291
- WATCH OUT, HE'S DANGEROUS.

115
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,541
- THAT'S MY CUE TO VAMOOSE.

116
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,583
- ( screams )

117
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,458
- STORM LIQUID.

118
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,958
- OKAY.

119
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,500
OPEN GATE OF THE MAIDEN.

120
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,250
VIRGO!

121
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,916
- ANOTHER CREATURE
OUT OF NOWHERE?

122
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,958
COULD SHE BE USING A SPELL
SIMILAR TO ANIMA?

123
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,583
- PUNISHMENT TIME.
- SAY WHAT?

124
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,250
- SPICA HOLE!
- ( screaming )

125
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,458
- OH, YEAH!
- SHE'S SO COOL.  WOW!

126
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,166
- WILL YOU PUNISH ME NOW,
PRINCESS?

127
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,625
- YOU ARE TOO WEIRD.
- WOW, SHE'S A PRINCESS, TOO?

128
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,375
MAYBE I SHOULD GIVE HER
THE KEY AFTER ALL.

129
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:22,958
I MEAN, I'D LOVE TO HAVE
ALL THAT MAGIC POWER,

130
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,541
BUT I KNOW THAT
IF THE KING GETS IT,

131
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,041
HE'S GONNA HURT LILY.

132
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:30,083
THIS IS HARD.
- ( loud rumbling )

133
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,291
- WHAT'S ALL THAT NOISE?

134
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,541
- IT'S PROBABLY JUST YOUR TUMMY.
HUNGRY?

135
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,291
- WAY OFF BASE.
- AM I IN TROUBLE?

136
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,708
- ( screams )

137
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,625
- YOU CAN'T RUN NOW, COCO.

138
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,666
( snickering )

139
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,333
- WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?
- LOOKS LIKE A GIANT OCTOPUS.

140
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:56,708
- YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT, THANKS.
- YOU ARE CORRECT.

141
00:07:56,791 --> 00:08:00,416
I'VE INGESTED OCTOPUS LIQUID.

142
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,375
YES, GO ON AND SCREAM
ALL YOU LIKE.

143
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,833
NO AMOUNT OF THAT STRANGE

144
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,750
OTHERWORLD MAGIC WILL BE ABLE
TO SAVE YOU NOW.

145
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,625
- HE'S WRONG, ISN'T HE?

146
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,250
- SORRY, BUT I FEAR
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

147
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,916
- ARE YOU SERIOUSLY JUST GONNA
GIVE UP LIKE THAT?

148
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,708
- ( screams )

149
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,666
- I MAY HAVE COCO,
BUT I WON'T BE TRULY SATISFIED

150
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,250
UNTIL I DISPOSE OF YOU
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

151
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,791
- THAT'S A LITTLE MUCH.

152
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,625
- YOU ALWAYS HAVE SUCH BAD LUCK
WITH MEN.

153
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,541
- YOU CALL THAT A MAN?

154
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:34,958
- ( laughs )

155
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:39,875
- VIRGO, PLEASE.
YOU GOTTA GET ME DOWN FROM HERE.

156
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,125
- PRINCESS, CATCH.

157
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:47,000
- YOU ALMOST TOOK MY HEAD OFF
WITH THAT THING.  WHAT IS IT?

158
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,833
- IT'S AN EXTENDABLE WHIP
FROM THE CELESTIAL WORLD.

159
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:53,041
THE ERIDANUS CONSTELLATION'S
FLEUVE D'ÉTOILES.

160
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,833
- FROM THE RIVER OF THE STARS?

161
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,958
- YOU CAN USE IT IF YOU LIKE,
PRINCESS,

162
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,791
BUT I DOUBT IT WILL
BE MUCH HELP.

163
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,958
- THINK YOU COULD TRY TO LOOK ON
THE BRIGHT SIDE ONCE IN A WHILE?

164
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,208
RIGHT NOW,
IT'S THE ONLY HOPE I'VE GOT.

165
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:08,416
- COME CLOSER.
WE CAN END THIS QUICKLY.

166
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,208
- GOODBYE AND BEST OF LUCK
TO YOU, PRINCESS.

167
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,875
- HERE WE GO.

168
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,666
- MORE STRANGE MAGIC?

169
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,541
I'M AFRAID IT WON'T HELP
YOU THE SLIGHTEST BIT.

170
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:27,208
- ( screams )

171
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:30,291
- AS I THOUGHT,
COMPLETELY HELPLESS.

172
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:33,083
IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRADE LASHES,
I'D BE HAPPY TO OBLIGE.

173
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,541
I'M CONFUSED,
EARTH LAND WIZARD.

174
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:43,416
EARLIER YOU HAD SAID YOU
WOULD "TAKE CARE" OF ME.

175
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,125
IS THIS HOW YOU INTENDED
TO MAKE GOOD ON YOUR WORD?

176
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:49,333
- AW, MAN, VIRGO WAS RIGHT.
THIS WHIP ISN'T DOING ANYTHING.

177
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:52,875
- WHAT'S WRONG?  HAS YOUR
BIZARRE MAGIC FROM YOUR REALM

178
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,375
FAILED YOU?
- MY MAGIC.

179
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,291
WHENEVER I CALL
MULTIPLE SPIRITS,

180
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:03,625
IT TOTALLY DRAINS
MY MAGICAL POWER, ALL OF IT.

181
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:07,666
THAT'S WHY SHE GAVE THIS TO ME.

182
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,833
THANK YOU.

183
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,958
I LOVE KNOWING THAT
MY SPIRITS CARE FOR ME.

184
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:19,083
IT FILLS ME WITH STRENGTH.

185
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:22,458
- I HOPE YOU'VE MADE YOUR PEACE,
WIZARD.

186
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:26,333
- ALL RIGHT, SHE CALLED THIS
AN "EXTENDABLE" WHIP, RIGHT?

187
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,291
( screams )

188
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,750
- WHAT'S THIS?

189
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:41,041
- GET YOUR TENTACLES OFF OF HER.
- WHY SHOULD I?

190
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,625
SHE'S PART OF OUR ARMY
AND THEREFORE YOUR ENEMY.

191
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,916
HER FATE SHOULD BE OF NO CONCERN
TO YOU, EARTH LANDER.

192
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,500
- CAN'T YOU SEE SHE'S IN PAIN?

193
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,625
- OH, THIS IS JUST A TASTE
OF WHAT'S TO COME.

194
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,083
- ( screams )

195
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,958
- THAT DOES IT.

196
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:58,708
- STOP SCURRYING AROUND ON ME
LIKE SOME KIND OF PARASITE.

197
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,208
- I HAVE TO CARE ABOUT HER,
BECAUSE IT'S OBVIOUS YOU DON'T.

198
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,958
AND IF YOU FEEL THAT WAY
ABOUT YOUR OWN COMRADE,

199
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,416
I CAN'T LET YOU WIN.

200
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,125
- MY ARMS!

201
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:14,416
SHE'S COMPLETELY TIED ME UP.

202
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:20,583
- BECAUSE I'M A MEMBER
OF FAIRY TAIL.

203
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:24,958
- HOW DARE YOU LECTURE ME?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

204
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,583
WHERE IS ALL THIS HEAT
COMING FROM?

205
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,416
( screaming )

206
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,416
- SO YOU THINK I'M A MONSTER,
HUH?

207
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,625
WELL, YOU AIN'T
SEEN NOTHING YET, PAL.

208
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,375
- NATSU.

209
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,708
- ( gasps )

210
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,791
THEY TOOK DOWN HUGHES
AND BYRO?

211
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,666
- ( laughs )

212
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,666
- WHOA!  WHAT THE HECK
IS THIS HUGE BLOB?

213
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,666
- YOU ALWAYS KNOW HOW
TO MAKE AN ENTRANCE.

214
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,583
HEY, WHO'S THAT
ON THE GROUND THERE?

215
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,500
- I HOPE SHE'S OKAY.
- DO YOU KNOW THIS GIRL?

216
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,708
- I CAN'T SAY I REALLY KNOW HER.
- ( sobbing )

217
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,375
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- SERIOUSLY, ARE YOU OKAY?

218
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,625
- DOES YOUR TUMMY HURT?
- I DON'T THINK THAT'S IT.

219
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,750
- THIS KEY IS WHAT HE WANTED

220
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,875
IT'LL TURN ON A MACHINE THAT
WILL KILL ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS.

221
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,500
- WHAT'D YOU SAY?
- ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT

222
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,500
THE THING THAT'S GONNA MAKE THAT
HUGE LACRIMA CRASH INTO EXTALIA?

223
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,666
WHAT ARE YOU DOING RUNNING
AROUND THE CASTLE WITH IT?

224
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,625
- THEY SAID WE COULD HAVE
EVERLASTING POWER,

225
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:53,083
BUT I DECIDED I WANTED
EVERLASTING PEACE INSTEAD.

226
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,333
SO PLEASE.

227
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:58,291
PLEASE HELP ME DESTROY IT
FOR GOOD.

228
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:02,250
I'M BEGGING YOU.

229
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,833
SO YOU'RE SAYING ALL WE HAVE
TO DO TO STOP THEM

230
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,333
FROM SMASHING THAT LACRIMA
IS DESTROY THIS KEY?

231
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:11,291
THAT'S AMAZING.
- ALL RIGHT, I GOT THIS.

232
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,708
- HUH?
- WHAT THE--

233
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,000
- STOP RIGHT THERE, COCO.

234
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,416
EVEN YOU HAVE BETTER SENSE THAN
TO HAND SOMETHING THIS IMPORTANT

235
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,208
TO AN ENEMY OF THE KINGDOM.
THIS KEY BELONGS TO HIS MAJESTY.

236
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:25,583
- SUGARBOY!
- HE TOOK IT.

237
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,000
- OH, NO.
- GIVE IT BACK.

238
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:31,708
- STOP RIGHT THERE.
YOU HEAR ME?

239
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,666
- OF COURSE I HEAR YOU.
I JUST DON'T CARE.

240
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,416
- YOU'RE ONLY GONNA
MAKE THIS WORSE.

241
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,625
- GRAY!
- LISTEN UP, YOU GUYS.

242
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,125
THERE'S NO NEED FOR YOU TO WORRY
ABOUT MISTER BIG CHIN HERE.

243
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,625
THIS ONE'S ALL MINE.

244
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,958
EVERYTHING ELSE IS UP TO YOU.

245
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,000
- YOU'RE LIKE A PERSISTENT RASH.

246
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,375
YOU JUST KEEP ON COMING BACK,
DON'T YOU?

247
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,041
- COME ON AND SAY THAT
TO MY FACE, MAN.

248
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,833
- I NEED TO DEAL
WITH YOU QUICKLY

249
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,416
WITH MY ROSA ESPADA.

250
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,250
- WE GOTTA TRY AND CATCH UP
TO HIM, TOO.

251
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,083
- WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO GET THAT KEY BACK.  OH!

252
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,708
- NOW WHAT?
- THIS STUFF AGAIN?

253
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,916
I'M SICK OF GETTING STUCK
IN THIS STUFF.

254
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,333
- THIS SUCKS.
I CAN'T MOVE MY LEGS.

255
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:17,833
LUCY, GET US OUT OF HERE.
- I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

256
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:21,500
COME ON, FLEUVE D'ÉTOILES.
UH-OH!

257
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,500
WE'RE STUCK HERE.

258
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,083
THIS HUGE OCTOPUS
GUY'S CRUSHING US.

259
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,458
HE'S SUPER ICKY.

260
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:32,000
- ( screaming )

261
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,958
- ATTENTION, GUESTS, E LAND'S
ATTRACTIONS ARE NOW CLOSED.

262
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:39,000
THANK YOU FOR COMING AND WE HOPE
YOU'LL BE BACK AGAIN SOON.

263
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:43,625
- ( laughing )

264
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,166
- I SAID, STOP.

265
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,291
HOW IN THE HECK ARE YOU
EVEN ABLE TO KEEP SLIDING

266
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,416
ACROSS THE FLOOR LIKE THAT?

267
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,083
- I JUST DO IT, MAN.

268
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,666
- UH, OKAY.

269
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,125
THEN TELL ME WHAT THAT KEY
IS FOR INSTEAD.

270
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,541
- IT ACTIVATES THE
DRAGON CHAIN CANNON.

271
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:00,666
- WHAT IS THAT?

272
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,458
- SORRY.
THE REST IS CLASSIFIED.

273
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:06,666
- JUDGING BY THE NAME, I BET
IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH

274
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,375
THE DRAGON SLAYER MAGIC THEY
SUCKED OUT OF NATSU AND WENDY.

275
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,833
WHEN I SAW HER EARLIER,
I'M PRETTY SURE SHE SAID

276
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,708
THE ROYAL ARMY HAD PLANNED
TO HIT THAT FLOATING LACRIMA

277
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,125
AND THAT WOULD FORCE IT
INTO COLLIDING WITH EXTALIA,

278
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:22,041
DESTROYING BOTH OF THEM
OR SOMETHING CRAZY LIKE THAT.

279
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:25,208
- ALL YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW
IS THAT I CAN'T LET YOU HAVE IT.

280
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,583
IT BELONGS TO THE KINGDOM.
- SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS,

281
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,416
I CAN'T LET YOU GET AWAY
WITH IT, EITHER.

282
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,708
ICE MAKE FLOOR.

283
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:37,000
- IS AN ICY FLOOR TRULY THE BEST
YOU CAN COME UP WITH?

284
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,291
I CAN MAKE ANYTHING SOFTER

285
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,083
WITH MY ROSA ESPADA.

286
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,125
HUH?

287
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,708
- YOU CAN MAKE IT JUST AS
SOFT AS YOU WANT, BUDDY.

288
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:52,000
IT'S STILL GONNA BE TOO SLIPPERY
FOR YOU TO CONTROL YOURSELF.

289
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,041
- I'LL SHOW YOU AGAIN.

290
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,833
THE KEY!
- NOW SHATTER.

291
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:23,041
WHAT GIVES?
- HMM.

292
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:26,750
- I'LL ADMIT, THIS IS COLD.
NICE TRY, ICE BOY.

293
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,583
- I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE
CALL ME THAT.

294
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,541
BUT SERIOUSLY, THOUGH,
WHY ISN'T THIS THING CRACKING?

295
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,291
- GET REAL, CHUMP.

296
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,333
THIS ISN'T SOME FLIMSY
PIECE OF JUNK, YOU KNOW?

297
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,833
BUT IT IS VERY COLD.

298
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:42,000
NOW I'M NOT PARTICULARLY FOND
OF HOLDING HANDS WITH OTHER MEN

299
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,166
AT LENGTH, SO WOULD
YOU MIND LETTING GO?

300
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,125
- SPEAKING OF HANDS,

301
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:50,458
HAVEN'T YOU REALIZED THAT I HAVE
THE UPPER ONE RIGHT ABOUT NOW?

302
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,291
- HMM, WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY THAT, ICE BOY?

303
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:56,500
- WOULD YOU STOP CALLING ME
THAT ALREADY?  LISTEN, PAL.

304
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,625
THE WAY I SEE IT IS, ALTHOUGH
YOUR PEOPLE NEED THIS KEY,

305
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:03,625
ME AND ALL
MY GUILD MATES DON'T.

306
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,291
IF I CAN'T BREAK IT,
I'LL JUST MAKE IT UNUSABLE.

307
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,750
- HUH?
- ( laughs ) NOW FREEZE!

308
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,166
DON'T FORGET.
IT MAY IN FACT FREEZE,

309
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,041
BUT MY ROSA ESPADA CAN SOFTEN
ANYTHING IT TOUCHES.

310
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,416
DON'T BE SO SURE.

311
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,541
ONE WRONG MOVE AND YOU'LL TURN
THIS KEY OF YOURS

312
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,916
INTO A PRETZEL.

313
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,333
- WELL, FINELY TUNED
IS MY MIDDLE NAME.

314
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,833
- WHAT THE HECK IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

315
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,458
- PRECISION.

316
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,541
I SHALL SIMPLY HAVE TO
CUT YOU AWAY.

317
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,750
YOUR ICE WON'T HELP YOU NOW.

318
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:50,166
- SO YOU WANT TO FIGHT, HUH?
( grunts )

319
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,083
I'LL JUST GO AHEAD
AND FREEZE YOU ALONG WITH IT,

320
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,125
BUT I'M NEVER GONNA LET IT GO.

321
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,333
- ( growling )

322
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,875
NOT WITHOUT YOUR ARMS, PUNK.
- ( shouting )

323
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,666
- LET GO NOW.

324
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,833
- COME ON, FREEZE.

325
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:41,666
- WHAT THE-- NO WAY!
YOU CRACKED THE KEY.

326
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,833
- YEAH, YOU BET I DID.  NOW
WATCH IT SHATTER INTO PIECES.

327
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,541
- STOP IT RIGHT NOW.

328
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,375
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA BREAK IT.

329
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,208
- I'LL DO WHAT IT TAKES
TO SAVE MY FRIENDS' LIVES.

330
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,041
HERE GOES.
I CAN FEEL IT HAPPENING.

331
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,125
- WAIT.

332
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,791
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

333
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,333
YOU AND YOUR MEN NEED IT.

334
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:03,250
YOU NEED IT
JUST AS MUCH AS WE DO.

335
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,958
LET'S JUST CALL A QUICK TRUCE
FOR NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

336
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,000
- WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

337
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:16,125
- WHY?
BECAUSE YOU NEED IT, TOO.

338
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,833
IT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT
YOU'LL EVER BE ABLE

339
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,416
TO TURN YOUR FRIENDS BACK
TO NORMAL.

340
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,541
- OH, IS THAT SO?

341
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:26,666
YOU'RE FULL OF CRAP.
- IT'S THE TRUTH.

342
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,041
THE DRAGON CHAIN CANNON FIRES
CONDENSED DRAGON SLAYER MAGIC.

343
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,791
IF YOU KNEW WHAT THAT KIND OF
MAGIC COULD DO IN OUR WORLD,

344
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,916
YOU'D SEE WHY
YOU NEEDED THAT KEY.

345
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,583
- ( gasps )

346
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,875
- Gajeel: I WAS ABLE
TO SHATTER THE LACRIMA

347
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,833
BY USING
MY DRAGON SLAYER MAGIC.

348
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:46,083
WHEN I DID THAT, IT TURNED
YOU TWO BACK TO NORMAL,

349
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:50,625
'CAUSE THAT'S HOW IT WORKS
IN THIS CRAZY WORLD WE'RE IN.

350
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,333
- BLAST THAT LACRIMA
WITH THE DRAGON CHAIN CANNON

351
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:58,166
AND YOU'LL TURN ALL YOUR LITTLE
FRIENDS BACK TO HOW THEY WERE.

352
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,333
DO YOU FINALLY GET IT NOW?

353
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:05,333
THAT'S WHY NEITHER OF US CAN
AFFORD TO LET THIS KEY BREAK.

354
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,166
YOU MAY NEED IT MORE THAN I DO.

355
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,166
- YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

356
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,208
WE HAVE THREE DRAGON SLAYERS
IN OUR GUILD.

357
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:16,291
WHY THE HECK WOULD WE NEED
TO USE SOME STUPID CANNON

358
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,375
WHEN WE GOT THE REAL THING?

359
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,791
SO SORRY ABOUT YOUR KEY,
BUT IT'S HISTORY.

360
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,958
- BY THE TIME IT WOULD TAKE THEM
TO SHATTER THAT LACRIMA,

361
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:26,083
IT'LL BE TOO LATE.
AS EARLY AS TOMORROW,

362
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:29,458
IT WILL BEGIN TRANSFORMING
INTO PURE MAGIC POWER.

363
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:33,666
OUR PLAN WAS TO DRIVE IT INTO
EXTALIA BEFORE THAT HAPPENED.

364
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,166
YEAH, WITH THREE DRAGON SLAYERS
YOU COULD PROBABLY SAVE

365
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,125
A FEW MORE OF YOUR FRIENDS,

366
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,875
BUT THERE IS NO WAY YOU COULD
SAVE ALL OF THEM.

367
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:45,375
IN FACT,
MOST OF THEM WILL NOT SURVIVE.

368
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,083
AND WHAT'S MORE,
NEITHER WILL THOSE SCORES

369
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,458
OF INNOCENT CIVILIANS THAT
THE ANIMA ABSORBED ALONG

370
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,666
WITH YOUR PRECIOUS GUILD MATES.
WHAT ABOUT THEM?

371
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,750
HMM?

372
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:02,708
NOW LET GO.

373
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,208
( laughs )

374
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,583
- YOU JUST TOLD ME ALL
I NEEDED TO KNOW.

375
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,041
- OH!

376
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:35,458
YOU-- YOU BROKE THE KEY!

377
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:40,125
ARE YOU CRAZY?
I WASN'T BLUFFING, YOU KNOW?

378
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:46,625
DO YOU REALIZE YOU'VE DOOMED
YOUR FRIENDS TO BE DESTROYED?

379
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,541
( screams )

380
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,250
- YOU'RE WRONG.

381
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,541
I'M TAKING THEM ALL BACK
WITH ME.

382
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,583
WE'RE GOING BACK TO OUR WORLD.

383
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,916
- THIS IS BAD.

384
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,083
HE'S MANAGED TO GET BETWEEN
ME AND MY WEAPON.

385
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:03,125
- ICE BLADE SEVEN-STRIKE DANCE!

386
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,375
- ( screaming )

387
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,666
UGH!

388
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:18,541
( groans ) YOU'VE MADE
A HORRIBLE MISTAKE, ICE BOY.

389
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:21,750
ONE THAT YOU'LL SURELY
REGRET FOREVER.

390
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:24,416
THAT WAS THE ONLY THING
THAT COULD'VE SAVED THEM.

391
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,958
AND LIKE A FOOL, YOU WENT AHEAD
AND DEMOLISHED IT ANYWAY.

392
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:35,125
- OH, YEAH?  YOU KNOW WHY I
DON'T LIKE TO BE CALLED ICE BOY?

393
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:37,166
- HMM?

394
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,833
- 'CAUSE I'M AN ICE MAKE WIZARD.

395
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:44,375
- ( theme music playing )

396
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,833
- ( singing in Japanese )

397
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:14,250
- Natsu: ALL RIGHT.
WE GOT THE KEY.

398
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,250
SO NOW LET'S GO
AND SAVE EVERYONE.

399
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,791
- Happy: HEY, LOOK.
ERZA'S HERE, TOO.  COOL!

400
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,833
WE COULD REALLY USE THE HELP.
HEY, ERZA!

401
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:24,583
- SHE LOOKS KIND OF WEIRD.
YOU SURE THAT'S THE RIGHT ONE?

402
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:27,750
- OH, NO!  DOES THAT MEAN
OUR ERZA LOST THE FIGHT?

403
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,416
- AW, MAN.
AND WE HAD ALL MADE IT THIS FAR.

404
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,416
- ( Happy and Natsu speaking )

405
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,500
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

406
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:38,458
- WELL, WE HAVEN'T
RUN OUT JUST YET.

407
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:41,916
WE'LL FIND A WAY TO SAVE' EM.
I PROMISE.
