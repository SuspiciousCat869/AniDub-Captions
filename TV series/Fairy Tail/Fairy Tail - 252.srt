1
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:21,583
[SILVER]
This body is just a vessel.

2
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,958
I happened upon
some random corpse.

3
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,000
[GRAY]
Uh.

4
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:27,750
[SILVER] You know that
every member of Tartaros

5
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:32,333
is a demon from Zeref's books,
don't you? Myself included.

6
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:35,708
In fact, my true form
isn't even remotely human.

7
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:38,458
But still, you can probably
imagine how hard it is

8
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:42,000
to blend in when you go around
looking like a big, scary demon.

9
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,916
That's why I needed a human
"costume," if you will.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,500
When the time finally
rolled around

11
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:50,583
to pick which one I wanted, of
course, I had to choose the one

12
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,750
that still had all
his body parts intact.

13
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:56,333
Honestly, I've kind of grown
attached to this old thing.

14
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:58,500
Anyway, I didn't have
any ulterior motives

15
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:01,250
for throwing this one on,
just convenience.

16
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:04,791
But somehow it's what brought
you and I together again.

17
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:08,083
This day has been a
long time coming, my boy.

18
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:11,541
I've been hungry for
the taste of your blood.

19
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:14,083
You're about one second
away from a beat down!

20
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,166
I still don't have a clue

21
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,208
what in the hell
you're talking about!

22
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:20,000
Why are you really using
my dad's body like this?

23
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:22,375
And why do you want
to use it to kill me?

24
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,041
You wanna know?!

25
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,458
Because I won't be satisfied

26
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:28,458
until I've killed everyone
that witch Ur cared about!

27
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:29,791
[growls]

28
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:31,125
[SILVER]
After all,

29
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:34,375
she put me in that prison
of ice for ten years.

30
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:35,625
[GRAY]
What?

31
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,875
[SILVER]
I'm not Silver, I'm Deliora!

32
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:45,625
There's no way in hell
you've forgotten my name!

33
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,208
No way.

34
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:50,875
Ur killed Deliora. I saw it!

35
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,333
[SILVER]
Yes, that is true.

36
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:55,250
I was dead for ten long years.

37
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:58,458
But once Tartaros built the
Hell's Core regeneration system,

38
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:01,583
it gave me another chance
to get my sweet revenge.

39
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:04,416
You're here for revenge? Really?

40
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,166
I know how that feels.

41
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,375
If you're having a
hard time believing me,

42
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,208
I can show you my true form.

43
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,083
You know, the one
from your nightmares.

44
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:15,416
The monster that killed
your whole family!

45
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,500
[growling]

46
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:06,041
[GRAY panting]

47
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,416
Heh.

48
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,083
Deliora!

49
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,708
Ur's little shadow
is here to play.

50
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,291
[SILVER laughing]

51
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,875
[GRAY grunts]

52
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,083
Damn!

53
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,666
Oh, please!

54
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,083
You'll need to defend yourself
a lot better than that, kiddo!

55
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,583
[GRAY groans]

56
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,166
Pull yourself together!

57
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,958
I'm tryin' to wring some
satisfaction outta this!

58
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,625
[GRAY growls]

59
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,041
Come on, boy!

60
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,958
I killed your dad. Take revenge!

61
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,458
Is this all you learned from Ur?

62
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:05,208
[GRAY]
Ice Make Cold Excalibur!

63
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,291
[laughing]

64
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,625
[SILVER]
I gotta admit.

65
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,750
Ice magic ain't bad at all.

66
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:18,833
It's a powerful weapon
in the right hands.

67
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,833
Just not in yours.

68
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:29,000
[SILVER] I've tasted bland
ice before, but wow.

69
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,166
[GRAY grunts]

70
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,000
No snappy retort?

71
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,666
Somethin' ya might'a picked up
from your flamethrower friend:

72
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,583
you don't attack a slayer
with his own kinda magic.

73
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:38,916
[SILVER laughs]

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,416
[GRAY growls]

75
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,791
[SILVER] Ice is the only
weapon Ur's clan has.

76
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,000
Which is precisely why

77
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,416
I mastered a magic
impervious to it.

78
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,208
Ice Demon Slayer magic!

79
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,666
[JUVIA]
Demon Slayer Magic?

80
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,583
[KEYES] Yes. An ironic
skill to possess in an ally.

81
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,291
He became one of
the Demon Gates

82
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,208
at the behest of
the Underworld King

83
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:06,875
in recognition of his might.

84
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,875
If he's really a demon slayer,

85
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,583
then why is he
on Tartaros' side?

86
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,875
[KEYES] Perhaps our
powers changed his mind.

87
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,166
Or perhaps he plots
against us from within.

88
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,375
Regardless, I'm certain
my dread sovereign

89
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:25,666
had his reasons for
recruiting such a man.

90
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,958
[JUVIA]
Hang in there, Gray.

91
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,583
[NATSU yells]

92
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:45,791
Ker-plunk

00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,083
[NATSU groans]

94
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,333
That didn't even leave a
scratch, you mumbling freak!

95
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm just fine.

96
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,625
[TEMPESTER]
"Mumbling freak"?

97
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:58,375
Shall I take that as an
attempt to mock me, human?

98
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:01,166
[LUCY]
Those curses. Calamities.

99
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,958
Like the plague that got to
Laxus and the Thunder Legion!

100
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,583
Could this be the guy?!

101
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:11,750
Yeah, I get it; you're strong.
Now lemme tan your scaly hide!

102
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:15,416
Ha. I've never seen
a human like you.

103
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,291
But regardless!

104
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,416
You're under a
certain delusion.

105
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,291
Seems you think you're the
toughest thing you've ever seen.

106
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:28,375
Back where we demons are from,
such bluster marks a fool.

107
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,791
You sound angry.

108
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,791
I didn't say anything to
hurt your feelings, did I?

109
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:36,166
Well, if I can piss you off,
I know I can make you cry.

110
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,541
So how's this sound?

111
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:41,083
I'ma beat on ya till
you cry out for mercy!

112
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,500
Swoosh and slash.

113
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:43,750
[NATSU screams]

115
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,875
Come on, guys. Hang in there!

00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,458
[NATSU grunts]

117
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,250
[GAJEEL]
What's the matter, Salamander?

118
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,750
Your butt looks a little raw!

119
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,125
[NATSU] Naw, Happy's snowballs
hit harder than this guy.

120
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,666
Glad to hear it.

121
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,958
Mine's no pushover,
but I like him for that.

122
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,666
Let's end this freak show!

123
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,375
They screwed with
the wrong guild!

124
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,500
[NATSU screams]

125
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,250
I'm sorry, everyone.

126
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,750
I just need a little more
time to get it together.

127
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,791
[exposion]

128

[LUCY]
Juvia!

129
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,041
[KEYES] I have a question
for you, water wielder.

130
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,083
What is it that you fear most?

131
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,250
Losing the one you love, surely.

132
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,666
But what would be worse?

133
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,583
To slowly earn his hatred,

134
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,958
or find yourself abandoned
to his indifference?

135
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:35,458
Perhaps the least painful way to
lose him would be through death.

136
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:38,750
[JUVIA] Silence, fiend! I'm
immune to your verbal abuse!

137
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,291
[KEYES]
Is that a fact?

138
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:43,041
Gray and I have been together
for hundreds of days, okay?

139
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,375
We are way past
the hatred phase,

140
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,916
and he's in too deep
to abandon me now.

141
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,666
So yes, you might as
well save your breath.

142
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,708
[KEYES]
You're unaffected.

143
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:56,333
My, what a pleasant surprise.

144
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,666

Yeah, that's it.

00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,958
That's the look I've
been waitin' to see.

155
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,833
I'm gonna twist that pretty
face of yours with pain.

156

Oh, and after I'm
finished with you,

157
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,416
I'm gonna hunt
down your pal Lyon.

158
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,875
And once I've bled him dry,

159
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,333
I'll move on to
everyone else you know.

160
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:49,333
Every friend you've

[GRAY growls]

That isn't your mouth
to use, so shut it!

163
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,083
You're never gonna
hurt anyone again!

164
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,458
You hear me?!

165
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,500
Ice Impact!

166
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:12,708
Now that ice tasted good.

Here comes mine.

Ice Demon

Rage!

Do you like it?

[laughing]

00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:47,958
I know you're gonna be
a strong man, Gray.

176
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,375
Word of advice for ya.

177
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,750
Get out of my father
and then run

178
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,583
before I realize how
pissed off I am.

179
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,083
[SILVER]
Ooh, you've got me shaking

180
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:07,375
in my ice resistant
boots, tough guy.

181
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,916
There's nothin' you can
do to hurt me, remember?

182
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,041
Ice only makes me stronger!

183
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,916
[GRAY]
Ice Make...

184
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,750
[GRAY]
Cannons!

[groans]

00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,833
[SILVER]
Ah, I get it.

188
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,416
Those cannons might
be made of ice,

189
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,166
but you've got 'em loaded
with regular rocks.

190

Good!

191
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,000
You're smarter than
I took ya for!

192
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,500
However...

193
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,458
[GRAY]
What the--?

194
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:05,208
[SILVER] There a problem?
Thought you liked it cold.

195
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,625
You're gonna have
a hell of a time

196
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,791
finding more
ice-free ammo now.

197
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,833
No, there's ammo everywhere.

198
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,083
[SILVER]
Huh?

199
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,791
[GRAY] Found out somethin'
about this kinda ice

200
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,791
back at the Village of the Sun.

201
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:22,000
I can channel it through my body
to reshape it any way I please!

202
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,958
[gasps] What do you mean?!

203
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,750
As you've repeatedly mentioned,

204
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:29,625
Slayer Wizards can consume
any magic of their elements.

205
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:33,250
But I'm pretty sure there's
an exception to that.

206
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,458
No way, man. I can't
just eat my own fire.

207
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,166
What, are you crazy?

208
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,125
[GRAY growls, yells]

209
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:49,083
This one's for my
entire frickin' family!

210
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:04,250
[SILVER] You're right,
I can't consume my own magic.

211
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:08,583
But it's still ice.
And ice can't hurt me.

212
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:09,916
How long's it gonna take

213
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,333
before you realize
what you're up against?

214
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:16,625
It's me, Gray. Deliora
come to take your life!

215
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,333
[GRAY whimpers]

216
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,583
[groaning]

217
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:42,541
[FRANMALTH] Ah! Oh, what
a humiliating blunder.

218
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,125
I'll never live it down!

219
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,666
[groans] Captured
by a pack of cats!

220
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,541
How much will 
this failure cost?!

221
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,333
That's one noisy shroom.

222
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,916
It was less annoying
on top of my head.

223
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,208
I wonder why it
became a mushroom.

224
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:58,708
I'm feelin' hungry again.
Anyone mind if I eat it?

225
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,833
Sorry, but somethin' tells
me that's not a good idea.

226
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,791
So what's the deal with
this mushroom anyway?

227
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,375
Had ya seen it before,
or did it pop up at random?

228
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,083
I've seen it before, all right.

229
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,375
It's one of Tartaros' strongest!

230
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:13,500
Natsu beat him up earlier,
but it was a crazy hard fight.

231
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,791
He swallows people's souls
and takes their power!

232
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,291
Celestial Spirits, too!

233
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,125
Also, I guess spells have souls
cause they're on the menu.

234
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,583
[PANTHERLILY]
You're rambling, Happy.

235
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,583
But the point of it is, he
has powerful curses, right?

236
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,583
So is this guy
turning into a fungus

237
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,625
like a symbol of his
parasitic nature?

238
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,958
Yeah, I couldn't tell ya.

239

trying to eat me alive.

[LECTOR]
We've talked about this, Frosch.

244
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,625
If your food can move,
ya gotta cook it.

245
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,541
Not fish, but the point
is we gotta wait

246
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,000
till he shows us the control
room, or else Erza'll kill us.

247
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,583
Sorry about that.

248
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,250
[PANTHERLILY]
You guys are, kind of cruel.

249

[FRANMALTH] "Cruel"?!
They're positively demonic!

250
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,000
You shut your
filthy demon mouth.

251
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,583
Now listen,

252
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,000
you'll take us to the control
room and you'll do it quickly.

253
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,500
And should I sense that
you've lead us astray,

254
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:07,958
so help me, I will slice
you up and sauté you myself!

255
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,250
[LECTOR]
Hey! Erza and Minerva are back.

256
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,125
[FROSCH] Oh good!
I hope they brought food.

257
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,541
There's no time!

258
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,875
We gotta stop all those
Faces from blowin'up first.

259
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,083
Right, and we don't even
have an hour to do it.

260
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,458
We musn't dawdle.

261
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:22,333
[FRANMALTH] I can't
afford to take them there,

262
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,333
but I can't afford to get
chopped up and eaten, either.

263
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:28,166
I have to buy some time somehow!

264
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,666
[CARLA]
There are so many of them.

265
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,625
What can we do
against such odds?

266
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,666
Hey, Doranbolt,

267
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,875
how long would it take us
to get back to Magnolia

268
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,583
if you used a direct line?

269
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,666
I might have to stop a
few times along the way

270
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,583
to get my bearings.

271
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,458
But I'd say about five
minutes, give or take.

272
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,458
So are we regrouping
with the others?

273
00:15:56,541 --> 00:16:00,583
Yes, but that's not the
only thing we're doing.

274
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,791
We'll use Warren's
magic to tell the other guilds

275
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,708
about these Faces,
and ask for their help.

276
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,708
If we're gonna succeed, we'll
need every last one of them.

277
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,958
And this is one fight that
all of us have a stake in.

00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,416
[DORANBOLT]
Let's move.

279
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,833
[WENDY, CARLA]
Right!

280
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,958
[KEYES laughs]
What's the matter?

281
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:33,041
Is your resolve
beginning to waver?

[KEYES]
I see it clearly.

284
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,541
Soon enough, your beloved

285
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:42,375
will choose to make the same
sacrifice his master did.

00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:45,458
[JUVIA]
What is he saying?

00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:49,000
That Gray will
use... Iced Shell?

288

What's the deal? You
were talkin' so big before.

can do is scream!

There's no need to be
shy about it. Let it out.

Know that all your righteous
anger counts for nothing!

is all you have!

That putrid taste in your mouth?

They call it despair.

I'm the wolf, and
you're the lamb,

it hopes without reason.

here's covered in it.

00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,375
[SILVER]
You're obviously bluffing.

318
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,083
I've already proven that
ice attacks can't hurt me.

319
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:46,958
Are you gonna throw away
your life to prove me right?

320
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:50,041
You really won't stand a
chance once you're dead.

321
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,833
[SILVER] Why would
you go through with this?

322
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,416
We both know it won't work!

323
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,500
[GRAY]
What makes you so sure?

324
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:05,083
Think back. This spell made
a statue of you, didn't it?

325
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,416
That was then!

326
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,916
Before I learned to wield
Ice Demon Slayer magic;

327
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,208
it's different now!

328
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,750
You may be right!

329
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,708
But if you know for sure, then
why do you look so scared?!

330
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:19,333
You aren't really gonna do this.
You wouldn't dare! You'll die!

331
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:23,416
There's no question! I'll
do anything to stop you!

332
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,208
No! Don't do it!

333
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,000
You killed my family.

334
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:38,000
[SILVER gasps]
An illusion.

335
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,625
[GRAY]
And then.

336
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:40,750
[SILVER whimpers]

337
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,916
You killed my master, too!

338
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,541
No, wait!

339
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,250
[NATSU]
If I didn't let you do it before

340
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,000
why would I let you do it now?

341
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,500
I'm not gonna let you
go out like that.

342
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,291
I love you, Gray!

343
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,291
[GRAY]
I'm sorry!

344
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:34,583
Iced Shell!

345
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:38,041
[SILVER screams]

346
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,958
Now freeze!

347
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,750
Ice has no effect on me!

348
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,416
I will never freeze again!

349
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,291
[GRAY gasps]

350
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,083
You just gave your
life for nothing!

351
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,916
The Iced Shell has failed!

352
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,083
[GRAY] I'm sorry...
I came close...

353
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,333
To forgettin' about
the people in my life!

354
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,708
[SILVER] What? They
were both illusions?

355
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,416
[GRAY]
I refuse to die!

356
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,500
My friend would get
way too sappy if I did!

357
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,166
A cannon ball? How the
hell did you get it?!

358
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,958
[GRAY]
Melted the ice around it.

359
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,416
Just like in the
Village of the Sun.

360
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,458
[SILVER]
Uh.

361
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:30,333
[SILVER] It wasn't the
dragon slayer. It was you.

362
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:33,166
[GRAY]
Ice Make...

363
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,708
Vambrace!

364
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,708
[SILVER groaning]

365
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,916
Knew ya had it in you.

366
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,458
[GRAY panting]

367
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,166
Damn it!

368
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,958
Did you think I
wouldn't realize?!

369
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,708
Just how stupid
do you think I am?

370
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:19,125
[GRAY]
Damn it, why?!

371
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:20,375
Why?!

372
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:25,875
[GRAY pants] You lied to
me. You aren't Deliora.

373
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:29,125
You're my dad.
I know you are.

374
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:16,500
[LUCY] Once torn apart by a
demon's murderous rampage,

375
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:19,708
father and son
share a sad reunion.

376
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,791
Resurrected by
Tartaros's necromancer

377
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:24,958
and forced to serve amongst
their ranks for far too long,

378
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:27,833
Silver never lost sight
of his one true goal.

379
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:32,291
Now he tells his final tale,
and gives Gray his inheritance.

380
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:36,375
Next time: "Tartaros Chapter
A Silver Wish."

381
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:41,083
His face is cleaved with tears,
the raking claws of truth.
