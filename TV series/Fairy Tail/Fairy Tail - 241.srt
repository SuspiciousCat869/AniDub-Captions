1
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:23,541
[SEILAH] You can do as I say, or
I can make you wrap your hand

2
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:26,666
around your sister's
throat again.

3
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,291
Your task shall be both
simple and unforgivable.

4
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,625
Return to your guild hall

5
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:34,958
and place this Lacrima
anywhere inside it.

6
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:36,583
Why? What will it do?

7
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:42,750
[SEILAH] It will emit a vast
amount of concentrated ether.

8
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:46,583
Imagine a Jupiter
Blast times 500.

9
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:49,583
Don't worry, your guild
mate's deaths will be swift.

10
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,500
I won't do it!
You can't make me!

11
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:54,333
Shall I have you kill
your sister, then?

12
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,208
[ELFMAN]
N-No.

13
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:00,708
[SEILAH] You've no choice.
My curse is absolute.

14
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,750
[LUMMY]
Speaking of things I don't like!

15
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:07,916
I think it's time I
transformed this one too!

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,791
Your name's Mira, right?

17
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,500
You and that stupid, cute face.

18
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:16,708
I'm gonna transform you
into the ugliest caterpillar

19
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:19,041
this world has ever seen.

20
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:32,875
What're you doing?

21
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:35,166
We're in crisis mode
here so you run away?

22
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,041
[ELFMAN gasps]

23
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:38,416
Is that some kind of Lacrima?

24
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,083
[gasps]

25
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,375
You can't stop me!

26
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,000
What do you think you're doing?

27
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,666
[ELFMAN]
Why did you have to come here?

28
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,500
Now I can't let you leave.

29
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:51,625
This is what I have to do!

30
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:56,416
[CANA]
Is it a bomb?

31
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,041
[ELFMAN]
This is goodbye.

32
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,958
This is the end for Fairy Tail!

33
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,541
[CANA]
Help!

34
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:10,791
[CANA]
Is he under some kind of spell?

35
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,458
What do I do?

36
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,916
Based on everything Happy
told me, I've done it.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,875
[ALL gasp]

38
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,458
That's awesome, Levy!

39
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:19,958
So where are they?

40
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,041
Above us.

41
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:21,750
What?

42
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,333
They're right over us.

43
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,291
Are you certain?

44
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,375
[GAJEEL] What the heck
are you talkin' about, kid?

45
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,208
[LEVY]
I know how it sounds,

46
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,541
but when Happy escaped,

47
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,916
they were near the eastern
border, heading west.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,333
Unless they changed directions,

49
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:37,416
they should be pretty much
on top of Magnolia now.

50
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:43,625
We'll see the fireworks soon.

51
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,041
Guess they thought
they'd come to us.

52
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,000
We'll have Natsu
back in no time.

53
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:48,916
Aye.

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,916
Prepare for war!

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,375
[FAIRY TAIL]
Yeah!

56
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,708
[HAPPY gasping]

57
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,166
What was that?

58
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,125
It came from Fairy Tail!

59
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,958
Their guild hall blew up!

60
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,000
[CITIZEN C]
Aw, and we only just fixed it.

61
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,666
[CITIZEN D] You don't think
this could have to do

62
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,291
with the Council bombing, do ya?

63
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,291
I really hope that everyone
made it out in time.

64
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:21,333
Let's hope so, 'cause nobody
could've survived that.

65
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:22,750
[CITIZEN F]
Uh. We should help 'em!

66
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:26,291
No way. If they're under attack,
it'll be too dangerous!

67
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:45,166
[SEILAH] The end of Fairy Tail,
delivered as promised.

68
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,583
[KYOKA] That was
quite well done, Seilah.

69
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,458
[laughing]

70
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:50,791
I can scarcely imagine

71
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,166
how many bodies must
be under that rubble!

72
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,875
[KYOKA] We've eliminated
Fairy Tail in a single move.

73
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,666
It would seem that
there was no need

74
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,583
for us to mobilize the Cube
against them after all.

75
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,291
It would.

76
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,708
Now that they're dealt with,

77
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:07,083
we can put all of our efforts
into activating Face.

78
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,708
The time is upon us.

79
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:12,500
The White Legacy: Face.

80
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,541
Rendered foolish by their fears,

81
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:18,000
the humans built the engine
of their own demise.

82
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,333
Once it has cleansed
this world of magic,

83
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,541
the humans will be powerless,

84
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:26,333
and then the age of
demons shall begin.

85
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:30,916
And all of this... is to prepare
for the return of Zeref.

86
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:34,750
Oh, that isn't good.

87
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,708
Is there something that
you'd like to tell us?

88
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,083
[FRANMALTH]
Yeah, the thing is

89
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,708
I'm picking up some
approaching magic signatures.

90
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,916
[SOLDIER A] Lady Kyoka!
Our sentries have spotted

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,083
three individuals
approaching the Cube.

92
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,250
Did you say three?
Well, that's off.

93
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:50,791
The Archive is detecting over
a hundred wizards en route.

94
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,333
[SOLDIER A]
I can't speak to that,

95
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,000
but we only saw three, sir.

96
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,583
This doesn't make sense.

97
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,291
[SEILAH] I'll put our ventral
surveillance onscreen.

98
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:04,833
What are those?

99
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,375
Cat attack!

100
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,125
Just cats?

101
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,291
Uh, don't you "just cats" me,
they're vicious animals!

102
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,750
[gasps]

103
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:22,125
[FRANMALTH] I see that you
let one escape, Lord Silver.

104
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,000
And you say that
these three creatures

105
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,166
are emitting hundreds
of signatures?

106
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,375
Look at their paws.

107
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,625
Each of them seems to be
carrying something.

108
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,000
Decks of cards?

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,666
[CANA]
Stop this, Elfman!

110
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,625
Think about what you're doing!

111
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,041
Fairy Tail must be destroyed!

112
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:52,875
I'll destroy you.
I'll destroy us all!

113
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,958
[CANA] Sorry. Hope you
don't take this personally.

114
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,958
[ELFMAN yelling]

115
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,458
Destroy. I must destroy!

116
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,791
That blonde, tan pretty boy
taught me that trick.

117
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,833
Always wanted to use it.

118
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,458
Crap. It's about to blow.

119
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:19,583
Damn it!

120
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,333
We'll have Natsu
back in no time.

00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,708
Aye.

122
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,208

Wait, this magic.

What the hell's going on?

Sorry, but I have to make
sure everyone gets out,

131
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,708
and some of you
are way too slow!

Is that you, Cana?

Happy! Carla! Lily!

about to explode!

Get us out of here and
head for that Tartaros base!

139

Those cards they're
carrying must be stacked

with Fairy Tail wizards!

141
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:25,833
So it would seem.

00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,375
Impossible.

143
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,583
I've failed my Lady Kyoka.

Establish a perimeter!

Deploy a gravity field

00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,416
[FAIRY TAIL]
Yeah!

164
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,083
Fairy Tail! To battle!

165
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,125
What happened?

166
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,583
You back to normal yet, Elfman?

167
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,875
[ELFMAN]
What have I...?

168
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,708
What did I just do?

169
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,791
You wanna save Mira
and Lisanna, right?

170
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,666
Then pick yourself up.

171
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,208
It's gettin' kinda
noisy out there.

172
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,208
Whelp. Doesn't matter to me.

173
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,666
Here's what I'ma do first.

174
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,500
I'ma take that pretty face
of yours and screw it up!

175
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,708
How's it feel

176
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,958
having demon blood flow into
your pathetical human body?

177
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,791
You're gonna look
positively hideous

178
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,208
by the time my work is done,

179
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,958
and then none of the boys'll
like you more than me!

180
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,541
[LUMMY]
Ahh.

181
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,750
From beauty queen
to troll face.

182
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,250
Sure does suck to be you.

183
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,500
[yelps]

184
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,500
[LUMMY screams]

185
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,750
[LUMMY]
Hey! Not cool.

186
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,083
How did you even do that?

187
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:15,583
[whimpering]

188
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,500
[MIRAJANE]
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:21,125
I already have a bit of
demon blood in my veins.

190
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,083
That's how I'm able to
use Satan Soul magic.

191
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,541
[whimpering]

192
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,041
That injection was
really quite helpful.

193
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,250
[screaming]

194
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,375
[MIRAJANE chuckles]

195
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,708
I'm glad we have Erza here.

196
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:47,208
Hostages tend to be rather
effective against humans.

197
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,916
Sure took ya long enough!

198
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,541
How the tables have turned.

199
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:05,291
We had you in shackles.
How did you escape?

200
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,916
[NATSU] That'd be on account
of this awesome sword of yours.

201
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,583
[KYOKA]
You found the Heat Blade?

202
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,375
Whatever you call it,
it was exactly what we needed.

203
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,000
It practically fell
into our laps

204
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,583
when the place started shakin'.

205
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,625
Turns out it can cut through
just about anything.

206
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,000
What have you done with Erza?

207
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,333
[ERZA]
I received such tender treatment

208
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,500
when I was your prisoner.

209
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,000
It'd be a shame if I
couldn't return the favor.

210
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,541
I intend to make the
remainder of your short life

211
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,791
a living hell.

212
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,041
Makes you wonder what she did.

213
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,291
[NATSU] Where did you
take Elfman and Mira?

214
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,791
You mean they captured
Elfman as well?

215
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,166
[ERZA]
Answer him.

216
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,916
Whoever "Elfman" is,
I've not heard of him.

217
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,791
As for the one you call Mira,
two floors down, in the lab.

218
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,041
But there's no
guarantee she's alive.

219
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,375
What did you say?

220
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,958
I'm sorry, but
I need to find her!

221
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:33,750
Natsu, go help her out.
I'll take care of this one.

222
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,041
All right then!

223
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,250
What was the source
of all that shaking?

224
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,583
Our Fortress had a stronger
than expected reaction

225
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,291
to the unsealing of Face.

226
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,625
So, you did unseal Face?

227
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,375
Then, does that mean
you killed Jellal?

228
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:01,041
[KYOKA]
No. We did not.

229
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,166
We did break the seal, however.

230
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,791
After finding a
different method.

231
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,416
What exactly are you
trying to achieve?

232
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,250
[ERZA] Activating Face
would purge all magic

233
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,333
from this continent.
Why would you want that?

234
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,416
What would it
accomplish for you?

235
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,375
Everything we've done...

236
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,291
...we've done so that
we may return to Zeref.

237
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,416
What do you mean
"return" to him?

238
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,333
[KYOKA]
You're such a fool!

239
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,458
[KYOKA] These restraints are
designed to inhibit magic!

240
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:40,000
But they have no effect on
curses, thus no effect on me!

241
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,041
[KYOKA gasps]

242
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,083
So, you're all
followers of Zeref.

243
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,916
"Followers" would be
an understatement,

244
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,208
no we're more like his children.

245
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,208
We're all born of
the sacred books.

246
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,291
Born of the Books of Zeref!

247
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,625
It's only natural for us to
have faith in our Creator.

248
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,458
I have no problem
with faith in others.

249
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:10,291
But it can't justify what
the heart knows is wrong!

250
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,708
[KYOKA]
How could a human understand?

251
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,958
[ERZA] Humans have beliefs
of their own, and faith, too.

252
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,583
And we need that.

253
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,666
We mustn't let it blind us.

254
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:27,833
We think for ourselves,
and we stand for our beliefs.

255
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,583
[ERZA yelling]

256
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,958
[ERZA] You alone are responsible
for what you choose!

257
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,333
[SOLDIERS yelling]

258
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,333
They just keep on comin'.

259
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,250
I'm startin' to get bored!

260
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,666
Just who do you think you are?

261
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,791
Gettin' fresh with my Gray
while his back is turned!

262

[chuckles]

263
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,791
Ah, that is gross.

264
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,750
Taste my Iron Dragon

265
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,500
Roar!

266
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,041
[WENDY]
You asked for this.

267
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,583
Sky Dragon Wing Attack!

268
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,875
I guess that didn't settle it.

00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:41,041
Sky Dragon Roar!

270
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,041

[TAURUS]
Moo!

00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:48,583
[TAURUS]
Heh?

273
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,750
Look out, Miss Lucy! Behind you!

I've got this. Regulus Impact!

[SOLDIERS screaming]

277
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,083
Hey, thanks!

278
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,833
You show up on your own a lot.

279
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,125
Never lower your
guard in battle.

280
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,375
However...

281
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,458
[LUCY]
Uh.

282
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,958
I think you'd find
it quite rewarding

283
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,125
if you lowered it for me.

284
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:12,083
I've got my doubts about that,
but also, this isn't the time.

285
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,791
You've implied that
there may be a time,

286
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,041
and I am oh so willing to wait.

287
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,958
Loke! I could use
some help here!

288
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,750

Begone!

00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,000

00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,708
I appreciate the backup, bro.

294
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,250
No prob,

295
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,125
but I think that weight you put
on might be slowin' ya down.

296
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:56,583
Ah, shut up! I already told ya,
it's obviously muscle mass!

297
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,916
Have you seen Levy?

298
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,125
She's got herself
covered. Take a look.

Quit slackin' off, you two.

303
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,208
[DROY, JET]
We weren't.

304
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,083
[JET]
Just how many are there?

305
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,708
Too many to count.

306
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:27,625
Laxus and the Thunder Legion are
still down we gotta protect 'em.

307
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,916
Why did you bring
our injured with us?

308
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,208
Because if I hadn't, they'd be
in tiny little pieces right now.

[ELFMAN grunts]

310
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,166
[ELFMAN]
I'm sorry. It was my fault.

311
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,875
You call yourself a man,

312
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:48,125
so how about you quit sulking
and help us defeat our enemy!

313
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:52,208
I hear ya, yeah, a real man
owns up to his mistakes.

So that's what I'm gonna do!

00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,875
I'm gettin' real sick
of you scumbags.

324
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,583
Rainbow Fire!

325
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,250
We can beat them back,
but how do we move forward?

326
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,333
[WAKABA] We gotta get on top
of this thing, somehow.

327
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,583
We could fly people over,

328
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:43,250
but this gravity field
is stronger than normal.

329
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,958
We're on the bottom of
this thing right now,

330
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:48,500
so that means we must be
real far from the top.

331
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,583
What do we do?

332
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,166
We're wasting our
strength down here

333
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,083
while Erza and the others
are lying in chains!

334
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,875
[yelling]

335
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,875
We have to find a way
to get into this fortress!

336
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,750
What the--?

337
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,458
An explosion?

338
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,708
It's Erza!

339
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,875
[MAKAROV]
There's our way through!

340
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,166
I'm coming, Mira! I'm
gonna save you, hold on!

341
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,500
[SOLDIER I]
I see them!

342
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,291
[SOLDIER J]
The escaped prisoners!

343
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,666
[SOLDIER K]
Run 'em down!

344
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,666
[NATSU]
Go on, Lisanna.

345
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,750
I've got this.

346
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,500
You sure?

347
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,000
Go save Mira!

348
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,041
Right!

349
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:52,916
[SOLDIER L]
Huh?

350
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,166
[yelling]

351
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,791
This is easy now
that I can use magic.

352
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,791
What's the deal?

353
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,916
They're all frozen in place.

354
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:26,833
[ZEREF] You've come
quite a long way, Natsu.

355
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:30,625
[ZEREF]
I always hoped you would.

356
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:31,708
[NATSU grunts]

357
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:36,458
[ZEREF] This is Tartaros,
the Library of Zeref.

358
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,708
Where all my books reside.

359
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:15,041
[LUCY]
Now that Erza's cleared the way.

360
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,916
Fairy Tail can finally
begin its counter attack.

361
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,166
But the demons of Tartaros

362
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,541
have already sown
the seeds of disaster.

363
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:24,458
And they fully
intend to harvest.

364
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:26,833
As the two mighty guilds
converge on one another

365
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,750
and engage in total war,

366
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:32,333
Zeref appears before
Natsu... just to talk?

367
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:34,666
What exactly is he after?

368
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:38,750
Next Time: "Tartaros Chapter
To Let Live or Die."

369
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:41,791
Truth runs deeper than darkness.
