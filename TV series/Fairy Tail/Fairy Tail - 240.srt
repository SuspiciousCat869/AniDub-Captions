Your tower was our first jail.

It was Brain who set us free,
or so he led us to believe.

We were torn from our homes,

taught by your whips
to curse the world,

So, what is it? Have you
found Jellal, or haven't you?

It seems that there's
no longer any need.

What have you done?

There's nothing left of him.

167
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:20,000
He killed Jellal. Erased him.

168
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,500
How tragic.

169
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,000
Is this for real?

170
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,375
It only took him one attack.

I thought you died.
What happened?

176
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,333
[MIDNIGHT]
My nightmare. He tore it apart.

177
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,333
[ANGEL]
His eyes.

178
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,875
[MIDNIGHT]
Did he... blind himself?

179

No way!

[RACER]
I don't like it.

184
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:18,208
Feels like a spell. An attack?

185

Let's get him while it charges!

Don't think we have time.

I've never seen a

You've won. Now finish it.

[JELLAL]
That's not my intention.

You lied. You will
send us to jail.

[JELLAL]
Wrong again.

The Oracion Seis has

Now, I invite you
join to my guild.

200

[JELLAL] The world never
answered your prayers,

201
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,375
so you raged against it,

as did all who belong
to Crime Sorciere.

203
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,916
Try the path
of redemption.

204
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,333
It will lead you
to your answers.

205
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:10,583
Let the foe we share
give us common purpose.

206
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,708
We can beat Zeref
if we fight together.

[FRANMALTH] This conversation
grows tedious, Former Chairman.

208

Have you found Jellal or not?

209
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,666
[CRAWFORD] Oh, I've done
far better than that.

210
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,625
I've taken him out of
the equation entirely.

211
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,125
My "Super Archive" magic was
able to transfer his seal.

212
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,166
Huh?

213
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,958
[CRAWFORD]
The seal is like a key.

214
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:45,333
Jellal held it once, but
I just took it for myself.

215
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,750
Oh, did you really?

216
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,458
[CRAWFORD]
That's right, I did.

217
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,583
And I can transfer it
to anyone at all.

218
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:53,083
Anyone we don't mind
killing that is.

219
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,833
But yes, with that person's
death, Face will be freed!

220
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,916
What do you mean "that" person?

221
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,958
I mean anyone,
whoever we choose!

222
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,458
One of the captives from
Fairy Tail, perhaps!

223
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:05,500
Uh, wai-wai-wai-wait. Let's
not get ahead of ourselves.

224
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,416
You just said that
you're the final seal.

225
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,666
Does that mean you're all
that's holding Face in check?

226
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,875
[CRAWFORD]
Yes! Now shut up so I can rant!

227
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,500
I had no idea that
this was possible.

228
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,958
My Super Archive ability
is even more fearsome

229
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:22,250
than I believed it to be!
Finally, we can unseal Face!

230
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:25,458
And when we do, the
world of men will be ours!

[FRANMALTH grunts]

233
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,833
Though It does seem a bit
strange that the key

234
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,916
to such a powerful weapon could
be transferred so easily.

235

Are you sure about this?

Yes, well we Former Chairman
are "Men of Authority."

237

Indeed. So what
you're saying is true?

Well, that's convenient.

So this will break
the seal, will it?

How? How could you--?

If even the Cube is reacting,

from where we were
expecting it to appear.

No matter. Just activate it.

was the only person

that you forgot it?

--[footsteps]

320
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,500
[TEMPESTER]
Someone there?

321
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,416
[JACKAL]
Hm? Who the hell is that?

322
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,041
Oh! Almost forgot!

323
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,708
[LUMMY squeaks]

324
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,833
[MINERVA]
So this is the new me.

325
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,333
And I thought I was
strong before.

326
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,833
[LUMMY] Lady Kyoka
brought this human in.

327
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:02,541
I think she said
her name was Minerva?

328
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,750
Honestly though,
I try to be open,

329
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,666
but girls just
don't do it for me.

330
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,916
Minerva.

331
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,583
Hey, it's always good
to have some new blood.

332
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,208
[LUMMY]
Speaking of things I don't like,

333
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,875
I think it's time I
transformed this one too!

334
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,541
[LUMMY]
Your name's Mira, right?

335
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,291
You and that stupid, cute face.

336
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,708
I'm gonna transform you
into the ugliest caterpillar

337
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,041
this world has ever seen.

338
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:45,833
What're you doing?

339
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,791
We're in crisis mode
here so you run away?

340
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,416
Is that some kind of Lacrima?

341
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,208
[gasps]

342
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,666
You can't stop me!

343
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,041
What do you...
think you're doing?

344
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,791
[ELFMAN]
Why did you have to come here?

345
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:04,625
Now I can't let you leave!
This is what I have to do!

346
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,458
[CANA]
Is it a bomb?

347
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,083
[ELFMAN]
This is goodbye.

348
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,958
This is the end for Fairy Tail!

349
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,250
[CANA]
Help!

350
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,791
[CANA]
Is he under some kind of spell?

351
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,416
What do I do?

352
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,791
Based on everything Happy
told me, I've done it.

353
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:29,875
[ALL gasping]

354
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,500
That's awesome, Levy!

355
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,958
So, where are they?

356
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,083
Above us.

357
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:34,791
What?

358
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,375
They're right over us.

359
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,208
Are you certain?

360
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,458
[GAJEEL] What the heck
are you talkin' about, kid?

361
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,291
[LEVY]
I know how it sounds,

362
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,625
but when Happy escaped,

363
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,166
they were near the eastern
border, heading west.

364
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,583
Unless they changed directions,

365
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,708
they should be pretty much
on top of Magnolia now.

366
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,583
We'll see the fireworks soon.

367
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,958
Guess they thought
they'd come to us.

368
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,000
We'll have Natsu
back in no time.

369
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:01,875
Aye.

370
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,666
Get ready!

371
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,166
[FAIRY TAIL]
Yeah!

372
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,791
[HAPPY gasping]

373
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:15,958
[LUCY]
Face has finally been unsealed.

374
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:18,208
And Tartaros has
bolstered its ranks,

375
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:22,000
both with new recruits
and resurrected veterans.

376
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:23,333
Fairy Tail rises up

377
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:26,000
to put a stop to the
demon's sinister ambitions,

378
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:28,583
but Seilah's plot to force
Elfman to destroy the guild

379
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,750
has gone virtually unnoticed.

380
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:33,875
As has the Lacrima
bomb he carries.

381
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:38,125
Next time: "Tartaros Chapter
The Demon's Rebirth."

382
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:41,333
Surmount despair,
and sing of hope.
