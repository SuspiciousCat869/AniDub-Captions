1
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,041
- Natsu: EDOLAS?

2
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,625
- Carla: THAT'S CORRECT.

3
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:26,708
A WORLD THAT EXISTS,

4
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:29,541
INDEPENDENTLY FROM
THE ONE WE KNOW.

5
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:34,083
AND UNFORTUNATELY, A WORLD
THAT'S BEGUN LOSING ITS MAGIC.

6
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,041
- THEY'RE RUNNING OUT OF
MAGIC THERE?

7
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,291
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

8
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,208
- HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

9
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:43,541
- UNLIKE HERE, IN EDOLAS,
MAGIC IS A FINITE RESOURCE

10
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:47,458
WITHOUT LIMITS ON ITS USE, IT
WILL ONE DAY DISAPPEAR FOREVER.

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,791
- ( theme song playing )

12
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:10,000
- ( singing in Japanese )

13
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,666
- IN AN ATTEMPT TO RESTORE
THEIR RAPIDLY DIMINISHING

14
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,791
MAGIC POWER RESERVES,
THE KING OF EDOLAS

15
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:34,291
DEVELOPED A SPELL THAT WOULD
ABSORB IT FROM ANOTHER WORLD,

16
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,458
OUR WORLD.

17
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:41,000
IT IS A VERY POWERFUL SPELL
INDEED. HE CALLED IT ANIMA.

18
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,458
THAT IS WHAT OPENED THE HOLE
IN THE SKY.

19
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,583
- SO, THAT'S IT.

20
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,666
- ANIMA?

21
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,250
YOU CAN'T.
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS, ALL RIGHT?

22
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,875
- Happy: EDOLAS

23
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,333
- Carla: SIX YEARS AGO, THEY
BEGAN SETTING UP ANIMA VORTICES

24
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:09,208
ALL ALONG THE BARRIER
BETWEEN OUR WORLDS.

25
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,666
BUT THE EXPERIMENT DID NOT
GO AS THEY PLANNED.

26
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,458
IT SEEMS SOMEONE HAD
MADE IT THEIR GOAL

27
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,791
TO CLOSE THEM, ONE BY ONE.

28
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,625
MY SUSPICIONS WERE RAISED
WHEN WENDY TOLD ME

29
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,208
WHAT HAPPENED WITH JELLAL.

30
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:28,916
BUT, THE STORY MAKES MORE SENSE
IF HE IS ACTUALLY MYSTOGAN.

31
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:33,333
I'M SURE HE MUST'VE BEEN
THE ONE CLOSING THE ANIMA.

32
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,500
BUT THIS ANIMA WAS SIMPLY
TOO LARGE.

33
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,916
NO ONE WAS STRONG
ENOUGH TO CLOSE IT.

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,166
AND THUS, THE GUILD AND
EVERYTHING SURROUNDING IT

35
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,583
WAS ABSORBED.

36
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,958
- Natsu: WHY WOULD THEY GO AFTER
FAIRY TAIL LIKE THAT?

37
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:51,125
- I TOLD YOU. TO PROVIDE MORE
MAGIC POWER TO THOSE IN EDOLAS.

38
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,291
- SO THEY CHOSE FAIRY TAIL
BECAUSE IT HAS

39
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,541
A LOT OF TOP CLASS WIZARDS?

40
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,333
BECAUSE THERE WAS MORE
POWER TO TAKE?

41
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,166
- THAT'S CORRECT.

42
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,208
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
THAT'S A SERIOUSLY SELFISH MOVE.

43
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:05,208
YOU'D BETTER GIVE US BACK
ALL OF OUR FRIENDS RIGHT NOW!

44
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,000
- ( lightening crackling )

45
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,500
- WHOA.

46
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,250
- YOU MEAN IT, CARLA?

47
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:17,291
THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE OF YOU
AND ME? IT'S OUR FAULT?

48
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,375
- INDIRECTLY, YES.

49
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,750
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"INDIRECTLY?"

50
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:22,875
- THE KING ENTRUSTED US

51
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,791
TO COMPLETE ANOTHER
MISSION ENTIRELY.

52
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,583
SOMETHING THAT WAS
TOTALLY INDEPENDENT

53
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,500
FROM THE ONE INVOLVING
ANIMA AND MAGIC ABSORPTION.

54
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,916
- BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,583
HOW CAN THAT BE TRUE WHEN
YOU WERE BORN IN THIS WORLD?

56
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,083
HATCHED OUT OF AN EGG.

57
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,916
- AND HAPPY WAS, TOO.
IT WAS ME THAT FOUND HIM.

58
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,625
- INDEED WE WERE.

59
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,208
TO BE PERFECTLY
HONEST, I MYSELF,

60
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,750
HAVE NEVER PERSONALLY
SET FOOT IN EDOLAS.

61
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,083
I WAS BORN IN THIS WORLD

62
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,000
AND HAVE SPENT MY
ENTIRE LIFE HERE.

63
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,166
IT'S EXACTLY AS WENDY SAID.

64
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,291
BUT WE WERE IMPRINTED
WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE.

65
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,125
THE DETAILS OF OUR
MISSION AND OF EDOLAS

66
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,041
ARE PART OF WHAT MAKES
UP OUR VERY BEING.

67
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:05,708
HE AND I, WERE BORN TO CARRY OUT
THIS MISSION, FOR OUR KINGDOM.

68
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,666
SO WHY...

69
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,083
WHY DON'T YOU KNOW THE
FIRST THING ABOUT IT?

70
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,750
- I DON'T KNOW.

71
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,708
- ( scoffs )

72
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,416
ANYWAY, THAT'S WHAT I
MEANT BY INDIRECTLY.

73
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,666
THE ANIMA THAT DID THIS
ORIGINATED FROM OUR HOMELAND,

74
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,791
SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE PARTIALLY
TO BLAME.

75
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:36,625
- BUT, WHAT IS THE MISSION
THAT YOU'RE ON, CARLA?

76
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,541
- I CAN'T TELL YOU.
I'M SORRY.

77
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,250
- PLEASE TELL US.

78
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,750
I WANNA KNOW MORE ABOUT WHERE
I CAME FROM AND WHY I'M HERE.

79
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,208
- I SAID I CAN'T TELL YOU
AND THAT'S FINAL.

80
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,708
YOU KNOW IT, BUT YOU JUST
DON'T REMEMBER.

81
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:02,166
- ( sighs )

82
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,291
OKAY, GUYS, LISTEN, NOW THAT THE
CAT'S BEEN LET OUTTA THE BAG,

83
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,833
WE SHOULD HEAD OUT.
WE GOTTA GET TO EDOLAS!

84
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,708
- HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

85
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,833
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

86
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,208
- YOU MEAN IT?

87
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,958
- ( Natsu and Wendy laughing )

88
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,291
- UH. I'M SCARED.

89
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:25,000
AND BEIN' SCARED ALWAYS
MAKES ME HUNGRY.

90
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,208
- IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A
HEALTHY APPETITE.

91
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,041
IF ALL OF OUR FRIENDS ARE
UP IN EDOLAS,

92
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,833
THEN WE GOT NO CHOICE
BUT TO GO AND HELP 'EM OUT.

93
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,875
- Wendy: ARE THEY REALLY THERE?

94
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:44,708
- Carla: I WOULD ASSUME SO.
BUT EVEN IF WE FIND THEM,

95
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:48,208
I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE
WE CAN SAVE THEM.

96
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:51,208
AND WHAT'S MORE. IF WE CAN,
IN FACT, REACH EDOLAS,

97
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,916
I CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT
WE WILL BE ABLE TO RETURN HERE.

98
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,416
- OH WELL. IF NONE OF OUR
BUDDIES ARE IN THIS WORLD,

99
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,250
WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT
OF COMING BACK HERE ANYWAY?

100
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,500
EXCEPT FOR LOOKING
FOR IGNEEL, MAYBE.

101
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,166
- I FEEL THE SAME.

102
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,166
- WE SHOULD AT LEAST
TRY TO SAVE ALL OF THEM.

103
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,708
THEY'D DO IT FOR US.

104
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,958
- Carla: I MAY HAVE ONLY
RECENTLY STUMBLED INTO

105
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,166
BEING A MEMBER OF FAIRY TAIL,

106
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,291
BUT I AM INDEED
A PART OF THE GUILD.

107
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,875
AND LIKE I SAID,
I'M INDIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE

108
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,208
FOR WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.

109
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,625
SO I'M NOT COMPLETELY AGAINST
TAKING YOU THERE.

110
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,125
BUT, IF I AM TO DO THIS,

111
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:31,125
I WILL NEED TO LAY DOWN
A FEW VERY FIRM GROUND RULES.

112
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:34,125
BY RETURNING TO EDOLAS,
I WILL BE ABANDONING MY MISSION,

113
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:37,125
ONE HANDED DOWN
BY THE KINGDOM ITSELF.

114
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:40,000
A TRAITOR. I CANNOT RISK
BEING SPOTTED BY ANYONE

115
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,208
WHO WOULD KNOW MY IDENTITY.

116
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,375
WE WILL ALL NEED TO
BE IN DISGUISE.

117
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,375
- EVEN ME?

118
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,333
- YOU SURE YOU WANNA DO
THIS, CARLA?

119
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:50,250
- I AM. I'VE MADE UP MY MIND.

120
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,458
AND LISTEN, TOMCAT,
ANOTHER RULE IS

121
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,666
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY
NOT TO PRY INTO THE DETAILS

122
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,791
OF OUR MISSION.

123
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,791
- AYE.

124
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,125
- THIRDLY, ASIDE FROM
THE INFORMATION

125
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,708
I WAS GIVEN AT BIRTH,
I KNOW NOTHING

126
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,333
ABOUT THE LAYOUT OF EDOLAS.

127
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,166
I CANNOT BE THE NAVIGATOR.

128
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,125
- GOT IT!

129
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,333
- AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,

130
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,625
SHOULD I OR THE TOMCAT DO
ANYTHING THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE

131
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,541
A BETRAYAL TOWARDS YOU,

132
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,666
KILL US WITHOUT
ANY HESITATION.

133
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:25,958
- ( stomach growling )

134
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,875
- BUT THAT'S CRAZY.
I WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING TO...

135
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,041
- STOP THAT DISGUSTING
BODILY NOISE.

136
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:41,583
LET'S GO.
TOMCAT, HOLD ONTO NATSU.

137
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,083
- WE'RE GONNA FLY THERE?

138
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,958
- WE HAVE WINGS
FOR THAT REASON

139
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:48,166
SO WE COULD ONE DAY RETURN TO
OUR HOMELAND IN EDOLAS.

140
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,791
- ALL RIGHT THEN, LITTLE BUDDY.

141
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,458
YOU'RE GONNA SHOW ME
WHERE YOU CAME FROM.

142
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:57,750
- AYE, SIR!

143
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,333
- TOMCAT, DON'T HOLD BACK
YOUR MAGIC POWER.

144
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:07,583
- AYE!

145
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,125
- ( Wendy and Natsu screaming )

146
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,583
- WE'LL ENTER EDOLAS THROUGH
WHAT REMAINS OF THE ANIMA.

147
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,500
WHEN I GIVE THE SIGNAL,
GIVE IT EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT.

148
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,583
- ( both grunting )

149
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,458
- ( screaming )

150
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,750
- NOW!

151
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,166
- ( gasping )

152
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,833
- ARE WE THERE YET?

153
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,250
( gasping )

154
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:25,500
( Natsu laughing )

155
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,958
- WE'RE ACTUALLY HERE.
WE MADE IT.

156
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,791
- MY ROOTS. MY HOMELAND.

157
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,875
- LOOK AT ALL THESE
FLOATING ISLANDS.

158
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,041
- YOU COME FROM A PRETTY COOL
PLACE, HAPPY. DON'T YOU THINK?

159
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,083
- I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT TO THINK.

160
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:10,041
- IT'S SO STRANGE
AND WONDROUS.

161
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,958
- I'VE NEVER EVEN SEEN
TREES LIKE THESE.

162
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,875
- OH, WOW! CHECK IT OUT,
HAPPY. YOU SEE?

163
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,541
THERE'S A RIVER IN THE SKY.

164
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,541
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

165
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:25,375
- OKAY. EVERYONE GET A GRIP
ON YOURSELF.

166
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,541
REMEMBER WE'RE NOT
HERE ON A SIGHTSEEING TRIP.

167
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,833
SO BE SURE TO KEEP YOUR WITS
ABOUT YOU.

168
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,541
- ( chuckles ) I KNOW,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

169
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,833
- SORRY, SORRY.

170
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,166
- ( all screaming )

171
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,458
- ( Natsu grunting )

172
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,125
- MY WINGS DON'T WORK.

173
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,416
- HOW COME YOU CAN'T
FLY ANYMORE?

174
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,916
- I TOLD YOU, MAGIC IS A
LIMITED RESOURCE IN THIS WORLD.

175
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,666
- OH YEAH, CARLA, YOU'RE RIGHT.

176
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,083
AND I GUESS I DO FEEL A
LITTLE STRANGE.

177
00:11:56,791 --> 00:12:00,375
- LET'S GO. WE GOTTA FIND
WHERE THEY TOOK ALL OUR FRIENDS!

178
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,666
- HOW WILL WE FIND 'EM IF
NO ONE KNOWS THEIR WAY AROUND?

179
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,500
- PIECE OF CAKE.
JUST FOLLOW MY NOSE.

180
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,041
( sniffing )

181
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,666
UH, WELL, THIS IS CRAPPY.

182
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,166
THERE ARE SO MANY CRAZY
NEW SMELLS HERE,

183
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,833
MY NOSE IS CONFUSED.

184
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,416
- YEAH, IT'S WEIRD.
THE AIR IN THIS PLACE

185
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,458
IS LIKE NOTHING I'VE
EVER TASTED BEFORE.

186
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,708
- Natsu: OH, DOES THAT MEAN THE
FIRE WILL TASTE DIFFERENT?

187
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,541
- Carla: HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

188
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,500
- Happy: ALL THIS TALK ABOUT
TASTING MAKES ME EVEN HUNGRIER.

189
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,083
- Wendy: I DON'T KNOW WHAT
WE COULD EAT HERE.

190
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,208
- Carla: WE'RE IN
A STRANGE WORLD

191
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,291
AND ALL YOU CAN THINK
ABOUT IS FOOD?

192
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:37,291
- Wendy: SO, WHERE ARE WE
GOING, ANYWAY?

193
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,166
- Natsu: BEATS ME. WE GOTTA
WALK SOMEWHERE, RIGHT?

194
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,750
SO WHY NOT THIS WAY?

195
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,416
- Happy: I WAS AFRAID YOU WERE
GONNA SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

196
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,416
- Carla: SURPRISING AS IT IS,
THE FIRE BREATHER IS RIGHT.

197
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,875
- ( stomach growling )

198
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,166
- Carla: STOP THAT!

199
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,000
- Natsu: OH, MY BAD.

200
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,166
- THERE'S NO ONE HERE.

201
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,625
WE HAVEN'T RUN INTO
A SINGLE PERSON.

202
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,916
- IS IT SOME KINDA
FOREST WORLD?

203
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,833
- SURELY NOT. WE'LL STILL
NEED DISGUISES.

204
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,916
- BUT FROM WHERE?
THERE'S NOTHING.

205
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,458
- HEY!

206
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:12,541
- Happy: UH, NATSU.
I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THIS.

207
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,500
- ( Natsu and Wendy laughing )

208
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,125
- Happy: BOO.

209
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,958
I DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY
WE'RE BEING DISGUISED AS.

210
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,291
- Natsu: WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

211
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,458
YOU LOOK LIKE A THING THAT
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE HAPPY.

212
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,875
RELAX, NO ONE'S GONNA
RECOGNIZE YOU.

213
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:33,333
- IT'S SO EMBARRASSING.

214
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:37,166
- FASHION SENSE ASIDE, I DO FEEL
QUITE A BIT MORE AT EASE NOW.

215
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:42,125
- YOU DO? NOT ME.

216
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,166
IT'S HOT AND ITCHY
IN THIS GETUP.

217
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,750
I THINK I'M ALLERGIC TO IT.

218
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,833
- PLEASE TRY TO TOUGHEN
UP, TOMCAT!

219
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:50,500
- AYE.

220
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:59,083
- ( gasps ) IT'S THAT
FLYING RIVER.

221
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:02,000
- I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE IT BEFORE.

222
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,833
- THIS JUST REMINDS ME HOW
HUNGRY I AM.

223
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,208
- I SAID, TOUGHEN UP.

224
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,000
- ( stomach growling )

225
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,875
I BET THERE'S TONS OF
YUMMY FISH SWIMMING

226
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,041
IN THAT FLYING RIVER.

227
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,083
- THERE'S A MAN OVER THERE!

228
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,583
- HE MUST BE AN
EDOLAS NATIVE.

229
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,583
- Wendy: THANK GOODNESS.
HE LOOKS LIKE A NORMAL PERSON.

230
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,166
- Happy: WHAT DID YOU EXPECT
PEOPLE HERE TO LOOK LIKE?

231
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:28,083
HE'S GOT THE RIGHT IDEA, THOUGH.
WE SHOULD BE FISHING RIGHT NOW.

232
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,000
- Wendy: HEY, WHERE DID
NATSU GO?

233
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,375
- Natsu: YO!
- ( all gasping )

234
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,208
- LEMME ASK YOU SOMETHIN'!
- ( man screaming )

235
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,208
- OF COURSE.
- WHAT IS HE DOING?

236
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,000
- SCARING THE LOCALS.

237
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,458
- I'M LOOKIN' FOR A
BUNCH OF WIZARDS

238
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,083
FROM THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD.

239
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,791
YOU SEEN THEM AROUND ANYWHERE?

240
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,708
- ( screaming ) PLEASE.
DON'T HURT ME.

241
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,000
- WAIT. HOLD ON.

242
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,875
WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?
I JUST WANTED A LITTLE HELP.

243
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,250
- THINK BEFORE YOU ACT.

244
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,041
YOU WALKED UP TO SOMEONE MINDING
THEIR OWN BUSINESS,

245
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,916
WHILE WEARING THAT
RIDICULOUS OUTFIT

246
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,375
AND THEN STARTED TALKING
ABOUT FAIRY TAILS.

247
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,791
OF COURSE YOU SCARED HIM.

248
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,583
- OKAY, THEN HOW DO YOU
SUGGEST THAT WE FIND EVERYONE?

249
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,416
- YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO...

250
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,583
- LISTEN. IF THAT MAN
REPORTS US TO THE AUTHORITIES,

251
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,916
WE'RE THROUGH.

252
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,541
- LET'S DITCH THE COSTUMES
THEN, PLEASE.

253
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,083
- Carla: NOW WE'RE IN EVEN MORE
OF A HURRY TO FIND THEM.

254
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:17,291
- Happy: ( sighs ) THIS FEELS
A MILLION TIMES BETTER.

255
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,125
BUT I REALLY WISH THAT GUY
HADN'T RUN OFF

256
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,416
WITH HIS FISHING ROD.

257
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,666
- Natsu: OH, DID I MESS
THAT UP, TOO?

258
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,750
- Wendy: HEY, DID ANYONE
ELSE HEAR A WEIRD NOISE

259
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:25,875
JUST A SECOND AGO?

260
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,250
- Natsu: OH, ANOTHER FISHERMAN?

261
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,250
THIS GUY'LL KNOW
SOMETHING, FOR SURE.

262
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,000
- Carla: IS THERE A BRAIN
IN YOUR HEAD?

263
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,083
- Happy: WHOA, BIG FISHY ALERT!

264
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:39,000
- Natsu: AWESOME! NOW STAND BACK
WHILE I GRAB US DINNER.

265
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,458
- ( growling )
- All: IT'S HUGE!

266
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,833
- ( all exclaiming )

267
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,583
- TOO HUGE!

268
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,541
- WE WON'T GO HUNGRY
ATLEAST. I'M ALL FIRED UP.

269
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,625
- NATSU. WE DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH TIME TO CATCH HIM.

270
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,833
- ALL I NEED IS JUST
A COUPLE OF SECONDS.

271
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,708
( grunting )

272
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,208
FIRE DRAGON IRON FIST.

273
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,125
WHAT?

274
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,791
- Wendy: NATSU.
- Happy: NATSU.

275
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,625
- ( groans ) MY FIRE'S PUT OUT.

276
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,208
- HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU?

277
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,833
YOU CAN'T USE MAGIC IN EDOLAS

278
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,250
LIKE YOU CAN IN OUR WORLD.

279
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,583
- ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DO.

280
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,208
- LET'S RUN FOR IT!

281
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,041
- IT CAN RUN ON LAND?

282
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,458
- THIS PLACE IS
REALLY GONNA SUCK

283
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:20,958
IF WE CAN'T USE OUR MAGIC HERE!

284
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,125
- AND IT TOOK ALL THIS TO
MAKE YOU REALIZE THAT, NATSU?

285
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,291
- HEY, GUYS, I'M AFRAID
THAT RUNNING AROUND SCREAMING

286
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,291
AND BEING CHASED BY
THIS MONSTER IS GONNA ATTRACT

287
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,875
A LOT OF UNWANTED ATTENTION.

288
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,875
- WELL, THIS WAS THE MONSTER'S
GENIUS IDEA, SO DON'T BLAME ME.

289
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,875
( exclaims ) OH, JUST GREAT.

290
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,375
- IT'S A DEAD END.

291
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,291
- PLEASE, HAPPY, YOU GOTTA
FLY US OUTTA HERE.

292
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,958
- I CAN'T USE MAGIC, EITHER.

293
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,875
- ( all screaming )

294
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:51,708
- HOLY CRAP. NOT HAVING
MAGIC IS SUPER HARD.

295
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,625
- I'M JUST GLAD THAT
EVERYONE'S OKAY.

296
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,041
- I'D BE A HECK OF A LOT BETTER

297
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,541
WITH A BUNCH OF
FISH IN MY TUMMY.

298
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,708
- WELL, I'VE HAD MORE THAN
MY FILL OF FOOLISHNESS TODAY.

299
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,208
- HUH?

300
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,291
- THIS WOULD BE MUCH EASIER
IF YOU DIDN'T CAUSE A RUCKUS

301
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,458
EVERYWHERE YOU GO.

302
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:04,583
- NOW BE NICE.

303
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,416
- SO IT'S MY FAULT. REALLY?

304
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,000
- YOU CERTAINLY PLAY A
LARGE PART IN OUR TROUBLES.

305
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,875
WE NO LONGER HAVE DISGUISES.

306
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,875
IF PEOPLE FROM THE KINGDOM
DISCOVER US ROAMING AROUND,

307
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,333
THERE'S NO TELLING
WHAT THEY'LL DO.

308
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,958
AND IF WE GET TAKEN
INTO CUSTODY,

309
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,958
YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT
SAVING THE OTHERS.

310
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:22,166
WE'LL HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR
US TRYING TO SAVE OUR OWN SKINS.

311
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,333
- OKAY. I DON'T REALLY GET IT,

312
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,083
BUT I GUESS IT'S ALL
MY FAULT SOMEHOW.

313
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,500
- HOW DOES ANYTHING
EVER GET THROUGH

314
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,083
THAT THICK SKULL OF YOURS.

315
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,125
- PLEASE TAKE IT EASY
ON HIM, CARLA.

316
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,916
NATSU'S A NICE GUY,
AND HE DIDN'T MEAN

317
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,041
TO DO ANYTHING WRONG.

318
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,625
- MY WHOLE POINT IS HE
HAS NO CONTROL.

319
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,166
- ( stomach growling )

320
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:45,083
- LIFE CAN GET PRETTY WEIRD
SOMETIMES. DON'T YOU THINK?

321
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,416
- WHAT, IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MAKE ME

322
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,000
FEEL BETTER OR SOMETHING?

323
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,375
AND SINCE WE'RE SNEAKIN' AROUND,
TELL YOUR STOMACH TO BE QUIET.

324
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,500
- UH-OH.

325
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,916
- WHAT'S WRONG?

326
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,583
- WE'VE BEEN SPOTTED AGAIN.

327
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,833
- WELL. WHAT SHOULD WE
DO NOW?

328
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:04,291
- I, UH... HELLO, WE'RE
NOT FROM AROUND THESE PARTS

329
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,083
AND WE SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN
A LITTLE LOST IN THIS FOREST.

330
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:10,375
- WE'RE SORRY.
IT'S NOT OUR FAULTS, WE SWEAR.

331
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,250
- UH...

332
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,375
- MIGHTY EXCEED,
PLEASE FORGIVE US

333
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,958
AND LET US LEAVE WITH OUR LIVES.

334
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,500
- EXCEED?

335
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,208
- I WONDER WHO THEY'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

336
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,291
- HMM.

337
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,000
- YO!
- DON'T SCARE 'EM, NATSU.

338
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,666
- WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE WE
CAN AVOID THEM NOW, HUH?

339
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,333
I GOT SOMETHIN' IMPORTANT
TO ASK YOU GUYS

340
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,958
SO LISTEN CLOSELY, OKAY?

341
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,625
SOME OF OUR FRIENDS
ARE HERE IN EDOLAS AND...

342
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,416
- ( screaming )

343
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,916
- All: PLEASE DON'T HURT US!

344
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,583
- WELL, EXCUSE ME.

345
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,333
- IT'S STRANGE. BUT I THINK
THOSE PEOPLE SEEMED TO BE

346
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,333
AFRAID OF HAPPY AND CARLA.

347
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:46,083
- RIGHT? I KNEW IT WASN'T
ALL MY FAULT.

348
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,166
- TELL ME THE TRUTH. AM I
REALLY THAT SCARY LOOKING?

349
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,791
- YOU LOOKED LIKE YOU WERE
GONNA EAT 'EM.

350
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,083
- NO, I DIDN'T.

351
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,916
- WHOA!
- NOW WHAT'S HAPPENING?

352
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,875
- I DON'T THINK THIS IS
GONNA BE GOOD GUYS.

353
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,250
- ( all screaming )

354
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,583
- Wendy: I DON'T WANNA
FALL ANYMORE.

355
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:11,833
- Carla: THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH
FOR ME.

356
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,500
- WHERE ARE WE NOW?

357
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,625
- IT'S LIKE SOME KIND OF
WEIRD WAREHOUSE.

358
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,416
- ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE WE'RE
WELL BEYOND THE POINT

359
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,125
OF TAKING PREVENTIVE MEASURES,

360
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,916
LET'S SEE IF THERE ARE ANY
CLOTHES IN HERE

361
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,833
THAT WE COULD USE TO
DISGUISE OURSELVES.

362
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,500
- ( Natsu grunting )

363
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,875
WHOA! THEY'VE GOT LOADS
OF COOL STUFF HERE.

364
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,666
- NATSU, WOULD YOU PLEASE
NOT LOOK THIS WAY FOR A MINUTE?

365
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,958
- AWESOME HEADGEAR!

366
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,791
- I SUPPOSE THIS'LL DO
FOR NOW.

367
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:44,041
- OH YEAH. YOU LOOK
BEAUTIFUL, MY FINE FELINE.

368
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,333
- ( scoffs )

369
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,000
- ( gasping )

370
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,416
- YOU SEE SOMETHING
OUT THERE?

371
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,583
- ( exclaims ) IT'S FAIRY TAIL!

372
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,000
IT'S IN DISGUISE, TOO,

373
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,000
BUT I'D RECOGNIZE IT ANYWHERE.
THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE.

374
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,416
- HOLD ON!
- WAIT FOR US!

375
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,583
- HONESTLY!

376
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,375
- THIS DISGUISE IS WAY
TOO HEAVY!

377
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,208
- ( all gasping )

378
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,875
- ( people chattering )

379
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,833
- THEY'RE OKAY!

380
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,625
- AND IT WASN'T EVEN THAT
MUCH TROUBLE TO FIND 'EM.

381
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,208
- IS IT JUST ME, OR DOES
SOMETHING SEEM KINDA DIFFERENT?

382
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,500
- WHO CARES ABOUT THAT,
THEY'RE HERE.

383
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,125
- YEAH, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

384
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:35,125
- NO, HE'S NOT. THERE IS
SOMETHING WRONG HERE.

385
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,875
- Happy: HEY, LOOK.
HERE'S THE REQUEST BOARD.

386
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,916
- Natsu: SEEMS NORMAL
ENOUGH TO ME.

387
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,708
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
WE HAVE TO TRY TO PRETEND

388
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,125
LIKE WE'RE NOT REALLY HERE.

389
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,625
- LOOK AND YOU'LL SEE.

390
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,875
- Natsu: YEAH. SEE WHAT?

391
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,625
- WELL, I'M OFF. I JUST TOOK
ON A PRETTY MAJOR JOB.

392
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,083
- TAKE CARE.

393
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,166
- JUVIA, MY BELOVED.
PLEASE, WAIT.

394
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,166
IF YOU'RE GONNA GO OUT,
PLEASE TAKE ME WITH YOU.

395
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,541
PRETTY PLEASE?

396
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,083
- YOU'RE SUCH A WET BLANKET

397
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,250
AND TAKE TAKE SOME OF THOSE
CLOTHES OFF FOR A CHANGE.

398
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,708
- WHAT?

399
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,708
- GIVE ME A SHOUT WHEN YOU
HAVE YOUR SUMMER WARDROBE.

400
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,625
- I JUST GET REALLY COLD.

401
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,041
- HE NEEDS TO LEARN
A THING OR TWO

402
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,416
ABOUT BEIN' CLINGY.

403
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,083
- THE POOR GUY IS HEAD OVER
HEELS IN LOVE WITH HER

404
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,166
AND JUST DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH HIMSELF.

405
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,416
- WHAT THE HECK IS
GOING ON?

406
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,500
- I'M TIRED OF YOUR
EXCUSES, ELFMAN.

407
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,708
- YOU ACTUALLY
BUNGLED UP ANOTHER JOB?

408
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,000
- IT'S SO EMBARRASSING.

409
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,958
- JET AND DROY MAY BE OUR
STRONGEST MEMBERS,

410
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,375
BUT THEY DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO

411
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,958
SCOLD THE WEAKER ONES.
ELFMAN'S JUST NOT THAT CAPABLE.

412
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,250
- LAY OFF HIM, YOU TWO!

413
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,625
- GOT A JOB TO DO.

414
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,541
- MAN, DOES THAT GUY EVER
TAKE A BREAK?

415
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,250
- HIM? NEVER.

416
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,208
- MISS CANA, WOULD YOU CARE TO
JOIN US FOR AN ADULT BEVERAGE?

417
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,166
- YEAH, TIP ONE BACK AND RELAX!

418
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,833
- OH, DON'T BE SO
SILLY, YOU TWO.

419
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:47,708
I'VE NEVER HAD A DROP OF ALCOHOL
IN MY LIFE, SO WHY START NOW?

420
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,375
- HEY, MY HOT BISCUIT.

421
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,958
- ALLEY CAT.
MY LITTLE GUNSLINGER.

422
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,041
- ( Wendy exclaiming )

423
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,583
- YOU HAVE REALLY GOTTA
MAN UP!

424
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,291
- ( crying ) I KNOW, I'M SORRY.

425
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,500
- AND QUIT SAYING THAT
YOU'RE SORRY ALL THE TIME.

426
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,541
- I WANNA DECLARE MY LOVE
HERE AND NOW FOR JUVIA.

427
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,333
- I SWEAR, GRAY, YOU'RE GONNA
SMOTHER THAT POOR GIRL.

428
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:08,583
- YEAH. SOMETHING IS
DEFINITELY WRONG HERE.

429
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:11,416
- EVERYBODY IS ACTING
CRAZIER THAN NORMAL.

430
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,625
- HEY, WHAT THE HECK
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOIN'?

431
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,041
- ( all gasping )

432
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:20,666
- WHAT?

433
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,166
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

434
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,083
- WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA WITH YOU
SNEAKIN' AROUND

435
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:27,416
OUR GUILD LIKE THIS?

436
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,375
- LUCY.

437
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,125
- SERIOUSLY?

438
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:32,833
- I'M SCARED, CARLA.

439
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:35,500
- DON'T WORRY, CHILD,
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

440
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:38,416
BUT WHAT THE DEVIL
IS GOING ON HERE?

441
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:41,958
- ( theme song playing )

442
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,000
- ( singing in Japanese )

443
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,708
- Natsu: WHAT GIVES.
EVERYBODY'S PERSONALITIES

444
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,291
HAVE GONE TOTALLY
WHACK-A-DOODLE!

445
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:17,875
- Happy: MAYBE EDOLAS
HAS SOME KINDA

446
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:20,166
PERSONALITY REVERSAL SPELL
ON IT LIKE NIRVANA.

447
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,875
- Natsu: GRAY'S WEARING
A MILLION LAYERS,

448
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:23,666
ELFMAN'S ACTING LIKE
A GREAT BIG WEENIE,

449
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,708
AND LEVY IS SOME KINDA STREET
THUG? THIS PLACE IS THE COOLEST.

450
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:28,041
- Happy: I JUST THOUGHT
OF SOMETHING,

451
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:30,833
I WONDER WHAT THE BIZARRO
ERZA'S GONNA BE LIKE.

452
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:33,375
- Both: NEXT TIME FAIRY HUNTER!

453
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:35,000
- Natsu: YEAH, ME TOO.

454
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:37,208
LIKE WHAT WOULD BE THE OPPOSITE
OF SUCH A HARDCORE CHICK?

455
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:39,125
- Happy: SHE'S PROBABLY ALL
SWEET AND SAYS THINGS LIKE,

456
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:40,916
"WELCOME HOME, MASTER!"
