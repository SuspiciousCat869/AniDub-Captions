1
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,791
- HEY, GUYS.  READY FOR
SOME MORE "FAIRY TAIL"?

2
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,791
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING,

3
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,375
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE ROOM,

4
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:26,166
AND DON'T SIT TOO CLOSE
TO THE TV.

5
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:29,625
- Lucy:
PREVIOUSLY ON "FAIRY TAIL."

6
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,208
- Happy:
WE WENT ALL OUT ON OUR BATTLE

7
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,000
AGAINST THE PHANTOM LORD GUILD.

8
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,583
BUT THEY STILL
SNATCHED UP LUCY

9
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:36,375
AND MASTER LOST ALL
HIS MAGICAL POWER. 

10
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,166
OH NO!

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,000
RESCUING LUCY
WASN'T AN EASY TASK,

12
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,541
BUT WE DID IT!

13
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,541
- 'CAUSE I--
I LOVE BEING IN FAIRY TAIL.

14
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,375
( cries )

15
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,875
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

16
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,916
- Lucy: HIDDEN AWAY
IN MAGNOLIA'S EAST FOREST

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,083
YOU'LL FIND A TREE HOUSE
WHERE AN OLD FRIEND

18
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,916
OF MASTER MAKAROV LIVES.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,333
PORLYUSICA IS
A HIGHLY SKILLED HEALER,

20
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,333
BUT SHE LIVES
A LIFE OF SECLUSION

21
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,416
BECAUSE OF HER
HATRED OF MANKIND.

22
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,333
HER SPECIALTY
IS IN THE TREATMENT

23
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,625
OF AILMENTS THAT WERE
CAUSED BY MAGIC.

24
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:40,958
WHICH IS WHY THE MASTER 
HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO HER.

25
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,458
- WHAT'D YOU DO THAT FOR?

26
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,791
- HEY!  WE WANTED YOU
TO CURE OUR MASTER,

27
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,458
NOT MAKE HIM WORSE.

28
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,375
- IT'S WHAT HE DESERVES
FOR PUSHING HIMSELF

29
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,000
SO HARD AT HIS AGE.

30
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,958
HONESTLY,
YOU'RE SUCH AN OLD FOOL.

31
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,708
DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD
BE LEAVING NOW?!

32
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,375
I'M SICK OF LOOKING AT YOU.

33
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,958
- WELL, CAN YOU AT LEAST
TELL US WHAT HIS CONDITION IS?

34
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,791
- WE WANT TO HELP YOU
TAKE CARE OF HIM.

35
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,375
- JUST GO HOME.

36
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,791
THOSE RIDICULOUSLY
WORRIED FACES OF YOURS

37
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:12,041
WILL ONLY AGGRAVATE
HIS CONDITION.

38
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,958
THESE SYMPTOMS SUGGEST
A POWERFUL WIND SPELL WAS USED.

39
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,791
MY GUESS,
THE SPELL KNOWN AS "DRAIN."

40
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,875
THIS TERRIBLE SPELL

41
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,625
DRAINS ITS VICTIM
OF ALL THEIR MAGIC ABILITIES.

42
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,916
THEIR POWERS THEN
DRIFT ALONG THE WINDS

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,166
UNTIL THEY HAVE
DISSIPATED COMPLETELY.

44
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,583
IF ONLY YOU'D GATHERED
MAKAROV'S POWERS

45
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:32,833
WHEN THEY WERE
INITIALLY DRAINED,

46
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,583
HE COULD HAVE
RECOVERED QUICKLY.

47
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:38,000
BUT AS THINGS STAND NOW,
IT'LL TAKE QUITE A BIT LONGER.

48
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,083
- HOW LONG DO YOU THINK?

49
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,416
- I'M SURE THE OTHERS
WILL WANT TO KNOW.

50
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,833
- WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?!
- AHH!

51
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,666
- I'M SORRY, BUT I THOUGHT
YOU WERE TALKING TO US

52
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,083
ALL THIS TIME, MA'AM.

53
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,000
- OF COURSE I WASN'T!
I CAN'T STAND THE STINK OF YOU.

54
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,750
GET OUT OF HERE, ALREADY.
GO ON, MOVE IT.  SHOO SHOO!

55
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,000
- BYE, NOW.
- REAL NICE TALKING TO YOU.

56
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,583
- WAIT FOR ME!

57
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,458
- ( labored breathing )

58
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,166
- Porlyusica: YOU'VE ALWAYS 
BEEN QUITE THE TROUBLEMAKER,

59
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,166
HAVEN'T YOU?

60
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,791
A WIZARD'S MAGIC
IS INTERTWINED

61
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,041
WITH THE VERY ESSENCE
OF HIS LIFE.

62
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,208
THE GREATER HIS POWER,
THE MORE DEVASTATING

63
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,833
THE DRAIN SPELL WILL BE.

64
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,458
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
FIGHT WITH ALL YOU'VE GOT

65
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,708
OR THIS MAY VERY WELL
BE YOUR DEATHBED.

66
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:24,708
YOU REALLY ARE SUCH
A PIG-HEADED OLD FOOL.

67
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,000
- ( Happy speaking )

68
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,458
- MAN, THIS STINKS.

69
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,375
- I CAN'T BELIEVE 
WE HAD TO RETREAT.

70
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,875
- IT'S JUST NOT FAIR.
- WE SHOULD GO BACK. 

71
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,208
WE HAVE TO GET REVENGE
FOR WHAT THEY DID TO LEVY.

72
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,791
- WE'LL MAKE THEM PAY!

73
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,625
- OKAY, SO THEIR
HEADQUARTERS IS HERE.

74
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,416
SO I'M THINKING WE SHOULD
TRY AND HIT THEM

75
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,541
WITH SOME LONG RANGE SPELLS
FROM THIS SOUTHEAST HILL.

76
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,666
- I'M BRINGING OUT ALL MY
EXPLOSIVE LACRIMAS NEXT TIME.

77
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,833
- HEY GUYS!  I'M GONNA
NEED SOME SPELL BOOKS 

78
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,166
FOR A HOLDER-TYPE MAGIC
FROM THE ARCHIVES.

79
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,500
- DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL GET THEM BACK FOR THIS.

80
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,125
- ( sighs )

81
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:11,791
I KNOW.
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT.

82
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,333
IT'S JUST...

83
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,916
ALL MY FAULT.

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,666
- BEING TARGETED
BY DANGEROUS PEOPLE

85
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,000
IS JUST ONE OF THE DOWNSIDES
OF BEING RICH.

86
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:25,416
AT LEAST YOU'RE PROTECTED
BY A REAL MAN LIKE ME.

87
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,291
- HEY, WOULD YOU
GIVE IT A REST ALREADY?

88
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,041
- I GOTTA SAY, I WAS SHOCKED
WHEN I HEARD THE NEWS.

89
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,000
WHY'D YOU HIDE
THE TRUTH FROM US, LUCY?

90
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,541
- I WASN'T TRYING
TO HIDE ANYTHING.

91
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,541
I MEAN, THERE'S NO WAY
TO BRING UP THE FACT

92
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,125
THAT I'M A RUNAWAY
IN CASUAL CONVERSATION.

93
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,875
I'VE BEEN GONE FOR A YEAR,

94
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,125
AND MY FATHER HASN'T CARED.

95
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,125
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN HE WANTS
TO FORCE ME TO COME HOME?

96
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,875
HE'S DONE ALL THOSE
HORRIBLE THINGS

97
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,666
JUST TO GET ME TO GO BACK.

98
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,291
I HATE HIS GUTS!

99
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,875
STILL, IF I HADN'T
RUN AWAY IN THE FIRST PLACE,

100
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,875
NONE OF THIS WOULD 
HAVE EVER HAPPENED.

101
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,708
- COME ON.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

102
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,125
YOUR DAD'S THE ONE TO BLAME.

103
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,791
- IDIOT.
- UH...

104
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,041
I MEAN,
IT'S PHANTOM'S FAULT.

105
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,458
- Lucy: NO.  I'M THE ONE WHO 
BROUGHT TROUBLE TO THE GUILD,

106
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:12,541
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE
OF MY OWN SELFISH CHOICES.

107
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,583
I'M SO VERY SORRY.

108
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,083
I'M JUST GONNA GO BACK HOME,

109
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,250
AND HOPEFULLY ALL THIS
WILL BE OVER WITH.

110
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,750
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

111
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,166
I CAN'T SEE YOU PLAYING
THE PART OF THE PRETTY PRINCESS

112
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,666
SITTING AROUND
IN YOUR MANSION.

113
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,750
- LAUGHING WITH US
IN THIS FILTHY GUILD HALL,

114
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:31,166
GOING ON ADVENTURES EVEN THOUGH
YOU FREAK OUT ALL THE TIME,

115
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,750
THAT'S WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

116
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,458
- ( sighs )

117
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,083
- YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO STAY WITH US, RIGHT?

118
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:40,500
WHY WOULD YOU EVER GO BACK
TO THE PLACE YOU RAN AWAY FROM?

119
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,750
COME ON.
WHO ARE YOU TRYING TO KID?

120
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,875
YOU'RE LUCY OF FAIRY TAIL.

121
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:49,500
NO MORE RUNNING
'CAUSE YOU BELONG HERE WITH US.

122
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,333
- ( crying )

123
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,791
- AH, DON'T CRY.
IT'S JUST NOT LIKE YOU.

124
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,750
- YEAH, PLEASE. REAL MEN
ARE WEAK TO WOMANLY TEARS.

125
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,291
- SORRY.

126
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,375
- COME ON. I'M NOT
GETTING ANY KIND OF READ

127
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,958
ON WHERE MYSTOGAN IS.

128
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,125
- OH DEAR.
YOU DID YOUR BEST.

129
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,625
- IF LUCY'S THEIR REAL TARGET,
THEY'RE BOUND TO ATTACK,

130
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,458
AND I WOULD BET IT'S
SOONER THAN LATER.

131
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,125
RIGHT NOW WE'VE JUST
GOT TOO MANY WOUNDED

132
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,875
TO PUT UP MUCH OF A FIGHT.

133
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,791
- MASTER'S SERIOUSLY INJURED.

134
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,791
AND WE CAN'T SEEM TO
LOCATE MYSTOGAN.

135
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,833
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE LEFT
THAT WE CAN TURN TO.

136
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,125
HELP US, LAXUS.

137
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,458
- ( groans )

138
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,500
- WE COULD REALLY 
USE YOU ABOUT NOW.

139
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,500
FAIRY TAIL IS IN
TERRIBLE DANGER.

140
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:45,666
- MAN, MAKAROV IS FREAKING
PATHETIC. ( laughs )

141
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,666
I DON'T SEE HOW THIS IS
REMOTELY MY PROBLEM.

142
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,208
YOU'RE BIG GIRLS
SO DEAL WITH IT YOURSELVES.

143
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,666
- SO YOU'RE NOT
GONNA HELP US? 

144
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,791
- OF COURSE NOT.
WHY WOULD I?

145
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,250
THAT SENILE OLD TOAD
STARTED THIS.

146
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:00,333
WHY DO I HAVE TO BE THE ONE
TO CLEAN UP HIS MESS?

147
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,750
- PLEASE, LAXUS.

148
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,500
PHANTOM'S TRYING
TO KIDNAP LUCY. 

149
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,833
- WHO?
DO I EVEN KNOW HER?

150
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,333
OH WAIT.
IS IT THAT NEW GIRL?

151
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,250
I'LL TELL YOU WANT,
IF YOU CAN TALK BLONDIE

152
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,666
INTO BEING MY WOMAN,
I'LL DO ANYTHING SHE WANTS.

153
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,250
- YOU ARE SUCH A PIG!

154
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,875
- ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO TALK THAT WAY

155
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,958
TO A GUY YOU'RE
BEGGING TO HELP YOU?

156
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,875
DO ME A FAVOR, IF THAT GEEZER
MANAGES TO PULL THROUGH THIS,

157
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,333
TELL HIM HE'S OVER THE HILL AND
HE SHOULD HAND THE GUILD

158
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,208
OVER TO ME.

159
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,083
( laughs )

160
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,833
- ( crying )

161
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:34,291
- MIRA...

162
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,708
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

163
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,041
HOW CAN SOMEONE IN FAIRY TAIL

164
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:42,291
BE SO HEARTLESS AND CRUEL?

165
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,875
I CAN'T JUST
SIT HERE AND WATCH.

166
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,166
I HAVE TO JOIN THE OTHERS
AND FIGHT.

167
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,000
- WAIT.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

168
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,541
- I FEEL TOTALLY USELESS BEING
STUCK HERE AT THE GUILD HALL. 

169
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,375
I WANT TO HELP.
- I UNDERSTAND,

170
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,666
BUT YOU'LL ONLY GET
IN THE WAY AS YOU ARE NOW.

171
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,666
EVEN IF YOU WERE ONCE
AN S-CLASS WIZARD.

172
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,416
- Erza: THE MASTER'S
NOT HERE WITH US.

173
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,250
NEITHER ARE MYSTOGAN
AND LAXUS.

174
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,333
AND SO MANY
OF US ARE WOUNDED.

175
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:16,291
HOW COULD WE POSSIBLY 
HANDLE ANOTHER BATTLE?

176
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,791
WHAT WAS I THINKING?!

177
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,791
WHY DIDN'T I GO WITH HIM?

178
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,791
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

179
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,958
I'M A DISGRACE.

180
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,250
- ( crashing )
- ( gasps )

181
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,750
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

182
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,083
- OUTSIDE!

183
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,458
- ( all exclaiming )

184
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,625
- WHAT IS THAT THING?

185
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:29,000
- IT'S A GUILD HALL 
WITH GINORMOUS LEGS!

186
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,375
- IS IT PHANTOM?

187
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,416
- ( all gasp )

188
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,375
- ( gasps ) 
- HOW DO WE FIGHT THAT THING?

189
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,833
- ( gasps )

190
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,416
- I NEVER ANTICIPATED THIS.

191
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,416
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY'D GO TO SUCH EXTREMES

192
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,375
TO ATTACK US.

193
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:02,583
- THE MAGIC-FOCUSING CANNON,
JUPITER.

194
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,208
ENGAGE.

195
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:29,666
KILL THEM!

196
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,791
- All: YES, SIR!

197
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,208
- RUN!

198
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,416
GET OUT OF HERE NOW!

199
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,291
- ERZA!
- DON'T BE STUPID!

200
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,250
- SHE REQUIPPED.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

201
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,500
- PROTECTING THE GUILD HALL.

202
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,500
- THAT'S HER ADAMANTINE ARMOR.

203
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,666
- IS SHE GONNA TRY TO
BLOCK THE CANNON'S SHOT?

204
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,666
- BUT THERE'S NO WAY
HER ARMOR'S GONNA HOLD UP

205
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,333
AGAINST A BLAST THAT STRONG.

206
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,333
- YOU'RE JUST RISKING YOUR LIFE.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

207
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,041
- JUST STAY BACK!

208
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,500
- ERZA!

209
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:19,750
- WE'RE NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO STOP HER.

210
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:20,916
WE JUST GOTTA
HAVE FAITH IN HER.

211
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,583
- ( gasps )

212
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,208
- NO!
- ( gasps )

213
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,583
- ( grunts )

214
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,916
( shouts )

215
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:50,916
AAH!

216
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,583
- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

217
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,750
SHE ACTUALLY MANAGED
TO STOP IT.

218
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,833
- ONCE AGAIN, ERZA'S THE
MANLIEST ONE IN THE GUILD.

219
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,041
- YEAH, BUT LOOK.

220
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,833
- ( breathes heavily )

221
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,000
- YOU OKAY?

222
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,000
SAY SOMETHING.

223
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,875
- MAKAROV HAS FALLEN.

224
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,250
AND NOW ERZA CAN
NO LONGER STAND.

225
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,333
- ( exhales )

226
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,583
- Jose: ANY CHANCE OF VICTORY

227
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,583
HAS SLIPPED THROUGH
YOUR FINGERS.

228
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,750
SURRENDER LUCY HEARTFILIA
IMMEDIATELY.

229
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,208
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

230
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,833
- THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

231
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,583
- LIKE ANY GUILD WOULD
HAND OVER ONE OF THEIR OWN

232
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,083
TO A MONSTER LIKE YOU.

233
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,125
- YOU HEAR THAT?
LUCY'S STAYING PUT.

234
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,666
- ( all cheering )

235
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,208
- I WON'T ASK AGAIN.

236
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,333
- ( crying )
- ( overlapping shouting )

237
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:06,791
- MAYBE I SHOULD
JUST GO WITH THEM.

238
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,958
GIVE MYSELF UP.

239
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,041
- WE WOULD NEVER
BETRAY HER LIKE THAT!

240
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,541
YOU'D HAVE TO 
KILL US FIRST!

241
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,958
- All: YEAH!

242
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,041
- YOU CAN STOP ASKING NOW,
'CAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA GIVE YOU

243
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,625
ANY OTHER ANSWER!

244
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,000
WE'RE TAKING EVERY ONE
OF YOU JERKS DOWN!

245
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:25,375
- ( all shouting )
- ( crying continues )

246
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:43,333
- ( groans )

247
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,000
IF DEATH IS WHAT YOU WANT,
I'LL GIVE YOU A SECOND HELPING

248
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,250
OF JUPITER!

249
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,583
YOU'VE GOT 15 MINUTES

250
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:52,250
TO PONDER THE FOLLY
OF YOUR ACTIONS!

251
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,416
- NO WAY.
- WHAT'LL WE DO?

252
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,250
- THEY'RE GONNA FIRE
AT US AGAIN?

253
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,083
- ( groans )
- ERZA...

254
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,208
- OH NO.  SHE'S OUT.

255
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:03,083
AND SHE'S THE ONLY REASON THE
REST OF US ARE STILL STANDING

256
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,625
AFTER THAT FIRST SHOT.

257
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,250
- OH NO.  IS HE REALLY GONNA
FIRE THE JUPITER CANNON AGAIN?

258
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,958
- HE'S KICKING US
WHILE WE'RE DOWN.

259
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,541
- YOU'RE IN QUITE
A QUANDARY

260
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,125
AREN'T YOU, FAIRY TAIL?

261
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,291
THERE ARE ONLY TWO WAYS
THIS SITUATION CAN PLAY OUT.

262
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,625
EITHER MY TROOPS WILL
TEAR YOU APART,

263
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,916
OR YOU'LL BE
BLOWN AWAY BY JUPITER.

264
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,416
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

265
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,541
IF HE FIRES AT US,
HE'LL KILL HIS OWN MEN.

266
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,958
- SURELY HE'S BLUFFING.

267
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,708
WHO'D DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

268
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,666
- NO, HE'S GONNA DO IT.
- ( both gasp )

269
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,291
- Cana: THOSE PHANTOM SOLDIERS

270
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,708
WERE CREATED BY
JOSE'S SHADE MAGIC.

271
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,291
THEY'RE NOT HUMAN,
SO IT WON'T MATTER TO HIM

272
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,708
IF THEY'RE DESTROYED.

273
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,375
- WHAT THE HECK ARE
PHANTOM SOLDIERS?

274
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,625
- YOU SAYING THEY'RE GHOSTS?

275
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,791
- WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING

276
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,291
TO TAKE OUT THAT
JUPITER CANNON. 

277
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,291
- I'M GONNA SMASH
THAT THING TO PIECES.

278
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,625
I ONLY GOT 15 MINUTES
TO WRECK IT, RIGHT?

279
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:50,791
- MM-HMM.

280
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,208
- COME ON, HAPPY.

281
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,666
- AYE, SIR!

282
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,291
- OKAY, ELFMAN,
WE'RE GONNA STORM THE PLACE TOO.

283
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,375
- OH YEAH!

284
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,750
- AND WE'RE GONNA STAY HERE

285
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,916
TO PROTECT THE GUILD HALL.
YOU WITH ME?

286
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,916
- All: YEAH!

287
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,875
- LUCY, COME WITH ME.

288
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,666
WE HAVE A HIDEOUT.

289
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,750
I WANT YOU TO STAY THERE
UNTIL THIS IS ALL OVER. 

290
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,291
- NO.

291
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,333
IT'S ALL MY FAULT
THAT WE'RE IN THIS MESS.

292
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,750
I CAN'T JUST ABANDON EVERYONE

293
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,250
WHILE THEY'RE OUT THERE
FIGHTING FOR ME.

294
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,000
- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, LUCY.

295
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,750
I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY,
AND NEITHER DOES ANYONE ELSE.

296
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,583
WE'RE NOT JUST
FIGHTING FOR YOU.

297
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,000
IT'S FOR ALL OF US.

298
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,833
IT'S FOR THE HONOR
OF OUR GUILD.

299
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,666
WE'RE PROUD TO
FIGHT THIS BATTLE,

300
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,666
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US.

301
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,750
PLEASE JUST DO AS I SAY.

302
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:35,750
- ( gasps )

303
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,750
( sighs ) REEDUS,
TAKE HER TO THE HIDEOUT.

304
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,708
- <i>OUI!</i>

305
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,958
- I'M COUNTING ON YOU
TO TAKE CARE OF HER. 

306
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,333
- <i>OUI!</i>

307
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:53,375
- I MAY NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH 
TO JOIN THE OTHERS IN BATTLE,

308
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,750
BUT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS
I CAN HELP MY FRIENDS.

309
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,875
- ( screaming )

310
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,208
- Mirajane: THE JUPITER'S GONNA
FIRE AGAIN IN 14 MINUTES.

311
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,666
- YAH!

312

I FEEL SO WEAK.

318
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,000
I CAN'T EVEN STAND.

319
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,416
- WAKABA!

320
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,291
MAN, WHAT THE HECK
ARE THESE THINGS? 

321
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,500
- WHATEVER YOU DO,

322
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,458
JUST DON'T LET THEM TOUCH YOU.

323
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,916

SHADE MAGIC!

- SO WE JUST DON'T
TOUCH THEM, RIGHT?

328
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,875

A TASTE OF WHAT WE DO.

- MAN, THAT JUST AIN'T FAIR.

340
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,791
- WE CAN'T SEEM
TO CATCH A BREAK.

341
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,250
- THERE'LL BE NO END TO THEM
IF WE FIGHT LIKE THIS.

342
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,041
WHAT'S THAT?

343
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,916
I'VE GOT A BAD FEELING
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

CRAP, I'M BARELY EVEN
SCRATCHING THE SURFACE.

346

HAVE TO DESTROY IT

347
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:35,875
FROM THE INSIDE, HUH?

THAT LACRIMA

355
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,500
TO COLLECT MAGIC ENERGY.

356
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:03,250
- YEAH, BUT WHY DO THEY 
NEED ONE AS BIG AS THAT?

357
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,333
- 'CAUSE MAGIC-FOCUSING CANNONS
DON'T FIRE REGULAR AMMUNITION. 

358
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:09,083
INSTEAD THEY FIRE
CONCENTRATED MAGICAL POWER.

359
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,000
- I DIDN'T GET MOST OF THAT,
BUT ALL WE GOTTA DO

360
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,666
IS DESTROY THAT THING,
DON'T WE?

361
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,958
- I CAN'T ALLOW THAT.

362
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,041
- IS HE A GUARD?

363
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,083
- Natsu: DOESN'T MATTER. 
ANYONE WHO GETS IN MY WAY

364

WHAT YOU THINK.

NOW GET OUT OF MY WAY!

- NATSU,
WHY'D YOU HIT YOURSELF?

370
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,083
- I DIDN'T.
MY FIST JUST WENT CRAZY.

THANKS FOR THE SAVE, CANA.

378
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,541
- YOU CAN'T LET THEM CATCH YOU
WITH YOUR GUARD DOWN.

379
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,166
WE NEED EVERYBODY ON THEIR
FEET TO FIGHT THESE GUYS.

380
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,625
THOSE HEARTLESS CREEPS
IN PHANTOM

381
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,291
DON'T UNDERSTAND 
HOW PAINFUL IT IS

382
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,541
TO WATCH YOUR FRIENDS FALL

383
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,000
OR HAVE YOUR GUILD HALL
DESTROYED.

384
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,583
WHATEVER WE DO,
WE CAN'T ALLOW THEM

385

- ONLY NINE MINUTES UNTIL
JUPITER CAN FIRE AGAIN.

387

I'VE GOT A CANNON TO DEMOLISH.

388
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,750
ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS
SHATTER THE GIANT LACRIMA

389
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,750
AND IT WON'T BE ABLE
TO FIRE ANYMORE.

SHUT UP AND LET ME
DO MY THING!

I DID IT AGAIN.

00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,708
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

FOR NO GOOD REASON.

436
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:17,916
