00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:18,916
[CHAPATI] We're smack
in the middle of

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,166
day four's battle segment!

3
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,833
After Raven Tail
was disqualified,

4
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:24,000
the two Fairy Tail
teams combined into one.

5
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:26,791
Now, Natsu and Gajeel
find themselves up against

6
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,000
Sting and Rogue of Sabertooth!

7
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,875
Since all four of
them are Dragon Slayers,

8
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:33,541
this should prove to be one
remarkably explosive match!

9
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:34,833
Who will be victorious?

10
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:37,291
The Fairies or the Tigers?

11
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,500
[CHAPATI] Whoa! I can't
believe what's happening

12
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:12,416
right before my eyes! The
illustrious Sting and Rogue,

13
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,916
the Twin Dragons of
Fiore's mightiest guild,

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,333
have been overwhelmed
by Fairy Tail!

15
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,166
You guys're tough,
that's for sure.

16
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,625
Makes it more fun.

17
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:21,916
Gajeel.

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,208
Tell me somethin'.
Did you really defeat

19
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,625
your dragons with that
measly power of yours?

20
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,833
We didn't just "defeat" them.

21
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,875
We killed our dragons
with our bare hands!

22
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,583
[NATSU] But didn't you think
of them as your parents, too?

23
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,250
[STING] That's none
of your business.

24
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:39,083
But if you losers want to
see our dragon-slaying power,

25
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,541
I'll be happy to show it to ya!

[MAKAROV] The Twin Dragons of
Sabertooth, Sting and Rogue.

29
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,875
They may be Dragon Slayers,
like Natsu and Gajeel,

30
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,583
but we still know nothing
about their magic.

31
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:10,041
Predicting the outcome of this
fight is all but impossible.

32
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,875
Especially now that
they've finished testing

33
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,416
each other's strengths.

Your dying guild
will be laid to rest.

Ready, Sting?

38

Yep.

[CHAPATI] The intense
staring contest continues!

40
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:30,166
You could cut the tension in
the arena with a butter knife!

41
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,916
[CHAPATI] Who will be
the first to make a move?

42
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:40,166
[CHAPATI] Sabertooth's
Sting springs into action!

43
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,041

barely manages to block!

Salamander!

46

[CHAPATI] Look at that!
No matter what Gajeel tries,

47
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,750
he just can't get an upper
hand on Rogue's Shadow Drive!

48
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,833
Try as you might,
you can't catch a shadow.

They've drastically
increased their power.

I wasn't aware Dragon
Slayers had that ability.

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,625
Show 'em what you
can really do, Natsu!

59
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,416
Didn't anyone tell
you it's bad manners

60
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,375
to hold back when
you're fighting?

61
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,708
[STING] You're one to talk!

62
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,125
What's the deal with that
pitiful defense, huh?

63
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,208
Hmmm. Not looking too good.

64
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,458
They used magic
power amplification.

65
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,791
Add that to their teamwork and
they're practically flawless.

66
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,750
Am I the only one
feelin' let down here?

67
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,125
They're lacking coordination

68
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,250
and even any
semblance of grace.

69
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:59,000
[RUFUS]  It's a wonder that
they've survived this long.

70
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,666
That's the way! You've
got 'em on the ropes!

71
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,000
Now bring it home!

The crowd's excitement
just took a major turn.

78

Are Natsu and
Gajeel in trouble?

79
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,083
The Twin Dragons may
be too much for them.

We cannot lose hope just yet.

Oh crap.

00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,291
Something's up with that punch.

88
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:51,750
It was different from the
other attacks he's used so far.

Wait, different how?

What'd you do to me?

My White Dragon Talon is
infused with Holy magic.

94

[STING] Anyone branded with
its stigmata becomes paralyzed.

Now the real fun begins.
You're my new punching bag!

be able to touch the guy!

105

he can't compare to Gajeel

when it comes to
adaptability in a fight.

00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:37,625
to the might of Sabertooth's
Twin Dragons after all.

318
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,541
Natsu.

319
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:40,708
[LEVY] Oh no.

320
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,250
What do you
think you're doing?

321
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,875
The fight isn't over yet!
You're not allowed to quit!

322
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,541
Even Natsu and Gajeel
can't beat these guys?

323
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:50,250
I was startin' to think
that we had a chance.

324
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:54,708
Get up! Please, you
can't lose like this!

325
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,916
Good fight. That was the
toughest I've ever had.

326
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,708
[STING] Thanks. I mean it.

327
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,958
Are they down for the count?

328
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,875
Quit lying there!
You've got a fight to finish!

329
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,666
Listen to us!
We're right there with you!

330
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,416
[ERZA] You're never alone!

331
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,625
Because you're
part of Fairy Tail!

332
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:20,166
Perhaps I was wrong; he's
nothing special after all.

333
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,541
[ROGUE] Sting.

334
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:27,708
Yeah. I know. Gajeel wasn't
mine to take out. Sorry.

335
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,041
But I finally did it.
I kept my word.

336
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,291
[NATSU] Not so fast, pal.

337
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,375
[BOTH grunt]

338
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:40,833
[CROWD cheering]

339
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,583
Ya hear the crowd? That
sounds pretty encouraging!

340
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,000
They're still in the fight!

341
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,458
I don't know why
we're surprised.

342
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,416
They never learned
how to give up.

343
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,666
It's hard to tell whether
they're tough or just stubborn.

344
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,500
Ya can't keep a
Fairy Tail man down!

345
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,500
See, Levy? There's
nothing to worry about!

346
00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,750
[JET] They heard us calling!

347
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,833
That's the way, Natsu!

348
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:05,125
I knew Gajeel wasn't
out of this yet! Ha!

349
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,291
My head.

350
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,041
I'll be feeling
that for a week.

351
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,041
[CHAPATI] It's as if Sting's
attacks didn't even faze them!

352
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:15,875
Heh. Not bad. But now we've
seen all your little quirks.

353
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:16,875
What?

354
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,375
No!

355
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,125
No way. How'd they get up?

356
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,166
This has gotta be
some kinda nightmare.

357
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,958
I'm dreamin' right?

358
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:28,041
I don't... think so.

359
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,958
I know the timing
of your attacks,

360
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,083
the way you stand
when you defend,

361
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,250
even the rhythm
of your breathing!

362
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,708
What the hell?
That's impossible!

363
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,541
[STING] I used my Dragon Force!
You shouldn't be standing!

364
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,583
[NATSU] Yeah, you're
definitely strong!

365
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:44,166
I feel like a
train ran over me.

366
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,750
[ROGUE] Keep your composure.
He's just bluffing.

367
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,833
[GAJEEL chuckles]
Don't make me laugh!

368
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,833
Does Salamander look
like the type of guy

369
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,458
that's smart enough to bluff?

370
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,666
I'm smart! Just watch!

371
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,541
For example,
when you attack,

372
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,958
you pivot your foot to
around eleven o'clock.

373
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,791
Nope. It's ten
o'clock, dummy.

374
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,708
It's totally eleven!

375
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:05,250
Are you blind? It was
ten-thirty at most!

376
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,666
Were you even
watching him?

377
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,333
I think you
were hit too hard!

378
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,791
[NATSU]
It's twenty-three o'clock!

379
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,833
[GAJEEL] That's the
same thing, moron!

380
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:16,625
[NATSU and GAJEEL arguing]

381
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:17,916
[MAKAROV] Are those
numbskulls trying to

382
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,750
embarrass the entire guild?

383
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,875
They sure have a lot
of excess energy though!

384
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,416
I think they'll finally
get serious down there.

385
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,958
They sure picked a heck
of a time for bickering.

386
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:30,416
Must be humiliating to look like
a couple of little children.

387
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,083
You're one to talk, Gray.

388
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,458
How often have you and Natsu
bickered just like that?

389
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:38,083
Yeah, but we don't do it
in front of the whole world.

390
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,583
[NATSU] Oopsie daisy!

391
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,250
Huh?!

392
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,625
Hey! What the crap?

393
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,041
[GAJEEL] Aaahhh!

394
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,666
He-heh!

395
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,125
Hey. What did
you do that for?

396
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,583
Betrayal?

397
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,416
[NATSU] What? Did you
think I forgot about that

398
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,250
little insult from before? Ha!

399
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,625
I can handle the
two of you myself.

400
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,958
Come on! Give me all you got!

401
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:11,375
[CHAPATI] Insanity! Natsu
Dragneel has declared his own

402
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,750
one-on-two battle
against the Twin Dragons!

403
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:17,041
We could be witnessing history!

404
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,041
Are you getting' fired up?

405
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:54,166
[GAJEEL] When I get
outta here, Salamander...

406
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,125
[groans] you're dead! Hear me?

407
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:10,000
[GAJEEL] Aaahhh!

408
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:14,625
[HAPPY] Natsu! I believe in you!

409
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,333
[NATSU] I got this! Trust me!

410
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:18,166
[HAPPY] You wouldn't
betray me, would you?

411
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,750
[NATSU] What are you talking
about now? 'Course I wouldn't!

412
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:23,291
[HAPPY] And you'd never do
anything to make me sad, right?

413
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,125
[NATSU] Anyone that
does will answer to me!

414
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:26,791
[HAPPY] Good, cause, well,

415
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:30,333
someone ate the special
fish I was saving!

416
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:34,166
[HAPPY and NATSU] Next time:
"Natsu versus the Twin Dragons!"

417
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,833
[NATSU] Happy, I'm sorry.

418
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:37,083
[HAPPY] 'Bout what?

419
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:38,875
[NATSU] I didn't know
it was yours! Honest!

420
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:41,541
[HAPPY] Say what?!
