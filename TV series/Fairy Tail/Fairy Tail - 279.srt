Say goodbye!

167
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,458
Watch out, Shelia!

168
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,500
You saved me.

169
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,250
[BLUENOTE]
Shall I step in?

170
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,625
No, no.

171
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,333
These pests are not worth
the sweat off your brow.

172
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,666
[BLUENOTE]
Huh?

173
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,000
Are you okay?

174
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,541
Think so.

175
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:29,625
[BLUENOTE] That girl. I've
seen her somewhere before.

176
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:32,333
Wait. You sure?

177
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:35,000
I want to see how
you "fly" now.

178
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,833
[BOTH scream]

179
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,291
What's going on?

180
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,958
[HAPPY]
Uh! The ground blew up!

181
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,500
[HAPPY screams]

182
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,166
No. It's him again.

183
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,500
Oh, dear.

184
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:08,291
That's Bluenote Stinger.
He's from Grimoire Heart.

185
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,500
[BLUENOTE]
Hm?

186
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,625
[gasps]

187
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,375
I can't move!

188
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,375
Something's holding us down!

189
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,916
[BLUENOTE]
With the power of my gravity,

190
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,166
I can squash you
all like insects.

191
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,708
Sir, please, I beg you
to exercise restraint.

192
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,375
You're crushing my men as well.

193
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,583
[BLUENOTE growls]

194
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,416
[OROCHI TAMER] Never mind.
Forget I said anything.

195
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,625
Feel free to do
whatever you want, sir.

196
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,291
I don't get it. Why is he here?

197
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,250
[BLUENOTE]
Black hole!

198
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,958
Ready? Let's fly!

199
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,625
Where to begin?

200
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,791
Shelia!

201
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:04,750
Gotcha!

202
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,458
[SHELIA gasps]

203
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,291
Natsu!

204
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,583
You made it!

205
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,458
He can stand?

206
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:14,125
It's like the gravity
doesn't affect him!

207
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:26,250
What's the big idea
with stealin' Happy?

208
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,166
I'm sorry about that.

209
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,375
Natsu, this isn't the
time for such nonsense.

210
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,208
Do you see who we're fighting?

211
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,166
It's the guy who nearly
killed us on Tenrou Island!

212
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,958
That's Bluenote Stinger!

213
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,125
[NATSU]
Hm?

214
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:42,333
[grumbles]

215
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,625
Never seen him before.

216
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,666
Seriously?!

217
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,750
[BLUENOTE]
He's familiar as well.

218
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:52,666
Fairy Glitter? Fat chance!

219
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,291
Agh! I'm a human pancake!

220
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,583
Fire Dragon Roar!

221
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,083
[NATSU screams]

222
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,375
[BLUENOTE]
Cocky little brat!

223
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:11,416
[BLUENOTE]
He was nothing but a pest.

224
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,500
But still, seeing his face
and hearing his voice

225
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,833
fills me with rage!

226
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:22,916
Whoa! His power is intense!

227
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,500
I can barely move.

228
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,416
It's crazy. How strong is he?

229
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,833
Bluenote, sir!

230
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,833
[BLUENOTE]
I need to take him out. Quickly!

231
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,916
[BLUENOTE]
I'll crush you!

232
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,791
[NATSU]
You're not crushin' anyone!

233
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,666
[SHELIA screams]

234
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,791
Look at that fire!

235
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,958
It's lifting the ground!

236
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,375
No way!

237
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:58,000
[NATSU] You shoulda never
messed with Fairy Tail!

238
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,875
[BLUENOTE]
Fairy Tail?

239
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,958
That's it!

240
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,208
That's how I know them!

241
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,500
'Cause now you're gonna pay!

242
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,875
[BLUENOTE]
Black... Hole!

243
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,666
[BLUENOTE]
This one can really "fly"!

244
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,083
[gasping]

245
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,458
[OROCHI N gasps]

246
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,541
[OROCHI MEMBERS gasp]

247
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:55,625
[groaning]

248
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,583
[CARLA]
Just one attack?

249
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,125
[WENDY]
My goodness.

250
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:06,458
He's only trained a year and
he's gotten this much stronger?

251
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,333
[SHELIA yelping]

252
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,708
Come on, you know not to steal.

253
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:13,000
[SHELIA] More importantly,
my clothes are on fire!

254
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,541
[HAPPY] Hey, Natsu, forget
about the lecture for now.

255
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:16,958
Look over there.

256
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,125
[NATSU]
Uh?

257
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,416
[HAPPY] The bad guys
are doin' somethin'.

258
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,541
[OROCHI TAMER]
We surrender.

259
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,166
[YUKA] Looks like the monsters
were all turned away.

260
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:36,541
[TOBY grunting]

261
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:37,916
Way to go, guys!

262
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,375
Well, of course we won.

263
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,791
Thanks to you,
Marguerite is safe again.

264
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,583
I still wanna smash stuff.

265
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:48,666
I'm sure we're just gettin'
started, 'ol buddy.

266
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,416
It's kinda hard to
believe Orochi Fin

267
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,125
hired Bluenote Stinger.

268
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,708
They hired who, now?

269
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,958
Wait! The gravity guy?

270
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,583
You really didn't remember him?

271
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,208
[LUCY]
I understand why you'd forget.

272
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,583
We got attacked by something

273
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,583
way more powerful than
him right afterward.

274
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:06,000
Huh. I don't know
what you mean.

275
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,500
I guess it must be my
turn to forget stuff.

276
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,416
She means Acnologia.

277
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,791
[LUCY] Oh. So, you can
remember his name.

278
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,916
There's a good reason
I can't forget him.

279
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,958
[roars]

280
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,000
[gasps]

281
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,375
Do you happen to know where
Wendy and Shelia ran off to?

282
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,916
Those young ladies
are both gonna be

283
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,625
beautiful women before too long.

284
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:20,041
[YUKA]
They needed to talk in private.

285
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,208
So much for my plan.

286
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,375
Huh? What does that mean?

287
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,541
I just wanted to prove to
you that I would be able

288
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,541
to handle things all on my own.

289
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:35,375
That you don't need to worry.

290
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:39,291
But then, Natsu went and
messed the whole thing up.

291
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,750
That's kinda what
he's known for.

292
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:48,541
Listen, Wendy, you need to go
and be by Natsu's side again.

293
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,625
[WENDY]
What?

294
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,375
[SHELIA]
You love him, don't you?

295
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:55,875
Hold on! You're making it
sound like something else.

296
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:59,708
I mean, I do look up to him,
sure. But it's way different.

297
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,708
He's more like my big brother.

298
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,375
You know, that's love, too.

299
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,583
[SHELIA] If you don't
go, you'll regret it.

300
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,541
It's obvious Natsu
still believes in you.

301
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,750
And in Fairy Tail.

302
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,333
He has a lot of love for you.

303
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,583
And Fairy Tail's a
guild built on love;

304
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,875
it's what brings you together.

305
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,875
Yeah, but...

306
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,083
[SHELIA]
Follow your heart.

307
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:33,250
Wendy, even if we're
in different guilds,

308
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,583
you and I will
always be friends.

309
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,291
You mean it?

310
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,750
[SHELIA]
Mh-hm.

311
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,041
Friends forever.

312
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,916
[WENDY] Thanks so much for
everything you've done!

313
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It was a pleasure to have you.

314
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,583
[CARLA] We truly
appreciate your kindness.

315
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,541
And we appreciate your help.

316
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,958
I'm sorry. I feel
terrible about leaving.

317
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:25,000
Like I'm... just being selfish.

318
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,166
This was what we agreed
to when you joined,

319
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,583
so don't be sad.

320
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,125
[NATSU]
It was?

321
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,958
We always said we'd be
part of their guild

322
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,625
until Fairy Tail re-formed.

323
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:38,625
Don't go, Carla!

324
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,625
We'll miss you.

325
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,250
I know.

326
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,458
Jeez. Pull yourself
together, child.

327
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,416
[LUCY] Even though they
joined another guild,

328
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,458
I'm so happy that they
never gave up on Fairy Tail.

329
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:53,125
Come on, don't be
such a crybaby.

330
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,791
I'm sorry.

331
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,750
It'll be all right.

332
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,625
I can take over as one
of the Sky Sisters

333
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,083
so the show can go on.

334
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,500
In your dreams.

335
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,166
Leave it to me!

336
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,291
[LAMIA D, LAMIA E]
It's never gonna happen!

337
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,500
[LYON] Farewell, and best of
luck with rebuilding Fairy Tail.

338
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,625
[NATSU]
Thanks!

339
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:14,000
[LYON]
Give Gray my regards.

340
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,333
Ya know, he's one
of the members

341
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,333
I've completely lost track of.

342
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:20,875
Careful out there!

343
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,791
So long.

344
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,000
Bye, Wendy! I'll miss you!

345
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:31,166
Bye! I'll miss you, too!

346
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,666
Hey. It's okay to cry.

347
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:49,916
But I won't.

348
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,500
Fairy Tail is getting
back together

349
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,916
and that's nothing to cry about.

350
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,916
That's quite enough
tears for now, Wendy.

351
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,041
Dry your eyes.

352
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,375
I know.

353
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,541
But they were so sweet
after Fairy Tail broke up.

354
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:15,958
I really started to feel like

355
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,291
I was becoming part
of a family again,

356
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:21,541
then you guys came back for me.

357
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,958
[LUCY] She's crying because
she's sad and happy?

358
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,291
This is only the
start of it, Wendy!

359
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:30,125
We're gonna get everybody
back together!

360
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,125
Yeah!

361
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,041
So, where are heading
off to next?

362
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,791
Good question.

363
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,833
[LUCY]
Well, if we travel eastward,

364
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:46,041
we'll reach a place called
Rain Bringer Village.

365
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,833
[WENDY]
That's a kind of a weird name.

366
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,666
[LUCY] Supposedly, it never
stops raining there,

367
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,750
so I'd say it's pretty fitting.

368
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,333
[HAPPY] We know someone
who likes the rain.

369
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,166
[LUCY] The search for the Fairy
Tail members continues

370
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,500
in Rain Bringer Village,

371
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:44,833
where we find a broken-hearted
Juvia, all alone.

372
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:47,208
She tell us about what
Gray has been up to.

373
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:48,833
And it reminds Natsu
about something

374
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:50,458
he learned about a year ago.

375
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:52,666
Something we need to stop.

376
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,833
A shadow is looming over Gray.

377
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:56,875
If it grows, his heart and soul

378
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:59,708
could be lost to the
darkness forever.

379
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:01,875
Next Time: "Avatar."

380
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,333
With the dark guilds gone,

381
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:06,208
evil is making a new
home in the kingdom.
