1
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,500
Sorry, guys.

2
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:24,833
I wish I had happier news.

3
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:30,250
I promise I'll find him.

4
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:33,458
For you and the rest of us.

5
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:36,375
We're gonna get
everyone back together.

6
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:39,416
And I ain't stoppin'
until we're a guild again.

7
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:48,583
I don't know. Are you
positive Gray's in there?

8
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,916
[NATSU]
Yep. I'd bet my scarf on it.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,500
We gotta get him
back to Juvia soon.

10
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,458
So let's not waste
any more time.

11
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:57,458
[NATSU] Ugh. This place is
creepy, so I'm all for that.

12
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:00,458
[HAPPY] Who builds a church in
the middle of a spooky forest?

13
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:03,166
[LUCY] Somebody I'd rather not
meet, to be honest with ya.

14
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,875
All right, let's
take it by storm!

15
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:06,208
Aye-aye, Sir!

16
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:07,583
Hold it right there, guys!

17
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:09,541
[NATSU, HAPPY grunt]

18
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:10,708
That's gonna leave a mark.

19
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:12,458
Well, at least my
head broke the fall.

20
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,291
We have no idea who or what

21
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,666
might be waiting
for us inside there.

22
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,625
Just charging in blindly
isn't the smartest idea.

23
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:20,625
[NATSU]
Tch.

24
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:22,333
Well, all I know
is Gray's in there

25
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,875
and we need to get him out.

26
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,916
[LUCY] Which is exactly why
we have to think this through.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,875
We can't afford to mess it up.

28
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:29,125
Yeah, okay.

29
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:31,333
So I think I should give
Miss Virgo a ding-dong

30
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,083
and have her tunnel
us in underneath.

31
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,500
Good idea!

32
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,291
Okay, let's go!

33
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:39,041
Open. Gate of the Maiden!

34
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,166
Vir--

35
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:43,666
...go?

36
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,541
[HAPPY, NATSU yell]

37
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,041
[HAPPY]
I think she needs help.

38
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,583
[LUCY] Whoa! What happened?
Are you okay?

39
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,666
[NATSU]
Who do I beat up for this?

40
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,416
Don't mind me.

41
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,833
[LUCY]
Uh.

42
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,708
I wasn't busy, so I
thought I'd punish myself.

43
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,500
[LUCY]
You gotta be kidding me.

44
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,416
[NATSU] There's a lot I don't
know about celestial spirits.

45
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,250
[HAPPY]
Aye.

46
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,416
It's a pleasure to see you.

47
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,458
I hope that you gentlemen
are doing well.

48
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:39,916
All right, anyway...
Let's get back to work!

49
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,375
[LUCY]
Star Dress: Virgo Form!

50
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,750
She transforms now?

51
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,625
I'm getting flashbacks
of a scary armor wizard!

52
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,791
That outfit grants some
of my special abilities,

53
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,666
increases her magic power,
and boosts her sex appeal.

54
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,458
Okay, Virgo, you ready to rock?

55
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,416
I live to serve,
Princess, so let's go!

56
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:11,041
[hammering]

57
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,208
And with that, we're in.

58
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,000
Looks like the basement to me.

59
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,083
[NATSU]
Great!

60
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,833
Now would you move
your big ol' butt?

61
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,375
[HAPPY]
Yeah. Please, Lucy.

62
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,416
We're kinda sick of
seein' your undies!

63
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,041
I can't help but wonder
what kinda stuff

64
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,833
the Avatar guys do down here.

65
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,000
[NATSU]
Who knows?

66
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,958
Probably just a bunch
of fartin' around.

67
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,875
Let's see if we can dig
up anything on Gray

68
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,416
before anyone finds
out we're here.

69
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:49,041
Gray! Come out, come
out, wherever you are!

70
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,208
Who's screaming?

71
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,208
That's not a voice I recognize.

72
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,333
[D-6] It definitely came
from inside the church.

73
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,708
We've got company.

74
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:01,333
Finally, some excitement!
I'm ready to play!

75
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,250
Natsu's here?

76
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,375
You idiot!

77
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:07,791
The plan was to move
around undetected,

78
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,375
not tell the entire world
we broke into the place!

79
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,750
Princess, I believe this
calls for punishment.

80
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,291
Feel free to use this on me.
I swear I'll behave.

81
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,000
Now is not the time!

82
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,166
[VIRGO]
Always time for punishment.

83
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,583
What did I do to deserve this?!

84
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,500
All right, you two, stop!

85
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:23,833
Yep, he's here.

86
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,458
[LUCY]
Huh?

87
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,666
I know the guy's scent.
Place reeks of 'im.

88
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,333
We can always trust your nose.

89
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:33,125
Well, I guess there's no reason
for us to hide anymore.

90
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,291
[ABEL]
Hey!

91
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,333
[NATSU]
Hm?

92
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,458
[ABEL]
Wanna tell me what you guys

93
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,583
are doing inside our hideout?

94
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:39,875
I hope you came to play,

95
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,500
'cause that's my favorite
thing in the world.

96
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:43,916
[LUCY]
Is that who we're fighting?

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,750
Wait, I know that doll!

98
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,250
Mr. Cursey!

99
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,958
Oh, man, it's all
coming back to me now.

100
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:53,041
It belonged to that big pasty
guy we fought on Tenrou.

101
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,833
[HAPPY] Yeah, you and him had
a whole lot of fun with it.

102
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,041
[LUCY]
I would never call that "fun"!

103
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,500
[ABEL]
So, you've already had a chance

104
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,416
to play with Mr. Cursey, huh?

105
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,750
He's one of the best
presents I ever got.

106
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,708
From one of the heavyweights
of Grimoire Heart.

107
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,958
This little guy's magic power
is so awesome, it's scary!

108
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,500
Just looking at the thing
makes my skin crawl.

109
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,041
Be careful, Princess.

110
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:20,208
He's small, but he's an
extremely strong wizard.

111
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,583
[ABEL]
Huh?

112
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,250
[gasps]

113
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,791
[gasps]

114
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,791
[NATSU]
Sorry, squirt.

115
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,791
Bring me Gray or
get outta my face.

116
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,666
Abel!

117
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,458
[wails]

118
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,958
Oh, you foolish intruders
have got my blood

119
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,583
boiling over with rage!

120
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,125
You won't leaf here!

121
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:52,541
Because in this room, I keep all
my instruments of cruel-TEA!

122
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:53,958
Is he serious?

123
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,250
I bet he's talkin'
about your novel, Lucy.

124
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,333
Prepare to experience
brew-tal torture

125
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,541
the likes of which
you've never seen!

126
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,291
I'm thirs-TEA for punish-mint!

127
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,833
[LUCY]
That's not a good thing!

128
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:07,041
[GOMON] Tea-tea-tea-tea-tea-
tea-tea-tea-tea-tea-tea-tea-tea-

129
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:13,000
tea-tea-tea-tea-tea-tea-tea-
tea-tea-tea-tea-tea...!

130
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,333
Don't let him give you
any crazy ideas, please.

131
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,375
[HAPPY yelling]

132
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,000
[LUCY]
Especially that one!

133
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,416
Triangle Dummy Dragon!

134
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,666
Callin' this thing a
dragon is an insult!

135
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,125
Well, if that's not
your cup of TEA...

136
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,291
...try the Iron Maiden!

137
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,166
Natsu!

138
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,125
This seems like somethin'
Gajeel'd be into!

139
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,041
Now steep tight.

140
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,666
Oh, no!

141
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,166
[LUCY]
That's brew-tal.

142
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,708
The punish-mint's
completed to a TEA.

143
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,166
[GOMON]
Huh?

144
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,041
[gasps]

145
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,458
[chuckles]

146
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,791
[GOMON]
The iron is melting? How?

147
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,916
[gasps]

148
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,666
Pour me.

149
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,083
That's two down.

150
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,416
[D-6]
You're mine now!

151
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,458
[NATSU]
And that's three.

152
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,708
[groaning]

153
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:18,125
[D-6 grunting]

154
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,500
[VIRGO]
He's so strong.

155
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,833
That's our Natsu!

156
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,625
Always ready to
serve up some punch!

157
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,708
No, what a bitter end.

158
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,375
I'm having a hard time
swallowing all of this.

159
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,458
We're the top tier
wizards of Avatar.

160
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,916
[GRAY] It's obvious you
were in too deep, Gomon.

161
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,666
[gasps]

162
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,416
[GRAY]
Leave him to me.

163
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,333
Hey! Long time no see, man!

164
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,375
[JUVIA]
Oh. Gray darling.

165
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,708
Please come back, my love.

166
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,125
I need you here.

167
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:11,208
It'll be okay. I just need
to dry you off a little.

168
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,291
[gasps]

169
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,958
So wobbly.

170
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:16,916
[CARLA]
Huh?

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,291
[WENDY]
And big.

172
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,125
[JUVIA]
These belong to my sweet Gray.

173
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,416
[WENDY, CARLA yelps]

174
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,666
You can't take his fish.

175
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,500
[CARLA] What in the world
is she dreaming about?

176
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,583
[CARLA]
Tell me, Wendy.

177
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,208
[WENDY]
What is it?

178
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,583
Do you think the
others have been able

179
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,166
to track down Gray yet?

180
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,166
[WENDY]
Yeah.

181
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,666
I imagine that they have by now.

182
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,708
[CARLA]
I hope they're not quarreling.

183
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:45,083
[WENDY] In a weird way, that's
kinda how they get along.

184
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,541
They're like best friends
who love to fight.

185
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,916
[CARLA chuckles]

186
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,916
You certainly do have a point.

187
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,125
No, please don't. No fighting.

188
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,916
You'll make Erza mad.

189
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,375
And she'll beat
you both to a pulp.

190
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,041
[WENDY]
That's what usually happens.

191
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,125
[CARLA]
A believable dream.

192
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:08,458
[yelling]

193
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,625
[chuckles]

194
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,416
[LUCY]
Stop it!

195
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,541
Would you guys
cut it out already?

196
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,916
You made a stupid mistake
comin' to this place.

197
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,541
That's funny!

198
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,125
'Cause I was about to say
the exact same thing to you.

199
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:39,291
[GRAY] I can do whatever
the hell I want!

200
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,375
[NATSU]
You're wrong!

201
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,625
Juvia's waiting for you!

202
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,583
[NATSU]
As a matter of fact, we all are!

203
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,583
[NATSU] We're gonna get
Fairy Tail back together!

204
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,958
And we can't do it without you!

205
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,375
[LUCY, HAPPY gasp]

206
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,666
You're such an idiot.

207
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,958
Don't you realize
Fairy Tail is gone?

208
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,375
[NATSU]
No, it's not!

209
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:11,583
All the memories we share and
the friendships we've made,

210
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,666
they haven't gone anywhere!

211
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,416
Fairy Tail's still here.
It lives on in our hearts.

212
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,458
Always has... and always will.

213
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,291
Sure, okay. If that
works for you.

214
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,708
But it seems to me like
that should be enough,

215
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,458
so leave me out of it.

216
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:31,625
Let me follow my own
path from now on.

217
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,708
[HAPPY]
Gray.

218
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,708
[GRAY]
Fairy Tail is in my past,

219
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,541
and that's where
it's gonna stay.

220
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:43,875
We used to be friends,
but everything has changed.

221
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,583
I can't pretend that it hasn't.

222
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,333
[slap]

223
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,041
[LUCY]
Nobody is pretending!

224
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,416
We're your friends, Gray.

225
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,291
And we always will be.

226
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:08,000
Whatever it is you're going
through, we're here to help.

227
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,583
Hearing you say all this,
it's breaking my heart.

228
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,708
After all we've been through--

229
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,000
[gasps]

230
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,166
I don't... feel so good.

231
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,916
What's happening?

232
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,500
All of a sudden, my stomach
started hurting really bad.

233
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,625
I can't--

234
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:27,125
It must be you, Mary.

235
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,333
Oh, am I interrupting
something, Gray?

236
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,250
Looks like you're catching
up with some old friends.

237
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:35,583
Probably from that guild that
went belly up, aren't they? Ha!

238
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,000
No! Princess!

239
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:40,333
What the hell are
you doing to Lucy?

240
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,208
Simmer down!

241
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,291
I think these chains
are made with Sealstone!

242
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,541
I'll help you!

243
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,416
[yells]

244
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,333
Mr. Cursey loves to play!

245
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:53,166
Yeah. I know.

246
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,625
We were having a
little difficul-TEA!

247
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,208
Now, I wouldn't even bother
trying to fight away the pain

248
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,375
if I were you.

249
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:04,833
'Cause you're weak. I'm like
so totally stronger than you.

250
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,208
And my black magic
power is the bomb.

251
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,416
All right, Gray!

252
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,833
[GOMON]
Nuh-uh!

253
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,833
These chains are blocking
his magic power.

254
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,333
How strong is he?

255
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,333
Stop right there.

256
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,583
It hurts so bad.

257
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:24,666
Princess!

258
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,875
[HAPPY]
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, owie!

259
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,291
This is what happens
when you don't

260
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,958
mind your own business, Natsu.

261
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,500
You're not yourself, man!

262
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:36,458
It's obvious there's some kinda
demon that's taken over you!

263
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,541
[GRAY]
No. I'm in control of myself.

264
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,500
The Fairy Tail emblem's gone.

265
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,583
I made the choice
to get rid of it.

266
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,000
So I could find my own answer.

267
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,875
I can't believe he'd do that.

268
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,791
He erased his guild mark!

269
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,958
You'll regret that!

270
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,125
[PANTHERLILY]
Hm?

271
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,333
I can hear somebody
approaching the camp.

272
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:17,541
Yeah, I hear 'em, too.
I know that scent.

273
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:20,583
[LEVY]
I'm back.

274
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:21,583
Thank goodness!

275
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,916
Glad you made it!
Job well done!

276
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,750
[KNIGHT B] Infiltrating the
cult must've been tough.

277
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,125
[KNIGHT AA] I bet being
petite came in handy.


278
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:32,583
I just wish I could've
done it more quickly.


279
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,041
I didn't have too hard
of a time sneaking in

280
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,375
among all the real cultists.

281
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,500
But sneaking out, that was a
little bit more of a challenge.

282
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,041
[LEVY gasps]

283
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,875
So, were you guys able to dig
up any information on Gray?

284
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:47,958
Yeah.

285
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,750
I wonder what happened to him.

286
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:54,666
It's unsettling. Like his heart
was consumed by darkness.

287
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,708
Doesn't really matter.

288
00:14:56,791 --> 00:15:00,250
Our only mission here is to
stop the Purification Plan.

289
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,166
[PANTHERLILY] What do you
mean "it doesn't matter"?

290
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,125
Come on. Gray was our friend.

291
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,416
[GAJEEL]
Well, he's not anymore.

292
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,041
And if they can somehow pull off
what they're tryin' to do,

293
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,416
then a lot of innocent
people are gonna die.

294
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,083
Anyone that would
willingly play a role

295
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,458
in that kind of evil plan
is no friend of mine.

296
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:23,750
Do you think you could do it?
Strike down an old guild mate?

297
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:27,125
[GAJEEL] The way I see it,
he's our enemy now.

298
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,458
We have to stop that
plan no matter what.

299
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,791
Yummy fish. Yummy fish.

300
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:47,791
Don't burn it to a crisp,
Natsu. It's my fishy.

301
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,166
Oh, wait.

302
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,666
You okay, Happy?

303
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,250

Mh-hm. Guess so.

304
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,041
Is your tummy feeling better?

305
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,500
Yeah. It doesn't hurt anymore.

306
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:57,958
Where's Virgo?

307
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,791
I think these Sealstone chains
forced her gate closed.

308
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,416
Gray is such a jerk.

309
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,208
What in the hell
is wrong with him?

310
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:07,208
And without the Fairy Tail guild
mark, he looks totally stupid.

311
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:11,250
As crazy as this might sound,
I believe Natsu's theory.

312
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:15,041
Something's taken him over,
or he's being manipulated.

313
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,416
Bet you're right.

314
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,458
The Gray we know would never
do anything like this.

00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,000
Scary!

320
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,625
[growls]

321
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,125
[NATSU]
Where is Gray?

322
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,041
Bring him down here right now!

323
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,125
Gray and the other
mighty ones had to leaf

324
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,583
to begin the mission
we've been brewing up.

325
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,000
What's that?

326
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:57,000
[GOMON] Our Purification Plan
for the unclean masses.

327
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,250
Our exalted leader
asked that I stay behind

328
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,041
to snuff out who sent you here.

329
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,541
Under strain of
brew-tal torture.

330
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,625
What is this Purification Plan?

331
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,958
[GOMON]
The purification of souls.

332
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:12,625
Only one thing will beckon the
return of our Dark Lord Zeref.

333
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:15,250
The deaths of
countless innocents.

334
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,791
There's no way Gray
would be involved

335
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,208
in some evil plan like that!

336
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,791
[GOMON] Why have you
not mentioned my outfit?

337
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,666
[LUCY]
Huh?

338
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,916
[GOMON]
Well, I mean,

339
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,083
I'm obviously cosplaying
as our Dark Lord Zeref,

340
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,958
and I think I nailed
it to a TEA!

341
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,541
Yeah, so?!

342
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,041
[HAPPY]
Whoa.

343
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,000
[GOMON] I'm such a major
fan of Lord Zeref

344
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,625
I even got this
awesome face tattoo.

345
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,500
It's spelled in some
kinda foreign alphabet,

346
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,791
but I was told that it
says "Zeref Rules."

347
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,708
[LUCY] Uh, it actually
says "powdered tea."

348
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,833
[LUCY] Probably shouldn't
have done that.

349
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:47,958
Say what?!

350
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,125
You bergamot be
telling the truth!

351
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,333
[gasps]

352
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:54,500
[screaming]

353
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,166
He can control his torture
stuff without touching it?

354
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,541
[GOMON]
You just noticed?

355
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,333
You let her go, round boy!

356
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,375
Shut up. You should realize
I have the power here.

357
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,375
[yells]

358
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,291
Ah!

359
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,041
[GOMON]
Time to get started.

360
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,875
And I will show no pi-TEA!

361
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,750
No, Lucy!

362
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,875
I can't get it off!

363
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,000
[GOMON]
Magic doesn't work on Sealstone,

364
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,791
that's the point!

365
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:22,416
[gasps]

366
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,458
[GOMON humming]

367
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,083
I can use a whip.

368
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,791
Or a candle.

369
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,166
Or water. Or rope!

370
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,375
How about some
foot-licking torture?

371
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,958
So, what's your cup of TEA, huh?

372
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,416
It all sounds so perverted.

373
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,125
And would you stop with
the whole ridiculous

374
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,166
"bowing to nobody" thing?!

375
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,625
It's creepy!

376
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,125
I would go with foot-lickin'
stuff if I were you.

377
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,833
I mean, how bad can that be?

378
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,375
Just the sound of it gives
me the heebie-jeebies.

379
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,125
It seems that you
fail to comprehend

380
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,500
the barbari-TEA of that
particular method of torture.

381
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,791
Wait, what does salt water
have to do with anything?

382
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,083
[GOMON]
I'll tell you.

383
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,916
First, I slather your
feet in salt water,

384
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,333
then I bring in a goat.

385
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,958
The goat licks your
feet to get the salt.

386
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,833
The thirsty goat's tongue gets
scratchier and scratchier,

387
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,875
peeling off your skin and
eventually the flesh beneath it.

388
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,958
The beast, never satisfied,

389
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,916
will keep on licking
for eterni-TEA.

390
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,125
That is some freaky,
messed up stuff!

391
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,166
[HAPPY]
You mean that poor goat

392
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,583
has to lick her
nasty feet forever?

393
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:31,958
[LUCY screams]

394
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,458
[GOMON]
Gimme that footy!

395
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,541
[LUCY screams]

396
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:36,958
No!

397
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,541
Chai!

398
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,500
Now, you had better
get real chatty, kid,

399
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,958
or she's gonna be
walking on stumps.

400
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:53,583
You bastard! I told ya
everything I know!

401
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:54,791
So listen!

402
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,666
The only reason we came
to this creepy dump

403
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,250
was to get our friend Gray!

404
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,208
I cannot believe such falsity!

405
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,583
Gray is one of our most
prestigious members.

406
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:07,458
[LUCY grunting]

407
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,666
[LUCY screams]

408
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,916
[NATSU growls]

409
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,583
[NATSU]
He is our friend!

410
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,333
No matter what the hell
he might be saying now,

411
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,000
we'll never stop
believing in him.

412
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,041
[growls]

413
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,291
Hold your tongue!

414
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,333
[squeals]

415
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,500
Lucy, no!

416
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,541
What are you doin' to her now?

417
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:37,083
[grunting]

418
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,375
[squeaks]

419
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:41,791
This situation calls for
far more severi-TEA!

420
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,833
Cutting her in half is
guaran-TEA-d to make you talk!

421
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,958
I won't let you!

422
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,916
[GOMON]
You might have faith in Gray,

423
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,791
but he won't be
coming to save her!

424
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,041
[LUCY]
Huh?

425
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,416
[LUCY]
Gray.

426
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,833
[GRAY]
Ugh! So typical!

427
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,666
How can you guys
always ruin everything?

428
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,458
Listen up, it's Code Blue.

429
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,041
I just hit a snag here.

430
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,625
[ALL]
Huh?

431
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,833
[GRAY]
No, no. Not that kind.

432
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,333
Mm-hmm.

433
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,333
[sighs] Hell if I know.

434
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,375
You should probably
ask him yourself.

435
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,500
Yeah, he's right here.

436
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,625
All that stuff on
him just faded away.

437
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:51,625
[NATSU]
Uh.

438
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,333
Hold it up to your ear, man.

439
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,750
What's it supposed to do?

440
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,875
[ERZA]
Natsu. This is you, right?

441
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,416
[NATSU gasps]

442
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,541
[GRAY]
Mh-hm.

443
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:06,666
Congratulations. Your antics
blew Gray's covert operation.

444
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:40,166
[LUCY] The stage has
been set for Avatar

445
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,000
to unleash their heinous
Purification Plan.

446
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,833
They want to summon
their Dark Lord Zeref

447
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:48,291
by killing scores of innocent
people as a sacrifice.

448
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:49,666
There's barely any time left

449
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,375
before the plan
kicks into action,

450
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:53,458
so we're going to
have to move quickly.

451
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:56,666
Five strong, the members of
Fairy Tail's mightiest team

452
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,875
rides again to take down
this murderous cult.

453
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:02,708
Next Time:
"The Purification Plan."

454
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:04,791
The bond we share is
our strongest weapon

455
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,916
in the fight against evil.
