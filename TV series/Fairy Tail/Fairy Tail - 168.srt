1
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,250
There's no stoppin' us!

2
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,416
We've just started
to rock your world!

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,791
Fairy Tail will
be number one again!

4
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:28,416
[CROWD cheers]

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,125
[MATO] This changes everything.

6
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,916
I'll have to put a little
more thought into my plans.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,750
Here's the battle
line-up, Boss.

8
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,958
I got a feeling you'll
find it very interesting.

9
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,208
[ALEXEI] Yes,
this one in particular.

10
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,791
It would appear that
there are some true

11
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,708
connoisseurs among
the event management.

12
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,833
It's about time we got started.

13
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:50,916
Raven Tail's true objective
is almost within reach.

14
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,125
[CHAPATI] We're halfway
through day three

15
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,750
of the Grand Magic Games,

16
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,291
so let's take a look at
the teams' current standings!

17
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:34,583
[CHAPATI] In first place
is the Raven Tail guild!

18
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:37,875
[cheering]

19
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:41,166
[ALEXEI] At long last,
the time has come.

20
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,208
Let's go. We've got work to do.

21
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:47,291
[ALL chuckle]

22
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:51,208
[CHAPATI] Holding on to
second place is Lamia Scale!

23
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:54,375
[CROWD cheers]

24
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:58,208
[CHAPATI] Dropping down to third
place is the Sabertooth guild!

25
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:01,875
[CROWD cheers]

26
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:05,291
[CHAPATI] In fourth place, it's
the ladies of Mermaid Heel!

27
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,041
[CROWD cheers]

28
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,958
Next we have the group
who jumped up two spots

29
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:12,375
to tie for fourth place, let's
hear it for Fairy Tail Team A!

30
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,250
[CROWD cheering]

31
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,916
Aw, yeah!

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,500
And we're gonna keep
climbing the ranks,

33
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,708
just you watch!

34
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,083
Aye, Sir!

35
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:25,208
[CHAPATI] In sixth place
is Fairy Tail Team B!

36
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:28,125
[CROWD cheers]

37
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,875
[GAJEEL] We can't let our
guild mates outdo us, guys.

38
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:34,375
[CHAPATI] And here are
the rest of the teams!

39
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,000
Wow, They don't
even announce your name

40
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,375
when you're in seventh place?

41
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,500
Oh, what an insulting parfum!

42
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,041
Good! If we've gotta
stick with "Quatro Puppy"

43
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,958
then I'm glad he ain't
announcin' our guild's name!

44
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:49,041
[HAPPY] Laxus versus Alexei!

45
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,625
[CHAPATI] Let's do away with the
pleasantries and shake up that

46
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,458
scoreboard with some
one-on-one battles!

47
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,333
[CROWD cheers]

48
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,958
Looking forward to it!
Should be exciting.

49
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,291
Indeed.

50
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,500
[CHAPATI] First up,
the kitten with major claws,

51
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,041
Mermaid Heel's Millianna.

52
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,000
[CHAPATI] Against Quattro
Puppy's towering giant, Semus!

53
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:18,833
Y'know we've got this one
in the bag, 'cause we're...

54
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,333
[ALL] Wild!

55
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,916
[CHAPATI] Let's get
this match started!

56
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,500
[SEMUS] First strike,
certain victory!

57
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:33,083
Wild Spin!

58
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,708
[CHAPATI] Look at that speed!
I never would've pegged him

59
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,041
as the fast and furious type!

60
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,500
[MILLIANNA] Hm. Guess I'll
just have to tie you up.

61
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,875
Bad Kitty Restraint Tube!

62
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,375
Ahhh!

63
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,958
It just bounced off!

64
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,416
[BETH, LISLIE, and ARAÑA]
Millianna, no!

65
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,750
That's it!

66
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,375
That's what ya get for
messin' with us, we're...

67
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,000
[YEAGER and NOVALI] Wild!

68
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,541
Ain't no way you
can beat us, kitty!

69
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,875
[MILLIANNA grunts]
I'm just gettin' started!

70
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,083
[SEMUS] Wild!

71
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,500
Eat this! Kitten Blast!

72
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,083
[SEMUS] All your
attack did was make me

73
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,750
spin even faster! Take this!

74
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,750
[MILLIANNA screams]

75
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,666
Alright, give her
a good thrashin'!

76
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,458
We're gonna win this
round because we're...

77
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,000
[ALL] Wild!

78
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,833
Oh, wow! Do you think
Millianna can beat him?

79
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,625
She's not givin' up but
she's taken major damage.

80
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:27,791
I'm worried.

81
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,625
She's going to be fine.

82
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:33,250
It won't be that easy to defeat
a warrior like Millianna.

83
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,208
Come on! Fight!

84
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,416
Stay strong, 'kay?

85
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,916
There is someone out there
who Millianna needs to defeat.

86
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,541
And until she does that,
she will not lose.

87
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:47,916
[MILLIANNA] I'd be
a bad kitty if I lost

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,750
to a weakling like you.

89
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,708
And It would mean I joined
Mermaid Heel for nothing!

90
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,583
It's time to finish you off!

91
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,458
[SEMUS] Wild Spin,
Double Speed!

92
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:58,833
[CHAPATI] He kicks
it into high gear,

93
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,958
but will it be enough
to finish the match?

94
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:04,208
I'll put ya in a Bad
Kitty Restraint Tube!

95
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,750
[SEMUS] I'll rip
that thing to shreds!

96
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,833
Well, Good luck 'cause
I'm not lettin' go!

97
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,541
Ah!

98
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:24,166
[SEMUS] I'm down but still wild.

99
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,416
[MILLIANNA] Meow.

100
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,625
Man, there ain't nothin'
wild about losin'.

101
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,416
[ALL] Aw...

102
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,375
I'm feelin' pretty pumped up!

103
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,166
[CHAPATI] Millianna's treating
the arena like her own

104
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,625
personal cat box, and she's
got something big to bury!

105
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,666
[cheering]

106
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,833
[MILLIANNA] Meow!

107
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,500
[YAJIMA] That was
one of the best battles

108
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:46,916
I've seen in a while!

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,708
[LAHAR] There are so many
varieties of magic that

110
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:51,750
have been used in the games
so far. It's quite fascinating.

111
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,291
She's come a long way.
I'm proud of her.

112
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,250
Her score on the Magic
Power Finder was enough

113
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,750
to convince me
that she's strong,

114
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,000
but she's downright
scary with those tubes.

115
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,500
Yeah, no kidding.
Real scary.

116
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,750
Gotta admit, even I had
a hard time against her

117
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:07,000
back in the day.

118
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,666
I have never
stopped hating Jellal.

119
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,916
Okay, moving on to the second
match of the battle segment.

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,875
[CHAPATI] Let's hear it
for the "minstrel who sings

121
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:21,541
to the red moon,"
Sabertooth's Rufus Lore!

122
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:25,875
[FEMALE CROWD cheers]

123
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,875
[CHAPATI] He'll be facing
off against Blue Pegasus'

124
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,541
"Holy Night," Eve Tilm!

125
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:35,750
[CROWD cheers]

126
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,625
Go, Eve! May you have
the parfum of victory!

127
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,916
You can beat this clown!

128
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,291
You've got
this man! Yeah!

129
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,833
[CHAPATI] Rufus spanked
the little guy on day one.

130
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,500
But will he get
his comeuppance today?

131
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,666
Snow Magic, Blow White Fury!

132
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,958
[RUFUS] What you struck
was merely a memory of me.

133
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,166
Hm?

134
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,625
[EVE] I got a taste
of your techniques

135
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,083
during the Hidden game.

136
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,375
And I've got 'em
all memorized now!

137
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:06,416
Oh really,
is that so? Well...

138
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,875
Man.

139
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,916
[EVE] Master Ichiya? What
the heck are you doin' here?

140
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,291
Seems you've been fooled
by your own memory.

141
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,125
[EVE] Ahhh!

142
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,166
[ICHIYA] Man.

143
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,583
Don't tell me this is
somewhere deep in his memory!

144
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,291
Yeah, no kidding. You've got
some explaining to do, sir!

145
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,750
Please believe me when I
say that I have absolutely

146
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,916
no memory of this
scandalous perfum, man!

147
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,375
[RUFUS] Night of Shooting Stars!

148
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:40,000
Oh! Eve has taken
a direct hit from Rufus!

149
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,125
[CHAPATI] Well, I'll be!

150
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,583
Turns out it was just
a copy made of snow!

151
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,750
Now that is an
impressive perfum!

152
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,416
All right! Score!

153
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,916
Show him how we do it!

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,500
If I'm not mistaken, Eve
used to work for the Council,

155
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,750
didn't he?

156
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,541
[LAHAR] That's right.
It was many years ago,

157
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,208
but he started off as a Custody

00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,583
Yeah, listen to 'im!

314
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:22,416
Don't give up! You can
still take him, Laxus!

315
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,458
[ALEXEI] It must be nice
to know your guild mates

316
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,041
hold you in such high regard.

317
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,583
I'm sure they're
absolutely heartbroken.

318
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:33,041
Watching you fall to
your enemy like this.

319
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,791
Throw down some lightning!

320
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,375
[ALL gasp]

321
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,250
I don't get it.
This plan of yours

322
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,500
doesn't make any sense at all.

323
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,166
[ALEXEI] No?

324
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,666
What's the point in
beating me with an illusion?

325
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,833
I mean, can you
call that a win?

326
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,250
[ALEXEI] Obviously,
victory in this match

327
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,791
is not our ultimate goal.

328
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:55,833
The purpose of the illusion is
to distract those around us.

329
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,250
[LAXUS] Huh?

330
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,208
[ALEXEI] And if I
control the illusion,

331
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:04,041
I control the outcome
of the match as well.

332
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,750
Control it? How so?

333
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,458
[NATSU, WENDY, GRAY,
and LUCY] Laxus!

334
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,250
Show him what you can do!

335
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,458
Stay strong!

336
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:16,916
[LAXUS struggling]

337
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,791
[grunts]

338
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,250
Whoa! It looks
as though Laxus

339
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:30,291
is back in the game,
ladies and gentlemen!

340
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,750
[grunting]

341
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:43,916
--[ALL cheering]
--[MAKAROV] Aw, yeah!

342
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,458
That's the spirit, Laxus m'boy!

343
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,500
Yes! There ya go!

344
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,833
Now that's what
I'm talkin' about!

345
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,833
Well, he's
finally back in action.

346
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,500
Seems that way.

347
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,750
[LAXUS yells]

348
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,875
--[WARREN] Hm-hrmmm!
--[MAKAROV] Yeah!

349
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,208
That oughta do it!

350
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,708
After all that, we had
no reason to worry. Right?

351
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,833
Yep!

352
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,750
[WARREN] Thanks for
the help, Bisca!

353
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,250
Sure thing.

354
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,625
[WARREN] Lisanna, you and
the Thunder Legion rocked too!

355
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,541
Glad they
didn't try anything.

356
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,416
To think that I was
honestly worried about him

357
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,000
losing for a second
there! Silly me!

358
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,833
[LAXUS] Ahhhh--uh!

359
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,250
--[ALL gasp]
--[MAKAROV] What the--?

360
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,208
No, Laxus!

361
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:41,458
[CHAPATI] And just like that,
the tables have turned again!

362
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:44,291
Laxus better step it up
or he'll be dead meat!

363
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,000
Get up, man!

364
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,541
What in the hell
is goin' on here?

365
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,291
So that's your idea of
controlling the match.

366
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,666
Y'think I care?

367
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,791
[ALEXEI] The point is,
I can arrange for you to win

368
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:07,500
this match depending on
how our negotiations fare.

369
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,333
[LAXUS] Ain't no way
I'm fallin' for that.

370
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:13,833
I don't really give a crap
about your stupid illusion.

371
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,958
But I can't wait to get
my hands on the real you

372
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,333
so I can defeat ya here and now!

373
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,791
[FLARE] That's not
going to happen.

374
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,666
[chuckles]

375
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,875
Reality can be
pretty harsh sometimes.

376
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,041
[ALEXEI]
Your power is impressive,

377
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,041
but not even the
strongest of wizards

378
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,875
could defeat all of
Raven Tail at once.

379
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,416
[BLACKSNAKE chuckles]

380
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,125
[ALEXEI] There's one
more thing to consider.

381
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:47,375
[IVAN] I'm sure you're aware
of just how powerful I am.

382
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,208
Aren't you, my boy?

383
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,875
Y'know, I had a feeling
you were behind that mask.

384
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,833
My deadbeat dad.

385
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:00,291
[IVAN] Makarov would rather
die than reveal the secret.

386
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,250
[grunting]

387
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,750
On the other hand,
you're a different story.

388
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:17,250
[IVAN] Surely I can
depend on my son.

389
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:20,875
Now, tell me where to
find the Lumen Histoire.

390
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,291
Sorry, never heard of it.

391
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,708
Don't try to play dumb with me.

392
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:26,875
[LAXUS] I'm not.

393
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,666
If Makarov was to tell anyone

394
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,833
it would be his
beloved grandson.

395
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,416
Guess not 'cause I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

396
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,166
He must have told you
something about it!

397
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,375
Nope, but even if
the old, geezer had,

398
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,916
it's not like I
would ever tell you.

399
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,458
[IVAN] Come now. I'm offering
you the opportunity

400
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,625
to emerge victorious
from what is otherwise

401
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,416
an utterly hopeless situation.

402
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,291
[IVAN] If you dare
to refuse my terms...

403
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,208
your illusory form
won't be the only one

404
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,833
getting a thrashing.

405
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,083
You think you can scare me?

406
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,750
Better think again, old man.

407
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:05,541
[LAXUS] It's no wonder the
old geezer gave up on you.

408
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,250
Come at me. All of you.

409
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,250
If you're an enemy of
Fairy Tail's master,

410
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,500
then that makes
you my enemy, too.

411
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,333
[IVAN] I think it's
about time for your father

412
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,458
to teach you an
important lesson.

413
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:21,500
The guild standing before you
was created for one reason.

414
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:24,791
To take down Fairy
Tail once and for all.

415
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,291
[FLARE and NALPUDDING chuckle]

416
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:30,291
[OBRA and BLACKSNAKE chuckle]

417
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:35,791
[RAVEN TAIL chucikles]

418
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,833
[NATSU] I wish I knew what
was goin' on with Laxus.

419
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,541
[HAPPY] What if those
Raven Tail jerks are up to

420
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:17,875
their old tricks again?

421
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,541
[NATSU] I doubt that.
Everybody's watching 'em.

422
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,041
[HAPPY] Maybe he's
just havin' a bad day

423
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,208
and it's throwin' him off.

424
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:23,375
[NATSU] Like he ate
too much last night

425
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:24,541
and now he's feelin' sick?

426
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:25,875
[HAPPY] Or he drank too much!

427
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,875
[NATSU] Yeah! Wait, I bet
it's a personal problem!

428
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:30,833
He's prob'ly lonely 'cause he
doesn't have that many friends.

429
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:33,750
[HAPPY and NATSU] Next time:
"Wendy versus Shelia!"

430
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,250
[HAPPY] Nah, I know
what's buggin' him.

431
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:36,458
[NATSU] Oh, yeah? What?

432
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:37,916
[HAPPY] The poor guy's
gotta be worn out...

433
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,750
from dealin'
with your stupidity!

434
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,833
[laughs]
