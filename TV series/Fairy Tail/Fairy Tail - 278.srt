1
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,875
Magnolia used to be
a town full of life.

2
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:32,166
And our guild was at its heart.

3
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,541
But those warm and
joyous days are gone.

4
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:35,916
[NATSU snores]

5
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:42,666
I'll take all the
fish. So yummy.

6
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:47,125
Oh, my hot icy, hunk.

7
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,500
Cherish those dreams.

8
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,500
And rest well.

9
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:58,583
[ERZA] Because this may be the
final dawn we face together.

10
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,541
[ERZA]
We'll need our strength.

11
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,125
And each other.

12
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:06,833
[NATSU]
The final one?

13
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:08,625
Not if I can help it.

14
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:09,916
Yeah, that's right.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,916
Because we're not backing
down no matter what.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,083
We're still here.

17
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,750
And we're ready to fight.

18
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,041
It'll be tough,

19
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:19,541
but Fairy Tail isn't gonna
give up that easily.

20
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:22,208
Come on, let's go.

21
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,125
[NATSU] We'll bust in
and get our guild back!

22
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:29,458
[NATSU]
For the sake of our future.

23
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:31,916
For Fairy Tail.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,083
We shall.

25
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,208
Damn straight!

26
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:36,250
Indeed!

27
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,500
Aye, Sir!

28
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:41,125
[LUCY]
And on that morning, it began.

29
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:44,833
Together, we raced toward
Fairy Tail's final battle.

30
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,250
[ANNA]
The time is upon us.

31
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:09,166
Ugh. My belly is
so sad and empty.

32
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,000
[HAPPY] I guess I could give
you my fish if you need it.

33
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,458
[NATSU] Meh. Not unless
it's been cooked.

34
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,708
[HAPPY]
Are you crazy?!

35
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:19,000
Fish is at its yummiest
when it's raw and slimy.

36
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,833
I gotta wonder how
many times I've heard

37
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,291
this exact same argument before.

38
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,500
It's been a whole year
since we've been together,

39
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,833
but you guys make it seem
like no time has passed.

40
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:31,916
[NATSU] Speaking of time...
Lucy, are we there yet?

41
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,375
[LUCY] I think it's just
a little bit farther.

42
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:36,833
[LUCY screams]

43
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,041
[LUCY]
Whoa! That's huge!

44
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,000
And so adorable! What is it?

45
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,666
Wait, I think I know what
kind of monster this is.

46
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,375
First, it lures people
in with its fluffy fur,

47
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:48,041
then it gobbles them
up in a single bite!

48
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,208
[LUCY screams]

49
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,875
[snorts]

50
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,333
[roars]

51
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:54,666
[LUCY screaming]

52
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,875
Natsu! Time to roast this pig!

53
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,166
[NATSU]
Not really feelin' it.

54
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,541
What did you say?

55
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,125
I heard these things are
supposed to be super tasty!

56
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,208
Yeah? Come on!

57
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,833
[GIANT PIG  roaring]

58
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,208
[yells]

59
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,375
[GIANT PIG squeals]

60
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,958
He's goin' in my belly, pronto!

61
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,166
So, do you prefer your
meat cooked or raw?

62
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,833
[LUCY]
Seriously?

63
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,208
[NATSU] There's nothin' like
a meal you make yourself!

64
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,125
[LUCY] I gotta say, it tastes
way better than it looks.

65
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:29,750
[HAPPY] You guys can keep it.
I'm a 100% raw fish kinda cat.

66
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,041
[sighs]

67
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,500
What's the matter?
Ya full already?

68
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,833
[LUCY]
I was just thinking about stuff.

69
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,208
That last battle feels
like forever ago.

70
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,083
[NATSU, HAPPY]
Hm?

71
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,166
[LUCY]
Against Tartaros.

72
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:54,291
[LUCY] We'd never fought
against anyone so powerful.

73
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,583
But still, we rose
to the occasion

74
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,750
and gave it everything we had.

75
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:03,541
We did. And it
sure wasn't easy.

76
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:24,208
But we pulled it off.
Just like always.

77
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,750
You're right.

78
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,500
Don't you guys think that this
whole thing is kinda unfair?

79
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:29,291
[LUCY]
Whaddaya mean?

80
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,958
We scored a huge victory,

81
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,916
and master Makarov went and
broke up the guild anyway.

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,333
[LUCY]
Yeah.

83
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:38,958
I know he had his reasons
for doing it, but still...

84
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:39,958
[HAPPY]
What?

85
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,666
I never gave up on the dream.

86
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,958
That we'd all be together again.

87
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:48,166
I know I've said it
before, but it's true.

88
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,416
I'm so glad that we
finally found each other.

89
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,791
Now the three of us can go
look for the other members.

90
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,666
They're all out there somewhere.

91
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,958
[HAPPY]
Hey! What's the big idea?!

92
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,541
I told you nothin'
beats the flavor

93
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,041
of a perfectly grilled fish!

94
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:07,166
[HAPPY] Come on, ya big meanie,
make it raw again! Please!

95
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,416
Yeah, okay.
Check this out, Happy!

96
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,916
[HAPPY screams]

97
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,333
[HAPPY]
No! That's not raw!

98
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,708
You're gonna turn it into
ashes, ya stupid jerk!

99
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,166
[NATSU]
Whoops! Oh, you're right!

100
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,208
Sorry, buddy! Hey, don't cry!

101
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,291
I'll go out...

102
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,916
[LUCY]
Well, so much for nostalgia.

103
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,375
[NATSU]
I promise!

104
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,333
[HAPPY]
Where are we now?

105
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,000
[LUCY]
Tuly Village.

106
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,041
What do you guys think about

107
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,750
getting a room here
for the night?

108
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,541
Aye, aye!

109
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,916
Uh. Somethin' wrong, pal?

110
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,625
[NATSU]
Huh...

111
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,083
[HAPPY]
Whoa, isn't that the clock tower

112
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,916
you demolished a while back?

113
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,083
[NATSU] Yeah. Looks like
they were able to fix it.

114
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:48,291
[HAPPY] Sorta. But the new
part doesn't quite match.

115
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,458
[NATSU]
Nah.

116
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:50,166
[LUCY]
Hm?

117
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,791
Should I trash it again?

118
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,708
Of course not, ya flame brain!

119
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,083
[NATSU grunting]

120
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,416
[screams]

121
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
I'm goin' crazy!

122
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,916
A whole year trainin' my
butt off to get stronger,

123
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,083
and for what?

124
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,416
I fought the winners
of the magic games,

125
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,750
but they were all sucky.

126
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,416
I barely even broke a
sweat with those losers!

127
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,583
I had a plan to come back
and put Gray in his place.

128
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,666
And then it was gonna be
on to Erza and Laxus,

129
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,625
the big 'ol lightning dolt!

130
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,250
Yeah, well, Gray's one thing,

131
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,166
but fighting Erza and Laxus
would be pretty crazy.

132
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,916
[LUCY]
You think Gray's easy?

133
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,416
I got an idea, Lucy.

134
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,250
Let's get it on!

135
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,250
[LUCY]
What? No way!

136
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,708
That's the answer you were
expecting, weren't you?

137
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,000
But actually, I've been doing

138
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,333
some super-secret
training on my own.

139
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,666
[NATSU]
Huh?

140
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,208
[LUCY] I mean, I know that
I could never beat you

141
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,541
in a serious fight,

142
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,750
but I'm down to spar
with you sometime.

143
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,208
Hold that thought.

144
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,000
What now?

145
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,000
[LUCY screams]

146
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,125
No, please don't!

147
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,625
All my tools are in there!

148
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,375
I can't work without
them! Please!

149
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,125
Sorry, old timer!

150
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,958
Ya shoulda come out
here with some protection

151
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,125
if ya didn't want bad
stuff to happen to ya!

152
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,000
[BANDIT A]
Yeah, geezer!

156

[LUCY]
Jeez!

157
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,333
Were you trying to
kill me just now?

158
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,416
Nope, just doin' my job, Lucy.

159
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,250
[LUCY] Well, just so you know,
I have gotten really strong.

160
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,791
[NATSU] Cool, but I'm still
not feelin' fired up.

161

I gathered as much

But Fiore's big,

167

So, nobody?

I think we should probably start
heading toward the southeast.

Surely we can turn up
some leads in Marguerite.

[TOBY] And that's why we're
all ready to say good bye

318
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,250
without making a scene!

319
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,291
[YUKA]
Like that?

320
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,708
But why can't you come with us?

321
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,500
[WENDY]
Because...

322
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,291
[CARLA]
She's clearly made up her mind.

323
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,833
So please don't
berate her for it.

324
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,583
Don't get mad.

325
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,541
[LUCY]
How is she human?

326
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,166
[HAPPY]
How is she human?

327
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,708
How the heck are you human?!

328
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:35,250
Oh, this? I mastered my
transformation ability.

329
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,375
This form both increases
my magic power

330
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,000
and enhances my clairvoyance.

331
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,750
So what do you think, Happy?

332
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,291
Well, I trained for a
whole year too, ya know?

333
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:47,000
And I've come a long way.

334
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:50,125
Now I'm able to wait a little
while before I eat my fishies!

335
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,583
[CARLA]
How does that count as training?

336
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:57,166
This is no small decision,
Wendy. So be sure!

337
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,291
[HAPPY] Oh, your kitty
form is just the cutest!

338
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,875
[ALL]
You're really gonna stay?

339
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,666
Honestly.

340
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:20,375
[sighs]

341
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,625
[grunting]

342
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,250
[HAPPY gasping]

343
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,750
[LUCY groaning]

344
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,500
[LUCY]
Uhh...

345
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,583
[laughing]

346
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,875
Stop it! You're gonna
make me wet the bed!

347
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,500
Hands off while I'm
in bed, got it?

348
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,041
[NATSU, HAPPY groan]

349
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,791
Don't be so hard on us.

350
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,041
The whole thing's
just got us in shock.

351
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,791
[HAPPY]
Aye.

352
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,250
I know what you mean by that.

353
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,625
Makes you wonder
if the others'll

354
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,500
feel the same way she does.

355
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,458
I ain't givin' up! No way!

356
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,750
Even if I gotta kidnap
her, she's comin'!

357
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,500
[LUCY]
Don't you dare!

358
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,958
[SHELIA] Hey, Wendy, about
what happened earlier...

359
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,458
[WENDY]
It's fine.

360
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:08,708
I promise that I'm
not gonna go anywhere!

361
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,000
Sherry moved out
when she got married.

362
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,166
That had to be tough on you.

363
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,916
And if I leave, that means
you're gonna be left all alone.

364
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,291
Well, I don't really
see it that way.

365
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,625
[WENDY]
Huh?

366
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,750
I'll still be right here
with all of my guild mates

367
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,250
by my side.

368
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,958
I mean, we're like a big
family too, you know.

369
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:34,000
So you shouldn't stick around
because you feel sorry for me.

370
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,541
I want you to do what
makes you happy.

371
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,958
[bang]

372
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,833
What was that? That crash?

373
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,458
It came from the guild!

374
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,250
[PEOPLE screaming]

375
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,333
[LYON]
Get the citizens to safety!

376
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,458
[TOBY howling]

377
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:55,916
[YUKA]
This way!

378
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:00,416
[NATSU]
What's goin' on?

379
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,625
[LYON]
Natsu!

380
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,375
[gasps]

381
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,416
The town's under attack!

382
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,625
[LYON] All of a sudden,
a horde of monsters

383
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,458
just appeared out of nowhere.

384
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:14,750
Like a bunch of 'em?

385
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:15,958
That's crazy!

386
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,541
I bet the Orochi Fin
guild is behind this!

387
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,166
Those guys have been
trying to take us down

388
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,666
for as long as I can remember!

389
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,958
[LUCY]
Whoa, really?

390
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,000
They're so obsessed with
attacking our guild,

391
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,166
they don't care how many
innocent people get hurt.

392
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,791
And since Jura isn't
here right now,

393
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,875
we're missing our
strongest member.

394
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,000
The big festival gave them
the perfect opportunity

395
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,250
to catch us off guard.

396
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,375
They're gonna pay for this.

397
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,458
[YUKA]
Lyon!

398
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,250
This is just the
first wave of them!

399
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,750
There's a massive
swarm of monsters

400
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:43,875
coming in from the east!

401
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,875
Yeah, like a hundred thousand!

402
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,625
That many?

403
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,166
We don't stand a chance
against an army of monsters.

404
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,916
All this for revenge.

405
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,958
Orochi scum!

406
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,875
This is gonna be a
real show, fellas.

407
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,000
And this is the perfect place

408
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,333
to watch the whole
thing go down.

409
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,666
[OROCHI C]
With Old Man Jura gone,

410
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,291
this will be like taking
candy from a baby.

411
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,500
They're going to waste all
their precious magic power

412
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,416
fighting my monsters.

413
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,791
And then we'll crush them.

414
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:23,833
[MONSTERS roaring]

415
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,791
It appears as though they have
a monster tamer on their side.

416
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,000
It does. If we can
just take him out--

417
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,875
With so many beasts swarming in,
that could prove impossible.

418
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,875
[TOBY screams]

419
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,083
There has to be a way.

420
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,333
We can just go up!

421
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,750
Right over their heads!

422
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,541
That's true.

423
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,375
You'd be willing to help us out?

424
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,208
Of course I would!

425
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,625
'Cause I'm fired up now!

Let's go, Happy!

Aye, aye, to the sky!

00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:57,125
Sorry about that, Natsu!

430
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:00,541
Okay.

431
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,833
[SHELIA] Come on, Happy,
we gotta keep going!

432

[HAPPY]
Uh... aye?

433
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,166
They're attacking our guild,

so it's up to us to
save it ourselves!

[TOBY] I've never seen
so many monsters!

We must hold them
off at all cost.

[LUCY] Orochi Fin unleashed
a massive horde of monsters

454
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,666
on Marguerite,
Lamia Scale's hometown.

455
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,291
And so, the Sky Sisters,
Wendy and Shelia,

456
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:47,583
fly through the air together
to protect their guild

and the frightened townspeople.

458
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:50,750
They're going over the monsters

459

to strike the wizard
controlling the swarm.

460
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:56,125
Unfortunately, one of the most
powerful foes we've ever seen

is waiting for them
on the other side.
