1
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,833
- Makarov:
PREVIOUSLY ON "FAIRY TAIL."

2
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:21,791
- Happy: AY, SIR!
THIS YEAR'S S-CLASS

3
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,125
WIZARD PROMOTION TRIAL
STARTED OFF WITH A BANG.

4
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:26,375
- Natsu: ERZA AND MIRAJANE
BOTH HAD TO PASS THIS TEST

5
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,125
BEFORE THEY GOT TO
LEVEL UP IN THE GUILD.

6
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:30,291
I'M TOTALLY FIRED UP 
ABOUT GOING BIG TIME!

7
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,541
- Lucy: I'M JUST GLAD
ROUND ONE'S FINALLY OVER.

8
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,708
- Happy: OH, MAN.
THAT WAS A SUPER HARD ONE.

9
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,875
- Natsu: SO WHAT'S THE SECOND
ROUND GONNA BE AGAIN?

10
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,375
- Lucy: WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO FIND THE GRAVE

11
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,416
OF FAIRY TAIL'S
FIRST MASTER, MAVIS.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,875
- Natsu: BUT WE GOT INTERRUPTED
BY SOME CREEPY CRYBABY.

13
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:45,000
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF
A BIG TEST HERE, PAL! 

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,375
- ( theme music playing )

15
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:04,208
- ( singing in Japanese )

16
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,500
- I WAS WONDERING
ABOUT SOMETHING. 

17
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,500
DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW
WHAT KIND OF MAGIC MEST USES?

18
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,875
- OH, YES. YOU'RE STILL
SOMEWHAT NEW TO THE GUILD.

19
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:38,500
YOU KNOW, HONESTLY,
I'M NOT SURE.

20
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,916
- I FIND THAT TO BE
RATHER PECULIAR.

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,333
- YES, WELL...

22
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,791
- HOLD ON.
ARE YOU IMPLYING

23
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,375
THAT THIS MEST FELLOW
MIGHT NOT ACTUALLY

24
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,291
BE A MEMBER OF
THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD?

25
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,208
- ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT 
THE FIRST TIME I MET HIM

26
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,375
I GOT A STRANGE FEELING.

27
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,708
SO I'VE TRIED TO THINK ABOUT
WHAT I DO AND DO NOT KNOW

28
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:54,708
ABOUT HIM.

29
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,291
WHAT I DO KNOW
IS CRYSTAL CLEAR.

30
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:59,125
- Carla: WHAT?
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

31
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,958
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?

32
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,750
- Pantherlily:
WHAT I MEAN IS THIS.

33
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,125
I'VE BARELY SPOKEN TO HIM,

34
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,375
BUT THERE ARE
THINGS ABOUT HIM

35
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,708
I KNOW WITH COMPLETE
CERTAINTY,

36
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,458
AS IF I CAN SEE THEM.

37
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,541
HIS NAME IS MEST GRYDER.

38
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,791
HE'S THE EARTH LAND PUPIL
OF MY PRINCE,

39
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,375
WHOM YOU CALL MYSTOGAN.

40
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,875
HE COMPETED IN LAST YEAR'S
S-CLASS TRIAL,

41
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,000
BUT HE DID NOT PASS.

42
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,125
AND THAT'S ALL.

43
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,041
I FEEL AS THOUGH I SHOULD
KNOW MORE ABOUT HIM,

44
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,458
BUT IT'S ALL JUST A HAZE.

45
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,916
- I EXPLICITLY TOLD WENDY

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,416
SHE SHOULD BY NO MEANS
ASSOCIATE WITH THAT MAN.

47
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,000
- WELL, WE CAN'T
CHANGE THAT NOW,

48
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,250
BUT HOPEFULLY
OUR FEARS ARE UNFOUNDED.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,166
- I'VE NEVER SEEN
FLOWERS LIKE THESE BEFORE.

50
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,791
THEY'RE SO PRETTY,
YOU SEE?

51
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,000
( gasps )

52
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,750
( screams )

53
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,500
- I MUST KNOW. 
I MUST FIND OUT

54
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,166
WHAT THESE NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN
FLOWERS TASTE LIKE.

55
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,833
- BUT THE FLOWERS
ARE FOR LOOKING AT.

56
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,041
THEY'RE NOT FOR EATING.

57
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,166
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
NATSU?

58
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,000
I THOUGHT WE WERE
GONNA GO TO THE TOP.

59
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,666
- THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE GOTTA
DO FIRST, LITTLE BUDDY.

60
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,416
I GOTTA FIND THAT
TEARY-EYED JERK

61
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,166
THAT MESSED UP THE SCARF
THAT IGNEEL GAVE ME

62
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,166
AND REALLY GIVE HIM
SOMETHING TO CRY ABOUT.

63
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,333
- HOW ARE WE GONNA LOOK FOR HIM
AND LOOK FOR MAVIS' GRAVE

64
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,083
AT THE SAME TIME?

65
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,208
IT'D BE A LOT EASIER 
IF YOU JUST PICK ONE.

66
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,625
- IT'LL BE WAY FASTER
TO DO THEM BOTH AT ONCE!

67
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,583
- I DON'T THINK IT'S
GONNA WORK THAT WAY.

68
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,791
- ( clucking )

69
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,041
- WHY ARE YOU CREEPS
EVEN HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE?

70
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,041
- ( chuckles )

71
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,458
WE HAVE COME HERE

72
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,208
IN ORDER TO HUNT DOWN
ALL THE FAIRIES!

73
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,625
- ( gasps )

74
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,000
- Happy: IRON SOUL.

75
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,125
- THAT'S SO LOUD!

76
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,708
IT'S KILLING MY EARS!

77
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,875
HE'S USING MAGIC WRITING.

78
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,458
THAT'S JUST LIKE
WHAT YOU DO.

79
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,458
AIN'T THAT RIGHT?
HEY, LEVY!

80
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,625
- I'M ALMOST POSITIVE THAT
HE'S USING THE EASTERN VERSION

81
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,708
OF SOLID SCRIPT MAGIC.
( gasps )

82
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,458
- ( grunts )
- GAJEEL!

83
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,666
HE'S COMING RIGHT FOR US.

84
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,208
HE CAN'T HEAR ME.

85
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,208
- ( squawks )

86
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,708
- ( gasps )
- ( squawks )

87
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,416
- ARE THOSE EGGS?

88
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,125
( gasps )
- EGG BUSTER!

89
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,250
- ( groans )

90
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,916
( grunts, gasps )

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,416
- ( grunts )

92
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,250
- Gajeel: OH, MAN.
I COULDN'T HEAR HIM COMING

93
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,375
OVER ALL THE DANG NOISE.

94
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,958
- ( grunts )

95
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,041
- ( gasps )

96
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,416
- GAJEEL!
( screams )

97
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,416
SOLID SCRIPT!

98
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,750
SILENT!

99
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,208
- ( squawks )

100
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,208
- SHE TURNED DOWN 
THE VOLUME ON YOU.

101
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,541
- HOW DARE THAT
INSOLENT LITTLE GIRL

102
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,666
ERASE WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN.

103
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,916
- MY TURN.

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,250
( grunts )

105
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,125
- ( gasps )

106
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,875
( clucking )

107
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,541
- NOW, FIRE!

108
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,250
- ( squawks )

109
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,791
- SLIDE, SLIDE, SLIDE, SLIDE.

110
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,083
YOU SHALL PAY!

111
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,458
( grunts )

112
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,500
SLICE!
ZUBABABA!

113
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:00,708
- ( gasps )

114
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:06,583
- ( grunts )

115
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,625
SLICE!
ZUBABABA!

116
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,833
- ( grunts )

117
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,125
( panting )

118
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,833
MAN...

119
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,541
THIS GUY IS INTENSE.

120
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,500
- ( chuckles )

121
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,166
- ( squawks )

122
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,708
( grunts )

123
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,500
- FIRE.

124
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:32,583
THERE'S TOO MANY OF THEM.

125
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,875
( screams )

126
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,208
- NO, LEVY!
( gasps )

127
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,208
- ( shouts )

128
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,250
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

129
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:46,041
HE'S ACTUALLY CUTTING
THROUGH MY SCALES.

130
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,083
- ( grunts )

131
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,625
PIERCE!

132
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,500
- ( grunts )

133
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:53,666
( groans )

134
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,250
- KASHA.

135
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,000
NOW MY DARK SWORD TECHNIQUE.

136
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,166
- ( grunts )
NO.  PLEASE STOP.

137
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,375
- NARUKAMI!

138
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,375
- ( gasps )

139
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,875
- SLICE SLICE SLICE SLICE!

140
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,416
SLICE!

141
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,333
JAKI.
- ( screams )

142
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,791
- GAJEEL!

143
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,750
- ( grunts )

144
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,708
- GAJEEL?

145
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,000
- IF THE REST OF THE GUILD
ARE AS WEAK AS THESE TWO, 

146
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,041
WE VERY WELL MAY
DISPOSE OF THEM ALL

147
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,875
BEFORE THE MAIN FORCE ARRIVES.

148
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,500
- LET'S TAKE THEM ALL DOWN.

149
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,375
- ( grunts )

150
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,875
THERE'S MORE OF YOU
SCUMBAGS?

151
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,083
- THIS ONE'S STILL
CLUCKING AWAY.

152
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,083
- ( chuckles ) WE'RE MERELY
THE RECONNAISSANCE TEAM.

153
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,666
THE REST OF GRIMOIRE HEART
WILL BE ARRIVING SHORTLY. 

154
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,250
- ( gasps )
- WHAT?

155
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,916
THE REST OF THE GUILD?

156
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,541
- Gajeel: LEVY, RUN.
- ( gasps )

157
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,666
- THIS AIN'T GONNA BE
SOME SIMPLE LITTLE FIGHT.

158
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,833
IT'LL BE WORSE
THAN WE CAN IMAGINE.

159
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,416
- BUT I CAN'T JUST LEAVE YOU.
- GET OUT OF HERE!

160
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
YOU GOTTA TELL
THE OTHERS WHAT'S GOING ON.

161
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:00,791
I'LL BE OKAY.

162
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:04,250
I CAN HANDLE THESE GUYS,
SO MOVE IT!

163
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,250
- ( crying )

164
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,750
- YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

165
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,166
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- WHAT'D I JUST TELL YOU, LEVY?

166
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,166
NOW GET MOVING!

167
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,166
THAT'S IRON.

168
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:22,416
- Levy: STAY STRONG, PLEASE.

169
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,708
- ( grunts )

170
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,791
- HUH.  HOW UNFORTUNATE.

171
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,458
WE LET THE LITTLE GIRL ESCAPE.

172
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,375
- THAT ONE'S GOT
QUITE A BIT OF PLUCK.

173
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,291
HUNTING HER DOWN WILL BE
EVEN MORE FUN.

174
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,708
- ( both gasp )

175
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:43,000
- YOU THINK YOU WANT TO GO
TO WAR WITH FAIRY TAIL, DO YOU?

176
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,416
- ( gasps )
HE HAS THE STRENGTH TO STAND?

177
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,458
- I DID TOO.

178
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,375
WAY BACK WHEN.

179
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,458
- MESSING WITH FAIRY TAIL
IS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE

180
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,750
YOU'VE EVER MADE!

181
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,791
- ( chuckles )
ARE YOU READY?

182
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:04,041
YOU'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT
JUST HOW BAD YOU SCREWED UP.

183
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,500
- ( Levy panting )

184
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,958
I'VE GOT TO LET EVERYBODY KNOW
WE'RE IN BIG TROUBLE.

185
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:12,125
GRIMOIRE HEART IS GONNA
BE HERE ANY MINUTE NOW.

186
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,083
I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
THEY WANT FROM US,

187
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:17,250
BUT THINGS ARE ABOUT
TO GET REALLY SCARY.

188
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,666
( gasps )

189
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,166
( grunting )

190
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,875
( groans )

191
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,875
HOLD ON, GAJEEL.

192
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:34,208
- IRON DRAGON ROAR!

193
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,583
- DEFENSE.

194
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,125
- ( squawks )
- ( gasps )

195
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,750
- ( clucking )

196
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,125
- WHAT IN THE--?

197
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,958
- LOOK ABOVE YOUR HEAD,
YOU FOOL.

198
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,541
- ( gasps )

199
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,375
- HEAVY EGG RAIN!

200
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,916
- ( grunts )

201
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,333
HUH?

202
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,750
( grunting )

203
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,500
- SHUBABABABABA!

204
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,125
- ( straining )

205
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,375
KEEP DREAMING, BUDDY.

206
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,791
THAT DULL LITTLE
POCKET KNIFE YOU GOT

207
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,625
AIN'T CUTTING
THROUGH MY STEEL!

208
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,541
( grunts )

209
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,000
- ( squawks )

210
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,791
- STOP YOUR CLUCKING.

211
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,875
- ( squawks )

212
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,291
- PIERCE!

213
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,208
- ( gasps )

214
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,791
- I WILL RUN YOU
RIGHT THROUGH.

215
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:33,166
WHAT?

216
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,583
- ( grunts )

217
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:36,958
( chuckles )

218
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:40,000
LOSING AIN'T
AN OPTION FOR ME.

219
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,958
- ( grunts )
DAMN IT.

220
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,416
- YOU HEAR ME?

221
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,375
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN!

222
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,583
- Erza: LEVY, WAKE UP.

223
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:57,708
LEVY!

224
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:03,000
- HOW'D YOU MANAGE
TO GET SUCH AWFUL INJURIES?

225
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,916
- IT'S YOU.
THANK GOODNESS.

226
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,083
- MY WORD,
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

227
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,541
- WE'RE IN REAL TROUBLE.

228
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:10,916
AND HE NEEDS HELP.

229
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,416
- ( grunting )

230
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,541
- ( chuckles )

231
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,125
- ( screams )

232
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,208
TAKING ON FAIRY TAIL
LIKE THIS...

233
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:30,166
THESE IDIOTS ARE JUST
AS THICK-HEADED AS I WAS.

234
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:36,416
- Narrator: GAJEEL WAS ONCE PART
OF ANOTHER LESS FRIENDLY GUILD

235
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,875
KNOWN AS PHANTOM LORD.

236
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,958
THEY SUCCEEDED IN DESTROYING
THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD HALL

237
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,208
AND EVEN TAKING LUCY PRISONER.

238
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:48,333
THEY CAME VERY CLOSE TO
WIPING OUT FAIRY TAIL FOREVER.

239
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,666
LUCKILY THEY WERE DEFEATED
IN THE NICK OF TIME

240
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,333
AND THE GUILD WAS DISBANDED.

241
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:56,000
THE WIZARDS WHO WERE ONCE
PART OF THAT BAND OF HOOLIGANS

242
00:11:56,083 --> 00:12:00,333
WENT THEIR SEPARATE WAYS
AND BEGAN NEW LIVES ELSEWHERE.

243
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:01,541
HOWEVER...

244
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,083
- ( groans )

245
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,750
- HEY THERE.

246
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,208
- ( gasps )

247
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:16,583
YOU'RE MASTER MAKAROV.
- ( chuckles )

248
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,083
- ( sighs )

249
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,166
SO DID YOU COME HERE
TO GLOAT?

250
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,000
- ( grunts )

251
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,250
WHAT A NICE HELLO INDEED.

252
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,250
NOT BIG ON MANNERS,
ARE YOU?

253
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:32,541
YOUR FRIEND JUVIA IS
THE NEWEST MEMBER OF OUR GUILD.

254
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:33,875
- YOU KIDDING ME?

255
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,125
- NO, SIR.
SHE WAS VERY CONCERNED

256
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,458
ABOUT YOUR WELL-BEING
AFTER ALL THAT HAPPENED.

257
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,208
- CHICK'S GOT
RAIN FOR BRAINS.

258
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,708
WHAT IS SHE THINKING?

259
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,125
( sighs )

260
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,625
- HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT 
WHAT YOUR NEXT MOVE IS?

261
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,125
- MY NEXT MOVE?

262
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,541
I DON'T KNOW JUST YET.

263
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,708
KEEPING MY OPTIONS OPEN,
I GUESS.

264
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,666
- ( sighs )

265
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:02,125
I HAVE ANOTHER
QUESTION FOR YOU.

266
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,666
- SO, SHOOT.

267
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,875
- WHEN YOU REFLECT ON IT,

268
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,750
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
WERE YOUR OWN REASONS

269
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,000
FOR GOING TO WAR
WITH FAIRY TAIL?

270
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,666
- HMM?

271
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,750
- WHAT DID BEING PART OF 
PHANTOM LORD MEAN TO YOU?

272
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:18,583
FOR THAT MATTER, WHAT DID THE
IDEA OF A GUILD MEAN TO YOU?

273
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,875
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO
WITH THE POWERS YOU POSSESS?

274
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,166
- ( sighs )

275
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,000
YOU SURE GOT A LOT OF
QUESTIONS, OLD MAN.

276
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,458
- THEY'RE ALL THE SAME.

277
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:33,750
WHAT KIND OF MAN DO YOU
TELL YOURSELF YOU ARE? 

278
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,583
AND IS THAT MAN
THE SAME PERSON

279
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,708
WHO LIVES INSIDE
YOUR HEART?

280
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,250
IF JOSE ASKED IT OF YOU,

281
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,833
WOULD YOU TAKE 
A LIFE FOR HIM?

282
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,750
IS HIS POWER ABSOLUTE?

283
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,666
IS HIS EVERY WISH
YOUR COMMAND?

284
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,541
IF THAT'S THE CASE,
THEN YOU'RE NOTHING MORE

285
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,208
THAN HIS PUPPET.

286
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,708
BUT I DON'T GET THAT IMPRESSION
FROM YOU, GAJEEL.

287
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,791
YOU'RE NOT MINDLESS.

288
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,791
- WOULD YOU QUIT
FLAPPING YOUR GUMS

289
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,791
AND GET LOST ALREADY?

290
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,791
- Makarov:
THERE'S NO REASON TO GIVE UP

291
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,125
AND PLUNGE INTO THE DARKNESS.
- ( gasps )

292
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:07,625
- COME WITH US.
JOIN THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD.

293
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,125
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

294
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,083
WHY IN THE HECK WOULD I
EVER WANT TO DO THAT?

295
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,458
- THERE IS GREAT VALUE
IN THE TIME SPENT

296
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,958
IN ONES OWN COMPANY,

297
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,875
BUT A LIFETIME OF
TOTAL ISOLATION

298
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,791
IS A FATE NO ONE
SHOULD ENDURE.

299
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,583
- ( gasps )

300
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:27,208
YOU KNOW I'M THE ONE WHO
TRASHED YOUR GUILD HALL, RIGHT?

301
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:30,375
- OH, I KNOW.
WE'LL REBUILD IT.

302
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,250
- AND I WAS ALSO THE ONE

303
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,750
WHO HURT YOUR THREE
LITTLE FRIENDS.

304
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,833
- I KNOW.

305
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:43,000
A DESPICABLE ACT THAT I WILL
NEVER COMPLETELY FORGIVE.

306
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,250
BUT FOR ME,

307
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,500
LETTING A YOUNG MAN
FALL INTO DARKNESS 

308
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,166
WHEN I KNOW I COULD HAVE
DONE SOMETHING TO PREVENT IT

309
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,500
IS SOMETHING EVEN MORE
UNFORGIVEABLE.

310
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,041
- ( gasping )

311
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,833
- I CANNOT GUARANTEE
TOTAL SALVATION.

312
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,916
I CAN MERELY POINT YOU
DOWN A PATH OUT OF THE SHADOWS.

313
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,416
WILL YOU CHOOSE
TO WALK THAT PATH,

314
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,375
OR TO FOREGO IT
AND REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE?

315
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,375
- I WILL.

316
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,708
- WHAT?!

317
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,708
- ( grunting )

318
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,291
I WILL NOT BE DEFEATED.

319
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,041
NOT GONNA HAPPEN!

320
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,833
I'LL NEVER LOSE TO
SCUM LIKE YOU.

321
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,208
BECAUSE...

322
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,750
I'M A FAIRY TAIL WIZARD.

323
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,125
( grunts )

324
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:45,458
- NO.  NOT MY KITANA.

325
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:49,500
MY SOUL IS IN
THAT BLADE!

326
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,958
- DRAGON SLAYER SECRET ART.

327
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,958
- ( gasps )

328
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,416
- KARMIC DEMON...

329
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,125
- ( screams )

330
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,750
- IRON GOD SWORD!

331
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,791
- ( screams )

332
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,708
( grunts )

333
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,208
- ( chirping )

334
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:48,000
- ( grunts )

335
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,958
- GAJEEL!

336
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,041
- WHAT IS THIS?
- ( gasps ) THERE HE IS.

337
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,916
- ( panting )

338
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,416
GAJEEL.  OH, PLEASE TELL ME
THAT YOU'RE OKAY.

339
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,375
- ( grunts )

340
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:12,375
TOLD YOU I COULD HANDLE THOSE
CHUMPS BY MYSELF, DIDN'T I?

341
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:13,791
- ( sighs )

342
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,375
YEAH, YOU DID.

343
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,250
- ( chuckles )
- ( gasps )

344
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,500
- YOU FOOLS DON'T
STAND A CHANCE.

345
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,000
OUR MAIN FIGHTING FORCE
IS RIGHT ON OUR HEELS. 

346
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:29,833
WIZARDS WHOSE POWER
FAR EXCEEDS MY OWN.

347
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:33,291
THEY ARE KNOWN AS
THE SEVEN KIN OF PURGATORY.

348
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:36,333
( laughs )
- ( gasps )

349
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,916
- THE SEVEN KIN ARE COMING?

350
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,375
- ( gasps )

351
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,416
- WE MUST PUT THE TRIAL ON HOLD.

352
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,416
RIGHT NOW,
PREPARE FOR BATTLE!

353
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,416
CONDITION RED!

354
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,333
WE SHALL INTERCEPT THEM
AT ONCE.

355
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,916
- WHAT?  AN ENEMY ATTACK?

356
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,416
WHO DARES INVADE
OUR SACRED GROUND?

357
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,625
- A RED FLARE?
BUT WHY?

358
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,166
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
- ENEMIES SIGHTED.

359
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,041
- BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE S-CLASS TRIAL, HUH?

360
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,750
- OBVIOUSLY IT WILL HAVE TO
BE PUT ON HOLD FOR NOW.

361
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,875
- HMM.

362
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,958
I BET ITS GOT
SOMETHING TO DO WITH HIM.

363
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,916
THAT BIG CRYBABY.

364
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,625
- NAH, I DON'T THINK SO.

365
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,958
A RED FLARE MEANS
AN ENEMY IS COMING.

366
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,958
THERE MUST BE
SOMEBODY ELSE ON THE WAY.

367
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:29,375
- WELL, WHOEVER IT IS,
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A FIGHT.

368
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,625
SO I SAY WE GIVE THEM
WHAT THEY CAME HERE FOR.

369
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,375
THAT'LL TEACH THEM
NOT TO MESS WITH US.

370
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:34,791
- AYE, SIR!

371
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,958
- WHY DOES THIS
HAVE TO HAPPEN NOW?

372
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:40,291
- ( gasps ) - I SWORE THAT
THIS WOULD BE MY LAST TRIAL.

373
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,416
I'M SERIOUS.
IF I DON'T MAKE IT THIS YEAR,

374
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,916
I'M LEAVING
THE GUILD FOREVER.

375
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,583
I WON'T GIVE UP.

376
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,708
I'M GONNA SEE THIS THING
THROUGH TO THE VERY END.

377
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,833
- CANA...

378
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,916
- Gray: WOULD YOU TAKE IT DOWN
A NOTCH? - ( gasps )

379
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
- EVERYONE FEELS
THE SAME WAY YOU DO.

380
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,833
- WHERE DID YOU COME FROM?
- YEAH, NO KIDDING.

381
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,333
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

382
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,333
- WE'VE KIND OF BEEN FOL--

383
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,333
- IT'S JUST A COINCIDENCE, OKAY?

384
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,333
BUT THAT'S NOT
IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW.

385
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:09,416
IF WE'RE REALLY UNDER ATTACK,
THEN WE GOTTA FOCUS ON THAT. 

386
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,083
- ( grunts )

387
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,500
LET'S GET TO
THE EMERGENCY RENDEZVOUS.

388
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,833
WE NEED TO FIND OUT
WHAT'S HAPPENING FIRST.

389
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,166
- ( sighs )

390
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,666
AS IF THE TRIAL
WASN'T HARD ENOUGH.

391
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,250
- ( sighs )

392
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,041
- SO NOW WHAT?

393
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,791
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD DO?

394
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,375
- FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO
IS LOCATE MEST AND WENDY.

395
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,791
I'M AFRAID THEY
MAY BE LOST

396
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,458
AND UNABLE TO FIND
OUR BASE CAMP.

397
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:36,541
- I'LL TAKE GAJEEL
AND MEET YOU THERE IN A BIT.

398
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:37,958
- YES.
THANK YOU, LEVY.

399
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,708
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
PUSH YOURSELF

400
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,875
ON MY ACCOUNT,
SMALL FRY.

401
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,208
- Levy: WELL, I DON'T SEE YOU
GETTING THERE ON YOUR OWN,

402
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,125
YOU BIG LUG.
- Gajeel: YEAH YEAH.

403
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,125
DON'T RUB IT IN.

404
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,958
- Juvia: I'M SURE
MY BELOVED GRAY

405
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,375
NEEDS MY SUPPORT AS WELL.

406
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,208
- YOU THERE, SPEAK.

407
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,125
TELL ME WHY YOU'VE 
COME TO THIS PLACE.

408
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:00,125
- ( scoffs ) REVEALING THAT
WILL DO ME NO GOOD AT ALL.

409
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,291
- ( groans )

410
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,541
- ( grunts )

411
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,583
WE SEEK HIM.
THE LEGENDARY BLACK WIZARD

412
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,583
KNOWN AS ZEREF.
- ( gasping )

413
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,833
- HE IS HERE ON
THIS VERY ISLAND.

414
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:15,083
- BUT THAT'S ABSURD.
- HOW CAN THAT BE TRUE?

415
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,750
I THOUGHT ZEREF LIVED HUNDREDS
OF YEARS AGO, DIDN'T HE?

416
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,583
- 400 YEARS.

417
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,375
- YOU FOOL.
ZEREF IS LONG SINCE DEAD.

418
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,083
THAT'S WHO JELLAL WAS
TRYING TO REVIVE.

419
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,083
- NO, HE NEVER DIED.

420
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:36,125
LORD ZEREF HAS BEEN LIVING
FOR OVER 400 YEARS.

421
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,583
- ( gasps )

422
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,333
- ACCORDING TO MASTER HADES,

423
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,000
HE'S SIMPLY BEEN SLEEPING.

424
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,416
HE SAID LORD ZEREF
WAS IN A DEEP SLUMBER

425
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,166
THAT LASTED FOR CENTURIES.

426
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,125
- I FIND THIS WHOLE STORY
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE.

427
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,541
- ( chirps )
- ( buzzes )

428
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,625
- ONCE HE HAS AWAKENED
FROM HIS SLUMBER,

429
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:57,333
THE ENTIRE WORLD WILL BE
CLOAKED IN DARKNESS.

430
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:01,208
- NONSENSE! DON'T YOU KNOW THIS
ISLAND IS OUR SACRED GROUND?

431
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,208
THERE'S NO WAY WE'D
ALLOW IT TO BE DEFILED

432
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,333
BY THE FORCES OF EVIL
WITH WHOM YOU ALIGN. 

433
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:08,291
- ( chuckles )
BELIEVE WHAT YOU WILL,

434
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,625
BUT MASTER HADES AND
THE SEVEN KIN OF PURGATORY

435
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,791
WILL BE ARRIVING ON
THESE SHORES VERY SOON.

436
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,125
AND IT WOULD BE WISE OF YOU
NOT TO TAKE THEM LIGHTLY.

437
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,250
THE TIME WIZARD, ULTEAR.

438
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:22,083
RUSTYROSE.

439
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:25,125
MY SUPERIOR, CAPRICO.

440
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:28,166
KAIN HIKARU.

441
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,833
ZANCROW.

442
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,000
MELDY.

443
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,625
AND... THERE'S ONE MORE
MEMBER I HAVEN'T MENTIONED

444
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,083
WHO'S ALREADY HERE.
( chuckles )

445
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,333
- ( gasps )
- THERE'S ONE HERE NOW?

446
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,583
- HEY, WHAT IS THAT?

447
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:49,250
DO YOU WHAT THE RED SIGNAL
UP THERE IS SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

448
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,916
- UHH... IT MEANS...

449
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,708
NOW I WANT TO KNOW! I REALLY
WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

450
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,250
- IT'S OKAY IF YOU FORGOT,

451
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,875
BUT I DON'T THINK 
THAT'S GONNA HELP.

452
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:02,250
- I NEED TO ACT NOW
BEFORE THE MAIN FORCE ARRIVES.

453
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,000
- Wendy: ...WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW
WHERE THEY'VE BEEN.

454
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,708
- Carla: WENDY!
- ( gasps )

455
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,625
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

456
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,666
- NEVER MIND THAT.
JUST GET AWAY FROM HIM.

457
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,125
ALL RIGHT.
WHY DON'T YOU CUT THE ACT

458
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,541
AND TELL US WHO
YOU REALLY ARE?

459
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,458
- HUH? WHAT THE HECK
DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

460
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:20,375
I'M MYSTOGAN'S PUPIL,
REMEMBER?

461
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,791
- I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE
THAT MY PRINCE

462
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,458
WOULD TAKE ON A PUPIL
IN THIS WORLD.

463
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,875
NOW YOU ARE SMART ENOUGH
TO USE SOMEONE

464
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:31,458
WHO DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE
TO BACK UP YOUR STORY.

465
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:34,916
BUT ARE YOU GONNA BE SMART
ENOUGH TO TELL US THE TRUTH?

466
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,083
WHO ARE YOU?
AND WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO HIDE?

467
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,125
- ( theme music playing )

468
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,708
- ( singing in Japanese )

469
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,583
- Natsu: WHAT'S GOING ON?
THIS PLACE IS CRAWLING WITH

470
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,500
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

471
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,833
- Happy: THAT EMBLEM,
THEY'RE FROM GRIMOIRE HEART.

472
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,416
BUT WHAT'S A DARK GUILD
DOING ON TENROU ISLAND?

473
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,250
- Natsu: OOH, MAYBE THIS
IS PART OF THE S-CLASS

474
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:24,500
THINGY WE'RE DOING.

475
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:25,916
YOU KNOW, LIKE A STRENGTH
TESTING FESTIVAL.

476
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,833
- Happy: WHO THROWS
THAT KIND OF FESTIVAL?

477
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:30,250
ANYWAY, THIS IS A TRIAL,
YOU BONEHEAD, REMEMBER?

478
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:33,416
- Natsu and Happy:
NEXT TIME, "MAKAROV CHARGES."

479
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,666
- Natsu: HEY, MAN. A FESTIVAL
WHERE WE BEAT UP BAD GUYS

480
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,166
WHO ARE TRYING TO
MESS UP OUR TRIAL

481
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,500
SOUNDS LIKE FUN TO ME.

482
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:40,000
- Happy: I THINK WE HAVE
DIFFERENT IDEAS

483
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,541
ABOUT WHAT'S CONSIDERED
"FUN."
