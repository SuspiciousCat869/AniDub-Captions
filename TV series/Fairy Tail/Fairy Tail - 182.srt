No! Don't do it!

Are You tryin' to
get yourself killed?!

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,541
[ARCADIOS] I have no choice!

00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:33,791
Well, I'll be.

00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,333
I ain't never seen
someone that crazy.

Quit yapping!
We're safe, so get out!

12

reach for us! Hurry!

throw away his life

00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,458
so Lucy and Yukino can live?

22
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,416
It doesn't make
sense... My premonition...

23
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,166

is what we need...

help it, alright?

[LEADER] They are a part of you.

etched into the very fabric of
your soul and memories!

79

Hey! What the
heck are these?

80
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,375
Some sort of gropey magic?

81
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,250
[LEADER] They are
proof of your offenses!

wash clean of them!

Does your heart not ache
from such destruction?

[NATSU] Huh? So
what you're saying.

85
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,125
is that all those times I
crumpled cities on jobs

86

and got the Council's
undies in a wad.

87

Those were the
wrong things to do?

[LEADER] Of course they were!

89
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,125

Too slow, jerk!

95
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,166
[LEADER] I told you before.

96
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,083
You can run from sin,
but you can never escape it.

97
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,791
It will relentlessly pursue
the marks on your flesh.

98
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,583
until justice has been served.

99

sins and despair.

sitchi-ation's gone

104
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,541
It was an exceptionally
close call, though.

some vengeance.

catch a girl like that?!

Rough winds and a
burning pit just for me?

This punishment is
really a dream come true.

132
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,875
Thank you.

133
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,125
[LUCY] Yeah, I'm not
gonna touch that one.

134
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,833
And It's good to see
you again, Big Brother.

135
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,125
Why are you still
making her call you that?

136
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,458
I had no idea
they were related!

137
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,833
Trust me, they're not...

138
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,541
But it's way too
weird to explain.

You stay up there!

It's much

by their appearance alone.

152
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,125
But I totally win
in that category.

153
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,583
I had enough of you
and your fish hole!

154
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,000
You're making me mad!

155
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,916
Then do something about it.

I'm freezing!

I'm so not
dressed for cold.

160
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,416
I got a feelin' you

[ALL gasp]

163
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:08,916
[LUCY] Oh no!

164
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,083
[LIBRA] Gravity Change!
Counter-balance!

165
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:11,666
[LUCY squeals]

166
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,041
[LOKE] Lucy!

167
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,208
[UOSUKE] Cod nugget!

168
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,416
[LUCY] Get me down
before I lose my cool!

169
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,333
[WENDY whimpers]

170
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,541
So sour...

171
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,958
[COSMOS giggles]

172
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,958
[COSMOS] That anguished
expression is simply precious.

173
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,958
I'll be kind and give you
a lovely demise, my sweet.

174
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,833
[COSMOS] Buried beneath
your most hated food,

175
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:36,416
you'll drift off to sleep
amid pain and suffering.

176
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,625
Let death's
warm embrace

177
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,333
gently lull you
into eternal slumber.

178
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,291
What?! No, please!

179
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:48,708
[COSMOS] Now, close your eyes.
Makura, kamura...

180
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,208
This is a
spell of death.

181
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,583
Once these spores
have put you to sleep.

182
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:56,000
The waking world is
forever lost to you.

183
00:08:56,083 --> 00:09:00,125
Sweet dreams, darling.
Savor your final nightmare.

184
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,916
[COSMOS laughs]

185
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,666
[CROWD cheering]

186
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,875
[JET] Man...

187
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,125
The first master sure
knows her strategy.

188
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,125
[DROY] Yeah!

189
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,625
Taking first place
was easy as pie!

190
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,833
How'd we go from a girl
like her to an angry old man?

191
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,333
You talkin'
about yourself?

192
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:18,500
I think you guys have
some issues to work out.

193
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,875
I sense something.

194
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,500
[MAKAROV] What is it,
First Master?

195
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:22,458
Trouble?

196
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:23,916
I'm not quite sure,

197
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,708
but it's coming from deep
beneath the city of Crocus.

198
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,458
It's faint,
but I sense tremors.

199
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,000
and the clashing of magic power.

200
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:34,166
Do you think...
it's the rescue team?

201
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,625
[MAVIS] Most likely.

202
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,791
And they seem to be
fighting separately.

203
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:41,666
[LUCY] So cold!

204
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,541
[UOSUKE] Ha-ha!
What's the matter?

205
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,916
Those arms and legs
goin' numb on ya?

206
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,958
[LOKE] Don't worry!
I know just what to do!

207
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,541
A little
flesh-on-flesh contact

208
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,125
will keep your limbs toasty.

209
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,208
[LUCY] Go away!

210
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,833
Please, leave everything
to me, Princess.

211
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,375
An amusing dance
will raise your spirits

212
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,666
and chase away the shivers!

213
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,625
How's that gonna
solve anything?!

214
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,041
They're such lively
celestial spirits.

215
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,416
It's obvious how much
they care for you, Lucy.

216
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,708
You know they're
crazy, right?

217
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,125
All this dancing
has exhausted me,

218
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,500
so I'll be going now.

219
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,833
[LUCY] Oh. Thanks, I guess?

220
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,708
[YUKINO] My body is
almost completely numb...

221
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,541
and I'm getting sleepy.

222
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,208
We need to lift this spell
before we're popsicles.

223
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,291
I might regret this, but...

224
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,916
Open... Gate
of the Golden Bull!

225
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,375
[LUCY] Taurus!

226
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,416
[TAURUS] Moo...

227
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,250
[LUCY] Huh? What's
with the gloom, Taurus?

228
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,875
Did your milk go sour?

229
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,666
[TAURUS] I was primed and ready
to get a peek at that nice-bod

230
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,416
all hot and flushed
from the lava,

231
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,916
but now all I get
is a meat locker.

232
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,458
[LUCY] Ah. Geez!

233
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,458
But watching you hug
those udders to survive

234
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,666
is moooving in its own right!

235
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,541
[LUCY] Shut up!

236
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
Why don't you and your
new friend cuddle for warmth

237
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,833
while I send this
tool out to pasture?

238
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:59,000
[UOSUKE] You got some
interestin' spirits.

239
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,416
Is it because
you're so borin'?

240
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,833
[LUCY] That does it!

241
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,375
Alright, big guy, give
this loud mouth the horns!

242
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,875
Yes, ma'am!

00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,208
When I'm done with him, I've
got a whole stampede's worth

244
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,208
of smooooches for you!

245
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,666
Watch your step!

[TAURUS grunts]

247

Runnin' on ice is just
askin' for an accident.

[TAURUS] My tenderloin...

249
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,166

totally pathetic!

[UOSUKE] The jig's up!

251
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,250
Now, be good little minnows
and accept your punish--Wait.

00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,291
Weren't there more of ya before?

253
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,583
[LOKE] Heads up!

[LUCY] Yukino!

256
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,583
[YUKINO] Right! Now, Libra!
Use the ice chunks!

257
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:36,750

[UOSUKE] I feel like a mackerel.

261
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:43,750
[CARLA] Way to go!

262
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,583
Nice combination!

263
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,333
[YUKINO] It's back to normal!

264
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,208
I wonder if he thinks
I'm "boring" after that!

265
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:54,166
Another baddy put down by
the sweet power of our love.

thing down a notch, okay...?

Tail's in the lead?!

276
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,500
[MALE SOLDIER B] Yeah,
but Sabertooth still has the

Twin Dragons out there,

278
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,000
so there's no telling
what'll happen.

Don't forget about

that babe, Kagura!

It doesn't make
sense, though.

282
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,541
Why in the heck would Fairy Tail
try to force a prison break

283
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,625
when all they had to do
was win the tournament?

284
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:38,666
Who cares? Low-lifes
will do as low-lifes please.

[MALE SOLDIER C] What
about the Colonel?

286

[MALE SOLDIER D] No matter how
you look at it, he's a traitor.

287
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,708
Plain and simple.

288
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,458
[IRIKI] Princess. I've just
been handed an update...

289
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:50,333
The Hungry Wolf Knights have
begun Operation Fifteen Hundred

290
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,375
in the Palace of Perdition.

291
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,041
The lawbreakers
are resisting,

292
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,250
and combat is
ongoing at present.

293
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,291
I'm told they've moved
to five separate locations

on the lower level.

[MALE SOLDIER B] What
about their telepathy?

296
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,958
[MALE SOLDIER C] Already
taken care of.

297
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,666
All telepathy from
outside has been blocked.

298
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,333
I know His Majesty
is a fan of Fairy Tail,

299
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,083
but that doesn't mean
they're above the law.

00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,791
Unlike your hair.
You could use a trim, baby.

320
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:02,791
What's this?

321
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,416
A wild new do, baby.

322
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:07,583
So long!

323
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,791
And hunky
to boot, baby.

324
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,208
No.

325
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:15,250
But I think it
looks cute, baby.

326
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,750
[UOSUKE] Execution!

327
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:17,500
[CANCER] And I'm out!

328
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:18,875
Cancer!

329
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,541
Ya'll must think I was
born on the boat yesterday.

330
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:25,625
I know you're tryin' to buy
time for your injured friend.

331
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,166
It was worth
a shot, at least.

332
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,916
Aw man, he saw
right through that!

333
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,791
Who knew he'd
be so smart?

334
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:31,916
You're dealin'
with the

335
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,583
sharpest dang hook
in the tackle box!

336
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,291
Execution! Torment Zone!

337
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,291
[CARLA &amp; HAPPY scream]

338
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,208
What are these?!

339
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,708
Torture devices!

340
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,041
Help me, I'm stuck!

341
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,041
I'm a little
tied up here!

342
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,458
[LOKE] Hang in there!

343
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,625
[UOSUKE] Don't you
move a muscle!

344
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,083
You're more trouble
than a hole in a net...

345
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,750
Simmer down or
I'll give Beardy there

346
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,833
the closest shave of his life.

347
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:53,958
[LOKE] What do we do?

348
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,291
[LUCY] Whatever he says.

349
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,916
Aw. What's the matter?

350
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,750
You ain't got no more
magic critters to call up?

351
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,666
I guess he's got
us on the ropes.

352
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,208
Indeed, it's
quite annoying.

353
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,708
So, let's change that.

354
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,375
Open. Gate of the Scorpion!

355
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,833
Open. Gate of the Two Fish!

356
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:11,750
[LUCY] Scorpio!

357
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,291
[SCORPIO] Wicked!

358
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,791
Come, Pisces!

359
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,708
It's fishies!

360
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,375
Fresh eel!

361
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,833
I could eat for a
month on this puppy!

362
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,250
What an incredible haul!

363
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,458
Now, Scorpio!

364
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,125
[SCORPIO] Sand Buster!

365
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:34,833
Careful!

366
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,416
Easy!

367
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,250
Way to go! Nice work!

368
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:42,958
[SCORPIO] Wicked. I'll... just
be over here if you need me.

369
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:43,833
Yeah...

370
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,000
Huh?

371
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,750
Lucy! We're
A-OK over here!

372
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:48,458
[LUCY] Huh?

373
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,333
Oh, right! Thanks a lot!

374
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,708
[UOSUKE] I'm still here!

375
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,041
I done sailed currents
that'd give you nightmares!

376
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,375
Ya'll ain't never
gonna shake me off!

377
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:57,125
Ready?

378
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,250
Let's do it! 

379
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,250
--Scorpio! 
--Pisces!

380
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,166
[UOSUKE shouts]

381
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,708
[UOSUKE] Yee-haw!

382
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,375
[SCORPIO] Wicked!

383
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,208
[UOSUKE] I think I'm gonna hurl!

384
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,333
You must
strike quickly!

385
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,458
I'll hold him.

386
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,041
Loke!

387
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,833
Give him everything you've got,
but try not to hit Pisces, okay!

388
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,791
That's a tall
order. But for you?

389
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,416
I think I can whip up
a real crowd pleaser.

390
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,666
Here goes!

391
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,208
Regulus Impact!

392
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,291
Oh yeah! Right on target!

393
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,291
With a beautiful
attack, to boot!

394
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,541
That isn't
from my attack.

395
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:28,875
It's his doing!

396
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,583
[UOSUKE] Terrain Effect Plus:
Midnight Sun Zone!

397
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,791
I fought light with light!

398
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,041
I betcha didn't see that comin'!

399
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,458
[LUCY] Wait, you can do that?!

400
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:41,000
If that's the case, then
I'll use my own trump card.

401
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:46,541
[COSMOS] Having sour
dreams yet, sweetie?

402
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:47,625
You know,

403
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,166
out of all my
execution techniques,

404
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,333
this is my favorite by far.

405
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,500
And you're my
favorite... victim.

406
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,291
It's been a while
since I've executed

407
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,583
a lovely lawbreaker like you.

408
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,458
[WARREN grunts]

409
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:03,958
[MAKAROV] Any luck?

410
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,291
Judging by your face, I'd
guess the answer would be no.

411
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,375
That right?

412
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,000
[WARREN] Sorry about
this, Master...

413
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,791
But I don't understand
what's wrong.

414
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,833
Natsu's team was
going to Mercurius,

415
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,416
which isn't far from here.

416
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,166
So communicating with them by
telepathy should be a breeze.

417
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,416
This clashing magic
power that you sensed,

418
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,583
is it possible it's
beneath the castle?

419
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,500
It is.

420
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,500
So, why can't we
reach the team?

421
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:28,083
Maybe it's because
of that Eclipse thing!

422
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,291
It absorbs nearby
magic power, doesn't it?

423
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,458
[ALZACK] No.

424
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:32,916
If that was it, she
wouldn't sense them

425
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,208
fighting down there...

426
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,875
There must be another cause.

427
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,208
Who're they gonna fight
with that far underground?

428
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,875
The Sacred Blossom Cherry
Knights or whatever?

429
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,625
Don't forget, there's
also that Magic Unit...

430
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,166
Council dogs.

431
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,250
I can't imagine Natsu's team
having a hard time with them.

432
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,791
And if it was the Council, there
would've been a huge uproar

433
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,458
the moment they were spotted.

434
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,916
[ALZACK] Assuming they did
rescue Lucy and Yukino,

435
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,083
there's only one
possibility I can think of.

436
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,375
Though It's never
been made public.

437
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:05,208
There have been rumors
of an independent squad.

438
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,541
Hold on, you're
talking about

439
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,500
the executioners, aren't you?

440
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,916
You actually believe that?

441
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,208
No.

442
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,291
But many legends are
somewhat steeped in fact.

443
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,958
I don't know, after
finding out about

444
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,708
that Eclipse Project and all...

445
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,958
Anything could
be plausible, right?

446
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,208
For real?

447
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,375
So all this weird
telepathic interference...

448
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,958
could be coming from a
group of psycho knights?

449
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,583
It's a vexing situation.

450
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,250
but we can't afford to make any
rash decisions at the moment.

451
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,416
No, we can't.

452
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,333
All we can do is
wait and have faith.

453
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,666
[NATSU] How do ya like that?
Didn't even hit me once!

454
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,458
[LEADER] Such
mental fortitude...

455
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,458
You refuse to atone.
You refuse punishment.

456
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,291
Never before has there
been such a lawbreaker.

457
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,875
Ain't I a stinker?

458
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:52,000
So. Why don't you just
let me pass? Okay?

459
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,875
[LEADER] Like your comrades,
you will learn there is

460
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,250
no deliverance.

461
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,916
Surrender and join them
in the afterlife.

462
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,041
Yeah, right. Get real.

463
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,916
Nobody in Fairy Tail would ever
kick the bucket that easily...

464
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,416
So I know you're lyin.'

465
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,875
[LEADER] A lowly guild wizard
would dare defy the will

466
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,625
of the kingdom?!

467
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,708
After everything
you've done to my friends?

468
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,250
Yeah. I "dare to defy"!

469
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,875
And I'll do
it with gusto!

470
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:17,541
[LUCY &amp; YUKINO scream]

471
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:18,750
[YUKINO] Pisces!

472
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,625
[UOSUKE] The fish!

473
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:21,750
They vanished!

474
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,583
What the heck?!

475
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,500
What happened to them?

476
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,833
This is the
true form of Pisces...

477
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,250
A mother and her son.

478
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,208
There can be only one reason
that we'd be summoned like this.

479
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,791
Wiping out the enemy.
with style.

480
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,958
For a gal that's had a kid,
she's never lost that body.

481
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,833
I'm counting on you.

482
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,166
Right mama! We're on it!

483
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,750
[YUKINO] I'm not your mother,
you know that!

484
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,666
Amazing!

485
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,583
I kinda liked 'em better when
they were fish though...

486
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,500
Get serious.

487
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,458
Let's make quick work of him.

488
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:57,125
Okay?

489
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,916
Yes, ma'am. gladly.

490
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,250
[UOSUKE] Terrain Effect.
Hot Lava Zone!

491
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,875
[PISCES BOY] Be careful, mom!

492
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,166
Spicy eel stew,
comin' up!

493
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,791
No! Don't eat 'em!

494
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,416
[YUKINO] Are you sure
that you've got him?!

495
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,666
[LUCY] Careful!

496
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,833
[LOKE] Don't worry!

497
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,125
He's fine, just a little
on the heavy side.

498
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,708
Although...

499
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,291
I wouldn't mind holding the two
of you this close to my chest.

500
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,750
[LUCY] Just get going.

501
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,958
Why don't we cool
things off a little bit?

502
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,083
Beating the heat
sounds like a plan to me!

503
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,458
[UOSUKE] Ya'll done
put out my fire!

504
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,583
But how in the heck did
a little water do all that?

505
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:41,166
[PISCES MOM] Our magic power
is much stronger than yours.

506
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,458
[PISCES BOY]
Totally! By a long shot!

507
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,750
Am I still alive?

508
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,083
Question. Couldn't you
have just flown away?

509
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,500
Oh yeah...

510
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:49,833
Man...

511
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,583
This is really taking a
lot of power out of me...

512
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,875
[YUKINO] Let's give it one
final push; that should do it!

513
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,250
Yeah!

514
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,541
It's time to filet
this fishy freak!

515
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,750
Taurus!

516
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,208
[TAURUS] One moore time!

517
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,833
[UOSUKE yelling]

518
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,083
[TAURUS] Boom!

519
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,958
Did you see how udderly
cool I was, Miss Lucy?

520
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,083
[HAPPY] You go, cow!

521
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,833
May I ask what
you're doing?

522
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,916
[HAPPY] My butt feels amazing.

523
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,250
Seriously Carla, the
ground is so toasty and warm;

524
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,666
you should give it a try!

525
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,291
Uh-huh...

526
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,541
[UOSUKE] I've had it up to
here with those critters!

527
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,208
Terrain Effect Magic:
Whirlpool Zone!

528
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,541
Oh... yeah.

529
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,083
Do you hear something?

530
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,458
[BOTH screaming]

531
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,833
[UOSUKE] I'll flush ya'll
out like my chili gumbo!

532
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,333
The current
is too strong!

533
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,083
Stay tough
and fight it!

534
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,708
[BOTH scream]

535
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,500
[TAURUS] I was made
for dry land.

536
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:40,333
Water rides make me
feel like yakkin'!

537
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,375
[HAPPY] They're fish again!

538
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,208
How could he possibly
know that Pisces

539
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,708
has a weakness to water?

540
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,583
That doesn't
make any sense!

541
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,666
[LOKE] Lucy! Are you
okay down there?!

542
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,083
[LUCY] I think so!

543
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:54,375
I dunno what you're up to.
I didn't take any damage,

544
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,583
and the water's too
shallow to drown in.

545
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,208
Are you just
trying to soak us?

546
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,083
[UOSUKE] Take a gander
at them whirlpools!

547
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,791
If ya let 'em suck
you in, you'll be sent

548
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,208
to another place entirely!

549
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,375
What kind of "place"
are we talking about?

550
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,958
Uhhh...

551
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,000
[LUCY] You mean you don't even
know what your attack does?!

552
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,791
[UOSUKE laughs]

553
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,208
[UOSUKE] This is it, Crim'nals!

554
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:16,750
You'll be sleepin'
with the fishies

555
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,208
'till the cows come home!

556
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:20,833
[LUCY] What the--?

557
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,750
Oh yeah! Water!

558
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:23,916
That's all I need!

559
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,166
Oh no!

560
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,000
Lucy's about to summon
the fish-lady spirit!

561
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,333
I thought
you liked fish!

562
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:29,125
[LUCY] Open...

563
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:31,083
Gate of the Water Bearer!

564
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:36,791
Huh?

565
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:38,875
[LUCY] Aquarius!

566
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,333
[AQUARIUS growls]

567
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,083
[HAPPY] We're unstoppable
now that Lucy and Yukino

568
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:17,083
have their zodiac keys back!

569
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:18,166
[NATSU] All right!

570
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,625
Now, we just gotta
thrash these guys!

571
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,208
[HAPPY] Aye!

572
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:23,083
But don't forget, we need one
of 'em to tell us the way out!

573
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:25,416
[NATSU] Oh yeah, we can't
afford to be stuck here forever!

574
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,458
[HAPPY] That's it, Natsu!
Get to roastin'!

575
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:29,375
[NATSU] Boy, did these
suckers pick the wrong guild

576
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:30,750
to mess with!

577
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:33,208
[HAPPY &amp; NATSU] Next time:
Our Place!

578
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,125
[NATSU] We'll take on
the kingdom, the world,

579
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:37,291
or anyone else to
help our friends!

580
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,708
That's the Fairy Tail way!

581
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:40,833
[HAPPY] You can do it, Natsu!
