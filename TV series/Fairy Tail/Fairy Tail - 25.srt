1
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,041
- HEY GUYS!
READY FOR SOME MORE FAIRY TAIL?

2
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:21,666
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING

3
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,416
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS
ON IN THE ROOM

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,625
AND DON'T SIT TOO
CLOSE TO THE TV!

5
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,416
- PREVIOUSLY, ON FAIRY TAIL!

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,125
- PHANTOM IS TRYING TO
USE THEIR MAGIC GIANT

7
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:32,458
TO CAST THE ABYSS BREAK SPELL

8
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:35,000
WHICH WOULD DESTROY
ALL OF MAGNOLIA!

9
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,791
WE SPLIT UP TO FIND
THE GIANT'S POWER SOURCE

10
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:39,250
BUT WE WERE CORNERED
BY THE ELEMENT FOUR!

11
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,375
MEANWHILE, MIRA'S
BEEN TAKEN HOSTAGE

12
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,833
AND THAT SENDS
ELFMAN OVER THE EDGE!

13
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,708
- WHY ARE YOU CRYING?

14
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:56,750
- ( theme song playing )

15
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,708
- Lucy: WHEN DID I
GET BACK HOME?

16
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:27,333
I THOUGHT WE WERE IN THE
MIDDLE OF SOME KINDA FIGHT.

17
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,958
I WONDER IF IT WAS
ALL JUST...

18
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,333
A DREAM.

19
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,458
- Natsu: YEP, IT WAS
NOTHIN' BUT A DREAM.

20
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,750
- OH MISS LUCY, I'M SO MOVED--

21
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,916
- MAKE ME SOMETHIN' TO EAT.
- Cana: ALL MEN ARE SCUM.

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,666
- Happy: UPPA!

23
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,458
- Lucy: GET OUT!

24
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,375
- IS SOMETHING MOVIN'
UNDER THE SHEETS?

25
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,083
- DRIP DRIP DROP.

26
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,791
- YOU'RE CREEPIN' ME OUT!

27
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,041
- DRIP DRIP DROP.

28
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,583
- NO. LEAVE ME ALONE.

29
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,625
- Reedus: LUCY.

30
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,708
IT'S JUST A DREAM.
WAKE UP.

31
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:02,000
- HEY PERVERT!
OUTTA MY ROOM!

32
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:06,000
HOLD ON A SEC. WHAT THE...?
THIS ISN'T MY ROOM AT ALL!

33
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,000
- A FLOWER BLOOMS IN THE RAIN.

34
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,000
- ZUT ALORS! HE DID IT!

35
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,583
- A FULL-BODY TAKE OVER.

36
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,708
BEAST SOUL!

37
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:27,375
( Elfman Beast roars )

38
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:31,541
- NON, NON, NON!
THIS IS A BIG MISUNDERSTANDING!

39
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,500
I WASN'T TRYING TO HURT YOU,
I SIMPLY WANTED TO HELP UN AMI!

40
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,333
I THOUGHT THAT PUTTING
YOU THROUGH THAT TRIAL

41
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,666
MIGHT HELP YOU GET OVER
YOUR PAINFUL MEMORIES!

42
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,666
EXCUSE MON FAUX PAS!

43
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,666
YOU ARE TRULY THE CREME
DE LA CREME OF MANLY MEN!

44
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,458
VOUS ETES INCROYABLE!

45
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:46,750
Sol: N'EST-CE PAS?

46
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,541
WELL, I SHOULD BE GOING NOW.

47
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,125
A TOUT A L'HEURE!

48
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,875
( Elfman Beast punches Sol )

49
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:57,291
CURSE YOU!
PLATRE SONATA!

50
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,083
NON, NON, NON,

51
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,375
YOU NEVER SHOULD'VE LET
YOUR GUARD DOWN LIKE THAT!

52
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,625
( loud noise )
- ( he gasps )

53
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,000
UH, SALUT?

54
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,541
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

55
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,458
- Sol: JE SUIS MORT.

56
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,750
- ( he bawls )

57
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:26,583
- NON! AT LEAST KNOCK
ME OUT, S'IL VOUS PLAIT!

58
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,875
- ELFMAN!

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,583
- Sol: AU REVOIR.

60
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:43,916
- ELFMAN. I WANNA TALK TO YOU.

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,500
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

62
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,791
- ( growls )

63
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:55,750
- I'M WORRIED. PLEASE DON'T
TELL ME YOU'VE LOST CONTROL.

64
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,166
NOT AGAIN.

65
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,875
- ( beast stomps )

66
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,791
- Elfman Beast: I'M SORRY, MIRA.

67
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:08,375
I PROMISED I WOULDN'T TRY A
FULL-BODY TAKE OVER EVER AGAIN.

68
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,000
AND AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
TO LISANNA,

69
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,916
I THOUGHT I NEVER WOULD.

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,500
- Mira: YOU'RE STILL IN CONTROL.

71
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,958
- Elfman Beast: BUT I DIDN'T
HAVE ANY OTHER CHOICE.

72
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:22,291
I KNEW THAT THIS WAS THE
ONLY WAY I COULD PROTECT YOU

73
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,375
AND THE REST OF FAIRY TAIL.

74
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,375
- Mira: PLEASE, STOP BEATING
YOURSELF UP ABOUT LISANNA.

75
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,375
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

76
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,333
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG,

77
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,833
YOU WERE JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT US.

78
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,291
- AND I FAILED MISERABLY.

79
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,583
I KILLED MY LITTLE SISTER.

80
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,416
- BUT YOUR BIG SISTER'S
STILL ALIVE.

81
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,750
- MIRAJANE.

82
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,708
- Mira: WE SAID WE'D LIVE OUR
LIVES FOR HER, REMEMBER?

83
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,708
AND WE PROMISED TO KEEP
HER MEMORY ALIVE

84
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,375
SO SHE'D LIVE ON IN OUR
HEARTS FOREVER.

85
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:13,916
- BIG SIS!
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE OKAY!

86
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:18,375
- C'MON. WHAT'S WITH ALL
THE TEARS ALL OF A SUDDEN?

87
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,291
- I CAN'T HELP IT!

88
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,541
- YOU SAVED ME.
THANKS ELFMAN.

89
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:25,583
- ( she gasps )

90
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,500
- WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

91
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,250
- IT'S NOT DRAWING THE MAGIC
CIRCLE AS FAST AS BEFORE.

92
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,500
ABYSS BREAK IS THE
FORBIDDEN SPELL

93
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,250
OF THE FOUR ELEMENTS.

94
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:45,125
AND THOSE ARE AIR, FIRE,
WATER, AND EARTH.

95
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,125
THE ELEMENT 4.

96
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,375
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MANY OF THEM ARE LEFT?

97
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,375
- UH, WELL.

98
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,583
- ONE! TWO!

99
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,750
- I GUESS THAT LEAVES TWO MORE.

100
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,250
- THAT MUST BE IT!

101
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,458
EACH TIME ONE OF THEM IS
BEATEN THE GIANT SLOWS DOWN!

102
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,291
- Elfman: YEAH? BUT WHY?

103
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,750
- Mira: BECAUSE IT'S BEING
POWERED BY THE ELEMENT 4!

104
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,583
IF WE CAN DEFEAT THE OTHER
2 THEN WE CAN STOP

105
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,125
THE GIANT FROM CASTING
THE ABYSS BREAK SPELL!

106
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,083
- Elfman: REALLY? YA THINK SO?

107
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,458
- Mira: WE HAVE TO HURRY!

108
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:16,125
THE OTHER 2 ARE PROBABLY
SOMEWHERE INSIDE THE GIANT!

109
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,916
- Elfman: RIGHT! LET'S GO!

110
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:26,041
- THANK GOODNESS. I'M GLAD
THEY MADE IT OUT OKAY.

111
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,041
- Macao: CANA!

112
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:32,708
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
JUST FOCUS ON THE ENEMY!

113
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,666
WE HAVE TO PROTECT FAIRY TAIL!

114
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,708
- YOU DON'T KNOW
THE WORD QUIT, DO YA?

115
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,333
- LISTEN UP! IF WE'RE
GONNA BEAT THESE CREEPS,

116
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,916
WE GOTTA COVER MORE GROUND!

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,041
- RIGHT!

118
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,708
- I DUNNO WHAT IT
IS ABOUT OUR GUILD,

119
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,791
BUT OUR LADIES ARE
RIDICULOUSLY STRONG.

120
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,625
- HEY. WHERE'D LOKE RUN OFF TO?

121
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,458
- HE SAID HE WAS GONNA
GO CHECK THE HIDEOUT

122
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,708
BECAUSE HE HAD A BAD
FEELING ABOUT IT.

123
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,000
- WHA...? YOU MEAN
HE DITCHED US?

124
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,458
- Alzack: HE'S MAKIN' SURE
THEY'RE OKAY

125
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,375
'CAUSE IF THE ABYSS
BREAK IS CAST

126
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,833
THEY'LL BE IN TROUBLE TOO!

127
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,250
- Laki: THAT'S TRUE.

128
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,625
- Alzack: BESIDES, LOKE'S
HUNCHES ARE USUALLY RIGHT.

129
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,708
- HEY, I JUST THOUGHT OF
SOMETHIN' AWESOME, HAPPY!

130
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,041
- WHAT IS IT?

131
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,125
- WHEN WE BEAT JOSE I BET
IT'LL FINALLY PUT AN END

132
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:17,125
TO ALL THIS CRAZY FIGHTING!

133
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,916
- ARE YOU COMPLETELY
OUTTA YOUR MIND?

134
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,166
THAT GUY'S
JUST AS STRONG,

135
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,541
IF NOT STRONGER, THAN
MASTER MAKAROV!

136
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,416
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU CAN BEAT HIM!

137
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
- WELL, GRAMPS IS
OUTTA COMMISSION.

138
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,375
SO IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE
UP TO SOMEBODY ELSE

139
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,208
TO BEAT THAT JERK!

140
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,250
- NATSU, YOU DUMMY!

141
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,208
I WAS TRYIN' REALLY HARD NOT
TO THINK ABOUT THAT

142
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,208
BUT THEN YOU HAD TO GO
AND REMIND ME!

143
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,208
- DO WHAT?

144
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,375
- NOW I'M BUMMED.

145
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,000
WITHOUT MASTER MAKAROV
AND ERZA WITH US,

146
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,375
THERE'S NO HOPE.

147
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,291
WE MAY STOP THE GIANT
BUT WE'LL HAVE TO FACE JOSE.

148
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,333
- DON'T WORRY,
I CAN HANDLE HIM.

149
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,125
C'MON!

150
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,250
- AYE!

151
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,750
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
IT IS ABOUT HIM.

152
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,791
THE MASTER AND ERZA ARE
DEFINITELY STRONGER WIZARDS,

153
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,375
BUT NATSU'S GOT
SOMETHIN' SPECIAL

154
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,291
THAT GIVES EVERYBODY HOPE!

155
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,208
( blast )

156
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,666
- Aria: HOW SAD.

157
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,875
I WILL MAKE YOUR WINGS OF
FIRE WITHER AND FALL,

158
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,375
AND ALL THAT WILL REMAIN
IS A DRAGON'S CORPSE.

159
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,625
- SAY WHAT?

160
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,333
- WATCH OUT. THIS GUY'S
ONE OF THE ELEMENT 4!

161
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,583
- MY NAME IS ARIA.

162
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:34,083
I AM THE STRONGEST
OF THE ELEMENT 4.

163
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,708
I'VE COME IN HOPES
OF HUNTING A DRAGON.

164
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,833
- LEMME GUESS, YOU'RE A
WIND WIZARD, RIGHT?

165
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,625
I'VE DEALT WITH
YOUR KIND BEFORE.

166
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,666
- YEAH BUT THIS GUY'S A
LOT STRONGER THAN ERIGOR!

167
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,708
- THAT'S WEIRD.
WHEN DID IT START RAINING?

168
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,250
- DRIP DRIP DROP.

169
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,000
HELLO. MY NAME IS JUVIA

170
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:10,000
AND I AM THE RAIN WOMAN
OF THE ELEMENT 4.

171
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,125
DRIP DRIP DROP.

172
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:15,708
- SO YOU'RE ONE OF 'EM TOO?
THEN BRING IT ON.

173
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:18,458
- I MUST SAY, I'M IMPRESSED
YOUR GUILD WAS ABLE

174
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,875
TO STRIKE DOWN TWO
OF THE ELEMENTS.

175
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,875
HOWEVER, YOU MUST NOT
UNDERESTIMATE THE REMAINING TWO.

176
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,416
- LISTEN LADY.

177
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,625
IF YOU'RE LOOKIN' FOR
A FIGHT I'LL GIVE YOU ONE.

178
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,000
BUT LET'S GET
SOMETHIN' STRAIGHT,

179
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:33,125
I'M NOT GONNA HOLD BACK
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE A CHICK.

180
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,333
- WELL, THEN, I GIVE UP.
YOU WIN. GOODBYE!

181
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:51,416
- WHERE YOU GOIN'?
COME BACK AND FIGHT ME!

182
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,000
- THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
WRONG WITH ME.

183
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,750
WHY IS MY HEART BEATING SO FAST?

184
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,375
- WOULD YOU AT LEAST TELL
ME HOW TO STOP THE GIANT?

185
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,666
- I HAVE THIS STRONG
URGE TO MAKE HIM MINE.

186
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,125
I JUST CAN'T HELP MYSELF
ANYMORE! WATER LOCK!

187
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,250
- ( he grimaces )

188
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,041
- OH NO! WHAT HAVE
I DONE? HE'S INJURED!

189
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:14,041
I HAD NO IDEA HE WAS HURT!
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!

190
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,083
I GUESS I SHOULD
PROBABLY RELEASE HIM.

191
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:20,041
- ( water bubble explodes )

192
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,708
- HE MUST BE AN ICE WIZARD.

193
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,583
HE FROZE MY WATER LOCK
AND BROKE FREE!

194
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,625
I'VE NEVER WITNESSED
THE POWER OF ICE MAGIC.

195
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,916
IT'S BEAUTIFUL!

196
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,583
I'M WATER AND HE'S ICE.
WE MUST BE BOUND BY FATE.

197
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:39,000
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'VE FINALLY
FOUND MY HANDSOME PRINCE.

198
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,791
- YOU ALMOST GOT ME WITH
THAT SNEAK ATTACK YOU PULLED.

199
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:45,500
YOU'RE PLAYIN' DIRTY.

200
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,375
- OW!

201
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,125
- HE'S TAKING OFF HIS CLOTHES!

202
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,041
- BUT I'M NOT READY FOR
THIS! WE JUST MET!

203
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,958
CAN'T WE TAKE THINGS SLOWLY?

204
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,958
- I REALLY DON'T WANNA FIGHT A
GIRL BUT I WILL IF I HAVE TO.

205
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,000
SO YOU'D BETTER SURRENDER,

206
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,125
OTHERWISE I'M GONNA
HAVE TO HURT YA.

207
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,666
ICE MAKE: LANCE!

208
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,125
- MY BODY IS MADE
ENTIRELY OF WATER.

209
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,208
SURPRISED? DRIP DRIP DROP.

210
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:16,916
YES. I MUSTN'T FORGET.
MY LOVE IS ALSO MY ENEMY.

211
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,625
WE'RE ON OPPOSITE
SIDES OF THIS WAR.

212
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,958
I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO ATTACK!

213
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,125
IT SEEMS THIS IS
FAREWELL, MY PRINCE.

214
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,708
WATER SLICER!

215
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,666
WHEN GIVEN THE PROPER
AMOUNT OF FORCE,

216
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,333
WATER IS STRONG ENOUGH
TO RIP THROUGH STEEL.

217
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:36,625
UNDERESTIMATE ITS POWERS

218
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,875
AND YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF
IN A WORLD OF PAIN!

219
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,791
- ICE MAKE: BATTLE-AXE!

220
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,208
- CAN'T YOU SEE THAT YOU'RE
JUST WASTING YOUR TIME?

221
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,916
YOUR ATTACKS HAVE NO EFFECT
ON MY BODY MADE OF WATER.

222
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,250
NONE AT ALL.
DRIP DRIP DROP.

223
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,250
- NOW WHAT'LL I DO?

224
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,750
- NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO,
YOU CANNOT BEAT ME.

225
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,625
BUT THERE IS ONE WAY YOU AND
YOUR GUILD MAY BE SPARED.

226
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:02,291
ALL WE ASK IS THAT YOU HAND
OVER MISS LUCY HEARTFILIA.

227
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,875
DO THAT AND I WILL
ASK OUR MASTER

228
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,291
TO CALL OFF HIS
ATTACK ON FAIRY TAIL.

229
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,916
- Gray: AW C'MON. DON'T GIVE
ME THAT CRAP.

230
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,250
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW WE'RE PAST
THE POINT OF NO RETURN.

231
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,833
BESIDES, LUCY'S ONE OF US.

232
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,458
I'D RATHER GIVE MY LIFE
THAN HAND HER OVER TO YOU.

233
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:25,541
- HE'D RATHER GIVE HIS LIFE,
GIVE HIS LIFE, GIVE HIS LIFE.

234
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,750
LUCY'S MY RIVAL! LUCY'S
MY RIVAL! LUCY'S MY RIVAL!

235
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,875
HE LOVES HER!

236
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,041
- ( she screams and sobs )

237
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,166
- OH, THE PAIN! HOW CAN
FATE BE SO CRUEL?

238
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,500
MY HEART FEELS LIKE IT'S
BEEN SHRED TO BITS!

239
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,041
IT HURTS. OH, IT HURTS!

240
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,500
- WHAT'S WRONG? ARE YOU
FEELIN' SICK OR SOMETHING?

241
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,625
- SHE'S NOT WORTHY
OF MY PRINCE.

242
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:52,166
LUCY HEARTFILIA CANNOT
BE ALLOWED TO LIVE!

243
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,791
LUCY HEARTFILIA CANNOT
BE ALLOWED TO LIVE!

244
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:03,916
- ( water cannon blast )

245
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,125
- THAT BURNS. WHAT'S YOUR DEAL?

246
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:12,125
AND WHAT'S YOUR
PROBLEM WITH LUCY?

247
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,250
ICE MAKE...

248
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,833
SO FAST. I DUNNO IF MY MAKER
MAGIC CAN KEEP UP!

249
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,375
MAN, THAT WAS CLOSE!

250
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,958
- EVER SINCE THE DAY I WAS BORN,

251
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,541
I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED
BY THE RAIN.

252
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:34,916
IT GIVES ME STRENGTH.
IT MAKES ME INVINCIBLE!

253
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
PREPARE TO BE SCALDED
BY MY JEALOUS RAGE!

254
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,958
- WHAT'RE YOU JEALOUS OF?

255
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,708
ICE MAKE: SHIELD!

256
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:48,958
MAN, THIS WATER IS BOILING HOT!
I CAN'T KEEP THIS UP FOR LONG!

257
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:52,791
- LIKE I TOLD YOU. I AM AT MY
MOST POWERFUL IN THE RAIN!

258
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,875
YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO DEFEAT ME!

259
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,250
HE USED THE STEAM AS A
SMOKE SCREEN.

260
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,416
HE'S NOT JUST HANDSOME,
HE'S ACTUALLY SMART, TOO!

261
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,791
I REALLY AM IN LOVE.

262
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,583
- I CAN'T WASTE ANY MORE TIME
ON THIS CRAZY WATER CHICK.

263
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,875
I GOTTA FIGURE OUT HOW
TO STOP THE GIANT!

264
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:14,916
- ( glass panes shattering )

265
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,375
- SO HOT! IT'S BURNIN' MY SKIN!

266
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,250
- Juvia: IT'S ALL OVER NOW!

267
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,125
- OH YEAH?

268
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,166
- HE JUMPED INTO THE
SCALDING WATER!

269
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,375
- FREEZE UP!

270
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,458
- NO. IT CAN'T BE! I SHOULD BE
ANGRY HE FROZE MY BOILING WATER.

271
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:39,125
BUT. BLUSH.

272
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,958
- IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK!
I DIDN'T MEAN TO!

273
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,041
- I'VE NEVER BEEN
SO EMBARRASSED.

274
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,875
WILL I BE STUCK
LIKE THIS FOREVER?

275
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,041
- SORRY!

276
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:52,583
- EVEN THOUGH I'M HIS ENEMY.
HE RELEASED ME.

277
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,375
HE'S SUCH A NICE GUY!

278
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,833
- HEY, LET'S JUST START
OVER, OKAY?

279
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,625
- LET'S NOT. HONESTLY,
I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU

280
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,833
SO THERE'S NO POINT
IN US FIGHTING ANYMORE.

281
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,500
- IS THIS YOUR WEIRD WAY OF
ADMITTING YOU CAN'T BEAT ME?

282
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,041
- YOU KNOW, I'M MUCH
STRONGER THAN LUCY.

283
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:11,291
IF YOU'D LET ME. I WOULD
BE HAPPY TO PROTECT YOU.

284
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,583
- PROTECT ME? LIKE FROM WHAT?

285
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,291
- Juvia: WELL, ANYTHING THAT
MIGHT HURT YOU.

286
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:23,000
'CAUSE, I THINK THAT YOU'RE,
UH...YOU'RE SO...

287
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,666
- IS IT JUST ME OR IS THIS
RAIN GETTIN' WORSE?

288
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,666
- OH, THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING!

289
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,333
- IT WON'T LET UP. MAN,
THIS RAIN IS SO GLOOMY.

290
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:35,958
- ( echoing )
GLOOMY.

291
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,625
IS SOMETHIN' WRONG?

292
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:41,583
- I THOUGHT HE WAS DIFFERENT
BUT HE'S JUST LIKE ALL THE REST.

293
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,500
- HOW COULD YOU BE SO CRUEL?

294
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:44,958
- WHAT'S WITH YOU?

295
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,875
- I WON'T LET MY FEELINGS
FOR HIM SWAY ME ANY LONGER!

296
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:52,041
- I'LL JUST HAVE TO FREEZE
IT AGAIN! I CAN'T DO IT!

297
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,250
THE WATER'S EVEN
HOTTER THAN BEFORE!

298
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:59,041
- I'M THROUGH WITH LOVE!
AND I'M THROUGH WITH YOU!

299
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:05,958
- I DON'T THINK JUVIA
SHOULD BE ALLOWED

300
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,541
TO GO ON OUR FIELD TRIPS.

301
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:11,625
- FOR REAL 'CAUSE EVERYWHERE SHE
GOES IT GETS RAINY AND GLOOMY.

302
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,833
- IT'S TRUE. I AM A RAIN WOMAN.

303
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,166
- MAN, WHAT A GLOOMY DAY!

304
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,541
- WHAT'S THIS
DUMB-LOOKIN' DOLL THING?

305
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:25,833
( she sobs )

306
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,708
- CAN'T YOU DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THE RAIN?

307
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,208
WE CAN'T EVER DO
ANYTHING OUTDOORS,

308
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,208
NO FISHING, NO CAMPING.

309
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:34,833
- I'M SORRY BUT I DON'T HAVE
ANY CONTROL OVER IT.

310
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,666
- Bora: WELL, I CAN'T
HANDLE ALL THIS GLOOM.

311
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,250
I THINK WE SHOULD
SEE OTHER PEOPLE.

312
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,041
- THIS RAIN IS TOTALLY GLOOMY.

313
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,458
- YEAH, IT MAKES YOU
FEEL GLOOMY TOO!

314
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,708
- THIS GLOOMY RAIN
JUST WON'T LET UP.

315
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:50,000
- I HOPE ALL THIS GLOOM
DOESN'T RUIN OUR FUN!

316
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:53,000
- I'VE LIVED MY ENTIRE LIFE
AS A GLOOMY RAIN WOMAN

317
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,166
BUT PHANTOM LORD
LOOKED PAST THAT.

318
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,416
THEY WELCOMED ME
WITH OPEN ARMS!

319
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:03,208
I AM ONE OF THE ELEMENT 4!
A PROUD PHANTOM LORD WIZARD!

320
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,791
SIERRA!

321
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,875
- HOW COULD YOU BE
PROUD TO BE WITH THEM?

322
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,041
YOU AND YOUR GUILD
ARE GOIN' DOWN!

323
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,875
- HE EVEN TURNED THE RAIN
TO ICE! HE'S AMAZING!

324
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:22,208
- ICE MAKE GEYSER!

325
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,208
( she screams )

326
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:32,791
- Juvia: I LOST.
IT'S ALL OVER NOW.

327
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:36,208
I'M GOING TO FALL TO THE
GROUND, AND SPLATTER,

328
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,791
JUST LIKE A RAINDROP.

329
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,041
I SUPPOSE IT'S A FITTING END

330
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:44,166
FOR A RAIN WOMAN
WHO NO ONE WANTS.

331
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,208
FAREWELL, GLOOMY JUVIA.

332
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,875
( she gasps )

333
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:53,500
- JUST HOLD ON, OKAY?
I PROMISE I WON'T LET YOU FALL!

334
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,250
- Juvia: WHY DID YOU SAVE ME?

335
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,500
- Gray: JUST 'CAUSE.

336
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,125
NOW GET SOME REST.

337
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,708
- HE SAVED MY LIFE.

338
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,375
- YOU GOOD? STARTIN'

339
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,083
- SO BRIGHT.

340
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,583
THE RAIN, IT STOPPED!

341
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,666
- HEY LOOK!

342
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,000
- THE BLUE SKY. I'VE NEVER...

343
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,833
SEEN IT BEFORE.

344
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:33,125
- SERIOUSLY? WELL, THERE YA GO.

345
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:41,000

346
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:44,041
- SO, YA WANNA GO AT IT?

347
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,708
- HEY! WHAT'S THE MATTER?

348
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:53,500
TALK TO ME, JUVIA!
YOU ALRIGHT? ANSWER ME!

349
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,000
- IT FEELS LIKE WE'VE BEEN
OUT HERE FOREVER.

350
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,125
AND THAT THING STILL
HASN'T CAST THE SPELL.

351
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,916
- THIS STRESS IS
BAD FOR MY HEART.

352
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,541
WE HAVE GOTTA PUT
AN END TO THIS.

353
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,875
- HEY, DOESN'T IT SEEM LIKE

TURTLE-ISH RIGHT NOW?

355
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,500
- HUH? SAY WHAT ABOUT TURTLES?

356
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,041
- SHE'S TRYIN' TO SAY
THE GIANT'S MOVIN' SLOWLY.

357
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,083
TRY THINKIN' BEFORE
YOU SPEAK, LAKI!

358
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,791
- IT MADE PERFECT SENSE
TO ME! YOU GUYS'RE JUST DENSE!

359
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,541
- NATSU AND THE OTHERS

360
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,166
TO STOP THAT THING.

361
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,666
AND NOW...

362
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,666
WE'RE GONNA LEND 'EM A HAND!

363
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:29,125
- THE LAST THING THEY NEED ARE
THESE THINGS DISTRACTIN' 'EM.

364
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,541
WE GOTTA WIPE 'EM OUT!

365
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,958
- IT'S TIME FOR US TO
TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS, KIDS!

366
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:36,500
- NOW LET'S DO THIS!

367
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,250

ELEMENT 4, HUH?

371
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,541
WHY DOES SHE HAVE THAT
CREEPY GRIN ON HER FACE?

372
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,708
- Gray: I DUNNO. MUST BE HAVIN'
A GOOD DREAM OR SOMETHIN'.

373
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,375
- THERE'S ONLY ONE LEFT!

374
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:56,083
IF WE CAN DEFEAT THEM, I THINK
THAT'LL STOP THE ABYSS BREAK.

375
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,791
- MIRA JUST FIGURED IT OUT.

376
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,666
- THE ENERGY OF THE ELEMENT FOUR
IS WHAT'S POWERING THE GIANT!

377
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,208
- WE CAN DO THIS. RIGHT GUYS?

378
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,500
- Lucy: OH, SO MIRA PUT ME
TO SLEEP TO PROTECT ME?

379
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,416
- Reedus: OUI. THEN WE BROUGHT
YOU TO OUR EMERGENCY HIDEOUT.

380
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,500
- I GUESS THEY JUST DIDN'T
WANT ME TO FIGHT.

381
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:18,416
I KNOW I COULDN'T DO A
WHOLE LOT WITHOUT MY KEYS

382
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,333
BUT I'M NOT HELPLESS.

383
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,875
- Reedus: YOU'VE GOT
IT ALL WRONG.

384
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,583
- NOBODY THINKS YOU'RE HELPLESS,

385
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,333
WE'RE SIMPLY TRYING TO
PROTECT ONE OF OUR OWN.

386
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,750
- THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

387
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,625
- BUT STILL! I CAN'T JUST SIT
HERE AND DO NOTHING

388
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,833
WHILE THEY'RE ALL FIGHTING
TO PROTECT THE GUILD!

389
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,583
I HAVE TO GO BACK
AND HELP THEM!

390
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:36,875
- I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT.

391
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,916
MIRA GAVE ME STRICT
ORDERS TO KEEP YOU HERE.

392
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,375
- THAT'S NOT FAIR!
( loud bang on the door )

393
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,666
NO. WHAT'S THAT?
WHO'S TRYIN' TO GET IN?

394
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,708
- JUST STAND BACK, LUCY!

395
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:00,083
- YOU'VE ENDURED MY ATTACKS
AND YOU'RE STILL STANDING.

396
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,375
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

397
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,500
- YEAH WATCH THIS!

398
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:06,916
- NATSU'S GETTIN' BEAT BAD! I'VE
NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS!

399
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,875
IT'S TOTALLY A ONE-SIDED FIGHT!

400
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:12,250
- LET'S SEE HOW YOU FARE
AGAINST MY AIRSPACE MAGIC!

401
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:15,333
THIS WILL TRULY
TEST YOUR POWER!

402
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,916
- I DON'T SEE
NO AIRSPACE MAGIC!

403
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:23,958
- AN INVISIBLE SPELL?
HOW'S HE SUPPOSED TO FIGHT THAT?

404
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:29,250
- Aria: YOU'RE MUCH STRONGER
THAN I THOUGHT, SALAMANDER.

405
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,541
- Natsu: I CAN TAKE
WHATEVER YOU DISH OUT!

406
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:34,791
- NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE
POWER OF A FAIRY TAIL WIZARD.

407
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:38,583
I'M ALL FIRED UP NOW SO
LEMME SEE WHAT YOU GOT!

408
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:51,875
( singing in Japanese )

409
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:15,500
- ALRIGHT, IF WE BEAT
THIS GUY WE'LL STOP THE GIANT

410
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:17,041
FROM CASTING THAT SPELL!

411
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:18,416
- AYE! BUT DON'T FORGET,

412
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,041
WE STILL HAVE GAJEEL AND
MASTER JOSE TO WORRY ABOUT!

413
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,291
- AW MAN, THOSE

414
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,041
YOU THINK WE HAVE TIME TO
GRAB SOMETHIN' TO EAT

415
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:26,666
BEFORE WE GO FIGHT THOSE GOONS?

416
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,416
- AYE! I THINK WE
SHOULD GO CHECK OUT

417
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,833
WHAT THEY'VE GOT
COOKIN' IN THE KITCHEN!

418
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:33,333
NEXT TIME: WINGS OF FLAME!

419
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,500
- UH-OH! IS THAT ERZA

420
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,416
- OH NO! IF SHE FINDS OUT

421
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,500
WHEN WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
WORKIN' SHE'LL BE SUPER MAD!

422
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:40,750
- Natsu: RUN FOR

423
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:41,791
- Happy: AYE!
