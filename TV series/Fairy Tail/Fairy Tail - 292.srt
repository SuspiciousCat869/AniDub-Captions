00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,000
[NARRATOR]
The epic battle with Alvarez

2
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:22,541
and the Spriggan
Twelve is underway.

3
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,166
As a precautionary measure,

4
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,916
Fried casts a protective
enchantment spell,

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,458
and covers all of Magnolia
under an impenetrable shield.

6
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:31,208
What?

7
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:32,916
Enchantment activated!

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,208
[NARRATOR] Though caught off
guard by the aerial attack,

9
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:39,041
the brave members of Fairy Tail
take on a flying armada.

10
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:42,000
This advance on Magnolia
is lead by Ajeel,

11
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,083
an exceptionally aggressive
member of the Twelve.

12
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:48,125
Erza gives her all
to drive him back!

13
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:49,500
[ERZA]
...Boom Blast!

14
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,083
[AJEEL] If you're one of the
strongest in your guild,

15
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,250
the rest of 'em must be pitiful!

16
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,666
You'll pay for that!

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,541
[NARRATOR]
As the battle rages overhead,

18
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,458
Wall, another member
of the Twelve,

19
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:01,250
leads a ground force straight
through the magic barrier

20
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:02,583
and into Magnolia.

21
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:05,666
Gray and Juvia make their
move to intercept him.

22
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,250
They're near the
girls' dormitory!

23
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,750
[NARRATOR]
In the eastern woods,

24
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:11,958
the sharpshooter Bisca's Osprey
team holds their position

25
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:14,333
manning the focused
magic cannon, Jupiter.

26
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:18,208
Elsewhere, Natsu, Gajeel, and
Wendy race towards the ground

27
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,083
to take on the
landing airships.

28
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:23,083
[NATSU]
Fire Dragon Talon!

29
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,791
[AJEEL]
Blow 'em outta the sky!

30
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:25,625
[HAPPY]
Whoa!

31
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:27,000
[NATSU]
Nice moves, Happy!

32
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,541
Now let's rock!

33
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:29,916
Right!

34
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:33,791
[NARRATOR]
Despite suffering losses,

35
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:36,416
the enemy continues
to surround Magnolia

36
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,791
with its overwhelming
military might.

37
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,750
[WARREN]
Three of the Twelve are here!

38
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:43,250
[gasps]

39
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:47,000
[NARRATOR] Even Mavis,
the Fairy Tactician,

40
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:50,041
begins to see her
options crumble.

41
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,458
[MAVIS]
No matter how I calculate it...

42
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,958
...we have no chance of winning.

43
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:58,375
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, an
unexpected visitor pays Lucy

44
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:01,833
a very intimate and
peculiar house call.

45
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,625
I knew this was your place.

46
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:05,291
I don't know why,

47
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,791
but you have been running
through my mind

48
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,666
ever since we met.

49
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:54,333
[laughing]

[yells]

51
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,958
Did that guy just push back
Captain Bakel with a punch?

52
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,166
I thought he was made captain
'cause of his brawn.

53
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,916
He's definitely not
the strategic type!

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,666
That is the only reason
he's the captain!

55
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,666
Nice scarf ya got
there. Gimme it!

56
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,833
[SOLDIER A]
Oh, good! He's fine, you guys!

57
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,416
[HAPPY] C'mon, Natsu,
get serious, would ya?

58
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,750
Normally you would
have put the hurt

59
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,541
on a pushover like this by
now, so what's the deal?

60
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:26,791
[NATSU]
Yeah, I know.

61
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,333
[HAPPY]
Huh?

62
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:32,541
But still, there's gonna be more
of these clowns to take out.

63
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:33,958
I gotta be smart.

64
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,666
I can't go full on
from the beginning.

65
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,000
Is this real life?

66
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,708
It's incredible.

67
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:44,416
He actually thought ahead.

68
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,291
I can't believe how
much he's grown.

69
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,583
[yells]

70
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:50,875
Get outta the way!

Hey there.

00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:23,541
Kareem of the Ajeel Division,
here to carry out my orders.

78
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,541
Sure are a lotta these jerks!

79
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,708
That's true. But we faced more
in the fight with Avatar.

80
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,708
Yeah, but these guys
are way better trained.

81
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,750
And a lot stronger!

82
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:51,875
Also, this is just a squad.
There's a whole army.

83
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:54,583
It's gonna be a real pain.

84
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,250
Huh?

85
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,958
A real man's dropping
in to lend a hand!

86
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,958
[ELFMAN yells]

87
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,875
Thanks, Elfman!

The hell?

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,916
You were able to use your
take-over magic on her?

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,083
So does that mean that you
have her curse power, too?

94
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,958
Yeah, that's what happened.
Otherwise, Seilah would've died.

95
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:34,125
She's so sweet.
I have the best sisters!

96
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:37,416
Sweet, huh? She did
steal her body.

97
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:43,291
I order you all... to sleep.

98
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,166
[SEILAH]
Sweet dreams.

99

Hey, Mira! It didn't
work on some of them!

102
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,041
I know what to do.

103
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,750
Give 'em a smackdown!

104
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,416
That's so manly!

105

[WALL]
Hmph.

106
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,083
Ah, the demon curse. Macro.

107
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,416
Now I get it.

108
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,416
She's playing with one of

109
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Emperor Spriggan's
discarded toys.

110
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,875
When I'm done with you,
there's gonna be nothing left

111
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,208
but a cloud of sand
blowing in the wind.

112

[ERZA]
Why can't I Requip right now?

113
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:38,666
Our spatial magic was blocked
on Caracol Island as well.

114
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,625
Could this be that
same wizard's doing?

[MAVIS]
Call up the Osprey unit!


116

Erza is in trouble!
Is the Jupiter ready to fire?


117
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,416
It's pointless anyway.

118
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,750
Even if we survive this wave,

119
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,750
they're just gonna keep
sending bigger ones.

120

Give my order now! I need
your telepathy, Warren!

We're all scared,
okay? Look at me!

I can barely stop my legs
from trembling to stand up!

our home and way of life!

This is Warren.
What is your status?

then we blast 'em.

on you to save the guild!

It did help. Thanks, Max.

away from my crotch, okay?

It's fine.

[MAVIS] We can't afford to
give up at a time like this.

That would mean the end.

I need to think of
a plan, quickly.

what you're doing here.

expect me to join you?

There's no need to fight it.

162
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:56,625
Besides, your guild lost the
war the moment I came here.

163
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,291
You remember what
my magic can do, right?

164
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,125
In just the blink of an eye,

165
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,708
I could make this town
the size of an anthill.

166
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:06,125
All we'd have to
do is step on it.

167
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,041
For now, I'd rather
take a relaxing bath

168
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,916
and enjoy your company.

169
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,583
You understand what
I'm saying, don't you?

170
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,375
There's no need to cry.

171
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,500
As long as you do
exactly what I tell you,

172
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,166
nobody's gonna get hurt.

173
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,791
My pets are extremely well taken
care of, believe it or not.

174
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,458
[MARIN] Wait, did you
just call me a "pet"?

175
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,916
Why are you doing all this?

176
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,583
[rumbling]

177
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,208
Whoa, what's that?

178
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,791
[BRANDISH]
The building next door.

179
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,458
I shrunk it.

180
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,791
I'm not asking you.

181
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,541
This is me giving you
a direct order.

182
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,041
Get in the tub.

183
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,458
[MARIN]
Can I get a little peek?

184
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,541
Just kidding!

185
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,916
[LUCY] I can't use my magic
as long as that guy's around.

186
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,583
I don't know what
she's really after.

187
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,750
I'll take her challenge.

188
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,375
[LUCY]
It's a naked battle!

189
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,125
[MARIN]
Aw, come on, Brandish!

190
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,625
Please let me out!

191
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,291
Now, what's your goal here?

192
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:23,666
You're not looking very cute,
so you should put this on.

193
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,000
[LUCY]
Are you being serious?!

194
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,166
[grumbles]

195
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:33,250
Oh, wow. I can't believe
it. You're adorable!

196
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,666
What is this girl's deal?

197
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,541
[BRANDISH] I could swear that
I've seen you before somewhere.

198
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:42,291
In <i>Sorcerer Weekly</i> ,
I would bet.

199
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,875
I was a reporter there. And a
model for about a year or so.

200
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:49,500
We don't get your eastern
magazines in Alvarez.

201
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,916
Maybe it was in last
year's Grand Magic Games.

202
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,375
[BRANDISH]
What is that?

203
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,625
It's weird. I can't remember.

204
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,833
[LUCY]
Hold on a second!

205
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,708
Did you really go to
these ridiculous lengths

206
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,791
just to figure that out?!

207
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,291
Yeah, so what?

208
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,541
Speaking of ridiculous, how
can we have a serious convo

209
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:05,625
while you're in cat ears?

210
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,416
[LUCY squeals]

211
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,208
[BRANDISH] Anyway, think you
could scrub my back for me?

212
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,500
[LUCY] Why in the
heck am I doing this?

213
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,416
You haven't told me your name.

214
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,250
It's Lucy.

215
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,791
Ah.

216
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,666
[MARIN] I'd be more than happy
to scrub your back, my lady!

217
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,458
Anything for an A-plus like you!

218
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:31,333
[LUCY] Her guard is down.
Now's my chance!

219
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:35,291
I'll take down one of
the Twelve! I can do it!

220
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,500
Are you Layla's daughter?

221
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,041
[gasps]

222
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,916
[LUCY]
You know my mom?

223
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,416
[BRANDISH]
That's what it is.

224
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,000
Your Layla's only daughter.

225
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,875
That's the reason I know you.

226
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,958
[gasps]

227
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,791
Oh, no, the room is shrinking!

228
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,625
Gotta run!

229
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,875
Wait! The entire building
is shrinking!

230
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:01,958
Agh!

231
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,500
Owie! Owie! Owie! Owie!

232
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,958
[BRANDISH]
To think you live in that dump.

233
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,000
Still, I'm glad I found you.

234
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,250
Who are you?

235
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,833
And what connection do
you have to my mother?

236
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:21,416
[BRANDISH] It's too much
of a hassle to explain.

237
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:25,625
[CANA] Get the hell away
from Lucy, you weirdo!

238
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,750
Magnolia isn't your personal
playground, ya know?

239
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,791
So you need to get outta here!

240
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,166
Cana!

241
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,583
Am I interrupting
something between you two?

242
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,041
Because it looks like some
kinky stuff is goin' down.

243
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,333
You've really got the
wrong idea about this!

244
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,833
Anyway, it's all okay now!

245
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,125
[MARIN]
Hey, what's goin' on out there?

246
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,083
[MARIN grunts]

247
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,208
[LUCY]
Whoops!

248
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,291
[groans]

249
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,791
Marin!

250
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:54,041
[LUCY] Now I can use my
Celestial Spirit magic!

251
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,791
Like Star Dress: Aries Form!

252
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:02,583
Brings back memories of our
tag team battle on Tenrou.

253
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:09,333
You have such exquisite feet,
my lady. They're A-plus!

254
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:19,916
[gasps]

255
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,208
[ERZA]
My Requip is back!

256
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,625
Is that wind?

257
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,666
Wind God Armor!

258
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,625
Nice try.

259
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,791
[NATSU sighs]

260
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,208
That seemed a whole lot tougher
for you guys than I expected.

261
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,833
Give me a freakin' break!

262
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,166
It's 'cause we were
holdin' back!

263
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,333
I was only using like,

264
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,541
1/100th of my power
to fight those guys.

265
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,291
Well, whoopdie-doo!
I was usin' 1/10th!

266
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,875
That means you struggled
more than I did!

267
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,500
[PANTHERLILY]
Another wave of ships.

268
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,708
[CARLA] It's like
there's no end to them.

269
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,125
Master Mavis said it
would be like this.

270
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:27,875
We just gotta have faith
that we can win.

271
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,208
Give up now!

272
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:32,708
[laughing]

273
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,958
How can you beat our army
when this is all ya got?

274
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:39,000
You losers can't even
handle the Ajeel division!

275
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:39,791
[WENDY gasps]

276
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,208
Natsu!

277
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,958
We can't, huh?

278
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:43,750
What?

279
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,500
[groans]

280
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,458
[NATSU yells]

281
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:54,583
[BAKEL screams]

282
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,958
[WENDY chuckles]

283
00:15:57,041 --> 00:16:00,166
[KAREEM] Yeah. I think
I'm just gonna stay down.

284
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,958
[BAKEL screaming]

285
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,625
What the hell?

286
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:10,625
Thanks, Natsu, for sharing...

287
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,375
...your fighting spirit!

288
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,250
[AJEEL groans]

289
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:21,291
Ugh. No way. How'd she--?

290
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,458
[AJEEL groans]

291
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,458
This shouldn't even be possible.

292
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:28,750
Because anything that touches
my body should turn into sand.

293
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,458
No blade can ever cut me!

294
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,958
A water sword?

295
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,541
[ERZA] The Sea Empress Sword
solidifies your sand!

296
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:47,458
[AJEEL] Damn! But you
won't win this fight!

297
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,166
Cannon fodder like you is
nothing compared to me!

298
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,500
You made a mistake
when you took me on!

299
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,875
No one can beat the great Ajeel!

300
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,500
[AJEEL yells]

301
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:03,458
It's over. I've figured
out your magic!

302
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:07,375
My Wind God Sword can
blow away your sand!

303
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,250
Sand is feeble in so many ways.

304
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,208
I believe a sandstorm
would change your mind.

305
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,750
[gasps]

306
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,041
[ERZA]
It's covering the whole ship!

307
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,125
And more!

308
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,541
What's goin' on? Where'd
this sand come from?

309
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,250
I bet that sand
wizard is doing it!

310
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,791
It's hurting my eyes!

311
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,375
[PANTHERLILY] Now what?
More enemies are coming!

312
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,375
You cats step back!

313
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:39,708
Us Dragon Slayers can use our
noses to find the bad guys!

314
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,500
What's with all the sand?

315
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,375
Make sure that the doors and
windows are tightly shut!

316
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,791
[MAX]
The weather's gone crazy!

317
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,416
What the heck's happening?

318
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,125
[CANA coughs]

319
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:56,125
[BRANDISH] Ajeel.
You're always such a pain.

320
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,250
This sucks!

321
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,458
I can barely see anything!

322
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:04,833
My darling Gray!
Where did you go, now?

323
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,000
He's using Sand World.

324
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,541
Seems they have a
fighter strong enough

325
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,125
to push Ajeel to extremes.

326
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,375
[BIXLOW]
Aw, crap!

327
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,291
This stupid sand spell
is getting through

328
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,875
the hole in your enchantment.

329
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:17,916
[FRIED]
Damn it!

330
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,458
[EVERGREEN]
Ugh. This is horrible.

331
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,625
As if the pollen in Magnolia
wasn't bad enough,

332
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,125
now we have to live
in a dust cloud?

333
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,458
If the sand is this
thick inside,

334
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,708
how bad is everything
on the outside?

335
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:29,791
[EVERGREEN]
What's the matter?

336
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,458
Can you not reinforce
the enchantment

337
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,083
and keep the sandstorm out?

338
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,875
Just give me a break!

339
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,916
I'm at my limit here!

340
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,750
The Jupiter is finally
ready to fire again.

341
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,041
But it's impossible
to aim with this.

342
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,125
It's in my eyes, Daddy!

343
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,000
Keep 'em shut!
You're gonna be okay!

344
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,791
No way.

345
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:52,166
He's covered all of
Magnolia with his spell?

346
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,541
They have the power
to shrink an island

347
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,791
and create massive
weather events.

348
00:18:56,875 --> 00:19:00,666
They're truly unlike any foe
that Fairy Tail has ever faced.

349
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,625
[AJEEL] Let me welcome
you to the Sand World!

350
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,416
In here, I am god!

351
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,291
And I reign without mercy!

352
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,958
Ramal Sayf!

353
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,250
[yells]

354
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,875
You're afraid of being
completely immobilized.

355
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:20,083
Of having to fight an
enemy you can't see.

356
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,458
To me, it's as clear as day.

357
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:26,750
Not only can I see your
fear, I can feel it!

358
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,041
There!

359
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,833
[AJEEL] Pathetic!
You don't have a chance!

360
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,291
Recognize me as your god,

361
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,041
and start begging me
for my forgiveness.

362
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,500
Do that and I'll show you mercy.

363
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:49,083
I'll grant you an instant death.

364
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:52,791
[ERZA]
My strength... is fading.

365
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,458
[AJEEL]
It's excruciating.

366
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:57,666
My magic can dry up all
the water in your body.

367
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,041
The source of life itself.

368
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:04,375
Do you want to shrivel up and
die painfully in that way?

369
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:09,791
Come on. Say "god" and
I'll end your suffering.

370
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,541
[laughs]

371
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,250
You are strong.

372
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:24,041
But still, you are not a god.

373
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,083
And even if you were...

374
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,916
...my guild, my friends...

375
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,583
...would never bow down...
because we're not afraid.

376
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,041
Huh?

377
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:38,125
[ERZA] And we don't put
our faith in just anyone.

378
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,708
We know exactly where to look!

379
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:43,875
Morning Star Armor!

380
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,333
You're wasting your time!

381
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,541
Ramal Fas!

382
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,791
Now, your head is mine!

383
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,083
I see a sparkle up there!

384
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,791
It's coming from the fleet!

385
00:20:58,875 --> 00:20:59,833
I see it!

386
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:03,791
Yes. And I know
exactly what it is.

387
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,125
That's Erza's light!

388
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:19,666
[AJEEL screams]

389
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,916
No! Impossible!

390
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,333
Did you get 'em?

391
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:28,166
You know Mommy
never misses a shot!

392
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:44,083
Nakagami... Starlight!

393
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,666
It's clear again.

394
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,333
Sure is.

395
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:04,833
[chuckles]

396
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,166
[LUCY] Erza and Bisca put
their faith in each other

397
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,583
to sweep away the
Desert King Ajeel.

398
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,750
But now, another member
of the Spriggan Twelve,

399
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,916
"Judge" Wall, may pose
an even bigger threat

400
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,333
to Magnolia.

401
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:50,041
Gray's team struggles
with an enemy

402
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,375
that seems to know
their every weakness.

403
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:54,500
Meanwhile, Wall's next
target is Fried,

404
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:57,125
who's also struggling to
keep up his enchantment

405
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,291
inside Kardia Cathedral.

406
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:02,375
Next Time: "For Whom
the Parfum Flows."

407
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:05,958
The bond we share extends
far beyond the guild hall.
