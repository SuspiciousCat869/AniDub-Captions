Now that the guild's got
its own bath-house,

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,250
I might never take
another job again.

Well, with all the
requests we've had

since the Grand Magic Games,
you may not have a choice.

7
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:35,708
It's true. This is the busiest
that Fairy Tail's been in years.

8
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:38,000
[LEVY] Which is why
it's so important to relax.

00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,833
Don't wanna overwork ourselves.

10
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,958
Ah. So is that why you aren't
out with Jet and Droy today?

11
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,583
It wasn't my idea.

12
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:47,500
But when the boys insisted they
could handle a job on their own,

13
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,958
well, I didn't think
I should argue.

All right, Droy!

16
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,291
Let's show Levy what we can do!

17

Not that she's here--

18
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,083
We need to let her know
that we're strong men

Please save us, Gajeel!

We're completely helpless!

22

What possessed you
to bring those two?

23
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:09,416
I didn't invite 'em.
They followed us!

Speaking of team-ups.

25
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:11,875
Natsu and Gray just went away

26
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:14,583
on some random job
together without me.

27

Just the two of them?
Sounds risky.

As crazy as it seems, they've
kinda been getting along lately.

put that to the test.

[LUCY] Well, Happy's with 'em,
so maybe he can keep the peace.

31

Hear that? Sounds
like Natsu and Gray

32
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:29,041
might actually be growin'
up a little bit, huh?

33

Yeah, we'll see.

34
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:33,041
I'm sure Natsu can handle
whatever Gray throws at him.

Can he, now?

36

handle anything!

I was hoping for some quiet.

seems a bit stiff, sir.

that Natsu felt you up.

It wasn't like that!

tried to cover me!

A spectacle!

We gave a rousing performance,
to say the least.

Actually, I haven't seen them.

It seems like they
should be done by now.

I don't think they went too far,

go and check on 'em.

I'm not sure
that's even possible.

316
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,791
[GRAY, NATSU growling]

317
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,291
Okay, so if I remember
everything correctly,

318
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:42,125
the Ten Wizard Saints are
chosen by the Magic Council,

319
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,416
but how does someone get
to be an Emperor of Ishgar?

320
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,166
The same way?

321
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,375
That's right.

322
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,541
Master Makarov and
Lamia Scale's Jura

323
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,083
have been Wizard
Saints for years.

324
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,166
Jose of Phantom Lord
once held this title,

325
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,750
but was stripped of it.

326
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,250
For that matter, so was
Jella--I mean, Siegrain,

327
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,916
when he left the Magic Council.

328
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,458
But the Wizard Saints
are far from equals.

329
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,875
The four strongest among them
are called Emperors of Ishgar.

330
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,791
Maybe I should just
go back to the guild.

331
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,375
[WENDY]
What's "Ishgar"?

332
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,291
[ERZA] One of the names
of this continent.

333
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,000
So, one of the strongest
wizards around,

334
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,750
--needs help from these dorks?
--[NATSU growls]

335
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,708
I hope Erza bites
your friggin' head off!

336
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,250
Yeah, well, I hope she rubs
your head in dragon crap!

337
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,791
Well, I hope she...

338
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,083
[ERZA] Why does it feel like
I'm the one being insulted here?

339
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,166
Uh. Hey, I think
that's the house!

340
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,500
Up there, on top of
that hill! See it?

341
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:34,500
[ERZA]
Good eye.

342
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,416
[LUCY]
Phew. We finally made it.

343
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,958
[HAPPY]
How do we know that's the place?

344
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,250
[CARLA]
We looked at a map.

345
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,208
[LUCY] So this is the
home of Warrod Sequen,

346
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,666
the fourth strongest
of the Wizard Saints!

347
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,000
[NATSU]
Dude lives in a hovel!

348
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,541
[HAPPY]
Talk about shabby!

349
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,041
[LUCY] I was about to say that
it reminds me of your place.

350
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,208
[WENDY]
Is anyone home?

351
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,666
[ERZA]
We've come from Fairy Tail.

352
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,583
About the job request?

353
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,291
[HAPPY]
Whoa.

354
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,708
[CARLA] I've never seen
this many houseplants.

355
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,750
[LUCY]
Excuse me, sir?

356
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:03,666
[WARROD]
Shh.

357
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,208
[LUCY]
Ah! Sorry!

358
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,875
[WARROD]
Hush.

359
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,333
Be silent, will you?

360
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,458
[GROUP gasps]

361
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,000
[WARROD]
Plants prefer peace and quiet.

362
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:21,083
So, do me a favor and kindly
shut your wretched mouths!

363
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,416

Aww. Just kidding!

C'mon, kids, it was
just a joke! Lighten up!

369
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,958
It's my belief that
plants and flowers

370
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,958
adore the sound
of the human voice!

[laughing]

372
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,375
A tree?

00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,208
He's definitely not
as funny as he looks.

374
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,541
You tellin' me this
guy's a Wizard Saint?

375
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,375
[WARROD] I bid you welcome,
wizards of Fairy Tail.

376
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,916
Thank you for traveling
such a long way.

377
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,583
Now, tell me, who amongst you
are called Natsu and Gray?

378
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,125
[WARROD]
My goodness!

379
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,041
You're a bit more
feline than I imagined!

380
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,083
[NATSU, GRAY]
Uh...

381
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,208
Got you again!
You're so gullible!

382
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,000
[WARROD laughing]

383
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,375
Well, at least he
cracks himself up.

384
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,333
Uhh. Yeah.

385
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,250
[WARROD laughing]

386
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,833
[GRAY]
He's still laughing at that?

387
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,208
[NATSU] So, can we
make fun of him, or--?

388
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,250
[WENDY] Of course not.
He's like royalty.

389
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,416
All that laughing's
got me thirsty!

[WENDY whimpering]

391
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,833
Pardon me, but we
seek an audience

392
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,583
with a Wizard Saint by the
name of Sir Warrod Sequen,

393
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,416
and need to know
if we've found him.

394
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,750
[WARROD]
Yes.

395
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,875
You now stand before
Warrod Sequen, in the bark.

396

Huh?

399
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,250

it's really me!

This old man's a
real piece of work.

402
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
You can say that again.

403
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,375
[WARROD]
I'm retired now.

404
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,375
And since retiring,
I've spent my days

405
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,833
bringing the deserts of
this land back to life.

406
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,291
Retired, you said.

407
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,750
Can I take that to mean you
belonged to a guild once?

408
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,250
[WARROD chuckles]

409
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,333
Yes, and a great guild it was.

410
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,500
But that was a long time ago.

411
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:15,875
These days my allegiance
is to nature.

412
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,291
Every retired man needs a hobby.

413
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,333
Mine is turning
deserts into forests.

414
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,416
As you can imagine,
I've seen many peculiar things

415
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,916
traveling about the
deserts of this land.

416
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,166
Most recently, I came
across a village

417
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,250
hidden in the Mountains.

418
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,541
As it turned out, I had
read about this place before.

419
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,333
Known as the Village of
the Sun, its people worship

420
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:40,458
an ever-burning flame
as their guardian deity.

421
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,708
They've got a fire
that never goes out?

422
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,166
[WARROD]
They do.

423
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,375
But when I got there, the
whole place had frozen over.

424
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,416
[GRAY grunts]

425
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,416
[WARROD] Be it by nature,
or the folly of man.

426
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,625
Every person,
plant, and creature.

427
00:17:56,708 --> 00:18:01,208
All the buildings, too.
The river was solid ice.

428
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,875
Even the sacred flame
of the village was frozen,

429
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,916
though it burns on, even now.

430
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,083
It's possible to freeze a flame?

431
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,625
Oh, that poor village.

432
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,666
I have no idea what happened
to the people there.

433
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,291
However, one thing
that was clear to me

434
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,416
is that they're still alive.

435
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,958
[HAPPY] I thought you
said they were all frozen.

436
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,708
[CARLA]
None of this makes sense.

437
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,875
The people of that village
are in dire need of help.

438
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:28,250
They must be restored.
That is why I called on you.

439
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:32,375
Break the curse of ice.
That is your task.

440
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,791
No problem!
I'll just melt the stuff!

441
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,375
Those folks're gonna be
nice and toasty real soon!

442
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:40,125
If that's all you needed, then
why'd you ask for both of us?

443
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:43,166
Because, this ice
is far from ordinary.

444
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,250
It will take more than
fire alone to melt it.

445
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,583
Huh.

446
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,083
Needless to say, we'll
do as you ask, but--

447
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,250
[WARROD]
Hm?

448
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,083
You're one of the
strongest wizards alive.

449
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,833
Surely if we can handle
this, then so could you.

450
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,166
[WARROD]
I believe you may be under

451
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,958
a certain misconception
about my rank.

452
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,708
[GROUP gasps]

453
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,208
[WARROD]
Despite the heady title,

454
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,750
we Wizard Saints are
far from omnipotent.

455
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,750
We're just ten people
the council chose

456
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,416
to put on top of a list.

457
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,375
There are many wizards on
this continent who surpass me.

458
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,583
And there are wizards
beyond this continent

459
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,791
who surpass even them.

460
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:20,875
And when you look at it like
that, I'm really no one special.

461
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,125
As a matter of fact,

462
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:25,000
I have almost no
aggressive spells to speak of.

463
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,750
In a battle of might against
youngsters like yourselves,

464
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,541
I wouldn't stand a chance.

465
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,000
Even so.

466
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,416
[WARROD] Everyone has their
strengths and weaknesses.

467
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,666
This is what inspires
wizards to forge alliances.

468
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,125
And then form guilds.
Wouldn't you agree, my dear?

469
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,500

00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,166
[BOTH growl]

472
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,583
--Aye!
--[laughs]

473
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,458
You're as wise as I imagined.

474
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,166
We accept your job request!

475
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,208
What he said!

476
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,041
You can leave it
to us. We got this!

477
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,000
We'll be glad to help!

478
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,041
[grunts]

479
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:02,708
[WENDY] So, this "Village of
the Sun," place. Where is it?

480
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,750
[WARROD] About 1200 miles
south, as the crow flies.

481
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,291
[CARLA]
Too bad we aren't crows.

482
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,458
Nonsense, the least I can do
is help you reach the village.

483
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:11,958
Gather there, all of you.

484
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,875
Be sure that you aren't
leaving anything behind.

485
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,083
What's he gonna do?

486
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,750
Perhaps he has some
sort of magical vehicle.

487
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,291
'Preciate it, but I'm
just gonna walk.

488
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,500
[ERZA]
Suck it up and do as he says.

489
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,125
Now, then.
Everyone ready to go?

490
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,875
[NATSU]
Wait, so it isn't a vehicle?

491
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,500
[WARROD]
Pivot right!

492
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,500
Ha-ha. Just as
gullible as always!

493
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:33,541
[GROUP]
Hey!

494
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:34,625
[HAPPY]
Huh?

495
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,333
[WARROD]
I leave this task in your hands,

496
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,833
youngsters of Fairy Tail.

497
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:40,000
Should you face yourselves
in this journey,

498
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,875
I ask you to look closely.

499
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,333
Do this and you shall
overcome whatever obstacles

500
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,500
may fall before your paths.

501
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,875
[ALL yelping]

502
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,666
[ALL cheering, laughing]

503
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,291
This is amazing!

504
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:09,458
That it is. He can make
a tree fly like a dragon.

505
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,375
Funny. He's humble,

506
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,791
but his magic is amazing.

507
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,916
The power to control
nature itself.

508
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:33,208
Time certainly
does fly, doesn't it?

509
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,125
[MAVIS]
Hey, Warrod!

510
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,958
Get over here, will ya? Hurry!

511
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,375
[YURY]
Hey. There he is.

512
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,458
[HADES]
He does like to take his time.

513
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,750
You were off
day-dreamin,' weren'tcha?

514
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:54,250
Take a look.
There's one dream come true.

515
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,708
Whoa. Amazing.

516
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,541
[WARROD]
It's our very own Guild.

517
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,083
[YURY]
Sure is.

518
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,958
[MAVIS] Let's take a picture
so we never forget this!

519
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,666
[MAVIS] The day that
Fairy Tail was born!

520
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:23,750
[WARROD]
A 105 years it's been.

521
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,291
And you know what?

522
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,833
Our Guild has barely
changed at all.

523
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:33,916
Mavis, those youngsters
have inherited your spirit.

524
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:14,625
[LUCY]
Thanks to Warrod's magic,

525
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,375
we were able to get to
the Village of the Sun

526
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:18,208
in almost no time!

527
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,583
But now that we're here,

528
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,041
we've found a bit more
than we initially expected.

529
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:25,166
Not only is this village
encased in magical ice,

530
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:28,666
it's also the ancient home
of a pretty major secret.

531
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,875
And on top of that, ours isn't
the only group of outsiders

532
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:34,625
that thinks it has
business here.

533
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:38,208
Next Time:
"Wizards vs. Hunters."

534
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:41,750
This other group? They're
called Sylph Labyrinth!
