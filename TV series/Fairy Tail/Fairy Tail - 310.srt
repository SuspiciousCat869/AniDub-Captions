1
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:14,666
How can you do this right now?
At a time like this?

2
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,333
Please stop.

3
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,708
[NATSU]
I had to do it.

4
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,666
'Cause she was crying.

5
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,166
[NATSU]
She looked so weak and fragile.

6
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,833
Her voice was
trembling with fear.

7
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,625
[NATSU] I don't wanna
see Erza like that.

8
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,791
I've always looked up to
her as a strong warrior.

9
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,625
[NATSU]
You made Erza cry!

10
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:03,458
And I'm not gonna let
you get away with that!

11
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,791
[GRAY]
All right, Erza! Bring it on!

12
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,458
You're the one who's
goin' down this time!

13
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:26,250
[GRAY]
I hope she knows...

14
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:30,916
...that her friends are ten
times better than any armor.

15
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,041
We'll make sure she
never cries again.

16
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:37,916
Look at the person in
front of you and tell me...

17
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,666
...is he your enemy,
or your friend?

18
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,791
[ERZA]
I don't know what happened,

19
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:55,625
but you can't let some fleeting
emotion consume you!

20
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,375
We've grown up together!

21
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,833
Have you forgotten our history?

22
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,208
[ERZA, MAKAROV] Put aside
your anger. Listen to me!

23
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:36,458
[MAKAROV] It's perfectly fine
to fight from time to time.

24
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:37,833
[GRAY]
Gramps.

25
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,500
[MAKAROV] If you're
being true to yourself

26
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:43,458
and following your beliefs,
conflicts are bound to happen.

27
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,291
And if it comes to
a clash of spirits,

28
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:50,375
make sure your actions
are rooted in respect.

29
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,041
Violence must not be
fueled by hate and spite

30
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:56,166
for those with whom
you share a bond.

31
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,666
That's what a guild
is all about.

32
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,166
[MAKAROV]
Never forget.

33
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,916
[ERZA]
Never forget.

34
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,666
I love you both unconditionally.

35
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,000
And I mean that from the
very bottom of my heart.

36
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,708
[JUVIA]
Gray, my darling!

37
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,041
[gasps]

38
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,125
[JUVIA]
You're not dreaming!

39
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,750
Wendy nursed me back
to health! I'm okay now!

40
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,458
"Okay" might be taking
it a little far.

41
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,916
Natsu and Erza seem fine, too!

42
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,458
Juvia.

43
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,833
[JUVIA]
My love!

44
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,708
No. What happened?

45
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:15,166
Clearly their recklessness
caught up with them.

46
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,250
I was so worried about you.

47
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,041
I'm sorry.

48
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,083
[HAPPY]
Oh, Natsu!

49
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,583
Hey, buddy.

50
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:39,708
Erza, do you know what caused

51
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,125
that bright light
in the sky earlier?

52
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,125
Huh?

53
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,916
What's the matter?

54
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,458
[JELLAL]
This is insane.

55
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:16,541
We don't even begin
to compare to him.

56
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:20,875
How can one man wield
so much power?

57
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,458
[COBRA] He's strong,
but I can hear his moves...

58
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,208
...before he makes them!

59
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,750
[AUGUST]
I can also hear your moves.

60
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,708
You can't disguise them!

61
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:33,916
[yells]

62
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,791
You're not fast enough!

63
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,125
[AUGUST]
Too slow.

64
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,791
Spiral Pain!

65
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,208
An interesting spell indeed.

66
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,833
That's why....

67
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,500
...I mastered it many years ago.

68
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,583
[groaning]

69
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,291
[JELLAL]
There must be a way.

70
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:06,541
We need to have Porlyusica
treat Natsu A.S.A.P.

71
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,208
[CARLA]
And Gray. And Juvia, too.

72
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,416
Aye.

73
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,625
Get down, now!

74
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:15,375
[HAPPY, CARLA scream]

75
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,791
[LUCY]
What the--?!

76
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,333
Where did that come from?

77
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,750
It's been such a long time.

78
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,583
Hello, Erza.

79
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,083
You know this person?

80
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,541
I don't. Tell me who you are!

81
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:42,541
[WENDY] It's weird.
They look really similar.

82
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,958
Who am I?

83
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,916
One could say I'm you, Erza.

84
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,125
And you are me.

85
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,500
Seems we've won.

86
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,333
They're disappearing.

87
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,791
[MINERVA] Honestly, they were
dead when the fight began.

88
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,291
So I'm not certain
if we beat them,

89
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,458
or the one controlling
them was defeated.

90
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,000
But either way, it's a victory.

91
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,083
[ROGUE]
That blinding light we saw,

92
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,875
do you know what it was?

93
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:28,125
It's Fairy Law. That's
Makarov's most powerful spell.

94
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,041
Its purpose is to
obliterate anybody

95
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,958
who the caster sees
as their enemy.

96
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,041
It's a good thing we made
amends with Fairy Tail

97
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,000
before all this happened.

98
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,291
I wonder how effective
the spell was.

99
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:43,000
[MINERVA] Well, I highly doubt
it got every last one.

100
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,708
But I'm sure it wiped out a
sizable chunk of their forces.

101
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,666
I hope you're right.

102
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,125
Because we've nearly exhausted
our reserves by now.

103
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,208
[LECTOR]
Whoa!

104
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,958
All those bad guys just
collapsed outta nowhere!

105
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,166
[FROSCH]
I think so, too!

106
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,041
I'm not sure who was
able to pull that off,

107
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:07,083
but it looks like we're
safe for now, big sister!

108
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:10,000
I thought I told you
I'm not your sister.

109
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:13,541
[LARCADE] That was quite
the spectacle to behold.

110
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,166
[YUKINO]
Who's there?

111
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,625
[LARCADE]
So many of our men gone

112
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,583
in one brilliant flash of light.

113
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:23,916
Therefore, if I ever want
to face my father again,

114
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,583
I must repay this in kind.

115
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,500
Is he, like, an angel?

116
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,041
Oh, yeah. I think so, too!

117
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,916
He's another one of the Twelve!

118
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,583
I'm absolutely positive.

119
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:40,958
That so?

120
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,958
You really think you can
take on both of us, do you?

121
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,166
Then you're a fool.

122
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,000
[LECTOR] Don't forget
I'm here for backup.

123
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,708
[FROSCH]
Me, too!

124
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,208
Perhaps I should clarify.

125
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,583
I intend to repay everyone.

126
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,500
Meaning, all who oppose us

127
00:10:56,583 --> 00:11:00,291
will be subjected
to my punishment.

128
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,875
It's blinding!

129
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:05,958
May your spirits of pure white
into the heavens take flight.

130
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,875
What's wrong, Sorano?

131
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,958
[YUKINO]
Please, stay strong!

132
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,375
[MINERVA gasping]

133
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,291
What is this?

134
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,166
I can't take it.

135
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,250
M'lady!

136
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,041
[MINERVA]
No. Don't!

137
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,958
Please. Don't touch me.

138
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,916
[ROGUE]
What?

139
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,583
Oh, no. What's happening?

140
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:10,291
[ROGUE]
Well, this isn't good.

141
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:24,083
[WIZARDS groaning]

142
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,416
[WIZARD D]
Oh, wow!

143
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,708
[WIZARD E]
This is crazy!

144
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,875
No. We have to fight it!

145
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,833
I don't think I can.

146
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,333
What's happening to you?

147
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:52,541
[MAVIS] This magic is strange.
I don't understand it.

148
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,875
Only the adults are affected.

149
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,750
[MAVIS]
No. Wait.

150
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,458
Some people are perfectly fine.

151
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,583
What's going on here?

152
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:04,750
[gasps]

153
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,750
I feel so strange.

154
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,291
So good.

155
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:17,583
There's nothing I can do.
It's taking over.

156
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,125
[grunting]

157
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,958
[CANA]
Gildarts!

158
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:25,375
What the hell's happening
to you? Shake it off!

159
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,458
Ahh...

160
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,708
Well, whatever your creepy
thing is right now,

161
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:33,875
this is not the time!

00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,666
I feel so good.

163
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:48,291
Larcade's doing that
godforsaken spell of his.

164
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:53,000
[IRENE]
You and I share quite a lot.

165
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,000
More than you
could ever imagine.

166
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,250
[IRENE]
Not now.

167
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,250
Damned Larcade.

168
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,583
You need to get all the wounded
to safety, right this instant!

169
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:09,458
Yeah! Right!

170
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:10,500
Aye, aye!

171
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,833
But what about you, Erza?

172
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,958
[ERZA]
I wanna know what she means.

173
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,291
I need to find out the truth!

174
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,541
[gasps]

175
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,500
I can help you fight.

176
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,625
[ERZA]
Wendy!

177
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,083
[IRENE]
Imbuement magic?

178
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,625
I find it hard to believe
that not a single one of you

179
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,375
was affected by Larcade's spell.

180
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,333
I'll have to fight through it.

181
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,750
Please stop, Larcade. Right now!

182
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,875
[ZEREF]
You're harming your allies, too.

183
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,875
[LARCADE] That was not my
intention. Forgive me.

184
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,250
What kinda magic is this?

185
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,125
[YUKINO]
Why did it only affect her?

186
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,458
Too much!

187
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,583
[YUKINO]
Just hang in there!

188
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:09,458
[LARCADE]
My magic is rooted in pleasure.

189
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:13,958
And all those who have tasted it
cannot escape its grip.

190
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:18,166
Relentless pleasure sounds
like a gift, doesn't it?

191
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,416
But too much is dangerous.

192
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,875
Open! Divine Gate
of the Two Fish!

193
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,416
In fact, it can be fatal.

194
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:28,833
[gasps]

195
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,291
It seems that you've been kept
in the dark of ignorance,

196
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,916
but I will share the light of
pleasure and pain with you.

197
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,750
[gasping]

198
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,500
What's happening?
I feel so bad all over!

199
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,083
Never mind, I'm feeling
real good now!

200
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,125
Yeah, I think so, too!

201
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,500
We have to keep
ourselves together!

202
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,208
Don't give in to it!

203
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:58,000
[gasping]

204
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,291
[screams]

205
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,291
[gasps]

206
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,041
[KAGURA] All this talk
about light and pleasure,

207
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,541
and yet, still you're
partnered with Zeref.

208
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,583
Kagura, you're here!

209
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:15,041
I'm afraid you don't understand.

210
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,333
He's much more than that to me.

211
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,916
My father.

212
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,666
[JELLAL]
How could this happen?

213
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,458
This is the end
for Crime Sorcière.

214
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,708
We've been annihilated.

215
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,958
[JELLAL]
By one man...

216
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,750
[AUGUST] I've heard that you
once worshipped His Majesty.

217
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:45,625
Knowing his power, why would
you ever choose to fight him?

218
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:52,416
[JELLAL]
Because I saw the light.

219
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,166
The radiance of a heart that
could brighten my darkness.

220
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:03,541
[AUGUST] So light is good
and darkness is evil?

221
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,125
How simple-minded.

222
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:09,083
His Majesty was once
blessed with a son.

223
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,000
The boy was born into this world

224
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:14,000
possessing a tremendous
power of light.

225
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:17,625
[JELLAL]
Zeref... had a child?

226
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,416
[AUGUST]
The lad was unloved.

227
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,750
With nary a soul to share
his gift, he walked alone,

228
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,333
traveling the path where
light and darkness meet,

229
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:29,500
until he reached a
state of nothingness.

230
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:33,083
Good and evil are not as
simple as black and white.

231
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:40,333
If we were to call one thing
"good" in this world, perhaps...

232
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,791
Perhaps that would be "love."

233
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,041
[JELLAL]
Come on.

234
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:50,125
I have to get up. Now!

235
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,500
Erza is in danger.

236
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,541
I have to find her.

237
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,708
You're telling me
you're Zeref's son?

238
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,583
Indeed, my father
is Zeref Dragneel.

239
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,541
And my name is Larcade Dragneel.

240
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,333
Did he say Dragneel? Wait!

241
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,291
That's Natsu's last
name, isn't it?

242
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,416
[FROSCH]
Huh?

243
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
As a matter of fact, it is.

244
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,333
Natsu is my father's
younger brother.

245
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,875
Which would, in turn,
mean that he's my uncle.

246
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:20,708
[gasps]

247
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,583
What?! That's insane!

248
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,375
[LARCADE]
I was rather looking forward

249
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,666
to meeting him
during this battle.

250
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,458
After all, Father seems to
care much more about him

251
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,500
than he ever has about me.

252
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:37,083
So naturally...
I want him to die!

253
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,791
They're blades of light!

254
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,875
You think you can talk
down to us from on high?

255
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,833
[KAGURA]
Get down here!

256
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,375
Holy--!

257
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,291
I think she's awesome!

258
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,041
[YUKINO]
Kagura!

259
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:07,083
[LARCADE] And now you must learn
the taste of pleasure and pain.

260
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:10,916
These primal instincts
you can't deny.

261
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,125
Try and resist it
with all your might!

262
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:17,500
I can't even stand up! Kagura!

263
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,333
[screams]

264
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,375
[gasps]

265
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,791
[yells]

266
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,000
[LARCADE]
She bit through her own tongue.

267
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:39,708
Escaped the pleasure by
inflicting pain on herself.

268
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:40,791
[gasps]

269
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,708
[LARCADE]
She's fast!

270
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,958
Your magic's incredibly vulgar.

271
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,166
I know what she's doing.

272
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,208
She's preparing her
unstoppable technique!

273
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,333
[KAGURA] You could say the
same for my Grudge Sword's

274
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,000
thirst for blood!

275
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,250
Archenemy!

276
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:06,958
[gasps]

277
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:10,291
[KAGURA] He stopped my sword
with his bare hands?

278
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,375
You have the wrong idea.

279
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,625
You can't hold all the Twelve
to the same standard

280
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,791
of the ones you've
defeated so far.

281
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:23,708
No. I, Irene, and August
aren't like the rest.

282
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,041
I love that look on your face.

283
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,291
It's rare to see someone

284
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:30,000
caught between defiance
and resignation.

285
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,500
[yells]

286
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,708
[LARCADE]
Fear not.

287
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:53,208
For eventually, this pain will
give way to ultimate pleasure.

288
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,125
You were fierce earlier.

289
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:59,125
And you referred to the
magic I wield as "vulgar."

290
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:03,041
I concede that may be true
to a certain degree,

291
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:07,041
but if you look, you'll
find there's love in it.

292
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,458
It allows you to die
without feeling any pain.

293
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,333
[LARCADE]
May your spirit of pure white

294
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,375
into the heavens take flight.

295
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,500
Kagura, no!

296
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,916
I'm scared, Lector.

297
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,750
Enjoy it for now.

298
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,666
Your pleasure will
become so intense

299
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,958
you'll be begging
for it to stop.

300
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,958
[gasps]

301
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,375
No!

302
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:44,958
And now, your death will
be filled with pure bliss.

303
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:54,125
His Majesty's child.

304
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:57,250
Perhaps the only one
who can beat him...

305
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,166
[AUGUST]
...is his mother.

306
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,125
[LUCY] Kagura struck at Larcade
with her invincible sword,

307
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:43,791
but ultimately failed
to reach her target.

308
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:47,000
Meanwhile, still unconscious
after his battle with Gray,

309
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:50,625
Natsu's body is being consumed
by a mysterious force.

310
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,458
He's left to wander
among the memories

311
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:54,166
scattered throughout his mind.

312
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,125
Memories that seem like
they may belong to another.

313
00:23:57,208 --> 00:24:00,291
But are they merely from
a life he's forgotten?

314
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,875
Next Time: "Natsu's Mind."

315
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:06,250
In the search for answers,
hope can be found.
