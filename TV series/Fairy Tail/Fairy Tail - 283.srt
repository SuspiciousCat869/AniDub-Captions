00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,208
[NARRATOR] As Natsu and
friends are locked in battle

2
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:22,250
with the Black Magic
Cult, Avatar,

3
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,833
Erza, Juvia, and Wendy swoop in,

4
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:28,375
giving them an advantage over
the force of thousands.

5
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,333
Arlock, the high
priest of Avatar,

6
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,541
calmly greets the force
from Fairy Tail,

7
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:35,416
revealing he'd
expected their arrival.

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,750
Meanwhile, something weighs
heavily on Natsu's mind:

9
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:41,041
How to prevent Rogue's
tragic message

10
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:43,458
from the future
from coming true.

11
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:46,083
[ROGUE] Gray Fullbuster
will kill Frosch.

12
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,166
[NARRATOR] If this prophecy
does come to pass,

13
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,458
darkness will infect Rogue
completely, and the whole world

14
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,833
will be thrown into
chaos and destruction.

15
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:57,083
It's up to Natsu and the
remaining members of Fairy Tail

16
00:00:57,166 --> 00:01:00,166
to not only stop Avatar's
plan of annihilation,

17
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,916
but also prevent the future
Rogue warned them of

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,083
from becoming reality.

19
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,375
The rear forces have been
completely eradicated,

20
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,583
Your Eminence.

21
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,916
And the vanguard can't
advance any farther!

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,375
These foes, the magic they use,
it's just too strong.

23
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,333
We'll never defeat them!

24
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,500
The enemy's come
to finish us off!

25
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,416
Ah! This can't be real!

26
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,000
We have over 2,000
fighters on our side!

27
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:21,083
Yeah, that's true. And there's
only a handful of them.

28
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,208
[NATSU] Doesn't matter
how many you got.

29
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,333
The odds are against you.

30
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:28,958
Chumps like you will
never beat Fairy Tail.

31
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,333
[ARLOCK] And when Ikusatsunagi
begins to tremble the ground

32
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:35,458
beneath us, the
purification will begin.

33
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,791
How 'bout I make you tremble?

34
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:47,833
[AVATAR A]
Your Eminence!

35
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,458
Forgive me, but we
may need to postpone

36
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,500
the Purification
Plan's sacrifices.

37
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:54,375
We're about to lose every
single one of our branches!

38
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:57,416
[NATSU] He's right, so you
should give up now!

39
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,541
[ARLOCK] Heh, the optimistic
ignorance of youth.

40
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:03,125
I myself remember those days.

41
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,291
But that optimism
dies with age.

42
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:09,375
Worn down by one's journey
through the sorrows of life.

43
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:13,083
That voyage always
ends in suffering.

[ARLOCK] It would appear that
you are a highly skilled wizard.

47
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,666
But will you be able
to deflect this?

It was worth every
last morsel of pain.

I would do it all again.

00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:33,083
So that's them.
Gray's former guildmates.

324
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:37,083
Their bond still seems
extremely strong to me.

325
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,375
[PANTHERLILY] The important
thing is, the city is safe.

326
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,833
[LEVY] No thanks to us,
unfortunately.

327
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,541
[GAJEEL]
Eh...

328
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,666
We kicked some butt
Fairy Tail style!

329
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,041
It feels so good to work as
a team with all of you again!

330
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,625
You look like you've gotten a
little taller. Am I right?

331
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,083
Sorry. I'm exactly
the same as before.

332
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,333
It feels like we're back
at the ol' guildhall.

333
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,458
I have to admit,
I feel the same.

334
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:59,625
[giggles]

335
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,416
I've really been missing
times like these.

336
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,250
[ERZA]
All right! Victory is ours!

337
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,500
Let us raise a
shout of triumph!

338
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,750
[ALL]
Yeah!

339
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,000
Of course, we come
all the way out here

340
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,375
because we were worried...

341
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,000
...and instead, they've
somehow managed to take down

342
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,791
an entire army all
by themselves.

343
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:24,083
[STING] Not to mention
that huge monster. Heh.

344
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,250
Wow. I mean, you
gotta hand it to 'em.

345
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah, those crazy
Fairy Tail guys

346
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,500
really don't take crap
from anybody, do they?

347
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:34,166
I bet you "think so
too," huh, Frosch?

348
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,000
What the--?!
Where'd Frosch run off?!

349
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:37,875
Aw, man!

350
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,125
Hey. Frosch! Where are you?

351
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,125
Uh!

352
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,833
[ROGUE yelps]

353
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,625
[ROGUE] Did Frosch have
to go mingle with them?

354
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:51,416
Hold on. I think that's
Frosch from Sabertooth.

355
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,500
Yep. I think so, too!

356
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,041
[gasps]

357
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,166
What are you doing so
far away from home?

358
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,250
[FROSCH]
Good question.

359
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,958
[NATSU screams]

360
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,958
That big jerk! He broke
his promise to me!

361
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,375
What do you mean?

362
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:08,833
[ROGUE] Gray Fullbuster
will kill Frosch.

363
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,500
[NATSU] I want you to
swear you'll stay put.

364
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,708
You and Frosch can't leave
town until I get back.

365
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,500
[GRAY]
All right, you.

366
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:22,750
[gasps]

367
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,916
Get closer so I can see
your cute widdle face!

368
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,125
Awww.

369
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,916
[NATSU]
Huh...?

370
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,250
Just looking at you
makes me happy!

371
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,541
[FROSCH chuckles]

372
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,166
[NATSU]
Uh... I...

373
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,625
[ERZA]
Yes, Frosch is adorable,

374
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,541
but you still need to try
to get control of yourself.

375
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:40,583
[GRAY chuckles]

376
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,291
[GRAY]
I know, but I can't help it.

377
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,000
[JUVIA] Gray, should I
be worried, darling?

378
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,041
I'm cute, too!

379
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:48,791
[LUCY chuckles]

380
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,750
Oh, no! Is he trying to
take away my Frosch?!

381
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,958
You do realize everyone
loves Frosch, right?

382
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,833
[LECTOR]
Yeah. Sting's gotta point.

383
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,375
It's just one of those
things ya kinda can't deny.

384
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,500
[STING] Well, let's go
mingle with them too.

385
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,791
[ROGUE grumbles]

386
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,958
[ALL chattering]

387
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,041
Hey! Natsu!

388
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,791
We just wanted to come
and congratulate you

389
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,125
on a job well done!

390
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,958
I'm gonna be right
there, Frosch!

391
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,833
Oh, wow! It looks like Sting
and Rogue are here, too!

392
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,166
It's good to see you again!

393
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,375
Hey there, Lector!

394
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,875
You gotta give Frosch
back to me now!

395
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,625
Okay, sorry about that.

396
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,333
There's no reason
for you to get upset.

397
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,625
I think so, too!

398
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,125
[LUCY gasps]

399
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,458
[ROGUE]
Come on, Frosch.

400
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,791
You should know better
than to run off like that.

401
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:36,833
[FROSCH]
I'm sorry!

402
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,208
[LECTOR]
Calm down, Rogue.

403
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:41,458
No need to be all harsh.

404
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:42,666
[STING]
What?

405
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,458
Gajeel? You're working
for the council now?

406
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:45,833
This is just a joke, right?

407
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,041
[PANTHERLILY] I had a
feeling he'd say that.

408
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,416
[GAJEEL] Oh, you think
it's a joke, huh?

409
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,666
Well, you can laugh
about it plenty in jail!

410
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,750
[LECTOR] Hey. Relax.
He was just being friendly.

411
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:56,958
Gray, my love!

412
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,458
How come you've never
once treated me with

413
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,791
the same affection
you're giving Frosch?

414
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,125
[GRAY]
Jeez.

415
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,958
Give me a break and stop
being so freaking clingy!

416
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,916
[chuckles]

417
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,416
[LUCY]
Around 400 years ago,

418
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,916
a powerful Dragon Slayer bathed
in an overabundance of blood

419
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,333
from his prey, which turned
him into a terrifying creature.

420
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:48,541
The black king of the dragons.

421
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:51,041
Elsewhere, a solitary
magical prodigy

422
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,000
haunted by the family he lost,

423
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:56,083
immersed himself in the
study of forbidden magic.

424
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,916
Little did he know,
this would draw

425
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,416
the wrath of the god Ankhselam.

426
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,458
Next Time: "Memoirs."

427
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:06,666
And thus, the sorrowful
gears of fate begin to turn.
