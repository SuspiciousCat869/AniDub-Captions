1
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:38,458
In the end, humanity
has prevailed,

2
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,458
only because the dragons
chose to intervene.

3
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:45,875
For I was too much of a coward
to use the Lumen Histoire.

4
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:50,333
[MAVIS]
No, it wasn't that.

5
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:51,583
One day,

6
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:55,208
the time for it will come,
but not quite yet.

7
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,000
Grandeeney you're back!

8
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,500
[GRANDEENEY] Yes child,
we've returned at last.

9
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,083
And Acnologia has been repelled.

10
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,416
Feels pretty awesome

11
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,708
to have a pack of real
live dragons on our side!

12
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,250
Yeah, I'll say.

13
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,583
Weren't there like, thousands of
those Face things out there?

14
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,083
There were, but these
dragons wiped 'em out.

15
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,583
Friggin' amazing.

16
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:04,083
I'm proud of you, for
destroying that Face.

17
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:07,500
Thanks, but...
Carla did the hard part.

18
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:08,666
[GAJEEL grunts]

19
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,375
[PANTHERLILY]
So that's him?

20
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,375
That's Metalicana?

21
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,291
[LEVY]
He's your dad?

22
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,083
[METALICANA] You still look
like you just swallowed rust.

23
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,833
So do you!

24
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,708
[STING]
I don't get it.

25
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,166
I remember killing you.

26
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,000
So how can you be here?

27
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,500
I need to ask you the
same question, Skiadrum.

28
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,000
How are you still alive?

29
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,000
[WEISSLOGIA]
We altered your memories.

30
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,500
In order to help
you grow strong.

31
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,416
[SKIADRUM]
It was an experiment of ours.

32
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,500
One Igneel was against.

33
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,333
We raised you both
as Dragon Slayers.

34
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,208
And to complete your upbringing,

35
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:56,625
we gave you the experience
of slaying dragons.

36
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:57,875
[WEISSLOGIA]
However,

37
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:01,041
it's incorrect to say
that we're still alive.

38
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,083
Uh?

39
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,541
[GRANDEENEY]
In the truest sense,

40
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,625
we've been dead for
quite some time.

41
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:07,666
[gasps]

42
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,458
[GRANDEENEY]
Many years ago,

43
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,291
Acnologia used his
Dragon Slayer magic

44
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:16,833
to tear our spirits
from our bodies.

45
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:21,125
So we had three reasons
for residing within you.

46
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,666
Please understand.

47
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,833
We did it to defeat Acnologia,

48
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,000
and prevent you
from transforming.

49
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:30,583
But it was also the only
way we had to survive.

50
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:31,791
[WENDY]
You mean...?

51
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,000
[SKIADRUM] Now that
we've left your bodies,

52
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,916
there's no way for us to return.

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,666
The demonstration of
power we just gave

54
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,916
will also be our last.

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,166
We hope you can understand why
we had to remain in hiding

56
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,333
until the time was right.

57
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,416
[ROGUE]
Uh.

58
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,791
[METALICANA]
Even the mighty Igneel

59
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,750
was unable to defeat Acnologia.

60
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:56,708
However, it must be
said that Igneel

61
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,458
fought from the very
brink of death.

62
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,916
When you tell tales
of this day,

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,375
do not let that sully the
Fire Dragon King's name.

64
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,500
[GAJEEL]
Hm?

65
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,541
[METALICANA]
None among us had his courage,

66
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:20,083
or felt the depth of his
compassion for humanity.

67
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,583
[NATSU]
I'm sorry, dad.

68
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:32,666
You gave me a job, and I failed.

69
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,000
So I can't hold it against
you that you left.

70
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,708
But I had so many questions.

71
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,958
[NATSU]
Stay.

72
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,500
[NATSU]
I searched for you for so long.

73
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:52,500
I want you to see
what I've become.

74
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,291
I've learned to write.

75
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:57,000
And I can cook my own food.

76
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,833
I made the best friends.

77

I've joined the best
guild there is.

I have so much more
to say to you!

So don't go!

[GRANDEENEY]
We've only told you a fraction

83
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,375
of what we would if
there were time,

84
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,166
but I'm afraid there's not.

This is goodbye, Wendy.

You're leaving me?

Sweet girl.

88
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,125
The road you'll face
is fraught with peril.

89
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:40,333
But I've seen you gain
the strength to walk it.

90

[WENDY]
No, I can't, Grandeeney.

91

Not without you!

[GRANDEENEY]
Farewell, Humans.

96
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,458
Once, very long ago,

97
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:09,791
there was terrible strife
between our kind and yours.

98
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,958
It warms my heart to
know that in the end,

99
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,041
we part in friendship.

100

The era of dragons has ended.

We leave this world
for you to protect.

[SKIADRUM] The power of man
shall pave the future,

for that we are thankful.

104
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,541
[GRANDEENEY]
Four hundred years ago,

105
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:30,750
a Magna Carta pact was made
between human and dragon-kind.

Now, though we are leaving,

107

we shall not forsake it!

We dragons shall continue
to watch over you!

[GRANDEENEY]
I love you Wendy. Always.

112

[METALICANA] You should
get that face checked out.

113

moment, ya old rustbucket!

for everything.

You can't be gone.

damn waterworks, will you?

[IGNEEL]
Come on, Natsu.

120
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,833
I taught you what to do
when you feel like this.

burns within you.

I will.

I'm gonna work even harder!

134
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,166
I'm gonna get even stronger!

00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,375
And when I do,

136
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:24,916
I'm gonna take down Acnologia!

137
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,541

That's the way.

Speak of the future.

139
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:33,791
[IGNEEL] That's where the
power of life truly lies.

[LUCY]
It's been a week since then.

141
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,625
The war with Tartaros
left us all with wounds.

142
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,208
The kind that leave scars.

143
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,541
Magnolia took a lot of damage.

144
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:10,041
Our Guild Hall was reduced
to a pile of rubble.

145

But apart from the
destruction here,

the Faces devastated cities
across the continent.

147
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,875
[LUCY]
And what cuts the deepest,

148
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,166
is all the loved ones we lost.

149
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:33,791
[MIRAJANE]
Well,

150
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,208
so what now?

151
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,333
Time to start rebuilding again?

152
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,208
I suppose.

153
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,666
It's gonna be tough.

154
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,166
The townspeople fixed it
up for us the last time.

155
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,208
Yeah, somethin' tells me
we'll have to do it ourselves.

156
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,291
I shouldn't be here.

157
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,708
I really don't have the right.

158
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,125
This wasn't your fault, Elfman.

159
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,875
[MAKAROV]
None of this is anyone's fault.

160
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,666
[MAKAROV]
Perhaps it's a signal.

161
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,541

We missed you, Minerva!

323
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:47,500
[MINERVA]
I'm... I'm really home!

324
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:48,958
[MALE SABERTOOTH 5C]
She's crying!

325
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,916
[MALE SABERTOOTH D]
Think it got cold in hell, too?

326
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,166
[YUKINO] Stop it!
You're embarrassing her!

327
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,500
[DORANBOLT sighs]

328
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,541
Well, I did as you asked.

329
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,500
Everyone who heard you
say 'you-know-what,'

330
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,041
got their mind wiped.

331
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,166
[MAKAROV]
Hm.

332
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,208
[DORANBOLT groans]

333
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,083
And, I know what's next.

334
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:13,041
You want me to erase my own
memories now, don't ya?

335
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,166
I can do it,

336
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,583
but I hate messin'
with my own memory.

337
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:17,708
[MAKAROV]
Then don't.

338
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,916
You've earned my trust and more.

339
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,208
[DORANBOLT]
Hm?

340
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,500
[MAKAROV]
Mest Gryder.

341
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,125
Your task is complete.

342
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,666
Uh... What the--?

343
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,291
[DORANBOLT]
What was that for?!

344
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,166
Have you lost your mind?!

345
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,708
[DORANBOLT]
Uh?!

346
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,041
The hell is this?!

347
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,125
How did I get a
Fairy Tail emblem?!

348
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,333
Start talkin'!

349
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,166
You've always had that emblem.

350
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,083
We concealed it when
you began your mission.

351
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:47,291
Then, you erased
your own memory,

352
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,250
and infiltrated
the Magic Council.

353
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,833
[screams]

354
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:55,708
You're a good man. Fully
devoted to the mission.

355
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,291
Willing to sacrifice
your own identity

356
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,916
to ensure the safety of
the guild you serve.

357
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,541
[DORANBOLT]
Okay, whoa! Slow down!

358
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:03,958
What are you saying here?!

359
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,208
You think I infiltrated
the Council for Fairy Tail?!

360
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,458
Well then what about the time

361
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,791
when I infiltrated Fairy
Tail for the Council?!

362
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,041
This is pure insanity!

363
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:12,916
[gasping]

364
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,083
This is exactly why I told you

365
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,416
you didn't need to
erase your memories.

366
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,041
Pull yourself together, man.

367
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,166
[DORANBOLT]
Uh. So this is for real?

368
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,541
Yes, but no matter.
It's coming to a close now.

369
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,500
What do you mean?

370
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:30,541
[MAKAROV] I mean that we've
come to the end of an era.

371
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:34,500
It's time I let the kids go out
and find their own paths.

372
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:40,083
Fairy Tail will not rebuild.
I'm disbanding it.

373
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:47,333
[LUCY gasps]
I can sense a presence within.

374
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:50,875
I bet it's Natsu
and Happy! Heh, heh.

375
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:56,625
All right you two, party's
over, you're busted!

376
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,875
Wait... What?

377
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:03,583
[LUCY gasps]
A letter?

378
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:08,625
[LUCY] Wow. Someone writes
even worse than Erza.

379
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,750
[gasps] What?! No way!

380
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,500
What the heck are
they thinking?!

381
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:20,416
[NATSU] Me and Happy are goin'
on a lil trainin' mission.

382
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,375
Be back in a year or so.

383
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,041
Tell everybody bye
for us, will ya?

384
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,041
Thanks Lucy! See ya later!

385
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:30,125
[LUCY panting]

386
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,791
[LUCY] How can you just
up and leave me alone

387
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,833
for an entire frickin' year?

388
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,958
How dumb are you, Natsu?!

389
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,291
[LUCY]
Can't you see?!

390
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:47,541
[LUCY] Did you even think of
what this would do to me?!

391
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,833
I'll find E.N.D.

392
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,500
And then I'll take him down.

393
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,000
You will.

394
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:14,250
[MAKAROV]
Spread your wings, Fairy Tail!

395
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,333
[NATSU]
Sorry, everyone.

396
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:54,125
But I've gotta get way stronger
before I can show my face again.

397
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:57,166
[NATSU]
So I can keep all of you safe.

398
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:03,791
Perhaps you can
surpass me. Try...

399
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:10,541
Natsu. Or should I say
Etherious Natsu Dragneel.

400
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:16,000
[MAVIS] In the wake of
the war against Tartaros,

401
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:20,916
Fairy Tail is suddenly disbanded
by order of Master Makarov.

402
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,958
As that era comes to a close,

403
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:26,750
the story of its creation
is at last revealed.

404
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,833
It's a tale of hope
and friendship.

405
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:31,041
One woven by a barefoot girl

406
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:33,083
who had nothing but
a dream in her heart.

407
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:35,083
That girl was me.

408
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:38,416
Next time:
"The Fairy In Your Heart."

409
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,583
Beyond the end,
you'll find the beginning.
