I guess time flies when
you're saving the world.

It's like something

I never imagined I'd experience
anything like it firsthand,

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,250
You're bein' too touchy-feely.

164
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,291
Come on, give
Papa some kisses!

165
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,333
You're embarrassing me!

166
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,291
[arguing]

167
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,041
Do they seriously think
they're fooling anyone

168
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,041
with that act?

169
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,041
Just go along
with it;

170
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,083
I mean, it's awkward
enough as it is.

171
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,333
[ALZACK] Here she is!

172
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,375
My precious baby girl!

173
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,583
She definitely
takes after you two.

174
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:55,750
[PANTHERLILY]
I agree!

175
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,916
She kind of reminds me
of Wendy in a way.

176
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,750
Tiny and adorable.

177
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,125
[GAJEEL] Yeah.

178
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,833
--[WENDY] Stop picking on me!
--[PANTHERLILY] Huh?

179
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,583
[PANTHERLILY]
What'd I say?

180
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,500
[LUCY] The excitement
never ends.

181
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:13,250
For those of us on Tenrou
Island, only a week had passed.

182
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,250
But for our friends
and family, a long and lonely

183
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,250
stretch of suffering had
finally come to an end.

184
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,541
When I think about
what they went through,

185
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:25,708
I can't help but feel a strange
sense of guilt for their pain.

186
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,083
That's a long time to wait.

187
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,708
[HAPPY] The Seven Year Gap!

188
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:40,333
[LUCY] Oh man, I cannot wait
to soak in my own bath again!

189
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,583
[MAN A] Is that Lucy?

190
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,250
[MAN B] Whoa, it couldn't be.

191
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,291
Crap.

192
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,791
It's the landlady.

193
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,625
[LANDLADY] I heard you
were back, Miss Heartfilia.

194
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:01,708
I hope you and your
pocket book are in good health

195
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,083
'cause you owe me
seven years rent.

196
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,000
Five million, eight-hundred

197
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,333
and eighty-eight
thousand jewel.

198
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,500
I'm not letting you
inside your apartment

199
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,250
until I've been paid in full.

200
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,083
[LUCY] Five million,
eight-hundred eighty-eight

201
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,666
thousand jewel.

202
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,583
How am I supposed
to get that kind of cash?

203
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,333
I can't go
to the guild for help.

204
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,291
That was all the money I had.

205
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,250
We'll just consider the
rest of it a debt, okay?

206
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,000
[LUCY] The girls staying
in Fairy Hills had to pay

207
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,375
seven years of back rent, too.

208
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:41,000
I guess we'll all
be broke together.

209
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,333
Seven years.

210
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,833
We missed out on
so many important things.

211
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,833
Romeo's grown into
a handsome young wizard.

212
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:53,250
Jet and Droy have
gotten older and wider.

213
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,791
Bisca and Alzack are
raising the next generation

214
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,750
of the guild.

215
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,000
And on top of that,
everyone else is recovering

216
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,458
from Gildart's and
Cana's bombshell.

217
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,500
Makes me think about my dad.

218
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,833
Poor guy.

219
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:15,500
It's been seven years since
he's heard anything from me.

220
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,375
He must be worried sick.

221
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,250
Maybe it's time
I paid my old man a visit.

222
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,708
You know, Plue.

223
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:39,833
This might be the first time
I've actually missed my dad.

224
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,666
Pretty silly, isn't it?

225
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,250
But don't think I'm going
to see him to ask for money!

226
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,791
'Cause I'm not!

227
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:59,625
[LUCY] Still, those seven
years we lost weighed heavily

228
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,625
on the hearts of
the Tenrou Island team.

229
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,458
[BISCA] Erza.

230
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,500
I thought you'd
like to know about

231
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,625
Jellal.

232
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,666
Hold on now.

233
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,500
[JURA] By the way, Makarov, the
Wizard Saints will be holding

234
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:14,958
a meeting very soon.

235
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,208
You should come.

236
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,708
You need to be debriefed,

237
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,083
and there's a matter
of importance to discuss.

238
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:23,208
You know Ultear and a girl
named Meldy, don't you?

239
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,541
Yeah, but how do you
know about those two?

240
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:26,291
[NATSU] Gone!

241
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,208
It's gone!

242
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,250
[HAPPY] It can't be!

243
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,291
Tear the place apart
if you have to!

244
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,833
[NATSU] If we don't
find it, we're screwed!

245
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,541
[MAKAROV] So you're still
alive after all, Zeref.

246
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,833
Carriages are
death traps.

247
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,458
I'm never riding
one again.

248
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,208
You say that
every time, Natsu.

249
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,458
Question...

250
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,375
Why did you guys have
to tag along with me?

251
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,541
Cause our piggybanks are
full of moths right now!

252
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:02,958
We thought
Daddy Lucy might know

253
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,458
a 'get-fish-quick scheme'
that'll save our tushies!

254
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,875
[LUCY] It's called a
"get-rich-quick" scheme,

255
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,083
and I don't understand
why you even need one.

256
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,125
Last time I checked
you didn't rent a house!

257
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,708
Our stupid safe
ran off while we were stuck

258
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,125
on Tenrou Island!

259
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,666
And it took all of our
food funds with it!

260
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,958
How are we supposed
to eat now!

261
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:25,125
[NARRATOR] The prosperous
merchant guild, Love and Lucky.

262
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,125
[LUCY] Excuse me,
may I ask you something?

263
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,375
Yes, ma'am?

264
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,125
Do you happen to know
if Mr. Jude Heartfilia

265
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,333
will be coming in today?

266
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:34,416
He's still registered
here, isn't he?

267
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,833
Would you be Jude's
daughter by any chance?

268
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,041
[LUCY] Yep!

269
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,708
There a problem,
lady?

270
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,125
Is he out
sick today?

271
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,791
Do you have
his home address?

272
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:46,625
[RECEPTIONIST] Um...

273
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,416
Actually...

274
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,250
I'm very sorry to have
to tell you this, but...

275
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:57,166
Jude passed away
a little over a month ago.

276
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,416
It was a shock to all of us.

277
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:12,166
[LUCY] The weight of those
seven years keeps piling on.

278
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,541
[HAPPY] Lucy, I--

279
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,083
[NATSU] Happy.

280
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,708
[GIRL A]
So, like, my old man

281
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,416
is like so freakin'
annoying, right?

282
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,541
Yeah and my
daddy's, like,

283
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,041
mega-irritating, y'know?

284
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,458
And he smells.

285
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,708
[GIRL A] He's totes
stinky, like, whoa!

286
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,125
[GIRL B] Like whoa
and half, right?

287
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,750
Wouldn't it be
great if they just,

288
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,000
like, dropped dead?

289
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,916
[GIRL B] That would be
totes brill, girlfriend!

290
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:56,875
What's the
matter with you?

291
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,583
Are you loudmouths
really that dense?

292
00:13:58,666 --> 00:13:59,583
Read the mood!

293
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:00,916
[GIRL B]
Wow, rude much?

294
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,958
[GIRL A] For real.

295
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,250
Like, who even
cares about reading?

296
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,166
Shut up!

297
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,625
Just get lost,
would ya?

298
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:06,666
Yeah scram!

299
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,416
We already
were leaving.

300
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,000
By the way,
your dog stinks.

301
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,916
[GIRL B] Talk about
a total creepazoid.

302
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,125
[LUCY] Cut it out.

303
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:15,791
Uh...

304
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,000
Okay.

305
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:21,666
[LUCY] I'm sorry for putting
you through all this trouble.

306
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,250
[HAPPY] Are you
gonna be okay, Lucy?

307
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,666
[LUCY] Yeah.

308
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,166
I'm just shocked
about my dad, is all.

309
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,833
I'll be just fine.

310
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,041
[LUCY] I know a few years
have passed but it feels like

311
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,875
I saw him alive and
healthy a couple months ago.

312
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,625
It's hard to accept that
I'll never get to see or speak

313
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,250
to him again.

314
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,708
It's weird.

315
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:48,125
When I think back, I never
really got along with my Dad

316
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,208
when I was growing up.

317
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,708
And the thing
with Phantom certainly

318
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,083
didn't help matters.

319
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,291
But then,

320
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,500
after what
happened in Acalypha,

321
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,541
I truly felt like my
relationship with him

322
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,416
had been changed
for the better.

323
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:08,291
[LUCY] It's just like him
to work himself sick.

324
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,208
Guess it was
too much this time.

325
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:15,125
What bothers me most
is that even though I feel sad

326
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,916
and I miss him...

327
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,416
I can't cry.

328
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
The tears just aren't there.

329
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:31,916
Does that mean, in the end,
he meant nothing to me?

330
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,333
[NATSU] No of
course it doesn't.

331
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,291
I dunno how to explain it.

332
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:39,833
But I don't think whether
you cry or not means you cared

333
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,833
any less about him.

334
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,125
[LUCY] Thanks, Natsu.

335
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,083
You're right.

336
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,833
I know that.

337
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,416
I already feel better.

338
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,625
[NARRATOR] The wizard guild,
Twilight Ogre.

339
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,041
[BANABOSTER] I'm done
playin' games, old man.

340
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:08,500
I ain't got nothin' else
to say to you, mmkay?

341
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,125
There ain't no way
I'm gonna back down

342
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,291
until you and your guild have
paid the debt you owe me.

343
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,666
[NARRATOR] This is
Twilight Ogre's master,

344
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,041
Banaboster.

345
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,208
I would like nothing
more than to pay you.

346
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,875
But, I'm sure you're well
aware of the financial rut

347
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,250
we've found ourselves in.

348
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,875
Your business records
have a lot of holes in them.

349
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,541
It makes ya wonder if we're
paying more than we really owe.

350
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,000
Would you care
to explain that?

351
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,208
You tramp!

352
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,416
Are you accusin' me
of fraud or somethin'?

353
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,791
[MAKAROV] Not at all!

354
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,708
You can be assured that
we'll repay whatever we owe

355
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,375
with proper interest.

356
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,583
Someday.

357
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,000
You're startin'
to try my patience,

358
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,166
you little piss-ant!

359
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,000
Forgive me,
that came out wrong.

360
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,666
What I meant is that we
should start by renegotiating

361
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,000
our interest rate.

362
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,458
What!

363
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,708
I don't negotiate with dead
beats who rough up my boys

364
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,041
and don't pay their debts.

365
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,083
Capiche?

366
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,583
You think you're tough,
little man,

367
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,875
but I'll make you pay
for bein' disrespectful!

368
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:03,083
Me and my boys got
a reputation to uphold!

369
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,708
Understood.

370
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,875
We only came here
to discuss money,

371
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:10,000
but we can discuss
your reputation as well.

372
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,708
I have no problem
telling you what I think.

373
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,708
You wanna wear cement
shoes, ya old geezer!

374
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,625
"Get payback
for what's owed."

375
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:20,041
If memory serves,
that's the Twilight Ogre creed.

376
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,625
Much like
"an eye for an eye."

377
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,958
[ERZA] Indeed.

378
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,041
And when you think of it
in those terms, you owe us

379
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,208
for seven years of
property damage and abuse.

380
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,250
[MIRAJANE] So it
seems you owe us.

381
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,333
It's only fair our guild
be paid back for each

382
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,583
and every claim
during that time.

383
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,333
[MAKAROV] The suffering my
children endured at your hands,

384
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,625
all the years
I wasn't there for them.

385
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,875
It brings tears to my eyes.

386
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,375
You hear me?

387
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,708
So if it's war you want,
then it's war you're gonna get!

388
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,250
[MACAO] Good grief.

389
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,041
Well, I never really
expected them to go

390
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,250
the diplomatic route
in the first place.

391
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm surprised that
they held out this long.

392
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,458
You know.

393
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,041
Hearing them go to work in
there makes the past seven years

394
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,125
seem like nothin'
more than a bad dream.

395
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,666
I couldn't agree more.

396
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:12,291
[WAKABA] Natsu!

397
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,625
Happy!

398
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,125
What are you doin' here?

399
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,708
[MACAO] I thought you guys
went to Acalypha with Lucy?

400
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,166
Are you gonna join the brawl?

401
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,541
[WAKABA] Don't!

402
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,416
The last thing we need
is a fireball on our hands!

403
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,833
[WAKABA] What's up with them?

404
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,666
[MACAO] Beats me.

405
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,625
Tsoo-wee.

406
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:34,833
Tsoo-wee.

407
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,041
Tsoo-wee!

408
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,083
[FATHER] Hey pumpkin!

409
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,791
[LITTLE GIRL] Daddy!

410
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,000
[LUCY] The landlady?

411
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,291
[LUCY] Hey!
What're you- 

412
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,250
Help!

413
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,583
Someone!

414
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,458
I'm way too pretty to die!

415
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,583
[LUCY] My apartment.

416
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:08,208
But, it looks exactly the
way I left it seven years ago.

417
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,833
[LANDLADY] I've been
cleaning it every week.

418
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,500
Other than a few
of your outfits,

419
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,125
everything held up
pretty well over the years.

420
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,416
I even salvaged
some of them.

421
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,166
I left all your mail
on the table there.

422
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,333
Without fail, they
would show up every year

423
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,666
on the same day.

424
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,416
[JUDE'S VOICE] To my
dearest daughter, Lucy,

425
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,791
happy birthday.

426
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,000
From Papa.

427
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,333
[LUCY] He remembered?

428
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,458
[LANDLADY] Oh yeah.

429
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,125
The one on your bed
arrived this morning.

430
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,458
[JUDE'S VOICE] My dearest Lucy,

431
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:00,916
happy birthday.

432
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,500
As I write this letter,

433
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:07,791
I find myself wondering
when you'll get to read it.

434
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,291
A long time has
passed since the news of

435
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,833
your disappearance reached me.

436
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:18,708
I'm very worried, but
I have faith that you're safe.

437
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,375
You're so much
like your mother:

438
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,833
Stubborn as a rock
and blessed with luck.

439
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:27,958
I'm sure you're fine and
that I'll see you again someday.

440
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:32,125
As for me, business
is booming, and I'm about

441
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,833
to close a big deal
with the western region.

442
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:39,291
It keeps me busy, but I'm
still living a fulfilling life.

443
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:42,416
I think of you and Layla
every single day.

444
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,791
Those memories keep me going.

445
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,666
I miss you terribly.

446
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,500
Wherever you are, I hope you're
living life to the fullest

447
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,041
and following your own path.

448
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,375
Please,

449
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:57,458
never forget how
proud I am of you.

450
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,583
[LUCY] I won't, Dad.

451
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,291
[JUDE'S VOICE] Lucy...

452
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,625
I love you.

453
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,166
That is one thing
that will never change.

454
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,541
Bye Daddy.

455
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,416
I love you, too.

456
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,458
Wow.

457
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,791
You really let
yourself go!

458
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,458
Did you eat an old lady
and steal her looks

459
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:36,666
for good measure?!

460
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,666
You can quit
your gawkin'.

461
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,583
I'm Lucy's
landlady.

462
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,166
I knew that.

463
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,500
Sooo, can
we come inside?

464
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:47,583
It'd be best if you
left her alone for now.

465
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,041
[NATSU] But--

466
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,875
[HAPPY] We got a job we think
she'd be interested in!

467
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,125
[LANDLADY] She doesn't
need to worry about work.

468
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:56,625
A letter came this morning
with seven years' worth of rent.

469
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,708
Honestly.

470
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,708
It's amazing what
some parents will do

471
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,500
to support their children.

472
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:03,458
For real!?

473
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:04,541
That means we're
the only ones who

474
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,666
still have to worry
about missing money!

475
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,041
[NATSU] We don't
have time to stand around!

476
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:08,958
Let's get to work!

477
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,333
[HAPPY] Aye, Sir!

478
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,416

We'll pick up some white

00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,208
on the way back, okay?

482
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:26,166
[LUCY] The past seven years
may have left a painful mark

I'll go with you!

[NATSU] There's
gonna be a magic ball?

491
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:15,833
I wonder what kind of
fancy food they'll have!

you'd ever get to go!

It's for mature,
sophisticated grown-ups only.

[NATSU] I bet there'll
be cheese balls, and cakes,

I, on the other hand, am a
mature gentleman who will dance

00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:29,291
the night away

that self-confident before.
