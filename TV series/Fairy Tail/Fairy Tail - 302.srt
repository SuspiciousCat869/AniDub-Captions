00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:22,250
So, this August guy.

2
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,291
I gotta wonder what
kinda wizard he is.

3
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,916
Well, please, don't do
anything to test him.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,791
The whole point is to negotiate.

5
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,791
You'd be obliterated before
you even knew what hit you.

6
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,375
So keep that in mind.

7
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,291
Aye, sir.

8
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:38,208
The August I know is
kind and warmhearted,

9
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:41,083
and I believe he's the most
reasonable member of the Twelve.

10
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,833
However, he's also quite loyal.

11
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,458
His support for the Emperor
will be hard to sway.

12
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:50,791
So how are you gonna get past
that major sticking point?

13
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:51,541

No idea.

I can't believe you'd put
all your trust in this girl.

00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:06,541

like she's a bad person.

21
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:09,875
[MEST] But did you have to take
off her Magic Sealstone?

She's still our
prisoner, ya know!

anything going on

inside that spiky

gonna walk all the way there?

But you're my friend.
I can't just attack you.

I get that you're only
a projection, but still.

You know, you're a lot
like my best friend.

She had long, brown hair, too.

[CANA] You think that
makes us "a lot" alike?

[MAVIS] She died when
she was very young.

But even after she
was gone physically,

she was still there for me.

160
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:58,458
[COBRA] I just wanna
be on solid ground.

161
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,166
[gasps]

162
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,500
Something wrong, Yukino?

163
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,750
Nothing. Don't worry about me.

164
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:08,791
[IRENE] But the most troublesome
of all will be our fourth guest.

165
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:09,875
Another one?

166
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,000
Seems like too many to me!

167
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,875
[IRENE] This guest is
neither friend nor foe.

168
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,375
I shall have to deal
with them personally.

169
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,125
I don't know who they are, but
they're already being stupid.

170
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,708
Yeah, Lady Irene's a
High Enchanter after all,

171
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:23,750
so they're in for it.

172
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,291
Sucks for them.

173
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,291
Bein' huge is pretty
awesome, huh?

174
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,583
[HAPPY]
Aye!

175
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,291
I've never felt this cool!

176
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,541
Could you turn him back?!

177
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,833
So fluffy!

178
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,250
[BRANDISH] Sorry, Lucy, I just
did what he asked me to.

179
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,958
But the way he looks is
really freaking me out!

180
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,916
[BRANDISH]
He seems to enjoy it.

181
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,000
[gasping]

182
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,125
[screams]

183
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,458
[growls]

184
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:57,041
Stop playing around with
people's bodies, would ya?

185
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,500
I'm not sure why,

186
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,916
but you're definitely the
most fun to mess with, Lucy.

187
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,291
Ain't she?

188
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,458
We don't have time to be
playing these foolish games.

189
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:06,916
[gasps]

190
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,458
Whoa, you feel that?

191
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,333
Magic power.

192
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,250
There's no mistaking him.

193
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,333
Wait. You can't be serious.

194
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,166
He's this strong?

195
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,583
That's why he's called
the Wizard King.

196
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:26,916
I'm fired up now!

197
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,041
Natsu, we're here to talk, okay?

198
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,125
I've got a bad feeling
about this guy.

199
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,291
[COBRA groans]

200
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,916
[COBRA]
Have we stopped movin' yet?

201
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,041
'Cause I still feel
like I'm gonna hurl.

202
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:43,333
You'll feel better soon. It just
might take a moment or two.

203
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:46,000
However, in the meantime,
I think we should start flexing

204
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,291
the Olympia's muscle
a little bit.

205
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:53,083
Mobile temple Olympia,
main cannon, engage! 'Kay?

206
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:02,291
[SOLDIERS screaming]

207
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,916
Be careful! They're
firing cannons!

208
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,708
Hang on! Looks like they're
targeting the invaders!

209
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:12,166
Does that mean it's
on our side? Awesome!

210
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,875
[WIZARD O] We've got some
serious backup now, guys!

211
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,791
[WIZARD P]
Yeah! But who is it?

212
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,166
Is something the matter?

213
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,750
You're not injured, are you?

214
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:29,041
Yukino, you can leave
the front line if need be.

215
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,833
[YUKINO]
No, it's nothing.

216
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:34,125
I'm sorry. I'll be okay.

217
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:37,875
[YUKINO] For some reason,
I've got this strange sensation.

218
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:47,041
Our fourth guest will
be arriving any moment.

219
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:50,541
We need to be prepared for them.

220
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,833
Seems his Majesty's little
strategy game has ended.

221
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,208
A more straightforward attack

222
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,958
would've already resulted
in victory, I'm sure.

223
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,541
But now, the game board
has been broken

224
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:04,291
by someone who doesn't
play by the rules.

225
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:10,166
Acnologia and his
wings of darkness.

226
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,083
A black dragon
coming to the spot

227
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,291
where the white
maiden prevailed.

228
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:17,041
As if seeking revenge.

229
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:20,166
But I know the last laugh
will belong to me.

230
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,541
The scarlet maiden.

231
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:27,375
After all, I'm known in some
places as the "Scarlet Despair."

232
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:30,166
There must be a more
charming name than that.

233
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,875
[IRENE chuckles]

234
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:40,166
My bane particles spell doom
for any wizard who inhales them.

235
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,125
Soon, you'll feel the sensation
of your organs liquefying.

236
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,291
Yeah, I don't think so,

237
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,291
'cause my lungs
are made of iron!

238
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,125
Excellent news.

239
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,791
It's been too long

240
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:55,000
since I've faced a truly
challenging opponent!

241
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,291
Iron Dragon Spear!

242
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,583
My body is made
of Bane Particles,

243
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,416
so touching me will
seal your doom.

244
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,833
I am a god of death! Dragging
all I face into the underworld!

245
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:15,333
[GAJEEL screaming]

246
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,833
Perhaps you can survive this.

247
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,375
But what about those
without your gifts?

248
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,958
Everyone get away, right now!

249
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,750
Don't come near him!

250
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:32,541
[BLOODMAN] My legion of the
dead will consume your soul!

251
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:36,375
All these bones. Ah, damn it!

252
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:40,083
[LEVY]
Solid Script Shine!

253
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:43,083
Some type of light? Holy magic?

254
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,000
[GAJEEL]
What the--?

255
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,791
[LEVY]
I'm not gonna leave you!

256
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:49,416
Levy! You gotta go!

257
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,333
Uh! Good thinkin'.

258
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,541
I don't wanna hear
you say things

259
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,125
like you're lookin'
for a place to die.

260
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,291
Uh, that was just fight talk.

261
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,875
I was trying to sound
cool and intimidating.

262
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,458
What's that look?
I didn't mean it!

263
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,208
This is serious.

264
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,500
Your life is important to me.

265
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,541
You can't die.
So watch what you say.

266
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,166
Those who oppose me
cannot escape death.

267
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,291
I'll drag your souls
through the gates of hell.

268
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,125
For I am death.

269
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:23,666
And this promise of life
you cling to will be broken

270
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,875
without any mercy.

271
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,375
Now what is this?

272
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:38,750
The magic energy of the
very land has changed.

273
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:42,708
Irene. Just what are
you planning to do?

274
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:03,083
[AUGUST] Tell me. What
is the meaning of this?

275
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:06,166
[BRANDISH] I've come here
to negotiate with you.

276
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,708
I assume the enemies
killed Jacob?

277
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,375
[BRANDISH]
He's been defeated.

278
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:14,791
However, instead of killing him,
they've taken him prisoner.

279
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:18,416
God Serena, where has he gone?

280
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,000
He's confined to our memory.

281
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,541
I thought Brandish's
magic power was crazy,

282
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,625
but August is on a
whole other level.

283
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,500
[NATSU growls]

284
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,250
It's like night and day.

285
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,958
[MEST] I think they're putting
that extremely lightly.

286
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:37,208
I mean, the power coming from
him is not even of this world.

287
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:41,500
[AUGUST] So then, what do
you mean by "negotiate"?

288
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,666
[BRANDISH]
I'd like you to walk away.

289
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,125
[AUGUST]
Hmm.

290
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:48,041
It doesn't appear to me
that you've been tortured,

291
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,125
which leads me to wonder...

292
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,708
What's brought about this
betrayal of our homeland?

293
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,958
I'm not betraying anyone.

294
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,333
I'm still devoted to Alvarez.

295
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:02,291
However, I feel like there's
no meaning to this war.

296
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,583
[AUGUST] So you'd dare
act in direct opposition

297
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,250
to his Majesty's wishes.

298
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:09,416
We've pledged our lives
in service to the Emperor.

299
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,208
If you cannot comprehend why
His Majesty wages this war,

300
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,166
then you are among the enemy.

301
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,375
[GAJEEL]
Hey.

302
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,750
That mask you made for yourself,
you positive it's gonna work?

303
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:40,958
It's Solid Script magic,
so of course I'm positive.

304
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,458
[BLOODMAN]
When the first seal is broken,

305
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,250
Bane Particles drain
your magic power.

306
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,500
The second opens a gate
to the underworld

307
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,666
beneath this field of corpses.

308
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,583
Upon breaking the third seal,

309
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:57,000
the god of death renders
judgment upon you.

310
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,250
And when that happens,

311
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:01,916
you are condemned down
to the land of the dead.

312
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,875
I get that you're
tryin' to be scary,

313
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,250
but your magic power is a joke.

314
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,708
You got nothin' on the
rest of the Twelve, do ya?

315
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:12,666
That's because I wield
the power of curses.

316
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,375
So does that mean
what I think it does?

317
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,458
I control what rises from
the depths of Tartaros.

318
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,583
Curse Power... Explosion Spiral!

319
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:22,500
[LEVY screaming]

320
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,416
[GAJEEL screaming]

321
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:29,166
Tenka Goken! Onimaru!

322
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:36,041
[roars]

323
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:41,000
[BLOODMAN]
Unleash, Dark Deluge!

324
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,500
Are you kiddin' me?!

325
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,041
This again?

326
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:08,875
[GAJEEL] Aw, man, can he use
all the Tartaros curses?

327
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,166
[LEVY]
Maybe.

328
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,916
But I'm not falling for
the same trick twice!

329
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,583
Solid Script Hole!

330
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,041
Nice one, Levy!

331
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,208
[GAJEEL]
Iron Dragon Roar!

332
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:30,666
[BLOODMAN]
Ice Demon Rage!

333
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:41,125
[BLOODMAN] Behold, a curse
beyond the Nine Demons.

334
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,750
To the underworld.
To the underworld.

335
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,333
The dead begin to scurry.

336
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,666
Damn it!

337
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,750
The third seal breaks
as judgment is rendered.

338
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:01,666
[BLOODMAN]
Over Skelter!

339
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,291
[GAJEEL screaming]

340
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,708
[LEVY screaming]

341
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,500
Levy!

342
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:20,875
My death vortex... How
could they have escaped it?

343
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:28,625
[coughing]

344
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:31,666
[gasps] Oh, no! Your mask!

345
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,041
You gotta get it back on, now!

346
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,666
[LEVY]
I'm sorry. I was bluffing.

347
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,666
The truth is... it never worked

348
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,916
[gasps]

349
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,958
[LEVY] Bane Particles
don't just get inhaled,

350
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,750
they're absorbed
through the skin, too.

351
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,333
I guess I never had
a chance, huh?

352
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,333
Then why in the hell
did you even come here?!

353
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,125
I hoped I could save you...

354
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,666
[gasps] Levy!

355
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,125
[LUCY] As Levy succumbs
to the poisonous cloud

356
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:43,625
of Bloodman's Bane Particles,
Gajeel has to risk everything

357
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:47,333
to beat the god of death
and save her life.

358
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:50,291
He struggles against this
powerful, curse-wielding foe

359
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:53,291
in a battle which could
very well be his last.

360
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,125
With his iron fists swinging,

361
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:58,041
he fights to protect
everything dear to him.

362
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:01,125
Next Time: "Together, Always."

363
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,666
Gajeel holds tightly to
the dream of a future

364
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,666
filled with happiness.
