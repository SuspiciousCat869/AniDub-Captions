1
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:27,666
[NATSU] It's been a long
time comin' friend.

2
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,041
I'm about to finish you off,
once and for all.

3
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,458
Once you were my friend.

4
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:34,291
But this is war, and war
has no place for mercy.

5
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:38,083
Ha! Ya got a big mouth
for such a little cat.

6
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:40,208
Come on then.

7
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,583
We're finally gonna find
out which one's stronger.

8
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:43,708
I'll end you.

10
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:47,833
Yah!

11
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:50,208
[NATSU, HAPPY grunting]

[NATSU grunting]

18
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,458
[LUCY] Cut it out!
We're on a job ya idiots!

19
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:05,916
[NATSU]
What's with you?

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,250
[HAPPY] You really shouldn't
shout on a snowy mountain,

21
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,041
Lucy, you might start an a...

22
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,125
--[rumbling]
--[HAPPY] ...valanche

23
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:12,166
[LUCY yells]

24
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,666
Hey. Gimme a tug?
I'm kinda stuck.

25
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,583
Uh... Cold in all
the worst places.

26
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:20,250
Since I have your attention,
let's set something straight:

27
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,625
We're here to work!

28
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:23,875
But keepin' this uppity cat
in check is work, Lucy.

29
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:27,500
[HAPPY] She's got us between the
snow and a cold place, Natsu.

30
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,500
You bet your frozen butts I do.

31
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:31,708
Now you kids make peace
so we can get that ice

32
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:32,875
from Mt. Hakobe.

33
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:34,208
Whelp. Looks like
you've bought yourself

34
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,625
a little more time, Happy.

35
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:38,250
I'll just have to strip
you of your pride later.

36
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,000
[NATSU, HAPPY cackle]

37
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,333
Do you want out of there or not?

38
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,125
[NATSU, HAPPY]
Yes, ma'am!

39
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,208
[LUCY]
The name's Lucy Heartfilia.

40
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,000
My derpy companions?
They're Happy and Natsu.

41
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:26,250
The three of us have come
to Mt. Hakobe on a mission.

42
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,166
Our objective is a strange one.

43
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,416
We've been charged
to obtain some ice.

44
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,833
Magical Hakobe ice, named after
the only mountain in the world

45
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,000
on which it's
rumored to be found.

46
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,916
The job is for an
ice-manufacturer.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,750
It's a kind that they
can't make themselves,

48
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:43,083
which makes sense, as Hakobe
ice is said to be unmeltable.

49
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,875
It's also so hard and so strong

50
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,000
that no ordinary
blade can scratch it.

51
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,875
That would make it
pretty tough to harvest.

52
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,958
But our client gave
us a magical pen,

53
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,333
designed for the sole
purpose of cutting it.

54
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,916
Why do you guys think
that people want this

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,583
Hakobe ice stuff
so badly anyway?

56
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,416
I've heard that if it's
applied to the skin,

57
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,458
it'll beautify the
wearer's complexion.

58
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,083
Throw it into a recipe,
and you'll come out

59
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,833
with a culinary masterpiece.

60
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,916
On top of that, the stuff's
an energy booster

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,083
that can cure minor illnesses.
Least that's the rumor.

62
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,750
The guys that hired
us must wanna make

63
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,000
some magic popsicles!

64
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,166
[LUCY] Somethin' tells me
this'll be a pain.

65
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,416
Wish we'd brought Gray and Erza.

66
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,083
[NATSU]
Well, It's too late for that.

67
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,500
They're probably out workin'
on their own jobs by now.

68
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,083
[HAPPY] Relax, all we gotta do
is nab some ice, right?

69
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,791
How hard can it be?

70
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,333
Good point, Happy.

71
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,166
The three of us have handled
way tougher jobs than this one.

72
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,625
That's the spirit!

73
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,791
By the way, I brought some
fish to eat, check 'em out!

74
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,750
Tadah! Travel snacks
of champions!

75
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,750
Whoa, so fresh
they're still wigglin'!

76
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,833
And since we've got
a fire wizard with us,

77
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,291
we can cook 'em any time!

78
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,833
Hey. Do what ya want with
yours but I'ma eat mine raw

79
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:47,125
Ah! It's getting way
too cold out here!

80
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,583
Oh yeah, that's all
kinds'a better.

81
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,375
My chest is not your personal
igloo. Get outta there!

82
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,708
[rumbling]

83
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,375
What's happening?

84
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,000
[LUCY]
Uh-oh. That looks bad.

85
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,333
[HAPPY]
You don't say!

86
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:02,541
That could'a been us.
Let's move!

87
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:06,166
[HAPPY, LUCY, NATSU scream]

--[LUCY] Everything is spinning!

00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,833

Have we stopped yet?

You okay, Lucy?

93
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,000
[NATSU]
C'mon! Wake up!

94
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,125
And she got onto us
for not workin'!

95
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,500
You've left me with
no other choice!

96
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,291
Coochie, coochie, coochie, coo!
Coochie, coochie, coo!

97
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,250
[LUCY laughing] Please stop! I
can't take it. I'm begging you!

98
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,333
Uh, guys? What just happened?

99
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,958
Your shouting started
an avalanche,

100
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,708
and it knocked us
into this ravine.

101
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,375
On top of that, it feels
like this blizzard's

102
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,291
pickin' up strength,
so if we wanna get back,

103
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,583
we'd better hurry up.

104
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,541
Yeah, I agree, but I
really hate the idea

105
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,958
of tryin' to climb that cliff.

106
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,958
[HAPPY] That's cause climbin's
for monkeys and chumps!

107
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,291
I can fly you two back
up there lickety-split!

108
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,416
Sometimes I forget
how useful you are.

109
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,750
Yeah, well maybe I'll forget
to come back for ya!

110
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:10,750
Here we go!

111
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,958
--[HAPPY] Whoa!
--[LUCY yelps]

112
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,625
You sure you can fly in this?

113
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,375
[HAPPY] It's like my
wings are in a blender!

114
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:20,500
[LUCY, HAPPY yell]

115
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:24,125
[NATSU] Whoa, That crash-landing
looked frickin' awesome.

116
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,000
I want a turn! Let me try!

117
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,375
[LUCY, HAPPY]
This isn't a game, Natsu.

118
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,166
I nearly frickin' died!

119
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:34,250
[LUCY, HAPPY]
Such... bitter... cold...

120
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,750
[NATSU]
So, where are we now?

121
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:36,958
Have we caught up yet?

122
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,875
Probably not,
since we lost our map

123
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,208
in that stupid avalanche.

124
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,125
[HAPPY]
You're doin' real good, Lucy.

125
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,833
I'm gonna go look for that
map in my dreams, okay?

126
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,541
Heck no! That's not okay!

127
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,250
C'mon, you. Wake up!

128
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,000
If you fall asleep in this
blizzard, then you'll freeze

129
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,625
and you'll never wake up
and we'll get stranded here

130
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,291
and have to eat you.
Is that what you want?

131
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,875
Hey, do you think you
could you do somethin'

132
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,250
about this blizzard with your
fire so she'll stop shoutin'?

133
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,916
I can't sleep.

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,583
Guess it's worth a shot.

135
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:05,708
Fire Dragon... Roar!

136
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,500
[HAPPY yelling]

137

138
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,083
[HAPPY gasps, yelps]

139
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,916
[HAPPY] So hot!
The cold hurts just as much!

140
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,041
No, I take that back!
Freezin's way better!

141
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,041
Natsu is freakishly
strong, but I guess

142
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,291
a full-scale blizzard's more
than anyone can stop.

143
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,166
Well, ya know,
I bet Wendy's magic

144
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,916
would've had a better
chance than mine did.

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,083
And now that you mention it,

146
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,083
Gray's magic would've
been helpful too.

147
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,500
Here's an idea:
why don't'cha call up

148
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:36,833
one of your celestial spirits?

149
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,833
[LUCY] I normally would,
but I just sent them all

150
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,083
on vacation, so I
really can't right now.

151
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,791
I know they forgot
about the Liberam,

152
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:43,875
but I doubt that the stress

153
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,250
of it went the way
of those memories.

154
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,208
Those guys are in
serious need of a break.

155
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,708
[HAPPY]
All of 'em?

156
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,625
In that case, I guess we really
are on our own, aren't we?

157
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,791
This job sounded so
simple in the flyer.

158
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,625
Honestly, it didn't even occur
to me that we'd need their help.

159
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:56,875
It's all comin' back to me now.

160
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,625
We were fine until
one of you two said

161
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,125
"how hard can it be?"
and jinxed us!

162
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,583
It was you who said that.
We both heard you!

163
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,250
[LUCY] So, question.
Are you two as lost as I am?

164
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,125
[HAPPY]
Sure am. What do we do?

165
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,791
If we could tell
which way was south,

166
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,166
I'd say head that way.

167
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,708
But as things stand,
we just have to keep moving

168
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,541
so we don't freeze

169
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,791
[gasps] Look! Over there!

170
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,166
[HAPPY]
Wow! A cave!

171
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,708
Guess we beat the jinx!

172
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,291
That cave'll trump
a five star hotel

173
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,666
if it can get me
outta this blizzard.

174
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,875
Let's find out what it's
like in there! Natsu, mush!

175
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,125
[LUCY giggles]

176
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:38,291
--[HAPPY, LUCY gasp]
--[NATSU] Oh, ho-ho-ho!

177
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,916
Looks like it
goes pretty deep.

178
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,291
Let's take a look. We've got
plenty 'a time, right?

179
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,208
Maybe we should just
hang near the entrance.

180
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,041
because if this place is as big
as it seems, we might get lost.

181
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,833
It'll only be a
quick peek though.

182
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,708
Live a little, will ya?

183
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,708
Where do you boys get
all of this energy?

184
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,708
This cavern's even
deeper than it looks.

185
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,208
[HAPPY] How long d'ya
think it goes for?

186
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,333
Dunno, but I've been
lost enough for one day.

187
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,875
Let's head back while
we still know how.

188
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,500
[NATSU] No need to remember
how to get back.

189
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,625
I can still smell the
entrance, no problem.

190
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:14,916
[LUCY]
That's good to know and all.

191
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,041
But there's still
something about this place.

192
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,083
It's weirding me out.

193
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,708
[NATSU gasps, sniffs]

194
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,958
What's up, didja smell
somethin' tasty?

195
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,666
Nope, somethin weird though.

196
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,416
The air current
changed outta nowhere.

197
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,958
So, that's not normal?
What kinda shift was it?

198
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,375
To be honest,
I can't really tell ya.

199
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,625
[gasps] Get outta the way!

200
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,333

Ah! More of 'em inbound.
Look sharp!

[NATSU]
Fire Dragon Roar!

205
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,416
[NATSU] There's no end
to these things! Let's go!

206
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,416
[LUCY, HAPPY yelp]

207
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,458
[NATSU] What in the heck
is up with this cave?

208
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,125
[LUCY] I said this place was
super-weird, but did you listen?

209
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:03,708
No!

210
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:04,583
[NATSU]
Whoa!

211
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:12,500
[LUCY, HAPPY, NATSU scream]

[LUCY screams]

215
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,833
So It's kinda awkward timing,
but I just remembered something!

216
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,250
[LUCY]
Oh yeah, what?

217
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,541
Right before we left
the guild, I talked to Levy!

218
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,375
She told me that she'd
read some stories about

219
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,166
this living cave that
moves around way deep

220
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,625
in the heart of Mt. Hakobe!

221
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,416
She read that no one
who's been lost down there

222
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,666
has ever made it out!

223
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,250
Thanks for letting us
know that we're screwed!

224
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,708
That would've been super
useful like three hours ago!

225
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,875
[LUCY, NATSU, HAPPY yell]

226
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,000
Well, we finally hit
the end of the line.

227
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,375
[HAPPY whimpers]
Sure is a lot colder down here.

228
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,541
It's every bit as bad as
it was in that blizzard,

229
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:59,291
so let's walk around
before we start to freeze.

230
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,083
[HAPPY] We've gotta find
that exit. Somehow...

231
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,083
[LUCY] Natsu, which way's
the exit? Are we there yet?

232
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,666
At this point, I'm clueless.
Can't even catch a whiff.

233
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,708
No.

234
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,541
 I'm sorry guys, but that was
the last step I had in me.

235
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,958
Next time, let's just crawl.

236
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:33,416
So, hungry. I'll never
skip breakfast again.

237
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,166
I'm glad you're down
here with us, Natsu.

238
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,166
If you were anybody else then
we'd be stuck in the cold.

239
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,958
I'm sure that we've been
here for days, but how many?

240
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,208
Well.

241
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,791
I'd guess three days,
but it may well be four.

242
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,250
[HAPPY] Would we even know if
we were goin' the wrong way?

243
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,041
How could we?

244
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,458
[LUCY]
We couldn't.

245
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,416
That's why it feels like we've
been walking in circles.

I know we're trying
to make it last, but...

249
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,208
We've gotta eat sometime, right?

250
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,250
I guess so.

251
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,583
[HAPPY] Aw. I used to think
I'd always have fish.

252
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,583
This'll be the last
meal we get here,

253
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,583
so let's make the most of it.

254

I hear ya, Lucy.

255
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,375
I'm gonna roast
these fish with flair!

256
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,791
Please don't cook the left fish,
I wanna eat it raw.

Tell me that it's
just a bad dream!

Well, maybe they're still
good on the inside.

How could they be?

263

They're ashes now, you monster.

264
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:40,166
I told you that
they're better raw!

265
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,666

our last meal count.

Do you think that maybe
somebody'll come lookin' for us?

271

Well If they do,
they'll have to get past

a mountain blizzard
and a shifting cave maze.

Would ya please stop
talkin' bout food.

It's cold in here. I need heat!

you fall asleep, we die!

Oww! That frickin' hurt!

All right, I'm fired up!
Get off my back will ya?

288
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,958
So this is what happens
to people after three days

289
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,875
without getting any sleep.

290
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,916
It's like I'm a zombie.
There's a term for this feel.

291
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
They call it the
"breaking point."

292
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,625
All I want is to lay
down in an actual bed.

Forget the reward,
I'd pay every jewel

I have if it meant
I could sleep.

aren't makin' any fires,

so why can't we go to sleep?

297
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,083
Wow, when you put it like that.

298
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:10,625
there's nothing I can say,
you're just so persuasive.

299
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:13,666
No one's objecting?
'Kay, night, night.

300

Don't do this, guys.
It isn't any fair.

301
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:21,041
No sleeping allowed,
and don't you forget.

302

this together after all.

310
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,041
it means they have to stay open.

311

[HAPPY]
I'd be scared of starvin'

312
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,416
if I weren't gonna freeze.

313
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,833
Well, If you do freeze,
I won't let Lucy eat you.

314
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,916
Ha... That was just a joke.
Well, not really, but you know.

[LUCY]
Thank you all so very much!

317
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,333
I can't begin to express
what an honor it is

318
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,500
to hold the Leaf-pen
trophy in my hands.

319
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,166
Since my first book did so well,

320
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,041
I plan to work even harder,
as writer and a--

321

[LUCY]
No. It can't be.

322
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,708
My award's a giant bathtub?

323
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,500
That's incredible! I've worked
so long for this moment!

324
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,291
Did I really though?
Well yeah, sure I did, look.

325
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,125
They don't give you
a hot tub like that

326
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:31,291
unless ya work for it, do they?

327
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,458
Showers are nice and all.

328
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:36,708
but nothing beats a
good ol' fashioned bath.

329
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,375
Ha... Mm...

330
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:52,416
[NATSU] I'm all...
fired up. Lots of fire.

331
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,583
Hey.

332
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,000
Check it out, a spicy treat!

333
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:11,041
This fire's a little bit
on the chilly side.

334
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:14,958
Like a minty sherbet,
wonder what it's burning off of.

335
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:15,916
Boy, I'll tell ya.

336
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,791

00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,625
[NATSU] It really does
taste like someone

345
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,083
set a mint sherbert on fire!

346
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,583
Oh yeah, this is
the life, just me,

347
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,500
my blissfully hot bathtub
and the distant glow of--

Why am I naked?

Keep it down, or else!

355
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:02,833
I was tryin' to have a meal!
Now it's ruined!

Anyone get crushed by rubble?

362
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,666
I think I'm alive.

363
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,166
Yeah, I'll start
a flame and give--

364
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,916
Don't you make a single spark
until I've gotten dressed!

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,083
[NATSU, HAPPY groan]

366
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,416
Okay, yeah! I'm good to go!

367
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,625
[NATSU sniffs]
Whoa! Now that is a smell.

368
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,625
[LUCY] I'm cold, hungry,
tired, and a little crazy,

369
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,625
but I know that tunnel is new.

370
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,416
Surface air. No doubt about it.

371
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,833
Well sniffed!

372
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,333
So this thing might become
our ticket outta here, eh?

373
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,375
It's worth checkin' out!

374
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:59,916
Well, that's weird.
It's a massive wall of ice.

375
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,333
[NATSU] I see an exit,
but it's on the other side.

376
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,125
Go on then! You know
what to do, man!

377
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,750
Thanks for the pep talk!

00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,750
Amazing. Not even a scratch.

380
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,708
C'mon Natsu, one more go!

381
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:20,916
Fire Dragon... Crushing Fang!

382
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,708
It's useless.

383
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,000
I haven't eaten anything
but ice in days.

384
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,166
That's a decent excuse,
but it's still weird

385
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,916
that it wasn't damaged at all.

386
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,125
Natsu might feel weak
by his own standards,

387
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,750
but that should've
done something. Unless...

388
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:39,291
Guys, I think that wall's
made of Hakobe ice!

[NATSU, HAPPY]
Huh?

390
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:45,666
Which means that we can bust out
with nothin' but this magic pen.

391
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh! Yeah, I think you're right.

392
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,416
About the pen or the wall?

393
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,000
They're kinda related, Natsu.

394
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:54,000
But It's only been four days,
so of course you forgot.

take this with us.

we can't get paid without it.

a little bit,

468
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,750
I feel like I'm
on top of the world!

469
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,791
[LUCY, HAPPY giggle]

470
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,041
[NATSU]
All right.

471
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,500
I guess we'd better head
back to the guild-hall.

472
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:13,916
[HAPPY] If we're fast,
we might make it in time

473
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,458
for Mira's home-cooked dinner!

474
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,666
[LUCY] Never thought I'd be
this excited to get some sleep.

475
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,875
Oh. Hey, wait. We can't
go back to the guild until

476
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:21,666
we've delivered that ice.

477
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,750
Uh-- Hey, Natsu?

478
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,500
You ate that whole slab
of Hakobe Ice, so uh...

479
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:27,875
[NATSU, HAPPY gasp]

480
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:30,583
[HAPPY, NATSU, LUCY]
We've gotta go back in there?

481
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,541
[groans]

482
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:33,833
[groans]

483
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,458
[groans]

484
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:41,250
[ALL laugh]

485
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:15,208
[HAPPY]
And... transform!

486
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:16,708
[NATSU]
What are you shoutin' about?

487
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,375
[HAPPY] I'm practicin' that
awesome transformation spell

488
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,583
we learned from Mira!

489
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,125
[NATSU] Sweet, can you
turn into anything?

490
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:23,375
[HAPPY] Probably. What would
you wanna turn into?

491
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,500
[NATSU]
Hmm. How about a giant monster?

492
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:27,791
[HAPPY]
A monster. Really, why?

493
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,583
[NATSU] Because I wanna
go on a crazy rampage

494
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,083
and crush some buildings.

495
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:33,625
[HAPPY] Yeah, but. That's
exactly what you do right now!

496
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,625
[NATSU, HAPPY]
Next time: Transform!

497
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,458
[HAPPY] Think I'd wanna
be a killer whale.

498
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:39,416
I'd get to eat
fish all the time!

499
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,708
[NATSU] You already do
that all the time!
