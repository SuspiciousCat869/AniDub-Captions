00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:24,833
Lucky for you,

3
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:28,125
that five-minute countdown'll
take longer than your death.

[screaming]

5
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:33,666
Unhand Wendy, you monster!
Take this! And this too!

6
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,083
I'm sorry, Carla.

7
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,166
I'll scratch your
eyes out, let her go!

8
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,708
Carla. You have to run.

9
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,958
Let her go! Take me instead!

10
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,875
[CARLA]
Come on then!

11
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,416
Don't hurt Carla!
Please, put her down!

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,541
That's a weird lookin' cat.
Still, it looks edible.

13
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:54,166
Stop! Don't do this,
I'm begging you!

14
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:59,291
[WENDY]
No!

15
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,875
Wendy... the air.

16
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:02,916
[gasps]

17
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:08,000
[WENDY] This wonderful air.
That breath I took.

18
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:11,708
Face is permeated with
high-density ether-nano.

19
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:12,916
There's so much of the stuff

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,916
that the air around
Face is swathed in it.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,375
If I could ingest
it like Natsu did.

22
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,833
If I could just...
breathe it in.

23
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:23,750
It might make me strong
enough to save Carla.

Whoa! What was that?

27
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:42,416
[CARLA] Wendy used to
seem so weak and timid.

28
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,083
I thought I'd always
have to protect her.

29
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:49,625
I was wrong. She got
stronger every day.

30
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:52,166
And now she has
the Dragon Force.

31
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,833
[CARLA]
She has the Dragon Force.

32
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,416
Where did this power come from?

33
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,500
[WENDY]
I hear the voice of the wind.

34
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:15,666
I feel the pulse of
the sky in my veins.

35
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,791
For as long as this lasts.

[grunts]

00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,291
Where'd she go?

You little brat!

00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,416
Incredible!

42
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,500
This might be fun after all!

[CARLA] We're running
out of time, Wendy.

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,208
You have to hurry!

53
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:45,625
I know, Carla.
I'm ending this right now!

54
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,208
Watch me!

55
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,625
What?

56
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,625
She has me surrounded. Damn it!

[EZEL]
Activate Cutting mode!

[EZEL] Now these curse
blades are even sharper.

68
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,000
Nothing'll save you now!

69
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,458
We have less than
four minutes left!

[laughing]

71
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,916

[snarls]

73
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,500

Nothing can stop me!

75
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,083
[EZEL]
Someone's a slow learner.

76
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,750
My blades can cut through
your air, remember?

77
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,000
[WENDY]
But I need more.

78
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,541
I need to gather as
much wind as I can!

79
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:10,375
My swords! I can't
even swing them.

80
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:14,833
There's too much wind. It's
all I can do just to stand!

81
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,166
[WENDY] Even if it's
just a fraction, please,

82
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,083
grant me some of
Natsu's strength!

[WENDY]
Help me fight!

00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:42,750
[EZEL screaming]

87
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,625
I really did it.

88
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,750
No, why?

89
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,833
[CARLA]
Wendy destroyed Face.

90
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,625
So why is the
countdown still going?

91
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,875
No. I can't even move.

92
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:51,291
I guess... everything
I had wasn't enough.

93
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,791
[FRANMALTH laughing]

94
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,541
I still don't understand
how he was able

95
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,458
to absorb Natsu's
lightning flames.

96
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:11,416
How can we beat him if our
attacks make him stronger?

97
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,750
Hit me with your best shot.
I can promise you ahead of time,

98
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:17,458
it won't be good enough.
Every spell has a soul,

99
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,875
and every soul can be devoured.

100
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,833
If that's right, then I'll
just have to blast ya

101
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,416
with more than you can stomach.

102
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,541
What a theory! Come test it!

103
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,708
You'll be the river man
and I'll be the reaper,

104
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,500
but-but I am also still Hades.

105
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,916
Yeah, I feel like that
metaphor kinda fell apart

106
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,083
at the end there.

107
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,083
I guess I used to respect Hades.

108
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,333
Didn't notice till
I stopped just now.

109
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,250
What's goin' on?

110

[LUCY, HAPPY yelp]

111
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,750
[FRANMALTH] That's the Cube's
way of saying you're beaten.

112
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,458
Our work has paid off.

113
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,833
We're about to bring the
age of magic to an end!

[HAPPY yelps]

118

This is freaking me out.

119
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:32,916
The Cube's reacting
to Face's rising power.

120
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,583
Damn it.

121
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,125
[FRANMALTH]
If you still want to attack me,

122
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,583
you'd better do it soon.

123
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:41,166
This continent will be free
of magic in three minutes!

124
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,875
We're down to three minutes?

125
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,250
Ya gotta beat him
up quick, Natsu!

126
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:48,208
[FRANMALTH] How much is a
wizard worth without his magic?

127
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,750
I'd say nothing!

129
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:57,083
[KEYES] So you're a practitioner
of Ice Magic, are you?

130
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,916
Very intriguing.

131
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,458
That's a new one.

132
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,583
If my attacks "intrigue" you,
they aren't doin' their job.

133
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,208
[KEYES]
How tragic truth can be.

134
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,625
What was that?

135
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,208
Stop talkin' in riddles, man,
just say what you mean!

136
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,208
Why's it feel like your
Cube's about to sink?

137
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:18,291
[KEYES]
Because the end is nigh for you.

138
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:25,625
So this is how
a true demon fights.

139
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:29,125
[LISANNA] They look pretty
evenly matched from this angle.

140
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,375
[LISANNA yelps]

141
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,000
War isn't a spectator
sport, girlie.

[LUMMY laughing]

143
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,166
Have I met you before?

144
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,083
Nope, but between
that pretty face

145
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,708
and those ridiculous cat
ears, I hate you already.

146
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,041
[LISANNA gasps]

147
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,083
[ERZA yells]

148
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,208
The beginning of the end.

149
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:53,291
Man shall rule
this world no more.

150
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,958
Oh, perfect.

151
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,375
So then I'm to understand

152
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:59,166
that the enemy has Porlyusica
and the rest surrounded?

153
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,875
[GUILD MEMBER A] This is bad.
There's nowhere left to run!

154
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,500
[GUILD MEMBER B] Stand your
ground! Protect the wounded!

155
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,666
[MAKAROV] Very well, I'll
leave our offensive to you.

156
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,666
Make sure you don't
forget to take a sample

157
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,166
from the one with
those Bane Particles.

158
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,291
I'll go and give
Porlyusica some backup.

159
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,875
[MAKAROV]
I drastically underestimated

160
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,166
the enemy's numbers.

161
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,708
If Face were to detonate now,

162
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:23,375
we'd lose any chance
of victory we had.

163
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,958
[LUCY]
C'mon, Wendy.

164
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,458
[WENDY]
I couldn't save anyone.

165
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,333
[WENDY]
Carla, I... I'm so sorry.

166
00:12:57,166 --> 00:13:00,291
[CARLA] I think...
there might still be a way.

167
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,458
[CARLA] What's left of
Face draws its energy

168
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,958
from the same ether-nano
that empowered you.

169
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,666
If we could slightly
change the way

170
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,083
that ether-nano was processed,

171
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:22,416
we could detonate Face's entire
fuel supply and destroy it.

172
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:27,583
Sounds like it could work,
but how do you know all this?

173
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,333
[CARLA]
I've done it.

174
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,750
[CARLA] I saw myself
do it in the future.

175
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,375
I had a premonition in
which Face didn't go off.

176
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:43,583
Well, actually, it was a bit
more challenging than that.

177
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,250
I looked through
many possible futures,

178
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,208
searching for times
when we succeeded.

179
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,041
But even with all
those possibilities,

180
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,875
I could only find one.

181
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,916
So the plan will work.

182
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,333
[CARLA]
In my premonition,

183
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,708
I was able to bring up
Face's ether-nano processes

184
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,041
from this control panel.

185
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:16,291
You always find a way.
I'm proud of you, Carla.

186
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,375
After that, I input
this override code.

187
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:40,708
[CARLA] Input accepted. The
ether-nano's combustible now.

188
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,750
That's wonderful!

189
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,625
Everything'll be okay then.

190
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,666
[CARLA]
No, not exactly.

191
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,833
[gasps]

192
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:53,833
This timeline is about
to go blank for me.

193
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,250
No future.

194
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,250
There's nothing to see.

195
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,500
What're you saying, Carla?

196
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:04,250
I can tell you with certainty,
this will stop Face.

197
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,000
And allow magic to endure.

198
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,541
[WENDY]
Then what's wrong?

199
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,708
[CARLA] When I touch that
button, Face will self destruct.

200
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:18,000
The explosion. We won't be
able to escape it in time.

201
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,708
[WENDY whimpers]

202
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,333
[CARLA]
I'm fond of magic,

203
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,083
but personally, I know
I could survive without it.

204
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,875
I think all of us could.

205
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,750
After all, we've already
done it back in Edolas.

206
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:41,208
We could survive,
but all of our friends.

207
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:44,291
They're in the middle
of a battle right now.

208
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,625
We can't let them lose their
magic at a time like this.

209
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,333
[CARLA]
Yes, you're right.

210
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,041
Now listen, Wendy.

211
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:56,916
I have no way of predicting how
large this explosion might be.

212
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,250
If you leave now, you
might make it far enough.

213
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,250
So go. I'll handle this.

214
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:05,875
How can you ask me to
do that?! I would never!

215
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,000
[CARLA]
Please go, Wendy.

216
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,875
Live. For me.

217
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,458
No, I won't! I'm not about to
leave you here to die alone!

218
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,375
[CARLA]
I don't want you to be here!

219
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,125
Leave so I can do this.

220
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,375
[WENDY]
No!

221
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:29,958
We'll be together forever.
You made me that promise.

222
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,166
Did you mean it?

223
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,166
I did mean it.

224
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:54,166
But I'm not strong enough
to fly right now.

225
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,166
There's no way for me to leave.

226
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,750
[WENDY]
Yeah, I know.

227
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:03,916
The same goes for me.
I can barely even crawl.

228
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I wouldn't make it
ten feet if I did leave.

229
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,875
[WENDY]
But I'm gonna stay.

230
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:37,916
Honestly, Carla, there are worse
ways for an adventure to end.

231
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
We got to save our friends.

232
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:43,333
And we were there for each other
through all the tough times.

233
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,500
[WENDY] All we have to
do is press it, right?

234
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,208
[CARLA]
Right.

235
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,041
Together then?

236
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,583
Yes. We'll be together forever.

237
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,416
[WENDY crying]

238
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
[CARLA]
Why are you crying this time?

239
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,625
'Cause I can't stop.

240
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,583
Would you try at least?

241
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,083
Well, maybe.

242
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,291
I could try to stop crying
if you promised be my friend.

243
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,666
But what's a friend?

244
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,833
A friend is someone
who you like, and--

245
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,541
And, um, well you--

246
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,458
I don't really know!

247
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,291
[chuckles]

248
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,916
Oh, good grief.

249
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:05,458
[WENDY] So we're friends
from now on, okay?

250
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:06,750
[CARLA]
Sure!

251
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,083
[WENDY laughs] I remember now!

252
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:12,333
Friends stay together,
forever and always!

253
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,416
[WENDY]
Um, hi, everyone.

254
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,333
I'm from the Cait Shelter Guild.
My name's Wendy Marvel.

255
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:34,500
And... it's very nice
to meet all of you.

256
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,000
Wendy Marvel?

257
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,791
What's with that tone,
d'ya know her or somethin'?

258
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,708
You said you're
from Cait Shelter?

259
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,458
Weird, I've never
heard of that guild.

260
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,291
I'm picking up a great deal
of magic power from her.

261
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,541
[HAPPY gasping]

262
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:48,708
[CARLA]
Hmph.

263
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,416
Hey there, Carla.
You followed me here?

264
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,958
Well of course I did!

265
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:56,083
You're far too young to be
traveling unaccompanied, child.

266
00:19:56,166 --> 00:20:00,208
And also, I recall you saying
that we'd be together forever.

267
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,250
[chuckles]

268
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:21,083
Carla, would you
be my friend again?

269
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,500
Of course I would.

270
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,750
Just in time.

271
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:19,875
Talk about reckless.

272
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:27,208
[DORANBOLT] So these are the
heroes who destroyed Face.

273
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,416
They're about the two
smallest warriors I've seen.

274
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,291
[LUCY] Wendy and Carla
successfully prevented Face

275
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:18,125
from detonating,
and that provided

276
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:21,000
a much needed morale boost
for the rest of the guild.

277
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:22,500
But even as we celebrate,

278
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:25,875
an enraged Tartaros
prepares to strike back.

279
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,500
Using the evil soul of Hades,

280
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:29,458
the demon Franmalth
hits us with attacks

281
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:33,083
both powerful and frightening,
in equal measure.

282
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:37,416
Next Time:
"Tartaros Chapter Hell's Core."

283
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,875
If you truly hold it dear,
never let it go.
