Punchin' walls, are ya?

165
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,916
Leave the town outta this,
your fight's with me.

166
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:48,833
[JACKAL]
I'm a demon.

167
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,916
The most perfect and
powerful creature there is.

168
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,750
Humans are like cockroaches
to my kind. Easy to kill!

169
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,416
You're a demon?

170
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,583
I hope I didn't hear that right.

171
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,791
You the only one, or is
your guild full of demons?

172
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:05,666
I'm done talkin'!
I came to spill some blood!

173
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,541
If that's the only thing
you're fightin' for,

174
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,125
then you never stood a chance!

175
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,625
[JACKAL roars]

176
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,750
[NATSU] 'Cause we're
fighting for our friends!

177
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:16,000
The ones your guild-mate
tried, and failed, to kill!

178
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,375
[JACKAL groans]

179
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,583
[NATSU] I don't care you're
a human, god, or demon.

180
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,375
You hurt my friends,
you pay the price!

181
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:25,833
This one's for Laxus,
and the Thunder Legion!

182
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:33,875
Lightning Flame Dragon.
Firing Hammer!

183
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:37,125
[JACKAL screams]

184
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,958
[NATSU panting]

185
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,541
Bad guy's down.
Town's destroyed.

186
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,000
I'd say our work here is done.

187
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,541
That's how we roll.

188
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,708
[WENDY, LUCY]
Uh?!

189
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,833
Natsu!

190
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:16,375
That explosion was huge. Even
for someone as tough as him.

191
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,000
[HAPPY]
What happened? You okay?

192
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:21,500
We managed to evacuate the
townspeople to a safe distance!

193
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,750
[HAPPY]
Uh... Natsu!

194
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,250
What did we miss?

195
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,000
Turns out Jackal was a demon.

196
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:30,041
Natsu managed to beat
him, but just barely.

197
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,500
[NATSU]
Yup. Kicked his butt.

198
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,125
We're very proud of you.

199
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,625
--[NATSU groans]
--Wore yourself out hittin' him?

200
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,250
He has quite a bit
to answer for.

201
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,250
[JACKAL laughs]

202
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,375
[WENDY, LUCY, HAPPY gasp]

203
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,791
Well. I'll be damned
if I saw this comin'.

204
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:49,791
Haven't taken a beating like
that since I was still a pup.

205
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,333
Guess it had to happen sometime.

206
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:55,541
Kyoka, forgive me.

207
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,833
[JACKAL] You're gonna have a
tough time bringin' me back.

208
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:05,916
But this is the only one way
to take these humans with me.

209
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,541
Guys? I don't like this.

210
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,000
Me neither.

211
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,416
He must be planning to
demolish the whole town.

212
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,541
[LUCY]
Stop! Please!

213
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:21,041
Even if I wanted to,
it's too late.

214
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:24,375
I'm not the kinda bomb
that you can just defuse.

215
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:28,083
This body is rigged to
blow, even if it dies.

216
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:35,458
[laughs] I'll see you in hell,
so don't miss me too much!

217
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:40,208
What do we do now? We're gonna
get caught up in the blast.

218
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,916
[HAPPY grunts]

219
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,541

Not if I can help it!

[screams]

221
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,583
Hey!

00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,458
Happy! No!

223
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:51,583
What're you...

00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,250
You stupid little cat!

225
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:56,583
Happy! Get away from him, now!

226
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,125
You can tell your
friends to stay in hell,

227
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,791
'cause you're
never gonna win!

228
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:06,375
[JACKAL]
I'll be back!

229
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:15,041
Happy!

230

[CARLA cries]

233
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,833
This can't be for real.

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,791
[CARLA cries]

235
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,791
[NATSU]
He can't be gone.

Nice hair.

240
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:12,166
I could really use a fish.

241
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,541
We're gettin' close to town.

242
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,708
Hope we're in time.

[JUVIA gasps]

244
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,500
Easy... What's the matter?

245
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,791
[creature growling]

246
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,083
I think she must be
frightened of something.

247
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,166
[GRAY]
Uh.

248
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,750
[GRAY]
Who knows what's waiting for us.

249
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,750
You've found Master Hogg?

250
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,083
[GRAY] We did, but Tartaros
found him first.

251
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:07,416
Just how late were we?
Has the culprit left?

252
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,791
[JUVIA]
Late enough, and yes,

253
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,625
the killer is gone
but, unfortunately,

254
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,750
not without a trace.

255
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:18,375
[GRAY] They destroyed half
the town on their way out.

256
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,875
Such horrific destruction.

257
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,875
How was your luck, Gajeel?

258
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,583
What's Master Belno's
current status?

259
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:33,875
[GAJEEL]
They murdered her, too.

260
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,625
The city's fine though, nothing
like what Gray described.

261
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:39,958
It would seem that this
killer is the stealthy type.

262
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:44,125
[GAJEEL] I failed.
I should've gotten here sooner.

263
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,125
We did our best.

264
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:49,583
They beat us to Master Hogg
and Master Belno, so,

265
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,500
that leaves us with
Master Michello,

266
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,083
who we assigned to Natsu's team.

267
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:58,250
And Master Yuri, who Elfman and
Lisanna have been searching for.

268
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,416
We didn't make it. Can't tell
how, but they got him.

269
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,750
What do we do now?

270
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,083
Get the communication
lacrima ready.

271
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,375
We need to report
this to the guild.

272
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,875
[LISANNA]
Right.

273
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,500
[ELFMAN] I don't understand it.
He's completely uninjured.

274
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,250
It's almost like
he died naturally.

275
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,541
[gasps]

276
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,000
[LISANNA]
Uh?!

277
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,916
Master Yuri, you're alive. I
checked your pulse, and...

278
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,416
[yelps]

279
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,166
What do you think you're doing?

280
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,583
That was our only way
of reaching the guild!

281
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,583
[LISANNA, ELFMAN]
Uh...

282
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,041
Uh. Did he just
die all over?

283
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,958
That was creepy.

284
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,875
[SEILAH] I did try to make
him look convincing,

285
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,791
but a corpse is a corpse.

286
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:57,916
[sighs]

287
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,666
Are you from Tartaros?

288
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,166
Tell us what you did
to Master Yuri, now!

289
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,791
The old man already had
one leg in the netherworld,

290
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,416
I merely helped him along.

291
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,916
And stayed to play
with his corpse?

292
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,416
These Fairy tales are quite
dull. They all end so happily.

293
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,708
About as entertaining
as watching blood dry.

294
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,500
What your kind needs
is a demon tale.

295
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,541
Lisanna. Are ya ready?

296
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,541
Yeah!

297
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,125
Uh... Uh!

298
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,791
Hey, what are you
doing, brother?

299
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,208
[LISANNA choking]

300
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:36,625
[ELFMAN] This isn't me.
I'm sorry, I-I can't control it!

301
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,166
Lisanna, no! Please,
hang in there!

302
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,375
Elfman, you have
to tell the guild.

303
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:46,500
[ELFMAN] Whatever you're doing
to me, stop! Stop it right now!

304
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:49,291
One thing I prefer
about demon's tales,

305
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:52,916
they don't contain irksome
words such as mercy.

306
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,541
It's working! Hey, gramps,
can you hear me?

307
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,000
[MAKAROV]
Lucy? What happened?

308
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,833
We'd've contacted you
sooner if we could,

309
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,166
but we ran into a little
trouble on the mission.

310
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,875
Have you located Michello?

311
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,791
[LUCY] Yeah, he's
safe and sound.

312
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,000
[ALL]
Ah!

313
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,166
Can't quite say the
same for Natsu though.

314
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,375
I'm the champ.

315
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,916
He beat a member of
Tartaros all by himself!

316
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,416
Victory!

317
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,041
And he's proud of it.

318
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,333
The town looks like a
hurricane's been through it.

319
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,666
You could say that
about my hair, too.

320
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,916
We need to know everything

321
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,166
you were able to find
out from Michello.

322
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,833
About that...

323
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:32,500
They seek The White Legacy.
They will use Face.

324
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:36,750
[MICHELLO whimpers] Believe me.
I know nothing, I swear!

325
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:39,666
I don't know anything,
I'm telling you!

326
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,333
What is this "Face"?

327
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,375
It's a weapon.

328
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:46,083
The most powerful
one the council has.

329
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,083
Probably the strongest
ever made.

330
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,375
[MAKAROV]
Mm.

331
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,750
[GRAY, JUVIA]
Uh.

332
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,000
[GAJEEL, LEVY]
Huh?!

333
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:53,916
[WENDY]
Uh...

334
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,166
[NATSU grunts]
What was it for?

335
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,583
Somethin' like that sounds
too strong to use.

336
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,708
I'm sure they thought they
needed one last ace in the hole.

337
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,458
Power breeds paranoia,
from what I've seen.

338
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,958
Now I for one would
love to hear more.

339
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:10,166
The council possesses
many such weapons.

340
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,166
Each subject to its own rules,

341
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,541
based on its potential
for misuse.

342
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,416
One example is the
Etherion Cannon.

343
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,083
[MICHELLO] Etherion is a
hyper-magical artillery piece,

344
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:24,708
capable of dropping its ordnance
at any target in the continent.

345
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,416
It has power enough to
turn an entire nation

346
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,125
into a smoking crater
with a single blast.

347
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,666
Thus it cannot be fired
without the approval of nine

348
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,041
Council members and the
input of ten security codes,

349
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:39,375
each possessed by a
different senior official.

350
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:45,625
Wait a sec... All of those
council members are dead now.

351
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,833
Then the council can't
activate Etherion,

352
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,375
till they get new leaders.

353
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,833
They may have killed current
members to shut it down,

354
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,958
and retirees to keep it down.

355
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:58,541
[MAKAROV] What exactly does
this "Face" of yours do?

356
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,666
I understand that this is a
secret, but no one's left

357
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,375
to make use of your
knowledge but us.

358
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:12,666
Face is an anti-magic
pulse bomb. This device

359
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,333
can clear our continent
of any trace of magic.

360
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,625
Uh!

361
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,625
A weapon that can
erase all magic?

362
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,375
That's horrible!

363
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,208
[CARLA whimpering]

364
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,666
That would give Magic
Deficiency Syndrome

365
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,208
to every wizard alive.

366
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:33,166
It gets even worse.
The demon that Natsu fought,

367
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,833
told us that Tartaros members
use curses instead of magic.

368
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:40,375
So Face's activation would wipe
out every guild but theirs.

369
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,083
Every wizard who
stands against them

370
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:45,333
would find themselves
helpless and in agony.

371
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:49,041
What a deplorable weapon
your council has made.

372
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,875
[MICHELLO whimpers]

373
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,958
You tell me where
it is right now.

374
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,958
That thing never should've
existed in the first place.

375
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:03,500
I... I really don't know.
Please forgive me.

376
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:04,875
From what I heard,

377
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,291
it was sealed away by three
former council members.

378
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:10,125
They did this by means
of body link magic.

379
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,416
I have no idea who
those members are.

380
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,375
Only the former chairman
can tell you that.

381
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,125
So what the heck is
body link magic?

382
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,541
It's the kind that Brain used
to keep Zero sealed away.

383
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,791
If us beatin' the Seis broke
the seals that bound Zero,

384
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,291
then them killing
those council members...

385
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:31,333
Yes. If Tartaros kills all
the councilmen who sealed Face,

386
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,958
then the spell will be broken.

387
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,916
We've seen no signs
of interrogation,

388
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,708
which makes me think they might
already know where Face is.

389
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:40,875
So all they gotta do is knock
off a few more council members,

390
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:44,000
and then they can eliminate
all magic? Screw that!

391
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,916
[MAKAROV] We need to
get those three protected

392
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,166
as fast as we can. You said
that the former chairman

393
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,958
can tell us who
they are, yes?

394
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:54,000
Yes. I'm all but certain.

395
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,500
[MAKAROV]
Drop everything else!

396
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,166
Find out where that
chairman lives!

397
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,166
We can assume that Tartaros
is looking for him as well.

398
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,416
Beat them!

399
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,041
We're on it, sir! We've
located the addresses

400
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,291
of sixteen other former
council members.

401
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,833
We've got people from our guild,
and a couple of others,

402
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,625
on the way to protect them.

403
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,791
Turns out that one
of those addresses

404
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,083
was the former
chairman's!

405
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:23,250
Send someone to him,
as quickly as possible!

406
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:26,583
[LAKI] One step ahead of you,
sir. They're already en route!

407
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,166
[LAKI] The two best
wizards we could send.

408
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:16,333
[LUCY] Erza and Mirajane
rush to the aid of Crawford,

409
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:18,541
former Chairman of
the Magic Council.

410
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:21,875
Unfortunately, Tartaros
has other plans for them.

411
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:24,875
Meanwhile, Doranbolt makes
a desperate decision.

412
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:26,708
One which he may come to regret.

413
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:29,333
In order to gain
information about Tartaros,

414
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:31,541
he strikes a deal with
none other than Cobra,

415
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:33,041
of the Oración Seis.

416
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:37,750
Next time: Tartaros Chapter -
Immorality and Sinners

417
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:41,375
The prayers of sinners.
Echoing across the wastes.
