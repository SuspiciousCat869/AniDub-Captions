1
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,875
[NATSU] Previously,
on Fairy Tail!

2
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:22,000
[HAPPY] We've had a few run-ins
with the Sabertooth guild,

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:25,041
even before the pre-lims.
Some good, some bad.

4
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,250
Then Natsu went ballistic,
stormed into their inn,

5
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,541
and challenged their
Master to an all-out duel!

6
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:32,125
[NATSU] Things were getting good
until my plan was interrupted.

7
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,666
[GRAY] Yeah right, I'm pretty
sure you never had a plan.

8
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,750
And shouldn't you be
focusing on day four

9
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,666
of the Games
instead of gloating?

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,083
[NATSU] Wendy's match ended in a
draw. And Erza, Cana, and Laxus

11
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,916
put on one heck of a show!

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,375
[HAPPY] I wonder what the
next big game is gonna be like.

13
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,583
For some reason I've got
a bad feeling about it.

14
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:24,125
[muffled laughter]

15
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:25,500
[FAIRY TAIL] Cheers!

16
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:28,000
Look out world!
Fairy Tail's back in action!

17
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,166
Aye!

18
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,750
Just remember,
this isn't the guild hall.

19
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,791
Anything we wreck,
we have to pay for.

20
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,166
It's safe to say
I take after my old man.

21
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,250
Yeah, yeah,
we're all very impressed.

22
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,958
You totally destroyed
the competition today!

23
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,666
[GRAY] Thanks.
When did I do that?

24
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,750
Erza made beating
those monsters look easy.

25
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,125
But I barely managed
to get a draw.

26
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,625
Don't be so hard on yourself,
you were wonderful!

27
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,875
In fact, you really
impressed everyone.

28
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,916
Mhmmm. You were really
somethin' out there!

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,083
[LUCY] I should have
known you'd heal super fast.

30
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,708
Tell us, what's your secret?

31
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:03,000
Actually, I owe it to
Wendy and Ms. Porlyusica.

32
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,416
Elfman's the opposite.

33
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,875
Their healing magic hardly
seems to help him at all.

34
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,208
Our brother's a sad case.

35
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,583
[ELFMAN sneezes]

36
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:14,333
'Kay, that hurt.
Guess someone out there's

37
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:17,291
talking about what
a manly guy I am.

38
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,791
Do I look like a pillow
or something to you?!

39
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,375
Get offa me!

40
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:32,458
No, I'm not worried
about him. Not one bit.

41
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:38,791
Has she been with me...
this entire time?

42
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,291
[ELFMAN] What a woman.

43
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,041
[HAPPY] Naval Battle!

44
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,708
We're Booze Barrel
Surfing Champions!

45
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,250
Aye, Sir!

46
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,541
[JET] Hey that's dangerous!

47
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:57,750
[DROY] Hit the deck!

48
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,291
[WENDY, CARLA, and HAPPY yell]

49
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,958
You lookin' for
a knuckle sandwich?

50
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,583
[NATSU] Fine, you can ride it!

51
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,166
You're missin' the point!

52
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,833
In that case,
I'll have a go at it!

53
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,041
[chuckles]

54
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,041
[JUVIA] Looking cool,
honey-cicle! Kisses!

55
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,333
[GRAY] Ah!

56
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,583
[JET] Man, talk
about a party foul!

57
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:18,166
Enough! Watch!
This is how you barrel surf!

58
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,333
[JET] You're gonna
break your neck!

59
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,875
[DROY]
Someone stop this madness!

60
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,708
Aw, calm down.
Erza's got this.

61
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,625
You wanna take a
shot at it, Lu?

62
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,541
I would, but I'm
wearing a skirt.

63
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:29,875
[ERZA] Augh!

64
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh yeah? Well, it looks
like someone doesn't mind

65
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,541
baring it all for
the world to see.

66
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:39,166
[ALL laughing]

67
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,166
[LEVY] Even now, I remember
it all so clearly.

68
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,708
Lucy...

69
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,541
[NATSU] Here goes, Lisanna!

70
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,458
[LEVY] All of the
eating and drinking.

71
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:55,250
The singing and dancing.
We ended day three in pure joy.

72
00:04:55,333 --> 00:05:00,541
[commotion]

73
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,291
[LECTOR] Hey, Sting.

74
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,250
Hm?

75
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,125
What's up?
Aren't you tired?

76
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,916
Naw, not really.

77
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:16,041
[STING] I get the feeling I'll
get to fight Natsu tomorrow.

78
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:19,500
I've been waiting for
this chance for seven years.

79
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,583
[STING] I'm too
excited to sleep.

80
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:25,208
[LECTOR] Hm. You got this
thing, no doubt about it!

81
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,583
[LISLIE] You and Kagura
have been acting weird

82
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,666
ever since this afternoon.

83
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,750
Did something happen today?

84
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:58,958
You could say that.

85
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,416
Hm?

86
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,791
[MILLIANNA] I don't understand.

87
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,791
Why is Fairy Tail
harboring Jellal?

88
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,500
Does Erzy even know about this?

89
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,083
[LISLIE] Well, whatever
it is that's got you down...

90
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:15,166
you can talk to me.
Being guildmates means

91
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,291
that we're always
there for each other

92
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:20,250
Thank you.
But I'll be okay.

93
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:23,083
It doesn't have anything
to do with the tournament.

94
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,791
[LISLIE] Uh, Milli,
y-you sure you're all right?

95
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,500
[MILLIANNA] I just really
wanna win this thing.

96
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,916
Y'know, I love this
guild with all my heart.

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,958
So I want to work harder.
For everyone's sake.

98
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:07,125
Sergeant Yukino Aguria
reporting for duty, Sir.

99
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:11,000
[LEVY] As the night of
day three came to an end,

100
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:15,000
all of our feelings and
ambitions became intertwined.

101
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:22,875
[LEVY] With each passing
moment, we drew closer to it.

102
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:29,000
Only four days
remained until... calamity.

103
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:34,458
[cheering]

104
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,875
[CHAPATI] It's a sunny
day for magic and mayhem!

105
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,416
We're ready
to kick off day four's

106
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,833
contest with a bang!

107
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,166
Today's game is
called "Naval Battle!"

108
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,000
That's right, folks!
Strap yourself in

109
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,791
for an exciting
skirmish in the sea!

110
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,375
The battlefield is a
large ball of water!

111
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,583
If you get pushed out,
you lose the match!

112
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:54,875
The last contestant
left swimming

113
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,500
will be declared the winner!

114
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,208
However, when only
two competitors

115
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,625
remain inside the battlefield,

116
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:02,333
a special rule
will come into play!

117
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,375
[CHAPATI] We call it
the "Five-Minute" rule.

118
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,500
In this instance, if one
of the remaining challengers

119
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,541
exits the ring within
the first five minutes

120
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,833
of the "final showdown,"
they will get last place!

121
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,458
So the game
essentially becomes

122
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,333
an underwater sumo match.

123
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,208
This will be spectacular!

124
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,125
Thank you for
having me here!

125
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,541
Today's guest is
the head of the

126
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,625
Scheherazade acting
troupe, Mr. Lavian!

127
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,666
[CHAPATI] Looks like
the challengers are chosen!

128
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,416
From Lamia Scale, it's Shelia!

129
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,208
I won't settle for a draw
today! I'm winning this!

130
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,750
[CHAPATI] Jenny from Blue
Pegasus hits the waves!

131
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,500
You'll try. But I'll succeed!

132
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:46,208
[CHAPATI] From Mermaid
Heel, it's Lislie!

133
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:50,208
Underestimate me
and you'll lose it all!

134
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:53,541
[CHAPATI] Also joining the fray
is Juvia from Fairy Tail Team B!

135
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,458
Water and I go hand-in-hand.

136
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,000
No one will beat me
while Gray is watching.

137
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:07,791
[MINERVA] Minerva of
Sabertooth at your service.

138
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,541
[CROWD cheers]

139
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,291
[CHAPATI]
Just listen to that crowd!

140
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,416
Sounds like we've got
a fan favorite here!

141
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,375
[YAJIMA] With this change,
Sabertooth's team now

142
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,416
consists of its five strongest.

143
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,791
[LAVIAN] It's an all-star
ensemble, that's for sure!

144
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,916
[CHAPATI] Lastly,
the Celestial bombshell

145
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,625
from Fairy Tail Team A, Lucy!

146
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,291
I can't lose this one either.
I let my friends down

147
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,666
the first day, but that
won't happen again!

148
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,083
[CHAPATI]
The scenery doesn't get

149
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,458
much better than this, folks!

150
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,333
Each team has
sent a swimsuit-clad

151
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,541
female challenger
to represent them!

152
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,791
[LAVIAN] Such beautiful,
enticing ladies!

153
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,916
Ah! I can't thank you enough!

154
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,625
Hold up. What about me,
man? I'm here, too!

155
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,583
Eh. Who cares?

156
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,375
Aw, come on, that's harsh!

157
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,416
[CHAPATI]
It's a deep-sea rumble!

158
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,541
Try to stay in the water
for as long as you can!

159
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,833
I hope you're ready, ladies,

160
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:58,166
'cause the Naval Battle
is about to begin!

161
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,333
This is your chance,
Lucy, go get 'em!

162
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:09,291
If she uses Aquarius she
could take 'em all out at once.

163
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,333
Let's cheer for her
as hard as we can.

164
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,416
Right!

165
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,041
I think Juvia's
gonna win this one,

166
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,125
I mean, she was made
for this kinda stuff!

167
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,916
Don't be so sure.
Lucy has a whole slew of

168
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,083
Celestial Spirits she can
call on besides Aquarius.

169
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,416
[JET] I don't think
we should count that

170
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,583
Lislie girl out, either.

171
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,375
Let's not forget
that she's got "Mermaid"

172
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,708
in her guild name.

173
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,291
And I wouldn't put it
past that Sabertooth girl

174
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,416
to try some
underhanded trick either.

175
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,666
Good luck, Lu! You can do it!

176
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,166
[gong rings]

177
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,791
[CHAPATI] There's the gong!
Let the Naval Battle begin!

178
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,708
Guess I'm gonna get the
party started this round!

179
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,833
Open, Gate of the Water Bearer!

180
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,375
[LUCY] Aquarius!

181
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,166
What the--?

182
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,208
A Spirit!

183
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,500
[chuckles]

184
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,791
A fellow mermaid, huh?
This is getting interesting!

185
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,375
[screams]

186
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,333
This is my domain,
you brazen bimbos!

187
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,375
[SHELIA, JENNY, and LISLIE yell]
[ROCKER] That's Wild!

188
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,541
My turn. Water Cyclone!

189
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,666
Okay, is it my imagination,

190
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,833
or did Juvia just
take on Aquarius?

191
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,583
This game is
already crazy!

192
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,833
How awesome! I wonder which
one of them is stronger!

193
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,958
Give it your all, Juvia!

194
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:25,125
Lucy, you could tone it
down just a pinch, okay?

195
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,458
And Jenny, I know you've
got more power than that,

196
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,125
get the lead out!

197
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,833
I think seven years
of snoozin's made your

198
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,416
cheerleading kinda rusty.

199
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,875
Alright, big mouth,
who do you think

200
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,750
we should be cheering for?

201
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,416
That's obvious.

202
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,833
Put Juvia in water and that's
all she wrote; game over.

203
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,083
It's been awhile,
hasn't it, Aquarius?

204
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,208
Don't think
I'll hold back

205
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,166
just because
we're acquaintances.

206
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,875
I wouldn't dream of it.

207
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,375
Man, Aquarius is
kicking all sorts of butt!

208
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:55,125
She can even hold her
own against Juvia's power!

209
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,375
I was just thinking...
the most impressive thing to me

210
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:00,583
is that Juvia's standing
up to Aquarius' power.

211
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,041
We're even?

212
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:06,041
I won't lose here!
My darling is watching!

213
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,791
I couldn't live with
myself if I failed.

214
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,666
It looks like the fight
isn't the only thing

215
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,708
Juvia has on her mind.

216
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,791
[ERZA] You know how
she feels about you.

217
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,750
It's not like she hides it.

218
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,125
She deserves
a straight answer.

219
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,208
Juvia.

220
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,333
My rival!

221
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,708
For the last time,
I don't want him!

222
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,166
Hmmm.

223
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,166
They are really goin' at it!

224
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,291
They're way too busy to
deal with anybody else.

225
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,541
Which means...
this is my chance!

226
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,166
No boys allowed!

227
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,708
That's not Wild!

228
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,250
[ROCKER] Aaahhh--uh!

229
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,583
[CHAPATI] Quatro Puppy
is out of the game!

230
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,333
Jenny caught Rocker
completely off guard!

231
00:12:58,416 --> 00:12:59,958
The crowd couldn't
be happier about

232
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,041
his disqualification 'cause
now they get what they

233
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,458
really wanted all along;
an all-girl bikini battle!

234
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,500
[LAVIAN] Thank you very much!
Thank you very much!

235
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,666
Oh, sweet heavens, thank you!

236
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,166
Do I mean nothin'?
Nobody loves Wild?

237
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,000
What a cheap shot. I guess
that's one way to win.

238
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,500
[MIRAJANE giggles]

239
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,458
Yes, it certainly is a unique
fighting style, isn't it?

240
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,583
Yeah. Pretty sure that
wasn't a compliment.

241
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,000
I better kick
things up a notch!

242
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,458
Huh?

243
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,750
Never underestimate
chubby power, kid!

244
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,958
[ALL] Whoa!

245
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,750
Okay, this is
taking way too long.

246
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,208
I gotta get outta here.

247
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,708
But... I need you!
What could possibly be

248
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,875
more important than
helping me win this?

249
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,500
My man.

250
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,875
[LUCY] Again?

251
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,125
Apparently Aquarius has
decided to abandon her

252
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,458
wizard to rendezvous
with her boyfriend!

253
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,250
Ah, the sweet
vigor of youth.

254
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,875
How cliché. Ugh!

255
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,750
[laughs nervously]

256
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,625
Well fought, but
without your trump card...

257
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,291
you're through!

258
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,958
[screams]

259
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,583
I could use some help here!

260
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,333
I'm sorry we're late.
Are you okay, Lucy?

261
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,458
[cheering]

262
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,166
We're your sexy
defenders, Princess!

263
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,916
Uh! That was close!

264
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,750
[cheering]

265
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,833
Now that's what I
call entertainment!

266
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:34,625
Summon all of your pets!
They can't help you!

267
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,541
Stay strong, you two!
She's incredibly powerful!

268
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,958
This would be much
easier if we were

269
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:42,208
on solid ground, but my
Princess' will is my command!

270
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,000
I'll try my best, too!

271
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,666
You wanna play with
a big girl, blondie?

272
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,291
Sounds good to me! Bring it!

273
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,666
[BOTH] Huh?

274
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,583
Keep ignoring me and you'll
wind up on your butts!

275
00:14:58,666 --> 00:14:59,958
Go get 'em!

276
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,875
[CHAPATI] Little Wendy
from Fairy Tail looks like

277
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,750
she wants in on
the action! How cute!

278
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,708
[YAJIMA] Her fight did
end in a draw yesterday.

279
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,041
[CHAPATI] I bet she wants
another go at Shelly-welly

280
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,750
so she can settle the
score once and for all!

281
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,208
[WENDY] Nuh-uh!
I do not feel that way!

282
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,125
I didn't realize
Wendy was here!

283
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,125
Oh, I'd love to
watch her in action!

284
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,083
She was such a help to
me in the past when she

285
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:24,250
shooed away those lay-abouts
from my beloved theater.

286
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,791
Hear that, Fairy Tail?
The public wants more

287
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,541
wonderful Wendy, and we
won't accept a substitute!

288
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,375
[LAVIAN] Trade her for
the pig-tailed bimbo, stat!

289
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:33,666
Thank you very much.

290
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,208
Bite me!

291
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,541
It's time I stopped
pulling my punches.

292
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:41,500
I'll take all of you out in
one fell swoop... with this!

293
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,125
My newest and
most powerful technique,

294
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,500
unleashed by my Second Origin

295
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,000
and refined
by my lover's heart!

296
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:53,333
"Darling Gray Love!"

297
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,083
Don't use me!

298
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,958
[JENNY, LISLIE,
and SHELIA scream]

299
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:02,791
Ah!

300
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:03,791
Ah!

301
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,458
Aah! Uh!

302
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,666
[chuckles]

303
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,291
I don't know if my wool wall
can take much more of this!

304
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,125
Princess! Hold on tight!

305
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,708
[CHAPATI] Look at her go!
Juvia's pushed three opponents

306
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,291
out of bounds simultaneously!

307
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,041
[CHAPATI] If she keeps
this up, she's sure to be

308
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,083
the Queen of the Naval Battle!

309
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,333
Aw, man. I thought
I could hold my own

310
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,291
in a water fight, but
instead I ended up all wet.

311
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:33,083
It's fine! You did your best!

312
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,250
[JUVIA] That was perfect!
He has to have fallen for me

313
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,333
after seeing my love in action!

314
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,833
[JUVIA] Why does he look sick?

315
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:48,541
Uh oh.

316
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,375
Juvia!

317
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,625
[JUVIA groans]

318
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,125
[CHAPATI] After a
valiantly fought battle,

319
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,166
Juvia ends up outside the ring!

320
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,708
She finishes in third place and
scores six points for her team!

321
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,125
What a klutz.

322
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,583
Love'll do that to ya.

323
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:05,333
Come now. She was
doing great for a bit!

324
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:06,750
[chuckles]

325
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,333
[STING] M'lady
sure is mischievous.

326
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,375
She could have
won right at the start,

327
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:11,708
but she let them
take each other out

328
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,458
so she could
conserve her magic.

329
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,958
That Fairy Tail girl
doesn't stand a chance.

330
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,750
[CHAPATI] Only Minerva
and Lucy remain!

331
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,291
But where did Lucy's
Celestial Spirits go?

332
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,166
[YAJIMA] I'm assuming she
sent them away in order

333
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,291
to preserve her magic power.

334
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:30,958
[CHAPATI] It's one-on-one!
Will Sabertooth take the gold?

335
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,791
Or will Fairy Tail
snatch it away?

336
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,625
[CHAPATI] The Five-Minute
Rule is now in effect!

337
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,958
If either contestant exits the
ring before the timer runs out,

338
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,458
they will be
ranked in last place!

339
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,708
[YAJIMA] Is there a reason
for this special rule?

340
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,166
[LAVIAN] You've got to
keep your audience on the

341
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,666
edge of their seats, thank you!

342
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,541
That's the golden
rule of show business!

343
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,000
[MINERVA] End of the line.
I could send you flying

344
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,791
out of this ring in the
time it takes to blink.

345
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,333
But the people
came for a show,

346
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,250
and I intend to deliver.

347
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:04,125
Try to survive.
And be sure to scream.

348
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,875
[LUCY] What in the world?

349
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,958
[LUCY screaming]

350
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,958
Pure heat? Underwater?

351
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,625
Lucy, no!

352
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,166
I've never seen
that kinda magic before!

353
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,500
[LUCY screaming]

354
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:29,041
I feel so heavy.
Like I'm made of lead.

355
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,875
I need to get a
Spirit out here, pronto.

356
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,708
[LUCY] My keys.
Where did they go?

357
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,458
Huh?

358
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,750
[LUCY] No way!

359
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,041
[LUCY yells]

360
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,833
[CHAPATI] Oh no! Lucy's headed
straight for the boundary

361
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,208
and into last place!

362
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,416
Awe.

363
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,875
What's with this heat?
It's scorching me!

364
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,291
Come on!

365
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,791
If she can't get her keys
back, this fight is over!

366
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,416
[LUCY] I can take it.

367
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,416
Hit me with your best shot!

368
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,250
[yells]

369
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,208
I'll keep fighting!

370
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,708
Oh, really?
You're sure you don't

371
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:41,291
want out of this torment?

372
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:45,250
You want me to give up?
Not happening.

373
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,458
Hmmm?

374
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,791
If I quit, after my
friends fought so hard,

375
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,833
it'd be worse than betrayal!

376
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,708
I won't do it!

377
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,458
Hurt me all you want,
I don't give a damn!

378
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,708
I'll win!

379
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,666
My guild will be
number one again!

380
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,750
[CHAPATI] Whoa.
They're just floating there.

381
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,625
Minerva has stopped
her relentless attacks!

382
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,500
But... she was so
close to victory.

383
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,666
[ding]

384
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,875
[CHAPATI] The timer is up!

385
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,291
Yes!

386
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,166
[CHAPATI] Now it's simply
a battle for the top spot!

387
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,333
[screaming]

388
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:45,958
Lucy!

389
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:50,000
[MINERVA] You haven't
learned your place, have you?

390
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,083
Maybe this will teach you
who you're dealing with!

391
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,333
[MINERVA] We are Sabertooth,
the mightiest guild

392
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,833
beneath the heavens!

393
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:01,000
You belong... on the ground!

394
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:04,500
[LUCY screams]

395
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,125
[CHAPATI] There's no way
Lucy can recover from that!

396
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,833
Where'd she go?

397
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,958
She just reappeared
in front of Minerva!

398
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,000
But was it her doing
or her opponent's?

399
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,541
That chick's fightin' dirty!

400
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,750
Why would she stop
herself from winning?

401
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,291
This is just sick!

402
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,708
All she's doing
is torturing her.

403
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,083
[CHAPATI]
Lucy is getting pummeled!

404
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,500
Even without magic,
Minerva is decimating her

405
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,333
with blow after blow!

406
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,208
[LAVIAN] How horrible.

407
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,833
Someone, please, stop
this senseless brutality!

408
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,041
I would really appreciate it!

409
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,291
[CHAPATI] Since the
match is underwater,

410
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:41,541
there are no knock-downs!

411
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:44,750
All Lucy can do is take
the relentless barrage!

412
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,750
Stop it!

413
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,750
[STING, OLGA, and RUFUS chuckle]

414
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,291
[ALL] You guys're
gonna pay for this!

415
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:53,541
Have you learned your lesson,

416
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,250
or should I keep beating it in?

417
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:58,041
I'm fine with that.
Remember this the next time

418
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,416
[MINNERVA] you think
of defying me!

419
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,875
Stop the match, now!

420
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:04,291
We can't lose the
Celestial wizard!

421
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,250
Call it off,
before it's too late!

422
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,875
[bell dinging]

423
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,125
[CHAPATI] The referee
has stopped the fight!

424
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,666
The Naval Battle is over!

425
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,458
Sabertooth takes
first place with

426
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:18,000
an overwhelming
show of brutal force!

427
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,541
It doesn't look
like Lucy is moving.

428
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:22,541
Can we please get the
paramedics on the field?

429
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,125
[ALL] Lucy!

430
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:39,500
[NATSU] Lucy!

431
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:14,250
[NATSU] Finally!

432
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,208
[HAPPY] We get to see
who's inside the bunny suit!

433
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:17,250
Uh...

434
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,625
[HAPPY and NATSU] What?!

435
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,250
[NATSU] No, is that?

436
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:23,125
[HAPPY] So, uh, when is it okay
to say something makes you

437
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:24,583
wanna puke your guts out?

438
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,333
[NATSU] When you're
motion sick? I dunno.

439
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:27,666
Why are you asking now?

440
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,958
[HAPPY] No other reason?

441
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:31,000
[NATSU] Yeah,
when you eat too much.

442
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,833
[HAPPY and NATSU] Next time:
"A Parfum for You!"

443
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:35,708
[HAPPY] You can't
say it about people?

444
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:37,166
[NATSU] Not really.

445
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,041
[HAPPY] I see. It's one of
those feelings that can't be

446
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:41,083
expressed with words.
