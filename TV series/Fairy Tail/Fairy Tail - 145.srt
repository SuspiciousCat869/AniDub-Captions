00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,666
Indeed!

157
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,166
It concerns the strange
object in the sky!

158
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,375
You can't talk
to her 'cause she

159
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,541
was caught by
the Neo-Oración Seis.

160
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:45,750
And so was Natsu!

161
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,875
My heavens.

162
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,458
[ERZA] Can't you talk to us?

163
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,291
We desperately need
all the information

164
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,000
we can get right now.

165
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,625
Actually, with the situation
unfolding as we speak,

166
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,583
there's no reason
to keep it a secret.

167
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,875
You see.

168
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,166
[JEAN-LUC] I suppose
it's safe to assume you're

169
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,541
familiar with the
name Will Neville?

170
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,000
You see, I am actually
his great-grandson.

171
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,458
My name's Jean-Luc Neville.

172
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:08,583
Huh?

173
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,000
This is certainly
a major revelation.

174
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:14,916
And what's more. I knew
Lucy's father as well.

175
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,125
Jude Heartfilia and I were quite
good friends, in all actuality.

176
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,291
You knew Lucy's old man?

177
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,833
Care to explain how
he fits into this?

178
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,208
It's a long story,

179
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,500
but let me begin by
stating that it's my duty to

180
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:30,333
keep watch over the Infinity
Clock for as long as I live.

181
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,291
If that's true, are
you a celestial wizard?

182
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,750
No sir.
I'm not.

183
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,708
But as a Neville,
I'm intimately familiar

184
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,458
with the history of the clock.

185
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,125
Actually, my lifelong goal is to

186
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,333
stave off the
chaos it can bring.

187
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:45,916
And to sound the alarm should
that threat become reality.

188
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,166
I remember when this started;
it was several months ago.

189
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,125
[JEAN-LUC] The hand of the
Infinity Clock was discovered

190
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,958
on a dig at an
ancient excavation site.

191
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,583
[JEAN-LUC] Apparently,
it was buried in the ruins

192
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,750
to contain its
tremendous magic power.

193
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,916
[JEAN-LUC] By the time
our archaeological society

194
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,916
received word that
it had been unearthed,

195
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,750
it had already been
taken off the premises.

196
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:12,375
The hand eventually ended up
in Jude Heartfilia's possession.

197
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,958
He was a collector
of such things, you see.

198
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,916
[JEAN-LUC] Thankfully,
it wasn't difficult to detect

199
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,375
because of its immense
magic power.

200
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,916
[JEAN-LUC] We were quite
fortunate, because in

201
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,500
the wrong hands, it could
be extremely dangerous.

202
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:27,083
[JEAN-LUC] I contacted
Jude immediately in the hopes

203
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,625
of preventing any impending
chaos from actually happening.

204
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,916
[JEAN-LUC] To contain the
power emanating from the hand.

205
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,916
I carefully wrapped
it up in a magical cloth.

206
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,083
[JEAN-LUC] At that point,
Jude and I made an agreement.

207
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,958
He would take steps
to ensure its safety

208
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:45,875
and actually move it
to another location entirely.

209
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,583
So that's why it ended
up being sent here to Lucy.

210
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,833
It's starting to make sense now.

211
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,333
Can you please
tell us what makes

212
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,541
the Infinity Clock so dangerous?

213
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,000
The clock has the power to bring

214
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,583
about something quite horrific.

215
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,666
A Grand Spell that is known
by the name "Real Nightmare."

216
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,625
And what happens
once the spell is cast?

217
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,666
[JEAN-LUC] It can dramatically
alter humans' perception

218
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,958
of time, you see.

219
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,916
That being the case,
I suppose you could say

220
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,583
that it actually has
control over time itself.

221
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,916
It is a rather difficult
concept to explain

222
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,833
because it doesn't actually
manipulate time per se.

223
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,041
[ARCHAEOLOGIST 133A]
But it does, in fact,

224
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,416
greatly alter our
perception of time.

225
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,541
[GRAY] I don't follow you.

226
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,458
[ELFMAN] Yeah, neither do I.

227
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,500
[ARCHAEOLOGIST 133B] This
control over time is what the

228
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:30,041
inscription referred to
as the "inevitable chaos."

229
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,541
And you're sayin'
this is gonna bring

230
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,000
about the end of the world?

231
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,708
It doesn't make
any sense to me.

232
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,791
Just think about it
for a moment.

233
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,500
What time is it now?

234
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,333
What is it that you are
actually doing right now?

235
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:44,375
Who are you having
this conversation with now?

236
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,791
Imagine what
would happen if you

237
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,958
lost all concept
of what "now" means.

238
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,208
[JEAN-LUC] You would
lose your understanding

239
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,791
of all time related concepts.

240
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,750
A person's sense of
self is derived from

241
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,666
their memories and
past experiences.

242
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,041
If they were suddenly
thrown into disarray.

243
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,000
Then we would lose
our very identities.

244
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,125
I get it.

245
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,583
Yeah that's chaos.

246
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,291
I don't think that would
even begin to describe it.

247
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,041
The Infinity Clock is hovering

248
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,458
right above Zentopia's
Grand Cathedral.

249
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,250
From what I understand,
their doctrine

250
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,250
is heavily intertwined with it.

251
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,583
According to legend,
Zentopia itself was

252
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:19,083
founded by a group of survivors
of the clock's past chaos.

253
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,291
They sealed away
all of its pieces.

254
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:24,208
and forbid any
discussion of its existence.

255
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,875
To this very day, it has
remained a well-hidden secret,

256
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,250
known only to the
church's higher echelons.

257
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,416
It accumulates magic, which
is released every hundred years.

258
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,083
Throughout history
evildoers have

259
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,875
sought to harness its power.

260
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,125
Therefore I have
a formal request.

261
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:41,541
A job that I hope the
Fairy Tail guild will take on.

262
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,708
[JEAN-LUC] Please,
stop this from happening.

263
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,958
Stop the Infinity Clock!

264
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,583
Isn't that what
we planned to do?

265
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:48,958
Sure is.

266
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,625
And we can rescue Natsu
and Lucy while we're at it.

267
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:55,375
All right, sir. We'll
gladly take the job.

268
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,500
I promise.

269
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,875
We'll stop the
clock or die tryin'!

270
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,125
[KLODOA] The Infinity
Castle rises again!

271
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,208
Congratulations
Brain the Second!

272
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,291
You've done
an excellent job, sir!

273
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,666
[MIDNIGHT]
As have you, Klodoa.

274
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,750
[KLODOA] No, no, no.

275
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,166
All I did was
follow the instructions

276
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,458
Master Zero laid
out for me, and voila!

277
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,625
[KLODOA] He put a great
deal of trust in your skill,

278
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,250
so you deserve
most of the credit.

279
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,333
You always were
his favorite, after all!

280
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:19,625
He knew you
would take the job of

281
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,916
continuing his
legacy very seriously.

282
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,875
That's why we call
you Brain the Second!

283
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,625
And just look at
this celestial wizard

284
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,208
we have in our possession!

285
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:30,000
I've gotta hand it to Imatatia
and her brilliant trickery!

286
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,875
Thanks to her, the silly girl
walked right into our trap!

287
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,875
Oh Michelle.
Please.

288
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,625
Tell me why!
Why did you do this to me?

289
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,416
My name is Imitatia.
I'm not Michelle.

290
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,458
Get it through your thick skull.

291
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:48,083
This celestial wizard is
the final piece of the puzzle.

292
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:51,416
Now the never-ending
nightmare can begin.

293
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,666
You realize that what
has kept the Infinity Clock

294
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,583
sealed away for all these years
was actually the Anti-Link spell

295
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,250
the celestial wizards
were maintaining, don't you?

296
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,583
[GRAY] We'd heard about that.

297
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,458
That's why the Neo-Oración
Seis was targeting them.

298
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,208
To sever those links, right?

299
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:19,000
Yes, but did you know that once
their body links are severed,

300
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,791
the celestial wizards
are actually cursed

301
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,375
to sleep for one hundred years.

302
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:25,000
Frozen in a kind
of "chrysalis" state.

303
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,250
[GRAY] A Chrysalis?

304
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,000
[ELFMAN] What do you mean?

305
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:32,041
Body links demand a tremendous
amount of magic power.

306
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,041
[MIDNIGHT] And whenever
an Anti-Link is severed.

307
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,500
The resulting reaction causes
time to slow down to a

308
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,166
crawl for that wizard's
mind and body.

309
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,166
This puts them into a
kind of 'sleeping' state

310
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,583
for one hundred years.

311
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,416
In essence,
this sacrifice is what

312
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,375
allows us to take control
of the Infinity Clock.

313
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,916
But they're people;
you can't do that to them!

314
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,041
Obviously, I can.

315
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,625
You and your friends
slept for seven years, right?

316
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,500
[LUCY] Yes, but you're taking
about one hundred years!

317
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,583
It's too horrible to imagine.
I know seven years

318
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,333
might not sound
long but it was excruciating.

319
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,333
[LUCY] It was so
confusing and painful.

320
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:08,875
Time kept going
for everyone else,

321
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,875
but for us it just stood still.

322
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,791
[LUCY] You could never
understand how it felt.

323
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:18,458
[LUCY] That time was
stolen from us forever.

324
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,250
At the very least
we had all our friends

325
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,583
waiting for us when
we finally woke up.

326
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,458
But these people
won't have anyone!

327
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,833
Their loved ones will be gone!

328
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,208
It's sad but true.

329
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,291
That's why it's a curse.

330
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:35,083
And now that same
curse will befall you.

331
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,666
Michelle.

332
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,083
Our friendship was real to me;
I never lied to you about that.

333
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,958
[IMITATIA] This is
for your sake, sister.

334
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,500
You expect me to believe
you're doing this for my sake.

335
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:48,875
After all your lies?

336
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,166
How could you?

337
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:54,125
Believe me or not,
they weren't all just lies.

338
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,083
Were you
lying about my dad?

339
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,458
About me?

340
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,041
Did you really see
me as your big sister?

341
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,708
Lucy.

342
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,500
[KLODOA] Okay you two, this
is very entertaining,

343
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,291
but we have real work to do.

344
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,125
You're right.
So let's begin.

345
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,666
Of course.
If you're ready.

346
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,916
Lucy Heartfilia.
The time has come...

347
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,750
...to say goodbye.

348
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,333
[JEAN-LUC] I'm actually
extremely grateful you've

349
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,333
agreed to accept my request.

350
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,666
Titania, I have something
especially for you.

351
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,958
What is it?

352
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,583
Let me show you.

353
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,625
It's actually an item that
was discovered along with

354
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,333
the clock hand at the
excavation site.

355
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,625
It's believed to
have the ability

356
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,875
to ward off evil, you see.

357
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,000
[JEAN-LUC] I'm certain that you
are the only one who's actually

358
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,458
strong enough to
wield this weapon

359
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,250
in the way it was
originally intended.

360
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:44,958
Thank you.

361
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,416
I'll do my best.

362
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,541
You got this, Erza!

363
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:49,875
Of course.

364
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,375
We will do whatever we can
to offer our assistance.

365
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,125
Mainly by continuing
our research

366
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,291
on how to stop Real Nightmare.

367
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,458
Thank you.

368
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,333
We appreciate the help.

369
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,083
Any ideas on how we're
gonna attack these jerks?

370
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,708
Don't you worry.
Help is on the way!

371
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:07,958
[LAHAR] This is an
excellent find.

372
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,833
Very good work.

373
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:10,916
[SUBORDINATE 145A]
It's the only surveillance

374
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,375
lacrima we
could locate.

375
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,125
It wasn't easy, but we
were able to recover

376
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,458
some of the footage
from it as well.

377
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,416
I see.

378
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,916
Can you show me this footage?

379
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,291
Sir!

380
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,583
[SUBORDINATE 145A] These
are the only known images

381
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:29,000
of the priest who regularly
visited the Oración Seis.

382
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,791
Right there!
Enhance the image!

383
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,291
[SUBORDINATE 145A] Yes, sir!

384
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,458
[SUBORDINATE 145A] My god.

385
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:42,083
It was him all along.
Cardinal Lapointe.

386
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,791
He's been working with them.

387
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,708
Alright, I'm counting
on you guys to

388
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,250
put on a really big show!

389
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,375
[BUTT BOSS] I guarantee that
you will not be disappointed!

390
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,208
Now!

391
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,708
Ready lackeys?

392
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:53,791
[BUTT LACKEY A] Ready, boss!
[BUTT LACKEY B] Ready, boss!

393
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,000
High-Speed Butt Jiggle!

394
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,583
Commence!

395
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,791
Whoa!
That's awesome!

396
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,666
[NATSU] Keep it goin'!
You're almost there!

397
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,708
[NATSU] I said keep going!

398
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,375
Do you realize
how exhausting this is, kid?

399
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,625
If anyone's butts
can do this, it's yours!

400
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:20,375
We need fire without magic, and
this is the only way to get it!

401
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,333
Besides, wasn't this whole thing
your idea in the first place?

402
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,541
Now jiggle those
butts like you mean it!

403
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,583
[WENDY] Hey look!
It's the Christina Advance!

404
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,833
Blue Pegasus!
Now there's some real men!

405
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,750
[ICHIYA] Man!

406
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,375
[ICHIYA] Ow.

407
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,375
My beautiful face.

408
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,166
So we're counting
on this guy?

409
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,708
We need his ship to
get to the Infinity Clock.

410
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,875
Unless you know how
to fly, it's the only way.

411
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,208
Yeah, But he's
so freakin' annoying.

412
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,583
[MAKAROV] Would ya
quit your belly-aching

413
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,583
and just get onboard already?

414
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,708
Guess I'm staying
behind again, huh?

415
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,291
My predictions are gonna
be right on this time.

416
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,083
We've gotta be very
careful about choosing

417
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,083
who goes on the
Christina Advance.

418
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,791
'Cause we need to have a strong
team here on the ground, too.

419
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,291
Comrades!

420
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,541
Our assault on the Infinity
Clock is now ready to begin!

421
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,083
[ICHIYA] So away we go!

422
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,625
Man!

423
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,750
Hey, I thought you knew
how to fly this thing!

424
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,250
Is there a problem?

425
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,333
[ICHIYA] We've taken
damage to the hull!

426
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,333
Stay here!

427
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,041
I'll go and check it out!

428
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,250
Oh, man.

429
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,125
[ELFMAN] Hold on!
I'll go with you!

430
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,208
What do you
think happened?

431
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,666
I think.
Someone did this!

432
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,125
Whoa,
it was sabotage?

433
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,958
That's right.

434
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:42,875
[ELFMAN] Mira!
It's The Neo-Oración Seis!

435
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,666
That's... Racer!

436
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,125
[Racer chuckles]

437
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,166
Alright.

438
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,375
Sneakin' on board
is pretty manly,

439
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,041
but you'll regret it!

440
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:54,208
[RACER] You will fall.
Big man.

441
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,791
[ELFMAN] He's gone.

442
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,416
Manly attack!

443
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,583
Too slow.

444
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,375
Oh. You made
a mistake.

445
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,416
Are you as fast as I am?

446
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,416
You wanna see?

447
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,041
Mira!

448
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,041
I can handle Racer
on my own, I promise!

449
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,416
Go on with the mission!

450
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,208
Did you just see that?

451
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,750
It was Racer!

452
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,875
And Mira.

453
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,583
Come on man!
Go get her!

454
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,458
I'm sorry... But
we can't right now!

455
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,583
Let my sister
take care of that guy!

456
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:36,458
What?

457
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,583
You sure?

458
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,250
Yeah,
we gotta keep going!

459
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,041
Hurry!

460
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,958
[ICHIYA] Alright, but we need
to make some repairs first!

461
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,375
Everyone lend a hand!

462
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:46,416
[GRAY] On it!

463
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,958
Just be careful.
Please.

464
00:19:58,708 --> 00:19:59,916
[MIRAJANE] Stop!

465
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,750
[RACER] You're in the way.

466
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,208
Didn't you hear me?
Stop!

467
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,375
[MAKAROV] My children.
Please come back in one piece.

468
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,375
[JET] Hey!
Kinana's not here!

469
