1
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,041
[IRENE]
It's over, Erza!

2
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,666
This is how you die!

3
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,750
[laughs]

4
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:38,875
[ERZA]
I can still move my right arm.

5
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,458
[ERZA]
It's all or nothing!

6
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:47,958
At some point in time, people
started calling me Titania,

7
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:51,583
the named shared by
a legendary Fairy Queen.

8
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:54,500
Honestly, I've never
given that much thought

9
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:57,291
to what people chose to call me.

10
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:00,750
But if you're the
Queen of the Dragons...

11
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:04,666
...then I'll take the
name Titania with pride.

12
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,291
A queen who cherishes her
people and protects them.

13
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,875
I'll do all I can to
help those in need,

14
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:13,333
even if it ends
up destroying me!

15
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:15,833
Lend me your strength, Master!

16
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:17,416
Please!

17
00:02:54,708 --> 00:03:00,458
[yelling]

18
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,958
Erza?

19
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:19,708
[yells]

20
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:29,625
[yells]

21

[gasps]

22
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,750
[gasps]

23
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,166
[IRENE]
That's insane.

24
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,833
[yells]

25
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,791
[IRENE]
It's impossible!

26
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:19,375
[ERZA]
Get ready!

27
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,666
[IRENE] Maybe you can
cut through a meteor,

28
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,541
but you can't pierce
my dragon scales!

29
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,791
[IRENE]
Never!

30
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:39,750
[WENDY] I can enchant her sword
with Dragon Slayer magic.

31
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,375
[WENDY]
Enchant!

32
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:51,333
--[ERZA yells]
--[IRENE screams]

33
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:55,416
[yelling]

34
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,958
Hey. Y'okay?

35
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,333
[IRENE]
You've been a thorn in my side.

36
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,958
But that's all you are to me.

37
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,208
Your pathetic life ends here.

38
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,625
I'll see to that myself!

39
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,041
[gasps]

40
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:30,708
[BABY crying]

[IRENE sighs]

42
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,166
It's a girl.

43
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,583
I'm so relieved.

44
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:44,583
With her body,
I can live a new life.

45
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,416
It'll be easy.

46
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,791
Just enchant my
personality into her,

47
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,875
and I'll be free of this curse.

48
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,291
This wretched prison of flesh.

49
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,625
It's finally happening.

50
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:04,833
[IRENE] After 400 years,
I can be me again.

51
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,083
[IRENE] I'll have a body
without this Dragon Seed

52
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,875
growing inside of it.

53
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:17,250
Now, it's time for you
to be my vessel.

54
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,333
Stop.

55
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,791
Stop smiling.

56
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,875
Please.

57
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:34,500
I've endured 400 years
of pain and suffering.

58
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,083
I can't afford to hesitate.

59
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,458
[IRENE]
I've earned this chance.

60
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:45,333
And this child belongs to me.

61
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:50,041
[IRENE] I can do whatever
I want with her!

62
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,416
[IRENE gasps]

63
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,958
[IRENE]
Stop it.

64
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,541
Please! Stop smiling!

65
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,166
[IRENE]
Stop smiling!

66
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,791
[grunts]

67
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,541
[ERZA]
I smile....

68
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:31,041
...because there's
still fight in me!

69
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,958
Amazing.

70
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,625
[IRENE]
Too soft.

71
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,541
You don't know how
to finish a fight.

72
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,083
[ERZA]
My sword... it's gone.

73
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,166
[IRENE]
I have your blade.

74
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,958
Why?

75
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,583
[IRENE]
This is pathetic.

76
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:41,500
I'm the most powerful woman
in the empire, but still...

77
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,333
I can't go through with it.

78
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,958
I can't kill my daughter.

79
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,416
[ERZA]
But why?

80
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,625
Why? Good question.

81
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:11,250
[IRENE] I've tried to bury
the truth from myself.

82
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:15,000
I didn't enchant myself
into you back then...

83
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,375
...because I chose not to.

84
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,333
[IRENE]
You were so innocent.

85
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,041
So new.

86
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,125
And so beautiful.

87
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:38,416
[IRENE] Before I could change
my mind, I chose to abandon you.

88
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,208
[IRENE]
I'm not so naive

89
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:46,458
to think you'd believe
me after all I've done.

90
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:06,000
But your smile... reminded me...

91
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:15,500
[IRENE] Deep down, beneath
this cold shell, this mask...

92
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:25,625
Inside my heart...
I truly loved you.

93
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:06,041
[ERZA]
Farewell... mother.

94
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,583
[WENDY]
Erza?

95
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,833
Wendy.

96
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,541
Are you hurt?

97
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,083
I'm way more
worried about you.

98
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:24,083
Thank you, but... I think
I'm gonna be all right.

99
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:27,125
I mean, are you...

100
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,583
...are you okay emotionally?

101
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:34,375
[ERZA] Yeah, that was tough,
but I'll be fine.

102
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,250
You're sweet. Thank you.

103
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:43,541
[ERZA] Her life was full
of anger born from sorrow.

104
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,000
But the only parent
I've ever known...

105
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,375
...is our Master.

106
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:55,416
Actually, I've been wondering
about something for a bit.

107
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,416
Why can't I smell Master's scent
on the battlefield anymore?

108
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,916
There are a lot of other
scents all mixed together.

109
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,791
Maybe I just lost him somehow.

110
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,458
[ERZA]
It's okay, Wendy.

111
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,833
I'll always be here for you.

112
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:32,208
[WENDY]
He's... gone?

113
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,750
So... I'm dying?

114
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,541
Yes.

115
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:57,125
The Dragon Seed and
Demon Seed are merging.

116
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:02,208
Which means, your human
life is no more.

117
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,416
But I'm not ready.

118
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,958
There's so much for me to do.

119
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,541
This sucks.

120
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:14,291
I mean, I still gotta beat
Zeref and Acnologia.

121
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,750
Aw, man!

122
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,125
Hey! Why'd you do that?

123
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,958
I was already feelin' crappy!

124
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:24,458
[IGNEEL] I'm not done
talking, so listen closely.

125
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:25,666
[NATSU]
What is it?

126
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,958
[IGNEEL] Think about
what I just told you.

127
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,083
I clearly said that those
two seeds combining

128
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,250
would spell your death.

129
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,166
So don't let that happen.

130
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,958
You must choose
one or the other.

131
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,208
Choose one? But how?

132
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:44,666
By reflecting on yourself.
Deep inside, what are you?

133
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,625
[IGNEEL]
Are you a dragon...

134
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,208
[IGNEEL]
...or a demon?

135
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:03,875
E.N.D. is my most powerful
creation. My legacy.

136
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:07,250
You'll face the same
choice as Igneel.

137
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:10,500
To let live or to kill.

138
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:14,041
Either way, I look
forward to it.

139
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:17,500
Am I a dragon? Or a demon?

140
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,666
I think you may have
found your answer.

141
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,250
Well?

142
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,416
I have.

143
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,958
I'm neither of 'em.

144
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,875
Because I'm human.

145
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,916
I'm Natsu Dragneel!

146
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,625
[IGNEEL]
Hm.

147
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,250
Yes.

148
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,125
I'm impressed, Natsu.
You found the right answer.

149
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,333
[NATSU]
Huh?

150
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:41,708
[IGNEEL] You were reborn
by a demon's power.

151
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:53,416
[IGNEEL] And you were raised
under a dragon's care.

152
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,416
But in your heart, you're human.

153
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:02,958
[IGNEEL] The struggle inside you
caused both seeds to grow,

154
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,458
each trying to take dominance.

155
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,166
Thanks, dad.

156
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:13,916
And now, you're ready
to move forward.

157
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,625
To walk on your own two feet.

158
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,291
I am.

159
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,791
[NATSU gasps]

160
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,416
[HAPPY, LUCY gasp]

161
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,208
Natsu!

162
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,416
You're alive!

163
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
You jerk!

164
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,041
Do you know how worried we were?

165
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,750
[HAPPY]
I was so scared.

166
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:48,125
I thought you would
never wake up again!

167
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,458
Is there a reason why
you're buck naked, Lucy?

168
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:53,416
I, uh... I can explain!

169
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,250
[PORLYUSICA]
You were as cold as the grave.

170
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:03,125
It was all she could do
to try and keep you warm.

171
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,791
[NATSU]
Granny!

172
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,500
You should be thanking
her right now.

173
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,958
I helped, too. I was
petting you the whole time.

174
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,708
You were?

175
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,166
Aw, buddy. Thanks!

176
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,833
Aye-aye, Sir!

177
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,458
Thanks, Lucy!

178
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,333
Of course. No big deal.

179
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:27,000
How are you feeling, Natsu?

180
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:34,458
I'm feelin' awesome.
All fired up!

181
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:35,666
That's great, but--

182
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,541
[NATSU]
Hm?

183
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:42,375
It's just... If you take
out Zeref, won't you--?

184
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,750
No way! You told her that?

185
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,166
[HAPPY]
Uh...

186
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,875
Don't worry, okay?

187
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,791
I'm gonna be fine.

188
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,125
Really.

189
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,750
A bunch of stuff
went on in my head,

190
00:18:56,833 --> 00:19:00,875
and now, I made up my mind
that I'm human after all.

191
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,583
Boom! Problem solved.

192
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:06,125
[LUCY]
O-Okay, if you say so.

193
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,583
You know where
Gray and Erza are?

194
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,625
My memory's kinda fuzzy,

195
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,541
but I feel like I did
somethin' bad to 'em.

196
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:16,333
Gray's probably still
asleep in the next room.

197
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:19,416
And I think Erza is outside
fighting somewhere.

198
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,791
[ALL gasp]

199
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,375
What the--?

200
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:29,416
Hang on. We've seen
this light before.

201
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,875
Whoa!

202
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,000
This light.

203
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,541
Irene has fallen.

204
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,125
She must have.

205
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:05,333
The Universe One
spell is dissipating.

206
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:08,000
The world is going
back to how it was.

207
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:22,375
[WIZARDS chattering]

208
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:25,958
It's Magnolia!

209
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,666
Oh, wow!

210
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,708
It's back to normal again!

211
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,083
I think.

212
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,708
[LUCY]
Uh. Where are we?

213
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,666
We're at my place now?!

214
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,833
Seems perfect to me!

215
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,458
[NATSU] This is where
things usually start.

216
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:53,458
All we gotta do is
walk down the street...

217
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,208
...and head to Fairy Tail!

218
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,541
Aye, Sir!

219
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,250
[LUCY]
After Irene's defeat by Erza,

220
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:44,208
Magnolia finally goes back
to how it should be.

221
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,833
Mavis leads the
members of Fairy Tail

222
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:49,625
as they race to the guild hall,
with fire in all their bellies.

223
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:52,583
Meanwhile, the leader of
the Spriggan Twelve, August,

224
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:55,125
watches them from on high.

225
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:57,500
But just when order is
restored to the land,

226
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:59,583
calamity rains down.

227
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:02,583
Next Time: "Gray's Trump Card."

228
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:05,625
The end of Ragnarok
is drawing near.
