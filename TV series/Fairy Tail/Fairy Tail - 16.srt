1
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:19,625
- HEY, GUYS.  READY FOR
SOME MORE "FAIRY TAIL"?

2
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:21,791
JUST MAKE SURE
THAT WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING

3
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,375
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE ROOM.

4
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:26,333
AND DON'T SIT
TOO CLOSE TO THE TV.

5
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:28,791
- Happy:
PREVIOUSLY ON "FAIRY TAIL,"

6
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,291
IT TURNS OUT THAT LYON
USED TO STUDY MAGIC

7
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:32,958
WITH GRAY WHEN 
THEY WERE KIDS.

8
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,416
10 YEARS AGO,
THEIR MASTER, UR,

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,375
USED A SPELL CALLED
"ICED SHELL"

10
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:39,875
TO TURN HERSELF INTO ICE AND
SEAL AWAY THE DEMON DELIORA.

11
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:42,375
- Lyon: WE BOTH KNOW YOU'RE
THE ONE WHO KILLED UR.

12
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:44,916
- Gray: ARE WE GONNA DIE,
OR ARE WE GONNA LIVE?

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,875
- ( theme music playing )

14
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:27,333
- YOU WOULDN'T! YOU'RE NOT
BRAVE ENOUGH TO GIVE YOUR LIFE.

15
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,666
- JUST WATCH ME.

16
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,000
- DON'T DO IT!

17
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,500
- NATSU, ERZA,

18
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,916
ALL MY FRIENDS
IN FAIRY TAIL,

19
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,541
THE REST IS UP TO YOU.

20
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,541
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU,

21
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:47,500
BUT MY TIME IS UP.

22
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,375
ICED SHELL!

23
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,291
- SHUT UP!
- ( gasps )

24
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:54,208
- ( panting )

25
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,750
- NATSU!

26
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,625
- YOU CAN'T JUST BUST IN
AND STEAL THE SCENE

27
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,208
WITH A BUNCH OF FANCY TALK.

28
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,000
GET TO THE BACK
OF THE LINE, PAL.

29
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,541
- BACK OF WHAT LINE?

30
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,541
- I WAS HERE FIRST,
SO IT'S MY FIGHT.

31
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:05,958
- WHAT?
WHEN I GOT HERE,

32
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,541
THE FIRST WORDS
OUT OF MY MOUTH WERE

33
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,125
"LEAVE HIM TO ME."
- YEAH, AND I SAID "NO WAY, MAN"

34
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,416
LIKE A SECOND AFTER THAT.

35
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,291
- WHY YOU--
- WHAT?  YOU WANT SOME?

36
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,041
- I DON'T CARE
WHO SAID WHAT,

37
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,500
I'VE GOT A SCORE TO SETTLE
WITH HIM, YOU UNDERSTAND?

38
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,958
AND I'M READY TO DIE
IF THAT'S WHAT I GOTTA DO.

39
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,958
- YEAH?

40
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,041
AND HOW'S DYING 
GONNA SETTLE IT?

41
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,791
HUH?

42
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,041
'CAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE RUNNING AWAY TO ME.

43
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,708
- ( gasps )

44
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:38,916
- WHAT NOW?

45
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,208
- ( shouts, screams )

46
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,666
- EAT THIS!

47
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,416
- DO NOT FALTER.

48
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,583
WE MUST STRIKE DOWN
ALL WHO OPPOSE

49
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:57,083
THE COLD EMPEROR.
- ( cheering )

50
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,541
- ( chuckles )

51
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,375
- ( disciples chattering )

52
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,458
- WHAT'S THAT SOUND?

53
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,791
- ( gasps )
NO WAY.

54
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,083
WHOA, THE TEMPLE JUST
UN-TILTED ITSELF.

55
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,041
- OW! ( mumbles )

56
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,625
- THIS IS BAD.

57
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,625
NOW THE MOON'S GONNA
SHINE ON DELIORA.

58
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:23,125
- PARDON THE INTERRUPTION.

59
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,458
- I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN. 
I TAKE IT YOU DID THIS?

60
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,125
- INDEED I DID, SIR.

61
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,541
THE MOON WILL BE OUT SOON,
SO I THOUGHT I'D TAKE

62
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,791
THE LIBERTY OF STRAIGHTENING
THE TEMPLE FOR YOU.

63
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,041
- THAT WEIRDO FIXED IT
ALL BY HIMSELF?

64
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:37,125
- AND AFTER I WENT TO ALL THAT
TROUBLE TO MESS IT UP, TOO.

65
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,541
HEY, SO WHAT'D YOU DO
TO FIX IT, HUH?

66
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,208
- HUH?

67
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,708
( laughs )

68
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,916
- TELL ME HOW YOU DID IT,
YOU JERK!

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,875
- NOW THAT EVERYTHING ELSE
IS IN ORDER,

70
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,500
I SUPPOSE I SHOULD COMMENCE
THE MOON DRIP CEREMONY.

71
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,416
- ( stammers )
HEY!

72
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,625
WOULD YOU QUIT IGNORING ME,
YOU DEMON-HAIRED FREAK?!

73
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,083
- ( laughs )
- GET BACK HERE!

74
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,500
- NATSU!

75
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,250
- I'M GONNA POUND HIM
A MILLION--

76
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,083
NO, A BILLION TIMES.

77
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,041
I'LL LET YOU HANDLE
THAT ICE GUY.

78
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,416
- ( gasps )

79
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,666
- IT'LL LOOK BAD
IF YOU LOSE AGAIN.

80
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,833
- YEAH.

81
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,416
- AND NOT JUST FOR YOU.

82
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,916
- I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,250
- Both:
BUT FOR ALL OF FAIRY TAIL.

84
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,625
- ( chuckles )

85
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,291
- MY, MY.
WHAT A BOISTEROUS PAIR YOU ARE.

86
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,916
- TELL ME SOMETHING.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,875
A SECOND AGO WHEN I WAS GONNA
FREEZE US BOTH FOR GOOD,

88
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,875
YOU WERE COUNTING ON
NATSU TO STOP ME

89
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,041
BEFORE I COULD FINISH, RIGHT?

90
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,541
- NO.
THE OPPOSITE IN FACT.

91
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,208
I NEVER THOUGHT
HE'D BE FOOLISH ENOUGH

92
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,125
TO COME NEAR
A SPELL LIKE THAT.

93
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,625
- SO YOU WERE JUST GONNA
STAND THERE AND TAKE THE HIT?

94
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:43,875
- EXACTLY. BECAUSE SOMEONE
WOULD COME TO RESCUE ME.

95
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,708
YOU ON THE OTHER HAND
WOULD BE FINISHED FOR GOOD.

96
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,875
- I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

97
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,291
- CERTAINLY,
IT WOULD BE INCONVENIENT

98
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,208
TO BE SEALED IN ICE,
BUT MY ALLIES

99
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,375
ARE AS DEVOTED TO
MY CAUSE AS I AM.

100
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,291
AND AS LONG AS
WE'RE ON THIS ISLAND,

101
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,666
THEY COULD USE MOON DRIP TO MELT
THE ICE WHENEVER THEY SAW FIT.

102
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,541
- I DIDN'T THINK OF THAT.

103
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,333
GUESS THE ICED SHELL
IS COMPLETELY USELESS HERE.

104
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,958
- EVEN SO,
YOU STILL WANT TO FIGHT?

105
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:11,083
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME?

106
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,083
- DON'T FOOL YOURSELF.
YOU COULD NEVER--

107
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,666
- THAT'S ENOUGH.
- WHAT?

108
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,000
- JUST FORGET ABOUT DELIORA.

109
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,916
- WHAT KIND OF
NONSENSE IS THIS?

110
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,750
YOUR THREATS DON'T WORK,
SO YOU TURN TO BEGGING? 

111
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,083
DOES YOUR GUILD
HAVE A DENTIST 

112
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,750
THAT REMOVED YOUR FANGS?

113
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,416
OR ARE YOU JUST A COWARD?

114
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,666
- LYON, THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

115
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,250
- WHAT IS IT?

116
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,625
- UR IS STILL ALIVE.

117
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,583
THE ICED SHELL
DOESN'T KILL ITS CASTER.

118
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,583
IT USES THEIR BODY
TO FORM THE BARRIER.

119
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,250
THE ICE KEEPING DELIORA
SEALED AWAY

120
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,166
WHICH YOU'VE BEEN
TRYING TO MELT

121
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,083
IS ACTUALLY MASTER UR.

122
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,500
SHE ISN'T DEAD.
SHE LIVES ON AS THAT ICE.

123
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:01,208
I'M SORRY THAT I NEVER
TOLD YOU THE TRUTH BACK THEN.

124
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,791
UR MADE ME PROMISE
TO KEEP QUIET.

125
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:07,916
- Ur: IF HE FOUND OUT
I HAD BEEN TURNED TO ICE,

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,791
HE'D PROBABLY WASTE
HIS ENTIRE LIFE

127
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,750
TRYING TO FIND A WAY
TO UNDO THE SPELL.

128
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,125
- OF COURSE.

129
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,791
- IT'S OVER.

130
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,333
THERE'S NO REASON TO GO
THROUGH WITH THIS ANYMORE.

131
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,041
- ( roars )

132
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:29,583
- ( grunts )

133
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:35,125
- YOU IDIOT.
I KNOW HOW THE SPELL WORKS.

134
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:38,500
I CAN ASSURE YOU
SHE'S NOT ALIVE ANYMORE.

135
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,833
THAT'S NOTHING MORE 
THAN A CHUNK OF ICE.

136
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,833
- YOU-- YOU KNEW...

137
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,250
KNEW ALL ALONG?

138
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,500
( grunts )

139
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,083
- KNOWING IS ONE THING,

140
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,666
BELIEVING IS ANOTHER.

141
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,166
AND IF YOU TRULY BELIEVE
UR IS ALIVE IN THERE,

142
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,000
YOU'RE AN EVEN GREATER
FOOL THAN I THOUGHT.

143
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,000
- YOU KNEW THE TRUTH

144
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,666
AND YOU STILL DID THIS?!

145
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,958
( breathes heavily )

146
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:05,208
- AND WHAT OF IT?

147
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,166
- ( grunts )

148
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,000
- OHH.

149
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,333
IMPOSSIBLE.

150
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,958
HOW CAN YOU MOVE
WITH THAT WOUND?

151
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,833
- I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

152
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,958
I WANTED TO SAVE YOU.

153
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,750
BUT I GIVE UP NOW.

154
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:25,875
- YOU WANT THE TITLE OF 
STAR PUPIL FOR YOURSELF?

155
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:29,708
WELL, I'M SORRY, BUT I HAVE TO
FIGHT AGAINST DELIORA SOON.

156
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,708
AND I'D RATHER NOT WASTE
MY MAGIC ENERGY ON YOU. 

157
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,333
- THEN WE'LL
JUST USE OUR FISTS.

158
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,875
- ( chuckles ) YOU WANT ME TO
FIGHT YOU WITHOUT USING MAGIC?

159
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,250
THAT'S FINE BY ME.

160
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,916
- ( shouts, grunts )

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,541
- AIM FOR YOUR
OPPONENT'S WEAK SPOT

162
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,291
AND HIT IT WITH
ALL YOU'VE GOT.

163
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,958
UR TAUGHT US THAT,
REMEMBER?

164
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,291
- YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO SPEAK HER NAME. 

165
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,125
AND I WON'T LET YOU!

166
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,916
( groans )

167
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,041
- GET BACK HERE AND ANSWER
MY QUESTION ALREADY,

168
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,125
YOU FREAK SHOW!
- ( laughs )

169
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,250
- COME ON, MAN.
WHY WON'T YOU JUST TELL ME

170
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,208
HOW YOU FIXED THE TEMPLE?!

171
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,541
THAT ALL YOU'VE GOT?
WHAT A JOKE.

172
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,333
- ( chuckles )

173
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,583
THERE YOU HAVE IT.

174
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,916
THAT'S HOW I FIXED THE TEMPLE 
AFTER YOU SO RUDELY TITLED IT.

175
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,708
- WHAT KIND OF CRAZY
MAGIC IS THAT?

176
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,166
- IF YOU REALLY MUST KNOW,

177
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,333
I PRACTICE ONE OF
THE LOST MAGICS. 

178
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:30,000
IN OTHER WORDS, BOTH ITS
STRENGTH AND SIDE EFFECTS

179
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,250
ARE SO POWERFUL

180
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:34,125
IT HAS BEEN ERASED FROM
HISTORY AS WE KNOW IT. 

181
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,791
- SERIOUSLY?

182
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,333
- THAT DRAGON SLAYER MAGIC
OF YOURS IS NO DIFFERENT. 

183
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,833
- REALLY?

184
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,333
WHERE'D HE GO?

185
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,833
I'M SICK OF CHASING HIM AROUND!
I WANT TO FIGHT!

186
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,791
- ( grunting )

187
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,208
- WHAT A SHAME.

188
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,000
YOUR FISTS ARE
AS WEAK AS YOUR MAGIC.

189
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,416
- ( shouts )

190
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,375
WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW

191
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,958
KIND OF REMINDS ME
OF SOMEONE ELSE

192
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,500
I USED TO
SPAR WITH AS A KID.

193
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,208
- THIS IS THE END!
- AAH!

194
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,791
- ( gasps )

195
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:10,791
- Natsu: GET UP.
- Young Natsu: GET UP.

196
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:11,916
- NATSU.

197
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,875
- ( panting )

198
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,083
- COME ON. GET UP.

199
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,375
- YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO NEEDS TO GET UP,

200
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,083
SO YOU COME ON.

201
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:31,291
- ( both shout )

202
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,666
( both panting )

203
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,416
- SORRY, BUT YOU LOSE.

204
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,458
- HOLD ON.

205
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,750
THIS FIGHT'S NOT NEAR OVER,
GRAY.

206
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,791
- WELL, IF THAT'S
THE WAY YOU WANT IT...

207
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,750
- ( both shout )

208
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,416
- ( panting )

209
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,833
THAT SETTLES IT. YOU WERE
NO MATCH FOR ME AFTER ALL.

210
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,833
- HOLD ON.

211
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:05,000
THIS FIGHT'S 
NOT OVER JUST YET.

212
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,750
- ( sighs ) I SHOULD HAVE KILLED
YOU WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE!

213
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,916
- AAH!

214
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,041
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
STEP UP YOUR GAME

215
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,291
IF YOU WANT TO BEAT ME.

216
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,541
- ( shouts )

217
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,291
- I DIDN'T GIVE UP
AGAINST NATSU,

218
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,500
AND I WON'T AGAINST YOU!

219
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:23,833
( grunts )

220
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,833
I'M NOT GONNA LOSE.
YOU HEAR ME?

221
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,791
- ( both grunting )

222
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:41,333
- I'M NOT GONNA LOSE!

223
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:42,875
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO

224
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,583
'CAUSE I WANNA WIN!

225
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,041
- Both:
YOU'RE GOING DOWN!

226
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,708
- ( grunts )

227
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,666
I WON'T LOSE.
YOU'RE GOING DOWN!

228
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,583
- YOU CAN NEVER DEFEAT ME!

229
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,625
- I REMEMBER LOOKING
AT THE SKY THAT DAY.

230
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,333
I DON'T KNOW WHY,

231
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,291
BUT IT WAS SO BLUE
IT MADE ME ANGRY. 

232
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,083
( shouts )

233
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,166
- AAH!

234
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,208
- NOTICE ANYTHING STRANGE, LUCY?

235
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,208
- YEAH.  EVEN THOUGH
THERE'S A BUNCH OF THEM,

236
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,291
THEIR MAGIC SEEMS WEAK
FOR SOME REASON.

237
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,708
- EXACTLY.
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL,

238
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,875
THERE ARE ONLY
FIVE WIZARDS AMONG THEM.

239
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,625
- OH, MAN. GUESS THAT MEANS I'M
GONNA HAVE TO GO EASY ON THEM.

240
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,666
- JUST KEEP TELLING
YOURSELF THAT.

241
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,541
- DO YOU THINK YOU CAN
HANDLE THIS ONE?

242
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,000
- OH, YOU BETCHA.

243
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:52,125
OPEN, GATE OF THE GIANT CRAB.

244
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,666
CANCER!

245
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,416
- CANCER.

246
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,583
- HMM.
WE'VE MET BEFORE, HAVEN'T WE?

247
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,416
- INDEED WE HAVE.

248
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,916
AND AS ALWAYS,
I AM AT YOUR SERVICE, MISS.

249
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,166
- I THOUGHT YOU ALWAYS SAID
BABY? WHAT'S WITH MISS?

250
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,416
AND AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE AT MY SERVICE?!

251
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,458
- I THINK SOMEONE'S
JEALOUS.

252
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,083
- TAKE THEM DOWN!

253
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,833
BUT DON'T KILL THEM.
JUST ROUGH THEM UP, OKAY?

254
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,083
- ALL RIGHT, BABY.
UH, MISS.

255
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,583
- ( panting )

256
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,125
( groans )

257
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,583
THE COLD EMPEROR
DEFEATED IN BATTLE

258
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,166
BY THE LIKES OF YOU?

259
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,125
I WON'T STAND FOR IT.

260
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,458
- THEN GET OVER HERE
AND FIGHT.

261
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,375
- ( groans )

262
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,375
ICE MAKE: SNOW DRAGON!

263
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,291
- ( roars )

264
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,416
- ( shouts )

265
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,833
I THOUGHT WE AGREED
NOT TO USE MAGIC, LYON.

266
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,208
- DON'T BE SUCH
A SORE LOSER.

267
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,125
THIS DUEL WAS
POINTLESS FROM THE START.

268
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,375
DELIORA WILL BE
REVIVED EITHER WAY.

269
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:13,000
ALAS, IT'S FAR TOO LATE
TO STOP ME NOW.

270
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:18,166
- I WON'T STOP TRYING.

271
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,208
- TRY ALL YOU WANT,
BUT ZALTI IS PREPARING

272
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:23,541
TO START THE MOON DRIP
CEREMONY AS WE SPEAK. 

273
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,833
- NATSU WON'T LET HIM.

274
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,208
TRUST ME,

275
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,875
THE SECOND YOU
UNDERESTIMATE THAT GUY

276
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,875
IS THE SECOND YOU LOSE.

277
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,083
- ( chuckles )
AT LONG LAST. 

278
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,958
- THERE YOU ARE!

279
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,916
I'LL BURN THAT GRIN
OFF YOUR FACE!

280
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,500
- ( laughs )

281
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,916
MUST HAVE TAKEN YOU A WHILE
TO COME UP WITH THAT ONE. 

282
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,666
BY THE WAY,
HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO FIND ME?

283
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,083
- I FOLLOWED MY NOSE,
THAT'S ALL.

284
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,208
FOR SOME REASON, YOU TOTALLY
REEK OF LADIES' PERFUME.

285
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:05,250
- ( laughs ) I WOULD
LOVE TO STAY AND CHAT,

286
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,750
BUT I'VE GOT MORE IMPORTANT
THINGS TO DO RIGHT NOW.

287
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,583
LIKE REVIVING DELIORA.

288
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:12,541
- JUST FORGET ABOUT THAT.
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN, OKAY?

289
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,750
- REALLY?
AND WHY IS THAT, PRAY TELL?

290
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:18,291
- 'CAUSE GRAY'S GONNA
KICK THAT ICE GUY'S BUTT.

291
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,708
AND ANY MINUTE NOW,
I'M GONNA KICK YOUR BUTT,

292
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,291
LIKE A BILLION TIMES.

293
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,250
AND THEN THIS
WILL ALL BE OVER.

294
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,708
- WE'LL JUST HAVE TO
SEE ABOUT THAT.

295
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,375
- HUH?
( gasps )

296
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,458
THAT'S MOONLIGHT.

297
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:33,333
THERE ARE PEOPLE UP THERE
DOING THE CEREMONY RIGHT NOW?

298
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,041
- ( meows )

299
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,708
- Zalti: ONLY ONE PERSON,

300
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:46,291
WHICH MEANS THE MOON DRIP ISN'T
TERRIBLY POWERFUL RIGHT NOW.

301
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,125
HOWEVER,
THAT'S HARDLY A CONCERN

302
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,625
SINCE WE'VE ALREADY
GATHERED PLENTY OF MOONLIGHT.

303
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,708
WE JUST NEED TO
GIVE IT A LITTLE NUDGE

304
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,916
TO FINISH THE JOB.
LIKE THIS.

305
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,750
- ( screams )
THIS CAN'T BE GOOD!

306
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,833
DELIORA'S ICE
IS MELTING LIKE CRAZY.

307
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,666
I GOTTA GO STOP THAT GUY
BEFORE THINGS GET UGLY. 

308
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,666
- ( chuckles )

309
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,208
- WHOA!

310
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:11,458
- SORRY,
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

311
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:14,916
LOOKS LIKE CHASING AFTER ME
WAS A MISTAKE, SALAMANDER. 

312
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,208
BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME, EH?

313
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,583
- COLD EMPEROR...

314
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,750
- EXCELLENT WORK.
LET'S HEAD TO THE TEMPLE.

315
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,916
- RIGHT.
- NO, WAIT.

316
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,041
- ( gasps )

317
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,333
- WE WON'T LET YOU INTERFERE

318
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,166
WITH THE COLD EMPEROR.

319
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,666
- THOSE HEADPIECES.

320
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,708
YOU PEOPLE ARE FROM
THE CITY OF BRAGO. 

321
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,333
AND YOU WANT REVENGE.

322
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,166
- ( screaming )

323
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,625
- ( sighs )
- ( laughs )

324
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,375
- YAH!

325
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,375
- ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

326
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:54,375
USING YOUR FIRE MAGIC
AT A TIME LIKE THIS? 

327
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:57,250
MIGHT MAKE THE ICE THAT'S
SEALING DELIORA MELT FASTER.

328
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,458
- IF IT COULD BE
MELTED BY FIRE MAGIC,

329
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,708
THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
GONE TO ALL THIS TROUBLE.

330
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,625
BLUFF ALL YOU WANT,
BUT ONCE I'M DONE HERE,

331
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,375
ALL I GOTTA DO
IS STOP THE MOON DRIP

332
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,041
AND IT'S GAME OVER.
- ( laughs )

333
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,541
I MUST SAY,
I TOOK YOU FOR A FOOL,

334
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:12,875
BUT WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE

335
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,250
IT SEEMS YOU'RE SURPRISINGLY
CLEVER, SALAMANDER.

336
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,250
- I GOT A BAD FEELING
THAT AIN'T NATSU.

337
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,875
- THE CEREMONY IS FINALLY
REACHING COMPLETION.

338
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:30,083
THE ICE SEALING DELIORA
HAS BEGUN TO MELT AWAY.

339
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,083
- UR...

340
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,000
- THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO.

341
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,416
IT'S TOO LATE
TO STOP ME.

342
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,583
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS
HAVE FAILED.

343
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,333
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW LONG I'VE WAITED

344
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,833
FOR THIS MOMENT, GRAY?

345
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,416
SINCE I SAW YOU LAST,
I'VE BEEN GATHERING KNOWLEDGE

346
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,166
AND ALLIES WHO
WILL AID ME.

347
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,833
I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH 
TO DISCOVER THIS PLACE.

348
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,416
AN ISLAND WHERE YOU CAN
COLLECT THE LIGHT OF THE MOON.

349
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,500
GALUNA.

350
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,041
- ( grunts )

351
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,416
- IT WASN'T AN EASY TASK

352
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,458
TRANSPORTING DELIORA
FROM BRAGO.

353
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,625
AND THE MOON DRIP'S
TAKEN THREE YEARS. 

354
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,291
- YOU'VE BEEN
WASTING YOUR TIME

355
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,541
ON THIS STUPID PLAN
FOR THREE YEARS?

356
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,458
- STUPID?!

357
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,208
HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT!

358
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,875
YOU'VE SPENT THE LAST 10 YEARS
IN SOME FOOLISH GUILD

359
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,250
PIDDLING YOUR LIFE AWAY!

360
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
- BECAUSE I PUT MY FAITH
IN WHAT UR TOLD ME.

361
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,041
- ( gasps )

362
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,875
- IN THE WESTERN COUNTRIES,

363
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,958
THERE ARE LOTS OF WIZARDS
WHO ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN ME.

364
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,458
- Gray: SO I WENT WEST

365
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,458
AND EVENTUALLY MADE IT
TO FAIRY TAIL.

366
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:35,041
AND SHE WAS RIGHT. THE GUILD WAS
SO FULL OF POWERFUL WIZARDS

367
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,583
THAT I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

368
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,458
- I DON'T THINK
I CAN HELP YOU.

369
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,166
THE ICED SHELL IS BASED
ON THE WILL OF ITS CASTER.

370
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,583
AND BECAUSE THAT WILL
IS ABSOLUTE,

371
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,500
A THIRD PARTY
CANNOT MELT THE ICE

372
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,083
NO MATTER WHAT MAGIC THEY USE.

373
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,666
- NO WAY.
YOU'RE TELLING ME

374
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,500
EVEN WITH ALL
THE STRONG WIZARDS YOU GOT,

375
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,916
YOU CAN'T BREAK THE SPELL?
- HMM...

376
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,416
ACTUALLY, NOW THAT
I THINK ABOUT IT, 

377
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,916
THERE MAY BE A WAY.

378
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,083
ON SECOND THOUGHT,
THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.

379
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,583
IF YOU WERE TO
MELT THE ICE, 

380
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,333
I'M AFRAID IT WOULD BE
NO DIFFERENT THAN

381
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:05,875
KILLING YOUR MASTER.

382
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,916
- I DIDN'T KNOW IT
AT THE TIME,

383
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,500
BUT I BET THE OLD MAN WAS
THINKING ABOUT THE MOON DRIP

384
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,416
WHEN HE SAID THAT.

385
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,666
AFTER EVERYTHING
UR DID FOR US,

386
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,750
YOU'D KILL HER WITHOUT
GIVING IT A SECOND THOUGHT.

387
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,166
YOU MAKE ME SICK.

388
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,625
- SAY WHAT YOU WILL.
I DON'T CARE.

389
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,125
MY ENTIRE LIFE HAS
LED UP TO THIS MOMENT.

390
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,291
OUR MASTER IS LONG DEAD.

391
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,125
IF WE WANT TO PROVE
THAT WE HAVE SURPASSED HER,

392
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,791
WHAT CAN WE DO 
IN HER ABSENCE?

393
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,375
THINK, GRAY.

394
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,958
THERE'S ONLY ONE ANSWER.
DELIORA.

395
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,041
I WILL SURPASS OUR MASTER

396
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,875
BY DEFEATING
WHAT SHE COULD NOT!

397
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:43,208
- WELL, I ADMIT THAT'S
A PRETTY AMBITIOUS PLAN,

398
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,875
BUT I CAN'T STOP THINKING
THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE

399
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,791
MISSED THE POINT
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY.

400
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:52,125
SOMEONE AS BLIND AS YOU
COULD NEVER BE BETTER THAN UR.

401
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:55,208
NOT IN A HUNDRED YEARS.
WAKE UP, LYON!

402
00:19:58,791 --> 00:19:59,875
- FOOLED YOU, DIDN'T I?

403
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,416
ICE MAKE: SNOW TIGER!

404
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:08,208
- ICE MAKE PRISON.

405
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,916
YOU SEE THIS, LYON?
THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE.

406
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,750
- WHAT?
- A BEAST IN A CAGE

407
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,291
LASHING OUT AT A WORLD
HE BARELY KNOWS.

408
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,625
- UTTER NONSENSE.

409
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,875
I'LL MAKE QUICK WORK
OF THAT SPELL OF YOURS.

410
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,750
( gasps )

411
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,583
- SINGLE-HANDED SPELL CASTING
IS TOO UNBALANCED.

412
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,166
YOUR CREATIONS
WILL LET YOU DOWN

413
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,166
WHEN YOU NEED THEM THE MOST.

414
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,958
ICE CANNON!

415
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:45,750
- AAH!

416
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,750
- UR TAUGHT US THAT,
REMEMBER?

417
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,875
- ( stammers )

418
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,250
GRAY...

419
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,500
- ( sighs )

420
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,416
( groans )

421
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,541
MAN, I SHOULD HAVE SEALED
THIS WOUND UP EARLIER.

422
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:16,541
- ( roars )

423
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:17,541
- ( screams )

424
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,041
- MY EARS WEREN'T
READY FOR THIS!

425
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,625
- THAT DOESN'T SOUND
TOO PROMISING.

426
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,416
- IT'S SO LOUD!

427
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,000
- ( whimpers )
- YES, IT'S FREE!

428
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,208
- THAT SOUND...

429
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,041
I COULD NEVER
FORGET THAT SOUND.

430
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,875
- ( Deliora roars )

431
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:03,000
- DELIORA.

432
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,666
- Gray: THEY DID IT.

433
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,875
THEY ACTUALLY REVIVED IT.

434
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,708
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
I CAN DO NOW.

435
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:13,541
ICED SHELL.

436
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,250
- ( theme music playing )

437
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,083
- ( singing in Japanese )

438
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,500
- Happy: PROFESSOR HAPPY'S
CLASS ABOUT "FAIRY TAIL." 

439
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,625
TODAY I'M GONNA TEACH YOU
ALL ABOUT ERZA,

440
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:54,125
THE ARMORED WIZARD.

441
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:55,791
SHE'S ALSO KNOWN AS TITANIA,

442
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:58,791
AND SHE HAS A REPUTATION
AS IMPRESSIVE AS HER WARDROBE.

443
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:01,208
SHE CAN CHANGE HER WEAPONS AND
HER ARMOR WHENEVER SHE WANTS.

444
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:02,791
SOME OF HER COSTUMES
ARE KIND OF WEIRD,

445
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,208
LIKE SWIMSUITS AND STUFF.

446
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:05,708
STILL, SHE'S REALLY STRONG,

447
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,375
EVEN IF SHE'S NOT
TOO GOOD AT LISTENING.

448
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:09,416
YAY!  THAT'S TODAY'S CLASS.

449
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,375
DISMISSED!  AYE!

450
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:15,333
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE, NATSU.

451
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:17,000
YOU ATE THAT FISH
I WAS SAVING, DIDN'T YOU?!

452
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:19,083
- HUH?  OH, I'M SORRY.
MY BAD.

453
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,000
I'LL CATCH YOU ANOTHER ONE
SOMETIME, OKAY?

454
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:22,416
- WHAT?!
DON'T EVEN BOTHER.

455
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,916
THIS FRIENDSHIP IS OVER.

456
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,666
- THAT'S TOO BAD.
I WAS GONNA THROW IN

457
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,083
SOME CATNIP TO
SWEETEN THE DEAL,

458
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,500
BUT IF YOU DON'T LIKE ME.

459
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,291
- WELL, I CAN ALWAYS
FORGIVE AND FORGET. 

460
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,500
- ARE YOU SURE?  YOU JUST SAID
DON'T EVEN BOTHER, DIDN'T YOU?

461
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:37,875
- I DON'T KNOW.
I TOLD YOU CATS HAVE

462
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:39,583
BAD SHORT-TERM MEMORIES.

463
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:41,125
- YOU'RE SO FULL OF IT.
