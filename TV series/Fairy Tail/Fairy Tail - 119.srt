[LAHARL]
Acnologia?

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,125
You're sure that's
what Zeref said?

3
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:25,916
You must be certain!

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,416
Damn, I'm useless.

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,291
How could I let myself
just get paralyzed by fear?

6
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:32,833
Hey, get a hold of yourself!

7
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,958
Are you absolutely sure
he said "Acnologia"!

8
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,625
Move! Prepare to withdraw!

9
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,833
All forces,
retreat at once!

10
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:46,458
As of this moment, our survey
of Tenrou Island is negated!

[CARLA]
Previously, on Fairy Tail.

[HAPPY]
Kaboom!

13
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:22,958
[PANTHERLILY] Would you
stop making that sound!

14
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,541
[HAPPY]
Sorry!

15
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,541
Now that Laxus is here I'm just
in that kind of mood, you know!

16
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,041
[CARLA]
That's a lie.

17
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,000
You're trying to take advantage
of Lily's fear of thunder.

18
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:30,958
[PANTHERLILY]
I fear nothing!

19
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,166
[HAPPY]
Kaboom!!!

20
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,750
[PANTHERLILY]
I said knock it off!

21
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:34,666
[HAPPY]
That's for Natsu becoming

22
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,458
a Lightning Flame Dragon.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,583
[DORANBOLT]
Was this really for the best?

24
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,083
Look, I know how
important the mission is.

25
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,416
However.

26
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,375
I'm also responsible for
the lives of our shipmates.

27
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,291
Retreat is the only option.

28
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,250
That's not what
I'm talking about.

29
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,291
We left so many people behind.

30
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,833
We could have easily pulled
them off of the island.

31
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,041
But instead.

32
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,458
I understand how you feel.

33
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,916
There was a time when
I thought the same way.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,875
But in the end
I realized how naïve I was

35
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,125
and justice demands that-

36
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,125
Oh cut the peace
and justice crap.

37
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,041
All we did here was run away!

38
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,416
It's obvious you're
not thinking logically.

39
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,375
If blaming me
will ease your guilt.

40
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,291
then by all means.

41
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,458
Take out
your frustrations

42
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,458
and be done with it.

43
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,541
No. It's just.

44
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,833
I don't know how
to make things right.

Slice!

47
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,208
How insulting.

48
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,541
Writing of that caliber
can't touch me!

49
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,291
[FRIED] Did you honestly believe
my talents were limited to only

50
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,041
defensive Enchantments?

[YOMAZU]
Say what!

00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,125
I guess Grimoire

00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,750
that it's cracked up to be.

You're welcome to try
something new, if you like.

Slice!

56
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,875
Perhaps writing
the character for 'learning'

57
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,000
will help you out.

00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,291
Your writing is now destroyed!

That arrogance is going
to get you killed someday.

61
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,791
Your Enchantments
have a fatal flaw.

62
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,500
They're long and complicated,
but my writing is simple

63
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,416
and versatile.

64
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,875
Allow me to demonstrate!

65
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,291
It's certainly
louder than the last one.

No, he broke through!

[YOMAZU]
Slice! Roar!

68
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,291
[YOMAZU]
"Roar" is a noun and a verb!

69
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,666
So not only does it
refer to the actual sound,

70
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,333
but it also means to
be heard far and wide!

71
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,541
[FRIED] You strengthened
one character with another.

72
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:34,916
Interesting.

I'll admit that I
underestimated your abilities.

74
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,291
But what you fail to realize,
is that true expression

75
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,458
derives from the
gathering of words into--

[YOMAZU]
Are we still fighting here?

that guy with a lecture?

At least he's
distracted for now right?

can be distracting, too.

We can't just
stand here doing nothing.

89
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,375
I know, but fighting that
big guy drained the last

90
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,000
of our magic power.

Yeah! Levy's got a point!

our strength back, pronto.

you're joking, Bro.

Thanks for the meal, birdbrain!

102
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,750
Now that I've eaten,
I feel like a man again!

103
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,958
I dunno if eating
lightning was a good idea.

104
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:15,000
I've never seen
anything like this before!

A Lightning Flame Dragon.

106

This is just like the
time he ate a shard of Etherion.

107
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:56,666
So now Natsu's able to use
Laxus' power and his attacks?

You shouldn't
push yourself, Elfman!

00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,583
You're gonna drop
dead if you keep this up.

116
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,583
[ELFMAN]
Like I care about that.

117
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,666
Even if I don't have
enough magic power left

118
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,250
for a full-body Take Over.

119
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,583
This one arm is
all I really need.

120
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,666
[ELFMAN] It's caused
a lot of pain, this arm.

121
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,083
It hurt Lisanna made Mira
cry, and it failed to protect

my partner when she needed it.

123
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,500
So, it may be pathetic,

124
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,833
but I'll put every bit of power
I have into it and beat these

We'll fight as one unit.

This is your chance
to make it up to Evergreen.

Are you done giving
yourself a pep talk?

impressed with your timing.

00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:27,250
Finish him off for me would you?

big brother ever!

Oh, wow!

00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,916
Thank your lucky stars
we didn't have to fight him

00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,208
during the first
part of the trial.

[FRIED] It appears we've
successfully defended everyone.

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,125
[BIXLOW] I could sleep
for a week after that.

[ELFMAN]
No kiddin'.

154
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,208
I could definitely use
a nap right about now.

155
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:59,083
This is what happens to anyone
who messes with Fairy Tail!

156
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,500
I'll make you pay!

157
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:20,166
Now say, Good bye!

00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,166
Oh, man!
That can't be good.

163
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,916
Natsu.
Don't die on us.

164
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,583
I warned ya
not to mess with us.

165
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:04,875
[LUCY]
Natsu!

166
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,541
Thanks.
That was a close one.

167
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,375
I don't suppose you have any
food tucked away in that outfit,

168
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,750
do ya?

169
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,166
[ERZA] If I used that much
magic power in one go.

170
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,333
I would be toppling over, too.

171
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,041
Another one bites the dust!

172
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,625
We won!

173
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,083
Maybe the power
source is super small

174
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,500
and we just missed it.

175
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,541
Given the size of the ship,
I would say it's highly

176
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,458
unlikely it's being powered
by anything that small.

177
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,250
Is there a reason we're
crawling through the ductwork?

178
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,375
Don't look at me!

179
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,250
Why don't you ask
our fearless leader?

180
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,666
Just a feeling I have.

181
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,750
You'll feel my fist next!

182
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,291
Geez, You could
at least give us a warning

183
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,041
before you stop.

184
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,208
Lily.

185
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,500
What now?

186
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,708
Did you touch it?

187
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,000
Huh?

188
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,833
Carla bopped into my butt,
which means you must've

189
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,166
gotten a face full
of her cushy tushie.

190
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,458
It's not my fault!

191
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,083
You're the one who stopped
without any warning!

192
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,166
[HAPPY] Oh, so it's my fault
that you couldn't stop yourself

193
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,291
from copping a feel?

194
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:27,291
Lily. Prepare to die!

195
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,291
Would you quit acting
like a child and focus

196
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,541
on the mission at hand?

197
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,166
Besides, it's not
even a big deal!

198
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,833
It might not be a big deal
to you, but it is to me!

199
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,500
I challenge you to a duel!

200
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,541
Would you
Knock it off already!

201
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,000
[CARLA] What made you stop
in the first place, Happy?

202
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,375
Did you see something?

203
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,791
[HAPPY]
Yeah, I did!

204
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,375
Do either of you know
what that thing is?

205
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,416
It's alive!

206
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,250
[HADES] You may have knocked
me down, but I'm not out.

207
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,041
[HADES]
Well done, Makarov.

208
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,541
You've raised some truly
remarkable children despite

209
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,291
your flawed philosophy.

210
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:18,291
There's no way.

211
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,583
[HADES] I can't remember the
last time someone left me

212
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,333
tattered and torn
after a good brawl.

213
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,208
How is he standing?!

214
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,416
[HADES] I appreciate the
entertainment but I must

215
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,083
get back to work.

216
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,291
I'll be obliterating you now.

217
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:41,041
Believe me, you'll wish
I'd done so sooner.

218
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:44,416
What kind of monster could
survive such a powerful attack?

219
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,666
[HADES]
Devil's Eye...

220
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,291
...open.

221
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,875
[HADES] You will now
witness something you've

222
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,625
never seen before.

223
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,291
[HADES]
The Abyss of Sorcery.

224
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,291
[HADES] From here extends an
endless realm that surpasses

225
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,833
your feeble imaginations.

226
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,250
Do you feel that?

227
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,416
It's not real.

228
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,291
No, It can't be!

229
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,333
I've never sensed this much
power in one place before!

230
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,541
And it's getting
bigger by the second!

231
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,875
I am the harbinger of
Fairy Tail's last breath.

232
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,833
You okay?!

233
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:30,083
[NATSU] No. I've used
up all my strength.

234
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,416
That last attack did me in.

235
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,500
Do you think that's it?

236
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,333
Well, It doesn't really
look like a power source

237
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:39,541
but who knows?

238
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,583
That's gotta be
the power source.

239
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,583
It's like the heart
of the ship itself.

240
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,916
[PANTHERLILY] Maybe that's
The "Grimoire Heart."

241
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,583
[GRIMOIRE SOLDIER 119A]
I heard voices inside!

242
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,625
[GRIMOIRE SOLDIER 119B]
Don't be ridiculous!

243
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,708
How could anyone get in there?

244
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:53,791
Oh no!
They found us!

245
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,333
I'll try to keep
them occupied.

246
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:58,375
You two hurry and put that
thing out of commission!

247
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,333
[HAPPY]
Any ideas?

248
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,000
[CARLA]
Break it, of course!

249
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,625
[GRIMOIRE SOLDIER 119A] How the
hell did a cat get in here?

250
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:07,291
[GRIMOIRE SOLDIER 119B]
Who cares?

251
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,250
Just stomp it.

252
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,416
Stomp this!

253
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:12,750
[GRIMOIRE SOLDIER 119A]
You little fleabag!

254
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,250
Now you're askin' for it!

255
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,333
[GRIMOIRE SOLDIER 119B]
How'd he get so big?

256
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,208
[GRIMOIRE SOLDIER 119C]
Get him!

257
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,083
[PANTHERLILY]
How generous.

258
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,750
[GRIMOIRE SOLDIER 119D]
But that's my sword!

259
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,333
How're we supposed to break
something that big on our own!

260
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,166
[CARLA] I guess we're just gonna
have to fiddle with things

261
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,541
at random.

262
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,833
[PANTHERLILY] Well this
is certainly unexpected.

263
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,791
I never thought I'd find
a size-changing sword

264
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,083
outside of Edolas.

265
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,458
[GRIMOIRE SOLDIER 119A]
Defend the heart!

266
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,625
[GRIMOIRE SOLDIER 119B] We can't
let him do any more damage!

267
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:55,833
I Think I'll keep it.

268
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,125
I could use a
replacement for Bustermarm.

269
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,666
[GRIMOIRE SOLDIER 119D]
Aw, c'mon man,

270
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,250
I spent four months pay
on that Musica sword!

271
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,625
[PANTHERLILY]
Bring it on!

272
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:12,625
Hang on, Happy.

273
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,125
This isn't
over just yet!

274
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,958
Why does everything
we do involve hurting!

275
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,333
Come! Face your death!

276
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,458
[HAPPY] That's it, next time
Natsu wants something destroyed

277
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,750
he can handle it himself.

278
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,708
The Abyss of Sorcery.

279
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,708
Yes. Its power is
overwhelming.

280
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,958
Hey! Snap out
of it. Come on!

281
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:07,791
No. I can't
I'm out of power.

282
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,583
In order to walk the
path of sorcery one must

283
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:15,333
sink into its abyss
of eternal darkness.

284
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:18,166
Within that darkness
lies primordial magic

285
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,625
that shines like the heavens.

286
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,000
The purest of magic power!

287
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,666
[HADES]
Can you feel it?

288
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,791
The primordial magic is
so close it's palpable.

289
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,625
Yet it's so far in the depths it
may as well be out of reach.

290
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,041
Within those depths
is a lost world.

291
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,041
The Grand Magic World!

292
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,291
[HADES] And Zeref is
the key to reaching it.

293
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,416
[HADES] Tonight, Zeref
will awaken and history

294
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,000
will forever be altered.

295
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,333
And then at long last,
the primordial magics.

296
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:54,500
Will find their
rightful place with me!

297
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,750
We cannot
allow that to happen.

298
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:01,416
[LUCY] I know I've heard about
this "primordial magic" before.

299
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,708
Mom?

300
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,708
But you will be ostracized.

301
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:08,083
Only the strong will
be allowed to live.

302
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:11,166
And you lack the resolve
necessary to reach

303
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,416
into the abyss.

304
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,166
Things are about
to get way worse.

305
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,666
[HADES]
Chapter four.

306
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,250
Verse twelve,
from the Book of Zeref.

307
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,708
Arcane Magic. Nemesis!

308
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:42,041
No! He's creating some kinda
monsters from the debris!

309
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:46,208
[HADES] With the magic power
of the Abyss at my command.

310
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:50,000
I can create nightmares from
the tiniest speck of dust.

311
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,750
[HADES] Devilish dancers
and heavenly arbiters.

312
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:56,208
Such is the supremacy
of Arcane Magic!

313
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,625
[ERZA] Each one of these demons
is overwhelmingly lethal

314
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,166
in their own right.

315
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,166
How do you kill
pure magic power?

316
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,875
[WENDY]
I'm scared.

317
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,416
Someone, please!

318
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,666
Make them go away!

319
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,250
[ERZA]
I can't stop shaking.

320
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:22,875
Is this what terror feels like?

321
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:26,333
[GRAY]
Why do I feel so afraid?

322
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,666
Snap out of it!

323
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,250
[LUCY]
We're done for.

324
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,708
I've never felt so helpless.

325
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,625
It's like all of my
courage has faded away.

326
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,541
[LUCY]
Natsu!

327
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:46,833
[NATSU]
Don't worry.

328
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,541
We've got everything
we need to beat this guy

329
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,750
right here with us.

330
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,375
There's nothing
wrong with fear.

331
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,750
After all.

332
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:59,375
How else would we come
to know our own weaknesses?

333
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,083
[GILDARTS and NATSU]
And you need to know them.

334
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:04,041
to become a stronger
and gentler person.

335
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:16,375
[NATSU] Today we learned
just how weak we really are.

336
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,416
[NATSU]
So what do we do next?

337
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,166
[NATSU]
I'll tell you.

338
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,916
We grow stronger!

339
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:31,833
[NATSU] On our own we might be
too afraid to stand up to him.

340
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:35,166
[NATSU] But right now, we
have our friends by our side.

341
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,625
I still have courage because
you're all here with me!

342
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,375
There's no reason to be afraid!

343
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:47,083
When we're together we
can accomplish anything!

344
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,041
[HADES]
Still holding onto the light?

345
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,250
You fools!

346
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,791
Your future is
nothing but darkness.

347
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,125
[ERZA]
Our friends are by our side.

348
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,625
[GRAY] There's no
reason to be afraid.

349
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,208
[LUCY]
You've given me hope, Natsu.

350
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:06,916
[WENDY] Even if we have
no magic power left.

351
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,416
[ERZA] We'll keep fighting
until our last breath.

352
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,166
[ERZA] Because that's
the Fairy Tail way!

353
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,291
Let's go!

354
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,708
What could you possibly hope
to do without any magic power?

355
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:35,958
Now dance!

356
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,708
My devils of the earth!

357
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:30,541
[HADES] I shall send you
into the depths of darkness!

358
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:32,583
It's time for
your sun to set.

359
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,125
Fairy Tail!

360
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:13,583
[HAPPY]
Go, Natsu!

361
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:14,958
You can take that geezer out!

362
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:16,833
[NATSU] Don't worry, I'm
gonna make sure he regrets

363
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:18,958
even thinking about
messing with Fairy Tail!

364
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:19,791
[HAPPY]
Aye!

365
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:20,375
So how are you gonna do it?

366
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:21,458
What's the plan!

367
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:22,666
[NATSU]
Plan?

368
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,083
There's only one plan
at a time like this!

369
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:24,916
[HAPPY]
You mean.

370
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,250
[NATSU]
Uh-huh!

371
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,125
The good ol' "Take 'em
by Storm" plan, of course!

372
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,708
[HAPPY] I should've guessed
it wouldn't be original.

373
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:33,958
[HAPPY] Next time:
"Daybreak on Tenrou Island"!

374
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,041
[NATSU] Awwwww yeah,
I'm all fired up!

375
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,875
It's good to be the Salamander!

376
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:39,125
[HAPPY]
Get a grip, will you?

377
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:41,208
[NATSU]
Huh? Oh. Sorry.
