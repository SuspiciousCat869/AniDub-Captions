00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:20,708
- Narrator: IN A LAND
FAR, FAR AWAY

2
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:23,041
LIES THE KINGDOM
OF FIORE,

3
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:26,208
A SMALL, PEACEFUL NATION
OF 17 MILLION,

4
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,791
AND A PLACE FILLED
WITH MAGIC.

5
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,291
FOUND IN EVERY HOME,

6
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,041
BOUGHT AND SOLD
IN EVERY MARKETPLACE.

7
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,375
FOR MOST MAGIC IS
MERELY A TOOL,

8
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,958
A MUNDANE PART
OF EVERYDAY LIFE.

9
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,333
FOR SOME, HOWEVER,
MAGIC IS AN ART,

10
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:42,416
AND THEY'VE DEVOTED
THEIR LIVES TO ITS PRACTICE.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,666
THESE ARE THE WIZARDS.

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,833
BANDED TOGETHER INTO
MAGICAL GUILDS,

13
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:50,416
THEY PLY THEIR SKILLS
IN SEARCH OF FAME AND FORTUNE.

14
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,375
MANY SUCH GUILDS DOT
THE LANDSCAPE OF FIORE.

15
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:57,416
BUT THERE IS A CERTAIN GUILD
IN A CERTAIN TOWN

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,750
THAT SOARS HIGH
ABOVE THE REST.

17
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,583
ONE FROM WHICH COUNTLESS LEGENDS
HAVE BEEN BORN.

18
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:05,750
A GUILD THAT WILL NO DOUBT
CONTINUE TO CREATE LEGENDS

19
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,416
WELL INTO THE FUTURE.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,375
ITS NAME IS FAIRY TAIL.

21
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,916
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

22
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:47,666
- Narrator: THIS IS THE
PORT TOWN OF HARGEON.

23
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,250
- ( muttering )
- EXCUSE ME, SIR?

24
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,500
- NATSU, WE MADE IT TO HARGEON.

25
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,458
COME ON, GET UP ALREADY.

26
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,250
- IS HE ALL RIGHT?
- HE'S FINE.

27
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,916
THIS ALWAYS HAPPENS
WHEN HE TRAVELS.

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,791
- NEVER-- I'M NEVER RIDING
A STUPID TRAIN AGAIN.

29
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,083
- IF OUR INFORMATION'S CORRECT,
THAN WE SHOULD FIND

30
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,875
THAT SALAMANDER SOMEWHERE
IN THIS TOWN.

31
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:10,208
LET'S GO. - JUST GIVE ME
A SECOND, WOULD YOU?

32
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,666
- ( train whistles )

33
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,625
- NO!

34
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,583
NO!

35
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,833
- ( train whistles )

36
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:24,125
- UH-OH, THERE HE GOES.

37
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,958
- ( guitar plays )

38
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:30,125
- Happy: "THE FAIRY TAIL."

39
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:34,000
- ( crowd mutters )
- LUCY: WHAT?!

40
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,500
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THERE'S
ONLY ONE MAGIC SHOP

41
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,000
IN THIS WHOLE TOWN?

42
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,666
- 'FRAID SO. THE PEOPLE AROUND
HERE ARE MORE FISHING FOLK

43
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,791
THAN THEY ARE MAGIC FOLK.

44
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,166
I RECKON
MOST PEOPLE IN TOWN

45
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,875
DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO USE MAGIC.

46
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,583
I BUILT THIS SHOP
TO SELL TO THE WIZARDS

47
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,333
WHO HAPPEN TO BE
PASSING THROUGH.

48
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,291
- OH, MAN. I CAME OUT ALL
THIS WAY FOR NOTHING.

49
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,416
- NOW, NOW, DON'T SAY THAT,
LITTLE LADY.

50
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,541
I HAVE ALL THE LATEST GOODS.
LET ME SHOW YOU A FEW.

51
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,541
THIS COLORS MAGIC
IS POPULAR.

52
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,791
ALL THE YOUNG GIRLS
REALLY SEEM TO LIKE IT.

53
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,333
IT LETS YOU CHANGE THE COLOR OF
YOUR CLOTHES ANYTIME YOU WANT.

54
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:10,708
PURPLE.
- I ALREADY HAVE ONE OF THOSE.

55
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:14,125
WHAT I REALLY WANT ARE SOME
POWERFUL GATEKEYS. - NOW GREEN.

56
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,958
- ( gasps ) - GATEKEYS, HUH?
THAT'S A RARE REQUEST.

57
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,458
- OW, WOW, IT'S THE
LITTLE DOGGIE! - ( barking )

58
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,166
- YES, BUT THAT ONE'S
NOT VERY POWERFUL, YOU KNOW.

59
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,333
- I KNOW, BUT I REALLY,
REALLY WANT IT.

60
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:27,333
SO HOW MUCH?
- 20,000 JEWEL.

61
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,666
- I'M SORRY, BUT HOW MUCH
WAS THAT AGAIN?

62
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,333
- I SAID 20,000 JEWEL.

63
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:34,791
- ( coin drops )

64
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,833
- AW, COME ON.
HOW MUCH IS IT REALLY WORTH?

65
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,708
SURELY, YOU CAN
CUT ME A DEAL. 

66
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:45,750
- ( muttering )
- ( huffs )

67
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,708
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE ONLY
KNOCKED OFF A THOUSAND JEWEL.

68
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,625
THAT STUBBORN OLD GEEZER
MUST BE BLIND.

69
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,500
THAT TRICK USUALLY WORKS.

70
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,833
SO MUCH FOR USING 
MY FEMININE WILES.

71
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:59,291
( girls chattering )

72
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:02,000
- Girl #1: ARE YOU SERIOUS?
HE'S REALLY HERE? 

73
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,500
- Girl #2: IT'S SALAMANDER!

74
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,208
- SALAMANDER?
( gasps )

75
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,291
AS IN THE WIZARD
WHO USES FIRE MAGIC

76
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,458
YOU CAN'T EVEN
BUY IN STORES?  WOW!

77
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:12,250
- ( cheering )
- HE'S IN THIS DEAD-END TOWN?

78
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,666
- ( groans )
MAN.

79
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,333
I WOUND UP RIDING
THE TRAIN TWICE. 

80
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,250
- YOU'VE GOT TO GET OVER
THAT MOTION SICKNESS.

81
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,958
- NOW I'M SO HUNGRY
I COULD EAT MY HAND. 

82
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,708
-  IT'S TOO BAD WE DON'T
HAVE ANY MONEY FOR FOOD.

83
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,125
- HEY, HAPPY.

84
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,833
THIS SALAMANDER
WE'RE LOOKING FOR

85
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,583
HAS GOT TO BE IGNEEL, RIGHT?

86
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,708
- AYE, IT HAS TO BE
BECAUSE THE ONLY FIRE DRAGON

87
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,333
I'VE EVER HEARD OF
IS IGNEEL.

88
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,625
- THAT'S TRUE.

89
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,083
- ( girls cheering )
- SALAMANDER!

90
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,166
- YOU'RE SO DREAMY!
- AND SO HOT!

91
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,000
- Both: SALAMANDER?

92
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:41,208
- HA! WELL, SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.
WE'RE IN LUCK TODAY, HAPPY.

93
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,208
- AYE!
- ( laughs )

94
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,041
- ( chuckles )

95
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:47,875
- ( screaming )
- ISN'T HE HANDSOME?

96
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,250
- ( screaming )
- HE'S SO COOL!

97
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,833
- ( heart beats )
- ( chattering ) 

98
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,583
- Lucy: WHY IS MY HEART
BEATING SO FAST?

99
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,625
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO ME
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

100
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,875
- YOU LADIES
ARE ALL SO SWEET.

101
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,208
- ( gasps )

102
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,916
HE LOOKED AT ME!

103
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,458
IS IT 'CAUSE
HE'S A FAMOUS WIZARD?

104
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,500
IS THAT WHY MY HEART'S
THROBBING OUT OF CONTROL?

105
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,041
( gasps )

106
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,708
COULD IT BE?  AM I IN LOVE?
- IGNEEL!  IGNEEL!

107
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,791
- IS HE THE ONE?
- IGNEEL, IT'S ME!

108
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:19,708
- ( gasps )

109
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,416
- Natsu:
WHO THE HECK ARE YOU?

110
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,708
- WHO AM I?!

111
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,958
I'M SALAMANDER.

112
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,541
SURELY YOU'VE
HEARD OF ME BEFORE.

113
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,041
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE!

114
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,833
- Girl #9: YOU'RE SO RUDE!

115
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,500
- Girl #10: SALAMANDER'S
A GREAT WIZARD.

116
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:33,833
YOU BETTER APOLOGIZE TO HIM

117
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:34,916
OR WE'RE GONNA RIP
YOU TO SHREDS.

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,708
- WHAT IS IT
WITH YOU GIRLS?

119
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,625
- NOW, NOW, THAT'S ENOUGH,
MY LOVELIES.  LET HIM GO.

120
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,041
I'M SURE THE POOR BOY DIDN'T
MEAN ANYTHING MALICIOUS BY IT.

121
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:45,333
- ( girls coo )
- SALAMANDER!

122
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,000
- AND HERE'S MY AUTOGRAPH, KID.

123
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,208
NOW YOU CAN BRAG TO ALL
YOUR FRIENDS. - NO, THANKS.

124
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:50,708
- ( growling )

125
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,416
- ( groaning )
- GUESS IT WASN'T HIM AFTER ALL.

126
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,125
- DEFINITELY NOT HIM.

127
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,500
- WELL, I'M AFRAID
I MUST BE GOING, LADIES.

128
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,500
I HAVE BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO.
- All: YOU'RE LEAVING ALREADY?!

129
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,375
- TIME FOR THE RED CARPET.

130
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:04,875
HA!

131
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,625
- ( girls cheer )

132
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,250
- I'M HAVING A SOIREE
ON MY YACHT TONIGHT.

133
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:14,333
AND YOU'RE ALL INVITED.
- ( girls chattering ) 

134
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,750
- WHO THE HECK
WAS THAT GUY? 

135
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,166
- Lucy: I DON'T KNOW,
BUT HE WAS A REAL CREEP.

136
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,375
- HUH?
- HMM?

137
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:22,625
- THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.
- UH...

138
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,500
- ( cuckoo clock chirps )

139
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,083
- AND THEN...

140
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,958
- MY NAME IS LUCY.
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

141
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,083
- Happy: HI.

142
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,916
- ( slurping )
( gulping )

143
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,833
( chewing loudly )
- UH...

144
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:37,333
UM, NATSU AND HAPPY, WAS IT?
- HM-HMM, YOU'RE SO NICE.

145
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,625
- THANKS.  YOU CAN SLOW DOWN.
WE'RE NOT IN A HURRY.

146
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,583
AND FOOD IS KINDA 
FLYING EVERYWHERE.

147
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,541
THERE GOES THE MONEY I SAVED
AT THAT OLD GEEZER'S SHOP.

148
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,291
EVIDENTLY, THAT SALAMANDER GUY

149
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,958
WAS USING MAGIC, A CHARM SPELL,
TO HYPNOTIZE THE LADIES

150
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,916
IN TOWN INTO THINKING
THEY WERE IN LOVE WITH HIM.

151
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,583
CHARM SPELLS HAVE THE POWER

152
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,041
TO ATTRACT PEOPLE TO YOU
AGAINST THEIR OWN WILL, 

153
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,875
BUT THEY'VE BEEN 
BANNED FOR YEARS.

154
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,208
NOBODY EVEN SELLS THEM
ANYMORE.

155
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,875
HE MUST HAVE GONE THROUGH
A LOT OF TROUBLE

156
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,875
TO GET HIS HANDS ON IT.
WHAT A CREEP.

157
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,666
I TOTALLY FELL VICTIM
TO HIS SPELL,

158
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,875
BUT I SNAPPED OUT IF IT 
THANKS TO YOU

159
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,375
BARGING IN WHEN YOU DID.

160
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,291
I REALLY CAN'T
THANK YOU GUYS ENOUGH.

161
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,166
- NO PROBLEM.
- I KNOW I MAY NOT LOOK LIKE IT,

162
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,333
BUT I'M A WIZARD TOO.
- IS THAT SO?

163
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,625
- YEAH, BUT I HAVEN'T JOINED
A GUILD YET OR ANYTHING.

164
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,000
OH, I SHOULD
PROBABLY EXPLAIN, HUH?

165
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,958
SEE, GUILDS ARE
THESE ORGANIZATIONS

166
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,416
WHERE WIZARDS COME TOGETHER
TO SHARE INFORMATION,

167
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,458
AND FIND WORK,
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

168
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,958
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU AREN'T
CONSIDERED A FULL-FLEDGED WIZARD

169
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,583
UNTIL YOU BECOME
A MEMBER OF A GUILD.

170
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,625
BUT THERE ARE TONS OF THEM
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

171
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,541
I'VE HEARD IT'S REALLY TOUGH TO
GET INTO THE MORE POPULAR ONES.

172
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,208
AND THE GUILD I WANT TO JOIN IS
THE MOST POPULAR ONE THERE IS. 

173
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,875
( sighs ) YEAH...

174
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,208
THEY'RE THE GREATEST AND
THEY'RE ALWAYS FEATURED 

175
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,791
IN "SORCERER WEEKLY."

176
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,458
OH, IF I COULD ACTUALLY
CONVINCE THEM TO LET ME IN,

177
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,500
I THINK I'D JUST ABOUT DIE.
- YEAH?

178
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,833
- OH, I'M SORRY.
I GUESS ALL THIS WIZARDING TALK

179
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,125
MUST SOUND LIKE A BUNCH
OF GIBBERISH TO YOU, HUH?

180
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,416
BUT I'M TELLING YOU,

181
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,166
I'M DEFINITELY GONNA JOIN
THAT GUILD SOMEDAY.

182
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,625
AND THEN I'M GONNA TAKE
ALL KINDS OF EXCITING JOBS

183
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,166
AND MAKE TONS OF MONEY.
- OH, YEAH?

184
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,916
- YOU TALK A LOT.
- UH...

185
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,750
OH, MAN, I ALMOST FORGOT.

186
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,875
YOU GUYS CAME HERE TRYING
TO FIND SOMEBODY, DIDN'T YOU?

187
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,375
- WE'RE LOOKING FOR IGNEEL.

188
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,791
- WE HEARD A RUMOR
THAT A SALAMANDER 

189
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,541
WAS GONNA BE COMING
THROUGH THIS TOWN,

190
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,333
SO WE CAME HERE TO SEE HIM.
TURNS OUT, IT WAS SOMEBODY ELSE.

191
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,958
- YEAH, THAT GUY DIDN'T LOOK
LIKE A SALAMANDER AT ALL.

192
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,583
- NO KIDDING.  I BET THAT POSER
CAN'T EVEN BREATHE FIRE

193
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,375
LIKE A REAL DRAGON.
- UH, I DON'T GET IT.

194
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,333
YOUR FRIEND IGNEEL
LOOKS LIKE A DRAGON?

195
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,125
- NO, YOU GOT IT ALL WRONG.
HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A DRAGON.

196
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,208
HE IS ONE.

197
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,916
- ( roars )

198
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,875
- HUH?
- AYE, IGNEEL...

199
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,208
IS A REAL-LIFE FIRE DRAGON.
- HUH?!

200
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,166
- Narrator: EVEN IN THIS
MAGNIFICENT WORLD OF MAGIC,

201
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,416
DRAGONS ARE CONSIDERED
EXTRAORDINARY,

202
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,875
MYSTICAL CREATURES.

203
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,791
THEY ARE RARELY SEEN
BY THE HUMAN EYE.

204
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,208
- WHY WOULD A FIRE DRAGON
SHOW UP IN THE MIDDLE OF TOWN?!

205
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,416
- Both: UH...

206
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,708
- IT'S TOTALLY RIDICULOUS!

207
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,166
WELL, I SHOULD GET GOING.

208
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,958
ENJOY THE REST OF YOUR LUNCH.

209
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,708
AND MAYBE I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

210
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,416
- THANK YOU, MA'AM.
PLEASE COME AGAIN.

211
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,625
OH!
- ( awkward laugh )

212
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,000
- THANK YOU FOR THE FOOD!
- THANK YOU!

213
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,083
- CUT IT OUT!
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME!

214
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,375
LOOK, IT'S COOL.

215
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,083
YOU GUYS HELPED
ME OUT EARLIER.

216
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,208
SO LET'S JUST CALL IT EVEN.
- I FEEL BAD, THOUGH,

217
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,833
'CAUSE WE WEREN'T EVEN
TRYING TO HELP HER.

218
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,083
- AYE, WE OWE HER SOMETHING.

219
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,916
- OH, I KNOW!

220
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,291
HERE, THIS IS FOR YOU.

221
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,291
- NO WAY!

222
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,375
- ( cawing )

223
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,041
- Narrator:
THIS IS THE WIZARDING MAGAZINE,

224
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,250
"SORCERER WEEKLY."
- OH MY.

225
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,041
LOOKS LIKE THE FAIRY TAIL
GUILD'S OUT THERE

226
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,458
CAUSING TROUBLE AGAIN.

227
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,875
"DEMON BANDIT CLAN
WIPED OUT,

228
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,208
BUT SEVEN HOMES DESTROYED."
( laughs )

229
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,083
TALK ABOUT GOING OVERBOARD.

230
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,416
THE CENTERFOLD'S MIRAJANE.

231
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,083
SHE'S SO PRETTY.

232
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,750
I WISH I KNEW HOW
TO GET TO BE A MEMBER.

233
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,541
DO YOU HAVE TO APPLY
OR MAYBE INTERVIEW WITH THEM?

234
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,541
I DON'T KNOW.

235
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,166
BUT I'M SO GONNA
JOIN FAIRY TAIL!

236
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,291
THEY'RE TOTALLY
THE COOLEST GUILD EVER!

237
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,416
- ( giggles )
- Salamander: WHAT WAS THAT?

238
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,333
YOU WANT TO JOIN FAIRY TAIL?

239
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:51,875
- SALAMANDER! - I'VE BEEN
LOOKING ALL OVER FOR YOU.

240
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,333
I WANTED TO PERSONALLY 
INVITE YOU TO THE PARTY

241
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,250
I'M HAVING ON
MY YACHT TONIGHT.

242
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,166
- YOUR CHARM SPELL
WON'T WORK ON ME. 

243
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,208
THAT MAGIC'S WEAKNESS
IS AWARENESS.

244
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,958
IT DOESN'T WORK ON PEOPLE
IF THEY KNOW YOU'RE USING IT.

245
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,250
- JUST AS I THOUGHT.
I GUESSED YOU WERE A WIZARD

246
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,000
THE MOMENT
I LAID EYES ON YOU.

247
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,291
NO MATTER.  THE INVITATION
STILL STANDS.

248
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,708
- WELL, YOU CAN FORGET IT.

249
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:11,958
I WOULDN'T BE CAUGHT
DEAD AT A PARTY

250
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,666
BEING THROWN
BY A CREEP LIKE YOU.

251
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,125
- A CREEP?  WHY WOULD
YOU CALL ME A THAT? 

252
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,250
- YOUR SPELL. USING IT TO
MAKE YOURSELF POPULAR.

253
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,666
- DON'T BE MAD, MY DEAR.
IT'S ALL IN GOOD FUN.

254
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,708
I JUST WANTED TO
FEEL LIKE A CELEBRITY

255
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,208
AT MY OWN PARTY.
CAN YOU BLAME ME?

256
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,375
- THIS JUST PROVES THAT
EVEN FAMOUS WIZARDS

257
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,333
CAN BE BIG IDIOTS.

258
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:30,750
- YOU WISH TO JOIN
THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD, RIGHT?

259
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,166
- ( gasps )

260
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,916
- HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
ABOUT SALAMANDER,

261
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,625
ONE OF FAIRY TAIL'S WIZARDS?

262
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,500
- WELL, YEAH.
YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU'RE HIM?

263
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,125
YOU'RE <i>THAT</i> SALAMANDER?!

264
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,416
- THAT'S CORRECT.
AND IF YOU WANT TO JOIN,

265
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,291
I COULD PROBABLY PUT IN
A GOOD WORD FOR YOU.

266
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,166
- ( gasping )

267
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,541
- I WOULD LOVE TO GO
TO YOUR PARTY TONIGHT.

268
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,083
( giggles )
- WOW, THAT WAS EVEN EASIER

269
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,125
THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

270
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,708
- SO, YOU REALLY THINK

271
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,041
YOU COULD GET ME INTO
FAIRY TAIL? NO KIDDING?

272
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,541
- I DON'T SEE WHY NOT,
BUT YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING

273
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,458
ABOUT THE CHARM SPELL.

274
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,125
- I WON'T SAY A WORD.
- GOOD.

275
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,833
THEN I'LL SEE YOU
AT THE PARTY TONIGHT.

276
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,625
- YOU GOT IT,
MR. SALAMANDER, SIR.

277
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,333
HE GOT ME.
I WAS PSEUDO-CHARMED.

278
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,708
BUT...

279
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,000
HOORAY!

280
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,125
HE'S GONNA GET ME
INTO FAIRY TAIL!

281
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,708
I JUST HAVE TO KEEP
MY MOUTH SHUT

282
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,166
AND TRY TO BE NICE
TO THAT SLEAZEBAG UNTIL THEN.

283
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,083
( giggles )

284
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,250
- THAT WAS QUITE A MEAL,
HEY, HAPPY?

285
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,083
- AYE.

286
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,958
HEY, LOOK, DO YOU THINK
THAT'S THE BOAT

287
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,166
WHERE THAT SALAMANDER GUY
IS HAVING HIS PARTY?

288
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,875
- ( gags )
I'M GONNA HURL.

289
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,583
- OH, COME ON.
IT'S NOT LIKE 

290
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,291
WE'RE GOING ABOARD OR ANYTHING.
- Girl #11: OH MY GOSH!

291
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,958
THAT'S SALAMANDER'S YACHT,
ISN'T IT?

292
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,083
- I WISH I COULD HAVE
GONE TO HIS PARTY.

293
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,583
- WHO'S SALAMANDER? - WHOA,
YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF HIM?

294
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,500
HE'S A SUPER FAMOUS WIZARD
WHO'S IN TOWN RIGHT NOW.

295
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,500
- YEAH, AND HE'S A MEMBER
OF FAIRY TAIL.

296
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:55,833
- HUH?

297
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,791
FAIRY TAIL?

298
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:01,875
( gags )
OH, NO. 

299
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,375
SO HE'S IN FAIRY TAIL, IS HE?

300
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,083
- Salamander:
IT'S LUCY, RIGHT?

301
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:12,458
THAT'S A LOVELY NAME.
- YEAH, THANKS.

302
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,958
- I'D LIKE TO
TOAST YOUR BEAUTY.

303
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:20,625
NOW, OPEN UP WIDE, LUCY.

304
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,666
SAVOR THE TASTE
OF EACH FLAVORFUL DROP

305
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,750
AS IT ENTERS YOUR MOUTH.

306
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,750
- CREEPY!

307
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,625
I'M STRONG.
I CAN GET THROUGH THIS.

308
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:33,208
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

309
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,750
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE UP TO.

310
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,583
YOU'RE TRYING TO USE
SLEEP MAGIC.

311
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,916
- ( chuckles )
VERY IMPRESSIVE, MY DEAR.

312
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,125
- LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO 
GIVE YOU THE WRONG IDEA.

313
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,833
YES, I REALLY WANT TO JOIN
THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD,

314
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,750
BUT I'M NOT GONNA DATE YOU
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

315
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,625
- ( chuckles ) YOU'RE
QUITE A HANDFUL, AREN'T YOU?

316
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,458
- ( laughing )

317
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,458
- ( gasps )

318
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,833
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

319
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,791
- WELCOME ABOARD MY SHIP.

320
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,666
AND YOU'D BE WISE 
TO BEHAVE YOURSELF

321
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,208
UNTIL WE MAKE IT TO BOSCO.

322
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,666
DON'T MAKE ME ANGRY.

323
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,041
- WE'RE GOING TO BOSCO?!

324
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,208
YOU SAID YOU'D GET ME
INTO FAIRY TAIL!

325
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,000
- FORGET IT.
I JUST SAID THAT

326
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,000
SO I COULD LURE YOU HERE
AND MAKE YOU ONE OF OUR SLAVES.

327
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,500
- HOW COULD YOU?!

328
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,791
YOU'RE GONNA KIDNAP
ALL OF THESE GIRLS?

329
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,458
- Minion #1: THAT'S OUR
SALAMANDER, ALL RIGHT.

330
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:18,750
- Minion #2: WE GOT
A BIG HAUL THIS TIME.

331
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,250
- WHY YOU!

332
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,541
- ( grunts )
- ( gasps )

333
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,333
- HMM.

334
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:31,333
THESE ARE GATEKEYS.
SO YOU'RE A CELESTIAL WIZARD.

335
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:34,583
ONLY THE WIZARD WHO IS
CONTRACTED CAN USE THIS MAGIC.

336
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,416
SO THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY
USELESS TO ME.

337
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,041
WHOOPS.

338
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,583
- ( whimpers )

339
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,041
- ( chuckling )

340
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:56,000
- YOU USED MAGIC TO
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OTHERS.

341
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,250
YOU'RE THE WORST
WIZARD ALIVE.

342
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,500
- ( groaning )

343
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,541
- HEY, I KNOW YOU.

344
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,916
- ( gags ) I KNEW
THIS WAS A BAD IDEA.

345
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,625
- YOU ARE SO LAME.

346
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,083
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, LUCY?

347
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,291
- OH, HAPPY,
THIS JERK TRICKED ME.

348
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,333
HE SAID HE WAS GONNA
GET ME INTO FAIRY TAIL.

349
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,875
HOLD UP, SINCE WHEN
DO YOU HAVE WINGS? 

350
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,375
- Happy: I'LL EXPLAIN
THAT LATER, OKAY?

351
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:31,041
HOLD ON.
- ( screams )

352
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,666
- AFTER THEM.
WE CAN'T LET THEM

353
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,250
REPORT THIS TO
THE MAGIC COUNCIL.

354
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,875
- WAIT, WHAT ABOUT NATSU?

355
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,750
- I CAN'T CARRY TWO PEOPLE.
- ( shivers )

356
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,625
- PROMINENCE WHIP!

357
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,708
- ( screams )

358
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,041
- ( awed muttering )
- THAT CAT'S QUICKER

359
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,541
THAN HE LOOKS.
- Natsu: HEY, GUYS.

360
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,875
- Lucy: WHAT ABOUT NATSU
AND THE OTHER GIRLS?

361
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,958
- WE GOT A PROBLEM, LUCY.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

362
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,208
WHAT PROBLEM?
- MY TRANSFORMATION'S UP.

363
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,291
- ( both scream )

364
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,791
- STUPID CAT.

365
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,000
- ( grunts )

366
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,250
- Lucy: MY GATEKEYS.

367
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,208
- ( men grunting )
- FORGET ABOUT THEM.

368
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,541
LET'S CONTINUE ON
TOWARDS BOSCO.

369
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:23,791
- ( grunting )
THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD...

370
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,041
YOU'RE A MEMBER?

371
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,500
- ( gasps )

372
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,750
HERE WE GO.

373
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,166
OPEN, GATE OF THE WATER BEARER.

374
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,875
- ( doorbell rings )

375
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,250
- AQUARIUS!

376
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,583
- A FISH!
- NOT FOR YOU.

377
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,458
- THAT WAS AWESOME.
- THAT'S THE POWER 

378
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:53,833
OF A CELESTIAL WIZARD.

379
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,625
WHENEVER I USE MY GATEKEYS,

380
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,541
I CAN SUMMON SPIRITS FROM
OTHER WORLDS TO HELP ME. 

381
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,333
LISTEN UP, AQUARIUS,
I WANT YOU TO USE YOUR POWER

382
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,791
TO PUSH THAT SHIP
BACK INTO THE PORT.

383
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,916
- ( scoffs )
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO COME

384
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,041
FROM THE SPIRIT WORLD TO HELP,
NOT TO GIVE ME ATTITUDE.

385
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,416
- I WOULDN'T MAKE HER
ANY ANGRIER, LUCY.

386
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,416
- LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT.
THE NEXT TIME

387
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
YOU SO MUCH AS THINK
ABOUT DROPPING MY KEY,

388
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:13,708
YOU'RE DEAD.

389
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,083
- IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

390
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,208
- ( screams )

391
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,875
- WHY IS THE SEA SO ANGRY?

392
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,166
- HEY, DON'T WASH
ME AWAY WITH IT!

393
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,458
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
YOU THINK YOU COULD HAVE TRIED

394
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,000
NOT TO SWEEP ME
UP WITH THE SHIP?!

395
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,750
- OH, THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

396
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,458
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO GET THE SHIP.

397
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,458
- WAIT, THAT MEANS
YOU WERE AIMING FOR ME?!

398
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,125
- DON'T CALL ME FOR A WHILE.

399
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,333
I'M GOING ON A WEEK-LONG
VACATION WITH MY BOYFRIEND.

400
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:56,125
AND HE'S HOT.
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUB IT IN.

401
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,541
- I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

402
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,125
IF THE FISH LADY
GIVES YOU ANY MORE TROUBLE,

403
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,041
YOU CAN CALL ME
TO TAKE CARE OF HER.

404
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,416
- I DON'T THINK I CAN HANDLE 
MUCH MORE OF THIS STUPID CAT.

405
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,666
- ( muttering )
- WHAT HAPPENED?

406
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,958
- THAT SHIP WAS
THROWN INTO PORT.

407
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,875
- THAT HURT. 
WHAT IN THE--

408
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,166
- ( gasping )

409
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,041
- Lucy: NATSU!

410
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,750
- SO YOU CLAIM TO BE A MEMBER
OF THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD?

411
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,166
- SO WHAT'S IT TO YOU?

412
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,541
GO GET HIM, MEN.
- SIR.

413
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,833
- LET ME GET A CLOSER
LOOK AT YOUR FACE.

414
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,583
- Lucy: WATCH OUT!

415
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,083
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM.

416
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,500
I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE
TOLD YOU THIS EARLIER,

417
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,375
BUT HE'S A WIZARD TOO.
- ( gasps )

418
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,791
- MY NAME IS NATSU.
I'M A FAIRY TAIL WIZARD.

419
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,583
AND I'VE NEVER
SEEN YOU BEFORE.

420
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,208
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

421
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,625
SO NATSU IS
A FAIRY TAIL WIZARD?

422
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:50,458
- Man: THAT MARK ON HIS ARM,

423
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,958
THIS GUYS IS
THE REAL DEAL, BORA.

424
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,541
- DON'T CALL ME THAT,
YOU FOOL.

425
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,916
- I KNOW HIM.
THAT'S BORA THE PROMINENCE.

426
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,083
RUMOR HAS IT, HE WAS KICKED OUT
OF THE TITAN NOSE WIZARD GUILD 

427
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,333
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
BECAUSE OF BAD BEHAVIOR.

428
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,916
- I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO DO HERE, BUDDY,

429
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,291
AND I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE
A GOOD GUY, BAD GUY, OR WHAT.

430
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:10,750
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU DIRTY 
THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD'S NAME.

431
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,666
- AND WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

432
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,083
STOP ME?
PROMINENCE TYPHOON!

433
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,666
- NATSU!

434
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,791
- ( screaming )

435
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,916
- THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES.

436
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,500
THE BIGGER THE TALK,
THE WEAKER THE MAN. 

437
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,875
- AW, THIS IS SO GROSS.

438
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:35,291
ARE YOU SURE THAT
YOU'RE REALLY A FIRE WIZARD?

439
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,250
BECAUSE THESE ARE THE NASTIEST
FLAMES I'VE EVER TASTED.

440
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,041
- ( screams )
- ( gasps )

441
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,666
- THANKS FOR THE GRUB, POSER.

442
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,125
- Man: WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
WHO IS THIS KID?

443
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,541
- FIRE MAGIC DOESN'T WORK
ON NATSU.

444
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,000
- I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

445
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,083
- NOW, I'VE GOT
A FIRE IN MY BELLY

446
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,916
THAT'S RAGING TO GET OUT.

447
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,375
HERE IT GOES.

448
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:07,000
FIRE DRAGON ROAR!

449
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,541
- Minion #3: HEY, BORA,

450
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:29,000
I SWEAR I'VE SEEN
THIS GUY BEFORE. 

451
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,250
THE PINK HAIR AND
THE SCALY-LOOKING SCARF,

452
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:35,458
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
HE'S GOT TO BE THE REAL ONE.

453
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,958
- SALAMANDER?!

454
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,625
- I HOPE YOU GUYS
ARE PAYING ATTENTION.

455
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,583
THIS IS WHAT
A FAIRY TAIL WIZARD CAN DO.

456
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,291
HERE I COME!

457
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:49,125
- RED SHOWER! 
- ( grunting )

458
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,875
- SO HE EATS FIRE
AND THEN ATTACKS WITH IT?

459
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,583
BUT HOW DOES HE DO IT?
IS IT SOME KIND OF SPELL?

460
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:59,416
- HE HAS DRAGON LUNGS THAT
ALLOW HIM TO BREATHE FIRE,

461
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,791
DRAGON SCALES TO HELP HIM
TO DISSOLVE THE FIRE,

462
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,958
AND DRAGON CLAWS FOR
ATTACKING WITH FIRE.

463
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,041
HIS BRAND OF FIRE MAGIC

464
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,666
IS ONE THAT ALLOWS HIS BODY
TO TAKE ON

465
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,791
ALL THE QUALITIES
OF A DRAGON.

466
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,291
IT'S AN ANCIENT SPELL
THAT'S RARELY USED ANYMORE.

467
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,833
- SERIOUSLY?
- THIS PARTICULAR MAGIC

468
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,000
WAS ORIGINALLY USED
TO DEAL WITH DRAGONS.

469
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:20,208
- WHOA.
- HELL PROMINENCE!

470
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,875
- Happy: IT'S CALLED
DRAGON SLAYER MAGIC.

471
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:26,708
IGNEEL WAS THE ONE
WHO TAUGHT IT TO HIM.

472
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,583
- ( screams )

473
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,166
- NOW, THAT WAS A HEFTY MEAL.

474
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,083
YOU'RE NOT DOING TOO BAD.

475
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,000
BUT I'M ABOUT TO COOK YOU
LIKE A SMOKED FISH.

476
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,083
- YOU'RE GONNA DO WHAT TO ME?

477
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,500
- GET READY.

478
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:46,750
FIRE DRAGON IRON FIST!

479
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,041
( grunts )

480
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,083
- ( screams )

481
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:02,541
OWW, OWW, OWW!
OWW, OWW, OWW!

482
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:03,916
- ( bell rings )

483
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,791
- DON'T BE SILLY, NATSU.

484
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,791
EVERYONE KNOWS YOU
SMOKE FOOD WITH SMOKE,

485
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,166
NOT FIRE.
- OH, WOW.

486
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,291
THAT WAS AMAZING.

487
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,375
BUT HE OVERDID IT.
- AYE.

488
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,208
- OH, SHUT IT, CAT.

489
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,583
- THE ARMY?!

490
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,208
( screams ) - OH, CRAP,
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

491
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,541
- WHERE THE HECK
ARE YOU TAKING ME?

492
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,333
- JUST COME ON.
YOU SAID THAT YOU WANTED

493
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:28,041
TO JOIN THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD,
DIDN'T YOU?

494
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,125
SO LET'S GO.

495
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,041
- ALL RIGHT!

496
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:43,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

497
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:14,666
- Lucy: I'M SURE THAT
BEFORE I JOIN FAIRY TAIL,

498
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,333
THEY'RE GONNA MAKE ME
INTERVIEW WITH THEM. 

499
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:18,666
FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE IMPORTANT
WITH THINGS LIKE THIS.

500
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,666
SO I'M GONNA PRACTICE.
( clears throat )

501
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,000
GREETINGS, MY NAME IS LUCY.

502
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,833
NO, THAT'S PROBABLY
WAY TOO FORMAL FOR THEM.

503
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:28,833
HIYA', I'M LUCY.
WHAT'S UP?

504
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:31,375
UGH, TOO TEENAGE GIRL.

505
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:33,958
NEXT TIME...

506
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,708
I'VE GOT TO BE MORE ENERGETIC

507
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:37,166
AND SAY SOMETHING
THEY'LL REMEMBER ME BY.

508
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,750
I AM LUCY!

509
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,416
WHOA, THAT WAS JUST SCARY.
