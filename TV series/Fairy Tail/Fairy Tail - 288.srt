1
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:21,166
You hideous soul.

2
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,541
You demon!

3
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:24,875
Close, old man.

4
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,625
But the meaning of
the name "Spriggan"

5
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:29,875
is much more akin
to "hideous fairy."

6
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:32,250
--It's Gramps!
--He found him!

7
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,000
[ERZA, LUCY]
Master!

8
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,583
Hey, Gramps!

9
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:37,166
My children are here.

10
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,458
Guys. I saw Zeref!

11
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:40,791
He was with Zeref!

12
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,125
[gasps]

13
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,083
Are you sure?

14
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,666
[ZEREF]
Natsu, after all this time...

15
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,625
...you have come.

16
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,583
[NATSU]
Zeref is here?

17
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,333
Like, on this continent?

18
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,833
I can hardly believe it myself.

19
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,208
But this Empire's leader,
who they call Spriggan,

20
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,875
is actually the
Black Wizard Zeref.

21
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,333
[gasps]

22
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,458
How is that possible?

23
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:40,083
The emperor is Zeref?

24
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,041
[MAKAROV]
Since you've come all this way,

25
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:47,166
I assume Mest has filled
you in on the situation,

26
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,166
and what I was trying to
accomplish by traveling here.

27
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,416
He has.

28
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,333
[WENDY] I'm just so happy
that you're okay.

29
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:58,041
I've been far too naive
through this whole ordeal.

30
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:01,041
I came here believing that they
would be willing to negotiate,

31
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,875
but that was just a fantasy.

32
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,250
And before I made
the journey west,

33
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:09,833
I put the future of
the guild in jeopardy.

34
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,625
All that heartache and
pain was for nothing.

35
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:17,291
I've never felt such regret
and embarrassment in my life.

36
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:20,958
This year was tough, but we
all made our way through it.

37
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,041
And we're even stronger.

38
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,125
It really is true.

39
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,791
And the bond we share
could never be broken.

40
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,458
That's how we found
each other again.

41
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,416
[ERZA] If concern for another
is what pushes you to act,

42
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,875
then it means something.

43
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,375
Showing you care is important.

44
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:44,125
Master, you taught
us that lesson.

45
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:55,083
[NATSU] Come on, Gramps.
Let's go home.

46
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,625
Fairy Tail's waiting.

47
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,500
[MAKAROV]
I'm ready.

48
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,333
[CARLA] Well, we've a
lot of catching up to do,

49
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,375
but first, we should
get out of this place.

50
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,500
Yeah, you're right.

51
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,708
[MAKAROV]
Do I know this person?

52
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,375
[MEST] I used too many
Direct Lines in a row,

53
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,708
so I'm running low
on magic power.

54
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:35,250
I only have enough to
teleport us one more time.

55
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,666
I think it would be best
to use that last teleport

56
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,958
to reach Sorano's ship.

57
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:44,291
So we'll need to travel a bit on
land, until we're within range.

58
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,541
[AJEEL] Makarov, are you
really leaving so soon?

59
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,375
And after we were getting
to know each other.

60
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,541
I have a farewell gift for you.

61
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,708
I'd like you to have it

62
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,708
before you take a long
nap in the ground.

63
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:56,875
[chuckles]

64
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,375
No! Ajeel!

65
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,958
Impossible! How did he find us?

66
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,833
[AJEEL]
Sand.

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Sand is nice. It tells me
almost everything.

68
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,833
[GRAY] This guy's got
as much magic power

69
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,833
as the girl on Caracol Island.

70
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:19,750
[chuckles]

71
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,708
Very nice.

72
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,583
[MAKAROV]
Stop!

73
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,750
You mustn't fight him.
He's much too powerful!

74
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:27,875
We should run!

75
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:31,000
[gasps]

76
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,250
For real?

77
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,625
Our master clearly gave
the order to retreat!

78
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:35,583
But, Erza!

79
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,500
[ERZA]
Let's go, now!

80
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,208
We already have a magic-mobile
ready and waiting!

81
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,708
[yells]

82
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:43,958
[AJEEL]
Huh?

83
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,791
[GRAY]
Come on, get in!

84
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,625
[NATSU]
Ugh. Can't we walk?

85
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:53,375
[ERZA] I'll drive us!
SE plug, connected!

86
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,916
Here it goes!

87
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,916
So those are Makarov's lackeys.

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,041
Huh. This'll be fun.

89
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,166
This sucks.

90
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,083
Sure does.

91
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,291
Can we go faster?

92
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm trying!

93
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,458
He's coming!

94
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,500
What is that thing?

95
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:32,583
[GRAY]
Whoa! It's a giant sand monster!

96
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,958
Not good!

97
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,750
[GRAY]
It's gaining on us!

98
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,750
You and I need to try
and stop it, Lucy!

99
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:39,458
Right!

100
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,708
So sick.

101
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,291
[LUCY]
Sorry for squishing you, Natsu!

102
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,958
No, don't! He's too
powerful for us to fight!

103
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah, well, I'm not sure
about that, Gramps!

104
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,958
[LUCY]
Star Dress.

105
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,291
Sagittarius Form!

106
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,625
There's so much magic power
coming from those two!

107
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,000
They told me they'd
gotten stronger,

108
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:17,000
but to have grown so much
in only a year is incredible!

109
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,750
[GRAY]
Let's show 'em what we got.

110
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,291
[AJEEL] So you're actually
gonna put up a fight, are ya?

111
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,875
Ice Make Silver.

112
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:26,875
[AJEEL gasps]

113
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,958
Looks like Gray froze
everything with that attack!

114
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,291
Impressive!

115
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,041
Nice!

116
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,291
Now those sand creatures
are comin' for us!

117
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,708
I'll take care of them!

118
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,500
Star Shot!

119
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,291
This is even more fun
than I thought it would be!

120
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,208
He's gone!

121
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,416
Beneath us!

122
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,250
He merged with the sand;
watch for an attack!

123
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,041
[CARLA]
Huh?

124
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,083
[AJEEL]
Antlion Pit!

125
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,666
[gasps] What's happening?

126
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,875
Damn it!

127
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,250
[AJEEL]
Heh. Man, that was pathetic!

128
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,041
You guys shoulda stayed
back in Ishgar

129
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,541
'cause you're really in
over your heads here.

130
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,458
[ERZA]
Everyone, out of the car! Hurry!

131
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,791
[WENDY coughs]

132
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,958
Oh, no! We've lost
the magic-mobile!

133
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,750
[CARLA]
Happy! Please! Hang on!

134
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,583
[HAPPY] I just swallowed
a mouthful of sand!

135
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:23,750
The hell?

136
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,750
It's actually pulling us down!

137
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,125
I can't move my legs anymore!

138
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:32,083
[GROUP grunting]

139
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:36,708
[AJEEL] I can't count how many
people I've killed with this.

140
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:40,791
Entire cities have been
swallowed up whole inside it.

141
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,083
[growls]

142
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:45,666
My Antlion Trap is like
a gateway to hell.

143
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,041
Nobody has ever escaped from it.

144
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,583
Heh.

145
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,000
Before you go to your graves

146
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,458
thinking that you're
something special,

147
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:53,708
you should know this!

148
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,250
You're just a bunch of losers

149
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,291
like all of the other wizards
we've killed over the years!

150
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,000
We're on a different
level altogether

151
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,958
than you maggots from Ishgar!

152
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,541
The gods have abandoned your
whole freakin' continent!

153
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,791
It'll be so easy for
Alvarez to take it over!

154
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,541
Sucks to be you guys!

155
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,625
[AJEEL laughing]

156
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:17,208
[AJEEL] Oh, man! The looks on
your faces are priceless!

157
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,041
[gasps]

158
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,666
[NATSU] So the gods
abandoned Ishgar, huh?

159
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,833
That's not a problem!

160
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:27,208
Because Fairy Tail is
still watching over it.

161
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,041
He made my sand evaporate?

162
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,958
[NATSU yells]

163
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,833
[gasps]

164
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:41,958
Nice shot!

165
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:45,166
It's been forever since somebody
got in a solid punch like that!

166
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,666
Yeah! Bring it on!

167
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,416
Cool it down!

168
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:54,916
All dried up.

169
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,875
[NATSU]
What's he doing?!

170
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:02,625
Not this again!
It's like it's alive!

171
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,083
It's so strong. What do we do?

172
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:08,333
You won't hurt my children!

173
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,916
[AJEEL]
Whoa!

174
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,333
[ALL yell]

175
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,125
As long as I draw breath, I'll
protect my family at any cost!

176
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,541
[AJEEL]
Hm.

177
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,458
Come on, Gramps, let us go
so we can pummel this guy!

178
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:24,041
Natsu, would you
please stop yelling?

179
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,500
Is that so?

180
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,375
Well, you won't be drawing
breath for that much longer.

181
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,833
If you think you
can protect them,

182
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:33,333
you don't understand the power
of the Spriggan Twelve.

183
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:35,791
[MAKAROV]
Huh?

184
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,041
You'll die together.

185
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:41,250
Drowning in my sands of death!

186
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,666
[gasps]

187
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,625
Now, Mest! Teleport us!

188
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,458
Where can we go?

189
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,166
[NATSU]
Gramps!

190
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,916
[MAKAROV] I will keep you safe,
if it's the last thing I do!

191
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,791
I swear on my life!

192
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,125
Here it comes!

193
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,791
And every single thing
that gets caught

194
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:04,833
in the path of this sandstorm
shrivels up and dies instantly!

195
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,500
[NATSU]
Gramps, no!

196
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,250
[ERZA]
Master!

197
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,000
[GRAY]
Run!

198
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,791
[LUCY]
Get outta here!

199
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,833
[AJEEL] You're gonna be
a bunch of Fairy mummies

200
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,958
in just a second.

201
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,416
[gasps]

202
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,333
[gasps]

203
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,583
[MAKAROV]
Laxus?

204
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,083
[MAKAROV]
Is that really him?

205
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:45,416
That sandstorm was completely
obliterated with only one shot!

206
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,375
He's always been
flashy like that.

207
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,416
It's amazing!

208
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,416
Sounds like him!

209
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:56,083
Hey, old man. You're even older.

210
00:11:56,166 --> 00:12:00,000
We're behind enemy lines,
so we gotta get outta here ASAP.

211
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,500
Thank this guy for the ship!

212
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,625
Gajeel?

213
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,333
I can smell Levy and
Lily up there too.

214
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,041
Hold on just a second!

215
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,583
How are you and Laxus not
puking your guts out?

216
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:11,791
[JUVIA]
Gray, my darling!

217
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,458
Don't worry, I'm here too!

218
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,916
[ELFMAN] Hey, I wanna
say somethin' manly!

219
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,916
[LISANNA]
How is that gonna help?

220
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,125
[MIRAJANE] This ship's been
modified so Dragon Slayers

221
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,083
can ride on it and not get sick!

222
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,250
[MAKAROV]
Hmm.

223
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,500
Hey, Wendy!

224
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,208
You've really grown up
since last time we met.

225
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,791
She's gone from little
girl to little lady.

226
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,166
Seems like everybody's
changed from last year.

227
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,500
Oh, yeah?

228
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,125
I don't think I've changed
all that much, actually.

229
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,958
You're down there,
too, right, Mest?

230
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,291
Teleport onto the ship
if you're able!

231
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,375
Comin' up!

232
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,791
[AJEEL]
You can't run from me!

233
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,458
[LAXUS]
No one's running.

234
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,708
We're just flying
back home, okay?

235
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:52,375
And I'm gonna get cranky
if we miss dinner.

236
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,208
[AJEEL grunts]

237
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:05,250
[AJEEL]
That was intense.

238
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,541
They must be taking
this seriously.

239
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:09,791
Hm?

240
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:15,083
I guess you put up that barrier
as some kind of favor to me?

241
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:18,041
[AUGUST] Even an old man
like me finds it painful

242
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,958
to lose a comrade in battle.

243
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:24,125
So you think that little
light show woulda killed me?

244
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:27,708
Sorry, August, you must
be getting senile.

245
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:38,458
It begins, Natsu. Game on.

246
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,208
[ALL groaning]

247
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,208
What do you think about
our manly rescue?

248
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,458
You're safe now!

249
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,083
The mission to get
Master back is a success!

250
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:54,375
Gotta say, I'm surprised
to see ya here.

251
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,083
We knew the master
was in trouble,

252
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,125
so we came up with
a rescue plan.

253
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,166
Luckily, we got
Laxus to help out!

254
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,333
You got some nerve
leavin' without us!

255
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,458
Well, it was a covert operation.

256
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:05,666
Bein' on a ship is awesome

257
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,583
when you don't need to
hurl the whole time!

258
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,708
Whaddaya say you and
me fight to celebrate?

259
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,333
I'll pass.

260
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,500
My children.

261
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:33,000
It feels so good to be with
my Fairy Tail family again!

262
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,541
[LUCY]
Let's have a toast!

263
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,708
Fairy Tail is back in business!

264
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,833
[FAIRY TAIL]
Cheers!

265
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,750
[MEMBER G]
Welcome back, Master!

266
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,708
Hang on, if Erza's
our master now,

267
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,041
then what in the heck are
we supposed to call him?

268
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,041
Mr. Makarov, I suppose?

269
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,333
I don't know; doesn't
feel quite right to me.

270
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:52,750
[FRIED sighs]

271
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,083
Call him "Master."

272
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,583
Because I'll be stepping down.

273
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,750
Oh, sweet Little Asca!
I missed you!

274
00:14:58,833 --> 00:14:59,833
[MEMBER H]
I'm confused.

275
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,750
Does this make him
our eighth master?

276
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,541
[MEMBER I] Can't believe
this is his third time!

277
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,958
I mean, how does he keep
getting revived like that?

278
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,291
[MEMBER J]
Uhh, it's not like he died.

279
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,333
Looks like I'll be guild master
till I die this time around.

280
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,208
Now that's a man's dedication!

281
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,833
I believe that's what you said
the last time this happened.

282
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,666
[LISANNA laughs]

283
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,291
All right, let's
crack open the booze

284
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,041
and get this shindig started!

285
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,208
[MEMBERS]
It's time to party!

286
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,041
[GRAY] I'm kinda surprised
you guys decided

287
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,750
to join Blue Pegasus.

288
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,250
There are worse jobs
than serving customers.

289
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,333
Yeah, but I feel way more at
home in a rowdy bar like this.

290
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:35,625
I do have to ask how Laxus
fit in at that guild.

291
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:39,416
I mean, did he actually do the
"hospitality" part of the job?

292
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,125
He did once in a while.

293
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,041
I can't say it was
very hospitable.

294
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,583
What happens at the guild
hall stays in the guild hall.

295
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,541
Did you manage to get
in contact with Sorano

296
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,958
after we left that place?

297
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:52,750
Yeah, I did. And she
was not a happy camper.

298
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,125
Then we teleported into
an underwater temple.

299
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,458
And everywhere you looked,
it was completely surrounded

300
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:02,166
by so many different kinds
of beautifully yummy fishies!

301
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,708
I heard the news.

302
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,041
You're the most recent member
of the motion sickness club?

303
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,083
Yeah.

304
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,583
Aw, don't let it get
you down, Wendy.

305
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:09,916
I've always been that way!

306
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,958
[GRAY]
I don't see how that's

307
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,000
supposed to make
her feel any better.

308
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,666
[GAJEEL]
You lookin' for a fight?

309
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,125
[NATSU]
Bring it on!

310
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,666
[CANA] How did that little
exchange turn into a fight?

311
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,833
[WENDY] I'll never ride
in a carriage again.

312
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,750
[CARLA] If it's that
big of a deal for you.

313
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,708
[JUVIA]
Oh, Gray! Please!

314
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,958
I wanna know what your
"hospitality" is like!

315
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,250
[GRAY]
What the hell do you mean?

316
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,041
[CANA]
Man, did I miss you guys!

317
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,125
[ERZA] Can you believe we can't
get Star Mangos in Fiore?

318
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,583
[MIRAJANE]
I've never even heard of 'em.

319
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,708
[ELFMAN]
Hmph. Do they taste manly?

320
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,708
[LISANNA]
That sounds disgusting!

321
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,125
The guild hall's just as
noisy as I remember it!

322
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,708
If you ask me,
it sounds like things

323
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,250
are finally gettin'
back to normal!

324
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,958
[LUCY] We were able to
get our beloved master

325
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,666
back to Fairy Tail.

326
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,958
And Laxus and the
Thunder Legion, to boot.

327
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,541
But during our journey,

328
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,916
we found out that the Alvarez
Empire on the western continent

329
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
has wizards more powerful
than any we've faced before.

330
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,041
But what's even scarier is
that the Black Wizard Zeref

331
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,083
rules over that empire.

332
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:16,375
Although there, he's known
as "Emperor Spriggan."

333
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,416
And not only that, he's
planning on coming to Ishgar

334
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,375
to take the Lumen Histoire.

335
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,458
Our guild's biggest treasure.

336
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:27,208
The crystal that contains
the body of our first master.

337
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,458
There's gonna be a war for sure.

338
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,833
And I'm positive it's gonna be

339
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,833
the most grueling battle
we've been through.

340
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,458
I don't even wanna think
about losing anyone.

341
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:39,833
There has to be a way we can
get through this in one piece.

342
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:44,458
I just want the feeling we
share here to last forever.

343
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:49,750
To live inside this moment...
that's my deepest wish.

344
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,958
[ALL]
Huh?

345
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,708
[ALL]
Huh?

346
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:01,916
Children. Let me apologize.

347
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,041
I'm not going to make
any excuses for myself.

348
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,208
I took your home and your
way of life away from you.

349
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,541
That was a mistake on my part.

350
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,666
Don't worry,
Mest explained it all!

351
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,291
You followed the only
course of action

352
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,041
you believed you had
to protect us.

353
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,791
We understand your feelings.

354
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,625
And anyway, the guild's
back together now,

355
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:20,958
so everything's fine!

356
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,083
That's why I say we should
have a little more booze

357
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,250
and a little less boo-hoos.

358
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,000
[MAKAROV]
This is serious.

359
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:38,000
Because I wasn't able to
negotiate for our safety,

360
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,291
there's no doubt
Alvarez will invade.

361
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:41,958
[FAIRY TAIL gasps]

362
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,333
[MAKAROV]
They are a true superpower,

363
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,541
and they will throw
everything they have at us.

364
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,041
So what?! I'm ready!

365
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,958
[NATSU] Time and time again,
we've put everything on the line

366
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,583
for the sake of the guild!

367
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,958
No matter how tough
our enemies may be,

368
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,666
we fight for what's
most important to us.

369
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,958
That's what makes us so strong!

370
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:12,583
It's not that I'm not scared,
but no matter how I feel,

371
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,750
I can't let go of
my responsibility.

372
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:21,000
Plus, I know I can count
on everybody else.

373
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,958
What I'm most afraid of...

374
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:26,166
...is losing what we
all have together.

375
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,458
[NATSU]
So we can't run away from this.

376
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,000
We have to fight!

377
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:36,125
For our family, and for
the bond we share.

378
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,125
We gotta make a stand!

379
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,291
And it's not just about winning!

380
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,083
This time, our fight
is about living!

381
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:47,958
[ALL chuckle]

382
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,833
I think everyone's made up
their minds, old man.

383
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,375
[MAKAROV grunts]

384
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,916
[MAKAROV]
As have I.

385
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,125
Listen up!

386
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,208
We are going to make
them rue the day

387
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,958
they chose to mess
with our family!

388
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,041
Let's take them down!

389
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,166
[FAIRY TAIL]
Yeah!

390
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,875
I'm all fired up now!

391
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,875
We're gonna have to give
it everything we've got!

392
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,416
Well, don't we always?

393
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,666
This foe's like none
we've ever faced.

394
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,708
We'll be fighting Zeref.

395
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,666
I'm gonna find E.N.D.

396
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,208
We'll make it through this
fight just like all the others.

397
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,500
...get my claws into those big
magic meanies from Alvarez.

398
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,666
I'll protect the guild
this time. I swear I will.

399
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,250
Like a real man!

400
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,791
After training for
the last year,

401
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,875
I'm ready to show off the
new skills I picked up!

402
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,458
Whoa, you've actually been
training for this entire year?

403
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,708
[LISANNA] Oh, yeah, she's
like way stronger now.

404
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,208
And I am too!

405
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,041
Oh, man, did I miss this
frickin' guild, or what?

406
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,208
[LAXUS]
Heh.

407
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,291
Before we get too carried away,

408
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,250
there's some extremely
important information

409
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,708
I must share with you.

410
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,916
It's concerning
the Lumen Histoire.

411
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,958
Or rather, what's
formally referred to

412
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,375
as the "Fairy Heart."

413
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,166
[MAVIS] I think perhaps
I should be the one

414
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,541
to explain this to them, Sixth--

415
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:04,458
or, excuse me--Eighth Master.

416
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,208
[MAKAROV]
First Master?

417
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,041
[FAIRY TAIL gasping, chattering]

418
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,291
[ERZA]
Is this a projection of her?

419
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,875
Or is she really here?

420
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:16,458
It's likely... you've not
heard of Fairy Heart.

421
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,000
For many years,
it's been our guild's

422
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,500
most closely guarded secret.

423
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,000
For good reason.

424
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:26,125
Because the world must never
learn exactly what it holds.

425
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:29,666
However, I believe it's
crucial that you know

426
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,125
why Zeref would go to
such lengths to get it.

427
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,916
And also... about my own sin.

428
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,291
You're sure?

429
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,166
[MAVIS]
I am.

430
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,833
It's time for my long-held
secrets to be revealed.

431
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:56,541
[MAVIS] This is a tale
of a boy and girl,

432
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:59,458
of the awful curse they shared,

433
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:04,208
and the primordial magic...
that they sought together.

434
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,000
[LUCY gasps]

435
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,250
[MAVIS]
Over 100 years ago,

436
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:43,708
a girl living in a world
full of turmoil and strife

437
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:47,041
crossed paths with someone who
would change her life forever:

438
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,000
A young black wizard.

439
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,500
The gears of fate
turn constantly;

440
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:54,500
at times, offering chance
glimpses of hope,

441
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:58,083
but also producing
heart-breaking contradiction.

442
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:01,583
Next Time: "Mavis and Zeref."

443
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:06,333
This is a tale of the
primordial essence of magic.
