00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,125
Hey, Mr. Door...?

158
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,583
Would you please open up
for me and my friends?

159
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:09,625
[door slides open]

160
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,583
[HAPPY] Whaddya know? All
we had to do was ask it nicely.

161
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,458
[HAPPY] That's Zentopia's
emblem! I wonder why it's here.

162
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,833
[LUCY] It makes sense...! You
see, these ruins are known

163
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:24,166
as the Holy Tomb... It's one
of Zentopia's sacred sites.

164
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,666
It's been mentioned
in a ton of

165
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,208
their historical documents
and other church literature...

166
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,333
But its existence was never
proven, that is, until now!

167
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,708
[MICHELLE] Wait,
does that mean...?

168
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,333
We're the first people
to step foot in these ruins!

169
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,708
Oh, I get it...

170
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,333
So that's why those old
guys made such a big fuss.

171
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,916
[HAPPY] I don't blame 'em
'cause there's a good chance

172
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,625
we'll wreck the place...

173
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,000
Especially with Natsu.

174
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,000
[NATSU] Get off
my case, fur ball.

175
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,666
[door moves]

176
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,958
[HAPPY] The door closed!

177
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,083
[ROMEO] What're we gonna
do now?! We're locked in!

178
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,250
Don't worry,
I totally got this!

179
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,041
I read a lot of
adventure stories.

180
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,250
When the heroes
get stuck, they

181
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,583
do something like this!

182
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,375
What in the heck
is that gonna do?

183
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,166
[door moves]

184
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,916
[LUCY] Open secret doors!

185
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,083
[NATSU screams]

186
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,250
[HAPPY] What are those things?!

187
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,125
[ROMEO] Whoa...!
They're so creepy lookin'!

188
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,416
[LUCY] Yeah, no kidding...

189
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,125
[MICHELLE] I think
they're beautiful!

190
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,458
[HAPPY] Are you crazy?!

191
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,166
[NATSU] You led us
right into a trap, Lucy!

192
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,875
[HAPPY] The creepy faces
are gonna crush us!

193
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,250
[NATSU] Take this!

194
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,291
[LUCY] Stop, Natsu!

195
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,875
Ow-ow-ow!
Hot-hot! Ow...! Ow!

196
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,166
I told you to stop!

197
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,750
It seemed
like a good idea!

198
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:27,791
Oh, I know...!

199
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,250
Maybe if I just
turn this back...

200
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,166
Uh, where'd it go?!

201
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,625
Aw, man. That
was a close one...

202
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:51,916
How are we ever
going to get out of

203
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,416
this horrible place?

204
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,500
We just have to turn
this the opposite way...

205
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:56,708
I hope.

206
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:57,791
[NATSU] You sure it's
gonna be that easy?

207
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,375
[rumbling]

208
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,541
[NATSU] Uh-oh!

209
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:01,458
[ROMEO] Now they're
comin' from above?!

210
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,000
[LUCY] Oh crap!

211
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,125
[NATSU] We got no choice but to
get back in the noses again!

212
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,583
[HAPPY] Look!

213
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,375
We can't 'cause their noses
are closed up this time!

214
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,500
We need to think of
somethin' quick, you guys!

215
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,791
What're you doing?!

216
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,333
Escaping reality!

217
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,375
Is it time for
punishment yet?

218
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,541
[HAPPY] Hey, it's Virgo!

219
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,333
[ROMEO] Why is
she in a bikini?

220
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,000
When did you learn how
to summon two Spirits

221
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,291
at the same time?

222
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,666
"I didn't summon her!"

223
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,708
the lady says in
a panicked voice.

224
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,250
No, I came here of my
own accord because the Princess

225
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,791
is almost out of magic power.

226
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,416
[ROMEO] Okaaay... But why
are you wearin' a bikini?

227
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,958
[VIRGO] What's the matter? Don't
you like girls in bikinis?

228
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,375
[HOROLOGIUM] "Geez! Just make
a hole in the floor already!"

229
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,583
she exclaims impatiently.

230
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,458
Very well;
as you wish!

231
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:43,916
[explosion]

232
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,625
[HOROLOGIUM] "Why does
this keep happening?!"

233
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,333
she asks anxiously.

234
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,208
Where are we, darling?

235
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,458
I dunno...

236
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,541
I'm not even sure how
we ended up in this place.

237
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,375
It would appear that
this giant structure

238
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,166
is intended to be used
for teleportation.

239
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,541
[JUVIA] So many
floating arrow rocks...

240
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,416
Are we supposed
to pass through...

241
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,000
those gate things somehow?

242
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,916
I'd bet the clock piece
we're looking for is

243
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,125
at the end of them.

244
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,541
Maybe we can use
our power to make

245
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,458
a path outta these rocks!

246
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,708
It's worth a try.

247
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,125
[GRAY] Sweet!

248
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,625
It worked!

249
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,083
But I'd still love to get my
hands on whoever thought up

250
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,166
all this elaborate nonsense.

251
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,583
[Elvis impersonation] Uh-huh

252
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,166
[SUGARBOY] Hot dog!

253
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,541
It's Sugarboy!

254
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,916
You know it...!
The one and only!

255
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,625
[SUGARBOY] I knew I could
to get to the church on time,

256
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:31,833
but I'll tell you
what, getting in was

257
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,500
a whole other
story altogether...

258
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,083
But I'm not one for
crying in the chapel, baby.

259
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,500
So...

260
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,791
thanks for gettin' me in;
you may be shabby wizards

261
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,750
but you sure helped me out!

262
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,333
[LYON] I take it
he's the enemy?!

263
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,458
[GRAY] Sneaky bastard...!
You followed us in here,

264
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:46,458
didn't you?!

265
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,958
Aw c'mon, don't
be cruel, baby!

266
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,041
After all, I was
just doin' my job!

267
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,375
I've got no use
for you now that

268
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:54,125
I'm in Zentopia territory...
That clock piece is

269
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,750
as good as mine.

270
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,708
No! We won't
let that happen!!

271
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,250
[SUGARBOY] Spicy!
What a hard hearted woman!

272
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,708
How about I put on a
little show for you folks?

273
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,083
Y'all ready...?

274
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,250
Gonna be some good
rockin' tonight!

275
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,375
What in the hell?!

276
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,500
What is this stuff?!

277
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:14,041
Ew! It's so disgusting!

278
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,708
[GRAY] I didn't get the
chance to warn them...

279
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,000
He's trapped you
with his magic power!

280
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,750
Yeah! There's no escapin'

281
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,750
my "Dog Whistle" magic!
It's the tops, baby!

282
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,791
That's how I control my hound
dogs that got you all shook up!

283
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,791
[JUVIA] "Hound
dogs"...?! What?!

284
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,708
The show's over now!

285
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,750
Sugarboy...

286
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,375
is leavin' the building.

287
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,791
[GRAY] Hang on...! Once it's
frozen, I can shatter it

288
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:36,625
to get you out!

289
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,125
[LYON] Don't worry about us!

290
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,791
[JUVIA] Go after him while
you have the chance, my love!

291
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,916
Yeah... guess you're right.

292
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,416
[GRAY] But first,
I should tell you...

293
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,250
that slime gradually absorbs
your magic and physical power...

294
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,916
So please, be careful!

295
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,750
I told you not to worry.
This is nothing

296
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:56,583
that I can't handle... Remember,
we share the same master.

297
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:58,916
Good point.

298
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,500
[Elvis impersonation] Uh-huh.

299
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,083
So, you think you can
keep up with me, do ya...?

300
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,791
Good luck, Ice Boy!

301
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:07,791
[GRAY] Would you
cut the crap?!

302
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,083
Stop runnin' and come
fight me like a man!

303
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,583
When I'm done with you,

304
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,708
you're gonna wish that you
never messed with Fairy Tail!

305
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,125
[SUGARBOY] Uh-huh.

306
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,708
If ol' snow bird
was gonna catch up,

307
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:26,916
it's now or never...

308
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,375
Well, I guess he's
all hat and no cattle.

309
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:34,208
Hot dog...! I didn't
even see him comin', man!

310
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,125
[GRAY] It certainly
wasn't easy...

311
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,291
...but I caught up to you!

312
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,791
Uh-huh?

313
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,666
[SUGARBOY] So you noticed these
gates form one giant loop.

314
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,791
Impressive, Ice Boy.

315
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,166
[GRAY] It's not too
hard to figure out

316
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,833
if you just pay attention.

317
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,583
I guess if I want you
off my hide

318
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,791
I'll just have to settle
things once and for all!

319
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,500
I'm about to beat
the crap outta you...!

320
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,875
Just like in Edolas!

321
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,333
[GRAY] Is
that it?!

322
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,000
[SUGARBOY]
Sweet Lelani.

323
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,125
You're not gettin' your
hands on it... Hear me?!

324
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,916
Hey now, what you
strippin' for?!

325
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,833
[GRAY] Isn't
it obvious?!

326
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:27,250
Because...
I'm ready...

327
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,458
[SUGARBOY] Whoa, Jack, I don't
know how to respond to that

328
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,500
without things
gettin' real weird!

329
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:32,750
Huh?

330
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,666
[SUGARBOY] Hot dog,
now I'm all shook up...

331
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,083
What's... this feeling...

332
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,666
My heart can't seem
to stop... poundin'.

333
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,333
[GRAY] Huh?

334
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,958
Hold up...
Where is Virgo?

335
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,625
She's right
behind you...

336
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,000
[LUCY] What're you doing?

337
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,791
[HOROLOGIUM] "Is it
time for punishment?"

338
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,666
she asks expectantly.

339
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,916
[LUCY] No, uh...

340
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,708
I mean why are you
sitting inside Horologium?

341
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,125
[HOROLOGIUM]
"Because it calms me down,"

342
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,500
she says quite peacefully.

343
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:05,166
This place is even
weirder than the last one!

344
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,583
No kiddin'... Alright, let's
get a move on, everybody!

345
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:09,791
Princess...

346
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,500
I've finished repairing
this for you... Here.

347
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,791
You fixed the
Fleuve d'étoiles?!

348
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,250
Hang on... sorry...
but it looks like

349
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,833
an ordinary whip now...

350
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,416
It's far from
ordinary...

351
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,250
But I did make a few changes
to make it more functional.

352
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:26,208
[LUCY] That's awesome! Wow...!
I can't thank you enough!

353
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,708
Hey, is it just
me or does Lucy

354
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,083
live to crack the whip?

355
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,958
That's the kinda
character she is.

356
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,916
I'm within earshot,
ya know.

357
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,250
We should get
goin', Happy...

358
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,625
Aye, sir!

359
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,500
[NATSU] This sucks...!
I don't see a door anywhere.

360
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,625
Whoa, check out these
angry-lookin' statues!

361
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,750
I think those are
actually coffins.

362
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:43,500
[yells]

363
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,291
[HAPPY] All of 'em?!

364
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,875
[ROMEO] I betcha there's some
kinda trick to these, too.

365
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,041
[LUCY] I wanna touch them...
but considering what happened

366
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,250
to us last time...

367
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,791
I know that I
probably shouldn't,

368
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,125
but that only makes me want
to touch them even more...

369
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,708
Kinda weird.

370
00:15:56,791 --> 00:16:02,041
[NATSU growls]

371
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,083
[screams]

372
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,625
What do you think
you're doin'?!

373
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:05,750
Oh, sorry...!

374
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,208
That statue just looked
so much like Gray

375
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,833
I just couldn't
help myself!

376
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,083
So much for
not touching...

377
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,083
[rumbling]

378
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,500
Why's the
ground shaking?

379
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:13,875
It feels like there
might be something

380
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,125
comin' this way...

381
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,000
Yeah, I knew
that would happen...

382
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,166
Guess it was smart of me
to bust it after all!

383
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,791
[ROMEO] Um...
I'm not so sure...

384
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,666
[mighty rumbling]

385
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,500
[LUCY] Definitely not
a smart move, Natsu!

386
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,750
Fire Dragon...
Brilliant Flame!

387
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,541
[screams]

388
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,125
[NATSU] I tried my best
but it didn't work!

389
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,833
[LUCY] When are you
ever gonna learn?!

390
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:36,916
[ROMEO] Are those bridges?

391
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,583
[HAPPY] Yeah,
there's three of 'em!

392
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,750
[MICHELLE] I have a feeling
only one of them is real...

393
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,708
[LUCY] We've got no way of
knowing which ones are fake...

394
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:43,791
What now?

395
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:44,833
[NATSU] We don't
have time to hesitate!

396
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,000
I pick right!

397
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:46,875
I pick left!

398
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,375
Maybe it's the
middle one?

399
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,875
Alrighty, Romeo!
You're the tiebreaker!

400
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,958
Uh... Well...
It's the middle one!

401
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,583
[NATSU] Let's go!

402
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,208
[MICHELLE screams]

403
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,375
[HAPPY] Romeo chose correctly!

404
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,791
[ROMEO] Look up ahead!

405
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,208
[MICHELLE] There's one
in front of us, too!

406
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,708
What should we
do now, Natsu?!

407
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,666
It's like we're stuck
in a pincer attack!

408
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,375
Listen up! We gotta jump the
balls right before they collide!

409
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,625
[LUCY] I can't jump that high!

410
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,958
There's gotta be
a way... Damn it!

411
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,208
[ROMEO] Hurry...

412
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,666
Happy, I need you
to pick up and carry

413
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,166
Lucy and Michelle, okay...?

414
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,583
Romeo, I want you to
grab my arm and hold on!

415
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,125
I can take care
of myself, Natsu!

416
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,583
Fine... You're on
your own, kiddo!

417
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:26,708
I don't mind
carrying Michelle but

418
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,166
Lucy's out of the question!

419
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,916
Watch it, flea bag!

420
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,458
[NATSU] Here they come!

421
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,958
[crash]

422
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,250
What'd I tell ya?!

423
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,416
I gotta admit that was
an impressive jump!

424
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,000
Aw yeah!

425
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,000
[HAPPY] Feels like my
right arm's gonna rip off!

426
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:44,250
[LUCY] Shut your yap!

427
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,541
[screams]

428
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:50,875
[screams]

429
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,625
Hey Romeo...!
Grab somethin' with your magic!

430
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,708
Okay...! Here goes!

431
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,041
[MICHELLE] We're doomed!

432
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,541
[LUCY] Not if I can
help it...! It's time to see

433
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:01,750
what this thing can do...!
Let's go Fleuve d'étoiles!

434
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,166
[LUCY] Well that
was terrifying...

435
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,833
you guys okay over there?

436
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,541
[NATSU] Yeah... We're fine...

437
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,791
[ROMEO] Just a little sore...

438
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,708
Geez... How the heck are
we gonna get outta here?

439
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,375
[NATSU] Well, from
the looks of it...

440
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,250
we're gonna have to
work our way down.

441
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,958
[LUCY] That's a lot
easier said than done.

442
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,583
Go and fetch him,
my doggies...!

443
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,125
It's over, baby!

444
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,625
[GRAY] That's what
you think! Got ya!

445
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:36,375
Huh?

446
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,416
That's what I call spicy...!

447
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,000
Wait, I mean, chilly!

448
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,291
[GRAY] Ice Make: Floor!

449
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,333
Watch this!
I'm on fire, baby!

450
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,958
I got a fever
I can't control...!

451
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,541
Ya can't stop this
hunk'a burnin' love!

452
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:50,375
[GRAY] What in the-?!

453
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,666
What happened?!

454
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,000
They just vanished
into thin air!

455
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,291
Doubtful.

456
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,625
More like they went back
to wherever we came from.

457
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:08,666
Which means...

458
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,916
We need to try
and find a way

459
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
to jump into
that light, too!

460
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,083
On the other hand,
if we stay here...

461
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:17,000
I get to spend the rest
of my life with Miss Juvy.

462
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,166
That doesn't sound
so bad to me.

463
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,666
Well, it does to me!

464
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,875
Calm down...
I'm just joking.

465
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,125
Why am I feeling
so exhausted?

466
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,166
This magic must
be to blame.

467
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,833
No, I think
it's you...

468
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,125
Now... Time to break free!

469
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,375
I know that stance!
Not Iced Shell...!

470
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:35,791
Are you insane?!

471
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:39,083
No need to worry... I'm
merely releasing magic power.

472
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,458
Just be careful not to
get caught up in it!

473
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,541
[JUVIA] Oh, right!

474
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:52,791
You shattered it!

475
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,083
Let's go.

476
00:19:58,833 --> 00:19:59,916
What's the matter?

477
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,208
[screams]

478
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,875
We have to catch
that light...!

479
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,833
So I can be reunited
with my love!

480
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,791
Well, it's
going this way.

481
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,875
[GRAY] Would you just give me
the clock piece already?!

482
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,500
[SUGARBOY] You really think I'm
gonna hand it over to you...?!

483
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,833
Please!

484
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,833
[GRAY] You'd better let
go of it right now...!

485
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,125
cuz If you don't I'm gonna...

486
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,000
Fall head over
heels... in love.

487
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,875
Whoa!

488
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,083
Yeah, baby...! A brown
eyed handsome man!

489
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,375
Where'd that
come from?!

490
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,750
Look, just so you know...
I'm not into guys!

491
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,333
Apparently your
heart is as frosty

492
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:35,291
as your biceps are bulging.
In that case, Ice Boy...

493
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,875
I'll force my
feelings on ya...!

494
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:41,416
Yeah...! I'm just a hunk...!
A hunk... of burnin' love!

495
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,833
[GRAY] Aw man...!
that's so hot!

496
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,000
[SUGARBOY] It's
spicy, ain't it...?

497
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,791
Just a lil' somethin' I picked
up from your pal Natsu...

498
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,125
You know, now that
I think about it,

499
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,833
he's kind of a
man's man, too.

500
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,208
[GRAY] I'll show you...!
This ain't nothin'...!

501
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,208
I can bust outta here!

502
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,500
Oh. That look...!
I like it!

503
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:05,250
Come on Ice Boy, let's boogie!

504
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,750
[LYON] Gray...! Haven't you had
enough of this buffoon...?!

505
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,375
How long are you going to let
him have his way with you?!

506
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,750
Get your act together...!
I won't have you bringing

507
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,375
shame to Ur!

508
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,416
[GRAY] No way
that's gonna happen!

509
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,833
It's got nothing
to do with Ur...!

510
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:23,625
And I would never do anything
to tarnish her reputation!

511
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,583
Gray, my love...!
Attack him now!

512
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,916
He's open!

513
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,750
Game over! Like I said,
when I'm done with you...

514
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,791
you're gonna wish you never
messed with Fairy Tail!

515
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:36,000
Whoa... man,
hot diggety...!

516
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,791
I'll be taking this with me.

517
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:46,875
Why...? Why...?!
C'mon, don't be cruel...!

518
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,916
Why do you have go on and check
me in to the Heartbreak Hotel?!

519
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,875
[ROMEO] Hey guys...
where are we?

520
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,333
[MICHELLE] It must be the
lowest level of the tomb.

521
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,291
[HAPPY] It looks
more like a city to me.

522
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,791
[LUCY] The monks who were
charged with guarding

523
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:06,333
Zentopia's Holy Tomb lived
their entire lives down here...

524
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,875
At least, according to
legend... Can you imagine

525
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,958
never stepping foot outside?

526
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:12,541
[NATSU] We've gotta find
a little clock piece

527
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,166
in a huge place like this?

528
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,875
[ROMEO] What's wrong? Can't
you just sniff it out, Natsu?

529
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,375
[NATSU] Nah, it's like
the clock hand...

530
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,250
For some reason,
I can't really smell it.

531
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,291
[gasps]

532
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:22,458
[sniffs]

533
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,458
Whoa... Hey...
Do you guys smell that...?

534
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:25,708
Where's it coming from?

535
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:26,916
Ugh.

536
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,916
I've got the chills...
Something feels wrong...

537
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,250
[gasps]

538
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,208
[LUCY] I hate being
right all the time...

539
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:46,875
♪

540
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,125
[HAPPY] Dontcha think
creepy places like this

541
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:14,666
are kinda exciting?

542
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,416
[NATSU] Yeah, yeah, but let's
not forget why we're here,

543
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,666
lil' buddy.

544
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,000
[HAPPY] Of course not!
We're here to explore.

545
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,791
[NATSU] No, man! Is this
some sort of game to you?

546
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,583
You'll get left behind
with that attitude.

547
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:24,791
[HAPPY] Wow, I'm not used
to you bein' so serious.

548
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:26,541
[NATSU] Well, that's the way
it's gotta be 'cause I want

549
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:27,666
our team to get it first!

550

[HAPPY] Ya see?
It really is a game!

551
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:32,208
[HAPPY and NATSU] Next time:
Footprints of the Myth!

552
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:34,375
This ain't a game...!
It's a competition!

553
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,583
[HAPPY] Same difference!
Whatever, let's get going.

554
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:38,875
Just follow along and
try not to get lost.

555
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:41,291
[NATSU] Huh...?! But
I thought I was the leader?!
