1
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:22,208
- YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG.

2
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:25,708
( shouting ) WE'RE FAIRY TAIL
WIZARDS, WE DON'T WORK FOR YOU!

3
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,000
- MEOW...

4
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:34,250
- MY MR. NICHIYA, DO YOU
THINK THOSE TWO ARE...

5
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:38,250
- COME ON, CARLA, WE'RE LEAVING.

6
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,458
- ( theme song playing )

7
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

8
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,291
- ( panting )

9
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,541
- MEOW.

10
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:16,541
- ( exclaiming )

11
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:17,875
- LET THEM COME AFTER US,

12
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,958
I'M NEVER GOING TO
ABANDON MY FRIENDS.

13
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,833
I PROMISE THAT
WE'RE GOING TO SAVE YOU.

14
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,250
- HAVE THEY GONE MAD?

15
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,458
- THEY'RE FALLEN ANGELS.

16
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:34,208
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS FALLENS.

17
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,708
- I SEE, THEY'VE BEEN TAINTED BY
THE ABOMINABLE ESSENCE

18
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,708
OF EARTH LAND AND
LOST THEIR DIVINITY.

19
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:42,958
- MEOW!

20
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,375
- Nadi: TWO FALLENS ARE
ON THE LOOSE IN THE CITY.

21
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,833
- Nichiya: ROYAL GUARD,
HUNT THEM DOWN.

22
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,208
- ( Happy reading )

23
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,875
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

24
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,416
HAPPY WOULD NEVER
TURN HIS BACK ON US.

25
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,458
THAT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE.

26
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:08,750
WHAT DID YOU JERKS
DO TO MY BUDDY? TELL ME!

27
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,166
- ( grunting )

28
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,458
- TOO SCARED TO FACE ME?
- NATSU...

29
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,416
- THEN I'LL JUST HAVE
TO COME TO YOU!

30
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,333
FIRE DRAGON, ROAR!

31
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,458
- I COULD'VE TOLD YOU THAT
WASN'T GOING TO WORK.

32
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,375
- ( mumbling )

33
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,083
- WHERE ARE YOU, CARLA?

34
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,583
- ( gasps ) HEY.
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

35
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,458
IS THIS A JOKE OR SOMETHING?

36
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:46,708
SOMEBODY'S HEAD'S GOING TO ROLL

37
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,416
IF I'M NOT OUT OF
THIS THING SOON.

38
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,583
I REMEMBER NOW. WE WERE ALL
CAPTURED IN THE MINE.

39
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,666
WE GOT SO CLOSE,

40
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,750
AND THEN IT WAS OVER.
THEY TOOK US ALL AWAY.

41
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,791
IF YOU JERKS HURT MY FRIENDS,
I'M GOING TO RIP YOU A NEW ONE.

42
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:05,958
DO YOU HEAR ME?

43
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,541
- UNFORTUNATELY.

44
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,458
- ( rumbling )

45
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,666
- MEOW? WHAT'S ALL
THAT RUCKUS ABOUT?

46
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,416
- OH, MAYBE IT'S
ANOTHER CATERPILLAR.

47
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,666
- YOU REALLY NEED TO
GET OVER THAT, MAN.

48
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,833
- WELL, WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S COMING FROM THE CASTLE.

49
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,083
- HUH?

50
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,541
- WAIT, I THINK I SEE SOMEONE.

51
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,541
- EVERYBODY GET OUT OF THE WAY.

52
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,166
- ( grunting )

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,250
- AIN'T THOSE TWO THEM
HEROES FROM BEFORE?

54
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,208
AND THE ROYAL GUARD?

55
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:42,166
- DON'T LET THEM ESCAPE. MEOW.

56
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,125
- ( panting )

57
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,958
- ( grunting )

58
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,833
- ( panting )

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,291
( wheezing ) NOT TIRED.
NOT AT ALL.

60
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,958
I MUST APPREHEND
THE FALLENS AT ONCE.

61
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,583
AND LIVE UP TO THE
QUEEN'S EXPECTATIONS.

62
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:10,208
IT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM, I'M A
STRONG AND HEALTHY YOUNG MAN.

63
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,000
- ( screaming )

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,666
- CARLA, I'LL SAVE YOU.

65
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,958
- HAPPY.

66
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,541
- DON'T WORRY,
I WON'T LET YOU GO AGAIN.

67
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,083
- ( crashing )

68
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,083
- ( groaning )

69
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,208
- HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

70
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,625
IS THE GROUND
SPINNING FOR YOU, TOO?

71
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:09,375
- WELL, NOTHING SEEMS
TO BE BROKEN.

72
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,208
- ( gasping )

73
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,333
HAPPY, LOOK AT THAT.

74
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,416
- A GIANT LACRIMA IN THE SKY.

75
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,125
- IT'S EVEN BIGGER THAN
THE ONE IN ROYAL CITY.

76
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:23,125
- OUR FRIENDS MUST BE
INSIDE THAT ONE.

77
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:26,458
I THOUGHT THE ONE IN THE CITY
LOOKED TOO SMALL.

78
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,125
- SPEAKING OF WHICH...

79
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:35,875
- WHOA. WHAT'S THE CAPITAL DOING
SO FAR BELOW US? IT'S TINY!

80
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:39,000
- EXTALIA MUST BE BUILT ON ONE
OF THE FLOATING ISLANDS.

81
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,416
IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS HOW
EVERYTHING IS POSITIONED.

82
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,833
- BUT HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO GET BACK DOWN TO THE CITY?

83
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,583
- UNTIL WE CAN
USE OUR MAGIC,

84
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,500
I'M AFRAID THAT WE MAY
BE STUCK UP HERE.

85
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,125
- ( sighing )

86
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,416
NATSU...

87
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,791
- HEY, YA LITTLE VARMINTS.

88
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,791
WHAT IN THE QUEEN'S BREECHES
ARE YA'LL DOING IN MY FIELD?

89
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,458
- NO, THEY FOUND US!

90
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,791
- I WAS EXPECTING A COUPLE
OF DEAD BEATS,

91
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,500
BUT I CAUGHT TROUBLE
MAKERS INSTEAD.

92
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,666
YOU'RE THEM FALLENS, AIN'T YA?

93
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,166
HMM.

94
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,000
( yelling )

95
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,833
NOW GET ON OUT OF HERE.

96
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:22,083
- FINE. JUST QUIT
SCREAMING AT US.

97
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:25,208
- MEOW. KEEP YOUR
PEEPERS PEELED

98
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,291
FOR THAT VICIOUS
HIT AND RUN CART.

99
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:32,000
IT'S HERE SOMEWHERE,
SO FIND IT AT ONCE. MEOW.

100
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,708
- THEY'RE ALREADY ON OUR TAILS!

101
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:36,916
- NOW!

102
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,083
- ( screaming )

103
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,375
- I TOLD YOU TWO TO SCRAM!

104
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,916
- YES, SIR. OKAY, WE'RE
SCRAMMING RIGHT NOW.

105
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,791
- THEN COME OVER TO MY PLACE.

106
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:45,916
- HUH?

107
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,625
- Happy: WHAT ABOUT
THOSE SOLDIERS?

108
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:55,500
OH, I GET IT. YOU ALREADY
REPORTED US, DIDN'T YOU?

109
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:56,958
- NO!

110
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,916
- ( exclaiming )
I WAS JUST ASKING A QUESTION.

111
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,833
- HELLO, DEAR. DID YOU FINISH
WORKING OUT

112
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,208
IN THE FIELDS, ALREADY?

113
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,583
Oh. I SEE WE HAVE SOME GUESTS.

114
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,458
- YEAH.
SORRY TO TROUBLE YOU.

115
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,583
- OH, IT'S NO TROUBLE.

116
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,541
- THANKS. I'M HAPPY.

117
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,083
- AND I'M CARLA.

118
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,875
- MY. THOSE ARE SUCH
WONDERFUL NAMES.

119
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,125
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU COME
INSIDE AND WASH UP?

120
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,291
YOU POOR THINGS. IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'VE HAD A ROUGH DAY.

121
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,708
- MR. LUCKY, MISS MARL,
THANKS FOR LETTING US

122
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,500
HIDE OUT HERE FOR A WHILE.

123
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:44,541
- ( exclaims in anger ) USE THAT
MOUTH FOR CHEWING, NOT YAPPING.

124
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,916
- AYE!
- YOU'RE VERY KIND.

125
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,750
- PLEASE EXCUSE MY HUSBAND.

126
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,416
HE DOESN'T EXACTLY SEE
EYE TO EYE WITH THE KINGDOM.

127
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,666
HE'S SO VOCAL ABOUT IT
THEY KICKED US OUT.

128
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,125
AND WE'VE BEEN LIVING ON THIS
LITTLE FARM EVER SINCE.

129
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,083
- ( exclaims in anger ) WHAT DID
YOU GO AND TELL THEM THAT FOR?

130
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,625
- OH, NO REASON.

131
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,958
- I GET IT. THAT'S WHY
YOU HELPED US ESCAPE.

132
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,583
- BELIEVE WHAT YOU WANT, KID.

133
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:11,333
IF YOU'RE GOING TO STAY HERE,
YOU'RE GOING TO WORK HERE. OKAY?

134
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,083
- AYE. YES, SIR!

135
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,958
- ALL RIGHT THEN,
SO YOU BETTER EAT.

136
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,666
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED THE ENERGY.

137
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,958
YOU HEAR ME? MUNCH!

138
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,416
- ( chuckling )

139
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,666
- ( grunting )

140
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,166
- ( exclaims in anger )

141
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,416
PUT YOUR BACK INTO IT, KID.
YOU WANT TO BE A MAN, RIGHT?

142
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,416
- I DON'T GET IT.

143
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,375
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO
WITH BECOMING A MAN?

144
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:36,708
- NO BACK TALK. NOW LESS
CROWING AND MORE HOEING.

145
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,458
- AYE, SIR. HOEING AWAY.

146
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,833
- ( grunting )

147
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,916
MR. LUCKY, DO YOU REALLY WORK
WITH THESE HEAVY TOOLS

148
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,750
EVERY DAY? I FEEL LIKE
I'M GOING TO BREAK MY BACK.

149
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,791
- THAT MEANS YOU'RE ONE
WITH THE TOOL.

150
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,583
ITS WEIGHT COMES
FROM THE HEAVINESS

151
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,250
OF YOUR HEART AND SOUL. GOT IT?

152
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,708
- YEAH, I SEE. THIS GUY
IS OVER-THE-TOP

153
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,041
EVEN WHEN HE'S WORKING.

154
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,041
HE'D BLOW A GASKET IF HE
HEARD ME SAY THAT,

155
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,625
SO I SHOULD WATCH MY FISH HOLE.

156
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:06,041
- ( exclaims in anger )
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT, KID.

157
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,583
- I'M SORRY!

158
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,958
( grunting )

159
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,166
- NO. YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG.

160
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,708
A REAL MAN WOULD
DO IT LIKE THIS.

161
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,875
SEE? YOU GOTTA PUT
YOUR BACK INTO IT.

162
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,166
- "A REAL MAN"?

163
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:29,250
- THERE. NOW THAT'S HOW YOU
TEND A FIELD, YOU SEE?

164
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,583
- WHOA.
THAT'S AMAZING, MISTER.

165
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,291
- QUIT GAWKING.

166
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,500
- HE ALREADY FORGOT
HE TOLD ME TO WATCH HIM?

167
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,625
MAN, THIS GUY'S GOT
SOME ISSUES.

168
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,166
BUT HE'LL GET MAD IF I
POINT THAT OUT,

169
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,125
SO I SHOULD JUST KEEP MY
TROUT TRAP SHUT.

170
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:45,333
- YOU ALREADY FORGET
I CAN HEAR YOU? HUH?

171
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,541
- SORRY AGAIN.

172
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,333
- MY, MY.
YOU'RE QUITE SKILLED.

173
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,708
- IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE. ALL DONE.

174
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,208
- THANK YOU, DEAR.

175
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,166
-I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO PICK UP THE PACE.

176
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,333
- WELL, THEY'RE GETTING ALONG.

177
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,000
( laughs )

178
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,000
- CAN'T WE TAKE A BREAK?
COME ON, I'M DYING OVER HERE.

179
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,083
- IF YOU CAN TALK,
YOU CAN WORK, KID.

180
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:17,000
- Marl: WHY DON'T YOU STRONG MEN
TAKE A BREATHER FOR A BIT.

181
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,666
WE'VE MADE SOME COLD DRINKS!

182
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,166
- SWEET MERCY.

183
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,291
- STOP. YOU BETTER NOT THINK OF
DRINKING THAT BEFORE ME.

184
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,750
- UH. NO, SIR.

185
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,458
- I'M GLAD THEY LET ME OUT OF
THAT WOODEN PIECE OF JUNK.

186
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:49,916
BUT DID THEY HAVE TO SUBSTITUTE
IT WITH THIS FREAKY BLOB?

187
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,416
HEY, OUT THERE.

188
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,375
I DON'T SUPPOSE WE CAN DO
ANYTHING ABOUT THE GOOP, HUH?

189
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,333
JUST SEEMS A BIT EXCESSIVE,
THAT'S ALL.

190
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,333
- IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN ESCAPE.

191
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,791
- WE SHOULD HAVE PUT
SOME ON HER MOUTH.

192
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,916
- GEEZ, ARE EARTH LAND MEN
DEAF OR SOMETHING?

193
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,541
HOW DO THEY PUT UP WITH THIS?

194
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,625
- HMM, MY KEYS AREN'T
WORKING ANYMORE.

195
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,916
MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY
PUT THIS GUNK ON ME.

196
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
MUST BE BLOCKING MY
POWER SOMEHOW.

197
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:16,208
MAN, THIS SUCKS. I HOPE THE
OTHERS ARE DOING BETTER.

198
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,000
- I KNEW I COULD COUNT ON YOU.

199
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,791
NOW GET ME BACK TO THE GUILD,
WE GOT WORK TO DO.

200
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,708
- Natsu: WELL, I DID
WHAT YOU SAID.

201
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,375
DROPPED THE LOT OF THEM
IN THE ROYAL CITY'S BACK YARD.

202
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,083
SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE SERIOUS
ABOUT TAKING ON

203
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,666
THE ROYAL ARMY,
TOO. PRETTY CRAZY.

204
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,166
- YEAH. BETTER THAN
RUNNING, THOUGH.

205
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,791
SO, HOW'S THE RIDE? WERE YOU
ABLE TO REFILL ITS LACRIMA?

206
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,791
- THAT'S A NEGATIVE.

207
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,833
THE ARMY HAD ALREADY RAIDED
THE BLACK MARKET SPOTS

208
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,166
I COULD THINK OF TRYING.

209
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,708
THERE PROBABLY ISN'T A SHARD
FROM HERE TO SYCCA.

210
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,583
HOPE WE CAN MAKE IT BACK
TO THE GUILD.

211
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:59,833
WE MAY BE WALKING
THE LAST MILE OR TWO.

212
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,416
UNBELIEVABLE. YOU JUST
HAD TO SEND ME ON

213
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,166
YOUR LITTLE ERRAND. JEEZ.

214
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,250
SOMEONE'S GONE SOFT-HEARTED.
NOT THAT I'M COMPLAINING.

215
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:13,041
- ARE YOU TRYING TO FLIRT
WITH ME? IN YOUR DREAMS!

216
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,750
- I DIDN'T MEAN TO,
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

217
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:18,666
- HAVE A TASTE OF TECHNIQUE 31,
THE BRAWNY BOMBER.

218
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,291
- ( screaming )

219
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:23,208
- UGH. I'M GRATEFUL THAT
THE OLD TIMER

220
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,666
IS LETTING US HIDE HERE.

221
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,250
BUT DOES HE HAVE TO WORK ME
LIKE A DOG THE WHOLE TIME?

222
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,333
- WANT TO TAKE YOUR CHANCES
WITH THE SOLDIERS,

223
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,416
OR SWEEP
THE ROOF SPOTLESS?

224
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,208
- I'LL SWEEP.
HOW DID HE HEAR ME FROM THERE?

225
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,791
THIS REALLY ISN'T THE TIME
FOR ME TO BE DOING THIS.

226
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,583
COME ON. YOUR FRIENDS
ARE IN TROUBLE

227
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,750
AND THEY NEED YOU
TO HELP THEM OUT!

228
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:46,125
( exclaiming )

229
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,500
- ( exclaims in anger )
KEEP GETTING DISTRACTED

230
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,291
AND YOU'LL HAND
SCRUB THE TOILET.

231
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,666
- NO!

232
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,875
- ONCE YOU FINISH THE ROOF,
YOU'RE CHOPPING FIREWOOD

233
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,208
FOR AN HOUR. GOT IT?

234
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,541
- AYE, SIR.

235
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,333
- ( humming )

236
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,083
YOU HAVEN'T SMILED
THIS WHOLE TIME.

237
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:07,041
I'M SURE YOU COULD
BRIGHTEN UP THE ENTIRE ROOM.

238
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,791
ARE THINGS REALLY SO BAD
YOU CAN'T CRACK A SMILE?

239
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,375
- I'M JUST NOT IN THE
SMILING MOOD, THAT'S ALL.

240
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,916
- IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING
PAINFUL MUST'VE HAPPENED.

241
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,708
IT MAY SEEM BAD NOW,
BUT YOU'LL SMILE AGAIN.

242
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,041
- I DOUBT IT.

243
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:27,291
- YOU SAY THAT
BUT, TRUST ME, IT'LL HAPPEN.

244
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:35,041
- ( exclaiming )
NOW THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

245
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,416
- ( exclaims in anger )
YOU TAKING A NAP THERE?

246
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,708
QUIT DAWDLING OR
YOU'LL NEVER CATCH UP.

247
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,916
- WHOA. SO FAST!

248
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,083
FINE, I'LL SHOW YOU I CAN DO IT.

249
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,958
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO WIN THIS ONE.

250
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,041
- AYE, SIR. AYE, SIR.
AYE, SIR. AYE, SIR.

251
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,708
- ( grunting )

252
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,500
- AYE, SIR!
- YOU CAN'T BEAT ME, KID!

253
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,708
- WE'LL JUST SEE ABOUT THAT,
YOU OLD TIMER.

254
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,958
- HAH. I AIN'T OLD YET.

255
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,833
- OKAY, I'M DOWN TO ONE MORE.

256
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,041
- YEAH. THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

257
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,458
- ( both grunting )

258
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,333
( both screaming )

259
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,333
( both laughing )

260
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,666
- HEY. WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?

261
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,250
- I DON'T KNOW.

262
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,750
- WELL, I SUPPOSE THAT'S ENOUGH
FIREWOOD FOR ONE DAY.

263
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,166
- YOU GOT OFF EASY, KID.
- I'M POOPED.

264
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,208
AND I SMELL LIKE A
THREE DAY OLD SALMON.

265
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,958
- GAH. THEN TAKE A BATH!

266
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,416
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING!

267
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,416
- Wendy: CARLA!

268
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,708
WAIT UP, I'M COMING WITH YOU.

269
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:41,916
( exclaims )

270
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,958
- HUMANS ARE CLUMSY.

271
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,166
LOOK HERE, IF YOU'RE GOING TO
KEEP GETTING HURT

272
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,416
TRYING TO FOLLOW ME,

273
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,916
WHY DO IT?

274
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,708
- BECAUSE...

275
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:55,083
- YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE AN ANSWER.
YOU SHOULD GO BACK TO THE GUILD.

276
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,541
- I DON'T WANT TO.

277
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,625
'CAUSE, YOU AND ME ARE FRIENDS
NOW, AREN'T WE?

278
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,166
- HUH? YOU AND I ARE FRIENDS?

279
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,625
- ( chuckles ) YEAH. OF COURSE.

280
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,041
HEY, CARLA!

281
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:15,625
- ( sighs ) THAT WAS THE MOST
RELAXING BATH OF MY LIFE.

282
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:19,375
- ( sighs )

283
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,208
- WHO ARE YOU, HAPPY AND CARLA?

284
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,166
I THOUGHT THAT YOU
WERE OUR FRIENDS.

285
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,041
- I BETRAYED HER.

286
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,125
- GOOD WORK OUT THERE,
YOUNG MAN.

287
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,083
FEELS GREAT TO RELAX
AFTER HARD WORK

288
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,291
AND A NICE BATH, DOESN'T IT?

289
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,291
- SURE DOES.
I NEEDED THAT.

290
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,458
- SO TELL ME, HAPPY AND CARLA,
YOU'RE NOT FROM HERE.

291
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,958
WERE YOU HATCHED IN EARTH LAND,
BY ANY CHANCE?

292
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,708
WERE YOU GIVEN YOUR NAMES
BY SOMEONE FROM THERE?

293
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,458
- UH-HUH. BY MY FRIEND, NATSU.

294
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:50,333
- I, TOO WAS NAMED
BY A FRIEND.

295
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,791
- BUT NOW THEY'RE BEING
HELD CAPTIVE

296
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,250
IN THE ROYAL CITY BELOW.

297
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,625
WE GOTTA SAVE THEM,

298
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,583
'CAUSE IT'S OUR FAULT
THEY'RE THERE.

299
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,083
- SO YOU INTEND TO
RESCUE THE HUMANS?

300
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,875
- THAT'S WHY WE'RE FALLENS.

301
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,416
CARING ABOUT
HUMANS SEEMS TO BE

302
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,375
A BIZARRE CONCEPT HERE.

303
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,166
- I DON'T THINK
IT'S BIZARRE AT ALL.

304
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:10,625
IN FACT, IT'S WONDERFUL. IF
SOMEONE IS YOUR FRIEND,

305
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,291
IT SHOULDN'T MATTER IF
THEY'RE HUMAN OR EXCEED.

306
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,958
AFTER ALL EVEN THOUGH WE MAY
LOOK DIFFERENT ON THE OUTSIDE,

307
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,458
INTERNALLY, OUR HEARTS
SHARE THE SAME SHAPE.

308
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,166
- I'M AFRAID I DON'T
FOLLOW YOUR LOGIC.

309
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,291
- WELL, WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY
IS LOVE IS THE SAME,

310
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,625
NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE.

311
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,916
- ( sighs )

312
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:34,458
I WISH THAT APPLIED TO ME.

313
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,708
REGARDLESS OF THE
SHAPE OF MY HEART,

314
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:40,250
OR THE LOVE IT HAS TO GIVE,
IT'S NOT UNDER MY CONTROL.

315
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:44,625
EVEN NOW, I CAN'T BE SURE THAT
THE WORDS I'M SAYING ARE MINE

316
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,625
OR PART OF SOMEONE ELSE'S PLAN.

317
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,333
- I KNOW THEY'RE
YOUR WORDS, CARLA,

318
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,541
YOU'RE TOO STRONG TO LET
SOMEONE CONTROL YOU.

319
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,125
AND I KNOW OUR HEARTS
WANT THE SAME THING,

320
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:58,166
TO DEFEAT THE ROYAL ARMY
AND SAVE OUR FRIENDS.

321
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,125
- YOU THINK WE CAN?
- I KNOW YOU CAN.

322
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,625
THINGS MAY SEEM A LITTLE
CONFUSING FOR YOU AT THE MOMENT,

323
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,583
BUT YOU SHOULD NEVER
GIVE UP HOPE.

324
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,625
YOU'VE GOT A WONDERFUL KNIGHT
THAT WILL BE AT YOUR SIDE

325
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:08,791
FOR THE JOURNEY.

326
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:12,250
- ( gasps ) IS SHE TALKING
ABOUT ME?

327
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,750
- I UNDERSTAND YOU MAY FEEL
LIKE YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART.

328
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,958
BUT I THINK YOU FOUND IT
LONG AGO.

329
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:27,791
NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
LEARN TO EMBRACE IT,

330
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,958
BELIEVE IN IT, AND TRUST
YOUR FEELINGS OF LOVE.

331
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,333
- ( chuckles )

332
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,333
- THERE, YOU SEE,

333
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,333
A WONDERFUL SMILE
WAS JUST WAITING TO COME OUT.

334
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,875
I'M GLAD I GOT TO SEE IT.

335
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,750
- YOU SURPRISE ME, MISS MARL.

336
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,166
- WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

337
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,333
- 'CAUSE THE EXCEEDS
WE'VE MET SO FAR,

338
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,500
ALL THOUGHT OF THEMSELVES
AS CELESTIAL BEINGS,

339
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:52,750
AND THEIR QUEEN AS DIVINE.

340
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,041
THEY EVEN CALLED HUMANS
AN INFERIOR SPECIES.

341
00:18:55,125 --> 00:19:00,750
- AH, YES. TRUTH BE TOLD, I
USED TO BELIEVE THE SAME THING.

342
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:05,125
THEN, ONE DAY, OUR BELOVED QUEEN
TOOK OUR CHILDREN FROM US.

343
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,500
ONE HUNDRED CHILDREN,
STILL IN THEIR EGGS,

344
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:11,208
WERE TAKEN FROM THEIR HOMES.
THEY GAVE US NO WARNING

345
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,708
AND WE WERE TOLD
JUST TO ACCEPT IT.

346
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,833
THE QUEEN HAD CHOSEN
THEM TO ELIMINATE

347
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,291
THE DRAGON SLAYERS.

348
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:21,208
THEY WERE ALL SENT TO EARTH LAND
AGAINST OUR WISHES.

349
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:25,166
WHEN WE OPPOSED THE CRUELTY
OF THE PROJECT, WE WERE EXILED.

350
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,583
WE NEVER EVEN GOT TO SEE
OUR CHILDREN'S FACES.

351
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,666
AFTER THAT, EVERYTHING CHANGED.

352
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,875
WE REALIZED THE LIE WE HAD
BEEN SUBJECTED TO.

353
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,166
SHE WASN'T A GOD.

354
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,083
AND THE REST OF US CERTAINLY
WEREN'T ANGELS.

355
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,666
WE WERE JUST PARENTS.

356
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:45,083
ONCE WE REALIZED THIS, THE LINES
BETWEEN HUMAN AND EXCEED

357
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,708
ALL BUT VANISHED FOR US.

358
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,125
IT DIDN'T MATTER ANYMORE.

359
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,791
MY HUSBAND MAY SEEM
OPINIONATED AT TIMES,

360
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,250
BUT HE FEELS THE SAME WAY
THAT I DO.

361
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,666
- WOMAN, QUIT WASTING TIME
YAPPING ABOUT NONSENSE

362
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,833
WITH THESE KIDS.

363
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,333
HOW LONG ARE THEY
PLANNING TO STAY HERE?

364
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,708
- CALM DOWN.

365
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,000
- I'M SICK OF THAT
LOOK ON YOUR FACE.

366
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:07,083
DON'T YOU REALIZE
YOU'RE LUCKY TO BE ALIVE, HUH?

367
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,583
NOW GROW A PAIR!

368
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,500
I WANT YOU OUT OF MY HOUSE, NOW.

369
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,166
- OH, BUT, DEAR,
THIS IS MUCH TOO SUDDEN.

370
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,333
- NO, HE'S RIGHT. WE DON'T HAVE
TIME TO LOUNGE AROUND ANYMORE.

371
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,791
OUR FRIENDS ARE DOWN THERE, AND
WE GOTTA DO EVERYTHING WE CAN

372
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,625
TO MAKE SURE THEY GET HOME.

373
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,125
- AT LEAST YOU FINALLY GET IT.
SCAREDY-CATS CAN'T DO NOTHING.

374
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,166
I SWEAR, THESE STUPID
KIDS THESE DAYS

375
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,916
NEED IT SPELLED OUT FOR THEM.

376
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:41,541
- THANKS, OLD TIMER. YOU TOO,
MA'AM. WE'LL NEVER FORGET YOU.

377
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,416
- GAH. DON'T COME BACK,
YOU BRATS.

378
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,041
- TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER,
YOU HEAR?

379
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,125
- HEY, CARLA,
DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,

380
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,833
BUT I FEEL LIKE WE WERE DESTINED
TO MEET THOSE TWO TODAY.

381
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,208
- YES. I FEEL THE SAME WAY.

382
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,500
- WHEN WE FIRST CAME TO EDOLAS,
I WASN'T SURE ABOUT

383
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,500
A LOT OF THINGS.

384
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,458
I FELT LIKE I WAS LOST.

385
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,416
- SO DID I.

386
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,041
- BUT NOW...
- THE PATH IS ALL TOO CLEAR.

387
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,000
WE WON'T LET OUR PASTS
HOLD US BACK.

388
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,833
WE GOTTA FLY FORWARD AND
PROTECT OUR FRIENDS.

389
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:21,291
- HAPPY AND I ARE EXCEEDS,
THE ONLY RACE IN EDOLAS

390
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:24,541
THAT'S BORN WITH MAGIC POWER
PULSING THROUGH OUR VEINS.

391
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,625
THE ONLY REASON WE COULDN'T
USE OUR MAGIC BEFORE,

392
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,333
WAS BECAUSE WE'D LOST
ALL SENSE OF WHO WE WERE!

393
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,541
NOW, WE KNOW THAT BEING EXCEEDS
DOESN'T DEFINE US.

394
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,666
OUR HEARTS ARE TELLING US
WHERE TO GO,

395
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,500
AND OUR WINGS WILL
TAKE US THERE.

396
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:46,208
LET'S GO. WE CAN'T KEEP
EVERYONE WAITING.

397
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,916
- RIGHT BEHIND YOU!

398
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,583
- GAH. WOULD YOU LOOK AT
THAT, MARL?

399
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,791
THE BOY CAN FLY AFTER ALL.

400
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,833
- THE WAY HE DOES REMINDS
ME OF YOU, LUCKY.

401
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,666
- WHAT ARE YOU BLABBERING ABOUT?

402
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,541
LAZY BUM AIN'T NOTHING LIKE ME.

403
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,625
- WHATEVER YOU SAY.

404
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,625
( crying )

405
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:25,625
AND HE FOUND SUCH A
WONDERFUL GIRLFRIEND.

406
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,791
- GAH. IT'S A HUNDRED
YEARS TOO EARLY

407
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,375
TO BRING A GIRL BACK
TO THE HOUSE, YOU HEAR?

408
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,166
- HE'S GROWN UP INTO
SUCH A FINE BOY

409
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,041
THAT CARES DEEPLY
FOR HIS FRIENDS.

410
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,750
- GAH!

411
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,083
AYE!

412
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:42,000
- ( theme song playing )

413
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,041
- ( singing in Japanese )

414
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,750
- Happy: THIS FEELS WEIRD,
DOESN'T IT, NATSU?

415
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:17,958
I MEAN, I'M THE ONE WHO'S COMING
TO SAVE YOU FOR A CHANGE.

416
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,333
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
IT'S KINDA EXCITING.

417
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:22,541
YOU MIND IF I TAKE THE SPOTLIGHT
AND BE THE MAIN CHARACTER

418
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:23,791
FOR A BIT?

419
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:25,000
- Natsu: JUST HURRY UP
AND RESCUE ME ALREADY.

420
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,625
- Happy: WHAT? COME ON, MAN.

421
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:28,958
WHERE'S YOUR
ENTHUSIASM? TRY AGAIN.

422
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:31,000
- Natsu: SOMEBODY'S PERSONALITY
DID A ONE-EIGHTY.

423
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,291
- Both: NEXT TIME, CODE ETD.

424
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:34,541
- Natsu: KEEP TALKING LIKE THAT,

425
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:35,833
AND EVERYONE WILL THINK
YOU'RE A SUPER VILLAIN

426
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:37,250
INSTEAD OF A HERO.

427
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,458
- Happy: A SUPER VILLAIN?
I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.

428
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:41,541
- Natsu: GREAT,
JUST WHAT WE NEED.
