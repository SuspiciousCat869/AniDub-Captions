I can see 'em!
Fairy Tail is coming home!

Over here, hurry,
come check 'em all out!

Took you guys long enough!

We're all so proud
of you, welcome back!

All right, then!

00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,125
People of Magnolia, let's give
a big round of applause

00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:39,000
to Fairy Tail, winning guild

You saw! You conquered!

Now this is a party!

Aye, Sir!

13
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,083
We kicked every
magic butt we saw!

[HAPPY]
That makes us the champs!

Wow, there are so many
people here!

16
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,750
I honestly wasn't expecting
this grand of an entrance,

17
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:27,750
it's overwhelming.

18
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:31,583
Woohoo!
Fairy Tail's the greatest!

You're the only girl for me!

Thank you!

21
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,708
So how awesome is
the view up there!

22
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,250
It's awesome, but just
a little embarrassing.

23
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,458
Wow! This is quite a homecoming.

24
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,541
Cause we put
Fairy Tail back on top!

25

I'd like to thank each
and every one of you

for cheering us on at the games.

if you want them to hear you!

She even took on Kagura!

her on a broken leg!

I think you may
have to get over that.

Is that the king's
frickin' crown?

You didn't steal it
from him did you?

[NATSU] Oops, you weren't
supposed to see that.

They're going to throw you
back in the dungeon, Natsu!

The symbol of our victory!
A super shiny cup!

to at least act happy
for your friends.

like to present Fairy Tail

Haven't had a job
since before the games.

Should be a breeze, compared
to all those fights we had.

Erza and Gray ran off to?

I saw them leave earlier.

They were going to
do a job with Wendy.

[HAPPY] What? But we're all
on a team, why would they leave

109
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,375
without even telling
us about it?

110

[KINANA]
From what I gathered,

111
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,791
it was gonna
be really simple.

112
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,958
something they could take
care of by themselves.

113
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,166
Sounds like we've got
some catching up to do.

job are we gonna take?

Sure, it's all yours!

122
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,833
But you'll need to go to
Dromar's Village for it.

123
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,458
[HAPPY] I don't think
I've ever heard of it.

124

So, you wanna tell
us how to get there?

Check out the
library downstairs.

that's where we keep 'em.

[NATSU] Wait, the monster
hunt is for a mole?

00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,833
I guess.

129
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,583
Apparently a huge one's been
tearing up their farmland,

130
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,083
so they put out a hit
out on it. Let's do it!

131
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,375
It's only about a three-hour
trip for us to get there!

132
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,791
Three whole hours in a wagon?

133
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,791
[NATSU moaning]
Stop the wagon. I'm dying.

134

I know that you're
in pain Natsu,

135
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,000
but could you moan
a bit more quietly?

136
00:07:58,916 --> 00:07:59,791
That's weird.

137

[HAPPY]
Did you see something'?

138
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:04,750
Well I thought I just saw our
first master cross the road.

139
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,875
Guess I just imagined it.

140
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,541
Well, this is as close as
I can get to Dromar, kids.

141
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,791
[ALL]
Huh?

142
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,583
[HAPPY] Whoa!
[NATSU] What the heck happened?

143
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,875
[DRIVER 201A] As you can see,
the town's been having some

144
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,083
drainage issues lately.

145
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,041
I have to take a pretty
big detour around it

146
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,958
to get to the next stop.

147
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,291
Crazy! You think
people still live here?

148
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,291
Course they do!
The place looks awesome!

149
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,375
There could be a bunch
of fish in there, too!

150
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,791
Probably not. I think that
used to be regular ground.

You young ones must be the

I'm the village elder,
pleasure to meet you!

155
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,666
[LUCY] One mole did
all this damage?

156

[LUCY]
I am so very far from okay.

[HAPPY] The mole won,
Natsu. Let's go home.

315
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,875
It just isn't fair.

316
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,750
I mean why does that creepy
thing always come after me?

317
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,625
[ELDER 201A] It's a long,
awkward, story that I won't

318
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,375
get into now, but back in
the day, that mole actually

319
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,250
used to be a villager's pet.

320
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,791
[ALL]
Someone's pet?

321
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,375
[ELDER 201A] It was a small,
adorable creature back then,

322
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,083
and it caused no trouble.

323
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,291
But its owner suddenly
had to move away,

324
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,041
and whatever his reasons
were, that selfish fool

325
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,541
left the mole behind,
screwing us all.

326
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:40,958
Thinking he had
been abandoned,

327
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:44,583
the little guy grew
angry and bitter.

328
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,666
It turned savage and wild,

329
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,458
eventually growing
to a monstrous size.

330
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:54,291
And now the beast has returned
to take revenge on mankind.

331
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,291
I'd have a chip on
my shoulder too.

332
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,125
Well I'd feel more
sympathetic if it'd chase

333
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,541
someone else for once.

334
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,208
Aw C'mon Lucy,
now that you know why

335
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,416
it's acting like this,
how mad can you really be?

336
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,333
I can see why it's upset,
but why does it single out Lucy?

337
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,333
This may be the mole's
breeding season.

338
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,041
It's searching for love.

339
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,541
Since it can find no
females of its own kind,

340
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,416
it's decided to
make do with her.

341
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,333
So you're sayin' that the mole
wants to marry Lucy, right?

342
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,166
That is beyond ridiculous!

343
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,208
I too am a comely young woman.

344
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:25,375
So why doesn't the
mole chase me around?

345
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,125
Considering that you're
wearing all that armor.

346
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,208
It could be that the mole is
uncertain as to your gender.

347
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,708
[WENDY] Hey wait. I'm a young
girl that isn't wearing armor,

348
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,291
so how come it doesn't like me?

349
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,083
[ELDER 201A] Er. It seems that
this mole is especially fond

350
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:41,875
of well-endowed women.
And, you know...

351
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,916
Aw, man!

352
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,666
In light of this information,

353
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,583
our next course of
action seems clear.

354
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,458
Yup! We've got ourselves
a big ol' piece of mole bait!

Uh. What do you
mean "mole bait"?

we can save you before

361
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,583

I know it's really muddy,

However. Your safety

use a sword? Whatever.

Well, now that we've

I guess we should figure out
what we should do with it.

I know it caused

its feelings were hurt.

him into letting go of his

00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:05,541
[MAVIS] Fairy Tail accepts
this world for all its flaws.

469
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,083
[ZEREF] This shall be my
gift to no one, Mavis.

470
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:11,125
A brand new world,
purified and sweet.

471
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:14,333
I assume that there
will be fighting?

472
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:18,083
Not quite. More like a
one-sided annihilation.

473
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,875
Not a man, woman,
or child will be spared.

474
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:24,500
I swear that Fairy Tail
will stop you.

475
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:27,333
They will wipe your
stain from this land.

476
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,166
[ZEREF]
Natsu...

477
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,750
The time of our next
meeting draws near.

478
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,166
[HAPPY] Natsu! Frosch
is in trouble, c'mon!

479
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,000
[NATSU] Frosch? You mean that
froggy cat from Sabertooth?

480
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,333
[HAPPY]
Yeah that one!

481
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,000
Apparently the poor
little thing got lost again!

482
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:22,250
[NATSU]
That's it?

483
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:23,833
Dude, that doesn't sound
like a big deal at all!

484
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:26,500
[HAPPY] I guess you don't know
how amazing Frosch is, Natsu.

485
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:27,958
[NATSU]
Amazing like how?

486
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:29,916
[HAPPY] Frosch has never
ever made it home alone.

487
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,041
So Frosch is the
Champion of Getting Lost!

488
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:35,083
[NATSU] Well If this happens
all the time, who cares?

489
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:37,208
[NATSU, HAPPY]
Next Time: Welcome Back, Frosch!

490
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:39,666
[NATSU] Alright bud, guess we'd
better hunt down that cat!

491
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,000
[HAPPY]
Aye, Sir!
