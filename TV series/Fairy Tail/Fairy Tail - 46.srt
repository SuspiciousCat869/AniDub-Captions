1
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,375
- HEY, GUYS.  READY FOR
SOME MORE "FAIRY TAIL"?

2
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,375
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING,

3
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,958
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE ROOM,

4
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,416
AND DON'T SIT TOO CLOSE
TO THE TV.

5
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:30,041
- Porlyusica:
PREVIOUSLY ON "FAIRY TAIL."

6
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:32,458
- Levy: THANKS TO A LITTLE
HELP FROM YOURS TRULY,

7
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,375
NATSU WAS ABLE TO
JOIN THE BATTLE ROYALE

8
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,208
JUST AS THE THUNDER LEGION
WENT DOWN.

9
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,666
NOW WE GOTTA FIND A WAY
TO STOP THE THUNDER PALACE

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,000
AND GET MASTER
BACK ON HIS FEET.

11
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,125
- ( theme music playing )

12
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,416
- ( singing in Japanese )

13
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,333
- ( gasps )
LUCY, LOOK.

14
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,250
- "FRIED VERSUS MIRAJANE.

15
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,833
BOTH WIZARDS FORFEIT."

16
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,166
- THAT LIGHT WE SAW.

17
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,250
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
FROM THEIR FIGHT.

18
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,458
- THE SHE-DEVIL.
I WANTED TO SEE HER DO IT,

19
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,458
BUT I'M KIND OF
GLAD I DIDN'T. 

20
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:34,333
- IF FRIED'S OUT, THAT MEANS
THE THUNDER LEGION'S TOAST. 

21
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,083
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
BUT...

22
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,666
- AYE.

23
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,583
- THE THUNDER PALACE
IS STILL LOOMING OVER US

24
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:43,125
JUST WAITING TO BLAST
THE WHOLE TOWN TO PIECES.

25
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,708
HOW ARE WE
GONNA TAKE IT DOWN?

26
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,500
- Happy:
I DON'T KNOW.

27
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,083
THEY'VE GOT THAT BODY LINK
MAGIC PROTECTING THEM.

28
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,291
IF WE TRY TO ATTACK THEM,

29
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,750
WE'LL JUST END UP
GETTING HURT INSTEAD.

30
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,916
- Lucy: YEAH.

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,791
AND THOSE THINGS COULD 
EXPLODE ANY MINUTE NOW.

32
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:59,958
WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE ENOUGH
TIME TO EVACUATE EVERYBODY.

33
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,541
( gasps )
- OH NO, LUCY!  ARE YOU OKAY?

34
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,958
- YEAH.  I THINK SO.

35
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,708
- YOU HAVEN'T RECOVERED
ALL OF YOUR MAGIC ENERGY YET.

36
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,208
YOU SHOULDN'T PUSH YOURSELF.

37
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:10,958
- YEAH, I KNOW.
BUT I--

38
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,958
I CAN'T JUST SIT HERE.
I HAVE TO GO HELP THE OTHERS.

39
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,125
- BUT HOW?

40
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,708
- Lucy: NATSU, ERZA...

41
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,083
WHERE ARE YOU GUYS?

42
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,541
- ( Happy speaking )

43
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,625
- ( Natsu shouts )

44
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,916
WHERE ARE YOU HIDING,
LAXUS?!

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,916
COME OUT AND FACE ME.

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
- LAXUS, SHOW YOURSELF NOW.

47
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,166
- Levy: THAT THUNDER PALACE
SPELL IS STRONG ENOUGH

48
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,000
TO TAKE OUT THE WHOLE TOWN.

49
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,583
LAXUS IS GONNA
ACTIVATE IT SOON.

50
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:46,041
IN JUST TEN MINUTES.
I'M SCARED.

51
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,000
BUT WE'LL BE ABLE
TO STOP HIM.

52
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,166
AFTER ALL, WE'VE STILL
GOT NATSU AND ERZA.

53
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,000
AND NOW GAJEEL'S
ON OUR SIDE.

54
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:55,000
OH YEAH!
AND I CAN'T FORGET MYSTOGAN.

55
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,958
UH, EVEN THOUGH
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM.

56
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,708
I WONDER WHO THAT COULD BE.

57
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:11,000
- WHERE CAN I FIND
THE OLD FOOL?

58
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,041
- UH, MISS PORLYUSICA?

59
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,708
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

60
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,708
- I ASKED YOU
WHERE HE IS. 

61
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,541
- RIGHT.
HE'S IN THE INFIRMARY, MA'AM.

62
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,500
- ( sighs )

63
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,291
- UM, MAYBE HE
SHOULDN'T BE BOTHERED.

64
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,791
HE'S NOT FEELING WELL.

65
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,833
- WHY DO YOU THINK I'M HERE?

66
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,416
- HOLD ON.
YOU CAME ALL THIS WAY

67
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,833
JUST SO YOU COULD
TREAT THE MASTER?

68
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,791
THAT'S SO NICE OF YOU.

69
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,500
( sighs )

70
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,625
- GO AND FETCH LAXUS.
- WHY?

71
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,250
- WHAT HE'S DOING
IS SHAMEFUL.

72
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:00,083
ESPECIALLY WITH
THE OLD MAN ON HIS DEATHBED.

73
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,083
- ( gasps )
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

74
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,625
IS HE REALLY THAT SICK?

75
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,333
- PLEASE.

76
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,250
JUST DO AS I SAY, CHILD.

77
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,916
IT CANNOT WAIT.

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,375
THERE'S NOT MUCH TIME.

79
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,750
- ( gasps )

80
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,833
- Makarov: OH, HI, LAXUS.

81
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,416
NOW WHY WOULD I DO THAT
WHEN I PROMISED

82
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,666
I'D WATCH IT
WITH YOU THIS YEAR?

83
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,125
THERE, NOW YOU CAN SEE, RIGHT?

84
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:35,708
THE WIZARDS FROM FAIRY TAIL
ARE PRETTY COOL, HUH?

85
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,541
- WHY DO I HAVE TO
START THINKING ABOUT

86
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,500
THIS STUPID CRAP
RIGHT NOW?

87
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,208
- SO TELL ME, BOY,

88
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:48,708
WHY AREN'T YOU PARTICIPATING
IN THE FANTASIA PARADE WITH US?

89
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,291
- WHY SHOULD I?

90
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,125
NOBODY'LL CARE IF
I'M THERE OR NOT,

91
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,458
RIGHT?
EVER SINCE I WAS LITTLE

92
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,708
I'VE ALWAYS JUST BEEN
KNOWN AS YOUR GRANDSON.

93
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,416
IT'S LIKE I NEVER GOT
TO BE MY OWN PERSON. 

94
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,958
NO ONE CALLS ME LAXUS.

95
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,625
I'M MAKAROV'S GRANDSON.

96
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,708
I DON'T GET CREDIT
FOR ANYTHING.

97
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,291
IT'S JUST EXPECTED OF ME 'CAUSE
MY GRANDPA'S THE GUILD MASTER. 

98
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,125
- AH, SO THAT'S WHAT THIS IS.

99
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,166
YOU'RE FEELING OVERLOOKED.

100
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,916
DO YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE 
MOST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,750
FEEL LIKE THEY GET
THE CREDIT THEY DESERVE?

102
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,500
- IT WAS BAD ENOUGH
JUST LIVING IN YOUR SHADOW.

103
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,833
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO GO
AND MAKE THINGS WORSE?

104
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,333
- I'M SORRY.
- YOU'RE SORRY?!

105
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,750
DON'T YOU HAVE A HEART,
OLD MAN?

106
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,750
- ( sighs )

107
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,875
- YOU WENT TOO FAR.

108
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,333
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO KICK
MY DAD OUT OF FAIRY TAIL.

109
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:36,291
- ( sighs )

110
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,166
- SO WHY DID YOU DO IT?

111
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,125
- BECAUSE IVAN--

112
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:44,166
WHAT YOUR FATHER DID CAUSED
GREAT HARM TO FAIRY TAIL.

113
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,750
- OKAY.

114
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,750
SO MAYBE HE MADE
A FEW STUPID MISTAKES,

115
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,333
BUT WHO HASN'T?

116
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,500
HE'S STILL YOUR OWN
FLESH AND BLOOD, RIGHT?

117
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,041
HE'S STILL YOUR SON!

118
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,041
- FLESH AND BLOOD OR NOT,

119
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,875
ANY MEMBER WHO WOULD ENDANGER
THE LIVES OF HIS BRETHREN

120
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,833
MUST BE BANISHED
WITHOUT EXCEPTION.

121
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,916
THAT'S HOW OUR
PREDECESSORS HAVE PRESERVED

122
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,541
THIS GUILD OVER THE YEARS.

123
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,541
IT'S THE WAY FAIRY TAIL
HAS ALWAYS WORKED.

124
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,041
- THEN WHY DON'T YOU JUST
KICK ME OUT TOO, HUH?

125
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,958
- THAT WAY I CAN GO
JOIN HIS NEW GUILD,

126
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,375
SO ME AND MY DAD
CAN WORK TOGETHER.

127
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,708
AND WE'LL BOTH
TAKE YOU DOWN.

128
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,375
- HE'S GONE AND
ESTABLISHED A NEW GUILD?

129
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,625
- WHERE IS HE?
IF YOU KNOW WHERE IVAN IS,

130
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,541
YOU MUST TELL ME AT ONCE!

131
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,291
- YEAH, RIGHT.
LIKE YOU GIVE A CRAP.

132
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,791
YOU CAN GO TRY
TO FIND HIM YOURSELF.

133
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,708
- PLEASE.
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME, LAXUS.

134
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,125
LISTEN, IVAN LEFT
WITH INFORMATION 

135
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,375
THAT COULD BE
DETRIMENTAL TO FAIRY TAIL.

136
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,250
I HAVE TO FIND HIM.

137
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,916
IT'S LIFE OR DEATH.

138
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,375
THE SAFETY OF
THE GUILD IS AT STAKE.

139
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,500
- GUESS YOU SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT

140
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:41,833
BEFORE YOU
KICKED HIM OUT.

141
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,416
- TELL ME WHERE HE IS!

142
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,833
- SOME DAY,
I'M GONNA SURPASS YOU.

143
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,833
BUT NOT FOR DAD'S SAKE.

144
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,208
IT'LL BE FOR MY OWN.

145
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:53,166
AND THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO
LIVE UNDER MY SHADOW.

146
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:00,416
( chuckles )
I KNEW THIS DAY WOULD COME.

147
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,916
THIS IS IT.  YOU CAN'T SAY 
I DIDN'T WARN YOU, OLD MAN.

148
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,333
ONLY SIX MINUTES UNTIL

149
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,250
THE THUNDER PALACE
IS ACTIVATED.

150
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,083
I GUESS THAT STUBBORN
OLD GEEZER'S

151
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:15,375
GONNA HANG ON 'TIL
THE VERY END. TYPICAL.

152
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,833
OH...

153
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,208
HEY, MYSTOGAN.

154
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,000
YOU ACTUALLY SHOWED UP.

155
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,916
( chuckles )

156
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,041
I'M SURPRISED
YOU'RE HERE. 

157
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,791
I DIDN'T THINK THIS GAME
WOULD BE OF ANY INTEREST TO YOU.

158
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:42,208
- IF YOU BRING DOWN
THE THUNDER PALACE RIGHT NOW,

159
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,291
WE MAY BE ABLE
TO CONVINCE THE CITIZENS

160
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,958
THAT IT WAS PART OF
THE FESTIVAL.

161
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,291
- IS THAT REALLY
WHY YOU CAME BACK?

162
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,625
GIMME A BREAK. YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR A PIECE OF THE ACTION.

163
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,375
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO THE
STRONGEST WIZARD

164
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,458
IN FAIRY TAIL IS.

165
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,958
YOU OR ME?

166
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,916
- DON'T BE SO QUICK
TO RULE OUT ERZA.

167
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,500
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

168
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,333
SURE THE GIRL'S GOT SPUNK,

169
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,750
BUT SHE'S STILL WEAK.

170
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,916
- ( chuckles )
YOU THINK SHE'S WEAK?

171
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
YOU'RE EITHER BLIND OR MORE
IGNORANT THAN I THOUGHT.

172
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,500
- NOTHING AGAINST HER,
BUT I THINK WE CAN BOTH AGREE

173
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,333
THAT WE'RE STRONGER.

174
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:17,500
IT'S CLEAR ONE OF US
IS FAIRY TAIL'S TOP WIZARD.

175
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,708
THE QUESTION IS,
WHO DESERVES THE TITLE?

176
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,916
- IF YOU SEE THE WORLD
IN SUCH SIMPLE TERMS, 

177
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,208
PERHAPS YOU ARE BLIND.

178
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,333
- I'M SICK OF
TALKING ABOUT IT.

179
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,250
LET'S SETTLE THIS
HERE AND NOW.

180
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,333
MYSTOGAN.
( chuckles )

181
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,625
OR SHOULD I SAY--

182
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,833
- ( gasps )
IT'S THE CHURCH.

183
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,875
- THAT CAME FROM 
KARDIA CATHEDRAL.

184
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:56,791
- TELL ME,
HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

185
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,458
- OOPS, DID I STRIKE A NERVE?

186
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:02,625
IT'S A RARE TREAT TO SEE YOU
LOSE YOUR COOL LIKE THAT.

187
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,375
I'VE GOT A DEAL FOR YOU.

188
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:08,041
BEAT ME, AND I SWEAR
I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING I KNOW.

189
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:13,041
- YOU'RE GOING TO REGRET
THAT STATEMENT, LAXUS.

190
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:16,041
YOU'RE ABOUT TO WITNESS 
MAGIC THE LIKES OF WHICH

191
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,791
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

192
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,625
- OH, I'M SO SCARED.

193
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,125
GO ON AND SHOW ME WHAT
YOU'VE GOT, YOU FREAK.

194
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,666
I'M DYING TO SEE
HOW MUCH STRONGER I AM.

195
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,458
- SKYSCRAPER.

196
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,041
- ( grunts )

197
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,375
AAH!

198
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,875
WHAT HAPPENED?

199
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,416
IMPOSSIBLE.

200
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,875
THE ENTIRE CHURCH?

201
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,250
( screams )

202
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,375
( gasps )

203
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,750
WHAT KIND OF MAGIC IS THIS?!

204
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,750
( whimpers )

205
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,125
- ( roars )

206
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,166
- ( screams )

207
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,083
( laughing )

208
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,625
NOW THAT'S FUNNY!

209
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:35,291
DID YOU SERIOUSLY THINK
YOU'D BE ABLE TO DEFEAT ME

210
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,125
USING SOME KIND OF
STUPID ILLUSION?

211
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,875
- IMPRESSIVE.

212
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,250
BUT IT SEEMS YOU'RE STILL
A BIT SLOW ON THE UPTAKE.

213
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,041
- WHAT?

214
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,250
- SLEEP.

215
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,750
FIVE LAYER MAGIC CIRCLE
SACRED SONG.

216
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,166
- YOU THINK I'M
THE SLOW ONE, HUH?

217
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,125
- NO.

218
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,625
- ( laughs )

219
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,500
- ( groans )

220
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,666
- ( chuckles )

221
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,666
- HE SLIPPED THROUGH.
- ( laughs )

222
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:22,791
- ( grunts )

223
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,791
- ( chuckles )
NOW THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

224
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,291
- Both:
SO HERE YOU ARE.

225
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,500
- ERZA.
- HEY, YOU MADE IT OUT OF THERE.

226
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,125
- WAIT, WHO THE HECK
IS THAT GUY?

227
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,375
- THAT'S MYSTOGAN.

228
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,333
- YOU'RE WIDE OPEN.

229
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,708
( grunts )

230
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,083
- ( both gasp )

231
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,708
- ( gasps )
JELLAL?

232
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:06,958
- WHAT THE--?

233
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,750
- BUT HOW?

234
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,208
YOU-- YOU'RE STILL ALIVE?

235
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,958
- OH, SO YOU KNOW THIS GUY?

236
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,583
- WAIT.
I DON'T GET IT.

237
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,750
SO MYSTOGAN...

238
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,541
IS REALLY JELLAL?

239
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,083
- JELLAL, I--

240
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,666
- ERZA...

241
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,250
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

242
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,791
I WAS AFRAID
YOU'D SEE THIS.

243
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,833
- ( gasps )

244
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,750
- I'M NOT YOUR FRIEND JELLAL.

245
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:52,541
I DO KNOW OF HIM,
BUT I'M NOT HIM. 

246
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,791
I'M SORRY.

247
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,625
I MUST BE GOING.

248
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,791
- HEY, WAIT UP!

249
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,208
WELL, THAT MADE
MY BRAIN HURT. 

250
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,875
I CAN'T THINK
ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.

251
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,458
ALL RIGHT, MAN.
IT'S YOU AGAINST ME.

252
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:12,791
I'M GONNA TAKE CARE
OF THIS CLOWN.

253
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:13,958
THAT COOL WITH YOU?

254
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,125
- ( gasps )

255
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,458
- WAKE UP!

256
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,875
- ( screams )

257
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,375
- THAT'S QUITE A FACE
YOU'RE MAKING THERE, GIRLY.

258
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,791
UGLY.

259
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:25,791
( grunts )

260
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,083
- ( screams )

261
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,458
- THAT'S ENOUGH!

262
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,833
I TOLD YOU,
YOU'RE MINE, YOU JERK.

263
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,041
LET'S GO.

264
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,583
- HEY, DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE YOU.

265
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,583
- ( gasps )

266
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,458
OH, YOU'RE ABOUT TO
NOTICE ME, PAL.

267
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,416
- ( chuckles )

268
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,166
- I'LL BURN YOU
TO A CRISP!

269
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,625
AAH!

270
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,583
- NATSU...

271
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,625
- ( screams )

272
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,666
- DIDN'T ANYBODY
EVER TELL YOU?

273
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,875
YOU GOTTA THINK
BEFORE YOU ACT, KID.

274
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,333
- ( shouts )

275
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,250
- NOW GET LOST, YOU RUNT!

276
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,166
- ( grunts )

277
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,500
- ( grunts )

278
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,125
- FIRE DRAGON TALON!

279
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,166
- ( grunts )

280
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,375
- BE CAREFUL!

281
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:14,708
- I'M OKAY.

282
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,125
YOU DON'T GOT TO
WORRY ABOUT ME. 

283
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,875
( grunts )

284
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,041
- WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING, YOU LITTLE PUNK?

285
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,875
- ( grunting )

286
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,750
I'M STAYING HERE.

287
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,083
THIS SPOT IS JUST
PERFECT FOR ME.

288
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,958
( grunting )

289
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,458
- ( chuckles )

290
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:37,666
- ( shouts )
- ( laughs )

291
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,041
HERE IT COMES!

292
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,875
( grunts )

293
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,375
( grunts )

294
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,708
NOT NICE.

295
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,291
- Erza:
I NEED TO GET JELLAL--

296
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,000
I MEAN, MYSTOGAN,
OUT OF MY HEAD.

297
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,750
I HAVE TO STAY FOCUSED.

298
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,750
LAXUS IS MY TARGET.

299
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,083
REQUIP!

300
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,291
( shouts )

301
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,250
- CAREFUL, ERZA!
- ALL RIGHT, LAXUS.

302
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,041
WHAT HAVE YOU PUT IN THE SKY?
TELL ME NOW.

303
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,666
- WHAT?  YOU HAVEN'T HEARD?

304
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,583
THAT WOULD BE MY
THUNDER PALACE. 

305
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,500
- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY
DESPICABLE.

306
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:17,333
TO THINK THAT YOU WOULD
ATTACK YOUR HOMETOWN.

307
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,166
- ( laughs )

308
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,500
HONESTLY, IT BREAKS MY HEART.

309
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,500
BUT THAT'S JUST THE WAY
THE GAME IS PLAYED, DOLLFACE.

310
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,083
( chuckles )

311
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,833
- DAMN YOU!

312
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,083
- THERE'S ONLY
TWO MINUTES TO GO.

313
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,916
- GO.
DESTROY THEM NOW, NATSU.

314
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,333
- I CAN'T, OKAY!

315
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,958
IF I ATTACK THOSE THINGS,

316
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,541
I KNOW THEY'RE JUST
GONNA ZAP ME RIGHT BACK.

317
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,375
- SERIOUSLY?
YOU'RE USING BODY LINK MAGIC

318
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,708
TO PROTECT THEM?

319
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,875
- YEAH.
AND THEY'RE GONNA STAY UP THERE

320
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,791
UNTIL I GIVE
THE ORDER TO BLOW.

321
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:48,875
- YOU COWARD!

322
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,208
- IT'S A SHAME YOU WON'T
BE AROUND TO SEE IT.

323
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,916
- REQUIP!

324
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,708
- HA!  LIGHTNING EMPRESS ARMOR.

325
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,958
NICE TRY, BUT IT'S NOT GONNA
PROTECT YOU FROM MY ATTACK.

326
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,083
( grunts )

327
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,125
- NOW THAT WE'RE
USING THE SAME MAGIC,

328
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,000
IT'S A FAIR FIGHT!

329
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,208
( grunts )

330
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:17,583
- ( laughs )

331
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,875
LET'S SEE IF YOUR ARMOR
CAN HANDLE THIS.

332
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,000
STILL STANDING, HUH?

333
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,666
- WHEN TWO WIZARDS
DO BATTLE

334
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,416
USING THE SAME
TYPE OF MAGIC,

335
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,666
MANY DIFFERENT FACTORS
DETERMINE THE VICTOR. 

336
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,000
- THEIR LEVEL OF MAGIC ENERGY,
TECHNIQUE, AND EXPERIENCE.

337
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,166
RIGHT?

338
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,666
- ONE MORE.

339
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,166
THEIR HEART.

340
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,833
I KNOW THE MASTER
TAUGHT YOU THAT, LAXUS.

341
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,500
- YEAH, HE MENTIONED IT.

342
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,625
BUT HE ALSO TAUGHT ME
POWER TRUMPS EVERYTHING ELSE.

343
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,833
- YOU COULDN'T BE MORE WRONG.

344
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:52,750
- ERZA, WOULD YOU JUST
LEAVE IT ALONE, ALREADY?

345
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,541
I TOLD YOU THAT I WAS
GONNA BE THE ONE TO FIGHT HIM.

346
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,666
- THEN I'LL HAVE TO 
PUT MY FAITH IN YOU.

347
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,875
- HEY!
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

348
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,708
- HMM?

349
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:12,041
- HOLD ON.  YOU'RE NOT GONNA
TRY TO TAKE THAT THING DOWN?

350
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,875
- ( laughs )

351
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,541
I'D LIKE TO 
SEE YOU TRY.

352
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,875
ATTACKING EVEN ONE OF
THOSE LACRIMAE CAN BE DEADLY.

353
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,958
AND WHO KNOWS HOW MANY
OF THEM ARE FLOATING

354
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,875
ABOVE TOWN RIGHT NOW.

355
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,000
BESIDES, YOU'RE OUT OF TIME.

356
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,208
- I'LL JUST DESTROY THEM
ALL AT ONCE.

357
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,041
- IS THAT SO?

358
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:32,166
YOU MUST HAVE SOME KIND OF
MAJOR DEATH WISH THEN.

359
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,041
- NO.

360
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,833
BUT IF THAT'S 
WHAT IT TAKES.

361
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,875
I'M LEAVING HIM
IN YOUR HANDS, 

362
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,083
SO DON'T LET ME DOWN.

363
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,500
- COME BACK!

364
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,333
YOU'RE BREAKING 
THE RULES, ERZA!

365
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,916
- I'M PUTTING MY FAITH
IN YOU TOO, YOU HEAR? 

366
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,375
WHETHER YOU CAN DESTROY
THOSE THINGS OR NOT,

367
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,875
YOU BETTER
MAKE IT BACK ALIVE!

368
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,791
- Erza: DON'T WORRY.

369
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,583
I PROMISE THAT I WON'T
THROW AWAY THE LIFE

370
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,750
YOU FOUGHT SO HARD TO SAVE.

371
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,291
- NO.

372
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,208
- FIRE DRAGON ROAR!

373
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,500
ALL RIGHT, JERK.

374
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,333
PREPARE YOURSELF
FOR A BEAT DOWN.

375
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:20,041
- YOU MOUTHY LITTLE BRAT.

376
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:26,125
- I CALL UPON THE POWER
THAT LIES WITHIN MY SWORDS.

377
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,958
GIVE ME STRENGTH.

378
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,958
HELP ME PROTECT
MY DEAR CITY.

379
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,791
MY COMRADES IN FAIRY TAIL,

380
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,291
PLEASE LEND ME
YOUR STRENGTH AS WELL.

381
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:39,541
- ( gasps ) HEY, I THINK I JUST
HEARD ERZA SAY SOMETHING TO ME.

382
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,541
- MM-HMM.  I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT I HEARD IT TOO.

383
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:43,916
- SHE ASKED US TO 
LEND HER STRENGTH.

384
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,583
- WEIRD, HUH?

385
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:49,958
- IF ERZA'S ASKING FOR HELP,
IT MUST BE SERIOUS.

386
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,833
WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING,
BUT WHAT?

387
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,166
I KNOW.

388
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,541
IF I CAN FIND A WAY
FOR EVERYBODY TO HEAR HER,

389
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:02,500
THEN WE CAN BAND TOGETHER
TO LEND HER A HAND.

390
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,000
BUT I'M GONNA NEED
WARREN'S TELEPATHY

391
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,541
TO PULL THAT OFF.

392
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,125
- FIRE DRAGON BRILLIANT FLAME!

393
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,000
- DON'T YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO OUR GUILD, NATSU?

394
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,166
- WHAT?
- THANKS TO THE OLD GEEZER,

395
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,208
FAIRY TAIL'S NOTHING
BUT A JOKE NOW.

396
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,833
- ( grunting )

397
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,333
- ALL I'M TRYING TO DO
IS MAKE THINGS RIGHT! 

398
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,000
WHEN I BECOME MASTER,

399
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,125
OUR NAME WILL STRIKE
FEAR INTO PEOPLE'S HEARTS!

400
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,500
- AAH!

401
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,458
- ( chuckles )

402
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,250
- ( groans )

403
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,208
- WHERE'D EVERYONE GO?

404
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,041
- THEY'VE GOT TO
BE HERE SOMEWHERE.

405
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,291
WE JUST HAVE TO 
KEEP ON LOOKING.

406
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:56,125
- HEY, WARREN ROCKO!
I COULD USE YOUR HELP RIGHT NOW.

407
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,041
- THERE'S ONLY ONE MINUTE,
THIRTY SECONDS

408
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,166
UNTIL THE THUNDER PALACE
IS ACTIVATED.

409
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,375
WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU
WAITING FOR, OLD MAN?

410
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,208
ARE YOU REALLY GONNA
STAND BACK AND WATCH

411
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,791
ALL THOSE PEOPLE DIE?

412
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,458
- ( laughs )

413
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,166
I WOULDN'T WORRY
IF I WERE YOU.

414
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,041
IT'S OVER.

415
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,458
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO
IT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN.

416
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:19,791
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

417
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,291
- YOU CAN BLOW UP THE TOWN,

418
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,208
BUT YOU'RE STILL NOT
GETTING FAIRY TAIL. 

419
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,541
YOU'RE JUST UPSET THAT
YOU CAN'T BACK OUT OF IT NOW.

420
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,583
THE TOWN'LL BE FINE.

421
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,958
ERZA'S TAKING YOUR SPELL DOWN.

422
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,291
IT'S NOT SO EASY
STICKING TO YOUR GUNS,

423
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,166
IS IT, LAXUS?

424
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,958
- SHUT UP!
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU KNOW?!

425
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,958
- ( breathing heavily )

426
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,375
( gasps )

427
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:55,750
( straining )

428
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,625
ONE HUNDRED!

429
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:07,083
( grunts )

430
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,708
( panting )

431
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,083
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

432
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,750
AAH!

433
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:29,583
- ( panting )

434
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,083
- I'M FIRED UP NOW!

435
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,958
- ( shouts )

436
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:45,083
- ( theme music playing )

437
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

438
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,250
- HEY, NATSU.
THERE'S A RUMOR GOING AROUND

439
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,833
THAT ANOTHER DRAGON SLAYER'S
GONNA BE ADDED TO THE MIX.

440
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,750
- NO WAY! BUT I THOUGHT
ME AND OLD METAL FACE

441
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,500
WERE THE ONLY ONES
AROUND HERE.

442
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:23,833
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY ELSE 
THREATENING MY STAR POWER.

443
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:25,416
- YEAH, RIGHT.
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT, BUDDY.

444
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,083
- HEY NOW,
YOU BETTER WATCH YOUR MOUTH.

445
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,750
I GOT PLENTY OF
FANS OUT THERE.

446
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:31,000
- UH-HUH.
I'M SURE YOUR FAN CLUB IS HUGE.

447
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:34,166
- ( Natsu and Happy speaking )

448
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,333
- Natsu: ALL RIGHT,
SO THERE'S ME AND GAJEEL.

449
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:36,750
WHO COULD
THE OTHER ONE BE?

450
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,583
- Happy: THIS HAS
GOT TO BE THE EPISODE

451
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:40,916
WHERE THEY FINALLY REVEAL
I'M THE FISH DRAGON SLAYER.

452
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,083
- DREAM ON, PAL.
