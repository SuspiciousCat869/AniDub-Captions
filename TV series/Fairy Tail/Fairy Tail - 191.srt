1
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:22,833
How could she have forgotten
that she closed the gate?

2
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:24,625
I don't care about your gate!

3
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,875
I would never shut it,
but you still--

4
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,166
How could you?

5
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,500
[FUTURE ROGUE] You say
that now, but you will.

6
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:33,041
You've done it before
and I know you'll do it again.

7
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,125
[LUCY] I'm not gonna
shut the damn gate!

8
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:38,041
Why do you keep
accusing me? Cut it out!

9
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,083
I haven't done anything to you!

10
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,666
The gate will be closed.

11
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,750
There's no way to prevent it.

12
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,916
[FUTURE ROGUE]
Not while you're still alive.

13
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:50,500
You heard my future self say
that she did no such thing!

14
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,250
Tell me, why would I
lie to myself?

15
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,333
[FUTURE ROGUE]
Her delusions are irrelevant!

16
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:59,750
Every choice you think you have
has been decided by fate!

17
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:03,791
Then I'm gonna turn fate
into a pile of ashes!

18
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:09,666
[NATSU] I ain't lettin'
anybody steal Lucy's future.

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,166
Not while I'm alive!

20
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,541
[FUTURE LUCY]
Please. Protect the future.

21
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:17,125
I will, I promise!

22
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:52,000
[grunts]

23
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,375
[grunts]

24
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:58,083
Lucy! Get out
of here right now!

25
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,625
I can't!

26
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,875
Natsu's got this. Let's go!

27
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,083
[LUCY gasps]

28
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,708
[HAPPY] It might be
a good idea to move away

29
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,375
from the psycho murderer!

30
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,791
[LUCY] Yeah, sure.

31
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,791
You're not going anywhere!

32
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,375
[NATSU yells]

33
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,250
[groans]

34
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,000
Natsu Dragneel!

35
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,458
[FUTURE ROGUE] Uh!

36
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,875
[sobs softly]

37
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:34,000
[panting]

38
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,583
[FUTURE ROGUE] I never once
doubted you'd try to stop me.

39
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,083
Huh?

40
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,791
[FUTURE ROGUE] Oh well.
It doesn't really matter

41
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,333
because your fate
is already sealed.

42
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,291
[FUTURE ROGUE] Even if
you manage to defeat me,

43
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,666
the dragons
will still kill you!

44
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,875
Bastard! I didn't
peg you for a butcher.

45
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,666
[FUTURE ROGUE]
Time changes a person.

46
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:58,375
Unfortunately for you,
time is limited!

47
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:07,791
[NATSU grunting]

48
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,500
Your mistake was taking
something precious from me

49
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,958
right before my eyes.

50
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,416
[FUTURE ROGUE] Uh?

51
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,791
[NATSU] I don't like
the way you do things.

52
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,375
[FUTURE ROGUE scoffs]

53
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:24,083
[NATSU] I promised!
I'm gonna protect the future.

54
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,541
And I'll do it my way!

55
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,250
[HAPPY] Natsu versus Rogue!

56
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:42,291
[MIRAJANE] Yukino! Where
are you hiding? Come on out!

57
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,500
[YUKINO] I'm over here.

58
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:45,500
[gasps]

59
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:52,041
[footsteps]

60
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,416
What in the world
are you doing out here?

61
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,083
[YUKINO] I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to--

62
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,833
C'mon, let's go back.

63
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,291
[YUKINO] I can't.

64
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,500
[YUKINO] Stay away.
I'll bring you bad luck.

65
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,791
It's all I ever
seem to do these days.

66
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,541
Mm.

67
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,750
[YUKINO] It's true.
This always happens.

68
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:15,500
If you stay around me, I'm sure
I'll do the same to you.

69
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,416
[MIRAJANE] No one I know
blames their own bad luck

70
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,708
on other people.
I certainly don't.

71
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,458
[YUKINO] But I...

72
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,166
[MIRAJANE] It's all right.

73
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,625
[YUKINO gasps]

74
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:35,291
Everyone has
a purpose in this life.

75
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,125
You do, too. You'll see.

76
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,125
[gasps]

77
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:55,000
[HISUI] In preparation for
the dragon's assault on Fiore,

78
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:58,541
we will begin the Eclipse
Cannon's firing sequence!

79
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,166
Unlock!

80
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:11,791
[DARTON] I can't believe it.
The gate is finally opening.

81
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,000
[ARCADIOS] Princess,
I shall see your will

82
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,958
through to the end.

83
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:25,041
Have there been any
updates from our lookouts?

84
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,083
[MALE SOLDIER 191A]
Western lookout reports

85
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,250
no dragons sighted.

86
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,500
[MALE SOLDIER 191B] Nothing to
the east either, Your Highness!

87
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,666
[HISUI]
What about the evacuation?

88
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,125
[MALE SOLDIER 191C] Troops are
sending them away as we speak!

89
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,125
[commotion]

90
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,208
[MALE SOLDIER 191D] Let's move!

91
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,666
We need everyone
out of town, quickly!

92
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,333
[MALE SOLDIER 191E]
Hurry! This is an emergency!

93
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,708
[MALE CITIZEN 191A] It's the
middle of the night! What gives?

94
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,208
[MALE CITIZEN 191B]
Explain yourselves!

95
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,666
[MALE CITIZEN 191C]
Yeah, what he said!

96
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,666
This is really cutting into
my drinking time, y'know!

97
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:04,333
I would like to wipe them out
in one shot, if possible.

98
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,875
[HISUI] If we miss, it'll be
years before we're able

99
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,750
to gather this much
magic power again.

100
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:12,583
[CARLA grunts]

101
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,541
[WENDY grunts]

[HAPPY and PANTHERLILY grunt]

103
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,416
[LUCY grunts]

104
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,291
[CARLA] Looks like
we got here just in time.

105
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,208
[WENDY] They're about
to open the gate!

106
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,250
Loke's not with us!

107
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,916
If he were,
Lucy's magic would get

108
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,875
sucked into the Eclipse.

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,541
That Rogue. What he said
has really been bothering me.

110
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,083
[FUTURE ROGUE]
Seven years in my past,

111
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:37,000
someone prevented
Eclipse Two from activating.

112
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,083
Because of that
one person's actions,

113
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,000
the gate remained shut.

114
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,291
And humanity was left
defenseless against

115
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:46,500
ten thousand raging dragons.

116
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:50,166
This person let ninety
percent of humanity die.

117
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,833
[ARCADIOS] You have
no reason to hide anymore.

118
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:55,916
[HISUI and DARTON] Huh?

119
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,416
Please, come out.

120
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,000
[HAPPY] Hm!

121
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:03,041
Just so you know, we weren't
doing anything wrong over here!

122
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:06,458
[CARLA] Why is Arcadios suddenly
side by side with the Minister?

123
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:09,208
The situation has
changed considerably!

124
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,625
You're from Fairy Tail.

125
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,500
[HISUI] I'm very sorry
for how you've been treated.

126
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,833
But, I'm afraid this
state of emergency means

127
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,291
an official apology
will have to wait for now.

128
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,958
See, she's not really mean!

129
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,166
Yes, I know.

130
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,625
Also, I congratulate
your guild on winning

131
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,375
the Grand Magic Games.

132
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:30,666
Aw, yeah!

133
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,666
I knew the others
wouldn't let us down!

134
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,708
Outstanding!

135
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,291
[distant clang]

136
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,750
[WENDY, CARLA, and HAPPY gasp]

137
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,083
Why are you opening
the gate right now?

138
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,625
There's no need,
the dragons aren't here yet.

139
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,000
[gasps] She knows about
the dragons, too?

140
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:48,958
Yes. They've all been
informed of the situation.

141
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:52,416
Speaking of,
where is the future you?

142
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,500
She was murdered,
by a man who also claims

143
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,083
to be from the future.

144
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,458
[BOTH gasp]

145
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,375
This guy's a serious nut-job!

146
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,333
He kept saying that I somehow
stop the gate from opening!

147
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:10,541
And that I doom everybody
to being dragon chow.

148
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,958
So this man
attempted to kill you?

149
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:16,000
And you'll swear there are
no merits to his claim?

150
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,916
Uh. Of course not,
Your Highness.

151
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,583
Like I said before,
I don't see any dragons yet.

152
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,958
Shouldn't we open the gate
once they're all in range?

153
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,125
[HISUI] Sadly, we can't wait.

154
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:32,458
I wish we could, but the
gate takes too long to open.

155
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,750
If we wait for them
to appear, we won't be ready.

156
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,250
It must be done.

157
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,333
And you're absolutely sure
it'll take them down

158
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,666
with one shot? All of them?

159
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,791
I'm not.
But I can promise...

160
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,708
[HISUI] if the worst
should come to pass,

161
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,875
the King will have
a plan of action.

162
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,708
[NARRATOR] We are now at
the very center of Crocus.

163
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,666
In the Lee-Een Crystal Plaza.

164
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,458
[NARRATOR] And this man
is Toma E. Fiore.

165
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:09,166
He is the almighty
ruler of this kingdom.

166
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,000
Thank you all for coming.

167
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,666
I hate to spoil the mood
after the splendid display

168
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,250
of wizardry
we've seen today, but...

169
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:20,041
I'm afraid, Fiore's heart
may soon be in the claws

170
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,833
of a dragon horde.

171
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:25,041
I thought Acnologia
was the only one.

172
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,416
Last time we
fought one of them

173
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,333
we lost seven
years of our lives.

174
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,541
That was a
special case but still.

175
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,083
We can't take on
an entire horde!

176
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,000
[TOMA] As we speak, a
large-scale counter-offensive

177
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,125
is underway at the castle.

178
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,250
[WIZARDS gasp]

179
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,166
[TOMA] The Eclipse Canon.

180
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,583
Eclipse Cannon?

181
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,000
[TOMA] We will use it to
wipe out the attacking dragons,

182
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,375
all ten thousand
of them, at once.

183
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,750
All of them at once?

184
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,708
I wonder how the hell
they expect to pull that off.

185
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,750
I can sense your concern.

186
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,750
Regrettably, given the sheer
number of the dragons' forces,

187
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,291
we expect that, at most,

188
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,166
a few hundred
will survive the attack.

189
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,708
Yes. I would assume so.

190
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,291
[TOMA] So I implore you,
guild wizards!

191
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,458
Please lend Fiore
your assistance

192
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,541
in dealing with this crisis!

193
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,875
You are the best hope
we have for slaying

194
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,708
any dragons the Eclipse cannot.

195
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:23,041
I beg of you. Don't let
this kingdom fall into ruin.

[TOMA] Thank you all.

The royal army has
captured some of our comrades

but we're going to
need their help.

They're safe.
I was informed they recently

212
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,125
joined Princess Hisui
at the gate.

213

All right! Time for
some more rampagin'!

214

We're up against dragons.

A perfect opportunity for
us Dragon Slayers to shine.

can't beat you!

go along with it.

have to fight.

I guess we'll show them
our "Sexy Power," no?

That all those wizards
could work together?

No, the Eclipse! The mere
existence of that gate

It wasn't easy, but it
was absolutely necessary.

319
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,875
In retrospect,
I should've done it sooner.

320
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,333
[NATSU] Amazing. I knew
you were all about darkness,

321
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:05,916
but I had no idea you cared
so little about life!

322
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,166
Now you know.

323
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,166
And you can take that
with you to the grave!

324
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,458
[groans]

325
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,041
[NATSU sighs]

326
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,500
[chuckles]

327
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,666
White Shadow Dragon.

328
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,208
[FUTURE ROGUE] Silk!

329
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,166
[ULTEAR] Flash Forward!

330
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,625
[MELDY] He got away!

331
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,666
[ULTEAR gasps]

332
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,916
C'mon, pull yourself
together! Natsu!

333
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,166
Meldy, emergency
medicine! Quickly!

334
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,625
Here!

335
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,958
[ULTEAR gasps] What is this?

336
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,416
Natsu!

337
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,791
Dammit! The shadow's
trying to pull him under!

338
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,250
[MALE SOLDIER 191A] Look!

339
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,833
[MALE SOLDIERS chatter]

340
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,291
[MALE SOLDIER 191B] The gate
is opening! Victory is ours!

341
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,666
[MALE SOLDIER 191C]
Yeah! Humanity is saved!

342
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,708
[HAPPY] Waaa...

343
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,791
It has so much magic,
my whiskers are tingling.

344
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,333
With that power,
they could wipe out

345
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,041
the dragons in one shot!

346
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,708
But is it wise to
keep it all in one place?

347
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,750
Wow. Look at that.

348
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:21,041
This means our future
has been saved, doesn't it?

349
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,500
Yeah.

350
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:30,083
Well, That's good news
for the other you.

351
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,166
She can rest in peace.

352
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,833
[giggles]

353
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,625
[WENDY] What are you doing?

354
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,166
Close it.

355
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:25,750
We can't let
the gate open. Stop it!

356
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,208
Why?

357
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:34,541
[LUCY]
We have to close the gate,

358
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:36,041
and we have to do it now.

359
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,666
[ALL gasp]

360
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,875
[HAPPY] Hey everyone!
Natsu's out today,

361
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:17,000
so I'm doing this solo-style!

362
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,416
"What are we gonna do, Happy?

363
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,375
Big scary dragons are
going to attack and kill us!"

364
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:23,541
Don't worry you're
sweet little head, Natsu!

365
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:25,791
Dealing with dragons
is my specialty!

366
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:28,416
"Wow, Happy! You're so
strong and reliable!"

367
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,291
Heh heh! Of course I am!

368
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:33,583
"Rah! I'm all fired up now!

369
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:36,750
Fire Dragon Roar!"

370
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:39,291
Next time: For Me, Too!

371
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:41,833
[giggles]
I could get used to this.
