1
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:19,958
- HEY, GUYS, READY FOR 
SOME MORE "FAIRY TAIL"?

2
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,666
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING,

3
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,333
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE ROOM.

4
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:26,375
AND DON'T SIT TOO CLOSE
TO THE TV.

5
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,625
- Happy:
PREVIOUSLY ON "FAIRY TAIL"...

6
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:30,375
- Natsu: WE'RE READY
FOR THE BIG TIME.  S-CLASS!

7
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,125
- Happy: NATSU AND I
WERE DRAGGED TO GALUNA ISLAND

8
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,833
BY A POWER-HUNGRY LUCY.

9
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,833
IT'S A SCARY PLACE
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN CURSED.

10
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:38,375
- Lucy: DON'T LIE!
THIS WAS ALL YOUR IDEA.

11
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,250
- Happy: ON OUR ADVENTURES,
WE CAME ACROSS A DOG,

12
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,541
HUGE EYEBROWS,
SOME CRAZY SIDEBURNS

13
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,333
AND A GIANT MONSTER
FROZEN IN ICE!

14
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:46,583
- Natsu:
PRETTY WEIRD SO FAR, HUH?

15
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:49,083
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

16
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,916
- Gray: DELIORA...

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,458
- YOU SURE THIS IS THE DEMON
YOUR MASTER SEALED AWAY?

18
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,708
- THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

19
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,708
- I WONDER WHY
IT WAS TRANSPORTED ALL THE WAY

20
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,708
FROM THE NORTHERN
CONTINENT TO GALUNA ISLAND.

21
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,916
- YOU DON'T THINK THIS DEMON
COULD HAVE SOMETHING TO DO

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,750
WITH THE ISLAND'S CURSE,
DO YOU?

23
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,666
- I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IF IT DID.

24
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,875
IT MAY BE ENCLOSED IN ICE,
BUT THAT THING'S STILL ALIVE.

25
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,125
- SWEET!

26
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,541
GIVE ME A GO AT IT!

27
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,166
I AIN'T AFRAID OF
NO STUPID DEMON! 

28
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,375
- YOU KNOW, BRUTE FORCE
ISN'T THE ONLY WAY

29
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,083
TO SOLVE A PROBLEM, NATSU.

30
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,791
- A LITTLE FIRE
OUGHTA DO THE TRICK!

31
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,250
- GRAY JUST PUNCHED NATSU!

32
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,958
- WELL, THIS WOULDN'T BE
THE FIRST TIME HE'S DONE THAT.

33
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,208
- WHAT'S THE DEAL?!

34
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,625
WHAT'D YOU HIT ME FOR, GRAY?!

35
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:12,625
- I DON'T WANT YOU AND
YOUR FLAMES ANYWHERE NEAR IT.

36
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,625
IF THAT ICE MELTS
AND DELIORA IS REVIVED...

37
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,708
THERE'S NO WAY WE'D BE
ABLE TO STOP IT.

38
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,125
- COME ON. DO YOU REALLY
THINK A HUGE CHUNK OF ICE

39
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,083
WOULD BE THAT EASY TO MELT?

40
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,416
- NO...
- HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

41
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,541
- I'M THE ONE WHO GOT HIT
FOR NO GOOD REASON!

42
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,000
WATCH YOUR TEMPER, MAN!

43
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,416
- PLEASE, YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.

44
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,041
- MANY YEARS AGO,
MY MASTER UR

45
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:42,291
CAST A SPELL CALLED ICED SHELL
ON THIS DEMON...

46
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:45,500
ENCLOSING IT IN A FORM OF ICE
THAT CAN'T BE MELTED.

47
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,333
IT'S SO STRONG THAT EVEN
THE MOST POWERFUL FLAME SPELLS

48
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,958
HAVE NO EFFECT ON IT.

49
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,416
IF THEY KNEW THAT THE ICE
COULDN'T BE MELTED,

50
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,208
THEN WHY DID THEY
BRING IT HERE?

51
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,041
- WELL, MAYBE
THEY DIDN'T KNOW.

52
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,208
THEY MIGHT'VE BROUGHT IT HERE
TO TRY TO MELT IT SOMEHOW.

53
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:01,625
- BUT WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?!
- UM, I HAVE NO IDEA.

54
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,791
- ( sighs )
I JUST DON'T GET IT.

55
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:08,208
WHO WOULD BRING DELIORA HERE,
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHY?

56
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:12,041
- WE NEED ANSWERS.
LET'S GO FIND THOSE GUYS.

57
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,666
- YEAH, OKAY.
- NO!

58
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,958
WE'RE GONNA STAY HERE
AND WAIT.

59
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,916
- WAIT FOR WHAT?
- FOR THE MOON TO COME OUT.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,375
- THE MOON?!

61
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,750
BUT IT'S THE MIDDLE OF
THE AFTERNOON!

62
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,583
FORGET THAT!

63
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,000
IF I HAVE TO HANG OUT HERE
ALL DAY, I'LL DIE OF BOREDOM!

64
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,583
- BUT GRAY,
WHY DOES THE MOON MATTER?

65
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,125
- I HAVE A FEELING
THAT THE CURSE ON THIS ISLAND

66
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:33,458
AND DELIORA ARE SOMEHOW
CONNECTED TO IT.

67
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,458
AND I HEARD THOSE GUYS
WE SAW EARLIER

68
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,541
SAY SOMETHING ABOUT
COLLECTING MOONLIGHT.

69
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,166
- I HEARD THAT TOO.
I GUESS WAITING TILL NIGHTFALL

70
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,083
IS THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA
FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

71
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,583
- I'M NOT WAITIN'!

72
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,000
WE GOT WORK TO DO!

73
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:50,041
( snoring )

74
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,000
- WELL, THAT WAS FAST.
- AYE.

75
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,625
- ( rock music playing )

76
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:58,000
- ( Happy speaking )

77
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,500
- MUST BE NICE...

78
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:00,916
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,458
BUT EATING, FIGHTING
AND SLEEPING.

80
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,541
- AYE.
THAT'S NATSU FOR YA.

81
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,875
- I GOTTA ADMIT,
I'M A LITTLE BIT JEALOUS.

82
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,250
- UR...

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,333
( panting )

84
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:28,875
- ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE
TO KEEP UP, GRAY?

85
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:32,916
I WARNED YOU,
TRAINING WITH ME CAN BE TOUGH.

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,958
- ( panting )

87
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,541
YEAH, BUT I'LL DO 
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

88
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,666
- ( groans )

89
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,500
I KNOW I AGREED TO WAIT,
BUT THIS IS SO BORING.

90
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,666
- AYE.
- OH, I KNOW!

91
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,666
OPEN-- GATE OF
THE HARP CONSTELLATION!

92
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,708
LYRA!

93
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,416
- OH, WOW!  I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN FOREVER, LUCY!

94
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,416
- HEY, LYRA!
- SAY...

95
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,375
HOW COME YOU NEVER
CALL ME ANYMORE?

96
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,625
IT'S NOT FAIR.
I WOULD LOVE TO HELP YOU OUT,

97
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,250
BUT YOU IGNORE ME, MEANIE.

98
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,916
- "MEANIE," HUH?

99
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,125
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TOLD ME
YOU WERE ONLY AVAILABLE

100
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,958
THREE DAYS A MONTH.
- UH...

101
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,041
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

102
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,958
- GREAT.  ANOTHER WEIRDO.

103
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,208
- ( snoring )

104
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,208
- SO WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HEAR ME SING?

105
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,333
ANY REQUESTS?

106
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,750
- NOPE, WHATEVER YOU WANT.

107
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,833
- DO YOU KNOW ANY SONGS
ABOUT FISH?

108
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:29,250
- 'KAY.  I'VE GOT A SONG I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE, LUCY!

109
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,458
- LYRA HAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
SINGING VOICE!

110
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,291
- WELL, MIRA'S A SINGER TOO,
YOU KNOW?

111
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,541
AND SHE SINGS SONGS

- NOTHING.  I'M FINE.

- YOU SEEM UPSET.

133
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,041
- WELL, ONE OF LYRA'S TALENTS
IS SINGING SONGS

134
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,833
THAT RELATE TO WHAT
HER AUDIENCE IS FEELING.

135
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,833
- DID HER SONG MAKE YOU CRY?

136
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,416
- I WASN'T CRYING.

137
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,000
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD SING
SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE UPBEAT.

138
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,291
- YOU SHOULD'VE JUST SAID THAT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

139
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,791
- ( Gray sighs )

140
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,583
I THINK WE SHOULD SKIP THE SONG.

141
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,291
WE NEED TO STAY QUIET.

142
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,875
WE DON'T WANNA BE FOUND OUT.

- ( rumbling )
- ( Natsu snoring ) 

144
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,375
- WHAT'S THAT WEIRD NOISE?

145
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:00,375
- IS IT NIGHT YET?

146
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,458
- IT'S A BEAM OF LIGHT!
- SHINING DOWN FROM THE CEILING!

147
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,083
- BUT WHY IS IT PURPLE?

148
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,791
IT MUST BE MOONLIGHT.

149
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,708
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
I'M GETTING SCARED, GRAY.

150
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,000
- IT'S SHINING ON DELIORA!

151
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,958
- I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A COINCIDENCE.

152
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,583
- LET'S GO.

153
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:30,875
WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHERE
THE LIGHT'S COMING FROM.

154
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,291
- AYE!

155
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:48,125
- WHY WOULD SOMEONE CAST A MAGIC
CIRCLE INSIDE THIS OLD TEMPLE?

156
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,708
- LET'S FIND OUT.

157
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:02,708
- All:
ZERAM, SEN, DIOLUNA...

158
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,875
KOO-NAH, KOO-RAH-KAH...
- WHAT ARE THEY DOING? 

159
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:11,333
- ...ZERAM, SEN, DIOLUNA,

160
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:14,708
KOO-NAH, KOO-RAH-KAH.

161
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,083
- THE MOON...

162
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,958
- IT LOOKS LIKE THOSE ROBED
FREAKS ARE CHANTING SOME SPELL

163
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,375
TO COLLECT THE MOONLIGHT.

164
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:25,375
- AND SHINE IT ON DELIORA.
BUT WHAT FOR?

165
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,958
- IT'S A BELIANESE SPELL
CALLED THE MOON DRIP.

166
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,750
- WHAT ARE YOU
STILL DOING HERE?!

167
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,958
- I SEE.  THAT'S WHAT
THEY'RE TRYING TO DO...

168
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,958
- OKAY, TEASE,
FILL US IN.

169
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,166
- THEY'RE USING THE MOON DRIP
SPELL TO MELT THE ICE

170
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,583
SURROUNDING THAT DEMON
UNDERGROUND

171
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,041
SO THEY CAN RESURRECT IT.

172
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,791
- Natsu: WHAT?!
- THEY CAN'T!

173
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,416
THE ICE USED IN AN ICED SHELL
CAN'T BE MELTED.

174
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,833
- I HATE TO SAY IT,
BUT THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY TRUE.

175
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,375
WHILE THE ICED SHELL
IS STRONG,

176
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,166
IT CAN BE MELTED
USING MOON DRIP.

177
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,583
FOCUSED MOON ENERGY CAN BREAK
ANY MAGICAL SPELL.

178
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:53,958
- OH, NO.

179
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,541
- IDIOTS.

180
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,625
THEY'VE NEVER WITNESSED
THE WRATH OF DELIORA.

181
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,625
- I THINK WHAT THE ISLANDERS
BELIEVE IS A CURSE AGAINST THEM,

182
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:04,000
MAY ACTUALLY BE SIDE EFFECTS
OF THE MOON DRIP.

183
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,791
CONCENTRATED MOON ENERGY
CAN CONTAMINATE YOUR BODY.

184
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,500
I'M AFRAID
THOSE POOR ISLANDERS

185
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,166
HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO WAY
TOO MUCH OF IT.

186
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,458
- I'LL MAKE 'EM PAY!

187
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,875
- HOLD IT!

188
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,416
SOMEONE'S COMING THIS WAY.

189
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:41,083
- WHAT A WASTE, I LOST SO MUCH
PRECIOUS SLEEP FOR NOTHING.

190
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,500
- ( snoring )

191
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,333
- WE SEARCHED ALL DAY
FOR THE INTRUDERS,

192
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,666
BUT NEVER FOUND A TRACE OF THEM.
- MAYBE THERE WASN'T ANY!

193
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:51,500
- I'M AFRAID I HAVE
SOME SAD NEWS, COLD EMPEROR.

194
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,916
WE THOUGHT WE HAD INTRUDERS
DURING THE DAY,

195
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,916
BUT IT SEEMS THEY GOT AWAY
SOMEHOW.

196
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,125
I CANNOT SPEAK OF LOVE
IN THIS SITUATION.

197
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,708
- INTRUDERS?

198
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:03,250
- ( exhales )
- SO THAT GUY'S THEIR LEADER.

199
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,416
- HE'S TRYING TO ACT
ALL HIGH AND MIGHTY,

200
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,125
WEARING THAT
STUPID-LOOKING MASK!

201
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,166
- I DON'T KNOW,
I THINK IT LOOKS KINDA COOL.

202
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,583
- HAS DELIORA BEEN AWAKENED YET?

203
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,666
- IT SHOULD BE LATER TONIGHT
OR TOMORROW, SIR.

204
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,958
- WHICH ONE, GIRL?!

205
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:19,583
- THE TIME HAS ALMOST COME.

206
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,000
IF YOU SEE THOSE INTRUDERS
AGAIN, KILL THEM.

207
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,416
I DON'T WANT ANYONE
GETTING IN MY WAY.

208
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,291
- THEY MUST HAVE BEEN VILLAGERS.

209
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,833
THEY'RE THE ONLY OTHER PEOPLE
ON THIS ISLAND.

210
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,583
- THEN DESTROY THE VILLAGE.

211
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,166
- YES, SIR!
- UNDERSTOOD!

212
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,958
- WHAT?!

213
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,250
- BUT THE VILLAGERS DIDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

214
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,125
- YEAH.
WE GOTTA STOP 'EM.

215
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:40,041
- IT'S A SHAME
THERE HAS TO BE BLOODSHED.

216
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,333
- THAT VOICE...

217
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,791
NO.  IT CAN'T BE.

218
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,958
- I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS
SNEAKING-AROUND BUSINESS!

219
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,666
IT'S NOT THE VILLAGERS!

220
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,166
WE'RE THE INTRUDERS
YOU'RE AFTER!

221
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,166
- ( all gasp )

222
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,916
- ( chuckles )

223
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,750
- JEEZ!  I GUESS THERE'S 
NO TURNING BACK NOW, HUH?

224
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,166
- I WANNA HELP OUT TOO!
WANT ME TO SING?

225
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,833
- NO, I WANT YOU TO GO BACK.

226
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,666
- AWW, YOU'RE NO FUN.

227
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,416
- I KNOW THAT MARK.
THEY'RE FROM FAIRY TAIL.

228
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,416
- INTERESTING.
THOSE VILLAGERS MUST'VE GONE

229
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,791
TO THE MAGICAL GUILDS
FOR HELP.

230
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,208
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT THEM.

231
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,375
GO ERADICATE THE VILLAGE.

232
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,083
- WHAT?!
- BUT WHY?!

233
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,083
- ANYONE WHO STANDS IN MY WAY,

234
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:28,000
WHETHER DELIBERATELY OR NOT,
IS MY ENEMY!

235
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,125
- SAY WHAT?!

236
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,041
( panting )
- WHY, YOU!

237
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,958
STOP THIS CRAZY CEREMONY
RIGHT NOW!

238
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,791
- ( grunting )

239
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,708
- HE'S AN ICE WIZARD TOO?

240
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,416
- LYON!

241
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,208
- HUH? 
- LYON?

242
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,041
- HOW COULD YOU?

243
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,666
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

244
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,125
- OH, GRAY.

245
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,083
IT'S BEEN QUITE A WHILE,
HASN'T IT?

246
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,166
- ( both gasp )

247
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,666
- WHY WOULD YOU
REVIVE DELIORA?

248
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,625
- TO THINK THAT YOU WERE
ONE OF THE WIZARDS

249
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,625
CALLED TO THIS ISLAND
TO HELP THOSE POOR VILLAGERS.

250
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,208
DID YOU COME
KNOWING YOU WOULD FIND ME?

251
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,208
OR IS THIS JUST
MERE COINCIDENCE?

252
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,625
NOT THAT IT MAKES ANY
DIFFERENCE TO ME.

253
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,041
- AN ACQUAINTANCE OF YOURS,
COLD EMPEROR?

254
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,125
- ( barks )
- DO AS YOU WERE ORDERED.

255
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,000
I CAN HANDLE THE INTRUDERS
ON MY OWN.

256
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,166
- YES, SIR!
- HEY, WAIT!  COME BACK HERE!

257
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,083
- NO, NATSU DON'T GO NEAR HIM!

258
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,125
- AAH!

259
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,666
- NATSU!
- HAPPY, GET LUCY OUTTA HERE!

260
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,583
- AYE! 
- WAIT!

261
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,750
- ( grunting )

262
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,875
- HA!

263
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,833
- WHAT?!  NO!
I CAN'T MOVE!

264
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,583
- HOLD ON, WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE
NATSU LIKE THAT.

265
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,208
- HE WAS HIT WITH A TYPE
OF ICE MAGIC

266
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,916
THAT INSTANTLY
FREEZES THE AIR.

267
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,750
IF WE HAD STUCK AROUND THERE
ANY LONGER,

268
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,583
WE PROBABLY WOULD'VE
BEEN FROZEN TOO.

269
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,416
- WHO CARES?
WE GOTTA SAVE HIM!

270
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,375
- BUT WHO'S GONNA
SAVE THE VILLAGE,

271
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,500
IF ALL OF US HAVE BEEN
TURNED INTO ICE?!

272
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,125
( cries )

273
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,541
- AW, I'M SORRY, HAPPY.

274
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,625
IT MUST'VE BEEN HARD FOR YOU
TO LEAVE HIM BEHIND.

275
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,833
DON'T YOU WORRY,
I'M SURE HE'LL BE FINE.

276
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,291
ICE IS NO MATCH FOR 
A SALAMANDER, RIGHT?

277
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:21,666
- AYE!

278
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,541
- YOU DISTRACTED ME
LONG ENOUGH

279
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,000
FOR THE GIRL
AND THE CAT TO ESCAPE.

280
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,000
CHIVALROUS,
BUT ULTIMATELY POINTLESS.

281
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,625
THERE'S NO WAY THOSE TWO
CAN STOP MY MINIONS.

282
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,833
- DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER
OF FAIRY TAIL WIZARDS!

283
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,416
NOW!

284
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,666
AAH!

285
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,875
OH, AAH!

286
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,833
WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA, GRAY?!

287
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,000
- I SEE YOU'RE AS RECKLESS
AS EVER.

288
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,083
WAS HE NOT ONE OF YOUR ALLIES?

289
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,166
- YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
THAT WITH ONE SPELL

290
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,125
YOU COULD BLOW UP THAT ICE
AND HIM WITH IT.

291
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,791
- SO YOU CHOSE TO SEND HIM
SAFELY

292
00:15:58,875 --> 00:15:59,958
OUTSIDE THE RANGE OF MY MAGIC.

293
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,416
THAT WAS A VERY CLEVER MOVE.

294
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,541
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU'RE TRYING TO PULL THIS

295
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,041
SUPERIOR ACT WITH ME, LYON.

296
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:09,833
YOU'RE NOT!  WE'RE NOT
UR'S STUDENTS ANYMORE!

297
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,791
- I'M WELL AWARE OF THAT.
PAINFULLY AWARE.

298
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:17,333
OUR BELOVED TEACHER
IS NO LONGER OF THIS WORLD.

299
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,958
- HER FINAL ACT WAS SEALING
THAT MONSTER AWAY.

300
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,708
ARE YOU REALLY SO CALLOUS

301
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,291
THAT YOU WOULD TRY TO DESTROY
OUR MASTER'S LEGACY?

302
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,416
- DON'T DELUDE YOURSELF.

303
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,083
WE BOTH KNOW YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO KILLED UR.

304
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,250
AND YET, YOU DON'T SEEM
TO FEEL ANY GUILT.

305
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,083
HOW CRUEL.

306
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:41,500
- ( muffled groaning )

307
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,916
AAH!

308
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,750
( chuckles )

309
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,583
GRAY, YOU PUNK!

310
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,458
OH, YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR THIS!

311
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:52,458
MY FIRE POWER ISN'T MAKING
A DENT IN THIS ICE.

312
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,291
MAN, WHAT'S THE DEAL?

313
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:57,125
( panting )

314
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,541
I'VE GOTTA GET BACK
TO THE VILLAGE.

315
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,416
I'LL JUST HAVE TO RUN.

316
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,916
AW, MAN, THIS IS HARDER
THAN I THOUGHT IT'D BE!

317
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,916
UH, AAH!

318
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,833
- ( all moaning, groaning )

319
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,833
- UH, WHY DO YOU WANNA GO
TO GALUNA ISLAND?

320
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,458
AH, IT'S SCARY.

321
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,833
- JUST SHUT UP AND STEER.
- OKAY, OKAY...

322
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,416
- ( all moaning, groaning )

323
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,041
- IF YOU DROP US OFF SOMEWHERE,
YOU CAN HAVE THE BOAT.

324
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,875
PLEASE, I'M BEGGING YOU, LADY!

325
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,625
I'VE HEARD
THAT ISLAND IS CURSED,

326
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,875
AND ANYONE WHO STEPS FOOT ON
ITS SOIL TURNS INTO A DEMON!

327
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,708
- I WILL TAKE THAT CHANCE.

328
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,375
- BUT WHY DO YOU 
HAVE TO GO THERE?

329
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:45,625
- WHEN RULES ARE BROKEN,
THE GUILTY MUST BE PUNISHED.

330
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,458
AND THAT IS ALL
I CAN TELL YOU.

331
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,666
- SHE'S SO COOL!
- AND HOT TOO!

332
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,375
- WE DON'T LIKE RULE-BREAKERS
EITHER!

333
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,875
- WE'LL HELP YOU CATCH 'EM
IF YOU WANT!

334
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,500
- SURE.
NOW LET'S HURRY.

335
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,500
- AYE-AYE, SIR!
- I WANNA JOIN YOUR TEAM TOO!

336
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,958
I'LL BRAVE THAT SCARY ISLAND
FOR YOU!

337
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,958
LISTEN UP,
YOU SCALAWAGS,

338
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,666
RAISE THE SAILS,
AND SET COURSE

339
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,375
FOR THE CURSED ISLAND
OF GALUNA.

340
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,583
- ENOUGH WITH THE GAMES, GRAY.

341
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:18,666
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
MURDERED UR, SO JUST ADMIT IT.

342
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,875
I'M SURPRISED YOU HAVE THE GALL
TO EVEN SPEAK HER NAME!

343
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,291
- AAH!

344
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,333
LYON...

345
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,958
- WHAT'S WRONG?

346
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,750
DON'T TELL ME THE GUILT IS
FINALLY GETTING TO YOU.

347
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,583
I'M WARNING YOU,
DON'T TRY TO INTERFERE.

348
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:41,166
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT,
I'M RESURRECTING DELIORA.

349
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,541
- I WON'T LET YOU.

350
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,083
- IT'S LIKE OLD TIMES.

351
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,833
BUT I'VE GROWN MUCH STRONGER
SINCE THEN.

352
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,791
ICE MAKE: EAGLE!

353
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,916
- ICE MAKE: SHIELD!

354
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,041
AAH!

355
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,500
- WHILE YOUR SPECIALTY IS
CREATING INANIMATE OBJECTS--

356
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,708
STATIC ICE MAKE MAGIC--

357
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,125
MINE IS CREATING 
LIVING CREATURES.

358
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,125
ACTIVE ICE MAKE MAGIC.

359
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,958
DID YOU FORGET MY ICE
HAS THE ABILITY TO MOVE?

360
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,416
- ICE MAKE: HAMMER!

361
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,458
- ICE MAKE: APE!

362
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,416
HOW PATHETIC.

363
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,583
YOU STILL USE TWO HANDS WHEN 
CASTING YOUR ICE MAKE SPELLS.

364
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,458
- YEAH, 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT
UR TAUGHT US.

365
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,750
SINGLE-HANDED SPELL CASTING IS
INCOMPLETE AND UNBALANCED.

366
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,875
- WELL, I'M THE EXCEPTION
TO THAT RULE.

367
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:45,291
I SURPASSED UR'S SKILL LEVEL
A LONG TIME AGO.

368
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,458
- SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

369
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,875
- REGARDLESS, EVER SINCE
WE WERE CHILDREN,

370
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:53,041
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO LAND A SINGLE HIT ON ME.

371
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,250
- ( growls )

372
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:59,750
I'M A LOT STRONGER NOW
THAN I USED TO BE.

373
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,541
ICE MAKE: GEYSER!

374
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,375
- ( all screaming, clamoring )

375
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,458
- NOTHING HAS CHANGED.

376
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,875
I WAS ALWAYS
THE SUPERIOR STUDENT,

377
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,291
AND I'M STILL
STRONGER THAN YOU.

378
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,500
I WAS ABLE TO MASTER
SINGLE-HANDED ICE MAKE MAGIC,

379
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:26,291
WHILE YOU STILL HAVE TO
RELY ON TWO HANDS.

380
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,458
IT'S JUST LIKE THE OLD DAYS.

381
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,458
WE MAY HAVE CHOSEN
DIFFERENT PATHS,

382
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,291
BUT WE'RE FROZEN IN TIME.

383
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,833
OUR RANKINGS AS WIZARDS
NEVER CHANGE.

384
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,000
- AAH!

385
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,958
- THAT'S WHY
I'M RESURRECTING DELIORA--

386
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,708
TO PROVE THAT I AM
MORE THAN UR'S STAR PUPIL.

387
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:51,875
AS A CHILD, I ONLY EVER DREAMT
OF ONE THING...

388
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:55,583
THE DAY I WOULD SURPASS UR'S
ABILITIES AS A WIZARD.

389
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:58,458
BUT YOU RUINED IT FOR ME,
GRAY.

390
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,083
AFTER SHE DIED,
I THOUGHT MY LIFELONG DREAM

391
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:04,250
OF SURPASSING HER 
HAD BEEN DASHED...

392
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:08,291
UNTIL I REALIZED, 
THERE WAS ONE WAY.

393
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,500
IF I CAN DEFEAT DELIORA,

394
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:14,791
A DEMON SO STRONG THAT
NOT EVEN UR COULD VANQUISH IT,

395
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,791
THEN I WILL HAVE
SURPASSED HER POWER.

396
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,791
MY DREAM WILL FINALLY
BECOME A REALITY.

397
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,375
- LISTEN TO ME.

398
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,041
THAT THING DESTROYED
EVERYTHING WE CARED ABOUT!

399
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,916
AND YOU WANNA BRING IT BACK JUST
TO PROVE HOW STRONG YOU ARE?!

400
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,750
THAT'S INSANE!

401
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,416
PLEASE!  YOU CAN'T DO THIS!

402
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,875
AAH!

403
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,625
"PLEASE.  YOU CAN'T DO THIS"?

404
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:36,583
REALLY?

405
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,541
FUNNY YOU SAY THAT.

406
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:46,250
THOSE WERE THE EXACT WORDS
WE SAID TO YOU THAT FATEFUL DAY.

407
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,625
SURELY,
YOU HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN?

408
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,666
IT'S BECAUSE YOU CHALLENGED
DELIORA...

409
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,500
THAT UR LOST HER LIFE!

410
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,041
I CAN'T STAND YOU

411
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,458
EVEN SPEAKING HER NAME
IN MY PRESENCE!

412
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,208
BE GONE!

413
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,625
THIS IS THE END, GRAY!

414
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,750
- ( grunts )

415
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,708
( screams )

416
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:10,250
- ( end theme playing )

417
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,958
- ( singing in Japanese )

418
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:50,458
- PROFESSOR HAPPY'S CLASS
ABOUT FAIRY TAIL!

419
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:51,875
TODAY, I'M GONNA
TEACH YOU GUYS

420
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:53,500
ALL ABOUT
NATSU THE FIRE WIZARD.

421
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,000
YAY!

422
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:57,000
NATSU WAS RAISED BY
A DRAGON NAMED IGNEEL,

423
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:59,208
WHO TAUGHT HIM
RARE DRAGON SLAYER MAGIC.

424
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:01,625
SO HE CAN EAT FIRE,
BREATHE FIRE

425
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,583
AND ATTACK WITH FIRE.
HIS ONLY WEAKNESS,

426
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,000
AS YOU'VE PROBABLY
ALREADY NOTICED,

427
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:07,291
IS A REALLY BAD CASE
OF MOTION SICKNESS. 

428
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,875
WELL, THAT'S TODAY'S CLASS.

429
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:11,583
DISMISSED!  AYE!

430
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:16,250
- MAN, THAT DELIORA THING
IS GIGANTIC, HUH?

431
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:19,083
- YEAH, IT'S PROBABLY BIGGER
THAN A PILE OF 1,000 FISH.

432
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,625
- HUH, I WONDER WHAT KIND OF
FOOD YOU'D HAVE TO EAT

433
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:22,833
TO GET THAT BIG.

434
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:23,958
- I BET LOTS AND LOTS
OF FISH WOULD WORK,

435
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:25,416
'CAUSE THEY'RE
FULL OF CALCIUM,

436
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,083
AND OTHER STUFF THAT'S
GOOD FOR YOU.

437
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,708
- EH, FISH IS OKAY,

438
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:30,625
BUT I'M MORE OF
A MEAT MAN MYSELF.

439
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:33,208
- ( Happy and Natsu speaking )

440
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,208
- Happy: IF YOU EVER GOT
THAT BIG,

441
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:36,833
I BET YOU'D GET ARRESTED
ALL THE TIME.

442
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:38,625
- HEY, WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

443
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:39,833
- 'CAUSE IT'D BE THAT MUCH
EASIER FOR YOU

444
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:41,416
TO DESTROY A TOWN.
