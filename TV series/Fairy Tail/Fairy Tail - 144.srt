You know. She told
him that she hated cats.

163
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh, so she rejected him?

164
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,083
He must be heartbroken!

165
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,291
How sad!

166
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,458
[PANTHERLILY]
There's enough drama in this

167
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:50,750
situation without you
making up stories!

168
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,500
[HAPPY] Sorry!
Please don't hurt me.

169
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,333
There's something
else you should know.

170
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,041
The orders given
to Lord Byro and me

171
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,458
were bizarre to say the least.

172
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,791
Bizarre how?

173
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,041
[SAMUEL] We were given
a task I don't understand.

174
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,833
But what's most
perplexing is we weren't

175
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,875
ordered to recover
the Infinity Clock.

176
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,250
[SAMUEL]
As far as I'm concerned,

177
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,625
stopping it should be
our top priority right now!

178
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,583
Oh, I see.

179
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,500
That is rather
bizarre, isn't it?

180
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,000
[HAPPY] In that case,
looks like we're gonna

181
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,583
have to work together
from here on out!

182
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,166
[PANTHERLILY]
So that's why you wanted

183
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,416
to know whether
Carla had any visions.

184
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,625
Even after all of this,

185
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,375
Lord Byro's loyalty
still remains intact.

186
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,125
But I however...

187
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:28,625
[PANTHERLILY]
You sure aren't putting up as

188
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,708
much of a fight
this time, Sammy!

189
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,875
[PANTHERLILY] There's a
hesitation behind your attacks.

190
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,083
You'll never be
able to defeat me

191
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,208
until you can fight
with utter certainty.

192
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,041
[PANTHERLILY]
We'll have to put an end to

193
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,125
whatever is causing your doubt.

194
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,958
[GUTMAN] You go boom now!

195
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,375
He's a monster.

196
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:54,250
[GAJEEL] I'm still
standin', ya blockhead!

197
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,791
[GUTMAN] Yeah, but not for long!

198
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,541
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

199
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,583
I'm just gettin' started.

200
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,291
[MARY] Just give up already!

201
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,541
You don't stand a
chance against this freak!

202
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,958
He's, like, way
stronger than all of us!

203
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,208
[GUTMAN]
Yep, listen to the lady.

204
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,083
Y'know, back when I was
with Phantom I might've turned

205
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:19,666
around and just walked away,
but unfortunately for you.

206
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,041
I'm a Fairy Tail wizard now.

207
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:25,125
[GAJEEL] So that means there
ain't no way I'm givin' up!

208
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,875
You can beat me to a pulp
and I'll still keep fightin'!

209
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,333
[GAJEEL] There's no stoppin' us.

210
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,708
Right Juvia?

211
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,416
[JUVIA] Thanks for buying
me some time, Gajeel.

212
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,750
[JUVIA] I'm feeling
much better now.

213
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,416
[GUTMAN] Oh no, it's a trap!
Are you kidding?

214
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,041
I can get outta this, easy!

215
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,000
[JUVIA] Go ahead and
give it your best shot.

216
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,000
[GUTMAN] Alright, fine!

217
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,333
You're goin' boom, lady!

218
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,208
[GUTMAN] What're you doing?

219
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,791
I don't wanna get hurt, too!

220
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,333
Let go of me!!

221
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,750
[JUVIA] That's not gonna happen!

222
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,083
Now Gajeel!

223
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,208
[GAJEEL] You got it!

224
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,958
Now it's your turn
to go boom scumbag!

225
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,666
[GAJEEL] Not bad but
our timin' could use some work.

226
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,541
It would've timed out perfectly
if Gray were my partner.

227
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:12,666
[GAJEEL] Oh ya don't say.

228
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,916
[MARY] They're so awesome.

229
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,416
They, like, totally beat
"Gutman the Cleaner."

230
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,875
I can't believe it!

231
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,541
[BIXLOW] Hey!
Wake up!

232
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,541
Open your eyes or else, Erigor!

233
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,166
Uh. You don't have
to be so rough with him.

234
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,500
I don't have to be nice,
he's the enemy!

235
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,208
C'mon, man!

236
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,916
Hurry up and tell me
what you guys are plannin'!

237
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,958
Where's the Infinity Clock?

238
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,583
Sorry I don't know...
Everything's hazy.

239
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,208
I have no idea
what I was even doing.

240
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,958
[WENDY] He just got
his memory back.

241
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,125
It might be a while before he's
able to think clearly again.

242
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,875
Do you even remember
anything at this point?

243
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,083
[ERIGOR]
I remember having a horrible

244
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,625
nightmare while I was in prison.

245
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,041
[ERIGOR]
It's hard to explain but it was

246
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,250
like someone snuck
into my dream.

247
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,041
After that, it was over.

248
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,375
[BIXLOW] So lemme guess,
when you woke up

249
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,541
you'd suddenly
become Grim Reaper?

250
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,666
[WENDY] I could be
wrong about this,

251
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,541
but it sounds like
someone cast a spell

252
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,458
to use your dreams
to control you.

253
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,291
[ERIGOR] I fear you're right.

254
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:09,833
[BIXLOW] Yep, that's it.

255
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,541
And I bet they're manipulating
their targets' brain waves.

256
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,833
That way, they can take control
slowly without being noticed.

257
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,125
 If only I had
known before

258
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,791
I agreed to give
up my memory.

259
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,791
I was granted powerful
magic which allowed me

260
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,833
to control the weather,
but it wasn't worth it.

261
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,375
[ERIGOR] I forgot everything!

262
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,208
It was gone in a flash.

263
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,125
I can't imagine anything
more agonizing than that.

264
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,583
[ERIGOR] I never
understood why they say

265
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:34,500
"great power comes at
a price," but I do now.

266
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,458
I was lost.

267
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:39,083
Until I heard your
voice calling to me.

268
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,708
I've no intention
of being your friend,

269
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,750
but please allow
me to thank you.

270
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,666
Of course!

271
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:47,500
Wait a sec.

272
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,916
Cana!

273
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,250
Right before she
picked out all our teams.

274
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,000
She was talking about
how tired she felt.

275
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,083
[WENDY] Now that you mention it,

276
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,500
she did say she
had been sleeping a lot.

277
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,041
Do you think she's
being controlled through

278
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,708
her dreams and
she just doesn't realize it?

279
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,458
[BIXLOW] There's no
other way to explain it;

280
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,208
they manipulated her
into picking teams

281
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,875
that work best for them!

282
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,458
[WENDY] Oh, no!

283
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,625
[BIXLOW] Man, this sucks! We've
fallen right into their trap!

284
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,291
[MIDNIGHT]
I'd expect no less of the

285
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,958
renowned celestial
wizard Will Neville.

286
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:28,125
Even in death, you're protected
by intense magic power.

287
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:31,208
But it's not going to be
able to protect you forever.

288
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,666
[ALZACK] Hold it right there!

289
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,000
I don't know what
you're tryin' to do,

290
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,791
but we're not gonna
let you get away with it!

291
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,875
[MIDNIGHT] Well, well,
what do we have here?

292
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,458
This should be amusing.

293
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,458
[ALZACK] You must be Brain the
Second, of the Neo-Oración Seis.

294
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,250
[ALZACK] Let's go!

295
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,708
Alright, how 'bout this?

296
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,750
Omni-directional formation!

297
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,500
What a joke.

298
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,833
[BISCA] Okay, babe...
Just a little longer!

299
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:09,166
[MIDNIGHT] I applaud you for
trying, but no one can stop me.

300
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,625
Now!

301
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,125
[BISCA] One shot.
One down!

302
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,791
[Bisca screams]

303
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:20,875
[ALZACK] Bisca.

304
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,333
She has skill,
but lacks the resolve

305
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,208
needed to shoot another person.

306
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,166
You see, in order
to achieve greatness.

307
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,541
One must be willing to
pay an even greater price.

308
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,125
I can tell just by looking
at the two of you.

309
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:36,541
You're simply not willing
to make that kind of sacrifice.

310
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,166
[JACKPOT] Here goes!
Oh, we've got a match!

311
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,041
Anti-Link time!

312
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,750
What did you just do?

313
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:50,958
[Jackpot laughs]

314
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,125
[JACKPOT] Now don't
get your panties in a

315
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,958
wad over things that
don't concern you.

316
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,708
[JACKPOT] You just need
to focus on carrying out

317
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,625
the cardinal's orders
like a good little boy.

318
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:58,875
[BYRO] Say what?

319
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,166
[NATSU] Quit your blabbin'
and come fight me!

320
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,583
[JACKPOT]
Okay! Wow!

321
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:06,291
Another Lightning Bolt
Bonus--What the--?

322
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,916
How'd you hit me?

323
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,708
You will suffer the consequences
for this sinful destruction!

324
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,000
[NATSU] Fire Dragon Talon!

325
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,333
[JACKPOT]
What have you done to me?

326
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,875
Now I can't use my Slot Magic!

327
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,583
I don't even know
who I am without it!

328
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,541
You're gonna give
me an identity crisis!

329
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,875
[NATSU] I knew I'd get
a hit in eventually!

330
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,666
But that was nothin'
compared to this!

331
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:28,208
[NATSU] Fire Dragon Wing Attack!

332
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,833
[NATSU] Fire Dragon Roar!

333
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:39,416
Something's wrong.
I've got this feeling.

334
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,083
I don't know what it is,
but it's bad.

335
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:44,125
[MICHELLE] Big Sister.
Don't worry.

336
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,833
I'll be here no matter what.

337
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,458
[MAX] I think the screaming
came from this way!

338
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:56,083
[ERZA] This is horrible!
What happened here?

339
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,583
[ERZA] So that's why
Cobra ran off.

340
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,125
Monster.

341
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:07,041
[MIDNIGHT] The celestial wizard
Anti-Links are now complete!

342
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,208
Huh? What does
that mean?

343
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:14,083
Their body links
have all been severed.

344
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,083
[MIDNIGHT] O, great Neville.

345
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,541
The Amplitude Limiters
have finally been released.

346
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,166
Now nothing stands
in the way of your nightmare.

347
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,583
[ARCHBISHOP] Soon It
shall blanket the entire world!

348
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,375
The chaos that was
sealed has been set free!

349
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,625
[ARCHBISHOP] It will be
unleashed upon the unsuspecting

350
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:35,916
world and the never-ending
nightmare will finally begin!

351
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,625
[Archbishop laughs maniacally]

352
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,000
[ARCHBISHOP] The end is near!

353
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,291
It is within our grasp!

354
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,500
Yes, The end is near!

355
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,166
It's within our grasp!

356
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,791
[Archbishop laughs maniacally]

357
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,500
[MAX] What the heck?

358
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,583
Aw C'mon, this has gotta
be some kinda joke!

359
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,541
[ERZA] Do you hear that sound?

360
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,583
[WENDY] The Infinity Clock
has been released.

361
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,375
[BIXLOW] What?
That can't be it!

362
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,166
It's way too big!

363
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,291
[ERIGOR] That is indeed
the Infinity Clock.

364
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,375
It was hidden above the
Grand Cathedral of Zentopia.

365
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,125
[BIXLOW] Now what happens?

366
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,708
[GUTMAN] You won't find
this version of Zentopia's

367
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,625
doctrine in your
widdle history books.

368
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,583
This is where good
and evil come together.

369
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,625
Where the beginning
meets the end.

370
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,750
[GUTMAN] We did exactly what
Cardinal Lapointe told us to do.

371
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,541
And the archbishop told him!

372
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,250
[GUTMAN] I don't know what
they wanna do with this,

373
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,458
but honestly,
it's not like I need to know.

374
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,500
[GUTMAN] For the doctrine!

375
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,291
For Zentopia!

376
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:58,833
Victory-wictory is all ours.

377
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,500
[HAPPY] Look, it's a giant fish!

378
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,291
I don't think it'd be very
tasty 'cause it's all bones!

379
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,916
[SAMUEL]
It appears we're too late!

380
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,791
If only I hadn't wasted so
much time by doubting myself!

381
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,791
I shudder to think about
what's going to happen next!

382
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,416
Where are you going, Sammy?

383
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,458
To see the truth
with my own eyes.

384
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:17,041
I'm going to the Grand
Cathedral of Zentopia!

385
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,500
[HAPPY] Hey, come back!

386
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,416
You never told us about
the weird orders the

387
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,833
cardinal gave you and Byro!

388
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,333
Be careful.

389
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,541
[PANTHERLILY] Coco.

390
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,708
What are those things?

391
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,750
[citizens talk in fear]

392
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,166
[NATSU] Aw man, now what?

393
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,166
It would appear that the

394
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,666
Infinity Clock has
been activated.

395
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,750
Oh no?

396
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,375
We have gotta find
a way to stop it!

397
00:17:56,458 --> 00:18:00,291
I'm afraid. I cannot
help you with that.

398
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,833
I've been ordered to take
you to the cardinal,

399
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,750
Lucy Heartfilia.

400
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,833
[NATSU] What?

401
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,583
Why now all of a sudden?

402
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,250
What could he
possibly want with me?

403
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,333
I don't quite
understand it, either.

404
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:14,458
But it's my duty to follow
orders so please cooperate.

405
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,000
You're not takin'
her anywhere, got it?

406
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,875
I couldn't care
less about your orders!

407
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,541
Look at that thing in the sky!

408
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,208
We can't waste any time!

409
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,916
[LUCY] I know you're just
trying to do the right thing

410
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,708
but deep down you've
gotta know that's not it!

411
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,416
No, I don't.

412
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,750
[KLODOA] Byro.

413
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,083
You're only making this
harder on yourself by thinking.

414
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,958
Why are you hesitating?

415
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,000
Simply remain faithful
to the doctrine

416
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,166
and carry out your orders!

417
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,125
Not you again!

418
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,833
That creepy,
talking stick!

419
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,541
[KLODOA] My name is Klodoa.

420
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,625
I am the seventh member
of the Oración Seis.

421
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,458
Otherwise known as the
brains of the operation.

422
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:50,958
You remember, dontcha?

423
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,291
[LUCY] The seventh member?

424
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,541
Wait a minute.

425
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,625
Aren't you short a person?

426
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,541
[KLODOA] There's no need
to hide the truth any longer.

427
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,250
The time has come
for you to reveal yourself!

428
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,333
[KLODOA] Shed that disguise
you've been hiding behind

429
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,333
and show these "friends"
of yours who you really are!

430
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,750
Who, Michelle?

431
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,083
That's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard!

432
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,500
If you're trying
to confuse me

433
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,291
it's not gonna work
this time, stick man!

434
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,458
That girl is Michelle Lobster!

435
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,291
And she's like family!

436
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,125
She's my sis!

437
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,083
She traveled
all over to find me

438
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,583
and give me dad's memento.

439
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,541
She's all the family
I've got now that he's gone.

440
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,291
Don't worry,
I won't fall for his tricks!

441
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,833
I know better than to believe
anything that creep has to say!

442
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,791
Hey, what's wrong?

443
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,041
Michelle.

444
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,166
Please tell me it's not true.

445
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,125
Please!

446
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,958
Careful.

447
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,333
I'm sorry I hurt
you. Big Sister.

448
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,000
Why...
Michelle?

449
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:13,750
[IMITATIA] You see?

450
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:17,250
I truly am a member
of the Neo-Oración Seis.

451
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,500
The mistress of deception.

452
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,916
They call me Imitatia.

453
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,583
[IMITATIA] We needed you
and your friends to gather the

454
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,541
parts of the Infinity Clock
and assemble it for us.

455
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,208
[IMITATIA] That's why I took
the form of Michelle Lobster.

456
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,458
It was the only way
I could earn your trust.

457
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,708
How could you be so cruel?

458
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,250
I treated you like family.

459
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,708
[IMITATIA]
We're willing to do whatever

460
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,916
it takes to emerge victorious.

461
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,333
We attacked the
churches in order

462
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,500
to sever all known body links.

463
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,750
Thereby releasing the
seal on the Infinity Clock.

464
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,000
[IMITATIA] Now that that
goal has been achieved.

465
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:56,166
You are the only
one who is still needed.

466
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,333
Big Sister Lucy.

467
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,083
What's gotten into you?

468
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,791
[LUCY]
Wait, I know!

469
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,041
They must be controlling
you with a spell!

470
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,291
Don't worry, I'll help you.

471
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,833
[NATSU] Stay away from her.

472
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,250
So you were lying to
us the whole time, Michelle?

473
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,625
[IMITATIA] That's not my name.

474
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,250
[NATSU] Answer me!

475
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,625
No, stop!

476
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,125
[KLODOA] A critical
hit right off the bat!

477
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,416
That's my girl!

478
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,833
[IMITATIA] Byro.

479
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,875
Don't tell me you've forgotten
the orders Lapointe gave you?

480
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,916
Take Lucy Heartfilia
back to him at once.

481
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,708
You are in no position
to tell me what to do!

482
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,583
My loyalty lies with
the church of Zentopia!

483
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,416
[BYRO] That belongs
to the Archbishop!

484
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,416
[KLODOA] Whoever
holds his gold seal wields

485
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,750
the same authority
as the archbishop himself.

486
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,166
[IMITATIA]
From this point forward,

487
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,000
my orders and the archbishop's
are one and the same.

488
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,500
[BYRO] Very well.

489
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,083
As you wish.

490
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,958
[KLODOA] If you ask me,
we should go ahead and

491
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,083
kill the Dragon Slayer
while we have the chance.

492
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,625
[IMITATIA] No.
I want to bring him with us.

493
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,750
I have a feeling he'll prove
quite useful as a hostage.

494
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:09,875
[KLODOA] Fine.

495
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,791
Guess I'll let him live for now.

496
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,416
But don't forget
that showing pity to

497
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,958
your enemies is
frowned upon, Imitatia.

498
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,500
Yes, I'm well aware.

499
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,375
Please.
Michelle.

500
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:22,041
Just talk to me!

501
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,041
[KLODOA] I thought
there was supposed

502
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,375
to be three of them here.

503
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,000
Did one get away?

504
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,000
We're in trouble!

505
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:32,750
[WARREN] What'd you say?

506
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:33,833
Can you speak up?

507
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,916
Seriously, I can
barely hear you!

508
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:39,166
[WARREN] You there?
Hey, Elfman!

509

♪

510
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,500
[NATSU] Aw man, I'm so sleepy.

511
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:15,958
[HAPPY] I don't know
how you could be.

512
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:17,708
I mean, you sleep
like a freakin' log.

513
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,208
[NATSU] Not lately.

514
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,125
I dunno what's up but I keep
havin' these creepy dreams.

515
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:22,291
[HAPPY] You have nightmares?

516
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:23,125
Seriously?

517
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:24,333
[NATSU] What?

518
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:25,916
Am I not allowed to
have 'em or somethin'?

519
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
[HAPPY] I'm just shocked to find
out you have a sensitive side.

520
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:30,875
Wow, you're not
a callous jerk after all!

521
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:33,333
[HAPPY AND NATSU]
Next time: Real Nightmare!

522
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:36,208
Hey, watch your mouth or I'm
gonna be your real nightmare!

523
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:37,291
[HAPPY] Now hold on a minute!

524
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,208
Just calm down!

525
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:39,541
Can't we talk this over?

526
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,875
[NATSU] The "callous jerk"
doesn't bother talkin'!
