00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,125
[ERZA] a small price to pay
for the chance to dance.

165
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,000
You do remember that
we came all this way to catch

166
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,041
an escaped convict, right?

167
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,250
Um, you're a little early.

168
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,833
[WARREN, telepathic scream]
Whoa, what a fox!

169
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,375
Was it really
necessary to scream

170
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,208
that inside
of my head?

171
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,083
[GRAY] We're here
to see the count.

172
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,583
[GIRL] Yes,
of course you are.

173
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:36,250
My name is Aceto and my
father is Count Balsamico.

174
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,958
[WARREN] She's too pretty
to have such an ugly name.

175
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,458
[ALL] Everybody
can hear you, ya idiot!

176
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,083
My name is Natsu
and we're with Fairy Tail.

177
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,875
We've come here
concerning the job request

178
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,958
that your father posted
in our guild hall.

179
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,541
In that case, I'll
take you right to him.

180
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,083
Please, follow me.

181
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,000
Welcome, and thank
you for taking my request.

182
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,250
I am indeed Count Balsamico!

183
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,416
This guy is hilarious!

184
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,666
He's got a sour name!

185
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,125
And a sour
face to match!

186
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,833
Don't screw this
up for me, okay?

187
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,625
[BALSAMICO] Let me get
straight to the matter.

188
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,666
I want you to know
there is more to the story

189
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,041
than what was
written on the flyer.

190
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,791
Please, go on.

191
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,750
I am exceedingly
concerned for the well being

192
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,666
of my precious daughter, who
means more than the world to me.

193
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,333
Then why'd you give
her such a silly name?

194
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:22,750
It's a lovely name!

195
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,750
I apologize and
please, continue Sir.

196
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,208
[BALSAMICO] The ball being held
this evening is very special,

197
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,583
for it is tonight that her
future husband shall be chosen.

198
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,750
Yeah, that is
a pretty major deal!

199
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,125
[BALSAMICO] Once every seven
years, our family brings out

200
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,041
an extremely precious ring.

201
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,708
A ring that has
been passed down through

202
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:43,000
the Balsamico family line
for countless generations!

203
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,916
And you're afraid that
Velveno is gonna come here

204
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,875
and try to steal it from you?

205
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,583
[BALSAMICO] I'm
absolutely certain of it,

206
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:51,125
since he tried and
failed seven years ago.

207
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,166
But he did ruin
the ceremony to choose

208
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,625
my daughter's husband.

209
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,750
I see, but given his
"unique" appearance.

210
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,708
Wouldn't sneaking in
undetected prove to be

211
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,541
a bit difficult for him?

212
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,875
He is very skilled in
both transformation magic

213
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,250
and "Magical Drain."

214
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,666
"Magical Drain"?

215
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,875
What the heck's that?

216
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,916
[BALSAMICO] It allows him
to temporarily copy the type

217
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,958
of magic used by anyone
he comes into contact with.

218
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,833
It's very dangerous indeed.

219
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,750
Aw man, I wanna use magic
like that sometime!

220
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,083
I entrust full safety
of the ring to you.

221
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,916
Work together and make sure
he fails to snatch it again.

222
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,708
And what's more, I want
you to capture him

223
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,583
and put him back behind bars
where he rightfully belongs!

224
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,416
We'll catch this
clown for ya.

225
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,333
Yes. We will, Sir.

226
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,875
Uh, just one more thing.

227
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,083
The flyer mentioned a
certain reward if we were

228
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,375
to catch him for you?

229
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,666
That's correct,

230
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,958
four million jewel in
cash for his capture.

231
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,541
Oh yeah!

232
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,500
Cash is king!

233
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,000
Let's do this!

234
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,583
All done, baby.

235
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,000
Thank you.

236
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,541
But what'll happen if I'm
so beautiful that someone

237
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,666
proposes to me instead?

238
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,333
[ERZA] Ready to
get to work, Lucy?

239
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,708
Holy fashion
statement,

240
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,666
you are definitely
not playing around!

241
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,041
Although we've come here
strictly for business purposes,

242
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,666
we have to look the part
of elegant partygoers.

243
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,916
[WENDY] So, uh, do I look okay?

244
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,791
Okay?

245
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,666
You look absolutely adorable.

246
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,500
Thank you.

247
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,458
I never dress up like this.

248
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,750
Now then!

249
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,875
The curtain is rising
on the magical ball,

250
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,500
so let's take our places
on the dance floor!

251
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,375
I haven't seen her this
worked up since we were

252
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,958
in that weird
play together.

253
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,541
Okay, I'll try not
to mess this up.

254
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,666
[WENDY] I wonder if I should
cast a Troia spell on Natsu

255
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,166
before we get started.

256
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,666
[ERZA, telepathicly] Warren,
any sign of our man Velveno?

257
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,041
I've got surveillance lacrimas

258
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,708
floating all over the palace.

259
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,916
But so far, there's
been no sign of him.

260
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,500
If we see anyone
that looks creepy,

261
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,833
you'll be the
first to know!

262
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,750
Remember, you're at a party,
so try to act naturally.

263
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,875
What happened to the boys?

264
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,416
[WENDY] They're over there!

265
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,583
Looks like the
girls finally got here.

266
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,583
S'pose that means we
gotta start minglin'

267
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,458
and actin' like we
belong at a ball.

268
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,125
I'm pumped!

269
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,541
Balls are super manly!

270
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,208
C'mon, don't be
nervous, old buddy!

271
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,916
[ERZA] It's so glamorous.

272
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,041
I have to wonder if
Velveno will show up here

273
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,250
like the count's predicting.

274
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,833
[LUCY] All we can do
is investigate people

275
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,166
we find suspicious,
without being rude.

276
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,333
Whoa, I think a
red-headed angel

277
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,958
just walked
though the door!

278
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,208
You came way too far

279
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,291
from heaven to be frowning
like that, beautiful!

280
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,958
Dance with me and smile!

281
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,000
I don't think I've ever
seen anyone that suspicious

282
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,708
in my entire life!

283
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,291
[WARREN, telepathically]
Tail him, guys!

284
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,125
[NATSU, telepathically] Roger!

285
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,250
[ERZA] Very well.

286
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,333
[LUCY] That
poor, poor man.

287
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,541
[LUCY] Saw
that one comin'.

288
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,500
Tail that guy?

289
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,500
[MALE GUEST A] Whoa!

290
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:51,666
You've sent me
into circles baby!

291
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,041
I can't even see straight!

292
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:53,875
I've heard of a--

293
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,666
[ERZA] You lack the spirit!

294
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,291
I think she's got it.

295
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,416
He might need
help, though.

296
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,000
May I have this dance?

297
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,083
[LUCY] Yeah, sure!

298
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,791
Look, now Lucy's got
some guy talking to her!

299
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,208
Very suspicious, no
one's that handsome!

300
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,250
You guys know
what to do, right?

301
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,958
Let's go
check on Lucy.

302
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,916
Sure thing.

303
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,166
Oh, how could
I say no

304
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,833
to such a
handsome man?

305
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,000
You don't have
to be lonely

306
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,625
on the dance
floor tonight!

307
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:21,958
[NATSU] Gray, we're
being attacked!

308
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,250
[GRAY] I'd rather
be lonely, trust me!

309
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,333
I'm the
last man standing.

310
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,583
Is it too
forward of me

311
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:28,625
to ask you
to dance?

312
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,083
Oooh!

313
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,250
Yeah, I'll dance!

314
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,791
I'll dance like
a real man!

315
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,333
We are gonna set
this place on fire!

316
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,208
The fact that she's not
running away in terror

317
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,083
makes her super
suspicious!

318
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,750
If that woman truly is
Velveno he may be trying to

319
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:45,333
use his Magical Draining spell
to steal Elfman's Beast Arm!

320
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:48,708
Now Elfman may be

You make me dizzy!

[WARREN] Elfman!

325
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,250
You gotta switch out
with Gray right now!

What?

328
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,625
The world may try to get
between you and your woman,

329
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,458
but that just makes
the passion burn brighter.

330
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,583
It's the fire that
makes a man a man!

331
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,875
[NATSU] That's enough!

332
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,625
It's time to
switch partners.

333
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,000
My, what an enchanting

334

gentleman you are.

335
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,625
It's actually kind
of funny you would

336
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:36,583
put it that way, cause this
is a magic user's ball.

337
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,541
So what kind of
magic do you use?

338
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,000
That is a rather
personal question

339
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,416
don't you think?

340
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,875
A true gentleman would
reveal his type of magic first

341
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,250
before asking a lady.

342
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,625
Ha, I guess the whole
'being a gentleman' thing

343
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,541
ain't really my strong suit.

344
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,333
I see, well I suppose
I'll play along

excuse me!

The two of you need
to cool it immediately!

00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,875
And much to nobody's surprise,

364
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,791
this thing goes
completely off the rails.

365

Look, Miss Aceto's
up on the balcony.

366
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,416
It would appear that all
the men here are intimidated

00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,375
by my daughter's beauty.

is so manly!

big to ask you.

No way!

457
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,791
We've known each other
ever since we were both

just little kids.

459
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:06,791
And this entire time, I've
been crazy in love with you.

460
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,541
You were the low-born
child of one of my

461
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,500
servants, yet I still permitted
you to play with my daughter!

462
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,625
Have you forgotten
your place?

463
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,041
Every time I came to
see Aceto, you'd remind me.

464
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,458
You'd say we were
from two different worlds

465
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:18,916
that shouldn't mix.

466
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,958
And then, you'd kick me back
out into the street again.

467
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,833
'Cause trash like me
doesn't belong in your palace.

00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,291
You never told me
he tried to visit.

470
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,083
And you don't need to hear
about any of this now!

471
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,875
The sad thing is,
I started to believe him

472
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:34,041
and decided I was finally
gonna give up on you, Aceto.

473
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,791
I kinda gave up on
myself too, I drifted around

474
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,833
for a while, and eventually
turned to a life o' crime.

475
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,250
I got arrested.

476
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,250
Ended up in jail.

I'm not buyin' any
of this guy's crap.

Wait.

479
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,708
And while I was locked up.

480
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,625
I had all the time in
the world to sit around

481
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:54,208
and think about the thing that
I regretted most in my life.

482
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,708
How I never got the
chance to tell you how I felt.

483
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,166
So I took a risk and broke out
to come to the ball.

484
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,416
I even did it twice!

485

Miss Aceto, please
tell me you'll be my wife.

00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:17,666
How sweet.

487
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,125
What?

488
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:19,625
No.

489
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,000
Never mind.

490
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,416
[BALSAMICO] Can't you see
this is a waste of time?

491
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,041
Her answer is no!

492

Of course.

I've been waiting my whole life
for the day you'd come back!

[VELVENO] You were?

This is like my wildest
dream come true.

I can hardly
believe it!

500

There's just
one thing.

501
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:46,791
Turn yourself in.

502
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,041
You still need to
pay for your crimes.

503
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,708
You're right.

504

Yeah.

That was so freakin' manly!

00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,416
I don't know
about all this.

511
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,541
A round of applause
for the couple.

512
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,291
Well, they're
haulin' me off.

And I promise that
I'll come back for you.

517

So, about the four
million reward.

518
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:43,833
Do you think I'd
give you any money

519
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,083
after everything
that happened tonight?

Ooooh wow.

you'll have to roll me home.

Can we stay for just
a little while longer?
