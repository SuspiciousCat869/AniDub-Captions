one that brings
disaster and misfortune.

167
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,958
So everybody prays,
puts on their best behavior,

168
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,666
and tries to maintain
whatever righteous lifestyle

169
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,791
gets them through it.

170
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,958
August always brings
some kind of reckoning.

171
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:44,041
It's been thought of that
way for generations.

172
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:49,583
[clanking]

173
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,250
[WIZARD A] Hey! You mind
handing me that board?

174
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,041
[WIZARD B] We should let
Laki use her Wood Make Magic

175
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,333
to fix it quick!

176
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,625
[WIZARD C] No more
wrecking the place, Master!

177
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,250
[WIZARD D]
Seriously, act your age!

178
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,083
I apologize.

179
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,291
So what's the situation
out there, Warren?

180
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,583
Don't really know.

181
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,916
I think my radar is on
the fritz or something.

182
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,500
I hope it's not my fault.

183
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,125
No, doesn't seem
like it's damaged.

184
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,291
It's more like
someone out there is

185
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,541
purposefully jamming the signal.

186
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:20,416
That Jacob guy said his teammate
could mess with trackers.

187
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,291
I think he mentioned the
wizard's name was August, maybe?

188
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,041
You see, we have this
crafty old wizard

189
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,458
named August in our ranks.

190
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,333
He realized that our
movements were being watched,

191
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,666
so he had to go and
fix that, now didn't he?

192
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,000
That means August
is headed this way.

193
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:38,291
The man The Twelve call
"the Wizard King."

194
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,958
And he's coming here?

195
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,291
[MAX] So how do we send him
packin', First Master? Or, uh...

196
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,208
Is she just invisible,
or is she gone?

197
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,583
[ROMEO] I thought I
heard her say she was

198
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,208
going to the basement to heal.

199
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,125
[MAX]
Huh.

200
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,333
[WARREN]
Not so sure I understand

201
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,458
how a projection
can get hurt, but...

202
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,000
[MAX]
I dunno.

203
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,041
Wild.

204
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,458
I had no idea we
even had a basement.

205
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,958
It's been one of the guild's
biggest secrets for a while.

206
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,041
Because inside that
lacrima is my real body--

207
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,250
the everlasting magic,
Fairy Heart.

208
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,291
Which is what Zeref is after.

209
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,750
Yes.

210
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,416
[MAVIS]
Seeing the way Natsu and Lucy

211
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,125
fought against Jacob
earlier gave me an idea.

212
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:26,791
And I'm almost positive I know
how we can defeat Zeref.

213
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,333
[CANA]
Huh?

214
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:31,875
I can't go into much detail,
but it's absolutely crucial

215
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,791
that we free my real body
from that lacrima.

216
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,250
[CANA]
Hold on a second.

217
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,583
I mean, you're in
there, but, uh--

218
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,833
[MAVIS]
My body is theoretically alive,

219
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:46,041
which is likely thanks to
Precht's revival spells.

220
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,833
[CANA]
How do we get you out?

221
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,083
[MAVIS]
Fairy Glitter.

222
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,666
[CANA gasps]

223
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,208
You must use Fairy Glitter
to destroy my projection--

224
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,125
to eliminate this fake body.

225
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,458
[CANA gasps]

226
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,000
[MAVIS]
You see there?

227
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:05,333
When my projection was damaged
earlier, that crack appeared.

228
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,375
If my theory is correct,

229
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,916
eradicating my projection should
destroy the lacrima and free me.

230
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,250
What? Are you
serious about this?

231
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,958
You really want me
to attack you?

232
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,750
[MAVIS]
This is just an illusion.

233
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,625
You won't hurt me--in fact,
it's the opposite.

234
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,291
[CANA]
I can't! No!

235
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,750
It's way too risky!

236
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,666
If something were to happen
to the real you, I--

237
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,416
[MAVIS]
Cana.

238
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,958
You have to trust me.

239
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,625
This is the only way.

240
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,583
Don't forget our goal
is to beat Zeref.

241
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,625
[CANA gasps]

242
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,708
[PANTHERLILY]
There they are.


243
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,833
That's the enemy battalion.

244
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,375
We're pretty late for
our rendezvous

245
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,291
with Sabertooth
and Blue Pegasus.

246
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,375
I hope they're all right.

247
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,041
[LEVY]
They're coming this way!

248
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,458
What should we do?

249
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,375
[GAJEEL]
Whaddaya think? We fight 'em.

250
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,666
[LEVY] I dunno. Can we
take on that many?

251
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,708
[PANTHERLILY]
Don't worry.

252
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,875
The other guilds
should be close by.

253
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,333
If we gotta do it
alone, so be it.

254
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,875
These clowns ain't
marchin' on our guild.

255
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,500

ready to fight!

Your hearts are brimming

00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,625
[NEINHART chuckles]

325
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,375
[gasps]

326
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,750
You're here, too.

327
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,333
You thought our paths
would never cross again.

328
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,666
How wrong you were.

329
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,500
Trinity Raven's gone.
I saw you die!

330
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,375
[IKARUGA]
You merely released my soul.

331
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:20,791
[NEINHART] Ikaruga,
an exquisitely dangerous flower.

332
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,333
[KAGURA]
I can't die here with you!

333
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,416
[KAGURA]
Erza needs my help, immediately!

334
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:53,041
[KAGURA]
He's a murderer.

335
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,083
He killed my brother!

336
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,875
[ERZA grunting]

337
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:09,333
[ERZA groans, gasps]

338
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,583
You're not the warrior
I remember from years ago.

339
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,791
Perhaps the creep of time
has dulled your edge?

340
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,250
[ERZA gasps]

341
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,708
It must be her wounds.

342
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,750
The Erza I fought was
powerful and fierce.

343
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,166
Azuma!

344
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,041
Let's see.

345
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,166
Have you lost your strength?

346
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,125
Or are you just hiding it?

347
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,791
[ERZA grunts, gasps]

348
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,250
[ERZA gasps]

349
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:44,416
[ERZA gasps]

350
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,041
Bleve!

351
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,000
[ERZA screams]

352
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,708
[ERZA gasps]

353
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,416
[AZUMA grunts]

354
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,041
[ERZA yells]

355
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,041
Remember my Ramus Sica?

356
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,166
[IKARUGA]
Mugetsu Style.

357
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,375
Yasha-senku!

358
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,833
The more adversaries
a person has overcome,

359
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:15,500
the more splendid
their Historias.

360
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:19,333
This is my magic,
the Historia of Corpses.

361
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:22,500
With it, I can breathe new
life into battles of old.

362
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,083
Kyoka!

363
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,250
I see. So you've died, too?

364
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,125
Hush, Azuma.
I shan't discuss it.

365
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,708
[NEINHART]
These souls, that never had

366
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,166
the pleasure of
meeting before,

367
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,166
now interact as old friends.

368
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,041
Ahh, it's such a
marvelous thing.

369
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:43,500
Now, spread forth,
Historia of Corpses!

370
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:02,833
[KEYES]
Have the dead been revived?

371
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,833
Not quite.

372
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,541
This is not the same
as necromancer magic

373
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,750
that simply controls the dead.

374
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,291
[KEYES chuckles]

375
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,083
[KEYES]
How fascinating.

376
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:18,583
One's memories of powerful foes
they've faced are manifested,

377
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,666
returning for yet
another battle.

378
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,291
[ERZA yells, groans]

379
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,625
[IKARUGA] Surely you still
have the power to stand, Erza.

380
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:32,041
Get up. I wish to taste
your strength once more.

381
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:37,125
[NEINHART] Yes. What a
beautiful moment of creation.

382
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,791
Your hearts were
the fertile soil

383
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,375
from which my Historias
have sprung!

384
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:48,375
[KAGURA panting]

385
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,208
[sighs]

386
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,458
[ERZA yells]

387
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:03,916
[KAGURA]
Live!

388
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,916
[LUCY] Neinhart's Historias
enter the battlefield,

389
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,458
causing both physical
and emotional chaos.

390
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:47,250
Past adversaries emerge
one after another,

391
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:50,083
dragging everyone into
mortal confrontation.

392
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,208
Struggling against
three Historias,

393
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:54,416
Erza finds herself immobilized,

394
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,041
haunted by her memories
and wrapped within a prison

395
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:59,625
of her past pain and suffering.

396
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,750
Next time: "Mettle."

397
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,250
To overcome the past,

398
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:06,333
one must have the will
to live in the present.
