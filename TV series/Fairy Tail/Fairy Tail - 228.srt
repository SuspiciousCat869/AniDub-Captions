I'm guessing we're here.

Yes, and it took no time at all,
thanks to Sir Warrod's magic.

It beats walking,
that's for sure.

The Village of the Sun

All right! Chow time!

I really don't think you

[WARROD] These days my
allegiance is to nature.

Every retired man needs a hobby,

17
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,625
mine is turning
deserts into forests.

18
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,750
As you can imagine, I've
seen many peculiar things

19
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,125
traveling about the
deserts of this land.

20
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,333
Most recently, I came
across a village

21
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,625
hidden in the Mountains.

22
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,916
As it turned out, I had
read about this place before.

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,666
Known as the Village of
the Sun, its people worship

24
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,791
an ever-burning flame
as their guardian deity.

25
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,041
They've got a fire
that never goes out?

26
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,833
[WARROD]
They do.

27
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:14,375
But when I got there, the
whole place had frozen over.

28
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:15,833
[grunts]

29
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:19,041
[WARROD] Be it by nature,
or the folly of man.

30
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,750
Every person,
plant, and creature.

31
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:27,375
All the buildings too.
The river was solid ice.

32
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,041
Even the sacred flame
of the village was frozen,

33
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,125
though it burns on, even now.

34
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,250
It's possible to freeze a flame?

35
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh, that poor village.

36
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,041
I have no idea what happened
to the people there.

37
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,625
However, one thing
that was clear to me

38
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,541
is that they're still alive.

39

they were all frozen?

[CARLA]
None of this makes sense.

41

The people of that village
are in dire need of help.

42
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:54,375
They must be restored,
that is why I called on you.

43
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:58,041
Break the curse of ice.
That is your task.

I leave this task in your hands,

in this journey,

[GRAY grunts]

320
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:15,000
How do you like my Chain
Blade? Have another taste!

321
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,791
Total Thrust! Heads up!

322
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,250

[WENDY grunts]

[BOTH yelp]

327
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:33,875
A Sniper?

328
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:34,916
[HAPPY]
Where'd it come from?

329
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,208
I can't tell!

330
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:40,166
Heh. Aww. You're quicker
than I expected.

331
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,166
But, don't worry. The next shot
will find its mark for sure.

332
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,083
His voice is coming
from all over!

333
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,375
Where's he hiding?

334
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:49,958
My 74's been aching
to meet her kill quota.

335
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,541
[sniffing]

336
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,500
I smell gunpower.

337
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:56,375
[grunts]

338
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,208
[WENDY]
Lucy, he's up there!

339
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,708
[LUCY]
Good eye, Wendy!

340
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:03,125
I'll handle him.
Open, Gate of the Archer!

341
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:05,958
[bell tolls]

342

[horse whinnying]

344
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,458
Leave the sharpshooting
to me, my lady!

345
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,708
I'll teach this naïve
foal some manners!

346
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:15,791
Think so?

347
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,041
[LUCY whimpers]

348
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:23,958
No way!

349
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,041
What just happened?

350
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,791
Things got a lot harder.

351
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,333
Such skill.

352
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:32,916
Sorry. but once I've got you
in my sights, you're done for.

353
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:35,708
Tired?

354
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,416
Not on your life.

355
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,875
We've got a fight on our hands.

356
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,041
Okay, what do I see here?

357
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,791
[ERZA] They're all facing
the same direction

358
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,000
and their weapons are drawn.

359
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,541
But why?

360
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:27,208
What was happening in this
village before it was frozen?

361
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,583
It's puzzling.

362
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,833
[ERZA]
Then there's the Moon Drip.

363
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,833
There's no way to know
whether that meager amount

364
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,250
will be enough to
free everyone or not.

365
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:40,791
[gasps]

366
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,916
[ERZA] An army, weapons ready,
frozen by strange magic.

367
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:50,916
A warzone? And, if so,
what were they fighting?

368
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,958
Or, rather, what were
they all protecting?

369
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:04,833
Their families? A leader?
The village itself?

370
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,583
Or something intangible?

371
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:08,541
[gasps]

372
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,583
The Eternal Flame.

373
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:23,333
[ERZA] The flame is frozen, but
still active. How can I find it?

374
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,791
Pretend you're a giant.

375
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,875
You worship the eternal flame
as your guardian deity.

376
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,041
What would you do
if it were threatened?

377
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,333
[ERZA]
Of course!

378
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:35,000
I'd keep my back to it
and face the threat head on!

379
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,791
The flame is this way!

380
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:51,000
A mountain? The flame
must be at the summit!

381
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:02,291
Second round. Let's see
you deflect this one!

382
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,000

[RALA chuckles]

[grunts]

387
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,333
Ice Make.

388
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,750
Total Cut!

389
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:23,708
[HIROSHI yells]

390
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,833
All right. I'll play
another round with ya.

391
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:34,875
[WENDY, LUCY gasp]

392
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,166
[SAGITTARIUS]
On my honor as a spirit,

393
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,291
I shall not fail in this task!

394
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:44,791
[gasps]

395
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:51,708
[ERZA panting]

396
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,750
[ERZA]
Nothing. Nothing at all.

397
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,541
I thought if I could
find the Eternal Flame,

398
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,333
I might find a way
to return the village

399
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,208
and its people to normal.

400
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,875
Then again, it's supposed
to be frozen as well.

401
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:07,833
Even if I found it, I wouldn't
be able to get to it.

402
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:10,458
I can't give up.
It's here somewhere.

403
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,875
I just have to find it.

404
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,083
[ERZA gasps]

405
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,041
[ERZA]
What sort of madness is this?

406
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,541
[ERZA gasps]

407
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,125
It can't be. This has to
be some kind of illusion.

408
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:15,291
[LUCY] We've got another
mystery on our hands!

409
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:16,958
For some reason,
Erza has changed

410
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:19,333
into a child version of herself.

411
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,458
Why would that happen?
Did the Eternal Flame cause it?

412
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:25,291
Or is it part of
someone's sinister scheme?

413
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:28,916
And is there a way to turn her
into her full-grown self again?

414
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,500
On the other side
of this mystery,

415
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:33,833
a crisis like we've
never faced lies in wait.

416
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:36,791
Next time: "Art of Regression"!

417
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:40,375
Watch out, Natsu! I don't
think this guy's here to help.
