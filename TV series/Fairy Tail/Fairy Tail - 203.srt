You gotta put the balls

A rampaging bandit's
what she is.

187
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,416
Five days ago they rode
out and robbed a train.

188
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,708
But that wasn't near enough
to satisfy their greed.

'Cause they robbed a
bank the day after that!

I only feel safe in your arms!

00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,958
Seems fishy. If she
was staging robberies

of that caliber, I would've
heard about at least one.

Well she says she
did it, and I've never

196
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,291
been one for asking
deadly bandits questions!

197
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,708
[MAN 203A] It's not that we're
too afraid to stand up to her.

198

Lots of people have tried!

199
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,166
But She beat the tar
out of every one of them.

200
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,916
I still have
nightmares about it.

201
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,541
Nobody around here is
strong enough to take her on.

202
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:19,416
[MAN 203E] Just the sound of her
name can make me pee my pants.

If you can't handle this
bandit problem by yourselves,

204
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,666
then why haven't you
contacted Fairy Tail about it?

205
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,666
What a terrible idea!

206
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,958
She's a member of
that beastly guild!

207
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,750
If any of her
friends got involved,

208
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,416
they could wipe our
town right off the map!

209
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,666
Wouldn't be the first time
either, they're known for it!

210
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,541
Give a city job to
Fairy Tail wizards,

211
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,791
and they'll leave it in ruins.

212
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,208
Even the Magic Council's
afraid of those jerks.

213

As they get bigger
and more powerful,

they'll only destroy
even more stuff!

A small percentage of that
felt vaguely accurate.

judge us look at me!

[CARLA] Until I know
more about the game

461
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,375
than Happy, I'll refrain.

462
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,916
Well this takes me back.

463
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,333
Yes, that makes two of us.

464
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,833
[BOTH giggle]

465
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,625
[BISCA] You know, I've never
seen you play for real.

466
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:08,458
Ever tried?

467
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,666
[ERZA]
Once or twice.

468
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,416
[BISCA] Well, the last
time I saw you play,

469
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,958
your pool cue was a katana.

470
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,375
[ERZA]
Is that not how you play?

471
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:15,791
Guess I haven't after all.

472
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,041
[LUCY]
Hey! What cha talkin' about?

473
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,500
Not a whole lot.

474
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:23,458
We're just reminiscing about
how I met my family here.

475
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,333
Yes. I'm glad you found us.

476
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,833
[HAPPY] This bites,
it's been raining for days.

477
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,625
Geez guys, when do you
think it's going to stop?

478
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,708
[GRAY]
The hell it is!

479
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,166
Get your damp head away from me!

480
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,083
Not until you stop
dripping on my coat!

481
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,750
[ERZA] I'm sick of
this mindless feuding.

482
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,291
Play nice!

483
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,333
[NATSU]
But Gray started it this time!

484
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,416
[GRAY]
Are you lying or just stupid?

485
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,708
[NATSU, GRAY gasp]

486
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,208
[HAPPY]
There's someone at the door

487
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,416
[NATSU]
Who the heck is that?

488
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,083
[GRAY]
How would I know, man?

489
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,708
[ERZA] You came after all.
I've been waiting.

490
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,750
Hey, Erza. It's good to see you.

491
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,250
[BISCA]
I was wondering.

492
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,083
There anything around for a
girl and her partner to eat?

493
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,458
Yeah, of course. How's your
sickly friend been doing?

494
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:10,958
[SONNY squeaks]

495
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,416
[ERZA]
Oh, so this is Sonny.

496
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,250
His medicine's
expensive, I hear.

497
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,458
Yeah, it can be
hard to keep up with.

498
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:23,833
I'm penniless at the moment.

499
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,333
The Chef's name is Mira.

500
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,958
That stew is her
best dish, so dig in.

501
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,416
[BISCA]
Thank you.

502
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,375
Like it?

503
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,791
[BISCA]
It's really warm.

504
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,333
So you're a friend
of Erza's, huh?

505
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:38,250
Mira makes a pretty
tasty stew, am I right?

506
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,708
What is it? Is the food
not to your liking?

507
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,916
[BISCA] No, it's just,
I already owe you.

508
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,750
But could I have a job?

509
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:48,916
[ERZA]
Sure.

510
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,250
Hey, you should've
told us she's a wizard!

511
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,708
This changes everything!

512
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,708
I know we just met, but I'm
thinkin' we should fight!

513
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,708
There's no need for that.
I fought her myself.

514
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:57,666
[GRAY]
And she's walking?

515
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,583
[NATSU]
The girl's hardcore!

516
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,833
[BISCA]
Um. Thanks, but--

517
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:03,000
We'll get you one of these
once you're done eatin'!

518
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:06,250
This symbol we bear is no
mere decoration though, okay?

519
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:10,125
It's the sigil of a family.

520
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,041
[ERZA] Before that, you should
meet the guild-master.

521
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,250
[HAPPY]
C'mon, let's mark her up now!

522
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,125
[SONNY groans]

523
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:18,208
Up for a match?

524
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,375
[BISCA]
Just don't whip any swords out.

525
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:22,458
[ALZACK] Wait a minute.
I didn't know you played pool!

526
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,000
Just watch and learn, babe.

527
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,708
Closest lag shot breaks.

528
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:27,916
Square off, the game begins.

529
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,791
[WENDY] Wow! Both of them
look like they're pros!

530
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,250
[CARLA]
They do have excellent form!

531
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:36,250
[HAPPY] Put the balls
in the holes, alright?

532
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,083
[ASCA]
You're the coolest, Momma!

533
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,125
Let's do this.

534
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:40,750
All right.

535
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,208
[NATSU]
Lucy's wigging out, dude!

536
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:15,583
What's goin' on?

537
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:17,125
[HAPPY] Oh yeah, she wants
to throw some kind of

538
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:19,125
party for all those
celestial spirit people!

539
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,458
[NATSU]
A party?

540
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:22,083
[HAPPY] Yep. They had us
over to their place before

541
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,583
the Grand Magic Games, so it's
like the least that we could do.

542
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,375
[NATSU] Oh. Well when
you put it that way,

543
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:28,041
I guess we outta give
her a hand, right?

544
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:29,625
[HAPPY]
Well yeah.

545
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:32,083
But the thing is: I feel like
we're overdue for some trouble.

546
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:35,125
[NATSU, HAPPY] Next Time:
Full Effort Hospitality!

547
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:36,833
[NATSU] Hey!
What does this job have to do

548
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:38,041
with hosting a party?

549
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:40,166
[HAPPY] Ugh. I don't
know, man. I give up.
