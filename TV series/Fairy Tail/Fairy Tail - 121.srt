How many atrocities

But that's
impossible.

40
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,750
The keys you sought
were just stories concocted

41
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,333
by a group of
desperate fanatics.

42
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:44,375
Cultists who longed
for my resurrection

43

And you took
their fiction as gospel.

What a sad and horrific
legacy to leave behind.

45
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,500
I was never asleep,

46
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,041
so there was never
need for those keys.

I saw it myself!

00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,500
I watched you fall
with my Devil's Eye!

52
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,666
You were so weak you
couldn't hold your own

53
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,666
against one of
my underlings!

54
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,875
I'll explain this simply.

55
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:27,041
At the time,
that was my full power.

56
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,000
But no longer.

57
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,625
Long ago.

58
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:42,125
Four hundred years to be
exact, I witnessed countless

59
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:45,250
human conflicts and the
devastation they wrought.

60
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,291
But then.

61
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,166
One day, as if by a miracle
I learned the true value

62
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,083
and glory of life.

63
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,125
I gained peace and serenity.

64
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:58,750
However, since that fateful
day the more I valued life,

65
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,541
the more this cursed body
of mine would steal the souls

66
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,166
of those around me.

67
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,541
If I'm to stop
taking people's souls,

68
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:11,458
I must forget how to appreciate
the sanctity of human life.

69
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:14,583
This burden is
a wretched one indeed.

So you've been waiting
for something to force you

the value of life?

72

[ZEREF] Yes.

73
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,708
I was unable to use any of

I'm sorry.

109
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:17,583
I always intended to
tell you the truth someday.

110
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,833
I used to consider the
life we're currently living

111
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,083
our "first try."

112
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,083
And I thought that by
mastering Arc of Time

113
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,625
and reaching the
Grand Magic World.

114
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,958
I could bring about
our "second try."

115
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,208
I believed our
actions in this life had

116
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:36,375
no real meaning because we would
be able to start all over again.

117
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:39,458
This philosophy enabled
me to act in horrific ways

118
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,625
without remorse.

119
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,833
I honestly thought the
second time around would

120
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,750
be my true life
and yours as well.

121

A life full of
happiness and peace.

122
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,791
That's the reason
I did what I did.

123
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,416
I was so wrong.

124
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,125
I had no right to cause
so much suffering.

125
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,875
I was a fool!

126
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,583
A fool who committed countless
atrocities in the pursuit of a

happy was right in front of me.

128
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:25,750
And I know I can't
ask for your forgiveness

129
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:29,416
But at least
let me say I'm sorry.

00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,208
Oh god!

167
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,458
[ZEREF] Death is
too good for you.

168
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:17,083
May you suffer
in the afterlife.

169
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,416
It's here!

170
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,000
Acnologia!

171
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,333
[ALL] Is this
a freakin' joke!

172
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:40,916
Nope.

173
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,625
No joke.

174
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:43,833
Now deal with it!

175
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,291
After everything
that's happened I don't

176
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,166
have any other choice but
to cancel this year's trial.

177
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,125
[GRAY] But we can
still compete, c'mon!

178
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,041
[NATSU] Yeah, We've been
through worse so let us finish!

179
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,416
[GAJEEL] I ain't leavin'
this island 'til I'm S-Class!

180
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,041
[ELFMAN] Did the chicken
man scramble your brains

181
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:59,083
or did you just forget
you're not in the runnin'?

182
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,166
I don't want
to cancel it but try

183
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,833
puttin' yourself in my shoes.

184
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,166
First, a Council Member
manipulated our memories

185
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,416
and snuck in.

186
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,541
Then, Grimoire Heart
interrupted everything.

187
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:09,875
Yeah, When you
consider all that,

188
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,291
it really can't be helped.

189
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,458
Come on!

190
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,333
Are you gonna take
this crap lyin' down?

191
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,000
If your partner's
decided not to compete,

192
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,625
you should
respect her wishes.

193
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,500
Arrrgh. I wanted
to become S-Class.

194
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:21,208
Dang it!

195
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,458
Oh, Don't worry!

196
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,666
Next time you'll win it
for sure, my beloved!

197
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,083
I suppose a real man
knows when to call it quits.

198
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,875
Hey, what's with
all the whinin', huh?

199
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,166
You guys all sound like
a bunch of freakin' toddlers!

200
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,875
If you babies
wanna throw in the towel,

201
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,458
then that's fine by me!

202
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:38,208
Cuz that means I'm
the winner by default!

203
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,625
Go ahead and make me S-Class!

204
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,791
I'm the last one standin',
right? They forfeit!

205
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,208
[HAPPY] Natsu
blew a gasket.

206
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,416
Watch out.

207
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,500
Fine, then.

208
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,166
If the boy won't
listen to reason.

209
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,666
Alright, Natsu.

210
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,500
I'll make an exception and
let you take the final test.

211
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,708
If you can defeat me,

212
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,458
then I'll promote you
right here and now.

213
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,916
So let's do this thing!

214
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,125
You're lookin' at the
newest S-Class member!

215
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,166
I am not gonna
hold back, Gramps!

216
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,833
I'm all fired up now--

217
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,458
I was so close.

218
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,833
Why are you doing that?

219
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:19,708
You're real.

220
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,083
Well I'm glad
that's settled.

221
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,375
So, what's
death like?

222
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:23,291
I wasn't dead!

223
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,500
How rude!

224
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,041
You've had
your fun, Laxus,

225
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,416
now don't
pester the girl.

226
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,416
His perception
is much sharper.

227
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,916
He must've been
training hard.

228
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,291
We should 
learn from him.

229
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:32,916
So,

230
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,208
whattaya think?

231
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,958
[TOMMENS]
Learn from Laxus?

232
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,375
[LISANNA] I told you I'm real!

233
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,666
Stop pulling on my face
before I scratch your eyes out!

234
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,416
He seems like a
pretty decent guy

235
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,875
but I'm still scared of him.

236
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:43,583
Weird, huh?

237
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:44,458
What?

238
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,750
Oh don't be
silly, child.

239
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,000
He's fine!

240
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,916
Don't believe the rumors
you hear about Laxus.

241
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,666
Deep down, he is a decent guy.

242
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,875
Ya think so?

243
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:52,958
He's just...

244
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,625
a little bit of
a slacker, that's all.

245
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:58,916
Really?

246
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,250
I guess I should meet him and
see what he's like for myself.

247
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,333
This is supposed
to help, right?

248
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,541
The spring's herbs
are medicinal,

249
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,583
but knowing that sure doesn't it
make it sting any less, does it?

250
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:14,375
So, uh...

251
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,000
How's your arm
holdin' up?

252
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,708
Although I kinda liked
the way it looked when

253
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,333
it was full of Fairy Glitter,

254
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,041
it seems like the
spell wore off and everything

255
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,041
is back to normal again.

256
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,125
[CANA] Hey, Lucy.

257
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,250
I wanted to apologize.

258
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,583
For what?

259
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,833
You know.

260
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,625
for ditching you while I
looked for Mavis' grave,

261
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:34,916
for being selfish.

262
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,875
I'm sorry.

263
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,375
Oh, that doesn't
bother me!

264
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,541
But it bothers
me a lot.

265
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,958
I betrayed one of
my closest friends

266
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,000
and I'll regret it forever.

267
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,250
Well, I never thought
of it as a betrayal.

268
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,291
You were just doin' what
you had to, to win.

269
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,041
It's no biggie.

270
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm your partner and
I know how important

271
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,458
S-Class rank is to you.

272
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,583
So please don't
worry about it anymore.

273
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:56,833
'Kay?

274
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:09,250
[CANA] Even though I didn't
make S-class this year either.

275
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,500
I still need to bite the bullet
and tell my dad the truth.

276
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,291
Geez Natsu, try not to
look so excited over there.

277
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,333
Can't help it.

278
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,583
It's not my fault
this is so boring.

279
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,250
You just don't
appreciate it.

280
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,583
Fishing is part of a
man's spiritual journey!

281
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:27,833
[HAPPY] Oh, it's a journey.

282
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,666
Down my throat
and into my belly!

283
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,000
Eatin' the fish isn't
the important part!

284
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,458
It's the thrill of using
your hunting instincts.

285
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,041
The sense of becoming
one with Mother Nature!

286
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,875
The name of the game
out here is survival

287
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,208
of the fittest.

288
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,458
This is the playground
where men can feel alive!

289
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:45,333
[NATSU] Check it out!

290
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:45,958
I got a bite!

291
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:46,625
Way to go!

292
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:47,791
Now... pull it in.

293
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:48,958
Gently!

294
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,500
How's it goin guys?

295
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:52,875
Hold on a minute.

296
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,458
Natsu's about to discover
the true spirit of fishing.

297
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:56,750
So don't interrupt us!

298
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,458
I'm sorry Gildarts,
but Cana would like

299
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,291
to talk to you about something.

300
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,000
[LUCY] Put down the rod!

301
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,291
You boys are comin' with me!

302
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,791
[NATSU] But my journey!

303
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,708
[HAPPY] What about my dinner!

304
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,250
So, what's up?

305
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:23,916
Did you know that the
reason I joined the guild

306
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,083
was so I could find my father?

307
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,791
Actually, that's the
first I've heard of it.

308
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,166
Wait, you joined to find him?

309
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,708
You telling me your old man was
a member of Fairy Tail, too?

310
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,541
[CANA] Uh... yes.

311
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,291
Go, Cana.

312
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,458
Tell him!

313
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,583
What are you
two still doin' here?

314
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,083
His name is Gildarts.

315
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:15,458
[CANA] I tried to tell you but
things kept getting in the way.

316
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,250
So, what you're saying is...

317
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,541
You're my...

318
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,166
Yeah.

319
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,583
I guess it's hard
to believe, huh?

320
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,916
Wait!

321
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,875
Which one is your mother?

322
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:27,875
Sara?

323
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:28,875
Naomi?

324
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:29,875
Clara?

325
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,000
Fina.

326
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,625

[CANA] Sisters!

[GILDARTS softly]
You're Cornelia's daughter.

No doubt about it.

[CANA] Please let go.

355
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,541
[GILDARTS] Why did you
wait so long to tell me?

356
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,291
[CANA] Like I said,
things kept coming up.

357
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,583
Or maybe I was just
too afraid to tell you.

358
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,625
Your mother, Cornelia,
was the only woman

359
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,458
I ever truly loved.

360
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,708
Marrying her was the
happiest moment of my life.

361
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,291
She left me eighteen
years ago because

362
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,583
all I ever did was work.

363
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,625
It killed me.

364
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,291
When I heard of her passing,

365
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,041
it was like a
shot to the heart.

366
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,541
But a part of her
is still with me.

367
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm sorry.

368
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,416
I should have
realized long ago.

369
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,375
Don't worry.

370
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:04,416
I'm the one who tried to keep it
hidden all this time, remember?

371
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you sooner.

372
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,458
It's just nice to
finally have this weight

373

lifted off of my chest.

374
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,708
I've had a daughter
all this time and she was

Hey, now.

00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,916
There's no need for waterworks,

378
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,958
Gildarts, I don't expect
anything from you, okay?

379
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,708
You don't have to
treat me differently.

380
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,875
[CANA] But, if you don't mind,
may I say it just this once?

381
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,500
I'm glad I met you, Dad.

[GILDARTS] Baby!

I promise I'll never
make you feel sad again.

00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,041
I'll always be here for you.

I'll be right by your side.

It doesn't matter whether it's
on a job or hitting up the bars.

I'm not so sure you
can keep up with me.

389
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,166
All that I ask is that you
give me the opportunity

390
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,416
to be a loving father.

[LUCY] A loving father.

Maybe I should go see mine
again for old times' sake.

393
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:03,416
As I stood there,
bathed in the warm sunlight,

394
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,458
I thought, "What a perfect day!"
