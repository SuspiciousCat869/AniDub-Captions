00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,041
[BYRO] Dan... you
should come with us!!

159
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,416
I can't because there's
something I still need to do!

160
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,625
As a knight,
it's my duty...

161
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,333
So I'm willing to put
my life on the line.

162
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,666
[gasps]

163
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,750
[DAN] Listen, you! You're
in possession of something

164
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,833
that's not lawfully yours!

165
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,708
You may be stronger than
I am but I refuse to budge!

166
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,125
Not until it's returned
to its rightful owner!

167
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,416
[LUCY] Dan...

168
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,333
[MICHELLE] Who knew that
he could be so chivalrous?

169
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,250
[HAPPY] Uuuh... Not me.

170
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,333
[ANGEL] What a dimwit. Don't
you realize it's pointless?

171
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:50,625
[DAN] Are you even
listening... to... me?

172
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,791
I finally found my
Rose Line! Yeah, baby!

173
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,125
[ALL THREE]
What does that mean?!

174
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,583
[DAN] And what
may I call you?

175
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:59,375
The name's Angel... And I
hate overly-aggressive men.

176
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:00,541
[JACKPOT dings]
Lightning Bolt Bonus!

177
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,750
[MICHELLE] He sure
falls in love fast...

178
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:02,750
[HAPPY] Somethin'
tells me he doesn't have

179
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,833
a lot of experience.

180
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,583
Her love makes me
feel tingly all over!

181
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,416
Um, I think that has
more to do with

182
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,250
me electrocuting you.

183
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,291
[ANGEL] We're
obviously far too strong.

184
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,416
[COBRA] Yeah, you
can say that again.

185
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,291
[RACER] Fairy Tail
is weak. Very weak.

186
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:23,291
We should be
going now. Angel...

187
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,541
Take care of them.

188
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:28,791
As you wish, Brain.
The cost is thirty.

189
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,208
[HAPPY] You
remember her, right?!

190
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,000
She's a Celestial wizard!

191
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,416
Yeah I remember how
I beat her last time.

192
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,625
Amazing how things can
change in seven years.

193
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,375
I was but a child
when last we met.

194
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,041
[ANGEL] Now I am quite
literally an angel...

195
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,375
Surely you don't think
the Spirits will defy me.

196
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:51,416
I'll show you the power
and beauty of my Angel magic.

197
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,291
The very sight of it makes
people collapse to their knees,

198
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:58,541
lose all heart, and
give away their own lives.

199
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,083
Come forth from the
light, and in my name,

200
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,083
reveal your might!

201
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:06,208
O Angel that heralds
victory, Baraqiel!

202
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,750
I summon thee!

203
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:13,625
Protect our seal and
make this their tomb!

204
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,166
[MARY] Whoa, like,
what is that?

205
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,375
[SUGARBOY] Nooooo!
Looks like we got some

206
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,208
serious double trouble, baby!

207
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,916
[SAMUEL] This is terrible.
I had a bad feeling

208
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
this might happen.

209
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:38,208
[MARY] What do you mean?
Wait a minute...

210
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,958
Are you tryin' to say
this is what you like,

211
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,416
calculated? Spill it, cat.

212
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,541
No, my calculations
were wrong...

213
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,083
Which is rare for me.

214
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,291
I have a suspicion
that someone

215
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,208
manipulated them to be wrong.

216
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,791
Uh, sorry but this cat
ain't followin' you, man.

217
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,458
Yeah, you
wanna explain?

218
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,625
I'm shocked
you can't feel it...

219
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,875
The overwhelming presence
of evil in this place.

220
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,083
[MARY] And whatever it is,
Lord Byro and the others

221
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,875
are trapped down there with it!
We have to do something

222
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,291
to help them!

223
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:14,958
[GREEN FROG A]
The Oración Seis?!

224
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,291
That's impossible!

225
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,666
[YELLOW FROG A] I was
under the impression that

226
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,041
they had been incarcerated.

227
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,750
Yes, we all were.

228
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,000
May I ask... Was anyone
there to witness

229
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,000
their appearance?

230
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,416
[GREEN FROG A]
Well, actually...

231
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,291
[PINK FROG A] According
to reports the Fairy Tail guild

232
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,291
was there, too.

233
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,541
[gasps]

234
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,291
Not that reckless group
of troublemakers again.

235
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,083
[PINK FROG A] I know they
used to be troublesome, sir,

236
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,958
but from what I understand
they haven't caused us

237
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:39,500
any problems since their
new master has taken over.

238
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,875
Yes, that is true...
But their former master

239
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,208
Makarov has recently returned.

240
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,250
[shocked gasps]

241
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,625
[GRAN DOMA]
I'm aware of that...

242
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,625
And of course, he's brought all
the old problems back with him.

243
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,458
[soft chuckle]

244
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,875
What is it, Org? What
do you find so funny?

245
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,750
I'm simply amused
because this is just

246
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,875
what I would
expect from them.

247
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,875
[GRAN DOMA] Well,
it's no laughing matter.

248
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,916
[NADARU] The chief marshal of
the Custody Enforcement Unit

249
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,291
is here to see you.

250
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,208
Good. Go ahead and
send him in. Thank you.

251
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,583
[LAHAR] Chief Marshal
Lahar of the fourth

252
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,583
Custody Enforcement Unit
at your service.

253
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,291
[GRAN DOMA] We've
been expecting you...

254
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,625
Speak.

255
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,916
[LAHAR] Yes, sir...
I bring you important news.

256
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,708
I see... and Judging from

257
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:26,083
the troubled look you have...
it must have been the genuine

258
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:29,083
Oracion Seis who
appeared in the desert.

259
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,750
[LAHAR] Indeed... You have
a truly keen eye, Sir.

260
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,791
[ORG] So, it's true...

261
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,958
Though I'm ashamed
to admit it...

262
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:39,541
Four members of the Oracion
Seis: Midnight, Cobra, Angel,

263
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:43,458
and Racer escaped from
our custody some time ago.

264
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:46,666
But they weren't the only
ones, Erigor of Eisenwald

265
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,833
broke out as well and he has
since joined their ranks.

266
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,916
It was a security breach
like none we'd ever seen.

267
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,416
They had been replaced
with dolls which

268
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,208
I can only assume were
created with magic.

269
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,416
[alarms sound]

270
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,541
[GRAN DOMA] First him,
and now the Six Demons?

271
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,958
Personification magic...
But I thought casting spells

272
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,208
was banned within
the prison walls.

273
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:12,416
[LAHAR] I suspect they may
have had outside assistance.

274
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,666
[GRAN DOMA] Hmmm.

275
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,333
Do you know if anyone
came into contact with

276
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:18,541
the Oracion Seis during their
seven years of imprisonment?

277
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,083
[LAHAR] There was one
person in particular...

278
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:24,833
A priest sent from the
Grand Cathedral of Zentopia.

279
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,666
[LAHAR] I'm told he
visited regularly to hear

280
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,041
their confessions and facilitate
atonement for their sins.

281
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,916
[GRAN DOMA] Tell me more,
who is this priest?

282
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,708
[LAHAR] I don't know, sir...
We can find no record of him.

283
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,750
But that's impossible.

284
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,083
There may be no
records of this priest,

285
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,875
but there are multitudes of
surveillance lacrimas scattered

286
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,208
throughout the prison.

287
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,500
Surely one of them would
have picked up his image.

288
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,791
[LAHAR] Apparently, the
prison's surveillance lacrimas

289
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,458
were recently replaced.

290
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,541
Any that were active at
the time of his visits have

291
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,375
been sent for disposal.

292
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,541
[GRAN DOMA] We must
retrieve those lacrimas.

293
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:01,041
Track them down. We need
them to identify this man.

294
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:04,291
Perhaps we should consult
with Zentopian officials.

295
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,416
I'll make my way to
the cathedral at once, sir.

296
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,416
[GRAN DOMA] This priest is the
only lead we have right now...

297
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,625
Please do your best,
Chief Marshal.

298
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:13,875
[LAHAR] I will, sir.

299
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,208
[NATSU groans]

300
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:17,791
[gasps]

301
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,500
Maaaaan!

302
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,791
[screams]

303
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:23,916
You're up!
It's about time!

304
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,333
AHHHH!

305
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,416
What the--?! Where
in the heck are we?!

306

[HAPPY] The Blue
Pegasus guildhall.

307
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,500
[NATSU] Uh... Blue what now?!

308
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,375
Don't tell me that
you've forgotten...

309
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,666
my distinct and
pungent parfum.

310
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,625
You saved the
others too, right?

311
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:38,791
Where are they?

312
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,000
There's no need
to worry...

313
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,250
I rescued all
of your comrades!

314
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,166
They're relaxing and
thanking their lucky stars

315
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,250
that no one was
seriously hurt... Man!

316
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,375
[NATSU] Okaaaay...

317
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,625
[excited gasp]

318
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,166
Look at you all
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

319
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,541
[LUCY] You're up!

320
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,500
[GRAY] Geez, it took ya long
enough, Sleepin' Beauty!

321
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,291
[ERZA] Be sure to thank
Ichiya for his help.

322
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,500
[LUCY] For real!
Talk about incredible!

323
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:02,916
If he hadn't
swooped in when he did,

324
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,125
we'd be buried in
rubble right now.

325
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,541
[NATSU] Seriously?
Thanks a lot, man.

326
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,333
You don't have to
thank me, friend...

327
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,083
I know you would
do the same.

328
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,666
Fairy Tail has so
many handsome hunks!

329
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,500
The world would be a much
uglier place if we were

330
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,125
to let them
die in battle!

331
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,750
[nervous giggle]
Whatever you say...

332
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,291
Just thought you might
like to know that I cared

333
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,000
for you myself.

334
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,750
[GRAY, nervously]
Yeah, I bet you did...

335
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,708
He appreciates it,
Master Bob.

336
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,750
[HAPPY] He also slept
right by your side.

337
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:29,750
Yeah, I did!

338
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,333
So creepy!

339
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:32,333
[stone cracking]

340
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,375
So, where are your
glittery buddies?

341
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,708
[ICHIYA] Hibiki and the others
are currently traveling abroad

342
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,333
on another mission... Man.

343
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,916
[GRAY] Where's Lyon?

344
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,375
[ERZA] Ichiya was kind enough
to take him back to Lamia Scale.

345
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,416
[NATSU] And the Legion Platoon?

346
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,041
I'm afraid I didn't find
anyone else down there.

347
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,833
Those bastards.

348
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,625
What's the
matter, Natsu?

349
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,958
[NATSU] They may have beat us
in the first round...

350
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,458
but this fight ain't over yet.

351
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,458
We're gonna
thrash 'em next time!

352
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,000
[ICHIYA] I'm just as surprised
about the Oración Seis'

353
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,958
revival as you... I'll do
whatever I can to help.

354
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,541
[ERZA] We certainly
appreciate it.

355
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,541
Hey guys?
Where's Michelle?

356
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,625
[GRAY] She left a while ago.
Said she wanted to get

357
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,166
some fresh air.

358
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:21,500
[MICHELLE] It's my fault,
isn't it? After all...

359
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,375
I'm the one who brought
you the clock hand.

360
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,333
[LUCY] You did nothing wrong.

361
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:27,958
But that's why so
many of our friends

362
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,375
have gotten hurt...
and why our problems

363
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,333
keep getting
bigger and bigger.

364
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,541
Mmm-Mmm.

365
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,416
Look, you can't think
like that, Michelle.

366
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,208
You gotta
stay positive!

367
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,916
Focus on the good stuff.

368
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,916
If you hadn't
brought me that clock hand,

369
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,708
I never would've met you.

370
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,541
[LUCY] So stop beating
yourself up about it... Okay?

371
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,083
Yeah... I guess
you're right...

372
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:57,833
[MICHELLE] I love you...
Big Sister...

373
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:11,666
[MICHELLE sobs]

374
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,250
[LUCY] Dad... I wish
I knew why you entrusted

375
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,875
that clock hand to me...

376
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,583
I know there's a
message behind it

377
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,750
and "Key of the Starry
Heavens" but...

378
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:24,208
I can't figure out what
you're trying to tell me.

379
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:27,125
[BOOK GIRL] I told you...
don't do it...

380
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,208
[gasps]

381
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,416
[MICHELLE] What's the matter?

382
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,583
[LUCY] We should head back.
I have an idea...

383
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,500
But I need to re-read
"Key of the Starry Heavens"!

384
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:37,875
I think I've finally figured out

385
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,250
what's really going on.
I know what my dad

386
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,416
was trying to tell me!

387
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,875
[ALZACK] What's the
matter, pumpkin?

388
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,500
Why do you
hate this book?

389
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:49,083
[ASCA] I just do, okay?!
Because they got it all wrong!

390
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,625
Can't you see that, Daddy?!

391
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,875
[BISCA] Tell mommy and
daddy what you mean...

392
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,208
Why do you say
"they got it wrong?"

393
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,041
[ASCA] They did!
They're not supposed

394
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,458
to gather 'em together!

395
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:00,500
[BOTH gasp]

396
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,791
You mean the
pieces of the clock?!

397
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:07,541
Yeah, of course! It's all
written inside of that book!

398
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,125
[LUCY gasps]

399
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,875
Sorry, guys...
but I got it wrong...

400
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,000
[ERZA] Lucy, what are
you talking about?

401
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,958
[LUCY] I understand
now. It makes sense!

402
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,750
We weren't supposed to
gather the clock pieces!

403
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:21,833
[ERZA] We weren't?

404
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,458
[GRAY] What makes you say that?

405
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,833
I was wrong!
I re-read the book and

406
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,833
I think I've finally
figured out its message.

407
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:32,750
It was trying to warn us NOT
to assemble the Infinity Clock.

408
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,416
It seems so obvious...
I don't know

409
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,750
how in the heck
I missed it before.

410
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,000
That's not good...

411
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,125
We're in quite a
predicament, aren't we?

412
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,750
We did the opposite of
what we were supposed to?!

413
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,416
So all this time we
thought we were doin'

414
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,958
the right thing... we were
really just helpin' out

415
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,833
the Oración Seis?

416
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,875
I should have known...
That wasn't a premonition,

417
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,500
it was a warning.

418
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,000
[LUCY] I can't believe
I was so cocky.

419
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:03,000
I thought I had it
all figured out.

420
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:06,958
But I was wrong.
Sorry Dad...

421
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,875
Please forgive me.

422
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,250
I'm so sorry.

423
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,958
[ICHIYA] It sounds as though
your good intentions backfired.

424
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,583
[LUCY] That's
putting it lightly.

425
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:20,833
Something horrible is gonna
happen and it's... my fault.

426
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,958
Aw... c'mon...
if anyone's to blame

427
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,541
it's your dad 'cause he
made things complicated.

428
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,333
Yeah, no joke.
He was really beatin'

429
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,625
around the bush with all
of the anagrams and stuff.

430
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,750
How could he possibly expect
you to figure that out

431
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,000
on your own?

432
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,625
If he didn't want
you to gather 'em...

433
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,708
then he shoulda just
come out and told ya.

434
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,416
Unfortunately, some
people feel the need

435
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,833
to make things difficult.

436
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,541
I don't understand
people like that...

437
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,833
I like doin' things
the easy way.

438
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,875
Yeah, 'cause then you
have more time to play!

439
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:49,083
[NATSU laughs] And who
doesn't want that, right?

440
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,458
[soft laugh]

441
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:53,208
[WENDY] Aw, Lucy's smiling!
Are we cheering you up?

442
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,666
[LUCY] Yeah, I can't
help but smile when

443
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,458
everybody's acting so silly.

444
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,416
[NATSU] Well good, 'cause
there's no point in broodin'.

445
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,333
[CARLA] They say Fortune
comes to those who laugh."

446
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,666
[HAPPY] Ain't that the truth!

447
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,250
[LUCY] Are you actually
trying to cheer me up?

448
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,875
[NATSU] Don't go
gettin' used to it.

449
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,375
Natsu could use a
lesson in flirting.

450
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,916
What...?! Them's
fightin' words!

451
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,750
I'll take you
on right here!

452
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,875
[BOB] If you're gonna
fight, take it outside!

453
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,958
Besides, you silly boys
shouldn't be arguing

454
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,250
over little ol' me!

455
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:20,000
[BOTH] This has got
nothin' to do with you!

456
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,791
[LUCY] Guess some
things never change.

457
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,750
[ICHIYA] Everyone
fails at some point.

458
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,625
but you can always
set it right again.

459
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,666
Don't be sad.
Look around you,

460
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,375
you've got so many friends
who care about you...

461
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:35,500
and nothing can
ever change that.

462
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:38,541
It is their love...
that will help you get back

463
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,375
on your feet again.

464
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:41,791
Yeah...

465

[BYRO] Please let me
through, Your Eminence!

466
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:53,583
I beg of you... I must speak
with the archbishop immediately!

467
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,541
[LAPOINTE] I'm sorry,
Lord Byro, but I'm afraid

468
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,833
I cannot allow you to see him.

469
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,916
Only I, Lapointe,
am permitted to meet with

470
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,458
the archbishop at the
moment... Rest assured I will

471
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,000
pass on your message.

472

But we're running out
of time by the second!

The Infinity Clock has been
taken by the Oración Seis!

474
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,166
The archbishop must know--

475
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,375
[LAPOINTE] He is already well
aware of the situation...

476
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,916
There is no need
for you to panic.

477
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
[MARY] Wait, so he,
like, knows everything?

478

Ain't that a surprise!

479

I don't know
that I trust him...

[DAN] Hmmm...

I hate guys like him.

[SAMUEL] I've heard he's an
influential man from a local

parish whom the archbishop
handpicked to assist him.

485

However, that information
doesn't set me at ease.

486
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,916
[BYRO] Does he have anything
to say about the matter?

487
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,500
[LAPOINTE] Yes, in fact, he has
stated that he has a new task

488
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,458
for the Legion Platoon.

[NATSU] It's not a fish.
It's a clock.

think it's "infinite"?

[NATSU] Maybe it's a clock,
