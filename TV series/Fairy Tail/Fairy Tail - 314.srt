1
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,541
[NARRATOR] Irene Belserion
stands alongside August

2
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:25,083
as one of the Alvarez
Empire's mightiest.

3
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:29,916
It has also been revealed she
is Erza's biological mother.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,500
In her earlier life, she was
known as "Queen of the Dragons,"

5
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:38,166
as well as creator and first
user of Dragon Slayer magic.

6
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,166
However, the power she unlocked
with this new technique

7
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,666
caused her to transform
into a dragon.

8
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,041
[NARRATOR] Tortured and
desperate to free herself

9
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,208
from this new, monstrous body,

10
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:53,416
she attempted to enchant
her consciousness

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,291
into her unborn child,

12
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:58,625
with the hopes of gaining
a new chance at life.

13
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:02,666
Her plan ended in failure,
and the child was left behind.

14
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,916
And after being granted a
human appearance by Zeref,

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,083
she now works to
realize his ambition.

16
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,708
The estranged
mother and daughter

17
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:13,291
now face each other
on the battlefield.

18
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,833
Will Erza's hearfelt
determination be enough

19
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:19,708
to overcome Irene's
immense magic power?

20
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,916
[ERZA] You may technically
be my mother,

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,583
but Fairy Tail is my family.

22
00:02:56,666 --> 00:03:01,375
Anyone who stands between me
and my home will pay the price.

23
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,583
It's interesting.

24
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,875
I thought sharing
your birth story

25
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,208
would spark the smallest
bit of love for you.

26
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,583
Perhaps reawaken my
dormant maternal instinct.

27
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:12,833
But it didn't work.

28
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:16,166
All I feel for you is
hostility and disgust.

29
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,916
[ERZA yells]

30
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:29,000
I became a queen because of
my unparalleled magic power.

31
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,416
You still believe
you can defeat me?

32
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,166
My family gives me power.
You threw that away!

33
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,291
[gasps]

34
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,958
[WENDY]
Sky Dragon Wing Attack!

35
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,000
Crimson-Black... Twin Blades!

36
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,875
You actually broke my skin.

37
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,791
How dare you.

38
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:02,208
I'm sorry for what you
went through in your past.

39
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:06,708
But still, you turned your
back on your only child.

40
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,833
I can't forgive that!

41
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,666
[IRENE] Listen up,
little Dragon Slayer.

42
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,791
Do you remember the "Dragon
Seed" I mentioned earlier?

43
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:19,958
The thing that took over my body
and made me into a monster?

44
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:25,208
You have one. It's growing
inside you as we speak.

45
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes. I know that.

46
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,375
And I also know that my mother

47
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,708
stopped it from
growing years ago.

48
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,958
So you can't use it to scare me.

49
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,458
She what?

50
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:41,125
We won't turn into dragons.
We're not like you.

51
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,708
I suppose neither will Natsu.

52
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:48,458
[LUCY]
Come on! Wake up, please!

53
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,458
[HAPPY]
Just open your eyes!

54
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,958
Natsu. We need you!

55
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,833
[LUCY]
I'm really scared.

56
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,125
Don't you dare give up!

57
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:05,291
You need to keep calling
to him. Tell him you care.

58
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,833
Otherwise, his life may
slip away forever.

59
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,708
Natsu. Stay strong.

60
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:20,958
[HAPPY]
Natsu! Come back! Natsu!

61
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,500
[NATSU]
Wait.

62
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,333
Wendy? Gajeel?

63
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,750
Where'd you guys run off to?

64
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:35,666
[IGNEEL]
I have your answer.

65
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,041
A Dragon Seed.

66
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:43,208
That is what has been growing
inside of you, Natsu.

67
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:47,708
It is the curse all Dragon
Slayers are destined to bear.

68
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,250
The seed grows over time.

69
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:55,375
Eventually, it transforms
its carrier into a dragon.

70
00:05:55,458 --> 00:06:01,500
However, years ago, I halted
the growth of your seed.

71
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,291
It's really you.

72
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,166
[IGNEEL] The seed in
you should remain incapable

73
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,625
of growing any further.

74
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:09,750
[NATSU]
But did it only work

75
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:12,750
while your Dragon soul
was in me, too?

76
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:16,583
[IGNEEL] No. That's not
what's affecting you now.

77
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:21,958
You should know there is
another seed inside you.

78
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,875
You could call it
a "Demon Seed."

79
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:30,125
It makes you who you
truly are: E.N.D.

80
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:36,000
Those two seeds are getting
close to merging--becoming one.

81
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,708
That is the change
you've been feeling,

82
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:42,500
what's creating such
turmoil in you.

83
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,666
[NATSU]
And that's what's gonna kill me?

84
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,666
When they merge?

85
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,166
[IGNEEL]
Yes. You're going to die.

86
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,333
[IRENE]
I see.

87
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:01,791
The dragon that cared for
you entered your body

88
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,750
and halted the Dragon
Seed's growth.

89
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:08,208
The dragon who granted
me my magic, Belserion,

90
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,916
died right before my eyes.

91
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,750
So I took his name,
and swore on my own life

92
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,583
that I would avenge him.

93
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,000
All those centuries of pain,

94
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:24,041
and now... now I learn it
could've been prevented?

95
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,125
[growling]

96
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,291
It was all for nothing!

97
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,333
I will have my life
restored to me!

98
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,750
I'll leave this body,
and at last be free!

99
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,541
I can put you out
of your misery!

100
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,708
Wendy!

101
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,791
Ready!

102
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,583
All physical abilities up!

103
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,750
Deus Eques!

104
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,750
Very clever.

105
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:58,041
Separation Enchant Deus Zero!

106
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,791
I'll cancel your Deus Zero
with my own Deus Zero!

107
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:06,458
Really? This girl casts
high-level enchantments?

108
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,458
[yelling]

109
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,375
[chuckles]

110
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:14,166
It's over! This is the end!

111
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,458
[ERZA yells]

112
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:22,958
Now I understand.

113
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:28,083
At last... I know why the
enchantment on you failed.

114
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,916
[IRENE] I'd thought it was
because you were an infant,

115
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,500
or that our biological
connection got in the way.

116
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,375
Or perhaps the whole
concept was flawed,

117
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,125
and enchanting a
person's identity

118
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:43,708
onto another was
never truly possible.

119
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,958
The key is compatibility.

120
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,916
I've just realized
that's the only factor

121
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,500
that makes a difference.

122
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,375
[gasps]

123
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:54,250
[IRENE] And now I've found
someone who's compatible.

124
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,208
A Dragon Slayer
and an enchanter.

125
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,666
One with a youthful body

126
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,125
that will never succumb
to the dragonification.

127
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,291
[gasps]

128
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,458
Wendy!

129
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:15,583
Ahh. I've waited so
long for this day.

130
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:19,500
Her magic is a bit weaker,
but I suppose that's fine.

131
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,250
What did you say?

132
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:25,666
[WENDY] I will have a whole new
life thanks to this body.

133
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,375
Irene Belserion has been reborn.

134
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:33,458
I'll get used to this.
It shouldn't take much time.

135
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,375
No way!

136
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,041
[WENDY] My left thigh
is slightly injured,

137
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:42,833
and I seem to be covered
in scratches and bruises.

138
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:47,458
But I really can't
complain. It works.

139
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,416
What a petite little
thing. So cute!

140
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,458
[ERZA]
What happened to Wendy?

141
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:59,083
Pay her no mind. She's nothing
but a pile of flesh now.

142
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,041
What have you done with Wendy?

143
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,708
Oh, she's gone.

144
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:06,333
Or, rather, I suppose
you could say...

145
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,333
...she's here.

146
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,000
Stop this nonsense.

147
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:12,041
Get out of her
right this instant!

148
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,416
Are you really that
slow-witted, Erza?

149
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,708
This isn't a form of possession!

150
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,083
I have become this
Dragon Slayer.

151
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:24,500
Your dear mommy has
no use for you anymore.

152
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,541
Despicable!

153
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,666
[gasps]

154
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,166
[WENDY]
Hmm.

155
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,625
My magic power hasn't gone
down as much as I thought.

156
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:42,625
It seems this little girl is
a wellspring of potential.

157
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:46,833
I may be a child now,
but playtime is over.

158
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,166
And as you can plainly see,

159
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,291
I'm far too young to
be a mother to you.

160
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:54,250
I can't truly focus on
the new life ahead of me

161
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:58,333
until I've completely
erased your existence!

162
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:02,250
Sky Dragon Slayer magic,
huh? Let me try this out.

163
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:05,125
[laughing]

164
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,500
I think I like it!

165
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,583
[ERZA screams]

166
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,708
Please, Wendy! You have
to push her out!

167
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,666
[WENDY]
It's no use, Erza.

168
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,000
The girl you knew is dead.

169
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:24,208
Because as of today, I'm Wendy.

170
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,000
I am Wendy Belserion!

171
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:37,083
[ERZA]
You're just a parasite.

172
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,041
Hear me? You can't have her!

173
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:45,000
[ERZA yelling]

174
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:48,708
Are you sure, Erza?
Can you hurt your friend?

175
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:55,625
I know all too well the pain
of losing a loved one.

176
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,375
But with our help, you can heal.

177
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:05,541
Come with us.
Be part of Fairy Tail.

178
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,875
Thanks, Erza!

179
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:29,000
This time, I'll protect you
for all you've done for me.

180
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,125
You fool!

181
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,916
You're too soft to
survive this war.

182
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,041
[laughs] I've enchanted
your armor.

183
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,625
Explode!

184
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,791
[ERZA screams]

185
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,041
That barely even hurt me.

186
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,416
[gasps]

187
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:02,041
[IRENE] All attributes...
and resistances up.

188
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,083
Deus Corona.

189
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,916
[IRENE] Since we can both
perform enchantments,

190
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,416
I thought I'd try out your
body-switching trick, too.

191
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,583
Guess it worked.

192
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:20,541
It took a little while...
but here I am.

193
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:25,875
Erza, it's me. It's Wendy.

194
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,291
Wendy!

195
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,666
Impossible.

196
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,041
This is different. Heavy.

197
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,791
There's no way!

198
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,791
That little girl was
somehow able to pull off

199
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,541
a full personality enchantment?

200
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:43,583
I feel so strong. It's great.

201
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,166
I think I'm gonna use
this new power on you.

202
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,875
Teach you a lesson.

203
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,166
Now!

204
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,750
Erza! You should duck!

205
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,666
How?

206
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:04,458
My old body... used against me?

207
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,500
Separation Enchant.

208
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,333
[BOTH gasp]

209
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:11,833
[BOTH] You can try, but you
won't pull me out of here!

210
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,208
You're wrong.

211
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,916
You said yourself your
new body is weaker.

212
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,083
This girl. Who is she?

213
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,916
Now give it back.

214
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,041
Give back the old me.

215
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,250
This body does have
its advantages.

216
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,416
But I've lived my whole
life being small.

217
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,416
I want my old self back!

218
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,416
Damn you!

219
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,458
What is she--?

220
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,666
Do you still want to have
it back that badly, huh?

221
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,333
It took so long to
be human again!

222
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:47,208
You hear me? I won't
let you take it!

223
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,875
I'm proud of all my scars.

224
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,416
They're proof I've
fought for what I love.

225
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,250
And they remind me that
even though I suffered,

226
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,791
I still healed.

227
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:59,166
So go ahead and give me more,
they only make me stronger!

228
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,750
And that body...
remembers the warmth

229
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,750
of every friend
who's comforted me,

230
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,125
held me in their arms.

231
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,833
Wendy!

232
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:11,958
[growls] Damn you!

233
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,750
Erza?

234
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:34,375
Wendy! It's really you?

235
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,375
[WENDY]
Yeah. Hey.

236
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:40,375
If you don't mind,
can you handle the rest?

237
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,958
Sure.

238
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,708
I'll be happy to put
an end to all this.

239
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,500
You're just wretched
little girls.

240
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:08,041
[ERZA] Trust me, Wendy.
This will be over very soon.

241
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,000
You believe that?

242
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,750
You're in way over
your head, Erza.

243
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:23,000
I've been building up
my power for centuries!

244
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:59,458
All that time I protected you.
I held you inside my womb.

245
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:00,875
And from the moment
you were born,

246
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,500
you've been nothing but a
complete disappointment.

247
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,208
Why must you stand in
the way of my happiness?

248
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,500
I know you've
endured much misery!

249
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:13,083
But still! I won't
take pity on you!

250
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,708
What the hell do you
know about suffering?

251
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:18,125
About true misery?

252
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,125
After you abandoned me
in Rosemary village,

253
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,333
I was taken by a cult.

254
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,500
For years I was a slave.

255
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,041
They tried to take my humanity.

256
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,541
I realize it's not
400 years of pain,

257
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,958
but it affected me profoundly.

258
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,333
Changed me.

259
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:43,250
It's why I'm the
woman I am today!

260
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,916
Why I keep my heart open!

261
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,916
Why I was able to
find my true family.

262
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:53,708
With their love and care,
I could overcome my pain,

263
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,250
and begin to heal!

264
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,208
Enough of this nonsense.

265
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:01,416
Your whole existence is
nothing more than a mistake.

266
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,875
I never should've had you!

267
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,125
So now I'll have to kill you!

268
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,458
It's the only way!

269
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,708
[yelling]

270
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,291
No.

271
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,666
[cries]

272
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,500
A-A dragon?

273
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,125
[ERZA gasps]

274
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,416
[screams]

275
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,375
[ERZA]
That was just one hit.

276
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,750
I feel like my bones
are shattered.

277
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,208
[gasps]

278
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,250
[screaming]

279
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:10,416
Let's see you move now.

280
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,750
[IRENE] As a Sage Dragon,
my power has been amplified

281
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,250
well beyond your imagination.

282
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,708
I possess the supreme form
of enchantment magic:

283
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,791
Master Enchant.

284
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,083
[IRENE] This power
transcends the terrestrial.

285
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,958
The land, the sky, the sea,
everything of this world.

286
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,833
It affects the heavenly bodies.

287
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:46,500
[ERZA]
No... I can't move.

288
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:50,291
[IRENE] Now, Erza, prepare
to be obliterated.

289
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,875
I'll turn you into dust!

290
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,625
Deus Sema!

291
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,583
No. Is she truly that powerful?

292
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,125
[ERZA] Jellal uses a
version of this spell.

293
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,833
But this is
exponentially stronger.

294
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,125
There's no way I'll survive it.

295
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:34,500
What's worse,
it won't only kill me.

296
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,541
Thousands of people
could be wiped out.

297
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:38,958
Do you see that?

298
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,250
A shooting star?

299
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,416
It's comin' right at us!

300
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,083
[ERZA]
Damn it! I can't just lie here.

301
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:48,416
I have to move. Come on!

302
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,750
[IRENE] It's over, Erza!
This is how you die!

303
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,875
[laughs]

304
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,958
[ERZA]
I can still move my right arm.

305
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,708
[ERZA]
It's all or nothing!

306
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,500
[gasps]

307
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:11,208
[yelling]

308
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,916
[IRENE] Are you flying
straight into the meteor?

309
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,458
You're speeding up
the inevitable!

310
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,958
[ERZA yelling]

311
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,875
[IRENE] It's pointless!
You can't stop it!

312
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,166
You're just a human!

313
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:29,416
At some point in time, people
started calling me Titania,

314
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,083
the named shared by a
legendary Fairy Queen.

315
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,083
Honestly, I've never
given that much thought

316
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,625
to what people chose to call me.

317
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,291
But if you're the Queen
of the Dragons...

318
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:46,208
...then I'll take the name
Titania with pride.

319
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:49,833
A queen who cherishes her
people and protects them.

320
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,458
I'll do all I can to
help those in need,

321
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,875
even if it ends up
destroying me!

322
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:59,083
Lend me your strength,
Master! Please!

323
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:04,750
My daughter...
is she even human?

324
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,875
[LUCY]
Irene unleashes Deus Sema,

325
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:42,041
a powerful spell that
can control objects

326
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,708
that are not of this world.

327
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:45,083
With only one arm,

328
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:47,208
Erza attacks the meteor
hurtling towards the ground,

329
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:49,583
risking her life to
save countless others.

330
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:50,708
While the Queen of the Dragons

331
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:52,583
brings about violence
and hatred,

332
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:54,958
Titania shares her
love with everyone.

333
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:56,916
The end of this intense
battle between mother

334
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,916
and the daughter she left
behind is drawing near.

335
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,791
Next Time: "Dragon or Demon."

336
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:06,666
A warm smile will bring new
life to a dying memory.
