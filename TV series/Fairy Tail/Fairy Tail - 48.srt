1
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,916
- HEY, GUYS.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,541
READY FOR SOME
MORE "FAIRY TAIL"?

3
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,375
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING,

4
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,875
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE ROOM

5
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,916
AND DON'T SIT
TOO CLOSE TO THE TV.

6
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,041
- ( laughing )

7
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:43,208
I'VE FINALLY SURPASSED
THE OLD MAN.

8
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,500
- ( theme song playing )

9
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,958
- ( singing in Japanese )

10
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:17,250
- ( coughing )

11
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,291
- ( coughs )

12
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,541
- WHAT THE-- NO WAY.

13
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:24,833
IMPOSSIBLE.

14
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,583
HOW IN THE HELL
ARE YOU ALL STILL ALIVE?

15
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,083
- ( All speaking )

16
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,125
- ( groans )

17
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,041
- LEVY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

18
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,708
- BUT WHAT ABOUT NATSU?

19
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,250
IS HE OKAY?

20
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:45,208
 - ( pants )
- LOOKS JUST FINE TO ME.

21
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,791
- I HIT THEM WITH
SO MUCH MAGIC ENERGY.

22
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,458
- Fried: THE OTHER GUILD MEMBERS

23
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:53,000
AND THE CITIZENS OF MAGNOLIA
REMAIN UNHARMED.

24
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,875
- Laxus: FRIED.

25
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,708
- LOOKS LIKE YOUR
SPELL DIDN'T WORK.

26
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,833
NOT A SINGLE PERSON
WAS KILLED.

27
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,583
- BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

28
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,000
I CAST THE FAIRY LAW SPELL
PERFECTLY.

29
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,833
- MAYBE SO, BUT YOU'RE TRUE
FEELINGS HAVE BETRAYED YOU.

30
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:09,458
YOU'VE INHERITED MORE THAN
STRENGTH FROM YOUR GRANDFATHER.

31
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,791
DEEP DOWN, YOU ALSO HAVE
THE MASTER'S HEART.

32
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,708
WHETHER YOU'D
ADMIT IT OR NOT,

33
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,916
IT'S EVIDENT THAT YOU CARE
FOR YOUR COMRADES.

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,791
THE FAIRY LAW SPELL
ONLY AFFECTS THOSE 

35
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,416
THE CASTER SEES
AS THEIR ENEMY.

36
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,791
SINCE NO ONE WAS HURT,
WE KNOW HOW YOU TRULY FEEL.

37
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,291
- HIS MAGIC COULD
SEE INTO HIS HEART.

38
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,083
AND THAT'S WHY
WE'RE STILL HERE.

39
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:30,125
- YOU CAN TRY TO HIDE
YOUR FEELINGS, LAXUS,

40
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:33,125
BUT YOUR MAGIC WILL
ALWAYS REVEAL THE TRUTH

41
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,500
WITHIN YOUR HEART.

42
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,500
- NO, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

43
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,541
THE TRUTH IS ANYONE WHO WOULD
EVER DARE STAND IN MY WAY 

44
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:40,708
IS MY ENEMY!

45
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,166
- THIS HAS GONE
ON LONG ENOUGH.

46
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,625
YOU NEED TO GO SEE THE MASTER
BEFORE HE'S GONE.

47
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:46,916
- ( grunts )

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,708
LET THE OLD MAN DIE
FOR ALL I CARE.

49
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,708
HE'S NOTHING TO ME.

50
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,458
HE MAY BE FAMILY,

51
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:56,250
BUT I'M STRONGER!

52
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,875
- SUCH POWER.

53
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,000
- WHO DO YOU
THINK YOU ARE?

54
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,625
YOU'RE NOT
STRONGER THAN GRAMPS.

55
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,666
YOU COULDN'T EVEN
PULL OFF FAIRY LAW.

56
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,333
YOU MAY BE HIS GRANDSON,

57
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,333
BUT YOU'RE NO BETTER
THAN THE REST OF US.

58
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,041
DON'T YOU KNOW BLOOD TIES
DON'T MATTER?

59
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,541
'CAUSE EVERYONE IN THE GUILD

60
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,666
IS SUPPOSED TO
BE CONSIDERED FAMILY.

61
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,625
- THAT'S JUST A LIE. 
BLOOD TIES DO MATTER.

62
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,333
- YOU'VE BEEN
A MEMBER LONG ENOUGH

63
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,833
TO KNOW BETTER THAN THAT.

64
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,125
IF YOU THINK THAT MAKES YOU

65
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,625
ABOVE EVERYONE ELSE
IN THE GUILD,

66
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,583
YOU'RE WRONG!

67
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,416
- AND YOU'RE DEAD!

68
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,458
HOW DARE YOU CHALLENGE ME!

69
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,083
- I'M GONNA STOP YOU, LAXUS.

70
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,500
I WON'T LET YOU GET
YOUR HANDS ON FAIRY TAIL.

71
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,500
IT'S OUR HOME!
THERE'S NO WAY

72
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,125
I'M GONNA LET YOU DESTROY IT.

73
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,166
- WHY WON'T YOU JUST DIE?!

74
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,333
- FACE IT ALREADY.
IT'S OVER.

75
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,791
- NATSU!

76
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:18,250
- Natsu: WHY WON'T YOU 
JUST GIVE UP THE FIGHT?

77
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,250
IT JUST DOESN'T
BELONG TO YOU. 

78
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,125
IT NEVER WILL!

79
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,208
- OH YEAH?!

80
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,708
LIGHTNING DRAGON!

81
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,250
DEMOLITION FIST!

82
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:37,250
DIDN'T THE OLD MAN
EVER TEACH YOU

83
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,541
TO RESPECT YOUR ELDERS, BOY?

84
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,833
- NO WAY.
HE CAN STILL FIGHT?

85
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:50,083
- NATSU, PLEASE
BE CAREFUL.

86
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,625
- THAT WAS YOUR
LAST MISTAKE, KID.

87
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,416
NOW I'M GONNA
OBLITERATE YOU!

88
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,166
- THAT SPELL, DON'T DO IT!

89
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,291
THAT MUCH MAGIC ENERGY
COULD KILL HIM!

90
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,125
- ( laughs )

91
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,833
- LIGHTNING DRAGON!

92
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,833
HEAVENWARD HALBERD!

93
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,833
- NATSU!
- ( cries )

94
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:26,208
- GAJEEL!
- WHAT THE-- WHAT HAPPENED?

95
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:29,041
DID HE USE HIMSELF 
AS A LIGHTNING ROD?

96
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,916
- GET HIM!

97
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,416
- ( grunts )

98
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,125
-  DAMN.
HE'S STILL ALIVE.

99
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,000
FIRE DRAGON...

100
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,666
- ( roars )

101
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:48,083
- IRON FIST!
TALON!

102
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,416
WING ATTACK!

103
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,916
SWORD HORN!

104
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,291
FLAME ELBOW!

105
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,458
- HE REALLY IS AMAZING.

106
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,791
HIS MAGIC IS SO POWERFUL.

107
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,041
IT'S ALMOST LIKE IT CAN BREAK
THROUGH A DRAGON'S SCALES

108
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:02,333
AND SHATTER IT'S SPIRIT.
- DRAGON SLAYER SECRET ARTS.

109
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:06,458
- FLAME LOTUS!
EXPLODING FLAME BLADE!

110
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:09,291
- ( grunts, groans )

111
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,208
( screams )

112
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,375
- Fried: HE DID IT.

113
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,333
HE BEAT LAXUS.

114
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,500
- ( roars )

115
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,958
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HERE, GRANDINE?

116
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,750
- PAYING A VISIT
TO AN OLD FRIEND.

117
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:55,125
- MIGHT I REMIND YOU
YOU'RE FORBIDDEN TO COME HERE?

118
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,875
DO NOT INTERFERE.

119
00:07:56,958 --> 00:08:00,333
- I SHOULD TELL YOU THAT
THE CHILD IS BEING RECKLESS.

120
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,833
HE REMINDS ME
OF SOMEONE ELSE I KNOW.

121
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,583
HIS STREAK OF GOOD LUCK

122
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,833
IS SURE TO RUN OUT EVENTUALLY.

123
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:07,875
IN WHICH CASE,

124
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,625
HE COULD END UP DEAD.

125
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:11,833
- BE GONE!

126
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,791
YOU ARE NOT TO MEDDLE

127
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:14,833
IN THE HUMAN'S AFFAIRS!

128
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,958
DO SO AND YOU WILL ANGER ME,

129
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,750
THE MIGHTY IGNEEL!

130
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,625
- I NEVER SHOULD
HAVE MENTIONED IT.

131
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,500
THERE'S NO POINT IN WORRYING

132
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,375
WHEN WE CAN'T
CHANGE THE OUTCOME.

133
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,791
ALL WE CAN DO IS HAVE FAITH
THAT THE HUMANS

134
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,666
HAVE THE STRENGTH TO PREVAIL.

135
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:36,291
YOU KNOW, ZEREF IS--
NEVER MIND.

136
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:39,416
I'VE SAID ENOUGH.
- ( townspeople chatter )

137
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,833
- Man #1: AWW MAN, 
THE FANTASIA PARADE

138
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,208
WON'T HAPPEN
UNTIL TOMORROW NIGHT.

139
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,791
- Woman #1:
YEAH, I HEARD IT'S CAUSE

140
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,708
THE MASTER IS SICK.
- Man #2: IS HE GOING TO RETIRE?

141
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,666
- Woman #2: WHOA, WHO DO YOU
THINK THE NEXT MASTER WILL BE?

142
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,541
- Man #3: WELL, LAXUS
WOULD MAKE THE MOST SENSE.

143
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,166
- Man #4: BUT HE'S SUCH A JERK.
- Man #5: YEAH.

144
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,833
I REALLY HOPE
THEY DON'T PUT HIM IN CHARGE.

145
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,625
- Man #5: I'VE KNOWN HIM SINCE
HE WAS JUST A BOY.

146
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,333
AND NOW HE MIGHT BE
THE NEW MASTER.

147
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,958
IF I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE
AN OLD MAN BEFORE,

148
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,500
I SURE DO NOW.

149
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,333
- Erza: THANKS TO 
PORLYUSICA'S HELP,

150
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,958
THE MASTER'S GOING TO
PULL THROUGH JUST FINE.

151
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,958
SO DON'T WORRY.  HE'LL BE
BACK TO WORK IN NO TIME. 

152
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,500
- ( cheering )

153
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,041
- THANK GOODNESS.

154
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,083
I GOT TO ADMIT I WAS GETTING
A LITTLE WORRIED.

155
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,750
- AH, COME ON,
IT'LL TAKE MORE THAN THAT

156
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,875
TO MAKE GRAMPS
KICK THE BUCKET.

157
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,000
WELL, HE ISN'T AS YOUNG
AS HE USED TO BE.

158
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,958
SO ANY ADDED STRESS
TO HIS HEART

159
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,833
COULD SIGNIFICANTLY
AFFECT HIS HEALTH. 

160
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:27,166
LET'S BE ON OUR
BEST BEHAVIOR, OKAY?

161
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,833
- All: AYE, SIR!

162
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,333
- I DON'T KNOW IF
IT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA

163
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,583
TO DO THE FANTASIA PARADE

164
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,250
AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED.

165
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,000
- BUT THE MASTER
WANTS US TO DO IT.

166
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,958
BESIDES, IT'S THE PERFECT WAY
TO CHEER EVERYONE UP

167
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,625
AFTER ALL THAT MESS.

168
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,666
- I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
WHAT YOU ALL HAVE IN STORE

169
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,625
FOR THE PARADE.
- YEAH?

170
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,083
- YOU'RE GONNA BE IN IT WITH US,
LITTLE LADY.

171
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,041
- ( gasps )
- YOU'RE A MEMBER, RIGHT?

172
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,458
- WELL, YEAH, I AM,
BUT I'M SO NEW,

173
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,041
I DIDN'T THINK
I'D BE IN THE PARADE.

174
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,791
- I WAS EXPECTING A LITTLE MORE
EXCITEMENT FROM HER.

175
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,541
- SHE LOOKS UPSET.
- ISN'T SHE THE CUTEST?

176
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:59,458
- A LOT OF MEMBERS WERE INJURED
FIGHTING AGAINST EACH OTHER.

177
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,791
SO ANYONE WHO'S NOT HURT
HAS TO PARTICIPATE.

178
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,541
- DOES THAT MEAN
I'M GONNA BE IN IT TOO?

179
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,250
- WELL, YEAH, WE NEED
ALL THE PEOPLE WE CAN GET.

180
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,125
ESPECIALLY SINCE WE'RE NOT
GONNA BE ABLE TO USE THOSE TWO.

181
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,250
- OH YEAH.

182
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:13,083
- SCREW YOU
AND YOUR PARADE.

183
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,500
- ( muffled response )

184
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,500
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT HE JUST SAID?

185
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,041
- KNOWING HIM, IT WAS
PROBABLY SOMETHING STUPID.

186
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,916
- COME ON, HOW'RE YOU GONNA
BE PART OF THE ACTION?

187
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,083
YOU'RE OUT.
- ( muffled response )

188
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,958
- THAT'S GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT, BRO. 

189
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,541
WHAT THE HECK
IS YOUR PROBLEM?!

190
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,708
- I WONDER HOW GAJEEL
CAN UNDERSTAND HIM.

191
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,416
- WELL, IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE
HE'S JUST AS STUPID AS NATSU IS.

192
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,208
- Lucy: THAT WAS HARSH.
YOU'VE GOT A SERIOUS

193
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,875
MEAN STREAK IN YOU, CAT.
- ( giggles )

194
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,625
- Erza: IT'S GOOD TO SEE
EVERYONE GETTING ALONG AGAIN.

195
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:44,666
ESPECIALLY AFTER WE WERE FORCED
TO FIGHT AGAINST ONE ANOTHER.

196
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,583
- ( footsteps approach )

197
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,333
- ( gasping )

198
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,333
- Macao: LAXUS.
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

199
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,750
- WHERE'S THE OLD MAN?

200
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,333
- WE AIN'T TELLING.
- YOU THINK YOU CAN

201
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,250
JUST WALTZ IN HERE AND
ASK TO SEE THE MASTER?

202
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,500
- ( shouting )
- YEAH, GET OUT OF HERE.

203
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,666
- GET OUT OF HERE.
- ( shouting )

204
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,208
- GUYS, STOP IT.

205
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,666
- QUIET, EVERYONE.

206
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,000
- Levy: ERZA.

207
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,708
- THE MASTER'S IN THE INFIRMARY.

208
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,583
- ARE YOU NUTS?

209
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,416
- ( whispering )

210
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,041
- ( muffled speech )

211
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,000
- NATSU.

212
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:36,291
- ( muffled speech )

213
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,583
( muffled speech continues )

214
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,708
( panting )

215
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,833
- WHAT'D HE SAY?

216
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,458
- CAN YOU INTERPRET PLEASE?

217
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,916
- HE SAID, "NEXT TIME,

218
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,541
IT AIN'T GONNA
BE TWO AGAINST ONE.

219
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,208
I'LL JUST BE ME AND YOU
FACE-TO-FACE.

220
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,250
AND I SWEAR I AIN'T
GONNA LOSE TO YOU AGAIN."

221
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,291
OR SOMETHING.

222
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,583
- Lucy: WAIT A SECOND.

223
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,416
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS BEAT HIM.

224
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,625
- Gajeel: NO, I'D SAY
IT WAS MORE LIKE A DRAW.

225
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,041
- HUH?

226
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,833
- LOOK WHAT HE DID TO US.

227
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,208
IF HE HAD BEEN AROUND DURING
THE PHANTOM BATTLE,

228
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,666
I'D BE SIX FEET UNDER RIGHT NOW.
- ( muffled grumbles )

229
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,041
( muffled speech )

230
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,833
( shaky breath )

231
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,916
( sighs )

232
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,083
- Erza: SHOW'S OVER, GUYS.

233
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,958
LET'S GET READY
FOR THE FANTASIA PARADE.

234
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,458
- ( cheering )

235
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,625
( chattering )

236
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,416
( distant cheers )

237
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,375
- THEY'RE A ROWDY BUNCH,
AREN'T THEY?

238
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:44,916
- LAXUS.

239
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,375
I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND

240
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,333
THE SERIOUSNESS
OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE.

241
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,333
LOOK ME IN THE EYES,
YOUNG MAN.

242
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,333
FAIRY TAIL IS A PLACE...

243
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,125
WHERE FRIENDS CAN GATHER,

244
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,208
WIZARDS CAN FIND WORK,

245
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,250
AND CHILDREN WHO HAVE
NO KIN TO CALL THEIR OWN

246
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,541
CAN FEEL LIKE THEY'RE
PART OF A FAMILY.

247
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:09,708
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
THAT CAN BE OWNED.

248
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,375
IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT EACH MEMBER

249
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,916
NOT ONLY BE LOYAL,
BUT ALSO TRUSTWORTHY.

250
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,875
OTHERWISE, NO BONDS
WILL BE FORMED

251
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,041
AND THE ENTIRE GUILD
WILL EVENTUALLY FALL APART.

252
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,416
YOUR ACTIONS HAVE PROVEN

253
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,833
THAT YOU LACK BOTH
OF THOSE QUALITIES.

254
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,208
AND YOU THREATENED
THE LIVES OF YOUR COMRADES.

255
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:29,333
THAT'S UNFORGIVABLE.
- I'M SORRY, SIR.

256
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,958
HONESTLY, I NEVER MEANT
TO HURT THE GUILD.

257
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,458
I JUST WANTED TO 
MAKE IT STRONGER.

258
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,625
- ( sighs )
I SWEAR,

259
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,958
YOU'RE JUST AS
HIGH-STRUNG AS I AM.

260
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,791
YOU'D BETTER TRY TO RELAX

261
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,750
OR YOU'LL END UP
IN HERE WITH ME.

262
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,958
TAKE SOME TIME
TO SMELL THE ROSES.

263
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,041
IF YOU DO, YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO SEE THINGS

264
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,875
YOU COULDN'T SEE BEFORE.

265
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,416
AND YOU'LL HEAR THINGS
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO HEAR.

266
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,750
LIFE CAN BE A LOT OF FUN
IF YOU ALLOW IT TO BE.

267
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,625
OVER THE YEARS,

268
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,958
I HAVE WATCHED YOU GROW
INTO THE MAN THAT YOU ARE TODAY.

269
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:16,208
WHERE DID WE GO WRONG?
WHAT LESSON DID YOU NOT LEARN?

270
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,375
BUT THE PAST IS THE PAST.

271
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,333
I AM LEFT NOW
WITH ONLY ONE CHOICE.

272
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,916
LAXUS...

273
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:36,791
YOU ARE HEREBY EXPELLED
FROM FAIRY TAIL.

274
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,666
- I UNDERSTAND.

275
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,041
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING...

276
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,291
GRANDPA.

277
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,291
- ( sniffles )

278
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:55,291
- YOU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,
OKAY, OLD MAN.

279
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:59,583
- ( cries )
PLEASE JUST GO.

280
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,250
- NO! YOU MUST BE JOKING!

281
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,625
WHY WOULD HE KICK YOU OUT
AND NOT THE REST OF US?

282
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,791
- Bixlow: YEAH, I MEAN, WE'RE
JUST AS GUILTY AS YOU ARE.

283
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,166
- Tommen: JUST AS GUILTY.
TOTALLY GUILTY.

284
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,791
GUILTY ALRIGHT.
YOU BET YOU'RE GUILTY.

285
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,833
- GUESS THE OLD MAN
DOESN'T SEE IT THAT WAY.

286
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,583
- WELL, IF YOU'RE LEAVING
THE GUILD, THEN I'M LEAVING TOO.

287
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,791
- WHY SHOULD WE STICK AROUND
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE HERE?

288
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,750
- YOU GUYS CAN BE SUCH
A PAIN IN THE NECK.

289
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,541
I MEAN, CAN'T YOU JUST SAY
GOOD-BYE AND BE DONE WITH IT?

290
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,000
- Fried: I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WE'RE AT FAULT TOO.

291
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,708
SO WHY ARE YOU
TAKING ALL THE BLAME?

292
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,500
- YOU GOT IT ALL WRONG,
MY FRIENDS.

293
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,250
YOU CAN SAY
WHATEVER YOU WANT,

294
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,958
BUT I KNOW YOU GUYS
ARE MUCH MORE ATTACHED

295
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,708
TO THIS GUILD
THAN I COULD EVER BE.

296
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:38,958
- IF WE TALK TO THE MASTER,

297
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,541
MAYBE WE CAN CHANGE HIS MIND.

298
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,125
- YEAH, NATSU AND
GRAY RESPECT YOU.

299
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,916
SO THEY'LL PROBABLY
GO WITH US.

300
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,541
HE LOVES THOSE GUYS.
I'M SURE HE'LL LISTEN TO THEM.

301
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,375
- ARE YOU REALLY LEAVING?

302
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:53,333
- TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES.

303
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,916
- LAXUS, WAIT!

304
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,291
- HEY, YOU CAN'T JUST
LEAVE US BEHIND.

305
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,458
WHAT'LL HAPPEN TO
THE THUNDER LEGION?

306
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,916
- ( cries )
- MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!

307
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:10,625
- I'M SURE WE'LL
MEET AGAIN, LAXUS.

308
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,083
- Hades:
EXCELLENT WORK, ULTEAR.

309
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,416
WHAT BECAME OF JELLAL?

310
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,625
- TO BE HONEST,
I COULDN'T CARE LESS.

311
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,041
- THE POOR FELLOW
NEVER EVEN HAD A CLUE

312
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,666
THAT YOU WERE THE ONE
PULLING THE STRINGS.

313
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,000
HUH, PATHETIC.

314
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,708
- HMM, HE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN
THE BRIGHTEST MAN,

315
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,833
BUT HE WAS ADORABLE.

316
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,500
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT IN ALL THOSE YEARS,

317
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,708
HE NEVER REALIZED
THAT I WAS PRETENDING

318
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,291
TO BE THE SPIRIT
OF LORD ZEREF.

319
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:45,833
- YOUR ABILITIES SET THE STAGE
FOR GREAT THINGS,

320
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:50,333
THE MAGIC COUNCIL IN TURMOIL,
THE ETHERION FIRING.

321
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,916
OUR PLAN
IS COMING TO FRUITION.

322
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
- I HAD HOPED THAT WHILE JELLAL
WAS RUNNING AMOK,

323
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,083
YOU'D BE ABLE TO
MOVE ABOUT FREELY.

324
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:01,000
- ONE OF THE KEYS
NEEDED TO UNLOCK THE SEAL

325
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,958
IS NOW IN MY POSSESSION.
- IS THAT SO?

326
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,583
THAT'S GOOD, MASTER HADES.

327
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,333
( chuckles )

328
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,833
I'M SORRY THINGS
HAD TO END THIS WAY,

329
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,666
MY DEAR JELLAL.

330
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:20,708
- ( fireworks pop )

331
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,916
- ( cheering )

332
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,958
( cheering, chatter )

333
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,083
( catcalls )

334
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:45,166
( chattering )

335
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,708
( cheering )

336
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,416
- ( roars )
- ( gasps )

337
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,416
( cheering )

338
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,166
- Boys: HUH?!

339
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,750
- ( cheering )

340
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,625
( surprised murmurs )

341
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,333
- AYE.

342
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,541
- ( inhales deeply )

343
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,583
- ( cheers )
- ( coughs )

344
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:40,041
- HMM.
- Gajeel: HEY, MASTER.

345
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,125
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE 
IN THE PARADE, GAJEEL?

346
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,000
- I DON'T LIKE BEING
IN THE SPOTLIGHT.

347
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,958
- THAT CAN'T BE TRUE.
YOU'RE MISTER SHOO-BEE-DOO-BA.

348
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,541
- HERE, THIS IS FOR YOU.

349
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,458
SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG.

350
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,250
BUT I FINALLY
TRACKED DOWN YOUR SON

351
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,458
MASTER IVAN.
- GOOD WORK, MY BOY.

352
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,500
I'M SORRY
IT WAS SO DANGEROUS.

353
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,416
- NO PROB.  I CAN HANDLE IT.
IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF FUN.

354
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,583
AND THAT GUY HAS NO IDEA
THAT I'M A DOUBLE AGENT.

355
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,833
- THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE IT.

356
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,291
WE CAN'T LET HIM 
DO AS HE PLEASES.

357
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,125
- Man #1: YOU READY, MASTER?
IT'S ABOUT THAT TIME.

358
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,250
- SORRY, BUT
MY PUBLIC NEEDS ME.

359
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,916
- Woman: IT'S THE MASTER.
- Man #2: IS THAT REALLY HIM?

360
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,250
OH WOW.

361
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,708
- Man #3: HE SURE IS WEARING A
FANCY OUTFIT, HUH?

362
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,500
- Man #2: I'D SAY IT'S
MORE FUNKY THAN FANCY.

363
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:24,250
- I LIKE IT.
- WHY'S HE ACTING SO GOOFY?♪

364
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,500
- Young Laxus: 
BUT HOW COME...

365
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,583
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE IN
THE FANTASIA PARADE THIS YEAR?

366
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:32,666
- 'CAUSE THIS
IS YOUR BIG MOMENT.

367
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,958
BUT I'LL BE WATCHING YOU
FROM THE SIDELINES.

368
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,541
- WHEN I LOOK INTO THE CROWD,
HOW WILL I FIND YOU?

369
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,375
- FORGET ABOUT ME.
TODAY, YOU'RE THE STAR.

370
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,833
- IF YOU SAY SO.
OH, I KNOW.

371
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,333
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARADE,
I'LL DO THIS!

372
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,291
YOU COULD SEE THAT, RIGHT?

373
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,375
- YOU'LL RAISE YOUR HAND?

374
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,875
- IT'S A MESSAGE.

375
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,625
WHEN YOU SEE ME HOLDING UP
MY HAND LIKE THIS,

376
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,666
IT MEANS EVEN
IF I CAN'T SEE YOU,

377
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,083
I'M LOOKING YOUR WAY.

378
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,958
- THAT'S MY BOY.

379
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,625
- Young Laxus:
BE SURE TO LOOK FOR IT, OKAY?

380
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,375
- ( humming )

381
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:43,916
- GRANDPA.

382
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,500
- Makarov: I MAY NOT
BE ABLE TO SEE YOU. 

383
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,375
THERE MAY BE HUNDREDS
OF MILES BETWEEN US, 

384
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:54,708
BUT I'LL ALWAYS
BE LOOKING YOUR WAY.

385
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,833
I'LL BE WATCHING 
OVER YOU FOREVER.

386
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:58,875
I PROMISE.

387
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:01,125
- Laxus: I KNOW.

388
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,708
THANK YOU, GRANDPA.

389
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,875
- Natsu: THE PARTY'S 
JUST GETTING STARTED.

390
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,083
( laughs )
I'M ALL FIRED UP NOW.

391
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,333
- AYE AYE, SIR.

392
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:12,041
- Natsu: OKAY, GUYS,

393
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,291
WHO'S PROUD TO BE A MEMBER
OF FAIRY TAIL?

394
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,083
- Members: YEEHAW!

395
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,291
( laughing )
- I KNOW I'M JUST A ROOKIE

396
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,750
AND I'VE GOT
A LONG WAY TO GO,

397
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,458
BUT I'M GONNA WORK HARD
TO BECOME

398
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,625
AS AWESOME A WIZARD
AS THE OTHERS.

399
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:26,208
FAIRY TAIL IS
THE GREATEST GUILD EVER.

400
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,791
- IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL,

401
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,833
YOUR FACE'LL GET STUCK
IN THAT GOOFY GRIN.

402
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:33,083
- NO WAY! NOT MY PRETTY FACE!
- I WAS JUST WARNING YOU.

403
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,625
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET ALL
BENT OUT OF SHAPE ABOUT IT.

404
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:37,250
- Lucy: WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?
YOU SAID MY FACE

405
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:38,708
WAS GONNA GET STUCK.

406
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,291
GEEZ, WE FINALLY HAVE
A TOUCHING ENDING

407
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:41,708
AND YOU HAVE TO GO
AND RUIN IT.

408
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:45,083
- ( end theme playing )

409
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:49,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

410
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,666
- DID YOU HEAR THE NEWS?

411
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,625
A REPORTER FROM
"SORCERER WEEKLY" MAGAZINE

412
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:17,083
IS COMING TO
VISIT FAIRY TAIL.

413
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:18,791
- MAN, I HATE THOSE
SLEAZY REPORTERS.

414
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,666
THEY ALWAYS MAKE ME OUT
TO BE THE BAD GUY.

415
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,458
I'LL GIVE 'EM
A PIECE OF MY MIND.

416
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:24,458
- ACTUALLY, I THINK THEY
JUST TELL IT LIKE IT IS.

417
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:26,083
CAN YOU PROMISE ME THAT

418
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:28,291
YOU WON'T CAUSE THE GUILD
ANY TROUBLE? PLEASE.

419
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,666
- I PROMISE I'LL BE 
ON MY BEST BEHAVIOR.

420
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,250
- ( Happy and Natsu speaking )

421
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,250
- Happy: YOU SEE WHAT WE DID
WITH THE TITLE THERE?

422
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:36,666
THAT'S WHAT'S CALLED
FORESHADOWING.

423
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,458
- OH YEAH, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

424
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:39,916
- AH, YOU'LL FIND OUT
NEXT TIME.

425
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,625
OR WILL YOU?
