[LUCY] The world had
never seen a thief of his kind.

2
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,416
Like a grotesque shadow,
he moved unbridled

through the darkness.

4
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:34,916
The sight of his bizarre visage

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,250
caused even the bravest
of men to falter.

6
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:42,458

he always got his prize.

true form of your enemy!

19

[LUCY] What can the
hearts of men do

20
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:11,458
against such a wretched
and desolate foe?

00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:14,916
What mettle can
withstand his horror?

only fear and futility.

[LUCY] Hey, Put those down!

I think.

So is this

Yep.

Sure is!

37
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,333
I'm taking a stab at
a new genre so I can

stretch my writing
legs a bit, y'know?

39
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,416
I mean, everyone's
imagined what it would be like

40
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,583
to be invisible at least
once in their life, right?

41
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,375
So I thought it would
make an awesome premise

42
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,208

Yeah.

with more respect.

164
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:42,916
If you're
feeling hungry.

165
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,875
You know that you're always
welcome to come here and eat

166
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,250
from the bar instead.

167
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,583
Wow.

168
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,250
Are you sure you really
wanna make him that offer?

169
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,250
She kicked him out
cause he's a pig, ya know?

170
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,958
Well, Lucy could try
being a little nicer

171
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,916
to everybody
once in a while.

172
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,625
That's probably the reason
all of the single guys

173
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,083
in town call her
the "Blonde beast."

174
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,791
They hit the
nail on the head!

175
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,833
Yeah, she's about
as likely to start dating

176
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,833
as Droy is to go vegetarian.

177
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,708
You can take the rich
girl out of the mansion

178
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,958
but not the other
way around!

179
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,333
I have no idea
what that means,

180
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:14,416
but it sounded manly,
so I'll go along with it.

181
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,875
[DROY] If you ask me, Lucy could
stand to learn a thing or two

182
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,666
about being a lady from Levy.

183
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,000
Yeah, she's cute
and delicate, like a flower.

184
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,375
It's nice of you to say,
but I don't know if 'delicate'

185
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,541
is even in Lucy's vocabulary.

186
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,833
[LUCY] Let's see how much they
laugh when I have a little fun

187
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,666
at their expense!

188
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:34,958
Hey!

189
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,041
You got a problem, wise guy?

190
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,041
Wha-?

191
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,000
You're the one
with the problem!

192
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,541
Don't play dumb.

193
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:43,541
Wasting booze is bad enough,
but bathing me in it is suicide!

194
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,750
I think you've had
one too many, ol' pal.

195
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,750
Fine, if it wasn't you
then who did it?

196
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,125
Beats me!

197
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,708
That's my ear,
not a potato chip!

198
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,208
Eat my fist!

199
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:57,166
Sorry, but I'm not
into eating fatty meat!

200
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,708
Been awhile since
we've had a pointless brawl!

201
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,541
Okay, I must have
missed something.

202
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,125
Dad spilt his drink
and now he's throwing

203
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,833
a temper tantrum.

204
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,541
You'd think they'd learn
to take the rough stuff outside.

205
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,583
It was almost finished.

206
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,458
Now I have to start all over!

207
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,333
[NATSU] What the
heck was that for!

208
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,666
Are you lookin' for
a fight, punk?

209
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,458
My breakfast
will be avenged!

210
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,541
[GRAY] What're
you talkin' about?

211
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,458
I didn't touch
your nasty food!

212
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:32,750
You hit me!

213
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,333
Then get out of
the way of our fight, man!

214
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,625
Why do you even
stand here?

215
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,416
Everyone knows you'll
never take a job!

216
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,000
I may not have a job,
but I can sure as hell

217
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,166
can drop some pain
on you meatheads!

218
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,916
What are they fighting
each other for!

219
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,166
Calm down, everyone!

220
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,791
Let's talk this out!

221
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,166
This is nothing new.

222
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,083
Just let them have at it.

223
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,375
But if they keep this
up there won't be

224
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,458
a guild hall
to fight in.

225
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:05,000
Then we'll make them
rebuild it later today.

226
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:09,083
We must set an example and
not get involved their antics.

227
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,833
And they wonder why
the guild has fallen so low.

228
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,500
Did the lessons of the past
seven years just pass them by?

229
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:20,000
Very well then.

230
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,083
I guess I'll
just have to teach you!

231
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,458
What was that about
'setting an example'?

232
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,125
She always finds a reason
to join in the fun.

233
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,833
I really should come
to expect this kind of

234
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,458
behavior from them.

235
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,333
[LUCY] Okay.

236
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,375
I may have gone
a little overboard.

237
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,791
[LUCY yells]

238
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,416
I thought I heard Lucy.

239
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,833
That's weird.

240
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,291
And I can smell her!

241
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,250
It really is you!

242
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,416
[LUCY screams]

243
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,125
[LUCY] Watch where
you're touching, perv!

244
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,166
Is that Lucy?

245
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,541
I didn't know
she was here.

246
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,458
I definitely
heard her though.

247
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,041
Yet we can't see her.

248
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,333
Maybe she's
trapped behind the wall!

249
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,750
Now the cat's
outta the bag.

250
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,333
[MAX] Does anybody else
find this really weird?

251
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,125
[GRAY] To be honest,
I'm too confused to know

252
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,250
what I'm thinkin.

253
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,583
[LUCY] Hey,
could you guys please

254
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,416
not stare at me like that?

255
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,291
It's embarrassing!

256
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,458
[ALL] Creepy!

257
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,541
[LUCY] Thanks a lot!

258
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,625
I've never seen a
potion do this before.

259
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,083
It's good you're wearing
clothes now so we can see you.

260
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,666
but still.

261
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,750
Do you know how
to change back?

262
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:44,958
[LUCY] Well.

263
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,541
actually, I was kind of
hoping someone here

264
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:47,833
could help me with that.

265
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,125
If you ask me, you
shouldn't worry

266
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,750
about changing back.

267
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,375
You should go on some
jobs first; you're like

268
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,250
the perfect ninja
assassin now!

269
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,041
[LUCY] I'm not
a freakin' hit man!

270
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,083
There has to be
a way to fix this!

271
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,375
Does anyone know a remedy?

272
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,750
I'll try anything!

273
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,625
Wish I could
help you, but.

274
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,583
Don't worry; I know
just what to do!

275
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,000
[LUCY] Really!

276
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,083
If I burn all the potion
stuff off you should go back

277
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,458
to normal, right?

278
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,250
[LUCY] What makes you
think that would even work!

279
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,416
Knowing Natsu, I'd say
that's his 'go-to remedy'

280
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,666
for just about every
problem he faces.

281
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,041
Well it's the only idea
we've got at the moment.

282
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,375
So let's give it a shot.

283
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,291
It's time to grit your
teeth and go for broke,

284
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,041
like a real man would!

285
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,083
That's it.

286
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,500
I'm dead.

287
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,791
Okay, I'm giving
it my all, Lucy.

288
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,416
One good flame
deserves another!

289
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,666
[LUCY] H-Hold on!

290
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,166
On second thought,
I'll just stay invisible!

291
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,000
[NATSU and ROMEO] Ready...

292
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:37,958
...go!

293
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:42,791
[LUCY screams]

294
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:43,625
Huh.

295
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,083
Guess ya need more fire.

296
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,625
[LUCY] No, I do not!

297
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,916
Come on Lu,
don't be sad.

298
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,875
We'll have you
fixed up in no time.

299
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,250
Oui.

300
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,291
Don't worry, my dear, I live
for situations like this!

301
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,625
You do?

302
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,791
[LUCY] I'll try anything
as long as it's not fire!

303
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,333
Leave it to me, Madame.

304
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:03,166
I'll paint you a face that will
be considered a masterpiece!

305
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,208
Well,

306
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,541
it's definitely...

307
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:10,875
a unique face.

308
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,333
Actually, I think
you look prettier

309
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,708
than you did before!

310
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,333
[LUCY] Uh, no.

311
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,375
I'll pass.

312
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,625
I've always wanted
to try cubism!

313
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:21,958
Hey I'm not
a canvas!

314
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,125
Why don't you let a true
master take a crack at it?

315
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,416
That's my brush!

316
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:27,000
All done!

317
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,000
Whatcha think?

318
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,750
This is worse
than the last one!

319
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,833
Yeah, you need to bring
her eyes in closer,

320
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,625
and her nostrils
are way too tiny.

321
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,750
And this eyebrow
isn't bushy enough.

322
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:36,458
'Kay...

323
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,000
what next?

324
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,583
[LUCY] You're not helping!

325
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,291
First.

326
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,791
We should start by
fixing her eye brows.

327
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,291
You wanna darken around her
eyes so they'll really pop.

328
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,625
kinda like this.

329
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,291
Step aside amateurs; I'll
make her good as new.

330
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,041
You've got no
sense of anatomy.

331
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,833
Luckily, I took art
classes in grade school

332
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,250
for a couple
of days.

333
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,208
Facial hair
is a necessity.

334
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,916
Personally I'm a huge
fan of the Fu Manchu.

335
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,375
Every girl strives to be
the pinnacle of cuteness.

336
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,375
Sparkly eyes really
help with that.

337
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,375
You know, I've
always wanted to

338
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,916
see you with
darker hair.

339
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,833
It'll give you more
of a gothy look!

340
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,375
Personally, I'd like to see
some different hairstyles.

341
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:15,125
Like a short pixie cut,
or maybe dreadlocks!

342
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,333
I think she's more of
an afro kinda chick.

343
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,916
Well, You can't have an afro
without groovy face paint!

344
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,708
[LUCY] Screw you guys!

345
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,750
I'm not a freakin' toy!

346
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:25,416
Sup bro'?

347
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,166
Why would
you do this to me!

348
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,166
Too much work.

349
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,458
This should
fix her up.

350
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,125
Maker magic
for the win!

351
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,208
It's even got nose
holes for breathing.

352
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:40,916
[ALL] Creepy!

353
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,291
[LUCY] You are the
worst friends ever!

354
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:43,791
[LUCY] Okay,

355
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,250
what is this thing?

356
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,208
We ripped it out of

357
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,000
an old Sorcerer
Weekly centerfold.

358
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,541
You can't see
out of it, but at least

359
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,083
you have your face back.

360
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,166
[LUCY] Well, it's better
than the last option was,

361
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,291
that's for sure.

362
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,166
Oui.

363
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,708
It's much better.

364
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,208
We're back!

365
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,416
So, what did you two
go rushing off for?

366
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,041
To search Lucy's
apartment!

367
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,375
We found the potion bottle.

368
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,958
And I thought you might
want your Celestial Keys.

369
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,375
[LUCY] Oh, yeah!

370
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,291
I didn't think of asking
my Celestial Spirits for help!

371
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,583
I owe you big time!

372
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,041
Thanks a lot, ladies!

373
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,041
But I'm not sure
which one I should summon.

374
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:17,000
Loki and Aquarius are my
strongest but I doubt they'd

375
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,250
be much help in this situation.

376
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,916
You should bring out the
gremlins that copy people!

377
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,916
[LUCY] You mean
Gemini? What for?

378
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,416
Duh, we're gonna have them
change into you, silly!

379
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,125
Just summon them already!

380
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,791
[LUCY] Okay.

381
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,541
Open, Gate of the Twins!

382
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,791
Gemini!

383
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,250
[LUCY (GEMINI)] Gemini's
coming at ya Lucy style!

384
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,083
[MACAO] Hey.

385
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,250
I can see her again!

386
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,000
[WAKABA] You know
that's not really her.

387
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,041
[HAPPY] Way to go, Gemini!

388
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,625
[HAPPY] Now the magic happens!

389
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,541
[LUCY (GEMINI)]
Hello, my name is Lucy.

390
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,083
Would you like to be best
friends with me forever?

391
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,583
If she does this
the rest of her life,

392
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:51,708
the problem's solved!

393
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:52,625
This is perfect!

394
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,500
Nice work, Happy!

395
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,458
[LUCY] This doesn't solve
anything, coal-for-brains!

396
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,458
[GRAY] Man, you really
do look just like her.

397
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,000
Crazy.

398
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,166
[LUCY (GEMINI)] I also copied
her thoughts and abilities.

399
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,333
Cool, huh?

400
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,541
And I can maintain
this form indefinitely.

401
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,083
[MAX] If that's the case,
couldn't we just say

402
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,333
this is the real Lucy?

403
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:09,916
That'd work for me.

404
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,291
[JET] It'd make all of this a
lot easier, so I'm down for it.

405
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,250
[DROY] Yeah, and this Lucy
is friendlier and far more

406
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,000
lady-like than the old one was.

407
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,208
[LUCY] I'm still here!

408
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,875
We were just joking!

409
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:22,000
You two sure got
quiet; is everything okay?

410
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,666
Yeah, we're just analyzing
the potion's recipe.

411
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,750
If we figure out
how the magic works.

412
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,250
then we can
create an Enchantment

413
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,208
to reverse its effect.

414
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,041
That was
a piece of cake.

415
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,083
Here ya go.

416
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,958
A complete list
of the components.

417
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,166
Thanks.

418
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,875
Now leave the rest to me!

419
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,166
This Enchantment will
nullify the potion's effect.

420
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,708
So sit perfectly still.

421
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,333
It will be over soon!

422
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:54,791
[MACAO] So, uh.

423
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,041
Did it work or not?

424
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,291
[WAKABA] Don't look at me.

425
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,000
[LUCY] Are you sure
you wrote it correctly?

426
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,500
I am.

427
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,333
The effects have been dealt
with, but since the potion

428
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,791
had seven years to mature.

429
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,333
It will take just as long
for the Enchantment to work.

430
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:09,000
[LUCY] Can't you do anything
to speed up the process!

431
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,291
[LEVY] Sorry, Lu.

432
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,291
[Lucy begins to cry]

433
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,916
I don't get it, why
are you laughing?

434
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,916
[LUCY] I'm not!

435
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,833
I'm crying, you
insensitive jerk!

436
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,791
[LUCY] Hey, what's
happening to me?

437
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,500
Why are my clothes
starting to disappear!

438
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:26,500
No, I was afraid

439
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,958
something like
this would happen.

440
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:28,666
[ERZA] Like what?

441
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,958
What's going on here!

442
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,125
Time can drastically
change a potion's effects.

443
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,916
And I think this one has
gotten way more powerful.

444
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,041
She's not just
turning invisible.

445
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:40,833
I'm afraid her very existence
is being removed from history.

446
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,208
The bottle
just vanished!

447
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,833
If her existence
is being nullified,

448
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:47,416
it makes sense for her personal
belongings to vanish too.

449
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,625
I bet you everything in
her apartment is disappearing

450
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:50,708
as we speak!

451
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:00,666
No...

452
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,041
This can't be happening to me.

453
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,541
I don't wanna disappear;
I wanna live!

454
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,708
Look, I'm right here,
plain as day.

455
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:07,583
You see?

456
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,166
I'm as real as you!

457
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:16,000
Weird; I totally blanked
on what I was talking about.

458
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,041
Yes.

459
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,000
I suppose it wasn't
very important.

460
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,208
[REEDUS] I could have sworn

461
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,916
I was in the middle of
painting something.

462
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,291
But what?

463
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,416
This sounds weird.

464
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,708
but I feel like
there's someone else

465
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,458
who's supposed
to be here with us.

466
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,625
I'm having a
similar feeling myself.

467
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:30,958
How odd.

468
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,791
Could we be under the
effects of a malicious spell

469
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:33,833
or Enchantment?

470
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,250
I dunno.

471
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,458
Guess It's possible.

472
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,916
Are you feeling
anything weird, Natsu?

473
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,125
I'm hungry?

474
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,333
Come on,
I'm right in front of you!

475
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,625
What's the matter?
Can't you hear me?

476
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,875
Oh well, I guess it's
back to the daily grind then.

477
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,458
[REEDUS] Fried,
if you're not busy,

478
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,541
I could really use
a model for more practice.

479
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,291
Yes, of course.

480
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:58,375
Natsu!

481
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,250
Stop drinking and look at me!

482
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,208
Hey Gray?

483
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,833
Can you hear me?

484
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:03,500
[LUCY] Erza!

485
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:04,416
Happy!

486
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,416
Wendy!

487
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,625
Carla!

488
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,583
Please Don't forget me!

489
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,250
Too late.

490
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,708
The damage has been done.

491
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:18,000
[LUCY] Every one of my friends
has forgotten about me.

492
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,541
Because I never
existed in their world.

493
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,041
I'm like a ghost that
can't even haunt anyone.

494
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:27,000
I refuse to live this way!

495
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,416
[NATSU] Ahh, much better!
I'm ready to tackle the day!

496
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,708
Happy, go find Lucy
so we can get rocking!

497
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,750
Aye, Sir!

498
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,333
Lucy?

499
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,083
Lucy?

500
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:54,708
Oh yeah!

501
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,583
Lucy!

502
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,500
[NATSU AND HAPPY] She's our
best friend and teammate!

503
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,000
The one who completes us!

504
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,250
Yes, I remember now!

505
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,708
How could we forget her?

506
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,000
I need to quit drinkin'.

507
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,583
Yeah we love her.

508
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,875
Hey.

509
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,500
I'm back!

510
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,250
Great to see you again!

511
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,333
Welcome back!

512
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,041
I guess that was
kind of a close call.

513
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:23,125
I wonder if Natsu is
the one who broke the spell.

514
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,125
[MAX] Yeah.

515
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,250
I think you might
be right there.

516
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,708
His mind may have
forgotten her,

517
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,958
but she was still tucked
away in his heart.

518
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,541
No ordinary magic could
trump our guild's bonds!

519
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,916
In your face, potion!

520
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,083
Yes, that's certainly
a fine sentiment.

521
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,666
Everything's back to normal.

522
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,083
Not that you three contributed
to that in the least.

523
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,000
[LUCY] Thanks a lot, Natsu.

524
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,625
What, did you think
losing your existence

525
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,125
would get you
out of work today?

526
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:46,875
Think again!

527
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,125
Aye!

528
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,250
[LUCY] It turns out being
invisible really wasn't

529
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,583
all that bad in the end.

530
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,375
[LUCY] But the loneliness I
felt when I thought I'd been

531
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:59,500
forgotten was the worst
feeling in the world.

532
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,166
[LUCY] My guild mates may
not be the most reliable.

533
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,833
But, at the end of the day,
they're a dear and precious

534
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,333
part of my life.

535
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:10,125
Ya know, I should
probably get rid of this thing.

536
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,875
I'm so glad you're
not dead, Lucy!

537
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,166
[HAPPY] Natsu!

538
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:36,416
[group talking over one another]

539
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,041
Yep, those
are my friends.

540
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:41,000
I really wish they'd learn to
get their act together though.

541
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:47,416
♪

542
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:15,000
[HAPPY] Have you seen
Elfman around anywhere?

543
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,416
[NATSU] Yeah, he just
stepped out to run

544
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,625
some errands for Mira.

545
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:20,416
[HAPPY] I wish I had
a little brother, too.

546
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,333
[NATSU] Why?

547
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:22,291
[HAPPY] Are you kidding?

548
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:23,708
It'd be awesome!

549
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:26,666
He'd go shopping for me,
cook for me, give me back rubs,

550
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:31,041
and I'd always get one more
fish, because I'm the oldest!

551
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:33,333
[HAPPY] Next time:
Father's Memento!

552
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,250
I'm pretty sure there's not
a little brother in the world

553
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:36,833
who would do all of that crap.

554
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:38,875
[HAPPY] Isn't that how
siblings are though?

555
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:41,875
[NATSU] Is it?
Now I kinda want one!
