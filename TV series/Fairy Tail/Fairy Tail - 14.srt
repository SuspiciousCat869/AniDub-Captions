1
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,958
- HEY, GUYS.  READY FOR
SOME MORE "FAIRY TAIL"?

2
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,791
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING,

3
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,291
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE ROOM

4
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:26,333
AND DON'T SIT
TOO CLOSE TO THE TV.

5
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:28,916
- Happy:
PREVIOUSLY ON "FAIRY TAIL..."

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,875
LYON WAS SCHEMING
TO REVIVE DELIORA

7
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:33,000
AND HE SENT HIS LACKEYS
TO DESTROY THE VILLAGE.

8
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,625
BUT I TOOK 'EM ALL DOWN.
- Lucy: YOU DID WHAT?

9
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,625
- Happy: LUCY'S FIGHTING
IT OUT AGAINST SHERRY

10
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,208
AND HER MARIONETTE MAGIC,
BUT SHE'S HAVING A HARD TIME

11
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,583
'CAUSE I'M NOT
THERE TO HELP HER OUT.

12
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,666
AND SHERRY WON'T SHUT UP
ABOUT LOVE.

13
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,500
- Lucy: WORST RECAP EVER.

14
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:49,166
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

15
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,125
- YOU WERE ABLE
TO CLOSE THE GATE

16
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,666
EVEN THOUGH I WAS IN CONTROL.

17
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,458
- I GUESS THAT MEANS
I'M STRONGER THAN YOU.

18
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,750
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF I WOULD TAKE IT THAT FAR.

19
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:30,250
REMEMBER, MY POWERS
ALLOW ME TO TAKE CONTROL

20
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:33,541
OVER ANY CELESTIAL SPIRIT
THAT YOU MIGHT CALL FOR. 

21
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:36,166
- DON'T BE SO SURE.

22
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,833
I'VE GOT A FEW POWERFUL
SPIRITS UP MY SLEEVE.

23
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,458
- ( circus music plays )

24
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,500
- OPEN, GATE OF CANIS MINOR.

25
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:47,125
COME, NICHOLA.
- ( doorbell rings )

26
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,708
- ISN'T HE THE CUTEST
LITTLE THING?

27
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,791
OH, I'M IN LOVE.

28
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,333
- WOULD YOU QUIT TALKING
ABOUT LOVE ALL THE TIME?

29
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:06,666
'CAUSE IT'S
GETTING PRETTY OLD.

30
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,208
- WELL, SOMEONE'S BITTER.

31
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,458
MARIONETTE ATTACK!
NOW, YOU'RE MY PUPPET.

32
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,000
- HEY, PLUE?

33
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,500
NO, NOT YOU TOO!

34
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,625
- ( grunts )

35
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,333
- Happy: JUST DO WHATEVER.

36
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,625
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME?
- I KNEW YOU'D FALL FOR THAT.

37
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,166
( strains )

38
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,250
( grunts )

39
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:44,041
- YOU DELIBERATELY
SUMMONED A WEAK SPIRIT.

40
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,375
- THAT'S RIGHT.

41
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,083
I KNEW THAT IF I CALLED FORTH
LITTLE PLUE HERE,

42
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,666
IT WOULD MAKE YOUR SPELL
TOTALLY POINTLESS.

43
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,541
JEEZ, I RELEASE
YOU FROM COMMAND.

44
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:59,166
- ( gasps, whimpers )

45
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,666
- OH, I KNOW
YOU DIDN'T MEAN IT.

46
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,666
NOW GO BACK, OKAY?

47
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,083
- MARIONETTE ATTACK!
GET HER, ROCK DOLL. 

48
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,958
- WE'RE GONNA KEEP GOING
ROUND AND ROUND AREN'T WE?

49
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,083
I'LL STOP YOUR DOLL
WITH A SPIRIT,

50
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,666
YOU'LL TAKE CONTROL OF IT,

51
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,875
AND THEN I'LL CLOSE ITS GATE.
- ( rumbling )

52
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,166
- ( gasping )
- ( groaning )

53
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,250
- IT'S LIKE WE'RE
PLAYING CAT AND MOUSE.

54
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,791
I LOVE THAT GAME.

55
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,375
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO,
LITTLE MOUSE.

56
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,333
YOU THINK YOU CAN 
BEAT MY ROCK DOLL?

57
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,416
- NOW I'M IN TROUBLE.
I DON'T THINK I HAVE A SPIRIT

58
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,083
STRONG ENOUGH TO
DESTROY THAT THING.

59
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,333
- ( groaning )

60
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,875
- ( screaming )

61
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,458
( pants )

62
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,041
( screams )

63
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,583
BAD!  BAD!  BAD!
OH, SO VERY BAD!

64
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,458
- DON'T LET HER GET AWAY,
ROCK DOLL.

65
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,958
LET'S TEACH THAT FOOLISH
LITTLE GIRL A LESSON.

66
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,625
- WHO ARE YOU CALLING
A LITTLE GIRL?!

67
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,416
WE'RE THE SAME AGE.
I MIGHT EVEN BE A LITTLE OLDER!

68
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,208
- IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA
TO KEEP BABBLING LIKE THAT.

69
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,791
UNLESS YOU WANT US
TO CATCH YOU.

70
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,333
- OKAY, WHAT
SPIRIT DO I HAVE

71
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,208
THAT CAN HELP ME OUT
IN THIS SITUATION?

72
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,208
- ( buzzers sound )

73
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,708
- YOU'D BETTER HURRY.  IF YOU
DON'T START MOVING FASTER,

74
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,291
WE'RE GONNA
CATCH UP WITH YOU.

75
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,625
- ( screams )

76
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,666
( panting )

77
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,833
( screams )

78
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,625
- I COMMAND YOU
TO CRUSH HER FLAT.

79
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,541
- OW!

80
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,041
HOLD ON.
ISN'T THIS A...

81
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,000
A CLIFF?!

82
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:23,666
( screaming )

83
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,333
- FINISH HER, ROCK DOLL!

84
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,958
- ( screams )
- ( groans )

85
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,083
- ( laughing )

86
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,666
THERE'S NOWHERE 
TO RUN, BLONDIE.

87
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,583
- THE SEA.

88
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,875
I COULD SUMMON AQUARIUS
FROM HERE.

89
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,333
- ( groaning )

90
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,125
- ( laughs )

91
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,291
IT LOOKS LIKE THE CAT'S FINALLY
GOING TO CATCH THE MOUSE.

92
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,833
- WATER CAN'T
DESTROY THAT THING.

93
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:02,291
BESIDES, AQUARIUS WOULD JUST
WASH ME AWAY WITH THEM.

94
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,833
WAIT A MINUTE.

95
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,333
- ( laughs )

96
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,416
I'M GOING TO CRUSH YOU
LIKE A LITTLE BUG.

97
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,708
SORRY, NO LOVE FOR YOU.

98
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,666
- WASH ME AWAY,
THAT'S IT.

99
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,708
OPEN, GATE OF
THE WATER BEARER.

100
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,958
- ( doorbell rings )
- AQUARIUS.

101
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,916
- AQUARIUS?

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,375
HOW DOES A WEAKLING LIKE YOU

103
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,875
HAVE A SPIRIT WITH 
THAT KIND OF POWER?

104
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:39,083
- THAT GIRL IS OUR ENEMY.
YOU HATE HER KIND.

105
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,083
SO GO GET HER!
- ( scoffs )

106
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,333
- I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO DEAL WITH YOUR BAD ATTITUDE.

107
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,666
GET OVER THERE
AND TAKE HER DOWN.  NOW.

108
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,041
- WELL, I SEE YOU'RE JUST
AS ANNOYING AS EVER.

109
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,166
NO WONDER YOU STILL
DON'T HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

110
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,666
- JEEZ, WHY DO YOU KEEP 
RUBBING IT IN LIKE THAT?

111
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,375
- MARIONETTE ATTACK!
YOU WILL NOW DO AS I COMMAND.

112
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,500
- WHAT?

113
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,583
- SHE'S UNDER MY SPELL,

114
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,333
SO SHE WON'T DO
YOUR BIDDING ANYMORE.

115
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,541
MIGHT AS WELL SEND HER BACK.
- NO WAY.

116
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,875
AQUARIUS IS STILL
MY ACE IN THE WHOLE.

117
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,375
- I BET YOU WON'T
STILL THINK THAT

118
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,750
WHEN THE SEA WASHES AWAY
YOUR PITIFUL EXISTENCE. 

119
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:14,125
NOW, AQUARIUS, GET RID OF THIS
STUPID GIRL ONCE AND FOR ALL.

120
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,541
- WHAT?!

121
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,875
I WAS ALREADY
PLANNING ON IT!

122
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,166
( screams )

123
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,166
- ( screams )

124
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,208
- SAY GOOD-BYE, LITTLE--
UH...

125
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,166
( screams )

126
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,625
( screams )

127
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,083
WAIT!

128
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,166
- ( both scream )

129
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,291
- ( smirks )

130
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,000
AND I THOUGHT
THE BLONDE GIRL WAS STUPID.

131
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,458
I CAN CLOSE MY OWN GATE,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

132
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,000
BUH-BYE.

133
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,041
- ( weak laughter )

134
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,708
LEAVE IT TO AQUARIUS

135
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:08,000
TO HURL HER WAVES AGAINST
FRIEND AND FOE ALIKE.

136
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,583
- ( groans )

137
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,791
I HATE MYSELF FOR ALLOWING
YOU TO TRICK ME AGAIN.

138
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,208
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER

139
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,208
BECAUSE SHE WASN'T
STRONG ENOUGH

140
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,166
TO DESTROY MY ROCK DOLL.

141
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,083
- AND SO WHAT? THAT PUPPET
OF YOURS CAN'T DO ANYTHING

142
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,916
IF YOU'RE NOT THERE
TO CONTROL IT.

143
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,041
I KNEW THAT ALL I HAD TO DO WAS
GET YOU AWAY FROM THAT THING.

144
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,541
AND IT WORKED BECAUSE
NOW YOU'RE TOO DIZZY 

145
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:25,791
TO EVEN WALK
IN A STRAIGHT LINE.

146
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,750
- ( both growl )

147
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:28,916
- THAT'S WHAT YOU
GET FOR MESSING

148
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,500
WITH A MEMBER
OF FAIRY TAIL.

149
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,500
- I CAN'T BELIEVE WE ENDED UP
IN A STALEMATE.

150
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,666
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, STALEMATE?
I'M OBVIOUSLY THE WINNER HERE.

151
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,958
- YOU CAN'T JUST

152
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,583
DECLARE YOURSELF
THE WINNER OF A FIGHT.

153
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,416
IF THAT'S THE CASE, 
THEN I'M THE WINNER.

154
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,875
- I DON'T THINK SO!

155
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,583
- NO!
HOW'D THIS HAPPEN TO ME?

156
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,458
I NEVER LOSE.

157
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,541
- OH, YEAH?
WELL, YOU JUST DID...

158
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,416
TO A WIZARD FROM FAIRY TAIL.

159
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,666
- ALTHOUGH THE BURNING
FLAME OF MY LIFE

160
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,500
HAS BEEN EXTINGUISHED
FAR TOO SOON,

161
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,750
MY LOVE FOR YOU WILL
BLAZE ON ETERNALLY, 

162
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,958
COLD EMPEROR.
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE,

163
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,666
SO LET'S TONE DOWN
THE DRAMA, OKAY?

164
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,375
- ( gasps )
ANGELICA,

165
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,958
AVENGE YOUR
MASTER'S DEATH.

166
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,416
- HUH?

167
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,833
- BUT I THOUGHT THAT RAT
WAS ONE OF HER PUPPETS.

168
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,666
- ( screams )
- ( growls )

169
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,000
- I CAN'T MOVE MY LEGS
FOR SOME REASON.

170
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,458
- ( growls ) 
- ( screams )

171
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,583
- ( grunts )

172
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,250
- ERZA!
WHOA.

173
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,208
I FORGOT.  SHE'S MAD AT US
BECAUSE WE BROKE GUILD RULES

174
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,583
AND TOOK AN S-CLASS REQUEST
WITHOUT PERMISSION.

175
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,625
- LUCY.

176
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,500
I ASSUME YOU KNOW
WHY I'M HERE.

177
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:56,916
YOU DO, DON'T YOU?

178
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,083
- TO TAKE US BACK?

179
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,916
PROMISE YOU WON'T HURT ME?
( echoing )

180
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,916
PROMISE YOU WON'T HURT ME?

181
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,250
PROMISE YOU WON'T HURT ME?

182
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,500
PROMISE YOU WON'T HURT ME?

183
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,875
PROMISE YOU WON'T HURT ME?

184
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,916
- ( laughs )

185
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,875
- HEY, I'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

186
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,791
I'M GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.

187
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,916
I WAS WOR--
( gasps )

188
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,791
( whimpers )

189
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,875
- NOW WHERE IS NATSU?
- LISTEN.

190
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,041
I'M SORRY WE CAME HERE
WITHOUT PERMISSION.

191
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,375
BUT SOME REALLY AWFUL THINGS

192
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,875
HAVE BEEN HAPPENING
ON THIS ISLAND.

193
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,708
THERE'S THIS GUY
AND HIS MINIONS 

194
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,500
WHO'RE TRYING TO
REVIVE A FROZEN DEMON.

195
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,250
AND THE ISLAND'S VILLAGERS
ARE SUFFERING

196
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,958
BECAUSE OF THIS MAGIC SPELL
THEY'RE USING.

197
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,041
THEY'VE TURNED INTO MONSTERS.

198
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,250
WE JUST THOUGHT THAT
IF WE WORKED TOGETHER,

199
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,750
WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO HELP THEM.

200
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,125
- NONE OF THAT
IS MY CONCERN.

201
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:51,250
- PLEASE, ERZA,
LET US FINISH THIS JOB.

202
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,916
WE CAN'T LEAVE
THINGS THIS WAY.

203
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,125
( gasps )

204
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,125
- I DON'T THINK
YOU UNDERSTAND.

205
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,916
THE THREE OF YOU HAVE
BETRAYED MASTER MAKAROV.

206
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,041
YOU'LL BE LUCKY IF YOU
WALK AWAY WITH YOUR LIVES.

207
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,250
- OKAY, NOW I'M SCARED.

208
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,375
- Gray: WHERE AM I?

209
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:46,875
- OH, THANK GOODNESS.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE AWAKE.

210
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,875
- WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

211
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,750
- IT'S A STORAGE AREA THAT'S 
NOT TOO FAR FROM THE VILLAGE.

212
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:54,625
EVERYTHING WAS DESTROYED 
IN THE ATTACK LAST NIGHT.

213
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,125
SO WE DECIDED
TO COME HERE FOR SHELTER.

214
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,416
- THE WHOLE VILLAGE?
THAT'S HORRIBLE.

215
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,291
- THEN DESTROY THE VILLAGE.

216
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,708
- YES, SIR.
- UNDERSTOOD.

217
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,833
- IT'S A SHAME THERE HAS
TO BE BLOODSHED.

218
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,833
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

219
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,333
THEY ACTUALLY WENT AND DID IT.
- Boy: DAD, I'M HUNGRY.

220
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,250
- Girl: YEAH, ME TOO.
- Father: I KNOW.

221
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,541
- ( groans )

222
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:17,291
- YOU KNOW, IT WAS A MIRACLE
THAT NATSU AND LUCY WERE HERE.

223
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,750
THANKS TO THEIR BRAVERY,

224
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,625
EVERYBODY WAS ABLE
TO MAKE IT OUT ALIVE.

225
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,416
- SO ARE THEY STILL
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE?

226
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,875
- YES, THEY ACTUALLY WANTED ME
TO SHOW YOU TO THEIR TENT

227
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,666
ONCE YOU'D
FINALLY WOKEN UP.

228
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,791
- WHICH TENT?
- THEY'RE WAITING FOR YOU

229
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,958
IN THAT BIG ONE
RIGHT OVER THERE.

230
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,458
- YOU MADE ME WAIT.
NOT SMART.

231
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:42,583
- ERZA!

232
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,375
WHY ARE THEY TIED UP?

233
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,875
- LUCY'S GOT ME UP TO SPEED

234
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,500
WITH EVERYTHING 
THAT'S HAPPENED.

235
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,791
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SENT HERE TO STOP NATSU

236
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,208
AND THESE TWO FOOLS.

237
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,291
NEEDLESS TO SAY, 
I'M DISAPPOINTED.

238
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,958
- WHERE IS HE, ANYWAY?

239
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,000
- THAT'S SOMETHING
WE'D ALL LIKE TO KNOW.

240
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,333
- THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM,
HE WAS FIGHTING AGAINST

241
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,083
THE COLD EMPEROR'S LACKEYS.

242
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,416
BUT WHEN WE WENT BACK
TO WHERE THE VILLAGE WAS,

243
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,333
THERE WASN'T ANY SIGN OF HIM.

244
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,375
WHEREVER HE IS,
I HOPE HE'S OKAY.

245
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,000
ANYWAY, SINCE WE
COULDN'T FIND HIM,

246
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,500
ERZA DEMANDED THAT 
WE TAKE HER TO YOU,

247
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,416
BUT I HAD NO IDEA
WHERE YOU ENDED UP.

248
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,625
- SO I DID SOME SCOUTING
FROM THE AIR.

249
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,625
AND FROM UP THERE,
I COULD SEE THAT THE VILLAGERS

250
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,458
HAD MOVED INTO
THIS STORAGE AREA.

251
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:22,083
- OKAY, WE'RE GOING
TO SEARCH FOR NATSU

252
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,625
AND THEN WE'RE GOING BACK
TO THE GUILD.

253
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,750
- BUT WE CAN'T LEAVE
THE ISLAND JUST YET.

254
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,875
IF LUCY FILLED YOU IN,
THEN YOU KNOW EXACTLY

255
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,791
WHAT THESE VILLAGERS
ARE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW.

256
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,916
- AND WHAT WOULD
BE YOUR POINT?

257
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,333
- ( yawning )

258
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,541
MAN, I FINALLY COME UP
WITH THE PERFECT PLAN

259
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,958
AND THEN
I GO AND OVERSLEEP.

260
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:50,166
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
LET'S DO THIS.

261
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,625
- I CAME HERE SOLELY
TO APPREHEND THESE FOOLS

262
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,166
FOR BREAKING
THE RULES OF THE GUILD.

263
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,166
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN ANYTHING
OTHER THAN THAT.

264
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,500
- RULES?  HAVE YOU EVEN SEEN
WHAT'S HAPPENED

265
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,125
TO THE PEOPLE
ON THIS ISLAND?

266
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,916
- I HAVE.
- AND YOU'RE STILL

267
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,416
JUST GONNA
TURN YOUR BACK ON 'EM?

268
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,291
- THEIR REQUEST
IS POSTED ON THE BOARDS

269
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,833
OF EVERY GUILD HALL.

270
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,208
THE VILLAGERS WOULD BE
BETTER SERVED

271
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,166
BY WIZARDS WHO ARE CLEARED
FOR S-CLASS.

272
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,458
YOU'RE NOT QUALIFIED.

273
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,541
- HOW CAN YOU
BE SO HEARTLESS?

274
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,541
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

275
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,083
- THAT'S NO WAY TO SPEAK
TO THE GREAT ERZA.

276
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,833
- YOU SUCK-UP.

277
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:23,166
- HAVE YOU CHOSEN TO DEFY 
THE GUILD'S RULES AS WELL?

278
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,166
YOU'LL FACE
THE SAME PUNISHMENT.

279
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,666
- DO WHAT YOU MUST.

280
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,750
FOR ME, THERE'S NO OTHER
CHOICE TO BE MADE.

281
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,458
I CAN'T WALK AWAY
FROM WHAT I KNOW IS RIGHT.

282
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,333
I'M SEEING THIS
THROUGH TO THE END.

283
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:09,166
AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME.

284
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,041
- ( screams )
PLEASE DON'T GET MAD AT US.

285
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,625
WE DON'T HAVE ANY 
CONTROL OVER GRAY!

286
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,208
- HE'S NOT FEELING
LIKE HIMSELF RIGHT NOW

287
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,708
'CAUSE HE LOST A FIGHT
TO HIS OLD FRIEND!

288
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,208
- ( both gasp )

289
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,416
- THESE EVENTS
ARE INTOLERABLE.

290
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,583
WE'LL DEAL WITH THE IMMEDIATE
PROBLEMS FOR NOW.

291
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,166
- Both:
THANK YOU.

292
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,041
- THIS DOESN'T
CHANGE ANYTHING.

293
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,791
YOU'RE STILL GOING 
TO FACE PUNISHMENT.

294
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,583
- YES, MA'AM.

295
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,791
- HOW PATHETIC.

296
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,250
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
STILL STANDING, TOBY.

297
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,708
- ( groans )

298
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,583
- THOSE FAIRY TAIL WIZARDS,

299
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,875
THEY'RE QUITE IMPRESSIVE.

300
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,500
- ( screams )

301
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:04,666
HEY, CAN WE KEEP THAT WHOLE
SHOCKING-MYSELF THING A SECRET?

302
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,708
- THIS UNFORTUNATE
TURN OF EVENTS

303
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,708
COULD PUT THE RESURRECTION
OF DELIORA IN JEOPARDY.

304
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,458
- ZALTI, YOU'RE
STEALTHY AS EVER.

305
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,166
- IF ALL GOES AS PLANNED,

306
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,375
THE DEMON SHOULD AWAKEN
AT SOME POINT TONIGHT. 

307
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,166
BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE
ON THOSE WIZARDS.

308
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,458
IF THEY WERE TO INTERRUPT
THE MOON DRIP CEREMONY,

309
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,666
THEN DELIORA WOULD
FOREVER REMAIN ENTOMBED IN ICE.

310
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,541
SALAMANDER AND TITANIA
ARE QUITE POWERFUL.

311
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,000
THEY COULD EASILY
FOIL OUR PLANS.

312
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:34,416
- AS ALWAYS, YOU SEEM
REMARKABLY WELL INFORMED.

313
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,541
NO MIND.
I CAN'T SAY I'M WORRIED.

314
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,166
THOSE FOOLS MAY BE STRONG,

315
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,458
BUT THEY'RE NO MATCH FOR ME.

316
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,291
- I WAS HOPING 
YOU'D SAY THAT.

317
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,458
SO IT'S VERY
REASSURING TO HEAR.

318
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,541
BUT STILL,
ALLOW ME THE HONOR

319
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,250
OF JOINING YOU IN BATTLE
FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE.

320
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,458
- HOLD UP, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE A WIZARD TOO.

321
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,583
- YES, IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE I'VE USED IT.

322
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:57,083
BUT I'VE DABBLED IN
A PARTICULAR FORM OF LOST MAGIC.

323
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,750
- SURE.  WE COULD USE
ANOTHER WIZARD.

324
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,291
- ( rumbling )
- IT'S AN EARTHQUAKE!

325
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:05,291
- ( rumbling )

326
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:08,041
- I DON'T THINK SO.
- IT'S ALL COMING DOWN.

327
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,333
- ( grunts )

328
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:17,333
- ( screaming )

329
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,166
- ( screams )

330
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,083
- WHAT IS
THE MEANING OF THIS?

331
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,916
- ( shivers )
WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

332
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,500
- I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN SALAMANDER
WOULD MAKE THE FIRST MOVE.

333
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,000
IT APPEARS WE HAVE
A VISITOR, SIR.

334
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,375
- ( laughs )

335
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,375
YOU KNOW, I USUALLY END UP
BREAKING STUFF BY ACCIDENT.

336
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,833
IT'S KIND OF FUNNY
HOW HARD IT IS

337
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,708
WHEN I'M TRYING
TO DO IT ON PURPOSE.

338
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,208
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

339
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,958
- I'M KNOCKING
THIS PLACE OVER.

340
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,958
THEN YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO SHINE MOONLIGHT

341
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,708
ON THAT DEMON
YOU'VE GOT UNDERGROUND.

342
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,583
- ( rumbling )

343
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,208
- INSOLENT FOOL.

344
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,208
JUST WHO DO
YOU THINK YOU ARE?

345
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,083
YOU DARE CHALLENGE ME?

346
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:06,125
- OKAY, WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE
EXPLAIN WHAT'S GOING ON?

347
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,541
BECAUSE I'M LOST.
- EVIDENTLY, THIS BOY

348
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,541
IS THE REASON THE TEMPLE
IS NOW TILTED.

349
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:14,416
I ASSUME THAT HE DESTROYED
THE SUPPORT PILLARS ON ONE SIDE.

350
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,583
DOING SO CAUSED THE TEMPLE 
TO SHIFT IN THAT DIRECTION.

351
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,208
THIS, IN TURN,
WILL PREVENT

352
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:22,666
ANY MOONLIGHT FROM SHINING
DIRECTLY ONTO DELIORA.

353
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,250
IT'S AN INGENIOUS PLAN.

354
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,875
I'M ACTUALLY QUITE SURPRISED

355
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,041
THAT DOLT WAS THE ONE
WHO CAME UP WITH IT. 

356
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,041
- SO YOU'RE GONNA
FIGHT ME OR WHAT?

357
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,833
- FLAMES SHOOT
FROM HIS FEET?

358
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,208
- WHEN WE FOUGHT THAT GUY,
HE WAS ABLE TO SHOOT FIRE

359
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,541
FROM ALL OVER HIS BODY.

360
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,041
- ( screams )

361
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,791
WHAT THE-- HE'S FAKE?

362
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,208
- ICE MAKE: EAGLE.

363
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,458
YOU CAN'T DODGE THEM
IN MIDAIR.

364
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:04,083
WHAT KIND OF RIDICULOUS
MAGIC IS THIS?

365
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,916
- FIRE DRAGON ROAR!

366
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,166
HUH?
( yelps )

367
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,708
- VERY FORTUNATE,
COLD EMPEROR.

368
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,041
LUCK IS ON YOUR SIDE.

369
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,166
- CAN WE KEEP THE WHOLE
TOBY-GOT-CHARRED THING

370
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,333
A SECRET TOO?

371
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,708
- WHAT DID YOU DO?
- WHATEVER DO YOU MEAN?

372
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,833
- DON'T PLAY DUMB WITH ME.

373
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,291
YOUR MAGIC HAD TO HAVE
CAUSED THAT HOLE IN THE FLOOR.

374
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:32,250
- DON'T YOU HAVE
EVER THE WATCHFUL EYE?

375
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,000
PLEASE ALLOW ME
TO EXPLAIN MY ACTIONS, SIR.

376
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,666
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
STRONG ENOUGH TO DEFEAT DELIORA.

377
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,458
SO IT'S IMPERATIVE
THAT YOU REMAIN SAFE

378
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:40,916
UNTIL ITS RESURRECTION.

379
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,875
- ARE YOU SUGGESTING
THAT I COULD FALL VICTIM

380
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,208
TO SUCH PALTRY MAGIC?

381
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,833
LEAVE ME.

382
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:57,250
I CAN TAKE CARE
OF THIS MYSELF.

383
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,916
ONCE I FINALLY
DEFEAT THE DEMON,

384
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,666
EVERYONE WILL
WORSHIP MY NAME,

385
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,958
COLD EMPEROR LYON.

386
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:06,208
I'VE WORKED TOO HARD TO LET
A BRAT LIKE HIM TARNISH IT.

387
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,041
- AS YOU WISH.

388
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,500
- SO YOU WANT TO
TRY TO DEFEAT DELIORA?

389
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,250
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

390
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,041
HE SERIOUSLY WANTS
TO FIGHT THAT DEMON?

391
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,333
- THE THING LOOKS 
HALF-DEAD ALREADY.

392
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,250
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

393
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,333
YOU'RE GOING TO ALL THIS TROUBLE
TO MELT THAT ICE

394
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,166
JUST SO YOU CAN FIGHT IT?

395
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,625
THAT'S PRETTY MESSED UP
IF YOU ASK ME.

396
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,083
- I MUST RISE ABOVE
UR'S LEGACY.

397
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,458
I WILL NOT REST UNTIL
I'VE FULFILLED MY DREAM.

398
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,583
- WHY GO THIS FAR?

399
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:41,541
CAN'T YOU JUST CHALLENGE HER
AND BE DONE WITH IT?

400
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:46,000
- WELL, I WOULD IF I COULD,
BUT UR HAS BEEN DEAD FOR YEARS.

401
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,708
- Gray: THE WOMAN WHO TAUGHT ME
HOW TO USE MY MAGIC,

402
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:52,791
MY MASTER UR, SACRIFICED
EVERYTHING TO SEAL IT AWAY.

403
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,125
- I DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT SHE ENDED UP DYING

404
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,791
WHEN SHE SEALED IT.
- YES.

405
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,916
BUT SHE'D STILL BE ALIVE
IF IT WASN'T FOR GRAY!

406
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,250
- ( grunts )

407
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:16,583
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOU IN THE PAST,

408
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,750
BUT I DO KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING IN THE PRESENT.

409
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,166
AND IT'S HURTING
A LOT OF INNOCENT PEOPLE.

410
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,625
AND SINCE YOU DON'T SEEM 
TO REALIZE THAT YOURSELF,

411
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,416
I'LL HAVE TO KNOCK
SOME SENSE INTO YOU.

412
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,375
- Gray: EVEN BACK 
WHEN WE WERE KIDS,

413
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:34,041
LYON'S ALWAYS DREAMED OF
SURPASSING UR'S MAGIC ABILITY.

414
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:37,041
BUT SINCE SHE'S GONE AND
HE CAN'T CHALLENGE HER DIRECTLY,

415
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:40,083
HE'S DECIDED THAT IT'S UP TO HIM
TO KILL DELIORA

416
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,125
'CAUSE IT'S THE ONE THING
THAT SHE COULDN'T DO.

417
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,583
- WELL, YEAH.  I GUESS
THAT'D BE THE ONLY WAY

418
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,041
TO CHALLENGE SOMEONE WHO'S DEAD.
- AYE.

419
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,250
- LISTEN, THERE'S SOMETHING--

420
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:52,041
SOMETHING I NEVER
GOT TO TELL HIM. 

421
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,666
I KEPT IT SECRET.

422
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,250
UR MADE ME PROMISE
TO NEVER LET HIM KNOW.

423
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,000
BUT I HAVE TO.

424
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,750
UR MAY NOT BE WITH US,

425
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,166
BUT SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

426
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,125
- ( all gasp )

427
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:21,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

428
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:50,458
- PROFESSOR HAPPY'S CLASS
ABOUT FAIRY TAIL.

429
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:52,250
TODAY I'M GONNA
LET YOU GUYS IN

430
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:53,750
ON A COUPLE OF MY SECRETS.

431
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,708
I'M A WIZARD WHO
PRACTICES AERA MAGIC,

432
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:57,583
WHICH GIVES ME
THE ABILITY TO FLY.

433
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:59,250
I CAN ALSO SPEAK 
JUST LIKE A HUMAN

434
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:00,541
EVEN THOUGH I'M A CAT.

435
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:02,625
AND BEFORE YOU
EVEN BOTHER ASKING,

436
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:05,166
YES, I AM A CAT.  YAY!

437
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,666
OH, YEAH, AND MY FAVORITE FOOD
IN THE WORLD IS FISH.

438
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:12,000
WELL, THAT'S TODAY'S CLASS.
DISMISSED!  AYE!

439
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,625
- Natsu: SO GRAY'S MASTER UR

440
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,583
WAS THE ONE WHO
SEALED AWAY DELIORA, RIGHT?

441
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:18,583
- AYE.
AND SHE WAS ALSO THE WIZARD

442
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,166
WHO TAUGHT HIM ALL
THE COOL ICE MAGIC

443
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,000
THAT HE USES.
- WOW.

444
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:23,583
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN
AN AWESOME TEACHER

445
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:26,000
IF SHE WAS ABLE TO TEACH
A MORON LIKE HIM ANYTHING.

446
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,416
- ALL THIS TALK
MAKES ME WONDER

447
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,875
WHAT HE WAS LIKE BEFORE
HE JOINED THE GUILD.

448
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:32,916
- ( Natsu and Happy speaking )

449
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,083
- Natsu: DO YOU REALLY WANT
TO KNOW WHAT HE WAS LIKE

450
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:36,375
BEFORE FAIRY TAIL?

451
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,333
- Happy: IT'D BE NICE
TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HIM,

452
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:40,083
LIKE WHY HE STRIPS ALL THE TIME.

453
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:41,791
- UGH, I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
