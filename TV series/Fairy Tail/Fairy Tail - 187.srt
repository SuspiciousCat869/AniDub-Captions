1
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:22,416
[HAPPY] Hey, Lucy,
you feeling any better?

2
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,541
Where are we?

3
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:24,625
[PANTHERLILY] Not sure.

4
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,333
[GAJEEL yelling]

5
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:28,333
[blows landing]

6
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,166
Well, this got
boring in a hurry.

7
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,541
You're just wasting
my time, kid.

8
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,541
I'm outta here.

9
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,083
[ROGUE] You don't scare me...

10
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:56,500
[ROGUE] You aren't even
as strong as Natsu Dragneel.

11
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,625
The hell you say?

12
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,041
[FUTURE LUCY] To
make matters worse,

13
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:40,250
we're going to be stuck
behind bars until it happens.

14
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,416
[HAPPY] Whaddya mean "it"?

15
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,791
[WENDY] So, uh, what made
you decide to risk your life

16
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,916
and come here from the future?

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,500
[FUTURE LUCY] To change the
horror that is my past.

18
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,000
Why's it so awful?

19
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,583
Tell us. Maybe we
can help and at least

20
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,416
you won't have to
do it all by yourself.

21
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,583
[FUTURE LUCY whimpers quietly]

22
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:00,833
[FUTURE LUCY] Our
worst nightmares

23
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,000
are about to come to life...

24
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,500
A swarm of more than
ten thousand dragons

25
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,916
are going to attack the kingdom.

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,500
The city will burn,
the castle will fall...

27
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:15,333
And countless lives
are going to be lost.

28
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,625
[ALL gasp]

29
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,416
[HAPPY] Frog!

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,208
[DARTON clears throat]

31
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:33,541
The kingdom is going to be
attacked by a swarm of dragons?!

32
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,791
That's what I was told,
but to be honest,

33
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,000
I find it hard to believe.

34
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,875
I won't believe it.

35
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:43,541
Not until I see how the
Grand Magic Games play out.

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,916
We're...

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,666
so...

38
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,583
dead!

39
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,875
[HAPPY &amp; NATSU] No way!

40
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,333
[PANTHERLILY] Be quiet, please.

41
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,583
More than ten
thousand dragons...

42
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,458
But I thought they
were all extinct.

43
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,666
They're gonna tear
us all to shreds!

44
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,250
Hey, do you think this
could have something to do

45
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,666
with that dragon grave?

46
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,291
I was wondering
that myself...

47
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,833
Well, now that you
mention it...

48
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,833
Seriously! They're
gonna rip us apart!

49
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,291
Pipe down!

50
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,375
You'd think we could
sense that many dragons...

51
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,166
It's possible we
haven't noticed them

52
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,250
because they're
laying low,

53
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,875
waiting for the perfect
time to strike.

54
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,958
We can't just sit around
and wait for that to happen!

55
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,416
We're gonna have to fight 'em!

56
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,625
You gotta be kiddin' me!

57
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,708
We can't take on
that many dragons!

58
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:30,208
You mean... you
actually believe me?

59
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,583
Wait, you were lyin'?!

60
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:34,208
[FUTURE LUCY] No!
I would never lie to you!

61
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,000
It's just that I
honestly didn't think

62
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:39,041
you were going to believe me.
I'm surprised, that's all.

63
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,500
You're one of us, which means

64
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,500
we don't have any
reason to doubt you.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,750
[FUTURE LUCY giggles]

66
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,583
You really need to get
it together, future me.

67
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,083
Don'tcha think you should have
more faith in your friends?

68
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,750
[FUTURE LUCY] Am I
seriously lecturing myself?

69
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,916
But I guess you've
got a good point.

70
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,583
[CARLA thinking] Now it's
all coming together...

71
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,791
Mercurius crumbling...

72
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,666
Lucy singing
inside the castle...

73
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:13,000
Wait, she wasn't singing...
She must have been crying!

74
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,875
But why? What could've happened?

75
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,458
[CARLA] Excuse me. If
I'm not mistaken, we're still

76
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,458
inside the castle when
the dragons attack.

77
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,125
What happens to us?

78
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,083
[WENDY] I'm scared.
I don't think I wanna know.

79
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,250
I've got a feeling we
won't like her answer.

80
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,541
[NATSU] You don't think...
we're gonna end up goners?

81
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,791
[MIRAJANE] Oh, my...

82
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:40,500
No, that can't be right.
Are we really gonna die?

83
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,333
[YUKINO thinking] Once
again, I bring misfortune

84
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,125
to everyone around me...

85
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:53,750
[explosions]

86
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:59,250
[DRAGONS roaring]

87
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,375
[roaring]

88
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,916
[LUCY gasps]

89
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,125
[LUCY] No! Natsu!

90
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,208
[FUTURE LUCY] I'm
afraid I don't remember

91
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,583
what day it was.
But when I came to...

92
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,666
I knew I had no choice
but to use the Eclipse.

93
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,166
I had no idea
how to operate it,

94
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,791
but I was somehow
able to get it open...

95
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:47,416
I was determined to go back
in time and warn someone.

96
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,583
[FUTURE LUCY] I
was desperate...

97
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:56,208
I doubted whether it would
work, but I had to try.

98
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,041
And then suddenly
it was July fourth.

99
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,541
of the year seven-ninety-one.

100
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,791
Hey, wait a second, but that
was just a few days ago!

101
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,416
Does that mean
it's only capable

102
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,833
of making small
jumps back in time?

103
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,666
[WENDY] But I thought it
was supposed to go back

104
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,375
four-hundred years
to defeat Zeref?

105
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,333
[FUTURE LUCY] I don't
know all the details...

106
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,750
Maybe it was broken,

107
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,833
so it wasn't able to take
me back that far in time.

108
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,750
[ARCADIOS thinking] It
all makes sense now...

109
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,375
This girl is the mysterious
person from the future

110
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:25,125
who advised the princess.

111
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,958
Something's not
right... I can feel it...

112
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,541
[FUTURE LUCY] If you make
it out of the castle,

113
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,833
you'll need to rendezvous
with Jellal, but be careful

114
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,625
because there are
lacrimas all over the city

115
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,083
monitoring the games.

116
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,875
That means you'll have to
take an underground route

117
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:37,625
to meet with him.

118
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,000
How is he involved?

119
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,500
[FUTURE LUCY] I've
explained everything to him

120
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,041
as best I can...

121
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,791
I'm sure that he's busy coming
up with a plan as we speak.

122
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,875
Why's he coming
up with the plan?

123
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:51,000
[FUTURE LUCY] It's my fault.
I'm really sorry.

124
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:55,000
I probably should've come here
with some sort of strategy...

125
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:58,250
But, to be honest. I don't know
what we can do to prevent it.

126
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,833
I needed his help.

127
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,083
[ARCADIOS thinking]
Just as I thought...

128
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,666
[ARCADIOS] Princess?!
Did you say "from the future"?

129
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,833
[HISUI] Yes. I know it
sounds insane but hear me out.

130
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,333
They said here's another
way to use the gate.

131
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,625
They called it "Eclipse Two".

132
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,333
[ARCADIOS] There is?
What does it entail?

133
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,291
I don't know if you
are aware of this,

134
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:30,125
but for the last seven years
we've used the games to store

135
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,250
magic power within this gate.

136
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:36,291
The magic we've accumulated
within that time is now

137
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,666
as powerful as an
Etherion blast.

138
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,291
What?!

139
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:43,333
It's on par with the sacred
light of the Magic Council?!

140
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,708
But it's said that a
single Etherion blast

141
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,875
can destroy an entire nation!

142
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,500
[HISUI] This wealth of
magic power is the core

143
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:51,833
of the Eclipse Two.

144
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:55,583
And we shall unleash it
onto the swarm of dragons.

145
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,708
[ARCADIOS thinking]
I don't understand...

146
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,208
She's got to be the one
who told the princess

147
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,208
about the Eclipse Two...

148
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:10,791
which means she's lying
about arriving on the fourth.

149
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,750
Why would she choose
to deceive her friends?

150
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,083
I'm really sorry, you guys.
I hope you can forgive me.

151
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,041
I know I should've
found you sooner.

152
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,583
But I was just at a
complete loss on what to do

153
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,583
besides just trying to warn you.

154
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,000
[NATSU] Chin up...

155
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:33,500
There's no need
for you to apologize.

156
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,333
I'd like to thank you.

157
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,166
You risked your life
for us; for our future.

158
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,916
[FUTURE LUCY sobs]

159
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,416
[WENDY giggles]

160
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,083
[LUCY] Hm...

161
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,708
[NATSU] We're gonna
find a way to stop 'em.

162
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,166
You just watch.

163
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,833
[ULTEAR] What do you mean
it's not necessarily true?

164
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,208
Oh, come on!

165
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,791
You don't honestly think
Lucy could be lying to us?

166
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,791
Why would she
do such a thing?

167
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,000
[JELLAL] More than
ten thousand dragons.

168
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,083
The Eclipse...

169
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,333
That strange magic power...

170
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:22,166
The pieces of the puzzle
just don't fit together.

171
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,541
What are you saying?

172
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,041
That she may have some
ulterior motive in crafting

173
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,875
this version of the future.

174
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm not sure whether
this Lucy's words are false

175
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:35,041
or whether her entire being
is actually a fabrication.

176
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:43,958
[ROGUE panting]

177
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,875
Aw man, my ears must
be playin' tricks on me.

178
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,041
Coulda swore you said
I'm not as strong as Natsu.

179
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,833
[FROSCH] Poor Rogue...

180
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,666
[ROGUE laughs]

181
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,125
What's funny?

182
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:03,625
I always wondered why you
decided to join Fairy Tail.

183
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,583
It's taken me a while,
but I think that I've

184
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,000
finally figured it out.

185
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,291
[GAJEEL] Oh yeah?
Let's hear it.

186
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:12,250
[ROGUE] You've probably
forgotten all about it by now,

187
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,958
and I don't blame you because
it was such a long time ago.

188
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,416
[ROGUE] I was just
a kid back then.

189
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,041
A snot-nosed punk who looked up
to your guild, Phantom Lord.

190
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,250
As a kid, my biggest
dream in life was to

191
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,416
become a member of that
guild when I grew up.

192
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,875
Unfortunately, I never
got the chance...

193
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,375
They were forced to
disband when they

194
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,125
challenged Fairy Tail and lost.

195
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,958
And of all the guilds
you could have joined,

196
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,083
you chose the
most despicable.

197
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,708
You joined Fairy Tail.

198
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,166
[ROGUE] I was absolutely
heartbroken...

199
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,375
I couldn't believe that you
would pick the scoundrels

200
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:54,291
who destroyed Phantom Lord.

201
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,625
I was so confused...

202
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,250
Deep down I knew there
had to be a reason,

203
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,750
but I couldn't figure
it out for the life of me.

204
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:08,083
[ROGUE] That is, until now...

205
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:11,125
You wanted friends...
didn't you?

206
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,041
[ROGUE] The very
notion of friendship

207
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,291
doesn't exist in Sabertooth.

208
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,875
We were nothing but our
master's foot soldiers.

209
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,333
Forced to his follow
his orders, or else.

210
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:25,375
If we were defeated,
he'd make us pay.

211
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,916
When you're in a guild,
you don't ever.

212
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,375
turn your back on friends.

213
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,541
[ROGUE] I don't really know
what it's like to be in a guild

214
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,916
because I don't have friends.

215
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,500
I'm so lost...

216
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,416
I have no idea what I've been
fighting for all of this time.

217
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:42,958
[ROGUE] I've realized
that friendship

218
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,333
is what makes your
guild so powerful.

219
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:48,291
That's why we
never measured up.

220
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:52,208
The only exceptions are M'lady,
who's unbelievably strong...

221
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:55,708
And Sting, whose true power
awoke for Lector's sake.

222
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:00,958
[GAJEEL] Dumbass.

223
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,958
That's the biggest load
of bull I've ever heard.

224
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,375
[GAJEEL chuckles]

225
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,708
Sure looks like you
got a friend to me.

226
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:11,791
That frog.

227
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,125
What frog?

228
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,875
Hey, I think he's
talkin' about me!

229
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,750
Frosch is a cat,
you idiot!

230
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,541
Well, If you wanna get
technical, he's an Exceed.

231
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,833
Ain't he?

232
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:35,750
[ROGUE] You know, you're
right. Frosch is my friend.

233
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,583
Your best friend!

234
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,375
Thanks for reminding
me of that.

235
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,500
[VOICE] Rogue...

236
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,500
[VOICE] Face forward.

237
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,666
That man standing
in front of you?

238
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,500
He is your enemy.

239
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,500
Where is that voice
coming from?!

240
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,458
[GAJEEL] Uh... You okay, kid?

241
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,125
[VOICE] Rogue...

242
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,333
You must kill Gajeel.

243
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:09,875
Who are you?! And
why can't I see you?!

244
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,708
[VOICE] You have
to kill him.

245
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,625
It is your destiny.

246
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,166
[ROGUE] Show yourself!

247
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,458
[VOICE] You fool.

248
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:26,208
[VOICE] That's right.
I am your shadow.

249
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,583
[SHADOW ROGUE] I'll lend
you my strength...

250
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,291
Now go, and
strike him down.

251
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,583
It's this way!

252
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,625
You wanna tell us how you knew
about this underground path?

253
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,458
I spent some time
exploring the castle

254
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,708
so I'd know how to get us outta
here without being caught.

255
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,166
It's the least I could do.

256
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,458
Well played, Miss.

257
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,250
Future Lucy's way
smarter than the normal one.

258
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,750
[MIRAJANE] We need to hurry
and fire the signal flare.

259
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:01,958
Yeah, no kidding!

260
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,041
I'll bet the others
are worried sick by now.

261
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,166
[SOLDIERS yelling]

262
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,208
[SOLDIER A] There they are!

263
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,083
[SOLDIER B] Capture
the fugitives!

264
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:11,958
[SOLDIER C] Let's get 'em, men!

265
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,500
The royal army?!

266
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,666
I swear I didn't know they
were stationed here, you guys!

267
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,791
What'll we do?!

268
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,500
We show 'em who's boss!

269
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,166
We've got magic so they don't
stand a chance against us!

270
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,541
 Ain't that the truth!]

271
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,916
[WENDY] We've got a problem!

272
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,375
Colonel Arcadios
is missing!

273
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,833
Yukino's gone too!

274
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,208
What?

275
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,458
But they were both right
behind us just a second ago!

276
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,541
Arcadios is one thing,
but we can't leave Yukino...

277
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,625
I'm going back for her!

278
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:40,750
[PANTHERLILY] Hey, wait!

279
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,083
[LUCY] We need to
stick together!

280
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,208
I'll come back as
soon as I find her!

281
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,875
We're countin'
on ya, Mira...

282
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,291
'Kay, you ready
for this, buddy?

283
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,375
Hell yeah...

284
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:49,958
[BOTH] Let's kick some ass!

285
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,708
[SOLDIER D] Now, men! Attack!

286
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,458
[NATSU shouting]

287
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,916
[SOLDIERS yelling]

288
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,500
[WENDY thinking] Please...
Be careful, Mira...

289
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,666
[LUCY thinking] I hope
Yukino's okay...

290
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,125
Don't you worry about a
thing; I'm here to protect you!

291
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,458
[CARLA thinking] I've got
this strange feeling...

292
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,583
If only there was
something I could do...

293
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:21,416
[ROGUE grunting]

294
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,416
[GAJEEL] Hey, man.
Are you feelin' alright?

295
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,000
[SHADOW ROGUE]
Go on and kill Gajeel.

296
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:31,000
You must... For it
is my destiny.

297
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,458
[ROGUE grunting]

298
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,583
What the hell's
gotten into you?

299
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,750
[SHADOW ROGUE] I'll lend
you my strength.

300
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:41,833
[ROGUE screaming]

301
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,625
Gajeel!

302
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:47,875
[MAN A] What brought that
on all of a sudden?!

303
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:48,916
[MAN B] I dunno!

304
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,208
Did he say somethin' to offend
him?

305
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,791
You don't wanna
mess with me.

306
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:59,500
This is the kind of power that
we can wield together, Rogue.

307
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:02,541
So let us strike him down
without any more hesitation!

308
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,250
Who are you?!

309
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,041
[SHADOW ROGUE] Who am I?

310
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:10,708
One who controls
destiny: A shadow.

311
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,666
[GAJEEL] What kinda
nonsensical crap is that?!

312
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,916
[GAJEEL grunts]

313
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I dunno what your
deal is, pal,

314
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:20,041
but it sounds like you wanna
do some real fightin'...

315
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,375
Bring it on.

316
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,083
I don't understand
why they're fightin'

317
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,083
all of a sudden; I thought
they'd just made peace.

318
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,791
There's definitely
something strange going on.

319
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,750
Come on! Wipe the
floor with that jerk!

320
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,416
Iron Dragon Sword!

321
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,583
[GAJEEL grunts]

322
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,708
Shadow Dragon
Waxwing Flash.

323
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,041
This is awful!

324
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,750
Why, Rogue...?

325
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:52,333
What's with you?!

326
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,708
[GAJEEL] Where'd he go?!

327
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,000
[SHADOW ROGUE]
Right behind you.

328
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,666
[SHADOW ROGUE]
Shadow Dragon Slash!

329
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,416
What's happening,
First Master?!

330
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,125
He's been possessed by
someone or something.

331
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,291
[GAJEEL grunting]

332
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:10,875
What?! But Gajeel grabbed
him in shadow form a second ago!

333
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,208
[LEVY] It's almost like
his magic is changing.

334
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,916
[MAVIS thinking] This magic...
It's an incredibly evil power...

335
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,291
In all my years, I've
never seen anything like it.

336
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,708
[SHADOW ROGUE]
Rogue was right...

337
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:25,125
You're not nearly as
strong as Natsu Dragneel.

338
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,708
That's what
you think, bub.

339
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,458
[SHADOW ROGUE] I'm merely
speaking the truth...

340
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,875
Not that Natsu Dragneel
is any match for me.

341
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,750
Do you feel
that power?!

342
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,208
I definitely do!

343
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,666
[ULTEAR] It's coming
from the city.

344
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,208
[JELLAL] Calm down...

345
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,291
The future Lucy has been
caught in the fighting

346
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,333
so we must tread carefully.

347
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,375
As long as Natsu's
group is with her,

348
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,333
there's no need to act rashly.

349
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,416
[PANTHERLILY] Be careful, Lucy!

350
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,000
I'll be fine!

351
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:01,666
[WENDY shouts]

352
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,291
[SOLDIERS screaming]

353
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,791
These kids are a lot stronger
than I thought they were!

354
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,083
[SOLDIER F] Better call
the Anti-Magic Squad!

355
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:11,416
[SOLDIER G] Can't let these
brats get the best of us!

356
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,291
[NATSU shouting]

357
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,750
[SOLDIERS yelling]

358
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,000
[NATSU grunts]

359
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,541
[MAGIC SOLDIER A] A direct hit!

360
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,291
[MAGIC SOLDIER B] Waves two
and three, be prepared to fire!

361
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,041
[CARLA] Did they
just use magic?!

362
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,666
[HAPPY] It sure looked like it!

363
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,875
Who are they?!

364
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,708
They must be some kind
of specialized unit!

365
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,250
[NATSU] Ya caught me off guard.

366
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:35,208
With magic that weak, I wouldn't
quit your day job, guys.

367
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,666
[MAGIC SOLDIER C] It had
no effect!

368
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,291
[MAGIC SOLDIER B] Is this
kid some kind of a monster?!

369
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,625
[MAGIC SOLDIER A] So what now?!

370
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,666
[VOICE] Heya! Sorry
for the wait, gentlemen!

371
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,625
Not you again!

372
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,166
We don't need
your help!

373
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,083
[MAGIC SOLDIER B] Yeah, get
lost, ya dolphin-lovin' freak!

374
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,666
[NATSU] Who are you
just bustin' in here?!

375
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,541
I swear it wasn't
on porpoise!

376
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,125
Who am I?

377
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,666
The hottest magic soldier the
Kingdom of Fiore has to offer.

378
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,000
And he's really heavy!

379
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,750
What is the deal
with this guy?

380
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,833
Do you think he's a wizard?
Or is he a celestial spirit?

381
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,500
Never seen a
spirit like that.

382
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,208
Is it punishment
time yet, Princess?

383
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,958
Now behold my magnificence
as I dive headlong

384
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,916
into battle for lovely
Princess Hisui!

385
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,708
My ball! Gimme that!

386
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:13,541
[MAGIC SOLDIERS yelling]

387
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,416
Why'd that weirdo
take out his men?

388
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,333
That is one
angry-lookin' fishie!

389
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,416
It's not a fish,
it's a mammal.

390
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,708
[NATSU grunting]

391
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,958
Wow, you're pretty strong
for an overgrown tuna!

392
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,041
[DOLPHIN] We might
not be the smartest,

393
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,750
but we got plenty of stamina!

394
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,500
Oh, yeah? Your
buddy's out cold.

395
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,250
I can't go on. Sorry!

396
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,500
Seriously?!

397
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,708
[NATSU] Alrighty then.
If you're the hottest,

398
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,083
then the heat I throw at
you should be no problem!

399
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,458
Go ahead and
do your worst;

400
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,625
a warrior like me ain't
afraid of a little fire!

401
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,291
Geez, You're
sweating buckets!

402
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,041
[NATSU] Fire Dragon Iron Fist!

403
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,250
[BOTH] What a terrible FIN-ale!

404
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,500
[CROWD mumuring]

405
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:56,125
[GAJEEL grunting]

406
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,916
[SHADOW ROGUE laughs]

407
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,791
It's hard to believe that
I once looked up to you...

408
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,416
How pathetic.

409
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,083
[GAJEEL groans]

410
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,708
He's gonna end up killing
him if he doesn't let go!

411
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,250
Gajeel!

412
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,291
[FROSCH] I gotta help him...

413
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:16,125
I gotta get Rogue back
before it's too late!

414
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,458
[SHADOW ROGUE]
It won't be long until

415
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,416
the shadows have eaten you away.

416
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,041
Once they've had their fill,
this world will be free of you.

417
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:27,125
You'll vanish. Forced to
sleep in eternal darkness.

418
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,625
[GAJEEL chuckles]

419
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,208
[GAJEEL] If Salamander
can pull it off,

420
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,958
then I sure as hell can too.

421
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,666
[SHADOW ROGUE] What?!

422
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,333
[GAJEEL laughs]

423
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,000
What have you done?!

424
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,958
[LEVY] No way...
He ate the shadows?!

425
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,708
That's one of the most
impressive feats I've seen.

426
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:53,083
He used his power to consume
and absorb the shadow.

427
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,750
[GAJEEL] I dunno who you are,

428
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,541
but you better get out
of his body, or else!

429
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,541
[SHADOW ROGUE] You want
me to leave Rogue?

430
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,791
[GAJEEL] You'd think you'd get
to know more about the kid

431
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,291
before you go and possess him.

432
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,750
His name ain't Rogue,
it's Raios;

433
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,583
and he's my sworn brother.

434
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:12,333
[GAJEEL] You can say you looked
up to me all you want...

435
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:15,666
But you know as well as
I do that ain't the truth...

436
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,208
'cause I wasn't that
kinda guy back then.

437
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,250
Be honest
with yourself.

438
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,875
You didn't look up to me,
you feared me.

439
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,875
I was never afraid...!

440
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,916
[GAJEEL] Maybe you forgot

441
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,500
'cause I'm such a
nice guy these days...

442
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:33,916
But I'll make you
remember your fear!

443
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,250
I don't believe it...
An Iron Shadow Dragon?!

444
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:15,625
[NATSU] Whoa! Did ya see that?!
Gajeel went and ate a shadow!

445
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:16,916
[HAPPY] Like you have
any right to talk!

446
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,041
You eat fire,
for cryin' out loud!

447
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,125
[NATSU] So? Munchin'
on fire is nothin'

448
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:22,458
like gobblin' up a shadow!

449
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:24,458
Fire is for eatin'
and it tastes great!

450
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:25,791
[HAPPY] I guess I
can't argue with ya

451
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:27,041
since I've never tasted it...

452
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:28,291
[NATSU] I just don't get
why anyone would ever

453
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,625
wanna eat a shadow.
It's weird, y'know?

454
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:31,958
[HAPPY] I don't really
think it's any weirder

455
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:33,166
than eatin' fire.

456
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,416
[HAPPY &amp; NATSU] Next time:
Roaring Thunder!

457
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,791
[NATSU] Tell you what, how
'bout I take you to a place

458
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,166
where you can eat
some amazing fire?

459
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,375
[HAPPY] Thanks, Natsu,
but I think I'll pass.
