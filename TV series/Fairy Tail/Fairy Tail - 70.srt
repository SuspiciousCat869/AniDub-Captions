1
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,291
- Gray: PREVIOUSLY, ON "FAIRY
TAIL"... - Happy: GRAY TOLD US

2
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,666
SOMEONE NAMED DAPHNE
SAID SHE'D MET A DRAGON.

3
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,416
SO WE WENT TO THE
RISE LODGE TO SEE

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,000
IF WE COULD FIND OUT THE TRUTH.

5
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:28,083
- Carla: I SENSED SOMETHING WAS
OFF, AND OF COURSE I WAS RIGHT.

6
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,416
NOW I'M TRAPPED
WITH THIS MORONIC TOMCAT.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,500
- Daphne: YES YES YES, I'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR YOU, DRAGON SLAYERS.

8
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:36,083
- Natsu: WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT THE
HECK IS GRAY DOING HERE?

9
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:40,625
- ( theme music playing )

10
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:57,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

11
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,250
- Wendy: HE LOOKS MAD!

12
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,166
- Happy: PLEASE LET THIS
BE A BAD DREAM.

13
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,166
- GET BEHIND ME.
JUST DO IT.

14
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,000
HE'S NOT JOKING AROUND.

15
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,500
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS, GRAY?

16
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,291
IS IT 'CAUSE
YOU HAVE A TUMMY ACHE?

17
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,458
- DON'T BE SUCH AN IDIOT!
- PLEASE DON'T FIGHT.

18
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:32,333
- STAY OUT OF OUR WAY.
ICE MAKE LANCE!

19
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,541
- HE ATTACKED HIM
USING HIS FULL STRENGTH.

20
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:37,875
- STAY CLOSE TO ME,
UNDERSTAND?

21
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,208
- YOU TWO HAVE ALWAYS
BUTTED HEADS,

22
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:43,583
BUT THERE'S NO NEED FOR THIS.
- HA HA HA!

23
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,458
MY MY.  YOU JUST DON'T GET IT,
DO YOU?

24
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,541
START FIGHTING BACK OR YOU'LL
END UP SKEWERED OR A POPSICLE.

25
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:53,208
NOW, GRAY FULLBUSTER,
GO GET ME A DRAGON SLAYER!

26
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,833
- YOU'LL GET ONE SOON ENOUGH.

27
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,625
- THIS ISN'T LIKE YOU
AT ALL, GRAY.

28
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,416
WHAT'S GOING ON?
- ISN'T IT OBVIOUS BY NOW?

29
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,541
WHAT I WANNA KNOW IS WHY
YOU'RE STANDING THERE

30
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:02,750
DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT.

31
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,625
- YOU THINK THIS GRAY
IS A FAKE?

32
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,166
- I SUPPOSE IT'S POSSIBLE.

33
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,708
WE HAVE SEEN MAGIC
LIKE THAT BEFORE,

34
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,916
BUT I'M NOT SURE-- 
- NO, WENDY'S RIGHT.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,541
THIS ONE'S DEFINITELY DIFFERENT
THAN THE GRAY WE KNOW AND LOVE.

36
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,500
- HOW IS HE DIFFERENT?
HE SEEMS IDENTICAL.

37
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:22,125
- WELL, FOR STARTERS--
AH!

38
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,583
- IF YOU KEEP DODGING,
THIS'LL GET BORING.

39
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,291
COME ON!
- HE TOOK HIS CLOTHES OFF!

40
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,375
THIS GUY IS THE REAL GRAY
AFTER ALL.

41
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,625
- Both: ARE YOU KIDDING?

42
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:35,708
- ( Happy speaking )

43
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:38,875
- IF IT'S A REAL FIGHT YOU WANT,
YOU KNOW I'M DOWN.

44
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,583
- IT'S ABOUT TIME.

45
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,083
I WAS STARTIN' TO GET BORED.
ICE MAKE BATTLE AXE!

46
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,083
- FIRE DRAGON ROAR!

47
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,666
- YES YES,
THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT.

48
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,083
THERE'S NOTHING QUITE LIKE
DINNER AND A GOOD SHOW.

49
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:59,000
AS YOU CAN SEE, THAT'S NO CHEAP
IMITATION PUNCHING YOU.

50
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:02,708
THAT'S THE GENUINE GRAY.

51
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,708
I PROMISE I'M NOT
CONTROLLING HIS MIND

52
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,208
OR ANYTHING CLICHE LIKE THAT.

53
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:10,250
HE'S BEATING YOUR FACE IN
SIMPLY BECAUSE HE WANTS TO.

54
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,458
- I DON'T NEED YOU
TO FIGURE THAT ONE OUT.

55
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:15,333
I'VE FELT
THAT IRRITATING PUNCH PLENTY.

56
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,625
NO FAKE GRAY COULD EVER HOPE
TO PULL IT OFF.

57
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,750
- YA KNOW, I HAD A FEELING
YOU WERE LETTING ME HIT YOU

58
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,291
SO YOU COULD TEST ME,
OR SOMETHING STUPID LIKE THAT.

59
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,000
- FIRE DRAGON TALON!

60
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,583
WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED.

61
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,000
- YOU CAN WIN THIS!

62
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,833
- THOSE TWO
ARE SUCH BARBARIANS.

63
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,583
- IT'S TIME FOR SOME ANSWERS.

64
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,541
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT
YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING HERE.

65
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,625
AT THE VERY LEAST YOU OWE ME
THAT MUCH.

66
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,625
- A CITY WITHOUT SOUND.

67
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:47,083
- WHAT WAS THAT? YOU'RE NOT
MAKING ANY SENSE, MAN.

68
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,750
WOULD YOU SPEAK PLAINLY?

69
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,875
- THAT'S AS PLAIN
AS YOU'RE GONNA GET.

70
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,125
WHATEVER, I DOUBT
YOU'D UNDERSTAND IT ANYWAY.

71
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,166
GET READY TO TAKE
YOUR LAST BREATH.

72
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,541
- THE TWO OF THEM HAVE REALLY
STEPPED UP THEIR GAME LATELY.

73
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,041
- THIS IS NOT THE TIME
FOR SLACK-JAWED GAWKING.

74
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,166
- AYE. - I DON'T GET
WHY THIS IS HAPPENING.

75
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,416
WHY WOULD GRAY BETRAY
HIS FRIENDS LIKE THIS?

76
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,916
- NOT THAT IT'S
ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS,

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,958
BUT THAT HANDSOME SLAB
OF ICE

78
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,291
OFFERED TO HELP ME ON A SPECIAL
PROJECT. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

79
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,708
- I FIRST ARRIVED
IN MAGNOLIA ABOUT 10 DAYS AGO

80
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,916
TO CONTINUE MY RESEARCH.
I WAS DOING SOME DIGGING

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
INTO NATSU DRAGNEEL'S
BACKGROUND, WHEN I--

82
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,708
( swallows ) --WHEN I RAN
INTO GRAY FULLBUSTER.

83
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,958
HE SHOWED INTEREST
IN MY PROJECT

84
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,250
AND WAS VERY WILLING TO LEND
HIS HAND TOWARDS COMPLETING IT.

85
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,833
SO HE LURED
THE SALAMANDER HERE FOR ME.

86
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,333
HE'S QUITE THE CATCH,
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?

87
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,666
- COLD-BLOODED BETRAYAL,
PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

88
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,166
- NO WAY.
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT.

89
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,500
- I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING
GOING ON BETWEEN YOU TWO.

90
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,541
YOU AND GRAY...

91
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,666
ARE GETTING
ALL LOVEY-DOVEY!

92
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,625
- MAYBE.
- HOW SCANDALOUS!

93
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,333
WHEN JUVIA FINDS OUT
ABOUT THIS,

94
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,666
SHE'S GONNA MORE VICIOUS
THAN ALL OF

95
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,000
THE ORACION SEIS COMBINED!

96
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,708
- COULD YOU BE
ANY MORE OBNOXIOUS?

97
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,000
SHUT UP, GET OVER HERE, AND I
DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANOTHER PEEP.

98
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,375
- I'M SORRY, CARLA.
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

99
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,625
- OKAY, SO YOU AND GRAY
ARE PARTNERS NOW,

100
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,458
BUT WHAT IS THIS
CITY WITHOUT SOUND?

101
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,416
AND WHAT'S YOUR INTEREST
IN NATSU?

102
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,625
I DON'T UNDERSTA--

103
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,625
- YES YES,
YOUR QUESTIONS CAN WAIT.

104
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,458
FOR NOW, HOW ABOUT SAMPLIN'
ONE OF METAMO-CHAN'S FLAVORS?

105
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,916
- WHO COULD POSSIBLY EAT
THAT TRIPE AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,125
- OH YEAH, GIVE ME ONE
OF THE FISHY FLAVORED KIND.

107
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,708
- DO YOU HAVE A SINGLE SHRED
OF SELF-CONTROL?

108
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,666
- MMMM!  AHHH!

109
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,000
- Daphne: GOT A KICK, DON'T IT?

110
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,791
YOU WANT A NIBBLE?

111
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,208
- Wendy: WHO IS THIS LADY?

112
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,958
- COME ON!
I'M ALL FIRED UP NOW.

113
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:33,166
BEEN AWHILE SINCE MY BLOOD
WAS BOILING OVER LIKE THIS.

114
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,166
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL ME
WHAT'S GOIN' ON,

115
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,208
I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO BEAT IT
OUT OF YOU.

116
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,291
AHHH!

117
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,375
- Erza: THEY'RE LATE.

118
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,291
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY
BE HOLDING THEM UP?

119
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:49,166
IT DOESN'T TAKE THIS LONG
TO FOLLOW A SIMPLE LEAD.

120
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,500
- HE WAS ASKING SOMEONE
ABOUT THE DRAGON SIGHTING.

121
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,458
YOU THINK HE FOUND
WHAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR?

122
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,958
- MAYBE NATSU'S PLAYING CATCH-UP
WITH IGNEEL RIGHT NOW.

123
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,291
- OR HE GOT TIRED
OF CHASING RUMORS, GOT FED UP,

124
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,083
AND CALLED IT A NIGHT.
- NO.

125
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,375
NORMALLY I'D AGREE,
BUT NATSU HAD WENDY WITH HIM.

126
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,833
HE WOULD'VE
BROUGHT HER BACK FIRST.

127
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,541
- SALAMANDER MIGHT BE RECKLESS,

128
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,791
BUT HE WOULDN'T KEEP A KID
OUT THIS LATE AT NIGHT.

129
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,583
THAT'S JUST
NOT THE KIND OF MAN HE IS.

130
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,416
- WHAT'S MORE,
WE STILL DON'T KNOW

131
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,458
WHAT BECAME OF MY ATTACKER
FROM EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON.

132
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,291
HE COULD'VE
AMBUSHED THEM TOO.

133
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,958
- I'M AFRAID THAT GRAY
IS OUT THERE NEEDING MY HELP.

134
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,875
WE SHOULD FORM A SEARCH PARTY
IMMEDIATELY.

135
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,625
IF SOMETHING'S
HAPPENED TO HIM,

136
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,583
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF
FOR NOT BEING THERE.

137
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:26,041
- GRAY'S A BIG BOY.
HE CAN TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF.

138
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,000
- SERIOUSLY,
YOU WORRY WAY TOO MUCH.

139
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,333
IT'S BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH.

140
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,708
- YOU'D BE WISE
NOT TO UNDERESTIMATE

141
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,916
THE INTUITION OF A WOMAN
MADLY IN LOVE.

142
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,208
- SHE'S DEFINITELY GOT THE MAD
PART DOWN TO A "T."

143
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,083
- AT LEAST WE'RE NOT DROWNING
IN HER TEARS.

144
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,666
- I'M GOING TO LOOK FOR THEM.
LUCY, YOU'RE WITH ME.

145
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,000
- JUST LEAD THE WAY.
- I WILL ACCOMPANY YOU AS WELL.

146
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,333
- YOU'RE GONNA NEED A
MAN WITH YOU. - NO.

147
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,458
WE CAN'T DIVIDE OUR FORCES
SO THINLY.

148
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,875
REMAIN ON STANDBY
AND GUARD THE HALL.

149
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:52,375
- WE'LL DO OUR PART.
CAREFUL OUT THERE, YOU TWO.

150
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,958
- YOU WON'T GET PAST MY--
ICE MAKE SHIELD!

151
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,666
- FIRE DRAGON TALON!

152
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:13,000
- ICE MAKE FLOOR!

153
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,375
- AHH!

154
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,791
- GEEZ, YOU'RE PATHETIC.
- YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.

155
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,583
YOU TRAITOR!

156
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:31,708
FIRE DRAGON WING ATTACK!

157
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,625
- DON'T HURT EACH OTHER.

158
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,958
- THIS FIGHT COULD LAST
TILL THE END OF EXISTENCE.

159
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,916
- Carla: DON'T BE SO DRAMATIC.
AT THE RATE THEY'RE GOING,

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,541
THEY'LL WEAR THEMSELVES OUT.

161
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,708
- Happy: YOU CAN DO IT, NATSU!

162
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,750
- FIRE DRAGON FLAME ELBOW!

163
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,375
- IT'S A POOL.

164
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:58,291
- GRAY JUST GOT
THE FIELD ADVANTAGE.

165
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:03,208
- YOU'RE GOING DOWN NOW.
GOOD LUCK DODGING THIS.

166
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,625
ICE MAKE PRISON!

167
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,041
- OH, THIS IS SO
NOT PLAYING FAIR!

168
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,208
LET ME OUTTA HERE AND FIGHT
LIKE A MAN.

169
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,166
COME ON, IT'S COLD. 
- YES YES YES.

170
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,208
NOT ONLY IS HE GOOD LOOKING,
BUT IT APPEARS

171
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,166
HE'S QUITE
THE BRILLIANT TACTICIAN.

172
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,041
I KNEW PARTNERING WITH HIM
WAS A SMART MOVE.

173
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:22,125
- YOU BELONG IN A CAGE, HA.
- I'M NOT SOME WILD BEAST, JERK!

174
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,583
FIRE DRAGON ROAR!

175
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,208
DARN IT,
I CAN'T SEE A THING.

176
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,166
- YOU FELL FOR IT, MORON.
- SON OF A--

177
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,416
- ICE MAKE LANCE!

178
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,041
I THINK WE BOTH KNEW DEEP DOWN

179
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,083
THAT THIS
WAS GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY.

180
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:44,541
FIRE AND ICE JUST DON'T MIX.

181
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,416
- IF THAT'S HOW YOU REALLY FEEL,

182
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,000
THEN I'M NOT HOLDING BACK
ANYMORE.

183
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,541
- TIME TO SAY GOODBYE.

184
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,958
- I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.

185
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,541
GOODBYE!

186
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,708
- NATSU! - Carla: THEY'RE
ON THE SECOND FLOOR.

187
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,625
LET'S HURRY. 
- Wendy: OKAY.

188
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,500
NATSU!
YOU OKAY?

189
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,416
I KNOW YOU WON'T AGREE,

190
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,833
BUT THE ONLY WAY WE CAN STOP 'EM
IS WITH MY SKY DRAGON MAGIC.

191
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,750
- NO, CHILD.
I KNOW YOU WANT TO HELP,

192
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,583
BUT USING YOUR MAGIC
IN THESE TIGHT QUARTERS

193
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,625
COULD SERIOUSLY INJURE SOMEONE.
- FINE.

194
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,125
I'M FLYING BACK TO TOWN
FOR REINFORCEMENTS.

195
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,958
BE BACK!
- WAIT, DON'T TOUCH THE--

196
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,791
- YOUR STUPIDITY IS PAINFUL
TO WITNESS.

197
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,625
- YES YES, THERE'S NO ESCAPING.
IT'S POINTLESS TO RESIST,

198
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,000
SO WHY DON'T YOU TRY
TO RELAX FOR A WHILE?

199
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,125
- THE ONLY WAY OUTTA HERE
IS TO BEAT HER UP!

200
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,708
- WHILE YOU WAIT,

201
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:34,125
PLEASE ENJOY SOME
OF THE LEAFY GREEN VARIETY.

202
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,083
- GROSS!

203
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,125
- LIKE I SAID,
ESCAPE IS IMPOSSIBLE.

204
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,041
THIS LODGE IS MY ILLUSION,

205
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,041
SO IF I WANT YOU TO
STAY, YOU STAY.

206
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,875
- THIS LODGE ISN'T EVEN REAL?

207
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,958
- YES YES,
I USE CONCEALMENT MAGIC

208
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,333
THAT HIDES ANYONE AND ANYTHING
FOR AS LONG AS I WANT.

209
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,750
AND THIS QUAINT LITTLE BUILDING
WAS CREATED

210
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,625
USING MY HIDDEN CAGE SPELL.

211
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,666
IT MAY NOT LOOK LIKE MUCH,
BUT IT FOOLED YOU, RIGHT?

212
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,208
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

213
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,583
YOU WON'T HAVE TO CALL
FOR REINFORCEMENTS.

214
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,041
- THEY CAME LOOKING FOR US.
HEY, WE'RE UP HERE!

215
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,750
- HURRY,
NATSU NEEDS YOUR HELP!

216
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,625
- THAT INN SHOULD BE
RIGHT AROUND HERE.

217
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,583
DO YOU THINK WE MISHEARD
THE DIRECTIONS?

218
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,750
- SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.
STAY SHARP.

219
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:20,208
IT'S THE SAME SMELL
AS BEFORE.

220
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:31,458
- ERZA, WHAT IS THAT THING?
 - THAT'S WHAT ATTACKED ME.

221
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,833
I HAD A FEELING
IT'D SHOW UP AGAIN.

222
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,291
- LUCY, I WANT YOU
TO STAY BEHIND ME.

223
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,875
- YOU GOT IT.

224
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,500
- TELL ME WHAT
YOU'RE PLANNING HERE!

225
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,416
ARE YOU THE REASON NATSU AND
THE OTHERS HAVEN'T COME HOME?

226
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,750
ANSWER ME!

227
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,291
- ERZA!
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

228
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,166
OPEN!

229
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,083
GATE OF THE MAIDEN!  VIRGO!
- ( bell dings )

230
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,916
- IS THERE SOMEONE YOU'D LIKE ME
TO SPANK FOR YOU, PRINCESS?

231
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,958
- WE GOTTA WORK
ON YOUR TURN OF PHRASE.

232
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,750
- I LOOK FORWARD
TO BEING DISCIPLINED.

233
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,083
- WHATEVER.
ERZA NEEDS OUR HELP, PRONTO.

234
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:28,125
- IT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE.

235
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,625
PRINCESS,
WE DON'T APPEAR TO BE ALONE.

236
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,708
- I DIDN'T THINK
THERE'D BE MORE THAN ONE.

237
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:42,208
- HAVE NO FEAR, PRINCESS.
I WILL TAKE CARE OF THIS ONE.

238
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,458
- SHE'S GONNA TRY TO CATCH IT
OFF GUARD.

239
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:47,250
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA, VIRGO.

240
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,625
IS THAT THING USING
THE SAME ABILITY?

241
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,583
- DID HE FLEE?

242
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
THE WAY YOU DIG
LACKS ANY DISCIPLINE

243
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,000
OR REFINED FORM OF GRACE.

244
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,000
REVEAL YOURSELF NOW.

245
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,583
I WILL HAPPILY INSTRUCT YOU
IN THE PROPER FORM.

246
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,666
IT APPEARS AS THOUGH HE CAN
INCREASE HIS STRENGTH OVER TIME.

247
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,833
SPICA LOCK!

248
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,291
SORRY, PRINCESS.
I FAILED.

249
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:30,000
- YOU DID GREAT, VIRGO.
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A BREATHER?

250
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:33,416
- I'LL SERVE YOU
BETTER NEXT TIME.

251
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
- NOW YOU ASKED FOR IT.

252
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,083
- ( bell dings )

253
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,166
- IT'S BEEN AWHILE.
'SUP, GORGEOUS?

254
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,666
- I'M KIND OF
IN A BIND RIGHT NOW,

255
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,166
BUT I KNOW
YOU CAN HELP ME OUT.

256
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,666
- I NEVER TURN MY BACK
ON A BEAUTIFUL FACE.

257
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,958
THAT'S NOT HOW THE LEADER OF
THE ZODIAC SPIRITS DOES THINGS.

258
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,791
I STILL OWE YOU ONE FOR TAKING
IN ARIES AND THE OTHERS.

259
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,666
ALWAYS HOPED
THEY'D WIND UP WITH YOU.

260
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,375
- NO, IT CHANGED AGAIN.

261
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,916
- ALL RIGHT, SO HE'LL BE
A TOUGH NUT TO CRACK.

262
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,875
IT'S NICE TO HAVE CHALLENGES.

263
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,333
CUTE TRICK!

264
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,291
IF YOU WANNA CHALLENGE
A CELESTIAL SPIRIT

265
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,166
TO A BARE-KNUCKLED BRAWL,
FINE BY ME.

266
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,166
WHAT THE--
HE GOT WAY STRONGER.

267
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,500
- I JUST FIGURED OUT
WHAT IT'S DOING.

268
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,333
- IMITATION MAY BE FLATTERY,

269
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,083
BUT WHAT YOU'RE
DOING HAS NO STYLE.

270
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,833
- ERZA!  LUCY!

271
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,500
- SAVE YOUR BREATH, CHILD,

272
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,916
I DOUBT THEY CAN HEAR US
WHILE WE'RE INSIDE.

273
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,833
- LET ME GUESS.

274
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,708
THOSE LIZARD HEADS
ARE WORKING FOR YOU?

275
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,416
- WHAT A SMART KITTY CAT.

276
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,416
AND THEY'RE
NOT THE ONLY ONES EITHER.

277
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
I'VE GOT A MENAGERIE OF
ARTIFICIAL PLAYTHINGS

278
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:46,583
IN MY ARSENAL.

279
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,541
- YOU MEAN
THEY'RE NOT REALLY ALIVE?

280
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,375
- THEY MUST BE GOLEMS THEN.
- BINGO.

281
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,958
AND THOSE BAD BOYS
WILL TAG TEAM WITH A GOLEM

282
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,833
THAT MATCHES THE ABILITIES OF
THE OPPONENT THEY'RE FIGHTING.

283
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,041
MAGNOLIA HAS THE BEST WIZARDS
AROUND,

284
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,291
SO I'M TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY
TO GATHER DATA ON THEM

285
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,166
WHILE GRAY DEALS
WITH THE SALAMANDER.

286
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,208
- WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING TO DO
WITH THAT DATA?

287
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:08,125
- NOW THAT, KITTY CAT,
IS THE BIG QUESTION.

288
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,583
BE PATIENT, THE REAL SHOW
WILL START SOON.

289
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,916
WHY SPOIL THE SURPRISE WHEN I
CAN UNVEIL IT IN GRAND FASHION?

290
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,791
- ( crashing )
 - MY MY.

291
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,791
THOSE BOYS LIKE TO PLAY ROUGH,
DON'T THEY?

292
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,875
- GOTTA SAY, OF ALL THE TIMES
WE'VE FOUGHT,

293
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,750
THIS ONE'S THE BEST BY FAR.

294
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,500
- YEAH, SOMEHOW YOU'VE ALWAYS
FOUND A WAY TO KEEP UP WITH ME.

295
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,625
- COME ON NATSU, GIVE HIM
ONE RIGHT IN THE FACE!

296
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,083
- YES YES, SPLENDID.

297
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,000
EVERYTHING'S GONE
ACCORDING TO PLAN.

298
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,666
ALL RIGHT, GRAY FULLBUSTER.

299
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,458
TIME TO FINISH
THIS LITTLE GAME!

300
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,208
- IT'LL BE MY PLEASURE.

301
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,250
NATSU!

302
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,166
- YOU LOSE!

303
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,041
- YES, NATSU WON!

304
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,875
- HE CERTAINLY LIVES UP TO
HIS REPUTATION. - WHOA.

305
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,291
- HA HA.
IMPRESSIVE, DRAGON BOY.

306
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,708
- HA HA!
ALL RIGHT.

307
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,166
I'M GLAD WE GOT THAT SETTLED.

308
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,208
HUH?  GRAY?

309
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,916
WHAT?
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.

310
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,083
I DIDN'T THINK
I'D KNOCKED YOU OUT COLD.

311
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,041
NO PUN INTENDED.

312
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:26,125
HOLD ON A SEC. I DIDN'T
DO MORE THAN THAT, DID I?

313
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,125
AH!
MY TOES ARE GOING NUMB.

314
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,541
- IDIOT.

315
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,166
YOU'LL NEVER LEARN,
WILL YOU?

316
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:36,000
- YES YES YES!
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

317
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,166
HIDDEN DARKNESS!

318
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,541
- AHHH!

319
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,791
- YES YES,
YOU'VE PERFORMED BRILLIANTLY.

320
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:52,041
SEEMS YOU'RE WORTHY OF BEING
MY PARTNER. - 'PRECIATE IT.

321
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:55,958
TOOK A BIT MORE WORK
THAN I EXPECTED.

322
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,500
- Happy: NO!
- Wendy: WHAT DO WE DO?

323
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,000
- YOU TRICKED US.

324
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,666
IT WAS NEVER YOUR INTENTION
TO HARM HIM.

325
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,000
YOU WERE LURING HIM
INTO THIS SETUP. - YEP.

326
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,166
HE'S STRONG,
BUT I ALSO USE MY BRAINS.

327
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,541
- YOU ARE SUCH A LIAR.

328
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,666
YOU JUST WON
BECAUSE YOU CHEATED.

329
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,166
- YOU CAN JOIN HIM
IF YOU WANT, FUR BALL.

330
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,833
- STOP!

331
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,000
LET GO!
- YES YES.

332
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,875
QUIT FOOLING AROUND,
YOU IMBECILE.

333
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,666
IT TOOK THIS MUCH EFFORT

334
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,083
JUST TO GET THE IMPORTANT PART
OF MY EXPERIMENT IN PLACE.

335
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,208
- I GUESS
I'M NOT THE IMPORTANT PART?

336
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,916
- SO TRAPPING NATSU
WAS YOUR GOAL FROM THE START?

337
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,625
- YES.  MY RESEARCH
IS FINALLY COMPLETE.

338
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,041
NOW THE FUN BEGINS.

339
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,916
- HAPPY!
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

340
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,958
WENDY, YOU THERE?
TESTING, ONE, TWO, THREE!

341
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,291
- Young Natsu:
WHOA, A DRAGON EGG!

342
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,458
 - ( squawking )

343
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,291
- I BET IGNEEL'S OVER THERE.

344
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,916
IGNEEL!

345
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,916
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
DON'T LEAVE.

346
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,500
I WANNA COME WITH YOU!

347
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:08,250
IGNEEL, PLEASE WAIT.
DON'T GO!

348
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,875
IGNEEL.

349
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,458
Natsu: IGNEEL.

350
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:22,041
I REMEMBER THAT EGG.

351
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,500
AND THE CITY WAS DEAD QUIET.

352
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:27,083
WAIT A MINUTE.
A CITY WITHOUT SOUND.

353
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,708
AHHH!

354
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,875
- NATSU?

355
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,750
- All: AHH!
- WHAT'S THAT?

356
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,541
- THE SOUND
OF MY LITTLE SURPRISE.

357
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,875
- Erza: I UNDERSTAND.

358
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,875
THEY SWITCH OUT
WITH ONE OF THEIR KIND

359
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,000
THAT HAS THE SAME ATTRIBUTES
AS THEIR OPPONENT.

360
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,041
AND THAT'S WHERE
THEIR WEAKNESS LIES.

361
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:56,041
REQUIP!
ADAMANTINE ARMOR!

362
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,708
YOU NEED TO WORK
ON YOUR TIMING.

363
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,916
YOU'VE GOT QUITE A COLLECTION.

364
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,708
BUT THE FACT THAT YOU
CAN MATCH MY ARMOR

365
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,250
DOESN'T HELP YOU AT ALL.

366
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:20,000
THERE'S NO ONE IN THIS WORLD
WHO CAN REQUIP AS FAST AS ME.

367
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:23,500
NEXT TIME USE YOUR OWN STRENGTH
TO FIGHT YOUR BATTLES.

368
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,541
- THIS IMITATION CRAP
IS GETTING ON MY NERVES.

369
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,125
BUT I THINK WE CAN USE IT
TO TAKE THIS GUY DOWN.

370
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,375
- YEAH, AND I KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT TO DO.

371
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,250
- WELL,
IT'S BEEN FUN REGARDLESS.

372
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,333
TAKE CARE, BEAUTIFUL.

373
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,083
- OPEN!

374
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,541
GATE OF THE LITTLE DOG--
NICOLA!

375
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:48,708
- ( carnival music playing )

376
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,208
- ( squeals )

377
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,208
- YES!
JUST AS I PLANNED.

378
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,791
YOU CAN DO IT.
- ( both panting )

379
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,583
- ( weakly ) HOORAY!

380
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,041
- YOU'VE GOTTEN STRONGER.

381
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,833
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, PLUE.

382
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,708
- AHH.

383
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:42,041
- HA HA HA.

384
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:52,083
- YES YES, IT'S ALIVE!
CONCEALMENT MAGIC, DISPERSED.

385
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,416
PREPARE TO ACTIVATE
LACRIMA CORE!

386
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,916
UNLOCKING
ALL JOINT RESTRICTORS.

387
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,916
NEUROTRANSMITTER LACRIMA
CONNECTION IS GOOD TO GO.

388
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,166
ANYTHING LIVING
THAT'S NOT SALAMANDER,

389
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,833
GET AWAY
FROM MY PRECIOUS BABY!

390
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,375
YES YES YES.

391
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:11,041
FIRING UP THIS BAD BOY
WITH A SALAMANDER HEART.

392
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,875
LET'S GET THIS PARTY STARTED!

393
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,333
- AHHH!

394
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,541
- NOW MY DRAGONOID, ACTIVATE!

395
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,291
- INTERESTING NAME CHOICE.

396
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,916
- I DON'T THINK
WE WANNA KNOW

397
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,625
WHAT SALAMANDER HEART
REALLY MEANS.

398
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,208
- AHHH!

399
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,291
- Lucy: NATSU!

400
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,000
SO LOUD!

401
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:45,375
- YES YES YES.
LIKE A NEWBORN, IT CRIES!

402
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,541
SUCH MAJESTY!

403
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,416
THE WORLD'S FIRST ARTIFICIALLY
CONSTRUCTED DRAGON!

404
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,791
THE UNSTOPPABLE DRAGONOID.

405
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,958
AND NOW SALAMANDER'S MAGIC
POWER IS ITS LIFE BLOOD.

406
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,500
- IT'S USING HIS MAGIC POWER?

407
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,791
- LUCY AND ERZA!
YOU'RE OKAY!

408
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,375
- I'M GLAD YOU'RE SAFE.
- WE WERE SO WORRIED.

409
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,291
- WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING
FAST.

410
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,250
- FIRST YOU NEED
TO TELL US WHAT'S GOING ON.

411
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:11,291
- WHERE'S NATSU?
- HE'S INSIDE THAT BIG DRAGON.

412
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,500
THIS CRAZY LADY NAMED DAPHNE
SET A TRAP FOR HIM,

413
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,666
AND GRAY LURED HIM INTO IT. 
 - Both: WHAT DID YOU SAY?

414
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,166
- WHAT'S WORSE
IS HE'S NOT BEING MANIPULATED.

415
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,833
IT'S ALL ON PURPOSE.

416
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:23,583
GRAY'S DOING ALL OF THIS
OF HIS OWN FREE WILL.

417
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,666
- UP THERE.

418
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,250
- ( end theme playing )

419
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:52,541
- ( singing in Japanese )

420
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,291
- Natsu: HAPPY, DID I JUST
GET EATEN BY A DRAGON?

421
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:17,416
- NO, GOOFBALL,
IT'S A DRAGONOID.

422
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,541
DAPHNE BUILT IT,
LIKE A GIANT TOY.

423
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,625
- WHAT?
SO IT'S A FAKE?

424
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:24,166
AWWW, AND HERE I WAS ALL
PUMPED UP FOR A MANO-A-MANO,

425
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,083
BALLS-TO-THE-WALL,
DRAGON-SLAYER FIGHT!

426
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:27,916
TALK ABOUT A BUZZ KILL.

427
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,416
- MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T
GET YOURSELF CAPTURED, GENIUS.

428
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,375
- ( Happy and Natsu speaking )

429
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:34,958
- Natsu: WHAT?
I DIDN'T GET CAUGHT.

430
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:37,291
I, UH,
I'M RIDING THIS THING.

431
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,375
- Happy: WAIT, IF THAT'S THE
CASE, SHOULDN'T YOU BE VOMITING?

432
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:40,666
- ( Natsu grumbling )
