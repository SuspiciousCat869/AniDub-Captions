1
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:23,250
[LUCY]
Open! Gate of the King!

2
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,541
[KING growls]

3
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:22,625
[CROWD murmurs]

4
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:49,458
A fallen star or king?

5
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:53,000
[KING]
You know who I am.

6
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,875
[JACKAL]
What the hell is goin' on here?

7
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,875
Hey, stop yer cryin'
and start talkin'!

8
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:14,791
No! No! No!

9
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,958
What could've taken
down Plutogrim?

10
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:26,125
Seems like the old flying beast
has finally been put to sleep.

11
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:29,583
Those vile fairies. What now?

12
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:36,208
It has been quite a while,
King of the Stars.

13
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:40,250
[KING]
Not long enough, Mard Geer.

14
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,125
[MARD GEER] I must say, I'm
very surprised to see you again.

15
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,666
Perhaps most surprised
at my miscalculation.

16
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,291
I didn't think anyone
here could summon you.

17
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,541
[KING]
I see you're still

18
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,458
lugging that battered
tome around with you.

19
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:56,416
Have you not yet fulfilled
your ambition?

20
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,291
[MARD GEER]
This holds the spirit of E.N.D.

21
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,583
The embodiment of Tartaros.

22
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,083
[KING]
Ah.

23
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:08,125
And you still seek to bring
life from those dead pages?

24
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,416
[MARD GEER] You know very
well what my goal is.

25
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,333
To revive E.N.D.
and return to Zeref.

26
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:16,500
Until it has been achieved,
I will not waver.

27
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:21,500
[KING] Mard Geer. You've always
been such a twisted fool.

28
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:24,500
Feet firmly planted in
the mire of avarice.

29
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,750
So blinded by your ambition

30
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:31,083
that you would plunge the
entire world into chaos.

31
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,625
Yes, I would. But I'm not blind.

32
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,333
I clearly see our journey's end.

33
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:39,125
We have come far in
our return to Zeref.

34
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:42,291
In fact, it's looming
on the horizon.

35
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,666
[LUCY cries]

36
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,875
[KING]
My old friend is on the ground.

37
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,000
Sobbing and twisted in pain.

38
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:00,250
Did she try to impede
your journey?

39
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,833
Yes, she did.

40
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:05,000
[LUCY cries]

41
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:09,416
[KING] The tears she sheds.
They anger me.

42
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,833
Are you the one who
caused them to flow?

43
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,125
[MARD GEER] I think the time
for discussion has long passed,

44
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,416
wouldn't you agree?

45
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,875
[KING]
Yes. Wholeheartedly.

46
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:34,250
In order to fulfill my
obligation to my old friend,

47
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:38,166
I will eliminate all
who would do her harm.

48
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,041
Will you?

49
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:48,708
[KING] You will pay dearly
for your transgressions!

50
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,708
[KING roars]

51
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,125
[KING] Is your only strategy
to flee, Underworld King?

52
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,125
[MARD GEER] You're exactly
the same as you've always been.

53
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,875
With the same glaring weakness.

54
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,208
It's quite a relief.

55
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:31,375
It means that I can remain
assured in my victory.

56
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,166
[KING] And you still
are nothing but talk.

57
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,000
Lulled into complacency and
false pride by your own words.

58
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,333
Curse of Thorns.

59
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,708
[KING grunting]

60
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:06,458
May these never ending briars
ensnare your ponderous bulk.

61
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:09,250
And bring about your ruin!

62
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,916
[MARD GEER]
Earlier, you chided me.

63
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,750
Indicted me for
my willingness

64
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,958
to throw the world into
chaos to achieve my goals.

65
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,791
Did you not?

66
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,791
It seems to me that your
memory is growing feeble.

67
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,000
Let me remind you
of recent events.

68
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,833
Not long ago you and your
"eclipse" spirits threatened

69
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:32,791
not only your own world,
but this one as well.

70
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,375
And now you barge
in here threatening

71
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,625
to harm me and my
demonic brethren.

72
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:44,833
How you reek of the putrid
stench of hypocrisy.

73
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,666
[KING]
You are mistaken.

74
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,333
I admit, we did
stray from our path.

75
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:53,208
We let misguided ambition
rule and paid dearly for it.

76
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,541
But our friends risked
everything they had

77
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,458
and set us back on course.

78
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:00,166
It is for that reason
I'm here today.

79
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,541
I owe it to them to render aid
when they need it most.

80
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,083
That is the true meaning
of friendship.

81
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:09,291
These brambles may set
me back momentarily,

82
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,208
but the pain they
inflict is nothing

83
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,333
compared to the suffering my
friends endured to help me.

84
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:17,125
You will not hold me back!

85
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,958
Is that so?

86
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,833
[KING]
I shall vow again and again!

87
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:25,125
To pay tribute to
the life of my friend,

88
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,791
and the sacred bond we share.

89
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:31,041
I will eliminate you!

90
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,333
You missed.

91
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:47,958
[KING]
Meteor Blade!

92
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:09,875
I'm impressed. However,
"Celestial Spirit King,"

93
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,541
as I said before, you
have a glaring weakness.

94
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,708
Even your title betrays it.

95
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:17,458
[KING]
What do you mean?

96
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,708
You're bound by
celestial law.

97
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:23,750
The rules that govern your
interaction in this world.

98
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,583
So although you may
tower over me now,

99
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,833
my ultimate victory
is set in stone.

100
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:35,833
Aw, damnit!

101
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,958
My tail's caught under
this friggin' boulder!

102
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,916
[JACKAL grunting]

103
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:46,875
So what happened? Why did
our fortress crash and burn?

104
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,291
Uh?!

105
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,791
[LUCY cries]

106
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,291
[JACKAL]
You did this? Didn't you?

107
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,666
[JACKAL] Stop with all
the pitiful blubbering

108
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,041
and answer me! Whenever
I see someone crying

109
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,666
like that, it makes me
wanna gouge out their eyes!

110
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,375
[LUCY cries]

111
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,833
I said enough!

112
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:17,875
[JACKAL]
What?!

113
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,083
[LUCY]
A force-field of water?

114
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:36,541
Aquarius?! Are you here?!
Please, talk to me!

115
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,041
[gasps]

116
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,541
The hell?

117
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,000
Hey, why are you glowing
like some kinda star?!

118
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:46,333
You tryin' to pull another
one of your freaky stunts?

119
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:50,000
I can feel it. Magic power.

120
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,916
[KING] Aquarius holds a
great deal of magic power

121
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,375
in her hands. And that is
now shared with you.

122
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,875
[LUCY]
Celestial Spirit King?

123
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,875
[KING]
Use it. Stand up!

124
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:10,375
[LUCY] This was her last
gift to me. Her power.

125
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:15,500
[KING] Rise and make use
of what you've been given!

126
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,458
[LUCY]
I will!

127
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,250
[KING]
My old friend.

128
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:23,916
May the radiance of
the stars be your guide.

129
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,875
[LUCY]
Thank you, your majesty!

130
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:30,750
[JACKAL growls]
You stupid girl!

131
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:37,708
[LUCY] You too, Aquarius.
For everything you've done.

132
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:42,750
You forget my curse?
Lemme remind you!

133
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:49,166
[JACKAL] Burn baby burn!
Explode into a million pieces!

134
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,958
[panting] That did it!

135
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:56,375
There won't even be
a body left to bury!

136
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:59,166
No way! That's impossible!

137
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,541
[LUCY]
You're right, Aquarius.

138
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,958
[JACKAL] Hey you!
How dare you ignore me!

139
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:08,125
You'll be sorry! I'll
make you burn for real!

140
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:11,041
[LUCY]
I can't keep on crying forever.

141
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:16,083
This'll get your attention!
Explosion Spiral!

142
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:20,208
[LUCY]
I have to save my tears.

143
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,708
[JACKAL grunts]
What the...? I don't get it!

144
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:30,375
[LUCY] Because right now,
I need to help my friends.

145
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,291
[LUCY]
I need to fight!

146
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,458
[JACKAL]
Huh?

147
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:41,208
[LUCY] Oh stars far and wide
that embody the heavens.

148
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,166
I implore you, Tetrabiblos.
By thy radiance,

149
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,541
reveal thy form to me.
Eternal ruler of the stars...

150
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,625
What is she babbling about?

151
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,375
[LUCY] Now that the
aspect is complete,

152
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,916
I ask that you to lend
your power to me.

153
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,458
Let your unrestrained rage flow.

154
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,833
Open the raging,
tumultuous gate!

155
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,375
[JACKAL]
I dunno what she's saying,

156
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,958
but I know that it's not
gonna be good!

157
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:07,416
With all 88 heavenly bodies.

158
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,708
Shining Uranometria!

159
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,583
[JACKAL]
No! Don't do it!

160
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:17,500
--[JACKAL screams]
--[LUCY yells]

161
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:56,000
Jackal's curse power is no more.

162
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,916
[SILVER]
That little cockroach.

163
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,083
What is this magic?

164
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:06,166
[KEYES] Conjury of the celestial
world. The maiden survived.

165
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,166
[KING yells]

166
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,125
You're not as spry as before.

167
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:19,416
Could it be that
something is ailing you?

168
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,916
[KING] It seems my old friend
has exhausted her strength.

169
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,708
[MARD GEER] A spirit,
however large and imposing

170
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:32,083
they may appear is inexorably
bound to its summoner.

171
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:36,083
So if that wizard's magic
power is depleted, well,

172
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:41,041
the spirit also loses its
potency. It really is a shame.

173
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:44,125
But regardless.
This is where you end.

174
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:52,000
[KING] I swore an oath
to eliminate you.

175
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,750
[KING]
Come to me.

176
00:14:55,833 --> 00:15:00,208
May the starlight fantasy of
the 88 illuminated bodies

177
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:04,791
imbue this spirit with
celestial might.

178
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:12,583
[KING]
Galaxia Blade!

179
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,416
It's an omni-directional attack?

180
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:40,666
Your summoner is nearby, will
you "eliminate" her, as well?

181
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,291
[KING]
Smile!

182
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,958
[MARD GEER]
You wouldn't dare!

183
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,791
What could this
strange light be?

184
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,166
[laughs]

185
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,541
Erza!

186
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,208
[ERZA]
I will strike you down!

187
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,416
Yes! The fight I hunger
for! What I need!

188
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,666
[ERZA grunts]

189
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:26,541
The passion is electric!
It makes me feel alive!

190
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,333
[GRAY grunting]

191
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,458
What the hell just happened?

192
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,166
Hey, Pantherlily!
Where'd you go?

193
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,708
[JUVIA] Gray, my love!
Where are you?

194
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:43,625
Call my name and
I'll come running!

195
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:44,875
Well that sucked.

196
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,875
Is it over now?

197
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,041
Shadow Gear! Levy?
Are ya here?

198
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:54,166
[DROY] We're here. It's a
miracle that we're not dead.

199
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,166
Yeah, right. But I'm
getting crushed over here.

200
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,750
[JET, DROY]
Hang on! I'm comin'!

201
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,875
You're not playin hero, tubby.

202
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,750
That's cuz' I obviously am one.

203
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,250
Clean out your ears.
She clearly called for me!

204
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,250
Bullcrap, we both heard her
say "please save me, Droy!"

205
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,625
Manly!

206
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:11,666
Are you okay?

207
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,666
Yeah, thanks!

208
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,708
[JET, DROY]
They beat us to it!

209
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:19,416
[ELFMAN] So, uh? Can anybody
tell me what all that was?

210
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,000
[LEVY]
I'm not really sure,

211
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,875
but I think we're back
on the ground now.

212
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,125
[LISANNA] Yeah, you're
right. So did we fall?

213
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:32,541
[HAPPY]
Natsu! Where are you?

214
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,541
[HAPPY]
My head feels kinda weird.

215
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,916
Like it's heavier or something.

216
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,708
[MACAO]
Hey!

217
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,083
[ELFMAN, LISANNA]
Huh?

218
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,916
Are you okay?

219
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,541
Man, am I glad to see you!

220
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,791
I smoke too much to be running.

221
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,500
Does this mean we're all
up and moving around again?

222
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,791
[ELFMAN] I just know, that I
think we're alive.

223
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,541
[ROMEO]
What's the matter with Mirajane?

224
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:54,958
[LISANNA]
She's just exhausted.

225
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,250
She needs a little
time to recover.

226
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,666
All right! We gotta go
check on everybody else.

227
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,041
Now we're gonna find some
injured. They'll need our help.

228
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:04,916
Yeah!

229
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,750
Let's go get our guild mates!

230
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,625
It's crazy out here.
But we'll find them.

231
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:13,041
I wonder about
Natsu and Lucy.

232
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,458
[MACAO]
I'm sure they're fine, but...

233
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,500
[MARD GEER whimpering]

234
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:23,083
You've broken the Alegria curse.

235
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,125
[KING]
The cleansing light of the stars

236
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:30,333
has chased away the sinister
shadow you've cast.

237
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:34,250
My old friend and her comrades
will finish the job here.

238
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:37,250
They will send you back
where you belong.

239
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,833
[MARD GEER]
Curse you.

240
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:43,666
[KING] Once again, your lack
of understanding is glaring.

241
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,208
You saw my bond as a chain
tying me to a weight.

242
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:51,833
But this is not so. This bond
connects our hearts and minds.

243
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,375
It means we share in our goals.

244
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,875
It means we will finish what
the other has begun,

245
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,750
without question.

246
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,708
[KING]
It is far from a "weakness".

247
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:08,875
In fact, this bond is our
greatest strength.

248
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,416
Now your weakness is exposed.

249
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Your ignorance of love,
trust, and friendship.

250
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,208
The concepts would
never enter your mind.

251
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:21,041
So you neglect them,
at your own peril.

252
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,833
But before I leave this place
for the celestial world.

253
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:28,250
And my old friend continues
the task we share.

254
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:32,833
There is one more thing I must
do to help my comrades.

255
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:36,958
My dear friend. I look forward
to our next meeting.

256
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:41,500
I know it will be under more
joyful circumstances.

257
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,833
[MARD GEER]
You're running away?!

258
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,291
No. What is this?

259
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:58,875
Does that starry-eyed old
fool think he can stop me?

260
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:02,291
I know that victory shall
be mine in the end.

261
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:05,166
If the humans and the
king truly share hearts.

262
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,500
I'll just have to make
them cease their beating.

263
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,875
They will share death.

264
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,875
[TORAFUZAR]
How is this possible?

265
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:27,625
That pitiful little girl took
out both Lummy and Jackal?

266
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,666
[TORAFUZAR] Her magic must be
more powerful than we thought.

267
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:39,375
I can't stop. They need
me. I gotta help them.

268
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,708
[TORAFUZAR]
He should've just killed her

269
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,541
when he had the chance!

270
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,875
But I'll do it now.

271
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,416
Gajeel.

272
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,250
This can't be.

273
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,166
I thought that the girl was
the only remaining survivor!

274
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,500
[GAJEEL]
Huh?

275
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:05,833
[KEYES]
It would appear

276
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:09,333
Mard Geer's Alegria curse
has been lifted.

277
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:15,541
But still. The fairies will
fall! It is their fate!

278
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,791
Water Nebula!

279
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,875
Juvia.

280
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,583
[JUVIA] I won't let
you harm my friends!

281
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,083
You should cool down.

282
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,125
[JUVIA gasps]

283
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,041
Not happenin'!

284
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,416
[LUCY]
Gray.

285
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,000
[KEYES] Mm. The boy
cancelled out Silver's ice.

286
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,750
Nice one.

287
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,333
Uh!

288
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,875
Fwoosh.

289
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,541
Fire?

290
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,250
[TEMPESTER] What is this?
He's eating my fire attack?

291
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:10,458
[NATSU] Wow, Lucy, I don't
know how you did it.

292
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:13,125
But you saved the day.

293
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,708
You are one tough little lady.

294
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:19,708
We'll work together and
finish what you started.

295
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:23,000
You deserve to take a break.

296
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,625
[LUCY]
Thank you.

297
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:26,166
[NATSU]
All right!

298
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,541
Looks like we've got
our work cut out for us.

299
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:31,750
These guys are serious!

300
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:42,166
I'm fired up now!

301
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:15,041
[LUCY] Fairy Tail is
finally back in action

302
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:16,666
and ready to spring
into battle against

303
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,166
the demon gates of Tartaros!

304
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,625
Meanwhile, Wendy and Carla
learn the disturbing truth

305
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:24,708
about the plan to use Face,
and it's not over yet.

306
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:26,416
Tension is building everywhere.

307
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,375
And as our members
pick up the pieces,

308
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:29,958
Erza and Minerva's rivalry

309
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:32,791
has exploded into a
life or death face off!

310
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:37,666
Next Time: "Tartaros Chapter
- Erza vs.Minerva"

311
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:40,875
[LUCY] Where does true
strength come from?
