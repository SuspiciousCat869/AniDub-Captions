1
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:20,041
- HEY GUYS! READY FOR
SOME MORE FAIRY TAIL?

2
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:21,750
JUST MAKE SURE THAT WHEN
YOU'RE WATCHING,

3
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,500
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS
ON IN THE ROOM,

4
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,875
AND DON'T SIT TOO
CLOSE TO THE TV!

5
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,083
- Gray: PREVIOUSLY
ON FAIRY TAIL!

6
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,750
- Happy: WE'RE IN BIG TROUBLE
WITH THE MAGIC COUNCIL!

7
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,083
- YEAH, IT'S NOT SURPRISING

8
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,541
AFTER ALL THAT CRAZY DAMAGE
WE'VE CAUSED.

9
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,916
- Lavian: THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,666
- Happy: THE WORST PART
IS MASTER MAKAROV

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,250
IS GONNA BE PUT ON TRIAL!

12
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,250
- Lavian: THANK YOU
SO VERY MUCH!

13
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,416
- Gray: HOLD ON.
WHO THE HECK ARE YOU?

14
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:57,833
- ( theme song playing )

15
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:27,166
- ( snoring )

16
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,625
- UH, MISTER MAKAROV, HELLO?

17
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:30,791
- HERE!

18
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,291
- COURT IS IN SESSION, SIR!

19
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,083
AND WE HAVE A VERY STRICT POLICY

20
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,250
OF "NO SLEEPING"
WHILE ON THE STAND!

21
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,041
- SORRY ABOUT THAT!

22
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,416
- Makarov: PHANTOM LORD'S
TO BE DISBANDED,

23
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,208
AND JOSE STRIPPED OF HIS TITLE
AS ONE OF THE WIZARD SAINTS.

24
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,166
PRETTY MUCH WHAT I EXPECTED.

25
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,208
BUT THEN, FAIRY TAIL
WAS FOUND INNOCENT,

26
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,583
WHICH CAME AS A BIT OF
A SURPRISE TO ME.

27
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,958
- I SPOKE IN DEFENSE OF
YOUR CHARACTER, MOCKY.

28
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,083
I HOPE YA APPRECIATE THAT.

29
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,375
- YA KNOW I'M GLAD
FOR THE SUPPORT, YAJ.

30
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,083
I'D LIKE IT IF YA COULD
DROP BY THE GUILD

31
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,916
ONCE IT'S BEEN REPAIRED,

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
AND I'LL TREAT YA TO SOME RAMEN.

33
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,708
I COULD GO FOR A FAIRY RAMEN

34
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,166
WITH TWELVE SLICES
OF ROASTED PORK.

35
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,791
THAT'S KINDA PUSHING IT,
DON'T YA THINK?

36
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,625
- DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THE PENALTY IS

37
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,250
FOR VIOLATING THE FOURTH CLAUSE
OF YOUR GUILD CHARTER?

38
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,958
- ALL RIGHT, I GET THE POINT!
YOU CAN HAVE TWENTY SLICES!

39
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,000
BETTER YET, MAKE IT THIRTY!

40
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,416
TWELVE PORK SLICES WILL BE FINE.

41
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:36,458
- Shitou: LISTEN, I THINK
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO REIN IT IN.

42
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:39,750
WE'RE JUST NOT AS YOUNG AS
WE USED TO BE, YOU KNOW.

43
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,083
DON'T TELL ME THAT
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN?

44
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,125
- ABOUT WHAT?

45
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,291
- WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR OLD PAL.

46
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:50,291
- WHO? ROB? 'COURSE NOT.

47
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,333
- THOSE WERE THE GOOD OLD DAYS.

48
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:56,041
THE TEAM OF YOU, ME, ROB,
AND PORLYUSICA.

49
00:03:56,125 --> 00:04:00,541
WE WERE ALL SO YOUNG BACK THEN.
JUST A BUNCH OF RECKLESS FOOLS.

50
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:03,125
BUT WE LIVED EVERY DAY
TO THE FULLEST.

51
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,750
- WE SURE DID.

52
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:09,000
FAIRY TAIL WAS A GREAT PLACE
TO BE UNTIL ROB LEFT US.

53
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,916
ERZA SOMETIMES
SHARES HER STORIES

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,791
OF WHAT HE WAS LIKE IN
HIS LATER YEARS.

55
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,541
- I BROUGHT THIS UP 'CAUSE
THERE'S BEEN INCREASING TALK

56
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:20,791
THAT FAIRY TAIL'S ANTICS HAVE
BEEN GETTING OUT OF HAND LATELY.

57
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,708
MICHELLO AND ORG HAVE BEEN
MAKING NOISE IN THE COUNCIL,

58
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:26,416
ABOUT WANTING TO
DISBAND THE GUILD.

59
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,666
A MAN YOUR AGE SHOULDN'T BE
DEALING WITH ALL THESE PROBLEMS.

60
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,958
IT'S TOO MUCH STRESS.

61
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:35,041
YOU WON'T DO ANYONE ANY
GOOD IF YOU'RE DEAD.

62
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,166
DON'T GO LIKE ROB.

63
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,083
SERIOUSLY, YOU'VE GOTTA
STEP DOWN SOON.

64
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,041
YOU'RE NOT A KID ANYMORE.

65
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,875
- Happy: NEXT GENERATION!

66
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,250
- LISTEN UP, EVERYONE!

67
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,291
WE'RE TAKING ON JOB REQUESTS
AGAIN, STARTING TODAY!

68
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,541
YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE THE MESS
WHILE WE'RE UNDER CONSTRUCTION,

69
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,458
BUT AT LEAST YOU CAN
GET BACK TO WORK!

70
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,875
- ( everybody cheering )

71
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,875
- Lucy: WHAT'S UP WITH THEM?

72
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,125
MOST OF THE TIME THESE GUYS
WOULD JUST BE LOAFING AROUND

73
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,375
THE GUILD HALL ALL DAY.

74
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:09,833
- ( laughs )

75
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,000
- I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'VE
SEEN LOKE, HAVE YOU?

76
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,291
- OH, DON'T TELL ME
YOU'VE FALLEN HEAD OVER HEELS

77
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,458
FOR FAIRY TAIL'S
RESIDENT PLAYBOY!

78
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,000
- IT'S NOT LIKE THAT!

79
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,166
IT'S JUST THAT APPARENTLY HE
WAS THE ONE WHO FOUND MY KEYS.

80
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,500
I JUST WANTED TO TELL HIM THANKS
FOR HIS HELP.

81
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,125
- SURE, I'LL LET HIM KNOW
IF I SEE HIM.

82
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,625
SO WERE YOUR CELESTIAL SPIRITS
MAD AT YOU?

83
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,000
YOU KNOW,
FOR DROPPING YOUR KEYS?

84
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,333
- UH, YEAH. YOU COULD SAY THAT.

85
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,083
AND THERE'S ONE
SPIRIT IN PARTICULAR

86
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,041
WHO WAS REALLY PO'ED WITH ME.

87
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:39,125
- WHAT DID I SAY ABOUT
DROPPING MY KEY, HUH?

88
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:42,125
- ( Lucy screams )

89
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,208
JUST THINKING ABOUT IT
MAKES MY BUTT STING!

90
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,250
- GOODNESS, ME!

91
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,625
- I COULD COOL IT FOR YA.

92
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,791
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE
SEXUAL HARASSMENT TO ME.

93
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,041
- LUCY, CAN YOU SHOW ME
HOW RED YOUR BUTT IS?

94
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:55,083
- AND WITH THAT COMMENT
YOU'VE CROSSED THE LINE!

95
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,208
- HOW DO YA THINK SHE'LL REACT

96
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,000
IF I MAKE HER BUTT
STING EVEN MORE?

97
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,708
- WHO ARE YOU? THE DEVIL?

98
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,750
- Erza: WHY DON'T YOU
TELL THE OTHERS HOW YOU FEEL?

99
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,375
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

100
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:12,375
- I HAVE NO PROBLEM TELLING 'EM
WHAT I THINK OF 'EM.

101
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,958
THIS GUILD'S FULL OF NOTHING
BUT LOSERS AND WEAKLINGS!

102
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,041
ESPECIALLY THE TWO
OF YOU MORONS.

103
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,750
YOU WERE PHANTOM'S
PERSONAL PUNCHING BAGS.

104
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:24,500
YOU KNOW I'M GLAD I NEVER
BOTHERED TO LEARN YOUR NAMES.

105
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,875
WHICH BRINGS ME
TO THE WORST OF THEM ALL,

106
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:30,416
THE RICH LITTLE PRINCESS WANNABE
WIZARD. THIS WAS YOUR FAULT.

107
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,500
- LAXUS! WOULD YOU SHUT UP?

108
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,916
THE MASTER SAID NO ONE IN THE
GUILD WAS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,416
FOR WHAT HAPPENED, NOT EVEN YOU,

110
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,375
DESPITE THE FACT THAT I
BEGGED YOU TO COME HELP

111
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,083
AND YOU TURNED YOUR BACK ON US!

112
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:45,666
- STOP YOUR WHINING! THAT FIGHT
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.

113
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,833
BUT IF I HAD BEEN THERE,

114
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,500
YOU WOULDN'T BE
DROWNING YOUR SORROWS

115
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,583
IN THIS PILE OF
RUBBLE RIGHT NOW.

116
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,458
- WHY, YOU! NATSU!
- I'VE HEARD ENOUGH OUTTA YOU!

117
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:02,541
C'MON LAXUS! FIGHT ME
LIKE A MAN! YA GUTLESS COWARD!

118
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:04,958
- HOW D'YA EXPECT TO FIGHT ME

119
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,958
WHEN YA CAN'T EVEN
TOUCH ME, YA DIMWIT?

120
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,583
I CAN'T WAIT TO INHERIT
THIS PLACE

121
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,541
AND KICK ALL YOU
WEAKLINGS TO THE CURB!

122
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,666
YOUR DAYS IN FAIRY TAIL
ARE NUMBERED, KIDS!

123
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,833
THINGS ARE GONNA BE A WHOLE LOT
DIFFERENT AROUND HERE,

124
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:21,458
SO I GUESS YOU LOSERS WILL HAVE
TO FIND A NEW PLACE TO HANG OUT.

125
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:30,291
- WHAT A JERK! WHY WOULD ANYONE
EVER LET HIM TAKE OVER?

126
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,583
- WE MAY NOT HAVE A CHOICE.

127
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:33,958
LAXUS COULD INHERIT THE GUILD

128
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,625
BECAUSE HE'S THE
MASTER'S GRANDSON.

129
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,541
WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT,
HE'S AT THE TOP OF A SHORT LIST

130
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,125
OF PEOPLE WHO COULD
ASSUME COMMAND,

131
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,916
IF THE MASTER WERE TO RETIRE.

132
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,791
- NO. REALLY?

133
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,500
THAT SUCKS.
IT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT.

134
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,416
SOMEONE WHO TALKS LIKE THAT
ABOUT HIS FELLOW MEMBERS,

135
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,291
ISN'T WORTHY OF BEING
FAIRY TAIL'S LEADER.

136
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:57,208
- IT'S BEEN RUMORED MASTER
MAKAROV REFUSES TO RETIRE

137
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,750
FOR THAT VERY REASON.

138
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,958
- WOW. SERIOUSLY?

139
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,500
- MAN, I HATE HIM!

140
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,750
- CALM DOWN. IT'S JUST
A NEEDLESS WASTE OF ENERGY.

141
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,500
LET'S TRY TO GET
YOUR MIND OFF HIM.

142
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT TAKING A JOB?

143
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,750
AND WE CAN GET GRAY AND LUCY
TO COME ALONG WITH US!

144
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:13,916
- DO WHAT?

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
- HEY, GRAY. YOUR CLOTHES.

146
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,000
- WE'VE ALL BEEN WORKING
TOGETHER

147
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,375
SINCE THE EISENWALD INCIDENT,

148
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,208
SO I GUESS WE'RE A TEAM
OF SORTS NOW.

149
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,625
- IT TOOK HER THIS LONG TO
FIGURE THAT OUT? WE ALL KNEW.

150
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,208
- YEAH, THOSE GUYS HAVE
BEEN JOINED AT THE HIP

151
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,625
FOR A WHILE NOW.

152
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,791
AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
SHE CALLED THEM HER TEAM?

153
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,250
- THAT'S ERZA FOR YA!

154
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,791
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
MAKING IT OFFICIAL?

155
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,791
THE FOUR OF US
WORKING AS A TEAM.

156
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,041
WELL, ACTUALLY FIVE
IF WE INCLUDE HAPPY.

157
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,958
- BUT YOU'RE SURE YOU WANT
SOMEONE LIKE ME ON YOUR TEAM?

158
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:48,416
- NOT SOMEONE LIKE YOU! LUCY,
IT'S GOTTA BE EXACTLY YOU!

159
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,583
- AYE!

160
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:50,916
- IT JUST WOULDN'T FEEL RIGHT

161
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,083
IF WE DIDN'T HAVE YOU OUT
THERE WITH US, YA KNOW?

162
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,458
- NOW THAT THEY
FINALLY REALIZE IT,

163
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,625
I GUESS THEY'RE OFFICIALLY
OUR STRONGEST TEAM.

164
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,750
- YEAH, IT'S ABOUT TIME!

165
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,750
- IS LUCY REALLY ONE OF
OUR STRONGEST?

166
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,000
- I KNOW I'D BE DONE FOR

167
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,166
IF SHE SICCED THAT
PSYCHO AQUARIUS ON ME!

168
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,958
- SHE'S GOT A REAL SHARP
TONGUE, TOO!

169
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,125
- YEAH, SHE'S ONE OF THE BEST
IN THE GUILD.

170
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,583
- I GOTTA TEAM UP WITH HIM?
- PROBLEM, BOYS?

171
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,833
- NO! WE'RE ABSOLUTELY THRILLED!

172
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,708
- I'VE ALREADY GOT A JOB
LINED UP FOR US.

173
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,958
TAKING DOWN AN ARCANE CULT IN
THE CASTLE TOWN OF LUPINAS.

174
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:21,625
WITH ME?

175
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,166
- All: YEAH!

176
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,875
- RETIRE, HUH?

177
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,875
WITH THE NEW HALL,

178
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:40,916
PERHAPS THE GUILD NEEDS A NEW
MASTER AS WELL. BUT WHO?

179
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,208
LAXUS? HE'S GOT SOME PERSONAL
ISSUES HE NEEDS TO SORT OUT.

180
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:50,750
MYSTOGAN. A SILENT RECLUSE
IS HARDLY LEADER MATERIAL.

181
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,916
OF COURSE THERE'S ERZA,
BUT SHE'S STILL RATHER YOUNG.

182
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,625
- OH! THERE YOU ARE, MASTER!

183
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,500
I'VE BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER
FOR YOU!

184
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,708
IT SEEMS THEY'VE DONE IT
AGAIN, SIR!

185
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,208
- DONE WHAT?

186
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,375
- ERZA AND HER TEAM
COMPLETED THE LUPINAS JOB

187
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,583
BUT THEY DESTROYED
HALF THE TOWN!

188
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,666
THE MAGIC COUNCIL IS
DEMANDING THAT YOU SUBMIT

189
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,166
A WRITTEN APOLOGY IMMEDIATELY!

190
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,375
MASTER? IS THERE
SOMETHING WRONG?

191
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,875
- I'M NEVER GONNA BE ABLE TO
RETIRE AT THIS RATE!

192
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,875
- YOU'RE LOOKIN' A BIT DOWN
IN THE DUMPS THERE, LUCY.

193
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,291
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

194
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,250
- IT'S THAT JOB WE DID
IN LUPINAS.

195
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,541
IT WAS NUTS.

196
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,333
NATSU KEPT SPITTING
FIRE EVERYWHERE,

197
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,375
AND GRAY FROZE THE STUFF
HE MISSED.

198
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:41,541
THEN ERZA... DON'T GET
ME STARTED ON HER!

199
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,833
- I COULD'VE WARNED YOU
THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

200
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,791
- WE WERE A BIGGER MENACE TO THE
TOWN THAN THAT CULT EVER WAS,

201
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:50,416
AND WE'RE PAYING FOR IT
OUT OF OUR REWARD.

202
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,750
IF THIS KEEPS UP I'M NOT EVEN
GONNA BE ABLE TO COVER MY RENT!

203
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,625
- WELL, I JUST HAPPEN
TO HAVE A SPECIAL JOB

204
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,291
I COULD THROW YOUR WAY.

205
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,708
THIS ONE'S RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY
AND THE BEST PART IS,

206
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,250
YOUR TEAM WON'T BE ABLE
TO DESTROY ANYTHING!

207
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,375
- YEAH?

208
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,916
- AND SO WE MOVE ON!

209
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,041
- Lucy: WOW, ONIBAS!

210
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,375
WE HAVEN'T BEEN HERE
SINCE THAT WHOLE LULLABY THING!

211
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,833
- Happy: HEY, NATSU, WE'RE HERE!

212
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,125
- Natsu: DON'T MAKE ME MOVE.

213
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,125
- Gray: SO, LEMME MAKE SURE
I GOT THIS RIGHT.

214
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,666
OUR JOB IS SIMPLY USING
OUR MAGIC TO DRAW A CROWD

215
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,208
TO SOME RUNDOWN THEATER?

216
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,125
- Lucy: YEP, NATSU'LL
IMPRESS THE CROWD

217
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,208
WITH HIS FIRE BREATHING,

218
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,166
YOU'LL MAKE
AMAZING ICE SCULPTURES,

219
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,208
AND ERZA'LL RE-EQUIP
INTO DIFFERENT ARMOR!

220
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,041
THEN I'LL HAVE LYRA SING A SONG
THAT'LL MELT THEIR HEARTS.

221
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,708
PEOPLE ARE GONNA COME
FROM MILES AROUND!

222
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:39,125
IF I EVER FINISH MY NOVEL, I'M
SURE IT WOULD MAKE A GREAT PLAY.

223
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,166
YES! THIS IS GONNA
BE MY BIG CHANCE

224
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,541
TO LEARN ALL I CAN
ABOUT THE STAGE!

225
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,041
- WHOA!

226
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,458
- PRETTY CLASSY, HUH? LET'S GO!

227
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,375
- EXCUSE ME.

228
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,583
I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU'RE THE WIZARDS

229
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,625
FROM FAIRY TAIL, ARE YOU?

230
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,625
- YEP!

231
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:57,791
- THANK YOU FOR
ACCEPTING THE JOB!

232
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,958
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW
GRATEFUL I AM!

233
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,541
- WELL, WE'LL MAKE SURE
YOU HAVE A PACKED HOUSE!

234
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,916
- ACTUALLY, ABOUT THAT.

235
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,375
UNFORTUNATELY, I'M IN A BIT OF
A PICKLE RIGHT NOW.

236
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,833
- WHAT? ALL OF YOUR ACTORS
JUST WALKED OUT ON YOU?

237
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,500
- YES. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH!

238
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,041
-THANKS FOR WHAT?

239
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:28,083
- MY LAST FEW SHOWS HAVE BEEN
COMPLETE AND UTTER FAILURES.

240
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,583
THE REVIEWS HAVE GOTTEN SO BAD,

241
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,125
THE ACTORS ARE
EMBARRASSED TO PERFORM

242
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,625
IN ANOTHER ONE OF
MY PRODUCTIONS.

243
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,875
SO THEY LEFT,
JUST LIKE MY WIFE.

244
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,958
BUT I WON'T GIVE UP
ON MY DREAMS!

245
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,708
THE THEATER IS IN MY BLOOD,

246
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,791
BUT THIS WAS MY
LAST CHANCE TO SHINE!

247
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,916
NOW I CAN NEVER REDEEM MYSELF!

248
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,208
- MAN, I THOUGHT ACTORS WERE
THE DRAMATIC ONES.

249
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:49,333
- I HAD NO CHOICE. THE
PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN CANCELED.

250
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,291
THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH!

251
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,166
- Erza: YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,
"THE SHOW MUST GO ON"!

252
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:59,375
HAVE NO FEAR! WE SHALL PERFORM
IN YOUR PLAY!

253
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,958
- HEY, IS SHE GLOWING?

254
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:04,208
- AH-- A-- EE-- EWE-- A-- OOH--
AH-- OOH--KAH-- KAY-- KEE-- KU--

255
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,000
- THAT'S SOME WARM UP
YA GOT THERE.

256
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,458
- NOW THAT I
THINK ABOUT IT,

257
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,083
THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT
COULD BE A LOT OF FUN!

258
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,583
- YA WANNA DO IT?

259
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:11,916
- WELL, THAT SETTLES IT THEN,

260
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,916
WE'RE NOT GONNA LET
YOUR DREAM DIE, SIR!

261
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,458
- REALLY?

262
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:22,000
WELL, I GUESS I'VE GOT NOTHING
TO LOSE. UGH. WHAT AMATEURS.

263
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,375
- SO, THIS IS WHEN YOU SHOULD BE
THANKING US.

264
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,833
- Lucy: WE'VE ONLY GOT ONE WEEK
UNTIL SHOW TIME!

265
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,458
- I AM PRINCE FREDERICK!

266
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:33,250
AND I HAVE COME TO
RESCUE THE PRINCESS!

267
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,000
- WHOA, I HAD NO IDEA
ERZA WAS SUCH A GOOD ACTRESS!

268
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,750
IT'S LIKE SHE WAS MADE FOR
THIS PART!

269
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,666
- MAN, WE CAN'T LET HER
STEAL THE SHOW!

270
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,500
- Gray: NO WAY!

271
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,208
- Happy: AYE, SIR!

272
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,458
- Lucy: FROM THAT POINT ON,
WHENEVER WE WEREN'T REHEARSING,

273
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,625
WE WERE HANDING OUT FLIERS
TO ANYBODY WHO'D TAKE ONE,

274
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,625
AND WORKING TIRELESSLY
TO FINISH THE SET.

275
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:55,541
I GOTTA SAY, IT WAS REALLY HARD
MEMORIZING ALL THOSE LINES.

276
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,208
BUT WE WERE SO EXCITED ABOUT
OUR UPCOMING PERFORMANCE,

277
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,625
THAT WE ENJOYED OURSELVES
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY!

278
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:01,958
- I HATE TO INTERRUPT,

279
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,000
BUT YOU'VE GOT SOME FANS
THAT ARE HERE TO SEE YOU.

280
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,250
- Everybody: WE HAVE FANS?

281
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,500
- YO!

282
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,416
- WHOA, WHAT'RE ALL OF
YOU DOING HERE?

283
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,083
- WE WOULDN'T MISS YOUR
DEBUT! NOW BREAK A LEG!

284
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,083
- IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE I'VE SEEN A PLAY.

285
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,250
- I REALLY APPRECIATE
THE INVITE, MOCKY.

286
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,666
- LONG TIME NO SEE,
HOW YA DOING, SWEETIE?

287
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,625
- I TAGGED ALONG TO
HECKLE YOU GUYS.

288
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,041
- MEAT, MEAT!

289
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,625
- THE FAKE SALAMANDER?
DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

290
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,375
- SO WHATCHA BEEN UP TO, OKRA?

291
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,750
- THAT WOULD BE BORA.

292
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,000
AFTER GETTING A HARSH LESSON
FROM YOUR BLAZING FISTS,

293
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,625
I DECIDED TO CHANGE MY WAYS

294
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,208
AND GIVE UP THE LIFE
OF A MODEL SCOUT.

295
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:40,291
- YOU DON'T SERIOUSLY THINK
ANYONE'S BUYING THAT, DO YOU?

296
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,250
- WHY ELSE WOULD I RECRUIT
YOUNG LADIES?

297
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,625
- WELL, BECAUSE YOU...

298
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,541
- SHE THOUGHT YOU WERE DOING
DIRTY THINGS WITH 'EM!

299
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,750
- I'LL BE OUT THERE
A-ROOTIN' FOR YA, ME BEAUTY!

300
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,583
- THANK YOU FOR COMING
ALL THIS WAY.

301
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,625
- AR, THAT HURT!

302
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:52,958
- HOW'S GALUNA TREATING YA?

303
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,291
