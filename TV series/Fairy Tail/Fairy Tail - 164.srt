00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,125
[LIBRA] So heavy.

163
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,708
Pisces and Libra,
you may both return now.

164
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,250
[OLGA] Geez, call it a draw!

165
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,083
'Cause This match is gonna
keep draggin' on forever.

166
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,208
Poor Yukino.

167
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,500
Don't worry, you guys!

168
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,708
I just know that our girl
is gonna pull through!

169
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,416
She's gonna win,
ain't she Sting?

170
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,666
Yeah, no doubt.

171
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,041
I'm sure Yukino's
got a lot more

172
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,083
than that in her bag of tricks.

173
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,708
I'm afraid you leave
me with no choice.

174
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,208
I'll have to open
the thirteenth gate.

175
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,833
[LUCY] Hold on,
did I hear that right?

176
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,833
Did she just say
"the thirteenth gate"?

177
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,125
[WENDY] Yeah,
that's what she said,

178
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,833
is there something wrong?

179
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,166
[LUCY] I was always
told that there are

180
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,833
only twelve Zodiac
keys in existence.

181
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,458
I heard about a
thirteenth key but

182
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,791
I thought it was just a rumor.

183
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:20,916
Apparently that key
belongs to a Celestial Spirit

184
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,500
who's stronger than
all of the Zodiacs.

185
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:26,416
This gate is one
that's rarely opened.

186
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,583
It is an omen of
very bad luck for you.

187
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,666
[KAGURA]
I don't believe in luck.

188
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,000
[KAGURA] I have never, in my
life, trusted in such a thing.

189
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,416
[KAGURA] Whatever happens
is a result of my choices!

190
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:42,791
Open.
Gate of the Snake Charmer.

191
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,000
My future
is shaped by my

192
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,750
decisions alone, not by fate!

193
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,583
[YUKINO] Ophiuchus!

194
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,833
[crowd gasps]

195
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,125
Check it out!

196
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,166
What kinda creepy
Spirit is that?

197
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,083
It's huge!

198
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,791
She said "snake charmer"!

199
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,708
But that looks
like an actual snake!

200
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,416
Whatever it is, it's scary.

201
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,666
It does exist. Ophiuchus!

202
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,458
[ARCADIOS THINKS]
A thirteenth Zodiac gate.

203
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,916
This girl is a rare gem, indeed.

204
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,916
[DARTON THINKS]
This doesn't bode well.

205
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,083
Not only are there two celestial
wizards in the tournament.

206
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:33,666
But both of them happen to
possess powerful Zodiac keys.

207
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,250
[KAGURA] Grudge Sword.

208
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,625
Archenemy.

209
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,375
[KAGURA]
Sheathed Long Sword Technique.

210
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,500
How did she do that?

211
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,291
But she didn't
draw her sword.

212
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,500
Kagura wouldn't unsheathe her

213
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,125
sword just to win
a silly game like this.

214
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,250
[YUKINO] Is this the end?

215
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,166
Your bet was ill-considered.

216
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:22,083
Sometimes a mermaid
feasts on a tiger.

217
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:51,250
[CHAPATI] It looks like
that's the match, folks.

218
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:55,583
[CHAPATI] And the winner is
Mermaid Heel's Kagura Mikazuchi!

219
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,333
I wasn't worried for a second.

220
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,541
Way to go!

221
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,791
Bet they'll never
underestimate her again!

222
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,625
I must admit that celestial
wizard was quite impressive.

223
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,625
She would've done
well against someone else.

224
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:10,958
This is crazy!

225
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,583
Team Sabertooth hasn't
been able to score a

226
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,041
single point on day two!

227
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,791
I'll bet their master's
not happy about that.

228
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:16,875
Wow!

229
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,458
That was so freakin' cool!

230
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,958
Aw, yeah!

231
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,125
I'm havin' a
hard time figuring

232
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,000
out what just
happened down there.

233
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:27,208
Was the Sabertooth girl too
weak or the other too strong?

234
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,000
The latter, I think.

235
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,833
[ERZA THINKS] I had no idea
there was someone like her.

236
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:37,291
[YUKINO] I've been defeated!

237
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,708
I've let Sabertooth down.

238
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,208
How awful.

239
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,625
Calm down buddy!

240
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,333
[KAGURA] One last thing.

241
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,333
As per our bet,
your life is in my hands.

242
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,750
Understood?

243
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,500
Yes, ma'am.

244
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,750
I understand completely.

245
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,583
[CHAPATI] Ladies and
gentlemen, that wraps up

246
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,333
day two of the
Grand Magic Games!

247
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,000
[CHAPATI] With a total
of thirty-six points,

248
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,958
the guild currently
in first place is.

249
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,750
Raven Tail!

250
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,375
[CHAPATI] Despite a
total shut-out on day two,

251
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,208
Sabertooth is still hanging
on in second place!

252
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:22,041
[CHAPATI] But now they share
that spot with Lamia Scale!

253
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,500
Their teams are tied with
a score of twenty points!

254
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,625
[YAJIMA] After scoring
ten points today,

255
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,625
the ladies of Mermaid
Heel jump up two

256
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:32,291
spots to fourth place with
a total of nineteen points.

257
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,625
[JASON] Blue Pegasus
drops down to

258
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,583
fifth place with
seventeen points!

259
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,541
Cool!

260
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,500
[CHAPATI] And falling
back to sixth place it's.

261
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,916
Quatro Puppy!

262
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,666
No.

263
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,208
You gotta be jokin'!

264
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,750
Hey, man.

265
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,041
Please tell me they're
just foolin' around.

266
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:51,125
We're not really called
"Quatro Puppy" now, are we?

267
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,250
The two of us made a

268
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,750
man-to-man agreement
in there, so yeah.

269
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,333
[BACCHUS] Alright fellas,
who's drinkin' with me tonight?

270
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,666
Let's get.

271
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,000
[ROCKER] Wild.

272
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,416
[CHAPATI] Although they
both earned an impressive

273
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,333
ten points today, the two teams

274
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,708
who are vying for
last place are...

275
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,375
[CHAPATI] Fairy Tail Team A.

276
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,125
[CHAPATI] And Fairy Tail Team B.

277
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,458
Both with twelve points!

278
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:15,666
[CHAPATI]
Who knows what exciting

279
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,333
battles await us on day three?

280
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,208
We'll see you then, folks!

281
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,875
[KING (MATO)] That was
a splendid magic game!

282
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:26,958
[ARCADIOS THINKS]
I can't believe there's

283
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:30,875
another celestial wizard.
It must be divine luck.

284
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:36,208
This means the project's
success is practically assured!

285
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,583
[DARTON]
Under the circumstances.

286
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:41,375
I've no choice but to begin
taking drastic measures.

287
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:43,958
[JELLAL] Something isn't right.

288
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,083
[JELLAL] It's the end
of day two and yet...

289
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,791
I still haven't detected
the strange magic power

290
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,875
I've sensed in years past.

291
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,791
[LEVY] As day two of the
Grand Magic Games came

292
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:59,875
to a close only five remained,
until that fateful day.

293
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,375
[ERZA] You haven't
sensed anything?

294
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,083
[JELLAL] No, not yet.
We usually detect a

295
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,708
power reminiscent
of Zeref at the games,

296
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:14,208
but for some reason,
we've yet to sense it this year.

297
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,791
Why do you think that is?

298
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:16,875
I'm not sure but I can

299
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,375
think of a number
of possibilities.

300
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:22,125
[JELLAL] Let's say a wizard
is responsible for the power.

301
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:25,000
Well, they may not be
attending the games this year.

302
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,666
Or they could
be here in Crocus

303
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,541
but they're not using
that particular magic.

304
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,125
[ERZA] Or perhaps it
could be someone in the

305
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,250
tournament who hasn't had
the chance to compete yet.

306
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,125
[JELLAL] If it's from a
device or a specific location.

307
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:40,250
Then that makes things
slightly more complicated.

308
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,583
Either the device
hasn't been activated,

309
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,041
or there's some
sort of filter that's

310
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,916
preventing the magic
power from seeping out.

311
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,583
In any case, the fact
that you aren't sensing

312
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,500
it means there's no need
for us to worry right now.

313
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,666
I certainly
hope that's true.

314
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,000
Tomorrow,

315
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,750
I'll do some investigating
of the event organizers.

316
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,250
[ERZA] Try not to draw
any attention to yourself.

317
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,041
[JELLAL] I've learned my lesson.

318
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:06,500
Ultear drove that point
home loud and clear.

319
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,583
Don't push
yourself too hard.

320
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,833
I won't.
Goodnight, Erza.

321
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,875
[JELLAL] I was
worried we'd never be

322
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:33,500
able to talk
one-on-one like that again.

323
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,000
[JELLAL] Thank you.
Erza.

324
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,375
It's later than
I thought it was.

325
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:45,333
Surely the others have
finished their partying by now.

326
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,375
[MILLIANNA] I finally found you!

327
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,208
[ERZA] Who goes there?

328
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,041
[MILLIANNA]
Well aren't you all rosy?

329
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,583
You're...

330
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,625
[MILLIANNA]
Well aren't you all rosy?

331
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,458
It's really you.

332
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,250
It's been a while, Erzy-Werzy!

333
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,000
Millianna!

334
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,208
[MILLIANNA]
I've missed you so much!

335
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,041
[ERZA] It's so good to see you!

336
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,625
Look at you;
have you joined a guild?

337
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:17,291
Yeah! I'm a member
of Mermaid Heel.

338
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,666
What about Sho and Wally?

339
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,416
Did they join along with you?

340
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,958
Are you kidding me?

341
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,625
We don't allow
any boys in our guild,

342
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,333
so they couldn't
join if they wanted.

343
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,875
Oh, I see.

344
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,458
You'll be happy to know that
they're out traveling the world.

345
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,375
I still talk to them
every once in a while.

346
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,916
That's good.

347
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,166
I can't tell you how
happy I am to see you.

348
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,833
Millianna.

349
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,000
[MILLIANNA]
Likewise, Erzy-Werzy.

350
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:46,250
[ERZA] Silly me.
I was worried about you.

351
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,000
[MILLIANNA]
Aw, please don't cry!

352
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,208
[ERZA] Sorry, but you are, too!

353
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,000
[Bacchus laughs]

354
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,791
[BACCHUS]
That wasn't half-bad, you guys!

355
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,625
But let's try it one more time;
your soul will always be.

356
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,083
[ALL] Wild!

357
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,791
Now that's the spirit!

358
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,791
You kids really know
how to party, dontcha?

359
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,416
[HAPPY] You're one to talk!
You are the party!

360
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,875
It's gettin' pretty late.

361
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,750
We should probably start
headin' back to our hotel soon.

362
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,750
What in the hell
is keepin' Erza?

363
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,375
[NATSU] Yeah, she's
been gone a long time.

364
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,041
[GRAY] She said she had
to take care of somethin'.

365
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,416
Whatever that means.

366
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,333
Do you think your arms
are gonna be okay tomorrow?

367
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,666
To be honest with ya kid,

368
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,583
I can barely feel
a thing right now!

369
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,375
He's wild, remember?

370
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,666
[BACCHUS] Whoops.
I almost forgot somethin'.

371
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,333
Tell your buddy.
It's Elfman, right?

372
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:35,333
I hope he makes
a speedy recovery.

373
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:38,166
Man. That was
a seriously wild battle.

374
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,875
Tell him I hope we
get the chance to lock

375
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,583
horns again at some point
during the tournament.

376
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,500
''Kay, I'll be
sure to tell him for ya.

377
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,208
But don't you forget that I
wanna take you on sometime, too!

378
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,208
Now you're talkin'!
There's a fight I'd love to see!

379
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:52,458
[BACCHUS] Manly and...

380
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,375
[ALL] Wild!

381
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,250
So noisy.

382
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,958
I wish they'd try
to keep it down.

383
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,208
[NATSU]
Has anybody seen Gramps?

384
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,750
[WENDY] Well, he had a
drinking contest with Bacchus.

385
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,041
He's probably passed
out on the floor somewhere.

386
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:06,875
[LEVY] Hey, Lu?

387
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:10,291
Oh, I'm so sorry, Levy
we didn't mean to wake you.

388
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,958
I needed to get up
anyway. Something wrong?

389
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,208
You look upset, are you okay?

390
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,250
That celestial wizard
from the Sabertooth guild.

391
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,333
You mean Yukino, right?

392
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,916
Yeah, she was pretty good.

393
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,541
She had really strong Spirits
and she even had that crazy

394
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,166
thirteenth one,
but she still managed

395
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,375
to lose the match somehow.

396
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:35,250
What worries me is
she bet her life on that fight.

397
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,666
[LUCY] I can't help but wonder
what's gonna happen to her.

398
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,250
[WENDY] Now that you
mention it, that is distressing.

399
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:41,875
The only people
you should be

400
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,708
worryin' about
right now is our team.

401
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:44,791
Whaddya mean, man?

402
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,750
We've still got three
more days to go!

403
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,291
We're just gettin' started!

404
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,458
Yeah, you're right.

405
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,625
All we need to worry about
is doing our best and winning!

406
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:55,750
[ROCKER] Hey!

407
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,208
You guys got some visitors.

408
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:57,875
Uh.

409
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,500
Guess you can go in.

410
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:08,166
Lyon... and ain't
that Sherry's cousin?

411
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,041
It's Shelia.
That is her name, right?

412
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,416
Whatever it is,
I've got a feelin'

413
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,458
she's gonna be
a pain in the butt.

414
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,916
[NARRATOR]
This is the inn where the

415
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,500
Sabertooth guild is staying,
Crocus Gardens.

416
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,291
[JIEMMA]
Your performance today was

417
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,541
utterly pathetic,
you miserable wretches.

418
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,625
[JIEMMA] Don't tell me
you've forgotten why we stand

419
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,833
above the other wizard
guilds in this competition.

420
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,250
[JIEMMA] We don't look
at the insects around us.

421
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,916
We don't talk to them.

422
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,375
We crush them
underneath our feet!

423
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:51,291
We're focused on something much
greater than this tournament.

424
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,208
[JIEMMA] We aim to stun
the heavens, to rouse

425
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:58,041
the land beneath us,
and silence the raging seas.

426
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,041
[JIEMMA] For, you see,
that is the Sabertooth way.

427
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:05,958
[NARRATOR] Master Jiemma rules
his guild with an Iron Fist.

428
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,083
Pity those who disappoint him.

429
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,333
[JIEMMA] Sting!

430
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:10,666
[STING] Sir?

431
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,083
[JIEMMA] I've decided
to give you one

432
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,875
more chance to redeem yourself.

433
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,625
I don't ever want to see such

434
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,416
a pitiful display
from you again.

435
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,666
Thank you, Master Jiemma.

436
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,416
I'll do my best to live
up to your expectations.

437
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,166
[JIEMMA] Yukino.

438
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,500
[YUKINO] Yes, sir.

439
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,791
There's no excuse for
what happened in your match.

440
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,500
Do you realize
what you have done?

441
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:35,750
[YUKINO] Yes, sir.

442
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,041
Please forgive me.

443
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,750
I lost to an opponent
from a lesser guild.

444
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,416
I brought shame
to Sabertooth.

445
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,083
I've tarnished our good name.

446
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:50,875
[JIEMMA] That's not
what I'm talking about!

447
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,791
[JIEMMA] You chose to bet your
life on the battle and you lost.

448
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,166
Even worse, you let your enemy

449
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,333
show mercy on
you and your guild!

450
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,250
[JIEMMA] You are an
embarrassment to Sabertooth!

451
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,500
Yes.

452
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,833
I'm fully prepared to
accept any punishment

453
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,250
that you feel
is appropriate, sir.

454
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,958
[JIEMMA] Good girl.
Then you will throw it all away.

455
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:15,458
[YUKINO] Yes, sir.
If that is what you wish.

456
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,083
[NARRATOR]
And so, day two of the Grand

457
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,583
Magic Games has come to an end.

458
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:24,250
[NARRATOR] Though still in
last place, the Fairy Tail guild

459
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,041
has finally hit their stride and

460
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,500
they've managed to
gain some momentum.

461
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:30,416
[NARRATOR] However,
they remain unaware that

462
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,041
behind the scenes
of the glamorous festival,

463
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:36,458
something inconceivable
continues to move forward,

464
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,583
little by little.

465
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:44,375
♪

466
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:13,541
[HAPPY]
I've got a riddle for ya:

467
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,041
Guess who's about
to pay us a visit?

468
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:16,250
[NATSU]
That ain't a riddle, dummy!

469
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:17,375
And why do I have to guess?

470
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:18,458
Just tell me!

471
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:19,708
[HAPPY]
No, but I'll give you a hint.

472

What's the opposite of "yes"?
