00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,208
What's that?

160
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,625
[ERZA] Simple...

161
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,708
If you're truly the
scoundrel you claim to be...

162
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,791
It'll reflect in
the way you think.

163
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,250
Therefore, I will conduct
a test of your scoundrel-dom.

164
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,791
Start by reciting the finer
points of your philosophy.

165
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,583
Uh... Erza...? Do you
really think we can afford

166
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,958
to be wasting that kind
of time with these guys?

167
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,208
No... But these
misguided fools need to be

168
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,250
taught a lesson.
And I intend to make sure

169
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,166
they learn it well,
even if it takes all day.

170
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,958
If that fails, I'll
simply beat it into them.

171
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,250
[WENDY] Now's
our chance.

172
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,166
It might sound crazy
but I think this is all

173
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,833
a part of
Erza's plan.

174
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,666
Why else would she
be egging 'em on?

175
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,166
I get the feeling she's trying
to distract them so we can

176
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,916
go looking for
the clock piece.

177
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,333
Are you sure
about that?

178
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,000
It looks like she's just
really into it to me.

179
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,958
Well either way,
Wendy's got a point...

180
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:16,041
And we've gotta take advantage
of this opportunity.

181
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,791
[CANA] Here,
keep this with you.

182
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,750
The moment I find the clock
piece, this'll let you know.

183
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:21,666
[WENDY] Right!

184
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,750
You're staying?!

185
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:26,000
Well yeah, I am
their goddess!

186
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,541
What...? No... Don't tell
me you like that getup!

187
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,166
We better get goin'.

188
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,500
[CANA] I'm startin' to
think the Legion Platoon

189
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:35,958
is the source of the leak.

190
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,291
That's what I said.

191
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,916
This is the second
time we've been stopped

192
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,166
by wannabe bandits
on this mission...

193
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,333
Maybe that was
their plan all along.

194
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,166
[CARLA] Perhaps they're
causing the very "chaos"

195
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,125
we've been worried about.

196
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,958
There's no point
fretting about it...

197
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,625
Let's just focus on what
we can do here and now.

198
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,416
"Upon the knowledge of
age-old sorcery time does rest."

199
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,833
Looks like we found the
spot Lucy told us about.

200
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,291
It matches the clue.
And I think this might be

201
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,833
where we should start looking.

202
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,791
Are you sure we'll
find it here?

203
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,791
[CANA] The Library of Sorcery
is the only place you can

204
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,958
find books full of old magic
and techniques like these.

205
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,833
Printing technology
didn't exist when most of them

206
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,666
were transcribed; which
means there are a lot of

207
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,375
hand-written manuscripts.

208
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,166
And all of these books
in this section are about

209
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,666
ancient magic, so it seems
like the best place to start.

210
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,291
[CARLA] So the clock piece has
to be somewhere among them.

211
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,333
[CANA] Talk about a
needle in a haystack...

212
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,291
[collapsing buildings]

213
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:40,541
[NATSU] Fire Dragon... Roar!

214
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,958
[DAN] Now I can't
believe I fell for that!

215
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,916
[NATSU] Fire Dragon...
Iron Fist!

216
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,166
[DAN laughs]

217
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,875
Is somethin'
funny, tough guy?

218
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,583
[DAN] Yeah, your magic
power... It's so weak.

219
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,000
Huh?!

220
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,041
I've been thinking about it
ever since our last fight...

221
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,166
Seems like your offensive power
is more for show than anything.

222
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,250
Say what?!

223
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,375
Samuel mentioned
something interesting...

224
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,583
Is it true you were
frozen in time on an island

225
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,166
for seven years?

226
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,083
I'd be willing to bet the
farm that's the reason

227
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,125
you'll never be
able to beat me.

228
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,583
You wanna test that?

229
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,125
[DAN] You don't get it do
you? While you were frozen,

230
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:28,083
I had seven years
to improve my skills!

231
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,958
I'm a completely different
caliber of wizard...

232
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:34,166
A seven year old fossil
ain't got nothing on me!

233
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,791
Keep talkin' 'cause
it'll make pounding you

234
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,208
even sweeter!

235
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:40,458
It'd take you seventy
years to match me in power!

236
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,000
If you want proof,
I can give ya a taste!

237
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:46,000
Fire Dragon... Brilliant Flame!

238
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,958
Nice try!

239
00:11:54,833 --> 00:12:01,291
[grunts and groans]

240
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,375

243
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,375

[groans]

245
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,250
Natsu?!

246
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,083
[HAPPY]
What happened?

247
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,166
You okay?!

248
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,500
[armored footsteps]

249
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:24,875
[DAN] So that's where you
were hiding, Looly baby!

250
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,291
[LUCY] Not him again!

251
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,708
[HAPPY] He loves
those silly pet names.

252
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:29,791
Gimme some sugar!

253
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,291
I've had enough of you!

254
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,375
Butt-out! Gimme
a second, man!

255
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:34,541
[shocked gasp]

256
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,875
Serves you right for gettin'
in my way, ya pipsqueak!

257
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,541
[NATSU, high-pitched] I'll
pip your squeak, jerk wad!

258
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,333
[DAN] Now then,
where were we?

259
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,833
[LUCY] Stay awaaaay!

260
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,541
You heard the lady!

261
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:50,166
I guess you're not a quick
learner either, kid. Too bad!

262
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,208
[screams]

263
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,291
Natsu!

264
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,625
[HAPPY] Uh-oh... My bad...

265
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,916
Happy...? Are you
doing that on purpose?

266
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,875
Not you, too,
Michelle!

267
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,750
[sobbing]

268
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,041
[BUTT LACKEY B] I never
knew our uniforms

269
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,125
held such a
deep secret!

270
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,000
Don't you forgetit!
This suit is your life!

271
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:18,458
[BOTH, sobbing] Yes, Boss!

272
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,583
[WENDY] What should we do
now? His story was so bizarre

273
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,083
I'm not really sure
how to respond to it.

274
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,041
[ERZA] Are you
kidding me?

275
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,666
What a lame story. As a
kid, you spilled something

276
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,791
on your shirt, so you
smeared black ink

277
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,541
all over it to hide the
stains and avoid punishment?

278
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,625
Honestly, I find
it ridiculous.

279
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,000
It's a prime example
of scoundrel-dom!

280
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,625
[ERZA] Nonsense! You are
hardly a scoundrel at all.

281
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:42,916
[BUTT BOSS] What was that?!

282
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,958
You heard me... A true
scoundrel wouldn't

283
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,666
allow his men to be so
emotionally dependent.

284
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,291
If you insist on calling
yourself their leader...

285
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,125
then you must strive to set
the highest example possible!

286
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,583
Hey, let's not forget
why we came here, okay?

287
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,416
On the ground!
One hundred push-ups!

288
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,791
A hundred?!

289
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,125
Yes, if you're going to
force your men to do them...

290
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,458
then you need to
set an example first!

291
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,750
Or are you a
half-hearted scoundrel?

292
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,875
If you aren't, you'll give
me a full hundred, easy!

293
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,958
This is your chance
to prove me wrong!

294
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,125
You little fart!
Just butt out would ya?

295
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,291
Beat her!

296
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,791
Remember, you're the one
bringing the stench!

297
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,708
So serve her up a
pungent dose of reality!

298
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,083
But a true scoundrel
wouldn't care

299
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,416
about a challenge from-

300
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,875
[BOTH] Please, Boss, you
have to beat her! For us!

301
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,416
[BUTT BOSS] Those
puppy dog expressions!

302
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,250
They're tearing
up my insides!

303
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,833
I can't take it!

304
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,375
All right, men...
I'll do it for you!

305
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,833
Now watch
closely, boys...

306
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,791
I'm only doin'
this one time!

307
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,250
Just look
at him go!

308
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,541
That's our
boss for ya!

309
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,791
'Scuse me... You might
want to pace yourself

310
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,750
a little bit.

311
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,500
[NARRATOR] It seems
the Library of Sorcery

312
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,625
is in a state of confusion.

313
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,000
Meanwhile... Lucy and
her team find themselves

00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:58,875
dealing with confusion
of a different sort...

315
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,291
[DAN] Keep shootin' at me...!

316
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,166
All you'll end up doin' is
bringing these ruins down

317
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,958
on top of your thick skulls!

318
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,208
He's got a point,
we can't use magic!

319
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,833
Put it away, Romeo.

320
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,125
Crap!

321
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,458
[DAN] Loopsy!

322
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,541
Looks like we've
got a chapel now...

323
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,708
Let's consummate our marriage
in the presence of God!

324
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,625
[LUCY screams]

325
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,916
I'm outta here!

326
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,666
[DAN] Don't fight it!

327
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,625
[ROMEO] Leave her
alone, ya creep!

328
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,791
[LUCY] Don't just stand there!
We have to do something!

329
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,375
We need to try and get
him out of the building,

330
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,875
if we can.

331
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,458
He doesn't
know the clock piece

332
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:37,416
might be hidden in here, so we
still have a chance to get it.

333
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,666
But how are we supposed
to pull that off?

334
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,250
I've got an idea!

335
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,083
I think I have
the same idea.

336
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,625
[LUCY] Awesome!
Let's hear it then!

337
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,416
[NATSU] Aw, I want
in on it, too!

338
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,375
[BOTH] You'll
act as the bait!

339
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,958
Bait...? For what?

340
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,583
[HAPPY] We have to get Dan
to lower his guard somehow!

341
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,541
[MICHELLE] And you're
the obvious choice!

342
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,291
[NATSU] Come on! Just do it!

343
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,041
You're suggesting...
what exactly?

344
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,333
Matrimony!

345
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,916
Not happening!

346
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,458
[MICHELLE] But we need
you to turn his feelings

347
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,250
for you against him!

348
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,416
I'll do it.

349
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,125
[LUCY] Dan!

350
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,541
[DAN] Yes... Looeypie?

351
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,541
Please... take me away.

352
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,458
[HAPPY] What's up?

353
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,125
[MICHELLE] I don't think
she was sexy enough.

354
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,458
[HAPPY] Yeah... We might
be askin' too much of her.

355
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,000
[heart throbbing]

356
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:36,375
[DAN] Oh, yeah! Blast off!

357
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:38,875
[DAN] Love me!

358
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,583
[giggles] Catch me
if you can, darling!

359
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,625
Oh, you know I
will, butter cup!

360
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:44,250
And then I'm gonna...

361
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,250
We got him!

362
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,708
Quick, while
he's distracted!

363
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,416
'Kay Natsu!
Now's your chance!

364
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,208
[NATSU] Hurry and get
me above him, Happy!

365
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,000
Aye, Sir!

366
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:57,666
[LUCY giggles]

367
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,833
When it comes to
strength, you might have

368
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:07,166
an advantage over me one-on-one.
But when we all work together...

369
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,375
Even the
strongest wizards

370
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,041
can't hold a candle
to us! Romeo!

371
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,250
[ROMEO] Here!

372
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,625
Fire Dragon...
Iron Fist!

373
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,750
Now that's
how it's done!

374
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,166
Aw yeah!

375
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,625
[LUCY] Phew!

376
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,750
I like him much better
when he's passed out.

377
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,208
[LUCY] What the-?!

378
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,083
[MICHELLE] The wall is shining!

379
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,708
[LUCY] Whoa!

380
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,250
[NATSU] That thing's gigantic!

381
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,500
[ROMEO] What is it?

382
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,208
[LUCY] It's the clock piece!

383
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,083
[NATSU] So that's
where it was hiding!

384
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,166
[MICHELLE] Natsu's last
attack must've caused it

385
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,250
to be revealed!

386
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,125
You got two birds
with one stone!

387
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,458
 Well yeah, that was
my plan the whole time kid!

388
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,916
Yeah, sure... We
finally found one!

389
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,416
We're still
in the game.

390
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,333
[HAPPY sobs]

391
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,791
What's wrong?
Why are you crying?

392
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,625
I'm just so proud cuz
this is the first time

393
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,041
one of Lucy's seduction
plans worked!

394
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:28,541
[LUCY] It was your plan,
you walking hair ball!

395
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:31,583
[HAPPY sobs]

396
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,000
At last...
I've found it!

397
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:38,791
[BUTT BOSS] Thir...
ty... eight...!

398
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,041
[BUTT LACKEY A]
Hang in there, Boss!

399
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,750
[BUTT LACKEY B] You can
do it! Just sixty more!

400
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,500
[BUTT BOSS]
Nope... I'm pooped.

401
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,291
[ERZA] You're nothing
but talk, after all.

402
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:50,125
[WENDY] Maybe you
should rest a bit.

403
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,041
I ain't outta gas yet!

404
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:56,333
The Butt Jiggle Gang's true
power lies... In these babies!

405
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,125
Get ready to
drop a load!

406
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,291
[LACKEYS] Right!

407
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,916
[ALL] Gas Butt
Triple... Ecstasy!

408
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,083
[WENDY] Erza! Look out!

409
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,166
[massive fart]

410
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:10,458
[farts]

411
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:14,958
[rumbling]

412
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,416
My nose is burning!

413
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,083
[CARLA] I was hoping I'd never
have to smell that again.

414
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,041
[CANA screams]

415
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,791
[CARLA] Cana! Are you okay?

416
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,125
[CARLA] Hey look...!
What's that?!

417
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,666
[CANA] A secret passageway...

418
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,916
[CANA running]

419
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,208
Guess we have that
stench to thank for this!

420
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,541
We'll see... This path
could lead to a trap!

421
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,041
[CANA] I think we
just struck gold.

422
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,625
[CARLA] Well what
do you know...?

423
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,666
I suppose we should be thanking
that horrible smell, after all.

424
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,666
[evil laugh]

425
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,083
Now do you
realize our power?

426
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,250
[ERZA] What a...
crude technique...

427
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:04,125
[ringing]

428
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:07,500
Looks like Cana and Carla
found the clock piece!

429
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,166
[BUTT BOSS] The treasure,
huh? In that case...

430
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,750
[BUTT BOSS yells]

431
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,250
[fart]

432
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,708
[BUTT BOSS] Try
Point-blank... Ecstasy!

433
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:19,916
[massive fart]

434
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,625
[WENDY] Erza, No!

435
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:28,958
[WENDY sobs]

436
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:36,458
[CARLA] So... how are we
supposed to carry it?

437
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,125
[CANA] Uh... well... hmm...

438
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:41,916
Gas 'em!

439
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,541
[farts]

440
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,125
[rumbling]

441
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,666
[explosion]

442
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,166
[laughs]

443
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,250
[BUTT BOSS] Howdya like that?!

444
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,041
Butts talk and
losers walk, ladies!

445
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,416
[yells]

446
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,291
Do you know
what you've done?

447
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,291
You've destroyed one of
my precious memories!

448
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,000
[ERZA cries]

449
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,250
Divine Retribution!

450
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:26,083
[BUTT BOSS] You haven't
smelled the last of us!

451
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,708
[WENDY] They're gone now.

452
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,791
[CARLA] Hopefully
for good this time.

453
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,666
[CANA] You alright?
You seem out of it.

454
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,000
[ERZA] I'm still reeling
from their attack.

455
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,541
Well, now that
we have this...

456
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,041
How are we supposed
to carry it?

457
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,000
[ERZA] Huh?

458
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,000
Oh, that's easy...

459
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,583
I can pack it along with
the rest of my things.

460
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,958
[LEVY] Why haven't
we found it yet?

461
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,416
Prob'ly 'cause
you're workin' your mouth

462
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,041
instead of your arms!

463
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,583
[JET] He's got some nerve
talkin' to Levy like that!

464
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:01,125
[DROY] Yeah, but we need him
to find the clock piece.

465
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,125
Is something wrong?

466
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,541
[GAJEEL] I get the
feelin' we're not alone.

467
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:11,541
Uh-oh...

468
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,666
[DROY] Where are they?
Can you tell?

469
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:28,416
[SAMUEL] Well... It appears
that I've been spotted.

470
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,375
[LEVY] He's with
the Legion Platoon!

471
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:31,916
[GAJEEL] Why are you here?!

472
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,875
[SAMUEL] That
should be obvious...

473
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:36,166
We're after the
same thing, aren't we?

474
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,291
I've come to claim it.

[HAPPY] Alright, it's
time for a Bro Test:

477
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:15,916
You and I are both hungry,
and there are two fish

478
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,958
in front of us.
What would you do?

479
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,041
[NATSU] I'd eat two fish.

480
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,208
[HAPPY] What if
there were four fish?

481
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:21,666
[NATSU] Then I'd eat four.

482
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,791
[HAPPY] Whoa! Epic Bro fail!
Are you trying to tell me

483
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:25,750
you'd let your 'lil
buddy starve to death?!

484
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,583
[NATSU] Whaddya mean?
I'd save some for ya!

485
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,250
[HAPPY] You've heard
of math before, right?

486
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:32,958
[HAPPY and NATSU] Next Time:
Defying Calculation!

487
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:35,291
[NATSU] Okay, look, if I eat the
meat and you eat the bones

488
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:37,666
then both of us get
half of each fish, right?!

489
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,708
[HAPPY] It takes guts
to be that stupid. Bro pass.
