00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,291
[NARRATOR]
On an otherwise pleasant day,

2
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,625
an egg suddenly
plummeted out of the sky

3
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:24,916
and into the midst
of our heroes.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,833
Natsu and Happy
cared for the egg,

5
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:30,250
naming the strange creature that
hatched from it, "Kemo-Kemo."

6
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:33,416
They treated the little tike
as a member of their family.

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,291
Shortly after,
a Council-initiated

8
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,375
wizard exchange program began.

9
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:40,041
Each of the top six guilds
from the Grand Magic Games

10
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:41,791
was invited to participate.

11
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,583
Natsu took this
opportunity to ask

12
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,833
the members of the other
guilds if they knew anything

13
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:49,166
about Kemo-Kemo, but his
efforts were to no avail.

14
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,291
Not even the wisest among them
had seen such a creature.

15
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,750
Upon arriving at the
Sabertooth Guild-hall,

16
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,916
Fairy Tail's group learned
the exchange program

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,541
had been cancelled due
to the abrupt appearance

18
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:02,333
of a strange island.
The Magic Council requested

19
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:05,541
that the guilds join forces
to investigate. However...

20
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:08,875
The Magic Council has
ordered me to tell you this.

21
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,625
"The island is dangerous." So...

22
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:12,875
That's it?

23
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:14,458
[LUCY gasps]

24
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,916
[WENDY] There! All finished.
Feeling better yet?

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
[NATSU sighs]
Yeah, thanks.

26
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,750
So. Anything else
you can tell us?

27
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,083
We do know this:

28
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,500
there's some being on
that island that's alive.

29
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,625
I keep my phrasing vague
because of the nature

30
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,166
of the signal we detected.

31
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,833
Human or animal, it was
too strange to identify.

32
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,708
Well, thanks for tellin' us
before we agreed to come along.

33
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,125
So then that's what
we'll be looking for?

34
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:24,041
[LAHAR] Hm. I'll be
watching from the coast

35
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,250
while you commence
your investigation.

36
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,958
Should you need support
or reinforcement,

37
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,416
launch a flare.

38
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,875

40

[NATSU]
That's weird.

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,250
How does a newly formed
island get footpaths?

42
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,875
[LUCY] Maybe people used
to live here a long time ago.

43
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,375
Like, before the island
sunk in the first place.

44
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,458
An island sinkin'
I can understand,

45
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,500
but why would it pop back up?

46
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,333
It's so weird.

47
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:03,375
But I bet those ruins would
be a good place to find out.

48
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:06,291
They look all dark and scary,
like they're haunted.

49
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:09,125
Ya know, I think
it may be haunted.

50
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,583
[ERZA] Let's split up and
investigate the area.

51
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,750
We'll rendezvous at the
ruins and go in together.

52
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,833
[NATSU] Well this is lame.
It's just a dumb forest.

53
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,666
[HAPPY] I'm gettin' pretty
hungry. When's our lunch break?

54
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,583
[CARLA] Please try to take
this assignment seriously.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,541
[gasps] Hey! Come and
check this out!

56
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,416
[NATSU, ERZA, LUCY]
Hm?

57
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,916
Whoa! Seems like this island
really was underwater.

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,916
[NATSU gasps] Those shells
look kinda familiar, too.

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
[ERZA]
Hm. I remember them as well.

60
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:47,375
From the back of the
stone tablet at Lamia Scale.

61

Woo-hoo!

We've hit the jackpot!

Deep sea fish?

65
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,000

66
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,458
Come, my lunch.
You smell so exotic!

67
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,333
The word you're searching
for is "rancid!"

68
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,250
I bet a bunch of stuff
from beneath the sea

69
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,208
got dragged up with
the island, but...

70
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,208
Somethin' still doesn't add up?

71
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,625
It's like Rogue said, there's
a full-grown forest here.

72
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,708
If the island were underwater
until a few days ago, then...

...that shouldn't be possible!

We breathed a ton of
that smoke and we're fine!

Huh?

331
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,750
[LUCY] That smoke comes from
Kemo-Kemo's body, right?

332
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,166
We were underground
with him for hours!

333

Everyone else got sick.

334

But the three of us had
a steady supply of antidote.

That smoke you're afraid of!

336

This island's alive and
it's releasing a virus.

337
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,541
But Kemo-Kemo's breath should
cleanse the whole place!

Is that Kemo-Kemo?

that he's not even an animal.

341
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,541
Strange. What happened?

342

No way. My sickness is gone.

Yes, so is mine.

344
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,583
[LUCY] I think that
he's a Nature Spirit.

345
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,000
And that he'll stop this virus
in its tracks every time

Something underneath the waves

has caused this island to sink

00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:50,333

But I couldn't save him.

443

Not so. You did right by him.

444
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,458
Think about the people
of that island.

Kemo-Kemo saved them
and yet they're gone today.

That doesn't mean
he failed them.

447
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,166
He gave them time
to love and to grow.

448
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,875
Exactly what you gave him.

449

She's right.

450

and you had fun along the way.
