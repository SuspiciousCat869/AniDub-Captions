00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,083
It's ours now!

330
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,666
It's been claimed as property
of the Butt Jiggle Gang!

331
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,791
[BUTT LACKEYS]
Smell ya later!

332
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,833
Ready the thrusters!

333
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:23,083
Unleash the Triple Gas Butt
Ecstasy Second Salvo!

334
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,375
Fire!

335
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,500
[BUTT JIGGLE GANG] Whoopee!!!

336
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,000
[HAPPY] What's
goin on up there?

337
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,166
[echoing farts]

338
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,083
Alright.

339
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,625
Let's go after 'em!

340
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,833
[CARLA] Well, my nose
has recovered, so I'm ready!

341
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,666
In your face!

342
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,208
Kiss it, wizards!

343
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:44,000
Your guild ain't got nothin'
on the Butt Jiggle Gang!

344
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,375
You may
have done this.

345
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,375
but the car can't
keep going forever.

346
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,208
Can the three of you
just keep on tooting

347
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,750
your way down the tracks?

348
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,291
Plus, if you do get where
you want to go, then what?

349
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,708
There's a lot of gold.

350
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,875
Do you know how
you're gonna carry it away?

351
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,416
[WENDY] Are you serious?

352
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,666
I would think that an expert
gang of thieves would've thought

353
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,291
that far ahead.

354
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,291
The car ain't movin'
anymore, boss!

355
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,250
How are we gonna
make it go again?

356
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:16,416
[evil laugh]

357
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,166
A true scoundrel
always has a plan,

358
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,916
so listen to me!

359
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,333
Not only does
our gang have brain power.

360
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,708
We've got brawn power, too!

361
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,166
Good thinkin', boss!

362
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,000
We'll do it
the old fashioned way.

363
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,750
roll up our sleeves,
flex our muscles,

364
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,166
and put our backs into it!

365
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,958
[BUTT LACKEYS]
No! Boss!

366
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:38,875
Mister, are you okay?

367
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,625
Do I look like
I'm doing okay?

368
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:41,916
I can help you!

369
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,416
You can?

370
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,375
Yes, sir.

371
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,500
I specialize in healing magic.

372
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:54,125
I'm not sure, but I think that
I can make you feel better.

373
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,833
Is it
working, boss?

374
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,250
Oh wow!

375
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,500
It's like the pain is just
floating right out of me.

376
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,583
That's amazing!

377
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,083
This little girl
is amazing!

378
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,750
Thanks for
your help, missy.

379
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,125
Worked like a charm.

380
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,750
You're welcome.

381
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:08,750
So, tell me.

382
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,791
If your magic
is that powerful.

383
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,291
Why don't you cast a healing
spell on your sick friend

384
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,958
down there?

385
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:18,375
[WENDY] I do have a spell
especially for motion sickness.

386
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,875
But for some
reason it just doesn't

387
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,708
work on him anymore.

388
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,208
It's my fault.

389
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,500
If I was a better wizard I
could use a more powerful spell

390
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:26,625
that could help him.

391
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,041
Don't cry.

392
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,291
I know you'll
get better someday.

393
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,041
Yeah, you're probably right.

394
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,583
Lucky for me, Fairy Tail
is full of nice people

395
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,250
that wanna help me grow.

396
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,208
And I'll always
be grateful that I was able

397
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,458
to find them when I did.

398
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,833
[BUTT LACKEYS] So sweet!

399
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,416
Thanks for
listening to me.

400
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,833
You guys seem like
super nice people, too.

401
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,041
Slow down.

402
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,000
Let's try to not get
carried away here, kid.

403
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,458
We are not nice guys.

404
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,458
We are true scoundrels
from the bowels of society.

405
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,625
That means we are
only in it for ourselves.

406
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,041
So, you never actually
answered my question...

407
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,958
How're you gonna get
the gold outta here?

408
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,541
Yeah boss, that's
a lotta booty

409
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:04,791
to be carryin' around.

410
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,500
How are we gonna pull
this thing off, boss?

411
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,000
I get it, lackeys!

412
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,750
Let's huddle up!

413
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,375
[BUTT BOSS] Is anyone
else's butt getting chaffed--?

414
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,083
[WENDY] I wish
Natsu was better.

415
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,541
I wonder what he'd do
if he were awake right now.

416
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,875
Or Lucy, what would she do?

417
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:20,750
[WENDY] That's it!

418
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:21,416
Umm,

419
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,125
Sorry to butt in...

420
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,500
What is it?

421
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,791
[BUTT LACKEY A] You wanna
give me a heart attack?

422
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,416
You guys came here
because you wanted to steal

423
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,333
the gold really bad,
didn't you?

424
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,416
I think I may have
a better idea.

425
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,166
How about I talk
to the client and ask if

426
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,583
he'll share some
of it with you?

427
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,625
[BUTT LACKEY B] You think he'd
actually go for that plan?

428
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,916
But I do have one
condition for you.

429
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,416
You gotta promise you'll
never do anything bad again.

430
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,375
Stop pulling
my leg, little girl.

431
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,625
I guess you can just forget
about getting any gold.

432
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,416
[BUTT LACKEYS] Aw, man!

433
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,000
You guys promise
to be good and I promise

434
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,875
I'll move the freight car.

435
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,750
But how are you
gonna do that?

436
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,458
[WENDY] Well, it's
a lot like the way

437
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,666
you guys did it earlier,
but a little different.

438
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,625
You can do a Gas
Butt Triple Ecstasy

439
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:02,833
all by yourself?

440
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:04,791
No!

441
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:05,666
That's not what I meant!

442
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,583
So,

443
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:07,916
I guess you got
a deal, squirt.

444
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:09,625
Lackeys...

445
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:10,708
huddle up.

446
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:11,250
[BUTT LACKEYS] Right!

447
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,750
Listen.

448
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,916
We'll pretend to go along
with her goody two-shoes plan,

449
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,375
but truly rotten scoundrels
like us would never

450
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,791
be satisfied if we didn't
take all of the booty.

451
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,916
We get her guard
down a bit and then

452
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
we take every last
brick of gold.

453
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,250
Real fiendish plan.

454
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,416
You definitely
got the brains

455
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,458
of a true scoundrel,
that's for sure.

456
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:32,000
[BUTT BOSS] Alright ya little
stinker, let's see what ya got!

457
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,041
How is she gonna do this
without the gas butt?

458
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,458
No clue.

459
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,625
She's a puny little squeaker,
but she's also part of

460
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,375
some kinda
wizard guild.

461
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,833
Maybe she's got some
crazy magical power.

462
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,041
The only thing
we can do is wait

463
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,458
to see what happens.

464
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,166
Okay, here I go.

465
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,333
Sky Dragon

466
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:55,791
Roar!

467
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:00,583
[BUTT LACKEY A] Holy!

468
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,041
[BUTT LACKEY B] That's crazy!

469
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,208
Sky Dragon magic!

470
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,166
That means Wendy!

471
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,041
Come on!

472
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,125
Let's hurry!

473
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,583
So whaddya think?

474
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,625
This should probably make up
for quite a bit of the time

475
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:14,666
that we lost.

476
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,833
Wow, you're incredible.

477
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,958
Was that Dragon Slayer magic?

478
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:19,791
Oh...

479
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,125
yeah.

480
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,291
[ALL] Will you let us
call you Little Lady Boss?

481
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,166
I've never met anyone
so incredibly powerful.

482
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,583
We would be honored--

483
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:28,583
no, thrilled--

484
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,083
if you'd agree
to be our goddess!

485
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,875
Please say yes.

486
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:35,750
And you'll get to wear your
own tiny Butt Jiggle Bodysuit!

487
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,125
Say yes, and
we'll follow you

488
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,500
to the ends of the Earth!

489
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,750
I don't know!

490
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,125
It seems like a whole
lotta responsibility!

491
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,333
Lackeys!

492
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,375
Huddle!

493
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,541
Are you serious about
all this stuff, boss?

494
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,708
Of course I am.

495
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,333
Extremely.

496
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,875
It's perfect.

497
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,916
[BUTT BOSS] If we had someone
this powerful on our side

498
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,291
we would be unstoppable.

499
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,625
There's nothing we couldn't do.

500
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,666
Which also means there's
nothing we couldn't steal.

501
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,333
[BUTT LACKEY B]
Good thinkin', boss!

502
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,875
[WENDY] What do I do now?

503
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:03,000
I guess I have to pretend
to be part of their gang

504
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,625
for a little while.

505
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,583
I have to
try to be strong!

506
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:10,000
The reputation of the Fairy
Tail guild is in my hands.

507
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:13,791
[BUTT BOSS] So, for the next
part of the plan we gotta--

508
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:14,416
[WENDY] Um,

509
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,958
excuse me.

510
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,500
[BUTT LACKEY A]
She's precious!

511
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,083
I'm so happy!

512
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,666
This is the greatest thing the
Butt Jiggle Gang has ever done!

513
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,958
So does this mean
you're gonna be our goddess?

514
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,041
[WENDY] Yeah.

515
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,583
This calls for
a special occasion pose!

516
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:31,958
What's our name?

517
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,916
[ALL] The Butt Jiggle Gang!

518
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,833
We quit movin', you guys!

519
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,666
[BUTT BOSS] Alright goddess,
do your thing!

520
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,916
[WENDY] Okay!

521
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,541
Sky Dragon--

522
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:43,541
[LUCY] Stop right there!

523
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:44,625
[BUTT JIGGLE GANG] What the--??

524
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:47,958
Natsu's still inside!

525
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,125
Cool!

526
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,708
[HAPPY] You goin'
scuba diving?

527
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:52,666
Wendy?

528
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,291
Would you care
to explain yourself?

529
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:54,875
Oh.

530
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:55,791
I'm their...

531
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,166
goddess!

532
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,166
Natsu!

533
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,541
Get up buddy, you gotta
snap out it of it!

534
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,625
[HAPPY] The train's stopped.

535
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,083
Do you feel better now?

536
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,125
Yeah.

537
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,375
The world's not
spinning anymore.

538
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:07,458
Wendy needs your help!

539
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,583
Come on!

540
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,250
She does?

541
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,375
[LUCY] Now spill it!

542
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,833
What did you do
to our friend?

543
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,250
[CARLA] If you hurt
that little girl!

544
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,125
I will go straight
for your throats!

545
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,833
I'm beggin' ya goddess,
you're the only one

546
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,166
who can save our butts!

547
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,083
Well,

548
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,458
whatever you do,
don't fight 'em.

549
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:23,916
Lackeys...

550
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,875
huddle up!

551
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,000
[BUTT JIGGLE GANG] Right!

552
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,541
Is she in
their gang now?

553
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,708
I have absolutely no idea
what the heck's happening here.

554
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,666
Or why they're
calling her "goddess."

555
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,250
Listen.

556
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,583
Maybe the plan needs to be to
stop being 'true scoundrels'.

557
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,208
Maybe you guys should try
bein' wizards instead.

558
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,125
Fairy Tail has some
correspondence classes

559
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,666
you could take.

560
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,291
I'll even put in a good word
for you if you're interested.

561
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,541
Do you mean it?

562
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,625
You care about
us bums that much?

563
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,791
These feelings are
all so new to me.

564
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,166
I've never even thought
about my future.

565
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,375
Little lady boss,
you're the nicest person

566
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,375
we've ever met!

567
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,625
[LUCY] This is
starting to get weird.

568
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,416
[CARLA] Wendy can get anyone
to like her even undesirables

569
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,625
like these.

570
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,083
It's her gift,
I suppose.

571
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,583
[LUCY] Yeah,
some gift.

572
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,291
[NATSU] Alright, you turds!

573
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,416
Natsu!

574
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
I explained to him
what's going on!

575
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,916
Wendy,

576
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,541
these bad guys are taking
you hostage, aren't they?

577
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,791
No, it's not really
like that, Happy!

578
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,583
[NATSU] You guys were just
pretending to be nice to me

579
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,625
because you wanted to
steal from my client?

580
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,250
Getting tricked
like that makes me angry!

581
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,541
No!

582
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,291
Fire Dragon...

583
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,375
Hold on, Natsu!

584
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,958
They're changing their ways!

585
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,708
[NATSU] Iron fist!

586
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,500
[LUCY] Whoa.

587
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,416
[CARLA] Just
look at them fly.

588
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,791
[WENDY] Those poor guys.

589
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,625
I don't think they were
anywhere near as bad

590
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,583
as they pretended to be.

591
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,375
[CLIENT] Just how long were
you planning to make me wait?

592
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,416
Sorry, but we ran into
some trouble along the way.

593
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,208
Ugh!

594
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,416
Why does my body hate me?

595
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,166
We're on solid
ground again, ya know?

596
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:58,958
Still,

597
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,041
I'll be halving your pay.

598
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,416
A bit harsh.

599
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,541
Hey, Wendy.

600
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,500
you need to work
your magic on this guy.

601
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:08,125
Melt his heart and
get him on our side.

602
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:11,416
Those big butt bad guys
cost us big bucks.

We ain't goin' out
