1
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,458
- Narrator: MAGIC POWER MAY BE
PLENTIFUL IN "EARTH LAND",

2
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,958
BUT IT'S QUICKLY
RUNNING OUT IN EDOLAS.

3
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:25,083
IN ORDER TO
REPLENISH ITS SUPPLY,

4
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:28,666
THE SPELL"ANIMA" WAS USED
TO ABSORB THE FAIRY TAIL

5
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,250
GUILD HALL AND EVERYONE IN IT.

6
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:34,833
TO SAVE THEIR FRIENDS,
NATSU, HAPPY, WENDY AND CARLA

7
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,833
MADE THEIR WAY TO EDOLAS.

8
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:39,333
THERE, THEY ENCOUNTERED
SOME FAMILIAR FACES

9
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:43,000
WHEN THEY STUMBLED UPON
THAT WORLD'S FAIRY TAIL GUILD.

10
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:46,375
WHILE EVERYONE DIFFERS FROM
THEIR "EARTH LAND" COUNTERPARTS,

11
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,541
THE MOST DISTURBING IS ERZA.

12
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:51,541
IN EDOLAS, SHE'S CAPTAIN
OF THE ROYAL ARMY

13
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:54,291
AND KNOWN AS THE "FAIRY HUNTER".

14
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,041
- ( theme song playing )

15
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

16
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:32,541
- Narrator: WELCOME TO THE
FAIRY TAIL GUILD IN EDOLAS.

17
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,458
- Droy: WAIT A SECOND,
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

18
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,166
YOU'RE SAYING YOU GUYS ARE FROM
ANOTHER WORLD

19
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,750
CALLED "EARTH LAND"

20
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,875
AND YOU CAME ALL THE WAY HERE
TO TRY AND SAVE YOUR FRIENDS?

21
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,166
- Natsu: YEAH.

22
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,916
- YOU'RE TELLING ME
THERE'S A FAIRY TAIL GUILD

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,250
IN YOUR WORLD, TOO?

24
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,750
- AND ERZA IS ACTUALLY ONE
OF YOUR ALLIES THERE?

25
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,291
- YOU SEEM TO BE SURPRISED.
- AYE.

26
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:52,083
- Macao: YOU WOULD BE, TOO.
THAT'S A PRETTY TALL TALE.

27
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,916
- Max: YEAH, NO KIDDING.
IT SOUNDS CRAZY.

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,083
THAT SAID, THIS IS DEFINITELY
NOT THE NATSU WE KNOW.

29
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,333
- Mirajane: HE DOES LOOK
A LOT LIKE HIM, THOUGH.

30
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,666
- YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.

31
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,041
- ( people laughs )

32
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:07,708
- Happy: KEY OF HOPE.

33
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,041
- YOU MEAN THIS LITTLE GIRL
IS THE OTHER WORLD'S ME?

34
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,291
- UH, HI.

35
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,916
- WOW! SHE'S A PIPSQUEAK
VERSION OF OUR WENDY.

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,041
- I HATE TO INTERRUPT,
BUT COULD SOMEONE TELL US

37
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,541
HOW TO GET TO THE ROYAL CITY?

38
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:22,875
- ( all exclaims )

39
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,541
- THAT'S A SUICIDE MISSION.

40
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,125
- YOUR KING WAS THE ONE WHO
PULLED OUR FRIENDS

41
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,500
INTO THIS WORLD, AND NOW
WE HAVE TO SAVE THEM.

42
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:32,375
OTHERWISE, THEY'RE GONNA BE
CONVERTED INTO MAGIC POWER.

43
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,750
IF THAT HAPPENS,
THEY'LL BE GONE FOREVER.

44
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,125
- I KNOW THIS IS THE LAST THING
YOU WANNA HEAR, LITTLE ME,

45
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,791
BUT I THINK IT'S BEST
IF YOU FORGET THEM.

46
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,666
ANYONE WHO WOULD DEFY THE KING
OF EDOLAS IS AS GOOD AS DEAD.

47
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:48,416
HE HAS A MIGHTY ARMY
AT HIS BECK AND CALL.

48
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,958
- THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH
MAGIC POWER IN OUR WORLD.

49
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,458
THERE'S NOT MUCH LEFT OF IT.

50
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,208
IT WON'T BE TOO LONG
BEFORE WE'VE COMPLETELY RUN OUT.

51
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,791
- IT'S THE KING'S GREATEST FEAR,

52
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,541
SO, HE TRIES TO KEEP ALL OF
THE MAGIC POWER FOR HIMSELF.

53
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,458
DOESN'T HE, JUVIA, DEAR?

54
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,125
- THAT'S CORRECT.

55
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:07,125
WHICH IS WHY HE ORDERED THAT ALL
MAGICAL GUILDS BE DISBANDED.

56
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,083
- AT FIRST, EVERYBODY TRIED
TO IGNORE THE ORDER.

57
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,500
BUT THE ROYAL ARMY'S
MAGIC WARFARE UNITS

58
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,666
STARTED WIPING THEM OUT ONE
AFTER THE OTHER.

59
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,958
- Jet: OUR GUILD
IS THE ONLY ONE LEFT.

60
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,958
- Max: AND IT'S NOT LIKE
WE ESCAPED UNSCATHED.

61
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,666
- ( sobs ) WE'VE LOST HALF OF
OUR COMRADES TO THE ROYAL ARMY.

62
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,416
- AND OUR MASTER,
THEY KILLED HIM.

63
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,166
- WE'VE GOT OUR HANDS FULL
JUST TRYING TO STAY SAFE.

64
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,583
- I'D STAY AWAY FROM THE KING
IF I WERE YOU GUYS.

65
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,583
GO BACK TO YOUR WORLD
WHILE YOU STILL CAN.

66
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:40,125
- NO WAY. I AIN'T AFRAID
OF YOUR KING.

67
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,416
- ( all exclaims )

68
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,000
- AND I AIN'T LEAVING WITHOUT
MY FRIENDS. I PROMISE YOU THAT.

69
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,125
- ( gasps )

70
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:06,166
- Narrator: THIS IS THE ROYAL
CITY OF EDOLAS.

71
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,916
HEADQUARTERS OF THE
JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF.

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,458
- Hughes: HOLY CRAP.

73
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,625
HAVE YOU TAKEN A PEEK
AT THAT GIANT LACRIMA?

74
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,583
IT'S THE COOLEST THING
I'VE EVER SEEN.

75
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,500
- Erza: YES, I SAW IT WHEN
I ARRIVED, HUGHES.

76
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,916
IT CERTAINLY IS EXQUISITE.

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,083
- Hughes: IT HAS THE MAGIC
POWER OF TENS OF THOUSANDS

78
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,750
OF EARTHLAND PEOPLE.
- MM, HMM. WHICH I'VE BEEN TOLD

79
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,291
IS THE EQUIVALENT OF ABOUT
ONE HUNDRED WIZARDS.

80
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,583
NOT TO MENTION, IT ALSO HOUSES
THE LIVES OF COUNTLESS OTHERS.

81
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:31,958
- AW, COME ON.

82
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,333
YOU'RE GONNA BORE ME
WITH ALL THE DETAILS, SUGARBOY.

83
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:35,708
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

84
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,583
ALL THAT MATTERS IS IT'S
TOTALLY AWESOME.

85
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,666
- Narrator: THIS IS HUGHES.
CAPTAIN OF THE ROYAL ARMY'S

86
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,625
THIRD MAGIC WARFARE UNIT.

87
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,666
- MM, HMM.

88
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,208
- THIS IS SUGARBOY.

89
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:51,000
CAPTAIN OF THE ROYAL ARMY'S
FOURTH MAGIC WARFARE UNIT.

90
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,666
AND THIS IS ERZA KNIGHTWALKER.

91
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,375
CAPTAIN OF THE SECOND
MAGIC WARFARE UNIT.

92
00:05:56,458 --> 00:06:01,041
SHE IS KNOWN,
AS THE "FAIRY HUNTER".

93
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,541
- Hughes: I MEAN DO YOU
GUYS EVEN UNDERSTAND

94
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:03,958
HOW AWESOME THIS LACRIMA IS?

95
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,166
IT'S LIKE SUPER-MEGA AWESOME.

96
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,916
- Sugarboy: MMM.
SUPER-MEGA AWESOME.

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,750
- MS. ERZA. WHEN WILL YOU WIPE
OUT THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD?

98
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:14,708
- BYRO.

99
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,166
- ( chuckles )

100
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,375
- YOU DON'T WANT TO TARNISH
THE NAME "FAIRY HUNTER".

101
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,291
- Narrator: THIS IS BYRO.

102
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:24,166
CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE
EDOLAS ROYAL ARMY.

103
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,875
- FAIRY TAIL IS THE ONLY MAGICAL
GUILD THAT'S NOT BEEN DISBANDED.

104
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,416
I REALIZE THEY'RE
DIFFICULT TO TRACK DOWN,

105
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,166
AND CONSTANTLY ON THE MOVE,

106
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:37,250
BUT HIS MAJESTY'S PATIENCE
IS AT ITS END.

107
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,958
- NO NEED TO RUSH THE LADY.

108
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,750
THE DAY THE GODDESS FELLS
THE FAIRIES IS CLOSE AT HAND.

109
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,166
- THEY THINK THEY'RE TOUGH,

110
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,041
BUT THOSE FAIRIES DON'T STAND
A CHANCE AGAINST HER.

111
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,666
THEY'RE TOAST, YOU'LL SEE.

112
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,541
- ( sniggers )

113
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:52,375
- Pantherlily: I'VE HAD ENOUGH
OF THAT LAUGH OF YOURS, BYRO.

114
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,416
- THERE YOU ARE, PANTHERLILY.

115
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,666
- I CAN'T STAND THE SOUND OF IT.
IT GRATES MY NERVES.

116
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,541
- Narrator: THIS IS PANTHERLILY.

117
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:05,750
CAPTAIN OF THE EDOLAS ROYAL
ARMY'S FIRST MAGIC WARFARE UNIT.

118
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,791
- WHAT'S YOUR DEAL, MAN?

119
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,333
YOU ALWAYS WALK AROUND ACTING
LIKE YOU'RE SO MUCH BETTER

120
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:10,166
THAN THE REST OF US.

121
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,583
WELL, GUESS AGAIN.

122
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:14,458
- YOU'D BE WISE
TO WATCH YOUR MOUTH.

123
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,500
- YOU'RE IN A FOUL MOOD,
AREN'T YOU? - HMM.

124
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,125
- Erza: IT SEEMS HE'S
DISPLEASED BY THE RECENT

125
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,416
INCREASE IN ARMAMENT.

126
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,333
- Sugarboy: WELL, AS A
MILITARY MAN HIMSELF,

127
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,541
HE SHOULD BE ELATED.
- ONE MIGHT THINK.

128
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,125
BUT OUR KINGDOM HAS NEARLY
UNIFIED THE ENTIRE WORLD.

129
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,416
I HAVE TO ADMIT, I DON'T SEE
ANY REASON FOR US

130
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,166
TO FURTHER BUILD
OUR ARSENAL EITHER.

131
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,125
- HMM.

132
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,250
PERHAPS, IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THE POCKETS OF RESISTANCE

133
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,708
STILL OUT THERE.

134
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,041
- WE'RE PERFECTLY CAPABLE
OF HANDLING THEM OURSELVES.

135
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,708
- Hughes: AW, COME ON.

136
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,916
WOULD YOU GUYS SPEAK IN
PLAIN ENGLISH FOR ONCE?

137
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
A THING YOU'RE SAYING.

138
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:57,333
- Coco: YOUR MAJESTY.
YOUR MAJESTY.

139
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:00,916
YOUR MAJESTY, YOUR MAJESTY,
YOUR MAJESTY.

140
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,958
- ( screeching )

141
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,083
- I'VE JUST BEEN TOLD THAT WE
WILL BE ABLE TO EXTRACT

142
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,625
MAGIC POWER FROM
THE GIANT LACRIMA

143
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,541
IN FOUR DAYS' TIME,
AS SCHEDULED.

144
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,291
- Narrator: THIS YOUNG LADY
IS COCO.

145
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:13,166
ASSISTANT CHIEF OF STAFF
OF THE ROYAL ARMY.

146
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,458
- IT WAS A SUCCESS.

147
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,625
- HMM, IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
- IT'S NOT?

148
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,791
- COULD YOU REPEAT
THAT ONE MORE TIME?

149
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,500
- I SAID IT'S NOT GOING
TO BE ENOUGH, COCO.

150
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,125
- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
YOUR MAJESTY,

151
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,583
OUR CALCULATIONS SUGGEST
THAT IT'S ACTUALLY

152
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,458
QUITE THE OPPOSITE.
THAT LACRIMA CONTAINS

153
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,250
THE MAGIC POWER OF
AN ENTIRE EARTH LAND CITY,

154
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,000
WHICH SHOULD BE MORE
THAN ENOUGH TO KEEP OUR KINGDOM

155
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,208
SUPPLIED FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS.
- I WON'T BE SATISFIED UNTIL

156
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,958
MY KINGDOM OF EDOLAS
IS FREE FROM ALL RESTRICTIONS.

157
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,208
- HUH?

158
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,875
- AND I KNOW THERE'S ONLY
ONE WAY THAT CAN HAPPEN.

159
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:53,083
IN ORDER TO BE FREE
WHAT WE NEED IS

160
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,416
A SOURCE OF EVERLASTING
MAGIC POWER!

161
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,250
- Narrator: THIS POWER HUNGRY
MAN IS FAUST.

162
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,916
THE KING OF EDOLAS.

163
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:09,041
- OKAY. HOLD STILL, LITTLE GUY.

164
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,500
- ( croaks )

165
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,791
GOTCHA! HEY!

166
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,000
- Carla: JUST WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

167
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,875
- HOW MUCH LONGER IS IT GONNA
TAKE US TO GET TO THE CAPITAL?

168
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,083
- WE JUST LEFT AND YOU'RE
ALREADY ASKING ME THAT?

169
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,541
- THEY SAID IT'LL TAKE FIVE
DAYS TO WALK THERE.

170
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,416
- THAT'S JUST GREAT.
WITH OUR AERA MAGIC ACTING UP,

171
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,750
I GUESS WE'VE GOT
NO CHOICE BUT TO WALK.

172
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,166
- THIS STINKS.

173
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,583
DO YOU THINK WE'LL EVER BE ABLE
TO USE OUR MAGIC AGAIN?

174
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:36,750
- I WISH I KNEW. THIS CERTAINLY
DOESN'T BODE WELL FOR US.

175
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,083
- ( croaks )

176
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,666
- ( yells )

177
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,333
- HEY, YOU WANNA LEND
ME A HAND HERE?

178
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,500
I'VE NEVER SEEN A FROG
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

179
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,625
WE SHOULD TAKE IT BACK
TO LUCY AS A SOUVENIR.

180
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,333
- FORGET IT. SHE'S NOT A FAN
OF CREEPY CRAWLIES.

181
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,583
- ( screams )

182
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:54,625
- ( gasps )

183
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,208
- Happy: HOLY MOLY, IT'S HUGE!

184
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,041
- NATSU! I THINK
IT'S ABOUT TO ATTACK US.

185
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,125
- NO WAY, FIRE DRAGON.

186
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,416
- ( all screaming )

187
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,375
- I TOTALLY FORGOT
WE CAN'T USE MAGIC HERE.

188
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,708
- I HATE TO ADMIT IT,

189
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,583
BUT I'M COMPLETELY HELPLESS
WITHOUT MY MAGIC.

190
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,291
- THEN I GUESS IT'S UP TO ME.

191
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,250
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU DOWN WITH
MY BARE FIST, YOU CROAKER.

192
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,000
- ( screams )

193
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:28,708
- OH, NO.

194
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:31,666
- ( screams )

195
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,791
- YAY, SCARY LUCY.
- THANK YOU, SCARY LUCY.

196
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,000
- QUIT ADDING "SCARY"
TO MY NAME. IT'S RUDE.

197
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,958
- ( grunts )

198
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,833
- YOU'D THINK SOMETHING
THAT BIG WOULD PUT UP A FIGHT.

199
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,375
- MAY I ASK
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

200
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,041
- ( chuckles )

201
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:03,291
- UH, I WASN'T WORRIED
ABOUT YOU, JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR.

202
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,875
- YEP, THERE'S NO MISTAKING IT,

203
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,416
YOU'RE DEFINITELY
LUCY, ALL RIGHT.

204
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,583
- THANKS A LOT.

205
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,833
- HANG ON, WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

206
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,750
- THERE'S THE ATTITUDE
WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE!

207
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,541
- I WISH WE COULD INTRODUCE
OUR LUCY TO SCARY LUCY.

208
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,000
- YEAH, I WONDER WHAT
KIND OF REACTION

209
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,125
THE REAL ONE WOULD HAVE.

210
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,791
- YOU SAY THAT LIKE
I'M THE FAKE ONE!

211
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,041
- Both: YOU ARE.

212
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,083
- TECHNIQUE NUMBER TWELVE,
BONE SNAP BRIDGE.

213
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,583
HOW'S THAT FEEL, BUDDY?

214
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:23,708
YOU LIKE THAT?
I BET YOU DO.

215
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:24,958
- Happy: SHE REALLY IS SCARY.

216
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,583
- HOW LONG ARE THEY GOING
TO KEEP THIS UP?

217
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,916
AS IF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
TO WORRY ABOUT ALREADY.

218
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,125
- Gajeel: SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
THEY'D BE CARTED OFF

219
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,041
TO SOME CRAZY PLACE LIKE THIS.

220
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:40,125
YEAH. JUST MY LUCK.

221
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,958
- Lucy: OH, I SEE.
THEY CAUGHT WIND OF YOU GUYS,

222
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,458
'CAUSE THE TOWNSPEOPLE
MISTOOK YOU

223
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:55,166
FOR EXCEEDS AND REPORTED YOU.
- THAT'S WHY EVERYONE WAS

224
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,458
SURPRISED WHEN WE TOLD
THEM WE'RE FRIENDS WITH ERZA.

225
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:00,083
- GUESS SHE'S JUST AS SCARY
HERE AS SHE IS BACK AT HOME.

226
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,291
- EXCUSE ME?

227
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,541
- I DIDN'T MEAN YOU,
I'M TALKING ABOUT ERZA.

228
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,500
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'S LIKE IN YOUR WORLD,

229
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,583
BUT IT'S HARD
FOR US TO BELIEVE

230
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,750
SHE'D EVER ALIGN
HERSELF WITH FAIRY TAIL.

231
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,458
- SHE SEEMS PRETTY BAD HERE.

232
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,041
- THERE'S NOT A WIZARD IN
EDOLAS WHO ISN'T AFRAID OF HER.

233
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,166
WHEN YOU SEE HER FACE,
YOU'RE AS GOOD AS DEAD.

234
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,333
- DEFINITELY DON'T WANT
TO RUN INTO HER.

235
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,833
SHE'S SCARY ENOUGH ALREADY.

236
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:22,583
- Lucy: WELL, HERE WE ARE.
THE CITY'S DOWN THERE.

237
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,875
- Natsu: CHECK IT OUT, HAPPY.

238
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,541
- THANK GOODNESS.
IT FELT LIKE WE WERE

239
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,041
NEVER GONNA MAKE IT HERE.

240
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:31,791
- IT'S ALL VERY ROUND, ISN'T IT?
- WELL, LET'S GET GOING.

241
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:35,208
- HEY. THANK YOU FOR COMING
WITH US, LUCY.

242
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,833
- SURE. JUST FOLLOW ME.

243
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,291
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
SOME MAGIC WEAPONRY,

244
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,000
OTHERWISE YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO MAKE IT VERY FAR.

245
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,083
- THANKS A LOT, SCARY LUCY.
- THANKS, SCARY LUCY.

246
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,875
- YOU GUYS ARE CRUISING
FOR A BRUISING.

247
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,375
- Narrator:
THIS IS THE CITY OF LOUEN.

248
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,833
- IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO,

249
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,208
THAT YOU COULD BUY
AND SELL MAGIC HERE

250
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,875
JUST LIKE ANYTHING ELSE.

251
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,333
BUT THEN, THE ROYAL ARMY
STARTED HUNTING DOWN GUILDS

252
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:00,291
AND NOW BUYING AND SELLING MAGIC
IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.

253
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:04,208
WHAT'S EVEN WORSE IS THAT
JUST POSSESSING IT IS A CRIME.

254
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:07,000
- SERIOUSLY? YOU CAN GET
IN TROUBLE FOR HAVING IT?

255
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,041
- WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO'VE
ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO USE IT?

256
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,125
- WHAT? HOLD ON.

257
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,375
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN IT
TO YOU ANY MORE CLEARLY.

258
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,458
IF YOU HAVE MAGIC,
YOU JUST HAVE TO GET RID OF IT,

259
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,458
OR ELSE YOU'LL GET BUSTED,
OR WORSE.

260
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,458
- I COULD BE MISTAKEN,

261
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,041
BUT IT SEEMS AS IF MAGIC
SPELLS ARE TREATED LIKE

262
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,208
"OBJECTS" IN THIS WORLD.

263
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,750
- HOW?

264
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,000
- TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY, THE
FACT THAT MAGIC IS FINITE HERE

265
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,958
MEANS THERE AREN'T ANY WIZARDS
WHO HAPPEN TO HAVE

266
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,791
INNATE MAGICAL
POWER, LIKE WE DO.

267
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,625
INSTEAD, IT'S STORED
WITHIN OBJECTS, LIKE LACRIMA.

268
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,750
THEY THEN COMBINE THESE
OBJECTS WITH WEAPONS,

269
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:39,750
OR DAILY NECESSITIES,

270
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,916
IN ORDER TO CREATE
MAGICAL ITEMS.

271
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,125
APPARENTLY, THESE ITEMS ARE
WHAT'S CONSIDERED "MAGIC" HERE.

272
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,000
- SO THESE WIZARDS
CAN'T CAST SPELLS,

273
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,750
THEY JUST USE MAGIC TOOLS?

274
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,875
- BASICALLY.

275
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,291
- WELL, WE'RE HERE. THERE'S
A BLACK MARKET FOR MAGIC

276
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,791
JUST DOWN THIS STAIRWELL.

277
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,041
TRUST ME, YOU'LL NEED THIS
STUFF IF YOU'RE GONNA TRAVEL.

278
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,541
- Wendy: A BLACK MARKET?

279
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,875
- LET'S SEE IT. GUESS WE MIGHT
AS WELL PLAY

280
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,625
BY THIS WORLD'S RULES
FOR USING MAGIC.

281
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:06,416
- AYE.
- MY, MY, HOW ADAPTABLE.

282
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,583
- Narrator: MEANWHILE,
ANOTHER EARTH LAND WIZARD

283
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,291
HAS APPEARED IN EDOLAS.

284
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:15,250
HE IS CURRENTLY MAKING HIS WAY
THROUGH THE SAME CITY OF LOUEN.

285
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,666
- NOW WHAT? WHERE AM I SUPPOSED
TO GO FROM HERE?

286
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,375
WELL, I GUESS I'LL JUST
HAVE TO START ASKING AROUND.

287
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,291
YO, MIND IF I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

288
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,375
GET BACK HERE.

289
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,125
MAN! THE PEOPLE HERE
IN EDOLAS MAKE THE JERKS

290
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,833
I HAVE TO DEAL WITH BACK HOME
LOOK LIKE A BUNCH OF ANGELS.

291
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,458
- ( all sniggering )

292
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,291
- ONE THING IS THE SAME
NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO.

293
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:55,291
THERE'S ALWAYS SOME CLOWNS WHO
CAN BE CONVINCED TO HELP YOU.

294
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,416
- YOU LOOKING TO START
SOMETHING WITH US, PUNK?

295
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,250
- STEP OFF, YOU LOUSY HORSEFLY.

296
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,458
- YOU GOT TO LOT TO LEARN
ABOUT INSULTS, PAL.

297
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,958
- AH, CUT THE CRAP.
WE AIN'T GOT TIME FOR A LECTURE.

298
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,958
- YOU DON'T LIKE "HORSEFLY",
HOW'S "MAGGOT"?

299
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,291
- ( laughs )

300
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,833
- IT WASN'T THAT FUNNY.

301
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,208
- ( screams )

302
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,583
- Both: THAT'S IT.
YOU WANNA PIECE OF ME?

303
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,375
- ( chuckles )

304
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,041
- ( groans )

305
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,875
- LISTEN, A GIANT LACRIMA
SHOULDA POPPED UP SOMEWHERE

306
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,166
AROUND HERE RECENTLY.

307
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,208
AND YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME
WHERE TO FIND IT.

308
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,291
SO START TALKING.

309
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,500
- I DUNNO WHERE IT IS.

310
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:36,208
- THAT SO? THEN LET ME
JOG YOUR MEMORY.

311
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,458
- PLEASE DON'T HIT ME.

312
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:40,166
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW.
I SWEAR, RIGHT? FELLAS?

313
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,708
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.
GUESS I'LL ASK SOMEONE ELSE.

314
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,958
YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK.
NOW GO GET LOST.

315
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,458
- WHAT'S WITH YOU, GAJEEL?

316
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,625
HOW IN THE HECK DID YOU GET
SO STRONG ALL THE SUDDEN?

317
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,375
- NO JOKE. I NEVER TOOK
YOU FOR THE KINDA GUY

318
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,791
WHO'D GO AROUND PICKING
FIGHTS WITH PEOPLE.

319
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,125
- THEY MUST BE
TALKING ABOUT

320
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,666
SOME OTHER VERSION
OF ME IN EDOLAS.

321
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,625
TELL ME. WHAT DOES THE GAJEEL
HERE DO FOR A LIVING?

322
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:05,833
- All: HUH?

323
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,916
- I'M NOT HIM.
WE JUST LOOK ALIKE, OKAY?

324
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,916
- YOU JOKING? COME ON,
YOU LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THE GUY.

325
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,375
- JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION.

326
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,625
TELL ME WHAT HE DOES, OR EAT A
KNUCKLE SANDWICH.

327
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,208
- HE'S ONE OF THEM
FREELANCE JOURNALISTS

328
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,500
AND HAS A REPUTATION
FOR BEING WAY TOO NOSY.

329
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:19,791
- A JOURNALIST?

330
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,583
- YEAH, THAT GUY'S WRITTEN
A BUNCH OF MAGAZINE

331
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:22,416
AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES

332
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,875
RAGGING ON THE KING.

333
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,875
- HE'S A REAL BUSYBODY,
SO NO ONE IN TOWN CAN STAND HIM.

334
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,875
- WELL, THAT EXPLAINS
WHY NOBODY WILL GIVE ME

335
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,375
THE TIME OF DAY HERE.

336
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,708
THIS GAJEEL'S A
FREELANCE JOURNALIST.

337
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,583
BETTER GET THE SCOOP ON HIM.

338
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,416
- ( sniggers )

339
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,333
- OH, TAKE A LOOK AT ALL
THE WEIRD STUFF

340
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,750
THEY'VE GOT FOR SALE.

341
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,666
- THIS HAS TO BE THE MUSTIEST
SHOP I'VE EVER BEEN IN.

342
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,916
- ( laughs ) THAT'S BECAUSE
IT'S FULL OF PRICELESS,

343
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,625
HISTORICAL ANTIQUES, MY DEAR.

344
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,958
THE MOLD, SCRATCHES,
AND UNPLEASANT SMELLS

345
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,208
ARE WHAT SETS MY ITEMS APART
FROM THE REST.

346
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,541
THEY HAVE "FLAVOR".

347
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,333
- THAT'S GREAT, BUT WE DON'T
CARE ABOUT "FLAVOR".

348
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,416
USABILITY IS WHAT MATTERS
MOST TO US.

349
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,833
THERE ARE LOTS OF COUNTERFEITS,

350
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,125
SO BE SURE TO DOUBLE CHECK
EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU BUY.

351
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,875
- EXCUSE ME, MISTER.
YOU GOT ANY FIRE MAGIC?

352
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:08,791
- ( laughs ) I THINK I MAY HAVE
JUST WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

353
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,875
THIS CONTRAPTION
STRIKE YOUR FANCY?

354
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,458
THIS IS THE EDOLAS MAGIC
SEALED FLAME SWORD.

355
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:17,208
YOU JUST PUT THIS IN HERE
AND VOILA! PRETTY COOL, HUH?

356
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:20,125
- THAT FLAME LOOKS AWFULLY WEAK,
BUT IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING.

357
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,208
- WHAT A KEEN EYE YOU HAVE, SIR.

358
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,208
- CAN WE GET THIS ONE? PLEASE?
- WHY DO YOU WANT IT?

359
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,291
- LOOK HOW CUTE AND TINY IT IS.

360
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,250
- COME NOW. YOU KNOW
BETTER THAN TO CHOOSE

361
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,791
BASED ON "CUTENESS", CHILD.

362
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,333
- THIS PRETTY, LITTLE GIZMO'S
CALLED AN AIR CLEFT CANNON.

363
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:36,041
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PULL THESE
TWO PIECES APART TO OPEN IT

364
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,916
AND THEN WATCH IT
WORK ITS MAGIC.

365
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,125
- ( exclaims )

366
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,791
- OH, WOW, IT'S WIND MAGIC.
THIS WILL BE PERFECT FOR ME.

367
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,583
- WHAT A KEEN EYE
YOU HAVE, MISS.

368
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,416
- OKAY, WE'LL TAKE BOTH OF THEM.

369
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,708
- GREAT, THANK YOU
FOR YOUR BUSINESS.

370
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,875
TOGETHER THEY'LL COST YOU
TWENTY THOUSAND,

371
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,541
BUT I'LL KNOCK THE
PRICE DOWN TO EIGHTEEN

372
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,208
JUST BECAUSE I LIKE YOU,
HOW DOES THAT SOUND?

373
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,833
- THAT SOUNDS REALLY EXPENSIVE.

374
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,666
- WELL, THESE ITEMS ARE
INCREDIBLY HARD TO COME BY, SIR.

375
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,166
- WAIT A SEC. PROBABLY,
SHOULD'VE ASKED THIS FIRST.

376
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,666
BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY MONEY?

377
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,666
- ( laughs ) WHAT WOULD
MAKE YOU THINK

378
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,583
THAT WE'D HAVE ANY MONEY?

379
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,208
- THAT'S NOT FUNNY, JERK.

380
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,958
- I WOULD PAY, BUT ALL I'VE GOT
IS CRACKERS IN MY POCKET.

381
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,958
- COME ON, LUCY, PAY THE MAN.

382
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,000
- I HATE TO ADMIT IT,
BUT BEING BOSSED AROUND

383
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,333
IS KIND OF A NICE CHANGE.

384
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:18,916
- HEY, IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

385
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
OKAY, FINE. I'LL PICK UP
THE TAB FOR YOU,

386
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,083
BUT JUST THIS ONCE.

387
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,333
- NO. I COULDN'T TAKE YOUR MONEY

388
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,000
AFTER ALL YOU'VE DONE
FOR ME, MISS LUCY.

389
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,875
MY SHOP'D BE CLOSED IF YOU
HADN'T HELPED ME

390
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,458
WHEN THE ROYAL ARMY SEARCHED IT.

391
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,416
- COME ON, THAT WAS NO BIG DEAL.
I WAS JUST LENDING YOU A HAND.

392
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,375
- IN ANY CASE, I WOULD BE
DELIGHTED IF YOU'D TAKE THEM

393
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,583
AS A PRESENT FROM ME.

394
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,041
- YOU SURE? THANKS,
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

395
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,916
- NO JOKE. THANKS A LOT, POPS.

396
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,666
- SCARY LUCY'S MUCH
MORE DEPENDABLE

397
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,916
THAN THE LUCY WE'RE STUCK WITH,

398
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,166
DON'T YOU THINK?

399
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,375
- I TOLD YOU TO DROP
THE "SCARY", FUR BALL.

400
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,833
- FROM THE WAY
THAT GUY WAS TALKING,

401
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,791
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
A PRETTY BIG DEAL AROUND HERE.

402
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,916
- IS THERE SOME WAY
WE CAN PAY YOU BACK?

403
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,208
- WELL, THERE'S ONE THING.
IF YOU GUYS WOULDN'T MIND,

404
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,541
I'D LIKE TO HEAR A
LITTLE MORE ABOUT

405
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,041
THIS OTHER "LUCY" OF YOURS.

406
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,583
- ( laughing )

407
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,916
- WAIT, YOU'RE KIDDING,
I'M WRITING A NOVEL?

408
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,625
AND I'M SOME RICH GIRL
WHO DOES MAGIC

409
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,250
WITH SPIRITS AND KEYS?

410
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,333
- YOU'RE CERTAINLY
JUST AS OBNOXIOUS AS SHE IS.

411
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,125
- DON'T CALL ME OBNOXIOUS!

412
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,958
- I CAN'T SEEM TO REMEMBER
HOW TO USE THIS THING, DO YOU?

413
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,333
- DUMMY! DON'T GO PULLING
THAT OUT IN PUBLIC.

414
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,458
LIKE I TOLD YOU.
MAGIC IS BANNED IN OUR WORLD.

415
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,666
YOU CAN GET IN BIG TROUBLE
JUST FOR HAVING THAT THING.

416
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,708
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

417
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,041
- SO, MAGIC USED TO BE A PART
OF EVERYDAY LIFE HERE

418
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,458
LIKE IT IS IN OUR WORLD?

419
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:36,041
- IT USED TO.
BUT NOW THINGS'VE CHANGED.

420
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,625
THE KINGDOM WENT AND STOLE
A PART OF OUR CULTURE FROM US.

421
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,291
- WHY'D THEY WANNA DO THAT?

422
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,166
- BECAUSE THEY WANNA KEEP THE
MAGIC POWER ALL TO THEMSELVES.

423
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,625
- WELL, IF THOSE
ROYAL JERK-WADS

424
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,083
AREN'T GONNA GIVE THE
PEOPLE THEIR MAGIC BACK,

425
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,166
THEN I GUESS WE'LL JUST
HAVE TO GO BEAT THEM UP FOR IT.

426
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,041
- WHAT? THAT'S THE CRAZIEST
THING I'VE EVER HEARD.

427
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,500
THERE'S NO WAY
WE'D STAND A CHANCE

428
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,000
AGAINST THE MASSIVE ROYAL ARMY.

429
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,708
- IF THAT'S TRUE, THEN WHY'RE
YOU TAGGING ALONG WITH US?

430
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,041
- WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

431
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,166
YOU SAID YOU GUYS NEEDED
AN ESCORT TO THE CAPITAL.

432
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,208
I DIDN'T COME OUT HERE
TO FIGHT ANYBODY.

433
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,000
- OKAY. IF YOU SAY SO.

434
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,875
- THERE THEY ARE.
- CORDON OFF THE AREA.

435
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,541
- THE ROYAL ARMY.

436
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,750
- YOU'RE FAIRY TAIL WIZARDS,
AREN'T YOU?

437
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,166
- STAY RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE.

438
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,416
- HOW'D THEY FIND US?

439
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,458
- ( gasps )

440
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,208
- CAPTURE THEM.
- LET'S GO, MEN.

441
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:25,375
- AW, YEAH. IT'S TIME
TO TRY OUT MY NEW MAGIC.

442
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,291
- NO.

443
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,041
- HERE GOES NOTHING, FIRE.

444
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,666
- HEY, CARLA, DO YOU
REMEMBER HOW TO USE THIS?

445
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,000
- HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

446
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,125
- THAT'S HOW WE ROAST
THEM BACK WHERE I'M FROM.

447
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,125
THEY'VE GOT SHIELDS?

448
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,708
ANOTHER BLAST COMING AT YOU.

449
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,041
- I TOLD YOU THAT MAGIC
IS LIMITED HERE.

450
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,583
THERE'S ONLY A CERTAIN
NUMBER OF TIMES

451
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:45,833
THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO USE IT.

452
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,833
- (yells ) IT'S ONLY
GOOD FOR ONE BLAST?

453
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,166
- IN TERMS OF OUTPUT,

454
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,125
YOU JUST USED IT OVER A
HUNDRED TIMES, YOU IDIOT.

- WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

465
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,041

479
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,833
'CAUSE OUR MAGIC
DOESN'T WORK HERE.

480
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,000
