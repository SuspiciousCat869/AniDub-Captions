What is this guy?

9
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,208
Yajima, no!

[YAJIMA screams]

18
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,291
Mr. Yajima!

19
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:09,250
Fairy Machine Gun. Leprechaun!

20
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,416
You're helpless.

21
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,458
[CROWD shouts]

Ever!

24
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,833
He creamed us.

25
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:27,333
[YAJIMA wheezes]

26
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,416
Who the hell are you?

27
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,500
[STRANGER]
I have no name.

28
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,833
Though humans
have a word for me.

29
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:40,208
They call me disaster.
A force of nature.

30
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:43,583
[BIXLOW grunting] What's with
his magic? I can't move!

31
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:46,250
And he's barely even touched us.

32
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:48,291
[STRANGER]
The netherworld gate has opened.

33
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,958
--Humanity will be judged.
--[YAJIMA groaning]

34
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:54,416
Netherworld gate?

35
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,958
He's from Tartaros.
No doubt about it.

36
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:01,250
[FRIED] So, that means
it wasn't just the nine.

37
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:05,041
They're going after former
members of the Council, as well.

38
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,666
But why? What could
Tartaros be after?

39
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,333
Say your prayers.

40
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,625
Let him go!

41
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,833
--[STRANGER] Too late.
--[YAJIMA screams]

42
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,333
Yajima!

[STRANGER growls]

44
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,583
[YAJIMA]
Uh.

45
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,083
[FRIED]
Uh!

46
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,083
[BIXLOW]
Mm.

47
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,791
[STRANGER]
Mm.

48
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,958
[LAXUS] Those are my
pals you're messin' with.

49
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,958
If you thought you're
getting away with this,

50
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,375
you're in for a real shock.

51
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,166
'Bout time, Laxus!

52
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,666
[BIXLOW chuckles]

53
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,916
Now it's his turn.

54
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,041
This guy. Who is he?

55
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:02,125
He's with Tartaros! He
came here to kill Yajima!

56
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,041
That so?

57
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,333

00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,000

66
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,166
I missed?

[TEMPESTER groans]

70
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:04,708
Stand still. Coward!

71
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,083
Is this still enough for ya?

72
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,708
[LAXUS]
Lightning Dragon Jaw!

73
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,875
Nicely done, Laxus!

74
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:28,833
I'll say!

75
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,458
No one's as manly as you.

76
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,208
[ELFMAN sneezes]

77
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,041
[LAXUS] So what should
we do with him now?

78
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,583
I'm all ears, Yajima.

79
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,375
Well, I would say

80
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,583
that we should take
him to the Council.

81
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,708
If there still
was one, that is.

82
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,125
The HQ's gone, sure,

83
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,583
but they've got other
outposts, don't they?

84
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,541
He has quite a few
questions to answer.

85
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,458
Why not take him
back to the guildhall?

86
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,916
Just leave him in
a room with me,

87
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and I can guarantee he'll talk.

88
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,541
[EVERGREEN chuckles]

89
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,791
Moving along. They might've
gone after the current council

90
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,250
for any number of
reasons, but retirees?

91
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,125
I don't understand the motive.

92
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:01,958
Me neither.

93
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,875
Enhanced interrogation time?

94
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,333
Enough with the
sausage, okay?

95
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:12,333
[STRANGER groans] So, you're
with Fairy Tail, are you?

96
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,375
[BIXLOW, FRIED]
Uh?!

97
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,291
[EVERGREEN gasps]

98
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,791
[YAJIMA]
Hm?

99
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:19,875
[STRANGER] I misjudged you.
Never imagined I'd encounter

100
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:23,416
your kind of power
on the surface.

101
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,041
No matter though.
All I have to do is die.

102
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:30,416
Shut up. Nobody's
gonna die, all right?

103
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,500
[STRANGER] A great number
of people are about to die,

104
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,166
and we'll be the first.

105
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,583
[LAXUS]
Uh.

106
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,500
He blew up?

107
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:40,583
But why?

108
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,041
[BIXLOW, FRIED]
Uh!

109
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,625
Strange. He left
some sort of mist.

110
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,291
It looks like it's spreading.

111
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:54,000
[STRANGER]
Mankind cannot escape disaster.

112
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,333
[LAXUS]
Tsch.

113
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,708
[STRANGER] The mist is
rife with Bane Particles.

114
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:01,666
As it spreads, they will destroy
any ether-nano they can find.

115
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,375
But Ether-nano's inside
all living things! [coughs]

116
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,875
[YAJIMA coughs]

117
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,750
[STRANGER] Right you are.
Which is why this mist causes

118
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:14,541
Magic Deficiency Syndrome
and bane sickness.

119
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:15,958
[BIXLOW coughing]

120
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,833
[STRANGER] First, you'll
be stripped of your powers.

121
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:22,250
And then you'll be
stripped of your lives.

122
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,250
[BIXLOW choking]

123
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,666
[STRANGER] I would've
begun with this attack,

124
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,708
but, I have to go
back to Tartaros

125
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,333
and get reborn
every time I use it.

126
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:34,000
[LAXUS choking]

127
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:40,125
[STRANGER] That means I'll see
you soon. In the Netherworld.

128
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,833
[FRIED]
Try not to breathe it in!

129
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,500
[EVERGREEN]
It's everywhere. What do we do?

130
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,166
[BIXLOW] The whole town'll
be infected soon!

131
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,416
[YAJIMA]
We can't just stand around here!

132
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,500
Our only hope is to run for it!

[FRIED grunts] Bixlow! Ever!
You have to resist!

137
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,791
[LAXUS] No one else is gonna
die here! Not while I'm around!

138
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,166
[FRIED]
Laxus, shield your mouth!

[LAXUS inahaling]

143
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:35,125
[LAXUS] That's twice you've
misjudged me, "Disaster".

144
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,250
First, you underestimated
the strength of my magic.

145
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,958
Now you've done the
same with my lungs.

146
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,208
[FRIED] Please Stop.
You'll kill yourself!

147
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,833
[LAXUS inhales]

148
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,125
No way you're talkin'
me outta this,

149
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,666
but you can make sure
they get home safe.

150
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:07,500
[FRIED]
Laxus!

151
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,500
What happened to them?

152
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,875
Whatever it is, tell
me you can fix it!

153
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,125
They'll be okay! Won't they?

154
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,916
[PORLYUSICA]
They've been heavily exposed

155
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,750
to Bane Particles.
I'll do what I can.

156
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,583
But far smaller exposures
than theirs have proven

157
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:40,041
lethal in the past. Recovery is
possible, but not guaranteed.

158
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:43,333
Or even likely.

159
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:44,875
[panting]

160
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,000
[PORLYUSICA] Loxus's case is
many times worse than the rest.

161
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:51,291
It's a miracle he's
lasted this long.

162
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,916
[FRIED]
Master.

163
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,208
[ALL]

these wizards know about
the nature of Tartaros,

the whereabouts of other
former council-members,

been targeted.

Today, we go to war!

Our foe is a pillar
of the Baram Alliance.

As strong as Grimoire heart
and the Oración Seis.

from their allies' mistakes.

the bloodied remnants
of their guild

will look back on
this day and rue it.

For this is the day they made
an enemy of Fairy Tail.

They've attacked our brethren.
The pain they've caused

is mine and yours. The blood
they've spilt is our blood.

Now it is time for the
blood not shed to boil.

our burning rage.

Let us fight not for justice,

in our souls.

00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:16,208
How did you find
where I live, anyway?

319
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,333
If you gotta problem, I'm sure
we can work it out cat-to-cat.

320
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,291
Who are you callin' a cat?

321
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,750
I know all about your
troublesome guild,

322
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,375
and I would like nothin'
to do with it.

323
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,833
Good luck. I hope
your plan succeeds.

324
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:30,208
But you'll have to find
someone else to use as bait!

325
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,583
Tartaros would've come for you
regardless of whether we showed

326
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,875
up to help or not, so I
wouldn't call you 'bait'.

327
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,791
Oh, and by the way,
you're welcome.

328
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:40,208
Think I'm stupid? Well I'm not
stupid enough to stick around

329
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,041
here after what
you just told me.

330
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:45,041
I'm gonna hit the bricks,
and don't follow me.

331
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,958
[MICHELIA] Hey! They came a
long way to see you, Grandpa.

332
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,333
Don't be rude.

333
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,833
[MICHELLO]
You're not my boss.

334
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,083
[WENDY] She's the one that
did the things with Loke!

335
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,458
We should do what
we can to help.

336
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,958
The entire council
was wiped out.

337
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,041
[MICHELLO]
Hmph.

338
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,916
You used to be a
part of that Council.

339
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,666
You can't just ignore
what happened!

340
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,916
[MICHELLO]
Mm...

341
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,750
Also, any guesses
as to why this guild

342
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,791
is targeting
council members?

343
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,541
Could be a number of reasons.

344
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,791
Council's ticked off
a lot of wizards.

345
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,166
More'n this old mind
can keep track of.

346
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,541
This isn't about some grudge.
Their process is too methodical.

347
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,666
They're doing this
to achieve a goal.

348
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,083
I'm Sorry, but I've no
idea what that might be.

349
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,125
No, wait. There is something.

350
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,750
Some awful thing.

351
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,375
Called "Face".

352
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,291
[LUCY, WENDY grunt]

353
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,166
[NATSU]
Uh! Everyone down!

354
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:33,666
[WENDY, LUCY grunt]

355
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,500
What is it?

356
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:35,750
That goes for you too!

357
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:36,833
--[MICHELIA screams]
--[MICHELLO grunts]

358
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:37,791
Get ready.

359
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,166
For what?

360
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:41,541
[NATSU grunts]

361
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,166
No! Please, not my
beautiful house!

362
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:50,000
--[LUCY groaning]
--I think we're under attack!

363
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,333
Is everybody okay?

364
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,125
--[HAPPY] Aye.
--[MICHELLO, LUCY, WENDY grunt]

365
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:05,083
That explosion was massive.
How are we alive?

366
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:11,291
[NATSU grunts] Haven't eaten
that fast since Tuesday.

367
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:12,333
[MICHELIA]
E-Eaten?

368
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:13,833
[belches]

369
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,708
Nice one!

370
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,000
[LUCY gasps]

371
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,250
[JACKAL]
And here I was,

372
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,625
thinkin' you'd be too
blown up to tell apart.

373
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:22,958
Who're you?

374
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,625
That's how it was with the
magic council. [laughs]

375
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:30,583
--[WENDY] Uh...
--[HAPPY, CARLA gasp]

376
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,583
You're with Tartaros, aren't ya?

377
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,750
[JACKAL]
Yeah. Who's askin'?

378
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,166
[NATSU]
Natsu of Fairy Tail.

379
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:41,083
Brace yourself.
I'm gonna hurt ya.

380
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:16,083
[LUCY] Jackal the demon Gate
is intent on killing Michello.

381
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:19,291
But thanks to Natsu,
his surprise attack failed.

382
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:23,125
Now Fairy Tail's pyro faces off
against Tartaros' bombardier,

383
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:24,916
while the rest of us take cover.

384
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,875
What is Tartaros' goal here?

385
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:29,250
Why are they hunting down
old members of the council?

386
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,791
And what about this "Face"
that Michello mentioned?

387
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:33,708
Why is he so scared of it?

388
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:37,791
Next time: Tartaros Chapter,
Prologue - The White Legacy

389
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:40,875
It will be the fireworks
show that started a war.
