1
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:19,625
Natsu:
PREVIOUSLY, ON "FAIRY TAIL"...

2
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:22,250
- Lucy: THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
AS IF IT WEREN'T BAD ENOUGH

3
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,000
NIRVANA'S BEEN ACTIVATED,
NOW FIRE BREATH AND I

4
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:25,541
ARE DRESSED LIKE
A CHEESY COUPLE.

5
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,208
- Cobra: I CAN HEAR YOU.

6
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:28,958
- AND THE ONLY WAY
NATSU CAN FIGHT COBRA

7
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:30,708
WITHOUT GETTING MOTION SICK
IS IF I CARRY HIM.

8
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:32,625
- I CAN HEAR YOU. 
- Natsu: AHH!

9
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,666
WE BETTER THINK OF A WAY
TO STOP THESE GUYS, AND FAST!

10
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,208
- Cobra: I CAN STILL HEAR YOU!

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,666
- ( theme music playing )

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,416
- ( singing in Japanese )

13
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,458
- Happy: WHOA!
LOOK OVER THERE.

14
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,083
- Natsu: WHAT'S UP?

15
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,583
- I THOUGHT THAT MAGIC CIRCLE
DISAPPEARED

16
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,708
AFTER THE LAST ATTACK.
EITHER WE MISSED IT,

17
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,708
OR SOMEBODY PUT A NEW ONE
IN ITS PLACE.

18
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,750
- WHAT'S IT MATTER?
I BET IF WE TAKE DOWN

19
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,208
THAT BIG GUY WITH THE TATS,
IT'LL VANISH FOR GOOD.

20
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,208
- YOU MAKE IT SOUND EASY.

21
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,958
BUT YOU'RE DEAD WRONG.

22
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,500
- OH YEAH?
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US.

23
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:37,916
- WHEN WE WORK AS A TEAM,

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,750
THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS WORLD
THAT CAN STOP US!

25
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,875
- COBRA, HANDLE THOSE FOOLS
FOR ME.

26
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:46,500
- WITH PLEASURE. CUBELLIOS
COULD USE A SNACK RIGHT NOW.

27
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,250
- ( hissing )

28
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,458
- SWALLOW ME,
YOU'LL GET A NASTY HAIRBALL.

29
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,500
- AND A WICKED CASE
OF HEARTBURN.

30
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,541
- ( Happy speaking )

31
00:02:58,625 --> 00:02:59,583
- GO, CUBELLIOS!

32
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:04,416
- Natsu: NOW WHAT?
- FIRE AT HIM!

33
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,875
DO IT NOW!
- FIRE DRAGON BRILLIANT FLAME!

34
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,958
- YOU MISSED HIM!
- THAT'S OKAY.

35
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,166
I'M JUST GETTING WARMED UP!

36
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,291
AW, MAN,
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

37
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,333
- YOU DIDN'T EVEN HIT HIM ONCE.
SO MUCH FOR WARMING UP.

38
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:26,083
- I THREW AS MANY FIREBALLS
AS I COULD,

39
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,583
SO ONE OF THEM SHOULD
HAVE HIT HIM. WHAT GIVES?

40
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,708
- PRETTY SURE IT DOESN'T WORK
THAT WAY.

41
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,250
- I TOLD YA,

42
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,416
I KNOW YOUR MOVES
BEFORE YOU MAKE 'EM.

43
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,750
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'RE GONNA LAND A HIT ON ME.

44
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,708
- YEAH YEAH, WHATEVER.

45
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,166
SUPERSONIC HEARING AIN'T GONNA
KEEP YOU FROM GETTIN--

46
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,625
AH AHH!
- WHAT'S WRONG?

47
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:44,916
YOU FEELIN' OKAY?

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,041
- Cobra: EAT IT, CHUMP!

49
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:53,083
- PULL UP!
- AYE, SIR!

50
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,583
- GOOD JOB, 'LIL BUDDY.
THAT WAS CLOSE.

51
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,958
- I DON'T SEE HIM.
WHERE'D HE GO?

52
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,291
- AHH!

53
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,208
- RUN ALL YOU WANT TO.

54
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,666
IT JUST MAKES HUNTING YOU
WEAKLINGS ALL THE MORE FUN.

55
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,041
- THAT JERK.

56
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,625
I'LL MELT THAT GRIN
OFF HIS FACE.

57
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,375
- HE MUST BE ONE LONELY DUDE.

58
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,583
THE LADIES DON'T GO
FOR THE SUPER-COCKY TYPES.

59
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,833
- HEY, STOP FOR A SEC.
- HUH?

60
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,791
- SHHHH.
- WHY?

61
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,708
- ( thinking )
LET'S HIDE IN THE CORNER,

62
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,083
AND WHEN HE COMES IN,
WE'LL SOCK HIM IN THE TEETH.

63
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,083
- AYE.

64
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,666
-BE AS QUIET AS YOU CAN, OKAY?
- AYE.

65
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,250
-HERE HE COMES.

66
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:39,625
I'VE GOT YOU NOW! 
( gasps )

67
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,750
WHOA.  HE'S GONE?
- GREAT PLAN.

68
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,708
- NO WAY.

69
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,625
- LIKE I'D FALL FOR THAT!

70
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,416
- AW, MAN!
- HE HEARS LIKE A DOG.

71
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,416
- LOOK, I AM COCKY,

72
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,208
BUT I'M NOT A LONELY DUDE,
YOU BLUE FLEABAG.

73
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,000
- HEY, YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED
TO HEAR THAT.

74
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,958
- SO ANY IDEA
WHAT THIS PLACE IS?

75
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,875
- YOU MEAN ASIDE
FROM RUINS ON THE BACK

76
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:06,208
OF A GIANT MONSTER? NO CLUE.

77
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,416
- I THOUGHT NIRVANA
WAS SOME KIND OF POWERFUL MAGIC,

78
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,000
NOT A BUNCH OF BROKEN-DOWN
BUILDINGS AND RUBBLE.

79
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:14,041
- IF IT'S A CITY,
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PEOPLE?

80
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,375
- Hoteye:
AN EXCELLENT QUESTION.

81
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:20,208
OH YEAH! THIS IS THE
MYSTICAL CITY OF NIRVANA.

82
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,166
AND SEEING YOU HERE
PUTS THE ODDS IN OUR FAVOR.

83
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,375
- Gray: THAT'S THE GUY
FROM LYON'S GUILD.

84
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,583
- Lucy: AND ONE OF THE ORACION
SEIS! - WHAT THE HECK?

85
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,166
- THERE'S NO NEED TO WORRY.

86
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,833
HOTEYE IS NOW OUR FAITHFUL ALLY.
- HE IS?

87
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,250
- ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE!
OH YEAH.

88
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,708
- Both: NO WAY!

89
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,750
- ISN'T THIS THE GUY
WHO DID NOTHING

90
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,041
BUT SCREAM "MONEY THIS"
AND "MONEY THAT" BEFORE?

91
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,333
- YEAH, I THINK SO.

92
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,833
BALDY MUST'VE BEATEN
SOME SENSE INTO HIM, HUH?

93
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,500
- WE WERE ABOUT TO DUKE IT OUT
AND HE HAD A CHANGE OF HEART.

94
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:49,333
- AH, WE JUST WENT THROUGH
THE SAME THING WITH SHERRY.

95
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,708
EXCEPT SHE DEFINITELY
CHANGED FOR THE WORSE.

96
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,708
- YEAH, LADY LOVE PRETTY MUCH
WENT PSYCHO ON US

97
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,791
THERE FOR A BIT.

98
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:55,916
- WHAT?  IS SHE OKAY?
WHERE IS SHE?

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,125
- Gray: RELAX,
SHE'S SAFE WITH LYON.

100
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,625
Hoteye: AS I WAS
SAYING, THIS CITY

101
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:01,750
IS WHERE THE ANCIENT NIRVITS

102
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,500
ONCE RESIDED AND PROSPERED.
OH, YEAH.

103
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,541
- Lucy:
NEVER HEARD OF THE NIRVITS.

104
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,958
- I CAN'T SAY I'M SURPRISED
SINCE THERE'S NO RECORD OF THEM.

105
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,666
THEY LIVED 400 YEARS AGO

106
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,000
AT A TIME WHEN THE WORLD
WAS ENGULFED IN WAR.

107
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,416
THE NIRVITS TRIED
TO REMAIN NEUTRAL,

108
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,333
BUT THE BLOODSHED WAS SUCH
THAT THEY BECAME

109
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:20,416
COMPELLED TO INTERVENE.
THEY CREATED A TYPE OF MAGIC

110
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,083
THAT WOULD RESTORE BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

111
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,708
OH, YEAH.
 - DON'T TELL ME,

112
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:27,208
- THAT MAGIC WAS...
- NIRVANA--

113
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:30,750
A POWERFUL SPELL CAPABLE
OF SWITCHING LIGHT AND DARKNESS.

114
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,958
SO CONFIDENT WERE THEY
OF THEIR CREATION,

115
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,666
THEY NAMED IT
AFTER THEIR HOMELAND--

116
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,291
A WORD SYNONYMOUS WITH PEACE.
OH, YEAH.

117
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,125
- Gray: SO THIS CITY OF RUINS--

118
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,500
- Lucy:
--IS ACTUALLY NIRVANA ITSELF?

119
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,541
- Gray: MAN, TALK ABOUT IRONY.

120
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,166
- HUH?

121
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,041
- NIRVANA WAS GIVEN ITS NAME
IN THE HOPE

122
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,583
THAT IT WOULD BRING PEACE.

123
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,625
NOW IT'S FALLEN INTO THE HANDS
OF SOMEONE

124
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,916
WHO WILL USE IT
FOR NOTHING BUT DESTRUCTION.

125
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,041
- JEEZ.
I'M ALL FOR BALANCE,

126
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,333
BUT WHY COULDN'T THEY
JUST MAKE NIRVANA

127
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,416
TURN DARKNESS
INTO LIGHT?

128
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,125
THEN WE WOULDN'T
EVEN BE IN THIS MESS.

129
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,750
- WELL, IT CAN'T BE HELPED NOW.

130
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,166
I DOUBT THE ANCIENTS
EVER CONSIDERED THEIR CREATION

131
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,500
MIGHT ONE DAY
BE USED FOR EVIL.

132
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,541
CRIMINALS CAN FIND
THE DARK SIDE

133
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:12,166
OF EVEN THE MOST CONSTRUCTIVE
OF MAGICS.

134
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,666
- IN ANY CASE,

135
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,750
NOW THAT IT'S BEEN ACTIVATED,

136
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,291
NIRVANA POSES A CLEAR
AND PRESENT THREAT

137
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,833
TO THE ENTIRE WORLD.

138
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,625
WE MUST DO EVERYTHING IN OUR
POWER TO DESTROY IT. OH, YEAH.

139
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:29,166
- SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN TO ME.

140
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
NOW WHAT?
- Lucy: THEY'RE LIGHTING UP.

141
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,208
- IT MUST BE BRAIN'S WORK.
OH, YEAH.

142
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,166
KNOWING HIM, HE'S MOST LIKELY
CONTROLLING NIRVANA

143
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,583
FROM THE ROYAL THRONE
LOCATED IN THE CITY'S HEART.

144
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,458
LUCKILY FOR US,

145
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,375
HE'S UNABLE TO USE
ANY OTHER MAGIC WHILE DOING SO.

146
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:51,083
IT'S THE PERFECT TIME
TO STRIKE.  OH, YEAH.

147
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,833
- Gray:
IF HE'S DRIVING THIS THING,

148
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,583
IS HE TAKING IT
ANYWHERE SPECIFIC?

149
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,916
- I WOULD WAGER THAT HE IS.

150
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,333
SADLY, BRAIN DID NOT SHARE
THE PARTICULARS OF HIS PLAN

151
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,250
WITH THE REST OF US.

152
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,875
- Midnight: NOT TRUE.

153
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:07,333
FATHER DIDN'T TRUST THE REST
OF YOU ENOUGH TO TELL YOU.

154
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,750
- HELLO, MIDNIGHT.

155
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,541
- ONE OF THE ORACION SEIS.

156
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,458
- THAT'S THE CREEP
WHO'S ALWAYS NAPPING.

157
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,416
- YOU BETRAYED US.

158
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,750
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU HAD THE GUTS.

159
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,791
- I HAVEN'T BETRAYED ANYONE.
- OH?

160
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,458
- I'VE COME TO REALIZE THE ERROR
OF BRAIN'S MISGUIDED WAYS.

161
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,250
- WHAT WAS THAT?

162
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,833
WHY DON'T YOU COME OVER HERE
AND SAY THAT, BIG GUY?

163
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,000
- Lucy: HOW HE'S DOING THAT? 
- Gray: HANG ON.

164
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,458
WHAT'S ALL THIS FATHER STUFF
ABOUT, ANYWAY?

165
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,458
- SOME KIND OF FAMILY
THAT SLAYS TOGETHER?

166
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,041
- I SAY HE IS MISGUIDED

167
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,833
BECAUSE HE TRULY BELIEVES
A PERSON'S HEART

168
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,500
CAN BE CHANGED WITH MAGIC.
BUT ONLY LOVE HAS THE POWER

169
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:45,250
TO MAKE EVEN THE WEAKEST OF
HEARTS BECOME STRONG. OH YEAH.

170
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,333
- HMM.

171
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,041
- ( all coughing )

172
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,458
- WHOA.  ANYONE KNOW
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

173
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,375
- HOTEYE LIQUEFIED
THE GROUND BENEATH US

174
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,708
SO WE WOULDN'T BE HIT.

175
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,000
IT HAPPENED SO FAST,
I BARELY SAW IT.

176
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,583
- THERE'S NO TIME TO WASTE.

177
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,583
GET TO THE ROYAL THRONE
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

178
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,750
I'LL STAY BEHIND
AND TAKE CARE OF MIDNIGHT.

179
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,750
BUT YOU NEEDN'T
WORRY ABOUT ME.

180
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,958
ALL MEMBERS OF THE ORACION SEIS
ARE EQUAL IN POWER.

181
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:19,083
- YOU REALLY THINK
YOU'RE A MATCH FOR ME?

182
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,250
- EARTH MAGIC-- LIQUID GROUND!

183
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:29,000
- WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT THE ORACION
SEIS WOULD TURN ON EACH OTHER?

184
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,916
- DARK GUILDS AREN'T EXACTLY
ALL ABOUT PEACE AND HARMONY.

185
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,166
- BE CAREFUL, HOTEYE.
- I WILL.  NOW GO, QUICKLY.

186
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:40,083
ALSO I WOULD PREFER
YOU DIDN'T CALL ME THAT ANYMORE.

187
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,500
THE NAME'S RICHARD.
OH, YEAH.

188
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,833
- THANK YOU, RICHARD.

189
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,666
- HA!

190
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,416
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO REVEAL
OUR TRUE NAME TO THE ENEMY.

191
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,500
THAT'S A NEW LOW,
EVEN FOR YOU.  OH YEAH.

192
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,541
- I HAVE NO INTEREST IN HIDING
BEHIND A CODE NAME

193
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,541
NOW THAT I'VE OPENED MY HEART
TO LOVE.

194
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,291
PREPARE YOURSELF.

195
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,375
- HERE GOES!

196
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,125
- QUIT DODGING ME, WILL YA?

197
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,958
- YOU THINK I'M JUST
GONNA LET YOU HIT ME?

198
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,916
ARE YOU THAT SLOW?
- SHUT UP!

199
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,750
YOU'RE JUST A CHEATING PUNK
WHO'S SCARED TO TAKE A HIT.

200
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,375
- Lucy: IT'S LIKE WHATEVER MAGIC
HE'S USING LETS HIM

201
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:14,625
PREDICT OUR ATTACKS.

202
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,958
- NO, I LISTEN.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GIVE IT A TRY.

203
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,750
- ( hisses )

204
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,250
- I KNOW WHAT YOUR NEXT MOVE'S
GONNA BE

205
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,458
'CAUSE I CAN HEAR
YOUR THOUGHTS.

206
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,791
- HE'S SOME KIND OF PSYCHIC?

207
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,708
- IF THAT'S TRUE,
WHAT AM I THINKIN' RIGHT NOW?!

208
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,416
( stomach growls )

209
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,083
- I DON'T GOTTA USE MAGIC

210
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,333
TO KNOW YOU GOT FISH
ON THE BRAIN, FURBALL.

211
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,166
- HE CAN HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS,
NATSU!

212
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,708
I WAS THINKING ABOUT FISH
JUST NOW AND HE GUESSED IT.

213
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,291
- OH!  ME NEXT!

214
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,041
- I'M TELLIN' YOU, HE'S GOOD.

215
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,458
- IT'S NOT SOME
SILLY PARLOR TRICK, YA KNOW.

216
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,750
- ( laughing )
I NEVER HEARD THAT ONE!

217
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,000
I GOTTA ADMIT,
THAT WAS PRETTY FUNNY.

218
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,000
- I KNOW, RIGHT? IT SLAYS.
GUESS HE IS PSYCHIC AFTER ALL.

219
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,541
- WHAT WERE YOU
THINKING ABOUT THAT MADE HIM

220
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,083
CRACK UP LIKE THAT?
I WANT IN ON THE JOKE.

221
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,625
- I'LL TELL YOU WHEN
YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH.

222
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,541
RIGHT NOW, WE GOTTA DEAL WITH
THIS GUY. - DON'T WORRY.

223
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,916
I KNOW A WAY TO BEAT HIM AND HIS
MIND-READING MAGIC

224
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,625
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

225
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,625
- YOU PLAN TO ATTACK
FROM THE LEFT

226
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,916
WHILE THINKING
ABOUT ATTACKING FROM THE RIGHT.

227
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,375
- Both: AHH!
- IT WON'T WORK.

228
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,458
YOU AREN'T THE FIRST ONES
TO COME UP WITH THAT PLAN

229
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,000
AND YOU WON'T BE THE LAST.

230
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,083
TRY TO BE
MORE ORIGINAL NEXT TIME.

231
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,250
- ( growling )

232
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,750
- THAT'S
AN INTERESTING APPROACH.

233
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,416
FLOODING YOUR MIND
WITH THOUGHTS.

234
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,291
MUST BE PAINFUL
HAVING THREE OR FOUR AT ONCE.

235
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,083
SOME OF 'EM AIN'T HALF BAD.

236
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,541
BUT IT'S GONNA
TAKE MORE THAN THAT, PAL.

237
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,958
YOU'RE TOO DUMB.
- YOU'RE NOT PLAYIN' FAIR!

238
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,083
MY BRAIN'S TIRED, SO I THINK
IT'S TIME TO ATTACK HIM HEAD ON.

239
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,166
- AYE, SIR.
LET'S GO WITH PLAN T--

240
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,583
- Both: TAKE 'EM BY STORM!

241
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,916
- "START WITH A RIGHT HOOK,

242
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
FOLLOWED BY A LEFT KICK,
THEN A RIGHT LEG SWEEP,

243
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:05,083
THEN FINISH HIM OFF WITH
A STRAIGHT PUNCH TO THE FACE."

244
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:11,791
- AHHH!

245
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,958
- WHAT THE--
IMPOSSIBLE.

246
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,416
- AHHH!

247
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,791
- I CAN'T HEAR HIM ANYMORE.

248
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,708
IT'S LIKE HE'S COMPLETELY
SWITCHED OFF HIS MIND.

249
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,083
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE
AN IDIOT OR A GENIUS.

250
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:31,000
NO ONE'S LANDED
THAT MANY HITS ON ME.

251
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,291
GUESS MY PARLOR TRICK
AIN'T GONNA BE ENOUGH

252
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,833
TO CUT IT IN THIS FIGHT.

253
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:38,958
- AHH! OW! WHAT'D YOU DO?

254
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,750
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
ARE YOU HURT?

255
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,416
- YOU'RE FIGHTING
THE POISON DRAGON NOW.

256
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,041
IT'S OVER FOR YOU.
- Happy: AM I SEEING THINGS?

257
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,958
- Natsu: NO, I SEE IT TOO.

258
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,708
- Both:
THIS GUY'S A DRAGON SLAYER!

259
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,583
- ( Natsu screaming )

260
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:10,666
- AHHH!

261
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,791
( chuckling )

262
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,333
- OH, NO, ARE YOU OKAY?
- I'M GOOD.

263
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,208
BUT HIS ATTACKS ARE SO WEIRD.

264
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,458
EVERY TIME HE HITS ME,
MY BODY GETS MORE AND MORE NUMB.

265
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,708
- YOUR PAIN
IS LIKE MUSIC TO MY EARS.

266
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,250
ONE HIT
FROM A POISON DRAGON SLAYER

267
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,500
AND YOU'LL START
TO DECOMPOSE INTO MUSH.

268
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,416
- YEAH, RIGHT, YOU WISH.

269
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,208
YOUR MAGIC DOESN'T SCARE ME.
FIRE TRUMPS POISON ANY DAY.

270
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,375
LET'S DO THIS!
- AYE, SIR.

271
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,916
- FIRE DRAGON IRON FIST!

272
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
- FESTER AND FALL!

273
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:50,250
POISON DRAGON FANG THRUST!

274
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,708
- AHHH!

275
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,916
- AH!
I DIDN'T MEAN TO DROP HIM!

276
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,958
- YOU'RE ALREADY SICK?
YOU JUST LANDED.

277
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,958
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT DROPPING YOU BACK THERE.

278
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,958
YA FEELING BETTER YET?
- YEAH, THINK SO.

279
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,208
I'LL BE FINE.

280
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,625
- LET ME TELL YOU,
YOU'RE ONE CARELESS LOSER.

281
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,583
AIN'T HE, CUBELLIOS?

282
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:23,208
- WHO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
CALLIN' A LOSER, YA FREAK?

283
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:26,250
- YOU TELL HIM!
- YOU'RE GOIN' DOWN!

284
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,291
- WHOA.
HIT A NERVE, HUH?

285
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,291
IT MUST BE SO HARD FOR YOU--

286
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,708
HEAD FULL OF NOTHING,
AND A LAME DISPOSITION TO BOOT.

287
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,750
- GAH, THIS SUCKS!
- Happy: HEY, WHAT HAPPENED?

288
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,958
YOU WERE SLUGGIN' HIM
LEFT AND RIGHT A MINUTE AGO.

289
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,583
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
NOT THINKING AGAIN?

290
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,166
THAT SEEMED TO DO THE TRICK.

291
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,500
- I'LL TRY, BUT FINDING OUT HE'S
A DRAGON SLAYER THREW ME OFF.

292
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,416
MY BRAIN'S GOING
A MILE A MINUTE.

293
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,791
- THAT'S NO GOOD.
YOU GOTTA PUT THE BRAKES ON IT.

294
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,500
IF YOU DON'T TURN OFF
YOUR BRAIN,

295
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,208
HE'S JUST GONNA
KEEP PLAYIN' MIND GAMES.

296
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,291
IT SHOULDN'T BE
THAT HARD FOR YOU

297
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,375
SINCE YOU HARDLY EVER USE IT.
- WHAT'RE YOU TRYIN' TO SAY?!

298
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,375
THAT YOU THINK I'M A DUMMY?
I'M A GOOD-FOR-NOTHIN' IDIOT?

299
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,083
- DON'T PUT WORDS IN MY MOUTH.

300
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,833
YOU NORMALLY
GO WITH YOUR GUT

301
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,416
INSTEAD OF
THINKING THINGS OVER.

302
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,083
QUIT WASTING TIME
AND START FIGHTING.

303
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,625
- OH, SO NOW
I'M AN IMPULSIVE MEATHEAD?

304
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,666
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY FRIEND,
MAN.

305
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,250
 WHY'RE YOU INSULTING ME? 
- I'M NOT TRYIN' TO.

306
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,833
USE YOUR HEAD FOR ONCE!

307
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,666
- WOULD YOU MAKE UP
YOUR MIND ALREADY?

308
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,500
DO YOU WANT ME
TO USE IT OR NOT?

309
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,916
- NOW YOU'RE FIRED UP,
FOCUS YOUR ANGER ON HIM.

310
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,333
LET'S DO THIS!
- AYE, SIR.

311
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,041
FIRE DRAGON TALON!

312
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:24,083
POISON DRAGON SPIRAL JAW!

313
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,541
- ( Natsu shouting )

314
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,875
- HEY! YOU CAN'T GET
MOTION SICK RIGHT NOW.

315
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,166
AHH!
DO SOMETHING, NATSU!

316
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,000
- Gray: WHOA, WHAT WAS THAT?

317
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,333
- Jura: MAYBE ONE
OF OUR ALLIES NEEDS HELP.

318
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,916
- Lucy:
AN OVER-THE-TOP EXPLOSION?

319
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,250
- BET YA I KNOW WHO CAUSED IT.

320
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,125
- NATSU MAKES IT EASY
FOR US TO FIND HIM.

321
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,375
- NO KIDDIN'.

322
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,583
- THERE'S NO WAY
HE SURVIVED THAT BLAST.

323
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,416
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT'S THAT SOUND?

324
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,625
- ( gurgling )

325
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,541
- THAT PYRO'S
EATING ALL THE FIRE.

326
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:14,666
WE'RE ABOUT TO HAVE A REAL FIGHT
ON OUR HANDS, CUBELLIOS.

327
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,333
- OH YEAH,
NOW I'VE GOT A FIRE IN MY BELLY.

328
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,916
- GOTTA SAY, I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING QUITE LIKE THAT BEFORE,

329
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,916
BUT NOW THAT YOU'VE HAD YOUR
FINAL MEAL, LET'S FINISH THIS.

330
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,541
- FINE BY ME!
- Happy: YA MISSED!

331
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,083
- WHAT'S WRONG, SNAKE EYES?
WE TOO FAST FOR YA?

332
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:34,458
- HOW ABOUT YOU QUIT RUNNING
AND SAY THAT TO MY FACE?

333
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,291
POISON DRAGON SCALES!

334
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,208
- Happy: HANG ON!
MAX SPEED!

335
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,291
- YOU'RE NEVER GONNA LEARN,
ARE YA?

336
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,791
NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY,
YOU CAN'T HIT ME.

337
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,250
I KNOW YOUR EVERY MOVE
BEFORE YOU MAKE IT.

338
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,458
- THERE'S NO WAY I CAN MISS
AT CLOSE RANGE.

339
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,708
FIRE DRA--

340
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,083
AHHH!

341
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,833
- I GOT YA!

342
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,333
- HE POISONED MY FACE OFF.
- THAT WAS WAY TOO RECKLESS.

343
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,583
- YEAH, WELL, I DIDN'T SEE YOU
COMING UP WITH ANY IDEAS.

344
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:11,916
- IT WAS STILL TOO RECKLESS!

345
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,500
- OKAY, I GET IT!
DON'T RUB IT IN.

346
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,458
- ALL THIS FIGHTING
HAS WORKED UP MY APPETITE.

347
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,208
- ( hissing )

348
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,125
- THAT'S A POISON CLOUD.
- CAN'T BE GOOD.

349
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,833
- WHOA.
HE IS SCARFIN' IT DOWN.

350
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,875
- MAYBE HE'LL DO US A FAVOR
AND CHOKE ON IT.

351
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:34,250
- NOW I'VE GOT A FIRE
IN MY BELLY TOO.

352
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,541
TASTY.
- THAT'S MY LINE, COPYCAT.

353
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,708
- I'VE GOT A GIFT
FOR THE TWO OF YOU.

354
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,833
POISON DRAGON!

355
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,375
- A GIFT, HUH?
- NO THANK YOU!

356
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:45,166
- ROAR!

357
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,208
- YOU CALL THAT A ROAR?
WHATEVER.

358
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,250
FELT MORE LIKE A PUNY
LITTLE SQUEAK TO ME.

359
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,791
( sighs )

360
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,625
YOU GOTTA HANG IN THERE,
LITTLE BUDDY.

361
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,333
- SO WEAK.

362
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,208
- WE'RE STARTING
TO LOSE ALTITUDE!

363
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,833
HAPPY!
- I KNOW.

364
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,750
I'M TRYING TO KEEP US
IN THE AIR,

365
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,250
BUT I CAN BARELY
FLAP MY WINGS.

366
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,666
- TRY HARDER OR WE'RE GONERS!

367
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,958
- WELL, IF I DIDN'T
HAVE TO CARRY YOU...

368
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:17,791
- HOW DO YOU LIKE
MY POISON DRAGON BREATH?

369
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,916
RIGHT NOW, IT'S FLOODING
YOUR BODIES WITH VIRUSES.

370
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,208
EACH PASSING SECOND BRINGS YOU
CLOSER TO YOUR DEATH.

371
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,708
- I'M FADIN' FAST.

372
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,250
- YOUR FATE WAS SEALED
WHEN MY BREATH ATTACK HIT YOU.

373
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,625
CONTINUING TO FIGHT
NOW WOULD BE POINTLESS.

374
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,000
- WOULD YOU
QUIT BLABBIN' ALREADY?!

375
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,583
LET'S SHUT THIS GUY UP
FOR GOOD.

376
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,375
WHAT DO YA SAY?
- AYE, SIR!

377
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,083
- THESE BRATS MUST HAVE ONE HECK
OF A DEATH WISH.

378
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:46,333
FIRE DRAGON WING ATTACK!

379
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,375
- DIDN'T I TELL YOU
I CAN HEAR YOUR MOVEMENTS?

380
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,125
- SO WHAT?

381
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,458
- YOU'VE GOTTA DO LIKE I SAID
AND TURN OFF YOUR BRAIN.

382
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,250
- HOW ABOUT YOU
CONCENTRATE ON FLYIN'

383
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,166
INSTEAD OF BOSSIN' ME AROUND?!

384
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,375
- FLYIN' IS THE ONLY THING

385
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,166
THAT'S BEEN ON MY MIND
THIS ENTIRE TIME.

386
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,625
- COULD THESE GUYS
POSSIBLY BE ANY MORE ANNOYING?

387
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:11,375
LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH,
CUBELLIOS.

388
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,875
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I HAVE TO SAY THIS,

389
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,791
BUT IF YOU'RE DONE
WITH YOUR LOVERS' SPAT,

390
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,333
CAN WE GET BACK TO FIGHTING?

391
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,416
THAT IS, IF AN OLDER-GENERATION
DRAGON SLAYER LIKE YOURSELF

392
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,500
CAN HANDLE IT.

393
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,833
- I'M OLDER GENERATION?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

394
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,833
I'M PART
OF A NEW WAVE OF SLAYER.

395
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,166
A DRAGON LACRIMA
WAS IMPLANTED IN MY BODY,

396
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,125
MAKING ME INFINITELY
MORE POWERFUL

397
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,291
THAN THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE ME.

398
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,208
- THIS IS WHAT GRAMPS
WAS TELLIN' US ABOUT.

399
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,166
- YEAH, HE'S NO DIFFERENT
THAN LAXUS.

400
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,125
HE'S NOT A REAL DRAGON SLAYER.
HE JUST STOLE HIS POWER.

401
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:42,166
- A "REAL" DRAGON SLAYER?
THERE'S NO SUCH THING.

402
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,583
THE ONLY BEINGS CAPABLE
OF MASTERING DRAGON-SLAYER MAGIC

403
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,166
ARE THE DRAGONS THEMSELVES.

404
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,375
HUMANS WILL NEVER BE ABLE
TO OBTAIN THAT POWER

405
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,708
IN THIS DAY AND AGE.
'CAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS,

406
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,208
DRAGONS HAVE BEEN EXTINCT
FOR A LONG TIME.

407
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:57,000
- THAT'S A FILTHY LIE.
IGNEEL'S NOT EXTINCT!

408
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,500
THERE'S NO WAY.

409
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,208
I SAW HIM
WITH MY OWN TWO EYES!

410
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,416
- GET REAL, PYRO.

411
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,083
HOW COME NO ONE BUT YOU
HAS EVER SEEN 'EM, HUH?

412
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,083
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

413
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,208
- POISON DRAGON TWIN FANG!

414
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:14,375
- Happy: WE CAN'T TAKE
ANOTHER HIT LIKE THAT.

415
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:18,333
- NO, I CAN BARELY MOVE.
WHY NOW?

416
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,250
- I CAN HEAR IT.

417
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:23,083
THE POISON HAS CIRCULATED
THROUGHOUT YOUR BODY.

418
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,625
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GONNA
ROT AWAY REAL SOON,

419
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,791
JUST LIKE YOUR DRAGON.

420
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:31,750
- I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T
KEEP THIS UP MUCH LONGER.

421
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,750
- I'VE GOT A PLAN.

422
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,541
I WANT YOU TO DROP ME
RIGHT ON TOP OF HIM.

423
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,208
- Happy: WHAT?
HAVE YOU COMPLETELY LOST IT?

424
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,416
YOU JUST SAID
YOU CAN BARELY MOVE ANYMORE.

425
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,708
- Natsu: THAT'S WHY
I HAVE TO FINISH THIS NOW.

426
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:44,916
WE'VE GOTTA HURRY.

427
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,083
- WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING
TO DO?

428
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,583
- Cobra: LET ME GUESS, A
FULL-POWERED FIRE DRAGON ROAR.

429
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,750
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL
YOU I CAN HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS?

430
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,708
- OKAY. LET ME GO.
- AYE.

431
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,916
- THIS ISN'T GONNA BE
MUCH OF A CHALLENGE

432
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,625
 NOW THAT HE'S THINKING AGAIN.

433
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,791
COME AND GET ME!
- FIRE DRAGON!

434
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,500
- IT'S NO USE.  YOU'RE GOIN'
FOR A WIDE-SPREAD ATTACK

435
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,583
'CAUSE YOU THINK
I WON'T BE ABLE TO DODGE IT.

436
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,208
GUESS AGAIN!

437
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,416
YOU CAN'T HIT ME IF I'M
RIGHT BEHIND YOU. - AH!

438
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,916
- I'LL END THIS
BY CRUSHING YOUR THICK SKULL.

439
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,291
- NATSU!

440
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,166
- TELL YOUR DRAGON
I SAID HI

441
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,041
WHEN YOU GET
TO THE OTHER SIDE.

442
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,958
- NO!

443
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:31,625
AHHHH!

444
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,541
- NO!  NOOO!

445
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,333
- AHHHHH!

446
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,833
- IS THAT SOMEBODY SCREAMING?
IT ALMOST SOUNDS INHUMAN.

447
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,708
- PLEASE DON'T BE
A GIANT MONSTER.

448
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,708
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT COULD BE.

449
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,583
- AHH!

450
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:07,958
- MY EARS!  AHHH!

451
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,458
- Happy: WOW, YOU'VE GOT A
SERIOUS SET OF PIPES ON YA.

452
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:21,958
- UM, OH YEAH, I TOTALLY PLANNED
ON BUSTIN' OUT HIS EARDRUMS.

453
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:25,708
I SURE FOOLED HIM.
I RULE, RIGHT?

454
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:27,916
- IT WAS DUMB LUCK
AND YOU KNOW IT.

455
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
- INTERESTING.
HE DEFEATED COBRA

456
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,833
BY USING HIS GREATEST STRENGTH
AGAINST HIM.

457
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:36,833
IT APPEARS I'VE UNDERESTIMATED
OUR FOES GREATLY.

458
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,500
- ( theme music playing )

459
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:49,958
 - ( singing in Japanese )

460
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:15,041
- Natsu: HEY, THAT OLD BALD GUY
FROM LAMIA SCALE

461
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,375
SAID HE'S ONE
OF THE 10 WIZARD SAINTS, RIGHT?

462
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:20,000
- Happy: HE SURE IS. IN FACT, I
BET HE'S EVEN STRONGER THAN YOU.

463
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,958
- NO WAY.
NO ONE WITH THAT KIND OF FACE

464
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,583
COULD EVER BE THAT POWERFUL.

465
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,416
- WHAT DOES HIS FACE
HAVE TO DO WITH IT?

466
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,666
- GUESS I'LL JUST
HAVE TO FIGHT HIM AND FIND OUT.

467
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,416
- GO AHEAD.  FIVE FISH SAYS
HE KNOCKS YOU OUT FLAT.

468
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,541
- ( Natsu and Happy speaking )

469
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:35,208
- Natsu: SHEESH, WHAT KIND OF
FRIEND ARE YOU,

470
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:36,291
BETTING AGAINST ME?

471
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,083
TALK ABOUT COLDHEARTED.
 - SORRY, PAL.

472
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:40,041
I JUST KNOW TO ALWAYS
GO WITH A SURE THING,

473
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:41,708
LIKE HIM BEATING YOU.
