1
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,666
- Natsu:
PREVIOUSLY ON "FAIRY TAIL."

2
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,916
- Lucy: OUR COALITION FORCE
COURAGEOUSLY STOOD UP

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,625
TO THE ORACION SEIS.

4
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,291
THAT IS UNTIL THEY DESTROYED
OUR TRUMP CARD,

5
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:28,958
THE MAGIC BOMBER,
CHRISTINA.

6
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:30,208
- Hoteye: OH, YEAH!
- Gray: WE HAD NO CHOICE

7
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,875
BUT TO GO HEAD-TO-HEAD
WITH THEM.

8
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,625
UNFORTUNATELY,
THAT DIDN'T GO SO WELL

9
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,208
AND THEY TOTALLY WHOOPED US.

10
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:36,958
- Hoteye: OH, YEAH!

11
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:40,125
- ( theme music playing )

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

13
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,250
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

14
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:12,958
- MAN, THEY'RE WAY STRONGER
THAN WE THOUGHT.

15
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:14,583
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, BRAIN?

16
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,416
YOU GONNA CAST
THE SPELL OR WHAT?

17
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,416
- DO YOU KNOW HER?

18
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,916
- NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,083
THAT'S WENDY.

20
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,708
THE MAIDEN OF THE SKY.

21
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,083
- WHAT?
MAIDEN OF THE SKY?

22
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,375
- WENDY?

23
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,416
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

24
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,833
- I WAS GONNA ASK YOU.

25
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:36,000
- ( crying )

26
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,041
- ( Happy speaking )

27
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,958
- TO THINK WE SIMPLY
STUMBLED UPON HER HERE.

28
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,375
WE MADE QUITE A FIND,
MY FRIENDS.

29
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,791
GRAB HER!

30
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:49,750
- ( gasps )

31
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,125
- ( screams )

32
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,875
- Both: WENDY!
- ( screams )

33
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,541
- UNHAND HER NOW!

34
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,208
- HELP ME!

35
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,958
 - I'LL SAVE YOU AS SOON
AS I'M ABLE TO CATCH UP!

36
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,916
- STRIKING WHILE WE'RE DOWN?
THAT ISN'T FAIR.

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,541
- ALL IS FAIR
IN MONEY AND WAR.

38
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:08,958
OH, YEAH.

39
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,083
- ( gasps )

40
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,083
AAH!

41
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,708
- CARLA!

42
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,750
- GRAB MY PAW!

43
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,291
- WHOA!  OHH!

44
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,708
- YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG CAT.

45
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,166
- ( screams )
- NATSU!

46
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,333
- WENDY!
- HAPPY!

47
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,583
- I HAVE NO USE
FOR THE REST OF YOU.

48
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:26,791
BE GONE!

49
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,875
DARK RONDO!

50
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,583
- GET DOWN.
- LUCY!

51
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,416
- ( grunts )

52
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,500
- I'VE GOT YOU.

53
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,333
- YES, HOLD ME IN
YOUR LOVING ARMS.

54
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,250
- IRON ROCK WALL!

55
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,833
JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME.

56
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,083
- THAT WAS AWESOME!
- ( chuckles )

57
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,666
- YOU'RE THE BEST WIZARD EVER.

58
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,750
- I'LL SECOND THAT.
WE OWE YOU ONE.

59
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,416
- YEAH, WE WERE
ALMOST GONERS. 

60
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,416
THANKS A MILLION.

61
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,833
- OKAY.

62
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,083
LET'S TAKE THEM DOWN.

63
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,666
HUH?

64
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,000
- Gray:
THEY'RE LONG GONE BY NOW.

65
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,333
- Natsu:
WHY'D WE LET THEM GET AWAY?

66
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,833
- OH, WENDY.

67
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,625
- THEY WIPED THE FLOOR
WITH US.

68
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,041
- WELL, THEY'RE A LOT
STRONGER THAN WE ARE.

69
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,041
WE NEVER STOOD A CHANCE
AGAINST THEM.

70
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,208
- Lyon: THE ORACION SEIS.

71
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,041
WHAT UNBELIEVABLE POWER.

72
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,041
- Hibiki: AND THERE ARE
ONLY SIX OF THEM.

73
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,666
THEIR MAGIC IS MUCH STRONGER
THAN THE RUMORS SUGGESTED.

74
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,458
- Sherry: JUST LOOK AT WHAT
THEY DID TO CHRISTINA.

75
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:30,083
- Jura: ACCORDING TO ANGEL,
THE WOMAN WHO PEERS INTO MINDS,

76
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,958
THEY KNOW EVERYTHING
ABOUT OUR MISSION.

77
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,625
WE'RE LUCKY
NO LIVES WERE LOST.

78
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:34,875
- WAIT A SEC.

79
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,458
WHAT ABOUT ALL
THE PEOPLE INSIDE?

80
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,625
- DON'T WORRY, PRETTY LADY.

81
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,458
- CHRISTINA'S EQUIPPED WITH
A REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTION, 

82
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,208
SO THERE'S NO NEED
FOR A PILOT.

83
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,791
- WE WERE GONNA CLIMB ABOARD
ONCE WE FOUND THEIR BASE,

84
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,000
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE,
WE NEVER MADE IT THAT FAR.

85
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,500
- OH, GOOD.
THAT'S A RELIEF.

86
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,750
- GLAD TO SEE YOU
MADE IT OUT UNSCATHED.

87
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,500
- NOT QUITE. IN FACT,
I BARELY MADE IT OUT ALIVE.

88
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,416
- HM?  YOU'RE WOUNDED?

89
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
- THEIR POWER TERRIFIES ME.

90
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,166
I HATE TO ADMIT IT, BUT IF IT
WEREN'T FOR SIR ICHIYA'S

91
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,666
PAIN KILLER PARFUM,

92
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,333
I WOULD BE IN
UTTER AGONY RIGHT NOW.

93
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,250
- DETESTABLE ORACION SEIS.

94
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,083
INSTEAD OF BRAVELY
FACING YOUR FOES, 

95
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,500
YOU DECIDED TO FLEE.

96
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,083
WHICH MEANS WE WIN
BY DEFAULT!

97
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:13,916
- THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS,
YOU WEIRDO!

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,250
- LOOK, PAL,
WE MAY BE BATTERED,

99
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,708
BUT WE ARE NOT BEATEN.

100
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:17,833
HERE, TAKE A WHIFF,

101
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,250
AND LET MY PAIN KILLER PARFUM

102
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,708
EASE YOUR DISCOMFORT.

103
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,250
- WOW.  WHAT A LOVELY SCENT.

104
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,250
- AND IT WORKS.
MY PAIN IS JUST FADING AWAY.

105
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,083
- MAN.

106
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,458
- IF ONLY HE COULD
CAST THE SPELL

107
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,958
WITHOUT ALL THE BIZARRE POSING.

108
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,958
- WAY TO GO, CHIEF.
- All: GO CHIEF!

109
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,708
- THEY CALLED HIM
SOMETHING DIFFERENT AGAIN.

110
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,666
- I BET THEY'RE DOING IT
JUST TO ANNOY US.

111
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,458
- WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

112
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:42,125
HOW DARE THOSE PUNKS
RUN OFF WITH WENDY AND HAPPY.

113
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,250
THIS SUCKS!

114
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,125
I GOT TO GO FIND THEM!

115
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,083
- HEY!  WHERE DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE GOING? 

116
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,083
- ( gasps )

117
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,125
( groans )

118
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,625
- YOU MUSTN'T BE RECKLESS.

119
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,541
YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN
AND THINK THIS THROUGH.

120
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,291
- THOSE WINGS.
- WAS SHE HIDING THEM?

121
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,541
- YOU CAN FLY?

122
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,041
- THAT'S SO COOL!

123
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,166
- YOU'VE NEVER SEEN
AERA MAGIC BEFORE?

124
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,375
WELL IN THAT CASE,
I SUPPOSE IT'S ONLY NATURAL

125
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,125
THAT YOU WOULD
FIND IT SURPRISING.

126
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,708
- YOU'RE TRYING TO
COPY HAPPY, AREN'T YOU?

127
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,125
- AS IF, DIMWIT!

128
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,250
- NOW NOW,
WE CAN HAVE TWO FLYING CATS.

129
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,333
- THOUGH I AM CONCERNED
ABOUT WENDY AND THAT TOMCAT,

130
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,666
THIS IS NOT A FOE
TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY.

131
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,375
WE CANNOT FACE THEM AGAIN UNTIL
WE'VE COME UP

132
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,500
WITH A PLAN OF ATTACK.

133
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,583
- I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE,
LADY CARLA.

134
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,833
THE ENEMY IS FAR STRONGER
THAN WE ANTICIPATED.

135
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,250
- MAN.

136
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,666
- BUT FIRST...

137
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,458
- ( wincing )

138
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,875
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

139
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,291
- ( gasps )

140
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,750
- I'M NO DOCTOR, 
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE

141
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,791
THE VENOM FROM HER
SNAKEBITE IS SPREADING.

142
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,333
- MASTER ICHIYA-- 
- I GOT THIS, MEN.

143
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,583
I KNOW WHAT YOU NEED,
MY HONEY.

144
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,875
A LITTLE PAIN KILLER PARFUM!

145
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,875
AROMA INCREASE!

146
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,750
- ( groans )

147
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,500
- SINCE WHEN ARE PAIN KILLERS
AN ANTIDOTE FOR SNAKE VENOM? 

148
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,458
- HIS PARFUM DOES MORE
THAN EASE PAIN.

149
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:55,958
IT ALSO HAS A CLEANSING EFFECT

150
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,708
THAT'LL HELP HER BODY
EXPEL ANY TOXINS.

151
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,666
- OH, YEAH.
- ( groans )

152
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,041
- ERZA, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

153
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,125
- IT SEEMS LIKE SHE'S 
IN EVEN MORE PAIN NOW.

154
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,791
- HUH?  YOU THINK SO?

155
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,666
- ( screams )

156
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,541
- OH, MAN.

157
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,375
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- I DON'T KNOW.

158
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,208
HIS PAIN KILLER PARFUM
HAS NEVER FAILED BEFORE.

159
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,375
- ERZA, HANG IN THERE.

160
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,791
- WHAT'LL WE DO?

161
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,958
- I'M SORRY, LUCY.

162
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,375
- HMM?
- I NEED TO BORROW YOUR BELT!

163
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,000
- ( yelps )
WAIT A MINUTE!

164
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,541
( screams )
- ( laughing )

165
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,625
- LOOK AWAY!

166
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:30,916
- ( grunts )

167
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,458
- JUST WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO WITH THAT?

168
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,041
- IT'S HARSH,

169
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,041
BUT IT'S THE ONLY WAY
I CAN KEEP FIGHTING. 

170
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:40,958
SOMEBODY CUT IT OFF.

171
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,375
- ( all gasping )

172
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,291
- AT LEAST GIVE US TIME
TO FIND AN ANTIDOTE.

173
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:47,250
- I DON'T HAVE TIME.

174
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,166
- VERY WELL.

175
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,250
I WILL DO IT.

176
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,916
- HOW KIND OF YOU.

177
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,083
- PUT DOWN THE SWORD.

178
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,875
- DO IT!
- NO, DON'T!

179
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,083
- UM, LYON,

180
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,250
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY
GONNA DO IT?

181
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,083
- WE CAN'T LOSE
ONE OF OUR STRONGEST

182
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,666
WHEN WE'RE FACING
SUCH A POWERFUL FOE.

183
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,666
- YEAH, BUT-- 
- OH, COME ON.

184
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,333
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE GOT STUCK
WITH YOU WIMPY FAIRIES.

185
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,583
QUIT WHINING.
YOU'RE FRIEND'S GONNA DIE

186
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,166
IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING
TO HELP HER.

187
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,416
- YOUR FRIEND'S GONNA DIE
IF HE DOESN'T

188
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,541
PUT DOWN THAT SWORD.

189
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,291
- WHY IS THAT?

190
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:20,291
THIS IS JUST HIS WAY
OF SHOWING LOVE.

191
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,208
- JUST HURRY UP
AND CUT IT OFF!

192
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:25,458
BEFORE THE VENOM SPREADS
TO THE REST OF MY BODY! 

193
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,041
- PUT THE SWORD DOWN!

194
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,875
- DON'T DO IT.
YOU WANT TO BE KNOWN AS THE GUY

195
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,291
WHO MAIMED ERZA?
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

196
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,541
STOP.  WE'LL FIND A CURE.

197
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,041
- WE HAVE NO RIGHT
TO INTERFERE

198
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,083
WITH HER WISHES.

199
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,041
- READY?

200
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,291
- ( gasps )

201
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,583
- ( all gasp )

202
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,875
- HER ARM IS MORE IMPORTANT
TO YOU THAN HER LIFE?

203
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,666
WHERE ARE YOUR PRIORITIES?

204
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,291
- THIS'LL AFFECT HER
FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE,

205
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,958
SO WE CAN'T JUMP THE GUN.

206
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,250
THERE'S GOT TO BE
ANOTHER WAY WE CAN SAVE HER.

207
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,000
- YOU'RE JUST
AS SPINELESS AS EVER.

208
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,333
FIGURES.

209
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,750
- I REALLY THOUGHT
YOU HAD CHANGED,

210
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,583
BUT YOU'RE JUST AS
SHADY AS EVER.

211
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,208
- ( gasps )

212
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,708
- ERZA!
- OH, NO.

213
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,375
- THIS IS BAD, GUYS.

214
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,083
WE'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY
TO STOP THE VENOM FROM SPREADING

215
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,500
OR SHE'LL DIE.

216
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:21,000
- WE NEED WENDY.
SHE COULD SAVE YOUR FRIEND.

217
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,666
THIS IS NO TIME FOR US TO BE
BICKERING AMONGST OURSELVES.

218
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,500
WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER
TO COME UP WITH A PLAN

219
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:26,916
TO RESCUE WENDY.

220
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,916
AND I SUPPOSE
THAT TOMCAT TOO.

221
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,500
- WAIT A SEC.

222
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,916
YOU'RE SAYING THAT LITTLE GIRL
HAS SOME KIND OF

223
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,500
ANTI-VENOM MAGIC?

224
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,166
- AMAZING.
- NOT JUST ANTI-VENOM.

225
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,083
SHE CAN CURE FEVERS,
RELIEVE PAIN,

226
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,666
AND HEAL WOUNDS.
- UM, EXCUSE ME.

227
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,375
I FEEL AS THOUGH MY
ROLE IN THE GROUP

228
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,958
IS BEING THREATENED, AND I
FIND THAT RATHER UNSETTLING.

229
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,958
- THAT'S CRAZY. EVERYONE KNOWS
HEALING SPELLS ARE LOST MAGIC.

230
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,208
THERE'S NO WAY
THE KID COULD USE THEM.

231
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,958
- DO THESE POWERS HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH

232
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,541
THAT WHOLE
"MAIDEN OF THE SKY" THING?

233
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,125
- YES IT DOES.

234
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,541
YOU SEE,
THAT LITTLE GIRL

235
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,041
IS THE SKY DRAGON SLAYER.

236
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,875
SHE'S WENDY, THE SKY DRAGON.

237
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,750
- ( all gasp )

238
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,958
- SHE'S A DRAGON SLAYER TOO?!

239
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,125
- I'LL GIVE YOU
ALL THE DETAILS LATER.

240
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,041
ALTHOUGH TO BE HONEST,
THERE'S REALLY NOT MUCH MORE

241
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,041
YOU NEED TO KNOW.
- ( exhales )

242
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,791
- WENDY IS THE ONLY WIZARD
CAPABLE OF SAVING YOUR FRIEND.

243
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,458
WE NEED HER RIGHT NOW.

244
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,958
UNFORTUNATELY,
THE ORACION SEIS

245
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,500
FEEL THEY NEED HER TOO
FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON.

246
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,416
- IN THAT CASE...

247
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,000
- THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
FOR US TO DO.

248
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,458
- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
RESCUE WENDY.

249
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,333
- WE'LL DO IT FOR
ERZA'S SAKE.

250
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:29,875
- AND HAPPY'S TOO.

251
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,583
- OKAY!

252
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,791
ARE YOU WITH ME?!

253
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:34,750
- All: YEAH!

254
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,583
- Narrator:
DEEP INSIDE THE WORTH WOODSEA,

255
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,833
THERE IS A VILLAGE
THAT WAS ONCE THE CAPITAL

256
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,000
OF AN ANCIENT CIVILIZATION.

257
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,833
THIS WAS WHERE
THE VILLAGERS WORSHIPPED.

258
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,833
IT IS SAID A PRIESTESS
WOULD ENTER THIS CAVE

259
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:01,000
IN ORDER TO HEAR
THE WORDS OF THE GODS.

260
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,041
HOWEVER,
IN THIS DAY AND AGE,

261
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,625
THE SACRED CAVE SERVES
AS A HIDEOUT

262
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,458
FOR THE ORACION SEIS.

263
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,833
- ( grunts )

264
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,583
- ( chuckles )

265
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,041
- HEY!  DON'T BE SO ROUGH.

266
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,791
SHE'S JUST A LITTLE GIRL,
YOU KNOW.

267
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:15,875
- HAPPY.

268
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,375
- ( whimpers )

269
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,125
( muffled yelling )
- LET HIM GO!

270
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,041
- ( grunts )

271
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,791
- WHOA...

272
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,458
- YOU'RE NOT HURT
TOO BAD, ARE YOU?

273
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,208
- NO.  DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ME, LITTLE LADY.

274
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,458
I'M GONNA DO MY BEST
TO FIND US A WAY OUT OF HERE.

275
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,583
PROMISE.
- THANK YOU.

276
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,708
- WHAT'S THE DEAL?

277
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,583
I DON'T GET WHY
THIS GIRL IS SO IMPORTANT.

278
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,791
- DOES SHE HAVE
SOMETHING TO DO WITH NIRVANA?

279
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,583
- SHE DOESN'T SEEM
ALL THAT SPECIAL TO ME.

280
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,250
- IS SHE WORTH MONEY?

281
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,916
YOU'RE GONNA SELL HER TO
THE HIGHEST BIDDER, RIGHT?

282
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
OH, YEAH!
- YOU REALIZE THAT CASH

283
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,666
ISN'T THE ANSWER
TO EVERYTHING?

284
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,083
- WELL I THINK IT IS,
BECAUSE MONEY

285
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,500
CAN BUY EVERYTHING,
EVEN LOVE.

286
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,208
- OH, GIVE ME A BREAK.

287
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,666
- SHE USES WHAT'S CALLED
"SKY MAGIC."

288
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,000
IT GIVES HER THE POWER
TO HEAL OTHERS.

289
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,666
- HOW'S THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

290
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,750
- ISN'T IT A LOST MAGIC?

291
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,666
- ONE OF MANY PRACTICES
FORGOTTEN LONG AGO.

292
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,500
- ( snores )
- OH, YEAH.

293
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,625
I CAN PRACTICALLY
SMELL THE MONEY. 

294
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,083
- ( chuckles )
WHAT GOOD IS A HEALER TO US?

295
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,666
WAIT, YOU DON'T MEAN...

296
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,541
- SHE IS THE KEY.

297
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,083
WITH HER POWER,

298
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,458
WE SHALL REVIVE HIM!

299
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,250
- WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

300
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:28,375
- LOOK, IF YOU'RE ASKING
ME TO HELP YOU, FORGET IT!

301
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,708
I'D NEVER DO ANYTHING
FOR JERKS LIKE YOU.

302
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,125
- YES, YOU WILL.
THERE'S NO DOUBT.

303
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,333
- ( exhales )

304
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,875
- ONCE YOU FIND OUT
WHO IT IS,

305
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,708
YOU'LL BE MORE
THAN HAPPY TO HELP.

306
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,541
- ( gasps )
- RACER,

307
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,375
BRING HIM TO ME AT ONCE.

308
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,208
- WILL DO, BOSS.
BUT IT'S SO FAR,

309
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,375
IT'LL TAKE ME AN HOUR 
TO GET THERE AND BACK.

310
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,125
- NO MATTER.
- I SEE.

311
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,750
ONCE HE'S REVIVED...

312
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,958
WE'LL BE ABLE TO
FIND NIRVANA IN NO TIME.

313
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,000
YOU'RE DOING
YOUR NAME PROUD, SIR.

314
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,708
- COBRA, HOTEYE, ANGEL,

315
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:00,541
I WANT YOU TO CONTINUE 
THE SEARCH FOR NIRVANA.

316
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,625
- BUT WHY?
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.

317
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,833
WE SHOULD BEGIN THE SEARCH
AFTER HE'S BEEN REVIVED.

318
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,833
- COME ON.
YOU GUYS JUST TELL US

319
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,375
WHO YOU'RE TRYING
TO BRING BACK.

320
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:12,166
- I WOULD PREFER TO ERR
ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION.

321
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,583
MIDNIGHT AND I
WILL REMAIN HERE.

322
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:17,833
SOMETHING TELLS ME HE WON'T
MAKE VERY GOOD COMPANY.

323
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,250
- ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS.

324
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,583
GUESS WE'D BETTER
GET GOING.

325
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,083
- YOU BOYS WANT TO RACE ME?

326
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,916
WHOEVER'S THE FIRST
TO FIND NIRVANA

327
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
WINS A PRIZE--

328
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,250
- IN THE AMOUNT OF
ONE MILLION JEWEL!

329
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,166
OH, YEAH!
COUNT ME IN.

330
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,666
- DON'T YOU THINK
A MILLION'S A BIT MUCH?

331
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,166
- BE HONEST WITH ME.

332
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,666
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THESE CREEPS

333
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,250
ARE TALKING ABOUT,
DO YOU?

334
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,750
- UM, WELL NO.

335
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,416
NOT REALLY.

336
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,333
WHAT DOES NIRVANA DO?

337
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,041
PLEASE TELL US THAT MUCH.

338
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,166
- IT'S INCREDIBLY POWERFUL.

339
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,250
IT SWAPS LIGHT
FOR DARKNESS. 

340
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,250
- UH...

341
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,791
- BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- ME NEITHER.

342
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,458
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

343
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,833
- Narrator: MEANWHILE,
NATSU AND THE OTHERS

344
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:06,291
DECIDE TO SPLIT UP INTO GROUPS
SO THEY CAN COVER MORE GROUND

345
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,250
IN THEIR SEARCH FOR WENDY AND
HAPPY.

346
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:11,375
THE FIRST GROUP IS
NATSU AND GRAY OF FAIRY TAIL,

347
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:14,625
ALONG WITH CARLA
OF CAIT SHELTER.

348
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,208
THEN THERE'S JURA,
LYON, AND SHERRY

349
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,041
OF LAMIA SCALE.

350
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,291
AND THE BOYS OF
BLUE PEGASUS,

351
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,375
ICHIYA, REN, AND EVE.

352
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,791
- SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

353
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,250
I HAVEN'T HEARD
A SINGLE "MAN."

354
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,625
- I THOUGHT HE WAS
RIGHT BEHIND US.

355
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,000
- I GUESS WE MUST
HAVE LOST HIM.

356
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,666
- REN!

357
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,333
AND EVE!

358
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,541
WHERE ARE YOU, MAN?

359
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,208
- ( chuckling )

360
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,666
- Narrator: THAT LEAVES US
WITH LUCY OF FAIRY TAIL,

361
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,666
AND HIBIKI OF BLUE PEGASUS,

362
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:51,166
WHO'VE CHOSEN TO STAY
BY THE AILING ERZA'S SIDE.

363
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:55,000
- ( gasping )

364
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,083
- IT'S BAD.
COME ON, GUYS,

365
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,500
PLEASE HURRY.

366
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,083
- ( murmurs )

367
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,583
- YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT
GONNA HELP, RIGHT?

368
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,166
INSTEAD OF SITTING
AROUND WORRYING,

369
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,916
WHY DON'T WE TRY TO
LEND THEM A HAND?

370
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,750
- AND HOW ARE WE
GONNA DO THAT?

371
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,250
- I KNOW WE DON'T REALLY 
CONSIDER OURSELVES A TEAM

372
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,708
SINCE OUR COALITION WAS 
KIND OF THROWN TOGETHER,

373
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,291
BUT WE NEED TO START
THINKING THAT WAY

374
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,625
IF WE WANT TO DEFEAT
THE ORACION SEIS.

375
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,708
- ARCHIVE MAGIC.

376
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,791
THAT'S THE NAME FOR WHAT YOU'RE
WORKING WITH NOW, ISN'T IT?

377
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,875
- THAT'S RIGHT.
IT SURE COMES IN HANDY

378
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,583
WHENEVER I NEED TO
KEEP TABS ON PEOPLE.

379
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,291
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA GO 
JOIN THE OTHERS, LUCY?

380
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,041
- NO, I NEED TO
STAY WITH ERZA.

381
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,541
I CAN'T LEAVE HER.

382
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,875
IT'S NOT LIKE I'D BE
ANY HELP ANYWAY.

383
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:37,041
I'M OBVIOUSLY THE WEAKEST
FIGHTER IN THE GROUP.

384
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,666
- YOU'RE JUST BEING MODEST.

385
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,625
I'VE HEARD RUMORS
OF YOUR STRENGTH.

386
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:41,791
THERE WAS THE TIME
YOU BEAT UP 19 VULCANS

387
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,541
THAT STOOD 10 FEET TALL.

388
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,041
AND THEN THERE WAS FAIRY TAIL'S
BATTLE AGAINST PHANTOM

389
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,250
I HEARD YOU KNOCKED OUT
THEIR INFAMOUS MASTER JOSE

390
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,500
WITH YOUR BARE HANDS.

391
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,708
AND THE TIME IN ACALYPHA
WHEN YOU SINGLE-HANDEDLY

392
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,041
TOOK ON A DARK GUILD THAT HAD
OVER A THOUSAND MEMBERS.

393
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,083
- THAT'S STRETCHING THE TRUTH.
- UH-HUH.

394
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:59,750
- SO, HIBIKI, HOW COME YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO JOIN THE OTHERS?

395
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,583
- WHAT KIND OF MAN WOULD I BE
IF I LEFT YOU LADIES ALONE?

396
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,666
- THANKS.  GUESS YOU'RE
NOT SO BAD AFTER ALL.

397
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,250
YOU'RE DEFINITELY A LOT NICER
THAN "SORCERER WEEKLY"

398
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,333
MADE YOU OUT TO BE.

399
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,333
- GOOD TO KNOW.
THANKS TO ARCHIVE,

400
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,083
I CAN KEEP TRACK
OF THE OTHERS.

401
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,666
AND I CAN MAKE THEM AWARE
OF OUR CURRENT POSITION TOO.

402
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,000
THAT WAY ONCE THEY'VE
RESCUED WENDY AND HAPPY,

403
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:21,375
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO LOCATE US,
AND SAVE ERZA.

404
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,458
- OH, WOW. YOU'VE GOT ALL THE
BASES COVERED, DON'T YOU?

405
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,666
- WELL, YOU CAN THANK
MASTER ICHIYA.

406
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,416
I'M JUST DOING
WHAT I WAS TAUGHT.

407
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,708
- ( chuckles )

408
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,833
- HERE WE GO.
I FOUND NATSU'S GROUP.

409
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:39,166
- SO IF SHE'S
A SKY DRAGON SLAYER,

410
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,500
WHAT DOES SHE 
EAT FOR POWER?

411
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,958
- AIR, OF COURSE.

412
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,916
- DOES IT TASTE ANY GOOD?
- I DON'T KNOW.

413
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,708
- I DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S
ANY DIFFERENT FROM BREATHING.

414
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:50,375
- YOU KNOW, THE ONLY REASON 
SHE APPLIED FOR THIS MISSION

415
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,875
IS BECAUSE SHE WANTED
TO GET THE CHANCE TO MEET YOU.

416
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,041
- WHY ME?

417
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,958
- BECAUSE YOU'RE A
FELLOW DRAGON SLAYER.

418
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,541
THERE'S SOMETHING SHE
WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT.

419
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,375
- DID SHE TELL YOU?
- YES.

420
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:04,125
APPARENTLY, THE DRAGON WHO
TAUGHT HER DRAGON SLAYER MAGIC

421
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,958
MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED
SEVEN YEARS AGO.

422
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,875
SHE WAS HOPING THAT YOU
MIGHT BE ABLE TO TELL HER

423
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,666
ITS WHEREABOUTS.

424
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,875
- I NEED MORE INFO.
WHAT'S THE DRAGON'S NAME?

425
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,916
- I BELIEVE WENDY CALLED HER
THE SKY DRAGON GRANDINA.

426
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,666
- SKY DRAGON GRANDINA.

427
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,916
SEVEN YEARS AGO.
( grunts )

428
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,583
- HMM.
- HOLD ON!

429
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,000
MAYBE LAXUS KNOWS.

430
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,000
- THAT GUY'S NOTHING
BUT A LOSER.

431
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,208
GRAMPS SAID HE'S NOT A REAL
DRAGON SLAYER, REMEMBER?

432
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,541
- ( Carla gasps )
- HUH?

433
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,458
- WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE?
- ( gasps )

434
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,583
- THE TREES...
THEY'RE BLACK.

435
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,166
- OH, MAN. THAT'S CREEPY.

436
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,833
- ( gasps )
- WORD ON THE STREET IS

437
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,333
IT'S CAUSED BY NIRVANA,

438
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,125
AIN'T THAT RIGHT,
BIG BRO ZATOU?

439
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,750
- OH, YEAH.

440
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,291
MAGIC SO POWERFUL,
THE PLANET CAN'T TAKE IT.

441
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:05,083
EVERYTHING IT TOUCHES
WITHERS UP AND DIES, BIG BRO.

442
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,416
- ( laughing, cackling )

443
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,583
- OH, DEAR.  THIS IS BAD.

444
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,458
THEY'VE GOT US SURROUNDED.

445
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:16,041
- WORD ON THE STREET IS
IT'S CAUSED BY NIRVANA.

446
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,458
- WOULD YOU STOP REPEATING
YOURSELF, BIG BRO GATOU?

447
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,041
- OH, MAN, I DIDN'T
EVEN NOTICE, BIG BRO ZATOU.

448
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,958
- WHOA, AWESOME.

449
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,333
THOSE TWO HAVE GOT TO BE THE
DUMBEST MONKEYS I'VE EVER SEEN.

450
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,958
- HEY!  YOU BLOCKHEADS ARE
MEMBERS OF THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD.

451
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,875
YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH
THAT BLONDE GIRL.

452
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,875
- YEAH, I REMEMBER THEM NOW.
THEY'RE FRIENDS WITH THAT GIRL

453
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:35,208
WHO RUINED OUR PLANS
IN ACALYPHA, AIN'T THEY?

454
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,666
- OHH!  THAT ONE THERE
IS AN ANGRY MONKEY.

455
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,875
- DON'T GO MESSING
WITH NAKED MUMMY. 

456
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,916
WE'RE WITH THE ORACION SEIS.

457
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,500
- THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU GOT A DEATH WISH, PAL?

458
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,416
- WHAT'S THIS
NAKED MUMMY BUSINESS?

459
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,416
- ARE YOU SERIOUSLY
THAT STUPID?

460
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,166
THEY'RE THE DARK GUILD THAT LUCY
TOLD US ABOUT THE OTHER DAY.

461
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,083
- IT WAS A TRAP.

462
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,416
THEY TRICKED US INTO THINKING
WE'D BE FACING SIX WIZARDS.

463
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,250
- WELL I SAY
THE MORE THE MERRIER.

464
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,666
- NO KIDDING.
BRING ON THE MONKEYS.

465
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,583
- WHAT IN THE WORLD HAS
GOTTEN INTO YOU TWO?

466
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,500
WE SHOULD RUN WHILE
WE HAVE THE CHANCE.

467
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,916
- NO WAY.
THAT WOULD BE RUDE.

468
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,166
ESPECIALLY AFTER THEY WERE
KIND ENOUGH TO COME TO US.

469
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,500
WE'RE NOT LEAVING UNTIL THEY
TELL US WHERE THEIR BASE IS.

470
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,208
- WHERE ARE YOU HIDING
OUR FRIENDS HAPPY AND WENDY?

471
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,416
- YOU THINK A LITTLE FIRE'S
GONNA SCARE US?

472
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,416
- DON'T GO MESSING
WITH NAKED MUMMY. 

473
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,666
WE'RE WITH THE ORACION SEIS.
- YOU ALREADY SAID THAT, DUMMY!

474
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,416
- ( chuckles ) THIS IS THE END
OF THE LINE FOR YOU FAIRIES.

475
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,416
- ( rhythmic chanting )

476
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,166
- ( Natsu and Gray chuckle )

477
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,541
- I'M BEGINNING TO THINK
THESE FAIRY TAIL WIZARDS

478
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,083
ARE COMPLETELY INSANE.

479
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,125
DO THEY HONESTLY THINK
THEY STAND A CHANCE

480
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,958
AGAINST THIS ENTIRE GUILD?

481
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,958
- ( chanting continues )

482
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,708
- Narrator: MEANWHILE,
IN ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST,

483
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,625
REN AND EVE OF BLUE PEGASUS
FIND THEMSELVES

484
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,458
SURROUNDED BY
AN ENEMY AS WELL.

485
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,125
- JUDGING BY THEIR HAIR,
I'D SAY THEY'RE IN

486
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,958
THE BLACK UNICORN GUILD.

487
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,208
- THESE FUNNY LOOKING CREEPS
REALLY WANT TO GET IN OUR WAY?

488
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,041
- YOU GONNA CRY,
SILKY HAIRED LOSERS?

489
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,250
- DUMB PRETTY-BOYS.
- GAME OVER, SISSIES.

490
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,708
- Narrator: AND NATURALLY,
JURA, LYON, AND SHERRY

491
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,750
HAVE ALSO FOUND
THEMSELVES SURROUNDED.

492
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,875
- THEY'RE MEMBERS OF
THE RED HOOD DARK GUILD.

493
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,166
- I HAD NO IDEA
WE WERE BEING FOLLOWED.

494
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,125
- I DON'T THINK THEY KNOW
WHO THEY'RE DEALING WITH.

495
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,166
- IT'S JURA,
THE WIZARD SAINT.

496
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,625
- IF WE CAN DEFEAT HIM,
IT'LL MAKE US FAMOUS.

497
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,166
- AAH!

498
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,916
- Narrator:
AND LET'S NOT FORGET HIM.

499
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,333
- I'M JUST A SIMPLE TRAVELER
WHO GOT SEPARATED FROM

500
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,083
THE REST OF HIS PARTY.

501
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:24,750
SO PLEASE, DON'T MAKE A MESS
OF MY HANDSOME FACE.

502
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,916
MAN!

503
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,125
- Racer:
SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG.

504
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,750
THING'S SO HEAVY, IT WAS HARD
FOR ME TO BUILD UP ANY SPEED.

505
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,000
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT I WAS FAST,
BUT AFTER THAT TRIP

506
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,500
I'M STARTING TO
DOUBT MYSELF.

507
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,208
- LET ME ASSURE YOU, RACER,

508
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,291
THERE IS NO ONE WHO
CAN COME EVEN CLOSE

509
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,416
TO MATCHING YOUR SPEED.

510
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,333
- WHAT IS THAT?

511
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,166
- Happy: IT'S A COFFIN.

512
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,958
- IT'S TIME, WENDY. ARE YOU
READY TO USE YOUR HEALING MAGIC

513
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,125
TO RESURRECT THE MAN INSIDE?

514
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,791
- NO!  I TOLD YOU,

515
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,375
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT,
AND YOU CAN'T MAKE ME.

516
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,916
- YEAH, YOU HEARD THE LADY.

517
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,541
- I'M SORRY.
PERHAPS I FORGOT TO MENTION

518
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,916
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE
IN THE MATTER!

519
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,833
- ( gasps )
- WHOA!  WHAT THE--?

520
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,458
- ( gasps )

521
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,250
- ALLOW ME TO
INTRODUCE YOU TO JELLAL.

522
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,500
A BRILLIANT WIZARD
WHO ONCE INFILTRATED

523
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:52,875
THE MAGIC COUNCIL.

524
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,333
- IT'S NOT HIM.
IT CAN'T BE.

525
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,916
- BUT IT IS.
ONCE HE'S REVIVED,

526
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,291
HE WILL LEAD US TO NIRVANA.

527
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,583
- REVIVE HIM?
BUT HOW?!

528
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,166
WHAT DO YOU EVEN
MEAN BY THAT?

529
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,250
LIKE BRINGING HIM
BACK FROM THE DEAD?

530
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,750
- IT'S REALLY HIM.

531
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,125
- HOW DO YOU KNOW JELLAL?

532
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,000
- OVEREXPOSURE TO ETHER-NANO

533
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,708
CAUSED HIM TO GO INTO
A CATATONIC STATE.

534
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:13,625
THOUGH HE'S BEEN
RENDERED UNCONSCIOUS,

535
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,375
HE'S STILL FAR FROM DEAD.

536
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,750
YOU ARE THE ONLY WIZARD 
CAPABLE OF REVIVING HIM.

537
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:20,875
ISN'T THAT THE LEAST
YOU CAN DO

538
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:23,041
AFTER ALL HE'S
DONE FOR YOU? 

539
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,125
- ( gasps )

540
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:30,083
- ( exhales )

541
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,750
- ( end theme playing )

542
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:50,083
- ( singing in Japanese )

543
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,708
- Natsu: WHOA! ALL OF A SUDDEN
THE BAD GUYS

544
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,083
ARE COMING OUT IN DROVES.

545
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:17,500
- Happy: WATCH OUT!
THEY'RE NOT JUST ANY BAD GUYS.

546
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,333
THEY'RE FROM THE DARK GUILDS!

547
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,416
- Natsu: I AIN'T SCARED OF THEM.
I'LL KICK THEIR BUTTS

548
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,375
AND THEN I'LL FORCE THEM TO TELL
ME WHERE THEY'RE HIDING WENDY.

549
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:24,791
- Happy: AREN'T YOU
FORGETTING SOMEONE?

550
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:26,666
YOUR LIFE WOULD BE
MISERABLE WITHOUT ME.

551
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,333
- Natsu:
I GOTTA SAVE BOTH OF YOU?

552
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,541
IN THAT CASE, I SHOULD WARM UP
BEFORE THE BIG FIGHT.

553
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:33,458
- ( Natsu and Happy speaking )

554
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:34,541
- Happy: DON'T GET TRIPPED UP,

555
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,083
'CAUSE YOU WON'T BE
SAVING ANYBODY.

556
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,250
- Natsu: COME ON.
HAVE A LITTLE FAITH, WOULD YOU?

557
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:39,375
- Happy: I DON'T KNOW.

558
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:41,000
MY CHANCES MIGHT BE
BETTER WITH GRAY.
