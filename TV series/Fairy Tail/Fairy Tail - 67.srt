1
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:19,791
Natsu:
PREVIOUSLY, ON "FAIRY TAIL"...

2
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,291
- Ichiya:
ICHIYA OF BLUE PEGASUS

3
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,041
AND HIS ADORING MINIONS
THE TRIMEN

4
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,125
CLAIMED VICTORY
OVER THE ORACION SEIS.

5
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:27,416
NOW THE DARING ICHIYA
MUST TAKE LEAVE

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,916
OF HIS BELOVED HONEY MISS ERZA

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,416
TO FIGHT FOR THE HOPES AND
DREAMS OF NOT ONLY HIS COMRADES,

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,166
BUT OF ALL MANKIND.

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,875
- Happy: REALLY PLAYING
YOURSELF UP THERE, PAL.

10
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:40,666
- ( theme music playing )

11
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:56,833
- ( singing in Japanese )

12
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:10,250
- Narrator:
THE MUCH SOUGHT AFTER NIRVANA

13
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,375
IS A POWERFUL SPELL CAPABLE

14
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,708
OF SWITCHING LIGHT
AND DARKNESS.

15
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:17,791
ITS CREATORS THE NIRVITS,
FEARFUL OF ITS POWER,

16
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,291
SEALED IT AWAY
A LONG TIME AGO.

17
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,708
THEIR DESCENDANTS
BANDED TOGETHER

18
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,583
TO FORM THE CAIT
SHELTER GUILD.

19
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:29,250
NOW THE ORACION SEIS'
MASTER ZERO IS USING

20
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,958
THE NIRVITS' CREATION
AGAINST THEM,

21
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:36,666
AS HE HAS NIRVANA AIMED DIRECTLY
AT THE CAIT SHELTER GUILD HALL.

22
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,666
NATSU AND THE OTHERS MUST DO
EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER

23
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,416
TO STOP MASTER ZERO
BEFORE TIME RUNS OUT.

24
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,041
- Natsu: I CAN FEEL MY FRIENDS'
DETERMINATION AND STRENGTH

25
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,083
PULSATING THROUGH ME!

26
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,125
- I SHALL RETURN YOU
TO THE NOTHINGNESS

27
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,583
FROM WHENCE YOU CAME.

28
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,500
- DRAGON SLAYER SECRET ART!

29
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:59,375
FLAME LOTUS,
EXPLODING FLAME BLADE!

30
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,916
- ( Happy speaking )

31
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:10,916
- IT'S GO TIME.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.  LET'S DO THIS.

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,916
- OPEN, GATE OF THE GOLDEN BULL.
TAURUS!

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,625
- GO, COW!

34
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:19,833
- ( roaring )

35
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,541
- WE'RE BOTH COUNTING
ON YOU, TAURUS.

36
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:29,291
- MOO!  IF I DO THIS,
DO I GET A SMOOCH

37
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,458
FROM THE TWO OF YOU?

38
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,000
- ( roars )

39
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,375
POWER PARFUM

40
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:38,166
TO THE MAX.

41
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,041
MAN!

42
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,708
- REQUIP.

43
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,708
BLACK WING ARMOR.

44
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,000
HERE WE GO.

45
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:55,250
- GRANDINA,
LEND ME YOUR STRENGTH.

46
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:59,083
- WENDY, I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT

47
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,708
IF YOU JUST STAY FOCUSED.

48
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:05,083
- ( screaming )

49
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:08,916
HISTORY WILL COME TO AN END
BEFORE MY EYES.

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,833
A NEW ERA OF NOTHINGNESS
SHALL BE USHERED IN.

51
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,750
GENESIS ZERO.

52
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,875
NOW OPEN,
PORTAL OF THE DEMON'S WAIL.

53
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,958
GO TRAVELERS OF THE VOID.

54
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:34,541
I WANT YOU TO CONSUME THAT
MAN'S SOUL AND HIS MEMORY.

55
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,541
CONSUME HIS VERY EXISTENCE.

56
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:43,875
DEVOUR HIM.

57
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,208
DO IT FOR THE SAKE
OF YOUR MASTER.

58
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,875
- ( screaming )

59
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,916
- AND NOW, YOU TOO,

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,625
ARE A TRAVELER
OF THE INFINITE VOID.

61
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,250
GOODBYE, DRAGON SLAYER.

62
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,916
WHAT THE-- THIS SUCKS.

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,875
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING,

64
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,583
AND I'M ALL OUT OF POWER.

65
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,083
WHAT'LL I DO?

66
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:19,666
- Igneel:
NATSU, WHAT HAPPENED?

67
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,333
HOW COULD YOU ALLOW HIM
TO DEFEAT YOU SO EASILY?

68
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,416
HOW DISAPPOINTING.

69
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,833
AND YOU CALL YOURSELF
THE SON OF IGNEEL?

70
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:32,708
- AW, COME ON, YOU DON'T
REALLY EXPECT ME TO SHATTER

71
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,833
THAT HUGE ROCK ALL BY MYSELF,
DO YOU?

72
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:38,041
- I'M NOT ASKING THE IMPOSSIBLE
OF YOU, MY BOY.

73
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:42,750
I KNOW YOU HAVE THE POWER TO
DO IT.  STOP DOUBTING YOURSELF.

74
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:46,250
- NEVER FORGET YOU ARE
A TRUE DRAGON SLAYER

75
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:50,666
AND YOU SHOULD TAKE PRIDE
IN THAT ACCOMPLISHMENT.

76
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,000
KNOW THAT NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS,

77
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:57,333
I, IGNEEL,
WILL ALWAYS BE PROUD OF YOU.

78
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,875
- OKAY, I'LL TRY AGAIN.

79
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:03,416
BUT I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

80
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,125
- LET'S GO, ICE CANNON!

81
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,291
- HERE WE GO!
- GO!

82
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,666
- INFINITY SPARKLE!

83
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:21,291
- ONLY HAVE ONE CHANCE, SO I'LL
PUT ALL OF MY REMAINING POWER

84
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,250
INTO THIS GLOVE.
( yells )

85
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:28,250
- SKY DRAGON ROAR!

86
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:36,625
- NO, IT CAN'T BE.
- ( explosion )

87
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,083
- HOW DID HE COME BACK
FROM THE VOID?

88
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,916
SUCH BRILLIANT GOLDEN FLAMES.
MY MAGIC IS BEING BURNT AWAY.

89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,375
( screaming )

90
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:05,083
Zero: HIS LOST MAGIC GIVES HIM
THE POWER OF A DRAGON

91
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:09,083
AND IN TURN,
THE POWER TO DEFEAT ONE.

92
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:12,041
THIS BOY IS A TRUE

93
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,500
DRAGON SLAYER.

94
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:18,500
- I'M DONE PLAYING GAMES
WITH YOU, PAL.

95
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:22,666
DRAGON SLAYER SECRET ART.
HIDDEN FIRE FORM.

96
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,041
FLAME LOTUS PHOENIX SWORD!

97
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,250
- ( screaming )

98
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,708
- ( clamoring )

99
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,291
- GUESS THIS MEANS IT WORKED.

100
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,666
WE HIT ALL OF 'EM
AT THE SAME TIME.

101
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,541
- WE DID IT!
- ( cheering )

102
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,041
- AWW, YEAH!
- PERFECT TIMING.

103
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,708
WE DID IT.
GOOD JOB, EVERYONE.

104
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:33,083
- THANKS TO YOU, NATSU.

105
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,208
- ( gasps )

106
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,083
- Natsu:
THAT WAS ROUGH.

107
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,000
WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT ONE LACRIMA
WOULD BE SO HARD TO BREAK?

108
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,000
( coughs )

109
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,083
NO MORE DOUBTING MYSELF.

110
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,125
THANK YOU, IGNEEL.

111
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,625
- ( laughing )

112
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,416
- I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, WENDY.

113
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,083
CAIT SHELTER HAS BEEN SAVED.

114
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:59,833
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
WE STOPPED NIRVANA.

115
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,833
- ( snickers )

116
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,125
- NATSU DRAGNEEL.

117
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,708
AMAZING.

118
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,916
HE'S EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS.

119
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,583
- AW, CRAP.
I'M ALL OUT OF MAGIC ENERGY.

120
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,083
( shouting )

121
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,083
THAT WAS CLOSE.

122
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,666
- I'VE GOT YOU.
- FOR NOW ANYWAY.

123
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,541
THIS SPELLS TROUBLE
FOR YOU, TOO, YOU KNOW?

124
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,750
- PROBABLY NOT A VERY
GOOD SIGN, IS IT?

125
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,625
- THIS PLACE IS FALLING APART.

126
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,583
- I'D MAKE A RUN FOR IT
IF I WERE YOU.

127
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,958
- YOU'RE GONNA GET SQUISHED
IF YOU STICK AROUND.

128
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,666
- DO YOU KNOW IF THERE'S SOME
KIND OF EMERGENCY EXIT?

129
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,583
- WE'RE NOT ALL-KNOWING.

130
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,708
WE CAN ONLY READ THE THOUGHTS
OF THE PEOPLE WE'VE COPIED.

131
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,458
- AND NONE OF THEM KNEW ANYTHING
ABOUT ABOUT EMERGENCY EXITS.

132
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,916
- YOU'LL FIND YOUR WAY
OUT OF HERE SOMEHOW.

133
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,375
BEST OF LUCK TO YOU.

134
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,375
- Both: DON'T GO.

135
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,250
- AWW, MAN, THIS IS BAD.

136
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,541
WE GOTTA GET OUT 
OF THIS DUMP NOW.

137
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,791
- I HOPE EVERYONE'S ALL RIGHT.

138
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,500
- WAIT, MY HONEY.

139
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,666
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE
YOUR LOVE BEHIND.

140
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,041
( grunting )

141
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,208
- SLOW DOWN, CARLA.
I CAN'T KEEP UP.

142
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,166
- WE'VE GOT TO MOVE QUICKLY,
CHILD.

143
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,791
- OH!

144
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,583
- ( gasps )

145
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,083
- OW!
- WENDY!

146
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,458
- LOOK OUT!

147
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:46,458
- Jura: IRON ROCK WALL!
- ( screaming )

148
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,041
YOU SAVED US.

149
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,958
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE
AS GOOD AS DEAD.

150
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,833
- I SIMPLY NEEDED SOME TIME
TO RECUPERATE,

151
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,541
RESTORE MY MAGIC ENERGY.

152
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:59,000
WE HAVE TO HURRY.
NIRVANA'S RAPIDLY COLLAPSING.

153
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,625
- ( screaming )

154
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,541
THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

155
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:19,541
IT'S GOING DOWN FAST.
HOPE THE OTHERS MADE IT OUT.

156
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,458
- GRAY.
- ERZA.

157
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,125
AND...

158
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,250
- I'M SO GLAD YOU MADE IT
OUT SAFELY,

159
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,791
MY BLAZON-HAIRED BEAUTY.

160
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,250
- ( shrieking )

161
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,750
- WHO ARE YOU?

162
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,416
- YOU HEARD HER.
ANSWER THE LADY OR ELSE.

163
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,333
- PLEASE CALM DOWN.
CAN'T YOU SEE I'M YOUR ALLY?

164
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:44,208
MY POWER PARFUM HAS TEMPORARILY
ALTERED MY OUTWARD APPEARANCE.

165
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:47,333
BUT DEEP DOWN,
I HAVEN'T CHANGED.

166
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,458
( laughs )

167
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:53,541
I'M YOUR BELOVED ICHIYA,
AND YOU'RE MY HONEY.

168
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,791
LOOK AT ME SPARKLE.

169
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,875
- LOOKS LIKE YOUR 'LIL ADMIRER'S
GONE FULL-ON STALKER.

170
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,083
- NO JOKE.  I'D KICK HIM OUT
OF THE ALLIANCE,

171
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,500
BUT HE'S SO DEPENDABLE.

172
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:07,125
- ( yawning )

173
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:11,041
"SO DIZZY,"
SHE SAYS IN A WARBLED TONE.

174
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:14,583
- AN ENEMY.
- NO, STAND DOWN.

175
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,708
- YEAH, IT'S JUST ONE
OF LUCY'S SPIRITS.

176
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,083
- THANKS FOR SAVING US,
HOROLOGIUM.

177
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,291
BUT I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER
SUMMONING YOU.

178
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,166
- YOU DIDN'T.  I PASSED THROUGH
THE GATE OF MY OWN ACCORD.

179
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,458
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.
- YOU CAN RESCUE US ANY TIME

180
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,208
YOU FEEL LIKE IT.
THANKS.

181
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,958
- MISS LUCY'S MAGIC IS
GETTING STRONGER BY THE DAY,

182
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,000
SO IT'S LIKELY YOU'LL SEE
MORE CELESTIAL SPIRITS

183
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,541
DOING THE SAME.

184
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,541
THAT SAID, I'M MORE USEFUL THAN
THE OTHERS, AS I CAN PREVENT

185
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,041
OXYGEN DEPRIVATION,
INSECT BITES, INFLAMMATION

186
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,875
AND BLEMISHES.
- NO WAY.  HE PREVENTS ACNE?

187
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,625
- DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS
A PROBLEM FOR YOU.

188
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,541
- MY IDENTITY IS BEING
THREATENED AGAIN

189
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,500
AND I DON'T LIKE IT ONE BIT.
- THANK GOODNESS.

190
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,333
EVERYONE'S ALL RIGHT.
- EVEN THAT SILLY BLUE TOMCAT.

191
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:53,166
- NATSU AND JELLAL.
ARE THEY HERE?

192
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,333
- I DON'T SEE THEM.
- CARLA!

193
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:58,000
- COULD THEY BOTH BE INSIDE?
- Wendy: I HOPE NOT.

194
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,125
- NOW I'M WORRIED.
- HE'S PROBABLY LOST

195
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,375
IN THE WOODSEA,
KNOWING THAT FLAME-FOR-BRAINS.

196
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,875
- HEY, NATSU!

197
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:09,125
- NATSU.  JELLAL.

198
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,375
I KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE.

199
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,500
- WHERE ARE YOU, BUDDY?
WHOA!

200
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,541
- LOVE DRIVES US TO SAVE
OUR FRIENDS.  OH, YEAH!

201
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,708
- THERE HE IS.  ALWAYS
WITH THE DRAMATIC ENTRANCE.

202
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,458
- YOU'RE OKAY.

203
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,333
- WHAT ON EARTH
IS HE DOING HERE?

204
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,458
HE'S ONE OF
THE ORACION SEIS, ISN'T HE?

205
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,291
- YES, BUT HE'S ON OUR SIDE NOW.

206
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,375
IT'S A LONG STORY.
I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.

207
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,708
- ( laughing ) NATSU!

208
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:43,708
YOU KEPT YOUR PROMISE.
YOU'RE THE GREATEST.

209
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:47,041
I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH.

210
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,000
- ( laughs )

211
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:52,458
- IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU, CAIT
SHELTER WOULD'VE BEEN WIPED OUT.

212
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,291
- WELL, THERE'S NO WAY
I COULD'VE DONE IT ON MY OWN.

213
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,916
THANKS, YOU GUYS.

214
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,166
- YOU SAVED MY GUILD.

215
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,166
- NO, WE SAVED YOUR GUILD.
- MAN!

216
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,041
- Wendy:
I DIDN'T DO MUCH.

217
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:07,500
- COME ON, YOU DESTROYED
A LACRIMA, TOO.

218
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,916
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

219
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,750
- Happy: I'M GLAD EVERYONE MADE
IT OUT OF THERE OKAY.

220
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,666
- IT WAS CLOSE.
EXCELLENT WORK BY ALL INVOLVED.

221
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,416
- I THINK IT'S TIME FOR A GROUP
HUG.  WHO'S WITH ME?

222
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
- FORGET IT, CREEP.
- HEY.

223
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,750
SPEAKING OF CREEPS, WHO'S THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

224
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,833
- ANOTHER PRETTY BOY
FROM BLUE PEGASUS?

225
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:51,208
- WOULDN'T WE HAVE
MET HIM EARLIER?

226
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,625
- Erza: IT'S JELLAL.

227
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,000
- YOU KIDDING ME?
- OH, NO, NOT HIM AGAIN.

228
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,500
- Erza: HE'S CHANGED.

229
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,750
HE'S NOT THE SAME MAN WE DEALT
WITH BEFORE.

230
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,000
- Wendy:
HE'S COMPLETELY LOST HIS MEMORY.

231
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:05,125
- REALLY?  I STILL DON'T THINK
WE CAN TRUST THE GUY.

232
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,875
- YOU CAN, I PROMISE.

233
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,250
I'M TELLING YOU,
HE'S ACTUALLY A GOOD PERSON.

234
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:13,375
- I WANTED TO THANK YOU.

235
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,791
HONESTLY, WE COULDN'T HAVE
DONE THIS WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

236
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:19,500
- ERZA.  THAT'S NOT TRUE.

237
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,166
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WORTHY
OF SUCH PRAISE.

238
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,208
NOT AT ALL.

239
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,583
- SO TELL ME,
WHAT WILL YOU DO NOW?

240
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:30,083
- GOOD QUESTION.

241
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,833
I WISH I KNEW.

242
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,791
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.  I'M SURE
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE

243
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,291
IN THAT POSITION.

244
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,958
WHO KNOWS WHAT TOMORROW
MIGHT HAVE IN STORE?

245
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:47,333
- I'M AFRAID.
- OF WHAT?

246
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,708
- MY MEMORY.

247
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,666
OF IT RETURNING.

248
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,416
- DON'T BE.

249
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,458
IT WOULDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

250
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,250
EVEN IF WE WERE TO BECOME
ENEMIES AGAIN,

251
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:13,166
IT WOULDN'T CHANGE THE FACT
THAT I CARE ABOUT YOU.

252
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,208
- YOU DO?

253
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,916
- MORE THAN YOU KNOW.

254
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,416
- Ichiya: MY HANDSOME FACE!
- Natsu: HUH?

255
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,625
- Gray:
THERE A PROBLEM, MEATHEAD?

256
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,875
- I WANTED TO GO MAKE A LETTER
OF THE ALPHABET,

257
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,625
BUT I RAN
INTO AN INVISIBLE WALL.

258
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,041
- LOOK.  THERE'S WEIRD WRITING
ON THE GROUND.

259
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:33,375
- NO, IT CAN'T BE.

260
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,708
- All: AN ENCHANTMENT?
- Ichiya: MAN!

261
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,666
I'VE REALLY GOTTA PEE,
YOU GUYS.

262
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,291
- WHO'D DO SUCH A THING?

263
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,541
- AND HOW COME WE DIDN'T
NOTICE WHO CAST IT?

264
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,541
- IF I HAD TO GUESS,
I'D SAY IT'S FREED'S WORK.

265
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,208
STRIKE THAT.
THIS MAGIC IS MUCH MORE POWERFUL

266
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,291
THAN HIS COULD EVER BE.
- OH, GREAT,

267
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,625
HOW ARE WE GONNA GET OUT?

268
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,833
- OKAY, WHO DID THIS?
SHOW YOURSELF.

269
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,916
- WHO ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE?
- ( grunting ) LET ME GO PEE.

270
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,500
- THERE'S NO NEED TO PANIC.
WE MEAN YOU NO HARM.

271
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,125
SORRY ABOUT THIS,
BUT WE WERE FORCED

272
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,166
TO DO SOMETHING
TO RESTRAIN YOU.

273
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,000
- WHO THE HECK ARE YOU?

274
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,750
- I AM THE CAPTAIN
OF THE NEW MAGIC COUNCIL'S

275
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,583
FOURTH CUSTODY
ENFORCEMENT UNIT-- LAHAR.

276
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,625
AND THIS IS MY ARMY.

277
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,791
- WHAT?
- THERE'S A NEW MAGIC COUNCIL?

278
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,541
- SURE DIDN'T
TAKE 'EM VERY LONG.

279
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,750
IT IS MY DUTY TO UPHOLD THE LAW

280
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,791
AND PRESERVE JUSTICE
THROUGHOUT THE LAND.

281
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,125
SO ALL EVILDOERS
MUST BE ARRESTED.

282
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,666
- WE'RE NOT EVILDOERS.
- I DON'T GET WHY WE'RE

283
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,166
IN TROUBLE WHEN WE DIDN'T
EVEN DO ANYTHING WRONG.

284
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,833
- LEAST, NOT THAT WE KNOW OF.

285
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,625
- THAT'S NOT GONNA SELL HIM
ON OUR INNOCENCE, NATSU.

286
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,416
- I'M NOT HERE TO ARREST YOU.

287
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,041
I HAVE BEEN ORDERED TO TAKE
THE ORACION SEIS INTO CUSTODY.

288
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,708
I ASK THAT YOU PLEASE COOPERATE

289
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,875
AND HAND OVER THE MEMBER
CODENAMED "HOTEYE."

290
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:49,875
- ( gasping )
- NO, NEVER!

291
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,416
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SURRENDER.

292
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,875
- RICHARD, WHY?

293
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,208
- I CANNOT FULLY EMBRACE A LIFE
OF VIRTUE

294
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,458
WHEN MY PAST TRANSGRESSIONS
CONTINUE TO HAUNT ME.

295
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,875
THIS IS MY CHANCE
TO ATONE FOR MY SINS.

296
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:05,291
IT'S BEST THAT I HAVE A CLEAN
SLATE WHEN I FIND MY BROTHER.

297
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,000
THAT WAY, I WILL HAVE
NOTHING TO HIDE.

298
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:10,458
DON'T YOU AGREE?

299
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,041
- INDEED, MAY I CONTINUE
THE SEARCH FOR YOUR BROTHER

300
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,375
IN YOUR STEAD?
- YOU'D DO THAT FOR ME?

301
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,541
- I WOULD BE HONORED.
I JUST NEED HIS NAME.

302
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:22,166
HIS NAME IS WALLY.
WALLY BUCHANAN.

303
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,000
- HUH?
- HE'S YOUR BROTHER?

304
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:29,750
- DANDY.
- THE BLOCKHEAD?

305
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:33,250
- I MISS HIM DEARLY.
HE WAS A GOOD KID.

306
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:37,291
IN FACT, HE WAS THE BEST LITTLE
BROTHER A GUY COULD ASK FOR.

307
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,166
- JEEZ, THIS SOIL'S HARD.

308
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,708
- I KNOW BUT WE'VE GOTTA
KEEP WORKING.

309
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,208
IT MAY SEEM KIND OF
HOPELESS NOW,

310
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,125
BUT IF WE JUST STAY POSITIVE
AND STICK TO IT,

311
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:52,333
I KNOW IT'S BOUND TO BECOME
SOFT, RICH SOIL EVENTUALLY.

312
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,625
- YOU'RE RIGHT, BRO.

313
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,833
AS LONG AS WE STAY POSITIVE,
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN'T DO.

314
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,083
( laughs )

315
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,375
- MY BROTHER AND I STRUGGLED
TO SURVIVE

316
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,833
AFTER LOSING BOTH OF OUR
PARENTS.  IT WAS A TRYING TIME.

317
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,000
WE WORKED DILIGENTLY
IN THE HOPES

318
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,333
OF GROWING VEGETABLES
IN OUR MEAGER GARDEN.

319
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,041
UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN IT CAME TIME
FOR THE HARVEST,

320
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,000
WE WERE LEFT DISAPPOINTED.

321
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:21,833
- ( sobs )I CAN'T BELIEVE WE DID
ALL THAT WORK FOR NOTHING, BRO.

322
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,250
I KNEW THIS TOPSOIL
WAS NO GOOD.

323
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,208
WE DIDN'T GROW
A SINGLE VEGETABLE.  THIS SUCKS!

324
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,250
- COME ON, DON'T CRY, WALLY.

325
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,958
- I CAN'T HELP IT.

326
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:35,250
- ( gasps )

327
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,708
- WE DID IT.  WE GREW ONE!

328
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,916
CHECK IT OUT.
- OH, YEAH!

329
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,083
- ( stomach rumbling )

330
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,791
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT I'M READY TO CHOW DOWN.

331
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,833
- WE'RE NOT EATING ANYTHING
UNTIL WE'VE SAID GRACE.

332
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,750
A SINGLE POTATO MAY NOT
LOOK LIKE MUCH TO OTHERS,

333
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,125
BUT IN OUR EYES,
IT'S A BOUNTIFUL HARVEST

334
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,500
THAT HAS RENEWED
OUR DETERMINATION AND HOPE.

335
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,833
THANK YOU FOR THIS BLESSING
OF FOOD THAT YOU'VE GIVEN US.

336
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,416
- YEAH, THANKS A LOT
FOR THE GRUB.

337
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,041
NOW LET'S EAT UP.

338
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,291
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU GET HALF.

339
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,833
- MY STOMACH'S KIND OF BEEN
BOTHERING ME TODAY,

340
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,041
SO YOU CAN HAVE THE WHOLE THING.

341
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,250
- ARE YOU SURE?
- MM-HMM.

342
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,458
- WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?

343
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:23,833
- WELL, MY STOMACH'S
KIND OF BEEN BOTHERING ME, TOO,

344
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,000
SO THERE'S NO WAY I CAN EAT
THE WHOLE THING BY MYSELF.

345
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,125
HELP ME OUT AND TAKE HALF,
WOULD YOU?

346
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:31,208
- THANKS.

347
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:34,625
- ( laughs )

348
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,708
- EVEN THOUGH MANY YEARS
HAVE PASSED SINCE THAT DAY,

349
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:41,666
I CAN STILL REMEMBER THE TASTE
OF THAT POTATO.

350
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,583
- I KNOW YOUR BROTHER, RICHARD.
- YOU DO?

351
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,125
- YES,
HE'S AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE.

352
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:51,083
HE'S HAPPILY TRAVELING
THE CONTINENT RIGHT NOW.

353
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,708
- ( crying )

354
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,541
ALL THESE YEARS
I KEPT TELLING MYSELF

355
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,125
THAT IF I JUST STAYED POSITIVE,

356
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:19,000
A MIRACLE WOULD HAPPEN,
AND, LO AND BEHOLD, IT HAS.

357
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,000
( sobbing )

358
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:24,500
THANK YOU.  THANK YOU.

359
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:28,375
THANK YOU.
( continues sobbing )

360
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,333
- I FEEL KIND OF BAD FOR HIM,
YOU KNOW?

361
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,916
- ME, TOO.
- I GUESS IT CAN'T BE HELPED.

362
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,500
- IT MUST'VE BEEN DIFFICULT,

363
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,541
BUT I THINK HE MADE
THE RIGHT DECISION.

364
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,000
- COME ON. HELP ME OUT HERE!

365
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,500
IF YOU DON'T UNDO
THE ENCHANTMENT,

366
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:49,083
I'M GONNA WET MYSELF.
- YOU ARE SO DISGUSTING!

367
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:52,125
- SORRY, BUT I'M AFRAID
THAT'S SIMPLY NOT AN OPTION

368
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:55,416
AT THIS TIME.  NOT TILL WE'VE
CAPTURED OUR TRUE OBJECTIVE.

369
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,750
A FIEND WHO INFILTRATED
AND DESTROYED THE MAGIC COUNCIL

370
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:04,375
AND FIRED THE ETHERION CANNON.

371
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:08,375
A MAN MORE VILLAINOUS
THAN THE ORACION SEIS.

372
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,875
TRULY BLACK OF HEART.

373
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:13,041
I'M REFERRING TO YOU, JELLAL.

374
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,333
LET'S GO.
KNOW THAT IF YOU RESIST,

375
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:20,708
WE HAVE EXPLICIT ORDERS
TO KILL YOU.

376
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,041
- LEAVE HIM ALONE.
- YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE, MAN.

377
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,375
- JELLAL FERNANDES
IS A CRIMINAL.

378
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:29,291
SOCIETY IS IN DANGER
AS LONG AS HE ROAMS FREE.

379
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:32,416
HE MUST BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.

380
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:45,333
- ( end theme playing )

381
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,708
- ( singing in Japanese )

382
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,666
- Happy: NOW THAT WE'VE DEFEATED
THE ORACION SEIS,

383
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,958
WE CAN FINALLY
GO BACK TO THE GUILD HALL.

384
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,791
- Natsu: IT'S ABOUT TIME.
I THOUGHT THIS JOB WAS

385
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,791
GONNA DO US IN.  I MEAN, THOSE
GUYS WERE RIDICULOUSLY STRONG.

386
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:25,875
- WE GOT IN SOME PRETTY
STICKY SITUATIONS, TOO.

387
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,625
- NO JOKE.  IT'S A GOOD THING
WE JOINED THE ALLIANCE

388
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:30,375
'CAUSE WE COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
ON OUR OWN.

389
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:33,375
- ( Happy and Natsu speaking )

390
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:35,166
- Happy: I THINK WE DESERVE
A VICTORY PARTY

391
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,500
AFTER SUCH A TOUGH MISSION.

392
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:37,958
- Natsu: LET'S MAKE IT HAPPEN
WHEN WE GET BACK.

393
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:41,708
- SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.
- Both: PARTY!  PARTY!
