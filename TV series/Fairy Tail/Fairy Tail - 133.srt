[LUCY] I've figured
some things out...

Yeah, like what?

28
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,083
This book,
for instance...

29
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,458
My dad followed
its story to the letter.

30
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,250
What do you
mean by that?

31
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,458
I'm saying there's more fact
than fiction in its pages.

32
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,291
[LUCY] The "Key of the Starry
Heavens" is about a little girl

who goes in search
of six keys...

to bring happiness

to everyone around her.

That's no good...!
What a crappy ending.

this any faster, tom cat.

Sorry... Geez,
lighten up.

[ERZA] How does
the story begin?

45
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,208
Well, according
to what it says here,

46
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,208
"The first key takes a journey".

47
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,208
Yeah, right;
keys don't take journeys.

48
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:41,125
Dude... It's a metaphor.
Get with the program.

49
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,666
[NATSU] Alright, then where
in the heck did it go?!

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,250
[GRAY] Give me a
break... Do I have to

spell it out for you?

52
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,208
[GRAY] Think about it...
where did the Legion Platoon

53
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,583
strike first?

54
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,458
Wait, that means...

55
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:55,916
Yeah...

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,791
Michelle carried the clock hand
all the way to Fairy Tail.

57
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,375
So, In other words...
it "took a journey".

58
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,083
And everything
that's happened...

59
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,166
Is a direct result of it.

[LUCY] In the story...

62
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,916
the little girl
decides to go in search

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,208
of the five remaining keys.

64
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,916
One by one, she finds
them in a variety of places.

65
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,458
Finally, she travels
to a cathedral...

66
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,583
and that's where
she finds the sixth key.

67
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:35,666
A cathedral...?

68
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,375
You don't think...?

69
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:41,083
[LUCY] No, it isn't the Kardia
Cathedral here in town...

70
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,708
In fact, it's nowhere
near Magnolia.

71
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,291
[ERZA] How do
you know that?

72
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,875
[LUCY] This was
my favorite story when

73
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,666
I was a little girl...

74
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,958
I used to read it
over and over again...

75
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,541
One day I realized...

76
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,833
The places the girl traveled

77
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,666
in the "Key of the Starry
Heavens" were real.

78
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,083
Makes me wonder...

79
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,500
If my dad came to the same
realization, then I'll bet

80
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,958
he hid the other five clock
pieces in those spots.

81
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,375
Did he ever mention
any of this, Michelle?

82
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:17,708
Uh, no... Sorry...
Mr. Jude was very quiet

83
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,416
before he passed away.

84
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,291
In any case, I have
a feeling if we go

85
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,666
to the locations mentioned
in the book, we should have

86
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,041
no trouble finding the
rest of the pieces...

87
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,375
So who's with me?

88
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,333
[LUCY] I'm not sure what
the Legion Platoon wants

89
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,250
with the clock pieces but
I know we have to stop them!

90
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,750
C'mon guys...!

91
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,458
If this "chaos" thing is for
real, we can't just sit back

92
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,250
and let them do
whatever they please.

93
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,416
I'll go...!
With or without you!

Yeah...

96
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,541
I know Master won't approve,
but this really bothers me.

97
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,166
I have to do something.

98
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,583
I'll go with you.

help but you should

What the crap, man?!

102
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,666
Just 'cause you got bigger
doesn't mean you can

keep diggin' into me like that!

104

Correction...

105
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,625
I didn't get bigger, you got
smaller; so ya can't blame me

106
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,250
for crackin' a few jokes.

107
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,916
No time for jokes...
We're in a race here...

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and The Legion
Platoon's ahead of us.

109
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,208
From the sound of it,
we're gonna have

110
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,791
a lot of ground to cover.

111
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,250
[MAKAROV] This mission
relies on too much guesswork

112
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,375
for my taste...

113
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,750
Because we don't
actually know what

114
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,208
gathering the pieces will do.

115
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,583
That said...

116
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,375
We must do what we can
to keep this "chaos" at bay.

Excuse me, Lily...?

I'm pretty sure we're going
in the wrong direction.

121
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,333
Is it just me, or is
it kinda hard to tell

122
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,000
what the little guy's thinking?

123
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:56,125
Yeah... But at least
we know he's dependable.

124
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,625
Are you okay?

125
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:02,958
Do I look okay...?!
This stupid mountain...

don't mix... at all.

Don't you think we should
get back on track...?

129

It's obvious the big guy
can't take much more of this.

00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,041
We can't have Droy
holding us back ...

131
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:19,166
If we really want to succeed
we need a powerful teammate.

132
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,708
How mean...

133
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,000
So who's this
"powerful teammate"?

134
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:26,416
A man with an iron will,
and an equally iron head.

ask for a nicer day,

I'm sure the family
I raise with my dear Gray

you like to push her next?

00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,166
I'm here.

150

[LYON] I'm here...
and just as well, I say.

151
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,375
You shouldn't be going
on such a perilous journey

152
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,750
by yourselves.

153
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,125
So you're just
worried about us, huh?

154
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,791
[LYON] Yeah, that
works... Sure.

155
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,583
[GRAY] Thanks, but we're fine.

156
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,416
I'm not convinced of that...
So I'll stick around.

157
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,666
Seriously, why're
you here, Lyon?!

158
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,375
No fair...

159
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,250
Why couldn't we walk
like the other teams?

160
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,958
I guess a tiny
tummy gets motion sick

00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,333
just like a big one.

162
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,791
Are you all
right, Natsu?

163
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,875
Oh, yeah, never better.

164
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,166
This is lame...
and embarrassing.

165
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,958
Now that you mention it,
our whole team is pretty lame.

166
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,375
[MICHELLE] What do
you mean by that?

167
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,208
Look at us, we've got a
shrunken sicko, a blonde bimbo,

168
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,791
a goody-two-shoes,
and a little kid!

169
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,208
[HAPPY] If we run
into any trouble...

170
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,208
like say, those
Legion Platoon guys...

171
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,083
I'm gonna be the only one
who's able to put up a fight!

172
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,500
See what I mean...?

173
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,833
I just don't know
what Erza was thinkin'.

174
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,250
I may be little, but
I can still fight!

175
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,000
I'd let it go
if I were you...

176
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:27,333
I think it's pretty obvious that
I'm the powerhouse around here.

177
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:36,750
[LUCY] "Towards chaos"...
But why would anybody want that?

178
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:41,958
[MAN] Excuse me... Might
you be members of Fairy Tail?

179
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,333
Yes, that's
correct, sir.

180
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,958
Whoa...! Huge waterfall!

181
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,500
Thank goodness...!
I'm so thirsty!

182
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,041
[gasps]

183
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,791
[LEVY] Over there!

184
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:11,625
Gajeel...?

185
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:12,958
What's he doing?

186
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,291
Maybe he's
bathing... for once.

187
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:19,250
Isn't it obvious?
He's training.

188
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,291
[calling] Gajeel!

189
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,416
Get lost...!

190
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,250
Can't see you see
I'm busy here?

191
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,708
[PANTHERLILY screams]

192
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,791
[GAJEEL grunts]

193
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,166
Why? Why'd it have
to be thunder?!

194
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,416
He's crazy! What kinda
training is that?!

195
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,291
[JET] With that guy,
who knows?

196
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,000
Use your eyes, kids...

197
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:47,166
I'm getting' used to being hit
by a waterfall and lightning!

198
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,250
Now scram!

199
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,083
Just one would've
been enough.

200
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,083
I... I'll train
with you!

201
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,708
[thunder]

202
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,208
[PANTHERLILY whimpers]

203
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,583
No... I can
stand up to this fear!

204
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,000
Get up here, furball!

205
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,333
[PANTHERLILY] Right!

206
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,875
Wasn't the whole point of
comin' up here to fetch him?

207
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,333
There are things
in this world that a man

208
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,750
must learn to conquer,
no matter what!

209
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,416
It looks like we're gonna
be here for a while...

210
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,166
So let's get comfy.

211
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,833
Now this is
a mission.

212
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,166
Yeah, I feel like we're
experiencing the same things

213
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,666
as the girl
in the story.

214
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,708
And what makes
you say that?

215
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,833
She ended up traveling
all over the world

216
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,375
in order to find
the different keys...

217
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,500
[WENDY] I'd imagine her journey
was as carefree as this...

218
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,833
And naïve...

219
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,750
Don't forget that in
achieving her own happiness,

220
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,000
the girl brought misfortune
to everyone around her

221
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,166
and plunged the
world into chaos.

222
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,791
Yeah, good point.

223
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,125
Well lucky for us,
we're all very mature.

224
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,708
[laughs]

225
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,041
[ERZA] My friends.

226
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,333
Won't you join
me for a moment?

227
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:04,333
[confused gasps]

228
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,750
My... It certainly
is lovely here!

229
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,291
Great for a picnic!

230
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,166
You're joking, right?

231
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,666
[ERZA] I've always
dreamed of having one...

232
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,375
A picnic.

233
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,166
[CANA] Um, okaaay... But how
is this gonna help us

234
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,833
find the keys?

235
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,333
What will fill our
bellies and boost our morale...?

236
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,708
A picnic!

237
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,500
But if we stop to have
one, the Legion Platoon

238
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,000
might find a clock
piece before us!

239
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,208
Don't worry; I've thought
all of it through...

240
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,958
We can have one picnic and
still remain ahead of them...

241
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:38,208
It's a simple matter
of calculation. [sighs]

242
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,875
But I will admit
the thought of staying here

243
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,916
for days on end is appealing.

244
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,583
Yummy.

245
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:45,500
She's losing it...

246
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,458
She "lost it"
a long time ago.

247
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,000
Yeah, you can
say that again.

248
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,041
[stampede]

249
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,250
Hey, hey, hey!

250
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:56,166
Who gave you ladies permission
to have a picnic here?!

251
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,250
Who? No one...

252
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,625
You're trespassin'
on our grassland!

253
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:06,416
We can't have people picnicking
here any time they want!

254
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,250
Is it me, or is
everyone really focused

255
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,208
on picnics out here?

256
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,500
Are those... horses?

257
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:17,041
[ERZA] Hold on, let me make
sure I understand you...

258
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,625
It's illegal for us
to have a picnic

259
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:21,083
on this grassland just
because you say so?

260
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:21,833
Hm?

261
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:22,916
Hey, hey, hey...

262
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,208
these trespassers
are with Fairy Tail!

263
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,833
Word has it your
guild has been lookin'

264
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,541
for some kinda legendary
treasure lately.

265
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,583
Hey, hey, hey! This is
our lucky day, boys!

266
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,083
Let's take their treasure...
and their food!

00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,375
[laugh]

268
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,041
How did the word
get out already?

269
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,958
I would assume that
wretched Legion Platoon

270
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,833
is to blame... They're
trying to get in our way.

271
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,666
Hey, hey, hey! This
food is tasty! Eat up!

272
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,416
Perfect timing! I thought
I was gonna starve!

273
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,125
[BANDIT A]
Let's try some of this.

274
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,500
Nothin' like
free food! Yum!

275

[furious]

276

[ERZA] I'll never forgive you!

277
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,291
This was the very
first picnic of my life!

Uh oh!

those poor fools.

Well, I'm not
gonna try to stop her!

283
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,125
Say your prayers!

284
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,625
[quietly] I feel so
torn about this...

285
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,041
No one could steal
me from my love-cicle...

286
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,166
but... wait...

287
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,083
Making Gray jealous
could help intensify

288
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,250
his feelings for me.

289
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,416
If that happened, it would
be... so... worth... ♪ it ♪!

290
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,750
Alright, Lyon,
spill it.

291
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,041
Why're you tagging
along with us?

292
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,166
Because this task is
going to require a certain

293
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,416
amount of finesse,
which you sorely lack.

294
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
What...?! No way!

295
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,333
Please, asking you to
handle this would be like

296
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:59,125
asking Natsu not to
demolish something.

297
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,708
[LYON] The fact is,
you've been out of the game

298
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,916
for seven years. Anyone would
be rusty after that long.

299
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,541
Trust me, you need me
much more than you realize.

300
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,375
[GRAY] What, do you think
I was on vacation...?

301
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,083
We were inside
a seal, ya moron!

302
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,791
Time didn't pass
for us at all...

303
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,541
So how the hell can I be rusty?

304
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,041
I know I'm hopelessly
devoted my dear Gray...

305
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,291
But if our relationship is
to take this kind of turn,

306
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,208
then who am I to stand in the
way of love's great wisdom?

307
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,833
It's so... ♪ won-der-ful ♪!

308
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,916
Not even Natsu has said crap
like that to me before!

309
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,291
Are you lookin'
for a fight?!

310
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,000
You've got a hot temper
for an ice wizard...

311
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:34,041
I suppose I should expect as
much from a pathetic child.

312
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,250
Yeah...?

313
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,625
Well, this "child" can
knock your teeth in!

314
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,875
I'll take you on
some other time.

315
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,333
Right now, finding the remaining
clock pieces is my priority...

00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,916
Leave everything to me.

317
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,416
You know...?! Hold on,
where'd you hear about that?

318
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,750
Who hasn't
heard it?

319
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:53,125
Oh my...! It's
all so tantalizing!

320
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,541
[GRAY] This is way more
trouble than it's worth...

321
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,833
Next time, I'm gonna
pick my own team.

322
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,833
[ELFMAN] Makin' manly stew!

323
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:04,875
[hums]

324
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,208
Nothing like the
outdoors to make

325
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,291
a home cooked meal
taste even better!

326
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:12,458
Yeah! You bet! Spoken
like a real man, Mira!

327
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:13,791
Uh, Sis?

328
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,500
[LISANNA] I'm not sure this
spot was such a good choice...

329
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,041
Oh...? Why?

330
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,666
It's 'bout ready!

331
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,166
[nervous laugh]

332
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,250
Actually, we're members
of a prestigious

333
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,208
archaeological society...

334
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,291
Oh, so you're
archaeologists?

335
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,666
[ARCHAEOLOGIST A] Indeed...

336
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,708
And we're here because
we've heard that Fairy Tail

337
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,583
is searching for pieces
of a legendary clock...

338
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,375
Is this true?

339
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,958
Excuse me, may I ask
where you heard that?

340
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,041
Now, now...

341
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,125
I hardly think
that matters, missy.

342
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,333
Leave it to the
rumor mill, huh?

343
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,708
No, It can't be!

344
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,291
There must be a traitor in
the ranks of Fairy Tail!

345
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,625
How ya figure that?

346
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,041
[MICHELLE] The legion platoon
is a super secret organization;

347
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,041
barely anyone
knows they even exist...

348
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,416
I'm sure they wouldn't
let word slip out.

349
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,875
If that's the case...

350
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,291
somebody inside the guild
must have leaked it!

351
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,666
No way that's
what happened!

352
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,708
I haven't gotten to know
everybody in the guild yet,

353
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,791
so I'm not sure what to
think of them...! So sorry!

354
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,166
I'm dyin' here!

355
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,500
Quit whinin', ya big baby!
You're sick all the time!

356
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,250
We've got bigger things to
worry about than your stomach!

357
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,416
You were sayin'?

358
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,958
Yes, well, actually...

359
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,166
we'd very much appreciate it if
you would put a halt to this

360
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,750
little adventure of yours.

361
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:30,833
[LUCY] How come?!

362
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:31,833
[HAPPY] Geez, quit
saying "actually"!

363
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,458
According to the
data we've gathered,

364
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,291
the pieces have been scattered
around the world in shrines,

365
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,083
ruins, and other
abandoned sites.

366
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,625
And, if I'm
not mistaken,

367
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,500
your guild is attempting
to collect all of them.

368
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,500
How the heck could you
possibly know that?

369
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,041
After years of
studying the

370
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,500
"Key of the Starry Heavens" from
an archaeological standpoint,

371
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,625
we now believe that there
is actually more to the book

372
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,583
than it would seem...
Understand?

373
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:54,666
No, not really.

374
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,291
But it's so simple!
Let me spell it out!

375
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,000
[JEAN-LUC] We have come to
the conclusion that the book

376
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:04,500
actually pinpoints several
important archaeological sites,

377
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,916
such as ancient ruins and
shrines, which pepper the globe.

378
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,250
You see, we have a theory
that the various places

379
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,541
where the girl goes searching
for the mystical keys

380
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:16,041
are actually modeled
after these important sites.

381
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,291
The ultimate goal of
our archaeological society

382
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,208
is to keep these sites
safe from harm...

383
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:23,958
They're remnants of our cultural
heritage and must be respected!

384
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,333
If you and your
friends just go

385
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,375
prancing around in
there all willy-nilly,

386
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,583
you could irreparably
damage a piece of history!

387
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,291
[ARCHAEOLOGIST B] Therefore,
if you would be so kind

388
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:35,708
as to forget about the clock,
we would greatly appreciate it.

389
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,250
Yes... We insist you forget.

390
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,458
You've gotta
be kiddin' me...

391
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,750
I figured that out when I read
the "Key of the Starry Heavens"

392
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:45,958
as a little kid.

393
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,375
I can't believe
it took you so long!

394
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,875
[gasps]

395
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,708
Oh wow! You're a lot
smarter than you look, Lucy.

396
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,458
I'd shut up
if I were you.

397
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,666
Lucy?

398
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,583
[screams]

399
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,041
Oh man! She's really
going overboard...

400
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,208
Should we stop her?

401
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,750
Sure, go ahead. I'll
be right behind you.

402
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:12,541
[CARLA] All of this nonsense
over a silly picnic... Really!

403
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,208
[screams]

404
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,458
[ERZA] As long as I live...

405
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,750
I will never forgive you!

406
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:22,500
[screams]

407
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:26,416
[crash]

408
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,583
[GRAY] This is it.

409
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,291
[LYON] Ruins?

410
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,541
Lucy said it's
somewhere inside...

411
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,458
But If we're not careful
we could end up buried

412
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,125
along with the clock piece.

413
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:45,541
So... how are we supposed
to get inside the place?

414
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,083
No clue.

415
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,833
Then why are
you even here?!

416
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,291
Listen to me, please!

417
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,791
It's imperative you
forget about the clock!

418
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,875
I can't just forget
about it, okay?!

419
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,166
That must be nice.

420
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,291
I understand the ruins
are important...

421
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,958
but I'm fulfilling
my father's dying wish!

422
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:12,166
[LUCY] My dad waited...
For seven long years...

423
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,958
He waited for me.

424
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,500
He believed I could
keep the world

425
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,166
from plunging into chaos!

426
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,291
He left the task
to me, his daughter,

427
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,541
and nobody else!

428
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,291
He believed
in me to the end!

429
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,583
That's why I can't forget,

430
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,625
'cause I don't
wanna let him down!

431
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,458
Lucy is so brave.

432
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,375
Actually... you see...

433
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,375
That was the most moving speech
I've ever heard in my life!

434
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,583
Um-hmm.

435
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:44,833
It's touching to see

436
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,333
a youngster with such
devotion to her family.

437
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,500
[screams]

438
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:54,541
No, Natsu!

439
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:55,375
He fell in!

440
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,166
He's gonna drown!

441
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,333
What'll we do?!

442
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,958
[JEAN-LUC] Any friend of
Lucy Heartfilia's actually

443
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,208
a friend of ours, you see?!

444
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,375
And we always
help our friends out!

445
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,625
I think I'm gonna hurl!

446
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,458
Even the waves
make him sick?!

447
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,916
[JEAN-LUC] Heave, ho!

448
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,458
[ARCHAEOLOGISTS] Back you go!

449
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,041
I'm big again!

450
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,916
But how?!

451
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,250
[JEAN-LUC]
That was us, actually!

452
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,041
We happen to know
a little magic ourselves!

453
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,166
Lucy Heartfilia's
story touched our hearts

454
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,958
and inspired us, you see...

455
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,833
So we returned
you to normal...!

456
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,750
Think of it as a
thank you from our society.

457
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,791
Cool! Thanks
a lot, old man!

458
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,625
We wish you luck
on your journey!

459
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,000
Our hearts go with you!

460
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:51,291
Stop at nothing, and fulfill
your father's last wish!

461
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,416
You bet I will!

462
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:02,791
[NATSU gags]

463
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,708
We're still on the boat...

464
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,916
[laughs]

465
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,500
[ARCHAEOLOGIST B] That
was certainly a surprise...

466
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,916
[ARCHAEOLOGIST C] She's got
the Heartfilia stubbornness.

467
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,750
[ARCHAEOLOGIST A]
Indeed she does; unfortunately,

468
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:19,541
that means she'll end up
reaching it sooner or later.

469
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,750
[ARCHAEOLOGIST B] Was it
truly wise to let her go...

470
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,666
Jean-Luc?

471
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,708
What a curious coincidence...

472
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:27,125
Quite.

473
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:31,000
However... I'm afraid
as things are now,

474
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,166
Jude's daughter will find
what she's looking for.

475
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:37,583
[NATSU] This can't be
the right place, you guys...

476
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:40,875
I mean, look...
There's nothin' here!

477
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:46,916
♪

478
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,041
[NATSU] Well, at least
I don't have to worry

479
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:15,166
about vehicles anymore...

480
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,791
but what's with
this crazy maze?!

481
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:19,083
[HAPPY] Guess this job won't
be as easy as we thought.

482
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,291
[NATSU] That's for sure...
Ah well, anything less

483
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,250
wouldn't be satisfying!
Right lil' buddy?

484
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:25,041
[HAPPY] As long as
you don't slow us down.

485
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:26,208
[NATSU] Whatchu talkin' about?

486
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:27,791
I'm the one who's
always blazing ahead!

487
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:30,291
[HAPPY] Wow... Delusional much?

488
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:33,041
[HAPPY and NATSU] Next time:
Labyrinth Capriccio!

489
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,416
[NATSU] Whatever!
Without me this group

490
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,833
would be totally screwed!

491
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:37,500
[HAPPY] Someone's got
a swollen-head...

492
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:40,833
[NATSU] Whoa, what? My head's
swollen?! Make it go back!
