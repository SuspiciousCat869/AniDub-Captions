00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,791
What's wrong? Do
you need some help?

158
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,458
[WAKABA] You better
get back in bed and rest.

159
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,541
That strange
look in her eyes...

160
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:14,708
[KINANA] We've wasted...
too much time already...

161
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,291
Let's move...

162
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:24,666
Power from misery. The
sorrow that consumes my soul...

163
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,458
is the only thing
still driving me forward.

164
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,791
[MICHELLE] Kinana, stop!

165
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,083
[KINANA] The pain can only
end... When the world...

166
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,083
itself ends...

167
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,583
My lord. The Legion Platoon

168
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,625
is here as you requested.

169
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,208
I've summoned you
here for but one reason...

170
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,166
To inform you that your power
will be considerably greater

171
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,250
as of today.

172
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,833
You mean, like,
we're gonna be getting

173
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,083
a couple of new members on
the team or something?!

174
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,000
Is that it?

175
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,083
Yes. The archbishop
himself has

176
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:57,375
requested this addition.
Just one member.

177
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,750
Handpicked from an
extremely select group.

178
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,416
Great Zentopia Prison's
"Forbidden Cell".

179
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,791
What kind of person
are we dealing with here?

180
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:19,416
[heavy, metallic clanging]

181
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,416
He's... a demon.

182
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,708
What in the heck
is that thing?!

183
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,541
I don't know. But... he's,
like, not even human!

184
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:32,166
[GUTMAN] Hey there gang!
Ol' Gutman Kubrick

185
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,958
is here and ready to play!

186
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,000
[MARY] He's totally
inside my head!

187
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,291
[BYRO] It's telepathy.

188
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,416
[DAN] And he
sounds so bizarre!

189
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:45,333
[GUTMAN roars]

190
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,291
[GUTMAN] That doesn't
hurt a big boy like me!

191
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,875
Gutman Kubrick is the
master of Rupture Magic.

192
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,375
His power is known
throughout Fiore.

193
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,291
They call him,
Gutman the Cleaner.

194
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,833
[GUTMAN] Sorry...
That was kinda rude of me.

195
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,041
This thing...

196
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,708
will be joining my
beloved Legion Platoon?

197
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,500
Indeed he is, whether
you like it or not.

198
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,166
[growls]

199
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,083
[footsteps]

200
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,333
[GILDARTS] Yep, this is
one big farm, all right...

201
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,458
Nothing but fields and pastures
as far as the eye can see.

202
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,666
The days of growing
crops are over.

203
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,416
They've withered on the
vine much like those

204
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,791
who once worked this land...
It would be a distant memory,

205
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:32,250
that is, if there were
anyone left to remember.

206
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,583
Now, this once majestic
estate is nothing more than

207
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,166
a window into the past.

208
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,791
[GILDARTS] So,
long story short...

209
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,500
What you're sayin' is,
it's been a while since

210
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:41,958
anybody lived here.

211
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,125
This is the place
where Michelle grew up.

212
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,291
The Lobster Family Plantation.

213
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,458
[GILDARTS] On the other hand...

214
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:54,250
Time has been very kind to
you over the past few years,

215
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,500
if you know what I'm saying.

216
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,125
[LAKI] I know exactly
what you're saying,

217
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,708
and I'm going to tell
Cana you said that.

218
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,583
[GILDARTS] Aw, c'mon!
I was just trying to pay you

219
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:01,750
a compliment.

220
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,375
[BYRO] So the Oración
Seis were the ones

221
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,375
behind the church attacks.
Are you absolutely sure of this,

222
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:15,791
your eminence?

223
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,875
[LAPOINTE] I am. And although
their ultimate objective

224
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,041
remains a mystery to
us, it is fair to assume

225
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,083
these blasphemous
acts will continue.

226
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,500
[grumble]

227
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,375
Uhhh... If you don't mind
me asking a small favor.

228
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,708
Dan!

229
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,208
You have a request?
Please share.

230
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,791
If we're able to stop
the Oración Seis,

231
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,000
in return, will you
let Coco out of jail?

232
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,333
I mean, we know going
against church doctrine is,

233
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,583
like, totally a
major big deal.

234
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,416
[MARY] But Coco has been a part
of Zentopia her whole life.

235
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
The church
practically raised her!

236
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,291
Seriously, If you
can forgive her,

237
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:52,375
I know she'd be mega
useful to the archbishop.

238
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,833
We may consider it...
But that decision

239
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,750
hinges on you
completing this mission.

240
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,250
[GUTMAN] Turn that
frown upside down...!

241
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,916
You kids have your best
buddy Gutman with you now!

242
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,416
So don't worry your
silly widdle heads.

243
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,375
Everything's gonna
be just peachy.

244
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,958
Quit talking to us
like children, would ya?

245
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,166
[MALE SOLDIER D]
Your Eminence.

246
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,125
[LAPOINTE] If you'll excuse
me, I'm afraid something

247
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,791
rather urgent has come up.

248
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,708
[LAPOINTE] I apologize
for the wait.

249
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,375
[LAHAR] Cardinal Lapointe.

250
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,583
[LAPOINTE] You're with

251
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,333
the Magic Council's
Custody Enforcement Unit.

252
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,208
What can I help you with today?

253
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:38,375
This matter concerns
members of the Oración Seis...

254
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:41,125
Namely those who we had in
custody until recently.

255
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,625
I'm sure word of their
escape has reached you.

256
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:49,083
There is one small point
of fact I'd like to confirm...

257
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:52,208
While they were incarcerated, it
seems that a certain individual

258
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,583
from your organization paid
them visits on a somewhat

259
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,958
regular basis.

260
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,416
It's possible he was
connected to the break-out.

261
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,833
[LAPOINTE] I won't stand for
such baseless accusations.

262
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,958
The prison break was
solely the Council's blunder.

263
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:09,500
Placing blame on our sacred
institution is an outrage.

264
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,000
The very thought of
it is offensive.

265
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,291
You're on
dangerous ground.

266
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,083
Failure to tread
lightly here could lead

267
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,166
to serious repercussions.

268
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,833
[LAHAR] That was unsettling...
His attitude makes it clear

269
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,083
that something
sinister is afoot.

270
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,416
I'm going to need
some help from an old friend.

271
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,791
[MAX] What does all this mean?

272
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,166
[WENDY] Does anybody know
what the writing says?

273
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,875
[CARLA] Her mumblings strike
me as particularly ominous.

274
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:43,125
Piece to the puzzle...
and then we can open up

275
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,500
the gates of hell.

276
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,458
Do you think maybe
she's finally remembering

277
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,041
something from her past?

278
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,416
Yeah, maybe...
Now that you mention it,

279
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,416
it seems like it was
bothering her a lot lately.

280
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,708
[LUCY] Before she came to
Fairy Tail, Kinana was under

281
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,333
some kind of curse.

282
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:58,375
[MICHELLE] Poor thing.

283
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:01,125
Hey... This is
ancient Potamelian!

284
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,416
[WAKABA] This stuff too?

285
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,541
[MACAO] Just like
on the clock hand!

286
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,250
How strange... It appears
to be a description

287
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,000
of a man named Will Neville.

288
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,500
Are you serious?

289
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,958
He's the author of
"Key of the Starry Heavens".

290
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,250
[HAPPY and NATSU] Huh?!

291
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,416
Okay... This is a
pretty rough translation...

292
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,708
But It says, "Will Neville
was once a great wizard

293
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,583
who made contracts with
many Celestial Spirits and

294
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,583
was remarkably skilled
in using them."

295
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,708
Contracts with
Celestial Spirits?

296
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,041
So he was both an author
and a Celestial wizard

297
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,833
to boot... Interesting.

298
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,250
And It goes
on to say... "In life,

299
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,666
Will Neville had
numerous followers.

300
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,458
However, after he fell
into his eternal slumber,

301
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:44,166
his pupils scattered in all
directions to places unknown."

302
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,083
What's that for?

303
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,458
I think it can help us.

304
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,916
It's a biographical
encyclopedia. Let's see...

305
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,583
Here it is!

306
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:58,458
[LUCY] "Will Neville...
An author... and a cardinal...

307
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,916
of Zentopia?"

308
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,375
So he was a bird?

309
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,833
A cardinal is a high-ranking
church official.

310
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,375
Uh... According
to this, he was a very

311
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,833
dedicated and prominent
member of the church.

312
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,875
He was also the most
extensive researcher

313
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,250
on Zentopia's history.

314
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,583
That is... until
the day he suddenly left

315
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,958
the church and went missing
for quite a long time.

316
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,250
Does it explain
why he left?

317
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,416
[LUCY] No, it doesn't.

318
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,208
But apparently, several
years after he disappeared,

319
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,916
he re-emerged into the
public eye as Will Neville,

320
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,708
the author of
children's literature.

321
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,125
But there's no
mention of him being

322
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,833
a Celestial wizard in here...
Or that he had any kind

323
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,166
of following.

324
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,375
[MAX] This whole thing
is freaking me out.

325
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,083
I don't understand how
Kinana would know stuff

326
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,000
about him that's not
in the encyclopedia.

327
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,541
And how in the heck does
she know how to write

328
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,375
in that weird
ancient language?

329
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,416
I remember the captain
of the Legion Platoon

330
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,416
said that the Infinity Clock
was the property of Zentopia.

331
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,125
And a prominent former
member of that church

332
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,291
also wrote the "Key of
the Starry Heavens"...

333
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,583
The book your father used
to pass on his message about

334
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,708
how to find the
clock pieces.

335
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,416
[NATSU] I can't
stand it anymore!

336
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,875
What in the heck are we gonna
do about all of this crap?

337
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,458
I say we head out right
now, find this Milk Devil guy

338
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,125
and beat the ever-lovin'
snot outta him!

339
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,583
Will Neville has been
dead for a long time!

340
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,583
Leave the thinkin'
to the grownups!

341
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,500
[JUVIA] Don't back down,
my darling Gray!

342
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,833
If we could somehow figure
out where the Oración Seis

343
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,791
was going to strike next,
we could be waiting there

344
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:19,875
to ambush them.

345
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,625
Ugh, would ya
keep it down?

346
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,333
I'm trying to get
my beauty sleep.

347
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,708
Dontcha think it's a
little late for that, Cana?

348
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,791
You've practically
been asleep all day!

349
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,375
Yeah, but I just
can't seem to wake up

350
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:35,416
for some reason,
y'know? Now...

351
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,625
do you boys and girls wanna
find the Oración Seis, or what?

352
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,541
That's right! You
can use your fortunetelling!

353
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,250
Oh, you bet I can!

354
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,583
[MALE SOLDIER E] Don't
give up your ground, men!

355
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:48,916
[MALE SOLDIER F]
Archers, ready!

356
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,416
Release!

357
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:56,166
Too slow. Way too
slow. [chuckles]

358
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,708
[gasp]

359
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,708
The storm grows stronger now,

360
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,291
as lightning rips
through the clouds!

361
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,250
[JACKPOT] Slot Magic! I
think we've got another winner

362
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,916
on our hands! Holy cow,
would ya look at that?

363
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,250
Lightning bonus!
Talk about a hot payoff!

364
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,958
It's silent...
There are no more vessels

365
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,208
to be found in this
part of the country.

366
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,916
[ANGEL] Time is running
out very quickly...

367
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,791
And we will do whatever
we can to speed it forward.

368
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,500
[COBRA] I'd be willing
to do more if they would

369
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,250
bring her back to me.

370
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:30,166
[ANGEL] Now, now Cobra...
You mustn't forget that

371
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,000
our orders come first.

372
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,833
[ROMEO] There we go, all
set! You think that's gonna

373
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,458
work for ya?

374
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:41,500
It's Perfect! Now I'll
divine where the Oración Seis

375
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:44,375
will attack next. And,
which of us are gonna go there

376
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,708
and throw them a nice,
little surprise party!

377
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:51,750
I see it!

378
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,875
So that's all it takes, huh?

379
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,041
Um-hmm.

380
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,625
[CANA] That's it.
If we send these teams

381
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,000
to these locations...
We can stop the attacks

382
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,333
and save some lives.

383
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,250
[NATSU] Cool! So tell
us who's working with who,

384
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,666
and where we're goin'!

385
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,166
[MWithout further ado...
The first is a two-man team...

386
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,958
Composed of Gray and Fried!

387
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,166
How interesting. I've
often wondered if our

388
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,458
magic styles might
complement each other.

389
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,625
I gotta admit, I've
wondered that myself.

390
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,541
Your Enchantments and
my Ice Maker Magic could

391
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,750
be a pretty awesome
combination!

392
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,666
Next up! We've got
Erza and Evergreen!

393
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,750
Let's just hope
that they'll be able

394
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,208
to get along for once.

395
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,958
Yeah, no kidding;
Evergreen's always treated

396
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,666
Erza like they're in
some kinda competition.

397
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,166
Oh... You too, Max.

398
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,416
I'm on their team?!

399
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,791
This is fabulous.
Now we can finally settle

400
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,541
the matter once and for all.

401
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,375
We'll see who is worthy of the
"Queen of the Fairies" title!

402
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,000
The goal of our
mission is to track down

403
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,916
the Oración Seis, but
I'll gladly take you on

404
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,916
anytime after that.

405
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,500
Now, ladies, remember
we have to work together

406
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:56,166
as a team. Let's try our
best to get along. Okay?

407
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,458
[MACAO] The next team
is Gajeel and Juvia!

408
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,166
Both ex-Phantom Lord
guild members working

409
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,291
on the same team?

410
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,416
Oh no! Why must
I and my darling Gray

411
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,291
be kept apart yet again?!
Why must fate continue to be

412
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,541
so incredibly cruel to us?!

413
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,750
Next up...
Bixlow and... Wendy!

414
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,333
Alright little lady
this is gonna be

415
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,833
a real blast!
I am psyched!

416
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,291
Yeah... I'm looking
forward to working with you.

417
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:19,583
We'll be a great team!

418
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,791
Sweet! And don't
you forget that my babies

419
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,916
are gonna be on
the team with us!

420
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,458
[TOMMENS] Go team!

421
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,500
Alright! This one's
got Happy, Carla,

422
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:28,541
and Pantherlily!

423
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,541
Aye! The Exceed Squad

424
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,083
is back together again!

425
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,875
Well, aside from Lily...
I'm not entirely sure

426
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,375
we would fare well against
such a powerful enemy.

427
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:38,875
And, for the last team!

428
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,541
It's Natsu, Lucy,
Elfman, and Michelle!

429
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:42,583
So let's go!

430
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,333
We're the only
four-person team?

431
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,041
This is great!
We're together!

432
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,625
I couldn't have picked a
better teammate than you!

433
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,666
And that's all!
Hey! Does this mean

434
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,250
I gotta stay
behind again?!

435
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,541
[ROMEO] Aw, man! I wish
I was goin' with you guys!

436
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,041
[JUVIA] There must be
some way you and I can be

437
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,333
on a team together!
Gajeel, you have to switch

438
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,083
with him right this instant!

439
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:04,291
No way... My Divination
magic told me this was

440
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,000
the best pairing for the
mission that you've been given.

441
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,375
In that case,
why don't you just let me

442
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,125
switch places with
Fried instead?!

443
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,000
Because that's
the same thing.

444
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,583
I don't think I can
even remember a time

445
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,083
when you and I haven't been
on a team together, Natsu.

446
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,041
Oh crap! What the
heck am I gonna do

447
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,833
if I need to fly around?!

448
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,625
[COCO] Really...? So
you're a survivor from

449
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:26,000
one of those horrible
church attacks?

450
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,125
[MALE PRIEST A] Yes, and
soon after that happened I

451
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,000
went into hiding for a while.

452
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,708
But then they found me...

453
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,666
and put me in
this prison cell.

454
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,500
I don't understand
why you were imprisoned

455
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,166
after what you've
been through.

456
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,625
[MALE PRIEST A]
I was in their crosshairs for

457
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:42,208
two reasons. First, because
I am the parish priest...

458
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,583
And second...

459
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,666
I refuse to tell
Cardinal Lapointe what

460
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,791
he wants to know. So he'll
interrogate or silence me.

461
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,958
But what do you
mean by that?

462
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:55,000
[footsteps]

463
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:58,625
[LAPOINTE] You filthy traitor.
At last, we finally meet.

464
00:21:58,708 --> 00:21:59,500
[MALE PRIEST A]
