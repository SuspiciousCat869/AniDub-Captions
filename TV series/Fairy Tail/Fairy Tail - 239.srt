1
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:21,500
[NATSU]
Cowards!

2
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:23,708
Calm down!
The house didn't do it!

3
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:26,208
Plus, it belongs to that
big-shot former chairman!

4
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:27,458
It's the former chairman

5
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:29,916
who's been workin'
with Tartaros, Happy.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Then he's the reason whole
reason we're in this mess!

7
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:35,291
Mira and Erza came to help him,
they didn't have a clue!

8
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:38,333
In that case, he probably
caught 'em by surprise.

9
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:40,083
[NATSU]
Yeah, but we're gonna find 'em.

10
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:43,375
Nothin' stops a
Dragon Slayer's nose!

11
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,083
[CRAWFORD]
How dare they vandalize

12
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,125
the home of their Chairman!

13
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:49,416
[FRANMALTH]
Yes well technically,

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,750
you're their former chair--

15
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,583
[CRAWFORD] I got a pension
from the council before

16
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:55,041
I helped you destroy it,
now that's gone with my home!

17
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:57,875
Pension? You're about
to have more jewel

18
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:01,625
than even you could find
a way to spend. [laughs]

19
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:04,541
I suppose I can always say
that Tartaros destroyed it.

20
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:07,500
Make sure the firebug's
too dead to contradict me.

21
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:09,791
Then they'll really think
I've been kidnapped.

22
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,125
Speaking of, how are
my prisoners?

23
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,791
[FRANMALTH] Lady Kyoka's
begun her torture process.

24
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,958
They'll have a
gruesome end, no doubt.

25
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,916
Make sure they die. If those
two were to escape somehow

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,166
and speak of what I've done
for you, I'd lose my shot

27
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,500
at becoming Chairman again!

28
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,000
You can rest easy.
They aren't going anywhere.

29
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:27,208
And on top of that,

30
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,458
no one's ever gonna
find us in this place.

31
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,500
Say, what is that thing?

32
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:35,708
[nervous laughing]

33
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:39,916
It's headed right for us!

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,458
Aaah!

35
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,625
You just said that no
one would find us here!

36
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:46,458
Well, no one's found us before!

37
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:50,208
Where the hell are my friends?!

38
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,625
[gasps]

39
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,708
[LUCY]
Natsu!

40
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,375
It's Lucy and Wendy!

41
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,625
Can you hear us?

42
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:49,000
Anyone here?
Please say something!

43
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:52,083
Happy?!
Where did you go?

44
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,250
[LUCY] It looks like
Tartaros beat us here.

45
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,875
You think they were
waiting for Erza and Mira?

46
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,083
I hate to say it, but I'm
afraid that those two

47
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,416
may have been captured.

48
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,833
Hey Wendy.

49
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,625
Do you think you can track
'em down by their scents?

50
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,375
I'll give it a try.

51
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:09,000
[sniffing]

52
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:13,125
Natsu... Please be okay.

53
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,875
[stuttering]

54
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,625
What'd you do with
Erza and Mira?!

55
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,083
Why would I tell you?

56
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:31,000
You just busted a wyvern-sized
hole in my ceiling!

57
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,541
This fortress is made of
imported Pergrande Gneiss!

58
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,458
It costs so much!

59
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,791
Someone's making a fuss.

60
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,791
[KYOKA]
Yakdoriga.

61
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:57,375
[YAKDORIGA growls]

62
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
[KYOKA]
Keep an eye on this one.

63
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:07,333
I'm going to check on the boys
upstairs. Don't touch her, yet.

64
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,875
If I let you at her now,
I wouldn't get to see her break.

65
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,666
[YAKDORIGA growls]

66
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,125
[NATSU]
Don't make me ask again.

67
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,500
The new prisoners?

68
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:33,041
Well with so many torture
chambers to choose from,

69
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,791
you're better off
listening for screams

70
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,208
than asking me. He, he, he.

71
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,125
[HAPPY] Guess he wants
to do this the hard way!

72
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,583
[FRANMALTH] I'm quite curious
as to how you found us.

73
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,458
Wait, wait, don't tell me.

74
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,541
You followed old
Crawford didn't you?

75
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,416
What a fool! How much'll
this mistake cost us?!

76
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,583
Does no one else care
about the finances?!

77
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,708
[NATSU]
I'm sick of hearin' your crap!

78
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,541
[FRANMALTH screams]

79
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,250
We're almost back to the guild.

80
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,375
Then, I'm heading out to one
of those new addresses,

81
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,291
but you're more than
free to come along.

82
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,000
I'll go with you.

83
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:20,458
I don't think I've ever been
this scared of a fight before.

84
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:28,583
[GRAY] You saw a whole city
put to death for no reason.

85
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,208
That would scare anybody.

86
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,750
[JUVIA]
It's more than that.

87
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,208
What happened there was awful,

88
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,583
and I'm afraid what's
coming is worse.

89
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,250
[GRAY]
We'll be fine.

90
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,916
We'll win this war like
we've won all the others.

91
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,250
Count on it.

92
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,000
[grunts]

93
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,416
Now you've broken into my
home and assaulted me!

94
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,750
That was foolish.

95
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,958
Your criminal actions
are about to cost you!

96
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,250
Ka-ching!

97
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,291
Uh?

98
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:16,375
This court takes its
payment in souls!

99
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,500
Watch out, he's all stretchy!

100
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,541
[FRANMALTH laughs]

101
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,666
Connection.

102
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,833
[NATSU screams]

103
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,583
What are you doing?

104
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,583
Can't move... Too weak.

105
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:33,458
[HAPPY growls]

106
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,041
Someone get this monster off me!

107
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,958
[NATSU grunts]
Thanks, Happy.

108
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,291
Take that you toothy freak!

109
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,583
You're the only freak
I see around here!

110
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:48,666
[FRANMALTH yells]

111
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,916
[FRANMALTH groans]

112
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,166
[NATSU]
Fire Dragon!

113
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,583
Grip Strike!

114
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,750
[HAPPY]
H-heh...

115
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,125
[FRANMALTH]
Aah! Haha!

116
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:06,208
I've spent way too much on
my skin to let you ruin it!

117
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:10,333
Okay, Natsu just roasted that
guy's face at point-blank range.

118
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,916
How's he okay?

119
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,541
[SILVER]
Now cool down, Franmalth.

120
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,000
Take a break.

121
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,250
[SILVER]
I can handle things from here.

122
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,291
[gasps]

123
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,916
[SILVER] Do grab the
old guy before you go.

124
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,541
Want them for yourself, eh?

125
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,583
Hmph.

126
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,041
Well, I'll just leave
you to it, then.

127
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,291
I'd love to watch but the
chairman has some "work"

128
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,750
to attend to, if you
know what I mean.

129
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,750
You never did know
when to shut your mouth.

130
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,875
It's gettin' kinda
cold in here, isn't it?

131
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,875
Yeah. It's like the
place has frozen over.

132
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,458
A fire wizard.

133
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:54,958
You must be the man who melted
all that ice in Sun Village.

134
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,583
[NATSU] And you must be
the thing that froze it.

135
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,791
Thanks! I really owe you one.

136
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,500
I was mortified when I heard
the news, what a complete mess!

137
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,291
See, I could'a sworn that
dragon soul was a demon.

138
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:11,166
Ended up icing the whole
damn village just to kill it.

139
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,583
[NATSU]
Oh...

140
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,833
You smell an awful lot
like someone else I know.

141
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,208
[laughs] Hm?

142

00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:39,875
You should have never said
that name in my presence, kid.

147
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,583
[SOLDIER A] Have I
seen a cat around here?

148
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,500
What? Another one from Bosco?

149
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,291
[SOLDIER B] Nah, Franmalth
says it's from Fairy Tail.

Real Dangerous, too.

00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,875
[SOLDIER B]
Losin' my damn mind here.

I've gotta find the others.

Hang in there.

Welcome to your new home.

Whoa, it is! What happened?

Never thought they'd catch you.

[NATSU grunts]

So did they get you

No...

Well, I hope not,
I can't remember anything.

Erza and Mira have gotta
be somewhere around here.

186
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,166
Once we get out,
we'll need to find them.

187
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,791
They caught my sister and Erza?
I can't believe it.

188
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,875
In that case, they probly
have my brother after all.

189
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,541
They've been wiping out
our strongest members,

190
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,375
one after another. I used
to believe that we could

191
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:18,750
take on anybody... That was
before Tartaros came along.

We can beat anyone.
These jerks included.

193

But first, we gotta
get outta here.

But how? I mean,
we can't even use magic.

What's stoppin' us,
these handcuffs?

Yeah, I think so, I've
been trying to use takeover

So far, I haven't had any luck.

I've heard that you've

200

identified the men
body-linked to Face.

201

That and more.

202

The former chairman used
his archive magic for us.

203
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,666
I'm loathe to admit it,
but this was most helpful.

204
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,000
It does shrink our target list.

But what exactly do you
mean by "that and more"?

206
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:05,250
Two of the councilmen
identified are already dead.

207

We killed them before we
knew what they were.

And who is the last one?

209
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,291
[KYOKA]
Jellal Fernandes.

210
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:16,625
His pulse is the only thing that
stands between us and Face.

211
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,833
[SEILAH]
Face. What a horrible object.

212
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,541
Those humans were
fools to create it.

213
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,666
That they were, but mistakes
are meant to be exploited.

214
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,708
But of course.
Right as always.

215
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,291
How long do you think it
will take to find Jellal?

216
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,541
That depends on Erza.

217
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,083
[SEILAH]
I've always found you to be

218

quite gifted with your
powers of persuasion.

It was Brain who set us free.

Or so he led us to believe.

We were torn from our homes,
taught by your whips to curse

the world, and used
as his pawns.

was completely destroyed.

where the group was taken.

316
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,458
There has to be some way

317
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,833
of locating their
base of operations.

318
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,458
[HAPPY]
Me and Natsu found it!

319
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:02,333
[PANTHERLILY,LEVY]
Uh?!

320
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,541
[HAPPY]
Their base.

321
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,708
I know where it is,
we gotta go back! Ugh!

322
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:06,791
[LUCY]
Happy?

323
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,250
[HAPPY groans]

324
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,375
Erza and Mira got
captured because

325
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,166
that former chairman guy!
He's a traitor!

326
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,625
And me and Natsu, we followed
their trail and we busted into

327
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,000
their base, but Natsu, he-he-!

328
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,375
You need to calm down!

329
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,458
[HAPPY]
Aye.

330
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,833
[MAKAROV]
Inconceivable.

331
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,958
The former chairman of the magic
council has joined Tartaros?

332
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,875
[DROY] How could they've
taken Erza and Mira?

333
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:35,791
[JET]
Who knows?

334
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,416
There's one more thing.

335
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,541
You should never have

336
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,958
said that name in
my presence, kid.

337
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,291
[HAPPY]
Nevermind.

338
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,083
But they got Natsu.

339
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,083
I watched him get caught.

340
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,750
He was right in front of me.

341
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:53,166
I know I should've tried
to save him, but I didn't.

342
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,625
I ran.

343
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,208
Look, you did the only
thing that you could do.

344
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,833
Now just dry your tears
and tell us where he is.

345
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,791
[HAPPY] The base is on
this weird, blocky island.

346
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,958
And it floats around in the sky.

347
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,500
[MAKAROV]
It's moving?

348
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,083
[CANA] That'd make it impossible
for you to know where it is.

349
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,791
[LEVY] We don't have to
know the exact location.

350
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,333
If you could remember how you
got here we could figure it out.

351
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,958
Right, so I was flyin' to the
left, but it was right on my

352
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,708
nine o'clock and headin'
straight for noon, so uh...

353
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,083
Wait a second.

354
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,083
I think I heard one of their
soldiers mention Bosco.

355
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,083
Are you sure?

356
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,708
Then their base
must be somewhere

357
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,625
around the eastern border!

358
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,041
I can narrow it down
from there. No problem!

359
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,041
I'll try as hard as I can to
calculate Tartaros' route!

360
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,666
I promise that I won't
let you guys down!

361
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,000
[ALL]
All right!

362
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,875
[JET, Droy]
You can do this, Levy!

363
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,833
Now Happy, try to remember
everything you saw on your

364
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,750
way back here. Like landmarks,
and the position of the sun.

365
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,125
[HAPPY]
Kay, I'll try.

366
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,666
Everyone else, prepare
for the fight of your lives!

367
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,333
[All]
Yeah!

368
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:54,625
I'm a coward. Natsu needed
me and I left him behind.

369
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:58,083
That isn't true. You did your
very best to make sure we get

370
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,916
him back, everyone knows that.

371
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,375
Okay?

372
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,833
[HAPPY]
Aye.

373
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,416
[JET]
Elfman!

374
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,375
[DROY]
Hey, you're all right!

375
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,833
Wait, where's Lisanna?

376
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:18,041
My surprise for Fairy Tail.
It'll be delivered very soon.

377
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,000
Would this be that
poetic conclusion

378
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,041
you told me about earlier? Good.

379
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:25,250
Yes. [chuckles]

380
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,375
They'll be destroyed
before long.

381
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,708
And by one of their own.

382
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,166
Hey man, you and
Lisanna get split up?

383
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,791
You had us worried
for a minute there.

384
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,500
Nobody had heard from you.

385
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,166
[ELFMAN]
Lisanna's gone.

386
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,875
Captured by Tartaros.

387
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,916
[gasps]

388
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,166
No way.

389
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,291
They have her, too?

390
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,250
[ELFMAN]
They got to Master Yuri first.

391
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,291
They were waiting.

392
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,875
Hmm.

393
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,166
I failed.

394
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,916
I don't know what
else I coulda done.

395
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,750
Don't worry,
we'll get her back.

396
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:05,041
Elfman, we're already planning
an assault on Tartaros' base.

397
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,291
Lisanna's one of the
toughest girls I know.

398
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,708
She'll be okay until then.

399
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,000
[ELFMAN]
Yeah.

400
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,833
Stop tryin' to comfort him!

401
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,583
What kind of man would let these
monsters take his sister away?

402
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,125
Cana, stop!

403
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:20,000
I... I tried to help her, but...

404
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,041
[CANA]
But what? They outran you?

405
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,708
Like I'd buy that.
You transform into animals!

406
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,375
Hey! Get back here, coward!

407
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,583
That's enough, Cana! Lay off.

408
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,250
[ELFMAN]
No, I deserve it.

409
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:33,041
Forgive me, I just
need to get some rest.

410
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:39,458
This is wrong.
We never turn on each other.

411
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:42,625
Have you ever heard of
this thing called sympathy?

412
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,833
[CANA grunts]

413
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:51,041
[SEILAH] You can do as I say,
or I can make you wrap

414
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:54,500
your hand around your
sister's throat again.

415
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:58,125
Your task is both simple
and unforgivable.

416
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,750
Return to your Guildhall and

417
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,875
place this Lacrima
anywhere inside it.

418
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:06,875
Why? What will it do?

419
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:10,583
[SEILAH] It will emit a vast
amount of concentrated ether.

420
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:14,458
Imagine a Jupiter Blast,
times five hundred.

421
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,541
Don't worry, your guild
mates' deaths will be swift.

422
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,416
I won't do it!
You can't make me!

423
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,291
Shall I have you kill
your sister, then?

424
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,000
[ELFMAN]
No.

425
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,333
[SEILAH]
You've no choice.

426
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:29,375
My curse is absolute.

427
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:30,958
[ELFMAN]
Fine.

428
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:36,541
If you'll let Lisanna go,
I'll do anything.

429
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:40,833
Anything you say, even destroy
the guild that raised me.

430
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:16,458
[LUCY] Natsu, Erza, Mirajane,
and Lisanna have been captured.

431
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,666
Elfman is under
Seilah's control.

432
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:22,166
Franmalth and Crawford begin to
search in earnest for Jellal.

433
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,583
Oblivious to threats unseen,
Jellal continues his desperate

434
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:29,458
battle against the Oracion Seis.
We stumble through these broken

435
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:33,958
paths to nowhere, with no idea
that they're about to intersect.

436
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:37,875
Next Time: Tartaros Chapter -
A Place Reached by Prayer

437
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:41,666
If you want the truth,
then look into those eyes.
