00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,041
The beauty of our plan is
that whatever catastrophe

317
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,750
comes of this,
the world will know that

318
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,333
it was caused by Fairy Tail.

319
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:56,875
So, how much should I ask for
when the reparation talks begin?

320
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,833
Huh. Let me think on that.

321
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,208
These buildings were designed
by a famous architect,

322
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,500
so 5,000,000 each?

323
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:05,208
But, one can't put
a price on heritage,

324
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,833
so you could
demand twice that.

325
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:11,166
[SEEVER] Clever scoundrel!
You're in a league of your own!

326
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,291
[RIFTER] As humble
as you are devious, sir.

327
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,041
The lightning's everywhere now.
Even in the ground!

328
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,333
Yeah.

329
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,416
What are those things?

330
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,750
Aw, crap!

331
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,375
Those are lightning elementals.

332
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,083
They're what? Laxus!

333
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,916
[grunts]

334
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:41,541
[LAXUS grunting]

335
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,791
Be careful, buddy!

336
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,041
You're chargin' up too fast!

337
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,333
It's gonna be tough to handle!

338
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,625
I don't got a choice here!

339
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,291
If can't hold it in,
I'll blast the whole town

340
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,708
and you with it!

341
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,375
It looks like we're surrounded.

342
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,708
We've gotta thin their numbers.

343
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,750
There are too many
for Laxus to absorb!

344
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:04,041
Fairy Machine Gun: Leprechaun!

345
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,500
Nope. Didn't help.

346
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,125
Just shreddin' 'em
won't do the trick.

347
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,250
We've gotta destroy
'em completely!

348
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:14,041
Baryon... Formation!

349
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,250
Oh yeah!

350
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,125
Well, if that's all it takes...

351
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,625
Then I'll try a
Fairy Bomb: Gremlin!

352
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,041
They're coming up
from the ground.

353
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,166
--Well, that's strange.
--[thuds]

354
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,166
Laxus!

355
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,416
Don't worry, I'm fine.

356
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,916
Look by that statue.

357
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,833
Why? Those metal
grilles beneath it.

358
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,291
[FRIED] Electricity's
seeping through them.

359
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,291
On top of that, this looks
a lot like the place

360
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,541
where I zapped those punks.

361
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:50,583
You two go on ahead!

362
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,416
We'll make sure
nothin' follows you!

363
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,791
Right!

364
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,625
Do you see that light up there?

365
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,041
What the hell--?

366
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,500
That sphere's filled
with my electricity.

367
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,583
How can you be certain?

368
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,541
[LAXUS]
Every wielder of electric magic

369
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,750
has a unique wavelength.
Sorta like a fingerprint.

370
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,666
This must be the
electricity I blasted

371
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,541
into the ground that night.

372
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,333
[FRIED] So, it's been drawing
in static and lightning

373
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,916
ever since and
that's making it grow?

374
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,041
I didn't even know
that was possible.

375
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,166
[LAXUS] It happened,
so I guess it happens.

376
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,791
But how could it grow so
much in so little time?

377
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,041
Doesn't matter.
I've gotta stop it.

378
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,666
Do you have a plan?

379
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,291
If I hit it with
everything I've got,

380
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,875
it should cancel out.

381
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:42,041
[FRIED] That's far too risky.
You're already in pain as it is.

382
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,375
[LAXUS]
We're out of opinions.

383
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,250
I don't like the mayor,
but that sphere down there

384
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,666
proves he was right.

385
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,625
I created this thing. And it's
up to me to put it down.

386
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,333
Stop. It's too much,
even for you!

387
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,000
Never mind me. I'll be fine!

388
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,500
There's gonna be a
big bang down here

389
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,125
and I need you to contain it!

[EVERGREEN, BIXLOW gasp]

395
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,958
They pulled it off!

'Course they did!

What's that?

398
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,625
[BIXLOW] I've been possessing
one of the mayor's statues.

399
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:46,708
What's the news, kitty?
Didja hear anything juicy?

400
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,708
[LAXUS grunts]

00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,750
[panting]

402
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:01,375
[FRIED] That was amazing.
All of that power...

403
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,541
And you're still alive.

404
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:06,375
The explosion.
So nothing was destroyed?

405
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,500
I managed to hold
the blast in this room.

406
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:13,083
Just had to place a protective
enchantment on the walls.

407
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,750
You're quick on your
feet as always.

408
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,458
Well, shorthand enchantments
always were my specialty.

Hm?

411
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,625
A lacrima.

412
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,125
That explains it.

413
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,666
Your electricity didn't accrue
all that power on its own.

414
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,750
This lacrima must've
been amplifying it.

415
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:37,000
But how did it get here?
Doesn't seem like an accident.

416
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,333
Agreed, chances are that
someone deliberately

417
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:40,375
planted it here.

418
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,458
But who and for what reason?

about the mayor!

When I found out what
you'd done to your town.

445
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,250
I figured you were
selfish, human waste.

446
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:17,083
Make things right with
your people, Mr. Mayor,

but mercy is a good thing.

granddaughter was watching.

Don't ya think that'd
be a little awkward?

Well, you know.

00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,916
We wouldn't have wanted
that crooked mayor's

dirty money anyway.

460

And besides, the citizens
sent us off with a parade.

What more could
we have asked for?

Yeah. We have the

But they were short on cash.

guess it happens.

[LAXUS]
Hmph.

00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,000
Shall we try it again?

475
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,791
Is the king a punkin'?

476
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,958
[BOTH chuckle]

477
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,625
Let's play, Grandpa!

478
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:39,791
[SEEVER]
Anything for you, cutie-pie!

479
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:42,458
What would you like
to play? You name it!

480
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,041
[NATSU]
Hey, Happy.

481
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:16,000
[HAPPY]
Wah! Oh, Natsu. It's just you.

482
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:17,208
[NATSU]
You seem kinda jumpy, dude.

483
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,583
[HAPPY]
Well, of course I am!

484
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:21,250
It's terrible, Natsu.
All of Magnolia, it's been--

485
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,958
[NATSU]
It's been what? What happened?

486
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:24,500
[HAPPY whimpers]
I can't say it!

487
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:26,208
Just thinkin' about it
gives me shivers.

488
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:27,666
[NATSU] Quit hypin' it
up and spit it out!

489
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,541
[HAPPY] Okay. It's kinda like--
right behind you!

490
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:32,625
[NATSU screams]

491
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:36,500
[NATSU, HAPPY] Next Time:
"Fairy Tail of the Dead Men."

492
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:39,083
[NATSU] This is horrible.
What kinda monster are you?

493
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:42,041
[HAPPY] Please don't hurt me!
Take him instead!
