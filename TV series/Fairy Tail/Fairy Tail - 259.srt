[KYOKA yells]

323
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:42,333
[ERZA groaning]

324
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,541
[ERZA screams]

325
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,458
Erza, no!

326
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:51,541
[KYOKA] You dare believe that
a lowly human such as you

327
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,875
can stand against a demon of
the Books of Zeref and live?

328
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,916
I will teach you your place!

329
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,875
[ERZA gasping]

330
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,375
This is dire! Erza's been cursed

331
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,875
to feel the pain of every
single blow a thousand-fold!

332
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,625
I don't know howmmuch more
of this she can withstand.

333
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,750
Not to mention Kyoka's
getting stronger

334
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,166
with every passing second.

335
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,875
[KYOKA]
How...?

336
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:24,375
How is she not
crippled by the pain?

337
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,416
[KYOKA]
Why is she not cowering in fear?

338
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,583
[KYOKA screams]

339
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,833
[KYOKA]
She's too strong!

340
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,250
She did it!

341
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,083
Forty seconds!

342
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,791
We gotta move fast!

343
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,166
Finish her off
while you still can!

344
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,958
[MINERVA (NEO) grunts]
Come on!

345
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:23,416
[HAPPY]
Erza!

346
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,333
[MINERVA (NEO) grunts]

347
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:49,125
[panting]

348
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,625
[MINERVA (NEO)]
She's smiling.

349
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:08,625
Whoopididoo! We did it!

350
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:12,458
Every last one of those
Faces has blown!

351
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,166
[ERZA gasping]

352
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,750
[LECTOR, FROSCH whimper]

353
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:22,041
[FRANMALTH]
We win, you lose! This is it!

354
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,125
The end of all you
worthless wizards!

355
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:27,708
Tartaros' wish is
finally comin' true!

356
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,166
[MIRAJANE]
In a world without magic...

357
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,250
What are we?

358
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:15,750
[LUCY] Mard Geer and Natsu
renew their fight in earnest.

359
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:18,291
Vying for custody of
the book of E.N.D.

360
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,416
At first, Mard Geer
has the upper hand,

361
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,166
but he's interrupted by the
arrival of Sting and Rogue.

362
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,958
Both intent on finishing
what they started.

363
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:28,958
Natsu takes heart in the
presence of these new allies.

364
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:33,125
But it seems despair is always
lurking in the shadows.

365
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:38,000
Next Time: "Tartaros Chapter
The Girl in the Crystal."

366
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:40,541
The end is nigh.
