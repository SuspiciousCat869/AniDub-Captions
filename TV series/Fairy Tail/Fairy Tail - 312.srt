1
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,416
Where did Zeref go?

2
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,333
[STING] Well, don't forget we're
inside your mind, Natsu.

3
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:26,708
I imagine you subconsciously
replaced him with me.

4
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:29,458
You're not makin'
any sense, man!

5
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:30,666
[STING]
That's all right.

6
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,083
Follow me. We can find
the answer together.

7
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,541
To what?

8
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:37,875
Don't you wanna
know what that thing

9
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:40,541
growing inside you actually is?

10
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:44,666
And I hate the way you smell!

11
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,041
It's burning up the hair
in my nostrils!

12
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:49,166
The fact that a weak,
insignificant person

13
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,166
has the gall to challenge me
makes me wanna vomit.

14
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,875
Hey, Rogue!
Thanks for the power!

15
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:59,875
Now go, White Shadow Dragon.

16
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:02,875
I've got a fire in my belly.

17
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:04,833
On to the next desire.

18
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:07,375
One you will not
be able to resist.

19
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:10,250
This spell is known
as "Rest In Peace."

20
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,708
Call it whatever you want.

21
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:15,458
But you're still gonna lose.

22
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,375
Once I've ended your life,

23
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:21,000
Natsu Dragneel will be
the next one to perish.

24
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:23,416
[STING] Are you tryin'
to get me more fired up?

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,625
'Cause whether you like it or
not, that's what's happening!

26
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:26,000
I've spent way too many years
tryin' to get to Natsu's level,

27
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:29,375
so I'm not gonna let a bastard
like you get in my way.

28
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:33,166
My aim is to purify
Natsu's tarnished soul

29
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,041
with my own hands.

30
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:40,750
Your delusions of grandeur
won't be enough to stop me.

31
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,791
I've got real power,

32
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,041
and whenever I combine
it with Rogue's,

33
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,833
I wield the essence
of Sabertooth!

34
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,125
[chuckles]

35
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,250
Shattered.

36
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,041
White magic won't work

37
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,833
'cause Sting has the
power to cancel it.

38
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,375
I'm gonna knock
down your attack

39
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,833
and hit you with Rogue's shadow!

40
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,541
[STING yells]

41
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,750
[STING yelling]

42
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,250
[STING]
But wait.

43
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:37,041
[STING] Let's see what happens
when I use both at once!

44
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,333
[chuckles]

45
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:42,041
[yells]

46
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,625
[STING] So, you're the
stubborn type, huh?

47
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,375
[LARCADE]
Two powers together?

48
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,375
You're not strong enough
to fight the desire

49
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,041
all living creatures
must fall to.

50
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:18,375
Succumb to the eternal
sleep of death!

51
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,958
Now Rest in Peace!

52
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:23,916
[gasps]

53
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,875
What is this?

54
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,833
Mustn't sleep. No.

55
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:37,041
Death will be upon you the
instant you close your eyes.

56
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:45,083
Sleep... It's hard to resist.

57
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,125
But I cannot give in.

58
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:53,166
Listen, Frosch, you
can't fall asleep, okay?

59
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,125
I think so, too.

60
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,541
'Kay, good night.

61
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:03,333
Now is not the time
to say "good night."

62
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,833
Frosch! Listen to me.

63
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:16,750
Come on, Frosch.
Do you hear me? Wake up!

64
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,083
[screams]

65
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,375
[STING]
Snap out of it, damn it!

66
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,458
Don't sleep! Don't sleep!
Don't sleep!

67
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,083
Don't sleep! Don't sleep!

68
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,916
Nobody can fully resist
their primal desires.

69
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,625
Not even mighty Acnologia.

70
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:36,083
And that weakness
gives me power.

71
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,625
I will use it to defeat him,

72
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,916
thus proving I am
the ultimate wizard.

73
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,291
What now?

74
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,250
Your shadow. Go into it.

75
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:57,041
[ROGUE] Your senses will be
sharper inside the shadow.

76
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,583
It won't last long,
but it will wake you up.

77
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,958
I'm not so sure I'm able to.

78
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,625
I don't know how to do that.

79
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,416
You must feel the gravity.

80
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,666
Focus on it until your feet
and the ground become one.

81
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,500
[STING]
Feel the gravity. Become one.

82
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,750
[KAGURA]
Gravity is a specialty of mine!

83
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,916
I can make you sink
into the earth!

84
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,666
What the--?

85
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,083
Kagura!

86
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,750
[gasps]

87
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,416
I feel so heavy!

88
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,583
Okay, okay.
I'm awake! For real!

89
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:34,208
Wait! Hang on!

90
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,166
Yeah!

91
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,291
[STING] Crazy. I'm really
inside my shadow.

92
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:50,875
He was right.
My senses are sharpening!

93
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,208
[STING]
Here we go.

94
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,291
I can still see you!

95
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:03,625
Fly Spirit! Into the heavens!

96
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,083
[STING]
Won't happen!

97
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:08,958
'Cause I'm using all of our
powers combined into one!

98
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,750
Mine, too, huh?

99
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,666
[gasps]

100
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,083
It's called White
Shadow Dragon Silk!

101
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,291
[LARCADE groans]

102
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:32,666
Close your eyes.
You need to sleep it off.

103
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,541
Nice! Now that's how
you do it! Yeah!

104
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,708
A nap doesn't sound
so bad, huh?

105
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:47,333
Father... I failed.

106
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,625
[groans]

107
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,666
[NATSU]
Jeez, Sting. How far we goin'?

108
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,375
[ROGUE]
What?

109
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,666
I'm Rogue, Natsu.

110
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,916
[screams]

111
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,875
When did that happen?

112
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:31,208
[ROGUE] Look, we're inside
your mind, remember?

113
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:35,250
[NATSU] Hey! Don't you blame
me for your tricks, man!

114
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,791
[ROGUE] It only serves
as further proof

115
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,416
that you need to focus.

116
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,208
Huh?

117
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,458
You know about your
scarf, don't you?

118
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,083
That it was crafted for you
using Igneel's scales.

119
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,666
'Course I know!

120
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,916
The scarf is white despite the
fact Igneel's scales were red.

121
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,291
Do you know the reason why?

122
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,333
[NATSU]
Hm?

123
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,625
[gasps]

124
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,750
Oh, wow. That's
a great question!

125
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:59,541
[ROGUE] So it never crossed
your mind until just now?

126
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:04,041
Once a dragon's scales fall off,
they begin to lose their color.

127
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,791
[NATSU]
Huh. Okay.

128
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:09,291
That's important, but not for
the reason you think it is.

129
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,291
Humans can't touch
dragon scales.

130
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,791
Not until they've lost
their color completely.

131
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,541
You don't actually
believe Igneel sat down

132
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,541
and knitted a tiny,
human-sized scarf, do you?

133
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,208
[NATSU] Are you tryin'
to tell me he didn't?

134
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,500
[ROGUE]
As a matter of fact,

135
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,166
your scarf was made
by a woman named Anna.

136
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,250
It's safe to assume you've
forgotten about that, though.

137
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,916
Wait. Lucy?

138
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,041
Striking isn't it?
Looks just like your friend.

139
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,958
[NATSU]
You again!

140
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,291
Anna was very kind and caring.

141
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:50,166
She was a truly
incredible person.

142
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,375
Now then, your death
is drawing near.

143
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:57,666
As is the answer we
had hoped to find.

144
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,916
[LUCY]
Natsu!

145
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,083
[PORLYUSICA]
It's dire.

146
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,291
His temperature is
getting dangerously low.

147
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,583
[HAPPY] Come on, Natsu!
Snap out of it!

148
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,458
Lucy, remove your clothing.

149
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,416
Huh? Why should I?

150
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
[PORLYUSICA]
To keep him alive.

151
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,416
He needs the warmth.

152
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,500
He needs to feel it.

153
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:22,791
Your love.

154
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,750
Honestly, we need
a miracle right now.

155
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,250
Right.

156
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,833
Zeref.

157
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,291
I'll beat him.

158
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:40,250
Zeref... must die.

159
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,583
He must die.

160
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,208
[HAPPY]
It's all right, Natsu.

161
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:54,750
You don't have to do it, okay?

162
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:59,750
Because if you kill Zeref,
you're gonna die too, remember?

163
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,166
[gasps]

164
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,875
[HAPPY]
I don't want that. So please...

165
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:17,625
Wait. Hold on, Happy.
What are you talking about?

166
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:21,583
Can you hear me, God?
Natsu can't die now!

167
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,833
So keep him alive, okay?

168
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:28,458
Please, God. Save him.
Don't take him away from me!

169
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:29,708
Natsu!

170
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:34,916
So if he kills Zeref...
Natsu's gonna die, too?

171
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,958
[HAPPY crying]

172
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,000
[STING]
Hm?

173
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,125
Hey, Sting! Rogue! We're here!

174
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,416
You okay?

175
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,000
We're fine. Really.

176
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:12,458
I'm sorry. Can't
stand up right now.

177
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,750
Isn't that the enemy?

178
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,958
[YUKINO] Thank you for
taking care of him.

179
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,791
Sting is the man!

180
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,458
Rogue, too!

181
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,500
We couldn't have done it
without your help, buddy.

182
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:25,750
Thank you.

183
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,166
We didn't actually do
any fighting, ya know?

184
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,458
Well, I did throw
a rock, but still.

185
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,333
[FROSCH]
Hey, Rogue.

186
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,500
I waited so I can eat with you.

187
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,833
Uh, sure. Are you
feeling hungry?

188
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,166
Yeah! I waited for you!

189
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,625
[ROGUE]
Okay, thanks.

190
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,208
[YUKINO chuckles]

191
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,916
[MINERVA] Kagura, I didn't know
that you would be here.

192
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,500
Well, I am.

193
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,458
[BOTH gasp]

194
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:10,041
If you don't mind,
I'd love to join you.

[ERZA screams]

198
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,166
Victory is mine.

Yi Ragd!

200
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,416
No!

201
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,166
What is this?

202
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,041
[MINERVA]
Neir wilg mion.

[gasps]

206
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,666
I found a stray kitten.

207

[ERZA, KAGURA]
Millianna!

208
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,458
[ERZA]
What is the meaning of this?

209
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:33,375
[MINERVA] Look at that face,
twisted with pain.

210
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,916
The sphere she's in constantly
drains her magic power.

211
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,250
It's excruciating.

212
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,458
[ERZA]
What the hell is this?

213
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:47,083
Frankly, the two of you
were beginning to bore me.

214
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:50,416
I needed to do something
to entertain myself.

215
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,708
Her screams were quite lovely.

216
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:59,541
I hand over this
victory to-- Uh!

217
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,083
[MINERVA]
I need to apologize.

218
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,541
I treated you so poorly during
the Grand Magic Games.

219
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:27,833
It was wrong.

220
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,541
[KAGURA]
It's okay. I've let it go.

221
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,791
Honestly, I've decided
to live my life

222
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,708
without holding grudges.

223
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,083
Leave the past behind me.

224
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:45,875
Anyway... it seems this girl is
having some interesting dreams.

225
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,375
That's nice. Now don't
be in such a hurry.

226
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:52,208
--Seems that way. She, uh--
--Yeah. Kinda forgot about her.

227
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:55,541
Oh, you know, it's
sort of a long story.

228
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,875
Man, I am so beat.

229
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,958
You think you can take
things from here?

230
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:03,916
Sure thing. I'll get
us to Fairy Tail.

231
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,875
[KAGURA]
Erza. Please be safe.

232
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,458
[yells]

233
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,000

234
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,250
[IRENE]
Hm.

235
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,333
No, Erza!

236
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,625
Not bad.

237
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:11,708
[gasps]

238
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:15,750
Wait.

239
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:23,666
Heaven's Wheel!
Scattered petals!

240
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,916
Did that stop her?

241
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,083
No. Defeating her will
prove far more difficult.

242
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,000
[IRENE]
An attack of countless swords

243
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,333
all converging on your target.

244
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:43,500
I'm impressed you were able
to control that many at once.

245
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,333
It's quite a feat.

246
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,291
--[IRENE clapping]
--[gasps]

247
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,083
[IRENE]
For all your hard work...

248
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,666
[IRENE]
You earned a flower.

249
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,208
She was able to block that
attack and do all this, too?

250
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,125
But how?

251
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,791
She's mocking me.

252
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,458
Come on, Erza, you had this
girl enhance your power

253
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,333
and this is the best you can do?

254
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:19,500
Shame. How disappointing.

255
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,875
Tell me. Who are you, really?

256
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,708
[IRENE]
Still haven't figured that out?

257
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:36,250
Ah. Deep in your heart,
you know exactly who I am.

258
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,458
But you don't
wanna believe it.

259
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,208
[ERZA]
I've never seen you before.

260
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:46,958
[WENDY] This woman doesn't
just look like Erza...

261
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,750
...she smells a lot
like her, too.

262
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,916
Now, now, Erza.

263
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,750
That's a rude thing
to say to your mother.

264
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,333
What? Is she really
your mother, Erza?

265
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,750
You liar!

266
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,375
[VILLAGERS screaming]

267
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,750
[ERZA]
I grew up in Rosemary Village

268
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,416
before it was burned
to the ground.

269
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:22,083
[ERZA]
I'm an orphan. I have no family.

270
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:25,916
You're wrong about that.
Because I am your mother, Erza.

271
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,250
I've only had one
parent in my life.

272
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,791
His name was Master Makarov!

273
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,791
Fine, if that's what you want.

274
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,458
And just because
I have a daughter

275
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:44,375
doesn't mean I care about her.

276
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:47,791
In fact, I thought you were
dead all these years.

277
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,916
[IRENE] I never would've dreamed
we'd meet on the battlefield.

278
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,875
Fate works in mysterious ways.

279
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,958
[ERZA]
No matter who you are,

280
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:07,666
you attacked Fairy Tail,
and that makes you my enemy.

281
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,000
[IRENE]
Mm.

282
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,541
Just as anyone who dares
oppose the Alvarez Empire

283
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,541
is my sworn enemy.

284
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,708
[IRENE]
Even my very own child.

285
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,416
[IRENE]
But still, dying here

286
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,458
without ever learning
the secret of your birth...

287
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,500
[IRENE]
...that would be tragic.

288
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,333
A secret?

289
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,291
It means nothing to me!

290
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,833
I've held on to this
story for years now.

291
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:40,000
You could at least allow me
to share it with you, Erza.

292
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,750
Shut your mouth!

293
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:43,958
[yells]

294
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:51,541
My name is Irene.
Irene Belserion.

295
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:57,625
[IRENE] And once upon a time,
I was queen of the dragons.

296
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:40,083
[LUCY]
Four hundred years ago,

297
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:43,833
our peaceful world was attacked
by bloodthirsty dragons.

298
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:47,000
Their rampage threatened to
exterminate all of mankind.

299
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:50,000
But a lone queen rose up,
hoping to create a future

300
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:52,541
in which humans and
dragons could coexist.

301
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:55,208
Little did she know that
her plan would spell doom

302
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:58,833
for everything she so
desperately wanted to protect.

303
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:01,625
Next Time: "Dragon Seed."

304
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:05,375
Love will be blotted out by
a heart beyond redemption.
