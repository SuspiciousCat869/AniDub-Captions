1
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:39,375
Oh! That vest looks like
it was made just for you.

2
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,166
The color and fit are perfect!

3
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,750
Eh. No offense pops,
but it seems like

4
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,041
last year's style to me.

5
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,083
Yeah, me too.

6
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:50,458
[VENDOR 202A] Okay. Well, this
one is all the rage today.

7
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:53,375
[LECTOR] Ah, yeah!
Diggin' the fringe!

8
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,291
Do you have it in
any other colors?

9
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,666
Of course! We have a
wide variety of colors!

10
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,208
[LECTOR] Awesome.
Looks like it's well made.

11
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,958
The lining is nice
and soft, too!

12
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,500
[VENDOR 202A]
So do we have a sale?

13
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,791
[LECTOR]
Hm. It's super nice and all,

14
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:07,791
but I'm not sure if
it's totally my style.

15
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,000
I think it's quite
handsome on you, sir.

16
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:12,375
Well, what do you
think about it, Fro?

17
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:14,708
Uh. That's weird.

18
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:18,083
He was right here a second ago.

19
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:20,625
[LECTOR]
Where are you? Hey, Fro!

20
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:25,750
[LECTOR]
Frosch!

21
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,333
[MALE 202A] Man, it seems
like everywhere I go,

22
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:02,000
people are still worked up over
the Grand Magic Games.

23
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,208
[MALE 202B] Well, it definitely
had a big impact on Sabertooth,

24
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,166
that's for sure.

25
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,375
[MALE 202A]
Tell me about it.

26
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,833
[MALE 202B]
They were pretty scary before.

27
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,958
I heard Master Jiemma
was really tough on them.

28
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,916
They won the games a
few times, but I think

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,958
everyone was miserable.

30
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,583
[MALE 202A]
Now, they're all smiles.

31
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,250
[MALE 202B] I guess having
Sting as their master

32
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,833
has been good for them.

33
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,875
[MALE 202A] It seems like it's
good for the whole town, too.

34
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,416
It's like a dark cloud
has been lifted.

35
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,875
[MALE 202B]
Seriously.

36
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,416
But still.

37
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,541
I saw Sting earlier today and
he seemed kind of on edge.

38
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:27,708
Oh yeah?

39
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,333
I saw him too, and the
way he was looking

40
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:32,125
reminded me of Jiemma,
which is not a good thing.

41
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,375
Our guild aims to
stun the heavens.

42
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:46,333
Rouse the land beneath us.
Silence the raging seas.

43
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:49,541
[STING]
That is the Sabertooth way.

44
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:54,125
Hear me? Take it off!

45
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:02,166
Yes. If that is
what you wish, sir.

46
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,208
[STING growls]

47
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:19,041
Everybody in the water,
'cause we got ourselves a pool!

48
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,250
[ALL cheering]

49
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,125
This was a
wonderful idea, Sting!

50
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,375
I don't think I've ever
seen him this happy.

51
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,625
[YUKINO giggles]

52
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:29,000
I can't seem to recall
ever feeling this good.

53
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,083
Jump in! The water
feels amazing!

54
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,000
Seriously, no one's gonna
believe that we actually

55
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,416
have a pool in our Guild Hall!

56
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,000
Stop it! You're
getting my hair wet!

57
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,125
I've certainly never heard
of a guild with a luxury

58
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,708
such as this.

59
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,000
The other guilds are jealous,
because we got ourselves a pool.

60
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,625
Ah-choo!

61
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,625
[MIRAJANE] You're not catching
a cold are you, Master?

62
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,625
[MAKAROV] I'm fine.
Just a little sneeze.

63
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:48,791
[NATSU]
Check this out!

64
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,541
German Suplex, coming' right up!

65
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,208
[LUCY]
No!

66
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,041
Hey, some of us are
trying to relax here!

67
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,666
Gray in a swimsuit
is so incredibly hot!

68
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,666
I'm just glad he decided
not to go skinny-dipping.

69
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,541
So relaxing. Don't you think?

70
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:03,875
[CARLA]
Yes, but should everybody just

71
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,541
be loafing around like this?

72
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,208
The only thing that
would make this better

73
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,041
is if the pool was
filled with yummy fish.

74
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,375
Swimming is fun,
and it's actually

75
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,916
a very good way to exercise.

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,041
[MAKAROV] It may seem a bit
excessive, but putting a pool

77
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,041
in the yard like this
was a brilliant idea.

78
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,416
Yeah!

79
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,750
Hm. We are the only guild
that has a pool, right?

80
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,583
[RUFUS] I don't remember anyone
else talking about having one.

81
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,041
Loosen up a little, Rogue!

82
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,541
Stop. You're behaving
like a child.

83
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,166
[LECTOR]
Hey Sting!

84
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,416
Listen, Sting! Oh,
I mean, Master.

85
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,750
[STING] You know I don't care
about that 'Master' crap.

86
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:35,916
Is there something wrong?

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,833
Yeah. Something's really wrong!

88
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,583
Well, we were out
shopping in the market,

89
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:42,208
and somehow Frosch just
completely disappeared on me.

90
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:42,875
Say, what?

91
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,458
Oh no, that's awful!

92
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:45,666
Are you joking?

93
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,291
Or are you really so
careless that you'd just

94
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,541
let something like this happen?

95
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,083
[LECTOR]
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,083
I just turned my back for a
second and that's all it took!

97
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,125
Hey man. This was
obviously an accident,

98
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,625
so back off, would ya?

99
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,708
Don't you understand?

100
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,708
Frosch doesn't know
how to get back here!

101
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,166
Yeah, I know, but that's
not Lector's fault!

102
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,500
[ROGUE]
He knew that too!

103
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,083
[STING]
He didn't do it on purpose!

104
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,875
Can you two please stop arguing
for a second and get serious?

105
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,333
[YUKINO] We need to go
and look for Frosch.

106
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,500
[HAPPY]
Welcome Back, Frosch!

107
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,875
So you were here when you
lost track of Frosch, huh?

108
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,750
[LECTOR] Yeah. There were
so many people around,

109
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,833
and I guess Frosch just
got lost in the crowd.

110
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:37,750
Hey Frosch! Where are you?

111
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,208
[STING]
Come on back!

112
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,750
[YUKINO]
We miss you!

113
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,708
[LECTOR] When it happened,
I asked a bunch of folks.

114
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,583
But it's so packed with
people out here today,

115
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,083
that it seems like nobody
really saw anything.

116
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,416
Don't worry, buddy.

117
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,333
I'm sure we'll find
Frosch in no time.

118
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,875
Hey, look! We know
them, don't we?

119
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,041
[STING, ROGUE]
Huh?

120
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,125
Hey. Now this is a
nice piece of gear.

121
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,583
[PANTHERLILY] This appears to
be a high quality item as well.

122
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:02,958
Lovely.

123
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,083
[VENDOR 202B] You know,
these aren't really weapons.

124
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,333
They're actually
props and set pieces.

125
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,583
100% steel, so they're heavy,

126
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,833
but I wouldn't use
'em in battle--

127
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,875
[VENDOR 202B]
Or to snack on!

128
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,375
[STING]
Yo, Gajeel!

129
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,250
Hey! If you've seen
Frosch around here,

130
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,375
you'd better start talking!

131
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,125
And you'd better get
your hands off me!

132
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,666
You got some kind of death wish?

133
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,791
[STING] No. He's just a
little upset right now.

134
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,125
[LECTOR] We've been
looking but we haven't

135
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,666
seen Frosch anywhere. Have you?

136
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,666
[GAJEEL] Who's Frosch?
That weird little frog?

137
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,250
[ROGUE]
A cat!

138
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,166
[PANTHERLILY] Well, technically
speaking, we're called Exceeds.

139
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,416
So tell me.

140
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,208
This is the last place
you saw your friend?

141
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,333
[LECTOR]
Yeah.

142
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,916
I saw what I thought
was a short person

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,250
in a frog costume a few minutes
ago at the park down the road.

144
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:40,958
Oh, really?

145
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,000
We owe you one!

146
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,333
Let's go!

147
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:46,541
Thanks. You're sweet.
You've been very helpful.

148
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,916
[GAJEEL] Dealing with them
again gives me a headache.

149
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,166
Me too.

150
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,583
[WENDY]
Ooh.

151
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,208
I love this bathing suit.

152
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,541
What do you think?

153
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,916
[CARLA] Wendy! That's far
too revealing for you.

154
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,666
It's not for me,
it's for Shelia.

155
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,416
[CARLA]
Well, that's a different story.

156
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,041
Think she'll like it?

157
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,458
[CARLA]
Hm.

158
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:09,083
On her. It might be a
little more flattering.

159
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,083
She can fill it out.

160
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,875
Good point!

161
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,041
[ROGUE]
Frosch!

162
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,458
[STING]
Where did you go?

163
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,708
Oh. I think I hear Sabertooth.

164
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,875
What in the world could
they be shouting about?

165
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,875
[YUKINO] Wendy! Carla!
It's good to see you!

166
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,083
[STING]
I bet they saw something.

167
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,625
Thanks again for all
your help during

168
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:27,833
the Grand Magic Games!

169
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,333
[CARLA]
They were our biggest rivals.

170
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,791
[STING] Anyway, we need
to ask you a question.

171
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:32,708
[ROGUE grunts]

172
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,333
Listen! Tell us where Frosch is,

173
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,458
so things don't
have to get ugly!

174
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:39,708
She's just a little girl,
so cool it on the threats!

175
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:40,708
[ROGUE]
So sorry.

176
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,708
You're looking for Frosch?

177
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,000
That's right.

178
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,958
The little cat that
wears the pink frog suit.

179
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,750
Well we did see that
one down the street

180
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:48,583
not too long ago.

181
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,958
That's awesome! C'mon pal!

182
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,958
Thank you from the
bottom of my heart.

183
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,833
I mean it, this proves
you're just as beautiful

184
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,458
on the inside as the outside.

185
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,208
I just got a horrible feeling.

186
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,916
Like I got caught
in a love triangle.

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,083
What are you babblin' about?

188
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,625
[CARLA]
Very odd.

189
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,875
[WENDY]
Definitely.

190
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,000
[ICHIYA]
Man. It fits perfectly.

191
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:11,125
[VENDOR 202C] Sorry, but
that's not how you wear those.

192
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,625
[ROGUE]
Frosch!

193
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:13,625
[STING]
Answer us!

194
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:14,625
[ICHIYA]
What's this?

195
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,000
Please come home!

196
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,375
[STING]
Of course. No sign here, either.

197
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,000
Must've moved on to
the next place already.

198
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,833
To picture my best
friend walking around

199
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,083
lost and alone just
breaks my heart.

200
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,416
I don't know how much
longer I can go on like this.

201
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,125
Would you pull
yourself together, man?

202
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,750
[ROGUE sniffles]

203
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,250
My brothers-in-arms.
Let me help you.

204
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,083
[LECTOR]
Hey, you're from Blue Pegasus!

205
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,166
[YUKINO]
Ichiya, right?

206
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,416
[ROGUE growls]

207
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,500
[ICHIYA gasps]

208
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,291
Where's Frosch? Answer me!

209
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,666
[ROGUE grunts]
[ICHIYA moans]

210
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,041
That was totally uncalled for!

211
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,416
Uh. Whoops my bad!

212
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,625
It's fine. That was just the
jolt of energy I needed.

213
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,000
[STING]
What the hell's happening?

214
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,458
[ROGUE]
Is he wearing a thong?

215
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:57,041
[LECTOR] How is this guy
still kind of awesome?

216
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:00,041
Excuse us, but our friend
Frosch has gone missing.

217
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,416
I know just where to look!

218
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,125
So? Tell me!

219
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:06,625
[ICHIYA]
Right here! Oh! Yeah!

220
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,666
[ICHIYA groaning]
Man.

221
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,875
[STING] Uh. We're kind of in
a hurry, so see you later.

222
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,541
Hey Frosch! Where are you?

223
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,333
[LECTOR]
I'm sorry I lost you!

224
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,958
[STING] There's too
many people here for me

225
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,500
to pick up the scent.

226
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,416
[YUKINO]
Guys, look! Over there!

227
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,541
[STING]
Alright! Good eye!

228
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,541
Finally!

229
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,291
Hey!

230
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,833
Hold on!

231
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,458
Hold on.

232
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,875
Uh-oh!

233
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,791
Dude, that is totally not cool!

234
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,625
[ROGUE] I didn't mean to hold
on to that! I mean, sorry.

235
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,375
[YUKINO]
Uh, it's okay.

236
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,791
[ROGUE] But seriously,
stop and look a second.

237
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,333
Check it out!

238
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,041
Reading a map, eh?

239
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,416
That's right!

240
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,916
This whole time, Frosch
has been trying to get back

241
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,166
to the Guild Hall.

242
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,458
And to make it there
without anyone's help.

243
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:06,708
Huh?

244
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,625
[ROGUE groaning]

245
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:10,875
I have to harden my heart

246
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,125
and keep my protective
instincts inside.

247
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,291
This could be a real milestone.

248
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,083
I really wouldn't bet on that.

249
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,250
Not gonna happen.

250
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,541
You just gotta have faith!

251
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:27,125
[YUKINO] Maybe we should
watch and see how things go.

252
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,958
[LECTOR] Huh?
[ROGUE] Eastward bound.

253
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,000
[STING]
Wow!

254
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,125
[YUKINO]
That's the right direction!

255
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,000
[ROGUE]
Good job little buddy.

256
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:33,833
[FROSCH]
Huh?

257
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:34,916
[LECTOR]
Here we go.

258
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,666
[ROGUE]
No--

259
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,625
No! Stay focused!

260
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:39,500
That was quick.

261
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,541
Will you leave the frog alone?

262
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,166
That thing's gone
outta control!

263
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,000
[ALL]
Oh no!

264
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,333
That thing's gone
outta control!

265
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,000
There's nobody driving it!

266
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,708
This is bad!

267
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,500
Frosch has to learn
to be more independent,

268
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,000
but this situation has
become very dangerous!

269
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,083
I have to somehow
figure out a way to help

270
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,541
without it being noticeable.

271
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,375
Hi-yah!

272
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,083
Oh. That's right.

273
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,291
Yeah.

274
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,166
It may be an emergency,
but there's no point

275
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,791
in trying to tell that to
a Dragon Slayer's belly.

276
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,333
Gotta fight through this.

277
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:29,166
I can't let my weakness
cause harm to my friend.

278
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,708
Can't stop now.

279
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,625
[STING, YUKINO]
Rogue!

280
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,333
[LECTOR]
You okay?

281
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,416
Was that enough?

282
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,208
[STING]
Yeah, good job.

283
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,333
[ROGUE]
What a relief.

284
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,958
Meow?

285
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,125
I'm sorry.

286
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,583
I thought you were
a little kitty witty,

287
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,041
but I guess you're a frog?

288
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,833
Yeah, I think so.

289
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,041
My word.

290
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,000
She is quite a
charming creature.

291
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,916
Seriously?

292
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,416
I think so, too!

293
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,041
[KAGURA]
How precious.

294
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,083
[LECTOR] You know.
Ever since we were little,

295
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:13,500
Frosch has always wanted
to be a frog for some reason.

296
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,708
The truth about what
we are set off three

297
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,833
whole days of non-stop crying.

298
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,916
That has to be the most
beautiful story I've ever heard.

299
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,500
[STING]
Uh, for real?

300
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:23,833
The poor thing.

301
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,666
it's just so sweet.

302
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,791
You know. You could
come back home with me.

303
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:28,500
[FROSCH]
Huh?

304
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,500
What?

305
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,750
[MILLIANNA] Since when do
you start taking random frogs

306
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,333
home to be your pets?

307
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,333
[KAGURA]
No. She's not a pet.

308
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,833
I've always wanted
a little sister.

309
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,208
[MILLIANNA]
Awkward.

310
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,875
We can't let this happen.

311
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:42,875
You're right!

312
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,000
[YUKINO]
Wait. Something's weird.

313
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,208
[ROGUE, STING gasp]

314
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,333
[MILLIANNA]
You might want to rethink this.

315
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,666
He's Rogue's partner.
I don't think Sabertooth

316
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,500
would be cool about
you kidnapping him.

317
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,750
[KAGURA]
Hmph. You're lying to me.

318
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,458
I know what the truth is.

319
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,666
You want this little
one all to yourself.

320
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,083
Guess I couldn't hide it.

321
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,625
But can you blame me?

322
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,958
A little cuddly-wuddly kitty
in a little pink frog costume

323
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,583
is the cutest
thing in the world!

324
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,166
I simply can't let you take her.

325
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,166
[MILLIANNA]
Wait, are you serious?

326
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,958
[KAGURA]
Extremely serious.

327
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,916
Well, I suppose we'll just
have to wait and take on

328
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,375
the winner of this round.

329
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,875
You mean, we'll have to
wait and take down Kagura.

330
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,708
That's not something I
ever want to do again.

331
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:26,500
[MILLIANNA]
Hang on!

332
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,000
[KAGURA]
Lost your nerve?

333
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,833
[MILLIANNA] Maybe we should
just try asking the little

334
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,750
kitty face who he'd
rather be snuggling with?

335
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,666
[KAGURA] Seems like a
reasonable solution.

336
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,833
[KAGURA]
Uh...

337
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,416
[MILLIANNA]
He's gone!

338
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,875
[STING] Oh man! We were too busy
getting hyped for their fight!

339
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,125
[ROGUE]
We have to keep looking!

340
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,416
[YUKINO, LECTOR]
Right!

341
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,541
Well, look at what
we got here!

342
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,041
That's like a totally
rare kind of frog, man.

343
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,458
It's adorable!

344
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,166
[RUFFIAN 202A] Is there
somethin' kinda weird about it?

345
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,791
[RUFFIAN 202B]
Yeah, I think it's a cat.

346
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,333
[RUFFIAN 202C]
It's totes aborbs

347
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,750
[RUFFIAN 202D] I've never
seen anything like it.

348
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,000
Oopsy.

349
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,458
[STING] If you ask me,
these guys are obviously

350
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:03,500
up to no good.

351
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,083
[YUKINO]
They could be dangerous.

352
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,416
[ROGUE]
Uh-huh.

353
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,750
Let's nab the thing!

354
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,250
Bet it's worth mad jewel.

355
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,708
Now get in the box,
little kitty frog.

356
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:12,958
Those fiends.

357
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,666
You're just gonna stand there?

358
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,750
[RUFFIAN 202A]
In you go!

359
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,000
[RUFFIAN 202B]
Got ya!

360
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,125
[RUFFIAN 202C]
Hold still!

361
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,041
So fast!

362
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,458
Way to go, little buddy!

363
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,208
They're pretty
bad at kidnapping.

364
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,708
Not so threatening.

365
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:24,750
[RUFFIAN 202A]
That sucked.

366
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:25,833
[RUFFIAN 202B]
Got some mad skills.

367
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:26,875
[RUFFIAN 202C]
Little bugger's quick.

368
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,666
[RUFFIAN 202D]
How embarrassing.

369
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,666
I can't argue with you there!

370
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,125
[RUFFIAN 202E]
What do we have here?

371
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,958
[RUFFIAN 202F]
Bunch of losers eating dirt.

372
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,541
[RUFFIAN 202G]
Totally pathetic.

373
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,083
[RUFFIAN BOSS 202A]
You four idiots can't even

374
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,916
catch one frog?

375
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,041
Hello.

376
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:41,708
The boss!

377
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:42,791
Perfect timing.

378
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,291
I knew you rookies
couldn't hack it.

379
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,916
And now you're making
everyone in the whole

380
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,875
frog trading industry look like
a bunch of incompetent morons.

381
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,166
Who the heck are these guys?

382
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,500
I can't tell if they're
dangerous or harmless.

383
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:56,041
Yeah, and has anybody ever heard
of a 'frog trading industry?'

384
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,916
[laughs] Alright, little
froggy, you're about

385
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,541
to get caught by
the boss himself.

386
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,875
[FROSCH whimpers]

387
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,833
We can't just sit here
and watch this happen.

388
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,083
You're right Lector.

389
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,125
I have to do something.

390
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,291
[LUCY screams]

391
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,416
What's the big idea?

392
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,208
Aw crap! I didn't mean
to catch a blond chick!

393
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,791
Hey Frosch, what're you up to?

394
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,041
[FROSCH]
Hi!

395
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,958
Are you trying to get
a little shopping done?

396
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,750
This one's mine!

397
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,875
[HAPPY]
Whoa.

398
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,500
Hey, don't you hop
away, little froggy!

399
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,875
[LUCY]
Let go of me!

400
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,458
Gotcha now!

401
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:27,416
Ha!

402
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,541
What the?

403
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,583
That's no way to get
a date, you know!

404
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,791
Hands off, jerk!

405
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,583
So what do we do now?

406
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,500
Well, now that Natsu's
gotten involved,

407
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,875
the situation has become
extremely unpredictable.

408
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,375
[YUKINO, LECTOR]
Yeah, no kidding.

409
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,916
[NATSU]
Okay!

410
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I have no idea what's goin'
on here, but I am fired up now!

411
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,000
And that means,

412
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,000
I gotta burn some butts!

413
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,583
I owe 'em one, too!

414
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:50,625
Now Open.

415
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,166
Gate of the Archer!

416
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,583
[LUCY]
Sagittarius!

417
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,541
I shall vanquish
these rapscallions!

418
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:57,875
And I'll do it in a jiffy!

419
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,625
[RUFFIANS screaming]

420
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:01,666
I got ya!

421
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,125
You got me!

422
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,625
Fire Dragon.

423
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,291
Brilliant Flame!

424
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,083
[RUFFIANS clamoring]

425
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:12,041
[RUFFIANS scream]

426
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,916
[RUFFIAN BOSS 202A]
He's a monster.

427
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,333
[LUCY] You didn't have to
destroy the entire city block!

428
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,375
Do you know how much
this is gonna cost?

429
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,958
[NATSU]
Aw, calm down.

430
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,208
We can just pay for it with the
money we make on our next job.

431
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,250
See. I told you
he's unpredictable.

432
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,666
That was freakin' awesome!

433
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,208
Natsu really knows how to
take out the street trash!

434
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,041
For a second there,
I thought Frosch

435
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,250
was in major trouble
from those punks.

436
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,333
That was close.

437
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,833
[HAPPY]
So, where did Frosch go?

438
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,250
Yeah, good question.

439
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,916
I wonder where to.

440
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,208
What?

441
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,875
Oh no!

442
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,208
That's one of the
Sabertooth cats.

443
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,875
Its name is Frosch, right?

444
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,666
Huh?

445
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,500
[JUVIA]
Well, hello.

446
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,958
[FROSCH]
Hello to you!

447
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,833
[GRAY] What are you doin'
in this part of town?

448
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,458
[FROSCH]
Just a little shopping.

449
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,541
I had no idea you
were so responsible.

450
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,458
[FROSCH]
Yep, that's me!

451
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,083
[FROSCH whimpers]

452
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,333
Hey. What are you cryin' for?

453
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,958
Something wrong?

454
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,958
I don't know where I am.

455
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,250
Oh, poor Frosch!

456
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,041
I guess it's finally
time to lend a hand.

457
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,583
It was bound to happen.

458
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,458
[ROGUE]
No, don't!

459
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:29,000
Because, that would
mean we're giving up.

460
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:32,541
We have to let Frosch get back
to the guild without our help.

461
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,458
[LECTOR]
Okay.

462
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,625
Just tell us where your guild
is and we'll take you there.

463
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,750
[JUVIA]
Oh, you're so considerate.

464
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,500
[FROSCH]
No. I should do it myself.

465
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:55,000
I always end up lost
no matter where I go.

466
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:59,666
I need to learn how to get
back home all on my own.

467
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,583
Because I'm a proud member
of the Sabertooth guild.

468
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:03,875
See?

469
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,291
And I know,

470
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,041
that somewhere out there,
my best friend Rogue

471
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,625
is cheering me on.

472
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:15,666
[ROGUE]
Yes, it's true.

473
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,416
[GRAY] Understood.
You'll make it there.

474
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,666
[FROSCH]
I think so, too!

475
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,250
I guess our little Frosch

476
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,125
is finally starting
to grow up a bit.

477
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,166
It's so adorable.

478
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,500
I'll wipe that smirk
right off your face!

479
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,833
[FROSCH giggling]

480
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,791
[FROSCH]
Huh?

481
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:01,791
[LECTOR]
Uh oh.

482
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,500
[ROGUE]
Forget about the butterfly!

483
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:06,000
Come on, Frosch! You just gotta
keep your eyes on the prize!

484
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,583
The city is pretty chock full
of distractions, ain't it?

485
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,083
Please don't get lost again.

486
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,125
Great. It looks like we got
more of this in our future.

487
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,625
[STING]
Oh, it's Erza!

488
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,291
[YUKINO] I think she might
be giving some directions.

489
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,541
[ROGUE]
Good idea!

490
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,958
I bet she knows how to
get to the Guild Hall.

491
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,083
[LECTOR]
Aw, sweet!

492
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,583
She's pointing in
the right direction!

493
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,625
[ERZA] What did you end
up buying, by the way?

494
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,291
A matching suit.

495
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,291
Want to try it on?

496
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,541
[ROGUE]
What was that?

497
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:34,875
[LECTOR] Don't tell me
that's the whole reason

498
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,750
why we got separated.

499
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:40,875
[ERZA] Oh, this is really cute.
And I simply adore the color.

500
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,291
What an amazing find!

501
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,708
[ERZA]
I think Rogue will be delighted!

502
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,625
[FROSCH]
I think so too!

503
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,541
How sweet!

504
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,791
If you wear that,
I'm so making fun of you.

505
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:55,583
[LECTOR]
Look! Erza's waving goodbye!

506
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:58,000
[ROGUE]
Yes! You can do it, Frosch!

507
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,791
Wow! I kind of feel like
I'm watching a little kid

508
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,458
taking their very first steps
toward being an adult!

509
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:25,833
Me too.

510
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,291
You can do it. I know it.

511
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,583
[FROSCH] Over the river
and through the woods.

512
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,750
it's back to the guild I go!

513
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,500
Under the bridge
and through the city,

514
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,208
it's back to the guild I go.

515
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,333
[FROSCH gasps]

516
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,166
[STING]
Whoa, that's crazy.

517
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,000
Sleepwalking back to the guild?

518
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,708
Just keep on walking, pal.

519
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:12,000
We all believe in you!

520
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:16,750
[ROGUE] Frosch. You've come
this far all by yourself.

521
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,333
[ROGUE] As much as I
want to, I can't interfere.

522
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:30,041
[FROSCH]
I made it!

523
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,708
[ROGUE]
I just wanna let you know...

524
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:37,333
That this isn't it!

525
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:40,541
Oopsy. Wrong place.

526
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:15,458
[NATSU] Aw yeah, a game
of pool sounds awesome!

527
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:18,458
[HAPPY] Now be honest. Do
you even know how to play pool?

528
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,583
[NATSU]
Don't be silly, of course I do.

529
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:21,958
First, you get all the balls

530
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,875
and then hit 'em with
a break shot, right?

531
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:25,708
[HAPPY]
Yeah. You're right so far.

532
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:27,791
[NATSU] And they call it a
break because you're supposed

533
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,541
to blow them into
a million pieces!

534
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:30,916
I can totally do that!

535
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,291
[HAPPY] That's not why they
call it that, you dummy!

536
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:35,916
[HAPPY, NATSU]
Next Time: Moulin Rouge

537
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,166
[NATSU]
Alright, smart guy,

538
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,625
what are you supposed
to be breaking, then?

539
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:39,833
[HAPPY]
Never mind.

540
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:41,625
I think I want to see
you play after all!
