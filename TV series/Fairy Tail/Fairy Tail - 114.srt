All I ever wanted is
the strength to protect those

I hold close to my heart.

3
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,875
I would give up all of
my strength if I could still

00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:29,541
guarantee their safety.

5
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:36,000
It's strange but true.

6
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,333
[AZUMA]
What a shame.

7
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:38,875
You're quite interesting.

8
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,041
I had hoped we'd
have a fair fight.

[ERZA]
What do you mean by that?

We've reached a
different stage in our battle.

[NATSU]
Previously, on Fairy Tail!

13
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,125
[NARRATOR] The battle on Tenrou
Island became a tug of war

14
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:25,958
of epic proportions.

15
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:29,208
Grimoire Heart gained the upper
hand at nearly every turn,

16
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,250
especially once Sub-commander
Bluenote Stinger arrived

17
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,708
on the battlefield.

18
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,375
When the Grand Spell Fairy
Glitter failed to stop him,

19
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,708
Fairy Tail's defeat
seemed certain.

20
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,583
But the tides turned
once more, as Freed, Bixlow,

21
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:45,000
and the powerhouse Gildarts came
back to aid their comrades.

22
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,916
So the tug of war continued.

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,458
But just when hope had
returned to our heroes,

24
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:52,500
a new calamity occurred
that could spell their doom.

25
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,958
Will the fall of the
Tenrou Tree be the instrument

26
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,791
of Fairy Tail's demise?

00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:00,458
Or is there one last ray of
light in this abysmal darkness?

What gives.

It feels like all my strength
got sucked out of me.

Yeah, and my head
is spinning in circles.

00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:23,916
I may hurl.

Why is everything spinning?

what the hell's going on?

It seems as though the
Tenrou Tree has been uprooted.

55

Now it will act as
a garrote for anyone who bears

the Fairy Tail emblem.

It was an option.

This is part

You know why.

It's said it could stop
a direct blast from

a Jupiter focused magic cannon.

You've truly earned
the name Titania.

Even the Purgatory

[AZUMA] You overestimated your
armor's effectiveness and left

My Armadura Fairy
armor is still broken,

135

and I seriously doubt any of my
remaining armor will do the job.

Think, Erza!

00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,750
Well, there is that.

138
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,500
I may have bought the
seduction armor for private use.

139
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,416
but, perhaps.

I am not Lucy!

Come on.

00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,375
Think this through.

145
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:38,291
If I'm going to overcome
his power, I'll have to

146
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:42,375
sacrifice defense and start
focusing on my attacks.

147
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:46,291
In fact, it might be
best to forgo defense entirely.

148
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,416
It's the only way.

149
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,416
I'll put all of my magic
power into my sword!

150
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:07,583
The blade that can't be
held without shedding all armor.

151
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,500
Come forth, Spectral Sword.

152
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,250
Crimson Blossom!

153
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,000
If I lose here, all of
Fairy Tail pays the price.

154
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,750
The fate of the guild
rests in my hands!

155
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:23,458
Yes!

156
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,916
Show me now!

157
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,958
[ERZA]
I can't afford to lose!

158
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,125
For the sake of my friends.

159
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,625
I'll end this
with one stroke.

160
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,958
Oh no!

161
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,500
You just
lost your chance.

162
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,250
Now face all the
power of Tenrou!

163
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,083
[ERZA]
I can't break free!

164
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,750
[AZUMA]
The outcry of the earth.

165
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,416
Terra Clamare!

166
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,000
The great Titania.

167
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,125
Finally falls.

168
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,791
Erza.

169
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,875
[NARRATOR] After Azuma
succeeded in uprooting

170
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,875
the Tenrou Tree, the
blessed protection magic

171
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,875
it was bestowing upon
the members of Fairy Tail,

172
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,666
swiftly vanished.

173
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,125
Suddenly, anyone bearing
the guild's emblem began

174
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,625
to lose their magic power.

175
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,708
With even Gildarts
and the Thunder Legion

176
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:28,875
out of commission, the fate of
Fairy Tail and Tenrou Island

177
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,250
now rests solely
on Erza's shoulders.

178
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:34,708
Alright.

179
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,291
We're getting nowhere fast.

180
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,708
Any luck?

181
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:38,750
Not here.

182
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,500
My magic power
is almost depleted.

183
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,666
But I can't figure out
what's causing me to lose it.

184
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,208
Stop the ride,
I wanna get off now.

185
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,875
This started after
that giant tree toppled over.

186
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,375
Do you think
there's a connection?

187
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,875
Yeah, maybe.

188
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,125
Whatever the reason is,

189
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,625
I don't think we're in
any position to fix it.

190
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,541
[HAPPY] Natsu, could you
carry me on your back

191
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,041
the rest of the way?

192
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,000
[NATSU] Sorry,
I've got a passenger.

193
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,750
And I'm afraid that he's
not lookin too good either.

194
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:05,791
This sucks.

195
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,833
Are we really stuck
here like this?

196
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,458
I hope it's just us.

197
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,625
If not, we're all
totally screwed.

198
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,291
What was that, Sir Siegrain?

199
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,208
I can barely hear you.

200
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,416
Jellal!

201
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,375
Or did that already
slip your feeble mind?

202
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,708
Siegrain is the fake name
he used when he was a member

203
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:32,750
of the Council.

204
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,166
Sorry, I guess
old habits die hard.

205
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,583
Look at him.

206
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,833
This is the guy who destroyed
our council building?

207
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,125
Cause to me, this dangerous
criminal looks more like

208
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,000
a caged stray dog.

209
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,083
[JELLAL]
Please hear my words.

210
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,791
[SERENA]
Whoa, do you...

211
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,208
Do you think he's trying
to cast a curse on us?

212
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:52,083
He couldn't cast
anything even if he wanted to.

213
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:55,791
As long as he's in here,
he's as weak as a newborn.

214
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,708
Wanna put him to the test?

215
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,416
What do you mean by that?

216
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,583
What'd I tell you?

217
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:09,125
He's nothing more than a
helpless animal in a cage.

218
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,750
Okay, you've had your fun.

219
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,125
Knock it off.

220
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:15,875
[NADARU]
I'm curious.

221
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,291
What were you mumbling
about just a moment ago?

222
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,125
Saying a prayer?

223
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,375
I just realized.

224
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,125
You probably haven't had
a decent meal since

225
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,375
you were brought here, have you?

226
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:39,416
Bet your stomach's
trying to eat itself.

227
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,958
Well, then.

228
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:44,000
If you say, "Please feed me,
Sir Nodaru" I might consider it.

229
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,916
Five little words and you'll be
feasting like a king in there.

230
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,500
That's enough.

231
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,291
[NADARU] However, if you don't
say it, I'll make sure the taste

232
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,625
of food becomes a bitter memory.

233
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,500
[NADARU]
Speak up.

234
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,125
[JELLAL]
Erza.

235
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,625
Don't give in.

236
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:12,958
You can do it, Erza.

237
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,125
What?

238
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,416
She lived!

239
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,708
That's impossible!

240
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,166
I hit her with all
of Tenrou's power!

241
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,250
[ERZA]
I heard Jellal's voice.

242
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,291
But how?

243
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,000
Was I just dreaming?

244
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:09,416
Stop it.

245
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,291
You don't have time
to be selfish.

246
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,708
Clear your head.

247
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,791
Don't cling to
phantoms and memories.

248
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,000
Now that you found
the strength to stand,

249
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,083
find what you need to win this.

250

[AZUMA]
Those eyes.

251
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,208
[ERZA]
I almost closed the distance.

252
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,791
Even if I get that close again,

253
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:14,625
I'm not sure I have enough
power to take him down.

254
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,666
But what I lack
in power, I make up for with

255
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,583
conviction and purpose.

256
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,416
Purpose he forced on me.

257
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,833
He's backed me into a corner,
and it'll be his downfall.

258
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,125
I will protect
what I hold dear.

259
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:33,333
The guild, my friends,
I will win for them...

260
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,958
I must!

261
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,125

I won't forget your
name as long as I live.

I'm Not done!

How 'bout we
make your last name Scarlet?

268
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,375
That's perfect!

269
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,583
Now I'm never gonna
forget your name.

270
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,833
All I gotta do is think
about your pretty hair.

271
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,291
[ERZA]
No!

272
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,708
[JELLAL] It was
The color of your hair.

00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,375
It won't end this way!

The power to
protect those close to her.
