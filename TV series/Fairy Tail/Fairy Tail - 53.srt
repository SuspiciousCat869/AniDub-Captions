00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,458
MAN.

13
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:11,833
- ONE?  IF THAT'S TRUE,

14
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:15,041
HOW CRAZY INTENSE
IS THIS GUY GONNA BE?

15
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,583
- AAH!

16
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:19,791
AAH!  AAH!

17
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,208

18
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,208

OW.

- ( groans )

22
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,333
- ( gasps )

23
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:31,500
- I'VE COME FROM
THE CAIT SHELTER GUILD.

24
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,916
MY NAME'S WENDY MARVELL.

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,375
IT'S NICE TO MEET
ALL OF YOU.

26
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:39,000
- Gray and Lyon:
A GIRL?

27
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,833
- Lucy and Sherry:
SHE'S A KID?

28
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,833
- SHE'S NOT HANDSOME.

29
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:45,875
- NOR IS SHE A MAN.
WHY SHOULD IT MATTER?

30
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,875
- WENDY.
- MARVELL-OUS.

31
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,958
- CUTE.

32

33
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,958

34
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,666
- Lyon: OBVIOUSLY NOT.

35
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,208
- Sherry: WHAT IN THE WORLD
IS CAIT SHELTER THINKING,

36
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,875
SENDING A LITTLE GIRL
ON THIS KIND OF MISSION?

37
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,875
THEY MUST REALLY
BE HURTING FOR MEMBERS

38
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,375
IF THEY SENT HER
HERE ON HER OWN.

39
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,041
- SHE ISN'T ALONE.

40
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:12,000
YOU SHOULDN'T JUMP
TO CONCLUSIONS, GAUDY TROLLOP.

41
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,458
- ( all gasp )

42
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,125
- OH!

43
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,791
- HMM!

44
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,666
- ( Happy speaking )

45
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,291
- WHAT IS THIS?
- A CAT.

46
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,208
- WHOA, SHE'S JUST LIKE HAPPY.

47
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,791
- SHE CAN TALK TOO?

48
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,583
- WHAT A STUPID CAT.
I'M NOT GAUDY.

49
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:35,875
- THAT'S YOUR BEEF?!

50
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,750
- OH, CARLA.
YOU FOLLOWED ME HERE?

51
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,958
- OF COURSE I DID.
YOU'RE FAR TOO YOUNG

52
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,875
TO BE TRAVELLING
UNACCOMPANIED, CHILD.

53
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,875
- All: PRETTY KITTY.

54
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,416
- YOU FLIRT WITH CATS TOO?!

55
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,375
- HMM?

56
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,541
- OH...

57
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,041
AAH!

58
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:55,416
THUMPITY-THUMP,
THUMPITY-THUMP!

59
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,875
( shouts )

60
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,916
( murmurs )

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,541
- HMM?

62
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,208
- LUCY, I'LL GIVE YOU MY FISH,

63
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,833
IF YOU TELL THAT VISION
I HAVEN'T BEEN NEUTERED YET.

64
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,875
- KEEP LOOKING UP
MY SKIRT, AND YOU WILL BE.

65
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,500
IT'S ABOUT TIME
THE LITTLE GUY GETS

66
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,166
A TASTE OF HIS OWN MEDICINE.

67
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,583
- ( murmurs excitedly )

68
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,666
- YOU LOVE HER!

69
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,500
- THAT'S MY SCHTICK, COPYCAT!

70
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,041
AND I DON'T LOOK NEARLY AS
CREEPY AS YOU DO WHEN I DO IT!

71
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,000
- SORRY.

72
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,541
I'M PROBABLY NOT
WHAT YOU EXPECTED.

73
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,541
I KNOW I'M MUCH SMALLER
AND YOUNGER THAN MOST OF YOU,

74
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,541
AND I MAY NOT BE
MUCH OF A FIGHTER,

75
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,958
BUT I CAN USE ALL KINDS
OF SUPPORT MAGIC.

76
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,125
SO, PLEASE,

77
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,708
LET ME JOIN THE GROUP.

78
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,041
I'D BE SO EMBARRASSED
IF YOU SENT ME HOME. 

79
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,500
- UH--

80
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,000
- All: UH...

81
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,458
- YOU'LL NEVER GAIN
THEIR RESPECT,

82
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,166
IF YOU CAN'T SHOW 
CONFIDENCE, CHILD.

83
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,625
- I'M SORRY, CARLA.

84
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,250
- I SWEAR, YOU'LL DRIVE ME
TO CATNIP.

85
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,708
- I CAN'T HELP IT.

86
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,083
- ( sighs )

87
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,500
- FORGIVE ME.
I WAS CAUGHT OFF-GUARD.

88
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,500
BUT REST ASSURED,
NO OFFENSE WAS MEANT.

89
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:57,166
WE'RE GLAD TO
HAVE YOU ABOARD, WENDY.

90
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,750
- ( exhales )

91
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,750
OH, WOW, YOU'RE ERZA, RIGHT?

92
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,541
I CAN'T BELIEVE 
IT'S REALLY YOU.

93
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,041
- YOU'RE NOT QUITE
THE MONSTER I PICTURED.

94
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,250
- SURELY YOU'VE HEARD OF
HAPPY THE CAT-MANDER.

95
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,875
BRACE YOURSELF,
'CAUSE HE'S RIGHT HERE.

96
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:13,291
SHE LOVES ME!
THIS MUST BE DESTINY!

97
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:16,500
- DESTINED TO BE REJECTED--
SHE'S TOTALLY IGNORING YOU.

98
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,125
- NAIVE COMMENTS LIKE THAT
PROVE YOU KNOW NOTHING

99
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,833
ABOUT WOMEN
AND THEIR WILD WAYS.

100
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,833
- I REALLY HATE
TO BREAK THIS TO YOU,

101
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,583
BUT I'M A WOMAN!

102
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,000
- THAT GIRL'S GONNA BE
GORGEOUS WHEN SHE GROWS UP.

103
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,125
- DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
HIBIKI WANTS TO WAIT.

104
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,375
- WOULD YOU PLEASE
COME WITH ME, LOVELY LADY?

105
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:32,583
- UM, OKAY.

106
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,750
- BAD TOUCH!

107
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,208
- HMM...

108
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,833
- YOU SENSED IT TOO.

109
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,458
THAT GIRL'S PARFUM
IS QUITE UNIQUE.

110
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,291
SHE IS NO ORDINARY CHILD.

111
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,166
- I SENSED THAT ABOUT HER
RIGHT AWAY.

112
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,375
THE MAGIC SHE POSSESSES IS
SOMEHOW DIFFERENT FROM OUR OWN.

113
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:49,000
IT SEEMS LADY ERZA
HAS NOTICED HER POWER AS WELL.

114
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,416
- IMPRESSIVE.

115
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,875
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?
- WE'RE PAMPERING A PRINCESS.

116
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,083
- YOU'RE THE CUTEST GIRL
I'VE SEEN ALL DAY.

117
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,500
- WOULD YOU LIKE TO FRESHEN UP?
- ( Wendy gasps )

118
00:05:58,583 --> 00:05:59,625
PLEASE HELP ME.

119
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,333
- JUST WHAT DO YOU
EXPECT ME TO DO?

120
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:04,041
- ( chuckles nervously )

121
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,666
- HMM...
- WOW. THINKING MUST BE PAINFUL.

122
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,916
- IT'S SO WEIRD. I FEEL
LIKE I'VE HEARD THAT

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,083
LITTLE GIRL'S NAME BEFORE,

124
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,750
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE.
- YEAH?

125
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,958
- GIVE IT A REST.
IT HURTS JUST WATCHING YOU.

126
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,916
- HEY, CAN YOU REMEMBER HER
FOR ME?

127
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,916
- SAY WHAT?!

128
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,750
- IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
WE CAN DO FOR YOU,

129
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,083
LOVELY PRINCESS?

130
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,583
- ( giggles )

131
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:26,958
- ( sighs )

132
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:30,083
SO, YOU GOT ANYTHING YET?
- WORKING ON IT.

133
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,708
- IT'S UN-LADYLIKE TO SMILE
AT STRANGE MEN, WENDY.

134
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,625
- BUT I WAS JUST BEING FRIENDLY!

135
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:35,916
- AHH...

136
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
- DO YOU LIKE YOUR MEN
BRASH OR PROPER?

137
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,791
- BRASH, RIGHT?
- YOU ARE JUST THE CUTEST.

138
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,041
- I TOLD YOU THREE,
THEY'RE HERE ON BUSINESS!

139
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:46,458
NOW CLEAN THIS PLACE UP!
- YES, DEAR MASTER, RIGHT AWAY!

140
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,333
- MAN...

141
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,500
- THOSE PRETTY BOYS KEEP
CALLING HIM DIFFERENT THINGS.

142
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,291
- THEY MAY NOT BE
THE BRIGHTEST,

143
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:55,125
BUT AT LEAST THEY'RE
CONSISTENTLY INCONSISTENT.

144
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,333
- OKAY, NOW THAT ALL THE
INVOLVED PARTIES ARE PRESENT,

145
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:03,166
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME TO GET
THE MISSION BRIEFING UNDERWAY.

146
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,833
- Lucy: YOU'RE GONNA BRIEF US
THROUGH INTERPRETIVE DANCE?

147
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:08,041
- OUR FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS,

148
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:11,333
IS DETERMINING THE LOCATION
OF THE ORACION SEIS.

149
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:12,625
- ( deeply sighs )

150
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,500
- RIGHT AFTER I MAKE
A LETTER OF THE ALPHABET.

151
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,125
- GREAT. IF HE'S MAKING THE
LETTER "POOP," I'M OUTTA HERE.

152
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,833
- WE'RE ROOTING
FOR YOU, TEACHER!

153
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,583
- PICK A TITLE, WOULD YOU?!

154
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,541
- PIRI PIRI!

155
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:33,500
- MUCH BETTER. NOW, PLEASE,
PAY CLOSE ATTENTION.

156
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,250
TO THE NORTH LIES 
THE WORTH WOODSEA,

157
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,416
WHERE THE ANCIENTS ONCE 
SEALED A POWERFUL FORCE.

158
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,666
A MAGIC CALLED NIRVANA!

159
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,875
- THOSE POSES ARE
GETTING REALLY OLD.

160
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,916
- Both: NIRVANA?

161
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,166
- ( slightly gasps )

162
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,750
- NEVER HEARD OF IT BEFORE.

163
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:54,166
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?
- NO.  I DO NOT.

164
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,125
- THIS CONVERSATION'S
BORING, HUH?

165
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,625
WANNA NOM ON MY MACKEREL?
- HEAVENS NO!

166
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,791
- WE DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT THIS MAGIC,

167
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,416
OTHER THAN ITS NAME.

168
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,625
AND THAT IT IS DESTRUCTIVE
IN NATURE.

169
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,375
- AND THAT THE ORACION SEIS
WANTS IT BADLY.

170
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,166
- DESTRUCTION MAGIC...

171
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,708
- OKAY, BAD FEELING CONFIRMED.

172
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,583
- MM.

173
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:17,791
- WE ASSUME THAT'S WHY THEY
TRAVELED TO THE WORTH WOODSEA.

174
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:21,583
THEY'RE DESPERATE TO GET THEIR 
HANDS ON SUCH A POWERFUL MAGIC.

175
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:24,375
- TO PREVENT THAT
FROM HAPPENING...

176
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,875
All: WE MUST DESTROY
THE ORACION SEIS!

177
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,750
- I'M SO OVER THE POSING.

178
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,666
- I THINK THEY'RE STARTING
TO GROW ON ME.

179
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,875
- WE MAY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE
IN NUMBERS,

180
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,666
BUT REMEMBER...
- WE CANNOT UNDERESTIMATE THEM.

181
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,333
- THEY'RE INCREDIBLY STRONG.

182
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,291
WE MAY WELL BE IN
OVER OUR HEADS.

183
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,583
- Jura: THAT'S ARCHIVE.

184
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,291
- Lyon: DON'T BELIEVE
I'VE SEEN IT IN USE BEFORE.

185
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,916
- Sherry:
AND IT DOES WHAT EXACTLY?

186
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
- STORING INFORMATION,
SUCH AS THESE PHOTOGRAPHS

187
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,583
OF OUR ENEMY.
DON'T ASK HOW WE GOT 'EM.

188
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:56,208
FIRST UP IS
THE SNAKE WIZARD. COBRA.

189
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,166
- BEADY EYES AND
A MISCHIEVOUS SMIRK.

190
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,708
HE LOOKS LIKE TROUBLE TO ME.

191
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,791
- TALK ABOUT THE POT
CALLING THE KETTLE BLACK.

192
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,750
- Hibiki: NEXT IS A WIZARD 
WHO, JUDGING FROM HIS NAME,

193
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:09,250
LIKELY USES SPEED MAGIC.
MEET RACER.

194
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,000
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS,

195
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,125
BUT I DON'T LIKE THE
LOOKS OF THIS GUY.

196
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,000
- I DON'T EITHER.

197
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,208
- Hibiki: THEN THERE'S A WIZARD
WHO'S WILLING TO WIPE OUT

198
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:19,875
AN ENTIRE MILITARY UNIT,
IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT.

199
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,791
"DIVINE EYES" HOTEYE.

200
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:25,208
- THE GUY KILLS FOR MONEY?
- TURNS MY STOMACH.

201
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,791
- Hibiki: SHE'S GORGEOUS,
BUT JUST AS VICIOUS.

202
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,375
THIS IS ANGEL.

203
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,125
- SHE'S THE BEAUTIFUL
BUT DEADLY TYPE, HUH?

204
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,625
IS THIS CHICK FOR REAL?

205
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,916
- Hibiki: THE NEXT MEMBER
IS SUCH A MYSTERY,

206
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,125
ALL WE KNOW IS HIS NAME--
MIDNIGHT.

207
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:41,541
- THAT'S AN ODD NAME.
DOES IT CORRELATE TO HIS POWER?

208
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,208
- Hibiki: FINALLY, THE
COMMANDER OF ORACION SEIS.

209
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,083
BRAIN.

210
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,500
THERE YOU HAVE IT.

211
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,041
ALONE THEY CAN WIPE OUT
ENTIRE GUILDS,

212
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,666
AND TOGETHER,
THEY'RE UNSTOPPABLE.

213
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,583
WE HAVE 12 TO THEIR SIX,
BUT THAT'S OUR ONLY ADVANTAGE.

214
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:58,125
- QUESTION-- CAN I VOLUNTEER TO
STAY BEHIND AND NOT DIE TODAY?

215
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,708
- I DON'T WANNA DIE EITHER,
SO MAY I PLEASE GO HOME?

216
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:03,583
- YOU MAY NOT!
WE HAVE A JOB TO DO, CHILD.

217
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,791
- SINCE THEY DIDN'T COUNT US,
YOU WANNA GET OUT OF HERE,

218
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,458
AND FIND SOME TRASH CANS
TO RAID?

219
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,500
- ( huffs )

220
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,333
- CURB YOUR FEAR, MY FRIENDS.

221
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,958
THERE IS MORE TO OUR OPERATION
THAN MORTAL COMBAT.

222
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,958
WITH YOUR HELP, PERHAPS WE CAN
FIND THE ENEMY'S STRONGHOLD.

223
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,083
- STRONGHOLD?

224
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,666
- YEAH, YOU HEARD THE MAN.

225
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,083
WE'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE,
BUT HAVE HAD NO LUCK.

226
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,708
- HERE'S THE DEAL: THEY'VE
GOTTA HAVE A TEMPORARY BASE

227
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,000
IN THE WORTH WOODSEA.

228
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,541
- AND ONCE WE'VE LOCATED IT,

229
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,416
OUR PLAN IS TO GATHER
THE ORACION SEIS INSIDE.

230
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,958
- HOW DO WE DO THAT?

231
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,708
- WE BEAT 'EM UP
AND DRAG THEIR BUTTS THERE!

232
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,125
- HE'S A LITTLE
TOO EXCITED ABOUT THIS.

233
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,291
- WHAT'S THE NEXT PART
OF THE PLAN?

234
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,791
- THEN WE'LL GIVE THEM
A ONE-WAY TICKET TO OBLIVION!

235
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:48,083
COURTESY OF CHRISTINA,
THE MAJESTIC PRIDE

236
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,541
OF THE BLUE PEGASUS GUILD.

237
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,375
- I'VE HEARD ABOUT
 THE MAGIC BOMBER,

238
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,166
BUT I THOUGHT
IT WAS JUST A MYTH.

239
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,416
- WHOA!  IS THAT NECESSARY?
THERE'S ONLY SIX OF 'EM.

240
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,125
- THAT'S THE TYPE
OF ENEMY WE FACE.

241
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,583
- SIR, YES, SIR!

242
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,458
- REMEMBER:
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE

243
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,916
SHOULD YOU EVER ENGAGE
THE ENEMY IN SOLO COMBAT.

244
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
OUR BEST BET
IS TO SEPARATE THEM,

245
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,000
THEN DEVOTE TWO WIZARDS
TO EACH FIGHT.

246
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,333
- ( all grunt in agreement )

247
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:14,166
- OH!  THIS IS
A TOTAL NIGHTMARE!

248
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,166
- I CAN'T TAKE THE PRESSURE.

249
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,958
- WOULD YOU TWO STOP 
ACTING LIKE CHILDREN?

250
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,666
- LET'S GO!
I'M ALL FIRED UP!

251
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,583
TIME TO HUNT ME SOME DEMONS.

252
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,958
READY OR NOT,
HERE I COME! 

253
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,708
- WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?!

254
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,291
- ALWAYS ACTING
WITHOUT A THOUGHT IN HIS HEAD.

255
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,916
- SOME DAYS I WONDER
ABOUT HIS MENTAL HEALTH.

256
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,541
- WHAT DO YOU GUYS WANNA BET 
HE DIDN'T EVEN HEAR THE PLAN?

257
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,916
- I'LL BET FIVE FISH HE DIDN'T.

258
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,000
- OVERKILL MUCH?

259
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,125
- YEAH, NO KIDDING.
- JUST GREAT.

260
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,625
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIX IT.

261
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,416
- ENOUGH GAWKING.
MOVE.

262
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,625
- GUESS WE'RE PLAYING CATCH-UP
WITH THAT DORK.

263
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,500
- AWW!  DO WE HAVE TO?

264
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,416
- DOUBLE TIME IT!
- QUIT CRYING!

265
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,875
- THEIR ENERGY'S AS INFECTIOUS
AS I REMEMBER.

266
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,916
READY, SHERRY?
- YEAH!

267
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,750
- WAIT, STAY TOGETHER.

268
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,833
- SO WE'RE HUNTING DEMONS? 
- MM-HMM.

269
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,708
- AND AN ANGEL TOO.

270
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,416
- ( murmurs )
- PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER, CHILD!

271
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,625
- HAVE NO FEAR!

272
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,166
'CAUSE THE CAT-MANDER'S HERE!

273
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,500
- YOU'LL BE THE DEATH OF ME.
- SORRY, CARLA.

274
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,666
- ( murmurs )

275
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,083
WAIT FOR ME!

276
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,583
YOU NEED A MAN 
TO PROTECT YOU!

277
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,166
- I'M TOO OLD FOR THIS.
- MAN...

278
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,791
- IN ANY CASE, THE OPERATION
IS NOW UNDERWAY.

279
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,583
WE SHOULD JOIN
THE OTHERS QUICKLY.

280
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:40,000
- SLOW YOUR ROLL, SHINY DOME.

281
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,541
I'VE HEARD THROUGH
THE GRAPEVINE

282
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,541
THAT YOU'RE ONE OF
THE 10 WIZARD SAINTS.

283
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,000
WOULD THIS STATEMENT BE TRUE?

284
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,666
- INDEED, I AM.

285
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,666
- IT'S QUITE A PRIVILEGE
TO FIGHT ALONGSIDE

286
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,666
SOMEONE AS SKILLED
AS MASTER MAKAROV.

287
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,333
- I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR.

288
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,750
THOUGH I AM HONORED TO
BEAR THE TITLE,

289
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,583
IT IS GIVEN TO WHOMEVER
THE COUNCIL DEEMS WORTHY.

290
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:00,166
EQUATING MYSELF WITH MAKAROV
IS TANTAMOUNT

291
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,000
TO COMPARING
THE HEAVENS TO THE EARTH.

292
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,833
I'M SURE YOU CAN GUESS
WHICH APPLIES TO ME.

293
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,416
- I SEE.

294
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,083
THAT MIGHT BE THE BEST
NEWS I'VE HEARD ALL DAY.

295
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,708
IF YOU WERE AS POWERFUL
AS THAT FOSSIL,

296
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,708
IT WOULD MAKE MY JOB
FAR MORE DIFFICULT. 

297
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,125
- ( groans )
WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

298
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,333
AAH!
( gags, coughs )

299
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:20,125
- THIS PARTICULAR PARFUM

300
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,750
CAUSES AN OPPONENT TO LOSE
THEIR WILL TO FIGHT.

301
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,083
- ( groaning, coughing )

302
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,916
ICHIYA, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

303
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,416
- PIRI PIRI...

304
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,083
- ( groans )
AAH!

305
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:36,708
- THAT'S MORE LIKE IT. DROWN IN
RELENTLESS PAIN AND TORMENT.

306
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,666
ARE YOU ENJOYING THE POTENT
EFFECTS OF MY LITTLE FRAGRANCE?

307
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,208
- AAH!
- OOPS, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

308
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,375
I MEANT PARFUM!

309
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,708
- WE'RE BACK TO NORMAL!

310
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,541
- YUCK, THAT MIDGET'S HEAD
WAS FILLED WITH PERVERTED STUFF.

311
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,833
- DON'T REMIND ME, BROTHER.

312
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,333
GROWN-UPS CAN BE SO GROSS.

313
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:59,083
- NO COMPLAINING.
YOU'RE NOT DONE YET.

314
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,000
- PIRI PIRI...

315
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,166
- NO, NOT YOU!

316
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,250
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

317
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,083
- OH, ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

318
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,958
YOU'VE BEEN DUPED, DARLING.

319
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,708
WE COPIED YOUR COMRADE--

320
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,291
FROM HIS DUMPY LITTLE BODY

321
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,375
TO EVERY THOUGHT
IN HIS PERVERTED MIND.

322
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,250
- NOW WE KNOW YOUR PLAN.

323
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,250
- YOU CAN'T HIDE 
ANYTHING FROM US.

324
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,500
- NO...

325
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:19,750
- YES.

326
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,041
TWO DOWN,
AND ONLY 10 TO GO.

327
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,125
- ( groaning )

328
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,958
- ( groans )
- PIRI PIRI...

329
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,583
- ( laughs )
LET THIS BE A LESSON TO YOU,

330
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,083
CHILDREN OF LIGHT,

331
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:35,625
THERE'S NO STOPPING
THE ORACION SEIS.

332
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,000
- THERE IT IS.

333
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,833
- WAIT UP, NUMBSKULL!
- YEAH, IN YOUR DREAMS.

334
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,166
- THAT'S AN ORDER!

335
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,000
YOU CAN'T RUSH INTO
THIS ONE ALONE.

336
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,500
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
ARE YOU AFRAID

337
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:52,833
I MIGHT ACTUALLY
SHOW YOU UP THIS TIME?

338
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,083
- SAY WHAT?!

339
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,291
STOP MOVING YOUR FEET
RIGHT NOW!

340
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,708
- I WAS JUST KIDDING AROUND!

341
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,833
AAH!

342
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,625
- WELL, HE STOPPED
MOVING HIS FEET.

343
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,250
- IF HE'S NOT DEAD,
I'LL KILL HIM.

344
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,791
- I SEE HE HASN'T CHANGED
AT ALL.

345
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,166
- TO THINK, I ONCE CROSSED
FISTS WITH THAT FOOL.

346
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,125
IT'S KIND OF EMBARRASSING NOW.

347
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,541
- IT'S ANOTHER FORM
OF LOVE.

348
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,208
- YEAH, NOT QUITE.

349
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,833
- WAHH!  I CAN'T BELIEVE
THOSE JERKS RAN OFF

350
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,000
AND LEFT ME TO FEND
FOR MYSELF.

351
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,916
WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO LADIES FIRST, HUH?

352
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,083
- A GEM LIKE YOU
SHOULD BE TREATED WITH CARE.

353
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,458
- WHAT CAN I DO
TO MAKE YOU SMILE, DEAR?

354
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:27,875
- STAY AT MY SIDE,
THAT'S AN ORDER.

355
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:28,875
- CREEPY!

356
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,500
- QUIT LOLLYGAGGING, WENDY.

357
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,291
HURRY UP!
- I'M TRYING.

358
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,250
- HAPPY'S AIR SERVICE CAN HELP!

359
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,458
- ( groans )
MY HEAD'S KILLING ME.

360
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:40,500
WHAT'S WITH THIS FOREST?
IT SURE HAS A FUNKY SMELL TO IT.

361
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,916
- SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT HERE.
- NO KIDDING.

362
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,583
IT'S LIKE THE DEEPER
WE GO INTO IT,

363
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:45,875
THE SPOOKIER IT GETS.

364
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,708
- KEEP YOUR GUARD UP,
UNDERSTAND?

365
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:48,666
- YEAH.

366
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,416
- Natsu:
YOU FINALLY CAUGHT UP.

367
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,375
- YOU'RE ONE STURDY FREAK,
YOU KNOW THAT?

368
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,625
- WHOA!

369
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,333
AAH!

370
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,166
SO WE'RE PULLING
CHEAP SHOTS NOW, ARE WE?!

371
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,291
- IF I WANTED A PIECE OF YOU,
I'D TAKE YOU HEAD-ON.

372
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,416
- FOCUS!

373
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,666
- Gray and Natsu:
WHOA!

374
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,625
- Sherry: LYON?
- I SEE IT.

375
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,708
- Erza:
THAT'S THE MAGIC BOMBER--

376
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,333
CHRISTINA.

377
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,166
- Natsu: I WANT ONE!

378
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,125
- Gray: IT DEFINITELY
LIVES UP TO THE HYPE.

379
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,833
- WHOA...

380
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,291
- THAT'S SO COOL.
- HORSES CAN FLY TOO?

381
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,625
- PLEASE REFRAIN FROM
OPENING YOUR MOUTH AGAIN.

382
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,250
- Erza:
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SPLIT UP

383
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,041
AND START SEARCHING FOR
THEIR TEMPORARY BASE.

384
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,458
- Natsu:
I'M FLYING THE BOMBER THING!

385
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,500
- Gray:
NOT HAPPENING.

386
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,791
- ( all gasp )
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH CHRISTINA?

387
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,583
- ( all gasp )
- OH, NO!

388
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,333
- THIS DOESN'T BODE WELL.

389
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:03,958
- ( sniffs )

390
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,750
GRAY.
- I KNOW.

391
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,000
WE'VE GOT COMPANY.

392
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,166
EVERYONE STAY FROSTY.

393
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,458
- I CAN'T DO THIS.
- DON'T HIDE!

394
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,916
- YEAH, IT'S GOTTA BE THEM.

395
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
THE ORACION SEIS.

396
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,875
- LOWLY MAGGOTS
SWARMING TOGETHER.

397
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:59,291
- I'M AFRAID SHORT-STUFF ISN'T
GOING TO MAKE IT TO THE PARTY.

398
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,625
- AND NEITHER IS THAT
BIG, BALD WIZARD SAINT.

399
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,250
- WE TOOK 'EM DOWN!

400
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,000
- THEY'RE DEFEATED?
- IMPOSSIBLE.

401
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,208
- THERE'S TERROR
IN THEIR VOICES.

402
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,750
I CAN HEAR IT.

403
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,375
- THE QUICKER WE WRAP THIS UP,
THE BETTER.

404
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,125
I'LL RUN YOU OVER SO FAST,
IT'LL MAKE YOUR HEAD SPIN.

405
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,750
- MONEY DETERMINES STRENGTH
IN THIS WORLD.

406
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,583
OH, YEAH!  IF YOU SAVE
BUT A PENNY TODAY,

407
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,083
IT SHALL BECOME
A VAST FORTUNE IN THE FUTURE.

408
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,166
FURTHERMORE--

409
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,000
- ENOUGH WITH THE
PREACHING, HOTEYE.

410
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,125
- ( snoring )

411
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:30,375
- IS IT SAD THAT I'M TERRIFIED
OF THE SNORING GUY?

412
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:33,208
- I HAVE TO ADMIT, I DIDN'T
EXPECT YOU TO SHOW YOURSELVES.

413
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:38,750
- ( bones crack )
- READY?

414
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,000
- YOU BET.

415
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,666
- ( chuckles )
WANT AN INVITATION?

416
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,291
- Both: YOU BEING HERE
IS ENOUGH FOR US!

417
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,541
- TAKE THEM.
- YES, SIR. 

418
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,041
MOTOR!

419
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,833
- Both: NATSU, GRAY!

420
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,250
HUH?

421
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,958
- SURPRISE!
- WHY AM I WHIPPING MYSELF?!

422
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,250
WHAT'S GOING ON?!
( sobs )

423
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,250
- ( chuckles )

424
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,916
- SHERRY!
- RIGHT! 

425
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:09,875
- I SEE YOU!
OH, YEAH!

426
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,166
FORGET LOVE;
ALL YOU NEED IS MONEY.

427
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,750
MONEY'S ALL YOU NEED.

428
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,791
- WHAT IS THIS STUFF?
QUICKSAND?

429
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,625
- HOW DARE HE SAY
LOVE IS LESS IMPORTANT?

430
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,500
GRAB MY HAND, LOVE!

431
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,833
- I'LL TAKE CARE OF ANGEL.
- HEY, NO DIBS!

432
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,500
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY "TAKE CARE"?

433
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,333
- ( whirring )

434
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,958
- AAH!

435
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,166
- REN!

436
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,666
AAH!

437
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,625
- EVE, YOU OKAY?

438
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:38,250
HOW?  HE'S SO FAST.
I DIDN'T EVEN SEE IT.

439
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,458
- IF YOU'RE SLOW,
YOU'LL BE EATING MY DUST.

440
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:45,708
- REQUIP!

441
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,916
- THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

442
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,166
- DANCE, MY SWORDS!
PIERCE AND REND!

443
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,291
NO...

444
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,500
HE DODGED THEM ALL.

445
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,083
CAN HE READ MY ATTACKS?

446
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,125
- ( pants )
COME ON.

447
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,000
- ( snoring )
- SERIOUSLY?!

448
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,291
QUIT SAWING LOGS
AND PUT UP YOUR STUPID FISTS!

449
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,125
- REQUIP!
FLIGHT ARMOR!

450
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,125
( grunts )

451
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,416
- THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

452
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,958
YEAH.  I LIKE FAST WOMEN.

453
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,833
- IT'S NO USE.

454
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:19,291
I CAN HEAR YOUR NEXT MOVE,
TITANIA.

455
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,041
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
GIVE UP NOW!

456
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,291
- HE IS READING ME.
BUT HOW?!

457
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,708
- YOU LOOK CONFUSED.

458
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,333
HAVING TROUBLE FIGURING IT OUT?

459
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:31,416
I TOLD YOU,
I HEAR EVERYTHING.

460
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,208
- WAKEY WAKEY!

461
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,625
WHAT?!  YOU GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME!

462
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,875
HE SHOULD BE BARBECUED
RIGHT NOW.

463
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:46,333
- CAREFUL.
- ( grunts )

464
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,166
- IF YOU WAKE HIM UP,
IT'S GONNA BE YOUR NIGHTMARE!

465
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,083
- AAH!

466
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,416
- ICE MAKE LANCE!

467
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,166
- DITTO!

468
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,625
- ICE MAKE EAGLE!
- MARIONETTE ATTACK!

469
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,375
MUD DOLL!

470

YOUR MUSCLES CONTRACTING
EVERY BREATH THAT YOU TAKE IN,

478
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,958
AND ALL YOUR THOUGHTS.

BUT THAT WON'T SAVE YOU
FROM CUBELLIOS' POISON.

488

506
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,625
- Natsu: LYING ON THE GROUND
IS PART OF MY STRATEGY.

507
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,625
- WELL, THE "LYING" PART
IS TRUE, AT LEAST.

508
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:23,625
- I HAVEN'T LOST
UNTIL I SAY I HAVE.

509
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:26,041
ONCE I'M ON MY FEET,
THEY'RE GOING DOWN IN FLAMES!

510
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:28,666
- AND YOU'LL GET BEAT AGAIN, 
JUST LIKE ALL YOUR REMATCHES.

- ( Natsu and Happy speaking )

513
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:35,083
- Natsu: WHEN HAVE I EVER
LOST A REMATCH?!

514
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:36,666
- Happy: SERIOUSLY?!
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?!

515
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,916
- ( scoffs ) I ALWAYS THOUGHT
OF THOSE AS DRAWS.

516
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,291
- MUST BE NICE
LIVING IN TOTAL DELUSION.
