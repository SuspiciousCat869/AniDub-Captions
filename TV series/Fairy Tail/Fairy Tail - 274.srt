00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,791
Please, we don't have much time!

163
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:39,083
Yes, yes. You just calm
right down, young man.

164
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:44,708
[OLD HAG A] Looks like this
must've been a real disaster.

165
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,166
Yeah.

166
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,750
I can still feel it.

167
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:51,916
The traces of an immense
spell remain in this place.

168
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,208
I'm back. How's Mavis doing?

169
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,208
She still hasn't
opened her eyes.

170
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,750
Who might this be?

171
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,125
She's one of the elders from
a nearby town's wizard guild.

172
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,333
I'm basically a doctor
who specializes

173
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,791
in treating wizards
injured by magic.

174
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,000
Now, let me have a look.

175
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:14,833
Well, this little thing
brought down a giant dragon?

176
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:29,083
I can't believe someone so young
used such a tremendous spell.

177
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,000
That great blast of
light was visible

178
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,666
all the way over in our town.

179
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,666
We all saw it.

180
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,666
Well? Is she all right?

181
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,625
Say something!

182
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,250
Hey! Stop it!

183
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,375
Let her concentrate.

184
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,083
What's wrong?

185
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,833
This worse than I
could have imagined.

186
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,083
What is it?

187
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,541
Please, you have to tell us!

188
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:25,166
It's a good thing Yuri
isn't awake. Considering.

189
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,750
Yeah, that poor guy.

190
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:31,041
He's gonna have one heck of a
wake up call, that's for sure.

191
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:35,041
[PRECHT] Well, I just hope he
doesn't take the news too hard.

192
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,500
Welcome back to the
land of the living.

193
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,416
[YURI]
Where are we?

194
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,166
[WARROD]
An inn, in Magnolia.

195
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,333
[PRECHT]
Yuri! You're awake!

196
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,791
Are you feeling all right?

197
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:54,708
Yeah.

198
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:55,541
[YURI groans]

199
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:56,541
[PRECHT]
What's the matter?

200
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,666
Oh, it's probably nothing.

201
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,375
I just have a really killer
headache, that's all.

202
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,958
That makes sense,
considering what happened.

203
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,625
The Tenrou Orb's curse
took you over completely.

204
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,958
It was ugly.

205
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,166
[gasps]

206
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,625
Where's Mavis?

207
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:22,083
Please say something.
Where is she?

208
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,791
[WARROD] Well, technically,
she isn't harmed.

209
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:31,916
But she had to use an
insanely powerful spell.

210
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,291
It was the only way
to break the curse.

211
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,833
[PRECHT] All of the doctors
in the city examined her,

212
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,833
and no one could do anything.

213
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:43,791
We even brought in a specialist
from a nearby wizard guild.

214
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,166
What are you getting at?

215
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,125
Why won't you tell me
what's happened to her?!

216
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,291
[PRECHT] We're telling
you everything we know.

217
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:53,041
Just calm down and listen.

218
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,125
[PRECHT]
The specialist said that this is

219
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:00,000
the price she must pay for
using such a dangerous spell

220
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,208
before having mastered it.

221
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,500
[PRECHT]
Mavis' body won't grow anymore.

222
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:21,708
She'll stay as small as she is
now for the rest of her life.

223
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,083
Yuri!

224
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:29,833
Thank goodness! I'm so
glad to see you awake!

225
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:42,750
But how? How can
you be so happy?

226
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,666
You'll never grow because of me.

227
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,666
Nothing that happened
is your fault.

228
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,916
I knew there were risks,
and I don't regret it.

229
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,750
I'm just grateful
that you're all right.

230
00:17:56,833 --> 00:18:00,708
I don't deserve it. You didn't
have to do this for me!

231
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,250
I did.

232
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:05,291
You're my friend, and I would
do it again in a heartbeat.

233
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,708
Don't say that!

234
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:10,250
This whole time I was just
trying to get to the orb!

235
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,291
I was using you.

236
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,083
[YURI cries]

237
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:21,791
[YURI]
Forgive me. Please.

238
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,250
I'm so sorry, Mavis.

239
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:27,500
Please don't cry.
It's not like you.

240
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,375
[YURI]
So you're not hurt or anything?

241
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,958
I'm not.

242
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,875
I never felt an instant of pain
throughout all that happened.

243
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:51,458
I won't grow anymore,
but other than that I'm fine.

244
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,166
[YURI]
Listen.

245
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,083
When I was under the
Tenrou Orb's control,

246
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,666
I was certain I
heard your voice.

247
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,041
[MAVIS]
What?

248
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:08,250
I still hear it. You said
we're friends, always.

249
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,916
I meant it. That's how I feel.

250
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,041
Yeah, me too.

251
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,291
After all we've been
through together,

252
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,625
I could never call you
anything but my friend.

253
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,833
You really mean that?

254
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,916
Once things have quieted down,

255
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,500
you and me, we should go
look for fairies together.

256
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,500
[MAVIS]
What?

257
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,083
Are you totally sure
you're okay, Yuri?

258
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:33,250
You're not just saying that
'cause you feel guilty, are you?

259
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,250
[YURI]
No.

260
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,458
You're not like anyone
I've ever met.

261
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:43,500
I feel like just the same
as with Precht and Warrod,

262
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,333
I can trust you with my heart.

263
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,375
There are very few truly
trustworthy people

264
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,791
in this world.

265
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,208
[YURI] You risked your
life to save mine.

266
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,666
I wanna repay you by helping
you realize your dream.

267
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,416
Well, thank you.

268
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,916
But I want you to
find your own dream

269
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,291
and pursue that for yourself.

270
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,125
It's your life.

271
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,125
Well, from now on,

272
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,083
my dream is to always protect
you, no matter the cost.

273
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:14,041
To trust you and put
all my faith in you.

274
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,333
You and I may have come
from different worlds...

275
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:22,000
...but I'll be beside
you for life.

276
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,083
Thanks!

277
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,583
[YURI]
There's more, Mavis.

278
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,958
Because I'm your friend...

279
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,500
...there's something
that I have to tell you.

280
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,500
[MAVIS]
Huh?

281
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,416
[YURI]
It's about Zera.

282
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,958
[MAVIS]
What do you mean? Is she okay?

283
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:14,125
[YURI]
Zera. You're listening, right?

284
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,500
Zera! Why were you hiding again?

285
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:44,291
I can't believe you would
still be so shy around Yuri.

286
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,083
[MAVIS]
What's wrong?

287
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,125
Mavis.

288
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,500
[MAVIS]
Yes?

289
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,750
I've never been
able to see Zera.

290
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,916
[MAVIS]
Huh...?

291
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,166
[YURI]
And I can't hear her speak.

292
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,583
At all.

293
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:13,625
And it's not just me.
The other guys can't either.

294
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,125
None of us have ever
seen or heard her.

295
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,708
I'm sorry to have
to tell you this now.

296
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,041
[MAVIS gasps]

297
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:26,541
[YURI] You're the only one
who can perceive her.

298
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:29,458
Because she's an
illusion you created.

299
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,208
She's not real.

300
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:16,291
[MAVIS] Zera is an illusion
I created out of loneliness.

301
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:19,583
All I can do is cry in the
face of this shocking news.

302
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,541
She died that night
when we were children.

303
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:23,708
As Zera fades away,

304
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:25,458
she leaves me with
words of encouragement

305
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:28,416
so I can move forward on my own.

306
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,041
The story that began with a girl

307
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:33,208
who had less than zero
reaches its conclusion,

308
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,916
and I go forth on a new path.

309
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,625
Next Time: "Eternal Adventure."

310
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:41,458
The tale of the beginning
comes to an end.
