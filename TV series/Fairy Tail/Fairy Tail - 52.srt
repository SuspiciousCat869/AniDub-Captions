1
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,250
- Narrator: HARGEON HAS
MANY FINE RESTAURANTS,

2
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:21,750
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING MAGICAL

3
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,416
ABOUT THIS NEWEST ADDITION,

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,041
"8 ISLAND."
- Lucy: WELCOME.

5
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:28,541
I'D BE SO HAPPY
TO TAKE YOUR ORDER.

6
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:32,041
- THANKS.  I'D LIKE
THE BLUE SKY MEAT SAUCE

7
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,958
AND SOME HOLY SODA WITH ICE.

8
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:36,583
- BEASTMAN CURRY FOR ME,
PLEASE.

9
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,750
- SURE, BOTH GREAT CHOICES.

10
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,958
CAN I INTEREST YOU
IN SOME DESSERT AS WELL?

11
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,000
- ( singing in Japanese )

12
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,250
- YEAH, I THINK

13
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:15,750
I'M GONNA TRY
THE RUBY PARFAIT.

14
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:19,541
- MAKE THAT TWO.
- COMING RIGHT UP.

15
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,500
- CAN I GET SOME
SERVICE TOO, MISS?

16
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,083
- YES, SIR.

17
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,000
AHH! WAIT!

18
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,708
WHAT AM I DOING
WAITRESSING?!

19
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,250
- Natsu: LUCY.
- YEAH, WHAT?

20
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,666
- YOU'RE WORKING A JOB
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

21
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,208
- SINCE WHEN DOES
WAITING TABLES

22
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,250
QUALIFY AS
LEGITIMATE WIZARD WORK?

23
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,375
AND WHY DO I HAVE
TO WEAR THIS HORRIBLE OUTFIT?

24
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,541
- NOT MY IDEA.

25
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,625
- I MEAN, I KNOW
I CAN ROCK THIS UNIFORM,

26
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,500
BUT STILL.
- WHATEVER.

27
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:45,958
- THE CHEF HERE AT "8 ISLAND"

28
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,291
USES MAGIC TO COOK ALL
OF HIS TASTY DISHES.

29
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,083
SO HE THOUGHT IT'D
BE KIND OF COOL

30
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,166
IF THE WAIT STAFF WERE
MAGIC USERS AS WELL.

31
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,166
- Natsu: ( chewing )
GEEZ, LUCY.

32
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,916
WE AGREED TO TAKE THIS
JOB FOR YOU, REMEMBER?

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,166
- ( gasping )

34
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,583
- YOU SHOULDN'T BE EATING
THE CUSTOMER'S FOOD.

35
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,833
- BUT THROWING TRAYS IS OKAY?
- Gray: LIGHTEN UP.

36
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,666
THE UNIFORMS
AREN'T ALL THAT BAD

37
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,041
IF YOU ASK ME.

38
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,541
- YOU'RE BARELY
EVEN WEARING ONE.

39
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,083
- WATCH IT.  DON'T YOU FORGET

40
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,333
THAT WE'RE DOING THIS
TO PAY YOUR RENT.

41
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:18,083
- UGH, YEAH, I KNOW.

42
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,583
- EH, IT'S COOL.
LOOK THERE.

43
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,208
- HUH?

44
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,708
- I KNOW YOU WANT SOMETHING.

45
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,708
ISN'T THAT TRUE?

46
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,666
NOW TELL ME.

47
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,458
- YEAH, I-- UH...

48
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,166
- WE'LL HAVE A...
- JUST GIVE US...

49
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,208
- YES, WE'LL TAKE 
ONE OF EVERYTHING.

50
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,458
- WELL NOW,
THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

51
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:52,750
I AM TRULY GRATEFUL.
- OUR PLEASURE, MA'AM.

52
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,125
- THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT,
I GUESS.

53
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,791
- SEEMS TO WORK PRETTY WELL.

54
00:03:56,875 --> 00:04:00,958
- AH, YES, THE THRILL
OF A NEW CHALLENGE.

55
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,333
- ( Happy speaking )

56
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,500
- Yajima:
TOP-NOTCH JOB TODAY, KIDS.

57
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,000
GOT TO SAY, I'M MOST
PLEASANTLY SURPRISED

58
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,083
BY ALL YOUR HARD WORK.

59
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,666
YOU'RE WELCOME HERE ANY TIME.

60
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,208
- THANK YOU.

61
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,125
WE'VE LEARNED MUCH
FROM THIS EXPERIENCE.

62
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,708
- AND WHAT WAS THAT?
"YOU LOVE CLOTHES"?

63
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,916
- Gray: NOW I KNOW HOW TIRED
MIRA MUST BE AFTER WORK.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,083
- Natsu: AND HOW STUFFED
HER BELLY MUST BE.

65
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,416
- SHE SERVES THE FOOD
INSTEAD OF EATING IT ALL.

66
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,041
- WELL, THAT'S HER LOSS.
- AND YOUR WEIGHT GAIN. 

67
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,458
- IF I MAY ASK YOU, SIR,

68
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,708
WHAT IS THE STATE OF
THE MAGIC COUNCIL THESE DAYS?

69
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:44,416
- WELL, OF COURSE I STEPPED DOWN
SOME TIME AGO.

70
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,458
- THE MAGIC COUNCIL?!

71
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,333
- WHAT THE HECK'S
GOTTEN INTO YOU TWO?

72
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:51,541
DID YOU DUNCES FORGET
MR. YAJIMA WAS A MEMBER?

73
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,958
- ( gasps )

74
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:58,166
- AFTER ZIEG-- OR WAIT,
WAS HIS NAME ZELLAL?

75
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,500
- YOU MEAN JELLAL?
- AH, YES.

76
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:06,083
AFTER HE AND THAT OTHER
INTERLOPER ULTEAR

77
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,666
THREW EVERYTHING INTO DISARRAY,

78
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,750
I PARTED WAYS WITH
THE ORGANIZATION.

79
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,458
I'M NOT USUALLY
ONE FOR GOSSIP,

80
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,208
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN RUMORS
GOING AROUND LATELY

81
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,000
THAT A PLAN TO REESTABLISH

82
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,416
THE MAGIC COUNCIL
IS IN THE WORKS. 

83
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,875
OUR IGNORANCE AND
MISGUIDED ACTIONS

84
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,041
CAUSED YOU
A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE.

85
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,583
I AM TRULY SORRY.

86
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,375
- IT'S FINE.
THEY SAY YOU STOOD YOUR GROUND

87
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,458
IN OPPOSITION TO FIRING
THE ETHERION

88
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,958
RIGHT UNTIL THE VERY END.

89
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:37,208
YOUR CONVICTION IS ADMIRABLE.

90
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,708
- POLITICS JUST ISN'T MY THING.

91
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,250
BUT COOKING...

92
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,333
WHOO! HOO!

93
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:46,166
OH BOY! HA HA!

94
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,583
THAT WAS WHAT
I WAS BORN TO DO.

95
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:55,083
BY THE WAY, YOU BOYS
LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY.

96
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:58,500
NOW I EXPECT THIS NEW COUNCIL
TO BE QUITE DIFFERENT.

97
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,875
I WILL NO LONGER BE THERE.

98
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:04,166
I TOOK A LAX ATTITUDE TOWARD
FAIRY TAIL'S HIJINKS.

99
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,000
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?!

100
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:09,166
DON'T TEST THEIR PATIENCE
WITH YOUR CARELESS DESTRUCTION!

101
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,416
- NO, WE PROMISE
WE WON'T, SIR.

102
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,125
- HMM.

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,208
SAY HELLO TO MAKI FOR ME,
WILL YOU, HUH?

104
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,583
- AYE.
- WE CERTAINLY WILL, SIR.

105
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,458
AND THANKS AGAIN
FOR THE WORK.

106
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,875
- ULTEAR...

107
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,875
WHO KNOWS WHERE
SHE MAY BE HIDING?

108
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,750
- Narrator:
THIS OMINOUS AIRSHIP

109
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:45,208
BELONGS TO THE DARK GUILD,
"GRIMOIRE HEART."

110
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:58,541
- <i>ORACION SEIS,</i> HUH?
THEY'RE MAKING THEIR MOVE.

111
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,333
- Narrator: AND THIS WOMAN
IS THE FORMER COUNCIL MEMBER

112
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,041
IN QUESTION, ULTEAR.
IT TURNS OUT,

113
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,541
SHE WAS ACTUALLY A MEMBER

114
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,375
OF THE AFOREMENTIONED
DARK GUILD ALL ALONG.

115
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:12,333
- SO, MASTER HADES,
HOW SHALL WE RESPOND?

116
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:16,125
- WE SHALL ALLOW THEM
TO DO AS THEY PLEASE FOR NOW.

117
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:19,416
SURELY THOSE ON THE OTHER SIDE
WILL NOT STAND IDLY BY.

118
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,208
AND IN THE CONFUSION THAT
WILL ENSUE FROM THEIR CLASH,

119
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,208
WE WILL TAKE
THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOCATE

120
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,041
THE REMAINING KEYS
TO ZEREF'S SEAL.

121
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,583
AND IF FORTUNE
SHOULD TRULY SMILE ON US,

122
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,125
PERHAPS SOME OF OUR RIVALS
MAY BE ELIMINATED

123
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,666
IN THE PROCESS AS WELL.

124
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,833
- SUCH AS FAIRY TAIL PERHAPS?

125
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,875
- ( chuckles )

126
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,833
- Lucy: WHAT'S ALL THIS?

127
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,875
- Mirajane: IT'S A CHART
LISTING OUT THE DARK GUILDS.

128
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,375
- <i>OUI.</i> SHE HAD ME 
DRAW IT UP FOR HER.

129
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,833
- A TROUBLING SIGHT.

130
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,250
THERE ARE FAR MORE
THAN I'D REALIZED.

131
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,375
- WHAT BROUGHT THIS ON?

132
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,000
- UNFORTUNATELY, THEY'VE BEEN

133
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,916
NOTICEABLY MORE
ACTIVE AS OF LATE.

134
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,375
- THAT MEANS WE NEED TO 
STRENGTHEN RELATIONSHIPS

135
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,458
WITH OUR FELLOW GUILDS.
- OH.

136
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:09,291
- WHAT'S THE BIG CIRCLE
IN THE MIDDLE SUPPOSED TO BE?

137
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,291
- Juvia: I KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.

138
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,791
IT'S THE BARAM ALLIANCE
OF DARK GUILDS.

139
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,250
- ( gasps )
- Juvia: THE THREE MAJOR PLAYERS

140
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,541
IN THAT ALLIANCE 
ARE ORACION SEIS,

141
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:22,250
TARTAROS, AND GRIMOIRE HEART.

142
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,250
ALL POWERFUL
IN THEIR OWN RIGHT,

143
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,000
BUT COMBINED,
THEY'RE THE STRONGEST FORCE

144
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,000
IN THE SHADOWY GUILD UNDERWORLD.

145
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:31,333
EACH CONTROLS LESSER GUILDS
THAT CARRY OUT THE DIRTY WORK

146
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,208
THEY DON'T WISH
TO DO THEMSELVES.

147
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:36,708
HOWEVER, THERE IS ONE ON THIS
CHART WHO REMAINS INDEPENDENT.

148
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,375
RAVEN TAIL.

149
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,375
- OH, MAN...

150
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,958
I RECOGNIZE
THE NAME EISENWALD.

151
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,458
- I'M SURE.

152
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,916
THAT'S THE GUILD
ERIGOR BELONGED TO.

153
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,625
- ( silent )

154
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,416
- SO EISENWALD WAS ACTUALLY

155
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,916
JUST A KIND OF SUB-GUILD

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,916
THAT WORKED UNDER 
THIS ORACION SEIS?

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,916
- Wakaba: I'VE SEEN A LOT
OF THESE NAMES BEFORE.

158
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,541
- Macao: I THINK SOME OF THEM
EVEN USED TO BE LEGIT.

159
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,916
- Mirajane: THERE WAS ONE MORE,
GHOUL SPIRIT,

160
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,833
WHICH THE THUNDER LEGION
TOOK OUT.

161
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,750
- Lucy: YEAH?
- MOST OF THE GUILDS

162
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,625
THAT GAJEEL AND I DESTROYED
WHEN THE TWO OF US

163
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,166
WERE MEMBERS OF PHANTOM LORD
WERE UNDER ORACION SEIS,

164
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,666
EXCEPT FOR FAIRY TAIL
OF COURSE.

165
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,333
BUT WE'RE ALL
GREAT FRIENDS NOW, RIGHT?

166
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,916
- I WOULDN'T REMIND 'EM OF THAT
IF I WERE YOU.

167
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,833
- CREEPY.
HEY, YOU GUYS,

168
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,458
DO YOU THINK THEY'LL
TAKE IT OUT ON US?

169
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,958
- AH, RELAX.

170
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,916
DON'T WORRY YOUR PRETTY
LITTLE HEAD ABOUT THEM.

171
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,833
FROM WHAT I HEAR,
THEY'VE ONLY GOT SIX MEMBERS

172
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,458
IN THE GUILD ANYWAY.

173
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,416
- YEAH, THEY SOUND LIKE
SMALL POTATOES IF YOU ASK ME.

174
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,333
- DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THEM.

175
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,750
THOSE SIX WIZARDS MAKE UP

176
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,666
ONE OF THE MOST
POWERFUL GUILDS OUT THERE.

177
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,875
- SPEAKING OF
THE <i>ORACION SEIS...</i>

178
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,541
WORD HAS COME DOWN.

179
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,625
WE MUST DESTROY THEM.

180
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:50,833
- HUH?

181
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,250
- All: WHAT?!

182
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,416
- Mirajane:
WELCOME BACK, MASTER.

183
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,083
- ( groans )

184
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,541
- I HOPE THAT YOU HAD
A GOOD TIME AT THE CONFERENCE.

185
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,291
- ( gasps )
I'M SURE.

186
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:06,416
- BUT, MASTER,
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

187
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,750
- <i>ORACION SEIS'</i> RECENT ACTIVITY

188
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,833
WAS THE FOCUS OF MUCH DISCUSSION
AT THE CONFERENCE.

189
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:15,875
THEY POSE AN URGENT THREAT
THAT CAN NO LONGER BE IGNORED.

190
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:19,166
THEREFORE, THEY MUST BE
DEALT WITH IMMEDIATELY.

191
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,416
WE WILL TAKE THEM DOWN
BEFORE THEY CAN HARM

192
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,166
ANY OF OUR FELLOW GUILDS
WE ARE SWORN TO PROTECT.

193
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,000
- AND WE GOT TO DO
ALL THE HEAVY LIFTING, RIGHT?

194
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,208
- TYPICAL.
- FAIRY TAIL WILL BE

195
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,833
TAKING THEM ON BY OURSELVES?

196
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,833
- THIS ENEMY
IS FAR MORE POWERFUL

197
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,583
THAN ANY OTHER WE 
HAVE FACED BEFORE.

198
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:39,000
TO FIGHT THEM ALONE
WOULD BE TOO DANGEROUS.

199
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,500
OUR ATTACK WOULD SURELY
INCUR THE WRATH

200
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:45,333
OF THE ENTIRE
BARAM ALLIANCE IN NO TIME.

201
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,041
WHICH IS WHY FAIRY TAIL

202
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,750
WILL JOIN A COALITION
OF MAGICAL GUILDS.

203
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,625
- All: A COALITION?

204
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,375
- Makarov: FAIRY TAIL...

205
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,458
BLUE PEGASUS...

206
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,416
LAMIA SCALE...

207
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,375
AND CAIT SHELTER.

208
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,666
THESE FOUR GUILDS
WILL SELECT MEMBERS

209
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,708
TO REPRESENT THEM
IN THE ALLIED FORCE.

210
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,833
TOGETHER, WE WILL WORK
TO BRING DOWN THE ENEMY!

211
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,416
- BUT WE CAN HANDLE IT
OURSELVES, GRAMPS.

212
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,166
IN FACT, I COULD
PROBABLY EVEN DO IT ALONE.

213
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,375
( grunts )
- DON'T BE A FOOL.

214
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,208
THE MASTER IS WISE

215
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,208
TO CONSIDER
THE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES.

216
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,958
- WHOA, JUST HOLD ON A SECOND,
YOU GUYS.

217
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:25,583
WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT
SIX PEOPLE AREN'T WE?

218
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:29,041
I MEAN, ARE THEY SERIOUSLY
ALL THAT SCARY?

219
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,083
- Cobra: I CAN HEAR IT.

220
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:41,416
- THAT SWEET SOUND OF LIGHT
CRASHING TO THE GROUND.

221
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,250
- Racer: DON'T JUMP TO
CONCLUSIONS SO QUICKLY, COBRA.

222
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:49,583
THOUGH, SPEED CAN
BE A WONDERFUL THING.

223
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:53,625
- RACER, THE MAGIC WE SEEK
IS RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSES. 

224
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,083
I'M SURE OF IT.

225
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,583
- THAT ANCIENT
AND HIDDEN MAGIC

226
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,791
WITH THE POWER
TO TURN LIGHT INTO COMPLETE

227
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,375
AND TOTAL DARKNESS,
OH YEAH!

228
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,708
- NIRVANA.

229
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,666
- ( snoring )

230
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,291
- ( staff clangs )

231
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:15,500
- A LEGENDARY POWER,
ONE THAT WILL SOON BE OURS.

232
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:19,166
- ARE YOU SURE WE SHOULD
PUT ALL OUR BETS ON NIRVANA?

233
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,000
IT SOUNDS
TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.

234
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,708
- LOOK THERE.

235
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,750
THE DARKNESS THAT
SPREADS THROUGH THE TREES

236
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,250
MEANS NIRVANA
IS CLOSE AT HAND.

237
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,958
THE FOREST
IS BEGINNING TO DIE.

238
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,375
- ( snorting )

239
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,875
- Lucy: I KNOW
I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE,

240
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:39,125
BUT I'VE GOT A REALLY
BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS MISSION.

241
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,833
AND WHY AM I HERE?
I'M NOT ALL THAT STRONG.

242
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,750
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M GONNA BE
ABLE TO HELP YOU GUYS, ANYWAY.

243
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,041
- LOOK, THIS AIN'T
NO PICNIC FOR ME, EITHER.

244
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:50,166
SO QUIT POUTING, WOULD YOU?
- HMPH.

245
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,375
- ( pouts )

246
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,708
- ( moans )

247
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,708
- WE'RE HERE FOR ONE REASON.

248
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,791
BECAUSE MASTER
PUT HIS FAITH IN US,

249
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,583
SO LET'S NOT DISAPPOINT HIM.

250
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,958
- I KNOW.  YOU'RE RIGHT,

251
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,625
BUT GAJEEL AND JUVIA
ARE BETTER FIGHTERS.

252
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,750
- THEY CAN'T GO 'CAUSE MASTER
SENT THE TWO OF THEM

253
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,208
ON ANOTHER MISSION.
- ( groans )

254
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:11,458
I DON'T CARE.

255
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,125
I JUST...

256
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,500
WANNA...

257
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:18,416
GET... THERE.

258
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,083
- IT JUST SEEMS LIKE WE'RE
ALWAYS PICKED FOR THIS STUFF.

259
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,916
- YOU SHOULD
CONSIDER IT AN HONOR.

260
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,250
AND TODAY WILL BE OUR
FIRST JOINT OPERATION

261
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,041
INVOLVING THE OTHER
ALLIED GUILDS.

262
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,666
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL
FOCUS OUR EFFORTS

263
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,791
ON STARTING TO BUILD
A POSITIVE RAPPORT.

264
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,083
- Happy: THERE IT IS.

265
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,041
THE RENDEZVOUS SPOT.

266
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,833
- Lucy: GREAT,
ANOTHER CREEPY OLD MANSION.

267
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:52,875
- Erza: IT'S THE SECOND HOME
OF BLUE PEGASUS MASTER, BOB.

268
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,708
- OH, HIM.

269
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:55,916
- Narrator:
TO JOG YOUR MEMORY A BIT,

270
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,916
MASTER BOB
IS A SKILLED WIZARD

271
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,291
AND, ALSO, A MAN.

272
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:03,833
- HE MAKES ME FEEL FUNNY.
- GRAY, BE NICE.

273
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,208
MASTER BOB MAY BE
A LITTLE ECCENTRIC,

274
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,291
BUT HE DOES DESERVE
OUR UTMOST RESPECT.

275
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,833
- YEAH, ECCENTRIC.

276
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,666
- ( moans ) JUST TELL ME
WHEN WE'RE THERE, GUYS. 

277
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,958
- OKAY, WE'RE THERE.
- Young man: YES!

278
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,166
THEY'RE HERE AT LAST!
- Two young men: AT LAST!

279
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,625
- Young man:
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

280
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,000
HELLO.
- Both: HELLO.

281
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,625
- Young man: FAIRY...
- Both: FAIRY...

282
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,125
- Young man: TAIL...
- Both: TAIL...

283
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,875
- All: WIZARDS!

284
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,125
- HUH?

285
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,291
- All:
WE'RE SO GLAD YOU CAME.

286
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,958
( echoes )

287
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,333
- WE ARE...

288
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,333
- THE BLUE PEGASUS...

289
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,000
- ELITE CREW.

290
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,333
- All: THE TRIMENS.

291
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,458
- "HUNDRED NIGHTS" HIBIKI.

292
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,416
- "HOLY NIGHT" EVE.

293
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,541
- "STILL NIGHT" REN.

294
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:58,791
- Lucy:
THE TRIMENS FROM BLUE PEGASUS.

295
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,875
WOW, THAT IS SO COOL.

296
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,125
THOSE GUYS ARE LIKE
THE HOTTEST WIZARDS AROUND NOW.

297
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,666
HIBIKI LAYTIS
IS ALWAYS NEAR THE TOP

298
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,000
OF "SORCERER WEEKLY'S" MOST
ELIGIBLE WIZARD BACHELOR'S LIST.

299
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,250
HE'S BEEN IN THE TOP-THREE
FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS.

300
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,833
- WOULD YOU
LOOK AT THOSE GUYS?

301
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,916
I FEEL TOTALLY
UNDERDRESSED! 

302
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,500
- ( sighs ) AND THEY
ARE NOT ON THE LIST.

303
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,958
- I'VE HEARD TALES
OF YOUR BEAUTY... 

304
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,500
AND THEY'RE TRUE.

305
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,666
- IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU,

306
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,291
MISS TITANIA.

307
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,833
- PLEASE COME WITH ME.

308
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,208
- UH...

309
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,666
- WOULD YOU LIKE
TO FRESHEN UP?

310
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,208
- OR MAYBE SOMETHING TO EAT?

321
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,666

WHO ARE THEY?

322
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,333

IT'S ALMOST UNREAL.

326
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,250
IS THIS A DREAM?
- UH...

327
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,875

I'VE ALWAYS ADMIRED YOU.

328
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,250

329
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,708
YOU CAN HAVE IT
IF YOU WANT,

330
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,916
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE 
I MADE IF FOR YOU.

331

00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,916
FEEL FREE

MR. ICHIYA.

354
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,583
PLEASE FORGIVE
OUR RUDENESS. 

355
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,833

THE THIRD THING

I'D NEVER CHOOSE TO
BE IN HIS COMPANY. 

370
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,416
HOWEVER, HE IS
A GIFTED WIZARD.

371
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,875
- LISTEN UP, YOU BLUE PEGASUS
PLAYBOY WANNABES,

372
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:24,166

THE SAME MASTER.

THE ORACION SEIS.

433
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:11,000
THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR US
