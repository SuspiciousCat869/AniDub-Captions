[BRANDISH] To think you
live in that dump.

00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:24,708
Still, I'm glad I found you.

4
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:25,958
Who are you?

5
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:28,458
And what connection do
you have to my mother?

6
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:33,083
[BRANDISH] It's too much
of a hassle to explain.

7
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:37,458
[CANA] Get the hell away
from Lucy, you weirdo!

We can handle all
the riff-raff here.

Oh, thank goodness!

22
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,583
I think Wendy's on her way.

23
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,458
The sandstorm's finally over.

Good, but I'm sure
there's more trouble.

00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,666
in this town?

Allergies?

30
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,416
I guess the wind from
that sandstorm

31
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,291
whipped up all the pollen
and crap in the air.

Sucker punch?

36
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,958
She left herself
wide open, so...

Looks like she's down.

[LUCY]
What should we do with her?

00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,541
[CANA] She's our prisoner.
We'll hold her in the guild.

I can see!

44
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,833
The sand's beginning to clear.

45
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,416
There's five?

Works for me.

47
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,291
They have a strange
magic energy.

48
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:29,791
Yeah, they do! Be careful!

49
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,958
Get ready!

50
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:35,708
Physical attack?
That just won't work on me!

All right.

56
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,250
Get ready to freeze!

57
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,750
They got fire, too?

58
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,625
[JUVIA] And the one
fighting me has steam.

Oh, no! I can't hurt him!

64
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,208
[GRAY] They're using
fire against my ice,

65
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:13,291
steam against Juvia's water,
speed against Elfman's power,

66
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:17,083
and power against
Lisanna's speed.

67
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,041
I see what's goin' on here.

68
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:23,416
They're using our
weaknesses against us.

69
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,708
Lucky for us, Mira doesn't
have any weaknesses.

70
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,333
[gasps]

71
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:31,208
No. Please don't!

72
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,041
Cut it out, Elfman,
you're hurting me!

73
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,083
Hey! You're arguing
with a fake, ya know!

You! You did this!

How the heck did you know
which ways to attack us?

76
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,041
My Weakness magic
can generate soldiers.

77
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:48,208
They home in and take advantage
of my foe's weaknesses.

78
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:51,458
My power is a
unique one, indeed.

Well, that explains it.

[WALL] My Weakness Soldiers
can deal with your lot,

I'm sure of that.

84
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:04,166
As for me, I shall dispatch with
that loathsome enchantment user

85
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,208
and nullify the
barrier for good.

What?

87
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,750
He's gone.

00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,125
And he's after Fried!

That's good!

93
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,291
Apparently, Erza and Bisca

94
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,708
put one of the Twelve
outta commission!

Ha. More reassuring news.

It's a disgrace.

97

Sorry, you two. He's yours.

[BIXLOW]
No problem!

[EVERGREEN]
We can handle him.

00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,958
We're Laxus's personal
bodyguards after all.

107
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,750
Part of the Thunder
Legion's duty

108
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,875
is to maintain our
fearsome reputation.

00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,625
I can see it clearly.

00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,625
Is something wrong with you?

167
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:24,708
Nah.

168
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,250
[WALL]
Indeed, It makes no difference

169
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,625
how many are in your number.

170
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:32,166
I can determine all your
weaknesses with minimal effort.

171
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,416
All I need to do
is a quick scan.

172
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,333
Then my method of attack
is made clear to me.

173
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,791
Huh?

174
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,500
[ICHIYA]
Mmm...

175
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,375
[WALL]
This must be a mistake!

176
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:46,916
How can he be this flawed?

177
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,500
Man.

178
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,500
Ichiya's in a class all his own.

179
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,083
The dude's got so
many weaknesses,

180
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:55,208
the enemy doesn't even
know where to begin.

181
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,166
Although our time spent
together was brief,

182
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,625
you three were members of my
beloved Blue Pegasus guild!

183
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,291
In other words, you
and I are like family!

184
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:08,791
As a rule, no one harms my
family and gets away with it!

185
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,500
I know Fairy Tail shares
those feelings!

186
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:16,791
Now, quake in fear before me;
there is no escape!

187
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:23,291
[chuckles] The thick aroma
of death surrounds you.

188
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:26,125
Ha! That's my poison parfum.

189
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:31,291
[WALL] Alas, I lack the
ability to perceive smell.

190
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,416
Ah! You don't have a nose!

191
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,583
[WALL]
Besides that, I'm a Machias.

192
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:39,291
Your countless weaknesses had
me a bit flummoxed, indeed.

193
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,416
But it's quite simple.

194
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,291
You're just a weak...
pitiful... fool!

195
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,000
Ichiya!

196
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,416
[EVERGREEN growls]

197
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,791
This is so annoying!
I have my own problems here!

198
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:54,916
Hold on.

199
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,916
[ICHIYA]
Leave it to me.

200
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,625
Every last machine has the
same undeniable weakness.

201
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,500
Thunder Parfum with...

202
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,625
...massive Point-Blank Suction!

203
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,916
[gasping]

204
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,500
[ICHIYA]
Yes, that's right!

205
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:13,041
You're no match for
the power of lightning!

206
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:18,291
Justice... Thunder... Man!

207
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,416
[WALL] It's true Machias
made from organic metal

208
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,625
are vulnerable to
lightning strikes.

209
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,875
But do you honestly believe
that I would be allowed

210
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,750
to join the ranks of
the Spriggan Twelve

211
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:34,125
without first conquering
my own deficiencies?

212
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,916
What did you say?

213
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,375
[WALL] Since my magic
exploits weaknesses,

214
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,500
I learned a while ago
to eliminate any

215
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,833
that I found within myself.

216
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,333
So, I proceeded to address
my own failings,

217
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:48,708
and can now convert lightning
into a usable energy source!

218
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,416
Is he serious?

219
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,208
[WALL]
Vortex Charge!

220
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,541
[BOTH scream]

221
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,958
Man!

222
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,791
I'd heard of the Machias' power,

223
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,166
that they'd mastered
alchemy of some sort,

224
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,500
but I never knew they used it
to continually alter themselves.

225
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,250
[WALL] Indeed, the
more lightning of yours

226
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,291
that I absorb,
the easier it will be

227
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,458
for me to smite you all!

228
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:27,208
Ugh... I can't believe
the lightning helped him.

229
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,541
It never occurred to me.

230
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:34,333
[EVERGREEN] This means Laxus'
magic wouldn't have worked!

231
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:37,166
[BIXLOW] I was disappointed
when I realized Ichiya was here,

232
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,000
but now I'm glad Laxus
didn't show up.

233
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,916
[FRIED] Nobody here has
a chance against him!

234
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,708
I have no other option.

235
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,375
The enchantment's
getting weaker!

236
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:48,708
What's happening?

237
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,750
[MAKAROV]
And why now?

238
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,291
Listen, Fried! Don't let
your enchantment fall!

239
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,541
The guild hall's under
attack from the west!

240
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,083
[gasps]

241
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,833
[WALL]
Oh? What's this?

242
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,000
It looked as though you were

243
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,583
dropping your enchantment
for a moment.

244
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:10,541
So will you let it fall
in order to defend yourself...

245
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,083
...or will you die in vain

246
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,708
while trying to protect
the entire town?

247
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,750
A tough decision, indeed.

248
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,458
[LAXUS]
Hey!

249
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,041
What's goin' on?
I'm comin' to help you!

250
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,541
Stop yelling.

251
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,875
It's telepathy, you know,
so he can hear you just fine!

252
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,208
[FRIED]
No! Stay away!

253
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,458
Huh?

254
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,041
[FRIED]
We're the Thunder Legion.

255
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,833
We're your personal guard.

256
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:35,041
Our sole purpose has been
to protect you. However...

257
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:39,750
At this moment,
we must protect the guild!

258
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,541
So, you are still alive.

259
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:44,083
If you knew us, that wouldn't
be any kinda surprise!

260
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,916
We're not the types to go
down without a real fight!

261
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,666
I see. Then my Weakness
Soldiers shall give you one!

262
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,291
[BIXLOW, EVERGREEN groaning]

263
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,958
[BIXLOW]
More of these guys?

264
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,500
[EVERGREEN] Jeez! Will
these things just stop?

265
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,291
If you guys are fighting
more than one,

266
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,458
switch up your targets!

267
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:01,750
You hear me?

268
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,375
Is that Elfman?

269
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,208
[GRAY]
This one's a piece of cake!

270
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:09,125
Go, Gray! I'll take out
the fire one with water!

271
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,708
I'll go against the
more powerful machine!

272
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,875
The fast one is kind
of a joke to me!

273
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:17,083
I guess that means I gotta
beat up creepy robot me!

274
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,708
[ROBOT ELFMAN]
...help me. Manly.

275
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,166
So the Weakness Soldiers
have flaws. How ironic!

276
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,166
[ICHIYA]
It was this simple?

277
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,458
Well, if that's the case...

278
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,875
Let's wreck 'em!

279
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,916
[EVERGREEN] White magic doesn't
cancel out my spells!

280
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,041
[BIXLOW] And my trusty little
babies don't give a crap

281
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,791
about some stupid mist!

282
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,750
[WALL] I'm afraid it's too
late to turn the tide.

283
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,083
[gasps] Don't hurt him!

284
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,458
[NATSU]
We took... the western forces!

285
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,041
[BIXLOW gasps]

286
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:49,541
You there? Hey!

287
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,958
We took down the western forces!

288
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,208
Aye, Sir!

289
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,583
[GAJEEL chuckles]

290
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,958
What you've done is inspiring.

291
00:14:57,041 --> 00:15:00,041
Now I can give my all
to the fight at hand.

292
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,333
[FRIED] Dark Écriture...
Absolute Shadow!

293
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,416
Smell the Power
Parfum... of Max Man!

294
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,875
[FRIED, ICHIYA yell]

295
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:21,416
Can you go one second without
stealing the spotlight, Ichiya?

296
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,583
Yeah, come on!

297
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,291
Guess we handled them, huh?

298
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,541
Sure did!

299
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,208
What happened to your clothes?!

300
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,833
Hey, Ever. You okay?

301
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,458
[EVERGREEN] As if you would
truly have to worry about me.

302
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,916
How's Erza? Is she okay?

303
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,916
[WARREN]
Yeah, she's fine!

304
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,500
I'm happy to report we've
captured one of the Twelve.

305
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,750
Lucky us!

306
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,000
And we're bringin' her
back to the guild hall.

307
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,833
Aw, yeah! This is awesome!

308
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:55,625
D'ya hear that, Zeref?
Don't mess with Fairy Tail!

309
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,666
That's my Thunder Legion for ya!

310
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,666
Seems we've somehow
managed to weather

311
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,166
the first wave of the
storm, First Master.

312
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,708
[EVERGREEN]
Wait. Ichiya.

313
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,750
How long have you
been in Magnolia?

314
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,500
[ICHIYA]
Don't tell me you've forgotten.

315
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,416
Just answer the question, man.

316
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:16,083
Honestly. This is the problem
with you Fairy Tail people.

317
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:20,000
You seriously don't remember
what happened a few days ago?

318
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,208
Man.

319
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,708
We've come for the
Lightning Dragon Slayer!

320
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,250
Hand over the
Thunder Legion, too!

321
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,541
Now wait a moment.

322
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,583
We're gonna need to borrow
your ship, Ichiya!

323
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:33,500
I've always wanted to
take a ride on that thing!

324
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,041
Hold your horses, ladies.

325
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,416
Alvarez, we're comin' for ya!

326
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,041
Let's get 'em!

327
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,750
Hang on a minute, please.

328
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,083
My amazing family
came to rescue me!

329
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,291
Gramps!

330
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,333
Yeah!

331
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,416
Master!

332
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,250
They had a bit of
help, you know.

333
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,625
[NATSU]
We're back! Ha!

334
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,333
[GRAY]
I missed ya, Magnolia!

335
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:52,416
[LUCY]
Woo-hoo!

336
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,666
I'm standing right here.

337
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,458
And that happened
about a week ago!

338
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:04,208
Well, then perhaps you
should've gone home?

339
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,041
[ICHIYA]
What?!

340
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,250
Do you appreciate everything

341
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,833
that goes into a long
flight such as that?

342
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,208
It entails massive amounts of
preparation and maintenance,

343
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,208
not to mention
all the fuel costs!

344
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,416
And then, lo and behold,

345
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,791
Alvarez has the gall
to come attack Fiore?

346
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,250
It really pisses me off! A lot!

347
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,708
Sorry about that, buddy.

348
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,333
But you truly saved the
day, so we're grateful.

349
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,666
Hmph! I'll never
speak to you again!

350
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,916
[FRIED]
How petty can you be, old man?

351
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,083
[ICHIYA]
I'm not old! Just experienced!

352
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,375
[gasps]

353
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,458
Ichiya! Get away!

354
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,083
[ICHIYA]
Hm?

355
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,833
[gasps] Wha--?

356
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:40,208
[laughing]

357
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,250
[ALL gasp]

358
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,083
[GRAY]
What was that?

359
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,625
[LISANNA]
It came from Kardia Cathedral!

360
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,375
Evergreen!

361
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,958
Guys! You okay? Please,
just say something!

362
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:13,250
Hey! Fried! Evergreen! Bixlow!

363
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,250
[BIXLOW] I guess...
we had it comin', huh?

364
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,875
[EVERGREEN]
I'm just glad you're okay.

365
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,291
[FRIED]
We were in the same guild.

366
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,541
That bond can be
stronger than blood.

367
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:30,708
You mean that... I--?

368
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,666
Hey! What just happened?

369
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,833
Dunno. It's really hard to tell.

370
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,583
[ICHIYA wails]

371
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,875
[ICHIYA]
Man!

372
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:50,041
[WALL laughing]

373
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,625
[DIMARIA] Enough with the
creepy cackling, okay?

374
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,375
Knock it off for once.

375
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,333
I'd rather be hearing
the sound of the waves.

376
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,375
[laughs]


377
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:01,125
This little excursion is turning
out to be way more thrilling


378
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,833
than I'd ever
imagined, indeed!


379
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,375
[laughs]


380
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,041
Oh, yeah. I'm done with
the "indeed" thing.

381
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:11,041
I was almost certain my puppet
would be enough to handle them.

382
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,375
[DIMARIA]
Oh?

383
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,000
So the fairy brats broke
your plaything, did they?

384
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:18,625
[WALL] Honestly, I did
consider that a possibility.

385
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:21,208
But most surprising
is the fact the enemy

386
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,625
was able to defeat Ajeel

387
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:26,375
and take Brandish into
custody this quickly.

388
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,791
[laughs]

389
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:32,541
Hilarious! They captured her?
Talk about a "hassle."

390
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,666
It's almost too
pitiful to joke about.

391
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,416
[WALL laughs]

392
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,416
Well, I for one,
am quite amused.

393
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,958
These Fairy Tail meat bags
really know how to play tough.

394
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,291
I suppose Emperor Spriggan

395
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,583
deployed the whole army
for good reason.

396
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,541
Even so, I'll be damned
if we don't get

397
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,541
to have the last laugh today.

398
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,333
That would be a real tragedy!

399
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,625
[DIMARIA]
Cool it, okay?

400
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,250
We're almost to the port.

401
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:01,458
And our first order
was to take it out.

402
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,166
[DIMARIA] You really think
you can do it from here?

403
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,041
It's still like 30
kilometers away.

404
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,875
[WALL]
No.

405
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,416
I'm actually gunning for
the Fairy Tail guild hall!

406
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,375
That's gotta be ten
times farther!

407
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,208
You don't have a chance!

408
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,125
How dare you
underestimate me!

409
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:25,375
I'm Wall, the great Machias!
Now, watch me!

410
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,125
Ultra-long distance
anti-material magic cannon,

411
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,166
fire!

412
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:36,333
Hey! Bixlow! Ever! Fried!

413
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,833
Are you there? Please respond!

414
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,541
[alarm blaring]

415
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,041
Hey! There's something
huge coming our way!

416
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,416
Whoa! It's magic power!

417
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,333
Whatever that is, its super-fast
and headed right for us!

418
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,666
[LAXUS]
What? Their army?

419
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,125
No.

420
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,916
I'd bet they're firing some
kind of long-range attack.

421
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,291
Can they seriously hit
us from that far away?

422
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,750
[MAKAROV]
Fried, we need you!

423
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,000
Put your enchantment back up!

424
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,583
Fried!

425
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:03,791
[WARREN]
Nothing!

426
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,125
There's no response
from the Thunder Legion!

427
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,833
[LAXUS]
Tch! Damnit!

428
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,458
The thing is getting
closer! And fast!

429
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,333
It's gonna be a direct hit!

430
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,708
Evacuate the guild, now!

431
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:18,083
Oh, no! Is our guild hall
gonna get flattened again?

432
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,750
[ICHIYA]
Not if I can help it!

433
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,666
Who was that?

434
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,083
The Christina!

435
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,666
That was Ichiya?

436
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,333
[ICHIYA]
Man!

437
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,875
What the--?

438
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,375
Looks like you missed.

439
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,875
He just used his ship
as a shield!

440
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,041
Why would he do that?

441
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,541
[ICHIYA]
This is a battle!

442
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,333
But it is not yours
to fight alone!

443
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,708
Calling all of Fiore! Now!

444
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,166
[ICHIYA]
Listen up, everyone!

445
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:00,583
This battle...
belongs to all of us!

446
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,791
[LUCY] The first wave of attacks
has been pushed back for now.

447
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,208
But there's still
a war going on,

448
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:44,666
and things will
only get tougher.

449
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,208
Our fellow wizard guilds
across Fiore rise up

450
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:49,666
and join the battle to
defend our homeland,

451
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,250
while "Fairy Tactician" Mavis
initiates her new plan.

452
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:56,583
Out to the west, Natsu and
Happy speed across the sky,

453
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:59,291
ready to fight!

454
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:02,041
Next time: "Natsu vs. Zeref."

455
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,875
The black wizard sees
death approaching

456
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:06,583
and greets it with
a quiet smile.
