1
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:21,958
[HISUI] If all this has
been for the king's sake,

2
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,916
then the spirits haven't
been acting for themselves.

3
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,916
What could he stand
to gain from this?

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,625
If he's sacrificing his own
subjects, then he's lost it.

5
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:37,791
Is the Celestial Spirit King
behind this, or not?

6
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:40,916
Ya know, I always wanted to go
toe to toe with ol' nose hairs,

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,458
but I didn't really have a
decent excuse until right now.

8
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:45,916
[laughs]

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,333
How can you defeat my king

10
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,250
when you're
about to fall to me?

11
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:54,458
[OPHIUCHUS] I am Ophiuchus,
the Snake Charmer.

12
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:57,500
Chosen guardian
of the Celestial Spirit King!

13
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:00,125
I am the thirteenth
spirit of the zodiac.

14
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:02,500
The deadly shadow of my liege!

15
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:07,208
Oh, I'm more than just human.
I'm a dragon slayer, got it?

16
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:10,500
[yelling]

17
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:15,000
With all eighty-eight
heavenly bodies...

18
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:20,083
Shining! Uranometria!

19
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,708
[OPHIUCHUS]
Shutting all those gates myself

20
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,541
would have been
quite the challenge.

21
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,750
Thank goodness I had you.

22
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:31,583
You've returned
all twelve zodiac members

23
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:34,458
to the Celestial
Spirit King's grasp!

24
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:37,500
The Celestial Globe
serves as a conduit.

25
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:40,250
It channels power from the
constellations of the zodiac

26
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,000
to my king.

27
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:44,708
The ritual we set out
to perform's sole purpose

28
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:47,375
is to grant him
the zodiac's strength.

29
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,375
It's called
the "Liberam Verus".

30
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:52,791
Becoming an Eclipse spirit

31
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:55,000
did endow the
Celestial Spirit King,

32
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:57,416
who was already the
strongest being in his world,

33
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,583
with power greater
than he had ever known,

34
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:02,458
but it also gave him
an appetite to match.

35
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:04,041
Fearful of his mighty hunger,

36
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:07,541
the zodiac spirits attempted
to flee the celestial world.

37
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:10,291
They strove to be free of him.

38
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:11,750
But their celestial bodies

39
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:14,375
pulled them back to the stars,
to resist was to suffer,

40
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,833
and to give in was to die.

41
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,416
The setup was perfect.

42
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,875
With the false hope
of the Liberam,

43
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,750
I set them and you to
work at granting my king

44
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,875
the power he craves.

45
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,958
The Celestial Spirit King
was that affected?

46
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,416
We thought we were
fighting to protect the spirits,

47
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,083
but we ended up putting them
right into harm's way.

48
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,750
To think we've
been banishing them

49
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,083
to the very place
that they were desperately

50
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,250
struggling to escape,

51
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,708
a world ruled by a
power-crazed monster.

52
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,208
How awful...

53
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,416
That isn't the
worst of it, either.

54
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,875
If this demented Celestial
Spirit King goes unchecked,

55
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,833
if his rampage
can't be stopped...

56
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,041
...then the
celestial spirit world

57
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,375
will collapse in on itself.

58
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,583
[OPHIUCHUS]
You don't learn, do you?

59
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:31,625
Poor fools!

60
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,000
The result will
always be the same!

61
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:43,041
[OPHIUCUS yelling]

62
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,666
[HAPPY] Celestial Spirit Beast!

63
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:13,875
Did we get it?

64
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,083
It stopped glowing!

65
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,541
The globe was destroyed.

66
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:17,958
That much is certain.

67
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,458
Looks like it's over.

68
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,916
[NATSU chuckles]

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,583
So she fades like the others?

70
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:46,083
Too bad, I was hoping
for Snake-Ke-Bobs.

71
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,125
[OPHIUCHUS]
I think I landed on my flute.

72
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,208
Is there a nurse in the house?

73
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,125
[HAPPY] Natsu, look!

74
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:20,250
All the zodiac constellations
are starting to disappear!

75
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,125
We rule,

76
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,541
snakes drool!

77
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,875
[NATSU] Talk about fireworks!

78
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,000
[LUCY] No kidding.

79
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,791
[ARCADIOS]
Princess. Are you unharmed?

80
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,916
[HISUI] Yes. I'm fine.

81
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,541
We did it! We saved them!

82
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,125
Now Loke and the other spirits
will go back to normal!

83
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,916
When has anything ever
turned out to be that simple?

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,833
[crashing noise]

85
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,250
[LUCY]
I tried using my zodiac keys,

86
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,458
but the spirits
still won't answer!

87
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,166
Evacuate!

88
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,166
Yo! What's the deal?
Did we stop the ritual?

89
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,416
Jeez.
It's about time you showed up.

90
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,416
I've been here from the start
and you know it, magma breath!

91
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,708
You're all okay!

92
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,041
Oh yeah!

93
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,666
So, Did the oversized
python turn tail or what?

94
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,125
Happy and I took care
of business, as usual.

95
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,125
Never turn your back
on the Cat-mander!

96
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,458
[PANTHERLILY] I don't see any
Zodiacs trying to kill us.

97
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,083
[GAJEEL] I'm guessing we should
take that as a good sign?

98
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,583
Yes!

99
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,833
We shut all of their gates,
so there's no need to worry.

100
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,000
Maybe...

101
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,083
There's still no sign
that we were able

102
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,791
to turn them back
to normal, though.

103
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,166
Hey, keep your chin up!

104
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,750
We'll figure
out how to help 'em.

105
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,500
That's right.
It'll be okay somehow!

106
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:29,791
Why don't we take
this opportunity

107
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,791
to compare
notes and make a plan?

108
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,416
And I can heal
everyone so we'll be ready!

109
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,458
Something tells me
we should relocate first!

110
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:42,250
[ALL gasp]

111
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,333
[ELFMAN] So loud!

112
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,875
[MIRAJANE]
Where's that coming from?

113
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,541
[LEVY]
It sounds like a monster!

114
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,333
Hey! Get it together!

115
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,666
Tell that to the ground!

116
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,458
We may have
overdone it earlier.

117
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:52,708
Yeah, no kidding.

118
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,500
Who thought this much
damage was a good idea?

119
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:57,333
Someone that never
learned how to pull her punches.

120
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,458
Is there something that
you'd like to say to my face?

121
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,708
--No ma'am!
--No ma'am!

122
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,125
[ELFMAN] Can we leave?
My ears are bleedin'!

123
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,708
[CANA] Does it look like
there's a way out, ya wimp?

124
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,250
[LUCY]
What if we used the keys?

125
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,291
Yes!

126
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,708
They should be
able to get us home.

127
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,750
I don't think
that's a monster roaring.

128
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,375
It's the Celestial Spirit King!

129
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,500
You're right,
I can feel his power!

130
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,833
And it's even more
intense than before!

131
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,250
The Liberam Verus
must have finished.

132
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,000
Didn't we destroy the globe?

133
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,708
We did.

134
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,791
[HOROLOGIUM] I'm afraid
you didn't stop it in time.

135
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,000
[ELFMAN]
That voice! It's the man clock!

136
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,958
[MIRAJANE] How did you
manage to get here?

137
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,208
[HOROLOGIUM] Help us, Lucy!

138
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,875
What's happened to you?

139
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,166
If you don't do something,

140
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,916
the celestial spirit world
will vanish forever!

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,833
Take these.

142
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,125
[LEVY]
Celestial garments! Nice!

143
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,708
[GAJEEL] If we're
gonna be in the spirit world,

144
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,875
we might as well
look like we belong there.

145
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,833
What insanity is this?

146
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,000
Don't worry.

147
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,791
I'll take care of
everything from here.

148
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,291
[YUKINO] Not alone, you won't.

149
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,250
Thanks, Yukino.

150
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,166
[HISUI] I'll go, too.

151
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,916
No, I can't let you do that!

152
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,333
In the Celestial world,

153
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:02,500
time flows considerably faster
than it does in our own!

154
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,625
[HISUI] I know.

155
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,583
Then you're also
aware that letting you go

156
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,625
would be a
dereliction of my oath!

157
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,000
Even if you do return,

158
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,666
there's no telling how many
years will have passed!

159
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,666
I'm willing to take that chance.

160
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,083
[ARCADIOS] Princess!

161
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,208
Quit sweatin' the small stuff.
You'll rust your armor!

162
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,666
We'll protect her.

163
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,208
[ARCADIOS] You hear that?

164
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,541
Of course I do,
that's why I have to go.

165
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,125
Please don't!

166
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,333
As long as that
howling fills the heavens,

167
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,083
I will have failed
in attaining my atonement.

168
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,083
Princess...

169
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,291
Now that that's settled,
can we get going?

170
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,166
Sure!

171
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,500
We're not getting any younger.

172
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,291
We're gettin' manlier!

173
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,500
Screw all the
wibbly-wobbly time crap.

174
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,000
Loke and the other spirits
need our help, big time.

175
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,083
We're goin' in.

176
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,375
End of story.

177
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,333
Lucy, you with me?

178
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,666
Yeah.

179
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,166
Just remember:

180
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,500
Even if we return to this world
a hundred years from now,

181
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,916
as long as we're
with our friends,

182
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,708
there's nothing to fear!

183
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,833
I'd be happy a hundred
years in either direction

184
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:05,208
as long as my love-sicle
is beside me.

185
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,083
We've already lost
seven years together,

186
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,750
so what's another
century or two?

187
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,250
I don't care what year it is,

188
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:13,250
just give me some iron to chew
and a world to rampage in.

189
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,166
Truth.

190
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,458
Lisanna will understand
why we're doing this.

191
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,416
Of course she will,
she's our sister!

192
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,041
Not to mention,
she's pretty manly herself!

193
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,916
I can never tell
if you're joking or not.

194
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,166
The Celestial Spirit King

195
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,625
will soon absorb
the Astral Spiritus.

196
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,708
This will be a bumpy ride.

197
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,833
But it will allow you to enter
the Celestial Spirit world.

198
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,333
Make sure you're wearing
the proper garments!

199
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,958
[ARCADIOS] Princess...

200
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,833
It isn't safe to travel
without your guardian nearby,

201
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,625
so I shall accompany you.

202
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,250
Thanks, Arcadios.

203
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,791
We'll save you soon!
Hold on!

204
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,666
Watch your back, Fuzz Face!

205
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,291
We're paying a visit! Real soon!

206
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,666
[laughing]

207
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,625
[HISUI] Is this it? It's barren.

208
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,583
[ERZA]
These winds could be a problem.

209
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,208
It's nothing like the
world we visited last time.

210
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,500
Why don't we ever go somewhere

211
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,583
that rains fish and
has a nice litter box?

212
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,833
[HOROLOGIUM] Lady Lucy!

213
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,083
--Time is flying by!

214
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,250
--[LUCY] Horologium!
--Time is flying by!

215
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,166
Looks like we found what
was making all that noise.

216
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,583
Great!
Now, what the hell is it?

217
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,666
Um, it's manly?

218
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,208
[LUCY] No way...

219
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,833
[HISUI] That's the
Celestial Spirit King?

220
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,541
[ARCADIOS] How disturbing.

221
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,041
[LUCY] What happened to him?

222
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,500
He doesn't look
anything like he did before.

223
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,791
[ERZA]
He's the Eclipse Spirit King.

224
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,875
Or the "Spirit Beast".

225
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,375
Either way, it spells trouble.

226
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:18,416
Check it out!
Around its head thing!

227
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,666
[HAPPY] There's no mustache!

228
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,333
[CARLA] That's not
what she's pointing at!

229
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,500
[GRAY] I see 'em!

230
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,416
The celestial spirits
are in those orbs!

231
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,125
[YUKINO] Oh, no!

232
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:30,458
[WENDY] Does this mean
they're being held captive?

233
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,791
[NATSU] Loke!

234
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:32,875
[LUCY] Hold on!

235
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,791
We'll get you out
of there, I swear!

236
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,791
[PANTHERLILY]
The wind is gone!

237
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:48,958
[GAJEEL] Guess he's full.

238
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,125
He stopped pulling things in

239
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,000
after he swallowed
the Celestial Spirits.

240
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,583
No... They're gone?

241
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:55,791
[NATSU] Don't worry.

242
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,833
We can get them back
after we take him down.

243
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,333
[ERZA] Natsu's right.

244
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:02,291
This is no time
to be disheartened.

245
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,041
Let's go!

246
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,291
[ALL yelling]

247
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,625
Ice Impact!

248
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,375
Water Slicer!

249
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,875
[GRAY] It doesn't look
like he even noticed us.

250
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,500
[JUVIA] Then we'll hit harder!

251
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,958
[JUVIA, GRAY screaming]

252
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,958
Attacking in smaller
groups won't work!

253
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:28,000
We need to strike as one,
with a well-timed barrage!

254
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,458
[ELFMAN] Beast Soul!

255
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,166
[MIRAJANE] I'm ready.

256
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,583
Try some Card Magic!

257
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,166
--And a Solid Script Bullet!

258
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,333
--[CANA] Thunder!
--And a Solid Script Bullet!

259
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,458
Ice Cannon!

260
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,000
Water Whip!

261
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,250
[WENDY] Sky Dragon...

262
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,708
[GAJEEL] Iron Dragon...

263
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,375
[NATSU] Fire Dragon...

264
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:48,333
[WENDY, GAJEEL, NATSU]
...Roar!

265
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:08,750
[HAPPY]
You've gotta be kidding!

266
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,666
That didn't hurt him at all?

267
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,166
I think it's
about to counter-attack!

268
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,625
Stay on guard!

269
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,625
[yelling]

270
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,291
[LEVY] Oww!

271
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,291
Levy, are you all right?

272
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,791
[LEVY] Yeah. Thanks.

273
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,958
[GAJEEL] Careful.
I can't always save you.

274
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,916
All that from just one swing?

275
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,291
It looks like
everyone's okay, though.

276
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,666
[NATSU] Did we just die?

277
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,333
[HAPPY groaning]

278
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,750
[ERZA] Don't falter now!
Keep up the pressure!

279
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,500
[ALL] Right!

280
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,541
Come on.

281
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,000
He must have
some sort of weakness.

282
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,375
All we can do
is watch and hope

283
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,458
that one reveals itself.
And soon.

284
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,333
[GRAY] We can't let it get off
another swing like that!

285
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,791
Let's take out its arms!

286
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,625
[JUVIA]
Right! Let's go, my love!

287
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,041
[JUVIA gasps]

288
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,416
Juvia!

289
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,291
[JUVIA] Farewell, Gray.

290
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,083
[CARLA] I don't believe it.

291
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,291
She's a constellation!

292
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,166
That light changed her!

293
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,083
[GRAY] Juvia!

294
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,125
[HAPPY]
I don't wanna play anymore!

295
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,750
[yelling]

296
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:07,708
[LUCY] Oh no!

297
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,208
Is this what happened
to Loke and the others

298
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,708
when we closed their gates?

299
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,166
[NATSU]
He won't get away with this!

300
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,958
[WENDY] How do we
turn them back to normal?

301
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,541
By making
that celestial freak

302
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,666
feel the wrath of Fairy Tail!

303
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,500
Not much of a plan,
but it's our only option.

304
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,208
If we live long
enough to carry it out.

305
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,000
Lily!

306
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:30,208
[PANTHERLILY] Sorry...
I let my guard down.

307
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,250
[GAJEEL] Dammit!

308
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:37,791
Saved you.

309
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,833
[LUCY] Levy, no!

310
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:42,916
[GAJEEL] Idiot.

311
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,958
Why couldn't you
mind your own business?

312
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:49,958
Sky Dragon Roar!

313
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,500
[WENDY screams]

314
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:54,291
[NATSU] No way!

315
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,708
[HAPPY] Carla! Come back!

316
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,166
Man!

317
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,791
That stupid light makes it
impossible to get near him!

318
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:04,000
I have to avenge Carla!
Let's go!

319
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,291
[NATSU]
This is for our friends!

320
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,541
[HAPPY yelling]

321
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,291
[GRAY] Crap!
We can't catch a break here!

322
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,166
He's forcing us to
play nothing but defense.

323
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,833
[YUKINO screams]

324
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,375
[LUCY] Yukino!

325
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:26,791
[HISUI] Arcadios!

326
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,541
[ARCADIOS] Princess!
You have to find cover!

327
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,375
Don't worry about me!

328
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,541
[HAPPY] They're in trouble!

329
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,166
[NATSU]
Okay! We're coming, Pops!

330
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,833
[LUCY]
This can't be happening...

331
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,125
[NATSU] That's it.

332
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,583
I'm putting your
light show out of business!

333
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,375
[HAPPY]
You're in big trouble now!

334
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,875
[yelling]

335
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,541
[HAPPY] Whoa! What are you
planning to do, Natsu?

336
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:56,125
[NATSU] Ain't it obvious?
I'm gonna bash him with this!

337
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,958
Guess that's one strategy.

338
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,208
Are you crazy?

339
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,416
[NATSU yelling]

340
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,083
You have to ask?

341
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,458
Come on!

342
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:09,500
[ERZA] Calm down!

343
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,541
Don't let your anger
take control!

344
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,875
You'll end up stuck
in the sky like the others!

345
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,291
Only if he hits me,
and that won't happen!

346
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,375
[GRAY] Ice Make Cannon!

347
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,125
How are we supposed
to deal with this guy?

348
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,041
[GAJEEL] Iron Dragon Club!

349
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,333
What is he?

350
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,958
I can't tell if he's
made of flesh or thin air!

351
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,041
I don't care if
he's made of cotton candy!

352
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,000
Just thrash him!

353
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,625
[HAPPY] Aye, Sir!

354
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,416
[yelling]

355
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,875
[LUCY] He's got a point.

356
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,291
Standing around here
isn't going to solve anything.

357
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,083
If we're going to turn
the Zodiacs and our friends

358
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,333
back to normal, we have to
defeat the Spirit King.

359
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,166
No matter the cost!

360
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:56,166
That's it!
I've had enough of you!

361
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,458
Heads up!

362
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,083
Those black holes
are absorbing everything!

363
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,250
Don't let yourself
get pulled in!

364
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,291
[LUCY screams]

365
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,333
[NATSU] You don't
listen too good, do you?

366
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,125
[HAPPY] Let us
handle things up close!

367
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,541
[LUCY] No!

368
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,041
I refuse to do nothing
while my friends are trapped!

369
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,541
I can't argue with that.

370
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,333
Just don't do anything crazy!

371
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,416
[LUCY] Back 'atcha.

372
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,791
[NATSU] Fair enough.

373
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,125
Iron Dragon Sword!

374
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,541
You'll be sashimi
when I'm done with ya!

375
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:34,000
[GAJEEL]
That was close. Too close.

376
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,041
This thing's playin' for keeps.

377
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,583
[LUCY] Fall already!

378
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:40,958
[NATSU] Happy! Topside!

379
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,833
[HAPPY] Okay. If you're sure!

380
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,958
[NATSU] Of course.

381
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,041
So... what's your big plan?

382
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,375
Whaddya do to score a KO?

383
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,583
You aim for the face
and hit 'em hard!

384
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,250
[HAPPY] Aye, Sir!

385
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:58,000
It's time for
your wake-up call, pal!

386
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,041
Snap out of it!

387
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,250
[roaring]

388
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,125
[NATSU] Jeez, that's loud!

389
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,875
[ERZA] Now what is he doing?

390
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,250
[GRAY] Natsu!

391
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,500
[HAPPY] Hey...
I feel like I know this attack!

392
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:15,583
[NATSU] Me, too.

393
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:16,958
It's the same one
that blindsided us

394
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,125
when we were
fighting Loke earlier!

395
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,000
Make up your mind!

396
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,708
Either spit stuff up
or keep it down!

397
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,333
[LUCY] It's the
Eclipse Spirit King's roar!

398
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:34,375
Gray?

399
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:35,833
Thank me later!

400
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,958
Passing gas won't scare me off!

401
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:44,291
Iron Dragon Roar!

402
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:59,375
Well... crap.
He just wiped the floor with us.

403
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,750
[ERZA]
Such overwhelming power.

404
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,666
'Kay.

405
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,416
I'm officially runnin'
on fumes and a prayer.

406
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:08,666
[LUCY] Ow...

407
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,208
[LUCY] Everyone...

408
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,083
[LUCY] Natsu!

409
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,500
[NATSU] I smelled him.

410
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:21,875
[LUCY] Huh?

411
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:25,583
We're not finished.
Not while we can move.

412
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:29,041
If we can move,
we can stand.

413
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:32,958
[GAJEEL] And if we can stand,
we can keep fighting.

414
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,500
Fairy Tail never quits!
Never!

415
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,333
[NATSU]
I caught Loke's scent.

416
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,541
[HAPPY] Huh?

417
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,875
[NATSU] During his roar attack.

418
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,791
No doubt about it.

419
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:46,208
Loke and the others
are still alive inside him.

420
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,833
[HAPPY] So that means--

421
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:51,458
[NATSU] Let's go, Happy!

422
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:52,541
[HAPPY] Aye, Sir!

423
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:53,333
Natsu!

424
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:54,375
Is that moron blind?

425
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,000
He must have a plan!

426
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,791
[GAJEEL] He can't be serious.

427
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,000
[GRAY] That maniac!

428
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,958
No! He's crazy!

429
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:12,208
[ERZA chuckles]

430
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,208
He is that.

431
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,375
[HAPPY, NATSU] Max Speed!

432
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:22,250
Looks like he's planning to
shove himself down its throat.

433
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:23,875
We'll handle things out here!

434
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:27,125
Give that freak some
hardcore heartburn, Salamander!

435
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:31,125
Good luck, Natsu!

436
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:36,000
Let's give it all we've got!
We can still do this!

437
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,333
[ERZA, GAJEEL, GRAY]
Yeah!

438
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,416
[HAPPY] Whew!

439
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,375
We managed to get inside the
Celestial Spirit King's body!

440
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:17,458
[NATSU]
But what's with this place?

441
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:18,708
It's full of stars!

442
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,333
[HAPPY] Are you sure
Loke and the others

443
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:21,916
are being held hostage in here?

444
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,083
[NATSU] Yeah.

445
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:24,250
We may not see 'em,
but I can smell 'em!

446
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:25,833
And the nose always knows!

447
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:27,500
[HAPPY]
We have to save them, Natsu!

448
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:29,333
Everyone outside
is counting on us.

449
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:30,958
We can't let them
fight for nothing!

450
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:32,291
[NATSU] Don't worry, pal!

451
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:33,833
We'll bust the spirits out
and put an end to this

452
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:34,958
once and for all!

453
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,958
[HAPPY, NATSU]
Next time! Believe!

454
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:39,125
[NATSU] All right, Happy.
Let's purge this beast!

455
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:40,791
[HAPPY] Aye, Sir!
