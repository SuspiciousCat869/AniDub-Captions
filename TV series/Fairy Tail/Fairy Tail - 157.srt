It's Blue Pegasus!

159
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,458
Hey guys!
Do your best!

160
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,750
[CHAPATI] Next, in fourth place!
The goddess of love and strife!

161
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,083
The sacred destroyer!

162
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,708
Lamia Scale!

163
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,375
Why'd you only come
in fourth place, huh?

164
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,166
I thought I told you
kids not to hold back!

165
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,958
Yeah, sorry about
that, old hag.

166
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,333
I wasn't watching
where I was going.

167
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,083
I've never seen her before.

168
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,958
She looks like a smaller
version of that girl Sherry.

169
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,750
Please try to
stay on your feet.

170
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,416
No promises, Lyon.

171
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,958
This is Shelia; she's
one of Sherry's cousins.

172
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,375
[NATSU] That makes sense!

173
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,125
And she's crazy
strong to boot!

174
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,500
I need a lot more love if
I wanna compete with Sherry.

175
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,000
I was praising you!

176
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,166
[YUKA] Calm down and
chase a ball or something.

177
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,416
Being love-crazy
must run in the family.

178
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,708
[LYON] Don't forget
our agreement, Gray.

179
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:05,583
[LYON] If we win, Juvia becomes
a member of Lamia Scale.

180
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,333
[GRAY] Last time I checked
I never agreed to that bet.

181
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,000
Not that it matters, 'cause
you guys're gonna lose.

182
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,083
Then, if we win, I'll take
Miss Erza as my one and only.

183
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,041
You'll do no
such thing, you troll!

184
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,208
Your parfum is like
candy to my nostrils.

185
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,208
And I'll take you, I guess.

186
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,750
Not that I'm into
you or anything like that.

187
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,083
[LUCY] Thank you, Ren.

188
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,041
It's good to know that
some things never change.

189
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,750
Then I'll take Wendy!

190
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,708
Um.

191
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,000
[EVE] Whoa, you really
sprouted, didn't you?

192
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,833
That's cool,
I'm into thick chicks.

193
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,083
Laugh it up.

194
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,333
Hey, Boss!

195
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,833
If we lose, I wanna
be given to this guild!

196
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,791
Man, I was
gonna call dibs!

197
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:44,250
Have you ever seen any
of those Cerberus guys before?

198
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,916
[CERBERUS GUILD]
Get wild! Get wild!

199
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,500
Who's the fur?
Some dude?

200
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,583
[ROCKER] Let's go!

201
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,041
Now to introduce
our third place contestants!

202
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,541
What a shocker!

203
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,000
Swooping in from a midnight
dreary, this dark and gloomy

204
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:00,041
bunch are making their
debut in this year's games.

205
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:03,791
Give it up for Raven Tail!

206
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,541
What the heck
are they doin' here?

207
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,750
This is bad.

208
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,375
Their leader is Master
Makarov's son, Ivan.

209
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,291
But that means they're--.

210
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,791
Why is a dark
guild participating?

211
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,708
Have you officials
lost your minds or

212
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,833
were you just
incompetent to begin with?

213
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,125
You're making
a scene, Master.

214
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,291
[MAKAROV] Well?

215
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,458
He's gonna bust a vessel!

216
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm sensing intense
malice from them.

217
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,000
Isn't Raven Tail a dark guild?

218
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,500
I dunno, I've never heard
of 'em before today.

219
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,583
Well. Their records
appear to be in order.

220
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,166
They're an old guild.

221
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,375
Official sources state they've
been active over seven years,

222
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,166
but they were only
recently approved for

223
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,583
official guild status
by the Magic Council.

224
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,416
If they have official status
then they're technically

225
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,416
not a dark guild and are,
therefore, eligible to compete.

226
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,708
Curse you, Ivan!

227
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,041
I don't know how you
did it, but whatever

228
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,583
you're planning,
I swear I'll stop you.

229
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,583
You really shouldn't get so

230
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:19,500
worked up old man
it's bad for your health.

231
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,166
[IVAN] I want you to
live to see your guild fall.

232
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,916
[IVAN (ALEXEI)] Fairy Tail.

233
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:30,375
[IVAN (ALEXEI)] I trust
your friend is recovering?

234
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,375
You were the ones
who attacked Wendy?

235
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,750
I'm gonna make you regret it!

236
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,791
[IVAN (ALEXEI)] The festival's
just getting started.

237
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:54,750
[MAKAROV] Ivan!

238
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:55,791
[CHAPATI] Hold on!

239
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:56,666
We've still got two
teams who made

240
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,375
it through the qualifying round!

241
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,750
Oh, yeah!

242
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,500
I wonder which of the
other teams made it through.

243
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,958
You can bet on one
of 'em bein' Sabertooth.

244
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,416
As for the other one.

245
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,875
Huh.

246
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,583
All the well-known guilds
have already been announced.

247
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:11,791
So it's possible one of these
teams is somehow tied to Zeref.

248
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,166
That's assuming
Jellal's intuition was right.

249
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,500
I guess we'll know soon.

250
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,708
Our first place runner up is...

251
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:18,916
Oh wow!

252
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,083
What a surprise!

253
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,041
This year's competition
just got a whole

254
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,083
lot more
interesting, folks!

255
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,208
[CHAPATI]
It's Fairy Tail Team B!

256
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,166
[ELFMAN] Big Sis?

257
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:30,875
[NATSU] Gajeel?

258
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:31,625
[GRAY] Juvia?

259
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:32,458
[LUCY] And Laxus?

260
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,166
How is that fair?

261
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,541
I certainly didn't expect
them to have two teams.

262
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,125
Hold up!
I need some answers!

263
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,375
Someone explain
how Mystogan's even here!

264
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,125
It can't be.

265
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,250
Jellal?
Is that you in there?

266
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,333
Shhh...

267
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,708
[NATSU AND GRAY]
You kiddin' me?

268
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,791
Beautiful.

269
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,458
[SHELIA] So she's the one
you've been fawning over.

270
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,333
[HIBIKI] Of course
they got two teams in.

271
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,583
I wouldn't expect anything less.

272
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:08,791
[IVAN (ALEXEI)] Laxus and
Gajeel are joining the party.

273
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,000
[ROCKER] How come
they have two teams?

274
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,583
They giving
Fairy Tail a handicap

275
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,041
'cause they suck so hard?

276
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,041
That's way past wild, man.

277
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,291
You know...

278
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,291
I think the newly
implemented rules may       

279
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,875
have left our audience
a bit perplexed, Mr. Yajima.

280
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:22,958
Care to explain?

281
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,541
Sure thing.

282
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,541
The committee in charge of the
Grand Magic Games permitted each

283
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,958
guild to enter two teams,
which they felt would

284
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,541
make the preliminaries
more exciting.

285
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,500
Why didn't you tell
us this was your plan, Master?

286
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,583
[MAKAROV] You like that?

287
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,208
This is how the Fairy Tail guild
takes care of business, baby!

288
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,333
I'm not sure the
committee really

289
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:42,750
thought this new
rule through.

290
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,625
I mean, this is a
team-based competition.

291
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,500
Won't having two teams
from the same guild

292
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,333
kind of stack the odds?

293
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,125
You worry too
much; to be honest,

294
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,791
I don't think it'll
be a problem.

295
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,041
Well, it's totally
unfair if you ask me.

296
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,125
Let's say there's an event
where each team chooses a

297
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,875
member to compete against
the others in a battle royale.

298
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,333
There's nothing
to stop the Fairy Tail

299
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,916
members from teaming
up with each other.

300
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,583
It does give them
an advantage.

301
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,208
But I guess that's their reward
for being the only guild out

302
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:09,083
of over one hundred with
two teams in the games.

303
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,625
You certainly
have the upper hand.

304
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,416
Way to go, Mocky!

305
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,666
Mocky?

306
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,500
I see!

307
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,041
That's why so many teams
entered the tournament!

308
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,000
This is a big loada crap!

309
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,000
Being in the same
guild don't mean jack;

310
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:31,250
if I fight against any of you,
I'm not pulling any punches!

311
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,083
As long as we're
in this tournament you're

312
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,000
my enemies, and I ain't
gonna lose to any of you?

313
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,000
I wouldn't have
it any other way.

314
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:41,541
I'm lookin' forward to makin'
you eat dirt, Salamander.

315
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:45,000
Gajeel's a lot stronger
than he was three months ago.

316
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,833
Well, Natsu's
no creampuff either!

317
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,000
Team B has got
some serious power;

318
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,083
it won't be easy
to take them down!

319
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,666
What's the matter?
You look terrified!

320
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,166
That's 'cause I am!

321
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,666
So. What are
you doing here?

322
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,375
This is wrong.

323
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,958
Your master is a very
understanding person.

324
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:05,500
Once I explained the situation,
he gave my plan his blessing.

325
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,416
You said it was impossible
to get near the coliseum.

326
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,583
[JELLAL] It was.

327
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,625
Until this opportunity
presented itself.

328
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:12,875
It's against the rules.

329
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,541
You're not an official
member of Fairy Tail.

330
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,750
[JELLAL]
As I understand it, Mystogan

331
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,500
and I are essentially
one and the same.

332
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,125
Don't be so uptight!

333
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,291
This is a festival!

334
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:24,958
We're all friends here.

335
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:25,708
Right?

336
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,458
Kiss and make up.

337
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:29,916
[JELLAL] It'll be fine.

338
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,875
Trust me.

339
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,708
By the way, "Mystogan."

340
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:36,416
You're not usually
this much of a chatty Kathy.

341
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,958
Keep it in mind.

342
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,208
[JELLAL] Understood.

343
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,666
The hooded
man down there.

344
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,291
He doesn't seem to
be a member of our guild.

345
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,375
[MAKAROV] I'm so sorry!

346
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,166
I had to!

347
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,416
Please forgive me!

348
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,625
I said it was a bad
idea from the start.

349
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,041
Don't think we didn't
try to stop him!

350
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,875
I don't sense any
malevolence coming from him.

351
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,541
[MAVIS] In fact, he seems
to possess the same heart

352
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,041
as those bearing
our guild's emblem.

353
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,625
It'd take way too long
to explain, but I guess you

354
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,875
could say he's technically
a member of Fairy Tail.

355
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,041
I get it.

356
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,375
He's Earth Land'
version of Prince Jellal.

357
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,625
I thought he seemed familiar.

358
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:13,875
[MAVIS] Is he strong?

359
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,166
Oh yes!
For sure!

360
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,000
It wasn't that long ago
that he was one of

361
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,166
the ten Wizard Saints!

362
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,500
[MAVIS] Then he can stay!

363
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,666
With him on our team
we're sure to be number one!

364
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,208
[DROY]
'Course she's fine with it.

365
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,541
Who cares about
rules when there's

366
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,125
a tournament to win, right?

367
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:35,000
We should make that part
of the charter at this point.

368
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:38,375
[JELLAL] So, have you
managed to find anything yet?

369
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,291
I'm suspicious of
Raven Tail but beyond

370
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,125
that I have nothing solid.

371
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,291
[JELLAL] This is their
debut in the games.

372
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,375
We've sensed the
power in previous years

373
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,875
so it can't be them.

374
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,958
[ERZA] What about you? Any
sign of this "strange power?"

375
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,541
[JELLAL] No.
Not yet.

376
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,916
Even Gajeel came to play.

377
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And last, but certainly
not least, is the team

378
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,583
that came in first
place in the preliminaries!

379
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,291
[crowd cheers]

380
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,166
[CHAPATI] That's right!

381
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:04,958
You know them!

382
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,000
You love them!

383
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,166
Now, get on your
feet and scream for

384
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,791
the most powerful
guild in all of Fiore!

385
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:14,166
The one and only Sabertooth!

386
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,291
[NATSU] Can't wait
to bring them down.

387
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,458
[STING] Why so serious?

388
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:33,750
S'just a game.

389
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,333
There a reason you
keep gawkin', pretty boy?

390
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,541
Nothing important.

391
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,000
At least we finally know
who our biggest competition is.

392
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,083
You're the man, Sting!

393
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,791
The best in the
whole wide world!

394
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,083
I'm cheering for you, too!
Isn't that great?

395
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:53,000
It appears that Sabertooth
has an Exceed cheer squad!

396
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,958
Natsu, Natsu, he's our man!

397
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,875
Burnin' butts across the land!

398
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,250
All in all,
I'd say we have

399
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,291
an impressive group
of wizards here!

400
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,916
Any comments on our
lineup, Mr. Yajima?

401
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,333
Yeah...

402
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,958
Mermaid Heel makes
me pine for my youth.

403
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,875
[CHAPATI] Um, that's
not quite what I meant.

404
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,416
We've kept everyone
waiting long enough!

405
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,458
It's about time we unveil
the official schedule

406
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,291
for this year's tournament!

407
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,458
There's gonna be a lot
of action in the next few days.

408
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,791
Now we're talkin'!

409
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,000
Each one of the rounds
will begin with a contest!

410
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,041
Participants will then be ranked
from first to eighth place!

411
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,875
[CHAPATI] The teams will
be awarded points depending

412
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,041
on how they ranked
in the contest.

413
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,375
Additionally, the teams
are allowed to select which

414
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,833
of their members
they want to compete.

415
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,833
After that, we have battles!

416
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,833
These bouts should come as quite
a treat to all you loyal fans

417
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,708
since it was your suggestions
that created these matchups!

418
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,208
Interesting.

419
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,916
Sounds like they get to
choose who fights who.

420
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,333
So then, if you don't watch
how much magic you

421
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,125
use in a contest,
you could find yourself

422
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,458
thrown into a battle
with no time to rest.

423
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,000
[CHAPATI] The battle
rules are simple!

424
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,375
Each team will square
off as shown here!

425
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,416
The winning teams
will be awarded ten points,

426
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,041
while the losing
teams get jack squat!

427
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,166
[CHAPATI]
In the case of a draw,

428
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,541
both teams will
be awarded five points.

429
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,791
Ready for action? Let's
get things started with the

430
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,916
first contest of the
Grand Magic Games,

431
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,958
one that we call "Hidden"!

432
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,791
[FEMALE 157B]
"Hidden"? What's that?

433
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,125
[MALE 157B] How should I know?

434
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,791
[CHAPATI] At this time,
we'd like each team

435
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,458
to select one
member to compete!

436
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:28,833
Once your selections are made,

437
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,791
the rules will be
explained in their entirety.

438
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,750
[YAEGER]
Let me start us off right!

439
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:33,875
It's all yours.

440
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,208
May the Wild be with you!

441
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,541
[ALL] Go Wild!

442
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,416
[CHAPATI] The first challenger
has stepped forward!

443
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,458
Representing Quatro
Cerberus; it's Yaeger!

444
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,541
The first one'll be easy.
I'll size up our opponents.

445
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,083
We're counting on you.

446
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:52,916
[CHAPATI] From Mermaid Heel,
the adorable Beth Vanderwood!

447
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,208
[IVAN (ALEXEI)] Nalpudding.
You go.

448
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,666
I won't letcha down, boss man.

449
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:02,000
[CHAPATI]
From Raven Tail, Nalpudding!

450
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,333
I'll take this one.

451
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,166
We're sending
you out there in style!

452
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,708
[HIBIKI AND REN] Look out
ladies, here comes Eve!

453
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,875
[CHAPATI] Blue Pegasus
sends out Eve Tilm!

454
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,416
Gotta love those lively cheers!

455
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,916
I shall handle this.

456
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,916
I'm feeling inspired by
the birds' lovely songs.

457
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,875
[CHAPATI] Keep your
eyes on this one, folks!

458
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,666
From Sabertooth,
the minstrel who

459
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,958
sings to the red
moon: Rufus Lore!

460
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,208
They're going
nuts for the pretty boy?

461
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,541
I don't get it.

462
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,041
Whatever the rules,
I'm sure the name is a clue.

463
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,875
I have a feeling
that stealth and guile

464
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,458
will be essential to win.

465
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,458
If only Wendy wasn't
out of commission.

466
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,375
She'd be perfect.

467
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,583
I'll do it, guys!

468
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,000
I could use a warm up anyway;

469
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,250
you just sit back and
let a real man handle it.

470
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:46,708
It's called hidden,
so I don't think

471
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,541
sending out a giant
is a great idea.

472
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,125
Sounds like in this
game the smaller you

473
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,000
are the better, so that means
it's down to me or Yuka.

474
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,625
Who're you callin' small?

475
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:55,791
No.

476
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,708
We shall take the
lead from the start.

477
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,291
Just leave it to me.

480
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,250
In that case, I got this one.

481
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:10,333
I've been itchin' to see what
this tournament's all about.

Tail Team B, Juvia Loxar!

The competitors

and the long
wait is finally over!

489
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,916
[CHAPATI] Grab a refreshment
and get glued to your seat,

490
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,250
'cause you're not
gonna want to miss a

491
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:38,375
single nail-biting
moment of "Hidden!"

[NATSU] Ugh, what's
with the army of Grays?

494
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,875
Lame!

495

[HAPPY] This has gotta
be heaven for Juvia!

496
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:18,833
[NATSU] But they're
not the real deal!

497
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:19,916
It's weird!

498
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,666
[HAPPY] I wish I
could use copy magic.

499
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,208
[NATSU]
What would you use it for?

500
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:25,625
[HAPPY] I'd make copy after copy
of the tastiest fish around!

501
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,875
[NATSU] So you're saying
you'd be a "copy cat"?

502
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:30,791
[HAPPY] Ugh, and you thought
the "Gray Army" was lame?

all really mad at you!
