00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:20,958
You seem tired.

00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:21,833
[chuckles]

4
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:23,291
That makes it my turn.

5
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:26,333
Let's end this!
That's what you came for, right?

6
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:28,625
Feed me with your pain!

7
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:30,916
Every whimper charges my whip!

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,708
[LUCY] Please stop...

9
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:36,166
Beg away, but there's
no safety word with me!

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,625
That would ruin the fun!

00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,750
[laughs]

12
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:40,958
Down, girl!

[laughing]

15
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:52,916
If you're lookin' for us,
we're over here!

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,833
It's hide and go seek!

17
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:57,250
We didn't come here
to play silly children's games!

18
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:00,166
Especially not with these two
annoying little rugrats.

19
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,333
[GEMI] Piri, piri.

20
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:03,458
These guys aren't
any fun at all.

21
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:05,916
[MINI]
Yeah, they're really boring.

22
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:09,583
Piri, piri, pikkiri!

23
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:12,250
It's blinding me!

24
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,833
The first to win two
out of a total of three matches

25
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:17,416
shall be declared the victor.

26
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,916
Is this agreeable to you?

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,833
Yes, it is.

28
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,291
But before we begin in earnest,

29
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,750
allow me to
compliment your stagecraft.

30
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:29,625
The extra context makes me
all the more determined to win.

31
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:31,583
[SAGITTARIUS] We are
warriors, the both of us.

32
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:34,666
It's been my experience that a
warrior only fights at his best

33
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,041
when taken by
the mood of battle.

34
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:41,125
Intriguing.
My experience has been the same.

35
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:42,208
Well, then.

36
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:44,166
It seems we're
more alike than I knew.

37
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,250
[SAGITTARIUS]
I appreciate that.

38
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,083
If all else is settled,
then tell me:

39
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:49,000
Are you prepared
for battle?

40
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:51,375
A good warrior
is always ready for battle.

41
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:53,875
A small part of me does wish
we had an audience, though.

42
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,333
I considered bringing one in,

43
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:58,291
but I don't have the heart
to destroy you so publicly.

44
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:00,708
This is my way
of showing you mercy.

45
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,500
Ooh, I hope your sword's
as sharp as your tongue.

46
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,583
Erza Scarlet, I challenge you!

47
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:06,916
I accept!

[hamster wheel running]

49
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,416
That's not gonna
help anything, you know.

50
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,625
Well, I gotta do something
or I'm gonna lose my mind!

51
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,291
Actually, I think I
must've already lost my mind,

52
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:55,958
because there's no way
I would ever let myself

53
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,625
end up in this crazy situation!

54
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,250
And if anybody in
the guild saw me like this,

55
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,333
I'd lose my reputation
along with it!

56
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,791
I just think you're
wasting your energy

57
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,291
running in that thing
instead of thinking

58
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,125
of how to get outta here.

59
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,333
I'm not gonna get any ideas

60
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:07,875

get back to normal,

and seal up these brats
before anybody sees us?

and nummy for your tummy!

I don't eat this crap!

Now, don't be so stubborn!

Eat up all of your weeds
like a good little boy!

If you don't eat 'em,

we're their pets?

worst kind of pet owners.

a tiny little animal like that

111
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,750
and then start trying
to yank them to pieces?

00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,291
We made him too fast.

162
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,166
Come back, fuzzy!

163
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,041
Hey! I think I found him!

164
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,708
Piri, piri!

165
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,291
[GEMI]
Ya can't hide from us!

166
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,250
[MINI] We see you!

167
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,833
[GEMI, MINI] Piri?

168
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,041
Time for sweet payback!

169
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,625
[screams]

170
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,458
That's so not fair!

171
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:17,000
That really hurt,
ya big meanie!

172
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,416
Now we gotta
teach the bad ol' kitty

173
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,125
not to do things like that!

174
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,500
Take this!

175
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,250
--Bad kitty!
--Bad kitty!

176
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,000
[GEMI, MINI] Pikkiri!

177
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,583
Me-ow!

178
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,916
Whoa, you turned me
into a mongoose!

179
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And it looks like you
turned me into a creepy snake!

180
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,416
[GEMI]
Oh, but you sure do look

181
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,541
super duper yummy
to me right now!

182
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,083
--[MINI] No, please!
--[GEMI] Stay still!

183
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,375
--I'm not a snake for real!
--Just give me a little nibble!

184
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,416
All right!

185
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,250
This kitty's got
way more than claws!

186
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,958
Iron Dragon Club!

187
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,000
--Piri?
--Piri?

188
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,458
[GEMI, MINI] Piri!

189
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,541
[GAJEEL] Man, I really
wish I woulda realized

190
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,041
I could still use magic
from the very beginning.

191
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,166
Now get lost, will ya?

192
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,000
[GEMI, MINI] Piri!

193
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,458
I feel like myself again.

194
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,041
Nicely done, Gajeel.

195
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,041
Thanks, Lily.

196
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,291
But couldn't you
have just used

197
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,291
your Iron Dragon Club
from the very beginning

198
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,500
of this whole ordeal?

199
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:23,666
Shut up!

200
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,166
I just assumed I
wouldn't be able to, okay?

201
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,291
[ARCADIOS]
It would seem very likely

202
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:34,416
that Leo is keeping watch
over the celestial globe.

203
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,208
[HISUI] So if we can
manage to get a sense

204
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,041
of where the globe
is being hidden,

205
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,291
he should be somewhere nearby.

206
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,708
Let's go see
if we can locate it.

207
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,458
[ARCADIOS]
Please wait, princess.

208
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,333
I brought a portable
projection lacrima-tron with me.

209
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:49,333
It is a rather
basic model, however.

210
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:50,625
Excellent idea.

211
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,125
Shall we test it out?

212
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,333
It appears that
the celestial spirits

213
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,833
are still rebelling.

214
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:10,125
If only we could use this
to pinpoint Leo's location.

215
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,583
Perhaps there's a hidden chamber

216
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,958
somewhere deep within
the Astral Spiritus itself?

217
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,750
There's something else
that's been troubling me

218
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,291
about the situation.

219
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,833
What's on your mind, princess?

220
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,750
We've been dealing with
the twelve zodiac spirits.

221
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,208
But that's not all that exist.

222
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,625
There's another one:

223
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,791
The spirit that passes
through the thirteenth gate.

224
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,041
The snake charmer. Ophiuchus.

225
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,583
It's very possible
that they could be

226
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,958
involved in this as well.

227
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,833
A good point.

228
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,125
We need to
account for that one

229
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,041
and verify my suspicion.

230
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,750
[HISUI] My feeling is they
could be playing a crucial role.

231
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,500
But what are they doing?

232
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,708
I'm one of the few
celestial wizards left.

233
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,041
And what's more,

234
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,916
my irresponsible actions
got us into this mess.

235
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I have to make
things right again.

236
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,333
Princess Hisui...

237
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,500
[VIRGO] We're not playing
hide and go seek, you know.

238
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,541
That's not my kind
of game at all.

239
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,458
I've got a super-sized
helping of punishment

240
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,541
that I'm just dying to serve up.

241
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,166
So come and get it!

242
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,208
[LUCY] I really
don't want to fight her.

243
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,500
But I can't hide here forever.

244
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:23,375
I need to think
of a plan, quickly.

245
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:27,166
I've got mayo. Come on!

246
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,666
[VIRGO]
This room is perfect.

247
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,958
So many places to hide.

248
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,083
[thumping noise]

249
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Uh-oh!

250
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,625
I will not have
my gate closed for me,

251
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,041
thank you very much.

252
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,333
Now be a good girl
and hand over the key.

253
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,041
I'll just use
my Fleuve d'étoiles!

254
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,125
[chuckling]

255
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,791
[LUCY] No matter what, I can't
let her have this key!

256
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,500
We'll just have to pass
on the mayo for now!

257
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,625
You can never run away
from your fate, Miss Lucy.

258
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:35,750
I thought I could
get through this

259
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,458
without having to fight you.

260
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:40,708
But you've left me
with no other options.

261
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,541
Sorry, but this
is for your own good!

262
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,166
[ERZA] Excuse me,

263
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,208
but I have one
question before we begin.

264
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,125
[SAGITTARIUS]
And what would that be?

265
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,583
[ERZA] You wish to
complete the Liberam ritual,

266
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,083
which will supposedly
grant you freedom.

267
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,625
But then your
life will be reduced

268
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,458
to a mere twelve days.

269
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,458
That's such a brief time.

270
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,125
So my question is this:

271
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,208
Is your freedom
so valuable to you

272
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,458
that you are willing
to forfeit your life?

273
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,666
If it means I die
free and unencumbered

274
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,041
by my forced
servitude to humanity,

275
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:17,041
then yes, that is a trade
I am more than willing to make.

276
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,833
Before this rebellion began,

277
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,833
you celestial spirits
had all formed

278
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:23,416
a strong bond of
friendship with Lucy.

279
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,166
Do you truly see her
as an oppressor now?

280
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,583
I have no
recollection of this bond.

281
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,416
The idea that we'd be
friends with a human

282
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,375
that used us as tools
for their convenience

283
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,416
sounds like rubbish to me.

284
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,041
It wasn't like that.

285
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,666
Lucy deeply cares for you,
even still.

286
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,625
My resolve
will never be swayed

287
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,583
by this emotional drivel.

288
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:47,041
That is the noble
path of the warrior.

289
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,291
[ERZA sighs]
If there is no other way...

290
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:51,333
We will engage in
a total of three matches.

291
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,625
The first one to win two
of these will be the victor.

292
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,250
Do you accept these terms?

293
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,666
Yes, I accept.

294
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,541
[SAGITTARIUS] Now let us
begin the first match!

295
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:02,958
[ERZA] Horseback archery?

296
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,208
Very well.

297
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,375
Ah! Splendid!

298
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,083
That is quite a fascinating
steed you have there.

299
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,791
Well, this will be
a once in a lifetime battle.

300
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,125
I hope you're
prepared to give

301
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,041
this competition your all.

302
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,583
A true warrior
always strives to win.

303
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,708
Let me show you
how this is done.

304
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,000
Impressive.

305
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,750
[SAGITTARIUS]
Go ahead and take your turn.

306
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,291
It would appear
that I have been bested.

307
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,666
You're an awfully
graceful competitor.

308
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,625
It is an integral part

309
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,833
of the warrior's
code of conduct.

310
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,208
To engage in battle
is a sacred act.

311
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,041
However!
There're still two matches left!

312
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,500
The real battle
has only just begun!

313
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,458
[ERZA] I'm assuming the
second round will be a race?

314
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,500
Indeed.

315
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,625
Keep inside your lane,

316
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:14,833
and the first one
to the finish line

317
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,458
will be declared the victor.

318
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,250
Fine.

319
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,500
We'll begin at my signal.

320
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,625
Get ready... Go!

321
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,125
He's fast!

322
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,958
I'm afraid this weight puts me
at a severe disadvantage.

323
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,458
Goal!

324
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,333
[ERZA] Congratulations.

325
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,166
I feel very fortunate to
have met such a capable rival.

326
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,833
I truly appreciate
your words of praise.

327
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,333
But we are now tied
with a score of one to one

328
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:45,458
going into the final round.

329
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:46,875
Which will be...

330
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,583
...an armed battle between
two warriors on horseback!

331
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,000
Whoever wins this one
takes total victory.

332
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,208
But be aware...

333
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,083
A large quantity
of explosives

334
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,833
have been placed at random
all over this beach.

335
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,666
Even I have no knowledge
of where they may be.

336
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,916
So proceed with caution.

337
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,083
I appreciate the information.

338
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,375
Now for my choice of weapon.

339
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,625
[SAGITTARIUS]
Shall we begin?

340
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:09,750
[ERZA] I'm ready!

341
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,291
I must say, you're an
extremely skilled warrior,

342
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,000
but will it be enough?

343
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,125
You're aware that
spears can be used

344
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,250
for more than parrying blows?

345
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,500
Your reflexes are quite fast!

346
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:47,250
But your strength cannot
hold a candle to mine!

347
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,708
Perhaps, but your
brute force is completely wasted

348
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:55,083
if you're too slow
to hit your target!

349
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,416
Got you now!

350
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,458
Without your steed,

351
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,708
you've simply no chance
of claiming victory!

352
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,208
Surrender and
accept defeat gracefully.

353
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,208
I will never surrender to you!

354
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,833
All your determination
means nothing

355
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,750
if you are blown to smithereens
by your carelessness!

356
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:36,750
He told me he didn't know

357
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,750
where the
explosives were placed.

358
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:39,833
But how has he been able

359
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,791
to avoid triggering them
all this time?

360
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,958
Horses are very
sensitive creatures!

361
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:47,291
I can avoid them by
following my instincts!

362
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,583
My weapon!

363
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,666
You've lost
your steed, your steel,

364
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,583
and you're surrounded
by explosives.

365
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:58,208
You're left with
no safe place to stand.

366
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,541
I'm afraid you're
wrong about that, sir.

367
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,416
There's one place I can go.

368
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,333
[ERZA] On your back!

369
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,125
No explosives here, right?

370
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,333
[SAGITTARIUS]
How disrespectful!

371
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,958
I will not tolerate
anyone treating me

372
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,791
like some lowly farm animal!

373
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,208
This armor is
too heavy to be of use!

374
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,208
Yes, much more appropriate!

375
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,791
I won't stand for this!

376
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,791
Get off of me this instant!

377
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,250
I'd rather deal
with you thrashing about

378
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,666
than take my chances
getting blown to bits!

379
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,708
Giddyup!

380
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:30,916
Hiyah!

381
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,250
Keep moving and don't
slow down for anything!

382
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:45,541
[ERZA] I'll wager there aren't
any explosives past this point!

383
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,208
[yelling]

384
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,250
Well, it seems
I was wrong about that.

385
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,458
You fought well, Sagittarius,
but victory is mine.

386
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:06,791
[SAGITTARIUS] Thank you.

387
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,000
I knew that you would
be a worthy adversary,

388
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,333
but I did expect to win.

389
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,708
I humbly concede
defeat in this battle.

390
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,041
My fate is now in your hands,

391
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,541
so administer whatever
justice you see fit.

392
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,833
You have proven yourself to be
a most valiant opponent as well.

393
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,208
You have my utmost respect,

394
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,541
but I do hope to
see you return to normal.

395
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,208
Forced Closure!

396
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,458
I wonder how Natsu
and the others are faring.

397
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,666
What the heck is that thing?

398
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,208
An operating table?

399
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,791
It's a far
more sophisticated

400
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,875
piece of equipment than that.

401
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,375
In fact, it collects
the patients

402
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:50,458
and prepares them for surgery.

403
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:51,958
--[WENDY, CARLA scream]
--Let go of them!

404
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,583
What are you
gonna do to us?

405
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,541
I'm sure it'll
be bad for our health!

406
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:59,083
All of you need
something removed, I'm sure!

407
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,458
Don't let this thing catch you!

408
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,500
Run away!

409
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,041
Man, you're seriously gonna
have to do better than that!

410
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,708
Oh, is that the case?

411
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,041
Whoa!

412
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,375
As I told you earlier,

413
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,375
I am the solely
designated caretaker

414
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,000
of the Astral Spiritus.

415
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:18,666
So that means I also have a
great deal of dominance over it.

416
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,000
I got ya!

417
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,875
No...
That should be impossible!

418
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,125
All right, Happy,
full steam ahead!

419
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,583
[HAPPY] Aye, sir!

420
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,083
Fire Dragon Iron Fist!

421
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,833
Wow, thanks a lot, Natsu!

422
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,250
Yes, thank you.

423
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:40,375
I would much prefer not
to be dissected by that maniac.

424
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:41,833
It's not over yet!

425
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,791
[LOKE]
It is for now, Ophiuchus!

426
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:49,708
It's him!

427
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,500
About time you showed up!

428
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,958
The ceremony is
almost ready to begin.

429
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:57,500
It won't be necessary for you to
keep them occupied any longer,

430
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,916
so you may go now.

431
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,375
I understand, sir.

432
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,500
I take my leave.

433
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,875
They're really
about to start it?

434
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,125
I've got some
bad news for you,

435
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,708
all your cronies
are getting kicked back

436
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,500
into the celestial world
one-by-one as we speak!

437
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,416
And you can't hold your
little ceremony without them!

438
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,791
[chuckling, distant rumbling]

439
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,875
Oh. That's probably
not a good sound, is it?

440
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,916
The power of
darkness knows no bounds

441
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,708
and has given us another
chance to perform the Liberam!

442
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,625
We will not
give up our dream.

443
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,958
And we will not rest

444
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,833
until we have attained
true and absolute freedom!

445
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,416
[LOKE] Although we may
face setbacks along the way,

446
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,041
our hearts are unwavering!

447
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:39,875
We will cast off the shackles
humanity has placed upon us!

448
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,208
[NATSU] We're outside?

449
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,250
[WENDY] Yeah, but something
doesn't smell right!

450
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,500
[NATSU] Would you just
stay in one place already?

451
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,000
[LOKE] Ophiuchus!

452
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:50,416
The time has come
to reveal your true form!

453
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,791
[WENDY]
What does that mean?

454
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,125
[HAPPY] Hey, look!

455
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,791
I thought she
seemed too important

456
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,833
to just disappear like that.

457
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:03,375
The snake-charmer is
an absolutely vital part

458
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,958
of the zodiac.

459
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:08,500
So my true form is every bit as
majestic as that would entail.

460
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,708
In fact, the very place
known as the Astral Spiritus

461
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:14,208
is fully contained
within my body.

462
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,583
Everything that
has transpired so far

463
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,750
has been inside my body.

464
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:20,791
You coming here was by design.

465
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,958
A trap to lure you in!

466
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,625
[laughing evilly]

467
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:26,625
[LOKE] And now we
can perform the Liberam,

468
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:29,833
which will free us from the
human world once and for all!

469
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:32,375
There is nothing
you can do to stop us!

470
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,208
[OPHIUCHUS]
Oh, Celestial Spirit King.

471
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:38,083
I will not fail you!

472
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,583
I've heard of
someone being called a snake,

473
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:14,916
but this is ridiculous!

474
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,458
[HAPPY] I'm scared, Natsu!

475
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:17,458
How in the heck
are we gonna fight

476
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,291
against something that gigantic?

477
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,708
[NATSU]
One step at a time, buddy!

478
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:21,958
First we take out Loke

479
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,875
so we can stop him
from doing that ceremony!

480
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:25,791
[HAPPY] Yeah, I guess if we
keep him from finishing that,

481
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:27,875
we'll have one less thing
to worry about!

482
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:29,250
[NATSU] He's always been
kind of a jerk anyway,

483
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:30,375
so let's kick his butt!

484
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:31,791
[HAPPY] Aye, Sir!

485
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:34,458
[HAPPY, NATSU]
Next Time: Natsu vs. Leo!

486
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,833
I'll beat him down,
stop the ritual from happening,

487
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:38,916
and get things back
to normal in no time!

488
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,750
[HAPPY] Attaboy, Natsu!
