1
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:20,000
- HEY, GUYS. READY FOR
SOME MORE FAIRY TAIL?

2
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,708
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,208
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS
ON IN THE ROOM,

4
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:26,625
AND DON'T SIT TOO
CLOSE TO THE TV.

5
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:29,416
- ( birds caw )

6
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,333
- ( laughing )

7
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:39,166
- OWEE, OWEE, OWEE. HOT,
HOT, HOT, HOT, HOT, HOT.

8
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,958
- HUP.
- ON IT. HAHA!

9
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,833
- LET ME OFF THIS THING.

10
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,958
- THIS WAS YOUR IDEA
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

11
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:23,458
- ( laughing )

12
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,125
- Narrator: AKANE RESORT.

13
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,791
FIORE'S MOST POPULAR
VACATION SPOT,

14
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,458
WHERE IT'S CITIZENS CAN
RELAX AND ENJOY THEMSELVES

15
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:38,583
IN A NUMBER OF WAYS.
BOTH IT'S AMUSEMENT PARK

16
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:41,583
AND THE ADJOINING HOTEL
ARE RATED FIRST CLASS.

17
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:44,375
ONE VISIT TO IT'S WHITE SAND
BEACH WILL MAKE YOU WANT

18
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:47,000
TO COME BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN.

19
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,958
ALL THIS OVERLOOKS
THE OCEAN WATER, SPARKLING

20
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,875
AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE.

21
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,250
USING THE TICKETS LOKE
GAVE THEM FOR THEIR HELP,

22
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,583
NATSU, LUCY, AND THE OTHERS

23
00:02:56,666 --> 00:03:01,125
ENJOY SOME WELL-DESERVED
FUN IN THE SUN.

24
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,708
- GIVE ME BACK MY BATHING SUIT.
- NO WAY, MAN.

25
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,125
- ( laughing )

26
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,750
I DON'T THINK HAPPY LIKES
BEING USED AS A COVER UP.

27
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:11,416
- MY BELOVED, GRAY.
WHAT A HUNK.

28
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,208
- Happy: THE TOWER OF HEAVEN.

29
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,375
- I REALLY HAD
A GREAT TIME TODAY.

30
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,458
( sighs )
IT WAS WONDERFUL.

31
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:34,375
- Jellal: DON'T YOU SEE? THERE'S
NO FREEDOM IN THIS WORLD.

32
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,875
- ( gasps )

33
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:46,166
( breathing heavily )

34
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,791
JUST A DREAM.

35
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,833
I MUST'VE FALLEN ASLEEP
WITHOUT REALIZING IT.

36
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,500
- ( birds cawing )

37
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:30,458
- I ALWAYS FEEL MORE
AT EASE WEARING ARMOR.

38
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,541
ALTHOUGH, AS A WARDROBE CHOICE,

39
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,375
I GUESS IT'S NOT
THE MOST FEMININE.

40
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,375
- ( knocking on door )

41
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,333
- ERZA. GET OUT OF THE ROOM
AND COME HAVE SOME FUN.

42
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,041
NATSU AND GRAY
ARE DOWNSTAIRS.

43
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,041
WANT TO GO FIND THEM
AND PLAY SOME GAMES?

44
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:46,083
- THAT'S RIGHT, THERE'S A
CASINO HERE, ISN'T THERE?

45
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,000
IN THAT CASE.

46
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,791
- Lucy: WOW.

47
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,750
- SO, HOW DO I LOOK?

48
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,083
- UH, YOU LOOK GREAT.

49
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:05,333
MAYBE A LITTLE ON THE
GLITZY SIDE BUT WHATEVER.

50
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:08,875
- COME ON,
COME ON. LET'S GO.

51
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,791
- I GUESS IT'S OKAY TO RELAX

52
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:14,458
AND ENJOY MYSELF EVERY
ONCE IN A WHILE, ISN'T IT?

53
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:22,583
- ( people chattering )

54
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,208
- ( cheering )

55
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,291
- ( screaming )

56
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:36,875
- SEVENTEEN, COME ON.
- DON'T BE MEAN, SEVENTEEN.

57
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,000
- Natsu: WHOA.
- Happy: YOU GOT IT.

58
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:42,708
- ( machine buzzes )

59
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,541
- ( both screaming )

60
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:47,541
- HEY, WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA?
- CURSE YOU, SEVENTEEN.

61
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,458
- UH SIR, PLEASE DON'T
HIT THE MACHINE.

62
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,875
- BUT IT ACTED LIKE IT WAS
GOING TO GIVE ME MY NUMBER.

63
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,166
IT'S NOT FAIR.

64
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,958
- NO FAIR.
- ( Natsu crying )

65
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,541
- CRYING WON'T HELP, SIR.

66
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,375
- GIVE US A SEVENTEEN RIGHT
NOW THAT MACHINE IS A LIAR.

67
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:02,083
- MAN, THEY ARE SUCH
SORE LOSERS.

68
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,750
- GRAY, MY DARLING.

69
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,083
I'M JUVIA. DO YOU REMEMBER ME?

70
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,083
- YEAH, YOU'RE THAT
CHICK FROM PHANTOM.

71
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,333
- COME BACK SEVENTEEN.
I'LL DO ANYTHING.

72
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,541
- SIR, PLEASE DON'T DO THAT.

73
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,958
- Wally: COOL YOUR JETS, BOY.

74
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,333
EITHER PLAY NICE LIKE
THE REST OF THE GROWN UPS

75
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:23,500
OR HIT THE BRICKS, YOU GET ME?

76
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,291
- SQUARE?
- BLOCKHEAD?

77
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:28,500
- NOW, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
SOME FRIENDLY ADVICE, PAL.

78
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:32,333
IN LIFE, YOU GOT ONE
OF TWO PATHS TO TAKE.

79
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,875
- HUH?

80
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,250
- ( screams )

81
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,791
- WHAT'S YOUR DEAL?
- NATSU.

82
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,750
- YOU CAN EITHER
LIVE A DANDY LIFE...

83
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:47,458
...OR DIE A JEALOUS POSER, SEE?

84
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:50,208
- Gray: I HEARD PHANTOM
WAS DISBANDED.

85
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,958
THAT HAD TO BE TOUGH ON YOU.

86
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:56,750
- YES, BUT NOW I'M A FREE WIZARD
AND I CAN JOIN ANY GUILD I WANT.

87
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:59,250
- I SEE AND I TAKE
IT YOU'RE WANTING

88
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,875
TO BE A MEMBER OF
FAIRY TAIL, HUH?

89
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,833
- OH, YES. VERY MUCH SO.

90
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,708
- I DON'T KNOW, AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT JUST WENT DOWN,

91
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,125
I MEAN, I PERSONALLY DON'T MIND,

92
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,083
BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT
THE MASTER'LL SAY.

93
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,541
- I PROMISE, I'LL DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES!

94
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,666
- IF I WERE YOU, I'D BE CAREFUL
ABOUT MAKING PROMISES LIKE THAT.

95
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,041
- GRAY FULLBUSTER.

96
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,750
- ( people screaming )

97
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,916
- WHAT'S ALL THE
COMMOTION ABOUT?

98
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,916
- IT SOUNDS LIKE THE PARADE
HAS STARTED OUTSIDE.

99
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,291
- Lucy: MAKES SENSE.
- Erza: YEAH.

100
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,958
- JUVIA.

101
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,875
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING, BUDDY?

102
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,833
- WHERE IS ERZA?

103
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,333
- COME ON, SING.

104
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,791
- ERZA?

105
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,000
- OH, WOW, CHECK IT OUT.
YOU TOTALLY GOT A STRAIGHT.

106
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:49,041
- LOOKS LIKE TODAY
IS MY LUCKY DAY.

107
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,208
- DEALER CHANGE.

108
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,166
- RIGHT.

109
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
- I HAVE A FEELING THAT THIS HOT
STREAK IS JUST GETTING STARTED.

110
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,083
- OH, YEAH?

111
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:03,000
- IN THAT CASE,
I'VE GOT A SPECIAL GAME

112
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,333
FOR YOU FOLKS TONIGHT.

113
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,541
AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT,
WHAT DO YOU SAY

114
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:14,333
WE RAISE THE STAKES
A BIT HIGHER, SISTER?

115
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:19,250
- IT CAN'T BE. SHO?
IS THAT YOU?

116
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:23,333
- SO, YOU DO REMEMBER ME.
- YOU KNOW HIM?

117
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:27,875
- YOU'RE... YOU'RE ALIVE?
- ALIVE?

118
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,500
- UH, I MEAN...

119
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,666
- Lucy: YOU OKAY?

120
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:37,750
- NOW, WHERE IS SHE?
- YOU THINK I'D TELL YOU, HUH?

121
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:43,875
- I WON'T ALLOW YOU TO SO MUCH
AS LAY A FINGER ON MY BELOVED.

122
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,000
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO
THROUGH ME FIRST.

123
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,875
- JUVIA.
- ERZA NEEDS YOUR HELP.

124
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,916
I FEAR SHE IS IN GRAVE DANGER.

125
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,375
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

126
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,083
- AH, YOU'VE LOCATED HER.

127
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:03,333
YES, I SEE. SO, I SHOULD CLEAN
THINGS UP HERE? UNDERSTOOD.

128
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,041
- WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LIGHTS?

129
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:11,083
- IT'S MAGIC OF THE DARK
LINEAGE. DARK MOMENT.

130
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,166
- HEY, WHAT GIVES?
WHO TURNED OUT THE LIGHTS?

131
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,333
- Happy: I CAN'T SEE.
WHERE ARE YOU?

132
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,291
- I'M RIGHT HERE,
WHEREVER THAT IS.

133
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,750
- GOOD NIGHT, BOY.

134
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,291
- UH-UH, NO WAY.
- ( gunshot )

135
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,583
- NATSU.

136
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,875
- A GUNSHOT?
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

137
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,083
- WHERE'D HE GO?

138
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,625
- I'M RIGHT HERE, SISTER.

139
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,958
- ( people clamoring )

140
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,166
- OH, NO.

141
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,875
- HE TRAPPED THEM
INSIDE THE CARDS?

142
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,541
- HELP PLEASE.
- COOL, HUH?

143
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,125
- YOU USE MAGIC?

144
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:53,625
- THAT'S RIGHT. YOU'RE NOT THE
ONLY ONE WITH POWERS ANYMORE.

145
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,250
- BUT WHO TAUGHT YOU THAT?

146
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,500
- MEOW.

147
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,375
- LET HER GO.

148
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,375
- WELL, AREN'T YOU ALL ROSY?

149
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:06,583
- MILLIANNA? YOU CAN
USE MAGIC, TOO?

150
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,708
- IT'S BEEN A WHILE, ERZY-WERZY.

151
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,333
- PLEASE, YOU HAVE
TO LET HER GO.

152
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,291
SHE'S OKAY,
SHE'S A FRIEND OF MINE.

153
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,083
- MEOW. A FRIEND, HUH?

154
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,125
- WE USED TO BE FRIENDS
OF YOURS, TOO.

155
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,916
REMEMBER? GOOD FRIENDS.

156
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,958
- THESE CREEPS
WERE HER FRIENDS?

157
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,583
- UH, I DO.

158
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,750
- WE WERE VERY CLOSE.

159
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:27,833
AT LEAST, WE WERE,
UNTIL YOU DECIDED TO BETRAY US.

160
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:33,416
- WHY DON'T YOU CUT
THE DAME A LITTLE SLACK, PAL?

161
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,250
- KEEP THOSE
EMOTIONS IN CHECK

162
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,541
AND EVERYTHING WILL
BE REAL DANDY.

163
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,083
- WHAT? A BLOCKHEAD.

164
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,500
- VERY NICE. LIFE ON THE
OUTSIDE'S BEEN GOOD TO YOU,

165
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:44,541
HUH, DOLL?

166
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,875
- WAIT A MINUTE, WALLY?

167
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,333
- I'VE GONE THROUGH
SOME CHANGES MYSELF.

168
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,041
OLD MAD DOG
WALLY YOU GREW UP

169
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,625
WITH HAS SEEN A LOT
SINCE THE OLD DAYS.

170
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:57,291
YOU SEE, I'M MUCH
SMOOTHER NOW.

171
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,791
- YOU PRACTICE MAGIC AS WELL?

172
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,958
- WHY ARE YOU SO SURPRISED?

173
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,541
IT'S NOT THAT HARD ONCE
YOU GET THE HANG OF IT.

174
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,416
OF COURSE, YOU ALREADY
KNEW THAT, DIDN'T YOU?

175
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,166
- SIMON.
-( screams )

176
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:15,916
- ERZA, WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
WHY IS HE CALLING YOU SISTER?

177
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,291
- ( sighs )

178
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:22,916
HE'S NOT ACTUALLY MY BROTHER.
BUT WE ALL GREW UP TOGETHER.

179
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,083
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

180
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,750
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU
JOINED FAIRY TAIL

181
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,833
WHEN YOU WERE JUST
A LITTLE GIRL.

182
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:31,583
- THIS WAS BEFORE
I JOINED THE GUILD.

183
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,875
WHY DID YOU FIND ME?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

184
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,125
- REALLY WANT TO KNOW?

185
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,875
- WE'RE HERE TO TAKE
YOU BACK WITH US.

186
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,958
- I'M BEGGING YOU.
PLEASE RELEASE LUCY.

187
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:45,250
- WHO CARES ABOUT HER?
WE WANT YOU, SISTER.

188
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:49,583
- LISTEN BIM. DON'T MAKE
THIS GET UGLY.

189
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:54,000
- NO, DON'T HURT HER.
NO. PLEASE, WALLY.

190
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,041
- ( screams )

191
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:01,458
- ERZA. SOMEBODY HELP.

192
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,166
- WE GOT WHAT WE CAME
FOR. LET'S GO HOME.

193
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,791
- SURE SHE'S OKAY?

194
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,416
- SHE'S JUST TAKING A NAP.

195
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,666
- Lucy: HOLD IT.

196
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,125
JUST WHERE DO YOU JERKS
THINK YOU'RE TAKING HER?

197
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:23,625
I HOPE YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO GET AWAY WITH THIS.

198
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,083
NATSU AND GRAY ARE GOING
TO FIND YOU AND WHEN THEY DO,

199
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,083
THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE YOU PAY.

200
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,541
- SORRY TOOTS, BUT THOSE GINKS
GOING TO BE LICKING PAVEMENT

201
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:31,958
FOR A WHILE, YOU GET ME?

202
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:32,958
- WHAT?

203
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,458
- THOSE TWO WERE
NOTHING BUT TALK.

204
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:39,166
- Lucy: BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
YOU MEAN THEY'RE...

205
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,166
- Wally: YEAH, SLEEPING
THE BIG SLEEP.

206
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,291
- MEOW.

207
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,041
- ( moans in pain )

208
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,666
- MEOW. IN ABOUT ANOTHER FIVE
MINUTES, YOU'RE GOING TO BE

209
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,500
ALL TWISTED UP JUST LIKE
A YUMMY LITTLE PRETZEL.

210
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,958
- HEY, MILLIANA. I SCORED A
LITTLE SOMETHING FOR YOU.

211
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,083
- MEOW?

212
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,583
OH, A KITTY OF MY VERY OWN.

213
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,416
HE IS SUCH A LITTLE
CUTIE-WOOTIE.

214
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,625
- HAPPY.
- THAT'S ENOUGH. CALM DOWN

215
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,000
AND TIE ERZA UP.

216
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,458
- ALL RIGHT, DOLL.
TIME TO GET TO WORK.

217
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,958
- MEOW.

218
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,041
- SISTER...

219
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,458
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
FINALLY COMING HOME

220
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,666
TO THE TOWER OF HEAVEN.

221
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,958
I KNOW JELLAL WILL BE
HAPPY TO SEE YOU.

222
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,666
- THE TOWER OF HEAVEN.

223
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,916
DID THEY REALLY FINISH IT?

224
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:36,625
- Lucy: WHERE ARE YOU
TAKING HER? COME BACK.

225
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,625
SHE'S GONE.

226
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,666
( grunts )

227
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,833
I SWEAR I'M GOING TO GET
OUT OF THIS THING SOMEHOW.

228
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,416
( grunting continues )

229
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,208
YES. HERE WE GO.

230
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:56,916
OPEN GATE OF THE
GIANT CRAB. CANCER.

231
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:05,833
UH. OKAY. CANCER?
COME ON. FINE.

232
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:10,375
WHAT ABOUT TAURUS?
LOKE? PLEASE HELP.

233
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,250
- ( people clamoring )

234
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:17,583
- WHY CAN'T I USE MY KEYS?
IS IT BECAUSE OF THIS ROPE?

235
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,083
OW, WHAT THE...

236
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,333
- WHOOPS, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

237
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,875
- HEY, WAS THAT YOU
THAT POKED ME?

238
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,833
- YEAH. I JUST HAPPENED TO HAVE
THIS LETTER OPENER IN MY POCKET

239
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,416
AND I THOUGHT I MIGHT
BE ABLE TO USE IT

240
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,250
TO CUT MY WAY
OUT OF THIS THING.

241
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,333
BUT I GUESS
I ACCIDENTALLY GOT YOU.

242
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:32,791
- Man: OH, I'LL TRY THAT, TOO.

243
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,291
- Woman: MAYBE WE CAN GET OUT.

244
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,541
- EVEN THOUGH HIS KNIFE'S INSIDE
THE CARD. I COULD FEEL IT.

245
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,583
- WHOA.
- SIR, I DON'T KNOW,

246
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:40,916
I MAY BE WRONG ABOUT THIS,

247
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,916
BUT I GET THE FEELING
OBJECTS INSIDE YOUR CARDS

248
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,125
MIGHT BE ABLE TO BREAK
THROUGH THEM.

249
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,375
- YOU THINK SO?

250
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,166
WHEN I DO THIS,
DOES IT LOOK TO YOU LIKE

251
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,791
THE KNIFE IS POKING OUT AT ALL?

252
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,666
- NO, IT LOOKS FLAT. BUT IF I
FELT IT THEN THAT MEANS

253
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,416
IT HAS TO HAVE SOME KIND OF
EFFECT ON WHAT'S OUTSIDE.

254
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,041
DO ME A FAVOR, I
NEED YOU TO TRY

255
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,958
AND CUT THROUGH THIS
ROPE WITH IT, OKAY?

256
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,833
- I'LL GIVE IT A SHOT.

257
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:05,083
- Man 2: YEAH COME ON, YOU CAN
DO IT. I JUST KNOW YOU CAN.

258
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,041
- ( screams )
PLEASE HURRY.

259
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,041
- I'M TRYING, LADY.
DON'T RUSH ME.

260
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,416
- SORRY BUT THIS HURTS.

261
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,083
WHOA, YOU DID IT.

262
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,333
THANKS A LOT. I OWE YOU ONE.

263
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:21,583
- YOU'RE WELCOME. YOU THINK
YOU CAN HELP US OUT NOW?

264
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:26,583
- I GOT TO RUN BUT I PROMISE
I'LL COME BACK TO HELP.

265
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,333
I GOT TO FIND THE BOYS.

266
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:31,041
I HOPE THAT GUY WAS
LYING AND THEY'RE OKAY.

267
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:37,916
WHAT HAPPENED? OH, NO.
SNAP OUT OF IT, GRAY.

268
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,250
TALK TO ME.

269
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,791
HE'S COLD.

270
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:46,500
( screams )

271
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,375
OH MY GOSH, I'M SO SORRY.
YOU'RE GOING BE OKAY.

272
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,708
I'LL FIX YOU UP IN
NO TIME I SWEAR.

273
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,708
( screams )

274
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,916
- Juvia: THERE'S
NO NEED TO PANIC.

275
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,500
- I REMEMBER YOU.
YOU'RE WITH THE ELEMENT FOUR.

276
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,416
- Gray: LUCY, WAIT.

277
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,208
SHE'S NOT OUR ENEMY ANYMORE.

278
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,750
- YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

279
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,958
I PULLED MY PRECIOUS GRAY INSIDE
OF ME TO ENSURE HIS SAFETY.

280
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,333
- IS IT JUST ME OR DOES
THAT SEEM REALLY WEIRD?

281
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,583
- ARE YOU JEALOUS, HE WAS
INSIDE OF ME AND NOT YOU?

282
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,166
- UH, NOT REALLY, NO.

283
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,166
- THIS DUDE CAST A DARKNESS
SPELL SO I CREATED AN ICE DECOY

284
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,166
TO DISTRACT HIM UNTIL I COULD
FIGURE OUT MY PLAN OF ATTACK.

285
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,125
- I WANTED TO KEEP THE REAL
GRAY SAFE FROM HARM,

286
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,833
SO, I PULLED HIM INSIDE
OF MY WATER LOCK

287
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,833
UNTIL I WAS SURE
THE DANGER HAD PASSED.

288
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,916
- YEAH, AND I COULDN'T DO
ANYTHING FROM IN THERE.

289
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,583
THANKS TO YOU,
THE CREEP GOT AWAY.

290
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:33,916
- ( gasps )

291
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,083
- NOW WHAT? DO YOU KNOW
WHERE EVERYONE ELSE IS?

292
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:40,250
- NO, I DON'T. IT'S BAD.
THEY TOOK ERZA AND HAPPY.

293
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,583
- ( screaming )

294
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,041
- Lucy: IS THAT?

295
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,458
- THE NERVE OF THAT GUY.

296
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,583
- Lucy: NATSU.
- Gray: NATSU.

297
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:50,958
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

298
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,750
- HEY, WHAT KIND OF JERK
SHOOTS PEOPLE IN THE MOUTH?

299
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:57,291
HUH? I MEAN SOMEONE
COULD GET REALLY HURT.

300
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:01,083
- UH, I THINK THAT'D KILL ANYONE
WHO WASN'T A WEIRDO LIKE YOU.

301
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,916
- I WOULD HAVE TO AGREE.

302
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,291
- I'LL SHOW THAT BLOCKHEAD.

303
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,458
HE'S NOT GETTING AWAY WITH THIS.

304
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:08,708
- FOLLOW HIM.

305
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,375
- WAIT. UH, DOES HE EVEN
KNOW WHERE HE'S GOING?

306
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:15,541
NATSU HAS A NOSE FOR PREY THAT'D
PUT WILD ANIMALS TO SHAME.

307
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,708
- I'M COMING FOR YOU, BLOCKHEAD.

308
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,333
( grunts )

309
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,250
- ( growls )

310
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,458
- ( footsteps approaching )

311
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:59,750
- MASTER JELLAL.

312
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,541
WE'VE RECEIVED WORD
THE MISSION TO RETRIEVE

313
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,250
ERZA HAS BEEN COMPLETED.

314
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,625
THEY ARE RETURNING AS WE SPEAK.

315
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:12,125
I MUST ASK, WHAT ARE WE TO GAIN
BY CAPTURING THAT TRAITOR?

316
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,541
DISPOSING OF HER WOULD HAVE BEEN

317
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:17,125
EASY WORK FOR SOMEONE
OF YOUR POWER.

318
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,791
- ( chuckles )

319
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,166
A RATHER PEDESTRIAN
APPROACH TO SOLVING

320
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,291
THE PROBLEM IN MY OPINION.

321
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,625
- YES SIR.

322
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,833
- HOWEVER, WITH THE TOWER
OF HEAVEN NOW COMPLETE,

323
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,625
ALLOWING HER TO LIVE WOULD PROVE
TO BE A THORNY ISSUE INDEED.

324
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:35,833
SO THE TIME HAS COME.

325
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,666
ERZA SCARLET IS THE
PERFECT SACRIFICE

326
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,166
TO ENSURE MY DREAMS
ARE MADE FLESH.

327
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,875
- THIS PLACE, WHERE ARE WE?

328
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,416
- INSIDE THE HOLD OF A
SHIP AT SEA.

329
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,333
- A SHIP?

330
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:10,916
- THAT'S RIGHT. AND OUR COURSE
IS SET FOR THE TOWER OF HEAVEN.

331
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:18,500
- I SEE. I SHOULD'VE KNOWN.
WOULD YOU PLEASE UNTIE ME?

332
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,166
I WON'T CAUSE ANY TROUBLE.

333
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:25,333
- I'M AFRAID I CAN'T. YOU'VE
PROVEN YOURSELF UNTRUSTWORTHY.

334
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,208
THAT WON'T HELP. MILLIANA'S
BINDINGS CAN SEAL MAGIC,

335
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,833
SO, YOU'RE STRUGGLING IN VAIN.

336
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,750
YOU'LL FIND YOU HAVE NO LUCK
IN BREAKING FREE FROM THEM.

337
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:37,250
THE EFFORTS WILL
JUST TIRE YOU OUT.

338
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,708
- FINE. I WON'T RESIST.

339
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:44,916
BUT PLEASE, SHO, WILL YOU ALLOW
ME TO REQUIP INTO MY ARMOR?

340
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,708
THE TOWER.

341
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:52,750
I'M AFRAID OF GOING BACK THERE.

342
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:57,375
I JUST WANT TO HAVE IT ON,
SO THAT I FEEL SAFE.

343
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,083
- BUT THE OUTFIT YOU
HAVE ON NOW IS LOVELY.

344
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:13,041
HONESTLY, I DIDN'T WANT
IT TO HAPPEN LIKE THIS.

345
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,250
- IT'S OKAY.

346
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:19,750
- I'VE MISSED YOU SO
MUCH. IT HURTS ME.

347
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:28,541
TELL ME. WHY?
WHY'D YOU DO IT?

348
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:31,500
WHY'D YOU BETRAY JELLAL?

349
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,166
- Erza: JELLAL.

350
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,666
- OVER HERE.
COME ON, HURRY UP.

351
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,333
- GEEZ. WE GOTTA TRY
TO BE QUIET, YOU DUMMY.

352
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:53,166
- HEY YOU'RE BEING EVEN LOUDER
THAN HE IS RIGHT NOW.

353
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,500
- AH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

354
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,541
- COME ON, ERZA.
WE GOT TO MOVE QUICK

355
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,125
OR THE GUARDS WILL CATCH US.

356
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,916
- YEAH. I KNOW.

357
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,375
I WANT TO GO BUT I'M SCARED.

358
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:10,500
BECAUSE, I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO ALL THE OTHER KIDS.

359
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:13,333
THEY'RE DEAD.

360
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,750
- THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY
ABOUT. WE'RE GOING TO BE FINE.

361
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,041
- OH, JELLAL.

362
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:23,333
- WE'RE FINALLY GETTING
BACK OUR FREEDOM.

363
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:26,583
OUR FUTURE. OUR DREAMS.

364
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,916
LET'S GO. OKAY?

365
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,708
- OKAY.

366
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:14,791
- SINCE POOR LITTLE
HAPPY'S BEEN CATNAPPED,

367
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:17,125
I'VE GOT TO DO THIS
PREVIEW ALL BY MYSELF.

368
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:20,916
SO, I GUESS I SHOULD EXPLAIN
"OPERATION SAVE HAPPY AND ERZA".

369
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,166
IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE REALLY.

370
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,875
RUSH IN AND START
BEATING EVERYONE UP

371
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:25,458
TILL THEY TELL US
WHERE THEY ARE.

372
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:28,125
AND I'VE GOT THE PERFECT
CODE WORD, CHARGE.

373
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,916
LET'S GO IN AND GET THEM GUYS.

374
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,916
- Natsu and Happy:
NEXT TIME, JELLAL.

375
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,666
- Natsu: YOU'RE HERE. WHOA,
WHY'RE YOU ALL SCRUFFY LOOKING?

376
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,500
- Happy: I'VE GOT A LADY FRIEND
AND SHE LOVES HER SOME HAPPY.

377
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:41,416
- Natsu: AW, MAN, THAT WAS
A VISUAL IMAGE I DIDN'T NEED.
