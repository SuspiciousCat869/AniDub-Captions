1
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:21,666
[OPHIUCHUS] The Celestial
Globe serves as a conduit.

2
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,458
It channels power from the
constellations of the zodiac

3
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:25,833
to my king.

4
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:28,583
The ritual we set out
to perform's sole purpose

5
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:31,875
is to grant him
the zodiac's strength.

6
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:35,041
It's called the "Liberam Verus".

7
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,166
Becoming an
Eclipse spirit did endow

8
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,708
the Celestial Spirit king,

9
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:41,083
who was already the
strongest being in his world,

10
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,291
with power greater
than he had ever known,

11
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,958
but it also gave him
an appetite to match.

12
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,541
Fearful of his mighty hunger,

13
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:51,041
the zodiac spirits attempted to
flee the celestial world.

14
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,166
They strove to be free of him.

15
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,458
But their celestial
bodies pulled them back

16
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,541
to the stars.
To resist was to suffer,

17
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,125
and to give in was to die.

18
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:02,666
The setup was perfect.

19
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,166
With the false hope
of the Liberam,

20
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,916
I set them and you
to work at granting my king

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
the power he craves.

22
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:12,125
The Celestial Spirit King
was that affected?

23
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,541
We thought we were
fighting to protect the spirits,

24
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:17,333
but we ended up putting
them right into harm's way.

25
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:20,000
To think we've been
banishing them to the very place

26
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:22,500
that they were so desperately
struggling to escape.

27
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,916
A world ruled by a
power-crazed monster.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,291
How awful...

29
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,083
I can't believe this crap!

30
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,125
That isn't the
worst of it, either.

31
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:35,625
If this demented Celestial
Spirit King goes unchecked,

32
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:37,625
if his rampage can't be stopped,

33
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:42,041
then the celestial spirit world
will collapse in on itself.

34
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,125
Ya mean the whole damn place?

35
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:45,500
[OPHIUCHUS] Indeed.

36
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:48,750
Princess Hisui's prediction
may well come to pass.

37
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,458
[growling noise]

38
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,041
Didja hear that growling?

39
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:55,958
It sounded like a wild animal!

40
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:59,583
[laughing]

41
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:02,166
Time to move!

42
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,208
Yeah!

43
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,833
[OPHIUCHUS laughing maniacally]

44
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,208
Enough of your noise!

45
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:10,750
You and your king
seem pretty desperate

46
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,750
to get yourselves hurt.

47
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,791
Ya don't need to destroy
the whole world for that.

48
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,708
I got your pain right here!

49
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,625
[OPHIUCHUS] You're
completely out of options.

50
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,500
There is absolutely
nothing you can do

51
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,708
to save your precious zodiac.

52
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,416
I don't give a
crap about my options!

53
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,166
I'm gonna stop you
no matter what!

54
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,916
[HAPPY] When the Stars Fall!

55
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,416
Listen. I got this.

56
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,208
I can handle Ophiuchus.

57
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,791
Take out that globe!

58
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:02,083
[OPHIUCHUS] I've already
told you, human.

59
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,166
There's no stopping me now!

60
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
Wish I had a jewel

61
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,875
for every time
someone said that to me.

62
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:12,083
Right before
I kicked their butts!

63
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,916
[flute playing]

64
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,125
[HAPPY, NATSU yelling]

65
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,458
Natsu!

66
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:22,666
What happened?

67
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,875
[LUCY] No idea.

68
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,083
All she did was play
something on her flute.

69
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,125
I'm not sure,

70
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:32,166
but it looked like
The Serpent's Dance of Death.

71
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,583
[LUCY]
But what does that mean?

72
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,000
[HISUI] It allows her to
control any object or substance

73
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,916
in her sight,
merely by playing that flute.

74
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,041
[ERZA] This doesn't bode well.

75
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,375
[PANTHERLILY] Things must be
getting rough up there.

76
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,791
That's right.

77
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,750
Just one more reason
not to stand around waiting!

78
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:56,958
Let's get moving.

79
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,791
Natsu and Wendy are
gonna need some backup!

80
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,708
Yeah, but which
way should we go?

81
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,041
We can hear their voices,

82
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,916
but there's no telling
where they're comin' from!

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,166
Gray, darling!

84
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,375
I think we should
look for them over there.

85
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,666
just the two of us,
you and me, alone!

86
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,500
[GRAY] Drivin' that in
kinda hard, aren't ya?

87
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,833
[JUVIA] I don't know
how else to do it,

88
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,750
but I'm willing to learn.

89
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,166
This is hardly the time
for you two to get cozy!

90
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,458
We're not!

91
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,333
Let's just pick a
direction and start moving!

92
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,583
Can everyone please calm down?

93
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,041
Check it out!

94
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,375
Did you find something useful?

95
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,458
It has to do with
the term "Trinitas".

96
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,875
[CANA] Trinitas, huh?
Kay, what about it?

97
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:33,291
[LEVY] I had the entire passage
translated except for that word.

98
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,666
But I think I've got it now!

99
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,208
[flute playing]

100
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,250
[LEVY]
"Trinitas" means "trinity".

101
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,291
And in the context
of this ancient language,

102
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:46,083
a trinity is comprised
of parent, child and spirit.

103
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,166
Which spirit?

104
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,291
What are you saying?

105
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,041
The parent's Ophiuchus.

106
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,333
And the snake...

107
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,000
No, Astral Spiritus
itself must be the child.

108
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,125
Which means "spirit"...

109
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,541
...must refer
to the shining light

110
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,666
that's pouring out
of the Celestial Globe!

111
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah. That would
make sense to me.

112
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,041
So what does that
have to do with anything?

113
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,500
The three are much
stronger when they're united.

114
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:13,208
So it looks like the only way
to stop Liberam Verus now

115
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,833
is to destroy each
piece of the Trinitas at once!

116
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:16,958
Understood.

117
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,375
[flute playing]

118
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,833
[ERZA] We might not
be able to find Natsu,

119
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,583
but we can still assist him.

120
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,750
We'll leave the snake charmer
and the globe to his team

121
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,666
and deal with the serpent
of Astral Spiritus ourselves.

122
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,833
[CANA] You want us to fight
the thing we're standing in?

123
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,583
How would we even start?

124
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,875
[ERZA] I have a theory about
the source of all these tremors.

125
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,125
This might sound odd,

126
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,666
but I believe they're
caused by the serpent

127
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,000
shedding its skin in
order to alter its structure

128
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,000
as a kind of survival mechanism.

129
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,208
And if I'm correct,

130
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,791
then I say we
should help it along

131
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,250
until it's got
nothing left to shed.

132
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:56,250
So your plan is to tear
the monster apart from within.

133
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,458
[GAJEEL chuckles]

134
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,625
You tellin' me I can
smash whatever I want?

135
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,375
[PANTHERLILY]
That is the Fairy Tail way.

136
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,375
We'll teach the
snake girl a lesson.

137
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,916
If you sit on a
three legged throne,

138
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
it's far easier
for us to kick you off!

139
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,500
Let's do this!

140
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:09,708
[ALL] Yeah!

141
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:16,333
Look out! Sky Dragon...

Arcadios, are you hurt?

145
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,000
Fear not, princess.

146
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,958
He's all right,
but what about you?

147
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,541
I'm fine.

148
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,916
Never mind me, we need to fully
focus on destroying the globe!

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,375
Its defenses
are quite formidable.

150
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,250
Wendy, let's see what happens

151
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,041
if we attack it together,
all right?

152
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,208
Yeah, sure!

153
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,125
Fleuve d'étoiles!

154
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:58,458
Sky Dragon Wing Attack!

155
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,541
How are we supposed
to deal with that?

156
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,333
[flute playing]

157
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,083
[HAPPY] Here it comes!
What do we do?

158
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,750
We can't back down!

159
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:10,875
Natsu!

[yelling]

A mere human,
soaring through the sky.

162
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:24,500
How arrogant.

[OPHIUCHUS laughs]

167
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,416
A lowly human can never
reach the level of the stars,

168
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,833
but if you really want to
fly, I'll help you.

Cut it out! Crap...
Just hang in there, Happy!

You okay?

00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,791
We won't back down, right?

[HAPPY] Our heads are
thicker than she thinks!

That's right! Let's go!

[growls]

179
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,458
I've never seen
a wall fight back before.

180
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,500
Doesn't matter.

181
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,833
It can't take
both of us at once.

[ELFMAN] Whatever you do,
keep on attacking!

[MIRAJANE] Don't stop while you
still have magic left!

[JUVIA] What is this?

185
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,458
Looks like the
obligatory dungeon trap!

186
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,541
Well guess what?

187
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,583
There isn't a
trap in this world

188
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,041
that can put an end
to the two of us.

189
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:48,500
Finish it!

190
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,208
Right. Leave it to me.

There any metal here?

195
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,625
I'm sick of all
this friggin' rock.

196
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,291
Don't count my cards out yet.

Solid Script Magic: Drill!

[LUCY] It's kicking back
everything we throw at it.

200
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:38,208
Still, there
has to be something.

201
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,583
Let me take a crack at it.

202
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:40,791
Go for it!

203
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,166
Hey there.

204
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,166
This is Deneb,
the White Swan!

205
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,500
[DENEB] Go on.

206
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,291
Stop staring and ask me
why my wings aren't white.

207
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,416
I know you want to.

208
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,791
Uhh...
Nice to meet you too, Deneb.

209
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,041
D'you see that globe?

210
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,416
Destroy it if you can.

211
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,583
[DENEB] All right, fine.

212
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,958
There's certainly
nothing better to do.

213
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,625
"If you can," she says.

214
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:10,250
Maybe I would try harder
if my wizard believed in me!

215
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,916
You've got this!

216
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,333
I believe in you!

If you must humor me,

218
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,708
don't wait until
I've screwed up first!

219
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,083
Come on!
Break, ya damn orb!

220
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,000
Can't something
work out my way for once?

[screaming]

222
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:22,625
[DENEB] You were right.

223
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,833
I'm just as useless
as you think I am.

224
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,333
Sorry I'm not better.

[YUKINO] Deneb, no!

226
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,250
[WENDY] Uhh...

227
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,000
[LUCY] He's actually
a pretty tough spirit.

228
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,416
But he's got some
insecurity issues.

229
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,833
He vented practically all
of his angst on it, though.

230
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:37,916
How did it survive?

231
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,833
Uhh, Yukino?

232
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,625
How does that surprise you?

We can do this!

I am, thanks to you.

But please stop throwing
yourself into danger!

[WENDY] It's okay, Princess.
He'll be fine.

You take care
of the globe! Hurry!

This doesn't look good.

00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:55,000
We gotta stop it. Fast!

281
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,416
[OPHIUCHUS]
As you can see,

282
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,708
the Liberam Verus has entered
its final phase at last.

283
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,958
Soon its red light will
fill the Astral Spiritus,

284
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,041
draining the life force
of every member

285
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,708
of the Zodiac but me.

286
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,125
And when it does,

287
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,458
the Celestial Spirit King
shall acquire

288
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,708
more power than
you've ever imagined!

289
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,416
If you shoot that
much power into him,

290
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,000
he'll probably explode!

291
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,583
Lucy and the others...

292
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:20,208
They're bound to their spirits.
And I don't mean by contract.

293
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,583
They've put their
hearts into those bonds.

294
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:23,916
Natsu...

295
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,958
[HAPPY] He's right!
They're all connected!

296
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,166
Those bonds mean
everything to them.

297
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,708
And I won't let you cut 'em!

298
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,708
I'm bored with
the Dance of Death.

299

How's this?

00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,666
It's The Death Penalty.

00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,000
Didn't even feel it.

304

Stop worryin' about us!

305
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,000
Focus on the celestial globe!

306
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,083
We can take her!

307
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,208
But you gotta
break that thing, quick!

308

We haven't even
put a scratch on it yet!

309
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,833
There has to be a way.

310
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,208
We can't have come
this far for nothing!

311
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,750
The demolition's going well,
but what's our exit strategy?

312
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,916
Don't think anyone
thought that far ahead.

313
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,375
[PANTHERLILY]
Figured as much.

314
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,500
You did good, Juvia.

315
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:27,750
[JUVIA]
And it was worth the effort

316
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,000
to get alone with you
beneath this open sky.

317

Oh, darling!
Catch me if I faint!

318
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,916
You'd better not count on it.

Don't give up.
I've got a plan!

00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,625
Without that flute,
she can't do crap!

323
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,125
If we can take it out,
the rest should be easy!

anything about givin' up?

00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,416
Oh yeah! The flute!

326
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,250
Geez man, you sure did take
your time figuring that one out!

327
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,083
Less time than you!

328
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,500
Get us in closer, will ya?

329
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:20,958
[HAPPY] Aye, Sir!

330
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:32,791
It isn't working!

331
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,916
I think the light's
blocking my healing magic!

332
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,791
Be strong, Arcadios.

333
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:40,958
[ALL gasp]

334
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,583
Libra and Virgo
must've felt this pain.

335
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,208
Yet they kept on
fighting until the end.

336
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,791
To be free.

337
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,416
[HISUI]
First the Eclipse Project.

338
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,791
And then those keys.

339
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,791
I'm the reason
we're all suffering!

340
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,041
[LUCY] No one blames you.

341
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,666
There's no way
you could've known!

342
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,916
[HISUI] I deserve this pain.
A thousand fold.

343
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,583
I've earned it.

344
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,000
That isn't true.

345
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:07,125
You screwed up,
but you tried to make it right!

346
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,666
Listen. It's okay.

347
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,250
Everybody fails.
That's just part of being human.

348
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,333
Yes, but...

349
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,958
[LUCY]
We don't have time for regret.

350
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,916
We have to make a stand!

351
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,041
[HISUI] A stand for what?

352
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,833
A stand for our spirits!

353
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,291
That globe can take
the magic from the stars.

354
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,541
Now tell me what you are!

355
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:31,000
I am a... I'm a
celestial wizard, like you.

356
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,166
We have to stop this.

357
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,000
In fact, the three of us...

358
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:38,625
We are the only ones
who possibly can.

359
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,833
[HISUI] There is a way.
And it will hurt.

360
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,875
We must make the stars
in heaven rain down.

361
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,333
[LUCY] How is that possible?

362
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:49,333
There's a spell.
Long forgotten hyper-magic.

363
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,458
It was known as Gottfried.

364
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,250
There's no choice.
Start it.

365
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,208
[HISUI]
Hands of the welkin.

366
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,833
Clench thy mighty fists.

367
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,166
I bid the star's descent!

368
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,291
[CARLA] Wendy!

369
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:18,083
If he can last,
so can I!

370
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,250
Hurry, please!

371
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,916
[OPHIUCHUS]
Your efforts are futile.

372
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,583
The light of the Liberam
will fill this place soon.

373
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,291
Why can't you understand
that you came too late?

374
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,958
[NATSU]
Don't let them distract you!

375
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,666
You're fightin' me!

376
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,291
[HISUI] Shine down.

377
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,458
Break the land upon your light.

378
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,625
Cleanse it with
your hands divine.

379
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:47,500
Let there be no
place left for darkness.

380
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,333
Fall straight and true.

381
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,500
I bid thee.

382
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,583
Bring empyrean
crashing down upon us!

383
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,791
Shine down! Gottfried!

384
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,333
[screaming]

385
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,250
I can sense it.

386
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,625
One final blow and it's done.

387
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:53,125
[HISUI, YUKINO, LUCY
whimpering]

388
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,791
Black Fire Dragon mode!

389
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,208
What's that?

390
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,541
Dragon Slayer Secret Art!

391
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:14,208
Pitch-Black Phoenix Sword!

392
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,958
[HAPPY] Hey, Natsu.

393
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:15,625
Whaddaya think this
evil Celestial Spirit King

394
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:16,708
is gonna be like?

395
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,333
[NATSU]
Maybe he talks super-fast now!

396
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,875
[HAPPY] Yeah!

397
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,750
A bunch of other spirits did
turn into their total opposites!

398
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:24,166
I mean, look at Loke!
He stopped likin' girls!

399
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,625
[NATSU]
I bet the king's gone bald!

400
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,125
[HAPPY] Seems likely to me!

401
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:29,125
[NATSU] And he was huge before,
so what if he's tiny now?

402
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:30,541
[HAPPY] Let's see then.

403
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:33,208
He must've turned into a bald,
fast-talkin, ant-man!

404
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:34,666
[NATSU]
Well I hope he can fight.

405
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,333
[HAPPY, NATSU] Next time:
Celestial Spirit Beast!

406
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:38,375
[HAPPY] What?

407
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:40,208
This is the
Celestial Spirit King?

408
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:41,958
[NATSU]
Man. We weren't even close!
