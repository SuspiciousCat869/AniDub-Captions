BACK IN THE WORLD OF EDOLAS,

26
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:10,166
THE TOWNSPEOPLE HAVE
BEGUN REBUILDING.

27
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,541
- HEY, WE'RE GONNA NEED
SOME MORE BRICKS OVER HERE.

28
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,333
- WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

29
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,041
FAUST WAS CALLED
THE DARK KING, AFTER ALL.

30
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,500
- YEAH, I DIDN'T EXPECT
THIS MUCH DAMAGE.

31
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:21,166
- HELL YEAH.
- LET'S NOT FIGHT.

32
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,041
WE NEED TO FOCUS
ON REBUILDING, OKAY?

33
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,166
- HE'S RIGHT.
IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE HARDER

34
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,708
WITHOUT MAGIC,
BUT WE CAN DO IT.

35
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,375
ARE YOU WITH ME?
- Men: YEAH!

36
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:32,166
- THINGS ARE STARTING
TO LOOK UP AROUND HERE.

37
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,833
- ( Happy speaking )

38
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,291
- I BROUGHT THE PRISONERS.

39
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,833
- Lucy: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

40
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,416
YOU GOT TO
BE KIDDING ME!

41
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,333
- WHAT? DO I LOOK
LIKE I'M KIDDING?

42
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,458
- I KNOW I ASKED YOU TO COME UP
WITH A CREATIVE WAY

43
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:59,041
FOR US TO BE ABLE THE GUILD
FROM PLACE TO PLACE...

44
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,375
BUT WHAT THE HECK
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE?

45
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:06,250
- YOU DON'T REALLY EXPECT US
TO PULL IT AROUND, DO YOU?

46
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,291
- LIKE IT OR NOT,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO.

47
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,833
WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE
MAGIC POWER, REMEMBER?

48
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:14,041
- THOUGHT YOU COULD 
SNEAK AWAY, DID YOU?

49
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:17,708
- NO, I, UH--
HEY, WAIT, I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

50
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,250
WE COULD TOW IT
WITH MY MAGIC MOBILE.

51
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,708
MY MACHINE HAS GOT 
SOME SERIOUS POWER.

52
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,750
I'M A FREAKING GENIUS.

53
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,083
OH YEAH!

54
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,875
GO FIRE!

55
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,875
- ( honks )
- UH-OH.

56
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,500
- WHY IS HE HAVING
TROUBLE WITH IT?

57
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,458
- BECAUSE HE'S AN IDIOT
WHO DOESN'T REALIZE

58
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,000
THAT YOU CAN'T START UP
A MAGIC MOBILE

59
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,541
WITHOUT MAGIC POWER.

60
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,541
- YOU'RE AS SMART
AS YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL.

61
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,541
- SPEAKING OF IDIOTS,
WOULD YOU LAY OFF?

62
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,416
- THAT WAS MEAN.
- I'M SORRY, LUCY.

63
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,541
- I HAD A FEELING YOU
WERE GONNA SCREW UP. 

64
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,541
- THAT'S MEAN!

65
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,458
- LISTEN UP, THE GUILD HALL

66
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,458
ISN'T GONNA DRAG ITSELF
TO ROYAL CITY.

67
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,250
EVERYONE TO YOUR POSITIONS.
- YEAH!

68
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:03,166
- Men: HEAVE HO!
HEAVE HO!

69
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,250
HEAVE HO!
HEAVE HO!

70
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,916
- YOU READY? LET'S GO?
- Men: HEAVE HO!  HEAVE HO!

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,791
- Mirajane: OKAY.
- HEAVE HO! HEAVE HO!

72
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,750
- ( groaning )

73
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,083
- EXCUSE ME, WHY AREN'T
YOU LADIES HELPING?

74
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,458
- HOW RUDE!

75
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:18,875
YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER
THAN TO ASK

76
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,125
DELICATE MAIDENS LIKE US
TO HAUL THAT THING.

77
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,625
- WHAT?! DELICATE MAIDENS?!
YOU?!

78
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,166
- EDOLAS'S ROYAL CITY 
HAS ENTERED A NEW ERA.

79
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,083
IT'S PEOPLE ARE NOW
LOOKING FORWARD TO THE FUTURE.

80
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:36,041
HOWEVER, THEY HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN
THE PAIN AND TROUBLE

81
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,166
YOU'VE CAUSED THEM
IN THE PAST.

82
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,708
THEREFORE, YOU MUST BE GIVEN
DUE PUNISHMENT FOR YOUR ACTIONS.

83
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:44,125
- YES, WE UNDERSTAND.

84
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:47,416
- AS THE NEW KING,
I HEREBY PROCLAIM,

85
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,208
SIR FAUST, YOU'RE PERMANENTLY
EXILED FROM THE KINGDOM.

86
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,916
YOU ARE PROHIBITED
FROM EVER SETTING FOOT

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,250
IN THE ROYAL CITY AGAIN.

88
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,291
- ( sighs )

89
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,833
- THE POOR GUY.

90
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,833
- ERZA KNIGHTWALKER,

91
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:05,083
YOU CANNOT LEAVE THE KINGDOM

92
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,208
UNLESS I'VE AUTHORIZED YOU
TO DO SO.

93
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,166
- I'M PREPARED TO DIE
FOR MY SINS.

94
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,541
YOU NEEDN'T HOLD BACK.

95
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,333
- I'M NOT.
I ORDER YOU

96
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,875
TO HELP THE CITIZENS
REBUILD THE ROYAL CITY.

97
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,083
- ( gasps )

98
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:20,250
- BYRO, SUGARBOY, HUGHES,

99
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:24,166
YOU ARE ALL GIVEN THE SAME 
PUNISHMENT AS KNIGHTWALKER.

100
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,458
- ( all gasp )

101
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,083
- CARE TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF?

102
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,458
- YEAH, THIS IS,
LIKE, AWESOME,

103
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,250
BUT IT'S ALSO
TOTALLY MESSED UP.

104
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,250
- HMM.

105
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,000
SO THE MAGIC WARFARE UNITS
DON'T GET THE FULL BRUNT? 

106
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:38,166
- I'M AFRAID I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE HOPING TO ACHIEVE.

107
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,583
- YOUR ATONEMENT,
NOTHING MORE.

108
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,958
- WELL, THEN YOU SHOULD
SIMPLY EXECUTE US.

109
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,166
WE DON'T WANT TO LIVE 
OUR LIVES IN DISGRACE.

110
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,583
- SERIOUSLY, IT'S NOT
A BIG DEAL.  JUST DO IT.

111
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,250
- IN FACT, WE WERE PREPARED
FOR THAT PUNISHMENT.

112
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,166
- OH, NEW KING,
THIS IS OUR DESIRE.

113
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,250
WON'T YOU PLEASE
SYMPATHIZE WITH OUR FEELINGS

114
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,958
AND GRANT US
THIS ONE LAST WISH?

115
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,625
- VERY WELL.

116
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,416
- IF THEY'RE GONNA
GIVE THEIR LIVES TO ATONE,

117
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,750
THEN I WANT TO DO IT TOO.

118
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,708
- COCO, NO.

119
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:08,083
I CANNOT ALLOW THAT AFTER
YOU REFORMED OF YOUR OWN ACCORD.

120
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,708
THAT WAS TRULY NOBLE OF YOU.

121
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:14,333
DON'T LET YOUR PAST OVERSHADOW
SUCH AN ACCOMPLISHMENT.

122
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,458
- I WON'T.

123
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,958
- I KNOW THAT EVEN
WITHOUT MAGIC POWER,

124
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:22,625
EACH OF YOU POSSESSES
AMAZING INNATE ABILITIES,

125
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,291
NOT TO MENTION WISDOM
AND EXPERIENCE.

126
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:29,000
WE NEED YOUR HELP
TO REBUILD THE ROYAL CITY.

127
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:32,541
HOWEVER, IF YOU INSIST
THAT YOU CANNOT BEAR IT,

128
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:36,166
I WILL GRANT YOU THE ULTIMATE
PUNISHMENT YOU DESIRE.

129
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,500
- THE SAME SHOULD GO
FOR HIS HIGHNESS.

130
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,333
EXCUSE ME.

131
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:43,041
THE SAME SHOULD GO
FOR SIR, FAUST.

132
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,500
I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY
FAIR SOLUTION, DON'T YOU?

133
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,250
- SHE'S GOT
A PRETTY GOOD POINT.

134
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,291
- MY PUNISHMENT IS FAIR.
- HMM?!

135
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,041
- BUT, SIR!

136
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,541
- TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES.

137
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:57,125
I AM GRATEFUL TO YOU,
THE NEW KING,

138
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,000
FOR SHOWING SUCH MERCY.

139
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:03,291
BEFORE HE LEFT OUR WORLD,

140
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,333
I CALLED OUT
TO THAT YOUNG MAN.

141
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,458
- YES, I'M AWARE OF THAT.

142
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,000
- SOLIDARITY...

143
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,708
- HUH?

144
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:22,041
- CONVICTION, AND COURAGE.

145
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:25,708
IT WOULD APPEAR I'VE FORGOTTEN
WHAT IS TRULY IMPORTANT IN LIFE.

146
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:31,958
BEING IN A GUILD,
DO YOU ENJOY IT? 

147
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,458
- YEAH!

148
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:39,458
- Faust: I UNDERSTAND WHY.

149
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:42,333
IT'S SOMETHING
I WILL NEVER FORGET--

150
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,125
THE WAY HE SMILED WHEN
I ASKED HIM THAT QUESTION.

151
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,416
IT STIRRED
SOMETHING WITHIN ME.

152
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,666
I SUPPOSE THIS IS GOOD-BYE.

153
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:56,500
COCO, DON'T EVER
STOP RUNNING, CHILD.

154
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,750
- ( gasps )

155
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,458
I WON'T!

156
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,041
( cries )

157
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,416
- ( classical music plays )
- ( sighs )

158
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,083
MAN, THIS IS THE LIFE,
AIN'T IT?

159
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,750
- THIS TEA IS DELICIOUS.

160
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,833
- ABOUT TIME
WE GOT TO RELAX.

161
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,291
- Men: ARE YOU HAVING 
A TEA PARTY IN THERE?!

162
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,458
COME OUT HERE
AND HELP US!

163
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,791
- ( chirps )

164
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,541
- GOOD JOB, GUYS!

165
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,916
- ( groans ) - WE MADE
IT TO OUR DESTINATION!

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,958
- Men: YEAH,
NO THANKS TO YOU.

167
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,625
- WHAT IN THE WORLD?
- IT SEEMS THEY DRAGGED

168
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,125
THAT BUILDING
ALL THE WAY HERE.

169
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,000
- I'VE SEEN THAT SYMBOL
BEFORE SOMEWHERE.

170
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,208
- PEOPLE OF THE ROYAL CITY...
- Juvia: HI.

171
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,166
- Juvia and Wendy: WE'RE MEMBERS
OF THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD.

172
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,500
- WE CAN SOLVE ANY PROBLEMS
THAT YOU MAY HAVE.

173
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,458
- AND NOBODY CAN
BEAT OUR PRICES.

174
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,458
- WE'RE RUNNING A SPECIAL
FOR OUR GRAND OPENING

175
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,750
SO ACT NOW.
- STOP ON BY!

176
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,750
- WOW, THAT'S GREAT! 
- MY ROOF WAS DAMAGED

177
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,208
DURING THE MESS
WITH THE DARK LORD.

178
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,000
- WE'RE GONNA NEED
MORE BRICK LAYERS 

179
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,083
IF WE'RE GONNA REBUILD THE CITY.
WOULD YOU LEND US A HAND?

180
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,416
- WE'D LOVE TO.

181
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,041
- I DON'T THE FIRST THING
ABOUT FIXING ROOFS.

182
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,458
- ME NEITHER, OR LAYING BRICKS.
- OH, MAN.

183
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,958
- WELL, LET'S GO.

184
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,500
- Male Fairy Members:
HOW CAN YOU BE SO CRUEL?!

185
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,125
- Narrator: MEANWHILE,
BACK IN EARTH LAND,

186
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,750
FAIRY TALE IS
IN FOR A SURPRISE.

187
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,541
- ( gasping )

188
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,875
- Narrator: AND ELSEWHERE...

189
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,791
- ( chatter )

190
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,541
- BUT I THOUGHT
WE'D LOST YOU. 

191
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,166
- SO YOU WERE ALIVE
ALL ALONG?

192
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,250
- ( overlapping chatter )
- HM-HMM.

193
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,416
- ( stampeding feet )
- ( gasps )

194
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,166
- LISANNA!

195
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,500
- KEEP YOUR FILTHY PAWS
OFF OF HER.

196
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,916
- I THINK THEY'RE JUST
HAPPY TO SEE HER, MAN.

197
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,833
- YEAH, CHILL OUT.
- OH, MY GOODNESS.

198
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,500
- IT'S SUCH A RELIEF
TO SEE THE GUILD

199
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,958
BACK TO HOW IT WAS BEFORE.
- YEAH, NO JOKE.

200
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,666
IT SEEMS LIKE THEY
DON'T HAVE A CLUE 

201
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,500
ABOUT THE ANIMA STUFF.
- I'M JUST GLAD

202
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:46,875
TO SEE THEY'RE SAFE
AND SOUND.

203
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,708
- PRETTY CRAZY, AIN'T IT?

204
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,791
- SO THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE IN A GUILD.

205
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,416
- LISANNA.

206
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,625
- MASTER.

207
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,708
- I WAS SO WORRIED.

208
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,458
I CONSIDER THOSE WHO'VE BEEN
RAISED BY THIS GUILD

209
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,375
MY OWN CHILDREN.

210
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:10,583
- ( gasps ) - EVERY PARENT
WORRIES ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN.

211
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:14,875
AND EVERY PARENT HAS FAITH
IN THEIR CHILDREN.

212
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,000
YOU CAN FILL ME IN
ON ALL THE DETAILS ANOTHER TIME.

213
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:21,833
SAME FOR THE REST OF YOU.
- OKAY, SURE THING, GRAMPS.

214
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:25,875
- TODAY, WE'LL ALL CELEBRATE
YOUR RETURN TO FAIRY TAIL!

215
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,625
- OH, THANK YOU.

216
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,666
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

217
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,250
I'VE COME HOME.

218
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,291
AND I'LL NEVER LEAVE AGAIN.

219
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,000
- YOU CAN, CHILD.

220
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,750
FOR NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO,
THIS WILL ALWAYS BE HOME.

221
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:41,708
WELCOME BACK, LISANNA DEAR.

222
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:44,000
- All: WELCOME BACK, LISANNA!

223
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,208
( scattered laughing,
cheering )

224
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,291
- ( cries )

225
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,875
THANK YOU, MASTER!
- ( whimpers )

226
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,333
SHE TACKLED HIM.

227
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,041
- BE CAREFUL.
THE MASTER'S FRAGILE.

228
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:57,791
- ( cries )
- WELL, GET IT OUT, CHILD,

229
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,666
BEFORE THE PARTY BEGINS.

230
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,500
- All: CHEERS!

231
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,958
- OKAY, WHO'S READY
FOR ANOTHER ROUND? 

232
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,625
- OVER HERE, KINANA.
- I COULD USE ANOTHER ONE TOO.

233
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,458
- TAKE A BREAK AND
COME PARTY WITH US.

234
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,208
- I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH
EVERYBODY'S CHANGED.

235
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,625
- ALTHOUGH, I'D SAY
YOU'VE CHANGED THE MOST, MIRA.

236
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,416
- WHO ME?

237
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,166
- BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER

238
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,791
'CAUSE IT'S STILL
THE SAME FAIRY TAIL

239
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,625
I REMEMBER.
- Fried: LISANNA.

240
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,333
- THIS IS A ROCKING DAY, BABIES.
- Tommens: OH YEAH!

241
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,916
- I'M GLAD YOU MADE IT HOME
IN ONE PIECE.

242
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,541
- YES, WELCOME BACK, LISANNA.

243
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,083
- THE THUNDER LEGION!

244
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,083
I NEVER EXPECTED
TO SEE YOU HERE.

245
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,666
- WELL, I CAN UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'D BE SURPRISED, 

246
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,791
BUT CONSIDER
THE GUILD'S NAME.

247
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,041
RIGHT? "FAIRY."
I'M THE MOST FAIRY-LIKE.

248
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,833
- IS IT JUST ME OR
IS HER HAIR DIFFERENT?

249
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,250
- GLOOMY.
- WHOA!

250
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,666
JUVIA'S IS TOO.
- IS THAT RAIN?

251
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,041
- GLOOMY. - I WONDER
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO HER?

252
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,375
- SHE CERTAINLY DOESN'T
SEEM VERY HAPPY.

253
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,375
- GLOOMY.

254
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,041
- THINGS ARE DIFFERENT
IN EDOLAS.

255
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,291
CAN YOU BELIEVE
GRAY'S THE ONE IN LOVE WITH YOU?

256
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,000
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?!

257
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,333
 - MAYBE IT'S YOUR HAIRSTYLE.

258
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,041
- YOU SHOULD SEE
THE OTHER-WORLD YOU.

259
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,750
( chuckles ) JUST THE THOUGHT
THAT MAKES ME CRACK UP.

260
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,333
- COME ON, WOULD YOU JUST
SPILL IT ALREADY?

261
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:09,708
I'D LIKE TO GET BACK
TO DRINKING.

262
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,208
- ( laughing )

263
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,833
- Juvia: I WANT TO GO
TO THIS EDOLAS PLACE.

264
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,541
- OKAY, I GET IT NOW.

265
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,666
- I'D LIKE TO SEE IT.
- YEAH, ME TOO.

266
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,458
- I LOVE BEING IN A GUILD!
DON'T YOU, HAPPY?!

267
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,666
- AYE, AYE, SIR!

268
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,458
- HEY, PIPE DOWN.

269
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,541
- YEAH, QUIT BUSTING UP
THE PLACE.

270
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,458
- I WONDER IF THE OTHER NATSU
IS AS CRAZY AS OURS IS.

271
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,375
- IF SO, I FEEL REALLY BAD
FOR HIS GUILD.

272
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,958
- ACTUALLY,
HE'S MORE LIKE THIS.

273
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,875
- WHY YOU
SO MEAN TO ME, LUCY?

274
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,291
WHAT'D I DO TO YOU?

275
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,041
- ( laughing )
- HE'S A WIMP.

276
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,958
- WOW, NO WAY.
- WHAT I WOULDN'T GIVE

277
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:45,250
TO MEET NATSU THE CRYBABY!
- MY TUMMY HURTS FROM LAUGHING!

278
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,541
- THAT'S HILARIOUS!
- QUIT LAUGHING

279
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,916
AT THE OTHER ME
RIGHT NOW!

280
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,958
- SORRY, BUT
I THINK IT'S CUTE.

281
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,625
- YO, HAPPY, I HEAR
YOU WERE KICKING BUTT

282
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,416
OVER IN EDOLAS.
- AYE.

283
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,583
NOT TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT,
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE

284
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,375
THERE'S A DRAGON SLAYER
WHO'S SO EXCITED

285
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:00,791
HE'S GONE ON A RAMPAGE.

286
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,583
WOULD YOU MIND KNOCKING
SOME SENSE INTO HIM?

287
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,833
- YEAH, SURE, BUT LET'S
WAIT TILL THE PARTY'S OVER.

288
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,041
- I GUESS THAT'S WHAT 
YOU'D CALL TOUGH LOVE?

289
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,875
- SCREW WAITING
TILL IT'S OVER, GILDARTS!

290
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,041
WHY DON'T
YOU FIGHT ME NOW--

291
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,000
( groans )

292
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,750
- GEEZ, THEY CERTAINLY
ARE A ROWDY BUNCH, AREN'T THEY?

293
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,625
- I THINK THAT'S MOST
PEOPLE'S FIRST IMPRESSION

294
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,083
OF FAIRY TAIL.
- THERE'S NEVER A DULL MOMENT.

295
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:22,375
- SO EVERYONE HERE POSSESSES
A MAGIC POWER OF SOME SORT? 

296
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,416
( gulps )

297
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,291
- THAT'S CORRECT.
THE SAME HOLDS TRUE

298
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,791
FOR ALL EARTH LAND WIZARDS.

299
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,750
- ERZA.
- I ALMOST FORGOT

300
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,291
THAT YOU WORKED WITH
THE LESS THAN PLEASANT

301
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,250
ERZA KNIGHTWALKER
BACK IN EDOLAS.

302
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,791
- YOU'RE GONNA LIKE OURS BETTER.

303
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,708
- HOWEVER, I DON'T THINK
THE MAGIC ITSELF

304
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,291
IS WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT.

305
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,500
I BELIEVE IT IS THE HEARTS
OF THOSE WHO WIELD IT.

306
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,541
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE, LILY?

307
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,583
- HMPH, YOU MAY BE 
A DIFFERENT PERSON,

308
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,208
BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT

309
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,291
I FIND IT COMFORTING
TO HAVE A FAMILIAR FACE AROUND.

310
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:54,250
- I'VE GOT A WAGER FOR YOU
AND THE LITTLE GIRL, SALAMANDER!

311
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,416
I BETCHA MY LILY
CAN BEAT THE EVER-LOVING CRAP

312
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,000
OUT OF YOUR PUNY CATS!
- YEAH?

313
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,208
- ( laughs )

314
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,833
- YOUR KITTY UP
TO THE CHALLENGE?

315
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,666
- LOOKS LIKE THE BIG GUY'S
GOT HIS HEART SET

316
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,791
ON HAVING THEM FIGHT.
- UH-HUH.

317
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,416
- DON'T WORRY.
SHE CAN HANDLE HIM.  I THINK.

318
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,125
- GO AHEAD AND
MAKE MY DAY, YOU PUNK.

319
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,541
- I WILL.
- DO WE HAVE ANY SAY?

320
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,583
- AIN'T NO WAY YOU GUYS
CAN BEAT MY LILY.

321
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,541
HE'S THE STRONGEST 
WITH A CAPITAL "S."

322
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,208
- WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT
BECAUSE HAPPY'S A CAT 

323
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,541
WITH A LOWER CASE "C."
- UH, NATSU,

324
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,333
YOU KNOW I DON'T STAND
A CHANCE AGAINST HIM. 

325
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,291
- NOW, DON'T SELL
YOURSELF SHORT, HAPPY,

326
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,250
YOU CAN'T GIVE UP
WHEN YOU HAVEN'T EVEN TRIED.

327
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,583
- ( gasps )
YOU MEAN IT?

328
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,333
YOU REALLY THINK
I GOT A SHOT?

329
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:31,833
- NOW HOLD ON.

330
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,208
DESPITE MY CURRENT APPEARANCE,

331
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,375
I WAS A DIVISION COMMANDER
BACK IN EDOLAS.

332
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,625
IF WE WERE TO FIGHT,
YOU COULD BE SERIOUSLY INJURED.

333
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,041
- YOU'VE GOT A GOOD POINT.

334
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,458
- I MUST SAY THAT
WAS QUITE MATURE OF YOU.

335
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,500
- IT JUST SEEMS THAT WAY 
BECAUSE THEY'RE CHILDISH.

336
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,166
WELL, I FOR ONE HOPE
THAT THE THREE OF US

337
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,458
CAN BE FRIENDS FROM NOW ON.
- AYE, SIR.

338
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,416
- FINE.
- ( sighs )

339
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,583
- WOULD SOMEONE CARE TO EXPLAIN
WHY ALL THE BOYS ARE FIGHTING?

340
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,583
- EVIDENTLY, GRAY AND ELFMAN
GOT DRAGGED INTO IT TOO.

341
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:59,166
- FLESH STRIKING FLESH
REPEATEDLY WITH FORCE.

342
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,541
- I'LL JOIN YOU!
- NO, DON'T STRIP.

343
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,250
- I SUPPOSE THAT
I SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE

344
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,791
OF THE CHANCE TO LET LOOSE.

345
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,916
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

346
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,750
- IF YOU GUYS ARE GOING IN,
THEN I AM TOO.

347
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,583
- THEY NEED TO CALM DOWN.
THIS IS GETTING OUT OF HAND.

348
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,583
- WELL, GET USED TO IT
BECAUSE IT HAPPENS A LOT.

349
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,708
- IT'S PART OF WHAT MAKES
FAIRY TAIL SO MUCH FUN.

350
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,666
- ( giggles )

351
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,875
- Makarov: LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING, NATSU.

352
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,583
WHAT WAS I LIKE IN THIS 
OTHER WORLD YOU VISITED?

353
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,666
- YOU MEAN,
THE EDOLAS VERSION OF YOU?

354
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,708
- Makarov:
YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT HIM.

355
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,541
WAS HE THE OPPOSITE OF ME?

356
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,166
- Natsu: WELL, NOW THAT
I THINK ABOUT IT--

357
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,333
NO WAY.

358
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,416
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THERE WAS
SOMETHING ABOUT THE OLD GUY

359
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,875
THAT SEEMED
KIND OF FAMILIAR.

360
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:48,291
HA! THAT'S IT!
- WHAT'S WHAT?

361
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:53,166
- Both: BEING IN A GUILD,
DO YOU ENJOY IT?

362
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,208
- I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE,

363
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,375
BUT I THINK YOU MIGHT
HAVE BEEN THE KING.

364
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,916
- OH, YEAH?

365
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,916
HMM.

366
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,916
- HEY, SO WHAT WAS I LIKE
OVER THERE?

367
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,708
WAS I A DASHING PRINCE
OR A GREAT SOLDIER?

368
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,166
- ACTUALLY,

369
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,125
I DON'T REMEMBER
SEEING ANYBODY THERE

370
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,291
WHO LOOKED LIKE YOU.
I GUESS IT'S POSSIBLE

371
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,250
YOU WERE A FROG OR
FISH OR SOMETHING.

372
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,083
- NOT FUNNY, NATSU!
- ( laughs )

373
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,166
- AREN'T YOU THE ONE
THAT STARTED THIS, PYRO?

374
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,041
- BETTER HURRY AND
GET OVER HERE OR ELSE!

375
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,750
- YEAH, COME FIGHT US
LIKE A REAL MAN!

376
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,458
- ONLY A COWARD
WOULD TURN THEIR BACK

377
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,000
ON A FIGHT THEY INITIATED.

378
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,166
WE'RE FINALLY SEEING

379
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,333
THE SALAMANDER'S TRUE COLOR--

380
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:27,458
- SHUT UP, LOSER!

381
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,291
- YUP, SAW THAT COMING.

382
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,625
( chuckles )

383
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,291
GILDARTS, TELL ME SOMETHING.
- HMM?

384
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:37,000
- DO YOU THINK MYSTOGAN'S
GONNA BE OKAY OVER IN EDOLAS?

385
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,750
I DON'T WANT TO SOUND
LIKE AN OLD FOOL,

386
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,875
BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT WORRY
ABOUT MY CHILDREN.

387
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,875
- I'M SURE HE'LL BE FINE.

388
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:48,166
AFTER ALL, HE GREW UP
IN THIS GUILD.

389
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,291
HE'LL ALWAYS BE ONE OF US.

390
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,541
- HMM.

391
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,333
( chuckles )

392
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:02,125
SO HOW LONG YOU PLANNING
TO STAY IN TOWN THIS TIME?

393
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,333
- Gildarts: WELL,
I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.

394
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:08,000
- Makarov: THERE'S SOMETHING 
I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS WITH YOU.

395
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,625
- Gildarts: YEAH, WHAT IS IT?
WHY SO FORMAL?

396
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,958
- Narrator:
THIS BIZARRE BUILDING

397
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,541
SERVES AS THE HEADQUARTERS

398
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,875
OF THE NEWLY REFORMED
MAGIC COUNCIL.

399
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,333
- THIS IS DISGRACEFUL.

400
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:30,166
I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MANY
INCIDENT REPORTS.

401
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,541
- Council Member #1:
IT IS ALARMING

402
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:32,916
ESPECIALLY SINCE
THEY'RE THE RESULT

403
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,708
OF A SINGLE GUILD'S
INDISCRETIONS .

404
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,625
- Council Member #2:
FAIRY TAIL.

405
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,375
THEY CAUSED
PLENTY OF HEADACHES

406
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,833
FOR OUR PREDECESSORS.

407
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,375
- WHILE THEY CAN
BE TROUBLESOME, 

408
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,125
THEY'RE NOT DESERVING
OF SUCH CRITICISM.

409
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:46,333
AFTER ALL, WE OWE THEM FOR
WIPING OUT THE ORACION SEIS

410
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,375
AND THE BARAM ALLIANCE.
- WE OWE THEM?!

411
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,500
THAT'S THE MOST RIDICULOUS THING
I'VE EVER HEARD, MASTER ORG.

412
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,541
- I'M AFRAID THAT 
THERE IS NO RECORD

413
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,000
OF THE MAGIC COUNCIL EVER
APPROVING THEIR OPERATION.

414
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,333
- AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL,
IT WAS SIMPLY A BAND

415
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,125
OF LOCAL GUILDS ACTING
OF THEIR OWN ACCORD.

416
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,791
- AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE,

417
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,791
EVEN THOUGH THEY DECLARED WAR
AGAINST A DARK GUILD,

418
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,416
THEIR ACTIONS PUT THEM
IN VIOLATION

419
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,583
OF THE INTER-GUILD
CONFLICT-BAN TREATY.

420
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,958
- I WORRY THAT THIS INCIDENT
COULD MOTIVATE

421
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:13,166
THE BARAM ALLIANCE TO RETALIATE
AGAINST THE OFFICIAL GUILDS.

422
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,125
- I DON'T THINK THERE
IS CAUSE FOR CONCERN.

423
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,916
THE LIGHT TEAM CALLED THEMSELVES
AN ALLIANCE AS WELL.

424
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,916
BUT THEY WERE JUST PART
OF A NON-AGGRESSION TREATY.

425
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,458
- HMM.

426
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:22,833
- Council Member #3:
CONCERNING JELLAL

427
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,791
WHO WAS CAPTURED
IN THE WORTH WOODSEA?

428
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,875
- WE'VE RECEIVED REPORTS
THAT THERE ARE MEMBERS

429
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,000
OF THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD
WHO'VE GONE SO FAR

430
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,833
AS TO REFER TO HIM
AS ONE OF THEIR OWN.

431
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,958
- IF THAT'S TRUE,
ARE WE SURE THEY CAN BE TRUSTED?

432
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:36,125
- CAN'T YOU SEE? THIS IS OUR
CHANCE TO ASSERT OURSELVES!

433
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,000
LET'S SHOW THE OTHER GUILDS
WE WON'T PUT UP

434
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,375
WITH THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR.

435
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,583
- CHAIRMAN, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

436
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,708
- IF WE ARE TO REGAIN THE TRUST
THE OLD COUNCIL SQUANDERED,

437
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,500
THEN WE MUST CRACK DOWN
ON THE PROBLEMATIC GUILDS.

438
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:52,958
FAIRY TAIL WON'T
GET ANOTHER CHANCE.

439
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:56,416
ONE MORE INCIDENT
AND THEY'RE DISBANDED.

440
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,333
- Narrator:
THIS MAN IS CHAIRMAN

441
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,083
OF THE NEW MAGIC COUNCIL.

442
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,500
HIS NAME IS GRAN DOMA.

443
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,500
- HMM.

444
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,416
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, ORG?

445
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,458
ARE YOU DISSATISFIED?

446
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,916
- NO, SIR.

447
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,208
- I'M AMAZED
BY YOUR NAIVETE.

448
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,291
TO THINK YOU WERE THOROUGHLY
FOOLED BY A PROJECTION.

449
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:20,000
DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW
INCREDIBLY RECKLESS IT WAS

450
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,000
TO ALLOW THE R-SYSTEM
TO BE ACTIVATED?

451
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,333
- I DO, SIR.

452
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:26,958
- SUMMON THEM.
- Org: YES, CHAIRMAN.

453
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:30,833
LAHAR AND DORANBOLT,
COME TO THE COUNCIL AT ONCE!

454
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:37,666
- WE UPHOLD THE SANCTITY
OF ORDER IN THE MAGIC WORLD!

455
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,708
- Council members:
FOR THE SANCTITY OF ORDER.

456
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:43,708
FOR THE SANCTITY OF ORDER.

457
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,625
- WHOA.

458
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,958
LOOKS LIKE EVERYONE
DID SOME SERIOUS PARTYING.

459
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,375
- ( snoring )

460

- Lucy: I BET NATSU WISHES

464
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,000
HE COULD BE REUNITED
WITH IGNEEL.

465
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:13,416
SOMETIMES I WONDER
IF HE EVER FEELS SAD OR LONELY.

466
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,375
- ( giggles )

467

WHEN HE'S SLEEPING.

468
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,208
- FIRE.
- HMM?

FIRE-- FIRE.

- ( giggles )

473
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,250
TOLD YOU NOT TO
BACK TALK TO ME, GRAY.

474
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,291
- WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED?

475
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,000
- ( growling )

476
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:55,125
- PLEASE, YOU MUSTN'T
COME NEAR ME.

477
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,291
NO, STAY BACK.

478

- I TRIED TO WARN YOU.

481
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:19,250
I TOLD YOU TO STAY AWAY.

482
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:22,250
I'M SORRY.

483
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:28,791
I DON'T MEAN TO TAKE
THE LIVES OF OTHERS.

484
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:33,583
IT'S AS THOUGH
THE WORLD IS REJECTING ME.

485
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:36,291
- NATSU.

486
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,708
I HOPE THAT
I WILL SEE YOU SOON.

HAVE YOU SEEN MY SCARF?

- Happy: YEAH,
IT'S ON THE BED.

491
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,708
- WHAT ABOUT MY SHIRT?
- IT'S DRYING OUTSIDE.

492
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,916
- AND MY UNDERWEAR?
- YOU'RE WEARING 'EM.

493
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,375
- ( laughs )
WHAT WOULD I DO WITHOUT YOU?

494
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,250
YOU'RE THE BEST, HAPPY.
- YEAH, YEAH.

495
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,833
WOULD YOU JUST HURRY
AND GET DRESSED ALREADY?

496
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,375
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE
FOR OUR JOB!

497

LITTLE BUDDY?

THERE'S NO OTHER WAY
TO DESCRIBE US.

500
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,833
AIN'T THAT RIGHT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

501
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:38,375
I USUALLY FEEL
MORE LIKE YOUR NANNY

502
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:39,708
THAN I DO YOUR PARTNER.
