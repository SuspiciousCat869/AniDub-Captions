1
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:20,708
- Narrator: IN A LAND
FAR, FAR AWAY

2
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:23,041
LIES THE KINGDOM
OF FIORE,

3
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:26,208
A SMALL, PEACEFUL NATION
OF 17 MILLION,

4
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,791
AND A PLACE FILLED
WITH MAGIC.

5
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,291
FOUND IN EVERY HOME,

6
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,041
BOUGHT AND SOLD
IN EVERY MARKETPLACE.

7
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,375
FOR MOST MAGIC IS
MERELY A TOOL,

8
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,958
A MUNDANE PART
OF EVERYDAY LIFE.

9
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,333
FOR SOME, HOWEVER,
MAGIC IS AN ART,

10
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:42,416
AND THEY'VE DEVOTED
THEIR LIVES TO ITS PRACTICE.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,666
THESE ARE THE WIZARDS.

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,833
BANDED TOGETHER INTO
MAGICAL GUILDS,

13
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:50,416
THEY PLY THEIR SKILLS
IN SEARCH OF FAME AND FORTUNE.

14
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,375
MANY SUCH GUILDS DOT
THE LANDSCAPE OF FIORE.

15
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:57,416
BUT THERE IS A CERTAIN GUILD
IN A CERTAIN TOWN

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,750
THAT SOARS HIGH
ABOVE THE REST.

17
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,583
ONE FROM WHICH COUNTLESS LEGENDS
HAVE BEEN BORN.

18
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:05,750
A GUILD THAT WOULD NO DOUBT
CONTINUE TO CREATE LEGENDS

19
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,416
WELL INTO THE FUTURE.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,375
ITS NAME IS FAIRY TAIL.

21
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,958
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

22
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,083
- Natsu:
PREVIOUSLY ON "FAIRY TAIL."

23
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,500
- THE REWARD HAS BEEN
RAISED TO TWO MILLION JEWEL.

24
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,583
- FLYING VIRGO ATTACK!

25
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,125
- ( screams )

26
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,833
- SO YOU WANT TO PILFER
"DAYBREAK."

27
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,375
- Lucy: I KNEW THIS BOOK 
HELD SOME SORT OF SECRET.

28
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,375
- NOW I'VE GOT SOME
FIRE IN MY BELLY.

29
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:00,500
- Both: NO!

30
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,875
( both groan )

31
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,875
- WH-- WERE WE BEATEN

32
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:09,958
BY A FIRE WIZARD?

33
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,541
- HEY, BRO,

34
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,625
TELL ME WHEN THE ROOM
STOPS SPINNING, 'KAY?

35
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,375
- THAT'LL TEACH YOU.
NOW THEN,

36
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,375
GUESS I'D BETTER 
GO AND FIND LUCY.

37
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,375
THESE MERCHANT FAIRIES
ARE TOAST.

38
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,791
- Vanish Brothers:
WE'RE MERCENARIES.

39
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,541
- ENEMY OF LITERATURE?

40
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,583
MY MASSIVE COLLECTION
OF BOOKS AND ART

41
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:28,000
ONLY PROVE I'M CULTURE'S
GREATEST FRIEND!

42
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,916
- BUT THAT UGLY MAID COLLECTION
PROVES YOU DON'T KNOW SQUAT

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
ABOUT BEAUTY.
- HOW DARE YOU MOCK THEM.

44
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,541
THEY ARE THE VERY
DEFINITION OF BEAUTY.

45
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,333
WHAT SECRET DOES IT HOLD?

46
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,250
LET ME GUESS,
HE BURIED HIS FORTUNE

47
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,375
AND THERE'S A TREASURE MAP
HIDDEN INSIDE.

48
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,000
- ( grunts )
- TELL ME,

49
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,916
OR I'LL SNAP YOUR ARM
LIKE A TOOTHPICK.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,416
- ( grunts, blows raspberry )

51
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,250
- BOYO.

52
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:52,083
NOW IS NOT THE TIME
TO GET SASSY.

53
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:55,416
LISTEN, I MYSELF COMMISSIONED
THIS BOOK'S VERY CREATION.

54
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,583
THEREFORE,
ANY SECRET IT HOLDS

55
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,416
IS RIGHTFULLY MY PROPERTY!

56
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,791
- ( gasps )

57
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,291
- ( grunts )

58
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,250
- HAPPY!
- ( giggles )

59
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:07,250
- THAT WAS SO COOL.
HUH?

60
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,125
- WHAT'S THIS? A
FLYING CAT? - ( burbles )

61
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,708
THE NAME'S HAPPY.


62
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,791
- I WOULDN'T STAY IN THERE
IF I WAS YOU.

63
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,625
- BUT THE WATER
FEELS SO GOOD. 


64
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,500
- THAT'S SEWER WATER,
HAPPY.

65
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,291
LOOKS LIKE THE TABLES
HAVE TURNED.

66
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,791
BUT IF YOU LET ME
KEEP THE BOOK,

67
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,458
I'LL THINK ABOUT
GOING EASY ON YOU.

68
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,625
ALTHOUGH I'M TEMPTED
TO GIVE YOU A GOOD SMACK.

69
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,458
- OH. A CELESTIAL WIZARD.

70
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,041
BUT FOR A READER,
YOU SEEM TO BE A BIT DEFICIENT

71
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,708
IN YOUR TURNS OF PHRASE.

72
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,625
"THE TABLES HAVE TURNED"
IMPLIES THAT THE WEAKER PARTY

73
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,208
HAS RALLIED TO CLAIM VICTORY.

74
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,291
BUT THERE'S NO WAY
YOU AND THAT CAT

75
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,958
COULD EVER DEFEAT ME
AND MY DIVER MAGIC. 

76
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,833
BOYOYOYOYO!

77
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,666
- SO HE DOES THAT
USING MAGIC?

78
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,083
I HAD NO IDEA EVERLUE
WAS A WIZARD TOO.

79
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,083
- DO YOU NOT SMELL YOURSELF?

80
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,041
- ( grunts )

81
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,333
- ( grunts )
- BOYO!

82
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:59,000
- LOOK, I KNOW
THE WHOLE STORY NOW.

83
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,750
IT'S A HORRIBLE ADVENTURE NOVEL
ABOUT A TRASHY LITTLE CHARACTER

84
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,083
NAMED DUKE EVERLUE.
- YOU SERIOUS?

85
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,833
- I DON'T KNOW THAT I'D CALL
THE PROTAGONIST "TRASHY."

86
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,500
BUT YES.
THE STORY ITSELF IS CRAP.

87
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:12,625
AND TO THINK IT WAS WRITTEN
BY THE GREAT KEMU ZALEON.

88
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,541
- ( gasps )
- INEXCUSABLE!

89
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,666
( chuckles )

90
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,583
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOUR ARROGANCE.

91
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,583
YOU FORCED HIM TO WRITE IT.
- ARROGANT, <i>MOI?</i>

92
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,500
THE WORD DOESN'T
BEGIN TO APPLY. 

93
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,583
TO TELL MY STORY'S AN HONOR,

94
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,625
NO MATTER WHAT
THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

95
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,583
- THEN WHY'D YOU HAVE TO
BLACKMAIL HIM INTO IT?

96
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,000
- BLACKMAIL?

97
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,458
- WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
- ( gasps )

98
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:35,958
- HE JUST NEEDED SOME
EXTRA ENCOURAGEMENT

99
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,750
TO TAKE THE JOB.
- OH REALLY?

100
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,791
- ANY FOOL WOULD HAVE
JUMPED AT THE CHANCE 

101
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,458
TO HAVE ME AS THEIR MUSE.

102
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,708
BUT HE HAD THE AUDACITY
TO SAY NO.

103
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,125
SO I GAVE HIM
THE ADDED INSPIRATION

104
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,625
IN THE FORM OF
AN ULTIMATUM. 

105
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,291
WRITE THE NOVEL,
OR HIS FAMILY WOULD BE

106
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,041
STRIPPED OF THEIR CITIZENSHIP.

107
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,958
- BUT THEN NONE OF THEM
WOULD BE ABLE TO

108
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,041
JOIN ANY OF THE GUILDS
AND MAKE A LIVING.

109
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,541
DO YOU REALLY HAVE
THE POWER TO DO THAT?

110
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,958
- I HAVE THE POWER
TO DO ANYTHING.

111
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,833
I GOT HIM TO WRITE IT,
DIDN'T I?

112
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,416
- ( breathes heavily )

113
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,208
- BUT I DIDN'T LIKE
HIS ATTITUDE,

114
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:10,125
SO I DECIDED HE'D DO BEST
WRITING FROM A PRISON CELL.

115
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,750
BOYOYO!

116
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,916
HE WENT ON AND ON ABOUT
BEING A BRILLIANT NOVELIST

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,750
WHO WOULD NEVER
GIVE INTO THREATS,

118
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,166
BUT IN THE END
I GOT WHAT I WANTED!

119
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,500
- ( whimpers ) - I CAN'T
BELIEVE YOU'D GO THAT FAR

120
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,166
JUST TO BOOST YOUR OWN
STUPID EGO.

121
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,750
HE WAS IN SOLITARY
CONFINEMENT FOR THREE YEARS.

122
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,833
DON'T YOU KNOW HOW HARD
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN?

123
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,041
- THREE WHOLE YEARS?

124
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,750
- ( Lucy and Happy gasp )

125
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:33,500
- PERHAPS IT TOOK HIM
THAT LONG TO APPRECIATE ME.

126
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,416
BOYOYOYO.
- YOU'RE WRONG.

127
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,833
MORE LIKE HE COULDN'T BEAR
TO SPREAD YOUR LIES.

128
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,166
BUT HE HAD TO
SATISFY YOUR VANITY.

129
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,000
HE KNEW THAT IF
HE DIDN'T WRITE YOUR CHARACTER

130
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,750
AS A HEROIC
CHAMPION OF JUSTICE,

131
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,583
THEN HIS FAMILY
WOULD SUFFER.

132
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:49,250
- TELL ME, HOW EXACTLY
DO YOU KNOW ALL THIS? 

133
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,916
- IT'S ALL RIGHT HERE
IN BLACK AND WHITE.

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,875
- WHAT?  I'VE READ THAT BOOK
FROM COVER TO COVER,

135
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,958
AND KEMU ZALEON
ISN'T IN IT.

136
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,833
- WELL, YEAH,
IF YOU READ IT NORMALLY

137
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,583
THERE'S NO MENTION OF HIM.

138
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,791
BUT I KNOW SOMETHING
YOU DON'T KNOW.

139
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,583
LONG BEFORE HE WAS AN AUTHOR,
HE WAS A WIZARD.

140
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,208
- Happy: HE WAS?
- Everlue: WHAT DID HE DO?

141
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,958
- Lucy:
AFTER HE FINISHED THE BOOK,

142
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,791
HE GATHERED ALL HIS
REMAINING STRENGTH 

143
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,625
AND CAST A SPELL ON IT.

144
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,625
- ( groans )
WHAT A DIRTY TRICK.

145
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,625
HE TURNED A BOOK ABOUT
A GREAT MAN LIKE ME

146
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:18,958
INTO A HATCHET JOB?

147
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,333
THE NERVE OF THAT FOOL!

148
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,750
BOYO!
- OH, GET OVER YOURSELF!

149
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,208
- IT'S TRUE THAT HE WROTE
ABOUT ALL THE PAIN AND TORTURE

150
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,208
THAT YOU PUT HIM THROUGH.

151
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,625
BUT THE CHAPTERS THAT FOCUS
ON WHAT YOU DID TO HIM

152
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,500
ARE ONLY A SMALL 
PART OF THE BOOK.

153
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,375
IN FACT, ITS SECRET
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

154
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,708
- TELL US, LUCY.
- WHAT THE DEVIL DO YOU MEAN?

155
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,416
- I'M NOT GONNA GIVE THIS BOOK
BACK TO YOU, DUKE EVERLUE,

156
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,583
'CAUSE IT WAS NEVER REALLY
YOURS TO BEGIN WITH.

157
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,458
OPEN,
GATE OF THE GIANT CRAB!

158
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,291
CANCER!

159
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,916
- CANCER.

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,833
- A GIANT CRAB!

161
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,333
OH YEAH.

162
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:11,666
NOTHING SAYS
"I'M GONNA KICK YOUR BUTT"

163
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,500
LIKE A CRAB MAN 
WITH RAZOR CLAWS

164
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,708
AND TOUGH-GUY SUNGLASSES.
( giggles )

165
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,375
- SHUT UP AND LET ME
CONCENTRATE,

166
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,833
OR I'LL HAVE HIM PINCH
YOUR LITTLE LIPS OFF. 

167
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,791
- HEY, LUCY,

168
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,208
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
YOUR HAIR DONE TODAY...

169
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,125
BABY?
- WHAT?!

170
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,083
- I DON'T NEED STYLING.
I NEED HELP.

171
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,875
IT'S THAT GUY.
TAKE CARE OF BALDY OVER THERE.

172
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,541
- WHATEVER YOU SAY, BABY.

173
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,875
- OH, SO HE JUST MAKES
THE BAD GUYS LOOK COOLER

174
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,625
BEFORE THEY KILL US.
THAT'S USEFUL.

175
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,625
YEAH, YOU SHOULD
SEND HIM BACK, LUCY.

176
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,000
- I SHOULD SEND YOU BACK.

177
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,291
- WHAT COULD THE SECRET
POSSIBLY BE?

178
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,041
THE HACK MUST HAVE
WRITTEN AN EXPOSE 

179
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,041
ON ALL OF MY
ILLEGAL BUSINESS DEALS.

180
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,791
I CAN'T HAVE THAT.

181
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,875
IF THE MAGIC COUNCIL
GOT WIND OF HOW I ACTUALLY

182
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,666
MADE MY FORTUNE,
MY GOOSE WOULD BE COOKED.

183
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,083
- OPEN,

184
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:59,416
GATE OF THE MAIDEN!

185
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,625
VIRGO!

186
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,083
- WHAT THE--?
- HE'S USING YOUR TRICK, LUCY.

187
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:08,875
- DID I HEAR MY MASTER
SUMMON ME?

188
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,083
- VIRGO,
FETCH ME THAT BOOK.

189
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,416
- HOLD UP.
SHE'S A CELESTIAL SPIRIT?

190
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,000
- BABY.
- ( all gasp )

191
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,750
- Happy and Lucy: NATSU!

192
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,083
- YEAH?
- WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?

193
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,708
- WHAT ARE YOU 
DOING UP THERE?

194
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,250
- WELL, I SAW HER GETTING UP,
SO I JUMPED ON HER

195
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,500
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
I ENDED UP HERE.

196
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,541
- SO YOU GRABBED
A HOLD OF HER INSIDE THE HOUSE?

197
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,833
BUT THAT MEANS...

198
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,416
YOU MUST HAVE PASSED THROUGH
THE SPIRIT GATE WITH HER.

199
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,041
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

200
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:41,500
- LUCY, WHAT THE HECK
DO I DO NOW?

201
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,250
FINISH WHAT YOU STARTED.

202
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,958
- VIRGO, CLEAN UP
THIS RUBBISH.

203
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,833
- AS YOU WISH, MASTER.

204
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:49,916
- NOW I'M FIRED UP.

205
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:58,083
FIRE DRAGON ROAR!

206
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,083
- YOU DIRTY LITTLE MOLE MAN!

207
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,000
- ( grunts )

208
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,958
- CAN'T DIG YOURSELF
OUT OF THIS!

209
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,125
YOU MAKE ME SICK!

210
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,625
- BOYOYOYOYOYOYOYO.

211
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,875
- BABY.
- ( whimpers )

212
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,375
- YOU'RE JUST ANOTHER
GREEDY VILLAIN.

213
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,291
- BOYO.
- OKAY, I'M DONE.

214
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,875
DOES THIS LOOK
FABULOUS OR WHAT, BABY?

215
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:25,000
- OH YEAH.  WAY TO GO,
CRAB-MAN-- BABY.

216
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,958
- ( rumbling )

217
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,000
- ( Lucy and Happy gasp )

218
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,000
- I LIKE YOUR STYLE.
OUT WITH A BANG.

219
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,583
YOU ARE DEFINITELY
GONNA FIT IN AT FAIRY TAIL.

220
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,166
- BUT AREN'T WE SUPPOSED
TO NOT DESTROY STUFF?

221
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,916
- I HOPE I DON'T
GET BLAMED FOR THIS.

222
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,916
- ( crowd laughs, cheers )

223
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,000
- AND THEN...

224
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,958
- WHEN I READ "DAYBREAK,"

225
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,000
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT WAS
WRITTEN BY KEMU ZALEON.

226
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,500
THERE'S NO WAY HE WOULD HAVE
DONE SOMETHING THAT BAD.

227
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,250
- YEAH, SO?

228
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,666
- SO THAT'S HOW I KNEW
THERE MUST BE A SPELL ON IT.

229
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,000
- ( gasps )

230
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:06,625
BUT I REQUESTED
THIS BOOK BE DESTROYED.

231
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,750
WHY ON EARTH ARE YOU
HANDING IT BACK TO ME

232
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,041
COMPLETELY UNSCATHED?

233
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,458
- IF YOU REALLY 
WANT TO BURN IT,

234
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,375
THEN I'D RATHER
YOU DO IT YOURSELF.

235
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,875
- I MOST CERTAINLY WILL
BURN THIS TRASH.

236
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,875
I NEVER WANTED TO
SEE IT AGAIN.

237
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,625
- I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU FEEL THE WAY YOU DO

238
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,416
ABOUT THIS BOOK, KABY.

239
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,875
YOU WANT TO PROTECT
YOUR FATHER'S LEGACY,

240
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,458
BECAUSE YOU'RE ACTUALLY
ZALEON'S SON, AREN'T YOU?

241
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:29,875
- HUH?

242
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,166
- YES, THAT'S TRUE.

243
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,041
- HAVE YOU READ IT YOURSELF?

244
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,541
- NO, I-- I COULD NEVER
BRING MYSELF TO DO IT. 

245
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,041
MY FATHER TOLD ME
IT WAS GARBAGE.

246
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,083
- YOU WERE JUST GONNA BURN IT?
- I WAS.

247
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,916
- WITHOUT EVEN BOTHERING
TO SEE WHAT'S INSIDE?

248
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,041
IT'S THE LAST BOOK THAT
YOUR DAD WROTE, RIGHT? 

249
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,083
SOME OF US WOULD KILL
FOR THAT KIND OF MEMORY.

250
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,916
- THAT'S ENOUGH, NATSU!
LET KABY EXPLAIN HIMSELF.

251
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,500
- ( sighs )
- PLEASE,

252
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,958
THAT BOOK CAUSED MY FAMILY
GREAT HEARTACHE AND SHAME.

253
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,541
IT WAS 31 YEARS AGO.
- ( door creaks open )

254
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,083
- FATHER?

255
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:09,083
- FORGIVE ME, SON.

256
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:12,000
- WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING
FROM YOU IN THREE YEARS.

257
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,291
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
ALL THIS TIME?

258
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,583
- SOMEWHERE I'LL NOT RETURN.

259
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:19,041
IT'S ALL OVER NOW.

260
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,625
- NO, FATHER.

261
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,875
- I'LL NEVER WRITE AGAIN!

262
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,250
( shouts )

263
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,958
- ( both scream )

264
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,000
- WHOA.

265
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,416
- YOU SHOULD HAVE
LISTENED TO ME.

266
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,958
I TOLD YOU YOU'D REGRET WORKING
FOR THAT HORRIBLE DUKE EVERLUE.

267
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:46,541
BUT YOU WENT AHEAD
AND DID IT ANYWAY. WHY?

268
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,291
- BECAUSE IT WAS GOOD MONEY.

269
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,541
- WHO CARES?
LOOK WHERE IT GOT YOU.

270
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:54,875
- ( sighs ) I'M SO GLAD 
I FINISHED THAT RUBBISH.

271
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,791
- WHAT THE HECK
ARE YOU SMILING ABOUT?

272
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,041
DO YOU THINK IT'S FUNNY TO LEAVE
YOUR FAMILY FOR THREE YEARS

273
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,708
TO WRITE A NOVEL
YOU'RE NOT EVEN PROUD OF?

274
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,958
- SON...

275
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:07,750
I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU
THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS GONE.

276
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:08,750
- THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST

277
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:09,750
WRITTEN SOMETHING
FOR HIM QUICKLY

278
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,416
AND COME BACK TO US.

279
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,416
INSTEAD, YOU ABANDONED
YOUR PRIDE AND YOUR FAMILY

280
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,875
RIGHT ALONG WITH IT.

281
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,750
YOU'RE A SAD EXCUSE
FOR A WRITER.

282
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,833
SELLING YOURSELF OUT
TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER.

283
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,750
YOU'RE NOT MUCH OF
A FATHER EITHER.

284
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,166
- ( sighs )

285
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:33,166
- NOT LONG AFTER THAT,
MY FATHER PASSED AWAY.

286
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,375
HOWEVER, THE ANGER AND BETRAYAL
I FELT TOWARDS HIM LIVED ON.

287
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,166
BUT AS THE YEARS
PASSED BY ME,

288
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,833
THAT ANGER SLOWLY
TURNED INTO REMORSE.

289
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,583
AND NOW...

290
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:50,166
IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME
TO ASK FOR HIS FORGIVENESS.

291
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,625
SO I DECIDED
TO MAKE AMENDS

292
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,083
BY DESTROYING 
THE FINAL WORK

293
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,166
THAT HAD CAUSED HIM
 SO MUCH UNHAPPINESS.

294
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,208
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY.

295
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,541
THE ONLY WAY I CAN
PRESERVE HIS LEGACY.

296
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,166
- ( match lights )

297
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,791
- I'M SURE THAT THIS
IS WHAT HE'D WANT.

298
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,833
- NO, YOU'RE WRONG.

299
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,708
- ( Natsu and Happy gasp )
- KABY, LOOK.

300
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,000
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

301
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,083
- A SPELL HAS BEEN
CAST ON THIS BOOK.

302
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,541
IT'S THE WORK OF THE WIZARD
KEMU ZALEON,

303
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,541
OR SHOULD I SAY
ZEKUA MELON?

304
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,708
- A SPELL?

305
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,708
"DEAR KABY."

306
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,416
- THAT'S RIGHT.
THIS BOOK IS HIS LETTER TO YOU.

307
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,666
DISGUISED BEHIND A SPELL THAT
REARRANGED ALL OF THE WORDS

308
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,208
SO NO ONE ELSE
COULD READ IT.

309
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,250
- WOW.
- PRETTY.

310
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,875
- HE DIDN'T STOP WRITING
BECAUSE HE WAS ASHAMED. 

311
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:49,250
HE STOPPED BECAUSE
HE HAD FINISHED HIS MASTERPIECE,

312
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,916
A NOVEL CONTAINING EVERYTHING
HE EVER WANTED TO SAY

313
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,083
TO HIS BELOVED SON.

314
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,416
AND WHEN YOU READ IT
THE WAY HE INTENDED,

315
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,208
IT'S EASILY HIS
BEST WORK EVER.

316
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,833
- "I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU
THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS GONE."

317
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,250
- AND NOW THAT
THE SPELL'S BEEN BROKEN,

318
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,541
YOU CAN READ IT
FOR YOURSELF.

319
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,958
- THANK YOU, FATHER.

320
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:16,291
I SWEAR THAT I WILL NEVER
LET ANY HARM COME TO THIS BOOK.

321
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,708
- WELL, I GUESS WE WON'T BE
COLLECTING THAT REWARD.

322
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,583
- AYE.
- HUH?!

323
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,791
- WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO DESTROY IT.

324
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,500
WE DIDN'T FINISH THE JOB.

325
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,458
- EVEN SO,
LET ME DO SOMETHING.

326
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,125
- YEAH, IT'S NOT OUR FAULT
HE DECIDED NOT TO BURN THE BOOK

327
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,625
AFTER WE GOT IT
BACK FOR HIM.

328
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,458
- LUCY, DON'T BE SO GREEDY.

329
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,458
YOU'RE TOTALLY RUINING
WHAT WAS A TOUCHING MOMENT.

330
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,125
- I NEED THE CASH!
- ( scoffs )

331
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,958
- THANKS FOR OFFERING,
BUT WE DON'T WANT IT. 

332
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,541
- UM, YES WE DO.
I NEED TO PAY RENT.

333
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,125
- I THINK IT'S TIME
WE ALL GO HOME.

334
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,875
THAT MEANS YOU TOO,
MR. MELON.

335
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,416
GO BACK HOME.

336
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,541
- ( gasps )

337
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,916
- UNBELIEVABLE.

338
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,250
WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MINDS WOULD
TURN DOWN TWO MILLION JEWEL?

339
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,583
- IF WE HAD TAKEN THE MONEY, 
IT WOULDN'T HAVE LOOKED GOOD.

340
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,500
YOU GOTTA THINK ABOUT
FAIRY TAIL'S REPUTATION.

341
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,750
- AYE.
- BUT WE MADE HIM HAPPY, RIGHT?

342
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,291
WE GOT THE JOB DONE
AND NOW WE'RE WALKING HOME.

343
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,583
( sighs )
AND THEN TO FIND OUT

344
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,416
THAT THEY'RE
NOT EVEN WEALTHY?

345
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,416
THEY WERE JUST
RENTING THAT HOUSE

346
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,708
SO EVERYBODY WOULD
THINK THEY WERE RICH.

347
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,541
IT'S NOT LIKE IT MATTERS.

348
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,166
WE WOULD HAVE TAKEN
THE JOB EITHER WAY.

349
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,500
- Happy:
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU.

350
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:20,625
- OF COURSE I WOULD HAVE!

351
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:21,583
- SURE, GREEDY.

352
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,333
- BY THE WAY,
THE HOUSE,

353
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,500
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT IT
WASN'T REALLY THEIRS? 

354
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,166
- HMM?
OH, THAT WAS EASY.

355
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,083
'CAUSE THEY SMELLED
LIKE SOME OTHER HOUSE.

356
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,166
SEEMED PRETTY OBVIOUS.
- AYE.

357
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,666
- SURE, TO YOU TWO ANIMALS,
MAYBE.

358
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,208
NOT ME.  I WAS STILL
LOST IN THE CLOUDS

359
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,625
FROM READING THAT BOOK.

360
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,375
- I'VE GOT YOU FIGURED OUT.

361
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:45,125
ALL THOSE PAPERS I FOUND
ON THE DESK AT YOUR PLACE.

362
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,875
YOU'RE WRITING A NOVEL,
AREN'T YOU?

363
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,666
- Happy: OH, SO THAT'S WHY
SHE'S SUCH A BOOKWORM.

364
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,458
- PROMISE YOU WON'T TELL 
ANYBODY ABOUT THAT, OKAY?

365
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,625
- WHY NOT?
- 'CAUSE I'M A HORRIBLE WRITER.

366
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,208
IF ANYBODY READ MY STUFF,
I'D DIE OF EMBARRASSMENT.

367
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,083
- DON'T WORRY.
NOBODY'S GONNA READ IT.

368
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,750
- YEAH, THAT DOESN'T REALLY
MAKE ME FEEL ANY BETTER.

369
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,875
- "I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS,
GUYS.

370
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,375
ARE YOU SURE WE'RE GOING 
THE RIGHT WAY," SHE ASKS.

371
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,208
- HAPPY SAYS THIS IS
THE WAY HOME,

372
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,625
SO THIS IS THE WAY
WE'RE GOING,

373
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:13,958
IS WHAT I ANSWER.

374
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,625
- HAVE SOME FAITH.
I'M A CAT.

375
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,250
I HAVE A GREAT 
SENSE OF SMELL.

376
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,833
MY NOSE WILL 
LEAD US HOME.

377
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,916
- "IT'S DOGS THAT
HAVE GREAT NOSES.

378
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
AND WHAT DOES SMELL HAVE
TO DO WITH DIRECTION,"

379
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,666
SHE ASKS QUITE HAUGHTILY.

380
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,583
- WHY DON'T YOU DO
YOUR OWN WALKING FOR A WHILE?

381
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,208
- "BECAUSE I'M TIRED," 
SHE GROANS EXHAUSTEDLY.

382
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,666
- Natsu: OH, BROTHER.

383
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,041
WHO'S THERE?

384
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,833
- "DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO FIGHT,"
SHE INQUIRES WORRIEDLY.

385
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,250
- YOU CAN TAKE HIM,
NATSU.

386
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,833
IT'S GRAY!

387
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,416
- "WHAT IS HE DOING
IN HIS UNDERWEAR," 

388
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,000
THE LADY QUESTIONS.
- TRYING TO FIND A BATHROOM.

389
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,583
- WHY WOULD YOU STRIP DOWN
BEFORE YOU FOUND ONE?

390
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,250
AND WHO THE HECK EVER
HEARD OF A BATHROOM

391
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,583
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREST?
- I WANTED SOME PRIVACY.

392
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,541
I DIDN'T EXPECT
AN IDIOT TO BARGE IN.

393
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,458
- I DIDN'T BARGE IN!
- THEY'RE SO CHILDISH.

394
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:00,875
- SHE SAYS TO THE CAT.

395
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,875
- SO YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY
BACK FROM A JOB?

396
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,875
- YEAH, THERE'S A SHORTCUT
THROUGH THESE WOODS

397
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,625
THAT'LL GET YOU BACK
TO TOWN IN NO TIME. 

398
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,416
- SEE? I TOLD YOU SO.

399
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,416
- YEAH, WELL IF YOUR
NOSE IS SO GREAT,

400
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,458
THEN HOW COME YOU DIDN'T KNOW 
GRAY WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF US,

401
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:17,291
SMART GUY? - THERE ARE SOME
THINGS YOU DON'T WANT TO SMELL.

402
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,125
- ( grunts )
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

403
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,291
- I AGREE.  SO GO ON HOME 
AND WE'LL SMELL YOU LATER.

404
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,041
- FINE, I WILL.
AND UNLESS YOU WANT TROUBLE,

405
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,166
YOU SHOULD TOO.
- WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

406
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,666
- 'CAUSE ERZA'S DUE BACK
ANY TIME NOW.

407
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,583
- ( gasps )
- THE ERZA?  WHOA.

408
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:34,041
- YEP, SHE'S THE MOST POWERFUL
WOMAN IN ALL OF FAIRY TAIL.

409
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,875
- I CAN'T WAIT
TO MEET HER.

410
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,125
BUT YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER EVEN
SEEN A PICTURE OF HER

411
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,750
IN "SORCERER WEEKLY"
OR ANYTHING.

412
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,458
WHAT'S SHE LIKE?
- All: SCARY.

413
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,333
- ( chuckles nervously )
- WILD ANIMAL?

414
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,916
- A VILE BEAST.
- MORE LIKE A FULL-ON MONSTER!

415
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,041
- ( crowd screams )
- ( groans )

416
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,166
- SHE'S NOT THAT BIG,
YOU GUYS.

417
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,000
- WELL,
SHE'S BIG ENOUGH FOR ME.

418
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,333
- ONE THING WE CAN
ALL AGREE ON

419
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,166
IS SHE IS DEFINITELY
THAT SCARY.

420
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,000
WELL, MAYBE A LITTLE SCARIER.

421
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,583
- ( roars )

422
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,416
- YEAH, SHE'S ABOUT THIS SCARY.

423
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,666
- WHAT?  I GUARANTEE YOU
ERZA COULD TAKE DOWN

424
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,833
AT LEAST THREE MOUNTAINS
WITH A SINGLE KICK.

425
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,500
- YOU DON'T NEED TO
EXAGGERATE LIKE THAT, GRAY.

426
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,583
IT'S MORE LIKE TWO.
- YOU KNOW, GUYS,

427
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:12,333
EVEN IF SHE'S ABLE
TO KICK DOWN A SINGLE MOUNTAIN,

428
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,000
THAT'S STILL SCARY.
- LIKE I SAID,

429
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,916
WE SHOULD GET BACK.
- CRAP, LET'S GET MOVING!

430
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,375
- ( all scream )

431
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,416
- ( coughs )
- WHAT NOW? 

432
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,916
- HAPPY?
- HELP ME.

433
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,291
- ( chuckles ) - WE'RE FINALLY
GONNA GET SOME REAL PROTEIN.

434
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,000
- NO BERRIES FOR US TONIGHT.

435
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,625
- MEAT!

436
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,208
- OUR FUTURE HOLDS A FEAST.

437
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,958
- WOW.
- LOOK AT HIM SHAKING. JEEZ.

438
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,791
- RELAX.  YOU'RE GONNA BE
IN OUR BELLIES SOON ENOUGH,

439
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,791
SO THERE'S NO NEED
TO BE SCARED.

440
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,958
- ACTUALLY, I'M NOT SHAKING
LIKE THIS BECAUSE I'M SCARED.

441
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,541
- HUH? - I GOTTA USE
THE BATHROOM REALLY BAD.

442
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,958
- HUH?
- I CAN'T HOLD IT MUCH LONGER.

443
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,291
AND I BET YOU IT'S GONNA
MAKE ME TASTE WEIRD.

444
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,375
- WHO CARES?
NOW COOK HIM.

445
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:55,625
- MEAT.

446
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,125
- I WILL TAKE MINE
MEDIUM, PLEASE.

447
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,833
- HEY, I'M SERIOUS.

448
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,666
IT'S GONNA MAKE ME TASTE FUNNY.
I JUST KNOW IT WILL.

449
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,083
- Natsu:
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

450
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,833
- HAPPY!
- THANK GOODNESS.

451
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,291
NOW I'M NOT GONNA TASTE WEIRD.
- PIPE DOWN.

452
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,583
- THAT'S OUR FRIEND YOU'RE
TRYING TO ROAST, BUDDY.

453
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,375
SORRY, BUT YOU GUYS ARE GONNA
HAVE TO MAKE

454
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:16,583
OTHER PLANS FOR DINNER.

455
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,250
- YOU'RE ALL WIZARDS,
AREN'T YOU?

456
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,583
WHAT GUILD ARE YOU WITH?

457
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,541
- I'M NOT TELLING.
GET HIM!

458
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,208
- GRAY, LET'S DO IT.

459

497
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,666
I CAN'T EVEN SENSE
THEIR PRESENCE ANYMORE.

498
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,041

00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,000
TAKE THE REWARD.

506
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:19,166
- BUT THINK ABOUT HOW HAPPY
YOU MADE HIM, LUCY.

507

DON'T GET DISCOURAGED.
I'M SURE YOU'LL HAVE BETTER LUCK
