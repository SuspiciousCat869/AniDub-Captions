1
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,541
[NATSU] Hey, Lucy!
Listen up!

2
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,916
I know that you
can hear me right now!

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,541
Just hang on!

4
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:29,916
I promise
I will save you!

5
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:34,791
Warning.

6
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:35,916
Another of the seals 

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,958
has disappeared.

8
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,916
If the remaining
three vanish,

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,833
The holders of the clock 

10
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,250
will lose possession.

11
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,375
[NATSU] C'mon Lucy!

12
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:45,333
Please snap out of it!

13
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:46,708
[Midnight giggles]

14
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,583
[MIDNIGHT] No matter
how much you plead,

15
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,250
it's useless.

16
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,000
Very soon, Lucy Heartfilia

17
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,291
and the Infinity Clock
will become one.

18
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,583
[KLODOA] And once they
are completely merged,

19
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:58,500
we will finally
have absolute control

20
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:00,250
over Real Nightmare!

21
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:01,000
Not happenin'!

22
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:02,250
I won't let anybody

23
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,458
touch my big sister.

24
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:05,875
She and I will
stay together

25
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:08,166
for the rest of time.

26
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,208
For all of eternity.

27
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,875
[NATSU] Previously,
on Fairy Tail!

28
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:45,750
[HAPPY] 
We were fighting

29
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:46,708
against the
Legion Platoon

30
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:47,666
over the clock hand

31
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,125
that Lucy's dad
gave to her.

32
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:49,958
When all of a sudden

33
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,416
the Neo- Oración Seis

34
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,958
just came outta nowhere!

35
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,708
[CARLA] They stole
the clock, abducted Lucy,

36
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,000
and activated the spell
known as Real Nightmare.

37
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,125
We chose our
strongest wizards

38
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,083
to rescue her,
and put an end to this

39
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,666
once and for all.

40
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,041
[PANTHERLILY] If we can defeat
all of their remaining members,

41
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,583
we'll be able to
stop the Real Nightmare.

42
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,500
There are only
three of them left.

43
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:14,916
[LAYLA] Happy
birthday, darling!

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,208
We love you.

45
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,041
[YOUNG LUCY] Thanks mommy!

46
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:17,833
And daddy!

47
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,625
And everybody else!

48
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,333
[LUCY] Wait a second.

49
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:25,208
Michelle's not here.

50
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,333
[LUCY] No, of
course she's not.

51
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,583
Because it
was all just a lie.

52
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,750
[WARREN] Natsu!
What's goin' on over there?

53
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,083
How's Lucy?

54
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,041
Not so good.

55
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,166
If we don't hurry, 

56
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,083
she's gonna be
absorbed by the Clock!

57
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,166
Are you serious?

58
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,666
[HAPPY] I Hear the
Voice of My Friend!

59
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:49,583
[LAKI] Lucy's
going to become

60
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,333
part of the Infinity Clock?

61
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,708
That must be why
telepathy can't reach her.

62
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:54,625
There's gotta be

63
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,250
some way that
we can help her.

64
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,250
[CARLA] You won't be helping
anyone, without rest!

65
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,750
Hey! Listen up
everybody!

66
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:00,666
[WARREN] We gotta
finish beating

67
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,583
the Oración Seis right now!

68
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:03,875
Because once Lucy merges

69
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,375
 with the Infinity Clock, 

70
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,625
it's game over!

71
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,833
We can't let that happen!

72
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:12,916
I heard that.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,125
If you defeat me, 

74
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,291
my seal will be
taken off the clock.

75
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,083
But you don't have

76
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,958
much time left to do that.

77
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,333
So just give up
and save yourself!

78
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,500
Ridiculous.

79
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,666
I would never
surrender to you.

80
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,958
[COBRA] You think
that even if you fall,

81
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,166
your friends will still
be around to help you?

82
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,208
There's no
way you can win

83
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,250
believing in
something so naïve.

84
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,375
[ERZA] Requip!

85
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,916
[COBRA] True power
requires true sacrifice!

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,958
And what we gave up
can never be replaced!

87
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,208
Erigor's memory.

88
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,041
Racer's humanity.

89
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,666
Angel gave away years
from her life!

90
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,875
But you
and your friends

91
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,250
don't have the strength
to make sacrifices!

92
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,125
We gave up everything
to get the kind of power

93
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,250
that you will never have!

94
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,833
[WARREN] Hey! Who is this?

95
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:56,791
Romeo?

96
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,000
What are you doing here?

97
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,750
You weren't supposed
to come along with us!

98
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,291
[ROMEO] I hitched
a ride on the Christina

99
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,208
without anyone knowing.

100
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,250
Did you really expect me 

101
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,000
to stay behind
at a time like this?

102
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,125
I can't believe you!

103
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,458
I understand
why you did it.

104
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,833
But still, kid.

105
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,458
Hey Romeo,
can you hear me?

106
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:12,791
[ROMEO] Yeah.

107
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,166
Try to find another
member of Fairy Tail, okay?

108
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,333
[WARREN] But do it quickly!

109
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,500
Lucy's in trouble 

110
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,916
and the only
way to save her

111
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,958
is to beat
the Neo-Oración Seis!

112
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,458
[ROMEO]
Which way should I go?

113
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,250
[CARLA] Natsu's the
closest person to you.

114
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,916
I'll tell you
where to find him!

115
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,458
[ROMEO] Thank you!

116
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,250
[WARREN] Happy! Lily!

117
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,291
[HAPPY] We just
heard all of that!

118
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,041
[PANTHERLILY]
We'll go and meet

119
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,166
them there at once!

120
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,375
[WARREN] We're
counting on you!

121
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,708
You're the only ones
who can stop Samuel!

122
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,041
[PANTHERLILY] Roger!
[HAPPY] Aye, Sir!

123
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:40,125
[BYRO] What is the
Archbishop's condition?

124
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,875
[WARREN] It's you!

125
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:43,666
[LAKI] Oh no!

126
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,375
What happened to Gildarts?

127
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,500
[BYRO] Both he
and another one

128
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,208
of your
comrades took a fall.

129
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,833
But, I'm sure
they're unharmed.

130
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,166
Now, can you tell me

131
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,375
what's become of
Samuel and the others?

132
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:55,333
[LAKI] There's
no reason for you

133
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,958
to go after
Lucy anymore!

134
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,250
[CARLA] If all
Six Demons are defeated,

135
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,375
their seals will
vanish from the clock.

136
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,833
They'll lose control.

137
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,000
[BYRO] True.

138
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,333
But it will
all be for naught

139
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:05,541
once Lucy Heartfilia

140
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,958
completely merges
with the device.

141
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,541
Correct?

142
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,500
[WENDY] Yeah, but.

143
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,666
[ARCHBISHOP]
There is yet another way.

144
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,500
[BYRO] Your Excellency!

145
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:17,375
[ARCHBISHOP] Finally.

146
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,166
My nightmare has now ended.

147
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,250
It was such a
helpless feeling

148
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,750
being controlled
like a puppet.

149
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,000
Forced into actions that 

150
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,500
brought about this situation.

151
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,125
However, these kind souls

152
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,875
put their very
lives on the line

153
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,708
in order to rescue me.

154
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,666
Although I didn't
intend for it,

155
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,583
I was forced into the
position of their enemy.

156
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,291
Amid the chaos,
they came to my aid.

157
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,541
[LAKI] Sir?

158
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,125
[WARREN] Can you please
explain something to us?

159
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,875
[WENDY] Yes, please sir.

160
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,541
You know a lot
about the clock.

161
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,416
Isn't that right?

162
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,708
[ARCHBISHOP] I assume
you want to know

163
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:54,500
how you can free the
captured celestial wizard?

164
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:57,333
[NATSU] You say you wanna
be with Lucy forever, huh?

165
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,458
Have you ever
thought about

166
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,333
what she might want?

167
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,500
I can tell you,

168
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,625
she just wants to
believe in you again.

169
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:04,583
You betrayed her, 

170
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:07,083
but I know she
can forgive you.

171
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,666
Why can't you
understand that?

172
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,208
[MIDNIGHT]
Don't confuse the issue.

173
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,708
Imitatia is
simply attempting

174
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,333
to reclaim that
which she once lost.

175
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:17,666
Aren't you?

176
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,416
[NATSU] Listen!

177
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,791
I know my
sister and I

178
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,625
want the same thing!

179
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:25,708
After all.

180
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,958
We were always
together before!

181
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,666
What?

182
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,208
[ROMEO] You liar!

183
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,500
[NATSU] Romeo!

184
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,708
Nobody believes a
single word you say anymore!

185
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:36,875
It's over.

186
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,958
You lied when you
said you were Michelle!

187
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,250
So why in the hell
should we believe you now?

188
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,250
It's the truth.

189
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,875
I was there!

190
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:45,875
Do you know
how happy

191
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,083
Lucy was to meet you?

192
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,750
She'd just lost her
last family member

193
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,250
when you came along!

194
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,583
Her heart was broken!

195
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:56,125
And you took advantage
of the pain she was in!

196
00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:00,083
She put her
trust in you.

197
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:05,166
So did I,
but then, you lied!

198
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,875
Romeo, look.

199
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,666
[KLODOA] Don't let this
brat's childish words

200
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,000
weaken your
resolve, Imitatia.

201
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,291
Remember,
anyone who stands

202
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,458
in your way is the enemy.

203
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,000
[ROMEO] So what
do you have to say

204
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,875
for yourself, huh?

205
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,541
[MIDNIGHT] Kill him.

206
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,833
[NATSU] Romeo!

207
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,208
[ROMEO] Michelle...

208
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,083
How could you?

209
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,791
All right, that's it, lady.

210
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,666
I don't give
a crap who you are.

211
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,916
You're gonna pay
for what you've done.

212
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:46,000
I gotta save Lucy,
and you're in my way.

213
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:47,750
[IMITATIA] I see.

214
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,125
[KLODOA] Oh yes!

215
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,041
It looks like these two are
about to put on a show!

216
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,500
[MIDNIGHT] Do not
fail me Imitatia.

217
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,000
And be sure that
you don't forget

218
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,500
who's in charge here.

219
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,791
If you wish for me
to breathe life

220
00:08:58,875 --> 00:08:59,791
into your prayer,

221
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,666
Show your loyalty.

222
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:15,041
[LUCY] Please, Michelle.
Please, stop.

223
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,000
You're gonna
regret that!

224
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,541
[KLODOA] Yes! That's my girl.

225
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,083
Keep your eyes focused
squarely on the prize.

226
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,875
Your deepest,
most heartfelt wish

227
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,916
an eternity to spend
with your dear big sister.

228
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,916
[MIDNIGHT]
Now, snuff him out.

229
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,958
Extinguish his fire
and realize your dream.

230
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,500
I can make it
come to fruition.

231
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:35,875
Entangle him.

232
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,416
Rip this fool
to shreds!

233
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,583
[LUCY] I'm begging you.

234
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,541
Please.

235
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,000
[LUCY] Warning.

236
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,125
A blood-thirsty enemy 

237
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,541
is quickly approaching.

238
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,250
[COCO] Who is it?

239
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:57,625
No, Samuel!

240
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,416
What are
you doing here?

241
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,625
The only thing I can do!

242
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,083
Killing Lucy Heartfilia,

243
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,666
so we can put an end
to this madness!

244
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,708
[IMITATIA] No!

245
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:32,875
[SAMUEL]
Move aside, Coco!

246
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,041
No, never!

247
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,250
We don't have
time to argue about this!

248
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,291
Then go ahead.

249
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,750
If you wanna
get to Lucy,

250
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:42,583
you're gonna have to
tear through me first!

251
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,666
[SAMUEL] Look, I've put
aside church doctrine for now.

252
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,875
I'm doing this solely
for the greater good!

253
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,125
Even when you
know in your heart

254
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,333
that it's wrong?

255
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,791
Is it?

256
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:52,958
I don't even
need to calculate

257
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,291
the outcome this time.

258
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,750
We trade one life
for the sake

259
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,333
of our entire civilization!

260
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,000
[HAPPY] No you don't!

261
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,000
[COCO] It's you.

262
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,583
[PANTHERLILY]
I'll take care of him.

263
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,416
[NATSU] Just in time!

264
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,000
So your
answer is more bloodshed?

265
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,000
You need to learn
the value of life!

266
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,125
I guess I'll have to
school you some more.

267
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,083
Come and
get me brother.

268
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,375
[PANTHERLILY] Sammy!

269
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,250
[HAPPY]
Come on, wake up!

270
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,041
Lucy?

271
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,000
Can you hear me?

272
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,125
Hello?

273
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,416
I'm talkin' to you!

274
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,416
[LUCY] Yes.

275
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,291
I can hear you,
but I can't move.

276
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,958
I can't do anything!

277
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,958
[LUCY] I see my
friends being beaten

278
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,208
right in front of me.

279
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:36,791
But there's nothing
I can do to help!

280
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,250
It breaks my heart.

281
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:42,250
I can't stand to see
my friends in such pain.

282
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,791
[COCO] She's crying.

283
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:46,708
[HAPPY] Yeah!

284
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,833
I bet that means
she can hear us!

285
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,750
Lucy's fightin' even
harder than we are!

286
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:55,833
There's no way in
hell we're givin' up now!

287
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,583
[KLODOA] Ugh! What
a stubborn fool!

288
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:58,666
This is why I said

289
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,000
we should
exterminate him

290
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,625
instead of taking
him hostage!

291
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:03,333
[MIDNIGHT] You can fight, 

292
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:04,583
but it's far too late.

293
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,583
You have zero
chance of victory.

294
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,291
[ERZA] Tell me!

295
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,583
Why do you go to such
lengths for power?

296
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,750
Causing all this
chaos and pain.

297
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:18,375
Dragging the whole
world into your sorrow.

298
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,166
Is your desire for
vengeance that strong?

299
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,875
[COBRA] Yes.

300
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,250
And that's not
all, Titania.

301
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:28,750
I'm doing this so
I can face Cubellios!

302
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,958
Don't you
understand?

303
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,916
Not that I've given up
all that I had.

304
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,875
I have no fear of
losing everything!

305
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,333
[COBRA] And without
that kind of fear.

306
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,166
I have true power!

307
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,125
[WARREN]
Listen up, everyone!

308
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,375
There's still hope!

309
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,791
We've found a way to slow down 

310
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,416
Lucy's merging
with the Infinity Clock!

311
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,166
I'll go ahead and let the
Archbishop explain it to you.

312
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,125
[COCO] The
Archbishop's with him?

313
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,000
[ARCHBISHOP] For
the clock to fully merge

314
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,291
with a sacrificial
celestial wizard,

315
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,125
It must slowly
become integrated

316
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,000
with that
individual's mind

317
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,083
as well as their
sense of time.

318
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,291
[ARCHBISHOP]
To put it another way,

319
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:08,125
it must combine
with her memory.

320
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,125
[ARCHBISHOP]
The chains extending

321
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,625
from the Infinity Castle

322
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,166
serve two purposes.

323
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,416
Not only do they spread 

324
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,041
the Real Nightmare
spell into the Earth,

325
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,541
but they also absorb
all of the magic power

326
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,333
and memories of
those who dwell on it.

327
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,041
[WARREN] So we
can buy some time!

328
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,166
But we're gonna have 

329
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,291
to start breakin'
those chains!

330
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,333
[WARREN] Byro and his men
have already started the job!

331
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,916
We have to help
them finish it!

332
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,666
[GAJEEL] Okay.

333
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,458
Looks like I'm gonna need
an appetite for this job.

334
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,416
[PANTHERLILY]
Didja hear that?

335
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,208
[SAMUEL] Yes.

336
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,291
Very clearly.

337
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,666
It seems
I was wrong.

338
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,708
[PANTHERLILY]
Forget it.

339
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,666
Everybody makes
mistakes sometimes.

340
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,333
I know
I certainly have.

341
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:50,583
The real test...

342
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,291
Is how you make
things right.

343
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,291
Isn't it?

344
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,208
[PANTHERLILY] Let's go
cut some chains, Sammy!

345
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,375
[SAMUEL] Yes!

346
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,000
And whoever severs
the most is the victor.

347
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,041
Sound good?

348
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,250
[PANTHERLILY]
You're on!

349
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,250
[NATSU] Fire Dragon Talon!

350
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,666
[IMITATIA]
You're not giving up?

351
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,541
Do you really think
you have a chance?

352
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:10,750
[NATSU] I heard
what the old guy said,

353
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,000
so you bet I do!

354
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,875
[MIDNIGHT]
Such a feeble hope.

355
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,375
Go ahead and waste
all your power!

356
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,000
[COBRA ] It's time
I finish you,

357
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,041
once and for all!

358
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,375
[COBRA] Cubellios.

359
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,458
You gave me one 

360
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,333
final breath before
you departed.

361
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,791
[COBRA] Now I'll
put it to use.

362
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:30,958
[ERZA]
So he's one

363
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,708
of the Second Generation
Dragon Slayers.

364
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:35,458
[COBRA] I'll rot the
flesh off your bones!

365
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:39,000
[COBRA] Poison Dragon Roar!

366
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,166
[COBRA] What happened?

367
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:47,750
[ERZA] This
ancient weapon

368
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,750
was created to
ward away evil!

369
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:50,791
As you see,

370
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,541
It proves quite
useful in battle.

371
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,541
[COBRA] I can't
hear your thoughts

372
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,916
if you don't know them yourself.

373
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,166
[COBRA] You grabbed
that weapon

374
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,791
completely
out of instinct.

375
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,833
You should
try listening to my heart!

376
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,458
[COBRA]
So, you're willing

377
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,458
to make a big
sacrifice after all?

378
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,750
You'll cut these chains

379
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,083
and risk killing us both!

380
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,000
Here's one!

381
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,583
Two!

382
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,666
It's too late for this!

383
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,458
[GAJEEL] Man, this
stuff is disgusting!

384
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:34,708
[GAJEEL] Whoa.

385
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,083
It looks like they're
goin' all out up there!

386
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,583
Can't let 'em
show me up.

387
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,458
Can I?

388
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,041
[BYRO] We must
sever the next chain!

389
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,000
Hurry!

390
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,208
[GUTMAN] I heard
the Archbishop

391
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,041
talking to
little ol' me!

392
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,000
Forget about the
stupid Legion Platoon!

393
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,458
We gotta turn some
frowns upside down

394
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,958
and fix what
we did wrong!

395
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,833
So let's do it!

396
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:04,625
[SAMUEL]
That's five for me!

397
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,541
[PANTHERLILY]
I got seven!

398
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,250
[KINANA] I can hear it!

399
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,458
It's calling me!

400
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:15,791
[KINANA]
It's so close now.

401
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,583
The voice is
getting stronger.

402
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:21,208
The voice of my friend!

403
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,250
[ERZA] Cobra.

404
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,291
You told me
your power

405
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:24,541
comes from the
things you've lost.

406
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:25,875
Your sacrifices.

407
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,250
[ERZA] Having
nothing to lose

408
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,833
isn't the same
as being strong!

409
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,250
[COBRA] If you have a point,

410
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,541
then go ahead
and make it!

411
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,625
[ERZA] Fighting to protect
what you hold dear.

412
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,166
Not giving
it all away.

413
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,958
That's true power.

414
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,833
You can't live
only for yourself!

415
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,791
Not caring
about anything else.

416
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:42,916
If you ask me,

417
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,541
that's the very
definition of cowardice!

418
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:46,708
[COBRA] What?

419
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,291
If this
friend of yours

420
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,083
was to come back,

421
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,291
how could you even

422
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,166
look them in the eye?

423
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,166
Shut up!

424
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,791
You lasted longer
than I expected!

425
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,250
But it's over now!

426
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,541
Time to die, Titania!

427
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,000
[COBRA] Cubellios?

428
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,625
It can't be!

429
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,000
No way.

430
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:15,625
But still.

431
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,000
I hear her!

432
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,583
[COBRA] She has
a different body,

433
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,666
but I can still
hear her mind!

434
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,458
It's hard to believe,
but I know it's her!

435
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:26,666
[ERZA] It seems
you've also sacrificed

436
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,458
your focus in battle.

437
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,333
[COBRA] Damn you!

438
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,000
[ERZA] Having
friends to care for

439
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,500
doesn't make you weak.

440
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,583
It's the opposite.

441
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:46,625
You realize that
now, don't you Cobra?

442
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,166
I know you hear it.

443
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,875
The voice of your friend
calling out to you.

444
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,125
Telling you that
you still care.

445
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,666
[KINANA] That's him!

446
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,583
Yes!

447
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,291
I can hear his voice!

448
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,083
And there's
the shooting star!

449
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,166
It's true!

450
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,041
That is him!

451
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,375
[KINANA] He's
come back to me!

452
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,583
[LUCY] Warning.

453
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,666
Another seal has
been erased.

454
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,958
Now only two remain.

455
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,083
[KLODOA]
Cobra's been defeated?

456
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,208
This is terrible.

457
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,291
[NATSU] Aw, yeah!

458
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,375
Now all I gotta do
is kick your butts

459
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,791
and it's over!

460
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:26,833
[IMITATIA]
How can you be

461
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,041
so stubborn
and single-minded?

462
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,666
At this point,
all you can do

463
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,291
is delay
the inevitable.

464
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,541
It's far too late
to change anything.

465
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,791
[MIDNIGHT]
I will complete

466
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,625
what my
father could not.

467
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,041
To wipe out all that
has form in this world,

468
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,875
and to usher in a new
age of pure chaos.

469
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,208
You got in
our way seven years ago,

470
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,875
but history will
not repeat itself.

471
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,750
I will destroy you.

472
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:53,833
[HAPPY] Natsu!
[COCO] Natsu!

473
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,958
[MIDNIGHT] And just
so you understand,

474
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,250
this celestial wizard,

475
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,708
whose life you're
desperately trying to save,

476
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:02,125
She's already gone.

477
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,291
A lost cause.

478
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:07,083
She could survive
a century-long slumber.

479
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,333
But she will
actually become

480
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:11,208
one with the Clock
and lose herself entirely.

481
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:14,625
Her mind and body merging
with the clock itself.

482
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:15,916
At that point,
she will fade

483
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,125
from the memories

484
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,416
of those who claimed
to love her so dearly.

485
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,791
Her very existence

486
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,375
will be completely
erased from this world.

487
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:29,291
[IMITATIA] No, what
are you saying?

488
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,291
Is that true?

489
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,583
She can't.

490
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,625
She's supposed to
stay with me forever.

491
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:34,583
[MIDNIGHT] But you
don't understand,

492
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,458
that can still happen.

493
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,750
She is simply
going to change her form

494
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,666
to one that's more
suited to our needs.

495
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,166
You can
still be with her.

496
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,208
[MIDNIGHT] In fact,
she'll be the perfect companion

497
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,583
for someone
as empty as you.

498
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,875
No.

499
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,041
No!

500
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,500
My deepest wish.

501
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,916
My one true prayer.

502
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,958
This isn't
what I wanted!

503
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,875
Sister!

504
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,375
What are you doing?

505
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,500
Stay away!

506
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,375
Move!

507
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,625
Sister! Please!

508
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,291
Please forgive me!

509
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,041
I'm so sorry!

510
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,541
Please!

511
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,291
[LUCY] 
Michelle.

512
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,500
All of your tears.

513
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,000
Your appetite.

514
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,333
Your clumsiness.

515
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,041
You're so cool.

516
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,750
Living your dream.

517
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,541
I'm jealous.

518
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:41,583
That's just a strategy

519
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,125
to avoid feeling guilty.

520
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,291
Harden your heart
to suffering

521
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:48,041
and you can
justify any decision.

522
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,875
[LUCY]
Poor Michelle.

523
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,708
You were suffering
all along, weren't you?

524
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,458
[KLODOA] Well, this is an
unfortunate turn of events.

525
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:02,750
[MIDNIGHT] How pathetic.

526
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:03,750
Imitatia.

527
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,416
You are no longer
useful to me.

528
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,208
Back to the trash heap.

529
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,750
Sister.

530
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,041
[MICHELLE]
Big Sister.

531
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,416
I'm so sorry.

532
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,375
I love you.

533
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,666
[LUCY] Yes.

534
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,333
It makes sense now.

535
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:47,625
That's why
she wanted things

536
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,083
to go back to the way
they were before.

537
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,625
Really?

538
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:52,958
Do you mean it?

539
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:58,458
[LUCY] Yeah!

540
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,791
She wasn't lying to me.

541
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:03,291
She really believed it.

542
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,958
And at one point...

543
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,833
I did, too.

544
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:09,875
She was my little sister.

545
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:15,708
[MIDNIGHT] Filthy,
little piece of garbage.

546
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,000
[KLODOA] Now, now.

547
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:20,458
You don't wanna soil
your shoes, do you Master?

548
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,208
[NATSU] You monster.

549
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,250
[ROMEO] Natsu! Catch!

550
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,458
[MIDNIGHT] Yes! That's it!

551
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:32,791
Do you really think that

552
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,416
other people's suffering
is something to laugh at?

553
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,250
That it's a joke?

554
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,333
Get ready.

555
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,000
'Cause things're
about to get

556
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,958
really funny for you, pal!

557
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:14,916
[NATSU] No, that thing's
gonna swallow up Lucy!

558
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,291
[HAPPY] Taking out
the new Brain

559
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:17,250
is the only
chance we've got!

560
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:17,958
[NATSU] Yeah, I know.

561
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,125
But it's gonna be tough.

562
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,333
He's got a bigger
chip on his shoulder

563
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:22,916
than anyone else in
the Neo-Oración Seis.

564
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,916
[HAPPY] Come on, Natsu!

565
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,208
There's no way
that we can lose!

566
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:27,208
We've got a lot more
heart than that big jerk!

567
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:28,875
And we've got all our
friends in Fairy Tail

568
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,166
to back us up!

569
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,416
[NATSU] Next time:
Lucy and Michelle!

570
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,041
[HAPPY] [NATSU]
Next time: Lucy and Michelle!

571
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,291
[NATSU] Yeah, but
you and I both know

572
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:35,375
that I'm the only one

573
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:36,791
who's actually
gonna fight him, right?

574
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,375
[HAPPY] Hey, we're
all with you in spirit!

575
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:39,583
[NATSU] Thanks,
but don't go tryin'

576
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:41,500
to steal my
thunder after I win!
