Stop being such a sore loser!

163
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:50,583
You're a meanie!

164
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,000
No I'm not!
You are!

165
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,208
And a jerkface!

166
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,750
--It takes one to know one!
--Smart-Alec!

167
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,291
[CARLA] At least we aren't being
hunted by a water twister...

168
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,875
I suppose that this beats that.

169
00:08:58,958 --> 00:08:59,625
[AQUARIUS]
You called me a meanie!

170
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:00,500
You shot me!

171
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,625
You kind of shot yourself.

172
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,416
Because of you!

173
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,583
Going to cry about it?

174
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,000
Of course not!

175
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:08,166
No... If I could pick,
I think I'd take the twister.

176
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,250
[WENDY] I'd rather eat my foot!

177
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,250
Look, it's going to make
me all kinds of mad

178
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,708
if you won't play
with me, you got it?

179
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,208
I'm serious!

180
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,416
I'm sorry, I don't speak meanie,
could you translate that?

181
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,875
[AQUARIUS]
You're making me mad!

182
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,416
Well I don't care!

183
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,000
You'd better stop
calling me a meanie!

184
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,666
'Cause you're the mean one!

185
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,583
[WENDY yells]

186
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:25,875
[CARLA]
So much for diplomacy.

187
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:29,666
Whoa, you're fast!
Hey, let's play tag instead!

188
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,708
[WATER MONSTER roars]

189
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:32,750
[WENDY screams]

190
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,000
[WATER MONSTER roars]

191
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,916
[WENDY screams]

192
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,666
[WENDY] Dad gummit, this is
nothing like tag!

193
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,583
I'm tired of running,
let me at her!

194
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,416
This little brat needs
to be taught a lesson!

195
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,083
Take me to the ground, Carla!

196
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,458
[CARLA] That's far
too dangerous!

197
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,083
You've seen how powerful she is!

198
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,250
Come on!

199
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,666
Look, Carla!
I can do this!

200
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,666
[AQUARIUS laughs]

201
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,875
[WATER MONSTER 209A]

202
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,041
Beat those tiny wings
as fast as you can!

203
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,333
[WATER MONSTER roars]

204
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,750
[WENDY &amp; CARLA scream]

205
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,041
Aw, the poor
guy bit himself...

206
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,041
But I think he's
going to be okay.

207
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,083
[WATER MONSTER roars]

208
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,416
Oh. Guess they're hiding, huh?

209
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,666
Yay!

210
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,583
You know what that means:
Hide-and-go-seek!

211
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,708
That's our most
favorite game ever!

212
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:28,750
[WATER MONSTER roars]

213
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,708
No clues?
They're good hiders!

214
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,208
Fine. We'll have
to flush them out!

215
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,708
[WATER MONSTER roars]

216
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,083
[WENDY gasps]

217
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,750
This girl's crazy!
What do we do?!

218
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,083
[WENDY &amp; CARLA gasp]

219
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,666
So that's where
you were hiding!

220
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,750
I'm going to get you now!

221
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,583
Ow, What's the deal
with these raindrops?!

222
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,583
They're as sharp as knives!

223
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,875
Aw. I could've sworn
I'd get them with that one!

224
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,041
Uh, excuse me, Aquarius?

225
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,875
[CARLA] Be more assertive!

226
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,416
What gives you
the right to do this?

227
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,041
The entire amusement park
is in shambles 'cause of you!

228
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,041
Now there's lots of
broke stuff to hide in!

229
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,166
[WENDY] Nu-uh!
No more Hide-and-Seek!

230
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,333
Fine! There are tons
and tons more games

231
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,291
that we can play
around here!

232
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,125
You are really
difficult to talk to!

233
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:33,041
What you did was dangerous,
and you need to realize that!

234
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,250
[CARLA] Sheesh.

235
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,125
If you'd asked me to
drop you, I would've.

236
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,750
[WENDY]
Sky Dragon...

237
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,125
...Wing Attack!

238
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,416
Wait a second,
time-out!

239
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,666
Say what?

240
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,958
I spy someplace tasty,
right over that way.

241
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,583
[WENDY] Huh?
You do? What is it?

242
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,458
I'm pointing
right at it, silly!

243
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:54,083
Uh... yeah.
Could I have another clue?

244
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:05,208
It's two against one.
Why not fight me?

245
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,000
What do you think
of my swimming, Ma?

246
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,166
I've been practicing
my freestyle!

247
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,250
[PISCES MOM] You swim
beautifully, snookums.

248
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,000
[PISCES BOY] Cut it out
with the pet names!

249
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:16,416
Forget you, Hag, I can
take her out all by myself!

250
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,666
[PISCES MOM]
Why do you hate me so?

251
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,916
You've called
me mean names

252
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,333
and you've fought
girls without me,

253
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,833
but both at once?
I can barely take it!

254
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,625
I won't hurt you!

255
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,125
[MIRAJANE growls]

256
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,041
I spy someplace tasty,
right over that way!

257
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,541
[WENDY] Huh?
You do? What is it?

258
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,208
I'm pointing
right at it, silly!

259
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:38,750
Uh. Yeah.
Could I have another clue?

260
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,958
The ice cream shop,
doofus, let's go!

261
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:47,583
Uh, you...
want ice cream?

262
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:54,916
Okay, but this isn't exactly
the best time for treats.

263
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:57,916
[AQUARIUS giggles]

264
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,583
Let's go! I'm sure
you'll like it!

265
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,250
[AQUARIUS giggles]

266
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,958
Oh, look, diplomacy
has resumed.

267
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,375
[AQUARIUS] I hope
you're as excited as I am!

268
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,125
Cause you're in for
a crazy good treat!

269
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,500
Hurry up, Wendy,
you walk like an old lady!

270
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,125
[AQUARIUS giggles]

271
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,833
I'm all for talking this out.

272
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,416
But there's a key
difference between

273
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,625
speaking to your foe and letting
her lead you into a trap!

274
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,500
Ice cream...

275
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,791
No! Don't be a fool!

276
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,208
She'll give you worse
than a brain freeze!

277
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,375
[AQUARIUS]
Here you go!

278
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,750
Thank you!
Wow, it looks delicious!

279
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:30,916
[AQUARIUS]
You're welcome!

280
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,375
Nothing like some
break-time ice cream!

281
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,791
More like death cream.
Don't eat that.

282
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,708
I have reason to believe
that it's been poisoned.

283
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,125
There's no telling
what she might've--

284
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,166
[AQUARIUS]
Hey, kitty?

285
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,500
I made this one for you!

286
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,750
[CARLA] Oh.
Thank you.

287
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,750
Wait, I can't accept
this, take it back!

288
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,125
Then give it to me.

289
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,500
What? You actually
ate some of it?

290
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,041
I told you this was
awesome ice cream!

291
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,291
I give in.

292
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:01,166
Well, it doesn't particularly
taste like it's been poisoned.

293
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,500
[AQUARIUS] I've tasted
every flavor of ice cream here!

294
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,916
And you know what?
I still can't pick a favorite!

295
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,458
[WENDY] It's a big decision.
Don't rush yourself.

296
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:18,666
[CARLA] This stuff is more
than not bad. It's... decent.

297
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,333
[WENDY] I have a scoop
of ice cream with you

298
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,916
and now it feels
like we're friends.

299
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,166
[AQUARIUS]
We are.

300
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,791
Plus it was two scoops,
so we're double friends.

301
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:31,208
[AQUARIUS hums]

302
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,666
[WENDY giggles]

303
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,250
[AQUARIUS giggles]

304
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,416
Hey! Eyes off my chocolate.

305
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,666
[WENDY giggles]

306
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,583
Touch your nose.

307
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,541
[AQUARIUS laughs]

308
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,958
[WENDY giggles]

309
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:47,458
[CARLA] My!
This is more than decent.

310
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,916
So, was it as
yummy as promised?

311
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,375
It was the best dessert
I've ever had.

312
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,166
[giggling]

313
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,166
Now that we're friends,
we should stop fighting.

314
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,250
[AQUARIUS]
What're you talking about?

315
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,416
We never fought.

316
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,708
[WENDY] Huh?

317
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,625
We were playing,
remember?

318
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,250
So let's get back to it!

319
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:11,666
But, I don't like that game.

320
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,583
And we just had ice cream,
two scoops each,

321
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:14,750
that means we're friends!

322
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,458
Put down the urn!
Please don't hurt me!

323
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,041
[CARLA] Wait, I haven't
finished mine.

324
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,958
I said it was a trap,
but did you listen? No!

325
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,416
You really are
a quick one!

326
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,458
[WENDY &amp; CARLA scream]

327
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,083
What was that?!

328
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,958
[WENDY grunts]

329
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,041
[WENDY screams]

330
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:40,791
This isn't good!

331
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,833
We're sitting ducks
up here, Carla!

332
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,291
Hey, what happened?
Are you okay?

333
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,000
Just peachy,
why do you ask?

334
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,416
Because your spirit friend
shot me with her magic urn?

335
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,916
Or because the only limbs
that I can move

336
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,916
are my stubby
little legs? Help me!

337
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,708
I'll try, but I don't know
if I can reach that far.

338
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:56,875
[CARLA] You can't just
tug on my foot!

339
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,000
You'll have to pull
me from the inside!

340
00:15:59,083 --> 00:15:59,708
[WENDY grunts]

341
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,083
[WENDY] Okay, got it.

342
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,625
So, I don't think
I can get in there.

343
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,083
[CARLA] What do
you mean by that?!

344
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,208
She's coming!

345
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,833
[CARLA] Do something, quickly!

346
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,208
Wow, such a pretty view
and I'm only halfway up!

347
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,958
Bet yours is even better!

348
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,916
Enjoy it while you can!

349
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,166
Please stop shooting!

350
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,708
You'll knock down
the whole Ferris Wheel!

351
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,250
Ha, ha, ha!
Sounds like fun!

352
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,916
I think I'll aim for
something fragile this time!

353
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,250
Like me?!

354
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,208
Awww...

355

[WENDY] Whoa, is that Natsu?

358
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,583
Sounds like him!

359
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,750
[NATSU] Look out below!

360
00:16:58,833 --> 00:16:59,875
That's weird.

361
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,375
Didn't think that
meteors could yell.

362

[NATSU groans]

364
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:09,958
[NATSU] Don't worry, Wendy...
Natsu to the rescue...

365
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,875
[WENDY] You two look
horrible, what happened?

366
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,416
Are you all right?

367
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,875
[HAPPY] There's not a fur on
my body that feels all right.

368
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,750
Loke blew us straight
out of his world

369
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,375
with this crazy-strong attack.

370
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,791
[NATSU] Yup.

371
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,083
Is it just me or is that
happening way too much lately?

372
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,333
[CARLA] Happy! Happy!
Look over here!

373
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,916
Uhh... Carla!
I sure am glad that you're okay!

374
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,291
Do I seem okay?!

375
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,250
My head's stuck
in a pane of glass.

376
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,000
Get over here and
pull me out, please!

377
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,083
[HAPPY]
No problem!

378
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,958
[BOTH grunt]

379
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,250

381
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,291
[CARLA] That was way more rough!

--Sorry.
--Hurry!

384

[HAPPY] Hey look,
I'm trying my best here,

385
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:47,833
but the thing is that.

386
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,875
I just took a pretty
serious beat-down,

387
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,500
so I'm feeling kind of woozy.

388
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,791
Tell it to me straight, Wendy.
Does this thing move?

389
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,666
It's supposed to,
but not right now.

390
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,708
Well, that's a relief.

391
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,375
[AQUARIUS] If you've
got Natsu up there,

392
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,916
tell him that he
hasta play with us!

393
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,875
Why does she know
who I am, anyway?

394
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,500
She's gotten way smaller, huh?

395
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,541
Is she less scary now?

396
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,166
[WENDY and NATSU yell]

397

[AQUARIUS laughs]

398
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,333
[NATSU] Hey! Watch
where you're aiming!

399
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,750
[WENDY] Ah!

400

[ferris wheel groans]

402

Listen to that, it sounds
like the Ferris wheel's

403
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,333
about to fall apart!

404
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,166
Well, is there something
we can do to stop it?

405
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,750
To be honest,

406
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,041
I think our best shot is to jump
off of it while we still can!

407
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,583
You can't be serious.

408
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,875
[CARLA] Happy! Take Wendy
and Natsu to the ground

409
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,083
for me, okay?

410
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,416
No way, I am not going
to leave you behind!

411
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,791
Also, I'm still weak from
that fight with Loke.

412
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,833
I can barely even keep
myself in the air.

413
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,583
Sheesh, you're even more
useless than usual.

It's shaking!

All right, guess we'll
have to wing it!

Excuse me, Aquarius?

[CARLA] Now you're
being too nice.

427
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,875
This place isn't safe anymore,
so we're going to leave.

428
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,500
I think that you
should come with us!

429
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,333
Stop being such
a spoilsport.

430
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:20,750
I want to keep on playing!

431
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,833
This thing's on its
last leg, Aquarius.

before it crushes you!

going to fall down!

Isn't that exciting?

436

this the hard way!

you're a meanie.

From the things Lucy
told me about you,

I thought that you'd
be really scary.

you were too beat-up to fly?!

480
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,625
You got to fight through the
pain to save the ones you love.

481
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:27,458
[HAPPY] You gotta fight
through the pain

482
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:28,833
to save the ones you love...

483
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,958
Yes, I suppose that's true...

484
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,291
[NATSU] You couldn't
get me after?! Aaahh!

485
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,750
[crashing sound]

486
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,000
[NATSU]
I... I don't believe it...

487
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,416
How could you forget me...?

488
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:43,833
Good job!

489
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,958
Thanks again for saving me!

490
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,125
That would've hurt!

491
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,791
Oh no, you're
all dirty now.

492
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,375
Like I care, I just want
to go out and have fun!

493
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:54,750
Let's do this again, just with
less danger and more ice cream.

494
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,625
Okay, but can my games
really be that dangerous?

495
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,708
Yeah, they're
extremely dangerous.

496
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,541
And not just for
the people around you,

497
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,166
you nearly hurt yourself bad.

498
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,916
Yeah. I'll try to be careful.

499
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,750
We will play again
someday, won't we?

500
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,791
But maybe we should
play cards instead.

501
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,166
[AQUARIUS giggles]

502
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,041
I had fun, thanks!

503
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,750
You're welcome.
Thank you!

504
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:14,958
[NATSU groans]

505
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,666
Well look at that:
they made up again.

506
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,416
You've been here for a long time
now, do you want to go home?

507
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,291
Yeah. Think I'm ready.

508
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,791
Remember, we're
double scoop friends.

509
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:28,791
How could I forget?
I'll see you later, Wendy.

510
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,083
[WENDY sighs]

511
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,208
[CARLA] Well, that's one
mission accomplished.

512
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,791
Now if someone would stop
slacking off in his crater,

513
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:38,916
we could get moving.

514
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,083
Don't start with me,
you dirty traitor!

515
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:14,833
[HAPPY]
Standby Sequence!

516
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,583
I play twenty field cards!

517
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:18,458
[NATSU] Uh, what're you
going on about, man?

518
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:19,583
[HAPPY]
Don't you know?

519
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,208
There's a whole new
battle card game!

520
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:22,166
It's a craze!

521
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,375
[NATSU] Huh.
Sounds cool to me.

522
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:24,291
What're the rules?

523
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,625
[HAPPY] Don't be
ridiculous, man!

524
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,875
It's a battle card game.
Why would there be rules?

525
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:29,291
[NATSU]
So you know how to play?

526
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:30,916
[HAPPY] If you let a rulebook
tell you how to play,

527
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,625
then you'll never
develop your own style.

528
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:34,166
Oh! It's my turn!

529
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,125
[NATSU and HAPPY] Next Time:
Guild Deck vs. Celestial Deck.

530
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:38,958
[HAPPY] Guild Battle Standby!

531
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:41,666
[NATSU] Okay, but seriously.
How do you play?
