1
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:28,041
[WENDY] Thanks.

2
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,458
I needed a haircut.

3
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,000
[LUCY] Well, I'm glad to help!

4
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:33,041
I don't have the scissor
skills of Cancer.

5
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:36,208
But it doesn't take much to
make you look super cute.

6
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,041
[WENDY]
Aw.

7
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,541
That's sweet of you to say.

8
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,750
You made an absolutely
perfect afternoon like this,

9
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,166
feel even better!

10
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,333
[LUCY] Yeah, today is
pretty darn perfect, isn't it?

11
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:46,833
So quiet and peaceful!

12
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:49,375
[CARLA] We'd better soak
it all in while we can,

13
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,541
because peace never
lasts long in this guild.

14
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:54,791
[LUCY] C'mon,
we're not that bad.

15
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:01,291
[NATSU]
Hey!

16
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:02,791
[CARLA] You see?

17
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:05,333
[LUCY] Now, things still are
peaceful around here, Carla.

18
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,125
At least for the moment.

19
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,416
[snoring]

20
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,791
Happy.

21
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,041
No slacking!

22
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,000
Fish?

23
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,625
No, it's just you.

24
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,375
What do you
mean it's "just me"?

25
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,916
Oh don't be
so sensitive.

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,958
I was just having
the most amazing dream

27
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,541
about a super
humongous fish buffet

28
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,750
that went on as far
as the eye could see.

29
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,166
I think I'm gonna
go back to it.

30
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,708
No way!

31
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,458
What's the big deal, man?

32
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,458
[NATSU "The big deal" is


33
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,583
you're supposed
to be my partner!

34
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:10,791
 Yeah, so?

35
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,000
Well, don't you see

36
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,916
that I'm doing all this
yard work over here?

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,500
Not laying around?

38
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:16,916
It is your turn.

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,166
Why should I care?

40
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,791
Because your partner
is working his tail off,

41
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,875
while you're dreaming
about stuffing your face!

42
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,625
That is so not cool!

43
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,666
[LUCY] Those guys
are so immature.

44
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,500
My, don't you
catch on quickly?

45
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:31,916
We're partners on
missions and stuff.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,750
But stupid yard work is
a completely different thing.

47
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,208
What in the heck is the
matter with you, Happy?

48
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,083
How could you be so cold?

49
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,208
Oh please,
I am not cold.

50
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,541
No way!

51
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,375
'Cause, it's way
too nice today!

52
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:45,625
It's so warm and
sunshiney out here!

53
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,541
[GRAY] So what are
you two idiots

54
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:48,750
flapping your gums
about this time?

55
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,250
The work would
go a lot faster

56
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,750
if you didn't stop to
complain about it.

57
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,291
Who asked you, frostbite?

58
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,541
And for the record, I'm not
complaining about cleaning up.

59
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,791
I'm just sayin' that
cat should help!

60
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,916
[HAPPY] Are you enjoying
this nice weather, Carla?

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,458
[CARLA] Indeed I am.

62
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,333
[NATSU] You can't just walk
away while I'm talkin' to you!

63
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,916
[MAX] Whaddaya know.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,916
It's been seven whole years and
Natsu hasn't changed one bit.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,375
Still a brat.

66
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,208
[HAPPY] What, are
you surprised?

67
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,541
He's been that way
practically his entire life!

68
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,166
[NATSU] Are you tryin' to
say that you've changed?

69
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,750
I mean, obviously besides
getting older and stuff.

70
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:17,750
[MAX] Yeah.

71
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,041
I've gotten older
on the outside,

72
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,208
but I still feel pretty
young on the inside.

73
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,541
[GRAY] So what you're
trying to tell us

74
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,791
is that you're basically
just an immature old fart?

75
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,375
[MAX] If you want me to show
you my new skills, you're on!

76
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,416
[NATSU] Ha!

77
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,666
Bring it, ya'
dusty ol' geezer!

78
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,958
Let's throw
down right here!

79
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,166
Thought you'd
never ask!

80
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,541
[LUCY] Hey, wait!

81
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,250
You two are gonna
fight right now?

82
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,666
[GRAY] Sounds
like a plan to me.

83
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,083
It's perfect weather

84
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,708
for a little outdoor sparring
match, dontcha think?

85
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:41,625
Yeah!

86
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,500
Now I've got a fire in my belly!

87
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,375
[HAPPY] 
And So We Aim for the Top!

88
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,583
Let's rock!

89
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:02,958
What?

90
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,250
Are you kiddin' me?

91
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,083
Do you seriously think
that we just sat around

92
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,625
and did nothing the whole
time you guys were gone?

93
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,791
We've all been working
on our fighting chops.

94
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,166
[WENDY]
I don't believe it.

95
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,000
[LUCY] Natsu is getting
schooled by Max?

96
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,833
[NATSU] Well it
ain't over yet, pal!

97
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,375
Sand Rebellion!

98
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,416
Now you're just
pissing me off!

99
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:29,750
[CARLA]
Do you mind?

100
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,041
Teach him
a lesson, Natsu!

101
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,958
Weren't you just arguing
with him a minute ago?

102
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,000
This has nothing
to do with all that!

103
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,875
Fire Dragon Iron Fist!

104
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,666
Sand Wall!

105
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,750
I'm a whole lot stronger
than I used to be!

106
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,125
[VIJEETER] Max is
beating Natsu.

107
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,541
That is so crazy.

108
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:53,916
[WARREN] I never
thought I'd see the day.

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,875
Maybe this means that
we could beat him, too!

110
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,541
[NATSU] Lightning Flame
Dragon mode!

111
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,291
Holy cow!

112
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,416
Whoa!

113
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,958
I don't think
I'm ready for this.

114
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:17,458
Lightning
Flame Dragon Roar!

115
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,125
Oh wow!

116
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,625
Aw man!

117
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,958
I thought that would be like
a hundred times stronger!

118
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,166
[LUCY] When did
you figure out

119
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,333
you could use
that technique?

120
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:38,541
[NATSU] Just now.

121
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:39,916
That's awesome.

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
[MAX] Well...
That's it for me.

123
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,250
I give up, man.

124
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,333
Really wasn't planning
on getting killed today.

125
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,333
Which one of you
is next in line?

126
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,666
[WARREN] I'm good,
thanks though!

127
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,166
[VIJEETER]
Yeah, you win!

128
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:56,041
It makes sense that
an attack like that

129
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:59,250
would use up a lot of power.

130
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,708
You should probably
practice a bit more

131
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,708
before you pull that
one out in a real fight.

132
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,166
I never knew you were
such a good fighter, Max.

133
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,083
Thanks, but obviously I
still have a long way to go.

134
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,583
If everybody in the guild has
gotten that much more powerful, 

135
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:11,833
why is it that you
let Twilight Ogre

136
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,041
bully you around
for so long?

137
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,333
It's a little bit more
complicated than that.

138
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,833
It was more of
a problem with cash flow.

139
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,208
You don't expect
us to settle our debts

140
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,041
with brute force,
do you?

141
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,750
But that's kinda how
master settled them, right?

142
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,083
Oh yeah.

143
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,625
[GRAY] Listen up, guys.

144
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,333
I'm afraid the guild has got
a serious problem on our hands.

145
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,541
What do you mean by that?

146
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,750
Gildarts and Laxus
are still powerhouses,

147
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,833
but no one else has
kept up strength-wise.

148
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,541
A lot of us were
asleep for seven years

149
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,583
while everyone
here was training.

150
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:41,750
Yeah, you've
got a point.

151
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,250
I mean, Natsu
came really close

152
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,958
to getting shown up
by Max, of all people.

153
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,958
You're right, and
he's really weak.

154
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:50,375
At least she was nice
enough not to say it to my face.

155
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,708
I wonder if
anyone knows a way

156
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,708
for us to give our magic
power a super fast boost.

157
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,625
Huh.

158
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,208
[PORLYUSICA] Scram!

159
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,250
Sorry to bother you,
ma'am.

160
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:13,250
But we were wondering

161
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,125
if you had any potions
that could help us.

162
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,666
Like maybe something that

163
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,916
can make us all a
million times stronger?

164
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,791
There's probably no
way it'd be that easy.

165
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,083
What's the
matter, child?

166
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,416
You seem upset.

167
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:30,708
[PORLYUSICA] You know
I hate people, so get lost!

168
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,958
Shoo! Shoo!

169
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,291
I've had enough
brooms already!

170
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,416
Sorry to bother you!

171
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,250
Why does she hate us?

172
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,416
Is it 'cause she and
Gramps used to date?

173
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,291
We weren't a couple,
you fool!

174
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,958
[MAKAROV] 
The time has come, kids!

175
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,625
I've done all I can in
service to this guild.

176
00:08:56,708 --> 00:09:01,208
Allow me to introduce
Fairy Tail's next master.

177
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,458
[CANA] You're really
stepping down?

178
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:03,625
[MACAO]
I'm honored.

179
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,583
And I'll do
my absolute best.

180
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,416
[WAKABA] It ain't
you, ya dimwit.

181
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,041
[MAKAROV] Without further ado,
the fifth master of Fairy Tail

182
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,833
Gildarts Clive!

183
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,333
Where the hell is Gildarts?

184
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,000
[MIRAJANE] I'm not sure,
but he left us a note.

185
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,583
[GILDARTS] "To Makarov
and all of my Fairy Tail family.

186
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:32,875
I'm sorry. Being master of
the guild just ain't my style."

187
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,750
[MAKAROV]
What?

188
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,875
[GILDARTS] "But, since I
have the rare opportunity

189
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,333
to be in charge for a bit,

190
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:42,000
there are two things I
want to get done."

191
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,000
[GILDARTS] "First, I
hereby reinstate Laxus

192
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,041
as a member
of Fairy Tail."

193
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,708
[MAKAROV]
He's got some kinda nerve.

194
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,375
[LAXUS] 
No way.

195
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,875
[BIXLOW] Welcome back
to the fold, old buddy!

196
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,875
[EVERGREEN]
This is wonderful!

197
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,000
The Thunder Legion is back!

198
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,208
[LAXUS]
Yeah, that's true.

199
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,375
I guess.

200
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,125
[FRIED] Thank you, Gildarts.

201
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,666
This is a blessed day!

202
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:12,583
[MAKAROV] Well, if that is the
master's wish, then so be it.

203
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,791
[GILDARTS]
"And second...

204
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:19,333
I hereby appoint Makarov Dreyar
as Fairy Tail's sixth master."

205
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,041
[MAKAROV] But I just retired!

206
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,125
[ALZACK] I guess you could say
things have come full circle.

207
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,541
[BISCA]
It works for me!

208
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,458
[ASCA] Old mustache
man's in charge!

209
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,708
[BISCA] And that's a very
good thing for us, sweetheart.

210
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:34,250
[GILDARTS] "It's time for
me to hit the road again.

211
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,583
But don't worry.

212
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,750
I'll come back around
when the mood strikes me.

213
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:38,958
Take care, everybody." 

214
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,083
[MIRAJANE]
And this is for you.

215
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,291
[GILDARTS]
"To my dear Cana.

216
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,875
I'm sure you probably
think I'm being selfish.

217
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,125
And maybe you're right.

218
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:06,875
But if you ever need me, just
use this card to get in touch.

219
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:12,000
I'll come running back as
fast as I can, I promise."

220
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,541
[CANA] Are you
freakin' kidding me?

221
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,041
[ERZA] Cana!

222
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,416
[CANA] I told you I'm just
fine with the way things were.

223
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,500
Ya deadbeat dad!

224
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,333
[GILDARTS] "Fairy Tail will
always be my true home,

225
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,458
that will never change.

226
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,125
And I believe
with all my heart,

227
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,083
that we'll be the
number one guild in Fiore

228
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:31,583
by the time I return.

229
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,833
But getting us back on top
isn't my responsibility.

230
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,000
It's up to you guys.

231
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:42,583
Makarov. That will be
your final task as master.

232
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,083
I'm counting on you
to bring Fairy Tail

233
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:50,333
back to its former glory."

234
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:53,458
What does that lumbering
fool mean my "final task"?

235
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,166
After the stunt he pulled, I'll
never let anyone else be master!

236
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:01,500
I'll be this damn guild's
master til the day I die!

237
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,875
Somebody pour me a
drink! That's an order!

238
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,291
[MIRAJANE]
Of course, sir!

239
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,541
[WAKABA] He'll be in
a rotten mood for a while.

240
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,916
[MACAO] Well, at least
we got all that settled.

241
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,916
[ELFMAN]
What a man!

242
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,958
[MAX]
Wow, Elfman.

243
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,500
Who would've
guessed you'd say that?

244
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,541
[GILDARTS]
"And master...

245
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,666
I won't tell anyone about what's
down in the basement.

246
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,416
You have my word."

247
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,583
[MAKAROV] You'd
better not, bonehead.

248
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,375
[LUCY] Hey, whose
brilliant idea was it

249
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,416
to visit Porlyusica
in the first place?

250
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,791
[HAPPY] 
Yours, genius.

251
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,416
[GRAY] And she's usually
so sweet and charming.

252
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,541
[CARLA] I'd always heard
she wasn't fond of people,

253
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:39,708
but I never expected all that.

254
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:43,166
[HAPPY] Apparently, she's
not too keen on cats either.

255
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,000
[GRAY] Why are
you crying, Wendy?

256
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,375
Did that old lady
scare you?

257
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:50,083
[LUCY] Hey!

258
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,416
It's gonna be okay.

259
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,916
[NATSU] That witch
made Wendy cry?

260
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,208
She'll pay for that!

261
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,250
[WENDY] It's not like that.

262
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,541
She's just so familiar.

263
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:01,458
[NATSU] What?

264
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,333
[CARLA] Have you two met before?

265
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:07,416
[WENDY] I don't really know
how to explain it, exactly.

266
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,125
It sounds strange
but it's the truth.

267
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,125
Her voice and her scent.

268
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:16,375
They're so much like Grandine's.

269
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,791
[WARREN] Gildarts
is out of his mind.

270
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,291
He thinks we can be
Fiore's number one guild?

271
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,416
[MAX] It's gonna
take a miracle

272
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,916
to make something
like that happen.

273
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,916
[ERZA] I don't
think it's impossible.

274
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,291
Besides, we should
rise to the challenge.

275
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,750
[WARREN] That's
a pretty tall order.

276
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:35,750
[MAX] Yeah.

277
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,541
Things are
different these days.

278
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,416
[ALZACK] Sabertooth
would be tough to beat.

279
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,333
[BISCA] Not to mention
that even the Lamia Scale

280
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,583
and Blue Pegasus
guilds have gotten

281
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,208
way more powerful in
the past seven years.

282
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,916
[ASCA] All of them
are super awesome!

283
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,208
[VIJEETER] We are a lot
better off now that

284
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,041
we have some of our major
players back in action.

285
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,625
[LAKI] But the fact of
the matter is you guys

286
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,208
are still seven years
behind everybody else.

287
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,291
[JET] [DROY]
Don't worry Levy,

288
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:59,125
you'll always be
number one in our book!

289
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,250
[MACAO]
You gotta admit,

290
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,750
that's a substantial
training gap.

291
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,458
[WAKABA] Whether you're talking
about individual strength,

292
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:04,625
or even the guild's
overall power,

293
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,625
we still have
a long way to go.

294
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,166
[ERZA] I see your point.

295
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,250
Seems it'll take a
good amount of time

296
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:12,291
and training to
reclaim our standing.

297
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,458
[ROMEO] I waited for you
guys for seven whole years!

298
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:17,125
I'm sick and tired of waiting
for something to happen!

299
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,708
[MACAO] Romeo!

300
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,458
[ROMEO] There's totally a way
for us to be number one again.

301
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:21,791
You all know what it is!

302
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:22,750
[WARREN] What?

303
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,708
[NAB] No way, kid.

304
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,000
[MAX] Come on.

305
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,208
[MACAO] No!

306
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,625
Didn't I tell
you we would never

307
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,250
take part in
that thing again?

308
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,666
[MAKAROV] And what might this
"thing" be, Fourth Master?

309
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,833
[MACAO] I'd appreciate it

310
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,916
if you didn't call
me that, Sixth Master.

311
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,291
[GRAY] Are you tryin' to
tell us she's Grandine?

312
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,583
[LUCY] How could
a regular person

313
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,666
have the same voice
and scent as a dragon?

314
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,416
Is that really
even possible?

315
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,000
I haven't the foggiest.

316
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,583
Yeah, Wendy.
Whaddaya mean?

317
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,833
I don't know.

318
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:57,250
But she's so familiar.

319
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,291
It's confusing.

320
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:02,125
She sounds and smells
exactly like my mother,

321
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,416
the Sky Dragon Grandine.

322
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,750
[NATSU] I say we go back there
and ask her what's goin' on.

323
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:07,875
[GRAY] Wait, Natsu.

324
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,791
If she's the human
version of Grandine,

325
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,541
there are a few things
that don't add up.

326
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,500
Just think about
it for a second.

327
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,666
[LUCY] Well, first of all,
both of your dragons

328
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,333
vanished without
a trace at the same time.

329
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,416
And don't forget, the dragon
that raised Gajeel

330
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,375
also disappeared
on the exact same day.

331
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:24,458
[LUCY] All in the year 777,
which was fourteen years ago.

332
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,916
But Master Makarov has known
Porlyusica way longer than that.

333
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,166
They were friends back when
they were both fairly young.

334
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:34,625
So that means she and Grandine
were around at the same time.

335
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,166
It just doesn't add up.

336
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,583
I wish it could be true, 

337
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:41,416
but there's no way that
they could be one and the same.

338
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,125
[GRAY] I guess
that counts out

339
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,916
any kind of reincarnation
or transformation.

340
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,041
Yeah.

341
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,041
[WENDY] Y'know, when you stop
and explain it all like that,

342
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,083
it really doesn't
make any sense.

343
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,291
Besides her voice
and the way she smells,

344
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:57,541
her attitude is
completely different.

345
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,291
[CARLA] From all the stories
that you've told me,

346
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,208
your dragon was actually
quite kind to people.

347
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,416
Wait a second.

348
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,541
Ya think maybe it's
because she hates cats?

349
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:06,916
[WENDY] Grandine was nice.

350
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,500
She didn't hate anybody.

351
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:09,583
[GRAY] Sorry, but
it's kinda hard for me

352
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,333
to picture a nice dragon.

353
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,958
Especially after
our run-in with Acnologia.

354
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,458
Igneel was
usually pretty nice!

355
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,916
[PORLYUSICA] I'm sorry if
my attitude offends you!

356
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,125
[LUCY] Ms. Porlyusica!

357
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,166
[GRAY] You scared
the crap outta me.

358
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,750
[PORLYUSICA] There's really
no use in hiding it anymore,

359
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:35,000
so I might as well
tell you my big secret.

360
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,791
[PORLYUSICA] I know it's
not what you want to hear,

361
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,250
but I'm not the
dragon that you seek.

362
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:43,083
I'm just a human being,
same as you.

363
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:47,250
[NATSU] But why do you
hate humans so much?

364
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,791
[PORLYUSICA] Because they
ask too many stupid questions!

365
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,375
Sorry.

366
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:54,333
I'm afraid that I can't tell
you where your dragon is.

367
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,125
I simply don't know.

368
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,416
The fact of the matter is,

369
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:02,333
we have no direct
connection whatsoever.

370
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,416
[LUCY] Then how do you
explain your similarities?

371
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,625
[PORLYUSICA]
You're familiar with

372
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,916
the alternate world
of Edolas, are you not?

373
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,250
Rumor has it that
you've been there.

374
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,583
I've heard that you even
met your counterparts.

375
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,916
Saw how our worlds correlate.

376
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,500
[GRAY] How do you
know about Edolas?

377
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:18,708
[LUCY] I think I get it.

378
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,291
[NATSU] Wait. Hold on.

379
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,000
[CARLA] Oh my.

380
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,791
[PORLYUSICA] Every living
being in Earth Land

381
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,041
has a counterpart
there, including dragons.

382
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,416
So one could argue

383
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,375
that I am the Edolas version
of your friend Grandine.

384
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,083
I am not from this world.

385
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,916
But I found myself here
several decades ago.

386
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,750
[EVERYONE] What?

387
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,458
You're the Edolas Grandine?

388
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:42,291
[HAPPY] Like a human
version of a dragon?

389
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,250
[PORLYUSICA] I was
disoriented when I arrived

390
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:47,000
but Makarov
came to my aid.

391
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,458
The peacefulness and beauty
that I discovered here

392
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,458
quickly endeared me
to Earth Land.

393
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,666
So even though I had
several opportunities

394
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,375
to return to Edolas.

395
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:59,208
I had made the decision to
call your world my new home.

396
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,291
[NATSU] Does this mean
that Igneel and Metallicana

397
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,541
have human versions
back in Edolas, too?

398
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,666
Maybe they crossed over
just like you did!

399
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,916
[PORLYUSICA] I have no idea.

400
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,375
I've never encountered them.

401
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:13,083
However, I did have the chance
to speak with the Sky Dragon.

402
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,625
[WENDY] Huh?

403
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,833
[PORLYUSICA] Although we didn't
meet in a traditional sense.

404
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,333
It was more mysterious.

405
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:21,708
She spoke directly into my mind,
by way of telepathy.

406
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,583
You originally came here seeking
out a means to gain power.

407
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:27,750
I may be able to help
Wendy in that regard.

408
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,958
But only her.

409
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:34,458
The Sky Dragon dictated this
book of spells to me.

410
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,583
It contains, among other
things, the Sky Dragon spells

411
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:41,250
"Milky Way" and
"Shattering Light: Sky Drill".

412
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,291
Two Dragon Slayer secret arts

413
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:45,541
she never got a
chance to teach you.

414
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,000
[WENDY] I don't
know what to say.

415
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,875
Grandine really did this?

416
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:54,250
She asked me to give it to you
should you ever come to visit.

417
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,291
Those are powerful spells.

418
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:59,208
Extremely dangerous.

419
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:03,541
So be sure to
exercise great caution.

420
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:08,916
[WENDY] Thank you so
much, Ms. Porlyusica!

421
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,125
[WENDY] Ms. Grandine!

422
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:22,958
[ROMEO] We're gonna
do it this time.

423
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,958
You're not the
master anymore, dad!

424
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,041
[MACAO] Well neither are
you, you little rug-rat!

425
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,666
[MACAO] I absolutely
forbid it!

426
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,166
We're never gonna get involved
with that thing again, ya hear?

427
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,875
[NATSU] Yo guys,
we're home!

428
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:33,833
[MAX] Hey.

429
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,208
So how did it go?

430
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,125
Did you guys pick up
anything worthwhile?

431
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,791
[LUCY] Well, Wendy
sure did.

432
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:42,916
[ROMEO] You don't make the rules
anymore, so just get over it!

433
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,416
It's up to Makarov.

434
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,833
[MACAO] I'm expressing myself
as a member of the guild!

435
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,333
[GRAY] What's all the
fuss about this time?

436
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,458
[CARLA] Seems like typical
teenage rebellion to me.

437
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:52,666
Clothing, Gray!

438
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,458
[MACAO] Those of you
with me, say Aye!

439
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,541
[EVERYONE]
Aye!

440
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,750
I don't ever wanna go
through that crap again.

441
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:00,958
[BISCA] That has got to be

442
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,458
the most embarrassing
thing in the world.

443
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:05,000
[ROMEO] But we've got the
Tenrou Team with us this time!

444
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,250
Natsu and Erza and
all those guys!

445
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,708
There's no way we're gonna
lose with them on our side!

446
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,166
[WARREN] Haven't you
been paying attention?

447
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,125
They all missed out on
seven years of training!

448
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:16,583
[DROY] You're awesome Levy,
don't listen to those jerks.

449
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,375
[NATSU] So what exactly
are we talking

450
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,125
about doing or not doing
here anyway?

451
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,333
[ROMEO] While you guys were
all stuck on Tenrou Island,

452
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:23,458
a tournament started

453
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,083
to determine Fiore's
number one guild.

454
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,333
[HAPPY] Ooh!

455
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:27,958
[NATSU] Sounds like a
whole lotta fun to me!

456
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,416
[ROMEO] Guilds from all
over the country

457
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,875
face off against each
other in magic events.

458
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,125
[ROMEO] They call it.

459
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:36,125
The Grand Magic Games!

460
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,125
[NATSU] Oh yeah!

461
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,791
[LUCY] That sounds
totally amazing!

462
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,791
[WENDY] Yeah, I'd love
to play some games!

463
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,791
[GRAY] So it's more like
a kind of magic festival?

464
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,291
[ERZA] I understand.

465
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,750
Sabertooth is known as the
top guild in Fiore these days

466
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,041
because they won
the last go-round.

467
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,625
[ROMEO] That's right.

468
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,958
But if we can beat them and
win the games this time,

469
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,041
we'll be number
one instead!

470
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:55,916
[EVERYONE] Oh!

471
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,875
[MAKAROV] That would be nice.

472
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,291
But I'm not
entirely convinced

473
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:02,250
we could win given our
current state of disarray.

474
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,041
[MACAO] That's my
point exactly!

475
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,375
[ROMEO] Yeah, but if we do
win, the guild will get, like,

476
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,833
thirty million jewel
in prize money!

477
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,208
[MAKAROV] We're in!

478
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,583
[MACAO] Seriously?

479
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:14,000
[DROY] But master, it's
gonna be really hard!

480
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,458
[WARREN] There are tons
of powerful guilds

481
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,083
that compete each year.

482
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,666
[JET] And don't forget
that we've come in

483
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,916
dead freakin' last every single
time we've entered.

484
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,166
[ELFMAN] That is just pitiful.

485
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,041
[MAKAROV] Well this year
we'll just have to beat

486
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,750
all those other guilds to
a pulp!

487
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,833
[NATSU] Sabertooth thinks
they're hot stuff?

488
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,375
We'll just see about that!

489
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,750
[JET] Put a cork
in it!

490
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,583
[NATSU] So when does this
thing go down, anyway?

491
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,375
[ROMEO] It kicks off
in three months!

492
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,166
[NATSU] That's
plenty of time!

493
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,000
But we have to start
training ASAP.

494
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,708
We'll put Fairy Tail
back on top.

495
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,458
And nobody's gonna get
in our way!

496
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:44,791
[GRAY] Let's go!

497
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,375
[LUCY] Yeah!

498
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,416
And if all of us start
working together as a guild.

499
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,416
[ERZA] There will be no
stopping us.

500
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,958
[WENDY] I'd better start
studying these new spells

501
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,958
Grandine wanted me
to learn, huh?

502
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,208
[HAPPY] It's about time we
got a chance to cut loose!

503
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,875
[CARLA] It seems like this guild
is always looking to party.

504
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,750
[ELFMAN] Fight party!

505
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,583
This is gonna be
so freaking manly!

506
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,166
[CANA] Gildarts may
get his wish.

507
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,125
We could be the top dogs
in Fiore again very soon.

508
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,833
[DROY] This is gonna suck.

509
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:11,250
[JET] Please tell
me you're joking.

510
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,750
[LEVY] Come on guys,
where's your team spirit?

511
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:14,625
[ALZACK] Um.

512
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,041
This is really not a good idea.

513
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,583
[BISCA] I don't think
you guys understand;

514
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,916
the games are not your typical
kind of fighting tournament.

515
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,875
[NATSU] Huh?

516
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,166
What do you mean by that?

517
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,791
[WARREN] It's absolute hell.

518
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,708
[MAKAROV] Now the final
decision has been made,

519
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:28,958
there's no need for all
this moaning and groaning!

520
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,291
So let's get to work!

521
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:32,458
Let's win that thirty
million jewel,

522
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:34,625
and the title of Fiore's
number one guild!

523
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:35,958
Fairy Tail is entering the
Grand Magic Games

524
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:38,750
and aiming for the top!

525
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,625
[EVERYONE] 
Yeah!

526
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:14,875
[NATSU] We are going on
a mega training vacation

527
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:17,416
at the beach, and the
Celestial Spirit World!

528
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,250
[HAPPY] This is
gonna be so awesome!

529
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,500
I can't believe we're actually

530
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,500
gettin' to go to a
party in the sky!

531
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,041
[NATSU] We'll get to
hang out with the cow,

532
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:26,041
the crab, and the fluffy
chick, on their own turf.

533
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:26,875
[HAPPY] I bet there'll
be some Spirits

534
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,291
we've never even met before.

535
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,666
And like, a ton of
Plues everywhere!

536
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,125
[NATSU] [HAPPY] Next time: Song
of the Stars!

537
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:35,458
Hey Natsu, can you help me?

538
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,541
There's a creepy plue stuck
to me and it won't let go!

539
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:40,791
[NATSU] Aw, is he
your new best buddy?
