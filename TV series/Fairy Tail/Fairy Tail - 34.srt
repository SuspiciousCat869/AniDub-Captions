1
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,833
- HEY GUYS, READY FOR 
SOME MORE FAIRY TAIL?

2
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:21,708
JUST MAKE SURE
THAT WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,250
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE ROOM.

4
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:26,458
AND DON'T SIT
TOO CLOSE TO THE TV.

5
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:31,375
- Erza: PREVIOUSLY,
ON FAIRY TAIL.

6
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,583
- WHERE IS ERZA?

7
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,750
- Gray: WE WERE ENJOYING
A LITTLE GAMING AT THE CASINO

8
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:38,500
DURING OUR STAY
AT THE AKANE RESORT,

9
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,958
WHEN SOME OLD FRIENDS
OF ERZA'S SHOWED UP.

10
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,708
- SISTER, IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

11
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:46,666
AND THAT'S WHEN
THE TROUBLE BEGAN.

12
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,208
- Org: ARE YOU SAYING
THAT IT STILL EXISTS?

13
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,833
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

14
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,250
- Leiji: ABOUT A DECADE AGO,

15
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,708
CONSTRUCTION BEGAN
ON THE R-SYSTEM,

16
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,791
A STRUCTURE DESIGNED BY
A CULT OF BLACK MAGIC USERS.

17
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,250
- Michello: BUT WE HAD ALL SEVEN
OF THOSE TOWERS DESTROYED.

18
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:35,083
THERE SHOULDN'T EVEN
BE ANY RUINS LEFT.

19
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,833
- EVIDENTLY THERE
WAS AN EIGHTH TOWER

20
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,250
THAT WE MISSED IN THE
WATERS NEAR KAH ELM.

21
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:42,625
- HOW DID WE MISS IT? IS THE
STRUCTURE CLOSE TO COMPLETION?

22
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:45,375
- I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW.
OUR TEAM MYSTERIOUSLY

23
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:48,041
WENT MISSING AFTER
SENDING THESE IMAGES.

24
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,958
- WELL, IT LOOKS FINISHED TO ME.

25
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:54,041
- BUT WHY WOULD THEY REVIVE THE
R-SYSTEM AFTER ALL THIS TIME?

26
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:57,958
- THE TOWER OF HEAVEN.
IT'S NOT THE R-SYSTEM.

27
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,958
IT'S THE TOWER OF HEAVEN,
TO BE CLEAR.

28
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,166
- IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE
WHAT IT'S CALLED.

29
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,291
IT UTILIZES FORBIDDEN MAGIC.

30
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:08,583
THERE WOULD BE CHAOS IF WORD
GOT OUT THAT IT EVEN EXISTED.

31
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,541
- WE'LL HAVE TO FIND
A WAY TO SUBDUE THEM.

32
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,958
I SUGGEST WE DISPATCH
THE MILITARY.

33
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,750
- THAT'S NOT AN OPTION.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

34
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,375
- WE'D BE PUTTING
OUR SOLDIERS IN DANGER

35
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,833
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW
WHO WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE.

36
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,750
ACCORDING TO OUR
LATEST INTELLIGENCE,

37
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,916
THE BLACK MAGIC CULT
THOUGHT TO BE RESPONSIBLE

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,291
FOR THE R-SYSTEM IS NO
LONGER OCCUPYING THE TOWER.

39
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,333
- Michello: THEY'RE NOT?
JUST WHO IS THEN?

40
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:31,666
- IT'S A GROUP OF WIZARDS

41
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,833
APPARENTLY LED BY A
MAN NAMED JELLAL.

42
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,416
- JELLAL?

43
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,916
- BUT THAT'S THE NAME OF YOUR
TWIN BROTHER. RIGHT, SIEGRAIN?

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,833
- YES. UNFORTUNATELY.
THAT WOULD BE HIM.

45
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,875
- Happy: JELLAL.

46
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,666
- ( birds cawing )

47
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,875
- Lucy: I'M WORRIED ABOUT
THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE

48
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,458
STUCK IN THE CARDS.

49
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,000
YOU THINK THEY'RE OKAY?

50
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,791
- Gray: WE LET THE MILITARY
KNOW ABOUT THEM BEFORE WE LEFT

51
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,000
SO I'M SURE THEY'LL BE FINE.

52
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,875
- I HOPE SO.

53
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,958
- WAIT A MINUTE,
WHERE IN THE HECK, ARE WE?

54
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,083
- Juvia: I DON'T KNOW.

55
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,208
WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING
SALAMANDER'S LEAD.

56
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,041
- NATSU, ARE YOU SURE WE'RE
GOING THE RIGHT DIRECTION?

57
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,250
- ( retching )

58
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,291
- MAN, WE'RE RELYING ON
YOUR SENSE OF SMELL.

59
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,375
PULL IT TOGETHER.

60
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,791
- HOW DARE YOU
DISAPPOINT MY LOVE

61
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,458
WITH YOUR CHILDISH ACTIONS.

62
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,958
- GEEZ.

63
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,208
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW EASILY
THEY WERE ABLE TO KNOCK US OUT

64
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,208
AND KIDNAP ERZA AND
HAPPY. WE'RE PATHETIC.

65
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,875
- IN OUR DEFENSE, THEY MUST'VE
BEEN POWERFUL WIZARDS

66
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,625
TO BEAT ONE AS STRONG AS ERZA.

67
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,791
- WHAT? THEY DIDN'T BEAT HER.

68
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,375
QUIT TALKING LIKE YOU
KNOW HER 'CAUSE YOU DON'T.

69
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,041
- Juvia: ( sobbing )
UH, I'M SORRY.

70
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:40,000
- Lucy: CALM DOWN.
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

71
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,625
THOSE GOONS THAT
ATTACKED US SAID

72
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:45,583
THEY WERE OLD FRIENDS OF
ERZA'S. WHICH MAKES ME WONDER

73
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:49,250
IF WE KNOW HER ANY
BETTER THAN JUVIA DOES.

74
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,708
- WHAT THE... I JUST
GOT A WEIRD FEELING.

75
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:59,583
- ( cawing )

76
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:04,541
- THE BIRDS.
- WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM?

77
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,958
NOT THE FISH TOO.

78
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,083
- Juvia: I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

79
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,916
- THAT'S WRECKAGE FROM
A FIORE NAVAL SHIP.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,083
- Lucy: OKAY, I'M CREEPED OUT.

81
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,958
- HEY, WHAT'S THAT?

82
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,875
- Lucy: IT MUST BE
THE TOWER OF HEAVEN.

83
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,833
- I'LL PROTECT US.

84
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,416
MY WATER DOME WILL KEEP US
FROM BEING SEEN.

85
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,916
- Lucy: NICE WORK, JUVIA.

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,666
- ( gasps )

87
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,416
THE TOWER OF HEAVEN.
IT'S BEEN COMPLETED?

88
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,916
- Sho: I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU'RE SO SURPRISED.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,791
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT SINCE
YOU LEFT ALMOST TEN YEARS AGO.

90
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,666
- HAS IT BEEN THAT LONG?

91
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,750
IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH
YOU'VE ALL CHANGED.

92
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,833
- Natsu: I CAN'T TAKE IT.
- Lucy: CHILL OUT,

93
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,041
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

94
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,666
- Gray: THAT'S IT. NEXT TIME
WE GO SOMEWHERE,

95
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,333
WE'RE KNOCKING HIM OUT FIRST.

96
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,875
- Sho: THE CEREMONY WILL
TAKE PLACE LATER TONIGHT.

97
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,083
YOU'LL BE STAYING
HERE UNTIL THEN.

98
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:03,166
- CEREMONY? THEY'RE GOING
TO ACTIVATE THE R-SYSTEM?

99
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,208
- I'M SORRY, BUT THIS
IS THE PRICE OF BETRAYAL.

100
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,583
AND ALTHOUGH
YOU'VE HURT HIM,

101
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,833
JELLAL'S GIVEN YOU
A SPECIAL HONOR.

102
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:15,500
HE'S CHOSEN YOU TO BE THE
SACRIFICE FOR THE CEREMONY.

103
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,625
I'M SAD I WON'T EVER
GET TO SEE YOU AGAIN,

104
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,958
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO
HELP US GET TO HEAVEN.

105
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:26,375
AW, YOU'RE TREMBLING. ARE YOU
AFRAID OF BEING SACRIFICED?

106
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:29,916
OR DOES THIS CELL
BRING BACK MEMORIES?

107
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:34,416
- ( growling )

108
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,916
- Budi: DID YOU
BRATS REALLY THINK

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,666
YOU COULD GET AWAY THAT EASILY?

110
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,791
YOU'RE ALL GOING
TO BE PUNISHED BIG TIME

111
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,041
FOR TRYING TO PULL
ONE OVER ON US.

112
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,375
- NOW, NOW. NORMALLY
I'D AGREE WITH YOU

113
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,791
BUT WE CANNOT
AFFORD ANY MORE

114
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,958
CONSTRUCTION DELAYS
ON THE R-SYSTEM.

115
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,166
IF YOU TELL US WHO CAME UP
WITH YOUR ESCAPE PLAN,

116
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,500
WE'LL JUST TAKE
THEM AND LEAVE

117
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:54,958
THE REST OF YOU ALONE.

118
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,208
THAT'S PRETTY NICE OF US,
DON'T YOU THINK?

119
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,583
- SPEAK UP. WHICH ONE
OF YOU WAS IT?

120
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,625
- ( sobbing )

121
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,500
- I WAS...
- IT WAS ME.

122
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,875
I CAME UP WITH OUR ESCAPE
PLAN. IT WAS ALL ME.

123
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,208
- OH?

124
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,625
- WELL, AREN'T YOU BRAVE.
BUT I KNOW IT WASN'T YOU.

125
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,125
IT WAS THE REDHEAD.

126
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,333
- Budi: TAKE HER AWAY.

127
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,958
- NO, IT WASN'T HER.
I SWEAR IT WAS MY IDEA.

128
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,083
SHE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

129
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,166
- YEAH, LET HER GO.
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

130
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,375
- ( both screams )

131
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:28,458
- PLEASE DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME
'CAUSE I'LL BE OKAY.

132
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:29,875
- ERZA.

133
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,000
- IT'S JUST LIKE 
YOU SAID, JELLAL.

134
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,375
THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE AFRAID OF.

135
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,125
- ERZA.

136
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,458
THEY WON'T GET
AWAY WITH THIS.

137
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,500
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
ENDED UP BEING PUNISHED

138
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,000
EVEN THOUGH I CAME
UP WITH THE PLAN,

139
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:49,333
BUT I WAS TOO SCARED
TO SAY ANYTHING.

140
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:52,375
I'M SORRY. IT WAS MY FAULT.

141
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,208
- THAT'S IN THE PAST, SHO.

142
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,916
RIGHT NOW, I'M WORRIED
THAT NONE OF YOU REALIZE

143
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,041
HOW DANGEROUS IT IS TO

144
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,791
RESURRECT SOMEONE
USING THE R-SYSTEM.

145
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:05,083
- WOW. I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
TO KNOW WHAT IT'S PURPOSE WAS.

146
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,958
THAT'S QUITE A SURPRISE.

147
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,791
- THE "REVIVE SYSTEM".

148
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,625
IN EXCHANGE FOR
COUNTLESS SACRIFICES,

149
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,083
BRINGS A SINGLE PERSON
BACK FROM THE DEAD.

150
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,416
IT IS INHUMANE,
FORBIDDEN, BLACK MAGIC.

151
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,833
- SURE IT'S FORBIDDEN

152
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,583
BUT WHOEVER SAID MAGIC
HAD TO BE HUMANE?

153
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:23,375
I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE MAGIC
WEARS AWAY AT ONE'S HUMANITY.

154
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,416
- THAT'S A BLACK
MAGIC PHILOSOPHY.

155
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,333
ARE YOU ONE OF THEM NOW?

156
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:30,041
- ARE YOU SERIOUSLY
COMPARING US TO THOSE IDIOTS?

157
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,166
THEY THOUGHT THIS TOWER

158
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,916
WAS ONLY GOOD FOR
RESURRECTION MAGIC.

159
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,250
WE KNOW BETTER 'CAUSE
WE'VE BEEN ENLIGHTENED.

160
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,791
JELLAL TOLD US THAT HE CAN USE
THE TOWER TO GET US INTO HEAVEN.

161
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,166
- TO HEAVEN?

162
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,500
- YOU SEE, ONCE WE USE
THE R-SYSTEM TO REVIVE HIM,

163
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:48,916
THE WORLD WILL BE REBORN.
AND WE WILL BECOME IT'S RULERS.

164
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,416
THE CULT MEMBERS WHO KEPT US
PRISONER FOR ALL THOSE YEARS,

165
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,833
THE LOVED ONES OF THE SISTER
WHO BETRAYED US,

166
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,833
THE CITIZENS WHO LIVE
THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

167
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,458
BLISSFULLY IGNORANT,

168
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,833
THOSE FOOLS ON
THE MAGIC COUNCIL,

169
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,708
WE'RE GOING TO PUT
FEAR AND SORROW

170
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,625
IN THE HEARTS OF EVERY
LAST ONE OF THEM.

171
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,791
THEY'LL BE STRIPPED OF THEIR
FREEDOM AND DENIED ANY RIGHTS

172
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,375
ONCE WE'RE IN CONTROL.

173
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,875
THEY'LL HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO BOW DOWN BEFORE US.

174
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,375
( laughs )

175
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,541
- SHO.

176
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,041
- ( chuckling )

177
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:36,333
- WHAT COULD'VE POSSIBLY CAUSED
YOU TO CHANGE SO DRASTICALLY?

178
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,708
JELLAL. WHAT HAS
HE DONE TO THEM?

179
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,875
- ( exclaims )

180
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,000
I'M TOTALLY SURROUNDED
BY KITTY CATS.

181
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:51,291
WHOA, WHERE AM I? CREEPY.

182
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,375
- MEOW.
- A CREEPY CAT GIRL.

183
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,125
- SO, HOW'RE YOU FEELING?

184
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,375
- WELL, I'VE BEEN BETTER.

185
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,583
- ( exclaims )
I'VE GOT A TALKING KITTY.

186
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,250
YOU'RE GOING TO HUG
ME TO DEATH.

187
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:04,791
- MILLI, DOLL. BETTER LET GO
BEFORE YOU KNOCK OFF THAT CAT.

188
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,166
- MEOW.
- IT'S YOU.

189
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,458
- SURE, A TALKING CAT IS DANDY.
KNOW WHAT'S DANDIER?

190
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,500
- A CAT THAT CAN TALK.
- OH, YEAH.

191
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,583
- BUT THAT'S THE SAME THING.
HOW'D I END UP IN THIS PLACE?

192
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,833
AND WHAT HAPPENED TO NATSU?

193
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,333
- DON'T GET MOUTHY,

194
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,666
OR YOU'LL END UP
SIX FEET UNDER

195
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,333
JUST LIKE YOUR
LITTLE PINK FRIEND.

196
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,041
- THERE'S NO WAY THIS GUY
COULD HAVE TAKEN DOWN NATSU.

197
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,166
- WE GOT BAD NEWS.

198
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,083
- ERZA SCARLET HAS
ESCAPED HER CELL.

199
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:32,166
- SHE DID? THAT'S ERZY FOR YOU.

200
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,333
- WELL, THERE IS NO WAY
THE BROAD'S BUSTING OUT

201
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,458
OF THIS TOWER AGAIN.

202
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:36,583
- PLEASE, FOLLOW US.

203
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,583
- ERZA'S HERE.
THEY GOT HER, TOO.

204
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,416
- ( Jellal laughing )

205
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,666
- MASTER JELLAL?

206
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,166
- LITTLE ERZA'S GROWN
INTO AN AMAZING WOMAN.

207
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,791
I MUST SAY, I'M IMPRESSED.

208
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:52,708
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW THIS
ALL PLAYS OUT. WILL I PREVAIL?

209
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,333
OR WILL IT BE HER?

210
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:58,041
WE'LL HAVE A GAME THAT
INTERWEAVES PAST AND FUTURE,

211
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,083
LIFE AND DEATH.

212
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,166
- Michello: WE MUST DO
SOMETHING TO STOP JELLAL.

213
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,416
- Leiji: WE SHOULD
GATHER INFORMATION,

214
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,750
- Belno: DISPATCH THE MILITARY.

215
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,375
- YOU IGNORANT FOOLS.

216
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,750
- Leiji: SIEGRAIN.
- Belno: HOW DARE YOU?

217
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,500
- ONLY FOOLS WOULD
SEND IN THE MILITARY

218
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,416
AND RISK THE LIVES OF HUNDREDS
OF INNOCENT SOLDIERS.

219
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,208
I'M TELLING YOU,
IT'S FAR TOO DANGEROUS.

220
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,333
WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE WE DO?

221
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,416
- THIS IS A PRECARIOUS
SITUATION.

222
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,791
IF WE WANT TO STOP HIM,

223
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,541
WE'LL HAVE TO COMPLETELY
DESTROY THE TOWER OF HEAVEN.

224
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,375
AND THERE'S ONLY
ONE WAY TO DO THAT.

225
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,583
ETHERION.

226
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:29,833
- ARE YOU INSANE?

227
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,583
- THAT'S CROSS-DIMENSIONAL
DESTRUCTION MAGIC.

228
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:32,958
- WE CAN'T.

229
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,458
- DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
DEVASTATION IT WOULD CAUSE?

230
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,541
THAT WEAPON HAS THE POWER
TO OBLITERATE AN ENTIRE NATION.

231
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,000
- Belno: ETHERION IS
AN ABSOLUTE LAST RESORT.

232
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,750
IT IS MORE DANGEROUS
THAN THE R-SYSTEM ITSELF.

233
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,666
- Siegrain: JUST HEAR ME OUT.

234
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,916
THE SATELLITE SQUARE
CAN PINPOINT A TARGET

235
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,333
ANYWHERE IN THE REGION.

236
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:52,041
IF WE FOCUS IT
DIRECTLY ON THE TOWER,

237
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,750
WE CAN CAUSE LESS
COLLATERAL DAMAGE

238
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,125
AND DESTROY
THE STRUCTURE.

239
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,125
- I VOTE TO FIRE.

240
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,333
- NOT YOU TOO.
HAVE YOU GONE MAD?

241
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:03,375
- THREE MORE IN FAVOR
WILL GIVE US THE MAJORITY.

242
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,500
BUT WE CAN'T LET
DELIBERATIONS DELAY US,

243
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,000
TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE.

244
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,750
I URGE YOU TO
VOTE WITH ME.

245
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:12,166
WE CANNOT ALLOW JELLAL TO
ACTIVATE THE TOWER OF HEAVEN.

246
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,125
- BUT ALONG WITH
DESTROYING THE TOWER,

247
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:17,916
AN ETHERION BLAST WILL
NO DOUBT KILL YOUR BROTHER.

248
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,333
- I REALIZE THAT.

249
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:23,333
HOWEVER, IT'S A SACRIFICE
THAT MUST BE MADE.

250
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:36,666
- TALK. TELL ME WHERE
I CAN FIND JELLAL.

251
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,958
-THEY GOT A TON OF LOOKOUTS.
- LET'S CHARGE THEM.

252
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,333
- Lucy: DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT IT.

253
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,416
REMEMBER, THEY HAVE
ERZA AND HAPPY.

254
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,958
IF WE SCREW THIS UP, WE COULD
BE PUTTING THEM IN DANGER.

255
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,708
- MAN, THIS IS GOING
TO BE TRICKY.

256
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:49,458
- I FOUND AN UNDERWATER
PASSAGEWAY INTO THE TOWER.

257
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,208
- SERIOUSLY? WAY TO GO.

258
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,416
- YOU HEAR THAT, LUCY?

259
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,625
I WAS JUST PRAISED
BY GRAY, NOT YOU.

260
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,500
- YEAH, YEAH.

261
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,416
- Juvia: WE CAN SWIM
THERE IN TEN MINUTES.

262
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,875
- Natsu: WE CAN HOLD
OUR BREATH THAT LONG, RIGHT?

263
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,083
- Gray: PROBABLY.

264
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,625
- THAT'S NOT  HUMANLY
POSSIBLE, YOU DOPES.

265
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,625
- IN THAT CASE, I SUGGEST
YOU WEAR THESE.

266
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,833
IT'S A WATER SHELL
CONTAINING OXYGEN.

267
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,625
THIS WAY YOU CAN BREATHE
WHILE UNDERWATER.

268
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:13,666
- WOW, YOU'RE AWESOME.
AND WHO ARE YOU AGAIN?

269
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,125
- Gray: SO, WE'RE BENEATH
THE TOWER NOW, HUH?

270
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,083
- I WONDER WHERE THEY'RE
KEEPING ERZA AND HAPPY.

271
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,125
- THEY MAY LOOK SILLY
BUT THEY SURE DO WORK.

272
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,541
- I'M IMPRESSED
YOU MADE IT HERE

273
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,166
BECAUSE I PURPOSELY
MADE YOUR SHELL SMALLER

274
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,708
SO YOU'D HAVE
TROUBLE BREATHING.

275
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:32,875
- GEE, THANKS.

276
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,083
- ( growls )

277
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,458
- INTRUDERS.

278
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,916
- Lucy: UH, OH.

279
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,875
- IDENTIFY YOURSELVES.

280
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,791
- GUESS WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.
WE'RE HAVE TO FIGHT THEM.

281
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:44,916
- YES.

282
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,666
- YOU LOSERS WANT
TO KNOW WHO WE ARE?

283
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,333
WE'RE THE WIZARDS WHO'RE
GOING TO POUND YOUR FACES IN.

284
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,291
- WHAT THE...

285
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,041
- WE'RE FROM FAIRY TAIL.

286
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:56,875
- OW, SO HOT.
- OKAY, ICE MAKE LANCE.

287
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,541
- SO COLD.

288
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,666
- OH, WOW. SHE'S
FIGHTING IN HER BIKINI.

289
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,416
- OPEN GATE OF THE MAIDEN.

290
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,708
VIRGO.

291
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,250
- DID YOU SUMMON ME, PRINCESS?

292
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,291
- IT'S A MAID. SHE'S WAY
HOTTER THAN BIKINI GIRL.

293
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,666
- THESE PERVS NEED
TO BE PUNISHED.

294
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,125
- AS YOU WISH.

295
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,708
- IT'S LIKE SHE'S
MADE OF WATER.

296
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,375
- CAREFUL MEN, BLADES
WON'T AFFECT HER.

297
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,333
- BUT I BET OUR GUNS WILL.

298
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,083
- WHOA. WHAT'S WITH THIS CHICK?

299
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,583
- DRIP, DRIP, DROP.

300
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,875
WATER SLICER.

301
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,208
THAT SEEMS TO HAVE DONE THE JOB.

302
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,458
- Gary: GOOD WORK, TEAM.

303
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,958
- I HOPE WE'RE NOT
CALLING ATTENTION TO, AW,

304
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:39,958
WHO AM I KIDDING?

305
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,083
- Virgo: I'M AFRAID SO, MISS.

306
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,708
- SO WHERE'S THE
BLOCKHEAD, BUDDY?

307
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,083
- Natsu: WHAT'S THAT?

308
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,750
- I THINK IT'S THEIR WAY
OF SAYING, COME ON IN.

309
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:54,375
- MASTER, WHY ARE YOU INVITING
THEM INTO THE TOWER?

310
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,500
- AS I SAID BEFORE,
THIS IS ALL ONE BIG GAME.

311
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,791
THEY WERE LUCKY ENOUGH
TO CLEAR THE FIRST STAGE,

312
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,500
BUT THEY STILL
HAVE A WAYS TO GO.

313
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,583
I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE
THINGS INTERESTING.

314
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,291
- BUT SHOULDN'T WE
CONCENTRATE ON THE CEREMONY?

315
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,250
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE THE COUNCIL

316
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,875
CATCHES ON TO OUR PLANS.

317
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,583
- NOW VIDALDUS, HOW MANY
TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU

318
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,541
NOT TO WORRY
ABOUT THEM?

319
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,041
- I VOTE YES.

320
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,541
- LEIJI, NOT YOU TOO?

321
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,000
- THERE'S NO OTHER CHOICE.

322
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:23,500
- TWO MORE VOTES ARE NEEDED.
PLEASE, TRUST ME ON THIS.

323
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:28,458
- THE MAGIC COUNCIL ONLY WISHES
THEY HAD THE POWER TO STOP ME.

324
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,833
- Natsu: HEY BLOCKHEAD.

325
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,375
- Lucy: GEEZ. WOULD
YOU KEEP IT DOWN?

326
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,708
- Gary: I DON'T SEE THE POINT
IN SNEAKING AROUND ANYMORE.

327
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:38,083
NOT AFTER ALL THAT RUCKUS
THAT WENT ON DOWNSTAIRS.

328
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,541
- WHAT THE HECK
ARE YOU GUYS EATING?

329
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,833
- I SUGGEST YOU JOIN THEM
BEFORE THERE'S NOTHING LEFT.

330
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,416
- NO THANKS.

331
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,041
- Juvia: THE DOOR
THAT WELCOMED US IN

332
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,250
WAS CONTROLLED BY A MAGIC USER.

333
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,750
- Lucy: THEN THEY ARE WELL
AWARE OF OUR PRESENCE.

334
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,291
WHY WOULD THEY LET US IN?

335
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,333
- Gary: YOU THINK THEY'RE
TRYING TO PROVOKE US?

336
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,541
- I DON'T KNOW.

337
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,208
- NOT TO BE RUDE
BUT YOUR BIKINI

338
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,250
LEAVES LITTLE TO
THE IMAGINATION.

339
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,500
- SHOULD I CHANGE?
- YES. I'LL HELP YOU.

340
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,125
- WAIT? YOU MEAN, RIGHT HERE?

341
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,208
- HOLY...

342
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,125
- PLEASE STOP LOOKING
AT HER, GRAY.

343
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:09,541
- I BROUGHT THIS OVER FOR YOU
FROM THE CELESTIAL WORLD.

344
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,833
- SO BOYS, DO I LOOK SUPER
CUTE IN THIS OUTFIT OR WHAT?

345
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,000
- OH, YEAH. YOU LOOK GREAT.

346
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,958
- DON'T COMPLIMENT HER.
- HE LOVES HER.

347
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,666
- DON'T YOU START
DOING THAT, TOO.

348
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,375
- AND JUST WHEN WERE YOU
HANGING OUT WITH HAPPY, BIRDO?

349
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:23,708
- ( sneezes )

350
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,416
- I THINK I'M GOING TO GO
CRAZY IF I HAVE TO STAY

351
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,166
IN THIS PLACE MUCH LONGER.

352
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,833
- I WISH YOU LUCK, PRINCESS.

353
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,333
- THANKS FOR THE HELP, VIRGO.

354
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,750
OH, DID YOU GUYS WANT ME
TO ASK HER TO BRING YOU

355
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,166
A DRY CHANGE OF CLOTHES, TOO?

356
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,875
- NAH, THIS DOES
THE TRICK JUST FINE.

357
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,500
- HE'S NOT A DRYER, YOU KNOW.

358
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,708
- THE INTRUDERS.
- WE FOUND THEM.

359
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,000
- ERZA.
- THANK GOODNESS YOU'RE OKAY.

360
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,208
- WOW. SHE'S SO COOL.

361
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,625
- IT'S YOU. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING INSIDE THE TOWER?

362
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:50,916
- LOOKING FOR YOU.

363
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,333
- WE HAVEN'T MET,
MY NAME IS JUVIA AND...

364
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:57,333
- GO HOME. THIS PLACE
IS FAR TOO DANGEROUS.

365
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,625
- YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO SCARE ME INTO LEAVING.

366
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,708
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE
TILL THAT BLOCKHEAD

367
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,416
GETS A GOOD TASTE OF MY FIST.

368
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,291
I'M GOING TO MAKE HIM PAY
FOR SHOOTIN' ME IN THE MOUTH.

369
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,125
- YOU HAVE TO GO.
- BUT WHY?

370
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:11,583
- YOUR FRIENDS KIDNAPPED HAPPY.
I CAN'T LEAVE HERE WITHOUT HIM.

371
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:15,000
- THEY GOT HIM TOO?
IT MUST HAVE BEEN MILLIANNA.

372
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,666
- WHERE CAN I FIND HIM?

373
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,750
- IN THE OCEAN?
- Erza: I'M NOT SURE.

374
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,583
- THIS MEANS WAR.

375
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,166
- WHO'RE YOU DECLARING
WAR AGAINST?

376
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,500
- THE JERKS THAT KIDNAPPED
MY LITTLE BUDDY.

377
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,583
- WAIT. NATSU.

378
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,625
- WHAT A MORON.
- POOR NATSU.

379
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:31,000
- LET'S GO AND HELP HIM.
- NO.

380
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,708
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT HAPPY.

381
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,791
MILLIANNA IS A CAT LOVER,
SHE'D NEVER DO ANYTHING

382
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,291
TO HURT HIM.

383
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,041
I PROMISE I'LL BRING THEM BOTH
BACK TO THE GUILD WITH ME

384
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,208
BUT YOU THREE NEED
TO LEAVE IMMEDIATELY.

385
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,083
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
WE CAN HELP YOU.

386
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,458
- I DON'T WANT YOUR HELP.
THIS IS MY PROBLEM,

387
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:46,833
IT DOESN'T INVOLVE YOU.

388
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,291
- HOW CAN YOU SAY
THAT? YOU SAW NATSU.

389
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:52,000
I'D SAY WE'RE PLENTY INVOLVED.

390
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,500
- ERZA, WHAT'S UP
WITH THIS TOWER?

391
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,833
AND WHO IS THIS JELLAL GUY?

392
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,666
I CAN UNDERSTAND IF YOU
DON'T WANT TO TELL US.

393
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,000
YOU SAID THE CREEPS
WHO KIDNAPPED YOU

394
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,125
USED TO BE FRIENDS
OF YOURS, RIGHT?

395
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,750
WELL, WE'RE YOUR FRIENDS NOW
AND WE'RE HERE TO HELP YOU.

396
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,000
AND NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

397
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,916
WE'RE ALWAYS GOING
TO HAVE YOUR BACK.

398
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,541
- YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT.

399
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,416
- LEAVE.
- COME ON.

400
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,125
- YOU'RE FREAKING ME OUT 'CAUSE
THIS ISN'T LIKE YOU AT ALL.

401
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,083
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WOMAN
WHO'D TELL US TO SHUT UP

402
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,333
AND COME ALONG WHETHER
WE WANTED TO OR NOT?

403
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,791
WE WANNA STAY HERE
AND HELP YOU OUT.

404
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,166
MASTER TAUGHT US THAT EVEN
THE STRONGEST WARRIORS

405
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,791
NEED A LITTLE BACKUP
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

406
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,541
- I'M SORRY. BUT YOU
CAN'T HELP ME NOW,

407
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,875
THE ODDS ARE
STACKED AGAINST ME.

408
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:44,250
WIN OR LOSE THIS BATTLE,
I'M STARING DEATH IN THE FACE.

409
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,708
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

410
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:51,250
- THERE'S NO POINT IN FIGHTING
WHAT'S INEVITABLE. I CAN'T.

411
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,041
BUT WHAT I CAN DO
IS SHARE MY STORY

412
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:56,166
WITH YOU WHILE I'M STILL HERE.

413
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,083
THIS BUILDING IS THE
TOWER OF HEAVEN.

414
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,958
IT'S ALSO CALLED THE R-SYSTEM.

415
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,666
OVER A DECADE AGO,

416
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,666
A CULT DEDICATED TO BLACK
MAGIC BEGAN IT'S CONSTRUCTION.

417
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,791
IT WOULD BE USED TO
CAST A FORBIDDEN SPELL

418
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,166
THAT BRINGS THE
DEAD BACK TO LIFE.

419
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,791
THE SPELL REQUIRED
MULTIPLE HUMAN SACRIFICES

420
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,708
SO THE CULT ABDUCTED CITIZENS
OF THE SURROUNDING AREAS

421
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:26,708
AND FORCED THEM TO BUILD
THE TOWER AS THEIR SLAVES.

422
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,000
THE ONLY REASON I
KNOW THIS IS BECAUSE

423
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,541
I WAS ONE OF
THOSE PEOPLE.

424
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:31,916
- ( all gasp )

425
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
- ANYONE WHO DARED TO
RESIST THE CULT

426
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:38,708
OR TRIED TO ESCAPE THE TOWER
WOULD MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEAR.

427
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:43,416
WE NEVER HAD ANY PEACE OF MIND.
WE LIVED IN CONSTANT FEAR.

428
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,000
BUT WE BONDED AND MADE FRIENDS
WE COULD TRUST DESPITE THAT,

429
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:51,125
EVEN THOUGH WE KNEW WE
WOULDN'T BE TOGETHER LONG.

430
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:56,041
ONE OF MY FRIENDS IN THE TOWER
WAS A BOY NAMED JELLAL.

431
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:01,166
- ( fighting noises )

432
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:05,666
- ERZA. HOLD ON.

433
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,125
DON'T WORRY, I'LL
GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

434
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,083
YOUR EYE.

435
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,875
THEY'VE GONE TOO FAR. WHAT
DID SHE DO TO DESERVE THIS?

436
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,666
WHAT DID ANY OF US DO?

437
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,875
( cries ) NO.

438
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,458
- JELLAL.

439
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:31,625
- THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S ME. YOU'LL
BE SAFE NOW. I'M HERE WITH YOU.

440
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,083
- HOW'LL WE GET OUT?

441
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,458
- WELL, THERE'S NO
TURNING BACK NOW.

442
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,458
WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT.

443
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,000
- WE HAVE TO FIGHT.

444
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:51,750
- OH, NO. MAGIC SOLDIERS.

445
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,208
- Sho: I HOPE SISTER'S GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

446
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,166
GRANDPA ROB, YOU CAME BACK
FROM PUNISHMENT ALIVE.

447
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,666
YOU THINK SHE'LL BE OKAY?

448
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,333
- I'M SURE SHE'S
GOING TO BE FINE.

449
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,000
THEY CAN TORTURE
HER ALL DAY AND NIGHT

450
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:07,166
BUT THEY'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO TAKE HER SOUL AWAY FROM HER.

451
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,458
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

452
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,541
- Guard: GET IN.

453
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:11,791
- Sho: SISTER.

454
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:15,375
- Simon: ERZA. WAIT A MINUTE,
WHERE'S JELLAL?

455
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,041
- Grandpa Rob: DON'T UPSET
HER ANY MORE.

456
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,458
WE SHOULD JUST BE HAPPY
SHE'S COME BACK TO US ALIVE.

457
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:20,833
- BUT GRANDPA...

458
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,416
- I CAN ONLY ASSUME
THEY'VE CHOSEN

459
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,333
TO KEEP HIM IN HER PLACE.

460
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,250
- ( sobs )
I CAN'T TAKE IT.

461
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,000
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

462
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,458
- QUIT YOUR CRYING, KID.
- CALM DOWN, SHO.

463
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,708
THERE'S NO NEED TO CRY.

464
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,125
EVERYTHING'S GOING
TO WORK OUT JUST FINE.

465
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,000
- Guard: SHUT IT,
YOU LITTLE BRAT.

466
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,583
- Sho: LEAVE ME ALONE.

467
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:41,125
- Jellal: WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT.

468
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,458
- Simon: WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

469
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:43,791
- Guard: WHAT THE...

470
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,958
- NO WAY.
- COULD IT BE?

471
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,833
- MUTINY.

472
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,291
- WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?

473
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:53,791
- FIND A WEAPON.

474
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,583
WE CAN'T ESCAPE AND THEY'RE
NOT GOING TO SET US FREE.

475
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:59,791
SO IF WE WANT OUT OF
HERE, WE HAVE TO FIGHT.

476
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,958
FOR OUR LIVES, FOR OUR FREEDOM.

477
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,375
- ( cheering )

478
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,208
SO WE TOOK A STAND
FOR OUR FREEDOM.

479
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:13,208
WE HOPED TO SAVE
OUR DEAR FRIEND JELLAL.

480
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,750
HE WAS LIKE THE LEADER
OF OUR GROUP BACK THEN.

481
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:20,416
HE HAD A STRONG SENSE
OF JUSTICE THAT I TRULY ADMIRED.

482
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,625
HOWEVER...

483
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,708
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO HIM.

484
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:28,083
IT'S ALMOST AS IF HE BECAME
AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PERSON.

485
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:31,958
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY I COULD
DESCRIBE JELLAL'S NEW PERSONA,

486
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:35,291
PURE, UNADULTERATED EVIL.

487
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,666
- HEY NATSU, I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU'VE HEARD A REALLY WEIRD

488
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,333
SOUND THE LAST FEW NIGHTS.

489
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:20,000
- NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY.
WHAT'S IT SOUND LIKE?

490
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,708
- IT'S CREEPY. IT SOUNDS
LIKE A GIRL CRYING,

491
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:25,208
AND I HEAR IT EVERY NIGHT
BEFORE I GO TO BED.

492
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:27,416
- REALLY? MAN, THAT
SOUNDS TOTALLY COOL.

493
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,791
- WELL, I DON'T THINK IT'S COOL
'CAUSE I CAN'T SLEEP.

494
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:33,458
- Natsu and Happy:
NEXT TIME, VOICE OF DARKNESS.

495
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:34,541
- Natsu: SO DOES THIS GHOST

496
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,250
OF YOURS SAY ANYTHING
IN PARTICULAR?

497
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:38,625
- Happy: "THE RENT.
MUST PAY THE RENT."

498
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:40,875
- Natsu: UH, I'M PRETTY
SURE THAT'S JUST LUCY.
