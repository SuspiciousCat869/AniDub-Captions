1
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:22,625
[ASCA] I know this place!

2
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:24,416
I remember all the pretty snow,

3
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,875
and laughing under
the moon and stars!

4
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:29,541
There was the
funny flying snowman!

5
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,958
I wanted to
play with him so bad!

6
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,083
Mommy and daddy
were there with me!

7
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,916
That made me so happy!

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,125
And then the snowman
banged the drum!

9
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,291
He banged it so hard,
we all went flying

10
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,625
into the sky with him!

11
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:47,125
It made us
all laugh and laugh!

12
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,583
It was so much fun!

13
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,833
[ASCA laughing]

14
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,666
[ASCA] Bye-bye, mommy!
Bye-bye, daddy!

15
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,916
[BISCA, ALZACK]
Bye-bye, darlin'!

16
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,041
Take real good care
of our lil' dumplin' okay?

17
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,125
Sure! Don't you worry!

18
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,958
Don't forget to bring
me back lotsa presents!

19
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,000
We won't!

20
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,500
Love you!

21
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,458
[NATSU] All right, kiddo.

22
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,500
Wanna go get some juice?

23
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:11,750
Yeah!

24
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,791
[HAPPY]
What a Pure Heart Weaves!

25
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:27,833
Super yummy! Wow!
I wanna drink another one!

26
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,500
Uh, I don't think so.

27
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,958
You gotta be real careful.

28
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,583
Too much of that stuff
might make you wet the--

29
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,000
Shut up.
Don't say another word about it.

30
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,750
You'll hurt her feelings.

31
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,125
You'll whet your appetite!

32
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,375
And then you'll
be way too hungry

33
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,958
to have any kinda fun today!

34
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,250
[laughs nervously]

35
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,833
[ASCA] You were
gonna say "wet the bed,"

36
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,916
but big girls don't do that!

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,416
He's got to be the
most clueless person

38
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,291
I've ever met.

39
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,375
You're a really lucky
little girl, ya know.

40
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:56,166
Not everyone knows
someone as fun as Natsu!

41
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,250
Yeah, and he even said

42
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,083
that he's gonna
buy me some cake, too!

43
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,166
I did?

44
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,875
Do you even sell
cake at the bar, Mira?

45
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,208
Mommy and daddy
got some for me!

46
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,791
Well we normally have cake,

47
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,208
but we sold the
last one earlier today.

48
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,541
Aww!

49
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,750
I'm sorry about that.
Will ya take a rain check?

50
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,708
You can just go to
the bakery across town

51
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,291
and get some there instead!

52
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,541
You gotta be crazy if you think
I'm gonna go through all that!

53
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:20,791
Don't worry, guys!

54
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,000
I'd be more than happy
to bake a cake for her!

55
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,333
Yeah?

56
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,916
I didn't know you knew
how to do stuff like that.

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,333
Well, I've only
made a few of them,

58
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,916
so it's not really
something I do all the time.

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,458
But I'll sure try!

60
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,166
While there's a slim chance
it'll be anywhere near yummy,

61
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,166
it might be edible
at the very least.

62
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,791
[chair sliding]

63
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,041
If you insist,

64
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,458
I will gladly join you
on this quest for cake!

65
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:42,958
Say what now?

66
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,291
Nobody was even talking to her.

67
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,958
But if we are to
take on this endeavor,

68
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,666
we must ensure they are the
finest cakes in all of Fiore.

69
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,750
Do you understand?

70
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,958
Huh? Uh, okay!

71
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,291
I think the real truth is

72
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,333
that you just want to
eat some, too, don't you?

73
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,708
But to achieve our goal,

74
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,291
we need to harvest some
Maximum Sweet Strawberries.

75
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,333
The rarest kind that exist.

76
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:06,500
The Legends say they only grow
once every ten thousand years.

77
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:09,000
She's completely
in her own little world.

78
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,333
I shall embark
at once to find them!

79
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,916
Now you're gonna leave
to go pick strawberries?

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,458
[ERZA] Look alive, Pantherlily!
I'm gonna need your help!

81
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,500
Say what?
Why do you need me?

82
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,250
Because, that's why!

83
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,791
Sounds like a good time to me.

84
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,291
So let's hit the road!

85
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,791
You're s'posed to be
playing with me today, 'member?

86
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,250
Uh... Of course I remember!

87
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,708
Okay.

88
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,750
I guess I should get started
making some sponge cakes!

89
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,916
And I'll start whipping
up some cream for them.

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,125
Whoa, you mean you can
actually make food, too?

91
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,291
Did you say something?

92
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,125
I mean, that sounds yummy!

93
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,875
Our success depends on you!

94
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,333
Come on, Lily. Let's get moving!

95
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,583
What? You're serious?

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,208
[PANTHERLILY] Put me down!

97
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,833
[LUCY] Are Erza and Lily
going on a job together?

98
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,500
That's a weird team, huh?

99
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,208
They're picking strawberries!

100
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,750
Yeah? Never woulda guessed that!

101
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,416
[NATSU] All right,
the rules are simple!

102
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,458
Whichever one of us
hits the target the most times

103
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,583
is the winner!

104
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,125
I got it! Pow, pow, pow!

105
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,833
[LUCY] Hey, what are
you guys doing over here?

106
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,833
A little
sharpshooting contest.

107
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,416
We're gonna see
if he's better with fire

108
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,041
than she is with a toy gun.

109
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,250
I like ya,
but ya ain't gonna beat me!

110
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:19,791
But if I do, ya gotta
do whatever I tell ya to!

111
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,166
All right, you're on!

112
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,833
You don't have
to take it so seriously.

113
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,291
She's just a little kid.

114
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:27,541
I'm not gonna go easy
on her just 'cause she's young.

115
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,291
Losin' just ain't my style!

116
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,375
[laughs]

117
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,041
Could you be
any more immature?

118
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:37,625
Get real, you know
Natsu is just a big ol' kid.

119
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,125
Let's do this!

120
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,583
[ASCA]
Clippity-clop! Clippity-clop!

121
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,875
Giddy up, little horsey,
we got bandits to chase!

122
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,500
He knew the rules.

123
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:56,458
You gotta start makin'
some horsey noises, Natsu!

124
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,750
[neighs awkwardly]

125
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,375
Come on, you can
do better than that!

126
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:04,958
[neighs awkwardly]

127
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,250
That'll teach him
to never play a player.

128
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,625
Well, considering what
both her parents are like,

129
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,541
she was probably shooting guns
while she was in the womb!

130
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,541
Yeah, I'd bet you're
right about that one.

131
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,666
Where are her parents, anyway?

132
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,000
They went on a job.

133
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,833
And for some reason
they asked Natsu to babysit

134
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,416
while they were
gone for the day.

135
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,333
[neighs awkwardly]

136
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,125
--You're killin' me, kid!
--Okay, Mister Horsey!

137
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:28,625
I want you to gallop all
the way to the Southgate Park!

138
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,208
You're gonna make
me do this in public?

139
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,458
Oh yeah! So giddy-up, Natsu!

140
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,875
And this is why
I'm scared of children.

141
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,791
You lost fair and square, pal.
So just grin and bear it.

142
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,291
Okily doke, m'lady,
the park it is!

143
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,291
Yay!

144
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,125
You got precious cargo there,
so be careful!

145
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,791
There's been a
buncha ne'er do wells

146
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,583
causin' trouble in town lately.

147
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:50,833
Keep your eyes on her.

148
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,541
Well, they're
gonna be really sorry

149
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,833
if they try and mess with us!

150
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:58,791
[ASCA laughing]

151
00:07:58,875 --> 00:07:59,708
Pow! Pow!

152
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,000
Oh, ya got me!

153
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,375
--Pow pow pow!
--But I'm still goin'!

00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,958
[laughing]

155
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,000
[ASCA] Pow!

156
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,958
So why did I
come along, again?

157
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,291
Because Natsu
is babysitting her.

158
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,791
And that's scary.

159
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,916
Let me teach you how to shoot
since you're so bad at it.

160
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,166
Oh, you think
you're hot stuff?

161
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,166
You're just a kid! Oww!

162
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,291
Hang on!

163
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,750
Stop right where you are!
Stand still for me!

164
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,125
Huh? On this thing?

165
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,166
[ASCA] Yup! Now jump in!

166
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,791
Why the heck would
you make me do that?

167
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,250
Because you promised me.

168
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,208
You said you'd do
whatever I wanted, 'member?

169
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,041
[ASCA] Hey!

170
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,916
I wanna go on some jobs
with you guys!

171
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,750
Sorry, but
that's not happening.

172
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,750
Yeah, you're still 
way too little.

173
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,208
You're not any
bigger than me, Happy!

174
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,833
We're out having fun,
so why would ya wanna work?

175
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,541
Because there's
something I really wanna buy!

176
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:00,833
So I need money!

177
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,750
So let's go on a job!
Let's go right now!

178
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,125
Geez, this kid is so pushy!

179
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,375
I don't know.

180
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,333
We'd definitely need
to ask your mom and dad

181
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,416
before we went and
did something like that.

182
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,791
But... But Natsu promised me.

183
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,333
Okay, fine!

184
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:21,375
So let's head back to the guild
and check the request board!

185
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,916
Do you mean it?

186
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,541
Just leave everything to me!

187
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,416
[ASCA] Yeehaw! Thank you!

188
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,125
[HAPPY] There's gotta be a job
we can take the rugrat on...

189
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,291
I got a bunch
of 'em to choose from!

190
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,125
[ASCA laughing]

191
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,458
[NATSU] Nice work!

192
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,375
Let's see here...

193
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,500
I don't even
understand this one.

194
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,041
What exactly do they need?

195
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,291
Whatever it is,

196
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,541
I don't think little Asca
can do it, anyway.

197
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,541
[HAPPY] Look.

198
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,333
I know just what
and who they need!

199
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,166
Huh?

200
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,958
Uh, aww. This is gonna suck.

201
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,875
Open...
Gate of the Water Bearer!

202
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,583
Aquarius!

203
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,458
Thanks a lot, mermaid lady!

204
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,083
I have never been
so humiliated in my life.

205
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,708
You owe me.

206
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:16,875
I'm sorry.

207
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,416
But there's nobody else
that could fill in

208
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,333
for a broken fountain.

209
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,500
This is so romantic.

210
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,291
From the first time
we met at this plaza,

211
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,166
I've wanted to ask you
this question.

212
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,291
And I pray that
you don't say no.

213
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,458
My darling girl,
will you marry me?

214
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,291
Oh, yes, I will!

215
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,666
And to make things worse,

216
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,416
I gotta stand here and watch
this sappy B.S. all day?

217
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,500
I know it's not ideal,
but it's not gonna last forever!

218
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:43,208
This fountain is beautiful
cause you're so pretty!

219
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,833
Okay, fine.

220
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,708
But don't expect me
to do this ever again!

221
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:55,125
[OLD WOMAN 219A] I haven't been
able to cook a thing for days.

222
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,375
Fire it up real good, Natsu!

223
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,916
I thought a
delivery job would be

224
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,125
something you and I
could do together!

225
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,708
Yeehaw!

226
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,500
So since we've
come all this way,

227
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,000
where are all of these
magnum sweeper special--

228
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,875
I'm sure you mean the
Maximum Sweet Strawberries.

229
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,208
The legends say
they're somewhere

230
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,583
in this mountain range.

231
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,875
Are you kidding me?

232
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,541
How are we gonna find them?

233
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,250
Watch and learn.
Now, requip!

234
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,541
What in the heck is that getup?

235
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,333
Some kind of strawberry armor?

236
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,000
You could say that.

237
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,041
[PANTHERLILY]
It looks hard to move in.

238
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,666
The purpose of
this particular armor

239
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,083
is to emit the sweet
fragrance of strawberries.

240
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,041
Do you understand
what that will do?

241
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,750
[distant rumbling]

242
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,750
Oh! A woman that
smells like strawberries!

243
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,875
These creatures can't
resist women or berries,

244
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,250
so we shall ask them.

245
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,833
That's your plan, is it?

246
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,250
Correct!

247
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,333
So apprehend those stinky,
love struck apes at once!

248
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,416
I get it!
That's why you brought me here!

249
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,541
Geez.
That's all you had to say!

250
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,375
Yah!

251
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,916
The throes of battle are
impossible for me to resist!

252
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,958
Strawberry Armor:
Berry Sweet Dreams!

253
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,666
What a sweet defeat.

254
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,291
[ERZA] Now...

255
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,875
I've heard tales that
you mountain-dwelling Vulcans

256
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,541
possess important information
regarding the secret location

257
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,083
of Maximum Sweet Strawberries!

258
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,875
You'd be wise to share.

259
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,125
Yes ma'am.

260
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,375
[ASCA] Wow!

261
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,583
I can't believe
how many bills

262
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,875
we were able to rake
in just one afternoon.

263
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,541
Going on a bunch
of those little jobs

264
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,291
really adds up quickly.

265
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,958
Just let her have it,
Natsu, she's just a kid.

266
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,125
Now I can finally
buy what I want!

267
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,625
And what's that?

268
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,416
[LUCY] Something from here?

269
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,250
Wow!

270
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,125
[giggling]

271
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,458
What is it, anyway?

272
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:19,708
It looks like a really
pretty snow globe to me.

273
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,291
Is it some kinda lacrima?

274
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,625
It's so cool!

275
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,291
Yep, it's got mommy
and daddy's memories in it!

276
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,208
That thing's got what now?

277
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,416
So what's it
doing in a pawnshop?

278
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,833
I don't know.

279
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,041
But one time we were all
walking by that store's window

280
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,208
and they started
talking about it.

281
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,875
I can't believe
it's actually still here.

282
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,041
I know.

283
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,416
We sure have come
a long way since then.

284
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,708
[ALZACK] It's kind of
a beautiful memory now.

285
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:50,958
Aw, how sweet.

286
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,333
The whole reason
you wanted to buy it

287
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,750
is so you could give it
back to your mom and dad!

288
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,583
Mmm-hmm!

289
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,250
What a good girl.

290
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,666
Come here,
ya little sweetheart!

291
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,583
I'm gettin a little
misty-eyed over here!

292
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,000
Not me, bro.

293
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,416
Lucy?

294
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,625
When are you and Natsu
finally gonna kiss each other?

295
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,166
Say what?

296
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,750
Mommy and Daddy are
kissing all of the time!

297
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:15,833
[LUCY] That's great...

298
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,750
But we're not
your mom and dad, kid!

299
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,458
Give her a smooch, Natsu!
Right on the lips!

300
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,541
You gotta do
what she says, buddy!

301
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,708
You're way too
young to ask for that!

302
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,458
Yeah, I'm sorry
to let you down and all,

303
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,625
but that is totally
out of the question!

304
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,166
But you promised
me that you'd do

305
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,125
anything I asked you to do.

306
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,458
Well, it's not like
it'll kill us or anything.

307
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,375
Yeah, you're right!
Wait a second,

308
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,583
it's not my health
I'm concerned about!

309
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:40,833
Whoa...

310
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,916
You're actually serious
about this, aren't you?

311
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,166
And this is why
I'm scared of children.

312
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,291
That's good enough, I guess!

313
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,833
It's gone!

314

[ORCA WINGS laughing]

315
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,416
Sorry, little girl.

316
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,125
But this belongs to the
Orca Wing sky pirates now!

are those jerks?

Sky pirates?

00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,250
These must be the ones that
Wakaba and that other guy

were trying to warn us about!

00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,416
Give it back to me!
Please!

322
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,958
That's Mommy and Daddy's!

323
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:17,541
It has their memories!
You can't take it away!

324
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,375
[WENDY] Mm!

325
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,791
I sure hope this cake
tastes as good as it smells!

326
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,166
Well, the whipped cream
is just about ready to go.

327
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,875
All we need are strawberries!

328
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,791
Erza's getting those for us.

329
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,125
I wonder if
she's found them yet.

330
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:40,208
Oh my!
The secret strawberry grove!

331
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:44,875
I'm guessing those must be
the Maximum Sweet Strawberries!

332
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,541
That'd be great if they were,

333
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:49,291
but those are just
regular giant strawberries.

334
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,791
If you really wanna
find the Maximum Sweet one

335
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:55,500
that you've been looking for,
it's right down there.

336
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,750
Excellent!
Now harvest this rare delicacy

337
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,833
and deliver it straight
to Fairy Tail ASAP!

338
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,000
If we do that,

339
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,041
will you please stop
ordering us around?

340
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,083
Yeah, baby!

341
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,458
I betcha this lacrima here

342
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:11,083
will sell for a boatload of
jewel down in Hargeon!

343
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,916
It's our lucky day!

344
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,208
Take me up, Happy!

345
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,833
[HAPPY] My poor little
beak's been tainted.

346
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,500
Grow up, ya big sissy.

347
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,375
Give it back, meanie!
Give it back right now!

348
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,083
You're gonna need
way more firepower,

349
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,500
ya little brat!

350
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,541
I got him.

351
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,416
I just keep shooting at him
but he still won't stop!

352
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,833
I want mommy and
daddy's memories back.

353
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:37,083
They need them.
He can't just take them.

354
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:41,333
[sobbing]

355
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:44,333
Why are you doing that?
I can't see the bad guys!

356
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,916
Hey! Stop that!

357
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,958
Shh!

358
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:52,625
Okay, Asca!
Fire off four in a row!

359
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,666
[ORCA WINGS yelling]

360
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,375
You got all of 'em!

361
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,500
That's some awfully nice
shootin' ya did there, Asca!

362
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,083
Nothin' but bull's-eyes!

363
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,791
Way to go, lil' sharpshooter!

364
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:16,791
[ASCA] Thanks!

365
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,791
I'll be.

366
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,750
I'm not gonna go easy
on her just 'cause she's young.

367
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,916
Losin' just ain't my style!

368
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,708
So he did
let her win earlier.

369
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,000
All that talk was for her sake.

370
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,208
What a sweet guy!

371
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,916
[HAPPY] My beak...
It's been poisoned.

372
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:35,958
[NATSU] All right!

373
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,500
We'll be taking
this thing back now.

374
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,208
No way.

375
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,791
You can't just take somebody's
stuff from 'em like that!

376
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,166
Oh yeah?

377
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,916
You ain't seen the last of us!

378
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,125
We'll be back! You'll be sorry!

379
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,041
[screaming]

380
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:03,333
No doubt about it,
you're Alzack and Bisca's kid!

381
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,625
And I wouldn't be
surprised if she's a better shot

382
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,416
than either of her parents!

383
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,791
Pow!

384
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,833
[NATSU, LUCY, ASCA]
We're back!

385
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,541
Gotta say, you guys
have impeccable timing!

386
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,000
They're just about to put the
finishing touches on the cake!

387
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,250
We have cake?

388
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,791
Yeah, I almost
forgot about that!

389
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,000
Welcome back!

390
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,500
So have they finished
making my cake yet?

391
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,291
Almost!

392
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,458
[ERZA] No, not there yet!

393
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,041
These cakes
won't be Fiore's finest

394
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,583
unless the cream
instantly melts in your mouth!

395
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,041
We can't give up till
we've reached that goal!

396
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,416
We're working on it, boss!

397
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,375
I mean, uh, Miss Erza!

398
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,250
Well, will this be good enough?

399
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,916
Let's see...
I'll give it a taste-test.

400
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,083
It's melting splendidly!

401
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,375
This flavor mixed with the
Maximum Sweet Strawberry

402
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,208
may prove too much for
my tastebuds to handle!

403
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,000
All right! Prepare for plating!

404
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:15,708
I'm so happy that we
actually finished it in time!

405
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,333
[ERZA] Now, Asca,
will you do the honors?

406
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,791
Oh, this looks so amazing!

407
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,250
Hurry up and eat it
before it starts to melt away!

408
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,125
Just go on and shove it in!

409
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,333
That's the yummiest!

410
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,958
Oh, I'm so relieved
that you like it, Asca!

411
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,291
You deserve it
for all your work today!

412
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,458
[ERZA] Mmmm. That's nice.

413
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:41,125
So it was yummy.
Huh. That's good to know.

414
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,333
I can practically
imagine the flavor.

415
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,708
[laughing nervously]

416
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,083
I knew it.

417
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,791
She really just wanted
some for herself all along.

418
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,125
[ASCA] Mommy! Daddy!

--Hey there, darlin'!
--Hey there, darlin'!

00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,375
So were you a good girl?

00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,458
[ASCA] Yeah!

423
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,125
[BISCA]
We got you a little present!

424
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,291
Really?
Thank you so much!

425
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,208
And I have a
present for you, too.

426
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,416
Hey, thanks again, Natsu.

427
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,958
I appreciate you
lookin' after the kiddo.

428
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,375
It's cool. We had
a really awesome time!

429
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,458
Until that horrible
thing happened at the end.

430
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,416
I got this present for you.

431
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,583
No way...

432
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,750
How in the heck
did you get that?

433
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,000
With her own money.

434
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,458
She went on a
couple of jobs with us.

435

Yep!

436
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,625
Oh, it was nothing
dangerous though, really!

437
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,458
[ALZACK, BISCA chuckling]

438
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,250
This here was the
reward from the first job

439
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,375
Bisca and I went on together.

440
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,583
It meant a lot to us.

441
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,083
Sure is pretty.

442
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,541
Gorgeous.

443
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,291
Well if the thing's
that important,

444
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,625
why'd you end up selling it?

445
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,958
Something more
important came up.

446
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,000
This brings back some memories!

447
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,250
You sold it 'cause
you didn't want it?

448
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,708
No, sugar.

449
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,583
We sold it because it
was the only choice we had.

450
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:10,875
Huh?

451
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,250
You'll understand
one of these days, punkin'.

452
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,083
[ALZACK] Let's head on home!

453
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,458
[ASCA] Okay!

454
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,958
Thanks again, you guys.
It really means a lot to us.

455
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,458
We appreciate it.

456
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,625
[ASCA] Bye!

457
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,958
Let's do more jobs
together sometime, okay?

458
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,250
Yeah, sure! Sounds like fun!

459
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:32,458
[ASCA] Hey, guess what!
Natsu and Happy kissed!

460
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,083
[ALZACK]
Wow! I knew they were close.

461
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,291
[laughing]

462
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,375
[BISCA] This takes me back.

463
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:49,333
[ALZACK] Yeah. Our baby.
Fast asleep while the two of us

464
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,750
were talkin' about
how much we loved her.

465
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,583
Let's just borrow the
money from our guildmates!

466
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,500
I ain't gonna
ask them for money!

467
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:05,625
What then?
We can't afford her medicine!

468
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:10,791
Just hang on.

469
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,458
Please, darlin'.

470
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,958
Memories are nice, I guess.

471
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,083
But we can make
a lot more of those.

472
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,875
We gotta do it for her!

473
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,166
\Please get better.

474
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,416

gonna be here for ya',
sweetheart.

[HAPPY] Hey, Natsu.

477
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,166
Does the number four hundred
thirteen mean anything to you?

478
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,416
[NATSU] No, why?

479
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,791
[HAPPY] Because earlier
I heard Juvia singing,

00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,625
"today is day
four hundred and thirteen!"

481
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:22,916
[NATSU]
I guess it's something special.

482
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,916
[HAPPY] Oh!

483
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,125
Maybe it's a day
when you gotta eat

484
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:26,666
four hundred-thirteen fish,
or something!

485
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,833
[NATSU] Naw, probably not!

486
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:29,375
[HAPPY] I got it!

487
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:31,666
It's a day when you eat four
hundred-thirteen types of fish!

488
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,541
[NATSU] You're
really reachin' there, bro!

489
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:36,791
[HAPPY, NATSU]
Next Time: 413 Days!

490
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,125
Well, then what kind of
fish-eating day is it?

491
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:41,083
[NATSU] Just let go
of the fish idea.
