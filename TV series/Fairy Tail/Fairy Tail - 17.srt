1
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:19,791
- HEY, GUYS.  READY FOR
SOME MORE "FAIRY TAIL"?

2
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,708
JUST MAKE SURE THAT 
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,375
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE ROOM.

4
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:25,166
AND DON'T SIT TOO CLOSE
TO THE TV.

5
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,791
- Happy:
PREVIOUSLY ON "FAIRY TAIL"...

6
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,250
- Lucy:
GRAY, ARE YOU CRYING?

7
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,208
- Happy: WE FOUND OUT
GRAY'S MASTER UR

8
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,291
USED A SPELL THAT
TURNED HER BODY INTO ICE

9
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,375
TO SEAL AWAY
THE DEMON DELIORA.

10
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,416
HE DEFEATED
HIS CHILDHOOD RIVAL LYON

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,375
WHO'S DETERMINED
TO RESURRECT THE DEMON.

12
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:41,666
BUT IS IT TOO LATE?

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,083
- Gray: THEY DID IT.

14
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:45,208
THEY ACTUALLY REVIVED IT.

15
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,375
- ( theme music playing )

16
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,291
- ( roars )

17
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:27,916
- ( screaming )

18
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,750
- ( gasps )
- FINALLY! 

19
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,500
THE MOMENT IS HERE.

20
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,333
- WHAT THE HECK
WAS THAT NOISE?

21
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,875
IT SOUNDED LIKE SOME
KIND OF MONSTER GROWLING.

22
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,125
- IT WAS PROBABLY
JUST YOUR STOMACH, LUCY.

23
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:47,125
- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT HALF
AS FUNNY AS YOU THINK YOU ARE.

24
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,958
- SO DO YOU THINK THAT SOUND
MIGHT HAVE BEEN DELIORA?

25
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,500
- OH, NO.  YOU MEAN...

26
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,916
THEY BROUGHT IT
BACK TO LIFE?! 

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,958
( gasps )

28
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,291
- SEE THAT PURPLE LIGHT?

29
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,333
THAT'S THE MOON DRIP.

30
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,166
- ( Deliora roars )

31
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,208
- IT MUST BE.

32
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,208
- HEY, YOU NEED
TO EAT SOMETHING.

33
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,708
- AND YOU NEED TO SHUT
YOUR TRAP BEFORE I HURT YOU.

34
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,375
- THAT MAY BE
THE DEMON GROWLING,

35
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,541
BUT SOMEONE'S
STILL PERFORMING

36
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,125
THE MOON DRIP CEREMONY UP THERE.

37
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,125
WHICH MEANS THEY HAVEN'T
FULLY REVIVED IT YET.

38
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,125
SO WE STILL HAVE
A CHANCE TO DO SOMETHING.

39
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,541
COME ON.

40
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,166
- DELIORA'S BELOW US.

41
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,666
- PUTTING A STOP
TO THE CEREMONY 

42
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,125
IS OUR ONLY HOPE.
WE'VE GOT TO HURRY!

43
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,750
- ( chuckles )

44
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,166
- OH, MAN.

45
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,416
I'M WASTING MY TIME ON YOU.

46
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,500
LET'S FINISH THIS
RIGHT NOW.

47
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,291
( grunts )

48
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,916
- READY WHEN YOU ARE.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,125
GO AHEAD AND DO YOUR WORST,
LITTLE SALAMANDER.

50
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,583
- WHY YOU!

51
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,875
( shouts )

52
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:55,750
( grunts )

53
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,458
BUT I BROKE IT, RIGHT?

54
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,750
- I HAVE THE ABILITY TO
CONTROL AN OBJECT'S TIME.

55
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,500
MEANING I CAN TAKE
THE CRYSTAL BACK IN TIME

56
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,375
TO BEFORE IT WAS BROKEN.

57
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,625
- WHAT KIND OF MAGIC 
GIVES YOU THAT POWER?

58
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,208
- I PRACTICE ONE OF
THE LOST MAGICS

59
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,708
CALLED THE ARC OF TIME.

60
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,958
IT'S EXTREMELY RARE
AND QUITE POWERFUL.

61
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,583
WOULD YOU LIKE TO
SEE WHAT HAPPENS 

62
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,375
WHEN I THROW THIS
CRYSTAL BALL INTO THE FUTURE?

63
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,625
- ( shouting )

64
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,875
( grunts )

65
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,500
AAH!

66
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,291
- YOUR FIRE WON'T HELP YOU.

67
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,875
- OH YEAH?

68
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,250
IT STOPPED IN MIDAIR.

69
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,041
- YES.  I ALSO
HAVE THE ABILITY

70
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,375
TO FREEZE
AN OBJECT IN TIME.

71
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:44,625
- NICE TRICK.

72
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:45,791
BUT I'D BE MORE IMPRESSED

73
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,666
IF IT WORKED ON PEOPLE.

74
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,250
- AH, THAT'S THE RUB.
IT'S POWERLESS ON LIVING THINGS.

75
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,250
SINCE UR TURNED HERSELF
INTO THE ICE

76
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,083
THAT ENCASES DELIORA,

77
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,500
I CANNOT SIMPLY TURN BACK
THE TIME ON THAT ICE

78
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,083
TO ITS PRE-FROZEN STATE.

79
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,958
THAT'S WHY WE'RE
USING MOON DRIP.

80
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,500
- LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

81
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,541
WHY ARE YOU GUYS DOING THIS?

82
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,666
IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE
YOU'RE WORKING HARD

83
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,250
TRYING TO
REVIVE THIS DEMON

84
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,666
JUST SO LYON CAN KILL IT
TO BOOST HIS EGO.

85
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,250
THAT'S GREAT
FOR HIM AND ALL,

86
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,291
BUT WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA GET OUT OF IT?

87
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,750
- I CAN'T SAY.

88
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,583
I'VE ONLY
RECENTLY JOINED THEM

89
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,958
SO I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH
TO SPEAK ON THE OTHER'S BEHALF.

90
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,083
- OKAY, WHAT ABOUT YOU THEN?

91
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,916
WHAT'S YOUR GOAL
IN ALL OF THIS? 

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,166
- YOU CERTAINLY KNOW HOW TO
GET STRAIGHT TO THE POINT.

93
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,291
( laughs )

94
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:33,541
THE COLD EMPEROR LYON
IS AN ARROGANT TWIT. 

95
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,708
HE DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST DELIORA.

96
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,291
THAT'S WHERE I COME IN.

97
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,375
- IF HE CAN'T KILL IT, 
WE'RE IN MAJOR TROUBLE.

98
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,125
UNLESS YOU'RE GONNA
DEFEAT IT YOURSELF.

99
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,291
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

100
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,500
I WANT TO CONTROL THE DEMON.

101
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:49,041
YOU SEE, THERE ARE SPELLS
THAT GIVE THE CASTER

102
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:52,541
POWER OVER IMMORTAL MONSTERS
LIKE THIS ONE HERE.

103
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,208
WITH A SINGLE SPELL,
I'D BECOME THE MOST 

104
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,791
POWERFUL
MAN IN THE WORLD,

105
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,875
BECAUSE I'D HAVE A DEMON
AT MY BECK AND CALL.

106
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,875
- TALK ABOUT A LAME ANSWER.

107
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,708
I'M SORRY I EVEN ASKED.

108
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,208
- ( gasps )

109
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,708
- THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE AFTER?

110
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,125
YOU THINK JUST
HAVING A MONSTER'S

111
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,583
GONNA MAKE YOU TOUGH?
NO WAY.

112
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,333
- ( laughs )

113
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:14,000
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE TOO YOUNG
TO UNDERSTAND RIGHT NOW,

114
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,750
BUT ONE DAY YOU'LL REALIZE
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS

115
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,000
TO HAVE POWER ON YOUR SIDE.

116
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:23,583
- WELL I'VE ALREADY GOT
PLENTY OF POWER ON MY SIDE.

117
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,750
'CAUSE ALL OF MY FRIENDS
AT FAIRY TAIL HAVE GOT MY BACK.

118
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:30,000
- IF YOU LET YOUR COCKINESS
GET THE BEST OF YOU,

119
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,875
YOU WILL FALL EXACTLY
LIKE THE CEILING ABOVE YOU!

120
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,916
- I'VE HAD ENOUGH
OF YOU AND YOUR BUDDIES

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,291
SCREWING THINGS UP FOR
THE PEOPLE ON THIS ISLAND.

122
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:43,458
IT'S TIME I PUT
A STOP TO IT!

123
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:46,583
- YOU DON'T SERIOUSLY BELIEVE
YOU CAN STOP MY ARC OF TIME

124
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,333
WITH YOUR PUNY FLAMES,
DO YOU?

125
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,375
- I DON'T GIVE A CRAP
ABOUT YOUR STUPID MAGIC.

126
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,375
I JUST WANT YOU 
OFF THIS ISLAND!

127
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,208
I MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO CONTROL TIME, 

128
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,416
BUT I CAN SEE THE FUTURE.

129
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,250
AND I SEE...

130
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,458
ME KICKING YOUR BUTT

131
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,750
AND SENDING YOU FLYING!

132
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,708
- ( screams )

133
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,000
- OHH!

134
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,625
- AWESOME.  THE MOON DRIP
SHOULD STOP ANY MINUTE NOW.

135
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:24,750
- YOU MEAN THIS GUY WAS
DOING IT ALL BY HIMSELF?

136
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,375
- TOO LATE!  IT'S OVER.

137
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,125
THE CEREMONY'S
ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED.

138
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,125
- HUH?

139
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:34,875
- ( roars )

140
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,791
- WHOA.  NO WAY.

141
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,708
- ( roars )

142
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,166
- WHAT'S THIS?

143
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,833
SOMETHING TRULY TERRIBLE
HAS HAPPENED.

144
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,666
- WE HAVE TO GET
OFF THE ISLAND, CHIEF.

145
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,083
- I'M STAYING.
YOU AND THE OTHERS CAN GO,

146
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,416
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO
LEAVE THIS PLACE BEHIND.

147
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,750
-  ( roars )

148
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,208
- THANK YOU.

149
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,875
- HEY.

150
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,875
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- NATSU?

151
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,833
- THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
WE CAN DO NOW.

152
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,708
WE GOTTA TAKE
THAT THING DOWN.

153
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,250
- ( groans )

154
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,875
NEITHER ONE OF YOU
ARE STRONG ENOUGH.

155
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,541
BUT I AM.

156
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,750
I WILL DEFEAT IT.

157
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,041
- LYON.

158
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:38,291
- I'M GOING TO
SURPASS UR FINALLY.

159
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,583
( laughs )

160
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,166
- YOU CAN'T FIGHT.

161
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,958
YOU CAN'T EVEN GET UP
OFF THE FLOOR.

162
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:46,958
- ( roars )

163
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:50,750
- I'VE WAITED SO LONG
FOR THIS MOMENT.

164
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,041
- YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
THE MOST POWERFUL WIZARD?

165
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,875
WELL, I'D SAY UR'S GOT TO BE
THE STRONGEST AROUND HERE.

166
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,458
SHE'S BEEN HOLED UP
IN THE MOUNTAINS

167
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,333
EVER SINCE SHE LOST HER
DAUGHTER A FEW YEARS BACK.

168
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,333
BUT I SWEAR I'VE NEVER
MET ANOTHER WIZARD

169
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,458
AS SKILLED AS SHE IS.

170
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,333
- WOW.  UR.

171
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,916
DO YOU THINK SHE'LL
TEACH ME MAGIC?

172
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,500
SHE WAS STRONG.

173
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,500
BUT STILL NOT STRONG ENOUGH
TO KILL THAT DEMON.

174
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,083
( grunts )

175
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,750
I'M GOING TO DO THE ONE THING
UR NEVER COULD.

176
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,083
IT'S BAD ENOUGH
YOU TOOK THAT PUNK IN,

177
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,166
BUT NOW YOU'RE
TEACHING HIM MAGIC TOO?

178
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,916
- HE TOLD ME
HE WANTED TO LEARN.

179
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,583
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

180
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,750
- YOU DON'T NEED HIM.
YOU'VE ALREADY GOT ME

181
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,125
TO TAKE THE PLACE
OF YOUR DAUGHTER.

182
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,250
( gasps )

183
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,958
- LYON,

184
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,791
LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT.

185
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,375
I'VE NEVER ONCE
THOUGHT OF YOU 

186
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,291
AS A REPLACEMENT
FOR MY DAUGHTER.

187
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,958
YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE.

188
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,166
YOU'RE MY ADORABLE STUDENT.

189
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,125
- FINALLY.

190
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,541
MY DREAM WILL BE FULFILLED!

191
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,916
- YOU'VE CAUSED
ENOUGH TROUBLE.

192
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,958
I'LL CLEAN UP
THE MESS YOU'VE MADE.

193
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:12,958
I'LL SEAL THE DEMON MYSELF.

194
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,875
ICED SHELL!

195
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,833
- DON'T DO IT, GRAY!

196
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,500
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW LONG IT TOOK ME 

197
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,750
TO MELT THAT ICE?

198
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,958
SEALING IT AGAIN
ISN'T GOING TO STOP ME.

199
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:30,291
I WILL NOT REST UNTIL
I'VE FINALLY DEFEATED DELIORA!

200
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,708
- I CAN'T WORRY
ABOUT THE FUTURE.

201
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,416
I HAVE TO DO THIS
TO KEEP IT FROM

202
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,041
KILLING US ALL RIGHT NOW!

203
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,791
NATSU!

204
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,333
- ( gasps )

205
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,375
- WHY DON'T YOU
LET ME HANDLE THIS?

206
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,833
- DON'T BE STUPID.

207
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,500
JUST GET OUT OF MY WAY!

208
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,458
- IF I DIDN'T
LET YOU DO IT BEFORE,

209
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,958
WHY WOULD I
LET YOU DO IT NOW?

210
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,958
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU
GO OUT LIKE THAT.

211
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,875
GO AHEAD AND CAST THE SPELL.

212
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,958
BUT I'M NOT MOVING.

213
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,625
- ( gasps )

214
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,916
NATSU...

215
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,708
- ( roars )

216
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,041
- IT'S SO LOUD!
IT'S GONNA BUST MY EAR!

217
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,583
- ( both scream )

218
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,625
- NATSU!

219
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,000
- I'M NOT GIVING UP 
TILL THE BITTER END!

220
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,458
( shouts )

221
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,166
- ( gasps )

222
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,375
- ( roars )

223
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,083
- ( gasps )
WHAT THE--?

224
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,750
I'M STRONGER THAN I THOUGHT.

225
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,625
- WHAT?  NO WAY.

226
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,416
BUT THAT CAN'T BE!

227
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:19,000
- ( gasps )

228
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,083
- DELIORA...

229
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:26,083
WAS ALREADY DEAD.

230
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,541
- WHOA, WHAT'S GOING ON?

231
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,000
- I DON'T KNOW.

232
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,208
- FOR 10 YEARS...

233
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:50,958
UR HAS GRADUALLY DEPLETED
THE DEMON'S LIFE FORCE.

234
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,375
AND WHAT WE JUST SAW

235
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:57,125
WAS NOTHING MORE THAN
ITS LAST DYING BREATHS.

236
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,041
( crying )

237
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:05,125
MY DREAM IS DEAD.
THERE'S NO HOPE NOW.

238
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:08,250
I WILL NEVER SURPASS UR.

239
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,166
- MAN.

240
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,541
YOUR TEACHER WAS
PRETTY AWESOME. 

241
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,166
- Ur: I'VE FREED YOU
FROM THE DARKNESS, GRAY.

242
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,708
I'VE SEALED IT
AWAY FOREVER. 

243
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,000
- ( crying )

244
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:26,833
YOU'VE SAVED MY LIFE AGAIN.

245
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,291
THANK YOU, UR.

246
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,041
- ( chuckles )

247
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,166
- Lucy:
THE ICE THAT WAS ONCE UR

248
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,000
MELTED AND BECAME WATER

249
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,125
THAT FLOWED INTO
THE OPEN SEA.

250
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:46,583
EVEN THOUGH SHE'S NOT
PHYSICALLY WITH US,

251
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,500
GRAY SAYS SHE'S
STILL ALIVE.

252
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,708
AND I THINK HE'S RIGHT.

253
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,375
FROM THE SEA,
SHE'LL BE ABLE TO

254
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,625
WATCH OVER HER
BELOVED STUDENTS FOREVER.

255
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,625
I CAN ALMOST
HEAR HER SAYING...

256
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,125
"PLEASE DON'T FIGHT ANYMORE."

257
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:13,208
- OH YEAH!
THAT'S RIGHT.  WE WON!

258
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,166
- AYE, SIR!

259
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,791
- YOU KNOW,

260
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,250
I WAS KINDA WORRIED
FOR A WHILE THERE.

261
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,250
BUT IT ALL WORKED OUT
THANKS TO YOUR AMAZING TEACHER.

262
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,208
- WE TOTALLY FINISHED
AN S-CLASS QUEST

263
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:27,208
 ALL BY OURSELVES!
- ( all laughing )

264
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:31,083
- YOU THINK MASTER MAKAROV WILL
LET US IN THE SECOND FLOOR NOW?

265
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,708
OH NO!

266
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,916
YOU'RE STILL GONNA
PUNISH US, HUH?

267
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,583
- ISN'T THERE SOMETHING THAT
YOU'RE ALL FORGETTING ABOUT?

268
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,083
YOU CAME TO THIS ISLAND
TO HELP THE VILLAGERS. 

269
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,958
THE REQUEST WAS
FOR YOU TO RETURN THEM

270
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,083
TO THEIR ORIGINAL FORMS.

271
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,500
- ( gasps )

272
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,666
- YOU STILL HAVEN'T COMPLETED
YOUR S-CLASS QUEST YET.

273
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,583
- BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

274
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:56,666
THE CURSE SHOULD BE LIFTED NOW
'CAUSE DELIORA'S DEAD.

275
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,250
- WRONG.  THIS CURSE
YOU KEEP TALKING ABOUT

276
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,458
NEVER HAD ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THE DEMON.

277
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,666
THE VILLAGERS HAVE BEEN
AFFECTED BY THE INTENSE

278
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,250
MAGIC ENERGY RELEASED
FROM THE MOON DRIP SPELL.

279
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,666
IN OTHER WORDS, DELIORA'S DEATH
ISN'T GOING TO CHANGE

280
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,958
THEIR CURRENT SITUATION
WHATSOEVER.

281
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,750
- WHAT-- OH NO.

282
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,958
- WELL, THEN WE'D BETTER
GO AND CHANGE THEM BACK.

283
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,791
- AYE, SIR!

284
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,541
- YEAH, BUT WE 
DON'T KNOW HOW.

285
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,333
LYON.  DO YOU KNOW?

286
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,583
- TO BE QUITE HONEST,
I DON'T HAVE A CLUE. 

287
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,291
- YOU DON'T KNOW?
- WHAT?

288
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,125
- BUT THEY TOLD US
THE CURSE STARTED 

289
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,291
ABOUT THE SAME TIME
YOU GUYS GOT HERE. 

290
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:35,125
- WHEN WE FIRST ARRIVED
THREE YEARS AGO,

291
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,458
WE WERE AWARE THAT THERE WAS
A VILLAGE SOMEWHERE

292
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,416
ON THIS ISLAND.

293
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,291
BUT WE HAD
ABSOLUTELY NO REASON

294
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,625
TO COMMUNICATE
WITH THE VILLAGERS,

295
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,125
SO WE LEFT THEM ALONE.

296
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,708
AND THEY NEVER
CAME TO THE TEMPLE

297
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,208
TO SEE WHAT WE WERE UP TO.

298
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,958
- IN THREE YEARS

299
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,333
YOU'VE NEVER ONCE MET?

300
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,833
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

301
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,708
THE LIGHT FROM THE MOON DRIP
IS SO BRIGHT

302
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,833
YOU CAN SEE IT FROM PRACTICALLY
ANYWHERE ON THE ISLAND.

303
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,916
IT'S KINDA WEIRD THAT
THEY SAW IT EVERY NIGHT

304
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,166
AND NEVER WENT 
TO INVESTIGATE.

305
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,750
- THE VILLAGERS WEREN'T
TRANSFORMED BY THE MOON DRIP.

306
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,416
IT DOESN'T AFFECT
THE HUMAN BODY.

307
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,750
- WHAT?
- YEAH, RIGHT.

308
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,916
YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT
SO YOU AND YOUR LACKEYS

309
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,916
WILL BE OFF THE HOOK.

310
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,416
- JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

311
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,583
I'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO IT
AS LONG AS THEY HAVE

312
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,625
AND MY APPEARANCE
HASN'T CHANGED ONE BIT.

313
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,166
- OH YEAH.  THAT'S TRUE.

314
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,750
- I WOULDN'T TRUST THEM.

315
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,166
THOSE VILLAGERS ARE
HIDING SOMETHING.

316
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,833
BUT I'M SURE YOU
GUILD WIZARDS CAN HANDLE IT.

317
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,333
- WE'RE NOT DONE WITH YOU.

318
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,583
YOU DESTROYED THE VILLAGE--

319
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:32,083
- THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH,
NATSU.

320
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:36,125
- YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW
WHY WE ALL JOINED LYON?

321
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:39,083
ALL BECAUSE ALL OUR FAMILIES
WERE KILLED BY DELIORA.

322
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,791
AND WE WANTED TO
GET REVENGE.

323
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,375
HE CONVINCED US THAT
IF WE HELPED HIM

324
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,375
RELEASE THE DEMON,
HE WOULD KILL IT. 

325
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,125
THAT IT WOULD BE
GONE FOREVER.

326
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:53,208
- THEY WERE SIMPLY DOING
WHAT THEY BELIEVED TO BE RIGHT.

327
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,875
SO THERE'S NO NEED
TO CRITICIZE THEM FOR IT.

328
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,208
LET'S GO.
- BUT...

329
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,041
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
TO LIFT THE CURSE?

330
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,833
- Erza: I HAVE NO IDEA.
- Lucy: OH, GREAT.

331
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,875
- ( gasps )

332
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,666
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

333
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,791
- I KNOW YOU DON'T
WANT TO HEAR IT,

334
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,875
BUT YOU REALLY SHOULD
JOIN A GUILD.

335
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,625
YOU MAKE NEW FRIENDS,
MEET NEW RIVALS,

336
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,333
AND MAYBE EVEN FIND
A NEW DREAM TO LIVE FOR.

337
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,833
- ( gasps )
WHATEVER.

338
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,791
JUST GET OUT OF HERE.

339
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,708
- THAT'S WEIRD.
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

340
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,833
- ARE YOU SURE 
THEY CAME HERE?

341
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,833
- YEAH, THIS HAS
BEEN THEIR CAMP.

342
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,208
I WONDER WHERE
THEY COULD HAVE GONE.

343
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,416
- HELLO?!

344
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,416
- SINCE WE'RE HERE,
I'M GONNA GRAB BANDAGES

345
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,958
AND SOME MEDICINE.

346
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,250
- YOU FINALLY MADE IT BACK.

347
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,333
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO SEE. 

348
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,750
PLEASE, FOLLOW ME
TO THE VILLAGE.

349
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,375
- ( excited chatter )

350
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,166
- WHOA. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

351
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,833
- YESTERDAY IT WAS
A TOTAL MESS,

352
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,333
BUT NOW IT LOOKS PERFECT.

353
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,875
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

354
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,875
EVERYTHING'S BACK
TO HOW IT WAS.

355
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,875
IT'S LIKE THE VILLAGE
WENT BACK IN TIME.

356
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,291
- NOW THAT IT'S FIXED,

357
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,291
YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
TOUCH ANYTHING,

358
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,750
'KAY, NATSU?

359
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,958
- ARE YOU SAYING
I DESTROY EVERYTHING I TOUCH?!

360
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,291
- WELL, KINDA.

361
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,125
- BACK IN TIME.

362
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,541
- ( laughs )

363
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,291
- WAS IT HIM?

364
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,708
NAH, IT COULDN'T BE.

365
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,500
UNLESS HE HAD
A CHANGE OF HEART.

366
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,875
AH, WHO CARES.
- NOT ME.

367
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,458
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

368
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,708
OH, I FORGOT
ABOUT OUR STUFF.

369
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,458
Lucy:
BOBO'S GRAVE IS BACK.

370
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,041
I'M SO GLAD.

371
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,250
AND I'M SURE THE CHIEF
MUST BE RELIEVED.

372
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,750
- YOU AND YOUR
WIZARD FRIENDS USED MAGIC

373
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,916
TO RESTORE OUR VILLAGE,
DIDN'T YOU?

374
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,333
- UH WELL, SIR,
THAT'S NOT--

375
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:56,250
- I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE IT.

376
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,583
HOWEVER, I MUST KNOW

377
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,625
WHEN ARE YOU WIZARDS
FINALLY GOING TO

378
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,833
DESTROY THE MOON FOR US? WELL?!

379
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,333
- UH...

380
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,916
- DESTROYING THE MOON 
IS A SIMPLE TASK, SIR.

381
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,916
- HUH?
- WHAT THE--?

382
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,500
DID SHE JUST SAY THAT
WITH A STRAIGHT FACE?

383
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,833
- AYE.
MAYBE SHE'S GONE CRAZY.

384
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,916
- Erza: BUT BEFORE I DO THAT,
I NEED TO ASK YOU ALL

385
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,500
A FEW QUESTIONS.

386
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,500
WOULD YOU BE SO KIND
AS TO CALL EVERYONE TOGETHER

387
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,166
FOR A MEETING?

388
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,208
LET ME MAKE SURE
I HAVE MY FACTS STRAIGHT.

389
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,208
THE FIRST TIME
EVERYBODY IN THE VILLAGE

390
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,791
TOOK ON THESE DEMONIC FORMS

391
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,791
IS WHEN THE MOON
BEGAN TO TURN PURPLE.

392
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,958
IS THAT CORRECT?
- YES.

393
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,375
DURING THE DAY, WE'RE FINE,

394
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,791
BUT WHEN THE MOON COMES OUT

395
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,041
WE TRANSFORM INTO
WHAT YOU SEE NOW.

396
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,958
- AND THE MOON
FIRST TURNED PURPLE

397
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,208
ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO,
RIGHT?

398
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,958
- WOW, HAS IT REALLY
BEEN THAT LONG?

399
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,541
- YEAH.

400
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,541
- WE'VE LEARNED THAT
THE MOON DRIP CEREMONY

401
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,541
HAS BEEN PERFORMED
ON THIS ISLAND EVERY NIGHT

402
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,291
FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS.

403
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,625
AND EACH NIGHT IT PRODUCED
A BEAM OF LIGHT SO BRILLIANT

404
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,708
THAT YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY
HAVE MISSED IT.

405
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,166
( yelps )

406
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,875
- WHOA.  EVEN LUCY'S 
PITFALL TRAP IS BACK.

407
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,750
- SHE SCREAMED
LIKE A GIRL.

408
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,583
- YEAH.
AND IT WAS CUTE.

409
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,083
- I'M SO GONNA BE
DEAD MEAT WHEN SHE GETS OUT.

410
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,250
- SERIOUSLY.

411
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,583
DIDN'T YOU EVER WONDER WHERE
THAT LIGHT WAS COMING FROM? 

412
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,750
- SHE GOT UP LIKE
NOTHING HAPPENED.

413
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,375
- SHE MUST BE PRETTY TOUGH.

414
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,833
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

415
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,791
WHY DIDN'T ANYONE
INVESTIGATE?

416
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,875
- ( all murmuring )

417
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,500
- WELL, WE WOULD HAVE
LOOKED INTO IT,

418
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,000
BUT ACCORDING TO
VILLAGE LORE,

419
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,500
OUR PEOPLE MUST NEVER
GO NEAR THAT TEMPLE. 

420
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,250
- BUT WHO CARES ABOUT
VILLAGE LORE

421
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,000
WHEN YOUR OWN PEOPLE
ARE DYING?

422
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,000
YOU OBVIOUSLY KNEW 
THERE WAS A PROBLEM

423
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,208
'CAUSE YOU CONTACTED
THE MAGIC GUILDS.

424
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,000
- OH WELL...

425
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,875
- WHY DON'T YOU TELL US
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON HERE?

426
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,875
- TO BE HONEST, WE DON'T EVEN
KNOW THAT OURSELVES.

427
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,625
ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN.

428
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:55,041
WE'VE TRIED TO INVESTIGATE
THE LIGHT MANY TIMES.

429
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,625
WE'D TAKE UP WEAPONS
WE'VE NEVER HAD TO USE.

430
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,208
I'D TRIM AND STYLE
MY SIDEBURNS,

431
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,958
AND THEN WE'D VENTURE INTO
THE JUNGLE TOWARDS THE TEMPLE.

432
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,625
BUT WE COULD NEVER
GET NEAR IT.

433
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,875
WE'D GET CLOSE ENOUGH THAT WE
COULD SEE IT THROUGH THE TREES,

434
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,250
AND THEN SUDDENLY WE'D
FIND OURSELVES BACK

435
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,958
AT THE VILLAGE GATES.

436
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:17,625
- BUT HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE?
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

437
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,791
- WE GOT INTO THE TEMPLE
WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM AT ALL.

438
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,125
HOW WEIRD.

439
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,875
- WE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
TO YOU EARLIER,

440
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,458
BECAUSE WE WERE WORRIED
THAT YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE US.

441
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,208
- WE'RE TELLING YOU
THE TRUTH.

442
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,416
WE'VE TRIED TO GO BACK
TO THE TEMPLE MANY TIMES.

443
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,833
- BUT NOT A SINGLE VILLAGER

444
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,666
HAS EVER BEEN ABLE
TO GET INSIDE.

445
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,458
- I GET IT.  YES.

446
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,500
- ( gasps )

447
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:40,083
- ( chuckles )

448
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,958
IMPRESSIVE, TITANIA.

449
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:45,500
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
IT WOULDN'T TAKE YOU LONG

450
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,916
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

451
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,625
( chuckles )

452
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,583
- Erza: NATSU?

453
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,833
COME WITH ME.

454
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:06,625
I'LL NEED YOUR HELP 
TO DESTROY THE MOON.

455
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:10,125
- ( laughs )
- ( all gasp )

456
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,083
- ( theme music playing )

457
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:19,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

458
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:50,041
- Happy: PROFESSOR HAPPY'S
CLASS ABOUT "FAIRY TAIL." 

459
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:53,791
YAY! TODAY I'M GONNA TEACH YOU
ABOUT CELESTIAL SPIRITS.

460
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,625
THE NUMBER OF TIMES
A CELESTIAL WIZARD 

461
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:57,791
CAN SUMMON A SPIRIT
DEPENDS ON THEIR CONTRACT

462
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:59,708
AND THE AMOUNT OF
TRUST BETWEEN THE TWO.

463
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:01,791
ALSO, WHENEVER
A WIZARD GETS STRONGER,

464
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,875
THEIR SPIRITS BECOME
MORE POWERFUL AS WELL.

465
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,958
NEW CELESTIAL SPIRITS
SHOW UP ALL THE TIME,

466
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:07,375
SO BE ON THE LOOKOUT.

467
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:08,958
THAT'S TODAY'S CLASS.

468
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:11,541
DISMISSED!  AYE!

469
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:14,583
HEY, NATSU, DID YOU KNOW

470
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,666
THERE ARE ACTUALLY CATS
LIVING ON THE MOON?

471
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,000
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT.

472
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,500
- IT'S TRUE.
AND IT SOUNDS LIKE

473
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,000
THEY HAVE A LOT OF FUN TOO.

474
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:23,416
THEY SPEND ALL DAY
PLAYING IN CRATERS

475
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,750
AND EATING FISH.

476
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:26,250
I REALLY WANT TO
CHECK IT OUT.

477
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:27,583
- SORRY, PAL,
BUT I DON'T THINK

478
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,083
THERE'S ANY FISH
ON THE MOON.

479
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:30,125
- WHAT?!

480
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,000
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THE MOON DOESN'T HAVE FISH?

481
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:36,416
YOU'VE BEEN THERE?
- NO,

482
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,333
BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE FISH
WITHOUT WATER.

483
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:41,291
- AW, MAN. I WAS LOOKING
FORWARD TO SOME MOON FISH.
