00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,875
[laughs nervously]

312
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,416
Such is life.
But remember that failure

313
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,833
is the great teacher!

314
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:24,291
Learn its lessons, and the
rewards will be everlasting.

315
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,875
[EVE and REN] Right! We look
forward to learning, Maestro!

316
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,083
Aw, come on, cute stuff,
don't be like that!

317
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,041
I can cheer you up tonight
if you really want me to.

318
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,333
[HIBIKI] I don't think
I can wait that long.

319
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,041
--[MATO] Excuse me.
--I need comforting now!

320
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:37,083
[CHAPATI] Next up is
Obra of Raven Tail!

321
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,125
He's the one!

322
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,083
The guy that attacked
Wendy and Carla!

323
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,208
That scoundrel!

324
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,000
Another Raven, huh?

325
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:46,125
I wonder what kind
of magic he'll use.

326
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,083
[CHAPATI] Obra clocks
in at... four points?

327
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,041
[NATSU] Huh?

328
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,291
[GRAY] Is this some kinda joke?

329
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,541
Anyone buy that?

330
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,041
No.

331
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,625
I know you want to watch,
but you should really be in bed.

332
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,458
[MATO] Uh...
I'm very sorry,

333
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,291
but I'm afraid we can't
allow any do-overs.

334
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,791
Ah! Hey! Give that back!

335
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,291
[CANA laughing]

336
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,666
[FLARE] What an idiot!
What were you thinking, Obra?

337
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,416
Come on! We won't
get any points now!

338
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,666
Quiet, Flare.

339
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,458
He can't reveal his magic
in front of everyone.

340
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,166
Right. Sorry.

341
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,875
Yeah, that's one
guy you don't wanna

342
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,208
get worked up, capisce?

343
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,666
Heh. Ain't
that the truth?

344
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,666
[MATO] Okay! Millianna of
Mermaid Heel is currently in

345
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,041
the lead with three-hundred-
and-sixty-five points!

346
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,541
[MILLIANNA] Meow! This is
better than chasing my own tail!

347
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,000
[OLGA] I'm about
to change that.

348
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,250
[CROWD cheering]

349
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,333
[CHAPATI] And the crowd
goes berserk for Olga!

350
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:41,208
How will one of
Sabertooth's strongest fare?

351
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:44,291
Rip that thing to pieces and
show those twerps whose boss!

352
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,833
And do a silly dance
while you're at it!

353
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:50,791
One Twenty Millimeter
Black Lightning Cannon!

354
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,500
[BOTH] Aaahhh!

355
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,041
[CHAPATI] Whoa. It's
almost four thousand!

356
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,708
No way, he's ten
times stronger than me?

357
00:18:58,791 --> 00:18:59,666
What?

358
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,541
That number
can't be right!

359
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,375
Crazy!

360
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:06,500
[LAHAR] I've never in my
life seen a score that high!

361
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,916
Awesome! That's our
Olga! What a powerhouse!

362
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,291
--Way to go, Olga!
--I knew he'd win!

00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,666
--Way to go, Olga!
--We're the champions!

[OLGA] ♪ You other guilds
think that you're really cool ♪

366
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,708
[MATO] We could do without
the singing, okay big guy?

367
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,666
[CHAPATI] Things are really
heating up down there!

368
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,375
Can the Wizard Saint Jura
surpass that incredible score?

369
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,333
Or has Olga set the bar?

370
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,666
I really hope Jura can
beat that loud mouth.

371
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,500
Sure he can.
You should be worried

372
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,500
about whether
we'll survive it.

373
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:33,750
Huh?

374
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,083
[JURA] Do you mind
if I give it my all?

375
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,416
[MATO]
That's the game, isn't it?

376
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,541
[CHAPATI] Here he goes, folks!

377
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,208
What does Jura
have in store for us?

378
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,083
An earthquake!

379
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,833
He's giving off
intense magical pressure!

380
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,250
[JURA] Rumbling Fuji!

381
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,041
[CHAPATI] Eight thousand,
five hundred and forty-four!

382
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,375
That is absolutely mind-blowing!

383
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,625
No way!

384
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,500
He sure packs a wallop
for someone his age!

385
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,833
What the--?

386
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,416
And here I thought it
would be a little higher.

387
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,666
Wizard Saints are so
dangerously powerful I thought

388
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,750
it might be a bad idea
to let him participate,

389
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,666
but it looks like he had
everything under control

390
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,833
from the start.

391
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,291
Apparently, you were
worried for nothing

392
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:19,625
'cause that was awesome!

393
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,583
[CHAPATI] Outstanding!
This is a new MPF record!

394
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,708
Jura has proven that
the title of "Wizard Saint"

395
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,625
should never be taken lightly!

396
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,916
I knew he was
strong, but yowza!

397
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,458
He may be on the same
level as Gildarts!

398
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,000
[giggles]

399
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,875
[MAVIS] True, but let's not
forget that someone down there

400
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,791
has Gildarts' blood
running through their veins!

401
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,500
[CHAPATI] The final
challenger is Fairy Tail

402
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:42,666
Team B's Cana Alberona!

403
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,958
You're so sweet saving
the best for last.

404
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,875
[CHAPATI] I certainly
wouldn't want to follow Jura,

405
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,208
that's for sure!

406
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,666
[MATO] Alright!
Do your best, punkin!

407

She's completely plastered.

409
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,541
We'll be lucky if she
scores more than Hibiki.

410
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,625
You never know, if she
can beat Millianna,

411
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,833
then she'll
nab third place!

412

[PANTHERLILY]
Why is she stripping?

Uh. First master?

418
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:15,041
I lent it to her for
this special occasion!

419
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,125
Now she's sure to win!

[CANA] It's time to assemble!

O' river of light,
that's guided by fairies!

423

Wielding that spell is not easy.

424
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:30,000
It takes incredible
concentration and power.

Cana has both.
I know she won't fail us.

So that I may vanquish
the fangs of wickedness!

[CANA] Fairy... Glitter!

the power to wield

430
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:46,250
one of the three
Grand Fairy spells.

431
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,291
[CHAPATI] Oh my goodness!
I can't believe it,

The MPF is history!

Fairy Tail has taken
today's events by storm!

Is this their true strength?

437
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:03,458
Can anyone stop them now?

00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,250
There's no stoppin' us!

439
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,416
We've just started
to rock your world!

440
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,916
Fairy Tail will
be number one again!

[CROWD cheering]

442
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,125
[MATO] This changes everything.

443
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,958
I'll have to put a little
more thought into my plans.

444
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,791
Here's the battle
line-up, Boss.

445
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:24,125
I got a feeling you'll
find it very interesting.

446
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,291
[ALEXEI]
Yes, this one in particular.

447
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,583
It would appear there
are some true connoisseurs

448
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:30,875
among the event management.

449
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:33,000
It's about time we got started.

450
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:36,916
Raven Tail's true objective
is almost within reach.

451
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,208
[NATSU] If you're
feelin' pu-pu-pumped,

452
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:16,250
let me hear ya say, "meow!"

453
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,541
[HAPPY] Meow, meo-huh?
What are you doing?

454
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,666
[NATSU] Thinking up a
cheer song for Mini-Anna!

455
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,166
[HAPPY] Okay, first off,
her name is "Millianna."

456
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,416
Second, she's the
competition, dufus!

457
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,083
And third, why would
you think to make a song

458
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,375
in the first place?

459
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,583
[NATSU] I'm sick of
ordinary cheering.

460
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:33,666
[HAPPY and NATSU] Next time:
"Laxus versus Alexei!"

461
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,041
[NATSU] "Zip-Zap! Thunderclap!

462
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:38,583
Lightnin' up your
butt! Watch out, ya'll!"

463
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:41,125
[HAPPY] Is that supposed
to be a Laxus song?
