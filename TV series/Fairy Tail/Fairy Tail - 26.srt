1
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:20,125
HEY GUYS! READY FOR SOME
MORE FAIRY TAIL?

2
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:21,958
JUST MAKE SURE THAT WHEN
YOU'RE WATCHING

3
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,583
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS
ON IN THE ROOM

4
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,875
AND DON'T SIT TOO
CLOSE TO THE TV!

5
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,250
- PREVIOUSLY, ON FAIRY TAIL!

6
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,625
- WE GOT IN A HUGE FIGHT WITH
OUR RIVAL GUILD, PHANTOM LORD,

7
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:34,166
AND BOTH MASTER MAKAROV
AND ERZA WERE TAKEN OUT!

8
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,750
NOW THEIR MAGIC
GIANT'S ATTACKING US

9
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,041
AND THE ONLY WAY TO STOP IT

10
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,583
IS TO BEAT THEIR STRONGEST
TEAM, THE ELEMENT 4!

11
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:40,916
LUCY'S LAYING LOW
IN OUR HIDEOUT,

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
'CAUSE PHANTOM'S AFTER HER,

13
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,958
BUT IT MAY NOT BE SAFE
THERE EITHER.

14
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,041
- Loke: I GOT A BAD FEELIN'
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

15
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:58,166
- ( theme song playing )

16
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:23,708
- ( bell tolls )

17
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,291
- Elfman: SEE, LOOK AT IT NOW!

18
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,666
- Gray: YEAH, IT'S DEFINITELY
DRAWING THE MAGIC CIRCLE

19
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,791
SLOWER THAN BEFORE.

20
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,541
- Mirajane: SO WE WERE RIGHT.

21
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:35,666
- Gray: FIRE, WATER,
AIR, AND EARTH.

22
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,208
- Elfman: JUST LIKE
WE WERE SAYING,

23
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,916
THE GIANT AND THE SPELL GET
THEIR POWER FROM THE ELEMENTS.

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,500
- THAT'S THE TRUE COMBINED
POWER OF THE ELEMENT FOUR.

25
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:45,000
THREE HAVE BEEN DEFEATED.

26
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:48,125
TOTOMARU OF THE GREAT FLAME,
WAS TAKEN OUT WITH JUPITER.

27
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:51,375
ELFMAN TOTALLY ANNIHILATED
SOL OF THE EARTH.

28
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,541
AND JUVIA OF THE GREAT SEA

29
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,750
WAS TAKEN OUT OF
THE EQUATION BY GRAY.

30
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,708
- SO THERE'S ONE LEFT.

31
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:00,666
- IF WE STOP HIM WE'LL STOP THE
GIANT FROM CASTING THE SPELL!

32
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,916
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO
THE LAST ELEMENT IS?

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,291
- ARIA OF THE GREAT SKY. AND
HE'LL BE THE TOUGHEST TO BEAT.

34
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,750
HE'S THE STRONGEST MEMBER
OF THE ELEMENT 4.

35
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,416
HE'S ALSO THE ONE WHO
DRAINED THE MASTER

36
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,625
OF HIS MAGICAL ENERGY,
LEAVING HIM POWERLESS.

37
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,041
- Porlyusica: MUST BE
IMAGINING THINGS.

38
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,500
- Happy: WINGS OF FLAME!

39
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,000
- YOU'RE STILL STANDING AFTER
MY ATTACK. VERY IMPRESSIVE.

40
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:45,625
- I'M FIRED UP NOW.
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT!

41
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,000
- CAREFUL.

42
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,458
- AIRSPACE SEVER!

43
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,500
( he screams in pain )

44
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:56,291
- HE'S THE STRONGEST WIZARD
IN THE ELEMENT 4.

45
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,125
HE MIGHT BE TOO
POWERFUL EVEN FOR NATSU!

46
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,958
- THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE BETTER
THAN YOU, YOUNG DRAGON SLAYER.

47
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:08,750
- WE'LL SEE 'BOUT THAT!
FIRE DRAGON ROAR!

48
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,750
- HE'S GONE!

49
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,916
- WHERE'D HE GO?

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,916
- I SHALL END THIS WITH A GIFT.

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,333
I WILL ALLOW YOU TO JOIN YOUR
MASTER IN HIS SUFFERING.

52
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:26,083
AIRSPACE DRAIN!

53
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,125
( Natsu screams )

54
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:32,541
SO SAD! YES, BECAUSE ANY
WIZARD CAUGHT IN MY AIRSPACE

55
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:35,583
WILL BE COMPLETELY
DRAINED OF THEIR POWERS!

56
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,500
- I CAN FEEL IT! MY POWERS
ARE BEIN' SUCKED OUT!

57
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,250
- NATSU!

58
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,666
- NO. I CAN'T.

59
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,833
- ERZA!

60
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,708
- YOU'RE HERE. YOU SURE
IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO MOVE?

61
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:57,875
YOU'RE INJURED!

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,708
- SHE IS P.O'D!

63
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,625
- Erza: SO YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO HARMED OUR MASTER.

64
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:08,083
- THE GREAT ERZA SCARLET.
HOW UNFORTUNATE.

65
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,750
SEEMS THE BRILLIANT
TITANIA WILL LOSE HER HEAD

66
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,083
ALONG SIDE HER
FRIEND SALAMANDER.

67
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,541
- OUR MASTER SUFFERED
GREATLY BY YOUR HANDS.

68
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:16,833
I WILL AVENGE HIM.

69
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,041
- YOU CAN'T!

70
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,750
- WELL, NOW THAT I'M FINALLY
FACED WITH A WORTHY OPPONENT.

71
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:26,625
I GUESS IT'S TIME I START TAKING
MY BATTLES MORE SERIOUSLY.

72
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:29,666
- Gray: HIS EYES?

73
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,750
- Mirajane: YES.

74
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,375
- Gray: WHAT'S SO
SPECIAL ABOUT 'EM?

75
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,250
- Mirajane: EVIDENTLY, ARIA
KEEPS HIS EYES COVERED

76
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,916
WITH BANDAGES. HE DOES
THIS BECAUSE IT HELPS

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,791
TO CONTROL HIS
OVERWHELMING MAGICAL POWER.

78
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,250
- Elfman: SO, IT'S
ALL IN HIS EYES?

79
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,541
- THAT'S RIGHT.
SO WHEN WE FIND HIM,

80
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,041
WE HAVE TO BEAT HIM
BEFORE HE OPENS THEM

81
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,458
BECAUSE IF THAT HAPPENS,

82
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,541
WE DON'T STAND A
CHANCE AT VICTORY.

83
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:53,416
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

84
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,833
- THE MAGIC CIRCLE'S GLOWING!

85
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,000
- DOES THAT MEAN IT'S DONE?

86
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:00,375
- YEP! LOOKS LIKE OUR
GOOSE IS COOKED!

87
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:07,375
- Loke: COME ON, GUYS! DON'T
GIVE UP! WE CAN DO THIS!

88
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,375
- Aria: NOW TITANIA.

89
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,916
STEP INTO ZERO
AIRSPACE OF DEATH.

90
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,333
IT CONSUMES THE LIVES
OF ALL WHO DARE TO ENTER.

91
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,708
- I'M TOO CUTE TO DIE!

92
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,875
- Erza: A SPELL THAT
CONSUMES LIFE?

93
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,916
TELL ME! HOW CAN YOU DO THIS?

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,291
HOW CAN YOU JUST TAKE LIVES
SO EASILY? YOU SCOUNDREL!

95
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,833
- IT'D BE MORE FUN
TO SHOW YOU!

96
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,166
- ERZA!

97
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,875
- LET'S SEE JUST HOW WELL
YOU HANDLE THIS, TITANIA!

98
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:01,000
- BUT HOW...? SHE'S CUTTING
THROUGH MY AIRSPACE!

99
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,041
NO!

100
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,875
- Erza: HEAVEN'S WHEEL!

101
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,500
SCATTERED PETALS!

102
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,416
( Aria screams )

103
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,000
- SHE TOOK HIM OUT
WITH ONE HIT!

104
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,375
- MAN, SHE IS ONE SCARY LADY!

105
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,500
- Erza: SOMEONE LIKE YOU
COULD NEVER HOLD A CANDLE

106
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,458
TO THE STRENGTH OF OUR MASTER.

107
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,666
YOU'LL BE REMEMBERED
ONLY AS A SOBBING COWARD

108
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,875
WHO FELL BY MY HAND.

109
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:31,083
- THAT'S SO SAD.

110
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,458
- EVERYBODY GET DOWN!

111
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,666
- I DON'T THINK THAT'S
GONNA HELP US!

112
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,250
- WHAT DO WE DO?

113
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:41,708
- WHAT HAPPENED?

114
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:42,708
- WHOA!

115
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,500
- ITS EYES AREN'T
GLOWING ANYMORE.

116
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,458
( Happy screaming )

117
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,916
- ERZA! WAKE UP!

118
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
- NOW WHAT?

119
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,958
- NATSU MUST'VE BEATEN
THE LAST ONE.

120
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,750
- YES! WE DID IT!

121
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,500
WE STOPPED THE ABYSS BREAK
SPELL FROM BEING CAST!

122
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,083
- Elfman: 'CAUSE WE'RE AWESOME!

123
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,625
- Gray: HA! YOU KNOW IT!

124
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,208
- Mirajane: ALL THE MEMBERS
OF THE ELEMENT 4

125
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,958
HAVE BEEN DEFEATED!

126
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:23,708
- ( fairy tail crew cheering )

127
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:27,750
- GUESS THEY TOOK OUT THE
ELEMENT 4! THAT'LL SHOW EM!

128
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,458
- OH NO, REEDUS,
ARE YOU OKAY?

129
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,125
- OUI. WELL AREN'T YOU
THE STUBBORN ONE.

130
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,625
- IT'S OVER, TUBBY.
MIGHT AS WELL GIVE UP.

131
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,416
SO JUST HAND OVER THE BRAT.

132
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,875
- OUR BOSS DOESN'T LIKE TO WAIT.

133
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,791
( he chuckles )

134
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,791
- LUCY, RUN WHILE YOU STILL CAN!

135
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,125
- AND LEAVE YOU?
I'LL STAY HERE AND FIGHT!

136
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,208
- PLEASE, FOR THE SAKE
OF THE GUILD, DO IT!

137
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,375
- BUT...

138
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,916
- STOP IT. I'LL CRY.

139
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,375
- OH, HOW TOUCHING.

140
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,083
- I LIKE WHERE THIS IS GOIN'.

141
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:02,375
- PICTO MAGIC! ROAR OF SILVER!

142
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,666
- WOW! VULCANS, HUH? JUST LIKE
THEY GOT ON MOUNT HAWKOBAY!

143
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,625
- MIRROR MAGIC. FORM MIRROR!

144
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:15,541
MY MIRRORS WILL REFLECT ANY
ATTACK RIGHT BACK AT YA!

145
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,541
YA SEE?

146
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,458
- Lucy: REEDUS.
I'M SO SORRY!

147
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,333
- YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE FATTY
HERE TO TAKE THE FALL?

148
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,583
THAT'S NOT NICE!

149
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,416
I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH A SAD
EXCUSE FOR A GUILD.

150
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,458
THEY JUST LET ANYONE
JOIN FAIRY TAIL?

151
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,750
- Lucy: TAKE THAT BACK!
- Gajeel: YOU GONNA MAKE ME?

152
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:38,541
HEY, BIG GUY.
SOUND BLAST HOWLING!

153
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:42,208
( he screams )

154
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,583
- Lucy: REEDUS!

155
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,000
- Gajeel: WHAT A CREAM PUFF.

156
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,625
YOU ACTUALLY LIKE
HANGING OUT WITH GUYS

157
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,625
LIKE THAT, LITTLE PRINCESS?

158
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,958
- YOU. YOU MONSTER.

159
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,291
YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR THIS.

160
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,083
- WHY'D THE GIANT STOP?
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

161
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,958
( she groans in pain )

162
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,583
( explosion )

163
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,541
- HECK OF A WAY TO SAY HELLO!

164
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,916
- Loke: WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOIN' WITH LUCY?

165
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,875
IF YOU DON'T LET HER
GO RIGHT NOW, YOU'LL BE SORRY!

166
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:21,000
THAT IS, IF YOU LIVE
TO SEE TOMORROW!

167
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:24,583
- OH REALLY? WELL, I LIKE
A GOOD CHALLENGE!

168
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,083
SO LET'S DANCE, FAIRY!

169
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,583
- LOKE?

170
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,416
- WHAT'S UP WITH THIS GUY?

171
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,250
SOMETHIN' ABOUT HIM
SEEMS DIFFERENT.

172
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:43,083
HE'S NOT SOME ORDINARY
HOLDER TYPE WIZARD CHUMP.

173
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:47,041
SO JUST WHO ARE YOU ANYWAY?
AND WHY DON'T YOU SMELL RIGHT?

174
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,583
- I DUNNO WHAT YOU MEAN.

175
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:51,208
I NEVER GOT ANY COMPLAINTS
FROM THE LADIES.

176
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,666
NOT NOW!

177
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,583
- GUESS I WAS WRONG.

178
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,750
YOU WEREN'T MUCH OF A
CHALLENGE, AFTER ALL.

179
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,083
HEY, I'M HAULIN' BLONDIE
BACK TO THE BOSS.

180
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,083
YOU TWO TAKE CARE OF LOVER BOY.

181
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,125
- Bozu, Sue: GOT IT!

182
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,666
- LET HER GO.

183
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,625
- SOUND BLAST DISTURBED!

184
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:17,625
( metallic clink )
- ( Loke screams in pain )

185
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:21,916
- MIRROR MAGIC. KALEIDOSCOPE!

186
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,125
Sue: IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU LIKE LOOKIN'

187
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,958
AT YOUR OWN PATHETIC FACE,
'CAUSE IT'S THE ONLY THING

188
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,750
YOU'RE GONNA SEE FOR A WHILE.

189
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,916
- Jose: I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

190
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,541
MY STRONGEST WIZARDS,
THE ELEMENT 4,

191
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:41,333
WERE COMPLETELY WIPED OUT BY
THAT WORTHLESS FAIRY TAIL SCUM?

192
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:44,500
- Gajeel: GUESS THAT MAKES 'EM
EVEN WORSE THAN SCUM, HUH?

193
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,791
- GAJEEL. SO YOU'VE RETURNED
BEARING A GIFT HAVE YOU?

194
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,708
- YEAH, I PICKED YOU UP A LITTLE
SOMETHIN' WHILE I WAS OUT.

195
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:55,666
- Jose: OH, VERY
IMPRESSIVE, MY BOY.

196
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,708
HOW WERE YOU ABLE TO TRACK
HER DOWN SO QUICKLY?

197
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,291
- Gajeel: YOU SHOULD
NEVER UNDERESTIMATE

198
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,791
THE NOSE OF A DRAGON SLAYER.

199
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,666
- SHE IS ALIVE, RIGHT?

200
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,208
WITHOUT A PULSE,
SHE'S WORTHLESS TO US.

201
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:11,958
- I WAS PRETTY ROUGH
WITH HER. LET'S SEE!

202
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:20,166
YEP! SHE'S STILL
ALIVE AND KICKIN'!

203
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,750
- EXCELLENTLY DONE, GAJEEL!
I KNEW I COULD COUNT ON YOU!

204
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,500
( announcement system tone )

205
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:31,291
- Jose: ATTENTION YOU
PATHETIC FAIRY TAIL WORMS!

206
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,083
LISTEN CAREFULLY BECAUSE
I'LL ONLY SAY THIS ONCE!

207
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:34,833
- WHAT THE...?

208
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,250
- IT'S MASTER JOSE!

209
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,708
( Lucy screams )

210
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,125
- I KNOW THAT SCREAM.

211
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,500
- LUCY?

212
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:41,916
- OH, NO!

213
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,291
- Jose: WE HAVE CAPTURED
YOUR PRECIOUS LUCY HEARTFILIA.

214
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:49,708
WHICH MEANS OUR FIRST ORDER OF
BUSINESS IS NOW OUT OF THE WAY.

215
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:55,208
AND THAT LEAVES US WITH JUST ONE
MORE THING. MY FAVORITE PART.

216
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,666
WIPING ALL OF YOU
MISERABLE BRATS

217
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,500
RIGHT OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH!

218
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,000
- NO WAY.

219
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:17,541
- PLEASE. FORGIVE ME.
I COULDN'T PROTECT YOU.

220
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:22,541
SORRY, LUCY.

221
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,750
- I KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE WAITED.

222
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,958
I SHOULD'VE BEEN HERE SOONER.

223
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,750
BUT I WAS AFRAID.

224
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:45,083
I WAS TOO SCARED TO BE
NEAR LUCY AND NOW SHE'S GONE.

225
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,500
( he weeps )

226
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,125
PATHETIC!

227
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,958
SHE'S RIGHT. I DO LOOK
ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC.

228
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,041
DON'T I, KAREN?

229
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:11,291
- OH NO!
- I THINK THERE'S MORE NOW!

230
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,666
- THERE'S A TON OF 'EM!

231
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,791
( chatter in the background )

232
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:18,500
- YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.
THEY STILL WANNA FIGHT?

233
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,750
- KEEP AN EYE ON THE GIRL.

234
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:32,083
THERE ARE STILL SOME PESTS
SCUTTLING AROUND MY GUILD HALL.

235
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,875
- YOU TALKIN' ABOUT SALAMANDER?

236
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:38,166
- YES, HIM, AND HIS FRIENDS.

237
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,000
THEY'VE BEEN LUCKY THUS FAR

238
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,750
BUT THEIR LUCK IS ABOUT
TO COME TO AN END.

239
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:47,125
I'M GOING TO EXTERMINATE
THEM MYSELF!

240
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,916
- AW MAN. THEY GOT LUCY!

241
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,083
- NATSU.

242
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,291
- ERZA!

243
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,500
- LISTEN.

244
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,875
USE YOUR STRENGTH.

245
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:10,250
IT LIES DORMANT,
DEEP DOWN INSIDE OF YOU.

246
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:18,583
BELIEVE IN YOURSELF. FIND IT.
FIND YOUR STRENGTH.

247
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,875
AND AWAKEN IT. FOR LUCY.
FOR OUR GUILD.

248
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:34,541
DO IT NOW, NATSU! SHOW ME.
SHOW ME YOU CAN SURPASS ME!

249
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,916
( roaring )

250
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,333
( he screams )

251
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,041
- IT'S NATSU.

252
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:05,708
- MAKAROV? HOW ARE
YOU FEELING?

253
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:12,041
NOT YET. YOU STILL NEED REST.

254
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,666
- SINCE WHEN
DO I LISTEN TO YOU?

255
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,333
- A REMARKABLY SPEEDY RECOVERY.

256
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:21,083
ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE
SO LONG IN THE TOOTH.

257
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:24,375
- IS THAT SO? WELL.

258
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,833
- DO YOU HASTEN TO YOUR DEATH?

259
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:32,500
- I WILL TAKE THE CHANCE.
MY CHILDREN NEED ME NOW.

260
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,041
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.

261
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:49,583
- I SWEAR. NOTHING
CHANGES WITH HIM.

262
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,500
- Mirajane: ERZA?

263
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:56,708
- SHE OKAY?

264
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:59,541
- MAN, IT LOOKS LIKE
SOMETHIN' BIG WENT DOWN.

265
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,750
- IT'S YOU.

266
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,583
- YOU'RE INJURED...
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE!

267
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:05,083
- YEAH, YOU'RE NOT REALLY
LOOKING TOO GOOD.

268
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,791
- WHOA.

269
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,333
- Mirajane: THAT'S ARIA!

270
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:10,875
- Elfman: YOU GOT
SHOT BY THAT CANNON

271
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,458
AND STILL FOUGHT THIS GUY?

272
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:15,208
- Gray: WHAT THE HECK WERE
YOU THINKIN'? HOLD ON.

273
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,750
- Mirajane: YOU BEAT
HIM ON YOUR OWN?

274
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,750
- I MUST ADMIT. I NEVER
WANTED ANYONE TO SEE ME

275
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,458
IN SUCH A WRETCHED STATE.

276
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,000
I GUESS I STILL HAVE
A LOT TO LEARN.

277
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,041
- WHAT THE...?

278
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,500
- WHAT IS IT?

279
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,291
- I SENSE DEATH!

280
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:35,041
- Gray: I DON'T LIKE
THIS FEELIN'.

281
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,541
- Elfman: I'M SUPER MANLY
AND IT GIVES ME CHILLS.

282
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,208
- Mirajane: WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S PURE EVIL.

283
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:43,000
( slow clap )

284
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:46,333
- Jose: BRAVO. YOU ARE
ALL QUITE KEEN.

285
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:50,125
VERY IMPRESSIVE,
FAIRY TAIL WIZARDS.

286
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,000
I KNEW THIS WOULD BE FUN

287
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,791
BUT NEVER IN MY
WILDEST DREAMS DID I THINK

288
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,916
IT WOULD BE THIS ENTERTAINING.

289
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,291
YOU ANNIHILATED
THE JUPITER CANNON,

290
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:02,041
DISPOSED OF MY ELITE ELEMENT 4.

291
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:06,166
AND YOU EVEN MANAGED TO BRING
MY MAGIC GIANT TO ITS KNEES.

292
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,583
- MASTER JOSE!

293
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,333
- Elfman: THIS CREEP?
- Gray: HE'S PHANTOM'S MASTER?

294
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:13,125
- IT'S LIKE THERE'S A BLACK
CLOUD HANGING OVER HIM.

295
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,291
I FEEL SICK JUST
BEING NEAR HIM.

296
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,166
- THANK YOU. YOU'VE BEEN SO
KIND TO ENTERTAIN ME...

297
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,583
I SIMPLY MUST
RETURN THE FAVOR.

298
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,291
- YOU READY?
- YOU BET!

299
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,833
- I'LL RETURN IT IN FULL.

300
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,083
- ICE MAKE SAUCER.

301
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,083
- BEAST ARM.

302
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,375
- NO! DON'T DO IT!

303
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,458
- IRON BULL!

304
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,916
- HOW ABSURD!

305
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,583
( Gray and Elfman scream )

306
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,750
- ELFMAN! GRAY!

307
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,500
- Jose: FASCINATING.

308
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,208
YOU TOOK A SHOT FROM JUPITER
AT FULL FORCE, DID YOU NOT?

309
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:20,125
AND YET YOU'RE
STILL STANDING.

310
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:24,291
- ONLY BECAUSE MY FRIENDS HAVE
FILLED MY HEART WITH STRENGTH.

311
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,250
I WILL WITHSTAND
ANY PHYSICAL PAIN

312
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,375
TO PROTECT THE ONES THAT I LOVE!

313
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:34,458
- POWERFUL, COURAGEOUS,
AND EXQUISITELY BEAUTIFUL.

314
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:38,416
DESTROYING YOU WILL BRING ME
UNBELIEVABLE PLEASURE!

315
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,333
( Lucy grunts in pain )

316
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,833
- YOU GOTTA SING
BETTER THAN THAT.

317
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,375
TOO BAD. YOUR HEART'S
JUST NOT IN IT.

318
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:53,291
- GAJEEL. HEY.
HASN'T SHE HAD ENOUGH?

319
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,125
BESIDES THE MASTER
SAID HE DOESN'T WANT

320
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,083
HER GETTIN' HURT OR NOTHIN'.

321
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,875
- BUT WHAT ELSE AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

322
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,166
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S DOING THIS.

323
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,416
HE LEAVES ME TO WATCH
OVER BLONDIE HERE,

324
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,041
WHILE HE GETS TO
HAVE ALL THE FUN.

325
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,708
ANYWAY, I'M JUST PLAYING
WITH MY NEW TOY.

326
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,750
- YEAH, BUT IF THE MASTER
CATCHES YOU DOIN' THIS,

327
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,666
WE'RE ALL GONNA BE IN TROUBLE.

328
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:22,083
- SHUT UP. I KNOW MASTER
THINKS SHE'S IMPORTANT

329
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:25,083
BUT SHE'S JUST A PIECE
OF FAIRY SCUM TO ME.

330
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:28,958
HEH, EVEN THOUGH SHE'S
A GIRL, SHE'S STILL A WIZARD!

331
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,458
SHE SHOULDA KNOWN WHAT
SHE WAS GETTIN' INTO

332
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,416
WHEN SHE JOINED THE GUILD.

333
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,458
- YOU'RE TAKIN' THIS WAY
TOO FAR, MAN. LET IT GO!

334
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,250
- MASTER'S GONNA
LOSE IT, ISN'T HE?

335
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:42,083
- WELL, THEN I'LL TELL HIM
IT WAS ALL YOUR IDEA.

336
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,291
- Bozu, Sue: PLEASE
DON'T DO THAT.

337
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,291
- Gajeel: AW, I KINDA
FEEL SORRY FOR HER.

338
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,666
HER FELLOW GUILD MEMBERS
DIDN'T EVEN WANT HER BACK

339
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,000
'TIL THEY FOUND OUT
HER OLD MAN'S LOADED.

340
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,291
( she chuckles )

341
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:56,416
- GEEZ, YOU'RE DUMB. I CAN
BARELY EVEN BELIEVE IT.

342
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,750
IT'S JUST SAD.

343
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,750
I ACTUALLY FEEL SORRY FOR YOU.

344
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,000
- Gajeel: OH?

345
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,916
- Bozu: WHAT? DID SHE
REALLY JUST SAY THAT?

346
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,375
- THIS CHICK'S TALKIN'
SMACK TO GAJEEL?

347
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:10,041
- PHANTOM LORD, HUH? RULER OF
THE SPIRITS? OH, PLEASE.

348
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,958
YOU DON'T SCARE ME AT ALL!

349
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,875
- Gajeel: YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE SAID THAT.

350
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,125
IT TAKES SOME NERVE TO
GO RUNNIN' YOUR MOUTH

351
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,500
IN A SITUATION LIKE
THIS, PRINCESS.

352
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,333
I GOTTA ADMIT, YOU GOT GUTS.

353
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,875
MAKE SOME NOISE!

354
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,333
BUT NOT THIS TRASH TALKIN'
ACT YER PUTTIN' ON.

355
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,000
I WANT SCREAMS.

356
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,041
AND IF I DON'T START
GETTIN' WHAT I WANT,

357
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,750
YOU'RE GONNA BE SORRY.

358
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:37,250
- THEN WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GO AHEAD AND DO IT?

359
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:41,666
FINISH ME. THEN YOU'RE
GONNA BE SORRY. JUST YOU WAIT.

360
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:46,833
- YEAH? WHO'S GONNA
MAKE ME? I'M CURIOUS.

361
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,416
- Lucy: FAIRY TAIL.

362
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:53,625
THEY'D NEVER LET YOU GET AWAY
WITH THIS. THEY'D TAKE REVENGE.

363
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,916
THEY'LL NEVER STOP.
AND IF I WERE YOU,

364
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,041
I'D BE WATCHIN MY
BACK FROM NOW ON,

365
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:01,000
'CAUSE THE WORLD'S SCARIEST
GUILD'LL BE AFTER YOU...

366
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,791
AS LONG AS YOU LIVE!

367
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:07,291
- SO THEY'RE GONNA COME AFTER
ME, HUH? SOUNDS LIKE FUN!

368
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:09,750
- GAJEEL!
- STOP IT!

369
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,083
( sinister laugh )

370
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:13,833
( explosion )

371
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:14,875
- WHAT?

372
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:17,375
( Natsu screams )

373
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:30,625
- SO I WAS RIGHT! I KNEW
I SMELLED HIM HERE.

374
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,541
- IT'S NATSU!

375
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:36,208
- GAJEEL!

376
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,708
( singing in Japanese )

377
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:16,416
- SO D'YA THINK THIS IRON DRAGON
SLAYER GUY ACTUALLY EATS IRON?

378
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,625
- PROBABLY. ISN'T
THAT HOW IT WORKS?

379
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,625
I MEAN, THEY CALL YOU
THE FIRE DRAGON SLAYER

380
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:22,500
AND YOU EAT A LOT OF FIRE.

381
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,666
- HEY! WHATCHA THINK
ABOUT CALLING YOURSELF

382
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,375
THE FISH DRAGON SLAYER?

383
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:30,958
- FISH DRAGON, WHOA! THAT
WOULD BE TOTALLY AWESOME!

384
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:33,750
- NEXT TIME: THE TWO
DRAGON SLAYERS!

385
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:36,625
- SO DOES THAT MEAN I'D HAVE
A FISH DRAGON ROAR ATTACK?

386
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:39,083
- YEAH, YOU COULD SPIT
FISH OUTTA YOUR MOUTH!

387
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:41,333
- I DON'T THINK THAT'D
BE TOO EFFECTIVE.
