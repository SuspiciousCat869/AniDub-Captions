The Alegria swallowed
up many lives just now.

00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,375
But one seems to have
avoided its grasp.

[LUCY grunting]
Oww!

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,416
[LUCY] What is all this?

7
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,750
It looks like some
kind of tissue.

8
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:00,500
The chance of surviving
that curse is less than one

9
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:04,125
in a billion. What fortune.

10
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:05,791
Tragic.

11
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:10,208
One solitary human soul left
to suffer in the underworld.

Everything's different.

I've used the Alegria.

The intruders' lives
have been snuffed out.

Long live the Underworld King!

[LUCY] No way, he can't have
really wiped out everyone else.

[MARD GEER] However, I sense
that one unfortunate human soul

has managed to avoid
the Alegria's reach.

Whoever slays this
human may fill it.

A vacancy?

00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,750
[SOLDIER B]
That spot'll be mine!

46
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,416
And if a Demon Gate
should kill the human.

47
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,291
They shall receive an
even greater reward.

Good hunting.

Am I the only one left?

No. Don't think like that.

164
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,625
You can't open
three gates at once!

165
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:42,875
[JACKAL growls]

166
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,791
[LUCY]
Please. Please come.

167
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:04,041
You're even stupider
than I thought.

168
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,250
She passed out!

169
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,583
Princess!

170
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,333
Glad you made it.

171
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:36,250
I'm going to say this one
more time. You're a damn idiot.

172
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,208
Who the hell is that?

173
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,583
She's my friend.

174
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:47,708
Just stay outta my way. [yells]

175
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,875
[JACKAL groaning]

176

[LUMMY screams]

177
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,875
This is too much for you!

178
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,541
You need to close
one of our gates

179
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,291
while you still
have the strength!

180
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,041
That thing.

181
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,916
It's swimming
against my current!

182
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,791
Water's a specialty of mine!

183
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,541
[AQUARIUS screams]

184
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:13,750
Leave Aquarius alone!

185
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,125
Damn it!

186
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,375
[VIRGO]
I'm on my way!

187
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:17,625
Not for long you aren't!

188
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,208
[LOKE]
What the...?

189
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,500
[LOKE screams]

00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:23,333
[VIRGO screams]

191
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,958
Loke! Virgo! Ah!

192
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:28,750
[gasps]

193
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,875
Goodbye, princess.

194
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,791
[LOKE]
I'm Sorry. We failed.

195
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:41,250
[AQUARIUS whimpering]

196
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,750
[JACKAL]
So what?

197
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,750
Bringin' out three chumps
at once was your big play?

198
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,916
Looks like Fairy Tail's
last wizard standing

199
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,125
is all tuckered out.

200
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:57,375
[LUCY whimpers]

201
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,750
I can grant you a swift end.

202
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,375
Now where's the fun in that?

203
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:03,916
Here, here!

204
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,875
If we play our cards right,
we can torture her for hours!

205
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:10,125
But remember, we're gonna
give me all the credit!

206
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,125
[LUCY]
I can't let it end like this!

207
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,833
Everyone's counting on me!

208
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,791
[LUCY]
There has to be a way.

209
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,041
[LUCY groaning]

210
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,291
[laughs]

211
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:31,208
OMG, humans are
so lame! [laughs]

212
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,916
[LUCY whimpers]

213
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,333
[JACKAL laughs]

214
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,708
[TORAFUZAR]
I've had enough of your games.

215
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,541
If you won't finish her, I will.

216
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:43,291
[JACKAL] Huh? Tell me,
whose side are you on, here?

217
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:47,125
If it's death you're after,
I'd be happy to give ya one.

218
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:54,208
I'm through with this.
Suit yourself.

219
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,125
[laughs] Well, now that
I have permission.

220
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,666
[LUMMY]
So, what's next?

221
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,791
I'd like to direct your
attention to her boobs.

222
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,166
They're way too big.

223
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,208
Let's blow 'em up! [laughs]

224
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,500
[JACKAL laughs]

225
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:15,208
Ka... boom! Ka... boom!

226
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,833
Ka... boom?

227
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:26,458
Noisy twerp. [laughs]

228
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:29,833
You blew up... your comrade?

229
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,708
Why, yes I did. And if that's
how I treat my friends,

230
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,625
then think what's
in store for you.

231
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:38,375
This is gonna be fun. [laughs]

232
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,125
[JACKAL grunts]

233
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,583
The hell?!

234
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,625
[JACKAL gasps]

235
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,625
That you, Aquarius?

236
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,291
This lousy water! Ah!

237
00:14:55,833 --> 00:15:00,541
Listen up. I can't beat them,
I can only slow 'em down.

238
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,708
Same goes for the
rest of the zodiac.

239
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,916
These demons are too strong.

240
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,458
[LUCY]
Yeah.

241
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,375
[AQUARIUS] But there's still
one way that you can win this.

242
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,958
[LUCY]
There is?

243
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,500
[AQUARIUS] We barely have the
time for me to say this once,

244
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:17,041
so pay attention.
You're strong, Lucy.

245
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,541
Strong enough to keep
three gates open.

246
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,916
And strong enough to summon him.

247
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,250
[AQUARIUS]
The Celestial Spirit King.

248
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,458
Is that possible?

249
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,833
Why else would I say it?

250
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,500
This won't be easy,
but it's our only chance.

251
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,541
His Strike from the Stars
can obliterate any foe.

252
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,791
Even this one.

253
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:42,541
Call him. But how?
I don't have his gate key.

254
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,416
[AQUARIUS] The Celestial
Spirit King has no key, Lucy.

255
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:50,833
There's another way to open
his gate. With a Zodiac key.

256
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,000
The price is a
hefty one though.

257
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,500
You can open the Gate
of the King only once.

258
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,333
And only by breaking
a golden key.

259
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,958
Forever.

260
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:03,875
[LUCY gasps] But that would
mean losing one of my spirits.

261
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,125
[JACKAL]
I'm gonna make you pay

262
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:08,416
for every second of my
time you've waste-- Ah!

263
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,791
[AQUARIUS] You can't just break
any golden key, either.

264
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:15,083
The king's gate will only
open if the level of trust

265
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,833
between wizard and spirit
is especially strong.

266
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,958
[LUCY] There has to be another
way. I won't do that.

267
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,541
I mean it!

268
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,750
It's like you're telling me to
pick a best friend to betray!

269
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,583
[AQUARIUS] It's not a
betrayal if I let you.

270
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,291
Only thing I've ever trusted
you to do is act like a fool,

271
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,625
but we do go way back.

272
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,583
So I think it'll work.

273
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:38,375
Are you saying I should...?

274
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,791
[AQUARIUS] Do what it takes
to save your friends? Yes.

275
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,708
[LUCY]
But you're one of them!

276
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,750
I'm not about to sacrifice
one friend to save another.

277
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,250
It's wrong!

278
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,625
There's another way.
There has to be!

279
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,708
All we need to do
is figure it out!

280
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,750
Do you think I
would suggest this

281
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,958
if there was still
another option?

282
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:02,125
This is the only
chance that you have.

283
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:06,208
No! That's not true!

284
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,916
[JACKAL growls]

285
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,458
You hear that?
He'll break through soon.

286
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:13,375
You have to be strong. Please!

287
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,791
[LUCY]
I can't!

288
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,458
[AQUARIUS] It's not like
you breaking my key

289
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,208
will kill me, okay?
I'll be fine.

290
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:23,458
It'll be like I moved.
Somewhere very far away.

291
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:26,375
That would still be too sad.

292
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,666
Maybe for you, but
I'll be relieved.

293
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,500
[JACKAL growling]

294
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,541
[AQUARIUS] Your mother was
an extraordinary person.

295
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,416
The best master I've ever had.

296
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,666
When she lost her life and
my key was passed on to you,

297
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,833
I could barely take it.

298
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,125
You were an ignorant brat
who cried all the time

299
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,250
and took everything
for granted.

300
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,916
You didn't inherit an ounce of
your mother's natural grace.

301
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,041
But, I had to tolerate you

302
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,625
because you were
Layla's daughter.

303
00:17:56,375 --> 00:18:00,166
[AQUARIUS] I loathed you.
Despised you.

304
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,416
For such a very long time.

305
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,333
I don't care if you hate me!

306
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,375
You were still my first
friend and I love you!

307
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,708
There's nothing you can
say that will change that!

308
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,125
Stop trying!

309
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,333
[AQUARIUS]
Quit acting like a damn child!

310
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:17,083
You can lose every friend you
have, or you can just lose me!

311
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,833
[LUCY cries]

312
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,416
[AQUARIUS] What matters
most in life? Keys?

313
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,041
Memories?
Your guilty conscience?

314
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:27,250
Or is it this? The strength
to make sacrifices

315
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:30,000
to protect the ones you love,
even when it hurts you.

316
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:33,291
If that's it then break
my key right now!

317
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,291
Natsu isn't coming!
It's all on you!

318
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:39,208
[JACKAL laughs] Pick your
words carefully, girls.

319
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:42,125
This'll be the last
fight you ever have!

320
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:47,250
[LUCY] I love you Aquarius.
I love you so much.

321
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:51,041
Yeah, I know! Now do it!

322
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:55,833
[LUCY yells]

323
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:59,208
[AQUARIUS]
Feels like my heart's on fire.

324
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:02,291
[LUCY yells]

325
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,125
[AQUARIUS]
I meant what I said.

326
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,500
I hate this stupid brat.

327
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,541
[LUCY]
Open!

328
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,375
Mermaid! Mermaid!

329
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,750
[AQUARIUS]
I can't stand her, but...

330
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:15,916
[LUCY]
Gate of the...

331
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,791
[AQUARIUS]
These emotions.

332
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,958
[LUCY] it can't be a crime
to protect the people

333
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,291
you care about!

334
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,375
Sound wicked awesome!

335
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,083
Oh, my hunk!

336
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,166
Little Lucy thinks she
can seduce a man?

337
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,666
Good luck with that scrawny bod.

338
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,083
For you to make me laugh.

339
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,125
Uh...

340
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:39,291
[AQUARIUS] These damned
feelings. I can't stop them.

341
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:44,541
[LUCY laughs]

342
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,791
Aw, come on! Bath time
is a lot of fun isn't it?

343
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,958
It's no so much fun that
you gotta call me

344
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,791
every time you get in the tub!

345
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,541
Whoops! I'm sorry!

346
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,625
[AQUARIUS] This better be
the last time I tell you this.

347
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,625
But don't ever dream
of summoning me

348
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,958
from your stupid little
pet prison again!

349
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,541
It's a goldfish bowl
for crying out loud!

350
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,666
[LUCY] But he's got
a tail, just like you!

351
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,875
Are you sayin' me and that
simple little creature

352
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:20,000
have something in common?
Because that is insulting!

353
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,208
I didn't mean to make you mad.

354
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:25,041
[AQUARIUS]
Uh! Sheesh.

355
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:29,750
You seriously need to find some
other rugrats to play with.

356
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:34,916
There aren't any.
That's why I'm so lonely.

357
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,291
[AQUARIUS grunts]

358
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:40,208
You make me happy. But I
always seem to make you mad.

359
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,333
I'm really sorry.

360
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:53,250
Oh, well. You're not
lonely anymore.

361
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:57,041
[LUCY]
Yeah. You're right.

362
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,750
I'm definitely not.

363
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:05,750
[AQUARIUS] Despite myself,
I'm gonna miss you.

364
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:10,041
You suck. I'm gonna
miss you bad.

365
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:15,833
[LUCY]
Open! Gate of the King!

366
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:21,625
[AQUARIUS] I'm grateful though
for every moment we shared.

367
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,458
Where'd the water go?

368
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:45,458
[KING growls]

369
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,541
[SOLDIERS murmur]

370
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,500
What was that?

371
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,125
Plutogrim's been ruptured?

372
00:21:57,208 --> 00:22:00,166
[SOLDIERS yell]

373
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:07,083
Ah! What did you do?
What are you?

374
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:11,250
[LUCY cries]

375
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,458
[LUCY]
Aquarius is gone.

376
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:17,500
But the Celestial Spirit King
has answered our call.

377
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:20,583
Mard Geer stands confident
atop the smoldering ruin

378
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,958
of what used to be
Tartaros' headquarters.

379
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:25,500
Unfazed by the great
titan before him.

380
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:28,416
The Kings of two worlds
are about to collide.

381
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,708
I don't have to time
to grieve for her.

382
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:32,625
But I can take strength
from her words.

383
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:34,875
And I will protect
the ones I love.

384
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:36,666
Next Time: "Tartaros Chapter

385
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,791
Celestial Spirit King
vs. Underworld King"

386
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:41,708
This is the time to fight!
