Enemy's survival: Confirmed.

00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,625
Activating pursuit system.

5
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,708
Generating missiles.

6
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,250
Fire!

00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,875

[gasps]

12
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:05,500
Oh, no! Electrical attacks
only feed his magic power.

13
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,958
But they don't affect me at all!

14
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:18,208
[DIMARIA] I'm claiming this
little one for myself.

15
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,708
[gasps] Wendy, it's you!

16
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:28,708
Sorry I got here late.

17
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:31,833
But the Sky Sisters
are back in action!

18
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:37,291
[DIMARIA] That brat...
kicked me in the face.

[coughing]

22
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,791
[WALL] All those Bane Particles
wreaking havoc on you

23
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,416
have finally caught up,

24
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,166
leaving you completely
incapacitated.

25
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,291
No wonder you're having

[LAXUS groaning]

27

Even if you were at your prime,

28
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,916
your lightning
wouldn't affect me.

29
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,541
We're at checkmate right now,
so you'd better make your peace.

30
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,625
Not yet.

31
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:49,041
No, damn it!

32
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,458
[WALL]
I'm going to end it all for you.

33
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,375
You should be grateful.

34
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,791
This humiliation and agony
you're going through

35
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,541
will be over in an instant.

36
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,708
As will your life.

Activating Etherion!

43
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:30,041
[LAXUS]
I came back for one reason...

44
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,625
[WALL]
Say goodbye.

45
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,916
[LAXUS] And that was
to protect Fairy Tail!

46
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:39,041
[LAXUS] A guild that's
stood the test of time...

47
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,000
[LAXUS]
...for 100 years!

48
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,083
Wait, what does
he think he's doing?

49
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,750
It's an enchantment.

50
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,458
But why would he create
something like this

51
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,250
in the middle of our fight?

52
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,625
[LAXUS] Fried taught me
this one himself.

53
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,125
All I gotta do is stay
inside the circle.

54
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,166
What a pointless
waste of energy!

55
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,333
Have you already forgotten
that enchantments

56
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:12,375
are ineffective against me?

57
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,750
Bane Particle Canceller!

58
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,041
[gasps]

59
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,375
[gasps]

60
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:31,000
Thanks, Fried.
I owe you big time.

61
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,708
I know there aren't
many wizards out there

62
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,208
who can break through your
enchantments like that.

63
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,583
So I'm lucky this
bastard found me,

64
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:41,708
'cause he's doin' it by
neutralizing bane particles.

65
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:45,291
Which happens to be exactly
what the doctor ordered!

66
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:48,375
Ugh. What the hell?

67
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:52,541
No!

68
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,208
I'm not usually the kinda guy
who'd wipe somebody out

69
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,125
right after they saved my life,

70
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,833
but I gotta get payback for
what you did to my friends!

71
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,875
[laughing]

72
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,916
Your lightning won't
hurt me at all!!

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,833
And that means you're
completely powerless, indeed!

74
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,458
[laughing]

75
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,500
'Cause their lives
are worth somethin'.

76
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:16,041
A hell of a lot more than mine!

77
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,958
It's useless!

78
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,666
Dark red lightning.
What is this?

79
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,083
Unable to analyze!

80
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:28,833
[yelling]

81
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,083
[MAVIS]
You never met Yuri.

82
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,458
Did you know he was
Makarov's father?

83
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,166
So that means he's
your great-grandfather.

84
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,083
I'm actually related to one of
the guys who started Fairy Tail?

85
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,916
That really makes me
wonder why the old man

86
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,833
never once mentioned it to me.

87
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,583
You remind me of Yuri
quite a bit, to be honest.

88
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,833
Oh, yeah? What was he like?

89
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,583
[MAVIS]
He was always smiling,

90
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,833
and an inspiration
to everyone he met.

91
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,083
[LAXUS chuckles]

92
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,458
That doesn't sound like me.

93
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,833
[MAVIS]
But above all...

94
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,666
...he cared.

95
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,500
His true friends were
precious to him.

96
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:08,916
Well, from now on,

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,500
my dream is to always protect
you, no matter the cost.

98
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,666
To trust you and put
all my faith in you.

99
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,083
That really doesn't
sound like me.

100
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:26,583
I practically tore the guild
apart a few years ago.

101
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,125
Turned everyone
against each other.

102
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,958
People got hurt.

103
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,291
Blows my mind they
let me back in.

104
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,750
But you didn't let those
mistakes hold you back forever.

105
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,041
[gasps]

106
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,416
[giggles]

107
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,416
[MAVIS] In that way,
you're exactly like him.

108
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,333
[LAXUS, YURI yelling]

109
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:52,583
[LAXUS, YURI]
Megaton Red Lightning!

110
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:58,500
[LAXUS] Lightning that
goes beyond lightning.

111
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,583
And red as the blood
in my veins.

112
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,291
[HAPPY]
Natsu.

113
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,583
You're a demon of
the Book of Zeref.

114
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,541
You'll die, too.

115
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,666
[HAPPY]
There's gotta be another way.

116
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,083
And I swear, I'm not giving
up until we find it.

117
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:33,791
[MAVIS]
Warren.

118
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,375
I need a situation report
from you, please.

119
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:39,208
No movement from Zeref's
division out to the west.

120
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,458
Seems to be a
stalemate up north.

121
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,708
But I'm optimistic that the
tables will start to turn

122
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,375
once Gajeel and his crew
finally get there.

123
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,583
What about the east?

124
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,583
Any word from the Four
Emperors of Ishgar?

125
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,541
We haven't gotten any kind
of status report from them.

126
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,750
But I can see here that one
of the Twelve vanished

127
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,458
and the other two are currently
heading this way.

128
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,291
They got past those guys.

129
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,750
We know if Jura's okay?

130
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:05,500
How about Erza?
Any news from her group?

131
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,625
[WARREN] One of the Twelve
there vanished, too.

132
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,916
Maybe that means
somebody took them down.

133
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,500
If that's the case, we might
actually pull this off!

134
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,000
Yeah, and don't
forget we've already

135
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,666
taken one of 'em prisoner.

136
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,208
That would mean there's
only eight of 'em to go!

137
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,333
We got this!

138
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,916
[MAKAROV]
No.

139
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,916
There are still forces
coming from the east

140
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,958
where we have no
defense in place.

141
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:29,500
And Zeref won't hold his
position in the west forever.

142
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,333
We could really use your

143
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:35,500
tactical prowess right
now, First Master.

144
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,125
What's wrong?

145
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,333
[MAVIS]
I just need some more time.

146
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:46,500
[MAVIS] What can I do to
beat Zeref? Think, Mavis!

147
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,083
Come on!

148
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,375
Right!

149
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,500
Now! Water... Slicer!

150
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,625

Hey! What are you doin' here?

Wow. She's adorable!

Looks like the port's up ahead!

Wait. I see somebody!

We're the Four Crest Knights

00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,041
You've no chance
of getting past us.

165
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,458
Don't stop!

166
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:47,666
I got it. Just push through!

167
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,541
[NEINHART KNIGHTS groaning]

168
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,625
I thought you were
supposed to be injured.

169
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,000
A little pain wouldn't
stop you, would it?

170
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,291
[NEINHART KNIGHT C]
We're the Four Crest Knights

171
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,708
'cause there's four of us!

172
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,375
[NEINHART KNIGHT D]
Big mistake!

173
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,541
[gasps]

174
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,541
[gasps]

175
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:03,916
[ERZA]
It's you!

176
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,250
[JELLAL]
Sorry I wasn't here sooner.

177
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,250
You should hide your face.

178
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,333
[JELLAL]
No. I'm done running and hiding.

179
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,125
I made the decision
it was time for me

180
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,750
to defeat Zeref
once and for all.

181
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,583
[KAGURA]
Jellal.

182
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:30,583
I don't care if you're kids.
I show mercy to no one.

183
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,625
The truth is, I could kill you
in the blink of an eye.

184
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,166
Get ready, girls!

185
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,375
[DIMARIA] A split second
would last an eternity.

186
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,083
[chuckles]

187
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:54,583
[DIMARIA] It's like I'm the only
person in the world right now.

188
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:57,958
All of it laid out before me.

189
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:01,791
Everyone's had the thought at
least once in their lives.

190
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:07,791
[DIMARIA] "I wish there was
some way I could stop time."

191
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:12,958
But I can actually make that
happen with my Age Seal.

192
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,791
Understand?

193
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:18,666
I wouldn't trade this power
for anything in the world.

194
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,166
I can do whatever
I please right now.

195
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,375
Believe me, it's a rush.

196
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:28,291
Should I rip your clothes to
shreds and embarrass you, too?

197
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:32,208
No, I think I've done
enough playing around.

198
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,875
I could easily kill you all
and be done with it,

199
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,625
but that just sounds
so boring to me.

200
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,250
Okay, so when time
starts moving again,

201
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,333
one of you will be lying
dead on the ground.

202
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,000
Yep, that definitely
works for me.

203
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:52,583
So now, I gotta figure
out which one.

204
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,208
Oh, who am I kidding?

205
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:57,333
It has to be this little
face-kicker here.

206
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,166
Sweet dreams, child.

207
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,750
It's the end of the line.

208
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,166
[gasps]

209
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,375
Are you ready?

210
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,208
Yeah, you bet!

211
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,666
[DIMARIA]
How?

212
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,708
[DIMARIA]
This is my world!

213
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,333
How can they move?

214
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,250
[BOTH yelling]

215
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,875
Leading Sky Arrow!

216
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,875
Trailing Sky Arrow!

217
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,958
I swear I just heard somebody's
voice inside my head!

218
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,791
So did I.

219
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:49,625
[ULTEAR]
The universe has been distorted.

220
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:54,166
This world we're in now
is a rift in time itself.

221
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,041
You think you're the only
one who inhabits it?

222
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,750
You're sorely mistaken.

223
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:02,958
Unfortunately for you,
this is my domain as well.

224
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,583
[CARLA]
Who is that?

225
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,333
[ULTEAR] It serves as a
temporal "prison" of sorts.

226
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,500
And I've come on behalf
of Crime Sorcière

227
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,416
to punish you for
your transgressions.

228
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,958
I know you.

229
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,000
You're Ultear!

230
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,333
[DIMARIA] Are you the one who
unlocked my flow of time?

231
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,291
Well, how could I be
when time is still stopped?

232
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,500
It's stopped?

233
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,458
This space between
is my home now.

234
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:34,375
In fact, I can only truly exist
inside this ephemeral territory.

235
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,583
By interrupting the normal
flow of the cosmos,

236
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,250
you unwittingly placed yourself

237
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:41,125
within this peculiar
domain in which I dwell.

238
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,875
Consider this your welcome.

239
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,833
This is supposed to be my world.

240
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,541
How dare you defile it!

241
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,125
If she was the only one who
could move freely while time

242
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,333
was standing still
for all of us,

243
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:56,000
we'd've been killed in the blink
of an eye, like she said.

244
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,541
Hold on.

245
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:01,500
So when that happened
before, time was stopped?

246
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,666
I don't understand.
What's going on here?

247
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,833
[ULTEAR] Her magic has the
power to stop time completely.

248
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:12,416
However, since I removed myself
from the normal order of things,

249
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,583
I can exist where life has
ceased following that order.

250
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,000
And luckily for you,
I realized that I was able

251
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,583
to allow you to move
in here with us.

252
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:21,708
I see.

253
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:22,916
There were rumors you vanished

254
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,791
soon after the Eclipse
Gate was closed.

255
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:59,708
[ULTEAR] Being in the rift of
time like this, it's not so bad.

256
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,375
Get out, now!

257
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,958
But I have no true
corporeal form.

258
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:08,041
Which means, I'm not able
to fight alongside you.

259
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:08,833
[DIMARIA yells]

260
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,541
Get out of the way!

261
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,541
[DIMARIA]
A projection?

262
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:17,041
Hurry! You can only move
while I hold time in place!

263
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,625
And I can't do it much longer!

264
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:20,500
Got it!

265
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,500
Here we go!

266
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,416
This world belongs to me alone,

267
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,166
and I won't let anyone
interfere with it!

268
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,416
Sky Dragon Wing Attack!

269
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,125
Sky God Boreas!

270
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:37,166
[DIMARIA] Guess I need to show
you why I control time.

271
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,541
As well as the true power

272
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,291
that the Spriggan
Twelve can wield!

273
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,750

What is she doing?
Her power's incredible!

278
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,291
[DIMARIA]
My ultimate spell.

279
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:13,000
Take Over God Soul.

280
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,583
[gasps]

[gasps]

282
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,791
The strength of a god?

283
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,041
This can't be happening.

284
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:24,166
[yells]

285
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,333
[gasps]

286

[HAPPY]
What's the matter, Lucy?

287
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,041
Did you have a nightmare?

288
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,125
[LUCY]
More like a bad feeling.

289
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:39,041
I don't think I can rest while
everyone else is fighting.

290
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,416
[HAPPY]
Well, what was it?

291
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,041
Somethin' about Natsu?

292
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,291
[LUCY]
I don't really know exactly.

293
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,375
Just got worried
all of a sudden.

294
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:49,083
Natsu is gonna be fine.

295
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,625
[LUCY]
Yeah.

296
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,000
[DIMARIA]
Hearken to my voice.

297
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,250
A god is among you now.

298
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,708
Chronos, god of time.

299
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,875
Is everybody still okay?

300
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,750
[CARLA]
Uh-huh.

301
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:19,750
[ULTEAR] I could've
never anticipated this.

302
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,083
The power of the god of time?

303
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:25,791
How did she obtain
something so terrifying?

304
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:29,083
[DIMARIA] I am a god
of the ancient Mildians.

305
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:32,083
Dimaria was born
from their lineage.

306
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:36,291
Together we have become
one singular force.

307
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,500
So you say you're a god, huh?

308
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,333
Well, I think you're gonna
be sorry you decided

309
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:43,083
to start a fight
with a god slayer!

[WENDY gasps]

314

[CARLA]
I could see the future.

315
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,750
But it was too late.

316
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,166
I wasn't fast enough.

Come on, please say something!

320
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,125
You hear me?

321
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,791
Please wake up.

322
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,291
Just open your eyes!

323

She killed her.

00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,666
[WENDY]
Carla!

325
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,291
Carla!

326
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,041
[WENDY]
No.

327
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,583
[WENDY]
Carla.

328
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:59,250
Please don't leave me!

329
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,125
[DIMARIA]
You have desecrated my realm.

330
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:07,750
For your trespass,
death is the only atonement.

331
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,000
[WENDY crying]

332
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,833
Carla! No!

333
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,916
She's still alive. For now.

334
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,708
[gasps]

335
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:20,916
[ULTEAR]
She's injured,

336
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,291
but I ejected her from
this place we're in.

337
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:27,666
In other words, she's back
where time has stopped.

338
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,333
She was only trying to help me.

339
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,875
And now she's stuck.

340
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,541
[ULTEAR]
I was almost too late.

341
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:38,833
Once time starts moving again,
she'll be in real danger.

342
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,083
That means you'll have
to win this fight,

343
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,000
and at the moment
time moves forward,

344
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,416
cast a full-power healing
spell to save her.

345
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,750
Ultear, you're cracking!
What's happening?

346
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,750
[ULTEAR] My hold on this rift
is beginning to wane.

347
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,916
I can only keep you
here a little longer.

348
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,666
You must defeat
your foe quickly.

349
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,708
And that'll save her?

350
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,583
[SHELIA]
Come on, let's do it!

351
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,041
[WENDY]
Yeah!

352
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,333
[ULTEAR]
These girls...

353
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,166
They don't have a chance
in this battle.

354
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,291
She has a god's
power behind her.

355
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,583
[gasps]

356
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,750
[ULTEAR]
That look in their eyes.

357
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,750
They have no fear.

358
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,250
[ULTEAR] Whatever happens,
they'll fight till the end.

359
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,833
[gasps]

360
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:32,666
[ULTEAR] To win, you'll need to
use the power of the future.

361
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,625
[WENDY]
What do you mean?

362
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,750
[ULTEAR]
Your potential.

363
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:40,583
Meaning, the power that you
will gain in the future.

364
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,458
You'll need to use it all now.

365
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,583
That's the only hope you'll
have of winning here.

366
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:53,250
However, once you've
used this spell, that's it.

367
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,416
You'll lose your
magical ability forever.

368
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,291
[BOTH gasp]

369
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:00,666
Tell me. Will you
pay that price?

370
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:05,166
[ULTEAR]
The cost of the Third Origin.

371
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,833
[LUCY]
The Third Origin allows a wizard

372
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:41,916
to use their potential
magic power.

373
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,125
But once that energy
has been tapped into,

374
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:45,666
it's gone forever.

375
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:49,166
Willing to make that sacrifice,
Wendy clashes with Dimaria,

376
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,708
who now has the
strength of a god.

377
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:53,541
Meanwhile, back in Magnolia,

378
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,541
another member of the
Twelve makes a move

379
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:58,833
that threatens the very
heart of Fairy Tail.

380
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:01,958
Next Time: "Natsu, Revived!"

381
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,958
Only hope and courage
can break through

382
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:06,375
these clouds of despair.
