1
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,000
Now have at it.

2
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,791
The winner gets to live.

3
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:30,083
[GRAY] My mind... I feel
like it's fading away.

4
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:35,375
[JUVIA] No, I-I won't
hurt my darling Gray.

5
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:38,041
I don't want to, but...

6
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:41,708
[GRAY] I can't focus.
I'm losing control.

7
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:44,708
[yells]

8
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,541
[screams]

9
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,250
[yells]

10
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:58,625
[INVEL] Gray will win this
fight, just as I predicted.

11
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:02,666
[screams]

12
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,541
[INVEL] Killing his dear friend
with his own two hands

13
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:08,541
will unleash the
darkness within him.

14
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:16,625
[INVEL] Creating the apex
warrior who shall defeat E.N.D.

15
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:54,583
[INVEL] Your Majesty, may I
inquire about that necklace?

16
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,375
I've not seen you without it.

17
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:57,958
Of course.

18
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:04,791
This pendant--it holds an image
of my younger brother, Natsu.

19
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,791
[INVEL] His Majesty will
vanquish Acnologia,

20
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,416
then the world
will truly be his.

21
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,166
But to fully realize this goal,
E.N.D. must be removed.

22
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:35,875
[JUVIA] Why? Why am I trying
to harm my love like this?

23
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,791
It goes against every
fiber of my being.

24
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:42,666
I would truly rather die
than see him suffer.

25
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,833
Please, my darling!
Hurry and kill me!

26
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,833
No, that wouldn't work.

27
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:52,291
He would blame himself.
His heart would be broken.

28
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,333
It's clear what I must do now.

29
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,458
I have no other choice.

30
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:02,083
Yes. I shall take my own life!

31
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:07,250
I'll do it. Before I lose
what control I still have.

32
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:10,791
I have to be brave.
This is for the best.

33
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,375
[INVEL]
Don't bother resisting.

34
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:16,250
My Ice Lock magic
imprisons your mind.

35
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,625
Its cold shackles
confine your free will.

36
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,708
To earn release, you must
kill the one before you.

37
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,541
My feelings will
never be confined,

38
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,416
but if my body is trying
to imprison them,

39
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,041
then I must destroy it!

40
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,791
[gasps]

41
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,666
You awakened the
best part of me.

42
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,375
Gray, my love.

43
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,666
That's absurd. Choosing
self-destruction?

44
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,916
Juvia. You didn't have to.

45
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,250
[gasps]

46
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:00,583
[INVEL] They'd both
rather end their lives?

47
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,750
I'm sorry. I thought...

48
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:07,291
My darling Gray.
You shouldn't have!

49
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,333
[GRAY]
There was no other choice.

50
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:13,166
I couldn't hurt you, Juvia.
You mean too much to me.

51
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,500
You're my friend.

52
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,083
[JUVIA]
I feel the same.

53
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:21,125
I just wanted... to protect you.

54
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,583
But now, I...

55
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:28,541
You're so kind. My very
last moment is a happy one.

56
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:31,041
[INVEL]
What the hell is going on here?

57
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:34,083
I never saw this coming.

58
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,291
[GRAY]
Damn it.

59
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,000
It wasn't supposed
to turn out this way.

60
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:44,083
[GRAY] Natsu. Please.
Don't let us die in vain.

61
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,708
Avenge us.

62
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:57,000
[INVEL] They couldn't live with
the guilt of killing a friend,

63
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,625
so instead they
killed themselves.

64
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:02,458
It's absolutely mind-boggling.

65
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,708
[INVEL] I'll have to think
of another strategy.

66
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,208
[INVEL]
But as things stand now,

67
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:17,416
it seems the only option left
is to deal with E.N.D. myself.

68
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,333
[WIZARD A gasps]

69
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,625
[WIZARD B]
Hey, the blizzard stopped!

70
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,375
[WIZARD C]
It's about time!

71
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,458
[GRAY]
What's goin' on?

72
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,708
I'm still alive. But how?

73
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:39,083
I mean, I know what I did.

74
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,208
[gasps]

75
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:42,833
[GRAY]
It's so strange.

76
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,541
The blood inside me...

77
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:47,166
...somehow it doesn't
feel like my own.

78
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:55,000
[JUVIA]
Water Make Blood.

79
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,666
I'd been worried that
something terrible

80
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,500
would happen to you, my love.

81
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,166
So I secretly mastered
a blood transfusion spell

82
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,166
that would let me care for you.

83
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,541
[JUVIA] I'll always be alive,
inside of you.

84
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:13,666
So don't cry.
We'll still be together.

85
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,458
No, you can't die.

86
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,125
Juvia.

87
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,958
[JUVIA]
My life is yours now.

88
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,083
We're inseparable.

89
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:34,125
[screaming]

90
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,000
[GRAY]
I need ya to focus!

91
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,958
[BOTH yelling]

92
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,333
Ice Make Geyser!

93
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,250
Water Nebula!

94
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,583
[GRAY]
Get down!

95
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,208
[JUVIA]
I can still feel the warmth

96
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:00,041
of Gray's hand on my tushie!

97
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:03,583
[GRAY]
Juvia, listen for a sec.

98
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,125
There's somethin' I've
been meanin' to tell ya

99
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,291
for a while now.

100
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,791
Um. Whatever "something" is,
I'm ready to hear it!

101
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,041
[GRAY] I mean, it's not
that big of a deal, but--

102
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,125
You never know, it might be
a really big deal for me!

103
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,708
[JUVIA] Could this be the moment
I've always dreamed of?

104
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,500
Will he confess his
love to me at last?

105
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,750
Oh my goodness. What will I say?

106
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:25,916
[JUVIA]
I was knitting in a rush,

107
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,375
so it didn't turn out very good.

108
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,291
But I'd be honored
if you wore it!

109
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,916
Here, please!

110
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,791
[GRAY] You should get home
before it starts storming.

111
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:38,625
[JUVIA]
Wait!

112
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:39,875
What the hell?

113
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,625
I knitted a scarf for
you, won't you wear it?

114
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:42,958
I don't do scarves.

115
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,583
Come on, it's a
cute accessory!

116
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,375
I don't accessorize either.

117
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,708
But it's gonna get cold out--
look at those clouds!

118
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,416
So what? I'm an ice
wizard, all right?

119
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,458
The cold doesn't even affect me.

120
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:56,958
[JUVIA]
Juvie!

121
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,208
I'm sorry.

122
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,125
[JUVIA]
I wanna make up for my mistake.

123
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,916
So I made you this body pillow!

124
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,041
Here, do whatever
you want with it!

125
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,750
[GRAY]
No way!

126
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:38,875
[JUVIA]
It's also in commemoration

127
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,958
of our 414th day anniversary,

128
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,250
so you know, it'd be pretty
rude not to take it!

129
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,041
[GRAY] Seriously! That thing's
creepy! Take it back!

130
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,416
[JUVIA]
Creepy?

131
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Gray, my darling,
aren't you glad I brought

132
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,625
my special two-person sleeping
bag with me on this trip?

133
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,000
No way I'm gettin'
in that thing!

134
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:58,375
I have a surprise for
you, my darling Gray!

135
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,833
Something warm for
you to munch on!

136
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:01,875
[yelps]

137
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,583
[JUVIA]
I call them Graybuns!

138
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,833
Well, they do look pretty tasty,

139
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,833
but it would feel weird
to gnaw on my own face.

140
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,458
I thought you'd say that.

141
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:13,250
Guess I'll keep all the
Graybuns for myself.

142
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:17,083
Which means you get to enjoy
these hot Juvibuns!

143
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,666
[GRAY]
You set me up!

144
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,458
You went through
all the trouble...

145
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:23,291
I might as well eat one.

146
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:26,208
Oh, my darling! That's a--

147
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,500
Graybun.

148
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:28,916
[grunts]

149
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,666
It was you?

150
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:48,250
[GRAY crying]

151
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,083
You freed him.

152
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,041
[GRAY]
Thank you.

153
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,291
Thank you.

154
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,833
[JUVIA]
Gray.

155
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,750
[GRAY]
I'm sorry.

156
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,750
Are you okay, my love?

157
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,416
I'm fine. Care for a bite?

158
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,791
Wow! My darling Gray is
sharing his food with me?

159
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,791
His lips touched this!

160
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,875
I hope you know
I appreciate you.

161
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,958
I can always count on you
to be by my side, right?

162
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,041
[JUVIA] Oh, well, yes,
of course, my love.

163
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,875
If that's what you want!

164
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:25,000
I'll give you my answer
once the battle is over.

165
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:29,333
[GRAY] But for now,
let me focus on this.

166
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:30,916
Sure.

167
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:35,625
[GRAY] Oh, Juvia. I'm sorry
for the way I've treated you.

168
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,500
I promise I'll take your
feelings seriously.

169
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,250
Just please wake up.

170
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,333
Juvia.

171
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:53,208
I believe Brandish was
headed in this direction.

172
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:31,916
[ALL scream]

173
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,458
[HAPPY]
Jeez, Lucy. You weigh a ton!

174
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:34,750
[NATSU]
Man, that hurt!

175
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,541
Hey, monster lady!

176
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:37,875
What's your problem?

177
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,791
I'm sorry for what
happened earlier.

178
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,958
Brandish, I really don't think
we need to fight anymore!

179
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,625
Well, neither do I.

180
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,875
[BOTH gasp]

181
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,541
[BRANDISH] You guys helped me
out when you didn't have to,

182
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,083
so I've decided to spare you.

183
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,541
[HAPPY]
You'll spare us?

184
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,500
[BRANDISH]
Like I said before.

185
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,166
I've no intention
to betray Alvarez.

186
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,125
It's where I call
home, after all.

187
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,041
I'm going to slaughter
every last one

188
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,416
of your friends and guildmates.

189
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,083
But I promise that
I will not harm you.

190
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,375
Huh?

191
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,208
What the hell? Are you serious?

192
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,416
[DIMARIA]
Randi.

193
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:35,250
[DIMARIA]
And to think I trusted you.

194
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,041
It's inevitable.

195
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:40,458
There's no doubt that
Alvarez will be victorious.

196
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:43,958
Our sheer numbers, the power
of the Spriggan Twelve,

197
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:47,208
and our heavyweights,
August and Irene.

198
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,833
And at this very moment,

199
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,833
His Majesty is reaping
the Fairy Heart.

200
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,166
Give up already.

201
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,625
Because you don't have
chance at winning.

202
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:02,083
No way. Fairy Tail will
never surrender.

203
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,000
[BRANDISH]
Doesn't matter.

204
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,000
All your friends
are going to die.

205
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,958
There's nothing you can do.

206
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,583
[AJEEL laughing]

207
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,291
I gotta say, you have a
lotta fight in ya, big guy!

208
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,708
But it won't help!

209
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:18,750
[LISANNA gasps]

210
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,291
Not more sand.

211
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,500
[AJEEL]
Shrivel up and die already!

212
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:26,500
Your bodies will blow
away with my sand.

213
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,250
I gotta think fast.

214
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,916
We can't lose!

215
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,791
You're weak!

216
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,291
I swear I'll protect Lisanna
and the rest of the guild

217
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,583
like a real man!

218
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,583
Well, your moves are
bloody brilliant, but...

219
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:39,708
...ya can't land 'em.

220
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,000
No!

221
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:44,208
My skill: Closing My Eyes.

222
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:47,166
[MIRAJANE]
How can I beat this guy?

223
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,625
It appears you've
already burned through

224
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,166
a lot of your magic power.

225
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,208
That'll make my job
a good bit easier.

226
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,125
Then bring it on!

227
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,791
--[MINERVA screaming]
--[WALL laughing]

228
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,708
I need to hurry this up and
exterminate all you pests.

229
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,583
Because the truth is,
I've got a major bone

230
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,208
to pick with that cocky
lighting bastard.

231
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:08,750
Am I supposed to be
afraid of a shadow?

232
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,583
I have returned from
beyond the grave.

233
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,291
And now the underworld
is waiting for you

234
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,541
to take your place within it!

235
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:20,375
[SOLDIERS yelling]

236
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,958
[ERZA growls]

237
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,541
[NATSU] So you think all our
friends are gonna die?

238
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,416
Not if we can help it.

239
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,708
We've been through more
tough battles than I can count

240
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,875
and we're still standing strong!

241
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,875
[HAPPY]
Aye! She's right!

242
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,458
This time is different.

243
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:47,041
You've never faced an enemy as
lethal as the Spriggan Twelve.

244
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:53,333
[INVEL] To think that
you actually survived.

245
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:57,208
[growling]

246
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,333
However, I imagine that
you're still too injured

247
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,208
for a proper fight.

248
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:07,208
[screams]

249
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,208
[growls]

250
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,458
[INVEL]
How?

251
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,125
[INVEL]
He's forced my hand.

252
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,625
I've no choice but to
take a drastic measure.

253
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,416
[INVEL]
Absolute Ice Shroud!

254
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:43,583
[INVEL] This netherworld ice
freezes all that it touches.

255
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,541
You may think you're resistant,

256
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:50,041
but any contact with this armor
will freeze you to your core.

257
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,541
[groaning]

258
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,625
[INVEL] And then you'll
shatter into pieces.

259
00:16:54,708 --> 00:17:00,666
[yelling]

260
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,375
[gasps]

261
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,041
[NATSU]
You're cocky.

262
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:13,166
But that's because you've never
faced an enemy like Fairy Tail!

263
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,291
How could this be?

264
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,791
[INVEL] This wizard is able to
duplicate the same properties

265
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,625
as my netherworld ice?

266
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,708
[GRAY] Juvia had a life
ahead of her, a future,

267
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,875
and you stole it from her!

268
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,041
I'll make you pay.

269
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,666
[GRAY] You're the one
who's gonna shatter!

270
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:46,875
[GRAY] Ice Demon...
Zero Destruction Fist!

271
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,833
[BRANDISH]
You remember what went down

272
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,916
on Caracol Island, don't you?

273
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,125
I could end your lives right now
with a snap of my fingers.

274
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,375
Like to see you try.

275
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,000

276
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:12,083
We're not lookin'
for some kinda mercy.

277
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:16,000
You guys came here for a fight,
and we'll give it to ya!

278
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,000
[NEINHART]
Erza! Lady Erza!

279
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,166
Come out wherever you are!

280
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,875
[BRANDISH]
Neinhart.

281
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,958
Wait. Your eyes.

282
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,375
[chuckles]

283
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:37,166
[NEINHART] An effect of my
lady's augmentation magic.

284
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,166
Right now I'm
practically bursting

285
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,291
at the seams with power.

286
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,541
You should step aside, Brandish.

287
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,875
These three are comrades
of Lady Erza.

288
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,666
That makes them enemies.

289
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,666
"Lady Erza"?

290
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:57,041
Leave us be. We're in the
middle of a negotiation here.

291
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,666
Is that so?

292
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,375
Sounds suspicious to me.

293
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,291
You would dare betray
Lady Irene and the Empire?

294
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,875
[BRANDISH screams]

295
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,083
Holy crap!

296
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,625
This wind is like a
million little razors!

297
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,958
[grunting]

298
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,916
[BRANDISH]
My magic can't even touch him!

299
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,791
How much did she power him up?

300
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,333
[NATSU]
All right, ya windbag!

301
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,541
[BRANDISH] No! You don't
have a chance against him!

302
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,000
[laughing]

303
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,708
I'll never know unless I try!

304
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,916
I am not gonna run away!

305
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:37,833
Because every single step
I take forward is a victory!

306
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:44,375
[NATSU] That's how we're
gonna get back to the guild!

307
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,291
[BRANDISH] Whoa. He's way
stronger than I thought.

308
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,916
Yes! Way to go, Natsu!

309
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,750
But why did he call
her "Lady Erza"?

310
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,791
Just hang on.

311
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,125
Don't get up until I've
completely healed you.

312
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,708
[JUVIA]
Wendy.

313
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,375
You're awfully lucky that she
was able to find you in time.

314
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,166
A moment later and
you'd've been gone.

315
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,625
Actually, the reason
we found her so quickly

316
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:28,208
was because of
your clairvoyance.

317
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,333
So I survived?

318
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,166
It's a miracle.

319
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,875
[JUVIA]
You ladies saved my life!

320
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,833
From the bottom of
my heart, thank you!

321
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,166
It's no problem!

322
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,791
We're all supposed to help
each other out, ya know!

323
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,833
I owe it to Shelia to
work twice as hard

324
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,541
to keep everybody safe!

325
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:48,791
I'm alive!

326
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,250
And I can still feel the kiss

327
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:53,208
that my spicy ice hunk gave
me as I lay unconscious.

328
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,958
I'm sure it was a dream.

329
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,250
[gasps]

330
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,041
Do either of you know
where Gray is right now?

331
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,791
He was hurt. Is he okay?

332
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,291
[WENDY] He wasn't here
when we showed up.

333
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:15,000
I could keep thrashing you, and
as good as that would feel...

334
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:18,041
...it still wouldn't
bring her back.

335
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:24,625
Like your long-lost mother,
your father, your master, right?

336
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,958
How do you know about all that?

337
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,458
[INVEL] Because it's your
fate in this life.

338
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,000
Unless you defeat E.N.D.,

339
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:36,916
misery will follow you
for the rest of your days.

340
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,875
[GRAY]
I am gonna take him down.

341
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,333
I don't need you to tell me!

342
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:43,541
[INVEL] The truth is,
you're the only in this world

343
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,625
one who can beat him.

344
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:49,458
However, you should
know his other name.

345
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,250
Etherious Natsu Dragneel.

346
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:56,250
He is the mightiest demon
of the Books of Zeref.

347
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:02,208
[INVEL] Which means
he's your ultimate foe.

348
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,500
[GRAY]
Huh?

349
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,625
[LUCY] Gray struggles
with the revelation

350
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:42,583
that his old friend
Natsu is really E.N.D.

351
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:45,333
as I begin my battle
against Brandish.

352
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:46,833
Although I don't
wanna fight someone

353
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:49,583
who has shown me kindness,
I'm forced to go head-to-head

354
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:53,166
with a super-sized version of
the powerful Spriggan Wizard.

355
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,458
With neither side finding
room to compromise,

356
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:58,708
our fight triggers
a brand-new crisis.

357
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:02,208
Next Time: "The Mightiest
Demon of the Book of Zeref."

358
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,291
Who is standing in our way now?

359
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,416
Friend, or foe?
