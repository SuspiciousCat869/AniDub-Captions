ARE A FORTUNATE LOT INDEED.

THEY POSSESS
UNIMAGINABLE POWER

38
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,958
BECAUSE THEY ARE BORN
WITH AN ETERNAL SPRING OF MAGIC.

00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,500
THEN THERE ARE
THE DRAGON SLAYERS.

40
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:35,000
YOUR POWER SURPASSES

CONCEPT OF LIMITATION.

42

THAT POWER
WILL BELONG TO ME.

00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,916
WITH IT, I CAN REPLENISH
THIS WORLD'S SUPPLY.

( maniacal laughing )

IT APPEARS YOU COULDN'T
LIVE UP TO YOUR NAMESAKE.

00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,916
AS LONG AS I POSSESS

I AM GOD.

00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,750
YOUR POWER
IS TRULY REMARKABLE.

56
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,333
AND I SHALL SAVOR 
EVERY OUNCE OF IT.

I CALL TO THEE,
OH, HEAVEN AND EARTH.

64
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:58,291
I ASK THAT YOU RELINQUISH
ALL YOUR MAGIC POWER

65
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,666
TO THE DORMA ANIM.

66
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:10,166
( inhales deeply )
I FEEL IT!

67
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,500
THE LAST REMNANTS
OF EDOLAS'S POWER

68
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,291
ARE VANISHING.

69
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:17,333
THAT MEANS
YOUR TIME IS UP.

70
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,166
I MUST HARVEST
YOUR POWER IMMEDIATELY.

KID, YOU TOO.

- ALL OF US
AT THE SAME TIME?

75
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,958
- THERE'S NO SENSE
HOLDING BACK.

76
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,916
WE GOT TO TAKE DOWN
THIS WALKING SCRAP HEAP.

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,583
ARE YOU READY?!

78
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:36,958

- SKY DRAGON...

83

- WHAT? HOW CAN
THEIR MAGIC POWER

84
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:48,916
STILL BE INCREASING?

85
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,666
- All: ROAR!

86
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,208

JUMP THAT HIGH?

- OH, NO. OUR THREE-ON-ONE
ATTACK DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH HIM.

93
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,083
- THEN WE'LL TRY IT AGAIN!

FOR THE WORLD,
FOR MY BELOVED EDOLAS!

101
00:05:56,458 --> 00:06:00,125
YOU WORMS COULDN'T POSSIBLY
UNDERSTAND OUR PLIGHT.

102
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,708
YOU HAVE AN ABUNDANCE
OF THE ONE THING

103
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,000
WE DESIRE MOST.

104
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:08,125
THE CITIZENS OF EDOLAS 
HAVE NO USE FOR GUILDS.

105
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,916
THEY WOULD SERVE
NO PURPOSE HERE.

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,916
WHAT THEY NEED
IS EVERLASTING MAGIC POWER.

107
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,833
AND I'M DETERMINED TO
GIVE IT TO MY PEOPLE.

108
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,166
I WANT THEM
TO EXPERIENCE THE BLISS

109
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,875
YOU EARTH LANDERS
HAVE KEPT FOR YOURSELVES.

- NOT GOOD. 

112
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,291
I'M OUT OF POWER.

113
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,583
- FINALLY REACHED YOUR LIMIT,
HAVE YOU?

114
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,958
- ( pants )

115
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:46,291
- YOU MAY BE POWERFUL WIZARDS,

116
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:49,208
BUT I IMAGINE IT TAKES TIME
FOR YOU TO RECOVER

117
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,458
THE MAGIC POWER
YOU'VE EXHAUSTED.

118
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:56,583
IF YOU WISH TO SURRENDER,
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE.

119
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,083
AGREE TO SUPPLY MY WORLD
WITH MAGIC POWER

120
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,500
AND I WILL COMPENSATE YOU
ACCORDINGLY.

121
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:06,958
- IT'S ALL OVER.
HE CAN'T EVEN STAND UP.

122
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,041
- SO THIS IS IT.

123
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,666
- ( groans, growls )

124
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,791
DON'T YOU DARE GIVE UP!

125
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,416
NO, THIS FIGHT AIN'T OVER!

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,458
WHAT'RE YOU WAITING FOR?!

127
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,666
HIT ME WITH
YOUR BEST SHOT!

128
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,250
DO IT!

129
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,666
I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE!

130
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,250
- WITH PLEASURE.

131
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:32,250
I'VE LET YOU PESTS
SCURRY AROUND LONG ENOUGH.

132
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,208
- ( growls, grunts )

133
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,875
- NATSU.

134
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,500
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

135
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,125
YOU CAN'T STOP HIM.
YOU'RE ALL OUT OF POWER.

136
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,375
- NO, I'M NOT!

137
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,250
- ( rock cracking )
- ( grunts )

138
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,458
- OH, NO.

139
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,083
- ( strains )

140
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,750
IF I RUN OUT OF POWER TODAY,

141
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,291
THEN I'LL JUST
BORROW SOME FROM TOMORROW!

142
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,625
( growls )

143
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,500
DON'T EVER UNDERESTIMATE
THE DRAGON SLAYERS!

144
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,583
GOT IT?

145
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,666
- TOMORROW'S POWER, HUH?

146
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,500
- YOU NEED TO LEARN YOUR PLACE,
YOU PIECE OF FILTH.

147
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:15,625
- ( zaps )

149
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:20,875

BOW DOWN BEFORE ME!

150
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,958
- ( buzzer sounds )
- WHAT'S THAT?

151
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,458
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S GONNA
LEARN YOUR PLACE, OLD MAN,

152
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:30,125
BECAUSE, IN THE END,
IT'LL BE ON YOUR KNEES.

153
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:34,833
- WHAT HAPPENED?

154
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,083
- I LOCKED YOUR FOOT.

155
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,500
PULL THAT
JUMPING CRAP AGAIN

156
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,791
AND YOU JUST
MIGHT LOSE IT.

157
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:42,541
- CURSE YOU!

158
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,875
- COME ON, SALAMANDER!

159
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,041
YOU'RE OUR ONLY HOPE LEFT!

160
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,375
IT'S ALL UP TO YOU NOW.

161
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,708
- WENDY, ROAR AT ME WITH
EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT!

162
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,500
JUST DO IT! HURRY!

163
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,958
- OKAY.

164
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,166
I'LL DO IT
'CAUSE I BELIEVE IN YOU.

165
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,125
- YOU INSECT,
LET GO OF ME.

166
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,958
- SORRY, PAL,
BUT THAT AIN'T HAPPENING.

167
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,541
- ( inhales )

168
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,125
( groans )

169
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:23,458
SKY DRAGON...

170
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:27,500
ROAR!

171
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,458
- LOOK AT THAT.

172
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,125
HE FOUND HER
ATTACK'S ROTATION

173
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,708
AND HE'S RIDING IT HOME.

174
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,291
- ( gasps )

175
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,083
- ( screaming )

176
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,916
- ( grunting )

177
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,375
- ( screaming )

178
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,500
- NO, IT CAN'T BE!

179
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,625
IT CAN'T END THIS WAY!

180
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,708
- FIRE DRAGON...

181
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,000
SWORD HORN!

182
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,833
- HEH.

183
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,500
- ( giggles )

184
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,166
- ( Faust screams )

185
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,041
( gasping )

186
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,000
- ( groans )

187
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,083
- ( frightened gasps )

188
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,125
- ( dragon roars )

189
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,166
- Faust: THIS POWER--

190
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,708
I CAN'T BELIEVE I WAS
SO DESPERATE TO POSSESS

191
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,625
SOMETHING THIS TERRIFYING.

192
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,291
- ( dragon roars )

193
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:06,333
- ( gasps )
- ( growls )

194
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,083
- ( sighs )

195
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,916
- ( hisses )

196
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,416
- ( whimpers )

197
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,541
SOMEONE, PLEASE HELP ME!

198
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,666
( groans )

199
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,791
( thuds )

200
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,791
- ( snickers )

201
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,541
- ( laughs )

202
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,500
- ( giggles )

203
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,583
- HA HA HA HA!

204
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,875
WE TOTALLY
TOOK DOWN THE KING!

205
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,250
HEY, THIS IS THE POINT
WHERE I GET TO YELL

206
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,750
"CHECKMATE," RIGHT?

207
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,208
- Wendy: ACTUALLY, I THINK
YOU'RE SUPPOSED

208
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,416
TO SAY THAT BEFORE YOU
TAKE DOWN THE KING.

209
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,000
- HEH, EVEN I KNOW THAT.

210
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,583
- ( laughs )
- ( rumbling )

211
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,250
- HUH? HEY.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

212
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,541
- GREAT, ENEMY REINFORCEMENTS?

213
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,083
I HOPE NOT.

214
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,833
I USED UP EVERYTHING
I HAD LEFT IN THAT FIGHT.

215
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,625
- NO, UP THERE!

216
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,500
LOOK!
- Both: ( gasps )

217
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,208
- THE FLOATING ISLANDS
ARE FALLING.

218
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,250
WHAT THE HECK?

219
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,875
- LOOK, THE ISLANDS,
THEY'RE FALLING.

220
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,000
- WHOA, IS THE WORLD
COMING TO AN END OR SOMETHING?

221
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,416
- ( frightened chatter )
- Soldier: IT'S A CATACLYSM!

222
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
- ( whimpering,
frightened muttering )

223
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,083
- THIS CAN'T BE GOOD.

224
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,166
- THE ISLANDS ABOVE EDOLAS

225
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,083
ARE DEPENDENT UPON OUR
MAGIC POWER TO STAY AFLOAT.

226
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:54,208
IF THEY'RE FALLING, OUR WORST
FEARS HAVE BEEN REALIZED.

227
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,750
SORRY, I WISH THAT
I COULD SAVE YOU

228
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,750
FROM THE HORRORS
YOU'VE ENDURED TODAY.

229
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,125
- ( both gasp )

230
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,375
- Earth Land Erza: 
AM I HALLUCINATING?

231
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,208
- I SEE IT TOO. I'M NOT
SURE WHAT TO MAKE OF IT.

232
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,125
IT CAN'T BE.

233
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,125
IS THAT OUR MAGIC?

234
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,666
- YES, BUT WHAT'S CAUSING IT?

235
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,583
- ( frightened chatter )

236
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,250
- AH, SO IT'S FINALLY
COME TO PASS, HAS IT?

237
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,291
- Hughes: BYRO!
- ( snorts )

238
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,083
YOU TWO?
STILL ALIVE, I SEE.

239
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,875
- HMM,
IT'S SURPRISINGLY BEAUTIFUL.

240
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,750
- BEAUTIFUL?! WHAT IN THE HECK
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, MAN?

241
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,708
- THE MAGIC POWER OF COURSE.

242
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,500
I GUESS I'M JUST SHOCKED.

243
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,333
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
THE SIGHT OF SURGING POWER

244
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,916
WOULD BE FRIGHTENING,
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE SERENE.

245
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,500
- Pantherlily: PRINCE!

246
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,791
- THIS IS FOR THE BEST, LILY.

247
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:09,458
THE PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS
FOUGHT OVER POWER.

248
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,541
I TRIED TO WARN THEM,
BUT THEY COULDN'T

249
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,500
LET GO OF TEMPTATION.

250
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,750
SO I SHALL REMOVE
THAT TEMPTATION. 

251
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,708
THE LAST OF OUR POWER
WILL POUR

252
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,291
INTO THE REVERSE ANIMA.

253
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:24,125
ONCE IT REACHES EARTH LAND,
IT WILL BE ABSORBED

254
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,541
BY THE ALREADY ABUNDANT
MAGIC POWER THERE

255
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,375
AND BECOME PART OF NATURE.

256
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,375
FOR THE SAKE
OF EDOLAS'S FUTURE,

257
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:34,875
IT MUST FIRST
BE BROUGHT TO RUIN.

258
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,666
- ( frightened chatter )

259
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:43,041
- MY WEAPON ISN'T
RESPONDING TO MY COMMANDS.

260
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,708
- WHAT THE HECK'S
GOING ON?!

261
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,708
- THEY'RE NOT WORKING!
- NO!

262
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,458
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
- WHAT'S WITH OUR WEAPONS?

263
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,958
- EVERYONE'S FREAKING OUT.

264
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,416
- MY WEAPON!
NO, WHAT'S HAPPENING?!

265
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,291
- JUST CALM DOWN, MAN.
- IT'S OVER.

266
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,333
I GUESS THIS IS THE END.

267
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,416
- CARLA?

268
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,833
- Wendy: IT'S PURE MAGIC POWER.

269
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,250
- ARE YOU SURE?

270
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,750
- THIS AIN'T GOOD.

271
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,541
WHAT'LL HAPPEN
IF IT ALL DISAPPEARS?

272
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,958
- RETREAT!
- ( screaming )

273
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,041
- WE'RE COMPLETELY HELPLESS!

274
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:42,458
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
- THEY GAVE UP.

275
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,125
HEY, CHECK IT OUT, YOU GUYS.
WE JUST WON.

276
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,166
- WHETHER WE WON OR NOT
DOESN'T MATTER.

277
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,125
NOT NOW.
WE'RE DOOMED!

278
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,875
- WE CAN'T USE MAGIC AGAIN?

279
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,083
HOW'RE WE SUPPOSED
TO SURVIVE WITHOUT IT?

280
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,541
- THIS WILL BE A DAY OF MOURNING
FOR THE REST OF TIME

281
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:56,958
OR AT LEAST UNTIL WE DIE.

282
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,583
- MAYBE WE'D
BE BETTER OFF DEAD.

283
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,625
WITHOUT MAGIC,
WE'RE ALL SCREWED.

284
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,875
IT'S GAME OVER FOR US.
- UGH!

285
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,208
WE'LL HAVE TO DISBAND 'CAUSE
WHAT GOOD'S A WIZARD GUILD

286
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,333
WITHOUT MAGIC?

287
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,125
- YOU GUYS, JUST CHILL OUT.

288
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,875
EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY.

289
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,458
- HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?

290
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:12,625
I DON'T THINK THAT YOU GET

291
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,333
THAT OUR MAGIC
IS DISAPPEARING.

292
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,500
ALL OF IT! DON'T YOU SEE
WHAT THAT MEANS FOR FAIRY TAIL?!

293
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,000
- IT'S ALL OVER.

294
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,750
WE WON THE BATTLE, 
BUT LOST THE WORLD.

295
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,500
GUESS YOU'D CALL THIS 
A BITTERSWEET VICTORY.

296
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:24,916
- WE FOUGHT THE GOOD FIGHT,

297
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,708
BUT WE STILL LOST
EVERYTHING IN THE END.

298
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,125
I WAS AFRAID
THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

299
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,500
- OH NO!
I'M SO SCARED, JUVIA!

300
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,458
WHAT'RE WE GONNA DO NOW?!

301
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,083
- I'M TOTALLY
FREAKING OUT HERE.

302
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,583
- THIS CAN'T BE IT!

303
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,583
THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOMETHING WE CAN DO!

304
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,583
- WE CAN'T STOP
THE END OF THE WORLD!

305
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,041
- I'M AFRAID
EDOLAS IS DONE FOR.

306
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,708
- YOU CAN'T LOSE HOPE.

307
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:47,333
- UNBELIEVABLE.

308
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:51,125
I LIVED LONG ENOUGH
TO WATCH EDOLAS DIE LIKE THIS.

309
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:54,208
WILL OUR STRENGTH ENDURE?
I DOUBT IT.

310
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,958
- DAD, I'M SCARED.

311
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,041
IS A FLOATING ISLAND
GONNA FALL ON OUR HOUSE?

312
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,375
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW, SON.

313
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,500
- ( panicked chatter )

314
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,416
- I DON'T THINK
WE'RE ESCAPING THIS FATE.

315
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,166
THERE'S NOWHERE TO RUN.

316
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,791
OUR CHERISHED WORLD
IS DYING.

317
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,791
- Old Woman: THIS IS TERRIBLE.

318
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,875
MAGIC POWER IS FLOWING
FROM THE LAND INTO THE HEAVENS.

319
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,500
- Girl: REALLY, GRANDMA?

320
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,333
- THIS MUST BE OUR PUNISHMENT
FOR DEFYING THE EXCEEDS

321
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,541
AND THEIR QUEEN.

322
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,166
- Sugarboy: HMM,
SO IT'S BEGUN.

323
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,958
- THE BEGINNING
OF THE END, YOU MEAN.

324
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,833
WHAT A WAY TO GO.

325
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,000
BUT EDOLAS HAD
A PRETTY GOOD RUN, HUH?

326
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:54,333
- HMM, PERHAPS WE SHOULDN'T
BE SO RELAXED ABOUT THIS.

327
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:57,916
NOT JUST THE ROYAL CITY,
BUT ALL OF EDOLAS

328
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,250
IS WITHERING
BEFORE OUR EYES.

329
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,000
- A WORLD WITHOUT MAGIC POWER.

330
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,875
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE IT.
CAN YOU?

331
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,291
- THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

332
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,833
I NEVER ONCE CONSIDERED IT
A POSSIBILITY.

333
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,833
I DOUBT I'M THE ONLY ONE.

334
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,875
- ( screaming )
- WE FACE A GREAT CALAMITY.

335
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,791
AND I'M NOT SURE
WE WILL SURVIVE IT.

336
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,708
- ( screaming )

337
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,791
- ( gasping )

338
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,583
- ( cries )

339
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,500
- THIS IS BAD, GRANNY.

340
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:33,000
IT LOOKS LIKE
THE SKY RIVER'S FALLING.

341
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,666
- HOW THE HECK
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO FISH NOW?

342
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,791
- I THINK WE SHOULD
HEAD BACK TO THE ROYAL CITY.

343
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,708
- ANY PARTICULAR REASON? - IF
THE CITIZENS START PANICKING,

344
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,375
A LOT OF PEOPLE COULD GET HURT.
WE NEED TO GO OUT THERE

345
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,083
AND SEE IF THERE'S SOME WAY
THAT WE COULD HELP.

346
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,208
- YEAH, AND IF WE CAN FIND
THIS WORLD'S ME,

347
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,625
HE MIGHT KNOW WHAT TO DO.

348
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,041
- ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO.

349
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,875
- WAIT FOR ME!

350
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,583
- ( all groan )

351
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,958
- THE END OF THE WORLD, HUH?

352
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:07,458
- ( frightened muttering )

353
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,916
- PRINCE, I AGREE OUR
DEPENDENCE ON MAGIC

354
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,916
HAS LED TO BLOODSHED.

355
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,166
BUT THIS...

356
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,708
- I KNOW.

357
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,041
THE PEOPLE OF EDOLAS
HAVE A HARD ROAD TO TREAD.

358
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,416
MANY WILL FIND IT 
DIFFICULT TO ADAPT

359
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,166
TO THIS CHANGING WORLD
AND COULD DIE.

360
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,416
- HMM.

361
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:38,041
- EVEN MY FIRE LACRIMA'S
OUT OF MAGIC?

362
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,375
- IT IS FOR THAT REASON

363
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:43,166
A LEADER MUST STEP FORWARD
AND GUIDE THEM.

364
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,291
A NEW RULER FOR
A BRAND-NEW EDOLAS...

365
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,666
ONE WHO CAN GATHER
THE DESPERATE AND FRIGHTENED

366
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,666
AND BRAVELY SHEPHERD THEM
OUT OF THESE DARK TIMES. 

367
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,333
- AND YOU'RE SAYING
THIS NEW LEADER IS YOU?

368
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,750
- NO.

369
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,541
I CAN'T RULE THIS WORLD.

370
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,666
INSTEAD OF GROWING WITH
EDOLAS AS ITS PRINCE,

371
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,875
I CHOSE TO RESIDE
IN EARTH LAND.

372
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,916
SO I HAVE NO RIGHT
TO ITS THRONE.

373
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,250
WE'LL NEED A HERO
TO UNIFY THE MASSES,

374
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,125
ONE WHO'LL VANQUISH
THE VILLAIN WHO CAUSED THIS.

375
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:17,041
- YOU MEAN
THE SACRIFICIAL LAMB?

376
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,166
- WHOEVER
ELIMINATES THE ONE

377
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,041
WHO PLUNGED
THE WORLD INTO CHAOS

378
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,708
IS BOUND TO BECOME
A TRUE HERO TO THE PEOPLE.

379
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,916
AND THAT HERO WILL UNIFY
THE SCATTERED SURVIVORS 

380
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,291
AND BECOME THEIR RULER.

381
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,791
- ( frightened muttering )

382
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,750
- Man #1: HEY, THE WATER LACRIMA
JUST WENT OUT!

383
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,750
- Woman #1: SO DID OUR
FIRE LACRIMA AT HOME! 

384
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,583
- Man #2: MY VEHICLE
STOPPED RUNNING!

385
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,666
- Man #3: ALL THE LACRIMA'S
IN THE CITY ARE RUNNING DRY.

386
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,958
- Woman #2: WE'RE DONE FOR!

387
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,625
- Man #4: WHY IS THIS
HAPPENING TO US?

388
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:49,291
- SO TELL ME, WHO WILL
PLAY THE PART IN THIS CHARADE?

389
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:52,875
- LOOK, THE WRITING
IS ON THE WALL.

390
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,875
I TRIED TO OVERTHROW THE KING
WITH AN ARMED REBELLION.

391
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,875
NOW I'VE STRIPPED THE WORLD
OF IT'S POWER

392
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,541
AND PLUNGED IT INTO CHAOS.

393
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,333
IT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS

394
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,833
THAT SINCE I'M THE MAN
BEHIND THESE TERRIBLE DEEDS,

395
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,875
THERE'S ONLY ONE ROLE
I COULD POSSIBLY PLAY.

396
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,875
BUT YOU ARE RESPECTED
ON BOTH SIDES.

397
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,958
YOU CAN BE EXEMPT
FROM PREJUDICE.

398
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,875
YOU ARE THE HERO.

399
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,916
SLAY ME AND
BECOME THE RULER.

400
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,208
- ( screaming )

401
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:24,958
- Man #5: OH, DIVINE GODS,
SAVE US FROM THIS CALAMITY!

402
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,666
- ( townspeople scream )

403
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,791
- HEY, THE WORLD'S
COMING TO AN END. 

404
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:36,875
WHAT ARE YOU WRITING ABOUT?

405
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,416
- I'M NOTING WHAT I SEE.

406
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,291
WE'RE WITNESSING HISTORY
IN THE MAKING HERE, SIR.

407
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,416
IT'S OUR DUTY AS CITIZENS

408
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,083
TO RECORD THIS FOR 
FUTURE GENERATIONS.

409
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,583
- WHATEVER YOU SAY.

410
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,583
- TAKE ME BEFORE
THE POPULACE

411
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,541
AND EXECUTE ME
FOR MY CRIMES.

412
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,250
AFTER THAT, THEY WILL
FOLLOW YOU TO ANY FATE.

413
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,625
AS A CAPTAIN
IN THE ROYAL ARMY

414
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:05,791
AND A MEMBER OF 
THE EXCEED RACE,

415
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:09,916
YOU CAN QUELL THE CHAOS.
BECOME THEIR SAVIOR!

416
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,875
YOU ARE THE RULER
THEY NEED.

417
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:15,208
LEAD THE PEOPLE INTO
A WORLD WITHOUT MAGIC.

418
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,291
- ( growls )

419
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,708
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THE ONLY WAY

420
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:34,875
TO SAVE THIS KINGDOM
IS FOR YOU TO DIE?! 

421
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,625
ANSWER ME, PRINCE!

422
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,875
- ( theme music plays )

423
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:44,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

424
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,125
- Natsu: WHAT DO YOU
THINK'S GONNA HAPPEN

425
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:16,208
TO THIS WORLD NOW
THAT IT'S OUT OF MAGIC POWER?

426
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:17,625
- Happy: I HAVE NO IDEA.

427
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,416
IT'S KIND OF HARD
TO EVEN IMAGINE

428
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,166
'CAUSE MAGIC'S SUCH
AN IMPORTANT PART

429
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,208
OF OUR WORLD, YOU KNOW?
- YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT 

430
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:24,916
WHAT MATTERS MOST
IN OUR LIVES.

431
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,250
I'D SAY IT'S FRIENDSHIP.
PEOPLE YOU CAN TRUST

432
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:28,583
WHO'LL BE THERE
WHEN YOU NEED 'EM.

433
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,291
THAT'S WAY MORE
IMPORTANT, RIGHT?

434
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:33,250
- ( Happy and Natsu speaking )

435
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,583
- Happy: EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE
YOU CAN SAY SOMETHING

436
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:37,416
PRETTY PROFOUND.
- IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,

437
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,000
I'D THINK THAT
WAS AN INSULT.

438
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:41,166
- DON'T BE SILLY.
I'M PRAISING YOU.
