00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,291
[MAKAROV]
What about her father?

161
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,166
He was Sabertooth's
former master, as I recall.

162
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,208
He hasn't been seen or
heard from since the tournament.

163
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,791
[LAKI]
No loss there.

164
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,666
Sting is a much better master
than that old crank ever was.

165
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,916
It must be awesome to have

166
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,541
such a hot, young hunk
for a guildmaster!

167
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,416
Ain't that the truth, sister.

168
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,291
I should probably make sure
the Council knows Sabertooth

169
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,875
is under new management.

170
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,791
[ERZA] I plan to contact Sting,
as well, once things slow down.

171
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,041
I have a surprise for
you, my darling Gray!

172
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,166
[GRAY]
Uh...

173
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,833
Something warm for
you to munch on!

174
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:03,791
Ah!

175
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,708
[JUVIA]
I call them Graybuns!

176
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,708
Well, they do look pretty tasty,

177
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,583
but it would feel weird
to gnaw on my own face.

178
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,208
I thought you'd say that.

179
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:15,208
Guess I'll keep all the
Graybuns for myself.

180
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:19,166
Which means you get to
enjoy these hot Juvibuns!

181
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,708
[GRAY]
You set me up!

182
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,333
Did I miss something?

183
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,208
I could have sworn he already
gave Juvia a clear-cut answer

184
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,708
in the form of a 'No'.

185
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,041
I don't think she accepted it.

186
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,666
[chomp] Pretty good!

187
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,208
[JUVIA screams]

188
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,583
Oh yeah! It tastes super manly!

189
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,208
You have an amazing talent
for saying the wrong thing.

190
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,666
This is awful!

191
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,500
Not only did another man
get a mouthful of my buns,

192
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,500
he said they tasted
like masculinity!

193
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,166
You went through
all the trouble.

194
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,000
I might as well eat one.

195
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,166
Oh, my darling! That's a--

196
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,416
Graybun.

197
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,875
[GRAY grunts]

198
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,375
I found something.

199
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,125
[ALL]
Hm?

200
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:02,000
It's about E.N.D. Apparently,
he's a super demon.

201
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,250
Compared to Lullaby and Deliora,

202
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,000
he's on a different
level altogether.

203
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:10,375
It really is the most powerful
Demon from the Book of Zeref.

204
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,000
So, how do we beat it?

205
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:15,375
No clue. I'm not even sure what
the Book of Zeref really is.

206
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,000
Don't look at me.

207
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:20,625
Zeref created demons.
They're pure evil.

208
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,166
After he was done,

209
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,958
he committed the spells for
summoning them into those books.

210
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,166
[HAPPY] So if someone
got their hands on one,

211
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,791
they could summon a demon
just by reading them?

212
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:33,916
[CARLA] Yes, and each demon
has a book dedicated to it.

213
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,375
So, there's a chance
Tartaros has one of 'em.

214
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:39,291
I'd bet it's Probably the one
for summoning E.N.D.

215
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,875
Also, there's the fact Igneel

216
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,833
tried to take the
creep out before.

217
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,291
Yeah. I figured it out.

218
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,791
Huh? Figured what out?

219
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,791
We gotta take the
fight to Tartaros!

220
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:51,750
Count me in!

221
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,333
[LUCY]
You're both brain dead!

222
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:56,083
Besides, there is way too
much we don't know about

223
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,708
their guild yet. We don't
even know where they are.

224
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,791
Let alone how many creep-tastic
demons they'll

225
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:04,541
be throwing our way. Just how
do you plan to take it to them?

226
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:08,625
I don't know. Still, it might
get us closer to finding Igneel.

227
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:11,083
[WENDY]
That's true, and Grandeeney.

228
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:15,041
Who knows, maybe Metalicana has
somethin' to do with this, too.

229
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,458
[door opens]

230
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:19,791
Listen up, everybody!
I've got horrible news!

231
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,583
[NATSU]
Uh.

232
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,083
--[ERZA] Uh...
--[MAKAROV] Mm?

233
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,875
[JUVIA, GRAY]
Uh?

234
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,416
--[WENDY] Uh!
--[GAJEEL] Hm.

235
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,875
[LUCY gasps]

236
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:10,291
And here I was startin' to get
lonely. What a sweetheart.

237
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,791
I assume you heard what
happened upstairs.

238
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,250
Don't be stupid.

239
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,166
You know I can't use
magic inside this cell.

240
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,416
That said, it was hard not
to notice the explosions.

241
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,541
You're telling me everything
you know about Tartaros.

242
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,791
Is that so?
I don't talk for free.

243
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,708
But you'll get what you want,
if you release the seis.

244
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,958
[DORANBOLT] I don't have
that kind of authority.

245
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,833
Then I suggest that you go
and talk to someone who does.

246
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,916
[DORANBOLT growls]

247
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,125
[DORANBOLT] The Council
members. They're all dead.

248
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,583
[COBRA]
Uh!

249
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:48,833
Hm. Sounds like they got
you pretty good.

250
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,541
I lost a friend today.

251
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,083
I'm not in the mood for
games, understand?

252
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,958
I'll give you just one more
chance. Talk or die here.

253
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:01,833
[COBRA] Hmph. Not until you
release the Oracion Seis.

254
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,583
You're not the only
one with friends.

255
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,583
[DORANBOLT growls]

256
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:11,833
[COBRA] Tell you what. I'll give
you a little tip, on the house.

257
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:21,000
[KYOKA gasps]
It's been a while, Silver.

258
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:25,833
Looking good, Kyoka.
I'm digging the evil entourage.

259
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,458
[KYOKA] I'm surprised
you came in human form.

260
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:31,250
[SILVER]
Manly, isn't it? Suits me.

261
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,625
[KYOKA] Any sign of
Jackal or Tempester yet?

262
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,000
[FRANMALTH]
They're too busy

263
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,875
stirrin' up trouble for the
council. He, he, he, he.

264
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:42,041
So, the operation has already
begun in earnest, has it?

265
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:46,583
Very well, let's show the humans
the power of the netherworld,

266
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:51,375
and the hell the Nine Demon
Gates can unleash.

267
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:55,291
[COBRA] No one in Tartaros
is remotely human.

268
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,041
They're all demons.
From the Book of Zeref.

269
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,125
[DORANBOLT gulps]

270
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,416
[COBRA]
Their master's name is E.N.D.

271
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,750
The most powerful demon
there's ever been.

272
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:09,166
[laughs] Sounds like
Jackal went all out!

273
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,666
The poor fools didn't even know
what hit them! Ha, ha, ha!

274
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,166
How much are the council
members lives worth?

275
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,166
Ohh, I'm droolin' at
the thought of it!

276
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,625
[TORAFUZAR]
Enough, Franmalth.

277
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,875
Quit laughing like
a damn banshee.

278
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,750
It makes us look like
undignified animals.

279
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,916
[EZEL] Demons got no
business being dignified!

280
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,541
Let me take the next
shot at them, Kyoka!

281
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,916
I got a fever, and the only
cure is making corpses!

282
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,125
Don't forget, all stories have
an order to them, Ezel.

283
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,708
This one has just begun.

284
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:42,583
In fact, one could say
this is merely the prologue.

285
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,500
Precisely. Just calm down, Ezel.

286
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:48,333
You'll have a task all to
yourself soon enough.

287
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:51,250
Fine. But don't make
me wait much longer!

288
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,083
Jackal and Tempester
shouldn't get all the fun!

289
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,750
[TORAFUZAR]
Mm.

290
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:59,166
[KEYES] Netherworld,
we beseech thee.

291
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:04,750
Grant us your dark blessings
that we may serve you.

292
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:09,083
[KYOKA] And may our lord,
Zeref, be pleased.

293
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,833
[SILVER]
Hm.

294
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:16,416
[KYOKA] All that we do,
we do for him. Our creator.

295
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,416
Now, then, let's pay
humanity a visit.

296
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:26,125
[CROWD chatting]

297
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,250
[YAJIMA sighs]
It's such a terrible tragedy.

298
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,250
So hard to believe it's true.

299
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,416
I heard all nine of the council
members were killed instantly.

300
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,125
[YAJIMA]
That's not the half of it.

301
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:43,000
There were one hundred
nineteen other casualties.

302
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,041
A truly dark day.

303
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,083
[BIXLOW]
Guess it's a good thing

304
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,125
you quit the Council
when you did.

305
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:51,625
Shame on you! Have some
respect for the dead!

306
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,875
We do. We're just glad you
weren't there with them.

307
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,500
Oh, well. I guess
I should've known.

308
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,250
Something was bound to
happen in Era eventually.

309
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,666
You think? But why?

310
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,875
[YAJIMA]
Because of what it represents.

311
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,916
Era serves as headquarters
for the Magic Council.

312
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,958
Making it a symbol that holds
all the legitimate guilds, and,

313
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,625
by extension, the
wizards, together.

314
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,833
Being a council member means
you share part of that symbol,

315
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,375
and the responsibilities
that come with it.

316
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,666
I did everything I could
to serve the people.

317
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:27,083
But as you are aware, the
council was far from perfect.

318
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,041
It's no secret that
it was plagued

319
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,875
with administration problems.

320
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,375
Jellal being one of
the most prevalent.

321
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,125
Between their occasional
lapses in judgment,

322
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:39,708
and the sheer number
of overbearing policies,

323
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:43,916
I never found a chance
to really make my mark.

324
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,208
When I finally quit the Council
and opened up my restaurant,

325
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,875
I was actually relieved.

326
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:53,958
It felt like a great weight had
been lifted from my shoulders.

327
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,500
[FRIED]
As it should.

328
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,583
[YAJIMA] Indeed, a weight
had been lifted, but...

329
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,708
You still had some
doubts, right?

330
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,250
I couldn't shake the feeling

331
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,125
that we were heading
towards calamity.

332
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,916
Authority will always give
rise to strong opposition,

333
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,083
it's the way of the world.

334
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:12,791
And Considering the Council's
utterly uncompromising nature,

335
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,791
it was only a matter of
time before a bad decision

336
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,583
ticked off the wrong
kind of people.

337
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,958
But this mess...
I never could have predicted.

338
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,291
[BIXLOW]
Mm..

339
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,458
[EVERGREEN]
Okay, that's it.

340
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,250
I know the place is empty,

341
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,375
but that doesn't mean
you don't have to work!

342
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:32,500
Yeah, well. That uniform
doesn't work for you.

343
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:33,500
No.

344
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,083
You're the reason
I'm wearing it!

345
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,958
Jerks. Sheesh.

346
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,375
Ever since we won the games,
you've done nothing but complain

347
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,958
about all the heavy-duty
jobs we've had.

348
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,000
That's why we're
working in this dump.

349
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,625
You know, you could
at least pretend

350
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,541
to care that I'm
right in front of you.

351
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,375
[FRIED] Preparing food
happens to be my specialty.

352
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,125
[BIXLOW] And serving food
is my specialty, baby!

353
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,041
[TOMMEN]
Serve it up!

354
00:19:56,125 --> 00:20:01,375
[EVERGREEN] Well, I suppose,
being sexy is my specialty.

355
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:04,541
Anyway. Why isn't Loxus
back with the supplies yet?

356
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,458
It's been hours.

357
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,583
Five Jewel says
he lost his way.

358
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:11,041
He's able to defeat an army,
but falls to menial tasks.

359
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,625
--[door creaks]
--[gasps]

360
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,666
Speak of the devil!

361
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,000
Uh!

362
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:28,833
Whoosh.

363
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,583
[YAJIMA screams]

364
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:34,541
[BIXLOW screams]

365
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,166
[EVERGREEN screams]

366
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,625
Whirr.

367
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,125
[YAJIMA gasps]

368
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,333
What is this guy?

369
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,041
Yajima, no!

370
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:49,875
[FRIED groans]

371
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,708
Ka-boom!

372
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:57,583
[screams]

373
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:58,875
Fwoosh.

374
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,625
[YAJIMA screams]

375
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,125
Mr. Yajima!

376
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:06,208
Fairy Machine Gun! Leprechaun!

377
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,208
You're helpless.

378
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,916
[CROWD shouting]

379
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,375
[EVERGREEN groaning]

380
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:19,875
Ever!

381
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,666
He creamed us.

382
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,125
[YAJIMA stammers]

383
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,458
Who the hell are you?

384
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,416
[STRANGER]
I have no name.

385
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,666
Though humans have
a word for me.

386
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,166
They call me disaster.
A force of nature.

387
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,416
[BIXLOW groaning] What's with
his magic? I can't move!

388
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,125
And he's barely even touched us.

389
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,291
[STRANGER]
The netherworld gate has opened.

390
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:49,666
--Humanity will be judged.
--[YAJIMA groaning]

391
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,333
Netherworld gate?

392
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:54,708
He's from Tartaros,
no doubt about it.

393
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:58,458
[FRIED] So, that means...
It wasn't just the nine.

394
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:01,916
They're going after former
members of the Council as well.

395
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,583
But why? What could
Tartaros be after?

396
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,458
Say your prayers.

397
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,541
Let him go!

398
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:09,250
[STRANGER]
Too late.

399
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,000
[YAJIMA screams]

400
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,083
Yajima!

401
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:17,625
[STRANGER growls]

402
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:18,458
[YAJIMA]
Uh.

403
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:19,333
[FRIED]
Uh!

404
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:20,625
[BIXLOW]
Hm.

405
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,291
[STRANGER]
Mm.

406
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:37,416
[LAXUS] Those are my
pals you're messin' with.

407
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,750
If you thought you're
getting away with this,

408
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:42,333
you're in for a real shock.

409
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:15,625
[LUCY] Someone from Tartaros
calling himself "Disaster"

410
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:18,625
attacked our friend Yajima, a
former member of the Council.

411
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,625
He over-powered the
Thunder Legion,

412
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:23,250
but now he has to deal
with a ticked off Laxus.

413
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:24,916
It doesn't matter who
we're up against,

414
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,375
Fairy Tail will fight anyone
that hurts our members.

415
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,083
Even if they're demons!

416
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:32,791
As the rubble starts to fall,
our fury begins to rise!

417
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,208
Next time!

418
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:37,083
Tartaros Chapter, Prologue
- Fairies vs. Netherworld!

419
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:40,416
Then again, Laxus has
enough fury for all of us.
