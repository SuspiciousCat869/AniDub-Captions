[CROWD cheers]

2
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,250
[CHAPATI] It's the final day
of the Grand Magic Games

3
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,625
and the competition's
really heating up!

4
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,583
The ladies of Mermaid Heel
have been pushed back

5
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,500
to fourth place with
forty-three points.

6
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:29,166
Well, that's what
happens when you lose

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,125
three team members
right off the bat.

8
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,125
Geez, way to point out
the obvious, Grandpa.

9
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,375
I can't believe I
went down so easily.

10
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,416
Well, it's not like
we did any better.

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,125
[CHAPATI] And neck and
neck in second place,

12
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:43,916
with forty-nine points each,
are Lamia Scale and Sabertooth!

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,166
Our kids have their work
cut out for them, don't they?

14
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,666
Only the most powerful
competitors remain.

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,208
And in first place,

16
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,875
with fifty points and every
single member still standing.

17
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:55,000
Give it up for Fairy Tail!

18
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,208
[CROWD cheers]

19
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,250
Gotta say, their initial
strategy threw me off.

20
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,750
I thought they were
goners, didn't you?

21
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,083
I figured it was
part of their plan.

22
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,791
[YAJIMA] Once they
sprang into action,

23
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,625
they dominated the competition.

24
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,375
But a Fairy Tail
push like that

25
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:10,583
is always gonna cause quite
a bit of damage to the city.

26
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:12,791
[CHAPATI] I'm told it'll
be restored using magic.

27
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,583
[CHAPATI] Well spank my butt
and call me Quatro Puppy!

28
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:17,875
We've got an exciting new
development on our hands!

29
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:19,166
It looks like we're
about to witness

30
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,791
an incredible three-way battle

31
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:23,875
between Fairy Tail's Erza,
Mermaid Heel's Kagura,

32
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,041
and Sabertooth's Minerva!

33
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:27,750
[YAJIMA] These fierce
ladies might just bring

34
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:30,833
this tournament to an
earthshaking climax!

35
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,833
[JELLAL]
Reveal your identity.

36
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:07,833
I have already revealed mine.

37
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,208
A woman?

38
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,541
[JELLAL gasps]

39
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,916
There's no way!

40
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,583
[HAPPY]
Erza vs. Kagura!

41
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,041
What the...?!

42
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,666
Is that me?!

43
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,541
Wow, she looks
just like Lucy!

44
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,625
Does that mean they're
the same person?

45
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,666
There's no way.
That has to be Gemini, right?

46
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,375
I still say that's
the one from Edolas.

47
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,625
[FUTURE LUCY] I know that
you've heard of Eclipse by now.

48
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:49,333
I was able to use its powers
to meet with you today.

49
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,708
[GROUP gasps]

50
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,125
You used the Eclipse?
But that would mean...

51
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:57,041
...you've come from
another time, haven't you?

52
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,625
Yes, from the future.

53
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,458
[GROUP yells]

54
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,750
What's going on?

55
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,125
Why'd you decide to
come back to our time?

56
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,791
[FUTURE LUCY whimpers]

57
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,708
[FUTURE LUCY]
I came to warn you.

58
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,791
This kingdom is doomed.

59
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:11,875
[NATSU gasps]

60
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:12,916
[LUCY gasps]

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,875
[NATSU] Hey!

62
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,750
[WENDY]
Is she gonna be okay?

63
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,500
[CARLA] She fainted but
she's still breathing.

64
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,208
I think she'll be alright.

65
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,583
What in the heck is
goin' on around here?

66
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,875
I don't have any idea.

67
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:27,125
[CARLA] A Lucy
from the future...

68
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,583
But what could
this mean...?

69
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,750
Could my vision
be coming true?

70
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,541
You holding up okay?

71
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,458
I just don't understand
why I would do this.

72
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:41,125
Unless I was desperate.

73
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,916
At any rate, we'd
better take her with us.

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,625
We can work the rest out later.

75
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,125
Then, once we're
outside the castle,

76
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,375
we'll launch
the signal flare.

77
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,625
Right.

78
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:50,916
The rest of the guild
will be happy to know

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,416
that we've rescued Lucy.

80
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,875
[NATSU] Not to brag, but we
even got ourselves a spare.

81
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,208
Princess, there's something
I don't understand.

82
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:04,041
You need a Celestial wizard
to open the Eclipse door,

83
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,625
and yet you threw
the two you had

84
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:08,208
into the Palace of Perdition.

85
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:11,166
Why would you hinder
your own plans like that?

86
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,041
It doesn't make sense.

87
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,000
[HISUI] It does
and it doesn't...

88
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,375
I only needed the
twelve zodiac keys,

89
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,958
not the wizards
themselves, but...

90
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,708
I acted cruelly.

91
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,541
[DARTON] If it

92
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,541
then why did you return
them to their wizards?

93
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,750
It seems rather
foolish to toss aside

94
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,125
keys to a door you
wish to pass through.

95
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,250
[HISUI] The keys are
no longer needed.

96
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:38,250
[DARTON] Hm?
Why is that, Princess?

97
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,750
[HISUI] Because I've
already used them...

98
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,083
The doorway through
space and time

99
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,541
is now unlocked.

100
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,958
All that's left is for
someone to open the door

101
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,375
and walk through it.

102
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,458
And is this
someone prepared

103
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,750
to accept responsibility
for the lives

104
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,375
which they may ruin
by changing history?

105
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,875
[HISUI] I can't shoulder
this burden alone...

106
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,750
That's why I wanted
Arcadios by my side.

107
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,125
And why I sought your approval.

108
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,583
[DARTON] Hm...

109
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,750
Whether we open
Eclipse or not

110
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:29,375
depends on the outcome
of the games...

111
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,791
For now...
we must wait

112
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,625
and see how it unfolds.

113
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,958
[MINERVA] Hm.

114
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,000
[KAGURA]
Release her at once!

115
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,375
[MINERVA]
Perhaps in a bit,

116
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:45,875
but first I plan to show you
how a queen wages war.

117
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,916
This is your
last chance.

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,208
release my comrade and
I will allow you to live.

119
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,375
[MILLIANNA sobs]

120
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,625
If you want to save her,
come and take her.

121
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,166
[KAGURA grunts]

122
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,416
She's so fast!

123
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,916
You'll be the second
tiger I feast upon!

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,833
Careful, Mermaid, this one's
rather tough to swallow.

125
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,833
[BOTH] Uh!

126
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,916
[CROWD murmurs]

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,625
Ah! That's unbelievable!

128
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,625
What did she do?
I didn't see a thing!

129
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,375
Neither did I,
it was too fast!

130
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,625
Another dirty trick!

131
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,000
[KAGURA]
They switched places?!

132
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,000
[ERZA]
What kind of magic is this?!

133
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:27,458
Heh, heh. You ladies can go
ahead and battle it out.

134
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:30,166
I'll wait and take on the
victor once she's weakened.

135
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,333
[ERZA] You're running from
a fight you interrupted?!

136
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,041
And you call yourself a queen?

137
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:38,375
[MINERVA] A true queen arranges
the pawns to suit her strategy.

138
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,416
[BOTH grunt]

139
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,041
If anything you
should be flattered.

140
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,916
I must admit, I underestimated
your combined power.

141
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,166
I now realize that I
wouldn't stand a chance

142
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,583
against the two of you.

143
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,541
But in the end,
it's irrelevant.

144
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,791
A queen does not
yield to power alone.

145
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,833
[ERZA]
Let Millianna go!

146
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,625
[KAGURA]
I'm warning you...

147
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,250
Don't you dare...

148
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,000
[ERZA] Ugh!

149
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,541
Don't pretend
to be my ally!

150
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:03,791
[MINERVA] My, my.

151
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,041
It seems you ladies have
some catching up to do.

152
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,833
I'll just be on my way.

153
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,958
I accept your terms; just
leave Millianna out of this!

154
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,458
[MINERVA chuckles]

155
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,250
[ERZA] She's got us
in quite a bind.

156
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,250
[KAGURA] Be quiet...!

157
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,000
I don't speak to my enemies...

158
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,500
I destroy them.

159
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:24,916
[CHAPATI clears throat]

160
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,833
[CHAPATI] Well this is certainly
a complicated situation.

161
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,791
Tell me, Yajima,
what do you make of it?

162
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:32,208
[YAJIMA] Hm. There isn't any
rule against taking hostages

163
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,791
during the Battle Royale.

164
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,416
Therefore we have no choice
but to look at this kidnapping

165
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,708
as a tactical play.

166
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,041
You kiddin' me?!

167
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,625
She's gonna hurt Millia
unless somebody stops her!

168
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,416
I feel so helpless,
just standing here

169
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,875
watching from
the sidelines.

170
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,541
There's nothing we
can do about it...

171
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:47,708
C'mon Kagura.

172
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,666
Millia's life is
in your hands now.

173
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,250
[GAJEEL] This sucks...

174
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,916
The first master's plan's
gone right off the rails.

175
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,458
Some "fairy tactician" she is.

176
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,166
[MAVIS whimpers]

177
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,583
It's okay First Master,
we all make mistakes.

178
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,000
I keep adjusting
my calculations

179
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,333
but no matter how
I look at them,

180
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,708
that three-way fight just
shouldn't be possible!

181
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,625
Are you feelin'
okay, Levy?

182
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,708
Uh, yeah,
I'm fine...

183
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,333
Just kinda worried, I guess.

184
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,833
D'ya think he'll be all right?

185
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,083
[LISANNA] Of course he will,
he's a Dragon Slayer.

186
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,875
It takes a lot to
keep them down.

187
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,541
Yeah, you're right.

188
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,958
Good luck, Gajeel.
We're rooting for you.

189
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,875
[GAJEEL]
Well, well...

190
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:37,416
You're a pesky little bugger.

191
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,750
I ain't nowhere near
as nice as Salamander

192
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,458
so start saying your prayers.

193
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,958
[CHAPATI] Whoa!

194
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,166
Looks like a couple of dragons
are about to duke it out!

195
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,208
[FROSCH]
Be careful, Rogue...

196
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,666
[YAJIMA] Ahhh.

197
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,583
I think this matchup may prove
to be even more exciting.

198
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,000
[LAXUS]
How's it goin?

199
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,541
So you and I finally
get to square off.

200
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,625
[LAXUS] So, what's with
the black lightning?

201
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,458
Surely you've realized by now.

202
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:04,083
I'm no ordinary wizard;
I'm a Lightning God Slayer.

203
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,833
That's gonna make
it embarrassing

204
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,041
when ya get your butt
kicked by a fairy.

205
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,500
[CHAPATI] Hold me, Yajima,
I think I'm gonna faint!

206
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,708
The matchups just
keep on coming!

207
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,125
[YAJIMA] We haven't
seen Sting in a while.

208
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,750
I wonder if he'll
make an appearance.

209
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,791
[CHAPATI] That's odd...
The Lacrima-tron cameras

210
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,625
can't seem to find him
anywhere in the city.

211
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:21,916
[FROSCH whimpers]

212
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,166
[FROSCH]
Come on, guys!

213
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,041
You gotta fight extra hard
so we can get Lector back!

214
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,541
[DARTON] Hm.
It would be incredible

215
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,416
for the games to end
in such a way...

216
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,208
But I have my doubts
as to whether

217
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,000
it will actually come to pass.

218
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,541
It seems all but impossible.

219
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,500
I have the same doubts
as you, Minister...

220
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:44,333
We can only hope that
my contact is mistaken.

221
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,666
[STING] You fight
real dirty, m'lady.

222
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,166
Heh, heh. But it
ain't gonna matter.

223
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,958
Least, not after I'm finished.

224
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,750
With the plan
I got in mind,

225
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,875
there's nothing anyone can do
to keep me from winning.

226
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,916
I'm gonna make
you proud, Lector.

227
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,416
[JELLAL] I'm afraid
that we gravely mistook

228
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,000
the gravity of the situation.
If there is a joke in this,

229
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:11,000
it's that our fate
was already sealed.

230
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,541
[MELDY] What do we do
if this future Lucy

231
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:13,666
is telling the truth?

232
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,416
There's gotta be
something, right?

233
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,458
If we can't think of a plan,
the kingdom will be destroyed.

234
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,291
[JELLAL sighs]

235
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,041
Any ideas, Jellal?

236
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,541
[MELDY] But how?
How is this possible?!

237
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:25,791
[ULTEAR sighs]

238
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,250
[ULTEAR] I guess it's
still following me...

239
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,916
Even after all this time.

240
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,666
What?

241
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,000
The price of all my sins...
destruction.

242
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,916
[YOUNG MILLIANNA grunts]

243
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,875
[BUDI]
Move faster, scum!

244
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,666
[GALI] We will finish the
R-System as quickly as possible!

245
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,000
You can work to be part of it,
or you can be buried underneath.

246
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,333
You hear me?!

247
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,416
[YOUNG MILLIANNA sobs]

248
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,791
[YOUNG MILLIANNA]
I can't take it!

249
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,583
My hands hurt so bad.

250
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:08,833
[YOUNG ERZA]
Please don't cry anymore;

251
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,333
here, you can have my food too.

252
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,416
[YOUNG SIMON] You eat it, Erza;
she can have mine instead.

253
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,791
[YOUNG ERZA]
I'll be fine, Simon.

254
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,541
You need it more than I do.

255
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,375
[YOUNG SIMON] But you've
gotta be starving...

256
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,708
[YOUNG JELLAL] I had no idea
you were so strong, Erza.

257
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:20,791
[YOUNG ERZA] Huh?

258
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,125
[YOUNG JELLAL]
I haven't told you guys

259
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,750
my full name yet, have I?
It's Jellal Fernandes.

260
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,791
Cool name, but it sounds
hard to remember.

261
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,000
[YOUNG JELLAL]
And what about you?

262
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:32,000
You mean me?
It's just plain old Erza.

263
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,458
That's the only name I've got.

264
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,125
Well, you gotta
have a last name.

265
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,458
What are you doing?

266
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,958
Sorry, but I just think
your red hair's pretty...

267
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,375
I've got it!

268
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,250
What do you think about
Scarlet being your last name?

269
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:46,083
You can't just go and make up
whatever name you want!

270
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,958
It's not your choice
to make, it's hers.

271
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,916
So now I'll be
Erza Scarlet.

272
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,041
Y'sure, Erzy?

273
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,000
She actually
likes it?

274
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,833
Now I know I'll never
forget your name.

275
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,416
I just have to think
about your pretty hair.

276
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,500
[BUDI] Stupid brat.

277
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,041
Bet he thought
we'd go easy on him

278
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,833
'cause he's covering
for his friends.

279
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:05,958
[GALI] Who cares?

280
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,583
We've got a slave
revolt to deal with;

281
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,458
we can torture this one later.

282
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,041
[BUDI]
Brace yourself kid,

283
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,125
'cause you ain't gettin' outta
here till you worship our god!

284
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,500
[YOUNG JELLAL weakly]
There is no god...

285
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,833
If there were, then he would
kill you both and save us.

286
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,500
[YOUNG ULTEAR]
So much hatred...

287
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,125
You've got plenty
to share, don't you?

288
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,750
I feed off of the
suffering of others...

289
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,000
and I have gained
much power from you.

290
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,416
You're such a
fortunate boy

291
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,208
to have the honor of
speaking with a god, yes?

292
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:37,208
[YOUNG ULTEAR] The most
nefarious wizard in history...

293
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,708
I am Zeref.

294
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,208
I am hatred incarnate.

295
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:44,375
[YOUNG JELLAL] We need
to stay here, Erza...

296
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,625
[YOUNG ERZA] But we're slaves!
We'll be free once we escape!

297
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,041
[YOUNG JELLAL] There is
no freedom in this world.

298
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:54,083
Those that think they
have it are deceived.

299
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,958
But we can make
a new world...

300
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,958
A world that's
ruled by Zeref.

301
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,458
[YOUNG ERZA]
Don't be stupid!

302
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,666
This place is evil, we can
still get out of here, Jellal--

303
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,958
Ahh!

304
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,833
[YOUNG JELLAL] Fine then,
I'll let you leave.

305
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,291
Go on, have a good time
pretending to be free.

306
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,916
However...

307
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,708
I'll kill everyone you care for
if you ever come back here.

308
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,541
That's the price
of your freedom!

309
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,041
So go on!

310
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,666
That is, if you can stand
with the weight of their lives

311
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,125
on your shoulders.

312
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:23,750
[JELLAL laughs]

313
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,916
[JELLAL] In my darkest hour,
Lord Zeref called to me.

314
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,166
We are destined to create
a land of true freedom!

315
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,458
Please stop, Jellal.

316
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:32,833
You can never be free

317
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,125
as long as you're possessed
by that stupid spirit!

318
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,250
Stop letting him manipulate you!

319
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:40,166
Free yourself!

320
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,375
[ULTEAR] It was me at
the Tower of Heaven.

321
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,166
I was controlling Jellal...

322
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,000
Don't blame him for
what he was forced to do.

323
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,416
Besides...

324
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,916
I think he's been through
enough as it is.

325
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,708
[ERZA gasps]

326
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,291
The three of us have formed
an independent guild...

327
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,958
Crime Sorcière,
or "witch's crime."

328
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,458
[WENDY]
An independent guild?

329
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:08,333
[ULTEAR] Unfortunately, our one
true goal still eludes us.

330
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,791
Zeref, the dark guilds,

331
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,333
and any evil force in the world

332
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,000
that seeks to destroy
the lives of innocents.

333
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,416
We'll purge every one
of them so no wizard

334
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,250
will be possessed
by his darkness again.

335
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:23,291
I've committed a ridiculous
number of sins in my life...

336
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,958
Far too many.

337
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,125
[ULTEAR] I will never
find redemption.

338
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,958
No matter how hard I may try.

339
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,750
So what now?
Seems like at the very least

340
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,625
we should get the
citizens to evacuate.

341
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:38,958
That would only
cause panic.

342
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,208
It'd save their lives!

343
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,000
[JELLAL]
That's enough!

344
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,541
[ULTEAR and MELDY] Huh?

345
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,541
There's no guarantee that what
she said will come to pass.

346
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:45,291
[ULTEAR] What?

347
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,583
Why do you
say that?

348
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,083
I'm not quite
sure just yet.

349
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,708
But all is not as it seems.

350
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,208
Something isn't right.

351
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,708
[NATSU] Hm...

352
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,375
Somethin' doesn't
feel right...

353
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,125
Would you care
to elaborate?

354
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,833
This Lucy that I'm carryin'...

355
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,125
She's a lot lighter than you.

356
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,250
Not in the mood for
your snarky comments!

357
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,708
[HAPPY] She pro'lly lost weight
from all of her hardships.

358
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,250
[NATSU] Hear that, Lucy?

359
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,333
In the future, you're gonna find
a diet that actually works!

360
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,458
[LUCY]
You're on thin ice, pal!

361
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,916
Looks like it's time for
us to put an end to this.

362
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,375
I'm not going
to hold back.

363
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,375
I'd be insulted
if you did.

364
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,166
[ERZA] Uh!

365
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,333
Heaven's wheel!

366
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,750
Pentagram sword!

367
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,458
Grudge Sword.
Archenemy!

368
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,041
[KAGURA] Blast form!

369
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,541
[ERZA yells]

370
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,666
[KAGURA] Slicing form!

371
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,916
[ERZA] Adamantine Armor!

372
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,458
[ERZA yells]

373
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,916
That's crazy!

374
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,041
The Jupiter cannon couldn't
even break through that armor!

375
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,541
Plus she hasn't even
drawn her sword yet!

376
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,666
So powerful...

377
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,625
How did she--

378
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,416
Strange you survived.

379
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,000
[ERZA] Flight Armor!
Sonic Claw!

380
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,625
[ERZA yells]

381
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,375
I didn't even
see her attack!

382
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,083
Me either!

383
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,208
[ERZA coughs]

384
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,375
Erza's being beaten
in a swordfight?

385
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,708
That's impossible!

386
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,708
I have to admit, I never
saw this coming either.

387
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,500
[ERZA whimpers]

388
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:29,916
[CHAPATI] Incredible!

389
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,125
Kagura has struck down Erza,

390
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:36,125
the woman who wiped out all one
hundred monsters of Pandemonium!

391
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,541
[ERZA] I'm surprised.

392
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,791
To think that such
power exists...

393
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,875
I suppose that
your strength

394
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:50,625
is fueled by your
hatred for Jellal.

395
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,750
[KAGURA grunts]

396
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,666
[thud]
[ERZA groans]

397
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,875
[ERZA] If you want to
hold onto the hatred,

398
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,958
it makes no difference to me...

399
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,250
Go right ahead...

400
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:13,541
But please don't force Millianna
to go down that road with you.

401
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,541
She's moving on!

402
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,458
This was his will.

403
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:20,916
[ERZA yells]

404
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,333
And now it is
mine as well...

405
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,375
I will kill Jellal.

406
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,333
[ERZA coughs]

407
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,333
[ERZA]
What happened?

408
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,875
What drove you
to these extremes?

409
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,125
[KAGURA] The man whose
will I speak of?

410
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:41,375
It turns out you
knew him very well.

411
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:45,416
His name was Simon
and Jellal killed him.

412
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,000
He was my brother.

413
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,833
[ERZA gasps]

414
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,208
[ERZA] Simon...

415
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,291
You're his sister?!

416
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:00,416
Our family was
poor, but happy.

417
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,833
[inaudible]

418
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,875
[KAGURA] Until that happiness
was stolen from us...

419
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,208
[KAGURA] One night,

420
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:11,125
these strange men showed up
in our village...

421
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,000
[CHILDREN scream]

422
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:15,875
[KAGURA]
It was a child hunt.

423
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:19,958
I alone managed
to escape.

424
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,416
I vowed to find
my brother...

425
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,500
I spent years searching for him.

426
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:30,208
That is...
until I met Millianna.

427
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,333
I'm sorry...

428
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,666
I don't know how to say this...

429
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,166
[KAGURA] That's when I found out
my brother had been killed,

430
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,000
and how much he had suffered.

431
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,125
[ERZA whimpers]

432
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,375
[KAGURA] He was
imprisoned, tortured,

433
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,208
and enslaved for years.

434
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,916
Then he was brutally murdered.

435
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,125
I was plunged
into darkness.

436
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:56,250
That's when I took a new vow,
to avenge his death.

437
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,375
Until the time comes for
me to fulfill that vow.

438
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,125
Archenemy shall
remain in its sheath.

439
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,166
[ERZA] There's something
that you need to know...

440
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,416
Millianna didn't see
your brother die.

441
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,625
[KAGURA gasps]

442
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,750
[ERZA]
She wasn't there...

443
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:26,875
It was only Jellal,
Simon, Natsu, and me.

444
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,625
[JELLAL] I'm going to
obliterate both of you!

445
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,458
[NATSU] Watch out!
What're you doin'?!

446
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,791
It's my fault that you were
involved in this mess,

447
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,708
so the least I can
do is protect you!

448
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,208
[NATSU]
Get outta the way!

449
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,833
Heavenly body magic: Altairis!

450
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:44,125
Erza!

451
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,833
[gasps]

452
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,583
[ERZA]
Oh, Simon...?!

453
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,708
[SIMON groans]
[thud]

454
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,166
[JELLAL laughs]

455
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,916
[ERZA]
My Simon...?

456
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,541
[SIMON] Don't cry.

457
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,375
It's okay.

458
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,208
I'm happy to
give my life...

459
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:07,333
...for you.

460
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,958
Don't talk!
Just try to stay with me!

461
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,125
[SIMON]
Please don't cry...

462
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:15,083
You were the
only person...

463
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:18,000
...who made me smile.

464
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:21,625
I've always...
loved you...

465
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,958
[ERZA gasps]

466
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:30,291
[ERZA] Nooo!

467
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,208
[ERZA] I can see why
you thought Jellal

468
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:39,583
was responsible for
your brother's death...

469
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:44,250
It would be easy to let you
go on believing that, but...

470
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,833
I'm the one to blame.

471
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,958
[KAGURA gasps]

472
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,208
[KAGURA]
You'd resort to lies

473
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:52,000
just to be that
killer's scapegoat?

474
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,500
I'm sorry, but
it's the truth...

475
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,958
If I hadn't been
so incredibly weak,

476
00:21:57,041 --> 00:22:00,583
your brother would still
be alive and well today.

[KAGURA seethes]

478
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:05,125
Kagura, no!

479
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,458
Think about what
you're doing!

480
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,625
Don't let your anger
get the best of you!

[SIMON] Kagura...

[KAGURA screams]

485
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:28,041
I'm so sorry.

487
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:15,166
[HAPPY] How come Erza hasn't
beaten that mermaid girl yet?

488
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,625
She can requip and stuff!

489
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:17,833
[NATSU]
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure

490
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,500
Kagura's the toughest
wizard in her guild.

491
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,625
[HAPPY]
Maybe it's just me,

492
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:22,375
but Erza seemed like
she was kinda sad.

493
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:24,291
Do ya think we should
be worried about her?

494
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,625
[NATSU]
You gotta be kiddin' me!

495
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,458
There's no way she'd ever
give up during a fight.

496
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:29,833
If anything, you should be
worried about the other chick.

497
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:32,083
[HAPPY] You know what, Natsu?
You're right!

498

[BOTH] Next time: A Future
Racing Toward Despair!

[NATSU]
C'mon, 'lil buddy!

500
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:38,041
We gotta make it back to
the others, for Erza's sake!

501
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:39,041
[HAPPY] Yeah!

502
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:41,625
Let's go and put
her mind at ease!
