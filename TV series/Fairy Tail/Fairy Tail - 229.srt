Do I have any armor that
could fit me the way I am?

that's not what matters.

[NARRATOR] At the behest of
the Wizard Saint Warrod,

10
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,708
Natsu and a small team came
to the Village of the Sun.

11
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:05,583
There they found the
village's towering residents

12
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,916
frozen solid in
full battle array.

13
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,333
They also met a treasure hunter
guild called Sylph Labyrinth.

14
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,791
Determined to take the
village's Sacred Flame,

15
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,625
Sylph Labyrinth squared
off against Fairy Tail.

16
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:19,125
Erza left the team to look
further into what happened

17
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,041
before the village was frozen.

18
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,666
But her investigation was
cut short when her body

19
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,791
suddenly transformed
into that of a child.

20
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,125
Fairy Tail's strongest
are on the job.

21
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,083
But can they defeat
Sylph Labyrinth,

22
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,333
break the curse of ice,

23
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,916
and return the giants
to their natural state?

24
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,583
And what could've caused
Erza's transformation?

25
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:40,625
Is it connected to the ice,
or something else entirely?

26
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,583
For reasons unknown,
two others watch from afar

27
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:46,833
as the guilds compete.
The first of these is a mystery.

28
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:51,125
But the second is Minerva,
one of Erza's old rivals.

is gonna take some
getting used to.

But what should I do
in the meantime?

38
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:31,500
Ideally, I find a way to
get back to normal and soon.

39

I might be even
shorter than Wendy.

Now we can actually win!

it before, but where was I?

Hold up, man, we're comin'!

at that blonde chick's keys?

They stole from us,

[ERZA] Well, the good news is
I can still use magic. But--

My requip speed has
been cut in half.

199
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,875
Each requip drains
twice as much magic,

200
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,500
and in a body this
clumsy and small,

201
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,708
I can barely lift a sword.

extremely cold.

back to normal.

But since I have no idea
how I got this way,

00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,500
I don't know where to start.

[ERZA] You had me worried
when you disappeared

after the Grand Magic Games.
I'm glad you're okay,

but where have you been
and why are you here?

Your guild mates

When you didn't turn up after
the dragons attacked Crocus,

242
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,708
they thought you
might've been killed.

You should've told
them you were well.

[MAN] Shut up and listen.
The name's Doriate.

260
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm a member of a dark guild
called Succubus Eye.

261
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,250
[MINERVA]
I will always reign

262
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,708
over the strongest
guild in existence.

263
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,750
And I couldn't care less
if it's dark or light.

264
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:54,000
Morality means nothing to me,
it's power that I crave.

265
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,625
[ERZA] And you think
Succubus Eye is powerful?

266
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,791
[MINERVA] It's precisely
because this guild is weak

267
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,875
that I chose it. But that
will change soon enough.

268
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,750
I didn't realize you left
your dignity in Crocus.

269
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,083
What little you had.

270
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,541
My "dignity"?

271
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,875
[ERZA] Even now, Sting and
Rogue are searching for you.

272
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:13,583
Do you not feel ashamed for
abandoning your comrades?

273
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,583
They're no comrades of mine.

274
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:19,541
Sabertooth lost its fangs on the
day it stopped culling the weak.

275
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,125

nothing to me now.

00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,375
Do you seriously
mean all of that?

278
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:29,041
This has been a good chat, Erza.
Now, how about a rematch?

279
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:32,500
Though I doubt you can do much
more than cry in your state.

280
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:36,875
This sudden change. You're the
one who caused it, aren't you?

281
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,166
[MINERVA]
Oh, no.

282
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,833
You can thank my partner
in crime for that one.

283
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:44,750
I have to admit, the underworld
has some intriguing magic.

284
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,333
So your little band
of thieves've got

285
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,916
a wizard after all, huh?

286
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,916
[DORIATE] I already told
you, I'm not a thief.

287
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,916
What's wrong, are you too afraid
to face me in a fair fight?

288
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,625
You'll recall that I was
never much for fairness,

289
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,666
but the underworld has
really expanded my horizons.

290
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,041
Prepare yourself.

291
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,333
And this isn't some
trivial competition, Erza,

292
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,000
it's a fight to the death.

[DORIATE] The reduction
of your magic ability

Oh, man! Things
just got way worse!

Uhh?

[grunts]

326
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,625
[DORIATE]
What's worse?

327
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,125
Uh?

328
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,916
Blast! He got away!

329
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Works every time on suckers!

330
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:39,041
Sure, I can't fight, but
I can always run and hide!

331
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,875
This really takes me back!

332
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,791
You're almost as gullible
as old Gildarts was!

333
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:47,458
Got a voice to find! I'll deal
with you when I'm big again!

334
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:53,250
[DORIATE] I'll teach that
filthy brat to mock me.

335
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,791
And while I'm at it,

336
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,916
I should teach him what the
true meaning of fear is, too.

337

[LUCY, WENDY panting]

You okay? Can you stand?

340
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,583
[WENDY] Yeah, I'm fine.
This ice is super slippery.

341
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,416
[LUCY] Somehow we lost
track of Natsu and Gray.

342
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,416
What do we do? There are nothing
but frozen trees and stuff

343
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,791
as far as the eye can see.

344
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,750
Carla and I are gonna look
around from above, okay?

345
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,583
You keep searching down
there. We'll be back soon.

346

Uh, Lucy?

347
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,416
Have you noticed
anything odd recently?

348
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,333
[LUCY]
Yeah?

349
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,125
Odd might be an
understatement.

350
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,875
More like "freaky."
Know what I mean?

351
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,416
You can take off
the masks, guys.

352

What're you talkin'
about, "masks,"

We're cats! Your cats!

went for a little flight,

but we're back meow.

358
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,208
[RALA] We're so glad to be
back with our friends! Meow!

359
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,291
No way. Come on, guys.

360
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:59,458
You expect us to believe
you two are Happy and Carla?

[BOTH yelping]

Our disguises are perfect!

363
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,500
What sorcery allows these fiends
to see past our illusions?

364
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,333
I said I should've been the
blue cat, but didja listen?

365
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,041
I feel like Warrod's gonna pop
up and tell us we got punked.

366
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,125
Treasure hunters have
a much broader skill set

367
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,666
than I thought they would.

368
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,708
Well played, witchy ones! The
ruse is up, you've found us out!

369
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,166
Now, listen!

370
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,500
Those keys of yours look
totally rare, so pass 'em over!

371
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,000
Yeah, nice and slow, ya dig?

372
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,458
You can't just take
whatever you want!

373
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:32,333
Uh, listen. I'm sorry
that we broke your bottle.

374
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:35,250
We don't wanna fight, we're
just tryin' to help the giants.

375
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,625
If you leave us alone,
then we'll do the same.

376

The giants?

377
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,791

about those fat suckers.

there's only one thing in
this world that matters!

381

That's gettin' more treasure!

382
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,375
And we'll do whatever
it takes to do it!

But they're still alive!
Why would you attack them?

385
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,000
Because I'm tryin'
to make a point.

386
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,583
Don't keep a treasure hunter
from somethin' he wants.

387
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,875
You'd better stop.

388
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,375
Yeah, and what if I don't?

389
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,333
I do what I want, when I want.
I see somethin' shiny?

I take it, and I don't care
who gets hurt along the way.

But I won't let you
hurt those people!

If you wanna hit them

of letting you know
you're outnumbered.

are nice, but the red?

Your ability to fight back

has no bearing on my pleasure.

I have no desire to
prove myself in battle.

were about to get shot

and robbed by a powerful,

But then Flare showed up
out of nowhere and saved us!

I don't understand how
or why she got here.

But as the fight against
Sylph Labyrinth heats up,

452

I think we're gonna be glad
to have her on our side.

453
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:32,000
The hunters want
the Sacred Flame,

454
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:34,041
and they don't care
who they hurt to get it.

455
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:36,041
