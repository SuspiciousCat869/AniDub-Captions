1
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,250
[NATSU]
We've dealt with Face.

2
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,708
And your little city just
crashed and burned.

3
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:45,208
Looks like it's about time
for you boys to surrender.

4
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,250
I know you.

5
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,333
Nah. You couldn't
possibly be him.

6
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:55,666
Ah! Who, that guy?

7
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,166
He's the jerk who froze
the giants' village!

8
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,791
Oh, yeah, and on top
of that he froze me!

9
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:01,708
[GAJEEL]
Pathetic.

10
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,458
Can it!

11
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:07,416
[GAJEEL] I gotta say though.
The guy smells like you.

12
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:12,750
He has the same parfum
as my darling Gray?

13
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,958
[GRAY gasps]

14
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:19,791
Gray, no!

15
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,500
I like this one. I think
I'll take him with me!

16
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,083
What? Where?

17
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,291
[JUVIA]
 Where'd they go?

18
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,416
[GAJEEL]
No tellin'.

19
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,791
The nerve of that man.

20
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,875
I've liked Gray for
much longer than he has.

21
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,291
[KEYES]
How fascinating.

22
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:36,708
[TEMPESTER]
You've turned your backs.

23
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:40,000
Quite arrogant, considering
the calamity before you.

24
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:40,916
[GAJEEL, JUVIA, NATSU grunt]

25
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,458

[TEMPESTER]
Uh!

29
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:54,750
[GAJEEL] Good luck blowin'
me away. Iron Dragon Club!

00:03:58,541 --> 00:03:59,500
[GAJEEL grunts]

[NATSU grunts]

32
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,541
Water Slicer!

33
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,333
How're we supposed
to hurt that?!

34
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,458
[GAJEEL yells]

35
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:15,375
[KEYES] A water wielder.
Even more fascinating.

36
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,833
Keep your guards up, all right?

37
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:20,875
Shake and Rumble.

38
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,041
[NATSU groaning]

39
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,500
So strong.

40
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,333
[NATSU]
I'm fired up now!

41
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,750
Let's do this!

42
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,333
[GAJEEL]
Right!

43
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:38,250
[JUVIA] Let's make them tell us
where that old man took my Gray!

44
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,291
Come on!

45
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,750
[JUVIA, NATSU, GAJEEL yell]

46
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,416
[KEYES] 
This is far from over.

47
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,625
Uh... Well isn't
this pathetic.

48
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,083
I've managed to separate
myself from my comrades.

49
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:07,166
And right when they need
me the most. Disgraceful.

50
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:11,333
Uh?! Is that the sound
of distant thunder I hear?

51
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,083
What shall I do if it is?

52
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,958
I lost all the kiwis I
saved for emergencies.

53
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,500
I'm doomed!

54
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:23,250
[PANTHERLILY] A crate of
kiwis ripe for the taking!

55
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,583
Wait. These aren't kiwis at all!

56
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,166
They're cannonballs!

57
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,958
How could I have mistaken
these useless lumps of metal

58
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,208
for sweet, nourishing kiwis?

59
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,416
Oh for shame.

60
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,041
[PANTHERLILY]
Stay strong.

61
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:41,500
You must not let desperation
make a fool of you again.

62
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,208
[PANTHERLILY]
None of these are kiwis.

63
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,083
[HAPPY groans]

64
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,791
[PANTHERLILY]
Uh?! Huh...

65
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:51,208
Hey Happy! It's good to see you.
I'm glad you're all right.

66
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:55,291
Unfortunately, I've been
separated from Gajeel And I...

00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,833
--[HAPPY whimpers]
--[PANTHERLILY] Uh...

[screams]

69
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,666
[HAPPY] My head got
knocked up by a fungus.

70
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,916
Just like that old Midi
woman said it would.

71
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,916
Knew I should'a paid her.

72
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,125
Can you... feel it move?

73
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:26,375
Oh, no, what if Carla doesn't
think I'm handsome anymore?

74
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,875
No, uh listen...

75
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:31,166
As skull based fungi go, that
one looks almost 'dapper'.

76
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,041
Ya mean it?

77
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,416
[PANTHERLILY]
Yeah... Sure.

78
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,875
Why not?

79
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,375
[HAPPY]
"Look what I found, Grandma,

80
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,041
an Exceed with a
mushroom in his head."

81

"Good eye, child, that'll
make a delicious side dish.

00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,125
Let's cut it off and
throw it in the skillet

83
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,041
for dinner tonight."

84
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,875
So, it's stuck there, is it?

85
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,125
[HAPPY]
Aye.

86
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,541
[PANTHERLILY] I apologize in
advance if you lose your ears!

87
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,125
[HAPPY] Woah woah woah! Can't
we try something else first?!

88
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,375
[PANTHERLILY]
We can.

89
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,583
[HAPPY] Aren't we gonna
count off or something?

90
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,291
C'mon you gotta
give me a warning!

91
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:03,125
If you keep this up you're gonna
pop off my entire frickin' head!

92
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:08,041
I. Don't. Want. To. Die!

93
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,250
Shroom one. Us zero.

94
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,291
Maybe I can make it trendy.

95
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,041
[PANTHERLILY]
Best not to lie to yourself.

96
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:17,250
[HAPPY sighs] At least
Carla hasn't seen it yet.

97
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,166
What'll she say?

98
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:20,958
Ha, ha, ha!

99
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,500
[FRANMALTH] It may have
looked like I was dead,

100
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:25,166
and I did become quite weak
after Hell's Core went kaboom,

101
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,541
but I used my curse to force
this feline to absorb me!

102
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:33,750
Now, safe behind the fuzzy
ears of my foe, I'll wait.

103
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,958
These kitties will lead
me to their friends,

104
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,750
and then I'll strike!

105
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:42,583
[MACAO]
Hey, Cana! Check this out!

106
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,000
Whoa. Last I remember,
we were in that cube.

107
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,583
Now it's been destroyed?

108
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,583
Doesn't look like it
made much distance.

109
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:53,208
Yeah, we're still close to
Magnolia. Just south. I think.

110
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,333
Has anybody seen the master?

111
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,958
[DROY] I heard that he was
heading for the guild hall.

112
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,333
[WAKABA] 
I wonder why.

113
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:02,458
I'm sure it's just a smoking 
pile of rubble now.

114
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,916
[MAKAROV]
What a morbid sight this is.

115
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,750
Even Kardia Cathedral.
The pride of this town.

116
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:26,083
[MAKAROV]
The second master's final words.

117
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,666
"It's not over yet."

118
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,625
"Makarov must
unleash the light."

[WENDY gasps]

120
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,416
Where am I?!

121
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,666
Wendy!

122
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,250
Carla, hey. Wait.
Didn't we...?

123
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:13,000
[WENDY]
How are we still alive?

124
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:18,416
What about Face?!
We did stop it, didn't we?

125
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,458
[DORANBOLT]
Yes. You certainly did.

126
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,916
[WENDY]
Uh!? Doranbolt. You're here?

127
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,791
You two were heroic, truly.

128
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,500
Doranbolt showed up the instant
before Face detonated.

129
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,291
He's the reason we're alive.

130
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,833
I'm just glad I was able
to made make it in time.

131
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,875
Wait, so...

132
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,166
Carla? Would you be
my friend again?

133
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,583
Of course I would.

134
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,625
I can't believe it.

135
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,166
Neither can I.

136
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,708
Our adventure isn't
over after all.

137
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,250
[CARLA]
No. It's just begun.

138
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,208
[WENDY, CARLA cry]

139
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,625
[WENDY] We owe you our
lives. We won't forget.

140
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,000
Yeah. Listen.

141
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,000
If anyone deserves a break
it's you two, but...

142
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,000
[DORANBOLT]
This fight. It's not over yet.

143
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,375
[BOTH gasp]

144
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:27,041
[HAPPY] There's gotta be some
way to get this off'a me, right?

145
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,166
[PANTHERLILY]
I wouldn't mess with it.

146
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,166
Thing might spread its spores.

147
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,041
Your entire body could end
up covered in mushrooms.

148
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,333
That's a nice image.

149
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,583
[FRANMALTH] I'm confident
in my king, of course,

150
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,916
but I'm confused
by what he said.

151
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,083
Our plans remain unchanged. The
Face's activation is imminent.

152
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,958
[FRANMALTH]
I thought we were wrong

153
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,708
about where Face would appear.
But what if we weren't?

154
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:53,250
What if the Face we charted
just hadn't appeared yet?

155
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,083
[WENDY whimpers]

156
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,375
[WENDY]
No.

157
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,500
[FRANMALTH] They stopped one
Face. But only one of 'em!

158
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:23,125
How many are there?

159
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,375
There's no official count
on the number, but...

160
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,166
thousands, at least.

161
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,208
[MARD GEER]
There it is.

162
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,083
[MARD GEER] The engine
of humanity's demise.

163
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:41,625
Appeared at last,
in all its glory.

164
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,041
We fought so hard.

165
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:16,458
Nearly gave our lives to destroy
just one of these things.

166
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,791
But thousands remain.

167
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,166
We've lost. It's ov--

168
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,208
Don't say it, Carla.

169
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,875
[WENDY] 
I'm tired of despair.

170
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:34,333
[WENDY] I'm done with it.
It doesn't help anything.

171
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,208
Wendy. Your hair.

172
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:45,708
I'm through shedding tears. I've
cried enough for one lifetime.

173
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:49,666
Our comrades are determined.
They're fighting.

174
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,583
I'll fight with them.

175
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,250
[BOTH growling]

176
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,916
What has happened
to you, Minerva?

177
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,625
I am now called Neo-Minerva.

178
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:21,541
For as you can see,
I have been reborn.

179
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,000
As the ultimate wizard!

180
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,250
[MINERVA (NEO)]
Territory!

181
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,458
[ERZA screams]

182
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:47,125
Was that as good for you as
it was for me? Sweet Erza--

183
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,750
--[ERZA yells]

00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,875
[MINERVA (NEO) yells]

186
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,166
[MINERVA (NEO)] I gave
everything for strength.

187
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,083
Including my feeble humanity!

188
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,416
Then explain to me...

189
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,541
Just what it is
you're fighting for!

190
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,250
[groaning]

191
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,500
[JIEMMA]
You're a disgrace.

192
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,208
[MINERVA (NEO) gasps]

193
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,000
[MINERVA crying]

194
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,916
[JIEMMA]
You're of my blood.

195
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,166
So tell me why it is
that you're so weak!

196
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,166
[MINERVA (NEO) gasping]

197
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,416
[MINERVA]
I'm sorry, I don't know.

198
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,750
Please forgive me,
Father! I'm so sorry!

199
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,666
[JIEMMA] If you cared
to learn this lesson,

200
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,833
you'd know better than to beg.

201
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:44,916
[MINERVA yelps] I wasn't
thinking! Please don't be angry.

202
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,750
Do you continue pleading to defy
me or are you simply stupid?

203
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,208
You whimper like a victim...

204
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,833
Sabertooth has no
use for victims.

205
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:58,125
Sabertooth has no
place for the weak.

206
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,333
[MINERVA (NEO) yells]

207

[cries]

208
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,583
[JIEMMA] Our guild demands
but one thing. Strength.

209
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:17,500
We cull the weak. And I
do not allow exceptions.

210
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:21,875
Prove your strength to earn your
place or get out of my sight.

211
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,291
I am not weak!

212
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:29,083
[JIEMMA] You reveal your
weakness in every way.

213
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,958
Stop waiting to get
hit, and attack!

214
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:36,541
Do not relent. Do not defend.
Victims need defending.

215
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,083
Tigers need the hunt.

216
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,458
[MINERVA groaning]

217
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,750
[JIEMMA]
Stop acting hurt.

218
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,250
[MINERVA]
Uh...

219
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,791
Get on your feet right now
before I break your legs myself.

220
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,000
[JIEMMA]
Fingers! Continue!

221
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,416
[FINGERS]
Right!

222
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,750
[FINGERS] You'll have
to do more than jump!

223
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:05,791
[MINERVA gasps]

224
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:13,708
Absolute domain magic...
She used Territory...

225
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,541
[FINGERS yells]

226
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:17,875
[FINGERS gasps]

227
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:25,583
[MINERVA]
Uh...

228
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,125
[MINERVA]
Are you okay?

229
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:33,666
[JIEMMA] Not for long
he isn't. Finish him!

230
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,541
[MINERVA]
Uh?!

231
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,666
Only the weak can be defeated.

232
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,083
And the weak are
like insects to us.

233
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,250
Lowly creatures not worthy
of your time or sympathy.

234
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,583
He's worth the heel of
your boot and no more.

235
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,708
But why? Fingers is a
friend ours, isnt he?

236
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,666
[JIEMMA] "Friend" is a word
made for and by the weak.

237
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:56,541
My daughter has no need for
such words. Try these instead.

238
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,333
We aim to stun the heavens,

239
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,875
to rouse the land beneath us
and silence the raging seas.

240
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,541
For you see that is
the Sabertooth way.

241
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,041
[MINERVA]
But do we have to be so--

242
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,666
[JIEMMA] If you can't relieve
him of his shame, I will.

243
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,833
Be gone.

244
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:11,958
[MINERVA]
Uh!

245
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:21,791
Wha... What'd he
do wrong? [cries]

246
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,916
Stop crying.

247
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,250
[JIEMMA]
Cease your crying this instant!

248
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,458
There is nothing weaker
you can do than shed tears!

249
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,625
How many times must
I tell you this?

250
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:42,291
Please forgive me.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

251
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:47,041
[MINERVA (NEO)] I can't be weak.
I have to be stronger than you!

252
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,458
[ERZA]
That will never happen!

253
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:56,166
The years I've spent teaching
you have been wasted.

254
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,500
But a place may do
what I could not.

255
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,333
These woods are filled
with vicious beasts.

256
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,500
Either they will strip
you of your tears,

257
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,500
your heart, and your weakness.

258
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,875
Or they will strip
you of your life.

259
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:13,333
Once your tears have dried
for good, you may return.

260
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,541
[MINERVA] 
I'm sorry Father.

261
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,791
Forgive me, I'll
do better. I will.

262
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,875
[JIEMMA] You're no daughter of
mine. You're weak!

263
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:37,083
I cull the weak! I should crush
you like the insect you are!

264
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,250
[gasps]

265
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,541
[MONSTERS roar]

266
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,208
[MINERVA]
We aim to stun the heavens.

267
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:02,583
To rouse the land beneath us.
And to silence the raging seas.

268
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,208
For you see.

269
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:08,708
For you see. That is
the Sabertooth way.

270
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,708
Get it together!

271
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,250
[ERZA] Back at the
Grand Magic Games,

272
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,583
you crossed a lot of lines.

273
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,791
I can't forgive you for
hurting my friends,

274
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,208
but I can understand.

275
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:28,083
You wanted to do what's
best for your guild.

276
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:46,000
Minerva. My fists weep for you.
They protest every blow.

277
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:50,208
They're asking for a reason
as to why we have to fight.

278
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,333
[MINERVA (NEO)]
There isn't one.

279
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:01,333
And I'm out of fight.

280
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,166
I have a request.

281
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,333
Please free me from my shame
and show me to my death.

282
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,625
[MINERVA (NEO)]
I've always been weak.

283
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:21,416
And weakness is 
easily corrupted.

284
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,916
Just look at what
I've done to myself.

285
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,041
I beg you...

286
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,791
[ERZA]
Horns or no, you're human.

287
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:37,000
Someone is out there waiting
for you to come home.

288
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,125
I m sure of it.

289
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,958
[MARD GEER] This is why
I so despise your kind.

290
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,458
It's bad enough that you go
through birth and death and rot.

291
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,625
Do you have to speak of it, too?

292
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,750
It's repugnant.

293
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,708
Do I know you?

294
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,958
[ERZA] Wait, I've heard
that voice before.

295
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:06,875
[ERZA gasps]
The Underworld King, Mard Geer!

296
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,416
[MARD GEER]
What a bother.

297
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,166
The Celestial Spirit King's
got all that refuse

298
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,041
we had swept away
popping back up

299
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:16,583
through the woodwork.
Curse that meddlesome boor.

300
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:19,750
Luckily, I have a bit
of time to spare.

301
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:23,750
More than enough to clear
you away once and for all.

302
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,791
So you're behind all this.

303
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,750
[ERZA screams]

304
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,083
What kind of curse 
does he wield?

305
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,125
[MARD GEER]
I'll start right here.

306
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
Minerva!

307
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:45,166
[MINERVA (NEO)] 
Erza. Run.

308
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,500
[ROGUE]
We're just in time.

309
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:00,375
[ERZA gasps]

310
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,125
[STING]
Or fashionably late.

311
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,416
We came to bring
ya home. M'lady!

312
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,041
I'm really diggin' those horns!

313
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:12,208
You belong with us,
back at Sabertooth.

314
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:15,000
And please never
leave us again!

315
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,375
[MARD GEER]
Well...

316
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:19,208
[STING] Now that is one
mean-lookin' fella'.

317
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,958
Guess he must be our
enemy. Right, Erza?

318
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:25,958
His energy. It's like nothing
I've sensed before.

319
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,333
C'mon, ladies.

320
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,208
The twin dragons've got this
clown; you need a break.

321
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,625
We packed an extra lunch.

322
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,750
Uh...

323
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,458
[ERZA] Someone is out there
waiting for you to come home.

324
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,458
I'm sure of it.

325
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,666
[LUCY] Thousands of face bombs
are set to detonate in an hour.

326
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,791
Newly arrived at the scene of
this unprecedented crisis,

327
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,083
Sabertooth's Twin
Dragons now challenge

328
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,708
the Underworld King with
anger in their fists.

329
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:27,666
Gray and Silver's fight begins
with Silver flinging words

330
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,291
as well as curses.

331
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:33,375
Words of revelation. The kind
that tear your heart out.

332
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:37,666
Next Time: "Tartaros Chapter
The Boy's Tale"

333
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,833
A woeful truth shines
light on despair.
