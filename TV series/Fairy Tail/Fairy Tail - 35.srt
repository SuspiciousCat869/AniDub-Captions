1
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,875
- HEY GUYS, READY FOR
SOME MORE FAIRY TAIL?

2
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:21,791
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING

3
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,291
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS
ON IN THE ROOM,

4
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:26,125
AND DON'T SIT TOO CLOSE
TO THE TV.

5
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:31,333
- DON'T WORRY LITTLE BUDDY,
I'M COMING FOR YOU. HAPPY.

6
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,666
- IF I STAY IN THIS CRAZY
CAT ROOM MUCH LONGER,

7
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,000
I'M GOING TO GO INSANE.

8
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:41,250
I GOT TO GET OUT
OF HERE RIGHT NOW.

9
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,333
- Toy cat: PRETTY KITTY,
PRETTY KITTY, PRETTY KITTY.

10
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,791
- HEY, I KNOW THEY PUT
YOU HERE TO DISTRACT ME,

11
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,458
BUT I DON'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

12
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:27,500
- MEOW. MEOW. MEOW.

13
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:30,166
- WELL, MAYBE JUST
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

14
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,833
- Happy: VOICE OF DARKNESS!

15
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:40,250
- SO WE TOOK A STAND
FOR OUR FREEDOM.

16
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:43,250
WE HOPED TO SAVE
OUR DEAR FRIEND, JELLAL.

17
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,333
- DON'T GO MESSING
WITH MAD DOG WALLY.

18
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:52,708
- ALL OF THAT MANUAL LABOR
HAS MADE US STRONGER.

19
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,541
- YOU BRATS.

20
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,875
( moans in pain )

21
00:02:56,958 --> 00:03:00,000
- ( clamoring )

22
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,291
- Budi: THIS KID'S NO FUN.

23
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,583
HE HASN'T MADE A PEEP
THIS WHOLE TIME.

24
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:08,916
- DROP THE TOUGH-GUY ACT

25
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,333
OR WE'LL GO TO MORE
EXTREME MEASURES

26
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,500
LIKE WE DID WITH
YOUR LITTLE GIRLFRIEND.

27
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,166
- YOU JUST DON'T GET IT. YOU AND
YOUR BUDDIES DON'T REALIZE

28
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,416
HOW LUCKY YOU ARE TO BE
BUILDING THE R-SYSTEM, DO YOU?

29
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,041
- IT'S A SPECIAL HONOR AND ONCE
THE TOWER'S BEEN COMPLETED

30
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,541
EVERYONE WHO WORKED
ON IT GOES TO HEAVEN.

31
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:27,083
- WE'RE GOING TO USE THE
R-SYSTEM TO RESURRECT OUR GOD.

32
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,875
- SHUT UP, YOU FAT PIG.
- WHAT'D YOU JUST CALL ME?

33
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,041
- FORGET HIM.
WE'RE WASTING TIME HERE.

34
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,750
WE HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE RIOTERS.

35
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,333
- REST UP KID, 'CAUSE WE'RE
GOING TO KEEP ZAPPING YOU

36
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,208
UNTIL YOU START BEGGING
OUR GOD FOR MERCY!

37
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,000
- ( both laugh )

38
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,125
- GOD. I DON'T BELIEVE
THERE IS SUCH A THING.

39
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:52,000
IF THERE WAS THEN WE WOULDN'T
HAVE TO SUFFER LIKE THIS.

40
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,916
I HATE IT.

41
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,291
- IS THAT SO?

42
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:04,291
- ALL OF IT. I HATE
THEM AND THEIR GOD.

43
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,500
EVERYTHING ABOUT
THIS LOUSY WORLD.

44
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,041
- EMBRACE YOUR
FEELINGS OF MALICE

45
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,875
AND SHARE THEM WITH ME.

46
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:17,041
I THRIVE ON DARK EMOTIONS,
THEY MAKE ME STRONGER.

47
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,000
- WHO ARE YOU?

48
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,375
- WHAT AMUSING CREATURES.

49
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,375
I'M RIGHT HERE
WITHIN THEIR TOWER,

50
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,416
SO VERY CLOSE TO THEM,

51
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,791
YET THEY'VE GONE TO ALL THIS
TROUBLE TO RESURRECT ME.

52
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,083
JUST TO MAKE ME
FLESH AND BONE.

53
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,458
- SHOW YOURSELF.

54
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,000
- THEY MAY HAVE ALL
THE FAITH IN THE WORLD

55
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:38,250
BUT IT'S YOUR HATRED THAT ALLOWS
YOU TO SENSE MY PRESENCE.

56
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:44,458
- JELLAL, YOU ARE
A FORTUNATE CHILD

57
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:47,541
FOR YOU HAVE MET THE
GOD THEY SO REVERE.

58
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,166
( laughs )

59
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,125
MY NAME IS ZEREF

60
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:56,625
AND HATRED IS MY
VERY EXISTENCE.

61
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,333
- Erza: WE HAVE TO FREE
EVERYONE IN SECTOR 8 TODAY.

62
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,583
COME ON, WE CAN DO IT.

63
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,208
- Simon: NO WE CAN'T.
WE COULD NEVER TAKE DOWN

64
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,875
ALL THOSE GUARDS. 
- WE HAVE TO.

65
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,791
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE'LL
BE ABLE TO SAVE JELLAL.

66
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,916
- I GUESS SHE'S INTO HIM.
SORRY, OLD BUDDY.

67
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,333
- ERZA, UM, DO YOU...

68
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,416
YOU DON'T HAVE A CRUSH
ON JELLAL, DO YOU?

69
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,458
- WHAT? WHY WOULD YOU ASK ME
SOMETHING LIKE THAT RIGHT NOW?

70
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,291
WE NEED TO FOCUS.

71
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:27,000
- SORRY. BUT I JUST WANTED
TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE...

72
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:33,333
- WHERE'D THAT COME FROM?
- LOOK, UP THERE.

73
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:37,000
- MAGIC SOLDIERS.
- SIMON.

74
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,041
- HE'S HURT. WHAT WILL WE DO?

75
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:42,375
- ( growls )

76
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,916
- ( people screaming )

77
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,208
- NO, YOU CAN'T GIVE UP
LIKE THIS.

78
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,250
WE HAVE TO FIGHT
TO BE FREE.

79
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,458
- OUT OF THE WAY.

80
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,958
- PLEASE COME BACK.
WE NEED YOUR HELP.

81
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,583
WE HAVE TO SAVE JELLAL.

82
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,000
- WATCH OUT.
- ERZA.

83
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,625
- GRANDPA ROB.

84
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,166
- MY MAGIC MAY NOT BE
AS STRONG AS IT ONCE WAS

85
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,291
BUT IT'S STILL ENOUGH
TO PROTECT MY FRIENDS.

86
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:32,458
I WILL NOT LET YOU TAKE
THE LIFE OF AN INNOCENT.

87
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,500
- WHOA, DID YOU SEE THAT?
- YEAH.

88
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,375
- HE REFLECTED THEIR MAGIC BACK.

89
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,458
- ( Grandpa Rob groaning )

90
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,791
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

91
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,958
- YES. I MAY BE
A DECREPIT, OLD MAN,

92
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,958
BUT DEEP DOWN I'VE STILL
GOT SOME FIGHT LEFT IN ME.

93
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,791
AS A WIZARD, MY MAGIC
HAS ALWAYS BEEN INTERTWINED

94
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,625
WITH THE VERY
ESSENCE OF MY LIFE.

95
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,791
BUT I DIDN'T REALIZE
HOW MUCH SO UNTIL

96
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:07,875
I LOST IT AND SOON FOUND
MYSELF IN THIS SORRY STATE.

97
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:11,833
DON'T END UP LIKE ME, ERZA.
YOU HAVE SO MUCH POTENTIAL,

98
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,541
DON'T LET IT GO TO WASTE.

99
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,750
- GRANDPA.

100
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,625
- YOU'LL FIND IT DEEP
WITHIN YOUR HEART.

101
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,083
- IN MY HEART?

102
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,791
- YES MA'AM. THE ONLY WAY
YOU CAN BELIEVE IN SOMETHING

103
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,750
IS IF YOU FEEL IT IN YOUR HEART.

104
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,250
THINK ABOUT THIS,
MAGIC IN IT'S TRUEST FORM

105
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,375
IS VERY SIMILAR
TO RELIGIOUS FAITH,

106
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,625
FORTUNE-TELLING, HEALING
AND EVEN PRAYER.

107
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,375
YOU SEE, ALL OF THESE THINGS
WORK MIRACLES THAT CAN ONLY

108
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,833
BE EXPERIENCED BY BELIEVERS.

109
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,000
- SO, I JUST HAVE TO BELIEVE?

110
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,958
- THAT'S RIGHT. AS LONG
AS YOU BELIEVE IN IT'S POWER,

111
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,416
HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF

112
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,625
AND STRIVE TO LIVE IN
HARMONY WITH NATURE,

113
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,791
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO USE MAGIC.

114
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,916
THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES
TO BECOME A WIZARD.

115
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,208
DOESN'T SEEM SO HARD,
NOW DOES IT?

116
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:56,541
- I WANT TO USE MAGIC.
IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF FUN.

117
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:59,125
GRANDPA, IF I BECOME A WIZARD,

118
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:02,458
DOES THAT MEAN I'LL BE ABLE TO
FLY THROUGH THE SKY ON A BROOM?

119
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,625
- I CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT,

120
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:08,916
BUT YOU WILL GAIN MAGICAL
POWERS OF SOME SORT.

121
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,875
- I PROMISE I'LL GIVE YOU
A RIDE ON MY BROOM SOMEDAY.

122
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,750
- YOUR BEAUTIFUL SMILE IS THE
ONLY THING THAT'S KEPT ME GOING

123
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,208
WHILE I'VE BEEN STUCK
IN THIS WRETCHED PLACE.

124
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,875
- YOU'RE HURT, AREN'T YOU?

125
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:26,166
- REMEMBER THIS, YOUR FREEDOM
LIES WITHIN YOUR HEART, CHILD.

126
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,416
- Urtear: THERE'S NO
FREEDOM IN THIS WORLD.

127
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,458
- FOLLOW YOUR HEART AND
YOUR DREAM OF BECOMING

128
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,375
A WIZARD WILL COME TRUE.

129
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:37,416
- Urtear: I WILL MAKE
YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE.

130
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,041
- GRANDPA, NO.

131
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:47,041
- Urtear: TRUE FREEDOM
LIES WITH ME.

132
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,750
- ERZA, WE GOT
TO RETREAT. HURRY UP.

133
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,666
- Sho: SISTER, COME ON.
- Millianna: ERZY.

134
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,500
- ( sobs )

135
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:03,291
( screams )

136
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,833
- ( screams )

137
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,625
- Man: WHOA.
- Man 2: HOW'D SHE DO THAT?

138
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,458
- Man 3: SHE DEFEATED
ALL OF THEM.

139
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:24,250
- OH, WOW. SHE USED MAGIC.

140
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:27,333
- YOU KNEW ALL ALONG, GRANDPA.

141
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,458
YOU KNEW I HAD THIS POWER.

142
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,833
NOW THAT I'VE FOUND IT
I CAN USE IT TO SAVE JELLAL.

143
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:37,625
I'M AFRAID LEARNING HOW
TO FLY A BROOM HAVE TO WAIT.

144
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,458
THIS IS OUR CHANCE.

145
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:44,041
WE HAVE TO FIGHT
FOR OUR FREEDOM.

146
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,250
FOLLOW ME.

147
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,333
- ( people cheering )

148
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,083
- THEY'RE REVOLTING.
WHAT'RE WE GOING TO DO?

149
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,166
- RUN FOR IT.

150
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,041
- LET'S NOT DO ANYTHING HASTY.

151
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:59,125
- IT'S NOT OUR FAULT. WE
WERE JUST FOLLOWING ORDERS.

152
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,916
- OUT OF MY WAY.

153
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:08,416
I'M HERE TO SAVE YOU.

154
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,375
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.

155
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,583
WE FOUGHT THEM JUST
LIKE YOU SAID WE SHOULD.

156
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,625
EVERYONE WAS SO BRAVE.
SIMON ENDED UP GETTING

157
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,500
HIMSELF HURT PRETTY BAD

158
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,875
AND GRANDPA ROB SAVED MY LIFE,
BUT HE DIDN'T MAKE IT.

159
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:27,125
BUT WE BEAT THEM. WE FOUGHT FOR
OUR FREEDOM AND WE WON.

160
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,541
COME ON, WE GOT TO MEET
WALLY AND THE OTHERS.

161
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,041
THEY FOUND SOME BOATS
SO WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE

162
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,166
THIS PLACE FOR GOOD.

163
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,708
- ERZA.

164
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:39,125
THERE'S NO REASON
FOR YOU TO LEAVE THE TOWER.

165
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,833
BECAUSE TRUE FREEDOM
IS RIGHT HERE WITH ME.

166
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,833
- OH, WOW, I FOUND
A MOVIE LACRIMA.

167
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,750
- UH, WHAT IS THAT?

168
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,041
- IT'S A LACRIMA WITH
A MOVIE IN IT, SILLY.

169
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,583
- OH, WHAT'S A MOVIE?

170
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,250
- YOU KNOW, MOVING PICTURES.

171
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,416
IT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE WATCH THAT
SHOWS ACTORS ACTING OUT A STORY.

172
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,625
TO BE HONEST, I'VE NEVER
SEEN ONE MYSELF.

173
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,250
- ( screaming )

174
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,916
- IT'S TOO BAD THINGS HAD
TO END THIS WAY, TONY JOE.

175
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,708
BUT FROM THE FIRST
MOMENT YOU MET ME,

176
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,125
YOUR FUTURE WAS SEALED.

177
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,625
- HE'S SO COOL.

178
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,416
- DON'T YOU THINK
HE'S KIND OF EDGY?

179
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,125
- 'CAUSE BEING EDGY IS DANDY.

180
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,833
- Millianna: THAT DOESN'T
EVEN MAKE ANY SENSE.

181
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,708
- SISTER, WHERE ARE YOU?

182
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,125
- BUT I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO GET OUT OF HERE, TOO.

183
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,625
THIS IS OUR CHANCE AT FREEDOM.

184
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:30,500
- DON'T YOU SEE? THERE'S NO
FREEDOM IN THIS WORLD.

185
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,750
THOSE FOOLS WHO BUILT
THIS TOWER MAY NOT HOLD

186
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,583
YOU PRISONER ANYMORE,

187
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,958
BUT YOU HAVEN'T
EXPERIENCED TRUE FREEDOM.

188
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:41,458
BECAUSE THAT CAN
ONLY BE FOUND

189
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,916
IN ZEREF'S WORLD.

190
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,708
- NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY MADE
US WORK SO HARD ON THIS TOWER.

191
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,875
THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN USE
IT TO RESURRECT ZEREF.

192
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,208
YOU CLAIM TO BE SUCH
DEVOUT FOLLOWERS

193
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:03,041
BUT YOU COULDN'T EVEN SENSE
YOUR GOD'S PRESENCE HERE,

194
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,250
COULD YOU?

195
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,833
- THIS TOWER
BELONGS TO ME NOW.

196
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,208
I WILL FINISH
IT'S CONSTRUCTION

197
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,833
AND BRING ZEREF
BACK TO LIFE.

198
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:17,875
- THAT'S MAGIC.

199
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,375
- SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP,

200
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,708
- STOP IT. YOU'RE HURTING
HIM, JELLAL.

201
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,583
- SO WHAT?

202
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,666
WHY DO YOU CARE?
I THOUGHT YOU HATED THEM.

203
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,625
- YOU'RE RIGHT, I DO,
BUT YOU'RE BEING CRUEL.

204
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,333
- IF YOU WANT TO SENSE
ZEREF'S PRESENCE,

205
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,916
YOU HAVE TO FOCUS
ON YOUR HATRED.

206
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,833
- NO.

207
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,583
- ( laughs )

208
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,000
- YOU KILLED HIM.
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?

209
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,291
- I HAVEN'T CHANGED ONE BIT.

210
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,125
I'M RENAMING THIS PLACE
THE TOWER OF HEAVEN.

211
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,208
ERZA, YOU AND I WILL STAY
HERE AND FINISH IT TOGETHER.

212
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,458
- WHAT?

213
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,625
- ONCE IT'S COMPLETED,
WE'LL RESURRECT ZEREF.

214
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,250
- WHY WOULD ANYBODY
WANT TO STAY HERE

215
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,791
WHEN WE FINALLY
HAVE A CHANCE TO LEAVE?

216
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,666
- (laughs ) FINE, IF YOU WANT
TO LEAVE SO BADLY

217
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,541
THEN I'M NOT GOING
TO STOP YOU.

218
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,166
BUT YOU'LL HAVE
TO GO ALONE.

219
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,250
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

220
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,416
- THERE'S NO WAY I COULD FINISH

221
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,875
THE TOWER'S
CONSTRUCTION BY MYSELF

222
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,541
SO I'M GOING TO KEEP
THE OTHERS HERE WITH ME.

223
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:23,416
BUT DON'T WORRY, I PROMISE
I WON'T MISTREAT THEM.

224
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,375
I'LL MAKE SURE EVERYONE'S
FED AND CLOTHED

225
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,916
AND THEY GET PLENTY OF REST
BETWEEN THEIR SHIFTS.

226
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,333
I'M SURE ZEREF WOULD
PREFER I BUILD MORE HATRED

227
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,250
BY RULING WITH AN IRON FIST.

228
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,416
BUT WEAK AND UNHAPPY PEOPLE
DON'T MAKE VERY GOOD WORKERS.

229
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,541
- THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO AGREE TO THAT.

230
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,208
EVERYBODY'S ON
THE BOATS READY TO GO.

231
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,375
THEY'RE JUST WAITING
FOR US TO JOIN THEM.

232
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,375
THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD
CONVINCE THEM TO STAY HERE

233
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,166
AND WORK FOR YOU NOW.

234
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,500
- OH, I DON'T THINK I'LL HAVE
ANY PROBLEM CONVINCING THEM

235
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,916
BECAUSE I'M GOING
TO GIVE THEM A PURPOSE.

236
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,416
ONCE THEY LEARN
OF ZEREF'S POWER,

237
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,916
THEY'LL HAPPILY WORK
TO RESURRECT HIM.

238
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,666
- BUT NONE OF THEM WOULD
WILLINGLY BECOME A SACRIFICE

239
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,958
- IT DOESN'T MATTER. ZEREF TOLD
ME SACRIFICES AREN'T NECESSARY.

240
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,333
HE'S SUCH A BENEVOLENT
GOD, ISN'T HE?

241
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:08,541
- PLEASE JELLAL, YOU GOT TO TRY
TO COME TO YOUR SENSES.

242
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,125
- I COULD ASK THE SAME OF YOU.

243
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,083
I DON'T NEED YOU ANYMORE,

244
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,708
BUT SINCE YOU TOOK CARE OF
THE FOOLS WHO WERE IN MY WAY,

245
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,625
I'LL LET YOU LIVE.

246
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,000
ENJOY YOUR NEW FOUND FREEDOM.

247
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,583
BUT, I HAVE SOME RULES
FOR YOU BEFORE YOU GO.

248
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:23,875
- I CAN'T BREATHE.

249
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:27,208
- I DEMAND YOU NEVER
TELL ANYONE OF THIS PLACE.

250
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,500
IF THE GOVERNMENT FOUND OUT
ABOUT THE TOWER OF HEAVEN,

251
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,333
I'D BE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.

252
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:34,333
IF WORD WERE TO GET OUT,
THEN I'D HAVE NO CHOICE

253
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,041
BUT TO DESTROY THE TOWER
AND EVERYONE INSIDE IT.

254
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,625
YOU'RE FORBIDDEN FROM
EVER RETURNING HERE AGAIN.

255
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:43,625
SET ONE FOOT ON THIS LAND
AND I'LL KILL YOUR FRIENDS.

256
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,333
I FIGURE SHO WOULD
HAVE TO BE THE FIRST TO GO.

257
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:49,500
- NO. YOU WOULDN'T.

258
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,583
- ONE FALSE MOVE
AND YOUR FRIENDS WILL DIE.

259
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:54,041
I'LL ENJOY TRUE FREEDOM
WHILE YOU SUFFER,

260
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,208
BURDENED BY YOUR GUILT.

261
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,791
( laughs )

262
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,375
- ( sobbing )

263
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:21,708
NO. NO.

264
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,125
I HAVE TO FIGHT JELLAL.

265
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:36,458
I HAVE NO CHOICE.
I HAVE TO DO IT.

266
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,875
- Siegrain: THE TIME
FOR ACTION IS NOW.

267
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,916
WE MUST USE THE
SATELLITE SQUARE

268
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,291
TO FIRE AN ETHERION BLAST
DIRECTLY AT THE TOWER.

269
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,750
- THE R-SYSTEM IS FORBIDDEN
MAGIC WE CANNOT ALLOW

270
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,875
TO BECOME PART OF
OUR RECORDED HISTORY.

271
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,750
THEREFORE, IT HAS
TO BE DESTROYED.

272
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,500
WHY CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?

273
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,208
- ETHERION WOULD OBLITERATE
EVERYTHING IN IT'S PATH,

274
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,958
INCLUDING ANY INNOCENT
CIVILIANS WITHIN THE TOWER.

275
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,458
- NOT TO MENTION, YOUR OWN
BROTHER'S LIFE IS AT STAKE.

276
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,083
IF YOU FIRE THE ETHERION,
HE'S SURE TO DIE.

277
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,958
WOULD YOU BE ABLE
TO LIVE WITH THAT GUILT?

278
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,083
- IF IT'S FOR THE GREATER GOOD.

279
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,875
- ALTHOUGH LIVES OF INNOCENT
CIVILIANS WILL BE LOST,

280
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,250
WE MUST STOP HIM.

281
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,625
IT'S A SACRIFICE THAT
MUST BE MADE NOW.

282
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,958
- HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT?

283
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,208
CAN YOU IMAGINE
HOW WE'D BE VILIFIED

284
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,291
IF WE ATTACKED KAH ELM
WITHOUT WARNING?

285
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,458
WE'D GO DOWN IN HISTORY
AS MASS MURDERERS.

286
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,666
- I WILL SACRIFICE MY
REPUTATION IN ORDER

287
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,375
TO SAVE COUNTLESS LIVES.

288
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:28,916
- YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS?

289
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,208
- THINK OF HOW THE R-SYSTEM
WILL AFFECT FUTURE GENERATIONS.

290
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,458
HOW CAN WE TEACH OUR
CHILDREN THE VALUE OF LIFE

291
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,250
IF THE DEAD CAN BE RESURRECTED?

292
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,625
- Belno: WE HAVE TO PUT
AN END TO THIS.

293
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,541
I WOULD LIKE TO VOTE IN
FAVOR OF AN ETHERION ATTACK.

294
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,875
- WE NEED ONE MORE.

295
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:47,958
- JUST A SINGLE VOTE.
THAT'S ALL IT WILL TAKE

296
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:51,375
AND THEN IT'S GAME OVER.

297
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,291
( laughs )

298
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,375
- MAN, OH, MAN,
WE PLAYED SO MUCH

299
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,166
THAT I'M COMPLETELY
WORN OUT NOW.

300
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,458
- SO, WHERE THE HECK
ARE WE, ANYWAY?

301
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,666
- I DON'T KNOW
MAYBE IT'S JUST ME

302
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,500
BUT FOR SOME REASON THE
NAME ZEREF SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

303
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:11,708
- I'M SURE. HE WAS
A LEGENDARY BLACK WIZARD.

304
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,916
- Lucy: WAIT A MINUTE.
I REMEMBER SOMEONE SAYING

305
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,666
THE MONSTER THAT CAME OUT
OF THE LULLABY FLUTE

306
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,250
WAS ONE OF ZEREF'S DEMONS.

307
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:20,208
- Erza: I NEVER MENTIONED IT,
BUT I SUSPECT DELIORA

308
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:23,291
WAS A DEMON FROM
THE BOOK OF ZEREF AS WELL.

309
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,666
- IF THIS WIZARD
IS AS EVIL AS YOU SAY,

310
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,000
THEN WHY WOULD JELLAL
WANT TO RESURRECT HIM?

311
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,041
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HIS MOTIVES EITHER.

312
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,750
HOWEVER, MY OLD FRIEND
SHO SAID SOMETHING TO ME

313
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,375
ABOUT ZEREF GETTING
THEM TO HEAVEN

314
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,291
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS
THE WORLD WILL BE REBORN

315
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,958
AND THEY'LL BECOME IT'S RULERS.

316
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,916
- OKAY, THERE'S ONE THING THAT
CONFUSES ME ABOUT THESE PEOPLE

317
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,166
WHO CLAIM TO BE
OLD FRIENDS OF YOURS.

318
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,125
WHY'RE THEY ACCUSING
YOU OF BETRAYING THEM?

319
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,375
DON'T THEY REALIZE
JELLAL'S THE BAD GUY HERE?

320
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,000
- IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT.
I'M SURE HE FED THEM

321
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:53,291
ALL SORTS OF LIES
ABOUT ME ONCE I LEFT.

322
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:56,000
THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT
THAT I ABANDONED THEM

323
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,375
SO LONG AGO.

324
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,000
IN THE END, I GUESS YOU
COULD SAY I DID BETRAY THEM.

325
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,541
- BECAUSE HE THREATENED TO KILL
THEM, IF YOU EVER CAME BACK.

326
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,750
YOU COULDN'T HAVE SAVED THEM...

327
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:07,041
- NONE OF THAT MATTERS ANYMORE.

328
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,416
IF I CAN DEFEAT JELLAL,
IT'LL ALL BE OVER.

329
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,208
LEAVE IT TO ME, OKAY?

330
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:14,416
- WHY DO I GET THE FEELING
SHE'S HIDING SOMETHING?

331
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,791
- BUT YOU CAN'T HELP ME NOW, THE
ODDS ARE STACKED AGAINST ME.

332
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:22,041
WIN OR LOSE THIS BATTLE,
I'M STARING DEATH IN THE FACE.

333
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:25,208
- WHY WOULD SHE SAY THAT?
WHAT DOES IT EVEN MEAN?

334
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,416
- SISTER, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

335
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,000
WHY? WHY ARE YOU LYING TO THEM?

336
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,208
- SHO.

337
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,791
- YOU THINK BY MAKING
YOURSELF THE MARTYR,

338
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,666
YOU'RE GOING TO GET
SYMPATHY FROM YOUR FRIENDS?

339
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,666
TELL THEM THE TRUTH. THAT'S NOT
HOW IT HAPPENED AND YOU KNOW IT.

340
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,750
YOU BLEW UP THE BOATS WE WERE
GOING TO USE TO ESCAPE,

341
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,250
AND THEN YOU LEFT ON YOUR OWN.

342
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,791
WE WOULD HAVE ENDED UP
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA

343
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,250
IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR
JELLAL. HE SAVED US.

344
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,708
HE WARNED US NOT TO
TRUST WIZARDS LIKE YOU

345
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:55,000
WHO HAVEN'T LEARNED
TO USE THEIR MAGIC PROPERLY.

346
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,833
HE SAID THAT YOU HAD BECOME
DRUNK WITH MAGICAL POWER

347
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,166
AND YOU DIDN'T WANT
ANYTHING TO DO

348
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,708
WITH YOUR PAST OR THE
PEOPLE YOU LEFT BEHIND.

349
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,583
- DID YOU EVER THINK
HE MIGHT BE LYING?

350
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,375
- IF YOU TRULY KNEW
ERZA THEN YOU'D KNOW

351
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,958
SHE'D NEVER DO
SOMETHING SO HORRIBLE.

352
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,500
- Sho: YOU ONLY THINK
YOU KNOW HER.

353
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,666
YOU WEREN'T THERE BACK THEN, YOU
DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT US.

354
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,625
AFTER YOU LEFT, JELLAL'S WORDS
WERE MY ONLY SALVATION.

355
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,166
AND THAT'S WHY I'VE SPENT
ALL THESE YEARS WORKING

356
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:30,708
TO FINISH THE TOWER FOR HIM.
I DID IT FOR HIS SAKE.

357
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:34,916
NOW YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL
ME THAT IT WAS ALL A LIE?

358
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,666
YOU REALLY EXPECT
ME TO BELIEVE

359
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,916
YOU'RE TELLING THE TRUTH

360
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,083
AND JELLAL'S BEEN LYING
TO US THIS WHOLE TIME?

361
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,708
- Simon: THAT'S RIGHT.

362
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,416
- WHY, YOU...

363
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,291
- WAIT. HE DOESN'T POSE
A THREAT, MY DEAR.

364
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,916
HE NEVER MEANT
YOU ANY HARM.

365
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,833
AT THE RESORT, HE KNEW HE
WAS ATTACKING YOUR ICE DECOY.

366
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,250
- Gray: BUT HOW?

367
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,041
- SINCE IT WAS HE WHO CAST
THE DARKNESS SPELL,

368
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,208
IT HAD NO EFFECT ON HIM.

369
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,000
I CAME ALONG IN THE
HOPES OF DISCOVERING

370
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,125
WHY HE'D CHOSEN TO SPARE YOU.

371
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:06,208
- I'D EXPECT NO LESS FROM A
MEMBER OF PHANTOM'S ELEMENT 4.

372
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,208
- Sho: I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

373
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,583
- I HAD TO FOOL YOU
AND THE OTHERS

374
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,041
INTO THINKING I'D KILLED HIM

375
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,375
BUT I'D HOPED OUR ATTACK
WOULD LURE THEM HERE.

376
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:17,916
- SO YOU WERE LYING, TOO?
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO ME?

377
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,041
- I'M SORRY.

378
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,416
JELLAL HAD YOU UNDER
HIS SPELL

379
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,375
AND I COULDN'T
CONVINCE YOU OTHERWISE.

380
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,166
SO, I PLAYED ALONG UNTIL
THE TIME WAS RIGHT.

381
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,416
- SO YOU KNEW ALL ALONG.

382
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,250
- I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED
IN YOU, ERZA.

383
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,416
AND THERE'S NOTHING
THAT COULD CHANGE THAT.

384
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,125
I MEAN THOSE WORDS FROM
THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.

385
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,125
- SIMON.

386
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,916
- I NEVER KNEW.

387
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,458
I CAN'T BELIEVE I BLINDLY
FOLLOWED HIM ALL THESE YEARS.

388
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,541
I DOUBTED YOU.

389
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,291
'CAUSE YOU LEFT ME
ALL ALONE.

390
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,166
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH THAT HURT.

391
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,416
( grunts )

392
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,333
( sobbing )

393
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,416
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

394
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,958
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHICH ONE OF
YOU I SHOULD BELIEVE ANYMORE.

395
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:21,041
- I KNOW IT MUST BE DIFFICULT
TO TAKE ALL OF THIS IN AT ONCE.

396
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:25,166
BUT SHO, THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

397
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,333
THOUGH IT'S BEEN MANY YEARS,

398
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,833
I HAVE NEVER ONCE FORGOTTEN
ABOUT ANY OF YOU.

399
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,041
I'M SORRY I COULDN'T
STAND UP TO HIM,

400
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,708
BUT I WAS SO WEAK
BACK THEN.

401
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,833
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

402
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,250
- NOW YOU'RE STRONGER
AND READY TO FACE HIM.

403
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,208
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

404
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:48,000
I'VE WAITED ALL THESE
YEARS FOR THIS VERY MOMENT.

405
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,500
WHEN A GROUP OF POWERFUL
WIZARDS WOULD GATHER HERE.

406
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:53,291
- SO, WHAT DO
YOU HAVE PLANNED?

407
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,708
- Simon: WE'RE GOING
TO TAKE DOWN JELLAL.

408
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,541
WE CAN DO IT IF
WE WORK TOGETHER.

409
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,791
BUT FIRST, WE MUST
KEEP SALAMANDER

410
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,958
AND WALLY FROM CLASHING.

411
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,291
- GEEZ, WHAT'S UP
WITH THIS ROOM?

412
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:14,166
THERE'RE CATS
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

413
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,083
I LIKE THAT GIANT,
GREEN KITTY HEAD.

414
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,291
OH, WOW, IT'S SOME KIND OF MASK.

415
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,875
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO, HAPPY.
AYE, SIR.

416
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,375
I'D MAKE A GOOD CAT.

417
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,458
( laughs )

418
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,916
( grunting )

419
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,333
MAN, IT'S STUCK ON
MY GIANT NOGGIN.

420
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:35,500
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

421
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:38,833
Ah, WELL, IT LOOKS COOL
SO WHO CARES, RIGHT?

422
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,375
- AIN'T THAT DANDY.

423
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:43,958
- ( theme song )

424
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,625
- ALL RIGHT, IT LOOKS
LIKE I BEAT YOU AGAIN.

425
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:17,625
THAT MAKES IT NINE WINS
IN A ROW FOR ME.

426
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,666
- ONE MORE GAME. I'M TOTALLY
GOING TO WIPE THE FLOOR

427
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,708
WITH YOU THIS ROUND.

428
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:22,208
- GIVE ME A BREAK,

429
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:23,750
THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE BEEN SAYING
FOR THE LAST EIGHT GAMES.

430
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:25,416
I'M TIRED OF PLAYING
THE SAME OLD THING.

431
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,875
- THAT MEANS I WIN
BY DEFAULT. WOOHOO.

432
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:30,541
I JUST KICKED
YOUR FELINE BEHIND.

433
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:33,083
- Natsu and Happy:
NEXT TIME, HEAVEN'S GAME

434
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:34,750
- Happy: YOU CAN'T JUST
GO AND CHANGE THE RULES

435
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:36,333
WHENEVER YOU WANT, YOU CHEATER.

436
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:38,583
- Natsu: OH, YES I CAN.

437
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:41,791
- Happy: THAT'S IT.
HE'S COMPLETELY LOST IT.
