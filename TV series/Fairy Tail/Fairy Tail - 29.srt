1
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:20,125
- HEY, GUYS! READY FOR
SOME MORE FAIRY TAIL?

2
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:21,666
JUST MAKE SURE THAT WHEN
YOU'RE WATCHING

3
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,375
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS
ON IN THE ROOM,

4
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:25,833
AND DON'T SIT TOO
CLOSE TO THE TV!

5
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,708
- Lucy: PREVIOUSLY
ON FAIRY TAIL!

6
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:31,083
Happy: A WHILE BACK WE FOUND OUT

7
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,583
THAT LUCY IS
ACTUALLY THE DAUGHTER

8
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,458
OF THE WEALTHY
HEARTFILIA FAMILY.

9
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,250
TALK ABOUT A SHOCKER!

10
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,125
THE PHANTOM LORD GUILD
TRIED TO CAPTURE HER

11
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:41,125
TO TAKE HER BACK TO HER FATHER
BUT MASTER MAKAROV STOPPED THEM

12
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:45,291
USING HIS POWERFUL FAIRY
LAW SPELL BUT NOW--

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:57,958
- ( theme song playing )

14
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,833
- ( people laughing )

15
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:25,166
- EVERYBODY LOOKS SO HAPPY
NOW, DON'T THEY?

16
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,208
- YEAH.

17
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,250
- YOU OKAY, LUCY?

18
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,791
Lucy: MY RESOLVE!

19
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,666
- HEY, GAJEEL. CAN YOU HEAR ME?

20
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,541
- NAH, I CAN'T HEAR NOTHIN'.

21
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:48,458
- I JUST WANNA KNOW WHERE YOU
LEARNED DRAGON SLAYER MAGIC.

22
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,125
- I TOLD YA, I CAN'T HEAR YA!

23
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,750
- YOU'RE THE FIRST
WIZARD I'VE EVER MET

24
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,250
WHO USES THE SAME
KINDA MAGIC I DO!

25
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,625
C'MON, MAN, TELL ME
WHERE YOU LEARNED IT!

26
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:00,375
- SHUT UP.
- AW, DON'T BE LIKE THAT!

27
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,625
- METALICANA.
- HUH?

28
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,916
- THE IRON DRAGON.

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
- NO WAY!

30
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,875
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT'VE BEEN
TAUGHT BY A DRAGON!

31
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,375
- WHY, WERE YOU?

32
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,125
- WHERE'S METALICANA NOW?

33
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,375
- I DON'T KNOW.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,708
TELL ME WHERE HE IS!

35
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,750
- I SAID I DON'T KNOW!

36
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,125
- ( both groaning )

37
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:28,708
- Gajeel: MAN, I FEEL LIKE I'M
STARTIN' TO LOSE BRAIN CELLS

38
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,250
JUST TALKIN' TO YOU.

39
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,708
- WATCH IT, BUDDY.

40
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,750
- HE JUST DISAPPEARED.

41
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,708
YEAH. I'D BEEN TRAINING
WITH METALICANA

42
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,041
BUT THEN ONE DAY HE JUST UP

43
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:45,625
AND LEFT WITHOUT EVEN SAYIN'
A SINGLE WORD TO ME.

44
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,083
TALK ABOUT
A SELFISH JERK.

45
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,041
- WAIT A MINUTE. HE DIDN'T
HAPPEN TO DISAPPEAR

46
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,625
ON THE SEVENTH OF JULY,
SEVEN YEARS AGO, DID HE?

47
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:58,583
- YEAH! ARE YOU SAYIN'
YOU KNOW WHERE METALICANA IS?

48
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:02,125
- DON'T HAVE A CLUE BUT I'VE
BEEN LOOKIN' FOR A FIRE DRAGON.

49
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,125
HIS NAME IS IGNEEL.

50
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:08,208
THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM WAS
JULY 7TH, SEVEN YEARS AGO.

51
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:12,166
- SO BOTH DRAGONS VANISHED
SEVEN YEARS AGO.

52
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,000
YEAR SEVEN-SEVEN-SEVEN.

53
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,916
ON THE SEVENTH DAY OF
THE SEVENTH MONTH?

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,333
- WHAT'S WITH ALL
THE SEVENS, HUH?

55
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,208
- HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

56
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,375
- I DON'T CARE
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

57
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,708
- JUST GET THE HECK
OUT OF HERE ALREADY.

58
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:32,958
- YOU'RE ON OUR TURF, PUNK! IF
ANYONE'S GONNA LEAVE, IT'S YOU!

59
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,708
- GEEZ, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BE SO RUDE ABOUT IT.

60
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,458
- SCRAM BEFORE I HURT YA!

61
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,250
- WELL, LEMME KNOW IF YOU HEAR
ANYTHING ABOUT IGNEEL, OKAY?

62
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:44,125
- ARE YOU KIDDIN' ME? WHY WOULD
I EVER DO YOU ANY FAVORS?

63
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:47,041
- 'CAUSE, YOU AND ME ARE
FELLOW DRAGON SLAYERS.

64
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,458
- AW, SCREW YOU!

65
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,916
NEXT TIME I GET MY HANDS ON
YOU, YOU'RE DEAD MEAT.

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,958
YOU'LL BE BEGGIN' FOR MERCY!

67
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,708
- THERE'S NO NEED
TO BE SO BRUTAL.

68
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,250
I WAS THINKIN' ABOUT
CALLIN' A TRUCE

69
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,250
BUT AFTER THAT OUTBURST,
I DON'T KNOW.

70
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:03,250
- I'M BRUTAL? GIMME A BREAK!
YOU JUST TOTALED OUR GUILD HALL.

71
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,458
- YEAH, BUT ONLY AFTER

72
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,375
YOU GUYS COMPLETELY
DEMOLISHED OURS FIRST.

73
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,291
JUST FORGET IT! I'M NEVER
CALLIN' A TRUCE WITH YOU!

74
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,416
- ( sighs )

75
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:20,208
IT'S IN RUINS. THEY REALLY
DID A NUMBER ON IT, HUH?

76
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:27,416
- MASTER,. I-- I'M SO SORRY.

77
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,250
- AH, CHILD, YOU'VE BEEN
THROUGH A LOT LATELY

78
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,125
BUT DON'T LET IT GET YOU DOWN.

79
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,125
- YEAH, LET'S SEE A SMILE, LUCY!

80
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,041
- LEVY?

81
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,208
- YEP, WE'RE BACK!

82
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,708
- YOU'RE ALRIGHT!

83
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,708
- WE BEAT PHANTOM SO THERE'S
NO REASON FOR YOU TO BE SAD!

84
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,833
- SURE, THEY MIGHT'VE
DESTROYED OUR GUILD HALL,

85
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,458
BUT WE'RE GONNA REBUILD IT
EVEN BIGGER AND BETTER!

86
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,583
- OUI.

87
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:48,916
- YEAH.

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,916
I'M SORRY THAT WE HAD YOU
SO WORRIED, LUCY.

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,541
- NO, IT WAS ALL MY FAULT!

90
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,208
- WE HEARD ABOUT YOUR SECRET.

91
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,333
BUT THERE'S NOT A
SINGLE PERSON IN THE GUILD

92
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,166
WHO THINKS
YOU'RE TO BLAME.

93
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,583
- SHE'S RIGHT. IN FACT,
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

94
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,541
- LUCY.

95
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,208
THOUGH WE MAY NOT
BE ABLE TO SHARE

96
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,333
OUR FEELINGS OF HAPPINESS AND
SADNESS ENTIRELY,

97
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:17,166
WE DO SHARE THEM TO SOME EXTENT.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN A GUILD.

98
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,666
ONE PERSON'S HAPPINESS
BECOMES EVERYONE'S HAPPINESS.

99
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,041
ONE PERSON'S ANGER
BECOMES EVERYONE'S ANGER.

100
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:28,500
AND ONE PERSON'S TEARS
BECOME EVERYONE'S TEARS.

101
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:32,458
THERE'S NO REASON FOR YOU
TO FEEL GUILTY, SO DON'T CRY.

102
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:36,916
YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW HOW MUCH
EVERYONE HERE CARES ABOUT YOU.

103
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,291
HOLD YOUR HEAD HIGH, MY DEAR,

104
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:49,666
BECAUSE YOU ARE A PROUD MEMBER
OF THE FAIRY TAIL FAMILY.

105
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,416
WHILE I'M GLAD
EVERYTHING'S WORKED OUT,

106
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,291
I AM WORRIED ABOUT THE COUNCIL.

107
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,916
THEY'LL BE FURIOUS I'M SURE.

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,625
I HATE TO THINK IT BUT I MIGHT
EVEN BE LOOKING AT PRISON TIME!

109
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,791
(cries )

110
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,750
- MASTER?

111
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,125
- AND THEN--

112
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,291
Lucy: ABOUT A WEEK AFTER
WE DEFEATED PHANTOM,

113
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,541
WE STARTED REBUILDING AND
EVERYTHING SEEMED NORMAL AGAIN.

114
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:39,625
- OKAY! TIME FOR
A BREAK, YOU GUYS!

115
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,000
- BUT IT WASN'T LONG

116
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,875
BEFORE THINGS SUDDENLY TOOK
A TURN FOR THE WORSE.

117
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,208
WE WERE CONFRONTED BY
THE RUNE KNIGHTS,

118
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,916
THE MAGIC COUNCIL'S ARMY.

119
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
- OH BOY.

120
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,583
- GUESS OUR SECRET'S OUT, HUH?

121
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,416
- RUN, GUYS! LET'S GO!
- AYE, SIR!

122
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,458
- SILLY NATSU. YOU KNOW THERE'S
NO ESCAPING THE RUNE KNIGHTS.

123
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,000
- PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER!

124
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,708
- OH, MY GOODNESS.

125
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,208
- Lucy: THEY ROUNDED
EVERYONE UP,

126
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:07,291
AND TOOK US TO A MILITARY POST
FOR EXTENSIVE QUESTIONING.

127
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,458
WE HAD TO ENDURE A WEEK OF
DAILY INTERROGATIONS,

128
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:14,166
BUT EVERYTHING SEEMS TO
HAVE BLOWN OVER NOW.

129
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,583
FROM WHAT I CAN GATHER,
THE COUNCIL HAS DECIDED

130
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:20,416
TO MAKE A RULING ON FAIRY TAIL'S
PUNISHMENT AT A LATER DATE.

131
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,333
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT ME, MOM.

132
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,875
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GONNA
BE TOO HARD ON US.

133
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,458
ALL OF THE EVIDENCE,
INCLUDING EYEWITNESS REPORTS,

134
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:35,125
CLEARLY SHOWS THAT PHANTOM WAS
THE ONE WHO ATTACKED US FIRST.

135
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,250
OW.

136
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,666
MAN, THIS UGLY BRUISE
HURTS SO BAD!

137
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,541
YOU KNOW, MOM, I CAN'T
HELP BUT WONDER

138
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,833
IF DAD REALLY WAS THE ONE
BEHIND ALL OF THIS.

139
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,458
YOU DON'T THINK HE'D GO
THAT FAR, DO YOU?

140
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:03,000
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT
IT, HE WOULD.

141
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:06,000
WITHOUT EVEN GIVING
IT A SECOND THOUGHT.

142
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,208
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY HE'S SO DESPERATE

143
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,916
FOR ME TO COME HOME
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

144
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,166
IT'S NOT LIKE HE EVER CARED
THAT I WAS THERE BEFORE.

145
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,375
MOM?

146
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,166
HE'D DO IT AGAIN, WOULDN'T HE?

147
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,166
USE HIS MONEY TO
TRY AND CONTROL ME.

148
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,583
NO. I WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

149
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,458
NOT THIS TIME.

150
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:34,750
- OH, NATSU.

151
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,875
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR CARRYIN'
TOO MUCH, YA MORON.

152
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,541
- WHAT'D YOU CALL ME?

153
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,000
- YOU GOT A PROBLEM?

154
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,958
- YEAH, I GOT A PROBLEM
WITH YOUR FACE!

155
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,916
- OH, GRAY, MY LOVE,
I WISH YOU'D CARRY ME, TOO!

156
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,833
- CUT IT OUT!
GET BACK TO WORK. NOW!

157
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:52,041
WE'VE GOT A LOT TO DO,
SO NO MORE LOLLYGAGGING!

158
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,041
- AYE.

159
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,375
- I WOULDN'T WANNA
WORK FOR ERZA.

160
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,625
DID SHE REQUIP INTO THAT OUTFIT?

161
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,166
EVEN MASTER MAKAROV'S
HARD AT WORK!

162
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,625
YEAH, IN A BIG WAY.

163
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,458
- HEY, BOSS, WHERE DO YOU
WANT ME TO PUT THIS LUMBER?

164
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,208
- UH. OVER THERE!

165
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,125
- AND NOW SHE'S CALLING
THE MASTER "BOSS"?

166
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,583
- OW! THAT REALLY HURT, ERZA!

167
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,375
- YOU GUYS PLAYIN' WHACK-A-MOLE?

168
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,583
- HATE TO SAY IT.

169
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,208
- BUT IT LOOKS A LITTLE TOO BIG.

170
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,666
- WE FIGURED WE MIGHT AS WELL
EXPAND THE PLACE.

171
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,875
LOOK! I'VE GOT THE PLANS
RIGHT HERE!

172
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:20,625
- OH YEAH?

173
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:21,791
- I WANNA SEE.

174
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,625
- I LIKED IT JUST FINE
HOW IT WAS!

175
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,333
- WHAT'S IT GONNA LOOK LIKE NOW?

176
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,708
- WHAT THE--

177
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,458
- WOW, THAT LOOKS GREAT.

178
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,166
- UH, SO WHICH WAY IS UP?

179
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,458
- MAN, THESE ARE
THE WORST PLANS EVER.

180
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,333
WHAT IDIOT CAME UP WITH THESE?

181
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,625
- MIRA, I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS YOU!

182
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,000
- YOU MADE HER CRY.

183
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,583
- THAT'S GRAY FOR YA.

184
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:47,750
- MY DEAREST GRAY IS SO COLD TO
OTHER WOMEN YET SO WARM TO ME.

185
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,791
- AW, MAN, I'M STARVIN'!

186
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:53,583
- AYE!

187
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,583
- WHEN'S OUR LUNCH BREAK?

188
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,666
WHAT THE--

189
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,083
- I'M SOAKED!
- A LUNCH BOX!

190
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,958
Gray: WHERE'D IT COME FROM?

191
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,333
-OH WOW, THAT
LOOKS PRETTY TASTY!

192
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:08,875
- WHOA, THAT'S AWESOME!
YOUR FACE IS TOTALLY EDIBLE!

193
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,125
- I CAN'T EAT THIS!
IT'S JUST TOO WEIRD

194
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,791
AND SOMETHIN'S OOZING
OUT THE SIDE.

195
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,916
- I'LL EAT IT FOR YA!
- THIS IS HEARTBREAKING!

196
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,875
I SPENT THREE WHOLE DAYS
MAKING THAT LUNCH FOR HIM!

197
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,708
- WHO SAID YOU COULD TAKE
A LUNCH BREAK? HEY.

198
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,416
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE YOUR FACE
MADE OUT OF VEGGIES?

199
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,750
- MM. THIS IS GOOD!
I COULD EAT THE WHOLE THING!

200
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,583
- Gray: GUESS I SHOULD TRY IT.

201
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:36,208
IT'S GREAT! IT'S SO GOOD,
I'D MARRY THE COOK!

202
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,541
WILL YOU MAKE MY LUNCH
EVERY DAY?

203
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,416
- YES! AND WE'LL HAVE
THIRTY-THREE BABIES!

204
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,958
I'M SO HAPPY I COULD CRY!

205
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,666
- Loke: HEY, CAN YOU GUYS
DO ME A FAVOR?

206
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,916
WHEN I WAS IN TOWN
I FOUND LUCY'S GATE KEYS.

207
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,416
COULD YOU GIVE 'EM BACK TO HER?

208
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,583
- OH, HEY, MAN.

209
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,250
WE WERE WONDERING
WHERE YOU'D RUN OFF TO.

210
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,041
- YOU WERE LOOKIN' FOR HER KEYS
THIS WHOLE TIME?

211
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,958
- ARE YOU OKAY?
YOU'RE EVEN PALER THAN USUAL.

212
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,875
- YEAH, I'M FINE.
JUST A LITTLE BEAT.

213
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:05,166
YA KNOW, BEING A GENTLEMAN
IS PRETTY DRAINING.

214
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,375
- WE HAVEN'T SEEN
LUCY AROUND LATELY.

215
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,458
SHE'S PROBABLY STILL TOO
SORE TO HELP OUT.

216
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,458
- WE SHOULD GO AND CHECK ON HER.
WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH US?

217
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,333
- NO, THANKS, I'LL PASS.

218
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:17,708
YOU KNOW I'M NO GOOD
AROUND CELESTIAL WIZARDS.

219
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,875
- AW, COME ON. THIS IS LUCY
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT!

220
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,958
NATSU, EVERYONE HAS DIFFERENT
STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES.

221
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,666
JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE.

222
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:35,666
- KAREN. YOU DON'T
HAVE TO RUSH ME.

223
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:39,625
PLEASE. I NEED MORE TIME.

224
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:42,500
- LUCY!

225
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:43,833
- HOW ARE YA FEELIN'?

226
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,291
- GEEZ! DON'T COME IN
THROUGH THE WINDOW!

227
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,833
- HASN'T ANYONE EVER TAUGHT
YOU BOYS TO USE A DOOR?

228
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,791
- SINCE WHEN ARE YOU
MISS MANNERS?

229
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,166
- FOR REAL.

230
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,750
- WHAT'S THE DEAL?

231
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,125
- NORMALLY SHE'D BE ALL--

232
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,791
- GET OUTTA HERE!

233
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,666
- I WONDER WHERE SHE COULD BE?

234
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,875
- IN THE BATH?

235
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,250
- GRAY, YOU PERVERT!

236
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,333
- I KNOW I'M ASKING FOR IT
BUT IT'S GOTTA BE DONE.

237
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,666
SORRY ABOUT THIS--

238
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,000
- NOT HERE.

239
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,208
- WHERE'D YOU COME FROM?
GET OUTTA HERE, WOULD YA?

240
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,208
- IT SEEMS AS THOUGH
SHE'S NOT HOME.

241
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,291
- WAY TO STATE
THE OBVIOUS, GENIUS!

242
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,250
- Erza: IT'S JUST NOT
THE SAME WITHOUT LUCY.

243
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,416
- Happy: NOBODY CAN YELL
LIKE SHE CAN.

244
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,333
- MY IMPRESSION OF HER
WASN'T THAT BAD.

245
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,958
IT'S NOT LIKE YOURS
WAS ANY BETTER.

246
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:24,916
- LUCY?

247
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
- SHE IN THERE?

248
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,500
- YEAH, LIKE SHE WOULD
FIT IN A DRAWER.

249
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,708
- Happy: WHERE DO YOU BUY
UNDERWEAR LIKE THIS?

250
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:32,958
- Gray: THAT'S UNDERWEAR?

251
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,916
- Erza: I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

252
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,875
WHERE WOULD YOU EVEN WEAR THAT?

253
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:37,750
- FAMILY GATHERING?

254
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,375
- DEFINITELY NOT.

255
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,375
- Gray: C'MON, WOULD YA
SHUT THE DRAWER ALREADY?

256
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,916
- Happy: LUCY!
WHERE ARE YOU HIDING?

257
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,250
- Gray: WOULD YA QUIT LOOKIN'
IN WEIRD PLACES?

258
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:49,708
- OUCHIE.

259
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,125
- SO MANY LETTERS.

260
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,375
- AND THEY'RE STILL SEALED.

261
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,625
- "DEAR MOM. TODAY
WAS A VERY SPECIAL DAY

262
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,708
BECAUSE I JOINED THE
FAIRY TAIL GUILD--"

263
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:59,166
- HEY, MAN, DON'T GO
READIN' HER STUFF!

264
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,458
- "I MET THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
WIZARD NAMED ERZA

265
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,541
WHO'S ACTUALLY REALLY
NICE AND COOL.

266
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,458
"SHE'S ALWAYS YELLING
AT NATSU AND GRAY."

267
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,583
- ARE ALL THESE LETTERS
ADDRESSED TO HER MOM?

268
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:09,958
- IT LOOKS THAT WAY.

269
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,625
- HOW COME SHE NEVER MAILED 'EM?

270
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,791
- I FOUND A NOTE.

271
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,708
EVIDENTLY LUCY LEFT IT FOR US.

272
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,708
IT SAYS SHE'S GOING HOME.

273
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,416
All: NO WAY!

274
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:37,958
- LOOK, DADDY! I MADE A RICE
BALL WITH YOUR FACE ON IT!

275
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,916
I MADE IT SPECIAL FOR YA, DADDY.

276
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,500
IT'S NOT GOOD TO WORK
ON AN EMPTY STOMACH!

277
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,541
- I'M BUSY RIGHT NOW.
COME BACK LATER.

278
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:50,041
- OKAY. I'M JUST GONNA LEAVE IT
HERE IN CASE YOU GET HUNGRY!

279
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,083
TODAY'S SPECIAL, YOU KNOW.
IT'S MY--

280
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:55,375
- LUCY! DON'T YOU EVER LISTEN?

281
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,000
I TOLD YOU, I'M BUSY!

282
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,583
- I'M SORRY.

283
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,041
UM, DADDY?

284
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,458
- STOP BEING SUCH A PEST!

285
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,583
I DON'T WANT TO EAT
YOUR SILLY RICE BALL!

286
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,083
IF I GET HUNGRY,
I'LL CALL THE CHEF.

287
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,958
NOW GO STUDY YOUR BUSINESS
LESSONS AND STOP HASSLING ME.

288
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,791
YOU HEAR ME?
NO MORE INTERRUPTIONS!

289
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:26,250
- BUT, DADDY,
TODAY IS MY BIRTHDAY.

290
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,125
- MS. SUPETTO!

291
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,333
- MISS LUCY HAS COME BACK TO US!

292
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,625
- ( all crying )

293
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,833
- I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE ALRIGHT!
I WAS SO WORRIED!

294
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,041
- I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T
MEAN TO WORRY YOU.

295
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,416
- WELCOME BACK, MISS!

296
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,500
I HOPE YOU'RE READY TO START
HITTING THE BOOKS AGAIN!

297
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,208
- LOOK AT YOU,
YOU'RE ALL GROWN UP NOW.

298
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:57,583
I BET YOU'VE GOT A BOYFRIEND,
DON'T YA? MAYBE TWO?

299
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,666
- CUE THE WATERWORKS.

300
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,291
- THEY HAVEN'T CHANGED ONE BIT.

301
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:12,541
- MISS LUCY? THE MASTER REQUESTS
YOUR PRESENCE IN THE STUDY.

302
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,833
- HIS RUNAWAY DAUGHTER
FINALLY COMES HOME

303
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:21,541
AND HE SENDS A SERVANT TO
"REQUEST MY PRESENCE?"

304
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,250
I SEE HE HASN'T CHANGED EITHER.

305
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,000
I FORGOT ABOUT THE DRESSES.

306
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,000
AND HOW UNCOMFORTABLE
THEY CAN BE.

307
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,666
IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE I'VE HAD TO WEAR ONE.

308
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,541
- IT'S NOT TOO TIGHT
FOR YOU, IS IT?

309
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:37,833
- IT LOOKS LIKE THE SLEEVES

310
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,041
MIGHT BE A WEE BIT TOO SHORT
FOR YOU NOW, MISS.

311
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:44,291
- IT'S OKAY. I GUESS
I'VE GOTTEN TALLER.

312
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,708
HAS IT REALLY BEEN THAT LONG?

313
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,708
- WELL, UH, I SHOULD
PROBABLY GET GOING.

314
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,125
- YES, MA'AM!

315
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,750
- EXCUSE ME, FATHER?

316
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,458
IT'S LUCY. MAY I COME IN?

317
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,250
- YES, YOU MAY.

318
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:04,208
YOU RAN AWAY WITHOUT EVEN SAYING
A WORD TO ME. HOW COULD YOU?

319
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:08,791
- I'M SORRY. I SHOULDN'T HAVE
LEFT WITHOUT SPEAKING TO YOU.

320
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:12,791
IT WAS A POOR DECISION ON MY
PART. ONE I NOW DEEPLY REGRET.

321
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:16,208
- I'M GLAD YOU FINALLY CAME TO
YOUR SENSES AND LEFT THAT GUILD.

322
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,250
A LADY OF YOUR STATUS
SHOULDN'T BE AFFILIATED

323
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,958
WITH THOSE RUFFIANS.

324
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,291
I CERTAINLY WASN'T
LOOKING FORWARD

325
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,666
TO WASTING
ANY MORE OF MY MONEY

326
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,333
TO HAVE IT ERADICATED.

327
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:29,916
YOU FORCED ME TO
GO TO EXTREMES, LUCY.

328
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,750
IF YOU HADN'T ACTED
SO SELFISHLY,

329
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,333
I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO
LASH OUT AT YOUR GUILD.

330
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,583
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO BROUGHT
TROUBLE UPON YOUR FRIENDS.

331
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,791
IT'S BETTER THAT YOU DON'T
ASSOCIATE WITH THEM ANYWAY.

332
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,291
YOU'RE A MEMBER OF
THE HEARTFILIA FAMILY.

333
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,791
YOU HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON
WITH THOSE PEASANTS.

334
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:51,125
YOU COME FROM A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT WORLD THAN THEY DO.

335
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,083
WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE REASON
WHY I WANTED YOU HOME

336
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,791
IN THE FIRST PLACE, DEAR.

337
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,583
IT'S ABOUT OUR FAMILY.

338
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,291
I HAVE ARRANGED FOR YOU
TO MARRY DUKE SAWARR,

339
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,750
THE JUNELLE HEIR.

340
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:04,958
- YES. I SUSPECTED
THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE.

341
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:08,000
- TRY TO THINK OF IT AS
AN INVESTMENT IN YOUR FUTURE.

342
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,583
ONCE YOU'RE MARRIED,
WE'LL HAVE ACCESS

343
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:12,333
TO THE JUNELLE FAMILY'S
VAST LANDS IN THE SOUTH,

344
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,041
WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO
EXPAND THE HEARTFILIA RAILWAY

345
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,791
AND BRING IN MILLIONS.

346
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,583
- I SEE.

347
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,791
- AND I EXPECT YOU TO
GIVE BIRTH TO A BABY BOY.

348
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,208
WE NEED A HEARTFILIA HEIR.

349
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:28,458
THAT IS ALL FOR NOW.
YOU MAY RETURN TO YOUR ROOM.

350
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:34,250
- I'M SORRY, FATHER. BUT
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

351
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,625
I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO MAKE AMENDS.

352
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,791
I CAME HERE TO SAY MY
FINAL GOODBYES.

353
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,291
I REALIZE IT WAS
WRONG OF ME

354
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,666
TO JUST LEAVE WITHOUT
SAYING ANYTHING.

355
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,708
IT'S A DECISION I'VE
REGRETTED EVERY SINGLE DAY.

356
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:50,000
AND SO, I'VE COME BACK TO
TELL YOU EXACTLY HOW I FEEL

357
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,791
BEFORE I LEAVE FOR GOOD.

358
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,458
- LUCY.

359
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,041
- ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD
CAN'T BUY YOU HAPPINESS.

360
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,333
I FIGURED THAT OUT
WHEN I WAS A CHILD.

361
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,416
FINALLY, I'M TRULY HAPPY

362
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,916
AND I'M NOT GONNA LET
YOU RUIN IT FOR ME! YOU HEAR?

363
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,666
I'M WARNIN' YOU.

364
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,333
YOU'D BETTER NOT MESS WITH
FAIRY TAIL EVER AGAIN!

365
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,166
IT DOESN'T MATTER
THAT YOU'RE MY FATHER.

366
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,625
IF YOU THREATEN US,
WE WILL CRUSH YOU

367
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,958
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER ENEMY!

368
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,333
IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY.

369
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:31,458
YOU AND I COULD'VE SAT DOWN
TOGETHER AND TALKED THINGS OUT.

370
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,541
BUT NOW I CAN'T TRUST YOU

371
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,333
'CAUSE YOU'VE HURT TOO
MANY PEOPLE I CARE ABOUT.

372
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,833
I DON'T NEED FANCY DRESSES,

373
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,625
A BIG HOUSE OR LOTS OF
MONEY TO BE HAPPY.

374
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,916
I JUST NEED TO BE
ACCEPTED FOR WHO I AM.

375
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,583
AND I'M NOT "LUCKY" LUCY
HEARTFILIA ANYMORE.

376
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,666
I'M LUCY OF FAIRY TAIL.

377
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,541
THE PEOPLE THERE
TREAT ME LIKE FAMILY,

378
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,583
SOMETHING YOU NEVER DID.

379
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:59,666
IT WAS HARD FOR ME
TO LEAVE THIS HOUSE

380
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,958
BUT ONLY BECAUSE I HAD
SO MANY FOND MEMORIES

381
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,416
OF LIVING HERE WITH MOM.

382
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,416
I CARE SO MUCH ABOUT MS.
SUPETTO, BELO, RIBBON, AND EIDO.

383
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,791
IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME
TO LEAVE THEM BEHIND.

384
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:16,000
BUT IT'S TIME FOR ME TO MOVE ON.

385
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,125
I TRULY BELIEVE
IF MOM WERE STILL ALIVE,

386
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,708
SHE'D TELL ME TO ALWAYS
BE TRUE TO MYSELF

387
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,000
AND DO WHATEVER MAKES ME HAPPY.

388
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,208
- LAYLA.

389
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,791
- SO THIS IS GOODBYE, DADDY.

390
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,166
BYE, MOM.

391
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,166
I'D BETTER GET BACK.

392
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,000
- Fairy Tails: LUCY!

393
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,958
LUCY!

394
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,708
- YOU'RE HERE?

395
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,666
- LUCY!

396
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,833
- I'M SORRY, GUYS. I DIDN'T MEAN
TO FREAK YOU OUT.

397
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,500
- Erza: THERE'S NO NEED
TO APOLOGIZE.

398
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,250
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE JUMPED
TO CONCLUSIONS.

399
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,250
- Gray: YEAH, WE THOUGHT YOU
WERE GOIN' BACK FOR GOOD.

400
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,291
- HAPPY HERE WAS
CRYIN' LIKE A BABY!

401
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,875
- YOU CRIED JUST AS
MUCH AS I DID, NATSU!

402
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,375
- NO, I DID NOT!

403
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,750
- AW, IS SOMEONE EMBARRASSED
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

404
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,541
- I GOTTA TELL YA, I'M KINDA
DIGGIN' YOUR HOMETOWN.

405
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,708
- ME, TOO, IT'S SUCH
A PEACEFUL PLACE.

406
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:54,458
- OH, IT'S NOT A TOWN. THIS IS
JUST PART OF OUR GARDENS.

407
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,500
THE HEARTFILIA ESTATE
GOES ALL THE WAY UP

408
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,958
TO THAT MOUNTAIN OVER THERE.

409
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,041
HUH? WHAT'S THE MATTER,
YOU GUYS?

410
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,625
- HOLY CRAP, SHE'S RICH!

411
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,500
- AND ACTS LIKE IT'S NOTHIN'!

412
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,583
- TWO OF OUR BEST SOLDIERS
ARE DOWN.

413
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:09,291
CAPTAIN ERZA!
WHAT ARE YOUR ORDERS?

414
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:13,083
- WOW. THE SKY IS SO BEAUTIFUL.

415
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:16,750
- WE NEED A MEDIC!
CAPTAIN ERZA HAS A SCREW LOOSE!

416
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,625
- UPPA!

417
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:26,916
- MOM, I KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING
DOWN ON ME FROM HEAVEN.

418
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,750
YOU ALWAYS TAUGHT ME
TO FOLLOW MY DREAMS,

419
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:33,208
SO I'M SURE YOU'D AGREE
WITH MY DECISION TO LEAVE.

420
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:35,875
MY FRIENDS ARE SO SPECIAL TO ME.

421
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:38,625
I REALLY COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.

422
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:41,583
FAIRY TAIL IS MY FAMILY NOW!

423
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:52,666
- ( closing theme song playing )

424
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,958
- WE'VE DONE NOTHIN'
BUT FIGHT LATELY.

425
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:16,500
IF WE DON'T START GETTIN'
TO WORK SOON

426
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:17,958
WE'RE GONNA RUN OUT OF DOUGH.

427
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,333
- WELL, HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT
ANY ROUGH-AND-TUMBLE JOBS

428
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:21,583
YOU COULD PULL OFF?

429
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:24,291
- HEY NOW, I CAN HANDLE
THE DELICATE JOBS, TOO!

430
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,708
- NO, YOU CAN'T.

431
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:28,291
- UH-HUH, AND I'M GONNA
TAKE ONE ON TO PROVE IT TO YOU!

432
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,625
- NAH, DON'T BOTHER.
- I'LL SHOW YOU!

433
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:33,875
- Natsu and Happy:
NEXT TIME: NEXT GENERATION!

434
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:34,958
- Happy: WAIT A MINUTE,
DO YOU EVEN KNOW

435
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:37,083
WHAT THE WORD DELICATE
MEANS, NATSU?

436
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:39,375
- IT'S LIKE NOT PUNCHING
PEOPLE, RIGHT?

437
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:41,625
- EHH! WRONG!
