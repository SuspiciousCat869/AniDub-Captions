00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,875
I won't give up until
I know they're safe.

165
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,166
[LUCY]
I owe it to them!

166
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,916
I have to protect
them no matter what!

167
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,500
Taurus. I close your gate!

168
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,750
Huh? Hey! What in
the hell is going on?!

169
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,958
No! It can't be!

[screaming]

172
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm being torn apart!
This can't be happening to me!

173
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,458
No way.

174
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,708
Is Taurus actually taking
him to the Celestial World?

175
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,916
Curse you! Curse you all!

176
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,750
Taurus! Get out!

177
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:58,791
What happened?

178
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,916
It's working!

179
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,208
[gasps]

180
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,041
Taurus. I close your gate!

181
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:21,250
Huh? Hey! What in
the hell is going on?!

182
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,500
No! It can't be!

I'm being torn apart!
This can't be happening to me!

00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,875
No way.

187
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,250
Is Taurus actually taking him
to the Celestial World?

188
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:37,458
Curse you! Curse you all!

189
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:41,250
Taurus! Get out!

190
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,250
What happened?

191
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,541
It's working!

192
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,708
Aries, I'm closing
your gate too!

193
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,458
Aries, get out now!

194
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:53,250
I'm so incredibly
sorry, Miss Lucy.

195
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,125
Now close Natsu's gate!

196
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,208
[FRANMALTH gasping]

Oh.

00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,250
[NATSU]
Huh?

199
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,458
[FRANMALTH]
He's a Celestial Spirit, too?

200
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,583
[LUCY]
Heh.

201
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,875
Awesome fake out.

202
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:07,458
What a shame! Why did
I fall for that trick?

203
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:17,333
It's no use! Your magic won't
hurt me. You're finished!

204
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:23,916

Ahh.

[FRANMALTH groaning]

00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,166
I suppose he can't
absorb that, huh?

210
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,958
Yeah, it's just a rock.
No soul in it.

211
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:38,625
[NATSU chuckles]

No! Not another one!

[NATSU yelling]

216
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,000
Please! Stop it!
It really hurts!

217
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,458

00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,083
Nice job.

221
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,125
[LUCY gasps]

222
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,625
What? Were all those
rocks still not enough?

223
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,583
[NATSU] I think those must be
the souls that were inside him.

224
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:45,875
[HAPPY]
Aye.

225
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:51,166
Hey, Lucy. When we were
thinking about important things,

226
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,208
what kinda stuff
were you focusing on?

227
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,791
I was thinking about
you guys, actually.

228
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,541
My guild mates and spirits.

229
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,666
Oh, yeah. That totally
sounds like you.

230
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,333
I could hear you over there.
You kept on chanting,

231
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,125
"Carla and yummy fishies,
Carla and yummy fishies."

232
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,083
[HAPPY chuckles nervously]

233
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,958
[VOICE]
It's not over yet.

234
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,000
[grunts]

235
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:22,000
[HADES] Using Face is not
the ultimate goal of Tartaros.

236
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,541
Makarov must unleash the light.

237
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,166
Now, before it's too late.

238
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,458
Okay... What was that?

239
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,416
I think it was
Master Hades' ghost.

240
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,750
Pretty sure it was his
soul being released.

241
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,916
[LUCY]
Unleash the light?

242
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,708
What does that even mean?

243
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,625
[HAPPY] We need to tell
Master. He'll understand.

244
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,625
[LUCY]
Well, the good news is

245
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,666
Wendy and Carla
stopped the Face.

246
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,291
We still don't know
where Mira is.

247
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,375
All I know is I've still
got some work to do,

248
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,291
and that's kickin'
demons' butts!

249
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:02,250
Okay. I'll go and tell
Master what's up.

250
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,083
Please be careful!

251
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,041
You too!

252
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,458
[FRANMALTH chuckles]

253
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,041
[FRANMALTH]
What a bunch of idiots.

254
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:13,875
They still don't understand that
they will never win against us.

255
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,541
We possess the power
of immortality.

256
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,875
Our lab is the most
valuable tool in the world,

257
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,875
and as long as we have that,
we can keep coming back.

258
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,416
Speaking of,

259
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,083
I suppose there's a vat with
my name on it waiting for me.

260

262
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,416
You okay, Mira?

263
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,083
I think you should be
more worried about yourself.

264

[LUMMY laughing]

265
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,208
Get off me, you
annoying little pest!

266
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,041
[SEILAH] What are you?
Explain yourself!

267
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:07,208
No mere human could be
immune to my Macro power!

268
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,208
Macro?

269
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,583
That must be the
name of the magic

270
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,083
that she used to control Elfman!

271
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,250
She uses curses, dummy!

272
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,000
Why would it work
on your brother,

273
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,375
but have no effect on you?

274
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,916
Macro is rather unique.

275
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,833
I can weave my victim's tales
for as long as I desire.

276
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,541
My previous servants are
available to me at all times,

277
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,541
to do whatever I ask of them.

278
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:27,625
[MIRAJANE]
No.

279
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:28,958
[SEILAH]
If it pleases me,

280
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,916
I could have him slit
his own throat, right now.

281
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,583
Don't you dare!

282
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,375
That runt!

283
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,583
Is that Ezel?

284
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,666
Hurry up! I don't wanna
wait around all day!

285
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,291
Revive me, so I can go gobble up

286
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,791
that squirt and her
smarty pants cat!

287
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:48,750
What's going on?

288
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,083
[EZEL]
Come on!

289
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,791
Get me back to normal
so I can settle the score.

290
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,375
First, I'm gonna take
that little windbag

291
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,125
and break her into
bite-sized pieces!

292
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,500
Then I'm gonna turn that little
kitty of hers into a hat!

293
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,500
[MIRAJANE] He's talking
about Wendy and Carla!

294
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,083
Did the two of them
actually beat this guy?

295
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:06,833
But how? If they beat him,
then how did he end up in here?

296
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,166
[EZEL]
Don't leave me hangin', Lummy!

297
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,458
[LUMMY yelps]

298
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:13,166
Hey, Seilah!

299
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,791
[SEILAH] I'll get to you as soon
as I deal with my own pests.

300
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,208
It won't be long.

301
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,708
Revive me right now and
you and I can double team 'em!

302
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,125
Revive him?

303
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:25,625
Oh, FYI, we're in our very own
respawn HQ, Hell's Core.

304
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:26,958
Badass name, huh?

305
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,000
We're like the
Underworld King's faves.

306
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,250
So he gave us the power
to come back to life.

307
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,333
Pretty handy whenever things get
a little too rough out there.

308
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,541
The only guild with immortality.

309
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,708
There's no way. That's nuts.

310
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,875
I don't believe
any of that stuff.

311
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:44,458
I'm afraid your mouth has
outpaced your brain. As usual.

312
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:45,875
Whoops, my bad!

313
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,000
I appreciate the info.

314
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,250
[MIRAJANE] It seems like
the first thing I should do

315
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,208
is start tearing up this room!

316
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,291
And what makes you
think you could do that?

317
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,125
Just watch me!

318
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,583
[gasps]

319
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,708
[FRANMALTH]
Ta-dah!

320
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,791
Hey, Lummy, I could use a little
pick me up right about now!

321
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,000
[yelps]

322
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,916
OMG! That cow's
wrecking my lab!

323
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,916
Go, Mira! Tear it up!

324
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,708
Oh please, noooo!

325
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,666
What? But how?
That's impossible!

326
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,708
Oh, is it, now? 'Cause
it seems possible to me!

327
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,750
I used my take over magic.

328
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,208
It let me control your
little tentacle demons.

329
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,875
This human can absorb demons?

330
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,500
That must be the problem.

331
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,875
Why I can't use my
Macro curse on her.

332
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,583
Frustrating isn't it?

333
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,875
I was hoping I'd be able
to absorb you too.

334
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,708
But for some reason,
it's just not happening.

335
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,625
It's kinda weird how you
and I seem to be having

336
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,500
the exact same problem.

337
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,666
No way.

338
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,250
Their powers just
cancel each other out.

339
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,833
So!

340
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:07,125
The winner will be decided by a
good old fashioned fist fight!

341
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,458
Some hand-to-hand
combat, huh?

342
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:11,875
Sounds like fun to me!

343
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:15,750
Sitri! Good idea, sis!
Use your ultimate demon form!

344
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:19,666
You've gotta be kidding me.
"Ultimate demon form" my butt!

345
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,833
You do realize who you're
dealing with, right?

346
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,625
Seilah here is the real deal.

347
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,916
A demon straight from the books
of our dark lord Zeref himself!

348
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,208
Obey my order.

349
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,625
That won't work.

350
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,291
[SEILAH]
Release my limiter!

351
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,708
She's controlling herself?

352
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:52,625
[BOTH gasp]

353
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,916
[BOTH screaming]

354
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,750
Careful. Please, Mira.

355
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,666
Oh no.

356
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,541
[laughing]

357
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,875
What did I tell ya?

358
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,291
Your sister never had a chance

359
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,250
when she decided to go up
against a legit demon.

360
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,750
Yeah, well, you just haven't
seen what Mira can do yet.

361
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:34,666
[LUMMY laughing]

362
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,250
Oh, give me a freaking break!

363
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,000
You should've just died
before things got ugly.

364
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,375
And it is gonna get real ugly.

365
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,333
You won't believe the things
Tartaros is capable of.

366
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:46,916
It's almost game over.

367
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,208
For Fairy Tail, and every
other grody human out there.

368
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,541
We need to move
kinda slow, okay.

369
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,416
The ground is
pretty uneven here.

370
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,000
All right. Thank you.

371
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,416
Love. It's in the air!

372
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,916
[MELDY]
Would you knock it off?

373
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,250
So, what are we doing?

374
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,541
Don't ask me.

375
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,583
[ANGEL]
Are they just ignoring us?

376
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,750
[JELLAL]
Meldy, is there something wrong?

377
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,833
[MELDY]
No.

378
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,208
My feet hurt from
all this walking,

379
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,083
but I just need
to rest a minute.

380
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,041
[JELLAL] Your footsteps
were getting heavy.

381
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,333
[HOTEYE]
How glorious.

382
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,458
Love keeps us in tune
with others, yes?

383
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,541
Don't read more into it.

384
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,375
[RACER sighs]

385
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:50,708
Hey, guys, are you seriously
gonna follow these losers?

386
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,458
I'm sure as hell not.

387
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,458
It is a lot to take in.

388
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:57,500
Huh. Could we really kill Zeref?

389
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,375
Well, I think we should
start with killing Jellal.

390
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:03,250
I'm getting pretty sick
of hearing you complain.

391
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,708
What's your deal?

392
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,375
You don't actually
trust this scumbag

393
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,416
after all he's put
us through, do ya?

394
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,166
I dunno. Jury's still out.

395
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,625
The voices. They're
getting louder.

396
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,833
Say what?

397
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:18,541
I wouldn't even call 'em voices,

398
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:21,458
'cause they're not sayin'
anything I can understand.

399
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,250
It's just screams.

400
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:25,791
That's kinda creepy.

401
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,000
Well, what else?

402
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:29,250
Do you know what they're
all screaming about?

403
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:32,541
Got no idea, but I bet
if we stick with him,

404
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:35,500
we could find out about
all kinds of things.

405
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:39,291
Whatever this is, I just
gotta hear it for myself.

406
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:15,041
[LUCY] The fighting between
Fairy Tail and Tartaros

407
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:16,125
rages on.

408
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:17,958
Meanwhile, the
Oración Seis proves

409
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,750
they can keep a grudge
going for a long time.

410
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:23,541
But, as they travel next to
the man they can't forgive,

411
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:26,041
they run into a survivor
from Grimoire Heart.

412
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:27,708
You remember Rustyrose?

413
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:29,750
We all thought he'd died
back on Tenrou Island,

414
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,250
but here he is again.

415
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:34,041
And he's got something
major to share with them.

416
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:37,875
Next Time: "Tartaros Chapter
Underworld King."

417
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:41,708
The underworld still has a lot
of surprises in store for us.
