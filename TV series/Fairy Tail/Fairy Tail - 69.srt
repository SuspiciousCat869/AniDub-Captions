1
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:20,000
- Natsu:
PREVIOUSLY, ON "FAIRY TAIL"...

2
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,958
- Happy: IT WAS TOUGH,
BUT OUR BAND OF HEROES

3
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,375
FINALLY BEAT THE ORACION SEIS
AND NIRVANA.

4
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,250
GO TEAM!
 - Lucy: UNFORTUNATELY,

5
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,458
THE SWEET TASTE OF VICTORY
TURNED BITTER

6
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:31,250
AS WE WERE FORCED
TO SAY GOODBYE TO DEAR FRIENDS.

7
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:35,625
- ( theme music playing )

8
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

9
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,875
- Ultear: MASTER HADES.

10
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:12,875
I'M SORRY TO DISTURB YOU,
MY LORD.

11
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,500
- Hades: IS IT AS I EXPECTED?

12
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:17,250
- IT IS INDEED, MASTER.

13
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,083
THE ORACION SEIS HAVE FALLEN

14
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:22,000
AND NIRVANA WAS DESTROYED
BY THE OFFICIAL GUILDS.

15
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:25,583
- THE COALITION WAS AS CAPABLE
AS I'D ANTICIPATED.

16
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,708
OUR OBJECTIVE
REMAINS UNHINDERED.

17
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:30,666
- YES, SIR. NIRVANA'S
DESTRUCTION IS BUT A RIPPLE

18
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,833
IN THE VAST SEA OF OUR SCHEME.

19
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,333
IT WON'T BE LONG
BEFORE WE POSSESS

20
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,541
THE KEYS TO ZEREF'S SEAL.

21
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:37,791
HOWEVER--

22
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,375
- DO NOT TRY MY
PATIENCE, ULTEAR.

23
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:43,125
- NIRVANA'S DESTRUCTION
MAY SERVE AS THE HERALD

24
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,250
OF AN EVEN
GREATER DISTURBANCE.

25
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,166
SO GREAT, IN FACT, THAT IT WILL
RENDER OUR GOALS UNREACHABLE

26
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,625
IF LEFT UNCHECKED.

27
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,666
- ( chuckles )
NOW THIS IS ENTERTAINING.

28
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,708
YOU AREN'T AFRAID, ARE YOU?

29
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:58,041
- NOT AT ALL,
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

30
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,875
- AH! SO THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO SAIL THE SEAS

31
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,833
WITHOUT PUKING
YOUR BRAINS OUT.

32
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,833
- AYE, MATEY,
WELCOME TO THE GOOD LIFE.

33
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,250
- HA HA!
LOOK OUT, VEHICLES.

34
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,250
NATSU'S GONNA RIDE YOU HARD.
- CAREFUL!

35
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,375
THE TROIA SPELL
DOESN'T LAST FOREVER.

36
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,291
- FOR THOSE OF YOU
WHO MIGHT NOT KNOW,

37
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,875
TROIA IS A HEALING SPELL
THAT CURES MOTION SICKNESS.

38
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:23,416
- ARGH! NO.
CAST THAT SPELL AGAIN.

39
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
HURRY.
- I'M SORRY, I CAN'T.

40
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,583
IT ONLY WORKS
A COUPLE OF TIMES.

41
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,666
- GUESS IT'S BACK TO BARF BAGS.
- ( laughs )

42
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,750
- WHEN YOU AND WENDY
JOIN FAIRY TAIL,

43
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:35,375
I'LL SHOW YOU ALL THE SNUGGLING
SPOTS PERFECT FOR KITTIES.

44
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,500
- I'M JOINING YOUR GUILD
TO STAY CLOSE TO WENDY,

45
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,208
NOT BECAUSE I HAVE ANY INTEREST
IN YOU.

46
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:42,666
- WE'RE JOINING FAIRY TAIL!
THIS IS SO EXCITING.

47
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:50,125
- ( Happy speaking )

48
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,750
- Lucy: WITH A HARD-FOUGHT
BATTLE NOW BEHIND US,

49
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,166
IT'S FINALLY TIME
TO RETURN TO HOME.

50
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,958
- MAN!  MAY YOUR PARFUMS
GRACE MY NOSTRILS AGAIN,

51
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,250
MISS ERZA AND MISS LUCY.

52
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,833
- BE SURE TO COME VISIT US
WHENEVER YOU FEEL LIKE IT.

53
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,000
- WHEN YOU DO, BE READY
FOR THE BEST NIGHT

54
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,250
BLUE PEGASUS CAN OFFER.

55
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,125
- GIVE MY WARMEST REGARDS
TO MASTER MAKAROV.

56
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,625
- OH, AND GRAY,
FIX THAT STRIPPING HABIT.

57
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,875
- LIKE YOU HAVE
ANY ROOM TO TALK, YOU BONEHEAD!

58
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,250
- QUESTION.

59
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,666
WHAT DO WE DO
ABOUT THOSE TWO?

60
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,791
- WELL, AREN'T YOU RUNNING
OFF WITH YOUR LITTLE FRIENDS?

61
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,208
- YEAH, AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT GONNA MISS YOU.

62
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,833
- SHERRY.
- REN.

63
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,291
- THEY'RE SO IN LOVE!

64
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:34,125
- Lucy: IT'S CERTAINLY BEEN
A WILD RIDE, MOM.

65
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,708
OH, AND YOU'LL NEVER GUESS
WHAT HAPPENED.

66
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,958
I GOT
THREE NEW CELESTIAL KEYS.

67
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,625
- Gemi: ANGEL'S LOCKED UP,

68
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,416
SO NOW OUR CONTRACTS WITH HER
ARE NULL AND VOID.

69
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,750
- Mini: THAT'S RIGHT.

70
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,250
- NOW THAT WE'RE FREE.

71
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,208
WE'VE ALL DECIDED
THE BEST PERSON

72
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,000
TO TAKE OVER OUR CONTRACTS
WOULD BE NONE OTHER THAN YOU,

73
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,916
LUCY HEARTFILIA.
WICKED!

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,750
- WOULD YOU PLEASE BE OUR
WIZARD? - Both: PIRI-PIRI.

75
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,458
- SO YOU REALLY WANT
TO FORM CONTRACTS WITH ME?

76
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,250
ARE YOU GUYS SURE ABOUT THIS?

77
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,958
YOU "GUYS"?

78
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,875
- WE'RE JUST USED
TO BEING CALLED PETS

79
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,500
AFTER WORKING WITH ANGEL
ALL THIS TIME.

80
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:07,791
- I KNOW.

81
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,041
BUT THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR ME.

82
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,125
I THINK
OF MY SPIRITS AS EQUALS.

83
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,750
YOU'RE NO DIFFERENT TO ME
THAN MY GUILD MATES.

84
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,583
YOU'RE LIKE FAMILY.

85
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,166
- HMMM!

86
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,250
- IT WOULD BE OUR PLEASURE
TO WORK WITH YOU, LUCY.

87
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,708
- Both: PIRI-PIRI.

88
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,250
- I HOPE WE'RE TOGETHER
FOR A LONG TIME,

89
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,458
SCORPIO, GEMINI AND ARIES.

90
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:31,250
NEW FRIENDS ARE COMING
INTO MY LIFE IN DROVES.

91
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,833
AND I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER!

92
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,333
- Erza: LONG STORY SHORT--

93
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:38,041
WENDY AND CARLA ARE
FAIRY TAIL'S NEWEST MEMBERS,

94
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,875
SO YOU'D BETTER
TREAT THEM WELL.

95
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,958
- IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU ALL.

96
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,375
- ADORABLE! - LOOK
THERE'S EVEN A FEMALE HAPPY.

97
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,875
- I BET YOUR MOM'S
REAL PRETTY!

98
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,375
- WE'RE SO GLAD YOU MADE IT
BACK SAFELY.

99
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,291
- HELLO, MASTER.

100
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,291
- GREAT WORK, ERZA.

101
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,375
I'M SURE THINGS
WILL QUIET DOWN

102
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:58,041
NOW THAT THE ORACION SEIS
ARE OUT OF THE PICTURE.

103
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,083
AND THANKS FOR BRINGING
TWO PRECIOUS

104
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,208
YET POWERFUL ADDITIONS
TO THE GUILD BACK WITH YOU.

105
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,416
- GIRL,
IT'S BEEN TOO LONG!

106
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,125
- YOU'RE TELLING ME.
- HUG ATTACK!

107
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,750
- AWW.  NOW THAT'S AN ATTACK
I'LL ALWAYS TAKE.

108
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,208
- DOES LUCY
SEEM DIFFERENT TO YOU?

109
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,791
- KIND OF.

110
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,958
WHO KNOWS WHAT CRAZINESS
SHE HAD TO GO THROUGH?

111
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,666
- ( crashing )
- Both: OH!

112
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,083
- GRAY, DARLING.
YOU'RE BACK!

113
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,041
I'M SO HAPPY
YOU MADE IT HOME.

114
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,416
MY TEARS ARE FLOWING
LIKE WATERFALLS!

115
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,875
- GRAY. STOP YOUR GIRLFRIEND,
MAN, WE'RE DYING HERE!

116
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,666
- SHE'S NOT
MY FREAKIN' GIRLFRIEND!

117
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,250
- AND THEN THE GIANT SNAKE
SPROUTED WINGS

118
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,500
AND STARTED FLYING!

119
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,041
- YEAH, YEAH, NOW I KNOW
YOU'RE PULLING MY LEG.

120
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,750
SNAKES AREN'T MANLY ENOUGH
TO FLY.

121
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:39,833
- YOU SAW IT.

122
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,208
- WELCOME TO FAIRY TAIL,
YOU TWO.

123
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,708
I'M MIRAJANE.
- WOW!

124
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,125
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

125
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,250
FIRST I MET ERZA,
NOW MISS MIRAJANE.

126
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,166
- I'M GUESSING YOUR FELINE
FRIEND USES

127
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,500
THE SAME MAGIC AS HAPPY.

128
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,125
YOU MIND TELLING US
WHAT TYPE OF MAGIC YOU USE?

129
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,791
- WAIT A MINUTE.

130
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,041
DON'T YOU DARE COMPARE ME
TO THAT FURRY HORN DOG!

131
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,583
- DON'T MIND HER.

132
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,541
I USE HEALING
AND SUPPORT MAGIC.

133
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,833
ACTUALLY,
I'M A SKY DRAGON SLAYER.

134
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,291
- ( all gasping )

135
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:12,333
- DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG
ALREADY?

136
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:15,000
- All: THAT'S AWESOME!

137
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,750
WE HAVE
ANOTHER DRAGON SLAYER!

138
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:22,000
- AW, YEAH!
- JUST LIKE NATSU AND GAJEEL!

139
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,833
- I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A GUILD
WITH THREE DRAGON SLAYERS IN IT!

140
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,750
WE'RE GONNA BE
EVEN MORE UNSTOPPABLE NOW.

141
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,708
- WELCOME TO THE FAMILY.
HAPPY TO HAVE YOU ABOARD.

142
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,833
- ( both meowing )

143
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,916
- IT'S NOT FAIR.

144
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,625
SERIOUSLY!

145
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:45,000
I MEAN
I'M A DRAGON SLAYER TOO.

146
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:49,125
WHEN DO I GET
MY OWN FLYING KITTY CAT, HUH?

147
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,541
- ALL RIGHT EVERYONE,
LISTEN UP!

148
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,958
LET'S WELCOME OUR NEW MEMBERS
THE WAY ONLY FAIRY TAIL CAN!

149
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,916
NOW, EAT, DRINK,
AND MAKE MERRY!

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,125
YEAH!
WHO WANTS TO BRAWL?

151
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,750
- AH!  LOOK AT ME
AND YOU LOSE AN EYE.

152
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,458
OH YEAH?
WELL, IT'D BE WORTH IT, BABY.

153
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,291
- DARLING, ARE YOU CHEATING
ON ME WITH THAT TRAMP?

154
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,208
- HUH?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?

155
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,041
- YOU KNOW, CARLA, IF YOU EAT
A FISH WITH A LOVED ONE,

156
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,916
YOU'LL HAVE GOOD LUCK.
- THAT IS NOT YOU.

157
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,916
- EVERYONE IS SO LIVELY
AND FILLED WITH HAPPINESS.

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,666
- KEEP YOUR GUARD UP, CHILD.

159
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,916
- MMM.

160
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,083
- HAS ANYTHING ON THE BOARD
CAUGHT YOUR INTEREST?

161
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,375
- THERE'RE SO MANY,
IT'S HARD TO PICK ONE.

162
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,125
- TAKE YOUR TIME.

163
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,166
THOUGH, IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND
A LITTLE ADVICE,

164
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,125
I'D STAY AWAY
FROM SOLO JOBS FOR NOW.

165
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,291
SINCE YOU'RE
JUST STARTING OUT,

166
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,041
IT MIGHT BE BEST TO ASSIST
ANOTHER TEAM

167
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,208
WITH ONE OF THEIR JOBS.

168
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,708
- YOU'LL TAKE A PAY CUT,
OF COURSE,

169
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,875
BUT THE EXPERIENCE
IS WELL WORTH IT.

170
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,791
- SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF FUN.

171
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,333
- I ADMIRE YOUR ENTHUSIASM,

172
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,416
BUT TAKE A LOOK
AT YOUR POTENTIAL PARTNERS.

173
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,750
- ( both laughing )

174
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,916
- ( squealing )

175
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,916
- NOT A CHANCE.

176
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,083
- HELPING WENDY FIND A GOOD JOB,
MIRAJANE?

177
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,833
- ACTUALLY, I THINK IT'D BE
BEST FOR HER TO TAG ALONG

178
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,958
ON SOMEONE ELSE'S JOB
AND GET SOME EXPERIENCE.

179
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,333
- GOOD PLAN.  I MEAN, LU-LU HERE
GOT HER START IN FAIRY TAIL

180
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,416
BY HELPING NATSU, RIGHT?

181
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,375
- AND IT'S LED ME INTO MORE
HORRIFYING AND DEADLY SITUATIONS

182
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,375
THAN ANY GIRL
SHOULD HAVE TO ENDURE.

183
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,500
- YOU'VE GOT MORE COURAGE
THAN ME, THAT'S FOR SURE.

184
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,125
- COURAGE.

185
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,625
WELL, THEN,
SINCE THE TWO OF YOU ARE HERE,

186
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,083
IS THERE ANY WORK
THAT YOU NEED HELP WITH?

187
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,583
I MAY STILL BE PRETTY GREEN,

188
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,833
BUT I PROMISE
TO DO MY VERY BEST.

189
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,458
- WE COULD REALLY USE THAT KIND
OF ATTITUDE IN SHADOW GEAR.

190
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,666
- YOU WORKED WITH US BEFORE,
SO WHY NOT STICK AROUND?

191
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,041
- UHH, SOMEHOW I THINK STICKING
WITH YOUR LITTLE GANG

192
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,750
MIGHT BE BAD FOR HER HEALTH.

193
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,750
- ( laughs )

194
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,958
- WHY NOT HAVE HER WORK
WITH BOTH TEAMS?

195
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,541
- GOOD IDEA.

196
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,750
- SO WHICH TEAM
GETS YA FIRST?

197
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,250
- HMM.

198
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,208
- YO, NATSU.

199
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,916
- YEAH, WHAT IS IT?

200
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,291
- Elfman:
WHERE'VE YOU BEEN HIDING, MAN?

201
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:17,916
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU FOR DAYS.
DID YOU TAKE A VACATION?

202
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,833
- WHAT'S WRONG, MY LOVE?
YOU SEEM RATHER TROUBLED.

203
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:25,291
- WHEN I WAS ON MY WAY HERE
I HEARD SOMETHING CRAZY.

204
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,750
- AND THAT WOULD BE?

205
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:31,333
- THE RUMOR MILL'S RUNNING
PRETTY HARDCORE AROUND TOWN.

206
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:34,375
APPARENTLY THERE'S BEEN
A DRAGON SIGHTING.

207
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:40,000
- Happy: SOMEONE SAW A DRAGON?
FOR REAL?

208
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:43,041
- OKAY.
YOU'VE GOT MY ATTENTION.

209
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,625
WAS IT IGNEEL?

210
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:49,000
- I DIDN'T HEAR ANY NAMES,
SPECIFICALLY.

211
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,458
- ALL RIGHT. DID YOU
AT LEAST TALK TO THE GUY

212
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,750
WHO SAID HE SAW THIS DRAGON?
- NO.

213
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,833
LIKE I SAID,
IT'S JUST A RUMOR I HEARD.

214
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,791
APPARENTLY THE PERSON
WHO STARTED IT,

215
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,583
SOME WOMAN NAMED DAPHNE,
SAYS THERE'S MORE TO THE STORY.

216
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,833
ACCORDING TO HER,
SHE DIDN'T JUST SEE IT.

217
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:06,083
SHE SAYS SHE ACTUALLY SPOKE
WITH THE DRAGON.

218
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,208
- LIKE, IN PERSON?
IS IT TRUE, GRAY?

219
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,583
- DON'T KNOW, BUT IT'S WORTH
CHECKING OUT, DON'T YA THINK?

220
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,750
- HOW DO WE FIND HER?
- GO TO THE RISE LODGE.

221
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,041
IT'S IN
THE WESTERN WASTELANDS.

222
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,666
- THANKS, I OWE YA ONE.
LET'S GO, HAPPY.

223
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,333
- AYE, SIR.

224
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,791
- MIND IF I COME?
I WON'T BUG YOU.

225
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,416
I JUST WANNA SEE
IF IT'S GRANDEENA.

226
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,666
- SURE, THE MORE THE MERRIER.
TAGGING' ALONG, GAJEEL?

227
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,375
- RUN AROUND WITH YOU LOSERS?
YEAH, LIKE I'D WANNA DO THAT.

228
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,333
- I KNOW YOU'RE AS CURIOUS
AS WE ARE.

229
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,666
- LISTEN TO YOURSELF
FOR TWO SECONDS.

230
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,750
YOU HEAR "DRAGON" AND YOU'RE OFF
ON A WILD GOOSE CHASE.

231
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,083
STORIES LIKE THIS
ARE SUCKERBAIT,

232
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,375
BUT I GUESS THEY HOOKED ONE.

233
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,666
IT'S POINTLESS
TO GET YOUR HOPES UP.

234
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,125
I LEARNED THAT
A LONG TIME AGO.

235
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,958
- WHAT IF IT WAS METALICANA?

236
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,666
WOULD YOU STILL
JUST SIT HERE?

237
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,916
- NO, I'D GO PUNCH HIM
IN THE FACE.

238
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,958
I DON'T GET WHY YOU'D CARE
ABOUT SOMEONE WHO ABANDONED YOU.

239
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,000
YOU WANNA WASTE TIME,
BE MY GUEST.

240
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,375
- YOU REALLY FEEL THAT WAY?

241
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,416
- I BET IF IT
REALLY WAS METALICANA,

242
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,000
HE'D GO RUNNING TO HIM
IN TEARS.

243
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,583
- DON'T LET HIM HEAR YOU
SAY THAT.

244
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,750
- GUESS IT'S JUST US THEN.
- RIGHT!

245
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,791
I HOPE IT REALLY IS GRANDEENA.

246
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,125
I MISS HER.

247
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,708
- I'M SURE.

248
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,541
BUT DON'T GET YOUR HOPES
TOO HIGH

249
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:21,791
OR YOU MIGHT BE DISAPPOINTED.

250
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,458
- THANKS FOR THE TIP, MAN.

251
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,083
I GUESS YOU REALLY
ARE USEFUL FOR SOMETHIN'.

252
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,833
- MY PLEASURE.

253
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,416
- Erza: I'D LIKE TO ORDER
THIS ONE.

254
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,291
- SURE.
I MUST SAY,

255
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,833
YOU'RE ONE OF MY MOST LOYAL
AND FREQUENT CUSTOMERS.

256
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:54,083
- I BUY ONE EACH TIME
WE RECRUIT NEW MEMBERS.

257
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,250
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
IT'S TRADITION NOW.

258
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,125
- HEE HEE! HAPPY TO KNOW
THAT MY TREATS ARE APPRECIATED.

259
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,541
- YOU'RE A MASTER OF YOUR CRAFT.

260
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,250
SO ARE 50 CAKES DOABLE?

261
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,083
- EH?  YOU'VE RECRUITED
50 NEW MEMBERS?

262
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:08,125
- ONLY TWO, ACTUALLY.
THE REST ARE FOR ME.

263
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,458
- AHHH!

264
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:13,041
PLEASE, COME AGAIN!

265
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,833
- RE-QUIPPING?

266
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,500
I DON'T SENSE IT ANYMORE.

267
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,916
WHAT WAS THAT?

268
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:00,583
- Happy:
KIND LOOKS OUT OF PLACE, HUH?

269
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,958
- NOT TO MENTION RUN-DOWN.

270
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:13,458
- IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE ANYONE'S AROUND.

271
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,833
- I THINK THAT'S BY DESIGN.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

272
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,208
- THIS PLACE IS RUN
AUTOMATICALLY

273
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,833
BY A LACRIMA LODGING SYSTEM.

274
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,875
IT CAN CHECK IN
AND CHECK OUT PATRONS,

275
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,333
SO THERE'S NO NEED TO HIRE
EMPLOYEES TO WORK THE DESK.

276
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,166
- WOW. BLESSED WITH BEAUTY
AND BRAINS TO BOOT.

277
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,000
- YOU'D THINK THERE'D AT
LEAST BE SOMEONE AROUND

278
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,000
TO MAINTAIN THE PLACE,

279
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,583
BUT I DON'T EVEN SEE
ANY LODGERS.

280
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,875
- NEXT TIME I SEE GRAY,
I'LL PUNCH HIM IN THE NOSE.

281
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,458
- IF YOU DON'T MIND
ME SAYING SO,

282
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,750
I THINK WE'RE JUMPING THE GUN.

283
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,625
THERE'RE PLENTY OF ROOMS
TO CHECK.

284
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,125
IF THE LODGE IS AUTOMATIC,

285
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,541
DAPHNE MIGHT BE STAYING
IN ONE OF THEM.

286
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,250
- ALL RIGHT THEN.
LET'S SPLIT UP

287
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,375
AND START KNOCKING
ON ALL THE DOORS.

288
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,833
HELLO?

289
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,708
- SORRY TO DISTURB YOU.

290
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,166
- WOW!

291
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:01,250
YOU SAW NOTHING.
- WHATEVER YOU SAY, BABY.

292
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,666
- HONESTLY.

293
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,833
WHAT IS WITH
THIS SHODDY ROACH MOTEL?

294
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,583
- SO FAR WE'VE CHECKED OUT
ALMOST EVERY SINGLE ROOM

295
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,750
IN THIS PLACE.

296
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,291
- GUESS THAT MEANS
THIS IS THE LAST ONE--

297
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,333
WHICH IS SO NOT SUSPICIOUS
IN ANY WAY!

298
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,791
I MEAN, COME ON,
IS THAT A GIANT HAPPY DOLL?

299
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,166
IS ANYONE NAMED DAPHNE
IN THERE?!

300
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,708
- Daphne: YES YES!

301
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,541
- ALL RIGHT.
- OPEN UP.

302
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,375
WE NEED TO TALK WITH HER NOW!

303
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,208
- MY MY.

304
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,833
YOU CERTAINLY
ARE A NOISY BUNCH, AIN'T YA?

305
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:34,541
- WE HEARD YOU MIGHT
BE ABLE TO HELP US.

306
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,083

00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,833

311
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,166

DAZZLIN' DAPHNE!

314
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:56,833
AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT

315
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,833
THE OLD RUN-OF-THE-MILL
BEAUTY, FRIENDS.

316
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,666
I MEAN REAL BEAUTY.
GENUINE BEAUTY.

317
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,666
BEAUTIFUL BEAUTY
ONLY NATURE PROVIDES.

318
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,708
YES. YES. YES. YES.

00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,500
AND HERE IS A FABULOUS PRODUCT
THAT WILL HELP YOU

321
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,916
MIRACLE DIET METAMO-CHAN.

322
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,458
- MULTIPLE CHINS?
- Fat Happy: YUMMY.

323
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,500
- BEAUTY, HUH?
- YES YES.

324
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:18,458
YOU! PLEASE DO NOT MISPRONOUNCE
THE NAME OF MY MONEY MAKER.

325
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,875

NATURAL MONOUNSATURATED

327
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,916
AND POLYUNSATURATED NUTRIENTS
MELT THE POUNDS AWAY.

328
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,083
- EXCUSE ME.

329
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,333
- EVEN ITS CREATION IS A
DELICATE PROCESS.

330
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,500
FOR THREE WHOLE DAYS,

331
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,458
WE SOAK IT
IN A SECRET HERBAL SOLVENT,

332
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,916
AND THEN SUN-DRY IT FOR A WEEK
SO IT'S BURSTING WITH FLAVOR.

333
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,958
AND THE RESULT IS--
SAY IT RIGHT!

334
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,833
- THE MIRACULOUS DIET FOOD
METAMO-CHAN, MA'AM.

335
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:42,083
- GOOD GOOD.  SUPER JOB,
MY BABY BLUE FELINE FRIEND.

336
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,416
IN FACT, YOU DID SO GOOD
I'M GIVING YOU A SAMPLE,

337
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,500
COMPLETELY FREE. - BUT I'M NOT
OBESE, AND I ONLY EAT FISH--

338
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,541
YES, YES.  IT HAPPENS TO COME
IN FISH FLAVOR.

339
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,833
TAKE ONE BITE AND YOUR SKIN
WILL BE SILKY SMOOTH.

340
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:54,041
TAKE TWO BITES
AND YOU'LL BE AS SLIM AS ME.

341
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,708
AND YOU MUST BE HIS BROTHER
AND SISTERS. RIGHT RIGHT.

342
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,625
HAVE SOME FOR YOURSELVES,
ON THE HOUSE.

343
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,500
TAKE THE PLUNGE AND LIVE
THE DREAM OF ABSOLUTE BEAUTY.

344
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,166
DON'T BELIEVE ME?
SEE THE RESULTS FOR YOURSELF.

345
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,791
IT'S A MIRACLE.
- All: AMAZING!  WOW!

346
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,708
- I WANNA TRY SOME.
- WHAT?  WAIT.

347
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,500
YOU'RE ACTUALLY
BUYING INTO THIS?

348
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,833
- IF YOU'RE STILL NOT CONVINCED
THIS IS RIGHT FOR YOU,

349
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,958
LISTEN TO REAL TESTIMONIALS
FROM REAL CUSTOMERS.

350
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,958
"METAMO-CHAN HAS
COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED ME,

351
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,958
JUST LIKE YOU SAID IT WOULD."
- WAIT A MINUTE.

352
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,583
- "10 DAYS LATER, AND I AM SLIM
AND GORGEOUS." - STOP TALKING.

353
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,291
- "DIET SPELLS ARE OUT FOR ME,
IT'S METAMO-CHAN OR BUST."

354
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,958
- YES YES, AND THE SUCCESS
LETTERS KEEP POURING IN

355
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,708
FROM ALL OVER FIORE
AND THE FAR REACHES OF THE WOR--

356
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,083
- QUIT SAYING "YES YES"!
- YES YES, OF COURSE, SIR.

357
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,208
YOU INTERESTED IN SIGNING UP FOR
THE "I BEAT OBESITY" NEWSLETTER?

358
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,208
- NO NO! I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN YOUR DUMB LETTERS,

359
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,333
YOUR OBESITY
OR YOUR FISHY DIET KABOB.

360
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,416
- A KABOB
SOUNDS LIKE A SUPER IDEA.

361
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,000
YOU WANT TO
BECOME BUSINESS PARTNERS?

362
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,916
- I'M ONLY INTERESTED
IN DRAGONS.

363
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,791
- YES YES,
EVERYONE HAS A PREFERENCE.

364
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,625
YOU WON'T FIND JUDGMENT HERE.

365
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,541
HOW MANY POUNDS DOES YOUR
"DRAGON" FRIEND WANNA SHED?

366
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,250
WE COULD WORK OUT
A DIET PLAN.

367
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,958
- WILL YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH
FOR FIVE SECONDS?!

368
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,958
I'M A DRAGON SLAYER
FROM FAIRY TAIL.

369
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:57,375
I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR A DRAGON
NAMED IGNEEL WHO DISAPPEARED.

370
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,458
MY FRIEND HERE HAS ALSO BEEN
SEARCHING FOR ONE TOO--

371
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,708
THE SKY DRAGON, GRANDEENA.

372
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,375
WE HEARD A RUMOR
THAT YOU RECENTLY MET ONE.

373
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,583
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
WE'RE HERE, ALL RIGHT?

374
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,000
SO IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING,
TELL US WHAT IT IS.

375
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,791
WE NEED YOUR HELP.

376
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:17,458
- HMM. STRANGE THAT HE
WOULD ATTACK THEN RETREAT.

377
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,500
- HE WAS LETTING ME KNOW
THAT HE'S OUT THERE

378
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,791
AND CAN ATTACK US
WHENEVER HE CHOOSES.

379
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,166
ALSO THERE WAS SOMETHING ODD
ABOUT HIM.

380
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,875
THE ONLY WAY I CAN PUT IT
IS THAT HE SMELLED WRONG.

381
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,791
- SMELLED WRONG?

382
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:32,333
- NOT LIKE A PERSON,
MORE LIKE A WILD ANIMAL.

383
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,583
EVEN THE WAY HE BREATHED
WAS UNNATURAL.

384
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,041
- SOUNDS TO ME LIKE ANOTHER
DARK GUILD OUT THERE

385
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,625
NEEDS A MANLY KICK
IN THE PANTS.

386
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,500
- WE'LL BE CAUTIOUS,
BUT NOT OVERLY SO.

387
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,458
I'M SURE
WE'LL SEE HIM AGAIN.

388
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,666
- ARE WE TO JUST SIT BACK
AND DO NOTHING THEN?

389
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,083
- THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE'LL DO FOR NOW.

390
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,916
WE'D WASTE RESOURCES OTHERWISE.

391
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,166
PROCEED AS IF NOTHING
HAS HAPPENED.

392
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,250
THAT SHOULD PROVOKE HIM
INTO REVEALING HIMSELF

393
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,000
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.

394
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,500
- RIGHT.
- DON'T WORRY.

395
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,250
WE'LL PAY THIS GUY BACK,
PLUS INTEREST.

396
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,291
GRAY AND I ARE WITH YOU.

397
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,791
WHAT THE HECK?
WHERE'D HE GO?

398
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,416
- MY BELOVED HAS RUN OFF
WITHOUT TELLING ME

399
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,250
WHERE HE'S GONE
OR WHAT HE'S DOING.

400
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,000
DOESN'T HE CARE ABOUT MY
FEELINGS? - ON A JOB?!

401
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,208
- I DON'T KNOW!

402
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,666
- ( bird squawking )

403
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,708
- YES YES, I DID SAY
THAT I MET WITH A DRAGON.

404
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,708
BUT THAT WAS A JUST A FIB
FOR MARKETING.

405
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,041
SORRY.
- YOU LIED?

406
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,750
- THAT'S TOO BAD.
- AND THE WINNER IS GAJEEL!

407
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,333
- I HAD A FEELING THIS
WOULD JUST BE A WASTE OF TIME.

408
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,291
- YES YES.
METAMO-CHAN WORKS SO WELL

409
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,250
'CAUSE OF
THE PRIMARY INGREDIENT,

410
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,250
WHICH HAPPENS TO BE
POWDERED DRAGON SCALES.

411
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,125
WITHOUT 'EM, IT WOULD BE A
COMPLETE FLOP. - DRAGON SCALES?

412
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,208
- YES YES, INDEED.
OF COURSE, THAT'S A LIE TOO.

413
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,041
THOSE ARE IMPOSSIBLE
TO OBTAIN.

414
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,750
- YOU MEAN METAMO-CHAN
DOESN'T WORK?

415
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,333
- BINGO, DARLIN'!

416
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,083
A WELL-CRAFTED SCAM,
IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF.

417
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,875
- UNBELIEVABLE.
SHAMELESS!

418
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:49,125
- YES YES.  A GIRL'S GOTTA
MAKE A LIVING SOMEHOW.

419
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,208
I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND,
DRAGON BOY.

420
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,041
- I UNDERSTAND YOU SUCK!
WE'RE LEAVING.

421
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,416
AH!

422
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,083
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!

423
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,416
- WHY IS THE HALLWAY MELTING?!

424
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,375
- HOW DOES
A WHOLE BUILDING VANISH?

425
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:08,208
- YOU'RE ALL MINE NOW,
BIRDS IN A CAGE.

426
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,208
- WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

427
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,833
FIRE DRAGON IRON FIST!

428
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,208
- OH NO!
- NATSU, ARE YOU OKAY?

429
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,083
- IT'S SOME KIND OF MAGIC WALL.

430
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,625
YOU'RE REALLY A WIZARD,
AREN'T YOU?

431
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,541
- ( laughs )
YES YES.

432
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,583
QUITE A DISPLAY, SALAMANDER.

433
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,958
IF ANYTHING, YOU LIVE UP
TO YOUR REPUTATION.

434
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,583
- SHE'S KIND OF SCARY
WITHOUT HER TWANG.

435
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,791
- I'M SO GLAD THAT ALL OF YOU
COULD MAKE IT.

436
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,291
GOOD THINGS REALLY DO COME
TO THOSE WHO WAIT.

437
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,250
- THIS WAS JUST A SET-UP.

438
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,750
- YES YES YES!
AND YOU FELL RIGHT IN IT!

439
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,875
SO SIT BACK AND HAVE SOME
METAMO-CHAN.

440
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,125
- WHY WOULD I WANT THAT?

441
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,250
- PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE
THE STRAWBERRY FLAVOR?

442
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,791
- THERE'S ALSO WASABI
AND TERIYAKI. - I SAID NO!

443
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,291
- WE CAN'T GO OUT HERE EITHER.

444
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,750
- SEEMS THIS TRAP
WAS MASTERFULLY CRAFTED.

445
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,958
- YES YES YES.
MY MAGIC IS QUITE SPLENDID.

446
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:57,458
- I'VE NEVER MET A WALL
I COULDN'T BRING DOWN BY FORCE.

447
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:00,291
AHHH!

448
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,000
- AH!  NATSU!

449
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,916
- WHAT THE--

450
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,041
- HOW'S THE FLOOR FEEL,
NATSU?

451
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,875
- OH, IT'S GRAY!
- WAIT.

452
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,208
HOW WERE YOU ABLE TO GET PAST
THAT MAGIC WALL?

453
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,708
- GOOD QUESTION.

454
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,791
AND I'VE GOT MY OWN BONE
TO PICK WITH YOU.

455
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,166
NEXT TIME MAKE SURE YOUR INFO
ISN'T COMPLETE GARBAGE.

456
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,416
- HMMM.
IT WASN'T GARBAGE.

457
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,083
YOU DID JUST WE WANTED.

458
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,625
- YES YES YES, THEY DID.

459
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:34,125
SO GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT,
MY BELOVED GRAY.

460
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:38,208
- YOU KNOW HER?
WHAT IS GOING ON, MAN?

461
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,625
- ( laughs )

462
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,041
- WHOA!
I THINK THEY'RE IN LOVE!

463
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,166
- YOU'RE REALLY SLUMMIN' IT
IF YOU'RE WITH THIS CHICK.

464
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,958
- SHUT UP.

465
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,000
IF YOU DIDN'T THINK
THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN ONE DAY,

466
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,250
YOU'RE EVEN DUMBER THAN I
THOUGHT. - WHAT WAS THAT?

467
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,000
- IT'S TIME FOR YOU AND ME

468
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:56,625
TO SETTLE THIS LITTLE RIVALRY
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

469
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,750
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?
- JEEZ, YOU'RE SLOW.

470
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,666
I'M SAYIN' I'M TIRED
OF ALWAYS FOLLOWING YOUR LEAD.

471
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,333
NOW I'LL FOLLOW
MY OWN PATH.

472
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:08,541
AS OF THIS MOMENT,
I'M THROUGH WITH FAIRY TAIL.

473
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,916
AND I'M THROUGH
WITH ALL OF YOU.

474
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,125
- YOU'RE SERIOUS?
- YES YES.

475
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,833
THAT'S WHAT I CALL A MAN.

476
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,291
MY DARLING ICE-CUBE REALLY KNOWS
HOW TO WARM ME UP.

477
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:21,041
NOW BE A DEAR AND FETCH ME
A DRAGON SLAYER,

478
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,291
WOULD YOU?

479
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:26,458
- YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS,
GRAY.

480
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:29,916
- IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT,
STAY THERE.

481
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,958
IT'LL BE MUCH EASIER
TO END YOU!

482
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:38,750
- ( end theme playing )

483
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:52,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

484
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,625
- Happy: WHO DO YOU THINK
WOULD WIN IN A FIGHT?

485
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,916
- YOU OR GRAY? 
- Natsu: ME, OF COURSE.

486
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,875
THERE'S NO WAY
SIR STRIPS-A-LOT'S

487
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,125
GONNA BRING ME DOWN.

488
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,875
- REALLY? 'CAUSE HE JUST
SAID, "THERE'S NO WAY

489
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:23,125
THAT PINK-HAIRED FLAME MUNCHER
WILL EVER BEAT ME."

490
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:25,833
- SAY WHAT? IT'S NOT PINK,
IT'S LIGHTISH RED.

491
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:28,500
THAT NO GOOD, BOXER DROPPING,
POPSICLE SHOVING, FREAK SHOW!

492
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,666
- IT'S NOT AN INSULT CONTEST.

493
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,250
- ( Happy and Natsu speaking )

494
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,333
- Happy: THE SIZE OF THE INSULT
DOESN'T MATTER.

495
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:37,500
REMEMBER,
BREVITY IS THE SOUL OF WIT.

496
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:39,166
- Natsu: HE STINKS!

497
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,875
- WELL, I GUESS IT WAS
PRETTY BRIEF, AT LEAST.
