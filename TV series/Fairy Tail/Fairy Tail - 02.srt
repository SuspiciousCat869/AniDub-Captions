MERELY A TOOL,

A MUNDANE PART
OF EVERYDAY LIFE.

9

THIS TIME THEY'VE DESTROYED
AN ENTIRE PORT.

33
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,833
- WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH THEM?

34
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,041

OF THOSE DIMWITS

35
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,708
AND THEIR LAISSEZ-FAIRE
ATTITUDE.

36
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,875
- HMM.  THEY MAY
BEHAVE LIKE FOOLS,

37
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,875
BUT WE MUSTN'T FORGET
THEY ARE ALSO

LEAVE THEM BE.

AFTER ALL, IF IT
WASN'T FOR THOSE FOOLS

42

THINK HOW BORING
THIS WORLD WOULD BE.

156
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,750
THE MAGIC COUNCIL 
SENT ME THIS TIME.

157
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,000
THIS IS THE BIGGEST
PILE OF COMPLAINTS YET.

158
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,083
- Narrator:
REMEMBER THE MAGIC COUNCIL?

159
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,833
WELL, THEY MONITOR ALL OF
THE DIFFERENT WIZARD GUILDS.

160
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,666
- HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MINDS?!

161
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,291
ALL YOU KIDS ARE GOOD FOR

162
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,000
IS GETTING THE HIGHER-UPS
MAD AT ME.

163
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,291
- ( all murmur )

164
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,791
- ( groans )

165
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,250
- ( exhales )

166
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,000
- HOWEVER...

167
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,541
I SAY TO HECK WITH
THE MAGIC COUNCIL.

168
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,750
( chuckles )

169
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,208
- ( gasps )
- Makarov: NOW LISTEN UP.

170
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,708
ANY POWER THAT SURPASSES REASON

171
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,541
STILL COMES FROM REASON,
RIGHT?

172
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,500
MAGIC ISN'T SOME KIND OF
MIRACULOUS POWER.

173
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,791
IT IS A TALENT 
THAT ONLY WORKS

174
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,875
WHEN THE FLOW OF ENERGY
INSIDE OF US

175
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,166
AND THE FLOW OF ENERGY
IN THE NATURAL WORLD

176
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,083
ARE IN PERFECT
SYNCHRONIZATION.

177
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:55,541
TO PERFORM MAGIC,
ONE MUST HAVE A STRONG MIND

178
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,166
AND THE ABILITY TO FOCUS.

179
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,666
IT SHOULD TAKE OVER
YOUR BEING

180
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,666
AND COME POURING 
OUT OF YOUR SOUL.

181
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,083
IF ALL WE DO IS WORRY 
ABOUT FOLLOWING RULES,

182
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,875
THEN OUR MAGIC
WILL NEVER PROGRESS.

183
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,916
DON'T LET THOSE BLOWHARDS
ON THE COUNCIL SCARE YOU.

184
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,875
FOLLOW THE PATH
YOU BELIEVE IN.

185
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,500
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT MAKES
THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD

186
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,166
NUMBER ONE!
- ( cheering )

187
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,583
- YEAH!

188
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,875
- ( laughs )

189
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:22,916
- ( cuckoo clock ticking )

190
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,958
- AND THEN...

191
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,916
- THERE. NOW YOU'RE AN OFFICIAL
MEMBER OF THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD.

192
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,208
- ( gasps, squeals )

193
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,000
HEY, NATSU, LOOK.

194
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,750
MIRAJANE JUST PUT THE OFFICIAL
FAIRY TAIL MARK ON MY HAND!

195
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,166
- OH YEAH?  THAT'S COOL.
WELCOME TO THE GUILD, LOONY.

196
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,791
- THE NAME'S LUCY!

197
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,708
- Narrator:
THIS IS THE REQUEST BOARD.

198
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,791
THE WIZARDS CAN PICK
FROM ANY OF THE JOBS

199
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,208
LISTED ON THE BOARD.

200
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,708
EACH PRESENTS
A UNIQUE CHALLENGE,

201
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,375
AND A DIFFERENT PAY RATE.

202
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,583
- MAKE SURE YOU PICK ONE 
WITH A BIG REWARD, NATSU.

203
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,375
- WHOA, 160,000 JEWEL
TO GET RID OF SOME THIEVES?

204
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,958
- Happy:
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME!

205
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,958
- Romeo: HOW COME MY DAD
HASN'T COME BACK YET?

206
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,375
- Makarov: YOU'RE STARTING
TO WORK MY NERVES, ROMEO. 

207
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,250
YOU'RE A WIZARD, SON.
HAVE FAITH IN YOUR FATHER

208
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,000
AND WAIT PATIENTLY FOR HIM.

209
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:07,291
- BUT SIR, HE TOLD ME
HE'D BE BACK IN THREE DAYS.

210
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,791
AND HE'S BEEN GONE
FOR OVER A WEEK NOW!

211
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:13,208
- IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,
HE TOOK THE JOB ON MOUNT HAKOBE.

212
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,958
- THAT'S RIGHT.
AND IT'S NOT THAT FAR FROM HERE,

213
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,833
SO WHY WON'T SOMEBODY
GO LOOK FOR HIM?

214
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,958
- LISTEN, KID,
YOUR OLD MAN'S A WIZARD.

215
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,000
AND LIKE EVERY OTHER 
WIZARD IN THIS GUILD,

216
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,833
HE CAN TAKE CARE
OF HIMSELF.

217
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,583
NOW GO HOME,
HAVE SOME MILK AND COOKIES,

218
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,916
AND WAIT!

219
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,250
- JERK!

220
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,250
- ( crashing )

221
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,333
- I HATE YOU ALL!

222
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,416
- THAT'S GOTTA BE TOUGH.

223
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,833
- I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE 
THE MASTER DOESN'T CARE,

224
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,166
BUT HE REALLY IS WORRIED.
- ( crashing )

225
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,083
- Nab: WHAT DO YOU 
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

226
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,041
YOU ALMOST BROKE 
THE BOARD, NATSU.

227
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,958
- ( sighs )

228
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,666
- THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD,
MASTER.

229
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,416
YOU KNOW HOW HE CAN BE.

230
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,000
I BET HE'S GOING UP
TO MOUNT HAKOBE TO SAVE MACAO.

231
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,833
- WHEN IS THAT KID 
EVER GONNA GROW UP?

232
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,166
- WHO KNOWS?
GOING AFTER MACAO

233
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,333
ISN'T GONNA DO ANYTHING
EXCEPT HURT HIS PRIDE. 

234
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,250
- REMEMBER NAB,

235
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,458
WE CAN'T CHOOSE
ANOTHER'S PATH.

236
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,875
JUST LEAVE HIM BE.

237
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,458
- WHY DID NATSU
GET SO UPSET?

238
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:11,458
- PROBABLY BECAUSE HE AND
ROMEO HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

239
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,666
I THINK HE SEES
HIMSELF IN ROMEO.

240
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:20,208
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE
MEMBERS OF FAIRY TAIL,

241
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:23,041
IT DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE 
OUR OWN PERSONAL ISSUES.

242
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:27,000
WE'VE ALL HAD OUR FAIR SHARE
OF SUFFERING AND LOSS.

243
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,875
- ( horse neighs )

244
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,375
- Natsu: ( groans )
WHY'D YOU COME WITH US?

245
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,375
- Lucy:
I THOUGHT MAYBE I COULD HELP.

246
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,625
WOW, YOU REALLY DO HAVE
A SERIOUS CASE

247
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,291
OF MOTION SICKNESS,
DON'T YOU?

248
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,041
IT'S JUST ANOTHER REASON
TO FEEL SORRY FOR YOU.

249
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,750
- Natsu:
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?!

250
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,041
- Lucy: OH, NOTHING.
FORGET I SAID ANYTHING.

251
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,833
- Mirajane: MANY YEARS AGO,
NATSU'S FATHER LEFT

252
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,083
AND NEVER CAME BACK.
- ( gasps )

253
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,500
- WELL, TECHNICALLY
IT WASN'T HIS REAL FATHER,

254
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,083
BUT THE ONE WHO RAISED HIM.
HE WAS ACTUALLY A DRAGON.

255
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,916
- ( roars )

256
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,208
- ( gasps )
HE WAS A WHAT?!

257
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,791
NATSU WAS REALLY
RAISED BY A DRAGON?

258
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,250
- Mirajane:
WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY,

259
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,666
A DRAGON FOUND HIM
WANDERING THE FOREST.

260
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,250
HE TOOK HIM IN AND TAUGHT HIM
ALL ABOUT LANGUAGE,

261
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,625
CULTURE, AND MAGIC.

262
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,083
BUT ONE DAY,
THE DRAGON DISAPPEARED

263
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,416
AND NEVER RETURNED.

264
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,375
- Lucy: SO THAT DRAGON
MUST HAVE BEEN IGNEEL.

265
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,958
- Mirajane: THAT'S RIGHT.

266
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,375
AND NATSU LIVES FOR THE DAY

267
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,833
WHEN HE'LL FINALLY
SEE IGNEEL AGAIN. 

268
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:35,375
IT'S KIND OF CUTE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

269
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,875
- I GUESS WE'RE THERE.

270
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,083
- ALL RIGHT!
WE'VE STOPPED MOVING!

271
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,666
- Driver: I'M SORRY, BUT THIS
IS AS FAR AS I CAN G ET YOU.

272
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,083
- WHOA!
- WHERE THE HECK ARE WE, NATSU?

273
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,875
IT'S A FROZEN WASTELAND!

274
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,958
- WHY IS IT SO COLD?
I KNOW WE'RE ON A MOUNTAIN,

275
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,875
BUT IT'S SUMMER RIGHT NOW.
THERE SHOULDN'T BE A BLIZZARD

276
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,583
LIKE THIS ANYWHERE!
- THAT'S WHAT YOU GET

277
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,083
FOR WEARING LIGHT CLOTHING.

278
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,833
- OH, PLEASE!
YOU'RE NOT DRESSED FOR IT.

279
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,750
NOW HAND OVER THAT BLANKET!

280
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,750
- GOSH, SHE JUST
KEEPS ON TALKING, HUH?

281
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,833
- AYE.
- OH, I KNOW.

282
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,958
OPEN GATE OF THE CLOCK
CONSTELLATION!

283
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,000
HOROLOGIUM!

284
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,375
- TICK, TOCK.

285
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,000
- A CLOCK, WHOA.

286
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,541
- THAT IS SO COOL.

287
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,750
- WAIT, I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

288
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,625
- SHE SAYS
"I'M STAYING IN HERE,

289
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,208
AND I'M NOT COMING OUT."

290
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,791
- THEN WHY'D YOU TAG ALONG?

291
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,041
- "WHAT KIND OF CRAZY JOB
WOULD FORCE MACAO

292
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,625
TO COME TO A PLACE LIKE THIS?"
SHE INQUIRES.

293
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,208
- YOU SHOULD HAVE ASKED THAT
BEFORE YOU CAME WITH US.

294
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,416
HE WENT TO SLAY A VULCAN.
IT'S A BIG MONSTER.

295
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,708
- ( gasps )

296
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,625
- "I WANT TO GO BACK
TO THE GUILD,"

297
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,041
SHE PROCLAIMS.
- GO AHEAD AND BE MY GUEST,

298
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,666
I SAY BACK.
- AYE.

299
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,208
- MACAO!
WHERE ARE YOU?!

300
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,833
- MACAO!

301
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,625
- ( grunts )
- ( screams )

302
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,250
- ( chuckles )

303
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,333
- THAT'S A BIG VULCAN!

304
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,208
- HUH?
( snorts )

305
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,625
( chuckles )
- HEY, WAIT!

306
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,916
- ( knocking )
- ( gasps )

307
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,541
- ME LIKE HUMAN WOMAN.

308
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,208
- SO IT CAN TALK, HUH?

309
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,666
- "DON'T JUST STAND THERE.

310
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,000
HURRY UP AND SAVE ME,"

311
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,583
SHE YELLS FURIOUSLY.
- ( giggles )

312
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,791
- Narrator: NEAR THE SUMMIT
OF MOUNT HAKOBE...

313
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,666
- ( Vulcan grunting )

314
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,000
- "HOW DID I GET MYSELF
INTO THIS MESS.

315
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,083
AND WHAT'S WITH
THIS GIANT MONKEY?

316
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:56,166
WHY IS HE SO EXCITED?"
SHE ASKS TEARFULLY.

317
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,666
- WOMAN.

318
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,458
- ( whimpers )

319
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,583
- ( sighs )

320
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,916
- ( gasps )
WHERE'D YOU GO, HOROLOGIUM?

321
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,291
DON'T YOU DISAPPEAR ON ME!

322
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,125
- Horologium: SORRY,
BUT MY TIME IS UP.

323
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:10,416
TAKE CARE.
- GIVE ME AN EXTENSION, PLEASE!

324
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,791
- ( laughs )
- ( screams )

325
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:16,083
- HEY, YOU BIG APE!
WHERE'S MACAO?!

326
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,458
TELL ME!

327
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,833
WHOA!
( grunts )

328
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,875
- HMM?
- OHH...

329
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,875
WHOA.
THAT WASN'T COOL.

330
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,291
WHY DOES HE FEEL LIKE HE HAS TO
MAKE AN ENTRANCE ALL THE TIME? 

331
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,791
- SPILL IT, MONKEY.
WHERE IS MY FRIEND?

332
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,708
- HUH?
- ( grunts )

333
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,291
YOU UNDERSTAND ME, RIGHT?

334
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,958
HE'S A HUMAN MAN.
NOW TELL ME WHERE HE IS.

335
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,708
- MAN?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

336
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,625
WHERE ARE YOU HIDING HIM?

337
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,958
- DON'T YOU THINK YOU MIGHT
BE JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS? 

338
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,583
- MAN! - HEY, I THINK
HE'S GONNA SHOW ME.

339
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,916
MACAO!
( grunts )

340
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,291
MONKEY!

341
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,916
- NATSU! - NO LIKE MAN.
ME LIKE WOMAN!

342
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,333
( whooping )
- THIS IS BAD NEWS.

343
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,041
HE CAN'T SURVIVE OUT THERE.

344
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:01,166
NATSU!
- WOMAN.

345
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,333
WOMAN WOMAN WOMAN
WOMAN WOMAN.

346
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,666
( chuckles )
- ALL RIGHT, YOU PERVY MONKEY,

347
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,875
YOU'RE GOING DOWN.

348
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,708
OPEN, GATE OF THE GOLDEN BULL!

349
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,041
TAURUS!

350
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,125
- ( growls )

351
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:26,083
- COW?
- I SHOULD WARN YOU, MONKEY BOY,

352
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,166
TAURUS IS THE MOST POWERFUL
CELESTIAL SPIRIT

353
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,083
THAT I HAVE A CONTRACT WITH.
- OH, WOW, MISS LUCY.

354
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,166
I ALMOST FORGOT WHAT
A NICE FIGURE YOU HAVE.

355
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,833
WHY DON'T YOU COME
GIVE ME A SMOOCH? 

356
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,958
- OH YEAH, AND HE'S
A BIG PERV TOO.

357
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,875
- NO TOUCH MY WOMAN!

358
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,333
- YOUR WOMAN?

359
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:44,250
THEM'S FIGHTING WORDS,
YOU MOO-NKEY!

360
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,208
- GET HIM!

361
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,333
- ( shouts )

362
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,833
- HE'S FAST.
- ( grunts )

363
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,958
- AAH!

364
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,916
- NATSU!
- AAH!

365
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,958
LOOKS LIKE THIS IS
THE END FOR ME.

366
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,875
- EPIC FAIL.
- HEY.

367
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,291
SO HOW COME THERE ARE MORE
MONSTERS NOW THAN WHEN I LEFT?

368
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,375
- HE'S A FRIEND, DUMMY!
ONE OF MY SPIRITS!

369
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,791
- THAT GUY?
- NOT HIM!  THE BULL.

370
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,875
WAIT A MINUTE, HOW WERE YOU
ABLE TO SURVIVE OUT THERE?

371
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,166
- ( chuckles )
HAPPY CAME TO SAVE ME.

372
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,166
THANKS, LITTLE BUDDY.

373
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,916
- AYE!

374
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,666
- SO YOU CAN'T HANDLE
OTHER MODES OF TRANSPORTATION,

375
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,083
BUT FLYING WITH HAPPY'S OKAY?

376
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,500
- WHAT KIND OF STUPID
QUESTION IS THAT?

377
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,916
HAPPY ISN'T A MODE
OF TRANSPORTATION.

378
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,666
HE'S MY FRIEND.
I MEAN, DUH.

379
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,500
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT WAS TOTALLY WRONG OF ME

380
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,166
TO COMPARE THE TWO.
- ( sighs )

381
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,833
MY WOMAN!

382
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,208
( growls )

383
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,500
- YOU LISTEN UP.

384
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,041
I CONSIDER EVERYONE IN
THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD MY FRIEND.

385
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,125
- ( grunts )

386
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,916
- WHETHER IT'S GRAMPS AND MIRA,

387
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,416
OR EVEN THOSE ANNOYING JERKS
GRAY AND ELFMAN.

388
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,375
- ( gasps )

389
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:01,250
- HAPPY AND LUCY TOO.
THEY'RE ALL MY FRIENDS.

390
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,041
WHICH IS WHY...
- ( shouts )

391
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:10,000
- ...I'M NOT LEAVING
WITHOUT MACAO!

392
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,833
- ( growls )

393
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:22,875
- AAH! - YOUR ICE ATTACK
HAS NO EFFECT ON FIRE.

394
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,208
- ( chuckles )

395
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,375
- THAT'S NOT GOOD.

396
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,708
- HE GOT TAURUS'S AXE.

397
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,916
- PLEASE, BE CAREFUL,
MISS LUCY.

398
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,458
- ( grunts )

399
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,875
- AAH!
( grunts )

400
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:38,958
- NO!

401
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,333
- ( growls )

402
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,500
- GO BACK, TAURUS.

403
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,750
IF YOU GO BACK
BEYOND THE GATE,

404
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,458
YOUR AXE WILL DISAPPEAR TOO.

405
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:50,166
- ( straining )

406
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,416
- HUH?

407
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,666
- IS HE MELTING THE BLADE
WITH JUST HIS BODY HEAT? 

408
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,125
- UH-HUH.

409
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,416
- OH YEAH, NOW I GOT
SOME FIRE IN MY BELLY.

410
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,458
- ( whimpers )

411
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,041
AAH!

412
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:10,750
- EAT THIS!

413
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,208
FIRE DRAGON IRON FIST!

414
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,416
- ( moans )

415
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,166
- WE BEAT HIM!

416
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,958
- YEAH, BUT WASN'T THIS MONKEY
SUPPOSED TO TELL US

417
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,375
WHERE YOUR FRIEND IS?

418
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,500
- OH. ( chuckles )
FORGOT ABOUT THAT.

419
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,083
- WELL, I DON'T THINK
HE'S GONNA DO MUCH TALKING.

420
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,083
( yelps )

421
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,166
- WHAT IN THE HECK
WAS THAT?

422
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,958
( gasps )
MACAO?

423
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,875
- ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT BIG PERVERTED MONKEY

424
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,166
WAS ACTUALLY YOUR FRIEND
THIS WHOLE TIME?!

425
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,791
- YEAH, HE MUST HAVE BEEN 
TAKEN OVER BY THAT VULCAN.

426
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,375
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"TAKEN OVER"?

427
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,958
- IT MUST HAVE USED
A POSSESSION SPELL ON HIM.

428
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,541
YOU SEE, VULCANS SURVIVE
BY STEALING PEOPLE'S BODIES

429
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,958
AND TAKING THEM OVER.

430
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,541
THEY'RE EVIL BODY SNATCHERS.

431
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,083
- ( laughs )

432
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,958
- IT LOOKS LIKE
HE PUT UP A GOOD FIGHT

433
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,416
BEFORE THAT VULCAN
FINALLY GOT TO HIM THOUGH.

434
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,000
- MACAO,
DON'T YOU DIE ON ME.

435
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,583
ROMEO'S WAITING FOR YOU.
OPEN YOUR EYES!

436
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,000
- ( sighs )

437
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,625
NATSU?

438
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,250
- YOU'RE OKAY.
- ( chuckles )

439
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,916
- I'M SO PATHETIC.

440
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,875
I DEFEATED 19 OF THOSE BRUTES.
- HUH?

441
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:23,583
- BUT THE 20TH,
THAT'S THE ONE THAT GOT ME.

442
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,833
I'M SO ANGRY WITH MYSELF.

443
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,416
I'M EMBARRASSED
TO GO HOME AND FACE ROMEO.

444
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,000
- DON'T BE LIKE THAT.
COME ON, MAN.

445
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,000
YOU BEAT 19 MONSTERS.

446
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:35,416
- NO WAY.  THERE WERE 20 OF
THOSE GIANT MONKEY THINGS? 

447
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,375
AND HE TOOK ON THE JOB
ALL BY HIMSELF?

448
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,125
- NOW LET'S GO HOME.

449
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,875
YOUR LITTLE BOY'S
BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

450
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,541
- ( chuckles )

451
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,875
- THEY'RE AMAZING.

452
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,541
I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN 
TO COMPARE TO THEM.

453
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,625
- WHY ARE YOU GRINNING
LIKE THAT, LUCY?

454
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,958
IT'S CREEPY.
- I'LL SHOW YOU CREEPY.

455
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,208
WATCH YOUR BACK.

456
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,208
- FAIRY TAIL WIZARDS
ARE A JOKE, ROMEO.

457
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:06,625
- YEAH, EVERYBODY KNOWS THEY'RE
JUST A BUNCH OF DRUNKEN COWARDS.

458
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:07,875
- I'M GONNA BE A KNIGHT
WHEN I GROW UP.

459
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,541
NOT SOME DUMB WIZARD.

460
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,875
- YEAH, THEY'RE DIRTY
AND THEY SMELL LIKE BOOZE.

461
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,791
- PLEASE, DAD.

462
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,791
GO TO THE BOARD
AND TAKE A JOB.

463
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,208
I CAN'T HANDLE ALL
THIS TEASING ANYMORE.

464
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,291
- ( chuckles )
SURE.

465
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,375
- ( sniffles )

466
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,250
