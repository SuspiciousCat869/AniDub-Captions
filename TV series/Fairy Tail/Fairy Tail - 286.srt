1
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,625
Really? Come on!

2
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:23,666
[ERZA] However, my feelings
as a fellow member

3
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,375
of the guild are different.

4
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:30,083
We have no other choice but to
bring Makarov home, and quickly.

5
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,500
Which means,

6
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:34,416
only those in this room
will join the mission.

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,458
A small team works best.

8
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:42,625
We'll infiltrate Alvarez, rescue
our master, and make our escape.

9
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:45,125
This will not be an all-out war.

10
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:48,125
Hear me? We need focus.

11
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:52,291
That means we won't be starting
any unnecessary fights.

12
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,708
Am I clear?

13
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,958
Yeah, sure.

14
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:59,583
Let's do it you guys!
Gramps is counting on us!

15
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,416
[JURA] All the paperwork
looks to be in order.

16
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,083
Erza Scarlet as guild master.


17
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,833
Excellent choice, indeed.


18
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:46,375
So that means it's official now!
Fairy Tail is a guild again!

19
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,958
[JURA]
Mh-hm.

20
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,916
Let's hope that we'll have more
good news with Makarov's return.

21
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,250
[gasps]

22
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,625
Yeah.

23
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,833
This is bittersweet.

24
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,666
You've been a great
help to the council.

25
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,041
We will miss your
diligence and dedication.

26
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,250
[LEVY]
Aw, thank you.

27
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:07,000
Warrod, you seem to be
in a good mood today.

28
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,333
[WARROD]
Hmmm.

29
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,250
Well, I thought the guild
splitting up was a joke,

30
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:13,208
and this turn of events
proves my theory.

31
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,750
[WARROD]
If they can pull off Mest's plan


32
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:18,583
of rescuing Mockarov,
that will make me truly happy.


33
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:19,791
[LEVY]
Warrod, sir.

34
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,375
Excuse me, but you're
spilling your water!

35
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,833
[WARROD]
Hmm?

36
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:27,000
Actually, I'm just taking a
moment to relieve myself.

37
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,250
Don't worry, I'm only
joking, of course.

38
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,791
[LEVY groans]

39
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:34,625
[WOLFHEIM] You think this is an
appropriate time for jokes?

40
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:38,166
These are dangerous times
that we're living in, old man.


41
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,625
Wolfheim, you're here too?
I couldn't sense you at all.

42
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:42,916
Oh, wow.

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,666
He's one of the Four
Emperors of Ishgar, too.

44
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,291
It's always an appropriate
time for laughter.

45
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:51,291
In fact, hearing your name
always makes me guffaw.

46
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,625
[chuckles]

47
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,583
You know I'm only
playing around with you.

48
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:59,458
Well, I don't find it
the least bit funny!

49
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,125
Tensions are
continuing to escalate

50
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,625
between Ishgar and Alvarez,

51
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,291
and your idea of dealing with it

52
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,416
is watering plants and
cracking jokes, huh?

53
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,625
[LEVY whimpers]

54
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,916
Calm down, Wolfheim.
You'll scare our guest!

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,041
[HYBERION]
That's quite enough.

56
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,083
[chuckles]

57
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,541
[grunts]

58
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,166
[HYBERION] Our days of simply
acting as we please are over.


59
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,666
We are an august
body of leadership.


60
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:28,458
Our behavior needs to reflect
our position accordingly.


61
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,000
[LEVY] I can't believe
I'm in the same room

62
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:33,375
as three of the Four
Emperors of Ishgar.

63
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,625
As you said, tensions
are indeed running high.

64
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,375
But it is our duty
to bring the world

65
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,541
into an era of stability.

66
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:47,458
If a war erupted, our defeat
would be inevitable.

67
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,500
Which means the onus is upon us

68
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,875
to arrive at a
peaceful resolution.

69
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,208
You're saying the Alvarez
Empire is really that powerful?

70
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:58,833
I mean, we do have God
Serena fighting on our side!

71
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,958
God Serena shares our history.

72
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,000
Once a fellow Emperor of Ishgar,

73
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,791
and the highest ranking member
amongst the Wizard Saints.

74
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,916
In short, he's
rightly considered

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,458
to be the mightiest wizard
on the continent.

76
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:12,541
Yes, that's true.

77
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,208
So you should
understand my confusion

78
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,708
as to why he's not currently a
member of the Magic Council.

79
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,708
This makes me nervous.
Why is everyone so quiet?

80
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,208
I don't know.

81
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,958
I hope he hasn't been met
with some kind of misfortune.

82
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:32,083
[HYBERION] God Serena
has abandoned Ishgar.

83
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:36,541
He's traveled to Alakitasia and
sworn allegiance to Alvarez.

84
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:37,291
[BOTH gasp]

85
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,250
No! Really?

86
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,708
[HYBERION]
Their emperor, Spriggan,

87
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,875
has an elite personal guard,
the Spriggan Twelve.

88
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:47,166
Our former comrade
has joined their ranks.

89
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,375
[LEVY]
The Spriggan Twelve? Wait.

90
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,250
[HYBERION]
It's quite troubling.

91
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,666
And would indicate that there
are eleven others on par


92
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,958
with the most powerful
wizard from our continent.


93
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:01,250
That is the kind of
might Alvarez wields.

94
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:19,000
[NATSU]
We had to take a boat?

95
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,041
How'd you think we'd
cross the ocean?

96
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:25,166
[NATSU] I dunno, can't
Mest, like, zap us over?

97
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,250
Too far for my direct line.

98
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:32,083
Hey, Wendy, you have a
tummy spell, don't ya?

99
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,833
[NATSU, LUCY]
Aw, man!

100
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,333
I'm so sorry.

101
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,625
But I recently started
to get motion sickness

102
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,541
just like you, Natsu.

103
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,333
[LUCY]
You poor thing!

104
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,875
Unfortunately, Wendy
can't use her Troia magic

105
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,125
when she's in this state.

106
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,166
You think a fishie
would help her?

107
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,583
[GRAY]
All right, fine.

108
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,333
Let me carry ya to your bunks.

109
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,666
[NATSU, WENDY groaning]

110
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,041
Happy to help.

111
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,791
Where did all your clothes go?!

112
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:01,708
[GRAY]
Dunno.

113
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:02,583
[LUCY]
Hey! Stay away from me!

114
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:03,791
[GRAY]
Come on, Lucy!

115
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,625
Would ya calm down?
Help me find my shirt!

116
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,500
What's on your mind, Erza?

117
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,083
Sorry. Suppose I should
call you "master."

118
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,166
Erza is fine with me.

119
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,500
I was thinking
about our situation.

120
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,541
Makarov went as far as
disbanding the guild

121
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,000
to keep us safe.

122
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,291
And all this time, he's been
hiding the Lumen Histoire

123
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,750
from an outside force.

124
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,708
But what's perplexing

125
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,833
is why he felt he had to go
to such extreme lengths.

126
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,291
Perhaps if I knew what the
Lumen Histoire actually is,

127
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,208
I could make sense of it.

128
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,583
Honestly, I'm as in
the dark as you are.

129
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,250
But I believe it's
some kind of weapon.

130
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,250
I had heard a rumor about it.

131
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:47,750
That Gramps actually considered
activating it to stop the FACES.

132
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,166
I heard the same thing,

133
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,333
but for whatever reason,
he ultimately decided not to.

134
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:55,250
Are you saying that
if he did activate it,

135
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:59,083
it would be powerful enough to
counteract all of those FACES?

136
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,583
Crazy.

137
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:07,083
Maybe the biggest mystery...
is the first master's body.

138
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:10,083
Why is she in there,
and is she alive or dead?

139
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,583
Yes, it certainly is odd,

140
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,166
especially since
we've interacted

141
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,000
with projections of her
from time to time.

142
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,000
[GRAY] There're so many
unanswered questions.

143
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:21,166
Hopefully, Master Makarov will
shed more light on everything

144
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,791
once he's safe and sound.

145
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,916
[ERZA] How long will it
take us to get to Alvarez?

146
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,708
Let me think.

147
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:32,666
Sailing for ten days?
Then several more on land.

148
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,250
Quite a journey.

149
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:39,291
I'm worried about him as well,
but we can't be hasty.

150
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,000
We'll need to make a
stop on Caracol Island.

151
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:45,791
Stock up on provisions,
food and some other supplies.

152
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,833
A town not named after
a plant or flower.

153
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:52,000
That's one way to know
you're outside of Fiore.

154
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,833
[ERZA] Are you sure we really
have the time to make a stop?

155
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,583
[MEST]
I said we can't be hasty.

156
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,041
This kind of
infiltration mission

157
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,958
requires thorough preparation.

158
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,958
What do you mean by that?

159
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,500
Good intelligence.

160
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,750
We'll be meeting up with an
agent while we're there.

161
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,750
They'll tell us how we can
sneak into the Empire.

162
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,458
So you're positive that Laxus
is all the way out here?

163
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,166
Yep, according to my sources,

164
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,583
we should find him
and his toadies.

165
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,333
Wait, the Thunder Legion?

166
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:25,291
We know you came with us
to track down Evergreen.

167
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:28,125
What did I do to get stuck
on this team anyway?

168
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,208
It's not some kind
of punishment.

169
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,250
Gray and the others just
went off without us.

170
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,375
Yeah.

171
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,041
But I wonder if it
was necessary for us

172
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,833
to split up into teams.

173
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,958
They took on a mission to
infiltrate the enemy, correct?

174
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,208
That's exactly what
they should've done.

175
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,625
After all, we'd be
completely outclassed

176
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,541
in a fight with Alvarez.

177
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:51,000
There'd be no chance of us
even walking away from it.

178
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,083
[gasps]

179
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,958
That's true.

180
00:09:57,041 --> 00:10:00,083
And I doubt an infiltration
mission will fare much better.

181
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,541
[LEVY]
Realistically speaking,

182
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:05,291
the odds of either option
working are close to nil.

183
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:08,916
That's the whole reason for
doing this in separate teams.

184
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,375
To tip those odds a little
more in our favor. You see?

185
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,916
So, do you wanna explain
why you left without me?

186
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,875
Huh.

187
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,500
You're just so tiny
that I assumed

188
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,083
you musta been stowin'
away in my bag.

189
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:26,625
That was my mistake, sorry!
Nothin' personal.

190
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,333
[LEVY]
Jeez! Stupid metal-brained jerk!

191
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,125
Are they flirting
with each other?

192
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,583
Well, if you're lonely,

193
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,583
I can throw some
attention your way.

194
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,416
Thank you. But I'll be fine.

195
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,333
Seriously, you guys.
This enemy's different.

196
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,375
They're super dangerous.

197
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,791
Don't even think of fighting
them, no matter what.

198
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,000
[MEST]
There it is. Caracol Island.


199
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,708
[GRAY] Great, let's get
ready to disembark.


200
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,083
[ERZA]
Wait!

201
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,833
Something's wrong.

202
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:56,958
[GRAY gasps]

203
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,416
That's the crest of
the Alvarez military!

204
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,458
What are they doin'
way out here?

205
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,000
That's a very good question.

206
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,666
Caracol isn't in
their territory!

207
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,666
It appears they're performing
an inspection at the harbor.

208
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,000
[GRAY growls]

209
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,416
How the hell are we gonna
get on that island now?

210
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,166
Sounds like they're tryin' to
catch a spy. That's not good.

211
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,500
From what I can tell,

212
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,750
they haven't been able
to catch him yet, though.

213
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,125
Huh?

214
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,375
Hold on. You can hear
them this far away?

215
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,458
[BOTH]
Oh, yeah, but just barely.

216
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:38,833
[BOTH retch]

217
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,541
So, what now?

218
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:43,541
We're gonna have to make contact
with our agent quickly,

219
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,416
while we can.

220
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,291
[SOLDIER A]
This is a restricted zone!

221
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,083
[SOLDIER B]
Everyone form a line!

222
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,875
[SOLDIER C] Be prepared
to show identification

223
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:07,500
and submit to a search before
entering or exiting the area!

224
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,625
What in the world
is this all about?

225
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,125
I don't know, but I
heard that there's a spy

226
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,208
running from the empire,

227
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,666
and the military
tracked him out here.

228
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,916
A heck of a way to
start a vacation.

229
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,750
Natsu. Promise me you'll behave.

230
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,666
Yeah, yeah, I promise.

231
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,208
[SOLDIER A]
Next.

232
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:26,666
We're a couple of fun-loving
girls on a sightseeing vacay!

233
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,833
We'd love to sample some of
Caracol's famous Star Mangoes!

234
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,083
Yummy!

235
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,166
This'll be great! Right, Sis?

236
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,833
Oh, yeah!

237
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,458
Please don't blow our cover.

238
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:41,125
Yeah, our story has
to be believable.

239
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:44,875
[SOLDIER A] Hm? Is that a
guild crest on your hand?

240
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:49,833
Yes, sir, we're wizards!
From the Cait Shelter guild!

241
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,250
[ERZA]
Our disguise is perfect.

242
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,458
[WENDY]
This brings back memories!

243
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,291
[SOLDIER A]
Never heard of that one before.

244
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,791
[SOLDIER B]
Don't look at me,

245
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,666
I only know a handful of guilds
from Ishgar to begin with.

246
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,291
[SOLDIER A]
What should we do about this?

247
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,916
They told us to be especially
thorough with wizards.

248
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,375
[SOLDIER B]
I dunno.

249
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,333
But do you think the spy's
contacts would waltz in here

250
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,958
showing off their guild marks?

251
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,750
[SOLDIER C]
Good point.

Excuse us.

Huh?

00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,958
But would you let us
through, pretty please?

255
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:21,000
All I want is a Star Mango.
Would you deny me that pleasure?

256
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,875
[SOLDIERS gasp]

257
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:23,916
[SOLDIER A]
All right!

and belongings!

You may pass!

[LUCY chuckles]

261
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,041
That worked out.

Putty in your hands.
Nicely done, ladies.

263

Seems my charm works
on human males, too.

264
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah, well.

265
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,958
I don't really think we had much
to do with what just happened.

266
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:44,666
I think your feline form
is much cuter anyway.

[GRAY] Man, this whole place
is practically crawlin'

We need to be on
our best behavior.

Yeah. Don't do
anything stupid, Natsu.

271

Why is everybody pickin' on me?

272
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,791
Because you're the only
one who doesn't grasp

273
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,333
what infiltration
means, obviously.

274
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:09,375
I know what it means!
Like, bein' sneaky.

275
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,500
I think you're forgetting
something, Erza.

All right!

00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,916
We can't afford to go too crazy.

321
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,791
Yeah, I hear ya. I promise
I'll keep my cool.

322
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,875
Sounds like a plan.

[GRAY]
Well, that was easy.

327
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:43,750
I don't get why Gramps thought
these jokers were so scary.

328
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,166
One thing is certain.

329
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,500
They will be sending
out reinforcements.

330
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:48,750
Hey.

331
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,125
Ya think we should
ask these clowns

332
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,916
if they know where Gramps is?

333
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,791
Sounds like a total
waste of time to me.

334
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,875
They probably don't
know anything.

335
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,791
And we'd basically just
be telling the enemy

336
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,916
what our true goal is.

337
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:07,083

to stay alert.

[NATSU]
So good.

339

[LUCY]
There is a pretty big difference

340
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,750
between "staying alert"
and "stuffing your face."

I appreciate the business,

but try not to cause
another scene, okay?

344
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,708
I am sorry about that.

I gotta say, man

even with all this trouble,
seems like you're doin' well.

You must really know a
lot about running a shop.

348
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,583
That was definitely
not the first brawl

But I'm never gonna
let go of my dream!

Mark my words.

The Star Mango is gonna be
a massive hit in Ishgar!

And my shop is gonna be
the number one place

whole continent!

Nice! Sounds delici--
Uh. I mean, delightful.

All I've got right now is this
one shabby little shack.

of shops in Ishgar.

What's that mean?

By Requipping,
it essentially means

395

that you're grabbing stuff from
a different pocket of space.

396

Too bad, because
all "space" magic

is completely
ineffective against me.
