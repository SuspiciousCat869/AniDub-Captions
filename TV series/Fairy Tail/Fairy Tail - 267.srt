1
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,500
Guess what!

2
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:40,750
Hungry?

3
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,083
I've got something you
might wanna nibble on.

4
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,458
I didn't know you had a
little friend with you.

5
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:58,958
It's nice, huh? Having friends.

6
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,416
[MAVIS]
Being in nature...

7
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:08,500
[MAVIS] ...reminds me the
world is full of kindness.

8
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:49,166
[MAVIS humming]


9
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,458
Could there be a more
beautiful day?


10
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,458
[ZERA] Here you are, sitting
around daydreaming, as usual.

11
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,166
Hey, Zera!

12
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,041
So I guess you
conveniently forgot

13
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,041
all about
cleaning the library.

14
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,125
Oh. Whoops, I didn't mean to!

15
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,166
My point is, you forgot!

16
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,833
Well, there's no time
like the present!

17
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:12,166
Honestly, Mavis! You're
not wearing shoes again?

18
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:16,458
Of course not!
I love going barefoot!

19
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,208
I know.

20
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:23,541
Hey, Mavis. You've
forgiven me, right?

21
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,916
For how I used to treat you?

22
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:35,791
For what? Being super mean
to me all of the time?

23
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,916
Come on, we're way
over that stuff.

24
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,500
You're my best friend forever!

25
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,375
Aw, really?

26
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,541
You are just the
sweetest little thing!

27
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,541
I'm not half as
sweet as you are.

28
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:49,750
Let's go.

29
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:50,916
[ZERA]
Okay.

30
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:13,125
[MAVIS] Seven years ago,
tragedy struck Tenrou Island.

31
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:16,041
Wizards from Blue Skull
invaded our home.

32
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,583
They slaughtered
everyone in sight,

33
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:21,416
wiping out the entire Red Lizard
guild, and villagers alike.

34
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,333
But Zera and I survived
that horrible night.

35
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:27,250
And for all these years,
we've lived in isolation,

36
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,541
with only each other
to keep us company

37
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,458
and to share our thoughts.

38
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,375
Just us on that island.

39
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:36,750
Alone, but not alone.

40
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:37,916
[YURI]
You ready, boys?

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,208
Let's go snag ourselves
that Tenrou Orb!

42
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,291
So ya know where it is, do ya?

43
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:45,250
I think he means, "Let's
split up and look for it."

44
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,125
Yup! And I call this way!

45
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,958
Well, I reckon I'll head east.

46
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,000
[PRECHT sighs]

47
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,041
[PRECHT]
Give the signal if you find it.

48
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,291
[YURI]
You bet!

49
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,666
So where should I
put this stack of books?

50
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,125
Put 'em in that bookcase.

51
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,666
What about these?

52
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,166
In that one over there.

53
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,750
There's still more.

54
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,958
Those go over...

55
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,541
[ZERA]
They're all completely full!

56
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,916
Calm down, silly.

57
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,958
We just have to organize
them a little more neatly.

58
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:29,291
Oh, wow! A book all about
ancient battle strategies!

59
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,375
Reading that sounds even
more boring than cleaning up.

60
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:36,083
Just put it away! Or we're
never gonna get done in here!

61
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:44,041
[YURI]
Hey. I recognize that.

62
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:48,291
It's the Red Lizard guild mark.
Or at least, it used to be.

63
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,083
I should set aside
a little space here

64
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,708
to store my absolute
favorite ones.

65
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,250
Quit slacking off already!

66
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:05,166
You must've read that book
over a thousand times by now!

67
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,333
Yeah, I know,

68
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,500
but every time I discover
something new!

69
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,000
That's really interesting.

70
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,791
What am I doing?! I won't let
you drag me down with you!

71
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,625
First we do our chores,
then we relax!

72
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,916
Okay!

73
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:23,666
[ZERA]
Hm?

74
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,333
Huh? What's the matter, Zera?

75
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,666
I think someone's here.

76
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,750
There's somebody else
on the island? But why?

77
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,791
No, no, no, this
can't be happening!

78
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:34,958
[MAVIS]
Don't freak out!

79
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,291
I'm so scared.

80
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,958
I haven't talked to anybody
in over seven years!

81
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,208
I don't know what to do!

82
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:43,208
Do I not count as "anybody"?

83
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,333
They're here!

84
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,583
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

85
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,208
[ZERA]
Okay!

86
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,041
Be careful.

87
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,250
[chuckles]

88
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,375
Everything'll be fine.

89
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,333
It's a massive library.

90
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,625
You mind telling me why
you've come to this island?

91
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,291
[YURI]
Whoa! You scared me!

92
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:21,458
They told me this place
was completely deserted!

93
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,958
[YURI]
Oh, man.

94
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,041
Gonna answer?

95
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,416
Uh, yeah. It's because I--

96
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,208
I came here to study
the island's ecosystem.

97
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,833
[MAVIS]
You're lying.

98
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,875
If you're truly a biology
expert, as you claim,

99
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,416
then tell me this:

100
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,791
How did you protect yourself
against the poisonous Yaktrinca?

101
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,250
What's she talking about?

102
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,708
I guess you don't get out much.

103
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,625
But there's a place near
the port of Hargeon

104
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:51,375
that sells a Yaktrinca antidote.

105
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,291
So why did you actually
come to the island?

106
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,916
[YURI]
I told you already.

107
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,125
That was a good story,

108
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,250
but Yaktrinca isn't
the least bit poisonous.

109
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,958
Even an amateur biologist
would know that.

110
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,041
You're not a very
convincing liar.

111
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,125
[grunts]

112
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,958
You nailed him. Way to go!

113
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,208
[YURI] You must think
you're really smart, huh?

114
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:12,208
I have read thousands
and thousands of books!

115
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,625
I'm a treasure hunter,

116
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,083
and I came here to find a jewel
called the Tenrou Orb.

117
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,541
Bet'cha didn't know that.

118
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,041
[MAVIS]
The Tenrou Orb?

119
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,041
Now don't act like you haven't
heard of it, smarty-pants.

120
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,791
It's the only S-class
treasure on this island.

121
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,833
Of course I've heard of it.

122
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,708
Because it's Tenrou Island's
most sacred artifact.

123
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:33,208
So I can't let anyone just
waltz in here and take it.

124
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,458
You're spunky, but I don't think

125
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,625
you're gonna be much
of an obstacle for me.

126
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,000
[ZERA]
Huh?

127
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,833
Aw, who am I tryin' to kid?

128
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,583
I'm not fightin' a little girl.

129
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:51,916
[sighs]

130
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,041
Well, you're obviously
a sharp little tack,

131
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:01,041
so are you willing to take
me on in a game of wits?

132
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,666
[MAVIS]
You wanna play a game?

133
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,208
[YURI]
Yeah, and if I win,

134
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,875
you have to tell me where
to find the Tenrou Orb.

135
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:11,500
If you win, I'll leave the
island without any more fuss.

136
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,125
[YURI] All right,
I'll sweeten the deal.

137
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,625
If you beat me, I'll take
you to meet a fairy.

138
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,500
A real fairy?

139
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:23,083
[YURI]
Yeah.

140
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,625
It's a deal!

141
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,125
But only if you win, okay?

142
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,791
She's so gullible.

143
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,625
The rules are pretty simple.

144
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,791
All we do is point out some
facts about each other.

145
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,916
[MAVIS]
Can you give me an example?

146
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,250
Yeah, sure.

147
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,166
So on my first turn,
I could say something like,

148
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,458
"You are a girl."

149
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,583
If that fact is true,
then you'd be up next.

150
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,541
And I could say
that you're a man.

151
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,083
[YURI] Yeah, that's pretty
much the gist of it.

152
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,291
[MAVIS]
Hm...

153
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,541
[YURI] The first to
get one wrong loses.

154
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,166
I assume lying's not allowed.

155
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,666
[YURI]
Naturally.

156
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,458
However, there is one
more important rule.

157
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,500
We can't state any fact
that we both have in common.

158
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,500
What kind of things do
we have in common?

159
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:06,291
Obvious statements like,
"You have eyes."

160
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,500
Things that'd be
true of anybody.

161
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,958
If we pointed out
stuff like that,

162
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,208
the game would never end.

163
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,375
Yes, I see.

164
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,208
The whole game is
basically an exercise

165
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,833
in deductive reasoning.

166
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,375
Oh, and there's one more thing,

167
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,875
the key words can
only be used one time.

168
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,000
I get it. You mind if
we do a practice run?

169
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,208
[YURI]
Not at all.

170
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,833
I'm positive that you
are not a biologist.

171
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:31,250
[YURI] Correct.
I'm positive you love books.

172
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,750
You're right about that!

173
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,416
I can clearly see that you are
wearing a leather jacket.

174
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,833
Right again.

175
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,000
But you can only point out

176
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,375
your opponent's
appearance one time, too.

177
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,000
Else there'd be no end to it.

178
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,666
Makes sense to me.

179
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,625
[YURI]
You are a teenager.

180
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:49,583
Yes, just barely.
And I'd say you...

181
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,666
...are in your 20s.

182
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,166
Ha! Incorrect!

183
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,458
Despite my obvious maturity,
I'm still in my teens.

184
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:57,583
[YURI laughs]

185
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,666
[YURI]
I win that round!

186
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,583
But that was just
a practice run.

187
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,666
Here comes the real thing.

188
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,333
And there's no backin'
outta this one, okay?

189
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,375
Oh, no. This is such
a horrible idea.

190
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,875
Mavis can be such an airhead.

191
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,041
If she gets distracted,

192
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,375
she's gonna blow the
whole thing for us.

193
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:15,916
[YURI]
Ready?

194
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,041
Ready.

195
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,791
Let the game begin!

196
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,875
[YURI]
Now the trump card.

197
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,416
Hm? What in the world is that?

198
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,208
[YURI] An A-class treasure,
the Judgment Field.

199
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:31,000
Anyone standing inside it
has to tell the truth.

200
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,833
If you lie, this magic
item will know

201
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,291
and you will be
deemed the loser.

202
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,166
Pretty cool little
gadget, isn't it?

203
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,708
It really uses magic?

204
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,000
[YURI]
Yep.

205
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,041
And because you can't
lie, that also means

206
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:44,041
you can't break the promise
you made to me earlier.

207
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,458
[MAVIS]
What promise?

208
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,166
That you'd tell me where
I could find the Tenrou Orb

209
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,750
if I beat you at this game.

210
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,000
Ah, I'd forgotten about that.

211
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,958
I got so wrapped up in
everything, it slipped my mind.

212
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:58,875
And remember if I win,
I get to meet a real fairy!

213
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,208
This'll be fun.

214
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:03,125
And your magic field will
guarantee my victory.

215
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,166
How?

216
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,500
[chuckles]

217
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,958
Beacuse you're gonna have
to stick to the rules.

218
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,833
I was the winner of the
practice round, after all.

219
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,083
Whaddaya mean?

220
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,583
According to the rules,

221
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,916
we can't state anything
that we have in common.

222
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,250
I'm a teenager.

223
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,208
But as you admitted, so are you.

224
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,666
Since you stated something
that we both have in common,

225
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,666
you lost the round.

226
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,041
Now that we have
this magic field,

227
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,500
you can't break the rules.

228
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,833
So are you ready?

229
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:31,833
[YURI] This brat is way smarter
than I thought she'd be.

230
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,916
But even so, I have
a clear advantage.

231
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,625
I'm gonna meet a fairy!

232
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,583
[YURI]
Tons of information.

233
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:41,666
In sports, they talk about
a "home field advantage."

234
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,208
This game has
the exact opposite.

235
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,750
There's info about
her everywhere I look.

236
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,583
The books she's reading.
What she ate today.

237
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,541
Her hobbies and interests.

238
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,666
It's all out in the open.

239
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,750
On the other hand, she's
got almost nothing on me.

240
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,500
This'll be over in no time.

241
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,375
[YURI]
Whaddaya say we get started?

242
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,875
First thing is deciding
who goes first.

243
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,875
It doesn't really matter to me.

244
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:06,666
[gasps]

245
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,500
What?

246
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:09,916
You heard me.

247
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,375
It makes absolutely no
difference what order we go in.

248
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,125
Because I'm going to
win it in one round.

249
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,291
[MAVIS] And that's the story
of how Yuri and I first met.

250
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,958
Who could have imagined
that in 95 days

251
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,083
we'd create Fairy Tail?

252
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,125
[YURI]
Hold on a second,

253
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,500
you understand how this
game works, don'tcha?

254
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,375
Yes, of course I do.

255
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,500
Whatever we say, your
magic field will determine

256
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,458
whether it's true
or false, right?

257
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,625
[YURI]
That's right.

258
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,375
And you said you'll
win the first round,

259
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,875
so if we go to round two,
you'll automatically lose.

260
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,708
[MAVIS] I know, because
we've already established

261
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,750
that lying means
forfeiting the game.

262
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,416
[YURI]
Okay.

263
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,583
[YURI]
This is ridiculous.

264
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,541
I've been playing this game
practically my entire life.

265
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:13,541
Nobody's ever won it in just
one turn. It's impossible!

266
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:17,416
She must be bluffing.
Trying to ruffle my feathers.

267
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,625
[YURI]
I've got this in the bag.

268
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,916
She sealed her fate
by being so cocky.

269
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,958
So you think it doesn't matter
which one of us goes first?

270
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:28,833
[MAVIS]
Nope.

271
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,791
Then allow me to do the honors.

272
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,166
[YURI] Here's an
undisputable fact for ya.

273
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,625
You're a bird owner.

274
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,791
Try and deny that,
ya little know it all!

275
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,625
Here goes.

276
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:41,750
You are a bird--

277
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,500
No, I'm not!

278
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,458
Uh!

279
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,375
[ZERA]
Uh?

280
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:46,583
Since you got that one wrong,

281
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,541
I win the round
and the entire game!

282
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,208
That's totally unfair!

283
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:53,291
You didn't even give me a
chance to finish my sentence.

284
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,208
So what?

285
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,416
We went over all the rules

286
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,833
and I don't remember
there being one about

287
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,583
not cutting off your opponent.

288
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,250
The first thing you said
was, "you're a bird,"

289
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,375
but all evidence clearly
shows that I'm human,

290
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,791
so your statement was
false and you lose.

291
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,666
Why, you... You tricked me.

292
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,666
I didn't know she was so sneaky.

293
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,791
That doesn't count!
You cheated! I call do-over!

294
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,833
No! I will not accept it!

295
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,250
Okay, then new rule!

296
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,833
We have to let the other
person finish talking!

297
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,583
That's fine by me.

298
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,958
All right, ya little cheater,
that means it's your turn now.

299
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,541
[MAVIS]
Okay.

300
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,791
I'll go if you insist, but this
will still be the final round.

301
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,416
Are you ready?

302
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,375
Don't forget that you have
to keep your promises.

303
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,875
The first one being that you'll
leave the island immediately.

304
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:41,458
And more importantly that
I can meet a real fairy!

305
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,000
[YURI] How the heck does
she think she can win

306
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,125
in one turn again?

307
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,250
Besides, there's absolutely
no way she can pull it off.

308
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,416
It's impossible for the
questioner to win.

309
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,541
The game doesn't work that way.

310
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,791
I don't think you understand.

311
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,208
If you get it right,

312
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,208
that just means it's my turn
and we keep on playing.

313
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,833
But if you happen
to get it wrong,

314
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,625
you lose and the
whole thing is over.

315
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,208
[MAVIS]
I know.

316
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,166
[YURI] Well, if you understand
that, you should be able to see

317
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,875
the person stating
the facts can never win.

318
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,416
You're just making
that assumption

319
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,041
based on your limited personal
experience and understanding

320
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,708
of how you think the game works.

321
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,583
Which is precisely why
you're going to lose.

322
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:18,791
Here goes.

323
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,041
[YURI]
Bring it!

324
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,041
[YURI] Why does she think
she can win like this?

325
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,958
Ever since we first
began playing the game,

326
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:31,083
you have blinked your eyes
a total of 57 times.

327
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,208
Huh?

328
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,458
What'd you say?!

329
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,916
I said, you've blinked
a total of 57 times

330
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,041
since the game began.

331
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,583
Now is that statement
true or false?

332
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,125
How can anyone
possibly know that?!

333
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,875
[YURI]
That's completely insane!

334
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,458
There's no way she could've
been counting my blinks!

335
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,833
Hold on!

336
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,416
Since blinking is something
that we have in common,

337
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,791
you broke the rules.

338
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,416
[MAVIS]
No, I didn't.

339
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,166
Actually, ever since
we started the game,

340
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,541
I haven't allowed myself
to blink a single time.

341
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,291
I think my eyes are
about to explode!

342
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:06,291
[YURI]
What? No! She can't be serious!

343
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,250
Wait. Don't freak out.

344
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,708
Just think. I've still
got a 50% chance at this.

345
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,625
Is she right or wrong?

346
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,041
Oh, man! She got me!

347
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,916
Whatever I say, I won't know
the truth! I'll be lying!

348
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,958
There is no way in hell
anyone could ever answer

349
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,375
a crazy question like that!

350
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,750
How come I never
thought of that?!

351
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,291
[cries]

352
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,416
[YURI] She did it.
I hate to admit defeat.

353
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,833
Oh, my poor, aching eyes.

354
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,541
[YURI] But this girl
is really something!

355
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,166
[PRECHT]
Yuri!

356
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,458
Do you mind explaining
what's going on in here?

357
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,916
Whoa. This library's
unbelievable!

358
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,416
We almost got rid of him
and his friends show up?

359
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,833
Oh, man. It's Precht and Warrod.

360
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,958
[PRECHT] Our work is done.
Let's get going.

361
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:56,750
[YURI]
What?

362
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,166
Did you guys find the orb?

363
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,958
I said I wouldn't tell.

364
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,375
[PRECHT]
We've located it, yes.

365
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:05,583
[MAVIS, YURI] You mean that
whole game was pointless?

366
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,916
[PRECHT] This is where
it should be, at least.

367
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,750
But it's been taken.

368
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,666
[PRECHT]
Somebody beat us to it.

369
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,333
I guess some other
treasure hunters

370
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:22,958
must've gotten to the thing
before we had a chance.

371
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:26,000
[PRECHT]
Let's head back to the mainland.

372
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,625
We're not givin' up on it.

373
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,166
Just gonna see if we can get
more intel back home.

374
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,583
Wait a minute.

375
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,750
I'm almost positive I can
tell you who's responsible

376
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,291
for the orb's disappearance.

377
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,625
[PRECHT]
Who's that?

378
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,291
[MAVIS]
Seven years ago, a wizard guild

379
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,666
by the name of Blue Skull

380
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,166
invaded the island and
plundered the village.

381
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,958
You're the first ones
to come here since then,

382
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,625
so they must've taken it.

383
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,125
[PRECHT]
It was a wizard guild?

384
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,250
That's not good news for us.

385
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,458
[PRECHT] Even still, we'll
have to pay them a visit.

386
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:55,625
Listen. Yuri, Precht,
and Warrod, right?

387
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,166
My name is Mavis Vermillion.

388
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,708
And for the past seven years,

389
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:02,583
I've been studying strategies
for taking on wizard guilds.

390
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,291
Together, we can beat them.

391
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:07,083
No, Mavis. You've got
to be kidding me.

392
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,750
I humbly ask you
take me with you.

393
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:14,791
The Tenrou Orb is the
symbol of this island.

394
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:18,708
My people have protected this
sacred relic for generations.

395
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,125
I must fix this.

396
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,541
The treasure belongs
to the island,

397
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,250
and it's my duty to
see it's returned.

398
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,458
Please don't.

399
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,875
Just to be clear,
we're treasure hunters.

400
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,375
Even if we do find the thing,

401
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,041
there's no guarantee we're just
gonna give it back to you.

402
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,000
Then you and I can have
another game of wits

403
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,625
whenever that time comes.

404
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,750
But right now, we share a
common goal of finding it.

405
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,333
Not to mention you
still have to make good

406
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,791
on the promise you made.

407
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,541
I wanna meet a real fairy!

408
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:47,833
[YURI]
Huh?!

409
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,333
That damned Yuri.

410
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:57,708
Is he seriously considering

411
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,458
letting that girl
tag along with us?

412
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,583
It may not be such a bad idea.

413
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:05,333
She's obviously one
smart little cookie.

414
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,583
It's kinda sad.

415
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:11,583
Living in solitude on
this island for so long...

416
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,583
It's quite fascinating.

417
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:20,083
So why don't you tell me why
you're really coming with us.

418
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,750
[MAVIS] To bring the Tenrou Orb
back to its rightful place.

419
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:26,166
I mean, you didn't even notice
it was stolen for seven years.

420
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,500
So it can't be all that
important to you.

421
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,958
We're just after it because
it's an S-class treasure.

422
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,708
Of course it's important.

423
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,333
I just never realized it before.

424
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,833
And to be totally honest,

425
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,333
this is a great chance to
finally see the outside world.

426
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,291
For me and Zera.

427
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,541
Who is that?

428
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:47,500
[MAVIS] C'mon, Zera. Stop
skulking around and say hello!

429
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:48,708
Please?

430
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,166
I guess I have to now.

431
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,166
She's a little on the shy side.

432
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,750
You don't have to make
excuses for me.

433
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,041
[YURI]
Uh...

434
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,291
Well, aren't you going
to pack your suitcase?

435
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,291
I never said I was
going with you!

436
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,541
And I'm definitely not leaving

437
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,041
with some creepy
treasure hunter.

438
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,875
Uh. That's all right.

439
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,833
This is probably the
most important decision

440
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:10,750
we've ever made.

441
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:11,958
It's a huge deal.

442
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,666
Whaddaya mean by that?

443
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,208
There's a whole world
waiting out there,

444
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,791
and we're never gonna
see it if we stay here.

445
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,958
It's scary, but we can't
hide from it forever.

446
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,916
[ZERA]
Fine. I'll go too.

447
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,416
Then it's settled.
We're both going with you!

448
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,166
[YURI]
Okay...

449
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,958
Hey, Mavis.
How old is Zera anyway?

450
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:38,583
He should know to never
ask a lady her age!

451
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,750
She's a teenager, just like us.

452
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:44,916
I don't really think I want this
guy to know very much about me.

453
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,291
Okay.

454
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,666
Very nice meet you, Zera.

455
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:53,166
This is going to be so much fun!

456
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,875
You don't have to worry.

457
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,333
Okay! Let our adventure begin!

458
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,041
[YURI]
I must admit,

459
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:25,625
I was charmed by this
mysterious little girl.

460
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,000
But if I knew then
what I know now,

461
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,791
I would've never agreed
to let her come along.

462
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:33,541
That one decision would've
changed everything.

463
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:36,250
Prevented all of this
heartache and pain.

464
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:15,791
[MAVIS] We sailed away from
the comfort and security

465
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,083
of the only home
I've ever known,

466
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:20,208
across the sea and
into the waiting world.

467
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:21,750
Creatures I'd only
read about in books

468
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,208
were right before my eyes.

469
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:26,000
I finally experienced what
life is like on the outside.

470
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:29,083
It's a place full
of incredible joy!

471
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:30,375
But when I learned
about the troubles

472
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:32,750
plaguing my new friends,
I had to do something.

473
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:36,333
It was finally time
