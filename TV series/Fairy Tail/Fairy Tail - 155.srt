official rulebook by tomorrow.

156
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,250
I'm to read all this?

157
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,125
[LEVY] Aw, don't worry!

158
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,708
I have my Wind-Reader
Glasses with me!

159
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,833
Levy to the rescue!

160
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,791
[LEVY] Okay, to sum it all up...

161
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,750
I would say there
are three major rules.

162
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,875
The first one is the
master of each guild

163
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,666
isn't allowed
to participate.

164
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,708
[MAKAROV]
Sounds sensible enough.

165
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,958
[LEVY] A guild can't have
anybody that doesn't bear their

166
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,666
respective emblem
take part on its behalf.

167
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,000
[GRAY] Kinda took
that one as a given.

168
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,375
[LEVY] And every game will
remain a mystery until the very

169
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,416
moment it is announced,
and only then will the

170
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,791
game's rules be
explained in detail.

171
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,500
Well, that's certainly
not very helpful.

172
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:58,250
[LEVY] This one
could be important, too.

173
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,125
All participants
must return to their

174
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,083
designated inn by
twelve o' clock.

175
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,833
There's a curfew?

176
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,083
[LUCY] What time again?

177
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,041
[CARLA] I suppose they
mean midnight tonight.

178
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,791
Or what, we all
turn into pumpkins?

179
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,333
That reminds me
of the story about the

180
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,916
princess and the glass slipper.

181
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,250
[JUVIA THINKS] So my darling
only talks about tales of

182
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,583
romance and lost
love when I'm not around?

183
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,875
Oh, my icy Prince!

184
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,916
[NATSU] Cool, we've got
tons of time until midnight!

185
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,916
And since this is everyone's
first time in the capital.

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,375
Let's go check it out!

187
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:32,458
[HAPPY] Aye, Sir!

188
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:33,833
[LUCY] Wait for me!

189
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:34,791
[ERZA] Hold on!

190
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,791
Do you know where we're staying?

191
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,541
[LUCY] The Honey
Bone Inn, right?

192
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,791
[ERZA] Just be sure to
be back by twelve o' clock!

193
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:41,583
You hear me?

194
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,208
[HAPPY] Aye!

195
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,458
[ERZA THINKS] I wonder what's
so important about that time.

196
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,458
[NARRATOR] Tonight,
the members representing the

197
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:54,125
Fairy Tail guild
will be staying here.

198
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,583
The Honey Bone Inn.

199
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,583
[ERZA] For some reason six
beds have been prepared.

200
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,291
Does this mean we'll all
be sharing the same room?

201
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,291
Nothing appears to
be out of the ordinary here.

202
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,833
[JUVIA] Gray, my darling!

203
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,750
[GRAY]
Hey, didn't expect to see you.

204
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,208
You come all this
way by yourself?

205
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,666
I'm not the only one, silly.

206
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,041
The entire guild came
here to cheer you on!

207
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:05,541
[GRAY] I guess nobody's
busy takin' on any jobs, huh?

208
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,708
[JUVIA] What do you
think about you and I

209
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,041
going to get a bite
to eat somewhere?

210
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,583
[GRAY] Yeah, sure.
I am getting pretty hungry.

211
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:12,958
Lucky for you,

212
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,041
I know of a perfect
restaurant not far from here.

213
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,583
Lyon!

214
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:17,916
[LYON] It's quite
romantic, actually.

215
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,500
Complete with an
aquarium filled with

216
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,083
beautiful creatures
from the sea.

217
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,416
[JUVIA] Oh yeah?
Well.

218
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,458
I, uh.

219
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,833
Hey man, you
can't just go runnin'

220
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,916
away with one of
our guild members!

221
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,083
[LYON] Rumor has it that you're
entering the Grand Magic Games.

222
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,291
Right?

223
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,583
Yeah?

224
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,375
[LYON] It's no use.

225
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:37,333
For Lamia Scale will surely
emerge as the victor.

226
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:40,083
[GRAY] I thought you guys
always came in second place.

227
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,083
And your guild always
comes in last place.

228
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,625
But this year will be different
for us because Jura and I

229
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,833
will be participating in the
games for the very first time.

230
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,333
That means we'll be
stronger than ever before.

231
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:52,625
Well, we happen
to have our own

232
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,916
ace-in-the hole
known as Erza Scarlet.

233
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,208
So don't count us
out of the race just yet.

234
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,416
Let's make a friendly wager.

235
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,083
If Lamia Scale wins the
Grand Magic Games this year,

236
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:06,041
then the beautiful Juvia
will become part of our guild!

237
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,833
[GRAY] Are you serious?
And, what if we win?

238
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,916
If your guild wins,
we'll give her back.

239
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,458
She's already a member
of our guild, you bonehead!

240
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,625
This is a gentleman's
agreement.

241
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,416
So don't forget it, Gray.

242
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,208
This has got to be
the absolute stupidest

243
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,708
bet that I've ever heard of!

244
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,416
The words of a man
afraid to lose.

245
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,583
Oh, I ain't afraid.

246
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,083
My darling Gray, please
don't torture us any longer!

247
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,333
Do you want to be with Lyon
or the woman who loves you?

248
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,458
You have to make
up your mind already!

249
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:39,083
[GRAY] You really don't have a
clue what's going on, do you?

250
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,375
[JELLAL] You always
know what to say, don't you?

251
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,125
[ERZA] That's not true at all.

252
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:58,375
I just stumble through
life one day at a time.

253
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,041
That's all

254
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,541
[ICHIYA] Erza.

255
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:07,041
Your fragrant parfum is
as intoxicating as I remember.

256
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:07,916
Sniff, sniff!

257
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,791
Sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff!

258
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,875
[ERZA]
You need to respect my privacy!

259
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,250
Got it?

260
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,125
[ICHIYA] Man!

261
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:22,000
[EVE] You're so beautiful
when you're angry.

262
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,583
[REN] We didn't come here
to make you feel better,

263
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,541
so don't get the wrong idea.

264
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,583
[HIBIKI]
Would you like to freshen up?

265
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,750
[ERZA] Why don't you follow
your little troll of a master?

266
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,291
[ALL] Trimens forever!

267
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,375
[kids cry out]

268
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,375
Isn't that beautiful, Carla?

269
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,708
Breathtaking!

270
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,791
They call it Mercurius,
the luminaria flower palace.

271
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:22,000
Looking at it makes me
wonder what the king is like!

272
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,083
[WENDY] I bet he
has a long, white, beard.

273
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,916
[CARLA] Perhaps he does, child.

274
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,791
[LUCY]
It's really amazing how many

275
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,166
flowers there are in
the city, dontcha think?

276
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,458
[HAPPY] Well, they
don't call Crocus the

277
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,458
Flower-Blooming
Capital for nothin'!

278
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:43,708
[MALE CITIZEN 155E] A fight!

279
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,083
[NATSU] Ah!

280
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,958
I guess fights are part
of this festival after all!

281
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,333
Let's check it out!

282
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,500
[HAPPY] With all the
different guilds that are here,

283
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:50,875
there was bound to
be a couple of scuffles!

284
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,333
[LUCY] Hold on, you guys!

285
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:54,541
You smell that?

286
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,916
What is it?

287
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,666
It smells like there's
a dragon around here.

288
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,500
No way!

289
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,000
[NATSU] Move it!
Comin' through!

290
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,500
Anybody else want some?

291
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,416
[LECTOR] Man, these guys are
a nothin' but a bunch of losers!

292
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,291
[FROSCH] Yeah,
they're big-time losers!

293
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,875
[NATSU] What's goin' on?

294
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,500
Looky here.

295
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,750
Is that Natsu Dragneel?

296
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,291
Kitties?

297
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,708
Get a load of the stupid
lookin' blue pussycat.

298
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:25,666
He's stupid.

299
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,750
And they can talk, too!

300
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,708
[LUCY] And that's
surprising, why exactly?

301
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,833
[NATSU] Yeah,
that's me, but who are you?

302
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,291
Has this guy
seriously never heard

303
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,583
of Sting and Rogue,

304
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,791
the Twin Dragons of the
Sabertooth guild before?

305
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:41,500
They're the main force behind
the strongest guild in Fiore!

306
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,666
[LUCY] These guys are
members of Sabertooth?

307
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,625
You think you're hot stuff?

308
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,250
[Sting laughs]

309
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,500
So the rumors about you
entering the Grand Magic

310
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,625
Games this year
were true after all!

311
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,125
[NATSU]
How do you know who I am?

312
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,083
Everybody knows.

313
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,416
You're the so-called
Dragon Slayer

314
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,250
who couldn't actually
slay a dragon!

315
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:06,041
Doesn't sound like much
of a Dragon Slayer to me.

316
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,250
The sad part of it is...

317
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,291
I actually used to
look up to you.

318
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,041
And my friend was
a big fan of Gajeel's.

319
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,416
It was more of a curiosity,

320
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,833
as he was known
as a fellow Dragon Slayer.

321
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,833
You gotta be kiddin' me.

322
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,541
You're both Dragon Slayers?

323
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,125
[STING] We would
prefer that you call us

324
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,291
true Dragon Slayers instead.

325
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,583
Because unlike you, we could've
easily slain Acnologia.

326
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,541
Well you'd be telling
a different story if you had

327
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,708
actually gone up against
that monster like we did.

328
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,208
Yeah,
you weren't even there!

329
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,791
[LECTOR] This pussycat
sounds as dumb as he looks.

330
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,916
[FROSCH] Yeah, you're
way smarter than him, Lector!

331
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,833
[ROGUE] It doesn't matter
if we were there or not.

332
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,375
[STING] What it all boils
down to is we're far superior.

333
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,625
Let me explain a
little somethin' to ya.

334
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,250
Natsu and those
other two are what's

335
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,500
known as First-Generation
Dragon Slayers, cause they

336
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,875
all got their magic power
directly from dragons firsthand.

337
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,166
Your old buddy Loxus
and that guy Cobra

338
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,666
from the Oracion Seis
got their magic from dragon

339
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,875
lacrimas that were
implanted inside their bodies.

340
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,958
We call 'em second-generation
Dragon Slayers.

341
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,833
But Sting and Rogue
here are way more powerful,

342
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,291
cause not only do they have
dragon lacrimas inside 'em,

343
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,166
they were also raised
by actual dragons

344
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,958
who taught them
how to use their magic.

345
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,250
So they're
Third-Generation hybrids!

346
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,666
Third-Generation?

347
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,833
In other words, they're
the ultimate Dragon Slayers!

348
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,791
You guys really think you're so
much better than everyone else?

349
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,833
They don't just think they are,
there's a huge difference

350
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:27,583
in skill between first and
third gen Dragon Slayers.

351
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,125
You wish you were
half as strong as they are.

352
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,208
Tell me somethin'
did you guys'

353
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:35,708
dragons disappear in
the year 777, too?

354
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,708
Yeah, you could say that.

355
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,000
More to
the point, they died.

356
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,708
The creatures that passed
down their Dragon Slayer

357
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,125
magic techniques to us,

358
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,791
we eliminated them
with our own hands.

359
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:50,125
So that we could earn the
title of True Dragon Slayers.

360
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,666
I don't believe it.

361
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,208
You killed them?

362
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:56,291
Is that really true?
Humans killing Dragons.

363
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,750
You scum.
Those were your parents!

364
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:14,958
They're late.

365
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,916
Explain yourselves.

366
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,291
Where have you
been all this time?

367
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,083
[GRAY] Having a completely
un-enjoyable meal.

368
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,708
[LUCY] We ran into a
couple of other contestants.

369
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,458
A real nasty pair if you ask me.

370
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,625
Listen...

371
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,166
If you're somehow able to make
it past the qualifying rounds.

372
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,250
We'll give you a taste of what

373
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,625
true Dragon Slayer
magic feels like.

374
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,083
[ROGUE] Let's get going.

375
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,958
We're wasting our time
with this old generation scum.

376
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,250
It makes sense that these
old school Dragon Slayers

377
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,541
would drag around this kind of
litter box trash with 'em, huh?

378
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,791
Yeah, he's straight
outta the litter box!

379
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,000
[HAPPY AND NATSU]
Those stupid jerks are gonna

380
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,750
wish they had never
messed with me!

381
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,875
Do any of you know
where Wendy ran off to?

382
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,125
[LUCY] Uh, no.

383
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,833
[GRAY] I haven't seen her.

384
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,833
Well it's a pretty safe
bet that she's off somewhere

385
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:07,166
with Carla, and it's not
really like her to get lost.

386
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,916
[ERZA] It's almost midnight.

387
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,541
[LUCY] I hate thinking
about a little girl like her

388
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,875
wandering around
the city at this hour.

389
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,083
[LUCY] Up all night.
Bad company.

390
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,333
Delinquency?

391
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,875
We're totally runnin'
things in this city now.

392
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,708
Don't screw with us!

393
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,958
[LUCY] What are we gonna do?

394
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,166
I know you're supposed
to be a writer and all,

395
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,625
but this isn't one
of your stories, Lucy.

396
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,083
We brought some supplies to
get you through the tournament.

397
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,041
Tomorrow's gonna
be a big day!

398
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,125
[GRAY]
Aw, thanks a lot you guys!

399
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,500
Hey, did you come
all the way here to

400
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,666
watch us beat up
on those other guilds?

401
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,833
[ELFMAN] Yeah.

402
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,750
I mean, I originally
wanted to get in on

403
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,625
the action and
impress my sisters.

404
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,833
[ELFMAN] But a real
man knows when to quit!

405
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,291
[ERZA] This is perfect timing.

406
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,083
Do you mind doing
us a small favor?

407
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,250
What do you need?

408
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,875
Well It's just that
Wendy hasn't made

409
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,666
it back here for
the night as of yet.

410
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,291
And those of us competing
in the games should

411
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:00,250
probably hang out here until
it turns twelve o' clock.

412
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,291
[LISANNA]
What happens at twelve?

413
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,208
We're not really sure
what, but the rules say

414
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,833
that we all hafta be
back here at midnight.

415
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,708
[GRAY] Which is right now.

416
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,416
[NATSU] What's gonna happen?

417
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,916
[MATO] Attention,
all contestants participating

418
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,166
in this year's Grand
Magic Games!

419
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,083
Good morning!

420
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,458
Outside!

421
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,500
Whoa, what in
the heck is that thing?

422
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,125
Is it some kinda hologram?

423
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,708
It's a great big pumpkin!

424
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,916
[MATO] To narrow down the one
hundred thirteen guilds in this

425
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,041
year's games to a
more manageable eight,

426
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,833
let's begin the
preliminary round!

427
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,291
Seriously?

428
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,250
Well, this is news!

429
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,916
Has there been a preliminary
round in years past?

430
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,291
No. This is completely new.

431
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,625
So this must
be the reason why we

432
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,166
were required to take
our places at midnight.

433
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,916
One hundred
and thirteen guilds,

434
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,166
narrowed down to a meager
eight in one fell swoop.

435
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,208
[LUCY THINKS] One hundred
thirteen. I had no idea there

436
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,791
were even that many guilds
in Fiore to begin with.

437
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,625
That number seems way too high.

438
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:07,916
[ERZA THINKS]
It doesn't make sense.

439
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,583
Why would they keep
this preliminary round

440
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,333
a secret until now?

441
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,625
Why all these new procedures?

442
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,750
[ERZA] The excessive
number of guilds involved.

443
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,833
And the mysterious magic
power Jellal talked about.

444
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,000
What are the organizers up to?

445
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,583
[MATO] Although the
number of guilds

446
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,958
increase and multiply each year.

447
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:28,708
"The games have gotten
boring now," is all I ever hear!

448
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,541
"Let's whittle them down"
I say to you!

449
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:34,083
And give just eight a cheer!

450
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:37,166
[MATO] The rules for this
preliminary round are simple!

451
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:43,708
[GRAY] What the--?

452
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:47,750
What's happening?
The inn is rising up!

453
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,791
[GRAY] Look! The other
ones are doin' it too!

454
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,000
[ELFMAN] A real man
dreams of rising up!

455
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:59,125
[MATO] Now, you will all
be participating in a race!

456
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:02,416
[MATO] The finish line is
at the Domus Flau coliseum!

457
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,041
Only the first eight teams
to reach it will move on

458
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,666
to the Grand Magic Games!

459
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,875
[GRAY] That's a path!

460
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,541
[ERZA] I suppose
we'll be following it?

461
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,208
[MATO] You're free to use
magic in any way you see fit!

462
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,333
There are no restrictions.

463
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,583
But remember,
only the first eight teams

464
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:20,166
to reach the finish
line will clear this round!

465
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,250
[MATO] However,
all five team members must

466
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,375
cross the goal for it to count!

467
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:27,541
[MATO] One more thing.
We are not responsible

468
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:30,583
for any loss of life that
may occur in the labyrinth.

469
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:31,916
Say what?

470
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:36,708
[MATO] So without further ado,
let the Grand Magic

471
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:42,000
Games' preliminary round,
Sky Labyrinth begin!

472
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:47,291
♪

473
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,666
[NATSU] Whoa!
What in the heck is that thing?

474
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,333
[HAPPY]
It's a big ol' floating maze.

475
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:18,916
But more importantly, it's where
the prelims are bein' held.

476
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,666
[NATSU] Aw man, I suck at mazes!

477
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,458
[HAPPY] Only the first
eight teams to reach the

478
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:24,000
goal get to compete
in the games!

479
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:25,208
[NATSU] So it's a race?

480
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:26,291
[HAPPY] Yeah, but all
five members of the

481
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:28,041
team have to get there to win!

482
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:30,833
[NATSU] Crap!
Wendy's still not here!

483
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:33,333
[HAPPY AND NATSU]
Next time: Sky Labyrinth!

484
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,375
[HAPPY] You know, I could take
Wendy's place if you need me to.

485
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:37,416
[NATSU] Awesome!

486
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,958
Elfman says
he'll fill in for her!

487
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:39,875
[HAPPY] Oh, he will?

488
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:41,500
Yeah, awesome.
