1
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,041
- Natsu: PREVIOUSLY
ON "FAIRY TAIL..."

2
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:21,791
- Lucy: WHEN WE WERE ATTACKED
BY THE ORACION SEIS

3
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,416
ERZA WAS BITTEN 
BY A GIANT SNAKE

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,083
AND NOW SHE'S BARELY
HANGING ON TO LIFE.

5
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,208
- Gray: WE ALSO LOST
MY OLD FRIEND, LYON.

6
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:28,625
- Happy: BUT THINGS ARE
STARTING TO LOOK UP

7
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,250
WHEN NATSU RUSHED IN
TO SAVE ME AND WENDY

8
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,041
FROM THAT CREEPY BRAIN GUY
AND HIS PALS.

9
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,125
- Natsu: UNTIL WE FOUND
OURSELVES FACE TO FACE 

10
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,625
WITH JELLAL.

11
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:42,500
- (theme music playing )

12
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:45,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

13
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:12,125
- ( rumbling )

14
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:20,291
 - WHAT'S THAT RUMBLING?

15
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,666
HEY, DO YOU HEAR THAT?

16
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,875
- ( yawns sleepily )

17
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,041
- ( chuckles )

18
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,375
- ( rumbling )

19
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,375
- ( chuckles )

20
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,250
- ( chuckles )

21
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:05,083
- ( Happy speaking )

22
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:17,041
- LYON.

23
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:21,500
- NO! IS HE--
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?

24
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,208
- HE WOULD NEVER
GIVE UP THAT EASILY.

25
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,750
LET'S FIND HIM.

26
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,875
COME ON.

27
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:30,875
- ( whimpers )

28
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,000
LYON...

29
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,041
HE'S GONE FOREVER.

30
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,791
SOMEBODY'S GOTTA PAY.

31
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:51,375
- YOU DON'T HONESTLY
THINK YOU CAN HIDE FROM ME?

32
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:52,791
SHOW YOURSELF.

33
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:00,666
- HOW SILLY OF ME TO TRY 
AND OUTFOX A WIZARD SAINT.

34
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,083
OH YEAH!

35
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,166
WE BOTH USE EARTH MAGIC AND YET
OUR POWERS ARE SO DIFFERENT.

36
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,875
MINE HEATS UP AND
SOFTENS THE SOIL,

37
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,583
WHILE YOURS SOLIDIFIES IT.

38
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:23,583
OH YEAH!

39
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,500
I WONDER WHOSE POWER
IS THE STRONGEST?

40
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:29,666
DON'T YOU?

41
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,041
- NO.

42
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,166
MAGICAL ABILITY
IS IRRELEVANT.

43
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,875
THE STRONGER
IDEOLOGY ALWAYS WINS.

44
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,250
- I'M AFRAID
THAT YOU'RE WRONG.

45
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,833
NO MATTER THE ERA,
THE ONES WHO TRIUMPH

46
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,000
ARE THE RICH.
OH YEAH!

47
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,958
- YOU MISS ME?

48
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,208
- NATSU!

49
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,875
- HOW'D YOU DO THAT, ANYWAY?

50
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,708
ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOUR MAP
POPPED RIGHT INTO MY HEAD.

51
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,958
- I'LL EXPLAIN IT TO YOU LATER.
IS WENDY ALL RIGHT?

52
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,041
- SHE'S FINE.

53
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,333
- TIME FOR YOU TO WAKE UP, KID.

54
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,750
I SAVED YOU.
NOW YOU GOT TO SAVE ERZA.

55
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,500
- DON'T BE SO ROUGH WITH HER!
- COME ON, RISE AND SHINE.

56
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,250
WAKEY, WAKEY.

57
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,208
- ( screams )

58
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:24,458
I HAD TO DO IT.  SORRY.

59
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,750
- I'M WILLING TO
OVERLOOK THAT RIGHT NOW.

60
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,041
ERZA WAS BITTEN BY 
A POISONOUS SNAKE.

61
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,333
SHE'S IN BAD SHAPE.
PLEASE SAVE HER!

62
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,625
- SHE'S HURT?

63
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,500
- WE NEED ERZA TO DEFEAT
THE ORACION SEIS.

64
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,916
WE DON'T STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST THEM WITHOUT HER HELP.

65
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,125
- PLEASE, WENDY, WE NEED
HER MORE THAN EVER.

66
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:00,291
- WE'RE BEGGING YOU.

67
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,416
- YEAH! I'LL TRY TO SAVE HER.
NO, I WILL.

68
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,750
- HURRAY.

69
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,416
- SNAP OUT OF IT ALREADY.
YOU'RE SO PATHETIC.

70
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,916
- AYE.

71
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,333
- I'VE HEARD THAT
JELLAL DID TERRIBLE THINGS

72
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,291
TO HURT ERZA IN THE PAST.

73
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,708
THAT'S HARD
FOR ME TO BELIEVE.

74
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,333
- Cobra: I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS ABOUT THIS GUY,

75
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,875
BUT I CAN'T HEAR
HIS INNER VOICE.

76
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,958
IF I COULD, I WOULDN'T
HAVE TO FOLLOW HIM AROUND

77
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,916
AND SPY ON HIM LIKE THIS.

78
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,416
WHY'D HE STOP?

79
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,375
I KNOW THE WOODSEA WELL,

80
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,875
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN
THIS PLACE BEFORE.

81
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,041
LOOKS LIKE BRAIN
WAS ONTO SOMETHING.

82
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,458
COULD THIS BE WHERE
NIRVANA IS SEALED? 

83
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,708
( laughing )

84
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:05,458
AT LAST, WE FOUND IT,
OUR FUTURE!

85
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,500
- WELL, THAT SHOULD DO IT.

86
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,375
I GOT RID OF ALL THE VENOM.

87
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,166
NOW ALL WE HAVE
TO DO IS WAIT.

88
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,333
- WAIT?!

89
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,375
( groans )

90
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,208
SHE'S OKAY!

91
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,916
- HEY, GIVE ME SOME SKIN, LUCY.

92
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,625
- I'M SO HAPPY.

93
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,708
( cries )

94
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,375
- DON'T LEAVE ME HANGING.

95
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,708
- FINE, JUST THIS ONCE.
- AYE.

96
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,291
- THANKS, WENDY.

97
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,291
I GUESS I OWE YOU ONE.

98
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,166
- SHE'S PROBABLY NOT GONNA 
WAKE UP FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

99
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,291
BUT SHE'LL BE BACK TO
NORMAL WHEN SHE DOES.

100
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,541
- THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

101
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,916
WHO KNEW SKY MAGIC
WAS SO STRONG?

102
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,875
SHE'S ALREADY
LOOKING MUCH BETTER.

103
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,166
- NO, YOU DON'T!

104
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,416
- EXCUSE ME.

105
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,000
NOW THAT YOUR
FRIEND IS HEALED,

106
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,375
PLEASE DON'T MAKE WENDY 
USE HER SKY MAGIC AGAIN.

107
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,875
SHE'LL INSIST THAT SHE'S FINE,

108
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,333
BUT I CAN TELL
THAT SHE'S EXHAUSTED

109
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,500
BY THE LOOK ON HER FACE.

110
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,125
- NO, YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG.

111
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,458
I'M JUST WORRIED IS ALL.

112
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,791
- WE'RE GONNA STRIKE BACK
AS SOON AS ERZA WAKES UP.

113
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,250
THERE'S NO NEED
TO WORRY, OKAY?

114
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,708
- YEAH, WATCH OUT,
ORACION SEIS.

115
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,458
- AYE! WE'RE NOT GONNA
LET YOU GET NIRVANA.

116
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:23,958
- WHAT IS THAT?!

117
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,125
- A GIANT PILLAR
OF BLACK LIGHT.

118
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,708
- NO WAY!

119
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,166
- Hibiki: IT'S BEEN UNSEALED.

120
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,708
- IT'S BEEN UNSEALED.

121
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,333
THAT'S NIRVANA!

122
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:36,041
- ALL OUR HARD WORK,
IT'S FINALLY PAID OFF.

123
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,958
WE DID IT!

124
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,333
NIRVANA BELONGS TO US!

125
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,833
- THAT BEAM OF LIGHT
JUST SHOT UP OUT OF NOWHERE.

126
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:58,416
OH, NO, DON'T TELL ME
THEY'VE ALREADY FOUND NIRVANA.

127
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,833
- SO IT HAPPENED.

128
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:02,125
- YES, NIRVANA IS OURS.

129
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,125
- CONGRATULATIONS ARE IN ORDER.

130
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,500
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

131
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,083
THERE'RE SOME PESKY
GUILD WIZARDS

132
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:12,125
I NEED TO ELIMINATE. 
DON'T WAIT UP FOR ME.

133
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,375
YOU SHOULD GO TO
THE LIGHT, FATHER.

134
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:23,000
- YEAH, THAT'S GOT TO BE IT.
- SERIOUSLY?

135
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,625
BUT HOW'D THE ORACION SEIS

136
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:25,708
BEAT US TO THE PUNCH?

137
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,500
- THAT PILLAR OF LIGHT...

138
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,250
I KNOW JELLAL'S THERE!

139
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,666
- JELLAL?

140
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,291
HOLD ON!

141
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,750
WAIT, DON'T JUST RUN OFF

142
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,750
WITHOUT TELLING US
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

143
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,750
- ( cries )

144
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,291
NO, WHAT HAVE I DONE?

145
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,708
THIS IS ALL BECAUSE OF ME.

146
00:12:56,791 --> 00:13:01,250
- ( pants )

147
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,833
I CAN'T RISK HIM
RUNNING INTO ERZA.

148
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,166
I GOT TO STOP HIM.

149
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,958
NO, I GOT TO DESTROY HIM.

150
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:12,250
THAT WAY, HE'LL NEVER
HURT HER AGAIN.

151
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,083
- JELLAL.

152
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:21,291
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THAT'S ABOUT?

153
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,458
- NO CLUE.

154
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,666
HEY, CHECK IT OUT.

155
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,250
SOME KIND OF BLACK
STUFF IS FLOWING

156
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,000
OUT OF THAT TREE OVER THERE.

157
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,375
IT'S LIKE IT'S BEING
SUCKED OUT BY THAT LIGHT.

158
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,291
- I WONDER WHAT COULD DO THAT?

159
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,708
- YOU DON'T THINK
THAT LIGHT

160
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,208
COULD BE COMING FROM
WHEREVER NIRVANA IS, DO YOU?

161
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,125
- BUT IF THAT'S THE CASE,

162
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,500
THAT MEANS SOMEONE'S ALREADY
GOT THEIR HANDS ON IT.

163
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:48,166
- WAS IT THE ALLIED FORCES
OR THE ORACION SEIS?

164
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,083
HIBIKI, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON?

165
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:55,625
CAN YOU READ ME? HEY!

166
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:59,166
- THIS MAGIC ENERGY MUST
BE BLOCKING OUR TELEPATHY.

167
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,583
- NOW WHAT?

168
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,458
- I THINK WE SHOULD SPLIT UP.

169
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,875
I'LL CONTINUE
THE SEARCH FOR WENDY.

170
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,833
- SOUNDS GOOD.
I'LL GO FIND OUT

171
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,541
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT LIGHT.
BE CAREFUL.

172
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,500
- I KNOW HE'S GOT TO
BE HERE SOMEWHERE.

173
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:24,166
- SOMEONE'S GOT TO PAY
FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO MY LOVE.

174
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,416
- WHERE ARE YOU?!

175
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,833
ANSWER ME, LYON! HEY!

176
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,916
CAN YOU HEAR ME?! LYON!

177
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,125
- HE'S THE ONE.

178
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:41,083
- WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT'S THAT LIGHT?

179
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,583
- IT'S NIRVANA! OH YEAH!

180
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,541
- ( gasps )

181
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,458
- THERE'S NO REASON FOR
YOU TO GET ALL WORKED UP.

182
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,500
ITS MAIN OPERATION HASN'T
BEEN ACTIVATED YET.

183
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:53,208
THE LIGHT SIMPLY MEANS
ITS SEAL HAS BEEN BROKEN.

184
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,958
IT'S ALSO A SIGN

185
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,791
WE'RE ABOUT TO BE
ROLLING IN DOUGH.

186
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,083
OH YEAH!
( giggles )

187
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,416
- FIGHTING THIS BUFFOON

188
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,500
WOULD BE A WASTE
OF MY PRECIOUS TIME.

189
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,916
ON THE OTHER HAND,
DEFEATING THE ORACION SEIS

190
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,916
IS THE SOLE PURPOSE
OF OUR MISSION.

191
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
SHOULD I STAY HERE AND FIGHT?

192
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,250
OR SHOULD I GO
STOP NIRVANA? 

193
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,625
- ( giggling continues )

194
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,083
MONEY!  MONEY!

195
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,625
WE'RE ABOUT TO BECOME
INCREDIBLY WEALTHY!

196
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,625
( gasps )

197
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,625
( whimpers )

198
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,083
- ( gasps )

199
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:31,333
- ( screams )

200
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:34,083
- WHAT HAS GOTTEN INTO HIM?

201
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,541
- COME ON, WE HAVE
TO GO AFTER NATSU.

202
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:40,000
- WHY? WHY WOULD HE MENTION
JELLAL OUT OF NOWHERE?

203
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,500
- I CAN EXPLAIN LATER.

204
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,000
RIGHT NOW, WE'VE
GOT TO GO FIND HIM.

205
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,333
- Carla: ( shrieks )

206
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,250
ERZA HAS GONE MISSING.

207
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,458
I SWEAR, WHERE
ARE HER MANNERS?

208
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,333
SHE DIDN'T EVEN THANK WENDY
FOR SAVING HER LIFE.

209
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,750
- UH-OH, DO YOU THINK
SHE MIGHT HAVE HEARD

210
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,125
US MENTION JELLAL'S NAME?

211
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,416
- HOW COULD I BE SO STUPID?

212
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,541
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

213
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:07,666
WHAT DID I DO?
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE HEALED HIM.

214
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,833
IT'S MY FAULT THAT
NIRVANA WAS FOUND,

215
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,833
ERZA DISAPPEARED, 
AND NATSU RAN OFF.

216
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,750
- WENDY!

217
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,083
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING, STRIKING A GIRL?

218
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,375
- I GOT TO FIND JELLAL.

219
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,500
- IF YOU THINK YOU'RE
GONNA GET PAST

220
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,125
MEMBERS OF RACER'S
HARPYIA GUILD,

221
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,583
YOU'RE JUST AS
DUMB AS YOU LOOK.

222
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,375
- LET'S GET HIM, GUYS!
- ( cheering )

223
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:43,333
- GET OUT OF MY WAY,
SPEED FREAKS!

224
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:46,041
- ( screams )

225
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,500
- I'M NOT LETTING THAT JERK
GET NEAR ERZA.

226
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,833
I'LL BURN HIM
TO A CRISP!

227
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,916
- I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T
MEAN TO SCARE YOU.

228
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,833
BUT SHE'S GONNA BE FINE.
I JUST KNOCKED HER OUT.

229
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,583
- WHY'D YOU DO IT? AND WHY ARE
WE SUDDENLY IN A HURRY?

230
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,541
- WE'VE GOT TO CATCH UP
WITH NATSU AND ERZA.

231
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,541
JUST KEEP RUNNING TILL
YOU REACH THE LIGHT.

232
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,375
- WHY SHOULD WE TAKE ORDERS
FROM A BRUTE LIKE YOU?

233
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,583
I REALIZE WENDY CAN
BE A BIT OF WHINER.

234
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,666
THAT'S NO REASON
FOR YOU TO STRIKE HER.

235
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,833
- NOT COOL, DUDE.

236
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:15,750
- I DID IT
BECAUSE I HAD TO.

237
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,208
I HAVEN'T BEEN
COMPLETELY HONEST.

238
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,041
I KNOW A LOT MORE
ABOUT NIRVANA

239
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:27,541
THAN I ORIGINALLY LET ON.
- WHAT?  WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US?

240
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,333
- I COULDN'T.
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE THE MAGIC,

241
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,083
I COULDN'T SAY A WORD.
EVEN JUST MENTIONING IT NOW,

242
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,166
IS RISKY AND MIGHT
PUT US IN DANGER.

243
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:40,333
THAT'S WHY GUILD MASTER BOB
ONLY TOLD ME ABOUT IT.

244
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:43,291
MR. ICHIYA, REN, AND EVE
HAVE NO CLUE.

245
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,750
- SO WHAT DID HE TELL YOU?

246
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:48,250
- NIRVANA IS A TERRIFYING MAGIC
LIKE NO OTHER.

247
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,750
IT ALONE HAS THE ABILITY...

248
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,083
TO TURN LIGHT
INTO DARKNESS.

249
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,625
- ARE YOU FOR REAL?
- MY WORD.

250
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,416
- IT CAN SWITCH THEM?

251
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,125
- BUT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN
UNTIL ITS FINAL STAGE.

252
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,375
THE FIRST THING IT DOES
WHEN IT'S BEEN UNSEALED

253
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,666
IS SHOOT OFF A BLACK BEAM JUST
LIKE THE ONE IN FRONT OF US.

254
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,625
THEN IT GOES IN SEARCH
OF THOSE WHO ARE WEAK.

255
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:13,083
IT'LL SWITCH ANYONE WAVERING
BETWEEN LIGHT AND DARK

256
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,416
TO THE OPPOSITE ALIGNMENT.

257
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,708
IN OTHER WORDS, A GOOD GUY
WHO'S FEELING DOWN AND OUT...

258
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,541
WILL LIKELY FALL 
TO THE DARK SIDE.

259
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,416
- SO THAT'S WHY.
YOU KNOCKED WENDY UNCONSCIOUS

260
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,875
TO PROTECT HER.

261
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,708
- HOW COULD I BE SO STUPID?
WHAT DID I DO?

262
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,666
I NEVER SHOULD
HAVE HEALED HIM.

263
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,666
- SHE WAS AT HIGH RISK
OF BECOMING A TARGET

264
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,041
BECAUSE OF HER GUILT.

265
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,458
IF I HADN'T STEPPED IN
WHEN I DID,

266
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,166
SHE EASILY COULD
HAVE SWITCHED OVER

267
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,208
TO THE DARK SIDE.
- NOW YOU'VE GOT ME WORRIED?

268
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,291
IS ANGER A NEGATIVE EMOTION?

269
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,500
IF SO, NATSU'S IN DANGER.

270
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,250
- Hibiki: THAT'S A TOUGH CALL.

271
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,958
NORMALLY IT WOULD BE,

272
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,083
BUT BECAUSE HIS ANGER
IS FOR SOMEONE ELSE'S SAKE,

273
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:00,125
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU COULD
CLASSIFY IT THAT WAY.

274
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,833
- I FEEL LIKE A DUMMY.
NOTHING YOU'RE SAYING 

275
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,291
MAKES ANY SENSE TO ME.
- BECAUSE YOU ARE A DUMMY.

276
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,833
ALLOW ME TO
SPELL IT OUT FOR YOU.

277
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,500
NOW THAT NIRVANA'S SEAL
HAS BEEN BROKEN,

278
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,291
IT HAS THE POWER TO TURN
THOSE WITH GOOD HEARTS EVIL

279
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,083
AND THOSE
WITH EVIL HEARTS GOOD.

280
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,708
DO YOU GET IT NOW, BLOCKHEAD?

281
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,500
- I KEPT QUIET
ABOUT IT AT FIRST

282
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,625
BECAUSE IF I TOLD YOU WHAT
I KNEW, YOU'D BE AT RISK.

283
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,666
THINKING IN TERMS
OF GOOD AND EVIL 

284
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,541
CAN BRING NEGATIVE EMOTIONS
TO THE SURFACE.

285
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,291
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
THEY'VE TAKEN HOLD OF YOU.

286
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:32,166
"IF ONLY THAT PERSON
DIDN'T EXIST..."

287
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,541
"WHOSE FAULT IS IT
THAT I'M IN PAIN?"

288
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,041
"WHY DOES THIS
ALWAYS HAPPEN TO ME?"

289
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:41,291
THESE PESSIMISTIC THOUGHTS
ATTRACT NIRVANA

290
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,916
AND ALLOW IT TO TAKE CONTROL.

291
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,291
- WHAT THE--

292
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:52,000
( groans )

293
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,958
- I HAVE AVENGED YOU, 
MY BELOVED SWEET LYON.

294
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,416
WHO SHALL BE
MY NEXT VICTIM?

295
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,416
PERHAPS ONE OF HIS FRIENDS,

296
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,625
ANOTHER MEMBER OF
THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD?

297
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,791
- ( screaming )

298
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,125
MONEY, MONEY, MONEY, MONEY!

299
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,291
- IT'S AS IF HE'S
BEEN POSSESSED!

300
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,583
- MONEY...

301
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,333
IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL.
OH YEAH.

302
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,625
- THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID
JUST A MINUTE AGO.

303
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,958
- YOU SEE, I'VE BEEN 
DESPERATELY SEARCHING

304
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,875
FOR MY LONG-LOST
YOUNGER BROTHER.

305
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,208
AND I THOUGHT THAT IF
I ACCUMULATED ENOUGH MONEY,

306
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:36,041
I WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND HIM.
OH YEAH.

307
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:39,250
HOWEVER, NOW I REALIZE
HOW FOOLISH IT WAS OF ME

308
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,083
TO THINK THAT WAY.

309
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,125
I WAS WRONG.
- HUH?!

310
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,166
- JURA, WHY DON'T WE BURY
THE HATCHET AND BECOME FRIENDS?

311
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,750
OH YEAH.

312
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,166
THE WORLD AROUND US
IS OVERFLOWING WITH LOVE,

313
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:55,041
OH, YEAH, FULL TO BURSTING WITH
SUCH SWEETNESS AND COMPASSION.

314
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,458
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE
WHEN YOU HAVE

315
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,291
THE POWER OF LOVE
ON YOUR SIDE.

316
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,416
OH YEAH!

317
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,083
WHAT DO YOU SAY 
WE WORK TOGETHER

318
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,291
TO PUT AN END TO
MY FORMER COMRADES' PLANS?

319
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,541
WE MUST TEACH THEM THE WONDERS
OF PEACE, LOVE, AND HARMONY.

320
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:08,833
ARE YOU WITH ME?

321
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,875
- YEAH.

322
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,291
SURE.

323
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,291
- WHITE FURY!

324
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,375
( screams )

325
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,916
( grunts )

326
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,791
- ONE DOWN AND SEVEN TO GO.

327
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,500
MAN, HE'S SO MUCH
STRONGER THAN ME.

328
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,166
MY MAGIC'S
USELESS AGAINST HIM.

329
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:43,208
- HEY, YOU STILL ALIVE
DOWN THERE?

330
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,291
- ( groans )

331
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:47,291
( screams )

332
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,375
- I LOVE WATCHING
MY PREY SUFFER.

333
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,833
- SO WHENEVER NIRVANA
IS FULLY ACTIVATED,

334
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,750
EVERYBODY IN THE ALLIANCE
COULD SUDDENLY TURN EVIL?

335
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,833
- ONE QUESTION.
I UNDERSTAND THE PART ABOUT

336
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,458
IT TURNING US EVIL,
BUT DOES THAT MEAN 

337
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,583
IT'LL TURN
THE DARK GUILD GUYS GOOD?

338
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,208
- IT'S POSSIBLE, BUT THERE'S
NO WAY OF KNOWING FOR SURE.

339
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,125
WHAT MAKES NIRVANA
TRULY TERRIFYING

340
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:08,666
IS THE FACT THAT
IT CAN BE CONTROLLED

341
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,583
TO DO WHATEVER
ITS CASTER SEES FIT.

342
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:13,041
- WHAT?
- I'LL EXPLAIN.

343
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:16,208
LET'S SAY THAT A WIZARD WAS
TO USE NIRVANA AGAINST A GUILD.

344
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,916
THEY COULD HAVE THE MEMBERS
START KILLING EACH OTHER

345
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,666
OR MAKE THEM GO TO WAR WITH
ANOTHER GUILD FOR NO REASON.

346
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,416
AND THEY'D BARELY HAVE
TO LIFT A FINGER.

347
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,333
- SERIOUSLY?!

348
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:29,500
- WE'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY
TO STOP IT AND FAST...

349
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:36,541
OTHERWISE THE LIGHT GUILDS
WILL BE WIPED OUT.

350
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,666
- ( end theme playing )

351
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:50,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

352
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:15,375
- Happy: I'M THINKING YOUR COLOR
WOULD BE RED, NATSU.

353
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:17,000
- HUH?  WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

354
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:19,208
- WHAT COLOR DO YOU THINK
REPRESENTS YOU THE BEST?

355
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,583
I'D SAY RED 'CAUSE
YOU USE FIRE MAGIC.

356
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:24,041
AND GRAY SHOULD BE BLUE
BECAUSE HE USES ICE MAGIC.

357
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:26,333
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
I THOUGHT BLUE WAS YOUR COLOR,

358
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:28,458
LITTLE BUDDY.
- YOU'RE RIGHT!

359
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:30,208
BOTH OF US CAN'T BE BLUE!

360
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:33,083
( Happy and Natsu speaking )

361
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:35,541
- Happy: WHAT IF I SWITCH
TO SOMETHING COOL LIKE BLACK?

362
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:37,375
- NO, I THINK
THAT'S LUCY'S COLOR.

363
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:38,541
- YEAH, YOU'VE GOT A POINT.

364
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:39,625
SHE'S GOT THE BLACKEST HEART

365
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:41,250
OF ANYONE IN FAIRY TAIL.
