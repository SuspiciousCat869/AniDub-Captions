00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:06,041
Um... You keep
staring at me.

160
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,250
I know celestial wizards
are kind of rare...

161
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,208
Have you...

162
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,750
...met any of us before?

163
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,958
No, nothing like that...

164
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,958
I don't mean to be creepy...

165
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,208
It's just that you look...

166
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,416
...like somebody that
I used to know.

167
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,541
Oh really, I do?

168
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,041
I know they're flat,
so don't stare!

169
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,958
I didn't even say anything!

170
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,333
[LAHAR] Would you
stop playing around?

171
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,875
[DORANBOLT]
Sorry, I deserved that.

172
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:35,958
No... I'm the one

173
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,958
who should
apologize to you.

174
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,875
So... who is this girl
that resembles me?

175
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,625
Unfortunately, she passed away
about seven years ago...

176
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,958
But that's...
because I failed her.

177
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,541
[KATJA] You know...

178
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,708
In a strange way...
I envy her.

179
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:56,375
I mean...

180
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:57,583
She's been gone awhile...

181
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,000
...but she's able
to live on in the

182
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,833
thoughts of those who knew her.

183
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,250
I'd love to have
someone like that.

184
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,500
But no...

185
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:08,000
...even after a hundred
years, I'll have no one.

186
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:17,750
[KATJA] It may sound odd...

187
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,291
...but I gave up
hope a long time ago.

188
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,416
[KATJA] I lost most of
my friends in the attacks...

189
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,625
I'm afraid it's only a matter
of time before I join them.

190
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:27,916
You've given up on...

191
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,250
...what?

192
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,208
On living...

193
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,208
...in the here and now.

194
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,791
I see.

195
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,208
[KATJA] I'm resigned
to my fate...

196
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,166
So I thought I'd
take in as much of

197
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,500
this era's scenery as I can...

198
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,166
...while I'm here.

199
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,375
But we can protect you...

200
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,041
Katja, I...

201
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,625
Don't listen to me.

202
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,708
[LAHAR] Excuse me...

203
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,250
May I ask...

204
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:03,083
...are you being sheltered by
the church for some reason?

205
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,291
[KATJA] Yes...

206
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,708
Who are you...?
And who were your friends?

207
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,208
We can help!

208
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,458
Caelum, no!

209
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,666
We're not alone here!

210
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,416
Hey look out!
He's behind you!

211
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,083
I found you.

212
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,791
[DORANBOLT]
Don't worry, I've got ya!

213
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,208
[LAHAR] Be careful, Mest...!

214
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,875
He's dangerous!

215
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,416
Yeah, He's with
the Neo-Oración Seis...

216
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,750
Racer!

217
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:38,916
[RACER] Destroy...

218
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,375
...vessel...

219
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,583
[CARDINAL 143A]
Time is a luxury we don't have.

220
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,041
[CARDINAL 143B] Word of
the archbishop's madness

221
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,666
has begun to
spread to the outside.

222
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,166
[CARDINAL 143C] We should
select a new archbishop

223
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,833
and continue with
 the Founding Festival!

224
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,708
[LAPOINTE]
Everyone calm down...!

225
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,625
Selecting a new Archbishop is
absolutely out of the question,

226
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,458
especially now that the
Infinity Clock is lost to us...

227
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,083
The archbishop is
the sole pillar

228
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,583
of order to our followers...

229
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,750
If we replace him, confusion
and chaos would run rampant!

230
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,083
[CARDINAL 143D]
But, your Eminence...

231
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,083
[CARDINAL 143E]
Is that really wise?

232
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,416
[LAPOINTE]
Pathetic, lowly insects...

233
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,541
Even if they did replace
their precious leader

234
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,666
it would do them no good.

235
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,625
[LAPOINTE] The end is
finally within our grasp.

236
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,083
[RACER] Destroy...

237
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,500
...the vessel...

238
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,333
Destroy!

239
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,291
[RACER] You're a very quick one.
I will have fun destroying you.

240
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,291
Lahar, take Katja and run!

241
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,708
I'll keep her safe.

242
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:42,791
But what about you?

243
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,333
Just get out of here, alright?!

244
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,791
Are you sure...

245
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,416
He can take care
of himself...

246
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,208
There's no need
for you to worry.

247
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,750
[LAHAR] He may not look it,
but he's a skilled wizard...

248
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,333
Believe me.

249
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,875
[LAHAR] If there's anyone who
can handle this guy, it's Mest.

250
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,541
Thank you...
Please, be careful.

251
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,666
You know, I've abandoned
a lot of things...

252
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,125
But losing my humanity is
a line I'd never cross.

253
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,333
[RACER] Destroy!

254
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,875
Okay, monster...

255
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,000
Let's see which
one of us is faster!

256
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,625
[DORANBOLT] I get it...

257
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:23,916
You're pretty quick...

258
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,791
But I'm just warming up!

259
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,208
[DORANBOLT] Direct Line!

260
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,541
This guy is so fast it's hard
to see what he's doing...

261
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,541
[DORANBOLT] But from
what I can tell, it looks like

262
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,166
he's moving in simple,
straight lines...

263
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,875
My Direct Line
isn't as restrictive,

264
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,666
so all I gotta do
is circle around him.

265
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,166
I can see your movements...

266
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,583
...fool.

267
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,500
[DORANBOLT] Damn...

268
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,458
I spent way too much
time getting hammered.

269
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:52,791
This is rough...

270
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:54,458
[RACER] What's wrong...?

271
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,500
Am I too fast?.

272
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,083
Sorry about that.

273
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,791
This is nothing...
My warm up...

274
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,875
Time for round two.

275
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,541
[ERIGOR] Make it stop!

276
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:05,583
[ERIGOR] Get out of my head!

277
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,541
I don't want any memories!

278
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,958
[BIXLOW] Looks like this
freak's mind is turnin' on him.

279
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:10,666
[WENDY] Huh?

280
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,375
Stay away, Kageyama...!

281
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,500
I can't hear myself think!

282
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,541
[BIXLOW] His memories
are trying to come to the

283
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,416
surface but something
else is pushing 'em back.

284
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,458
[BIXLOW] Whatever
you did to remind him is

285
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,125
tearing him apart
from the inside out.

286
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,791
I wanna help him.

287
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,166
If my Healing magic started
this, maybe I can use it to

288
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,208
stop whatever's
blocking his mind.

289
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,625
You really wanna help the
guy who's trying to kill us?!

290
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,291
I have to!

291
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,125
[ERIGOR] You...!

292
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,916
Die!

293
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,333
Sky Dragon Healing...

294
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,875
Roar!

295
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,875
There'll be nothing left
when I'm through with you!

296
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,041
[WENDY] Remember!

297
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,875
[BIXLOW] Geez, 
this kid is pushy!

298
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:00,750
[ERIGOR (YOUNG)] Hey!

299
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:05,333
Do you have any idea how
pathetic you look right now...?

300
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,958
I find it hard to
believe I'd give up

301
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,458
so much just for power.

302
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,333
[ERIGOR] I know you...

303
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,666
You're me.

304
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,750
Something seriously nasty
just popped out of his soul.

305
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:26,125
He's in pain...
'cause of me...

306
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,416
All I wanted was
to heal his mind...

307
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,333
...but I ended up
hurting him instead.

308
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:32,583
[BIXLOW]
Hey may look rough...

309
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,166
But he'll be just fine...

310
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,833
Whatever was clouding
his mind is gone now.

311
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,875
[BIXLOW]
You done good, Wendy.

312
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,875
[LAHAR]
Could you explain it to me?

313
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,541
[KATJA] Yes...

314
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,208
The attacks on the churches
are just a side-effect...

315
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,750
The true goal of
the Neo-Oración Seis

316
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,833
is to perform Anti-Link rites.

317
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,791
What's an "Anti-Link"?

318
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,541
Since Zentopia
was founded,

319
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,458
there's been an
underground society...

320
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:02,958
It's managed to
remain hidden from the

321
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,416
powers that be since
its inception.

322
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,625
[KATJA] They've worked
to keep the Celestial wizards

323
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,041
of Neville safe and
sheltered all this time.

324
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,458
Neville...?

325
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,416
I'd heard he was
a Celestial wizard...

326
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,250
...but it has never
been confirmed.

327
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,541
He was many things...

328
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,708
Including a great teacher
who had many pupils.

329
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,000
We're their descendants...

330
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,750
Biological links to his work.

331
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,083
[LAHAR] What do you mean?

332
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,375
[KATJA] It's our job
to protect his legacy...

333
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,375
...for as long
as we're still living.

334
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,500
[KATJA]
These crests symbolize that...

335
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:36,166
Our duty... as well
as our greatest curse.

336
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,250
I'm deeply sorry
for your burden...

337
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,916
I can't even fathom it...

338
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,208
But your friends...

339
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,083
...they are neither
alive nor dead...

340
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,500
What happened to them?

341
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,250
[KATJA] Well...
you see...

342
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,625
Run for it...

343
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,208
Wendy...

344
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,875
[LAHAR] No!

345
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,916
Once I perform the
Amplitude Limiter Anti-Link...

346
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,750
...your pain will end.

347
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,041
[KATJA THINKS] This is it...

348
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,500
I knew this day would come.

349
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,500
What just
happened here?

350
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:36,166
Beats me... But I
could sure use a drink...

351
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,791
Are you okay?

352
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:39,833
[DORANBOLT] Oh, no!

353
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,875
[DORANBOLT]
But she wasn't hit...

354
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,250
Was she?!

355
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,375
[DORANBOLT] Katja...!
C'mon, stay with me!

356
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,000
[Racer laughs]

357
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,791
The Anti-Link
has been completed.

[thunder]

359
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,791
[MIDNIGHT] At last we meet...
Will Neville.

360
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:11,125
You've picked a rather dreary
place to rest for eternity...

361
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,125
Can't say I envy you.

362
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,458
Guess what...?

363
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:17,375
I've taken care of
your pupils for you...

364
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,375
And I didn't hear
a single 'thank you.'

365
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,583
Don't worry...

366
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,875
I'll take care of
your legacy as well...

367
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,125
Every bit of it...

368
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:29,458
After all, nightmares
are my specialty.

369
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:33,708
[DORANBOLT]
Good, you're awake...

370
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,791
You're not hurt, are you?

371
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,583
No, I'm fine...

372
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:38,875
But what about you?

373
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,583
You shouldn't
worry about me...

374
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,833
But can you tell us what
the hell just happened?

375
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,250
The Anti-Link
must've been activated...

376
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,500
I don't feel the
biological link anymore.

377
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,500
But it seems my curse
didn't take effect.

378
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,166
[LAHAR] Are you sure?

379
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,291
Because it looks as though
you've lost your magic power.

380
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:00,958
[KATJA] Nico...

381
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,500
Thanks for everything
you've done...

382
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,416
I'll never forget you
or the others, I swear.

00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:07,791
Yeah, you're right...

And, it won't be in
a hundred years...!

I'm sure...

...we'll meet again soon.

388
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,208
So you can understand
what its saying?

389
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,625
Kind of...

390
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,791
I can only catch a little
bit here and there, but...

391
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,875
I'm pretty sure he's saying
"Thanks for helping."

392
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,583
[KATJA] He also says,
"Get your paw off her." 

393
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,416
[DORANBOLT] My bad!

394
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,625
I assume this means you're
no longer a Celestial wizard.

395
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,458
[DORANBOLT] I'm sorry...

396

When it came down to it...

397
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,666
I simply wasn't
able to protect you.

[KATJA] No, you're wrong...

399
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,375
You did protect me...

400
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,541
...from a horrific curse.

401
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:47,125
If you hadn't been here
I'd be as good as dead now...

So, thank you...
You saved my life.

You're my hero.

see now, Mest...?

00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,708
I think we've hit

[LAKI] It looks like...
she's still alive.

[GILDARTS] Who is she...?

And why is she tucked
away in this musty old cave?

heavy treatment here after a big
accident several years ago.

And what's strange,
is that even if she recovers,

00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,541
that lacrima will keep her
in a comatose state.

[HAPPY]
It must be the lunch bell!

477
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,458
Perfect timing too,
I was getting' hungry.

478
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,583
Bring on the noms!

479
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,166
[NATSU] Already?

480
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,333
In that case, let's stuff our
faces and put it on Lucy's tab!

481
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:25,708
[HAPPY] Aye, sir...!

482
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:26,791
Wait, look out!

483
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,250
Giant flying fish
at twelve o'clock!

484
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,333
[NATSU] Cool!

485
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:30,875
How about we just
eat that instead?!

486
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:33,666
[HAPPY AND NATSU]]
Next time: Despair Unleashed!

487
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,750
[HAPPY] Are you sure it's
even edible, Natsu?

488
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,666
[NATSU] Most things are,
if you put your mind to it.

489
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,500
[HAPPY] Really?
Then you can eat some rocks.

490
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,541
This fish is all mine.
