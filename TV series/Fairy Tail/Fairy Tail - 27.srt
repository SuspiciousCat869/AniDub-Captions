1
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,958
- HEY, GUYS! READY FOR
SOME MORE FAIRY TAIL?

2
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,666
JUST MAKE SURE THAT WHEN
YOU'RE WATCHING

3
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,291
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS
ON IN THE ROOM,

4
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,875
AND DON'T SIT TOO
CLOSE TO THE TV!

5
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,375
- Lucy: PREVIOUSLY
ON FAIRY TAIL!

6
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:30,916
- Happy: THINGS WERE
LOOKIN' GOOD

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,083
WHEN WE BEAT THE ELEMENT FOUR
AND STOPPED THE MAGIC GIANT

8
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,750
BUT THEN PHANTOM'S SUPER CREEPY
MASTER JOSE ATTACKED ERZA!

9
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:39,375
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, WHEN
NATSU TRIED TO SAVE LUCY,

10
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:40,875
HE ENDED UP IN A MAJOR BATTLE

11
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,166
WITH GAJEEL, THE
IRON DRAGON SLAYER,

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,958
WHO'S AS STRONG AS HE IS NASTY!

13
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:58,000
- ( theme song playing )

14
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,833
- ( Gajeel Laughing )

15
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,125
- GUESS IT AIN'T TOO HARD
TO CATCH A SALAMANDER

16
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,250
IF YA USE THE RIGHT BAIT.

17
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,291
UNLIKE YOU PHANTOM CREEPS,
I WATCH OUT FOR MY FRIENDS.

18
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,750
I WON'T LET YOU
LAY A HAND ON HER!

19
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:33,916
- NATSU!

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,458
- STAY BACK.
THIS COULD GET UGLY.

21
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,583
- GAJEEL!

22
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,125
- THIS ONE'S MINE!

23
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,500
- OH, YEAH?

24
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,958
- WE GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE!

25
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,666
- FIRE DRAGON TALON!

26
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,666
- WHOA.

27
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,041
- HEY, ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

28
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,208
- HAPPY!

29
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,291
- IS SOMETHIN' WRONG?

30
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:17,833
- NO, IT'S JUST-- I'VE NEVER
SEEN NATSU LIKE THIS.

31
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:21,250
- AYE. HE'S MORE FIRED UP
THAN EVER BEFORE.

32
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,833
I WOULDN'T WANNA
BE THAT OTHER GUY.

33
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,541
THE TWO DRAGON SLAYERS!

34
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:35,125
- FOR BEIN' FAIRY SCUM,
YOU SURE ARE COCKY.

35
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,250
- YOU'RE THE SCUM HERE, PAL!

36
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,458
AS PAYBACK FOR WHAT
YOU DID TO LUCY,

37
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:43,041
I'M GONNA USE MY FIRE POWER
TO MELT YOUR UGLY IRON FACE!

38
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:47,250
- ( laughs ) SOUNDS LIKE FUN.
SO GIVE IT A SHOT!

39
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,250
THAT'S A PRETTY
GNARLY LOOKIN' TOY!

40
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,916
- THIS IS THE IRON DRAGON SWORD!

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,791
ANYTHING IT TOUCHES
IS CUT TO SHREDS!

42
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:07,875
I THOUGHT I'D GIVE YOU

43
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,333
AN UP CLOSE AND
PERSONAL DEMONSTRATION!

44
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,458
- OH, I'M SO SCARED!

45
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:13,875
- HOW IS HE DOING THAT?

46
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,333
- IT'S IRON DRAGON SLAYER MAGIC!

47
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,375
- All: WE SERIOUSLY GOTTA
GET OUTTA HERE!

48
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:25,125
- C'MON! NOT SO COCKY
NOW, ARE YA, KID?

49
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:28,166
HUH? I THINK YOU'RE SCARED!

50
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,375
I'LL GIVE YA CREDIT FOR BEIN'
SUCH A NIMBLE LITTLE FAIRY!

51
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,375
- YOU'RE NO SLOUCH YOURSELF.

52
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:39,125
- BUT WE STILL GOT A SCORE TO
SETTLE FROM THE OTHER DAY.

53
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:42,625
NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT,
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?

54
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:46,666
- LET'S GO, RIVET FACE!
I'M ALL FIRED UP NOW!

55
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,166
- AS DRAGON SLAYERS,
THEY BOTH HAVE THE ABILITY

56
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,000
TO TAKE ON THE MYTHICAL
CREATURE'S POWERS,

57
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,208
WHICH MEANS THAT TWO WIZARDS
WHO ARE STRONG ENOUGH

58
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,333
TO SLAY DRAGONS ARE
ABOUT TO DUKE IT OUT

59
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,416
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

60
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,791
I DON'T LIKE
WHERE THIS IS GOING.

61
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,250
- ARE YOU READY, FAIRY?

62
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,333
- HE'S CHANGING!

63
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,750
- DRAGON SCALES!

64
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:13,666
- IRON DRAGON HARD FIST!

65
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,583
- WHAT'RE WE STILL DOIN' HERE?
- I DUNNO, BUT IT'S NOT SMART!

66
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:27,291
- HEARIN' YOU HIT THAT WALL WAS
LIKE MUSIC TO MY EARS.

67
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,875
- HE TOOK NATSU DOWN
WITH JUST ONE HIT!

68
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:33,083
- THAT'S 'CAUSE THOSE SCALES ON
HIS FIST ARE MADE OUTTA STEEL!

69
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:43,416
- IS THERE SERIOUSLY THAT MUCH
WIND COMING FROM HIS KICK?

70
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,708
- HIS ATTACKS ARE
TWICE AS STRONG

71
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,125
NOW THAT HE'S COVERED
IN THOSE DRAGON SCALES!

72
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,750
- POOR LITTLE FAIRY.
THAT HAD TO HURT, HUH?

73
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,041
HATE TO BREAK IT TO YA,

74
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:55,291
BUT YOUR PUNY HAND CAN'T
EVEN SCRATCH THIS STEEL.

75
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,666
- IT'S LIKE HE'S GOT
INDESTRUCTIBLE ARMOR!

76
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,208
- NATSU!

77
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,333
- ( Natsu screaming )

78
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:07,750
I'M FINE! THAT DIDN'T HURT
AT ALL! NOPE! NOT AT ALL!

79
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,083
- Lucy: YEAH, RIGHT.

80
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,708
- AYE.

81
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:14,583
- CUT THE ACT, PUNK! YOU JUST
DON'T WANT YOUR FRIENDS TO SEE

82
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,541
YOU CRY LIKE A BABY!

83
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,000
- ALRIGHT, YOU WALKIN'
GARBAGE CAN,

84
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:23,583
TIME TO BLOW YOU AWAY!
FIRE DRAGON.

85
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,916
- IRON DRAGON.

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,041
- WHAT?

87
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,500
- HE'S GOT A BREATH
ATTACK LIKE NATSU!

88
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,875
- ROAR!

89
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,666
- ROAR!

90
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,958
- ( groaning )

91
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:46,333
- TOLD YOU WE SHOULD'VE RUN.
- I NEVER SAID WE SHOULDN'T!

92
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,583
- Gajeel: LOOKS LIKE THERE ARE
SOME PRETTY BIG DIFFERENCES

93
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:52,625
BETWEEN FIRE AND IRON DRAGONS,
AREN'T THERE, SALAMANDER?

94
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,416
YOU COULD SHOWER ME WITH FLAME
ATTACKS

95
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,375
'TIL YOU RUN OUTTA HOT AIR BUT
IT'S NOT GONNA CRACK MY ARMOR.

96
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,791
ON THE OTHER HAND, JUST ONE OF
MY IRON BLADE BREATH ATTACKS CAN

97
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:06,000
RIP YOUR PUNY BODY TO SHREDS.

98
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,625
- NATSU.

99
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,666
- COME ON. TAKE HIM!

100
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,125
I CAN'T CRACK YOUR ARMOR, HUH?

101
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,666
SURE YOU'RE NOT
FEELIN' A DRAFT, BUDDY?

102
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,333
- Lucy: HE DID IT!

103
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:21,416
- LOOK, I DON'T JUST BREATHE
REGULAR OL' FIRE.

104
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,750
THE FIRE DRAGON'S ROAR CAN
DESTROY ANYTHING IT TOUCHES!

105
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,625
I THINK IT'S TIME WE
STOPPED PLAYIN' AROUND!

106
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,458
LET'S GET DOWN TO
THE REAL FIGHT!

107
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,416
I'M GONNA SHATTER YOU
INTO A MILLION PIECES.

108
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,708
- ( laughs ) LET'S GO!

109
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,791
- WHOA! THEY'RE GETTIN' SERIOUS!

110
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,708
THEY WERE JUST
PLAYIN' AROUND BEFORE?

111
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,458
- THEY SOME KINDA MONSTERS?

112
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,375
- YEP, THEY'RE BOTH
DRAGON SLAYERS ALRIGHT!

113
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,125
- THEY'RE AMAZING.

114
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:50,000
AND THEY'RE BOTH
PRACTICALLY HALF-NAKED, TOO!

115
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,833
- BLACK STEEL, I'M READY
WHEN YOU ARE.

116
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:56,083
- THE SKY'S NOT BIG ENOUGH
FOR TWO DRAGONS, KID.

117
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,666
SO I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO
TAKE YOU DOWN, SALAMANDER!

118
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,166
- NATSU.

119
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,250
- THAT THING'S GOT
CREEPY HANDS EVERYWHERE.

120
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,958
- THAT'S THE LEAST OF
OUR WORRIES!

121
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,375
- YEAH, THIS IS BAD.

122
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:26,875
- ( people clamoring )

123
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,958
- THAT MONSTER'S TRYIN' TO
TEAR DOWN OUR GUILD HALL!

124
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,291
Man 1: SHOOT IT DOWN!

125
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,916
Man 2: KILL IT!

126
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,083
- ( screaming )

127
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,625
- DID THEY REALLY JUST DO THAT?

128
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,000
- THEY'RE FLYIN'!

129
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,958
- WHOA. WHAT'S HAPNIN' UP THERE?

130
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,666
- FIREWORKS?

131
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,791
- WHAT THE...

132
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,291
- HE'S ACTUALLY KEEPIN'
UP WITH THE BOSS.

133
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,958
- THAT'S CRAZY.

134
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,083
- NOW WE GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE!

135
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,833
- IS THAT KID BEATING GAJEEL?

136
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:28,500
NO, LOOK! SALAMANDER'S
OUTTA BREATH, TOO!

137
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:32,625
- WHAT?

138
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,625
HOLD UP, THAT'S NOT FAIR,
MAN! YOU'RE EATING?

139
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,000
- SO WHAT?

140
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,875
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE REALLY EATS IRON!

141
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,541
- I WONDER
IF IT TASTES ANY GOOD.

142
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,708
- NOW I'VE GOT
A FIRE IN MY BELLY!

143
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,750
- HEY, THAT'S MY LINE, PAL!

144
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,375
- WAIT A MINUTE, WHERE'D HE
GET ALL THIS ENERGY FROM?

145
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,083
- IT'S 'CAUSE HE ATE
ALL THAT IRON!

146
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,708
WHEN DRAGON SLAYERS
EAT THEIR ELEMENT,

147
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:58,541
THEY REPLENISH THEIR MAGIC
ENERGY AND INCREASE THEIR POWER!

148
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,625
- SO NATSU NEEDS TO EAT FIRE!

149
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,666
- THAT WOULD HELP. BUT
HE CAN'T EAT HIS OWN FIRE.

150
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,458
IT HAS TO COME FROM SOME
KINDA OUTSIDE SOURCE.

151
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:10,208
- YEAH THAT'S RIGHT! BUT HOW CAN
WE MAKE THAT HAPPEN?

152
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,291
- SAY GOODNIGHT, FAIRY!

153
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:16,375
IRON DRAGON LANCE DEMON LOG!

154
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,416
- COME ON, THINK! FIRE, FIRE.
DO I HAVE ANY KINDA FIRE SPIRIT?

155
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,750
OH, YEAH. I LOST MY KEYS
WHEN I WAS ATTACKED.

156
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:34,250
THE ONLY ONE I HAVE ON ME
IS THE NEW ONE, SAGITTARIUS.

157
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:39,416
WE HAVEN'T WORKED OUT
A CONTRACT YET.

158
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,291
BUT I DON'T CARE! THIS IS THE
ONLY CHANCE WE'VE GOT RIGHT NOW!

159
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:57,333
- ( people screaming )

160
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:01,333
- NO! LEMME GO!
I GOTTA STOP THAT THING!

161
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,250
C'MON, THERE'S NOTHIN'
YOU CAN DO!

162
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,000
- I CALL UPON THEE, IN THE WORLD
OF THE CELESTIAL SPIRITS!

163
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:13,125
I BECKON YOU TO MY SIDE AT ONCE.
PASS THROUGH THE GATE!

164
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,791
OPEN GATE OF THE ARCHER!

165
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,666
SAGITTARIUS!

166
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,208
- HORSE!

167
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,458
WELL, HOWDY-DOO, MY LADY!

168
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,333
- WOW! THAT REALLY WORKED!

169
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,333
- WHAT'S WITH THE HORSE COSTUME?

170
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:38,750
- I'LL EXPLAIN WHY LATER. BUT I
NEED TO KNOW IF YOU SHOOT FIRE!

171
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:42,916
- NO. BUT I AM QUITE PROFICIENT
IN ARCHERY. YES, INDEED!

172
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,250
- UH, OKAY.

173
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,833
- WHO DOES HE THINK
HE'S SALUTING OVER THERE?

174
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,750
- LUCY! YOU GUYS BETTER
GET OUTTA THE WAY.

175
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:50,583
- AYE!

176
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:51,875
- TOODLE-LOO!

177
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,708
- GEEZ, I FEEL SO
COMPLETELY USELESS!

178
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,458
- AW, C'MON,
YOU GOTTA STAY POSITIVE!

179
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,291
- YES, SIREE!

180
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:04,958
- HERE GOES!
FIRE DRAGON SWORD HORN!

181
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:08,500
- I GOT A FIRE IN MY BELLY
BUT WHERE'S YOURS?

182
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,583
WHY DON'T YOU EAT SOME IRON?

183
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,083
- Sue: THAT'S BRUTAL.
- GAJEEL'S CRAZY STRONG.

184
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,375
- MAYBE JUST PLAIN CRAZY, TOO.

185
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,125
- I THINK I'VE HAD
MY FUN WITH YOU.

186
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:27,083
SO GET LOST, SCUMBAG.

187
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,791
- HE'S DOWN!

188
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,000
NO. THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

189
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:42,208
NATSU CAN'T JUST
LOSE, CAN HE? GET UP!

190
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,666
- ( Gajeel laughing )

191
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,166
HEY! TAKE A LOOK AT
YOUR GUILD HALL!

192
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,666
WE'RE DOIN' SOME REDECORATING!

193
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,291
- TAKE COVER! IT'S COMIN' DOWN!

194
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,458
- Young Natsu: WHOA,
THIS PLACE IS HUGE!

195
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,833
SO THIS IS A WIZARD GUILD, HUH?

196
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,375
Makarov: YEP, IT'S
CALLED FAIRY TAIL.

197
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,916
- THAT'S A WEIRD NAME.

198
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,500
- YES, BUT, YOU SEE,

199
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,458
NOBODY KNOWS WHETHER
OR NOT FAIRIES HAVE TAILS,

200
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:28,666
OR IF THEY EVEN EXIST. SO
IT'LL FOREVER BE A MYSTERY

201
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,416
UNLESS WE TRY TO FIND OUT,

202
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,041
WHICH COULD BECOME AN
AMAZING ADVENTURE.

203
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,916
AND OUR MEMBERS ARE THE ONES
WHO WOULD WANT TO FIND OUT.

204
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,958
- I DON'T GET IT BUT
IT SOUNDS AWESOME!

205
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,000
- HEY. WHAT'S YOUR DEAL? YOU GOT
A PROBLEM WITH ME OR SOMETHIN'?

206
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:45,958
- WHAT IF I DO?

207
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,333
- OH, THEY GONNA FIGHT?

208
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,375
- NO WAY.

209
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:49,541
- GRAY, YOUR CLOTHES!

210
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,583
- AW, MAN!

211
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,041
- GEEZ, WHAT A PERVERT.

212
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,833
- WHO YOU CALLIN'
A PERVERT, PINKY?

213
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,666
- YOU! YA LOUDMOUTHED STREAKER!

214
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,833
- YOU BETTER--

215
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,541
- WELL, FEISTY ONE, EH?

216
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,458
- HE'LL FIT RIGHT IN!

217
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,750
- WHAT? YA WANT SOME
OF THIS, TOO, RED?

218
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,041
- DON'T DO IT!

219
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,541
- WHAT TOTAL IDIOTS!

220
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,458
- BUT WHY ME, TOO?

221
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,625
- YOU'RE NOT TO FIGHT!
ARE WE CLEAR?

222
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,166
- YES MA'AM!

223
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,791
- WHOA. SCARY!

224
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,791
- HEY, KID, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

225
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,166
- NATSU.

226
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,666
- NATSU, HUH? LET'S
GET ONE THING STRAIGHT.

227
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,458
EVERYONE IN FAIRY TAIL
TREATS EACH OTHER LIKE FAMILY

228
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,583
AND THIS GUILD HALL
IS LIKE OUR HOME.

229
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,791
IT'S NOT A PLACE FOR FIGHTING.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

230
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,708
- YEAH.

231
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,666
- WELCOME TO FAIRY
TAIL. I'M ERZA.

232
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,750
- SHE'S MEAN.

233
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,250
- FOR REAL.

234
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,083
- BYE! COME BACK SOON!

235
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,583
- WHERE'RE YOU GOIN'?

236
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,583
- I GOT MY FIRST REAL MAGIC JOB!

237
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:08,000
- DID YOU EVEN BOTHER TO READ
THE WHOLE FLIER FIRST?

238
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:12,083
- WELL, YEAH. IT SAYS, "PLEASE
GET RID OF THIS THINGY

239
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:15,708
THAT'S SOMEWHERE DOIN'
SOMETHIN' TO SOMEONE."

240
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,250
FOR 50,000 JEWEL!

241
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,625
- IT DOESN'T SAY THAT!

242
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,041
- LAY OFF, OKAY?

243
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,791
- ARE YOU TELLIN' ME
YOU'RE SO STUPID

244
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,500
ALL YOU WERE ABLE TO READ OFF
OF THAT FLIER WAS THE REWARD?

245
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,375
- BE NICE, MIRA!

246
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,875
- I CAN READ!

247
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:32,083
IGNEEL TAUGHT ME HOW TO READ
AND WRITE WHEN I WAS LITTLE!

248
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,125
IT'S JUST THAT NOTHING
ON THIS STUPID FLIER

249
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,458
MAKES ANY SENSE TO ME!

250
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,041
- AW, IT'S OKAY.

251
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:41,291
- I KNOW THE NAMES OF ALL KINDS
OF DIFFERENT FOODS! HAMBURGER!

252
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:45,666
SPAGHETTI! RICE BOWLS!
CAKE AND COOKIES! STEW AND SOUP!

253
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,125
AND I KNOW--

254
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,666
AW MAN, THIS SUCKS!

255
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,541
I SWEAR I KNOW MORE
THAN JUST FOOD NAMES!

256
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:56,291
I'M SERIOUS, YOU GUYS.
IGNEEL TAUGHT ME TO READ!

257
00:15:56,375 --> 00:16:00,916
HE REALLY DID. HE TAUGHT ME
TO READ LOTS OF STUFF.

258
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,708
- YOU'RE SO CUTE.
PLEASE DON'T CRY.

259
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,833
- DON'T BE CREEPY. HANDS OFF!

260
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,083
- I'M NOT CRYIN'!

261
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,125
- ALL OF YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN!

262
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,375
- ERZA.

263
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,166
- THERE'S NO REASON FOR
YOU TO BE EMBARRASSED.

264
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,000
I'M SURE IGNEEL DID HIS BEST,

265
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,625
BUT IT'S HARD TO LEARN
TO READ AND WRITE

266
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,666
BECAUSE THERE ARE
AN AWFUL LOT OF WORDS.

267
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,916
- KNOW IT ALL.

268
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,500
- YOU JUST HAVE TO BE
PATIENT AND STUDY HARD.

269
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,500
AND I COULD TEACH
YOU, IF YOU'D LIKE.

270
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:28,125
- NO WAY! SORRY,
BUT YOU'RE WAY TOO SCARY!

271
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,416
- I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT'S SO
SCARY ABOUT A VOCABULARY LESSON.

272
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,625
NO! PLEASE, YOU GOTTA HELP ME!

273
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,208
- IT'LL BE FINE!
I KNOW YOU'LL DO GOOD!

274
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,625
- THAT'S WHAT HE GETS
FOR BEIN' SUCH A DUMMY!

275
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,625
- OH YEAH,
MR. WALKS-AROUND-IN-HIS-PANTIES?

276
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,958
- YEAH, YA SNOT NOSED
LITTLE BRAT!

277
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,500
- GIMME THREE DAYS!

278
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,000
- UH-HUH?

279
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,250
- THINK OF ME
AS IGNEEL NUMBER TWO.

280
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,333
IN JUST THREE DAYS I'LL HAMMER
ALL THE VOCABULARY YOU NEED

281
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:59,625
TO BE AN EFFECTIVE FAIRY TAIL
WIZARD, INTO YOUR THICK SKULL.

282
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,125
AND YOU WILL NOT EAT,
DRINK, OR SLEEP

283
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,791
UNTIL YOU'VE MASTERED THEM!

284
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:08,250
- ALRIGHT, FINE! YOU WIN! TEACH
ME THE STUPID STUFF ALREADY!

285
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,708
- Makarov: SO HOW DO YOU
LIKE THE GUILD, NATSU?

286
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,875
- I THINK IT'S GREAT!
ERZA CAN BE PRETTY SCARY

287
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,166
BUT EVERYONE ELSE
IS REALLY COOL!

288
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,416
- I'VE LEARNED A TON OF
NEW WORDS AND STUFF!

289
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,875
I WANNA STAY AND
BECOME A MEMBER!

290
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,750
HEY, YOU GUYS! CHECK OUT
THIS AWESOME EGG I FOUND!

291
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,583
- IT'S BEEN FUN
PLAYING HOUSE WITH YOU.

292
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:31,625
MAYBE SOMEDAY I COULD BE
YOUR REAL WIFE?

293
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:35,291
- WHA-- WHAT GOT YOU
THINKING ABOUT THAT?

294
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,375
- Young Lisanna: IT'S SO PRETTY!

295
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,541
IT'D BE NICE IF WE COULD
STAY LIKE THIS FOREVER,

296
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:42,958
DON'T YOU THINK?

297
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,958
- WHOA, A FREAKIN' CAT?
- HE'S SO CUTE!

298
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,958
HE'S ALMOST LIKE A BLUEBIRD OF
HAPPINESS, ISN'T IT?

299
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:55,000
- HAPPINESS, HUH? WELL, IN THAT
CASE, I'LL NAME HIM HAPPY!

300
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,250
- AYE!

301
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:01,000
- YOU'RE GOIN' ON AN S-CLASS
QUEST? THAT'S SO NOT FAIR!

302
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,708
- AW, COME ON.

303
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,791
I'M SURE IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE
YOU'LL BE GOING ON 'EM, TOO.

304
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,208
- OH, YEAH, WHEN?

305
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,666
- I DON'T KNOW WHEN EXACTLY,
BUT WHENEVER IT HAPPENS,

306
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,666
I'LL BE THERE TO SUPPORT YOU.

307
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,125
RIGHT NOW, WE NEED YOU TO KEEP
THINGS SAFE BACK AT FAIRY TAIL.

308
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,708
- Mirajane: HURRY UP, LISANNA,
OR WE'RE LEAVIN'---

309
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,208
- BRING US BACK A SOUVENIR!

310
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,791
NATSU!

311
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,041
I'LL BE HOME REAL SOON!

312
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,000
- I MISS YOU.

313
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,625
MY NAME'S LUCY.
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU!

314
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:44,416
I KNOW I MAY NOT LOOK LIKE IT,
BUT I'M A WIZARD, TOO!

315
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,083
YEAH! THEY'RE THE GREATEST!

316
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,166
AND THEY'RE ALWAYS FEATURED
IN SORCERER WEEKLY!

317
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,083
IF I COULD CONVINCE THEM
TO LET ME IN, I'D JUST DIE!

318
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,458
- SO LET'S GO!

319
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,958
YOU WANNA JOIN THE FAIRY TAIL
GUILD, DON'T YOU?

320
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,125
- IF WE WORRY ABOUT
FOLLOWING RULES,

321
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,416
OUR MAGIC WILL NEVER PROGRESS!

322
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,166
FOLLOW THE PATH
YOU BELIEVE IN!

323
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,541
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE
FAIRY TAIL GUILD NUMBER ONE!

324
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,583
- ( all cheering )

325
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,333
- MY POWER IS--

326
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,791
- MASTER!

327
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:19,666
- BUT I DON'T WANNA LEAVE.
I WANNA STAY WITH YOU GUYS.

328
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,916
I LOVE BEING IN FAIRY TAIL!

329
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:32,458
NATSU. DON'T DO THIS. LET'S JUST
GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT.

330
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:38,000
MAYBE IF I JUST LET THEM TAKE
ME, THEY'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE.

331
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:44,125
- LUCY. YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO WAY
HE'D LET THAT HAPPEN.

332
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:53,500
- YOUR GUILD HALL'S IN SHAMBLES.
SO HOW DOES IT FEEL TO LOSE?

333
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,916
- I CAN'T STAND
WATCHING THIS HAPPEN.

334
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,291
- I'D STAY DOWN
IF I WERE YOU, SALAMANDER.

335
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,666
'CAUSE I'M STARTIN'
TO GET BORED

336
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,625
WITH ALL THIS
"HOLDING BACK" GARBAGE.

337
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,000
AND IT'S NOT GONNA BE
GOOD FOR YOU.

338
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,708
- NATSU TOOK DOWN JUPITER.

339
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,000
AND HE HAD TO FIGHT
TWO OF THE ELEMENT 4.

340
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,833
HE USED UP WAY TOO MUCH OF
HIS MAGIC POWER.

341
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,333
IF HE COULD JUST EAT SOME FIRE,

342
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:24,583
HE'D BE STRONG ENOUGH
TO BEAT THIS GUY!

343
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:28,625
- SO LONG, KID. YOU'VE REACHED
THE END OF THE LINE.

344
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,458
- Sagittarius: JUST A MOMENT.

345
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,000
IT SEEMS I DIDN'T
QUITE UNDERSTAND

346
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,416
WHAT YOU WERE ASKING ME EARLIER.

347
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,791
WHEN I ARRIVED YOU INQUIRED

348
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,708
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT I
COULD SHOOT FIRE,

349
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,708
AND I ANSWERED I DID NOT
HAVE THE POWER TO DO SO.

350
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:44,125
HOWEVER, NOW I SEE IT'S THE
FIRE ITSELF THAT'S IMPORTANT.

351
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,416
IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT I
CAN'T PRODUCE IT MYSELF,

352
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,416
AS LONG AS IT'S PRODUCED!

353
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
- THIS IS IT, SALAMANDER!

354
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,166
THE END!

355
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,291
- NICE SHOT!

356
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,875
- YOU FOUND A WAY
TO CREATE FIRE!

357
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,250
- DEPENDING ON THE FORCE ONE
APPLIES WHEN SHOOTING AN ARROW,

358
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,250
AND THE TRAJECTORY
THAT ARROW FOLLOWS,

359
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,708
IT'S POSSIBLE TO PIERCE
OR SHATTER STEEL.

360
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,458
- THAT MAN-HORSE THING
IS GETTIN' IN MY WAY.

361
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:16,708
- OH WOW! YOU'RE LIKE AN ARCHERY
GENIUS, SAGITTARIUS!

362
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,916
- WELL, I AIM TO PLEASE.

363
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,791
- IF YOU WANNA SALUTE HER,
SHE'S OVER HERE.

364
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:33,291
- JUST WHAT I NEEDED.
THANKS A MILLION, LUCY.

365
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:39,125
- EAT ALL THE FIRE YOU WANT BUT
YOU'RE STILL NOT GONNA BEAT ME!

366
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:42,625
- ALL RIGHT!

367
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,916
- OH, YEAH! NATSU'S FIRED UP!

368
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,250
- Sue: THIS IS BAD, YOU GUYS!

369
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:56,666
- LEVY, JET, DROY, LUCY,
GRAMPS, ALL MY FRIENDS.

370
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,875
MY GUILD, FAIRY TAIL.

371
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,250
- IRON DRAGON ROAR!

372
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,416
HE DEFLECTED MY BREATH ATTACK

373
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,125
AND HE DID IT WITH JUST
HIS BARE HANDS!

374
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,166
- I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MORE
PEOPLE YOU NEED TO HURT

375
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:18,166
BEFORE YOU'RE SATISFIED,
BUT IT ENDS NOW.

376
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:22,041
- THERE'S NO WAY. I CAN'T LOSE
TO HIM. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

377
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,333
HE'S NOTHIN' BUT FAIRY SCUM!

378
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:27,625
- I'M GONNA MAKE YOU PAY FOR
WHAT YOU DID TO MY FRIENDS.

379
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:28,791
MESSIN' WITH FAIRY TAIL

380
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,833
IS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE
YOU'VE EVER MADE.

381
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,291
- TO BE CONTINUED!

382
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,541
- WHAT? WE'RE ENDING RIGHT NOW?

383
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:41,750
- GUESS WE'LL SEE
YA LATER, ALLIGATOR!

384
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:52,833
- ( closing theme song playing )

385
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,125
- HEY, WEREN'T WE SUPPOSED
TO GET IN BIG TROUBLE

386
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:18,208
FOR GOING ON THAT S-CLASS JOB
WITHOUT MASTER'S PERMISSION?

387
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,375
- HUH? PLEASE DON'T
BRING THAT UP AGAIN!

388
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:21,625
- I'M JUST SCARED THAT
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

389
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:23,333
GET OURSELVES READY FOR IT.

390
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:24,666
- HOW ABOUT WE JUST
CHANGE THE RULE

391
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,583
ABOUT NOT GOING ON S-CLASS
QUESTS TO BEGIN WITH.

392
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:31,166
- WELL, I THINK YOU'D HAVE TO
TAKE THAT UP WITH THE MASTER.

393
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,375
- Natsu and Happy:
NEXT TIME: FAIRY LAW!

394
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:35,875
- Natsu: OH, LOOK AT THE TIME.
I REALLY SHOULD BE GOING.

395
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,125
- Happy: ARE YOU RUNNING AWAY?

396
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:39,375
- NOPE! I JUST GOT A LOT
OF STUFF TO DO TODAY.

397
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:41,333
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, I SWEAR!
