1
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:20,708
- Narrator:
IN A LAND FAR, FAR AWAY,

2
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:23,250
LIES THE KINGDOM OF FIORE,

3
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:26,166
A SMALL PEACEFUL NATION
OF 17 MILLION,

4
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,791
AND A PLACE FILLED
WITH MAGIC.

5
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,208
FOUND IN EVERY HOME,

6
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,916
BOUGHT AND SOLD IN 
EVERY MARKET PLACE,

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,416
FOR MOST,
MAGIC IS MERELY A TOOL,

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,000
A MUNDANE PART OF
EVERY DAY LIFE.

9
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,291
FOR SOME, HOWEVER,
MAGIC IS AN ART.

10
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:42,333
AND THEY'VE DEVOTED
THEIR LIVES TO ITS PRACTICE.

11
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:44,708
THESE ARE THE WIZARDS.

12
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,916
BANDED TOGETHER
INTO MAGICAL GUILDS,

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,958
THEY PLY THEIR SKILLS
IN SEARCH OF FAME AND FORTUNE.

14
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:54,375
MANY SUCH GUILDS
DOT THE LANDSCAPE OF FIORE,

15
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:57,291
BUT THERE IS A CERTAIN GUILD
IN A CERTAIN TOWN

16
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,625
THAT SOARS HIGH
ABOVE THE REST.

17
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:02,333
ONE FROM WHICH COUNTLESS
LEGENDS HAVE BEEN BORN--

18
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:05,666
A GUILD THAT WOULD NO DOUBT
CONTINUE TO CREATE LEGENDS 

19
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,416
WELL INTO THE FUTURE.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,708
ITS NAME IS FAIRY TAIL.

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,791
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

22
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,125
- Natsu:
PREVIOUSLY ON "FAIRY TAIL"...

23
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,541
- Erigor: ( chuckles )

24
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,708
STEP INTO OUR PARLOR,
FAIRY TAIL FLIES.

25
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,833
- Erza: WE'RE NOT THREATENED
BY ANY OF YOU.

26
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,833
TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE PLANNING
TO DO WITH LULLABY.

27
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:56,041
- SHE'S QUEEN OF THE FAIRIES,
TITANIA ERZA!

28
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,750
- CIRCLE OF SWORD!

29
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:03,958
- ( gasping )
- WHAT IS THAT?

30
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,958
- THE STATION IS
SURROUNDED BY WIND.

31
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,625
- THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'LL BREAK THROUGH

32
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,958
MY MAGIC-SEALING BARRIER.

33
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:15,666
- Narrator:
THE OSHIBANA TRAIN STATION.

34
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,166
- ( groaning )
- JUST FORGET ABOUT IT, LADY.

35
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,666
I ALREADY TOLD YOU,

36
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,416
THERE'S NO UNDOING
ERIGOR'S BARRIER.

37
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,083
YOU AND YOUR
BUDDIES ARE STUCK.

38
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,958
- Gray: ERZA!

39
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,708
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE WITH NATSU.

40
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,541
- WE DECIDED TO SPLIT UP.
NEVER MIND THAT, NOW.

41
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:31,958
LISTEN, I JUST FOUND OUT

42
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,958
EISENWALD'S REAL 
TARGET IS CLOVER,

43
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,708
THE NEXT TOWN UP.
- WHAT?

44
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,958
- ERIGOR'S HEADED TOWARD
THE CONFERENCE AS WE SPEAK.

45
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,416
HE'S PLANNING TO USE
THE LULLABY

46
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,958
TO KILL THE GUILD MASTERS.

47
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,500
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?!
- ( whimpers )

48
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:44,750
- Erza: THERE'S A PROBLEM.

49
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,458
THE STATION IS SURROUNDED
BY A WIND BARRIER.

50
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,208
- Gray: YEAH, I KNOW.
I SAW IT EARLIER.

51
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,583
IF YOU TRY TO BREAK
THROUGH THAT THING,

52
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,041
IT'LL MAKE
MINCEMEAT OUT OF YOU.

53
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,375
- I'VE ALREADY TRIED THAT.

54
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:57,125
- WHOA, IS YOUR ARM OKAY?
- THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

55
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,500
WHAT IS
IS GETTING OUT OF HERE.

56
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,166
WE MUST STOP ERIGOR

57
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,750
BEFORE HE REACHES THE
GUILD MASTERS' CONFERENCE.

58
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,000
WAIT A MINUTE.

59
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,500
I REMEMBER THEM TALKING ABOUT
SOMEBODY NAMED KAGE

60
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:09,791
BACK AT THE PUB.

61
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,458
WE HAVE TO FIND
THAT MAN, GRAY.

62
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,541
HE WAS THE ONE WHO BROKE
LULLABY'S SEAL.

63
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:14,875
- A DISPELLER, HUH?

64
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,916
A SEAL-BREAKING WIZARD.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,875
HE CAN TAKE DOWN 
THE WIND BARRIER.

66
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,041
- Erza: THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING.
NOW LET'S START SEARCHING.

67
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,041
- Gray: RIGHT.

68
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,958
- Byard: KARACKA.

69
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,541
HOW LONG ARE YOU GONNA
HIDE BACK THERE?

70
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,375
- I'M SORRY, BUT I WAS SCARED.

71
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:36,041
- FIND KAGE BEFORE THEY DO.
GO NOW.

72
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,000
- NO, PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME.

73
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,875
YOU KNOW I'M NO GOOD
IN A FIGHT, BYARD.

74
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,041
- CALM DOWN.

75
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,666
IT'S A SIMPLE JOB.

76
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,500
EVEN YOU CAN HANDLE THIS.

77
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,083
- ( gasps )

78
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,125
- Happy: FLAME AND WIND.

79
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,000
- ( Lucy groans )
THIS IS USELESS.

80
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,916
I CAN'T FIND HIM ANYWHERE.
- AYE.

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,708
- WHAT DO YOU SAY WE JUST
HEAD BACK TO WHERE ERZA IS?

82
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,125
- ( screams )

83
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,041
- WHOA, WHAT'S
WITH THE CRAZY REACTION?

84
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,625
- ERZA GAVE YOU AN ORDER
TO AFTER THE FAT MAN.

85
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,375
SO YOU-- YOU HAVE
TO DO WHAT SHE SAYS, LUCY.

86
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,708
IGNORING AN ORDER FROM ERZA
IS NEVER A GOOD IDEA.

87
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,791
SHE'S GONNA BE
SUPER ANGRY WITH YOU.

88
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,041
AND IF I HAVE TO
WATCH HER PUNISH YOU,

89
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,750
IT MAY SCAR ME FOR LIFE.

90
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,125
- WHAT KIND OF PUNISHMENT
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE?

91
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,000
HEY, I WAS JUST KIDDING.

92
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,083
I WOULD NEVER GIVE UP
ON A MISSION LIKE THAT.

93
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,750
- THE THOUGHT OF AN ERZA SMACK
DOWN SCARE SOME SENSE INTO YOU?

94
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,625
- SHUT UP, STUPID CAT!

95
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,250
WHY ARE YOU
EVEN FOLLOWING ME?!

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,708
- ERIGOR!

97
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:40,708
COME OUT, COME OUT
WHEREVER YOU ARE! 

98
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,708
YOU IN HERE?

99
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:46,125
- GEEZ, HASN'T HE
EVER HEARD OF USING A DOOR?

100
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,708
- WHERE IS HE?

101
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,916
- NOW THAT ERIGOR'S
MADE IT OUT SAFELY,

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,250
THIS KID DOESN'T POSE
MUCH OF A THREAT.

103
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,791
I COULD JUST LET HIM GO,

104
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,250
BUT WHAT WOULD BE
THE FUN IN THAT? 

105
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:05,000
THERE, I'VE WANTED TO DO THAT
FOR A WHILE NOW.

106
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,000
HAD ENOUGH,
FAIRY TAIL INSECT?

107
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,916
- ( grumbling )

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,958
NOT YOU AGAIN!

109
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,416
- ( chuckles )
WOW, YOU LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT.

110
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,333
- OH, SHUT IT, DOGGY.
- GET IT RIGHT.

111
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,708
IT'S KAGE!  THE NAME IS KAGE!
- SAME THING REALLY.

112
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:22,458
- ANYWAY, I THINK I'VE GOT YOU
ALL FIGURED OUT THIS TIME.

113
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,458
YOU EAT FLAMES
TO INCREASE YOUR POWER.

114
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,833
ISN'T THAT YOUR BIG TRICK?

115
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,250
SHOULDN'T BE HARD
TO STAMP OUT.

116
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,083
- ( grumbling )

117
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,875
NOW I REALLY WANT
TO TEACH YOU A LESSON,

118
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,000
BUT I DON'T HAVE THE TIME!

119
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,750
TELL ME WHERE ERIGOR IS!

120
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,875
- YOU THINK I'M JUST
GONNA TELL YOU THAT?

121
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,500
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW,

122
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,416
THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO BEAT IT OUT OF ME. 

123
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,750
KNUCKLE SHADOW!

124
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,041
- SO I GET TO KNOCK YOU AROUND
AND I GET THE INFO I WANT?

125
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,125
THAT'S KILLING TWO BIRDS
WITH ONE STONE.

126
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,291
I'M GETTING ALL FIRED UP.

127
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,250
- ( gasps )

128
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,750
- WHY IS THE BUILDING
SHAKING LIKE THAT?

129
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:58,708
- HA HA!

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,750
- ALL RIGHT, FAIRY.

131
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,458
SNAKE SHADOW!

132
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,583
YOU CAN'T RUN THIS TIME.

133
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,708
THEY'LL TEAR YOU TO PIECES.

134
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,041
- I GOT THIS.

135
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:17,666
FIRE DRAGON WING ATTACK!

136
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,000
- ( gasps )
IMPOSSIBLE.

137
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,125
HE WAS ABLE TO DEFEAT THEM
WITH ONE SHOT.

138
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,041
SO MUCH POWER.

139
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,541
I DIDN'T THINK WIZARDS
LIKE THIS REALLY EXISTED.

140
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,000
- YOU READY TO TALK?

141
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,500
IF NOT, I'VE GOT A FIREBALL
WITH YOUR NAME ON IT.

142
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,625
- NO.

143
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,250
YOU'RE A MONSTER!

144
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,958
- ( rumbling ) 
- WAS THAT HIM?

145
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,000
- YES.
- NATSU?

146
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,833
- OH, MAN, LOOK
WHAT YOU MADE ME DO.

147
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:51,791
I WAS TRYING NOT TO MESS UP
THE WHOLE PLACE THIS TIME. 

148
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,500
- ( groans )

149
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,750
- ANYWAY, I FEEL BETTER.

150
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,083
SORRY I HAD TO
TAKE YOU DOWN, DIORAMA.

151
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,958
- I TOLD YOU, IT'S KAGEYAMA.

152
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,791
- WHATEVER,
TELL ME WHERE ERIGOR IS

153
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,500
OR YOU'RE GONNA GET TOASTED.
- ( chuckles )

154
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,416
HE'S LONG GONE,
YOU IDIOT.

155
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,416
HE'S NOT EVEN
IN THIS STATION ANYMORE.

156
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,791
- WHAT?
- Erza: NATSU!

157
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,416
DO NOT HARM HIM!
WE NEED HIM ALIVE.

158
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,375
- WAY TO GO, YOU FIRE FREAK.

159
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,125
- HUH?
( grasps )

160
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,833
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID WRONG,
BUT I'M SORRY!

161
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,833
- ( screams )

162
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,375
- YOU WILL DISPEL
THE WIND BARRIER.

163
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,125
AND YOU WILL DO SO
WITHOUT COMPLAINT.

164
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,500
- ( whimpers )

165
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,583
- AAH, JUST DO IT, MAN.

166
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,166
THIS CHICK'S A REAL MONSTER.
- SHUT UP, NATSU!

167
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,250
- UNDERSTOOD?

168
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,500
- FINE, I'LL DISPEL IT.

169
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,041
( groans )

170
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,541
- ( gasps )
- ( groaning )

171
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,625
WHY, KARACKA?

172
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,958
- Byard: IT'S A SIMPLE JOB.
EVEN YOU CAN HANDLE THIS.

173
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,333
- Erza: KAGE!

174
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:52,000
- Byard: YOU HAVE
TO KILL KAGEYAMA.

175
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,750
- Gray: NO, HE WAS OUR
ONLY WAY OUT OF HERE. 

176
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,458
- KAGE, DON'T YOU DARE
DIE ON US.

177
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,458
WE NEED YOUR HELP.
DO YOU HEAR ME?

178
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,041
- I THINK WE'RE
LOSING HIM, ERZA.

179
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,583
- YOU'RE THE ONLY
ONE OF US THAT'S ABLE

180
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,416
TO DISPEL
THE WIND BARRIER.

181
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,625
JUST HANG ON.

182
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,166
- ( whimpers )

183
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,083
- ( growls )

184
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,291
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT
TO ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS?

185
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,458
HE'S A MEMBER OF YOUR GUILD!

186
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,916
HE TRUSTED YOU
AND YOU TRIED TO KILL HIM!

187
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,250
HOW COULD YOU?!

188
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,000
- ( grunts )

189
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:26,083
- IS THAT HOW YOU DARK GUILD
MEMBERS TREAT EACH OTHER?

190
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,083
- PLEASE, KAGE,
JUST STAY WITH US.

191
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,250
- HE'S UNCONSCIOUS.
IT'S JUST NO USE.

192
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,041
- WE CAN'T LET HIM DIE.
HE'S OUR ONLY WAY OUT OF HERE.

193
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,083
- BUT THERE'S NO WAY
HE CAN USE HIS MAGIC

194
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:38,208
IN THIS CONDITION.
- IF I FORCE HIM TO, HE WILL.

195
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,750
- UM...

196
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,416
BAD TIMING, HUH?

197
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,708
- AYE.

198
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:46,291
- Narrator:
THIS IS CLOVER CANYON,


199
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:50,083
A CANYON SO DEEP, MANY BELIEVE
ITS TREACHEROUS WALLS


200
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,875
ACTUALLY RISE UP
FROM THE ABYSS. 


201
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,458
THE ONLY WAY ACROSS IS 
THIS SINGLE TRAIN LINE.


202
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,125
- I'M SO CLOSE TO CLOVER

203
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,541
AND THE GUILD MASTERS,
I CAN TASTE IT.

204
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,250
AND WHAT'S MORE,
THE MAGIC ENERGY

205
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,000
I USED CREATING
THAT WIND BARRIER

206
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,625
IS ALMOST FULLY RECHARGED.

207
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,000
NOW IT'S TIME.

208
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,166
YOU FOOLS NOT ONLY 
TOOK AWAY OUR WORK,

209
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,166
BUT YOU ROBBED US
OF OUR RIGHTS.

210
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,666
AND NOW I'M GOING
TO MAKE YOU PAY. 

211
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,083
THE REAPER'S CLEANSING
IS NIGH.

212
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,750
- Lucy: WHAT?

213
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,166
ERIGOR WANTS TO USE LULLABY
ON THE GUILD MASTERS?

214
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,541
- Natsu:
OH, WE HAVE TO STOP HIM.

215
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,166
- Erza:
THAT'S EASIER SAID THAN DONE.

216
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,458
ERIGOR CUT OFF OUR ONLY MEANS
OF REACHING CLOVER

217
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,000
AND HAS HEADED THERE BY AIR.

218
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,541
- I'M PRETTY SURE THAT
WE COULD CATCH UP TO HIM

219
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,208
ON THE MAGIC-MOBILE,

220
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,416
BUT WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING
UNTIL WE FIGURE OUT

221
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,958
HOW TO GET ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THIS BARRIER.

222
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,708
- HOW ARE WE GONNA DO THAT?

223
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:49,750
- SEE, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS 
IF YOU TRY TO BUST THROUGH.

224
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:53,625
- KAGE, WAKE UP.
YOU'RE OUR ONLY HOPE RIGHT NOW.

225
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,625
- I'VE GOT TO TRY
TO BREAK THROUGH!

226
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,833
WE HAVE TO SAVE MAKAROV!

227
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,416
( straining )

228
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,041
( groaning )

229
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,833
- NATSU!
- CUT IT OUT, YOU IDIOT.

230
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,625
OBVIOUSLY, BRUTE FORCE
ISN'T GONNA DO YOU ANY GOOD.

231
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,541
- ISN'T THERE
ANYTHING YOU CAN DO?

232
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,916
IF YOU TRIED FREEZING IT,
MAYBE NATSU CAN MELT IT. 

233
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,250
- IF I COULD, I WOULD
HAVE DONE THAT ALREADY.

234
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,208
- ( grunts )

235
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,500
- NATSU! - WOULD YOU
STOP TRYING TO BE THE HERO?

236
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,250
YOU'RE GONNA GET
TORN TO SHREDS! 

237
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,541
- DAMN IT, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT TO DO.

238
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,458
- I SAID STOP IT!

239
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,583
- CRAP.

240
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,291
- WHAT? WHAT'S THE MATTER?

241
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,708
- ( cheers )

242
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,833
- WE COULD USE YOUR SPIRITS!

243
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,500
BACK AT EVERLUE'S,
I WAS PULLED

244
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,708
FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER
THROUGH THE SPIRIT WORLD.

245
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,833
- WELL, YEAH,
BUT NORMAL PEOPLE

246
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,458
WOULD SUFFOCATE TO DEATH
IF THEY TRIED THAT.

247
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,041
IT'S HARD TO BREATHE
IN THEIR WORLD.

248
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,708
BESIDES, A CELESTIAL WIZARD

249
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,208
CAN ONLY OPEN A GATE
WHEREVER THEY'RE STANDING.

250
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,833
- HUH? - OKAY, LET ME
SIMPLIFY THIS FOR YOU.

251
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,916
EVEN IF WE COULD PASS
THROUGH THE SPIRIT WORLD,

252
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,583
WE WOULD NEED ANOTHER
CELESTIAL WIZARD

253
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,541
TO OPEN A GATE
OUTSIDE THE TRAIN STATION

254
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,750
FOR US TO PASS THROUGH.
- YOU'RE TOTALLY CONFUSING ME.

255
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,625
JUST HURRY UP AND DO IT.
- BUT I TOLD YOU, I CAN'T.

256
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,166
NOT TO MENTION THE VERY ACT

257
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,708
OF A HUMAN ENTERING
THE SPIRIT WORLD

258
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,708
IS A SERIOUS
BREECH OF CONTRACT.

259
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:12,125
I DIDN'T CARE WHEN YOU DID IT
BECAUSE IT WASN'T MY KEY.

260
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,458
IT WAS EVERLUE'S.
- I DON'T GET YOUR MAGIC AT ALL.

261
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:18,000
- EVERLUE'S KEY.  HOLD ON.

262
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,416
( screams )

263
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,625
I JUST REMEMBERED, LUCY.
- REMEMBERED WHAT?

264
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,416
- WHAT I WAS TRYING TO TELL YOU
ON THE WAY HERE!

265
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,416
- Lucy: ON THE WAY HERE?

266
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,458
OH YEAH, YOU MEAN, WHEN YOU
KEPT CALLING ME WEIRD?

267
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,333
- LOOK.

268
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,791
- HOW'D YOU GET YOUR PAWS
ON VIRGO'S KEY?!

269
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,083
DIDN'T ANYONE TEACH YOU
THAT IT'S WRONG TO STEAL THINGS?

270
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,375
- BUT I DIDN'T STEAL IT.

271
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,166
VIRGO ASKED ME
TO GIVE IT TO YOU.

272
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,750
- COME ON, GUYS.

273
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,333
WE'RE WASTING WAY TOO
MUCH OF OUR TIME

274
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,416
LISTENING TO THIS NONSENSE.
- WHO'S VIRGO?

275
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,833
- OH, WASN'T SHE THAT
BIG GORILLA-LOOKING MAID.

276
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,958
- Happy: APPARENTLY,
HER CONTRACT WITH EVERLUE

277
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,583
WAS BROKEN AS SOON
HE WAS ARRESTED.

278
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:51,833
- Virgo: WHOA.

279
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,333
- BEFORE WE ALL LEFT THAT DAY,

280
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,708
SHE CAME UP TO ME AND
SAID THAT SHE WANTED 

281
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,041
TO SIGN A NEW CONTRACT
WITH YOU, LUCY.

282
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,958
- GREAT, I GET
A BIG, UGLY SPIRIT.

283
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,666
ANYWAY, THANKS
FOR LETTING ME KNOW,

284
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,250
BUT I'LL HAVE TO DEAL
WITH HER LATER.

285
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,791
IF YOU DIDN'T REALIZE IT,
RIGHT NOW,

286
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,041
WE NEED TO FIND
A WAY OUT OF HERE.

287
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,208
- BUT--
- SHUT UP!

288
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,708
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST MEOW
LIKE EVERY OTHER CAT?! 

289
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,250
- SHE CAN BE PRETTY SCARY, HUH?

290
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,083
- MUST HAVE LEARNED IT
FROM ERZA.

291
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,166
- I'M SORRY.

292
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,166
I JUST THOUGHT THAT SINCE
VIRGO CAN DRILL HOLES,

293
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,041
MAYBE SHE COULD DIG
THROUGH THE GROUND

294
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,208
AND GET US TO THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE BARRIER.

295
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,375
- SHE CAN?
- SERIOUSLY?

296
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,666
- UH...
- YOU'RE RIGHT!  SHE CAN.

297
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,500
YOU'RE SO SMART, HAPPY.

298
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,791
WHY DIDN'T YOU MENTION
THAT SOONER, SILLY KITTY?

299
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,500
- SOMEONE WAS PINCHING MY FACE.

300
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,416
- MY MOST SINCERE, HUMBLE,
HEARTFELT APOLOGIES.

301
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,458
I PROMISE I'LL
MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

302
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,250
JUST PLEASE
LET ME HAVE THE KEY.

303
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,166
- GIVE ME SOME FISH 
AND ALL IS FORGIVEN.

304
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,333
- I CALL UPON THEE

305
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,583
IN THE WORLD OF
THE CELESTIAL SPIRITS.

306
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,166
AND NOW, I BECKON YOU
TO MY SIDE AT ONCE.

307
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,708
PASS THROUGH THE GATE.

308
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,916
OPEN, GATE OF THE MAIDEN.
VIRGO!

309
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,291
- ( doorbell rings )

310
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,583
- HUH?

311
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,250
- YOU SUMMONED, MISTRESS?

312
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,583
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

313
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,041
- WHO ARE YOU?

314
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,208
- YOU SUMMONED, MISTRESS?
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

315
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,958
- WHO ARE YOU?

316
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,000
- WHAT'S UP, BURGER.
MAN, YOU LOOK GREAT.

317
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,125
YOU LOST SOME WEIGHT.
- MY NAME'S VIRGO.

318
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,500
I APOLOGIZE FOR ANY TROUBLE
I MIGHT HAVE CAUSED YOU.

319
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,625
- SHE DIDN'T JUST
LOSE WEIGHT, NATSU!

320
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,500
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN? - SHE'S LIKE
TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSON.

321
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,500
- I'M A VERY LOYAL SPIRIT
WHO'LL DO ANYTHING

322
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,041
TO PLEASE HER WIZARD.

323
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,708
SO I TRY TO TAKE ON
WHATEVER FORM

324
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,750
I THINK MY WIZARD
WILL FIND MOST APPEALING.

325
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,291
- I DON'T KNOW,
I KIND OF LIKED IT

326
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,958
WHEN YOU WERE ALL
BIG AND TOUGH LOOKING.

327
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,208
- DID YOU REALLY?

328
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,416
WELL, THEN...

329
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,958
I CAN SWITCH BACK
IF YOU LIKE.

330
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,583
- DON'T LISTEN TO HIM!
I'M YOUR WIZARD.

331
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,375
AND I LIKE
THE OTHER FORM BETTER.

332
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,625
- AS YOU WISH, MISTRESS.

333
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,250
- I'M AFRAID WE DON'T
HAVE MUCH TIME.

334
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,291
CAN WE WORK OUT
THE CONTRACT DETAILS LATER?

335
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,375
- OF COURSE, WHATEVER
YOU'D LIKE, MISTRESS.

336
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,458
- DO YOU REALLY HAVE
TO CALL ME MISTRESS?

337
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,500
- WOULD YOU PREFER
I CALLED YOU QUEEN? - NO.

338
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,416
- WHAT ABOUT PRINCESS?
- OH, YEAH, THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

339
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,250
- Gray: PRINCESS? YEAH, RIGHT.

340
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,250
- HURRY IT UP, LADIES.

341
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,875
- YES, SIR.  NOW.

342
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,416
WHOA.

343
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,833
- OH WOW, LOOK AT HER GO.
- NICELY DONE, LUCY.

344
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,375
- ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS,
TIME TO BUST OUT OF THIS JOINT.

345
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,458
- ( Natsu strains )

346
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,416
- Gray: WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

347
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,166
- I KNOW HE'S
ONE OF OUR ENEMIES,

348
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,458
BUT I'D FEEL GUILTY IF WE 
JUST LEFT HIM HERE TO DIE.

349
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,791
- AND HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED NEXT.

350
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,541
- LOOKS LIKE WE MADE IT OUT.

351
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,791
- LET'S HEAD TOWARD CLOVER.
- WHOA, THIS WIND IS CRAZY.

352
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,250
- PRINCESS, I'LL KEEP
YOUR PANTIES FROM SHOWING.

353
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,791
- YOU JUST WORRY
ABOUT YOUR OWN.

354
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,250
- OH WOW.

355
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,750
- IT'S NO USE.

356
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,833
YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO CATCH UP TO ERIGOR.

357
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,791
YOU CAN'T STOP US.

358
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:05,791
WE'VE WON.

359
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,291
- Erza: WHERE'S NATSU?

360
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,458
- HAPPY'S NOT HERE EITHER.

361
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,291
- I SEE THE TOWN UP AHEAD.

362
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:20,166
A BIT FARTHER
AND I'LL HAVE REVENGE.

363
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,666
- ( Natsu groans )

364
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,666
WE'VE GOT YOU NOW.

365
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,250
DIDN'T KNOW CATS COULD FLY
AT MACH SPEED, DID YOU?

366
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,250
YOU OKAY?

367
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,541
- YEAH, BUT I'M SO TIRED.

368
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,583
I CAN'T FLY.

369
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:37,875
- DON'T WORRY, BUDDY.

370
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,708
I THINK I CAN
HANDLE IT FROM HERE.

371
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:40,916
- YOU AGAIN.

372
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,541
YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE
PESKY FAIRY TAIL FLIES.

373
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,250
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

374
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,125
- I'M NOT LETTING
YOU GET PAST ME, 

375
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,708
YOU DRESS-WEARING WINDBAG.

376
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,208
- Kageyama: SO TELL ME,

377
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,666
WHY ARE YOU
TAKING ME WITH YOU?

378
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,666
- BECAUSE YOU OBVIOUSLY
NEED A DOCTOR.

379
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,208
AND SINCE
EVERYONE LEFT TOWN,

380
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,916
YOU'LL HAVE TO
SEE ONE IN CLOVER.

381
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,625
TRY AND SHOW SOME GRATITUDE.
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

382
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,125
WHY ARE YOU HELPING ME?

383
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,833
WE'RE ENEMIES.

384
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:18,041
OH, WAIT, I GET IT.
YOU'RE TAKING ME HOSTAGE

385
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,625
SO YOU CAN TRY TO MAKE
A DEAL WITH ERIGOR.

386
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,625
WELL, YOU CAN FORGET IT.

387
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,375
HE COULD CARE LESS ABOUT ME
OR ANY OF HIS MEN.

388
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,875
- GEEZ, LIGHTEN UP, DUDE.

389
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,916
- IF YOU WANT TO DIE,
WE CAN MAKE THAN HAPPEN.

390
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,458
- CHILL, GRAY.

391
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:34,208
- THERE'S A WHOLE LOT
MORE TO THIS WORLD

392
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,791
THAN JUST LIFE AND DEATH,
YOU KNOW?

393
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,333
YOU SHOULD TRY TO LOOK
FOR THE POSITIVE,

394
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:41,125
YOU AND YOUR EISENWALD PALS.

395
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,291
- ( screaming )

396
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,666
- Gray: WHAT HAPPENED?
- IT'S OKAY.

397
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,250
EVERYTHING'S FINE NOW.
- I'M SO SORRY.

398
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,583
- COULD YOUR BUTT
BE ANY BIGGER?

399
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,625
- SEXUAL HARASSMENT!
KILL HIM, GRAY!

400
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,333
HE SAID I HAD A BIG BUTT.
- GEEZ.

401
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,250
SO MUCH FOR TRYING TO HAVE
A SERIOUS MOMENT.

402
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,625
- MY VISION
IS GETTING BLURRY.

403
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:06,458
I MUST HAVE USED MORE
MAGIC ENERGY THAN I THOUGHT.

404
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:10,125
NATSU, YOU HAVE
TO STOP ERIGOR.

405
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,875
IT'S ALL UP TO YOU NOW.

406
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,625
DON'T LET ME DOWN.

407
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,791
- I'M GONNA BURN YOU

408
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,541
AND THAT STUPID FLUTE OF YOURS
TO A CRISP.

409
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,958
- SO YOU WERE ABLE TO
BREAK THROUGH MY WIND BARRIER.

410
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,833
YOU LITTLE FLIES
CAN BE SUCH A NUISANCE.

411
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,166
NOW GET OUT OF MY WAY, KID,

412
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,791
OR ELSE.

413
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,375
- IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?

414
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,291
- IMPOSSIBLE.

415
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,041
HE USES HIS FLAMES
TO JUMP AND TO STRIKE.

416
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,625
I UNDERESTIMATED HIS POWER.
- COME ON!

417
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,583
- THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY
BE A CHALLENGE.

418
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,458
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP THERE,
YOU COWARD?

419
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,708
COME DOWN HERE AND
FIGHT ME LIKE A MAN.

420
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,458
- DON'T GET TOO COCKY, FLY.

421
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,041
STORM BRINGER!

422
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,333
- ( screams )

423
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,125
- NATSU.

424
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,500
( strains )

425
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,458
( pants )
IT'S NO USE.

426
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,333
I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
MAGIC ENERGY.

427
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,041
- ( screams )

428
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:21,541
- ( laughs ) LET'S SEE YOUR
FIREPOWER GET YOU OUT OF THIS.

429
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:24,458
- Happy: NATSU!

430
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:25,875
- MAN, THIS SUCKS.

431
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,666
I WASN'T EXPECTING
THAT AT ALL.

432
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,500
WHAT AM I GONNA DO NOW?

433
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,708
( grunting )

434
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,250
( groans )

435
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,208
SORRY, GRAMPS.

436
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:40,750
- Macao: COME ON, NATSU.
YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT.

437
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,791
NOW WATCH HOW I DO IT.

438
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,291
SEE?
- OH, THAT'S AWESOME.

439
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,041
- YEAH, IT'S
CALLED PURPLE FLARE.

440
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,541
AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S FIRE,

441
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,500
IT CAN DO A LOT MORE
THAN JUST BURN THINGS.

442
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:53,375
- HOW COME MY FIRE BURNS
EVERYTHING IT TOUCHES?

443
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,291
- 'CAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW 
HOW TO MAKE IT NOT BURN.

444
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,083
YOU GOT TO LEARN THAT
IF YOU WISH FOR IT

445
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,500
DEEP DOWN IN YOUR HEART,

446
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,500
THE FIRE DO EXACTLY 
WHAT YOU WANT IT TO.

447
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,375
ONCE YOU'VE MASTERED THAT,

448
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,916
THEN NOT EVEN WIND OR
WATER MAGIC CAN BEAT YOU.

449
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,833
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

450
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,333
( screams )

451
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:22,958
- NATSU!

452
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,333
- THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

453
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,791
( chuckles )

454
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,708
SO THAT'S WHAT YOU
WERE TRYING TO TELL ME.

455
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,458
I THINK I GET IT NOW.

456
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,708
- BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

457
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,375
- YOU MUST BE
PRETTY COLD UP THERE

458
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,750
HALF NAKED LIKE THAT.
WANT ME TO WARM YOU UP?

459
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:41,375
- YOUR FLAMES ARE POWERLESS
AGAINST ME.

460
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,500
- OH, YEAH,
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

461
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:49,541
FIRE DRAGON ROAR!

462
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,000
- STORM WALL!

463
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,750
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS KID.

464
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,750
THERE'S NO RHYME
OR REASON TO HIS ATTACKS.

465
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,250
IS THIS WHAT ALL
FAIRY TAIL WIZARDS ARE LIKE?

466
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,666
- ( chuckles )

467
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,875
- ALTHOUGH YOUR
POWERS ARE REMARKABLE,

468
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,500
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE
STILL NO MATCH FOR ME.

469
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:20,041
ENOUGH OF THIS
CAT AND MOUSE CHASE.

470
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,250
IT'S TIME TO GET SERIOUS.

471
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,375
- I'M READY WHEN YOU ARE.

472
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,750
- STORM MAIL!

473
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,083
HERE I COME.

474
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,958
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
CAN'T HANDLE THE BREEZE?

475
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,750
- COWARD.
YOU JUST HAD TO GO

476
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,375
AND WRAP YOURSELF 
IN A WIND BARRIER.

477
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:49,875
THIS'LL BREAK THROUGH IT.

478
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:54,708
FIRE DRAGON IRON FIST!

479
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,250
- ( chuckles )
- WHAT THE--

480
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,416
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

481
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,333
WHY DID MY FIRE GO OUT?

482
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:04,958
- JUST AS I SUSPECTED,

483
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:07,541
YOU'RE COMPLETELY HELPLESS
WITHOUT YOUR FLAMES.

484
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,166
LOOKS LIKE I HAVE
THE UPPER HAND.

485
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,208
- NO WAY!

486
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,166
- UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU,

487
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,250
THE WINDS OF MY STORM MAIL
ATTACK BLOW OUTWARDLY.

488
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,291
IF YOU GET TOO CLOSE,
IT'LL SMOTHER YOUR FLAMES,

489
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,375
LEAVING YOU
POWERLESS AGAINST ME.

490
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:26,208
- OH, YEAH!

491
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:30,875
- FIRE CAN NEVER DEFEAT WIND!

492
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,875
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

493
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:14,583
- Lucy: OKAY, SO WE'VE ERZA,

494
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,416
NATSU, GRAY, AND ME
ALL ON ONE TEAM.

495
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,333
WE'RE A PRETTY AWESOME
LITTLE MIX, DON'T YOU THINK?

496
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,791
- Mirajane: MOST DEFINITELY.

497
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,791
IN FACT, THE FOUR OF YOU
MAY BE THE BEST TEAM

498
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:24,666
IN ALL OF FAIRY TAIL.
- WOW, YOU REALLY THINK SO?

499
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,083
OH, I BET IF WE START PICKING UP
A LOT OF JOBS,

500
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,166
I'LL BE FAMOUS
LIKE THEM IN NO TIME.

501
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,666
( giggles )

502
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,708
- Both: NEXT TIME...

503
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:34,166
- Mirajane:
I WONDER HOW MANY TOWNS

504
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,791
YOUR TEAM IS GONNA DESTROY?

505
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,125
AT LEAST TWO OR THREE,

506
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:39,083
BUT PROBABLY MORE 
LIKE FOUR OR FIVE.

507
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:41,333
- Lucy: COME ON.
IT'S OUR FIRST JOB.
