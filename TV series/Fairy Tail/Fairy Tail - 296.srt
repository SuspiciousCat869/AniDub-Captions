1
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:23,791
Ha.

2
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:27,125
I love your eastern
kimono. It's beautiful.

3
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,291
However...

4
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:32,916
...I'm afraid your blood
is going to stain it.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
[KAGURA] No. Where is all this
magic power coming from?

6
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,583
[gasps]

7
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,916
[KAGURA]
Her power is so intense.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,958
The entire battlefield
is frozen in terror.

9
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:47,208
She has to be a member
of the Spriggan Twelve.

10
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:50,166
Your bangs kind of
remind me of Randi's.

11
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,333
Now this will be fun.

12
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:55,541
[KAGURA]
Huh?

13
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:57,250
I didn't see her.

14
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,625
[BRANDISH groans]

15
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,625
Wait, where am I?

16
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,500
[LUCY]
The infirmary.

17
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,500
[LUCY]
Sorry, but Master insisted

18
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,083
that we leave those on you.

19
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,375
Hopefully they should be at
least a bit more comfortable

20
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,791
now that they're not
behind your back, though.

21
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:49,916
[BRANDISH]
Where's Marin?

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,083
You mean, Mister "A-Plus"?

23
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,333
He's locked up.

24
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,750
[CANA]
Right where he belongs.

25
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,583
Freakin' psycho was tryin'
to choke you to death.

26
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,666
You owe your life to
these young ladies.

27
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,583
They saved you for
some reason. So...

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,125
Why did you help?

29
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,208
[CANA]
Ugh. Think about it, would ya?

30
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,958
It's because you couldn't
tell us anything

31
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,750
if you'd just croaked
on the floor down there!

32
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,750
[BRANDISH] I still won't
tell you anything.

33
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,083
Well, besides that,

34
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,750
we really don't want anybody
to die on our watch.

35
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,583
Not even our enemies.

36
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,583
[BRANDISH] Great, so
you'll just torture me.

37
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,666
We don't do that stuff either.

38
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,500
I will if you want me to!

39
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,125
Cana!

40
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,916
I mean, we took a bath
together, didn't we?

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,916
I dunno. I just don't feel
like you're an evil person.

42
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,625
I'll tell you everything
I know about Layla.

43
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,250
[gasps]

44
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,500
On two conditions:

45
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,666
Lose these and allow me to
talk to Lucy in private.

46
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,416
I think you may be
overplaying your hand here.

47
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,916
No, it's fine. I'll let
her have that, for now.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,750
Very well then. Suppose
we'll leave you be.

49
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:07,250
I'll remove the chain,
but the Sealstone stays on.

50
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:10,875
[CANA] If she tries anything,
you just holler. Okay, Lucy?

51
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:20,375
First off, my full
name is Brandish Mu.

52
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,625
My mom's was Grammie.

53
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:28,416
She was a servant, and
worked for Layla Heartfilia.

54
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,833
When your mother quit being
a Celestial Spirit wizard,

55
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:36,333
she entrusted three of her keys
to her most loyal servants.

56
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:38,875
The key for Capricorn
went to Zordio.

57
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,541
Cancer went to Supetto.

58
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,833
Sweet old Supetto!

59
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,583
[BRANDISH]
And as for my mom,

60
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:48,875
she was given the key that
unlocks Aquarius' gate.

61
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,291
Mom had a lot of
respect for Layla,

62
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,458
and that key was her most
treasured possession,

63
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,250
without a doubt.

64
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:59,458
She took great care of it and
even polished it every day.

65
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:03,250
But still, somehow, it must've
not been good enough,

66
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,416
because your mother
betrayed her.

67
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,041
Huh? How so?

68
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:12,625
Tell me, exactly where did
you get the Aquarius key?

69
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,666
Well, from Mom.

70
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,416
But she'd given it to
my mother years before.

71
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,458
So how could she have possibly
passed it along to you?

72
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,000
It's easy.

73
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:27,125
She simply took the key back
after she murdered my mother.

74
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,000
[gasps]

75
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:32,250
No way. That's crazy.

76
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,291
You're so hopelessly naive.

77
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,958
Reality is not what you
choose to believe in.

78
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,291
[LUCY screams]

79
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:46,625
You also need to learn to
not blindly trust people.

80
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,083
[LUCY]
Please.

81
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,041
[BRANDISH]
Sorry it has to be this way,

82
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:55,458
but I can't take revenge
on Layla herself.

83
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,958
Since your mom's dead,

84
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:06,041
I'll have to get my
vengeance by killing you.

85
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,833
Just give up.

86
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,333
And die.

87
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:13,416
[LUCY grunting]

88
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,208
[BRANDISH gasps]

89
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:28,000
Are you telling
stories about my key?

90
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,625
Aquarius, it's you.

91
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:36,166
Long time no see, Lucy.

92
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,875
I thought you'd
never come back.

93
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,583
It's a miracle!
I missed you so much.

94
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:54,000
Calm down. I'm not
back for good.

95
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,083
About a year after
my key was broken,

96
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,583
a new one appeared
somewhere in the world.

97
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:02,375
This will allow a human to
open my gate once again.

98
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,833
Anyway, even though no one

99
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,041
has made a new
contract as of yet,

100
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,125
the Celestial Spirit King
granted me passage

101
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,833
into this world.

102
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:12,208
However, I can't stay long.

103
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,458
[gasps]

104
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,875
Okay.

105
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:19,208
At least I get to see your
face again, so I'm happy.

106
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:22,750
And it's been even longer
for us. Huh, Brandish?

107
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:25,958
[LUCY]
You know her?

108
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,625
Yeah, of course I do.

109
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,875
Didn't she tell you her mother
had my key for a little while?

110
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,500
The two of us really had
some fun times together

111
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,541
back in the old days, didn't we?

112
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,125
[grumbles]

113
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,458
Listen, you brat!

114
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,458
When someone asks you
a question, answer it!

115
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,083
Yes! Forgive me.
Please, mistress!

116
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,583
[LUCY]
Whoa. What is going on here?

117
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,166
I always knew you'd grow up to
be some kinda twisted chick

118
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,375
and I'll bet that nasty attitude

119
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,541
has kept the boys
away, hasn't it?

120
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:51,916
[BRANDISH]
Yes, ma'am.

121
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,791
[LUCY]
Uhh...

122
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,541
Been forever since I've
seen a good dog impression.

123
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,708
[BRANDISH barking]

124
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,583
Now there's a good girl.

125
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,000
Thank you, kind
mistress. Woof!

126
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,583
So behave!

127
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,958
Thank you, kind
mistress, I will!

128
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,833
Okay. That's weird.

129
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,208
[AQUARIUS]
In case you've forgotten,

130
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,791
I'm your master,
and Lucy is mine.

131
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:18,791
You understand what that
means, don't you, Brandish?

132
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,291
[BRANDISH]
I do, but nevertheless,

133
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,000
I can't forgive Layla
for killing my mother.

134
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,750
Someone has to pay for that!

135
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,625
I hope you realize how
stupid that sounds.

136
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,541
Besides, Layla
wasn't responsible

137
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,583
for Grammie's death
in the first place.

138
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,875
[BOTH gasp]

139
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,458
That's why I'm here.

140
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,750
To tell you the truth
about what happened.

141
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:41,083
Or more accurately,
to show you what happened.

142
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,458
What's going on?

143
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,416
We're mermaids?

144
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,208
[LUCY]
Hey, Aquarius! Care to explain?

145
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,416
We're inside the
Memory of the Stars.

146
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,583
A place where the memories

147
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,916
of the Celestial Spirits
are archived.

148
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,291
This may feel like a dream,

149
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,166
but let me make it
abundantly clear

150
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:04,291
that everything you see and
hear is exactly as it happened.

151
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,750
Follow me.

152
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,500
[LUCY]
Somebody's down there!

153
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,416
[AQUARIUS]
That's Anna Heartfilia.

154
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,625
She was your ancestor

155
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,916
and also a powerful
Celestial Spirit wizard.

156
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,083
[AQUARIUS]
Four hundred years ago,

157
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,541
an ambitious plan
was put into action

158

with the Black Wizard,
the dragons,

159
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,791
and the Celestial magic
users working together.

Is that Zeref?

00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,875
Emperor Spriggan?

162
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,458
The plan was to send warriors

163
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,666
created to defeat
Acnologia into the future.

164
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,375
The time travel
was made possible

165
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,125
by a special kind
of magic: Eclipse.

166
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,791
Originated in the
Celestial world.

167
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,916
Anna opened this
door to the future,

168
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,333
and for generations,
the Heartfilia family waited

169
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,708
until the time came to unseal.

170
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,541
But what were they waiting for?

171
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:56,750
For the Eclipse to work,

172
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,041
you need to have one
Celestial Spirit wizard

173
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:02,125
stationed at the entrance
and one at the exit.

174
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,333
This plan needed the
exit set in a future

175
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,250
with enough Ether-nano to fuel
the warriors passing through,

176
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,666
but no one in your family knew
when that time would come,

177
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,833
so they waited.

178
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,166
As it turned out,

179
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,750
the Eclipse was ready
during Layla's generation.

180
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:15,916
[LUCY]
Mom!

181
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,166
[AQUARIUS]
Opening the gate required

182
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,041
all twelve of the Zodiac keys.

183
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,500
[AQUARIUS] Unfortunately,
Grammie had moved to Alakitasia,

184
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,541
and because of the distance,
Layla couldn't reach her in time

185
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,291
to get back my
key for this task.

186
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:33,500
So to compensate for the
missing magic power,

187
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,416
she used her own life
force in its place.

188
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,083
She did?

189
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:41,416
[AQUARIUS] As far as opening
the gate, her gamble paid off.

190
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,875
But the toll it took on her
already waning health

191
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:47,708
caused her to develop severe
Magic Deficiency syndrome.

192
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,958
Grammie learned of this
several days later,

193
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,791
and traveled back to Ishgar.

194
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:56,208
Layla, my lady. I'm so sorry.

195
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,541
Can you find it in your
heart to forgive me?

196
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:02,333
Sweet Grammie, I don't
blame you for any of this.

197
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,875
Truly.

198
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,458
I appreciate all you've done
for me and my daughter,

199
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,666
but I'm not fit
to have this key.

200
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,833
Will you please take
it back, my lady?

201
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,583
I have no need for it.

202
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,083
I can't use Celestial
magic anymore.

203
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:18,083
Well then, surely you
can give it to Lucy.

204
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,708
She's obviously gifted.

205
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:23,208
I know she'll grow up to be
a great wizard like you.

206
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,541
Thankfully, my family's
duty to open the Eclipse

207
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,750
has ended with me.

208
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,625
I didn't want that
burden to fall on Lucy.

209
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:35,208
Now she's free...
to live her own life.

210
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:38,625
Which reminds me, I hope
Brandish is doing well.

211
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,291
[GRAMMIE]
Yes, she's a good girl.

212
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,916
She'll probably throw a tantrum

213
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,500
when she learns Aquarius
isn't coming back, though.

214
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:48,416
She and Lucy are around
the same age, right?

215
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,000
[GRAMMIE] Yes. I'd love
to bring her by sometime.

216
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,875
I think the two of them
could be good friends.

217
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,041
I think so, too.

218
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,125
[LAYLA]
Just like we are.

219
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,250
[GRAMMIE]
That's sweet, my lady,

220
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,000
but I'm just a humble servant.

221
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:13,416
[LAYLA] No, Grammie.
I consider you a friend.

222
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,166
[GRAMMIE]
Thank you, my lady.

224

[BRANDISH]
Mom!

225
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,833
This is all because of you.

226
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:39,625
You're the reason...
she's dying.

227
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:42,541
Zordio, I...

228
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,375
Oh, God, no!

[gasps]

230
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:52,833
You're right. It really
is all my fault.

231
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,166
I deserve to be punished.

232
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,500
Yes, you do! You
could've saved her!

233
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:03,083
I'm begging you, Zordio.

234
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:06,041
Please. Spare my daughter.

235
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:09,750
My dear Brandish.
Promise you won't hurt her.

236
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:15,333
I'm willing to sacrifice
my own life to save hers.

237
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:18,375
It's my last wish.

238

[screams]

239
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,958
Oh, Mama!

240
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,458
I believe in my heart

241
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:34,416
that you and I can still be
great friends after all this.

242
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,208
Like our moms wanted.

243
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:40,041
There's something that we still
need to talk about before I--

244
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,458
Ya gotta help me!

245
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:43,916
What's wrong, Happy?

246
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,166
I don't know why,

247
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,041
but Natsu just stopped
moving all of a sudden!

248
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,875
Somebody has to
help him right now!

249
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,875
What's going on?

250
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,000
Certainly a lot of commotion!

251
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,291
[HAPPY] Natsu was in the
middle of fighting Zeref,

252
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,958
but then we had to pull back.

253
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:07,083
I was trying to keep him safe,
but the next thing I knew,

254
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,750
he just went limp and quiet.

255
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,000
Hey, Natsu! What's the matter?

256
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,291
Say something!

257
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:16,125
Hold on. What in the hell
are you doing here?

258
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:19,083
I don't have time
to explain it to you.

259
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,541
I can't even hear
his heart beating.

260
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,875
Natsu! Please don't die!

261
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,625
There's no way.

262
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,000
[PORLYUSICA]
Move it!

263
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,458
[PORLYUSICA]
Of course he had to go off

264
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:41,916
and do something as
foolish as always.

265
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,416
He's been overtaxing his
magic power for years,

266
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,708
resulting in an
anti-Ether-nano tumor.

267
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,541
What does that mean?

268
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,791
A malignant mass is
growing inside his body.

269
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,916
And unless it's removed,
he'll soon be dead.

270
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,666
Can't we get somebody
to take it out?

271
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:06,000
Of all the healers in
Ishgar, none can do that.

272
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,833
[CANA]
Not even Wendy Or Shelia?

273

[PORLYUSICA]
I'm afraid it's impossible.

274
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,458
Then what are we gonna do?

275
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,333
[PORLYUSICA]
I'm sorry.

276
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,500
This can't be real.

00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:22,416
Come on! Please say something!

Hey, take these off.

281
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,291
Let me use my magic.

282
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:39,000
I can change the size
of anything I want.

283
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:42,041
So if I know the exact
location of his tumor,

284
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:45,708
I can make it small enough
that it never poses any risk.

285
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,541
You'd really do it?

286

If you can save him,
I'll do whatever you want!

[MAKAROV]
What a nightmare.

288

Leave it to Natsu to rush
out on some fool's errand

289
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,958
and come back in this condition!

Your crabbiness isn't
making things any better.

You wouldn't know anything
about that, huh?

I'm going to ignore
that comment.

293

Natsu will recover, all thanks
to that western girl's magic.

294

I never imagined we'd get
a helping hand from the enemy.

After this turn

Until the war is over,
I can't answer that for sure.

Since I'm still your prisoner,
can you take me back to my cell?

Oh, it's chilly, so my
coat would be nice.

299
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:38,041
It's rather odd. Why would
she volunteer to go back?

That was so nice. Thank you.

00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,958
Yeah.

318
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:36,375
That means, now it's out
there somewhere in the world.

319
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,791
Maybe it's close by, in Ishgar,

320
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,458
or maybe all the
way in Alakitasia.

321
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,500
Or even some other
continent altogether.

322
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,083
But what's certain is
I can't give you any clues

323
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,833
as to where it is.

324
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:52,458
That's okay. I can't
lose a friend like you,

325
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,375
so I'll do whatever
it takes to find it.

326
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,375
Thanks, Lucy.

327
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,750
I'm actually kind of looking
forward to seeing you again

328
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:09,166
Plus, there's somethin' I
really wanna do when it's over.

329
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,958
Aye, Sir!

330
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,875
[LUCY]
Now I have something, too.

331
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,416
We can't afford to lose.

332
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:23,333
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, the battle
to liberate Hargeon continues.


333
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,708
And though the allied
forces of Lamia Scale


334
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,916
and Mermaid Heel
have fought bravely,

335
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,291
the ruthless Dimaria
and Wall divisions

336
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:34,833
of the invading Alvarez Army
have forced them to retreat.

337
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,458
[LYON] Their numbers
are too great for us.

338
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:41,625
At this point, we can't even get
anywhere close to the city.

339
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,083
I know.

340
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:46,083
But we have to take it back
to stave off the invasion.

341
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,000
Because if we don't,
they're going to keep on

342
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:51,333
sending ships full
of reinforcements.

343
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,458
[SHELIA]
We have to get the upper hand.

344
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:56,125
Aw, I wish Wendy were here.

345
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,041
Kagura. Are you okay?

346
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:09,875
What the--?

00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,833
[SOLDIERS, WIZARDS gasping]

[KAGURA gasps]

349
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,833
Don't stare! Turn away!

350
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,333
Lookin' good.

351
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,291
[KAGURA growls]

352
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,458
You'll pay for this!

353
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,875
Right now, I'm not okay.

354
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,375
Poor thing.

355
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,458
[LISLIE] Get the hell away
from her, ya buncha creepers!

356
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,708
Jeez!

357
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,583
It's strange.

358
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:35,708
She shredded my clothes, but
she didn't even move a muscle.

359
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,833
We were a ways apart,

360
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:41,500
but she tore my kimono
to pieces in an instant.

361
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,291
Well, I'd be willing
to bet she was using

362
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,291
some kind of long-range
spell on you.

363
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,625
Yeah, maybe!

364
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,333
And like, her sword
could just be for show!

365
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,458
I can always tell when there's
aggression coming my way.

366
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,583
I can feel it.

367
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:58,041
So it's odd I didn't
sense it this time.

368
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,875
She was completely
motionless and calm.

369
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,416
That is weird.

370
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,708
Out of all of us, you're not the
type to let your guard down

371
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,125
and fall prey to a
sneak attack like that.

372
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:10,333
Well, then how do you
think it happened?

373
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:13,416
Her power is like nothing
I've experienced before.

374
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,041
I'm not sure what it is.

375
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,958
But it's dangerous
and unpredictable.

376
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,250
[NARRATOR]
In the snow-covered north,


377
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,750
Sabertooth and Blue Pegasus
have been pushed back


378
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,583
by the invaders from Alvarez,

379
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:28,458
led by the mysterious
and grim figure, Bloodman.

380
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:31,250
[STING] I've lost count of
the number of casualties.

381
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,833
I don't know if we can
handle this many troops.

382
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,916
I think it's really bad, too.

383
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,708
Even so, what other
choice do we have?

384
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,791
[YUKINO] Right, we have to keep
our front line strong,

385
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:42,958
or next thing you know,

386
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,083
they could be marching
right into Crocus.

387
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,583
Not to trivialize things,

388
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:49,416
but we don't want Sabertooth
to be the reason we lost.

389
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,041
Natsu'd never let
me live that down.

390
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,333
And I definitely do not wanna
be on Gajeel's bad side.

391
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,833
Help should be
arriving here shortly.

392
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,041
It's up to us.

393
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,833
We gotta hold things
together till they come!

394
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,500
Yeah, I think so, too!

395
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,208
[STING]
Enough mopin' around.

396
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,750
Let's show 'em what
Sabertooth is made of!

397
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,166
[NARRATOR]
And, to the east,

398
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,416
another battle has reached
its disastrous conclusion.

399
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,791
How lame!

400
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,166
You had a four-against-one
advantage

401
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,583
and this is the best
you old farts can do?

402
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,541
This does not bode well.

403
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,500
He took us down with
no help from the others.

404
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:30,583
I'm afraid going to Alvarez
has only made him stronger.

405
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,625
How can this be?

406
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,083
We've failed.

407
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:38,291
We've sullied the name of
the Four Emperors of Ishgar.

My old friend...

Sadly, I'll never see
your smiling face again.

00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,291
Huh?

00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,625
Sorry, Mavis.

412
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,458
I think turning you
into firewood

413
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:53,291
is going to be a lot
of fun, Warrod.

414
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:58,333
No joke. Time to
say God-bye-bye.

defeats the Four

Meanwhile, Gajeel, Erza, Laxus,

to lend their strength to our

stop to catch their breath.
