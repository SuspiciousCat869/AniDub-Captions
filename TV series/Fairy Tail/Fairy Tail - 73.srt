1
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:21,208
- Narrator: IN A
LAND FAR, FAR AWAY,

2
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,500
LIES THE KINGDOM OF FIORE.

3
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:26,500
A SMALL, PEACEFUL NATION
OF SEVENTEEN MILLION,

4
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,875
AND A PLACE FILLED WITH MAGIC.

5
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:32,208
FOUND IN EVERY HOME, BOUGHT
AND SOLD IN EVERY MARKETPLACE,

6
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,958
FOR MOST, MAGIC
IS MERELY A TOOL.

7
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,041
FOR SOME, HOWEVER,
MAGIC IS AN ART

8
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,750
AND THEY'VE DEVOTED THEIR
LIVES TO ITS PRACTICE.

9
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:43,208
THESE WIZARDS BAND TOGETHER
TO FORM MAGICAL GUILDS

10
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,416
WHICH DOT THE
LANDSCAPE OF FIORE,

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,041
BUT THERE IS A CERTAIN
GUILD IN A CERTAIN TOWN

12
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:50,500
THAT SOARS HIGH
ABOVE THE REST.

13
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,291
ONE FROM WHICH COUNTLESS
LEGENDS HAVE BEEN BORN.

14
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,666
ITS NAME IS FAIRY TAIL.

15
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:59,333
- ( theme song playing )

16
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

17
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,083
- Narrator: IT'S CHERRY BLOSSOM
SEASON HERE IN MAGNOLIA.

18
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:37,208
AND WITH IT, COMES A SPECIAL
EVENT FOR THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD.

19
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,583
- Makarov: HEED MY WORDS,
DEAR FRIENDS!

20
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,791
IF YOU FANCY YOURSELF
A MEMBER OF THIS GUILD,

21
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,208
YOU MUST HONE YOUR SKILLS
BOTH DAY AND NIGHT.

22
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,791
DO SO AND FORTUNE
WILL ALWAYS BE YOURS.

23
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,125
NEVER FORGET YOU ARE
RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN KEEP.

24
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,958
WHILE MANY OF YOUR
DAYS WILL BE SUNNY,

25
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,375
OTHERS WILL BE CLOUDED
IN HARDSHIP.

26
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:58,708
PEACE AND PROSPERITY, TEMPERED
BY TRAGEDY AND HEARTBREAK.

27
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,083
HOWEVER, I HAVE FAITH
WE CAN FIGHT THROUGH

28
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,833
EVEN THE DARKEST OF DAYS AS
LONG AS WE HAVE EACH OTHER.

29
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,791
YOU ARE SURROUNDED,
NOT BY CO-WORKERS,

30
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,333
BUT BY AN ENDURING
AND LOVING FAMILY!

31
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,791
TOGETHER WE ARE ONE!

32
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,416
THAT'S WHAT BEING A
FAIRY TAIL WIZARD IS ABOUT!

33
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,125
- ( crowd cheering )

34
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,125
- I COULDN'T BE MORE
PROUD OF WHAT YOU KIDS

35
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,958
HAVE ACCOMPLISHED
IN THE LAST YEAR.

36
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,458
SO TO COMMEMORATE YOUR
HARD WORK AND DILIGENCE,

37
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,541
TOMORROW WE WILL BE HOLDING,

38
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,375
THE HIGHLY ANTICIPATED
FLOWER VIEWING PARTY!

39
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,541
- ( crowd cheering )

40
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,791
- Makarov: THAT MAKES TODAY
THE PRE-CELEBRATION! SO DRINK!

41
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,500
- BUNCH OF MORONS.

42
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,458
- Happy: RAINBOW
CHERRY BLOSSOMS.

43
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,208
- TAKE IT EASY.

44
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,708
SAVE THE DRINKING FOR THE
CELEBRATION TOMORROW.

45
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,083
- YEAH, NO JOKE.

46
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,875
I'LL NEVER GET THIS WHOLE
"FLOWER PARTY" THING.

47
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,458
YOU GUYS ARE JUST LOOKING
FOR AN EXCUSE TO BOOZE IT UP.

48
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,541
- WHOA, THE POT'S CALLING
THE KETTLE BLACK.

49
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,500
- NO KIDDING, SHE DRINKS AS
IF EVERY DAY'S A CELEBRATION.

50
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,583
- FLOWER PARTIES
ARE FREAKING MANLY.

51
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,166
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

52
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,708
YOU GONNA TAKE HOME THE GRAND
PRIZE FROM THE BINGO GAME, DAD?

53
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,875
- YOU BET. THIS IS MY YEAR.

54
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,750
SO YOU BETTER BE THERE
TO ROOT FOR YOUR POP.

55
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:08,000
- I DIDN'T GET A SINGLE NUMBER
DURING LAST YEAR'S BINGO GAME.

56
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,875
BUT THAT JUST MEANS I'LL GET ALL
OF THE NUMBERS THIS YEAR, BABY.

57
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,416
- IT DOESN'T REALLY
WORK THAT WAY.

58
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,083
- LET HER HAVE HER
MOMENT, MAN.

59
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,375
- YOU PEOPLE MAKE
NO SENSE AT ALL.

60
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,708
WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT
SOME SISSY FLOWERS?

61
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,416
THEY GOT HIDDEN POWERS
OR SOMETHING?

62
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,916
- Nab: IT'S A BIG DEAL
AROUND HERE.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,625
I MEAN, EVEN OUR CLIENTS
KNOW THE SCORE.

64
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,083
- Gajeel: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

65
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,916
- Nab: THE BOARD GETS PRETTY
BARREN THIS TIME OF YEAR

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,500
BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS NONE
OF US WANT TO WORK

67
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:29,583
DURING THE CELEBRATION.

68
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,625
- Gajeel: RIDICULOUS.

69
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,750
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
DO YOU EVER WORK?

70
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:35,958
- ( siren wails)

71
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,250
- YOU'RE BLUER THAN NORMAL.

72
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,750
- IT'S MY DEAR GRAY!

73
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,375
HE MUST HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT
THE PARTY AND LEFT ON A JOB.

74
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,458
IF MY BELOVED ISN'T HERE,
THEN I WON'T HAVE ANYONE

75
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:47,250
TO CUDDLE AND LOOK AT
THE FLOWERS WITH.

76
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,791
- I'M SORRY, BUT YOU KNOW
THAT A WIZARD

77
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,333
HAS TO EARN HIS
DAILY KEEP SOMEHOW.

78
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,875
- THAT'S FUNNY COMING FROM YOU!
- LAY OFF!

79
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,375
- HE'S GONE. WHY?

80
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,875
I COULD HAVE
HELPED HIM OUT!

81
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,166
- IT WOULD'VE BEEN OVERKILL.

82
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,416
HE'S ALREADY TEAMED
UP WITH NATSU,

83
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,958
AND THEY DON'T NEED
ANOTHER PERSON!

84
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,500
- HANG ON.
IF THAT'S THE CASE,

85
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,250
WHY DID WENDY AND CARLA
GET TO TAG ALONG WITH THEM?

86
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,666
- BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH NEW TO
THE GUILD FROM CAIT SHELTER.

87
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,291
THEY NEED TO GET THEIR FEET WET
SOONER OR LATER, DON'T THEY?

88
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,791
- YES, I KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT.

89
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,375
THAT DOESN'T CHANGE
THE FACT,

90
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,041
THAT HE ABANDONED ME!

91
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:23,416
- OPEN, GATE OF THE
CLOCK CONSTELLATION.

92
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,833
HOROLOGIUM!

93
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,041
- Narrator: THE FRIGID
PEAKS OF MT. HAKOBE.

94
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,083
- Horologium:
"I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE,

95
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,833
"YOU'D THINK I'D KNOW TO
WEAR SOMETHING WARMER.

96
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,666
"I'M FREEZING MY RUMP OFF!"

97
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,541
SHE EXCLAIMS WITH
GREAT DISCOMFORT.

98
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,416
- I CAN'T FEEL MY LEGS!

99
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,750
- YOU HAVE TO GET USED
TO THE ELEMENTS

100
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,875
IF YOU'RE GOING TO
DO WORK LIKE THIS.

101
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,208
- "GET IN HERE WITH ME, WENDY.

102
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,625
"YOU DON'T WANNA
CATCH A COLD."

103
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,416
SHE CHATTERS WITH
NURTURING CONCERN.

104
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,166
- MMM. OKAY, THEN!

105
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,041
AS LONG AS YOU'RE SURE
IT WON'T BE ANY TROUBLE.

106
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,208
COMING, CARLA?

107
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,083
- NO THANK YOU, I'LL BE FINE.

108
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,458
YOU SHOULD BE TRYING TO OVERCOME
THESE CONDITIONS AS WELL.

109
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,416
FOCUS YOUR MIND AND
ADAPT TO DISCOMFORT.

110
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,750
- OUR SEARCH SHOULD BE EASIER
NOW THAT THE STORM HAS CALMED.

111
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:16,250
- I'M STARVING. I COULD
EAT AN ENTIRE VOLCANO.

112
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,958
- IT'S SO WARM IN HERE.

113
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,375
- YEAH? THEN WHY AM
I GETTING FROSTBITE?

114
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,583
- WHOA! IT'S SO COLD THAT EVEN
I'M STARTING TO GET CHILLY.

115
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,458
- HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
PUTTING ON A SHIRT?

116
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:26,666
- ( grunts )

117
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,541
- HEY, NATSU.
I'M NOT CONVINCED

118
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,958
THAT THIS HERB WE'RE
LOOKING FOR EVEN EXISTS.

119
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,708
- IT'S GOTTA.
WHY WOULD SOMEONE

120
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:35,000
POST A JOB TO FIND IT
IF IT DIDN'T EXIST?

121
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,791
- IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.

122
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,416
A WIZARD CAN BOOST
THEIR MAGIC POWER

123
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,541
JUST BY PUTTING THIS
STUFF IN TEA OR CAKE?

124
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,625
I BET IT'S GOT SOME
WICKED SIDE EFFECTS.

125
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,666
LIKE YOU GROW A SECOND HEAD
OR IT GIVES YOU SERIOUS GAS.

126
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,541
IT'S LIKE THEY SAY,
"THERE'S ALWAYS POISON

127
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:48,875
TO EVERY GOOD FISH!"

128
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,541
- I THINK YOU MIGHT MEAN,
"THERE'S NO SUCH THING

129
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,083
AS A FREE LUNCH."

130
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,458
- I'VE BEEN SAYING IT
WRONG ALL THIS TIME?

131
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,166
- Erza: "SIDE-EFFECTS"
ARE NOT OUR CONCERN.

132
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,041
THE JOB FLIER SAID TO
COLLECT AND DELIVER,

133
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,500
SO THAT'S WHAT
WE'LL DO.

134
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,333
BUT IF WE FIND AN EXCESS,
THERE'S NO REASON WE CAN'T

135
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,166
TAKE SOME TO USE FOR BINGO
PRIZES TOMORROW. SOUND GOOD?

136
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,333
- YEAH. HEY, HERBS,
COME OUT AND FIGHT ME!

137
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,125
- HEY NATSU. SHUT UP.

138
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,375
- WHAT'D YOU SAY?

139
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,208
- HOW'S A PLANT SUPPOSED
TO ANSWER YOU,

140
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,083
LET ALONE COME DOWN
HERE AND DUKE IT OUT?

141
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,458
THEN AGAIN, IF IT COULD,

142
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,750
I BET IT'D WIPE THE FLOOR
WITH YOUR FACE.

143
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,041
- WATCH IT, FROSTY.
IF YOU GOT SOMETHING TO SAY,

144
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,833
WHY DON'T YOU SAY
IT TO MY FACE?

145
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,166
- NEXT TIME YOU GET THE BRIGHT
IDEA TO TALK TO A PLANT,

146
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,375
KEEP IT TO YOURSELF.

147
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,458
- WOULD YOU SHUT UP?

148
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,125
- Both: AYE!

149
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,958
- MAN, I CAN'T WAIT TO GET THIS
JOB DONE SO WE CAN GO BACK HOME.

150
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,000
- THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO
BEFORE TOMORROW'S PARTY.

151
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,500
- YEAH, I'M REALLY LOOKING
FORWARD TO IT.

152
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:38,208
- Lucy: JUST WAIT 'TIL YOU SEE
MAGNOLIA'S CHERRY BLOSSOMS!

153
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,541
NOT ONLY ARE THEY GORGEOUS
IN THE DAYLIGHT,

154
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,708
BUT THEY'RE
RAINBOW-COLORED AT NIGHT.

155
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,708
IT'S LIKE A DREAM.
TOMORROW'S GONNA ROCK.

156
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,041
- RAINBOW BLOSSOMS? WOW.

157
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,000
JUST THE THOUGHT OF
IT IS SUPER PRETTY.

158
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,333
- NO JOKE, SISTER.

159
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,208
- Horologium: THEY
PRATTLE, ON AND ON.

160
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,541
- Lucy: YOU'RE GONNA
LOVE IT, WENDY.

161
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,250
EVERYBODY BRINGS A
BOXED LUNCH WITH THEM

162
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,583
AND WE SPEND THE DAY
BENEATH THE CHERRY BLOSSOMS.

163
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,291
WE'LL PLAY GAMES AND PARTY,
SURROUNDED BY FLOWERS.

164
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,208
CAN YOU IMAGINE A
MORE PERFECT DAY?

165
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,000
( exclaims ) IT'S GONNA BE EPIC.

166
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:09,583
THAT'S WHY I WANNA WRAP THIS
UP AND GET BACK TO MAGNOLIA.

167
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,958
I'VE GOT MAJOR PREP TO DO.
FIRST, I NEED TO BAKE COOKIES,

168
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,541
THEN I'LL DECIDE WHETHER I
WANNA WEAR ONE OUTFIT

169
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,666
OR CHANGE IT UP AT NIGHT. THEN
I'LL FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO

170
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,166
WITH MY HAIR. THEN,
I'LL PROBABLY GO TO BED

171
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,708
WITHOUT WORKING ON MY NOVEL.

172
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,083
OH WELL, PROCRASTINATION IS
NOTHING NEW FOR ME AND THEN...

173
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,541
- WAIT
- HMM?

174
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,583
- I TAKE IT YOU WENT TO THE
FLOWER VIEWING PARTY LAST YEAR?

175
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,791
- HUH? WELL, ACTUALLY...

176
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,458
- THAT'S WEIRD.
IS ANYONE ALLOWED TO GO?

177
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,125
BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU'VE BEEN
WITH FAIRY TAIL

178
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,458
FOR LESS THAN A YEAR.

179
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,375
- OKAY. TRUTH IS, THIS'LL
BE MY FIRST TIME, TOO.

180
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:37,708
- REALLY?

181
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,541
( laughs )

182
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,291
- Lucy: I GUESS I'VE JUST
HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT IT

183
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,958
I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN
BEFORE, YOU KNOW?

184
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:47,041
- YEAH AND WE'LL GET
TO EXPERIENCE IT TOGETHER.

185
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,458
IF IT'S HALF AS GOOD
AS IT SOUNDS,

186
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:49,583
IT SHOULD BE A TON OF FUN.

187
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,375
ESPECIALLY SINCE
WE'LL BE CELEBRATING

188
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,000
WITH ALL OF OUR FRIENDS
IN FAIRY TAIL.

189
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,416
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

190
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,541
LET'S HURRY AND GET OUT
OF THIS FROZEN WASTELAND.

191
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,666
- ( alarm ringing ) - ON THAT
NOTE, I BID YOU FOND FAREWELL.

192
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,916
- ( both exclaiming )

193
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,791
- GET A GRIP.

194
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,125
- WE'LL GET HOME FASTER
IF YOU HELP FIND THE HERBS.

195
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,000
- Lucy: GIVE ME A BREAK.

196
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,416
- ( sniffing )

197
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,416
I FOUND YOU.

198
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,541
I KNEW YOU COULDN'T HIDE
FOREVER, YOU STUPID PLANT.

199
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,750
- BEHOLD THE POWER OF A
DRAGON SLAYER'S SCHNOZ.

200
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,625
- WAIT, HOW CAN YOU BE SURE
YOU'VE FOUND THE RIGHT HERBS,

201
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,000
HAVE YOU SMELLED THEM BEFORE?

202
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,083
- NU-UH. DOESN'T MATTER.
I KNOW THIS IS THEM.

203
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:27,333
- LET'S GO, HAPPY.
- AYE, SIR.

204
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,583
- WAIT FOR US, JERK.

205
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,208
- SO, WHO ELSE SAW
THAT ONE COMING?

206
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,291
- STOP GAWKING AND
START FOLLOWING HIM.

207
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,875
HIS WITS MAY BE DULL,
BUT HIS NOSE IS SHARP.

208
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,333
- AM I THE ONLY ONE,

209
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:41,125
WHO'S SUDDENLY FEELING A
SENSE OF IMPENDING CALAMITY?

210
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,833
- I HOPE YOUR HUNCH TURNS
OUT TO BE WRONG THIS TIME.

211
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:44,958
- ( yelling )

212
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,125
- ( whooping )

213
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,916
- YAY. - HE STARTS BRAGGING,
WE BURY HIM IN SNOW.

214
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,208
- WELL I'M IMPRESSED.

215
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,625
- SO YOUR HUNCH WAS WRONG.

216
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,708
- THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

217
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,208
- OKAY. LET'S PICK THESE
THINGS AND GET BACK HOME.

218
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,458
- AYE, SIR.

219
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,750
- ( growls )

220
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,666
- Narrator: THE
DECEPTIVE BLIZZARD-VERN,

221
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,166
ALSO KNOWN AS THE WHITE WYVERN,

222
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,875
A DRAGON-LIKE BEAST THAT MAKES
IT HOME IN HIGH ALTITUDES.

223
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:17,000
ALTHOUGH FEROCIOUS,
THESE CREATURES ARE HERBIVORES,

224
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:21,208
AND THE HERBS NATSU JUST
FOUND ARE ITS FAVORITE FOOD.

225
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,000
- YOU'RE KIDDING. - I DON'T
THINK IT WANTS TO SHARE.

226
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,708
- IT LOOKS LIKE WE'LL
GET TO FINISH THE JOB

227
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,500
AND TAKE HOME A JUICY BONUS
IN ONE FELL SWOOP.

228
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,541
WHITE WYVERN SCALES
GO FOR A LOT OF MONEY

229
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,333
AND THIS GUY'S GOT
PLENTY TO GO AROUND.

230
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,541
- SURE DOES.
YOU HEAR THAT, STINGY?

231
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,166
WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOUR FOOD AND
STRIP YOU FOR GOOD MEASURE.

232
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,041
- I SUGGEST THE FOUR
OF YOU STAND BACK.

233
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,500
LET US TAKE CARE OF THIS.

234
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,541
- WHAT?
- WE WANT IN ON THE ACTION, TOO.

235
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,583
- REQUIP.

236
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,833
VERY WELL THEN,
YOU MUST LISTEN CLOSELY.

237
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,666
ONCE WE'VE GOT
THE BEAST DISTRACTED,

238
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,291
GRAB AS MANY OF THE
HERBS AS YOU CAN.

239
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,375
- YES, MA'AM.
- I BEG YOUR PARDON?

240
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,541
- WAIT. WHY ARE YOU GIVING US
THE MOST

241
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,083
DANGEROUS PART OF THE JOB?

242
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,333
- IS THAT A PROBLEM?

243
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,416
- NO, MA'AM.
WE'RE ALL OVER IT.

244
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,416
- YOU READY?
LET'S DO THIS.

245
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,708
- Both: HERE GOES.

246
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,083
- ( growling )

247
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,791
- ( whimpering )

248
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,000
- WE GOTTA PICK UP THE PACE.

249
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,333
- PLEASE REFRAIN
FROM SPEAKING TO ME.

250
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,666
- FIRE DRAGON,
BRILLIANT FLAME!

251
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,500
- WHOA, HE DEFLECTED IT.

252
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,333
- AND NOW IT'S HEADED
IN OUR DIRECTION.

253
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,708
- ( all screaming )

254
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,791
- ICE-MAKE SAUCER!

255
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,791
- ( screaming )

256
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,625
- TRY DEFLECTING THIS.

257
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,041
- UH-OH.
- WHAT IN THE HECK?

258
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,583
- ( screaming )

259
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,750
- IDIOTS. DON'T YOU
KNOW HOW TO DODGE?

260
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,416
- YEAH, OF COURSE.

261
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,750
- BUT IT CAME AT US SO FAST.

262
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,500
- HOW IS THIS THING
SO POWERFUL?

263
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,083
- NO CLUE.

264
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,916
SORRY ERZA, BUT I AM NOT JUST
GONNA SIT ON THE SIDELINES.

265
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,833
- ( grunts )

266
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,583
DON'T GET COLD FEET!

267
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,750
NATSU, ERZA, LITTLE HELP?

268
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,125
- RIGHT.
- CONSIDER IT DONE.

269
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,416
- ( screams )

270
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,916
- FIRE DRAGON IRON FIST!

271
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,541
- SCORE. LUCY, YOU ROCK.

272
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,458
IT'S NO WONDER YOU'RE
SUCH A VALUABLE MEMBER

273
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,375
OF FAIRY TAIL'S STRONGEST TEAM.

274
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:17,833
- ( rumbling )

275
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:19,916
- AVALANCHE!

276
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,375
- IS EVERYONE OKAY?

277
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,958
- ( retches )

278
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,166
- YOU'RE SICK? AN AVALANCHE
DOESN'T COUNT AS A VEHICLE.

279
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,458
- IT APPEARS MY
HUNCH WAS RIGHT.

280
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,041
- HEY! WHERE DID LUCY GO?

281
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,875
- LUCY, WHERE ARE YOU?

282
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,083
- I'M HERE. BARELY.

283
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,000
- Narrator: THE DAY OF THE
FLOWER VIEWING PARTY

284
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,625
HAS FINALLY ARRIVED.

285
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,291
- ( sneezes )

286
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,791
- Natsu: HOLD UP.

287
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,750
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GO?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

288
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,958
- TRUST ME, YOU DON'T WANNA
MISS MAGNOLIA'S FLOWERS.

289
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,458
- IT'S NOT BY CHOICE.

290
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,833
( moaning )

291
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,083
I WANTED TO GO SO BADLY.

292
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,750
- Happy: WELL, WHAT'S
KEEPING YOU FROM GOING?

293
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,666
- ARE YOU BOTH
BLIND OR SOMETHING?

294
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,333
I CAUGHT A NASTY COLD.

295
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:24,458
THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.
I'M GOING BACK TO BED.

296
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,666
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.
- HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER.

297
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,916
- Natsu: TALK ABOUT
A MAJOR DOWNER. THIS SUCKS.

298
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,416
- Happy: IT'S REALLY
BAD TIMING.

299
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,958
SHE'S BEEN SUPER EXCITED
ABOUT IT FOR A LONG TIME.

300
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,416
- MMM-HMM.

301
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,375
- A FLOWER PARTY?
YEAH, I'LL GO.

302
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,708
YOU JUST MADE MY DAY.

303
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,083
YAY! OH, I'M GONNA
BUY A NEW DRESS.

304
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,166
AND THEN I'LL BAKE
COOKIES FOR EVERYBODY.

305
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,041
- THIS'LL BE A BLAST.
- SHE'S SO CUTE.

306
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,750
I KEEP FORGETTING SHE WASN'T
AROUND FOR

307
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,083
LAST YEAR'S FESTIVITIES.

308
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,208
- THIS'LL BE FUN.

309
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,375
- A PARTY?

310
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,125
- YEAH, WE ALL GET
TOGETHER TO EAT, DRINK,

311
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,458
AND GO WILD UNDER THE
BEAUTIFUL CHERRY BLOSSOMS.

312
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,166
- WHY'RE YOU ALL FIRED UP?

313
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,666
- BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS
DREAMED OF SEEING THEM.

314
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,375
THE RAINBOW CHERRY BLOSSOMS.

315
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,125
NOW I WILL. I'M GONNA COUNT THE
DAYS UNTIL THE VIEWING PARTY.

316
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:08,375
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET TO
CELEBRATE WITH EVERYONE.

317
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,541
- THAT'S GOT TO
BE DISAPPOINTING.

318
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,583
- YEAH, I FEEL BAD FOR HER.

319
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,708
- ( people chattering )

320
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,666
- EAT UP, YOU GUYS.

321
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,208
THERE'S MORE WHERE
THAT CAME FROM.

322
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,125
- THIS ONE'S MINE,
SO KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF.

323
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,166
- SURPRISED YOU
ONLY BROUGHT ONE.

324
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,250
- AND NO ONE WOULD BE
STUPID ENOUGH TO TAKE IT.

325
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,708
- FLOWERS ARE MANLY!

326
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,333
- WHATEVER YOU SAY, BIG GUY.

327
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:33,666
- CAN I GET YOU
SOMETHING TO EAT?

328
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,375
- OR ANYTHING TO DRINK?

329
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,375
- WHAT? WHY ISN'T
LUCY COMING?

330
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:40,208
- DID SHE LOSE INTEREST?

331
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:43,541
- SHE'S GOT A COLD. I'VE NEVER
SEEN HER LOOK SO ROUGH.

332
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,041
- HOW DID SHE CATCH A COLD?

333
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,833
- HAVE YOU ALREADY FORGOTTEN?

334
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,916
- POOR LUCY, SHE WAS REALLY
LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS.

335
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,375
- HEY, WAIT.

336
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,916
WHY DON'T WE GO TO HER PLACE,
AND YOU CAN HEAL HER?

337
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,791
- I ALREADY DID THAT
EARLIER TODAY.

338
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,000
BUT SHE BE WON'T FULLY
RECOVERED 'TIL TOMORROW.

339
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,291
- THIS ISN'T HER DAY.

340
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,166
- ( moaning )
RAINBOW CHERRY BLOSSOMS.

341
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,458
I BET EVERYBODY'S HAVING THE
TIME OF THEIR LIVES RIGHT NOW.

342
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,833
AND I'M STUCK HERE IN BED.

343
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,375
- EVERYONE HAVE A CARD NOW?

344
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:21,666
LET THE ANNUAL FLOWER VIEWING
BINGO TOURNAMENT BEGIN.

345
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,208
- Crowd: BINGO!

346
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,083
- ( Makraov laughs )

347
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,875
WE'VE GOT SOME GREAT PRIZES
FOR THE TOURNAMENT THIS YEAR.

348
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,166
I HOPE YOU'RE ALL
READY TO PLAY.

349
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,500
- All: YEAH!

350
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,875
- ALL RIGHT!
EVERYONE READY?

351
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,333
- All: AYE, SIR!

352
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:40,375
- OKAY, THEN. YOU MAY NOW
POKE THE CENTER HOLE OPEN.

353
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,416
- THE GRAND PRIZE
IS AS GOOD AS MINE.

354
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,833
- KICK THEIR BUTTS, DAD.

355
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,166
- LET'S PLAY BINGO.

356
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,833
- THE FIRST NUMBER'S COMING UP.

357
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,166
- NUMBER TWENTY-FOUR.

358
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,333
- AWESOME. I GOT ONE ALREADY.

359
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,916
- MAN, I'M ALREADY BEHIND.

360
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,291
- Both: YOU'VE GOT THIS, LEVY!

361
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,875
- ( coughing )

362
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,916
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S BEEN
LESS THAN A YEAR SINCE I JOINED.

363
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,083
IT SEEMS LIKE FOREVER AGO
THAT I RAN AWAY FROM HOME,

364
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:16,166
DREAMING OF BECOMING
PART OF FAIRY TAIL.

365
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,708
I RAN INTO NATSU
PRETTY SOON AFTER THAT.

366
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,375
AND MY DREAM BECAME A REALITY.

367
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,666
IT ALL HAPPENED SO QUICKLY.

368
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,458
- Mirajane: NUMBER FIVE.

369
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:29,041
- I'VE GOT THAT ONE.
I'M A MAN!

370
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,000
- THAT'S GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

371
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,750
- I HAVEN'T GOTTEN
A SINGLE NUMBER.

372
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,583
- C'MON NATSU,
AREN'T YOU GONNA PLAY?

373
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,791
- Lucy: SO MUCH HAS
CHANGED IN MY LIFE,

374
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,666
AND IT ALL HAPPENED
IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE.

375
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,833
- NUMBER SIXTY-EIGHT.

376
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,291
- I GOT BINGO!

377
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,583
- SERIOUSLY?
- SHE'S REALLY INTO THIS.

378
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,458
- I'VE ALMOST GOT ONE AS WELL.
- ERZA GETS THE FIRST BINGO.

379
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:13,000
- I HAVE ONLY MY
TRAINING TO THANK.

380
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,208
SO, DO I WIN A SPECIAL PRIZE?

381
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,041
- UH-HUH. HERE.

382
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,333
AN AMAZING HERB RUMORED TO
TEMPORARILY INCREASE

383
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,625
A WIZARD'S MAGIC POWER.

384
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,666
- WHAT?
- Crowd: WOW!

385
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,541
- BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE PLANTS
THAT WE PICKED YESTERDAY.

386
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,583
AND IT'S ALREADY WILTING.

387
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,375
- YEAH, THAT'S BOUND TO HAPPEN
WHEN YOU BRING IT

388
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,166
INTO A WARMER CLIMATE.

389
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,416
- SO THAT'S IT.
MY PRECIOUS BINGO?

390
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,958
- I'M SORRY.

391
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,875
- Lucy: IT'S CRAZY.

392
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,833
SO MANY ADVENTURES IN SUCH
A SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME.

393
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,875
WOW.

394
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,166
( laughs )

395
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,208
WOW. NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

396
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,958
IT'S A MIRACLE I'M STILL ALIVE.

397
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,125
- BINGO!

398
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,500
- BUT HOW?
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN ONE NUMBER.

399
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,625
- FACE THE FACTS,
THIS AIN'T YOUR GAME.

400
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:06,958
- IT'S NOT OVER YET.

401
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,166
- I'VE GOT A HUNCH IT'S
OVER FOR THIS FELINE.

402
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,666
- WELL, MAYBE YOUR
HUNCH'LL BE WRONG THIS TIME.

403
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,208
- ( sighs )

404
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,541
WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF PRIZES
AND I DON'T EVEN HAVE ONE ROW.

405
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,250
I WAS HOPING I COULD
WIN SOMETHING FOR LUCY,

406
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,833
SO SHE'D HAVE A SOUVENIR.

407
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,041
- NUMBER ONE-FIFTEEN!

408
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,208
- All: BINGO! HUH?

409
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,541
- ALL THREE OF YOU?

410
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,041
- WELL, THIS IS A FIRST.

411
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,833
SO, LET'S HAVE A TIE-BREAKER,

412
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,416
WHERE THE BEST SHORT PERFORMANCE
WINS THE GRAND PRIZE.

413
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,875
- All: SHORT PERFORMANCE?

414
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,625
- THIS IS WHAT YOU
ARE COMPETING FOR.

415
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,916
TWO TICKETS FOR THREE DAYS AND
TWO NIGHTS OF LUXURY

416
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,208
AT AKANE RESORT.

417
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:42,083
- WOW!
- Both: TICKETS FOR TWO?

418
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,583
- THE AKANE RESORT?

419
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,625
SOUNDS LIKE A PERFECT
GIFT FOR MY SISTER.

420
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,458
- THREE-DAYS AND TWO-NIGHTS
WITH GRAY?

421
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,083
IT'S TOO MUCH TO TAKE.

422
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,166
MY THOUGHTS ARE SO
HOT I MIGHT EVAPORATE.

423
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,083
- SHORT PERFORMANCE.

424
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,958
WHERE THERE'S FOUR IN THE RING,
AND THREE FEEL THE STING.

425
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:01,125
TRY NOT TO CRY WHEN I TAKE
HOME THE PRIZE. YOU DIG IT?

426
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,708
- All: YOU'RE NOT COMPETING.

427
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,916
- OFF THE STAGE! LAST I CHECKED,
YOU WEREN'T EVEN NEAR BINGO!

428
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,208
- YOU OKAY?

429
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,583
- HMM.

430
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,916
- ( sneezes )

431
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:20,708
THERE WERE SO MANY TIMES
I NEARLY LOST ALL HOPE.

432
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,041
SO MANY DESPERATE SITUATIONS.

433
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:26,625
AND COUNTLESS ENEMIES
WITH UNBELIEVABLE STRENGTH.

434
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,750
BUT NO MATTER WHAT KIND
OF OBSTACLE WE FACED,

435
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:33,083
I KNEW THE GUILD WOULD
ALWAYS BE THERE FOR ME.

436
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:36,291
WE LAUGHED TOGETHER.
SHARED OUR TEARS.

437
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,916
AND SO MUCH MORE.

438
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,333
THROUGH IT ALL, WE'VE SHARED
IN EACH OTHER'S PAIN.

439
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,250
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT FAMILY DOES.

440
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,750
EVERYONE HAS THEIR
OWN PROBLEMS,

441
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,333
BUT THEY NEVER HAVE
TO FACE THEM ALONE.

442
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,166
NO MATTER WHAT,
THROUGH THE GOOD TIMES,

443
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,333
AND THE BAD, WE GROW TOGETHER.

444
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,458
THAT'S WHAT FAIRY TAIL
IS ALL ABOUT.

445
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:42,416
ALL IN ALL, I'VE JOINED A PRETTY
INCREDIBLE GUILD, HAVEN'T I?

446
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,083
( sneezes )

447
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,375
TIME TO CRASH.

448
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,708
- ( people chattering )

449
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,708
- WHAT TIME IS IT?

450
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,291
AND WHY IS IT SO LOUD OUTSIDE?

451
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,291
- ( crowd gasping )

452
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,250
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL. INCREDIBLE.

453
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,708
- ( gasps )

454
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,666
IS THIS A DREAM?

455
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,791
BEAUTIFUL.

456
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,333
- Natsu: SO, YOU'RE
ALREADY OVER YOUR COLD?

457
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,250
- YEP! I'M AS GOOD AS NEW.

458
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,041
- WE'RE GLAD TO
HAVE YOU BACK, LUCY.

459
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,125
- ALL RIGHT, WHICH ONE
OF YOU NUMBSKULLS

460
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,750
UPROOTED THE CITY'S
PRIZED CHERRY TREE?

461
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,541
THE MAYOR'S BEEN BREATHING
