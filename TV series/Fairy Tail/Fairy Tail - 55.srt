1
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,166
- Natsu: PREVIOUSLY
ON "FAIRY TAIL..."

2
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,708
- Gray: WE FOUGHT HARD AGAINST
THE ORACION SEIS,

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,875
BUT THEY WERE ABLE
TO KIDNAP HAPPY AND WENDY.

4
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,333
- Carla: UNFORTUNATELY ERZA
WAS POISONED IN THE BATTLE 

5
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:28,291
AND WENDY'S
SKY DRAGON SLAYER MAGIC

6
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:29,666
IS THE ONLY THING 
THAT CAN HELP HER.

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,125
- Natsu:
SO WE SPLIT UP INTO GROUPS

8
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:32,541
TO FIND OUT WHERE
THOSE JERKS TOOK THEM,

9
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:33,958
BUT WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

10
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,291
HANG ON, GUYS.
WE'RE COMING TO GET YOU.

11
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:42,833
- ( theme music playing )

12
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:45,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

13
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,375
- ( gasps )

14
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:17,291
- ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO JELLAL,

15
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:21,583
A BRILLIANT WIZARD WHO ONCE
INFILTRATED THE MAGIC COUNCIL.

16
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:25,208
- ( laughing )

17
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,708
- HEY, BRO',
I GOT A GREAT IDEA.

18
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:30,125
LET'S SHOW THESE GUYS
JUST HOW TERRIFYING

19
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,958
NAKED MUMMY CAN BE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

20
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,208
- THAT'S SOUNDS FUN.
GOOD IDEA,

21
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,291
BUT I'M AFRAID THEY WON'T
EVEN KNOW WHAT HIT 'EM

22
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,291
'CAUSE IT'D
BE OVER SO QUICKLY.

23
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,041
- YEAH, IT WILL,
BUT I'M THINKING

24
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,000
WE SHOULD SHOW
THESE DUDES FIRST HAND

25
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,083
JUST HOW SCARY
NAKED MUMMY CAN BE.

26
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,916
SOUND GOOD TO YOU, BRO?
- ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU JUST SAID?

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,583
AND I AGREE WITH YOU.

28
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,875
- SO YOU'RE THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING...

29
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,416
ABOUT SHOWING THESE HERE BOYS
JUST HOW HORRIFYING--

30
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,416
- LET'S TEACH
THESE GUYS A LESSON!

31
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,750
- ( monkeys screech )

32
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,458
- THESE CLOWNS REALLY NEED
TO DO A LOT OF WORK

33
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,958
ON THE LAME COMEDY ROUTINE.

34
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,208
- YEAH, AND THE WHOLE
"BRO' ACT"

35
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,583
IS KIND OF STRETCH
IF YOU ASK ME.

36
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,041
- ( screaming )
( groaning )

37
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,833
( groaning )

38
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,375
- ( screams )

39
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,375
- ( groans )

40
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:22,666
- GET ICED!
- ( groans )

41
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,916
- ALL RIGHT, FAIRIES.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,708
GET YOURSELVES A TASTE
OF MY MAGIC SHOTGUN!

43
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:32,250
YOU LIKE THAT?
( gasps )

44
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:35,833
- ( sizzles ) 
- ( chuckles )

45
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,541
- THAT REALLY SHOULD
HAVE WORKED BETTER! 

46
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,541
( screams )

47
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,125
OWWIE.

48
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,083
- THEY'RE A WHOLE LOT TOUGHER
THAN THEY LOOK.

49
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,958
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD DO?

50
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,666
- I THOUGHT WE ALREADY
TALKED ABOUT THIS.

51
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,791
OR DIDN'T WE, BRO'?

52
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,000
- BUT THEY'RE A LOT TOUGHER 
THAN THEY LOOK, AREN'T THEY?

53
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,166
- JELLAL.

54
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,125
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

55
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,708
- THAT GUY IS BAD NEWS.

56
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,708
WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?

57
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,833
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
DO YOU KNOW HIM TOO?

58
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,083
- WELL, IT'S NOT
LIKE WE'RE FRIENDS.

59
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,166
HE TRIED TO KILL ME,
AND ERZA,

60
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,666
AND A BUNCH
OF OTHER PEOPLE.

61
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,250
HE'S THE ONE WHO GOT
THE MAGIC COUNCIL

62
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,166
TO FIRE THE ETHERION CANNON.

63
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,583
- I KNOW.

64
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,041
I HEARD ABOUT THAT.

65
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,625
- BUT I THOUGHT JELLAL
WAS ANCIENT HISTORY.

66
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:32,333
- HE IS INDEED A SHELL HAUNTED
BY A RESTLESS GHOST,

67
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,416
FULL OF MISERABLE IDEALS.

68
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:39,458
BUT ALSO A MAN WHO'S GIVEN YOU
THE GREATEST GIFT.

69
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,458
- WHAT? HE DID?

70
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,583
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

71
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,041
- THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY
TO RETURN THE FAVOR

72
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,250
AND REVIVE HIM.

73
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,375
- DON'T DO IT.

74
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,750
NO MATTER WHAT THIS GUY SAYS,

75
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:50,833
DON'T WAKE HIM UP.

76
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,291
PLEASE, DON'T DO IT.

77
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:02,583
YOU CAN'T!
- ( dagger unsheathes )

78
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,291
- SO ARE YOU REFUSING?

79
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,583
- NO, PLEASE, STOP!
( gasps )

80
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:07,916
- ( metal clinks )

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,041
- PLEASE, I BEG YOU.

82
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,625
( whimpers )

83
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,250
- REVIVE HIM.

84
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,625
YOU HAVE THE POWER
TO DO SO.

85
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,833
- NO, THAT'S THE LAST THING
YOU WANT TO DO.

86
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,625
THEY'RE PLANNING TO USE HIM
TO STEAL NIRVANA.

87
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,916
- BUT I HAVE TO REPAY HIM.

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,708
I WOULDN'T BE HERE
IF IT WEREN'T FOR HIM.

89
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,541
( cries )

90
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,041
HE WAS SO KIND TO ME.

91
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,541
I'VE HEARD ALL OF THOSE
HORRIBLE STORIES

92
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,250
ABOUT WHAT HE DID.

93
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,000
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THEM.

94
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,583
- I SWEAR THEY'RE TRUE.
I WAS THERE.  I SAW IT!

95
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,875
- HE'S NOT THE KIND OF PERSON
WHO COULD DO THAT!

96
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:08,541
- BUT HE DID, WENDY.

97
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,208
- PLEASE, JUST--

98
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,750
JUST GIVE ME A LITTLE TIME
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

99
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,250
- WHY? TELL HIM NO.

100
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,333
- VERY WELL.

101
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:23,000
YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES.

102
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,625
- NATSU, I HOPE
YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY.

103
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,166
WE REALLY NEED
YOU RIGHT NOW.

104
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,625
- ( gasps )

105
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,083
- ( gasps )

106
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,750
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

107
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,708
THE TERRIFYING
NAKED MUMMY GUILD

108
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,125
WAS DEFEATED
BY TWO PUNY WIZARDS.

109
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,000
- IT'S UNREAL.

110
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,375
NAKED MUMMY WAS TAKEN DOWN

111
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,000
BY THOSE TWO LITTLE GUYS.

112
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,791
- YEAH, I JUST
GOT DONE SAYING THAT

113
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,291
I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT HAPPENED.

114
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,458
- OH, MAN, THAT WAS A WORKOUT.

115
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,041
I THOUGHT IT'D
BE A LOT EASIER.

116
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,166
- THEY PUT UP ONE
HECK OF A FIGHT FOR SURE.

117
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,208
- WHAT KIND OF IDIOT THINKS
TAKING ON AN ENTIRE GUILD

118
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,625
WOULD BE A WALK IN THE PARK?

119
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,583
YOU WERE OUTNUMBERED
20 TO ONE AT LEAST.

120
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,916
- ALL RIGHT, YOU BIG DUMMY.

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
TELL ME WHERE
YOU GUY'S HIDEOUT IS?

122
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:11,416
- I AIN'T TELLING YOU SQUAT.
( laughs )

123
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,708
- ( growls )

124
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:15,916
HOW ABOUT YOU?!

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,333
- THESE BOYS ARE SO RECKLESS.

126
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,208
- OKAY, THEY'RE
ALL YOURS, BUDDY,

127
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,750
HAVE AT 'EM.
- HUH?

128
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,208
- WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

129
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,375
- WELL, WELL, I SEE YOU
PESKY LITTLE FLIES

130
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,166
ARE STILL BUZZING AROUND.

131
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,208
THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN SENT
TO COME SWAT YOU DOWN

132
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:34,291
ONCE AND FOR ALL,
YOU INSECTS.

133
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,625
- NO.
- NOT THIS GUY AGAIN.

134
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,875
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON,
COOL BREEZE?

135
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,375
LONG TIME NO SEE.
HOW YOU BEEN, MAN?

136
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,166
- WHAT?!
WE'RE ENEMIES, YOU FOOL!

137
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,541
- ARE YOU THAT DENSE?

138
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,125
HE WAS BEHIND THE PLOT

139
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,333
TO TAKE OUT GRAMPS AND THE REST
OF THE GUILD MASTERS

140
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,000
WITH THE LULLABY FLUTE,
REMEMBER?!

141
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,916
- OH YEAH! HE'S THE WINDBAG

142
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,458
I ROASTED ON
THAT BRIDGE, RIGHT?

143
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,208
TALK ABOUT A JERK.

144
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,750
- AFTER THE FALL OF 
THE EISENWALD GUILD,

145
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,208
I USED MY EXPERTISE
AS AN ENFORCER

146
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,208
IN THE SERVICE OF
THE ORACION SEIS,

147
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,708
BIDING MY TIME UNTIL NOW,

148
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,291
THE DAY THAT I WOULD
FINALLY HAVE MY REVENGE,

149
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:11,250
THE DAY ERIGOR THE REAPER
WOULD RISE AGAIN!

150
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,958
- SO YOU'VE COME HERE 
LOOKING FOR A REMATCH.

151
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,375
IS THAT IT?
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN TO ME.

152
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,708
- WHAT? THOSE TWO KNUCKLEHEADS
ARE GOING TO FIGHT AGAIN?!

153
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:22,208
RECKLESS DOESN'T EVEN BEGIN
TO DESCRIBE THEM.

154
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,208
- ( screaming )

155
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,500
- AIR MAGIC: AERIAL.

156
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,375
- ( shouting )
- Unicorn #1: I CAN'T BREATHE!

157
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,208
- Unicorn #2: I CAN'T SEE!
- Unicorn #3: I CAN'T HEAR!

158
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:33,416
- INSIDE THAT DOME,
THE AIR HAS LESS OXYGEN,

00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,958
- YOU WOULDN'T THINK SO.

218
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,333
NATSU MAY HAVE
HAD A TOUGH TIME

219
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,291
BEATING THIS CREEP
IN THEIR LAST FIGHT,

220
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,916
BUT HE'S A LOT STRONGER NOW

221
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,875

TO CHAT WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

227
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,791
I'VE GOT TO KICK
YOUR BUTT REAL QUICK

228
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,666
SO I CAN GO AND
RESCUE MY FRIENDS.

229
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,708
- BUT YOU STILL
HAVE A BIG MOUTH.

230
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,125
THIS'LL SHUT YOU UP!

231
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,375
EMERA BARAM!

232
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:51,833
( laughing )

233
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,791
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT,
YOU PEST?

234
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,625
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S IMPROVED.

235
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,333
EVER SINCE OUR LAST BATTLE,
I'VE BEEN TRAINING NON-STOP

236
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,166
TO INCREASE MY
DESTRUCTIVE POWERS,

237
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,791
BUILDING MY STRENGTH
TO TAKE YOU DOWN FOR GOOD.

238
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,208
- THAT'S JUST PITIFUL.

239
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,791
IF ALL YOU'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT

240
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,791
IS REVENGE THIS WHOLE TIME,
YOU HAVEN'T GROWN ONE BIT. 

241
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,458
- WHAT?!

242
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,500
- Natsu: I GUESS
I SHOULD BE FLATTERED.

243
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,458
I DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS
THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU.

244
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:18,666
- HMM.

245
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,875
- ( chuckles )
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND A THING.

246
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,208
THIS ISN'T ABOUT WHAT
YOU DID TO EISENWALD 

247
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,625
OR ON BEHALF OF
THE ORACION SEIS.

248
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,208
IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU AT ALL.
IT'S ABOUT ME.

249
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:34,166
I WON'T BE BEATEN!
- WE'LL JUST SEE ABOUT THAT.

250
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,000
YOU AND ME!
LET'S GO!

251
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,041
I'LL BLOW YOU AWAY!

252
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,750

255
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,541
- ( weakly )
NO, NOT AGAIN.

256
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:07,875
- WHY'D YOU HAVE TO DRAG
THAT ONE OUT SO LONG, YOU PYRO?

257
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,041
-  MY, QUITE IMPRESSIVE.

258
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:14,083
I DIDN'T KNOW THE SALAMANDER
WAS THIS POWERFUL.

259
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,125
- ALL RIGHT, YOU BIG BLOWHARD!
YOU BETTER WAKE UP

260
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,916
AND START TELLING ME
WHERE YOUR CREEPY FRIENDS

261
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,958
TOOK HAPPY AND WENDY!
- OH GEEZ.

262
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,500
- ( thudding )

263
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,041
- WHERE'S
THE ORACION SEIS HIDING?

264
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,791
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

265
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,708
AN "ANCIENT VILLAGE
IN THE WEST?"

266
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,416
- YOU GOT TO LOVE THE IRONY.

267
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,041
THESE HOODED FLUNKIES
THE GUILD SENT TO KEEP US AWAY

268
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,291
ENDED UP TELLING US
EXACTLY WHERE TO FIND THEM.

269
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:38,083
- I WANT THE TWO OF YOU
TO START HEADING WEST.

270
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,833
- AND YOU?

271
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,166
- AN ENORMOUS MAGICAL FORCE
IS APPROACHING.

272
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,166
- IS IT ONE OF
THE ORACION SEIS?

273
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,416
- MOST LIKELY.

274
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,708
I SHALL REMAIN HERE
AND ENGAGE THEM.

275
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,041
- I HAVE DECIDED
TO SHOW YOU MERCY.

276
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,875
COUNT YOURSELVES LUCKY
TO BE LEAVING

277
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,791
WITH YOUR LIVES
AND LIMBS INTACT.

278
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,416
YOU GUYS COULD RETURN
THE FAVOR, YOU KNOW.

279
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,291
- PUT A SOCK IN IT,
YOU GEEZER.

280
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,500
- I WILL HAVE YOU KNOW
I AM UNDER 30.

281
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:05,750
- HE SAID "SHUT UP."

282
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,750
- WELL, THEN, LET'S GO.

283
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,458
MAN ON MAN...

284
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,541
A WINNER-TAKE-ALL BRAWL
AND I WON'T HOLD BACK THIS TIME.

285
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:15,166
OR ARE YOU TOO SCARED OF ME?

286
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,708
- ( sighs )

287
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,833
- I UNDERESTIMATED YOU MEN
AND HELD BACK IN BATTLE.

288
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,625
IT'S QUITE COMPLICATED REALLY.

289
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,208
I CAN ONLY FIGHT
TO MY FULLEST ABILITY

290
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,916
WHEN THERE ARE
BEAUTIFUL LADIES WATCHING.

291
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,625
IT'S LIKE THEY SAY,
"A CLEVER FALCON

292
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,250
IS ONE WHO HIDES HIS TALONS."
- Men: SHUT UP, YOU PIG!

293
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,625
- DO WE REALLY HAVE TO CARRY
THIS GUY ALL THE WAY BACK?

294
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,708
LET'S PUT HIM
OUT OF HIS MISERY.

295
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,208
- WHOEVER YOUR LEADER MAY BE,
I'M SURE

296
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,083
THEY WOULD PREFER
ME IN ONE PIECE. 

297
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,500
- LADY ANGEL
SAID SHE FORGOT

298
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,083
TO GET SOME
INFORMATION OUT OF HIM.

299
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:42,458
- YEAH, WITH THAT FREAKY
COPYING MAGIC SHE USES.

300
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:45,166
- YUP, SO WE'RE STUCK
WITH HIM FOR NOW.

301
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,333
- MAN!

302
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,416
- IS THIS IT?

303
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,166
HAPPY! WENDY!
- HEY, QUIET!

304
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,125
OUR ENEMY MIGHT BE
HIDING DOWN THERE.

305
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:58,166
- Natsu:
HAPPY! WENDY!

306
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,416
- NATSU!

307
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,916
- RACER, INTERCEPT THEM.

308
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,875
- GLADLY, BOSS.

309
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,708
- MISERABLE FOOLS.

310
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,416
- WHAT'S THIS GUY
DOING HERE?

311
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,750
- Brain: TIME IS UP.

312
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:22,208
- ( cries )

313
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,708
- PLEASE DON'T DO IT, WENDY.

314
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:32,333
- LOOK, YOUR MAGIC 
CAN BRING HIM BACK.

315
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:36,250
SO WILL YOU HELP YOUR FRIEND
OR LEAVE HIM LIKE THIS?

316
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,250
YOU MUST!

317
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,791
- JELLAL.

318
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,083
- I CAN HANDLE THIS DUDE.

319
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,958
YOU NEED TO GET DOWN THERE
AND HELP THEM.

320
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,750
- GOTCHA.
- HA!

321
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,375
YOU'LL STAY RIGHT HERE.

322
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:07,458
- BUST OUT YOUR WINGS.
COME ON.

323
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,916
- HERE YOU GO.
YOU CAN USE THIS INSTEAD.

324
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,166
- LET'S GO! HA HA!
- ( screams )

325
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,750
- Racer:
YOU GOT SOME NERVE.

326
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,708
NO ONE PUTS THE BRAKES ON ME. 

327
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,958
- LOOKS LIKE YOU HAD A LITTLE
PROBLEM WITH TRACTION.

328
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,208
- ( moaning )
- ARE YOU SICK?

329
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:34,125
- Natsu: HAPPY!
- Carla: WENDY!

330
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,375
- ARE YOU HERE?!
- ANSWER ME, CHILD!

331
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:41,291
- Happy: NATSU!
- THAT'S HIM.

332
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,375
- Happy: NATSU!

333
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,500
- THERE, THAT CAVE.

334
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,625
- I CAN DO
A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN JUST

335
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,375
PUT THE BRAKES ON YOU, PAL.

336
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,875
YOU READY?

337
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,958
- NO.
- WHAT?

338
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,208
- BUT HOW?

339
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,750
- NATSU.

340
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,416
- ( smirks )

341
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,583
- ( cries )

342
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,208
I'M SO SORRY.

343
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,958
FORGIVE ME.

344
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,125
( crying )

345
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,916
- Natsu: JELLAL.

346
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,750
- POOR THING.

347
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,416
SHE'S GETTING WORSE.
THE POISON

348
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,000
IS STARTING TO
SPREAD LIKE CRAZY.

349
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,291
HAS ANYBODY BEEN ABLE
TO TRACK DOWN WENDY YET?

350
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,166
- I HAVE NO CLUE.

351
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,958
I CAN'T GET THROUGH TO ANYBODY.
- WHY? WHAT'S THE MATTER?

352
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,958
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

353
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,625
BUT I PROMISE YOU,
WE'RE GONNA SAVE ERZA.

354
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,625
- I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

355
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,750
PLEASE, JUST HOLD ON.

356
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,458
- Wendy: I'M SORRY.

357
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:01,083
( cries )

358
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,541
SORRY, SORRY.

359
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,000
BUT I--

360
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,208
I HAD TO.

361
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,375
I OWE HIM.

362
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:14,916
( cries )

363
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,666
- WENDY, YOU USED YOUR
HEALING MAGIC ON HIM? 

364
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,250
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT DOES TO YOU.

365
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,791
WENDY!

366
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:28,250
- I DON'T KNOW WHY YOUR HERE
OR WHERE YOU CAME FROM...

367
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,291
( growls )

368
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,416
BUT YOU DON'T BELONG HERE!

369
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,458
( screams )

370
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,333
- NATSU, NO.

371
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,500
- THANKFULLY YOUR CONDITION

372
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,458
HASN'T DIMINISHED YOUR POWER.

373
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,916
- NATSU!

374
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,041
COME ON,
YOU GOT TO GET UP!

375
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,625
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S ROCK.

376
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:11,916
BRING IT ON!

377
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,833
- HE JUST LEFT.
- THAT COWARD.

378
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,375
- I'M AWARE THAT THE TWO OF YOU
HAVE SOME KIND OF HISTORY,

379
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,375
BUT OUR FIRST PRIORITY
NEEDS TO BE

380
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,333
TAKING WENDY BACK TO THE OTHERS
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

381
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,500
- ( growls )
- YOU DO WANT TO SAVE

382
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:24,458
YOUR FRIEND, DON'T YOU?

383
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,833
- COME ON.

384
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,250
- MAN, I HATE THAT GUY!

385
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,541
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

386
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:36,375
LET'S GO, OKAY?
- AYE, SIR.

387
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,166
- THAT WAS UNEXPECTED.

388
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,500
BUT PERHAPS
I REMOVED HIS SHACKLES

389
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,291
A BIT PREMATURELY.

390
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:59,041
THAT'S SAID,
THIS AGGRESSIVE HOSTILITY

391
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,458
HE SEEMS TO HARBOR
TOWARD ME NOW

392
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,333
IS DEFINITELY
A RECENT DEVELOPMENT.

393
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:05,000
WAS HE AWARE ALL THIS TIME?

394
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,833
DID HE OVERHEAR US
DISCUSSING OUR PLANS

395
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,750
FOR NIRVANA WHILE HE SLEPT?

396
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,875
( gasps )
NO, IT CAN'T BE!

397
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,458
DOES HE INTEND HOARD NIRVANA'S
POWER ALL FOR HIMSELF?

398
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,208
HE MUSTN'T! IT SHOULD
BELONG TO ALL OF US.

399
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,166
I CANNOT ALLOW HIM 
TO STEAL OUR POWER.

400
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,125
COBRA, DO YOU HEAR ME?

401
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:24,125
JELLAL HAS ESCAPED
TO CLAIM NIRVANA. 

402
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:27,666
FIND HIM AND
STOP HIM AT ONCE.

403
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,208
- I HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR,
BOSS MAN.

404
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:33,000
AS LOUDLY AS I HEAR
THAT COWARDS FOOTSTEPS.

405
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,166
- THIS GUY'S CRAZY FAST.
IT'S NUTS.

406
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,000
- AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I'M THE FASTEST MAN ALIVE.

407
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:49,416
YOU'LL NEVER BEAT ME
'CAUSE YOU'LL NEVER CATCH ME.

408
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,125
THEY CALL ME RACER.

409
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,625
- NATSU FOUND 'EM.

410
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,750
- BUT HOW?  BRAIN WOULD NEVER
LET THEM SLIP AWAY LIKE THAT.

411
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,166
HOW DID THEY GET PAST HIM?!

412
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,541
- THEY PROBABLY JUST
BEAT HIM SENSELESS.

413
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,166
- WELL, END OF THE LINE.

414
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,166
- HEY, LOOK OUT!

415
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,958
- HAPPY! CARLA!

416
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,041
- ( moaning )

417
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,250
- I TOLD YOU IT'S
THE END OF THE LINE.

418
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,833
- ICE MAKE: RAMPART!

419
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,541
- GOT HIM?

420
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:36,041
- HURRY. 
( pants )

421
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:39,083
I SAID I CAN HANDLE
THIS GUY BY MYSELF.

422
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,208
( pants )

423
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,958
- I DON'T KNOW.

424
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,958
I CAN TELL YOU'VE BURNED THOUGH
A BUNCH OF YOUR POWER.

425
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,666
- JUST GO!
I GOT THIS!

426
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,291
- THANKS, MAN.

427
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,416
- I WON'T LET HIM PASS
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES.

428
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,291
GO!  ERZA'S LIFE
DEPENDS ON IT!

429
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:01,541
- OKAY, FINE,
BUT ONCE SHE'S HEALED,

430
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,791
WE'RE COMING 
BACK FOR YOU.

431
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,500
- YEAH, I KNOW YOU WILL.

432
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,208
- IMPRESSIVE.

433
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:11,500
THIS IS THE SECOND TIME
THAT YOU'VE STOPPED ME.

434
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:14,250
- AND IT'S CERTAINLY
NOT GONNA BE THE LAST.

435
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,583
YOU KNOW ICE HAS THE POWER

436
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:18,500
TO SLOW EVERYTHING DOWN,
DON'T YOU?

437
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:21,333
WHEN I'M THROUGH, YOU'RE 
GONNA BE REALLY SLOW, PAL

438
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:24,458
'CAUSE I'M GONNA FREEZE YOU
DEAD IN YOUR TRACKS FOREVER.

439
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:36,291
- ERZA.

440
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:45,250
- (end theme playing )

441
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:51,000
- ( singing in Japanese )

442
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,041
- Natsu: I CAN'T BELIEVE
GRAY'S TRYING

443
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:17,166
TO HOG ALL THE FUN.  I BET
HE THINKS HE LOOKS COOL, HUH?

444
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,583
HE REALLY BURNS ME UP SOMETIMES.
- Happy: DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND

445
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,625
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
HE'S NOT TRYING TO LOOK COOL

446
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:23,791
HE'S PUTTING HIMSELF AT RISK
TO HELP US SAVE ERZA.

447
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:25,208
- BUT HE'S GONNA LOOK COOL
IF HE BEATS

448
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:26,583
THAT LONG-NOSED SPEEDBALL.

449
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,208
WE CAN'T LET HIM
TAKE ALL THE CREDIT.

450
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:29,250
- WE'VE GOT
SOMETHING WAY MORE

451
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:30,333
IMPORTANT TO DO, DUMMY.

452
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:33,250
- ( Happy and Natsu speaking )

453
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:36,166
I BET THEIR FIGHT'S OVER
BY THE TIME WE GET THERE ANYWAY.

454
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,125
- IN THAT CASE, I'LL JUST HAVE 
TO GO A ROUND WITH GRAY MYSELF.

455
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:41,250
- WHAT? THAT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL.
