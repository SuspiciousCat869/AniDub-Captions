00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:37,541
Been awhile... but I'm
still wicked... Oh yeah!

155
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,125
Can we make this quick...?

156
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,916
Me and Aquarius are having our
own little island adventure...

157
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,041
and I'd hate to leave her
hanging ten... ya feel me?

158
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,791
By all means, get back
as fast as you can.

159
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,125
I don't wanna give her
any more reasons

160
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,708
to start plotting my demise.

161
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,500
Just cause you're on a trip with
your girlfriend doesn't mean

162
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,916
you gotta rub it in
my face...! Gah!

163
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,166
[SCORPIO]
Sand Buster!

164
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,875
I could go for a grilled
scorpion but I'd rather not

165
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,916
have all this sand!

166
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,166
Aw man...! That is wicked nasty!

167
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,583
So, uuuh... what now?

168
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,000
[KAIN]
Dodoskoi!

169
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,250
Hey Lucy... since my
sand ain't worth squat,

170
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,000
I'll be getting' back
to my bahama mama...

171
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,000
That cool? Wicked...!

172
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:21,541
So not cool! This blows.
I'm running out of spirits!

173
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,083
[KAIN] Mr. Cursy still has
my bristle on his head...

174
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,250
So what do you think
would happen if, say...

175
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,375
I could change what
his body is made of?

176
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,500
He's made cursing
himself an advantage?!

177
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:35,708
[KAIN] Change, Mr. Cursy...! I'm
gettin tired of being iron...

178
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:39,666
Let's go with light!
Shining Dodoskoi!

179
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,208
You can't defeat me, lady...
I may not look very tough,

180
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,458
but I'm still one
of the Seven Kin!

181
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:55,291
Better summon something tastier
before I really get mad!

182
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:56,500
[LUCY]
Well, he's not much of a fighter

183
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,000
but I bet he'll make
for a good distraction.

184
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,041
Open, gate of the Little Dog!

185
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,375
Nicola!

186
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,458
Oh, It's so cute,
I could just die...!

187
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,750
I just wanna pick him up
and hold him and squeeze him

188
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,416
and cuddle him and...

189
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,541
Gimme the yummy widdle thingy!

190
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,208
Guess my plan backfired!

191
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,875
Help me out here, Cancer!

192
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,750
Long time, no see... baby.

193
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,541
Holy crab legs!

194
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,791
What's the deal, you don't write
or call and your hair needs

195
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,458
a trim in the worst way...

196
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,291
Now, how's about we start
with some deep conditioning?

197
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:38,083
I see you're just as clueless as
ever... Go over and fight tubby.

198
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,958
[CANCER] Sorry baby but
I've got a fear of pots

199
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,333
and boiling water.

200
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,500
Well, get it over it 'cause
I need you to give him

201
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,166
a haircut so bad,
he'll run away in shame.

202
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,708
You got it, baby! Chop! Slice!

203
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,333
Like your haircut, baby?!

204
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,375
What...?! No way!

205
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,041
How did you wear down
my babies... baby?

206
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:02,333
My bristles haven't seen shampoo
since the stone age, pal.

207
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,500
[CANCER] That ain't
something to be proud of...

208
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,750
[CANCER]
Catcha ya later, baby!

209
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,875
'Kay... Only one shot left...
Get 'em, Aries!

210
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,291
 I'll do my best...

211
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,875
You better have food for me...!

212
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,250
[ARIES] Sorry... I wish
I could satisfy you.

213
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,416
Wait a minute, why are you
apologizing to me?

214
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,375
[ARIES] Well, because...
You're starving...

215
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,500
and I can't do
anything to help you.

216
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,833
Sorry!

217
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,291
Please, don't go!

218
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,916
[IMAGINARY KAIN] My Darling...
I hate to see you cry...

219
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,958
Don't you know how
much I love you?

220
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:35,750
[ARIES]
You do?

221
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,750
Yes...! With all my heart!

222
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,916
[ARIES] Will you hold me
in your massive arms?

223
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,083
Are you kidding me...?!
Of course I will, dear!

224
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,916
[ARIES]
Kain, my love!

225
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,458
That's my, girl! Run into
my arms, sweetheart!

226
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:51,125
Aries... Thanks for filling my
life with wonderfully wooly joy.

227
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:54,625
I know we just met today...
but I love you!

228
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:55,583
Lay it on him.

229
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,125
Go! Wool Bomb!

230
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,833
I hope that I've properly
served you, Miss Lucy.

231
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,708
Yeah, you did great...!
I never knew you were such

232
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,000
a good actress; where'd
you learn how to do that?

233
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,541
Oh, Leo taught me!

234
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,083
Turn on the waterworks, and
men'll be putty in your hands.

235
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,833
Then you hit 'em with
a surprise attack!

236
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,458
Trust me, this trick'll
make you an asset to Lucy.

237
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,875
Yeah... remind me
to talk to him.

238
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,166
[KAIN] Why, Aries...?!
I know I can be clingy,

239
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,458
but why did you have
to break my heart?!

240
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:21,958
Dadastan!

241
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,750
I think we made him angry.

242
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,125
[LUCY] There's no stopping
this guy, is there?!

243
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,500
[KAIN]
Dodoskoi!

244
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:28,750
[ARIES]
I'm so sorry!

245
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,208
Fine, then... I'll have
to satisfy my hunger...

246
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:34,166
with a full-course dinner
of pain and suffering.

247
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,583
Mr. Cursy, change into cotton!

248
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:45,208
Last stop on the Kain Pain
Train! Self-reinforcement! Iron!

249
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,291
[HAPPY]
Natsu? Are you all right?

250
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,583
[NATSU] I'm fine.
Quit freakin' out, 'lil buddy...

251
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:54,791
Her hits ain't even hurtin' me.

252
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,000
[ULTEAR]
You're kidding yourself

253
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,750
if you think I'm going
all out right now...

254
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,458
I could have destroyed you,
but I owe you for Galuna Island

255
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,500
and I always make
good on my debts.

256
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,750
Whatever...

257
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,083
You're not any stronger
than you were last time.

258
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,583
Keep talking, little man...

259
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,416
It'll be that much sweeter
when I shut you up for good.

260
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,291
Look out below!

261
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:19,500
What the-?!

262
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,541
Natsu!

263
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,750
What the heck are
you doin' here?!

264
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,583
I don't need any help
taking her down!

265
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:26,916
I'm not offering...

266
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,625
But thanks for getting the
marshmallow off my back.

267
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,083
I can't believe you didn't see
her get a face-full of dirt...!

268
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,666
It was priceless!

269
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,541
You're gettin' a face-full of
my fist if you don't shut up!

270
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,500
Kain... care to tell me
what you're doing here?

271
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,166
Oh, yeah, sorry...

272
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,708
I was fightin' that girl and
I almost finished her off.

273
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,875
Looks like she's been
giving you a hard time, too.

274
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,750
I saw her first... Hands off.

275
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,375
You have fun with that.

276
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,416
[HAPPY] Natsu hasn't
landed a single hit!

277
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,541
There's no way he can beat her.

278
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,750
[NATSU] I can, too...! I was
just biding my time, ya know?

279
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,125
[HAPPY]
In that case,

280
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,875
I guess you can handle
the two of 'em on your own.

281
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,583
Yeah, I could, but since Lucy's
here I'll throw her a bone.

282
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,333
Now don't get me wrong,
we're still rivals when it comes

283
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,541
to completing the S-Class trial.

284
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:10,000
But... I don't mind
calling a truce for now.

285
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:16,083
[LUCY] Boy, teamin' up with you
guys sure brings back memories.

286
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,625
[HAPPY] Kinda reminds me of our
first adventure in Hargeon.

287
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,708
[NATSU]
I'm all fired up now!

288
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,458
Are you ready, Lucy?

289
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,041
You know it, Natsu!

290
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,458
Don't forget about me!

291
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,083
[KAIN]
Quit actin' all buddy-buddy!

292
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:35,166
It's driving me crazyyyy!

293
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,916
[KAIN]
My belly's rumblin'.

294
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,375
[LUCY] We're really taking
on two of them at once

295
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,125
I'm all fired up now!

296
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,458
That does it...! I'll
take care of these bratty kids;

297
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:56,708
just leave 'em to me...!

298
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,416
First I'm gonna filet
those two, and then...

299
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,333
I'll barbeque
their little, blue dog!

300
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,166
Forget it, Buddha belly!
We're stickin' with two-on-two!

301
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,458
Uh... Actually, I wouldn't mind
taking 'em on one at a time.

302
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:09,166
I'm not a dog, but at least
someone acknowledged me.

303
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,833
Very well, I leave them
to you... Destroy them...

304
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,833
I will take Zeref
to Master Hades so we

305
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,375
can continue our plans.

306
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,041
That's great news; I didn't
realize you had found him yet!

307
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,166
Oh no...! We have
to stop her...!

308
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,333
If she gets away with him
we're all screwed...

309
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,125
They wanna bring about
some "Grand Magic World"

310
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,750
and kill all non-wizards!

311
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,625
That sorry sack of tears
still has to pay

312
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,083
for messin' with my scarf...

313
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,833
He's not going anywhere
until I get my revenge!

314
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,333
Let's get this party started!

315
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,166
[KAIN]
Dodoskoi!

316
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,833
No, Natsu!

317
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,208
[ULTEAR] Kill them quickly...
We've no time to waste.

318
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,583
Show them the full fury
of the Seven Kin...

319
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,041
Head back to the ship as soon as

320
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,083
you're done decorating the
forest with their entrails.

321
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,708
No way...! I have a stomach
to fill and the main course

322
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,208
just got served...

323
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,708
There won't be any
leftovers to decorate with.

324
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,750
[NATSU] Bring it on!
I've got the porker, Lucy!

325
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,208
'Kay, guess that means
I'm goin' after her!

326
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,416
[KAIN]
Ka-shing!

327
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:05,166
[NATSU] Hey, What are you doin'?
She's gonna get away!

328
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,750
[LUCY] Look, I'm tryin' to move
but I can't seem to budge!

329
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,333
[childish laughter]

330
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,916
I snagged one of your bristles
while I was chasing you earlier.

331
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,875
But... How did you...?!

332
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,875
[KAIN] Now that you and
Mr. Cursy are connected,

333
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,500
it's time for me to serve
up your just desserts.

334
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,291
What was the first thing
you did to me...? Oh yeah!

335
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,583
Show us those funky moves!

336
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:27,791
[LUCY]
No!

337
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,500
Do you have any idea
what's goin' on here?

338
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:32,000
Just looks like a couple
of friends bustin' a move.

339
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,958
Oh, we've passed the 'friends'
stage at this point, doggie.

340
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,541
[LUCY]
Keep dreamin', bristle butt!

341
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,041
Aw, don't be so shy...!

342
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:41,291
You love to dance... and pose
for me, don't you...? Yes.

343
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,208
[LUCY]
Cut... It... Out!

344
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,375
Looks like you're
enjoying it, if you ask me.

345
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,958
No, it's all in your head!

346
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,666
For some reason, whenever diaper
man does something to that doll,

347
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,208
it happens to Lucy, too!

348
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,416
Whoa... That's cool.

349
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,083
[NARRATOR] Death curse magic...
this Lost Magic excels

350
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:01,375
at inflicting lethal
jinxes onto its victims.

351
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,875
The Lullaby flute,

352
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,291
created by Zeref, is another
example of a cursed object.

353
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,875
Even though Mr. Cursy doesn't
appear to effect more than

354
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:11,750
one target at a time,
in the right hands,

355
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:15,291
this terrifying magic could
re-shape the fate of the world.

356
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,625
Did you hear that...?!
We're totally screwed!

357
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,041
That's... not cool!

358
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,708
Hippity hoppity widdle wabbit.

359
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,000
C'mon, knock it off!

360
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,375
Make her tickle herself silly!

361
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,125
Hey...! Do you wanna die?!

362
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,250
I think that's exactly
what he should do!

363
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,791
[LUCY]
Natsu! Outta the way!

364
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,333
[LUCY]
Are you copping a feel?!

365
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,625
[LUCY]
You deserved that one!

366
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,625
Wow, she's man handling
Natsu like Edolas Lucy...

367
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,750
And she wasn't
nearly that hard core!

368
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,291
What the heck
are you doing, Lucy?!

369
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,375
It's not me;
it's that creepy doll!

370
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,666
[NATSU]
That hurt.

371
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,791
Okay, this isn't
as fun as it looked.

372
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,750
Would you just stay still?!

373
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,583
Geez...! When did
you get so strong...?!

374
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,541
Either you've been doing extra
push-ups or that doll thing

375
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,416
is giving you a major boost.

376
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,625
Don't you two have any decency?!
Quit being cuddly and kissy

377
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,125
in the middle of a battlefield!

378
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,041
[BOTH] We're not doing
either of those, you perv!

379
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,291
Whatever, they're
totally in love.

380
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,791
[KAIN]
Now you got me steamed! Fine...!

381
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,833
You wanna get all handsy in
front of me...?! Take this!

382
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,500
I'll make you hug
your boyfriend so hard

383
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,291
his spine turns to jelly...!

384
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,375
There you go! Put the squeeze
on your main squeeze...!

385
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:23,875
Stretch him like
he's made of taffy!

386
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,458
This is just a taste
of the power of

387
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,166
Witching Hour Curse magic...

388
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,750
Your future is looking
very dark indeed.

389
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,166
Mr. Cursy...!

390
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,666
Why does everything I love
always run away from me?!

391
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,208
I managed to snag
the doll away,

392
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,916
what do you guys
want me to do with it?!

393
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,708
That stupid, blue dog can fly?!

394
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,041
Nice goin', Happy!

395
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,208
Awesome!

396
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,416
[LUCY]
You're so dead!

397
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,333
[KAIN]
That's my doll!

398
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,625
[NATSU]
It's mine now, bub!

399
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:59,666
Fire Dragon... Talon!

400
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,875
What gives...?!
How is he so fast?!

401
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,125
These Grimoire Heart
creeps are super strong...!

402
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,875
I never would've thought diaper
man could overpower Natsu!

403
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,625
Did you honestly think a wimpy
official guild could go toe

404
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:15,791
to toe with the
likes of us?! Dodoskoi!

405
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,875
Natsu!

406
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,333
[NATSU]
I'm stuck!

407
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,250
It's no good... I can't get out!

408
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:34,291
[LUCY] I'll summon Virgo
to help set you free!

409
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,583
No...

410
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:42,041
Not now... This is not the
time... to run outta power!

411
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,500
Lucy! Behind you!

412
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,000
Run away!

413
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:50,708
Leave her alone...! Come... on!

414
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,083
[KAIN]
Relax, little guy,

415
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,166
you've got a front row seat
to tonight's execution.

416
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,958
[NATSU]
You bastard!

417
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,750
Let her go! Take that, and that,
and that, and that, and that,

418
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,125
You'll join her on
the grill soon enough.

419
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,583
I gave it a shot...
but he's too strong...

420
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,208
Happy...

421
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,583
Get outta here, Lucy...!

422
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,750
You've gotta chase down that
broad or we'll lose her!

423
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,791
Don't worry about me, just keep
running and don't look back!

424
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,416
No way!

425
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:31,791
[LUCY] I refuse to run away...
I won't do it...

426
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,791
I'd rather stay here with you...

427
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,625
I can't think of anything
that would make me happier.

428
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:43,125
[KAIN] I guess that's one way
of saying goodbye...

429
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,625
I can't wait to pop that cute,
little head of yours off.

430
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,208
[NATSU]
You let go of her!

431
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,791
Careful... You'll break
my concentration...

432
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,833
I might not squeeze
enough the first time.

433
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,375
Whoa...! My body's
moving all by itself!

434
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:12,583
Dodge him, Lucy!

435
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,458
[LUCY]
Too far! That's way too far!

436
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,666
Available for
the first time ever,

437
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,708
it's the fully-poseable
Lucy action figure!

438
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,125
[LUCY] Did you forget
that I have joints?

439
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,416
Or are you trying to be
cruel and heartless?!

440
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,125
[NATSU] Quit complainin'!
You're beating him!

441
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,625
He's right...!
We might win after all!

442
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,791
Whoa... My pyro urges
are tingling like crazy!

443
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:36,041
[NATSU]
Fire Dragon... Iron Fist!

444
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,541
Chill out! This is gonna be
the greatest thing ever...

445
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:39,500
if you live!

446
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:40,916
Whaddya mean "if"?!

447
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,875
[NATSU]
Happy!

448
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,250
Aye!

449
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,750
Stop...! I don't wanna
play with you guys anymore!

450
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,041
It's time for Max Speed!

451
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:47,833
Aye, sir!

452
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,583
Okay... You guys suck!

453
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,125
[HAPPY]
Max Speed!

454
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,208
[KAIN] I gotta bad
feeling about this...

455
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:59,875
[LUCY] Screw you both! Next time
I get to set you guys on fire!

456
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:07,583
Special technique... Lucy fire!

457
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:13,916
[NARRATOR]
For those who didn't get that.

458
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,291
Using Mr. Cursy,

Natsu and Happy fused their
magic power with Lucy...

460
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:21,583
effectively turning her
into a comet of destruction,

461
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:24,125
and allowing her
to defeat Kain Hikaru.

462
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:29,583
Thanks... I've had enough...
I'm full now...

He's down for the count!

[HAPPY]
Aye, sir!

465
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:33,791
We did it!

466
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,541
Now it's time... for...

467
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:37,250
A victory pose! Aw, yeah!

468
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:40,041
Guys... Haven't I been
through enough today?!

[HAPPY] Sorry Natsu,
but I'm not gonna make it...

471
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,250
I can't move a muscle...

472
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,333
[NATSU] Pull yourself together,
Happy! You can't drop out of

473
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,166
a fight before you've
even done anything!

474
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,041
I mean, you can but
that'll make you a coward.

[HAPPY] Did you sharpen
that tongue before you

476
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,125
cut me with it?

477
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:27,041
I'm backin' off 'cause I've been
hoggin' the spotlight lately

478
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:28,625
and I wanna share it with you.

Can't share what you don't have.

[HAPPY] Fine then!
I'll keep it all to myself!

I tried to be nice

483
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:39,083
but you've forced me
to go all Catmander on ya!

484
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:41,916
[NATSU] Oh no! What're you gonna
do? Cough a hairball on me?
