He'll answer
for it soon enough.

165
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,875
So if we can defeat that
man in time the rest of them

166
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,416
will leave and the council
won't have to fire on us?

167
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,791
Yeah, that's the plan.

168
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,291
And if their ship's destroyed,
they can swim back!

169
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,458
[NATSU] Happy, I've
got a job for you.

170
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,875
I need you to find
whatever makes this thing fly

171
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,208
and take it outta commission.

172
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:23,041
I Guess it'd be a major
problem if it started moving.

173
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,833
At least, for you.

174
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,125
[CARLA]
We shall help him.

175
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,083
[PANTHERLILY]
You can count on us.

176
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,208
Can we go in now?

177
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,458
Good plan!

178
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,750
But I'll cast my Troia spell,
just in case.

179
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,541
I think we've kept him
waiting long enough.

180
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,041
Let's go!

181
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,958
Let's get in there
and break stuff!

182
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:44,958
[thunder]

183
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:45,666
Let's just
try to get in there

184
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,208
as quickly as possible!

185
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,208
[ERZA] Remember, his power
surpasses our own master's.

186
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,708
Once we're inside, hit
him hard and hit him fast.

187
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:53,791
Yeah Okay!

188
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,416
Don't worry;
I'm not stoppin' until

189
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,125
he's beggin' for mercy.

190
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:00,000
After everything he's
done he doesn't deserve mercy!

191
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:00,708
[NATSU]
Oh yeah!

192
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,333
We're puttin' him down!

193
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,125
Ready or not, Hades.

194
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,000
Here we come!

195
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,958
I've got a message
from Makarov.

196
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,500
Choke on it!

197
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,000
[HADES] You'll have
to do better than that.

198
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,250
Try again.

199
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,833
[ERZA]

203
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,416
By the grace of the
wind, may you strike fiercely,

204
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,916
move swiftly, and
be free of all harm!

Vernier.

207
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,666
Now go!

208
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,291
Nimble little scamp!

212
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:18,291
[NATSU]
On it!

213
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,208
[GRAY]
Get in there!

214
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:23,041
Sky Dragon.Roar!

[NATSU]
Fire Dragon Sword Horn!

218
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:59,375
[HADES] I've often heard young
people refer to their mistakes

219
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,541
as 'life experience'.

220
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,750
But true mistakes do not
yield experience as there is

221
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,416
no coming back from them.

222
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,166
Such is the case here.

223
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,000
Your future consists
only of the grave.

224
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:16,250
There will be no lesson to
learn other than opposing me

225
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,458
was the biggest
mistake of your lives.

226
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,708
Oh, no!

227
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,166
All of that and
he wasn't even scratched?

228
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,500
Come on!

229
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,708
We poured everything
we had into that!

230
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,875
His magic power is unreal.

231
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,541
How do we beat him?

232
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,083
Very well.

233
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,833
Now that I'm all warmed-up,
it's time to get serious.

234
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,375
Get ready 

235
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:59,458
[HADES]
Katsu!

236
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,958
Wendy, no!

237
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:26,041
[HADES]
Katsu!

238
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,625
Wendy, no!

239
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,541
[HADES] Believe me when I tell
you that was a mercy kill.

240
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,250
She got off easy.

241
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,458
From this point forward,
each of your deaths will be

242
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:43,583
more gruesome
than the one before.

243
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,250
[LUCY]
No, Wendy.

244
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,125
[GRAY]
What did you do to her?!

245
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,625
[NATSU]
This can't be happening!

246
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,041
[HOROLOGIUM]
"It's okay, everybody!

247
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,666
I'm fine!"

248
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,375
"I'm up here!"

249
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,541
She exclaims with relief.

250
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,125
It's Horologium!

251
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,958
Nice, old timer!

252
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,041
My automatic
danger detection mode

253
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,000
was activated just in time.

254
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,416
Really.

255
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,625
Don't take this
the wrong way, but I think

256
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,625
your danger detection
thingy needs an overhaul.

257
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,750
[HOROLOGIUM] My apologies,
but while you have had trouble

258
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,208
in the past, your life
was never at risk.

259
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,041
"Thanks so much, Horologium.

260
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:26,166
That was a close call."
She says graciously.

261
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,166
[GRAY] I guess timing
is kinda his thing?

262
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,166
[NATSU] So, uh why didn't
Wendy's clothes go with her?

263
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,416
[HOROLOGIUM]
As it was an emergency,

264
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,458
I only had time to
protect her physical body.

265
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:36,708
Just her body!

266
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:37,833
Hold up.

267
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,458
You're saying that
inside there, she's!

268
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,500
"Ahh!", she
screams in embarrassment.

269
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,250
I will provide
new clothing for her.

270
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,833
We're just
glad she's all right.

271
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,375
Thank you for your help.

272
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,500
Sadly, this is the
only time I'll be able

273
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,125
to offer my protection.

274
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,083
Please, take extra care,
everyone.

275
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,291
Good luck.

276
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,125
Don't worry.

277
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,583
We'll be okay!

278
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,583
So this is
Makarov's Fairy Tail?

279
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,000
Well, you're certainly
entertaining.

280
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,375
Hang on.

281
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,625
Are you sayin' you know Gramps?

282
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,458
[HADES] I'm surprised he
never told you about me.

283
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,708
Have the records of my
existence been expunged

284
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,458
from the guild's library?

285
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,291
I should've expected as much.

286
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,375
If Makarov is 'Gramps'.

287
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,208
I suppose that makes me
'Great Grandfather'.

288
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,333
I'm Fairy Tail's second master.

289
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,208
That's a filthy lie!

290
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,250
My name was
Precht back then.

291
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:37,625
It was I who appointed Makarov
as the guild's third master.

292
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,625
You expect
us to believe that?

293
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,375
Gramps would never have
anything to do with you!

294
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,333
Natsu!

295
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,583
Pow!

296
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,000
Pow!

297
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,250
Pow!

298
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,750
Now do you
understand your folly!

299
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,541
Please, stop!

300
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:31,083
[thunder]

301
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,583
So loud!

302
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,125
Who builds a ship with such
horrible sound insulation?!

303
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,083
It sounds like
it's inside my head!

304
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,000
Make it stop!

305
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,291
We get it already!

306
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,791
At least the
lightning can't hit us while

307
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,291
we're inside the ship.

308
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,083
Okay!

309
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,291
Let's check this way next.

310
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,666
Don't get left behind!

311
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,916
Keep moving!

312
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,291
[DORANBOLT]
There's no denying it.

313
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,750
At first I hoped I'd
just misunderstood him.

314
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,333
But I.

315
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,583
I know what I heard!

316
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,041
[LAHARL]
Acnologia?

317
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,166
You're sure that's
what Zeref said?

318
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,958
You must be certain!

319
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,333
Damn, I'm useless.

320
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:09,375
How could I let myself
just get paralyzed by fear?

321
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,000
Please, get a hold of yourself!

322
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,166
Are you absolutely sure
that he said "Acnologia"?!

323
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,041
Move!

324
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,750
Prepare to withdraw!

325
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,041
All forces, retreat at once!

00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:26,791
As of this moment, our survey
of Tenrou Island is negated!

327
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,708
[DORANBOLT]
No.

328
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,708
There's nothing I can do now.

329
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,458
It's all over.

330
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,166
Forgive me.

331
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:52,208
[HADES]
Tell me.

332
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,916
Do fairies possess tails?

333
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,791
It's an eternal mystery.

334
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,416
And thus an eternal adventure.

335
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,291
I believe that
was how the guild's name

336
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,500
originally came about?

337
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
However, your
adventure will end crushed

338
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,958
under the heel of my boot!

339
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:20,125
The first master,
Mavis, entrusted her will to me.

340
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:24,541
And I, in turn, passed my will
and mantle on to Makarov.

341
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,250
One of my
greatest mistakes.

342
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,791
Makarov changed the guild.

343
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,625
What nonsense
are you spoutin' off?

344
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,958
[HADES] He brought magic out of
the darkness and into the light.

345
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,791
That's how our
Fairy Tail does things;

346
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,583
you got a problem with it!

347
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,791
We aren't rotten,
heartless people like you

348
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,083
and your guild!

349
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,083
We live with
our lives on the line.

350
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,333
every moment!

351
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,916
So sit and stew in the
darkness all you want.

352
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,333
You don't have the courage
to change a thing!

353
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,083
Such disrespect.

354
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,541
You'll pay for that.

355
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:01,916
Natsu!

356
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,666
If you're angry,
it should be at Makarov.

357
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,791
No, stop!

358
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,291
After all, it's his
fault that you're about to

359
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,833
leave this world in utter agony.

360
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,541
Leave him alone!

361
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,916
[NATSU]
I won't let you.

362
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,500
Get away with hurtin' Gramps.

363
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,416
I-

364
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,166
Will die.

365
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,500
Horribly.

366
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,958
Don't kill him, please!

367
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,291
Lightning got in!

368
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,666
We're doomed!

369
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,000
[CARLA] Could you two
be any more pathetic!

370
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:12,666
[LAXUS] So this is the
fossil that took out Gramps.

371
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,250
Interesting.

372
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,083
Laxus!

373
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,625
The boy?

374
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:47,208
♪

375
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,458
[HAPPY] Okay, so we know
that fairies have wings

376
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:16,208
but do they have tails?

377
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:17,541
What do you think, Natsu?

378
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,125
[NATSU]
of course!

379
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,458
A fairy without a tail is like
a veggie stir-fry without meat!

380
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,125
[HAPPY] That doesn't
make any sense, dummy!

381
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:25,875
If it had meat in it, then it'd
be a completely different dish.

382
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,291
Try again.

383
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:29,000
[NATSU] it's like a veggie
stir-fry without veggies!

384
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:30,791
[HAPPY]
So it'd be an empty pot?

385
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:33,625
[HAPPY and NATSU] Next time:
The Man Without an Emblem!

386
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,041
[HAPPY] What do Fairies
and stir-fries have to

387
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:36,500
do with each other anyway?

388
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:38,041
We were talking about tails!

389
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:41,875
[NATSU] Let's get ours in gear
and find grub, I'm starvin'!
