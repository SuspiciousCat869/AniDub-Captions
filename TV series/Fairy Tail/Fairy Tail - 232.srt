I've been good.

It's Atlas Flame.

Oh, yeah, from the Eclipse Gate.

That's the dragon that
helped us fight Rogue!

Oh.

224
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,708
But the Eclipse Gate
was destroyed,

back to their time.

That's correct.

It sent us 400 years

And all that time
I've burned on.

Didn't know you were still
alive! You must be ancient!

But alive? No. Far from it.

the perspective to say.

Zirconis came from the same
era, but his memory was fine.

247
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,291
It might have
to do with the ice.

248
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,458
What about it?

249
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,000
[WENDY] A being does has to have
incredibly strong willpower

But the actual
magic power is weak.

Considering the strength
of the ice magic,

253
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,416
and the length of time
Atlas Flame was frozen,

254

00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,833
[ATLAS FLAME]
That monster's name is E.N.D.

324
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:09,291
And not even Igneel had
the strength to slay it.

325
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,375
[GIANT A] Huh?

326
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,416
What the--?

327
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,916
Why am I--?

328
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,416
That wave of heat.

329
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,000
It must've come
from the Eternal Flame.

330
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,041
Yeah.

331
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,000
The ice is gone? That can't be!

332
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,083
My friends're fast. Sorry.

333
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,250
[thud]

334
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,958
[GIANT G]
Mmm. Well, isn't this a sight.

335
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,416
A couple of humans have somehow
wandered into our village.

336
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,958
We'll settle this later.

337
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,166
[ERZA]
Minerva, wait!

338
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,416
Do try not to sound
so desperate.

339
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,666
I'll be back to finish you soon,

340
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,708
and on a finer stage
than this one.

341
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,666
You still have
time to stop this.

342
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,791
You're too strong to let
yourself be controlled

343
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,125
by the darkness.

344
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,708
No need to fret for me, Erza.

345
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:24,625
Darkness is coming, but I'll
be the one that controls it.

346
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:28,875
[ALL gasping]

347
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,375
The village. It thawed out!

348
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,833
Do the giants
seem bigger to you?

349
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,291
Yes.

350
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,208
Where's my uncle?

351
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,708
[cries]

352
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:58,875
[FLARE] Thank you
for sharing your warmth.

353
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,500
[BOTH grunting]

354
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,166
There's no trace left
of Atlas Flame.

355
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,666
He gave everything
to save the village.

356
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,125
To think that just a fragment of
his spirit could be so powerful.

357
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,833
He even created
a brand new Eternal Flame.

358
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:23,958
[crying]

359
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:27,208
So Igneel was tryin' to take
out a demon called E.N.D.?

360
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,041
Never heard of it.

361
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,166
I wonder what made
Atlas Flame think of that?

362
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,708
[HAPPY] 
Who knows?

363
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,375
[GRAY]
An Ice Demon Slayer

364
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:37,666
paused dozens of lives
with just one spell.

365
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,125
[MESSENGER]
Excuse me, sir.

366
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:52,750
[MESSENGER]
You've been ordered to return

367
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,416
to Headquarters
as soon as possible.

368
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,666
[MAN]
You go and tell headquarters

369
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,416
that I'm busy
paying my respects.

370
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,333
[MESSENGER]
My deepest apologies, sir.

371
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:02,708
But, each of the
Nine Demon Gates

372
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,875
have been summoned
to this meeting.

373
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:08,333
Forgive my insubordinace,
but, sir, I--

374
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:12,416
[MESSENGER] I'm begging you!
Obey the order, please!

375
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,958
[MAN] What's with
the trembling, friend?

376
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,541
Scared I'm gonna eat your soul?

377
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,666
[MESSENGER whimpers]

378
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:33,625
[chuckles]

379
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,125
You can put your fears to rest.

380
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,708
I only feast on
the souls of demons.

381
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:15,291
[LUCY]
Thanks to Atlas Flame's flame,

382
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:17,625
the Village of the Sun
is back to normal!

383
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:20,250
Well, maybe not normal,
but the giants can move now!

384
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,041
And they're
surprisingly friendly.

385
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,416
Having finished our quest,

386
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,416
we return to the Sequen
manor to collect our reward.

387
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,833
But with a guy like Warrod,

388
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:30,083
we should know better
than to think we'll get paid.

389
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,958
Or, at least not
in the usual way.

390
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:36,208
Next time:
"Song of the Fairies."

391
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:38,541
Some words are also promises.

392
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:41,208
Comrade means we're
in this together.
