1
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:26,000
After years of
tireless research,

2
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:29,333
I've created the
ultimate parfum.

3
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,625
Man.

4
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:59,166
[NARRATOR] It began in this
small corner of Magnolia.

5
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,416
Soon, all of Fiore would
be gripped with terror.

6
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,750
[JET] I can't wait
to see Levy's outfit.

7
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:07,750
[DROY, JET]
Huh?

8
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:08,625
[MAN 226A]
Sniff, sniff.

9
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:09,916
Sniff, sniff...

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,833
What's so interesting
about a storm drain?

11
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:12,916
[DROY]
Beats me.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,125
Are you okay, sir?

13
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:16,250
[DROY] Did you lose
some food down there?

14
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:22,166
Man.

15
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,041
Isn't that guy
from Blue Pegasus?

16
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,416
What brings you to
Magnolia, Mr. Ichiya?

17
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,791
[MAN 226A]
Sniff, sniff.

18
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:29,250
[DROY, JET]
Uh...?

19
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:30,958
[JET]
What's wrong with you?

20
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,458
[DROY] Since when was Ichiya
this tall and lanky?

21
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:34,541
[MAN 226A]
Sniff, sniff.

22
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:37,500
[JET]
I'm creeped out here.

23
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:40,166
Hey! Back off!

24
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,875
[JET, DROY scream]

25
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:47,708
[ICHIYA]
Man.

26
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,666
[CROWD]
Sniff, sniff. Sniff, sniff...

27
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:31,125
[CROWD chattering, giggling]

28
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:36,000
[LUCY groans] How did I let
myself get dragged into this?

29
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,125
[ERZA] I don't see what
you're complaining about.

30
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,333
[LUCY]
Uh?

31
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:40,625
Eight Island's grand
opening will bring in

32
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,500
a great deal of cash. Right?

33
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,875
I know how to bring
in the customers!

34
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,375
[groans]

35
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,375
Is there a reason the rest
of you aren't bussing tables?

36
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:50,833
[WENDY]
Sorry, we're on break!

37
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:54,000
[JUVIA] And the two of you
are having so much fun.

38
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,625
By the way, Erza.
Have you seen this yet?

39
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,625
The new Sorcerer Weekly?

40
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,375
[JUVIA]
Check it out.

41
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,916
Top Ten Pretty Man
Wizard Ranking.

42
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,750
Huh. I didn't realize
that was a thing.

43
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,125
There! See?

44
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:10,541
My beloved Gray made it
onto the list! So dreamy!

45
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,833
[ERZA] What? But, I thought
the term "pretty man"

46
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,791
only applied to
people like Ichiya.

47
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,416
[WENDY, JUVIA gasp]

48
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,250
Well, he's always
calling himself that!

49
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,916
I mean, he practically preaches
it to every corner of Fiore.

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,166
Calling yourself a pretty man
doesn't make it true.

51
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,708
See?

52
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,375
When you compare my darling
and the others to Mr. Ichiya,

53
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:31,000
the difference is as clear
as night and day!

54
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,541
[ERZA] So they're
different. Interesting.

55
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,375
Sometimes I wonder
how she manages

56
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:36,666
to make it through the day.

57
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,041
It defies logic.

58
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,041
Have any of you
seen Jet or Droy?

59
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,125
They said they'd be here.

60
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,708
You'd think those two
would have been

61
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,666
first in line just to get a peek
at you in a waitress uniform.

62
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,041
[WENDY]
Oh, speak of the devil!

63
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,375
Come sit wherever
you like, guys!

64
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,750
[DROY]
Levy...

65
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:54,958
[JET]
Levy...

66
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,666
Hey! What took you so long?

67
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,333
[ERZA, LUCY gasp]

68
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,208
[CARLA, WENDY, JUVIA gasp]

69
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,458
[JET, DROY]
Man!

70
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,041
[HAPPY]
Fairy Tail of the Dead...

71
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:16,833
[ICHIYA, HAPPY]
...Men!

72
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,625
[JET, DROY]
Sniff, sniff. Sniff, sniff.

73
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,083
[ALL scream]

74
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,833
What happened? Why do
they have Ichiya's face?

75
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,833
I think my mind just threw up.

76
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,166
[JET, DROY]
Levy...

77
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,333
[CARLA]
Stay strong, child! We need you!

78
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:34,791
I don't like this! Stay away!
Noo! Stop smelling me!

79
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:35,833
Levy!

80
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,125
Lucy, don't!

81
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:40,250
I get the feeling we
should keep our distance!

82
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,916
[LUCY]
Levy!

83
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:46,333
[LEVY]
What's wrong. Lucy?

84
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,708
Man.

85
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,500
[screams]

86
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,291
[LEVY, JET, DROY]
Sniff, sniff...

87
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,958
If they get close enough to
sniff you, it's game over.

88
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,666
We need to get out of here, now!

89
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,250
Curse you, Ichiyas!

90
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,583
Mark my words,
you will be punished!

91
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:05,458
[LEVY, JET, DROY]
Man... Man...

92
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,833
Hurry back to the guild hall!

93
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,750
I'll make sure these
three are dealt with.

94
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,416
You better be right behind us!

95
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,958
[JUVIA] Don't let them
sniff you, or you'll be

96
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,625
chasing parfums as well.

97
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:14,625
[ERZA]
I'll be fine.

98
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,375
These Ichiyas are
clumsy and slow.

99
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,416
They'll never keep up with me!

100
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,250

101

[LEVY, JET, DROY]
Man!

102
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,833
I should find Mr. Yajima.

103

--[ICHIYA] Man...
--[YAJIMA] Sniff, sniff.

No! My handsome face!

00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,833
[MAN 226F]
Someone help me!

108
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:49,208
No! Get back!
I don't wanna be a...

109
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,166
[ICHIYA]
Man!

110
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,666
What do we do?

111
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,833
The town is filled
with Mr. Ichiyas.

112
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,791
This is the end
of the world, isn't it?

113
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,041
[CARLA]
Hey! Where's Lucy?

114
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,291
[WENDY]
Did she get separated from us?

115
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,708
[JUVIA] She was dressed
in a constricting outfit.

116
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,083
[groaning]

117

Hey! You guys all right?

00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,708
[WENDY]
Gray!

[JUVIA]
Oh!

120
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:21,875
The true pretty man has
come to rescue his beloved!

121
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,208
The entire town is
filled with Ichiyas.

122
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,250
Thought I was havin'
a nightmare at first.

123
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:30,375
How are things at the guild?

124
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:33,083
[GRAY]
Bad. Real bad.

125
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:40,750
[ZOMBIES moaning]
Man... Sniff, sniff...

126
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:44,541
[CARLA] There's no way we could
handle everyone at the guild.

127
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,208
[GRAY]
Especially Laxus.

128
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,500
Even as an Ichiya,
he's unstoppable.

129
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,791
[WENDY] I guess his
strength didn't change.

130
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,958
Man. Sniff, sniff.

131
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,750
[GRAY] Are you the only
ones that got away?

132
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,916
[CARLA]
Erza and Lucy may have. But...

133
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,083
[WENDY]
We got separated from them.

134
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,916
Oh, darling. I'm so scared.

135
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,291
Don't worry.

136
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,500
[whimpers]

137
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,458
It's gonna be all right.

138
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,000
[WENDY, CARLA scream]

139
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,041
Especially once
I've sniffed you.

140
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,041
Sniff, sniff. Sniff, sniff.

141
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,666
Your parfum is amazing! Man.

142
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:20,125
[WENDY, CARLA, JUVIA scream]

[LUCY panting]

144
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,041
This sucks. What now?

145
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,541
[ASCA]
Yeehaw!

146
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,666
[ASCA]
Wait up, butterfly!

147
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,916
[BISCA] That was our first
long trip in a while!

148
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,500
[ALZACK]
Good times.

149
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,000
[LUCY]
Wow, they're okay.

150
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:45,041
They look totally
normal, literally.

151
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,208
But first, I need some lovin'.

152
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:52,458
I was thinkin' the same thing.

153
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,958
[gasps]

154
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,208
Man.

155
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,208
[BISCA]
Sniff, sniff. Sniff, sniff.

156
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,958

00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,375
[LUCY whimpers]

158
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,791
[LUCY]
I've died and gone to hell.

159
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:09,083

00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,083
You have to find Natsu!

317
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,166
No, I can't. I won't!

318
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,333
[CARLA]
You don't have a choice, child!

319
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,333
I'm sorry. Truly!

320
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,666
[WENDY]
Romeo!

321
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,833
We're all counting
on you, Wendy!

322
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,625
Please! Find Natsu!

323
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,041
Romeo!

324
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,208
[CARLA]
Don't look, Wendy!

325
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,500
Man.

326
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,583
--[WENDY sobs]
--I'm sorry, but you'll have

327
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,625
to save your tears
for later. If we fail,

328
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:51,833
his sacrifice will mean nothing.
I refuse to let that happen!

329
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,875
[WENDY]
Yeah.

330
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,041
Some "great idea" that was!

331
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,500
Next time, keep me out of it!

332
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,875
I lost my best hope for
survival thanks to you!

333
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,375
We did you a favor tearin' up
that sweat factory.

334
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:03,625
[HAPPY]
Aye.

335
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:04,958
The sooner we get to the
outskirts of the city,

336
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,583
the better off we'll be.

337
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,958
[scraping]

338
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,166
You guys hear that?

339
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,333
Yeah.

340
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:12,875
I guess the sewer
covered up their scent.

341
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,083
[LUCY]
Big Lily!

342
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,333
[NATSU]
I see that!

343
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:18,083
I told you hiding was
pointless, Salamander.

344
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,833
Lucy is with them.

345
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,833
I could sniff that
parfum all day.

346
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,250
[HAPPY]
Natsu, there's more coming!

347
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,458
[NATSU]
We're in trouble!

348
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:26,375
[LUCY screams]

349
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,625
[NATSU]
We're really in trouble!

350
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:28,958
[HAPPY]
There's nowhere to run!

351
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,916
[LUCY]
And swimming's not an option.

352
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,666
Yah! Guess we'll just have
to bust our way through!

353
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,708
No way!

354
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:35,375
[NATSU]
Happy!

355
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,208
[HAPPY]
Aye, sir!

356
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,666
[NATSU]
Lucy! Climb on!

357
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,208
[LUCY]
Oh, all right.

358
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,791
Get nice and close, freak shows!

359
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,125
I'll give you something
worth a good sniffin!

360
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:55,375
Fire Dragon... Roar!

361
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:58,041
[NATSU, LUCY, HAPPY gasp]

362
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:23,625
It's, horrible! Magnolia
is filled with Ichiyas.

363
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:26,125
[LUCY]
Nightmare fuel.

364
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,375
I can't carry you
both at the same time!

365
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,166
Don't you dare drop us, cat!

366
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,291
You're... so... heavy!

367
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,416
[WENDY]
Natsu!

368
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,125
[CARLA]
Thank goodness we found you!

369
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,375
[NATSU]
Hey!

370
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,166
[LUCY] I was afraid we
were the only ones left!

371
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,916
Carla! I'm so glad
you're all right!

372
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,041
Why me?

373
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,541
Listen!

374
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,541
We ran into Romeo earlier,
and apparently he figured out

375
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,041
how to beat the Ichiyas!

376
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,291
--[LUCY] For real?
--[HAPPY] So... heavy!

377
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,166
[CARLA] But they got him
before he could tell us.

378
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,458
[NATSU]
Oh, no.

379
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:53,875
Thing is.

380
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,833
He told us to find you before
he sacrificed himself!

381
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:57,750
Me?

382
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,833
[HAPPY]
Natsu. We're gonna fall.

383
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,291
Wonder why.

384
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:05,333
[HAPPY moans]

My arms are gonna tear off!

386
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:09,166
Yeah!

387
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,208
What's up?

388
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,750
[CARLA]
Did you think of something?

389
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,791
Lucy. I need
you to let me go.

390
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:14,458
Why?

391
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:15,833
No time to explain!

392
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,375
It's something crazy, right?

393
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,041
Duh!

394
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,458
[LUCY]
Don't make me regret this!

395
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,708
Hey, it's me
we're talkin' about!

396
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:30,166
[yells]

397
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:39,291
[NATSU grunting]

398
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,958
[CARLA] It's a good thing
the Ichiyas are too slow

399
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,000
to keep up with him.

400
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,666
Natsu might pull this off!

401
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,000
Heavy! I can't keep this up!

402
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,750
That joke's played
out. Hold on.

403
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,500
Is Natsu heading
where I think he is?

404
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,708
[HAPPY] You're right!
But why would he go there?

405
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,500
[ERZA]
Natsu! I've had it!

406
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,833
What's your deal?

407
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,958
You stink. Half the guild
is complaining about it.

408
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:03,250
I've been busy, and
bathing's such a hassle.

409
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,500
Aye!

410
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,708
Besides, it's okay not
to bathe for a few days.

411
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,291
Once a week gets it done.

412
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,916
I hope you weren't
planning on going

413
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,500
to Yajima's grand
opening like that.

414
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:16,291
We're supposed to draw customers
in, not drive them off.

415
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,375
Man!

416
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:24,708
[ZOMBIES moaning]
Man...

417
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,958
[ERZA]
Fine. I'll lend you this.

418
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,166
[NATSU]
What is it?

419
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,958
[ERZA]
A deodorizer lacrima.

420
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,458
It's not a bath substitute,
but it'll suffice.

421
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:38,916
So, am I supposed to eat it?

422
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,083
[NATSU yelps]

423
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,458
Whoa! Awesome!

424
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,541
This thing totally slayed my BO!

425
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,583
Don't hog it, bro!
I wanna try some, too!

426
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:52,958
Spray me next!

427
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,000
Like children.

428
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,500
I've never understood
how someone

429
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,750
with a nose that sensitive
could live with his own stench.

430
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:13,041
[ZOMBIES]
Man? Sniff, sniff.

431
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:19,166
[NATSU grunts]

432
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,250
[NATSU]
There it is! Uh-oh!

433
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,958
Man. You've got a pretty parfum.

434
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:31,958
[NATSU] I don't got time
to play with you right now!

435
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,166
[LAXUS]
Natsu!

436
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:37,750
Man!

437
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,916
Get a sniff of this!

438
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,833
[LAXUS]
Maaaaaaan!

439
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,583
Hey. What's goin' on?

440
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:53,875
[NATSU laughs]

441
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:57,416
[ZOMBIES moaning]

442
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,291
What the hell?
Why's everyone so ugly?

443
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,458
Heads up! Time for
your wake-up call!

444
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:14,083
[HAPPY, LUCY,
CARLA, WENDY laugh]

445
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,666
"Virus?" More like
the apocalypse.

446
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,041
Next time I see Ichiya,
he's dead meat.

447
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,625
I have a feeling you'll
have to get in line

448
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:22,875
for that, dear.

449
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,291
How did it start in the
first place? You know?

450
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,125
Apparently it was a
"pretty man" potion

451
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,416
Ichiya developed.

452
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,875
Man.

453
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,083
Wow.

454
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,708
I can't believe
that little troll

455
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,083
caused such a calamity.

456
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,500
Yeah, but, it could
have been worse.

457
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,166
The magic council
slapped that sucker

458
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,666
with a "forbidden magic" label,
and Ichiya is serving hard time.

459
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,833
Ma... Man!

460
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,458
Yeah, well, he got off easy.

461
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:47,791
I shudder to think
what the world

462
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,541
would look like if Natsu
hadn't found that lacrima.

463
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,791
Don't forget,
there are many scars

464
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,458
that will have to heal, as well.

465
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,166
Especially for those
unfortunate souls

466
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,416
who were turned into
mindless Ichiyas.

467
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,208
Doesn't that
include you, Erza?

468
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,750
Please, don't remind me.

469
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:02,833
I need therapy.

470
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:04,875
I need a hot bath
and a shower.

471
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,833
I didn't think
it was that bad.

472
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,708
We wouldn't be here
without you, Natsu.

473
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:09,583
Thanks!

474
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:10,625
Well, you know!

475
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,375
You don't need to be
a pretty man.

476
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,958
It's what's on the
inside that matters.

477
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,000
Geez, backhand much?

478
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,708
[LUCY giggles]

479
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,458
[NATSU]
All right! Time for that bath!

480
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:58,500
We're gonna need your
tub for a bit, Lucy.

481
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:01,833
[LUCY] Okay. Hold on,
why do you need my bathtub?!

482
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:03,666
Let's get this over with, Happy!

483
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,916
[HAPPY]
Aye.

484
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,166
[LUCY] You still haven't
answered my question!

485
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,916
Man.

486
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,458
[LUCY] After winning first place
in the Grand Magic Games,

487
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:18,333
Fairy Tail finally recovers
our former prosperity.

488
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,041
Job requests pour into the guild

489
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,541
from every corner of Fiore,
and the wizards enjoy

490
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:24,958
day after day of
lively activity.

491
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:27,500
But, one day, a certain
job flier arrives,

492
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:30,458
specifically asking
for Natsu and Gray.

493
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:33,000
What is this particular job
from a particular person

494
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:35,083
that's got the guild
in a frenzy?

495
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:38,333
Next time:
"Morning of a New Adventure"!

496
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:41,166
Get ready for the next
exciting chapter!
