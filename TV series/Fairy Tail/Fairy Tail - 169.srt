[MAKAROV] That Alexei

strange to anyone else?

If Makarov knew our
secret, why didn't he

be more dangerous

than keeping it to himself.

00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,833
[SHELIA] Wind, O,
wind. Rouse the sky

315
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:10,208
and rip the land asunder!
Sky God Dance!

316
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:13,458
[WENDY screams]

317
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,375
[SHELIA] Now for the fun part!

318
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,958
[WENDY] Sky Dragon Talon!

319
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,416
[SHELIA] Aaahhh!

320
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,250
Sky Dragon!

321
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,875
And Sky God!

322
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,500
Hold on, what'd she say?

323
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,750
Are they using the
same type of magic?

324
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,708
[MAVIS] That's Lost Magic!

325
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,416
[LYON] Our little Shelia
is full of surprises.

326
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,125
[WENDY] Roar!

327
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,000
--[SHELIA] Howl!
--[WENDY] Roar!

328
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,916
[ALL scream]

329
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
[CHAPATI yells]

330
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,250
Didn't see that comin'.

331
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,375
This is awesome!

332
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,000
Yeah, says you!

333
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,416
[OHBA] Don't look, boys!

334
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,791
[YUKA] Knock it off, old hag!

335
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,291
[TOBY] Do you want me
to have nightmares again?

336
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,416
Hm.

337
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,083
I know what you are.

338
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,833
[LYON] Shelia is
a Sky God Slayer.

339
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,083
God-slaying magic.
Wielded by a child?

340
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,083
You mean he
wasn't the only one?

341
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,500
Do you know this magic?

342
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,583
That Grimoire guy. I
think his name was Zapgrow?

343
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:26,625
Pretty sure you got that
wrong, but close enough.

344
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,458
He used God Slayer
magic like Shelia?

345
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,083
[NATSU] Yeah, he did.
But, if you ask me,

346
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,625
he was a pushover! No biggie!

347
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,375
[ERZA] God-Slayer or not.
Wendy is forced to face

348
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,250
this new opponent on her own.

349
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,875
She may be in for the
toughest fight of her life.

350
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,791
[WENDY] I wasn't expecting this.

351
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,583
[SHELIA] Well, Lyon
told me all about you.

352
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,125
I was really
excited when I learned

353
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,500
you used magic
that's similar to mine.

354
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,166
Maybe a little
too excited. Sorry.

355
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,583
Did I go overboard?

356
00:17:56,666 --> 00:18:01,291
No, I'll be fine.
It's a fight, after all.

357
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,541
[SHELIA] Since we're
here we might as well

358
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,000
have some fun with it, right?

359
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,791
[WENDY] Yeah, I guess so.
I've never figured out how

360
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,958
fighting others
could be a source

361
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:13,000
of entertainment
for some people...

362
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:16,166
but I'll do my
best for Fairy Tail!

363
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,958
I like your attitude, Wendy.

364
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:21,083
Then I'll fight extra hard
for love and Lamia Scale!

365
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,833
This match just
keeps getting better!

366
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,625
Not only are they an
eleven on the cuteness scale

367
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,458
but they're
also super powerful!

368
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,666
Put that rug back
on your noggin'!

369
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,666
[CHAPATI] Just look at them go!

370
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,833
It's a full-force
battle of the breezes!

371
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,500
But will Shelly-welly
blow lil Wendy away?

372
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,625
What is he? Insane?

373
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,833
He's just showing the
world what a putz he is.

374
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,250
[WENDY] I can't give up.

375
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,541
Everybody else fought so
hard to get us this far!

376
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,500
[WENDY] It's my turn now
and I won't fail them!

377
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,583
Not after Elfman
put his trust in me!

378
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,375
[WENDY] I don't like fighting.
And honestly, I hope I never do.

379
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,541
But, at the end of
the day, when it comes to

380
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,750
standing up for Fairy Tail...

381
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,416
[WENDY] I'll fight with
everything I've got!

382
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:30,666
Oh wow, you really do
eat air! This'll be a blast!

383
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,458
[SHELIA] Better
eat my fill, too.

384
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:36,083
[JURA] Well I'll be. I don't
think I've ever seen Shelia

385
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,166
gorge on air in the
middle of a battle.

386
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,750
Young Wendy must be quite
the formidable opponent.

387
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,250
Take this seriously!

388
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,500
Or you'll end up losing
your favorite sock!

389
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,291
I doubt that.
You're the only one

390
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,125
with a weird sock fixation.

391
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:51,291
Keep watching, her
real power is yet to come.

392
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,708
[CHAPATI] I'm not sure,
but it looks like

393
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,791
those two are feasting on air!

394
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,208
[coughs]

395
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:59,333
Save some for the rest of us,
girls! We kinda need it!

396
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,416
Dragon Slayer Secret Art!

397
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,291
[PORLYUSICA]
She's mastered one of them?

398
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,166
And at such a young age!

399
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,666
Here it comes!

400
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,708
Yeah!

401
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,416
Wendy learned a
secret technique?

402
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,916
A really strong one, too!

403
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,208
She's quite resourceful.

404
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,416
What are you doing now?
Are you trying to trap me?

405
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,208
[SHELIA]
But you're in here, too!

406
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:23,250
Shattering Light Sky Drill!

407
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:34,500
[SHELIA yells]

408
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,208
Shelia!

409
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,791
[LUCY and NATSU] Yeah!

410
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:47,833
[WENDY] I haven't fully
mastered the Milky Way yet,

411
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:51,083
but I gave the Sky
Drill everything I had.

412
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,458
[WENDY] This is
my full strength.

413
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,916
[MATO] Oh, my.

414
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,875
[PORLYUSICA]
Well done, child. Well done.

415
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,333
[gasps]

416
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:09,791
[WENDY] I hope I didn't
overdo it. But, this means...

417
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,458
[MATO] I-I-It looks
like Shelia is down!

418
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,541
The winner of match
four is Fairy Tail--

419
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,416
[SHELIA] No, wait!
Don't count me out yet! Look!

420
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,250
I'm up! I'm up! This fight
is just getting started!

421
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:27,000
You're really somethin'
else! That was so fun!

422
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,666
[MATO] Oh, how embarrassing!

423
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,333
Um, my apologies!

424
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,958
Uh. You ladies
can keep going now!

425
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,458
How is she still standing?

426
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,375
Oh no! Her injuries
have all healed!

427
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,375
Sky God Slayer
magic allows wizards

428
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,083
to heal their own
wounds mid-battle,

429
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,250
something Wendy can't do.

430
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:47,000
In other words...
she has no chance of losing.

431
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,291
I had no idea
she was this strong.

432
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,875
Dammit, Lyon!
I should have known

433
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,625
you'd have a trump card.

434
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,500
I wonder what's causing
Shelia to hold back like that?

435
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:58,041
It's hard to believe she's
still not fighting seriously.

436
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,875
She's got some
bite to back up her bark!

437
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,875
Well, the little darling
is my cousin, after all!

438
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,875
That's got nothing to do
with it and you know it!

439
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,041
[SHELIA]
You're not hurt, are you?

440
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,416
I was hoping we could play more.

441
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,083
Come on, Wendy!

442
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,291
[JELLAL] Excuse me.

443
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,875
[DORANBOLT] Sure.

444
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,500
[DORANBOLT] Mystogan?

445
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,583
[MELDY] Jellal! Can you hear us?

446
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,916
[ULTEAR] Well?
Did you find anything?

447
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,958
[JELLAL] No. Nothing yet.

448
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:31,250
[JELLAL] Shelia? Don't tell
me that little girl is

449
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,625
connected to Zeref somehow.

450
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:39,333
[JELLAL] If she is,
Wendy's in grave danger!

451
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:41,208
I have to do something!

452
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:15,416
[HAPPY] Aw man, Wendy
and Shelia are so cute

453
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,541
their popularity
just skyrocketed!

454
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,875
[NATSU] Things did get a
little strange for a bit there.

455
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,458
[HAPPY] But I'm younger,
smaller, and cuter than

456
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,291
both of them
put together, right?

457
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,333
[NATSU] It's not
that big a deal, bro.

458
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,916
[HAPPY] It is too! Believe it
or not, there are some battles

459
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,416
I refuse to lose and
this is one of them!

460
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:33,833
[HAPPY and NATSU]
Next time: "Small Fists!"

461
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:36,166
[NATSU] Hold up. What kind of
battle are we talkin' about?

462
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,583
[HAPPY] The uphill struggle
to be in the center

463
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:39,708
of the spotlight, of course!

464
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:41,875
[NATSU] Ah. Good luck with that.
