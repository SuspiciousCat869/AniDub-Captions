by some unknown magic.

Our heroes came
hoping to save them,

5

but faced resistance
from Sylph Labyrinth,

00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:31,458
a treasure-hunting guild,

7
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:34,541

Eternal Flame for itself.

face-to-face with Minerva,

This has been a good chat, Erza.

17

00:00:56,958 --> 00:01:00,333
Though I doubt you can do much
more than cry in your state.

19

I have to admit, the underworld
has some intriguing magic.

23
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:14,333
So your little band
of thieves've got

24

a wizard after all, huh?

[DORIATE] I already told
you, I'm not a thief.

26

What's wrong, are you too afraid
to face me in a fair fight?

27

You'll recall that I was
never much for fairness.

28

But the underworld has
really expanded my horizons.

29

Prepare yourself.

30
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:31,291
And this isn't some
trivial competition, Erza,

31
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:32,916
it's a fight to the death.

why did ya ask for both of us?

Because, this ice
is far from ordinary.

It will take more than
fire alone to melt it.
