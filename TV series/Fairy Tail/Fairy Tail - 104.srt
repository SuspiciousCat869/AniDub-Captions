1
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:22,500
- Kain: WE LANDED
ON THIS FREAKY LOOKIN' ISLAND

2
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:25,750
TO CARRY OUT TWO CRITICAL
MISSIONS FOR OUR MASTER.

3
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:28,125
( panting )

4
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:31,750
THE FIRST ONE IS TO CAPTURE THE
LEGENDARY BLACK WIZARD ZEREF,

5
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:34,208
ALIVE AND UNHARMED.
THE SECOND ONE IS...

6
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,458
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

7
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,375
HOW ABOUT YOU GUYS?

8
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,833
OH, RIGHT.
I'M ALL ALONE IN THIS PLACE.

9
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,000
WHERE DID EVERYONE GO?

10
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:45,250
I THINK... I'M LOST!

11
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,333
- ( theme music playing )

12
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

13
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,541
- I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
UNTIL THE COUNT OF THE THREE

14
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:24,000
TO GET OUT OF MY SIGHT,
OTHERWISE YOU AND YOUR COMRADES

15
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,833
WILL SEE THE OTHER SIDE
OF OBLIVION.

16
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:30,625
- THE ULTIMATE MAGIC SPELL
THAT VANQUISHES EVERYONE

17
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,958
WHOM THE CASTER
DEEMS TO BE A FOE...

18
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,416
- ONE!

19
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,708
- LET'S SEE YOUR FAIRY LAW
IN ACTION.

20
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:38,958
- TWO!

21
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,000
AND THAT'S THREE.

22
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,666
TIME'S UP!

23
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,583
FAIRY... LAW!

24
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,166
- DON'T BE SO HASTY.

25
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,291
GRIMOIRE...

26
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,916
LAW.

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,416
- ( grunts )

28
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,416
WHAT? IMPOSSIBLE!

29
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,583
NO, IT CAN'T BE!

30
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,541
- HELLO, BOY.

31
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,041
YOU'RE LOOKING WELL.

32
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,291
- IT IS YOU.

33
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,541
MASTER PRECHT!

34
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,041
- ( growls )

35
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:33,291
DAMN IT! WHO DO THOSE COUNCIL
LOW-LIFES THINK THEY ARE?!

36
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,583
I'VE HALF A MIND TO SQUASH
'EM INTO THE GROUND!

37
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,458
- OH, YOU WANT ME
TO CALM DOWN?

38
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,875
MAYBE I'LL USE YOU TO VENT
THESE PENT-UP FRUSTRATIONS!

39
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,958
- WAIT!
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS!

40
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:45,166
- Precht: THAT'S ENOUGH, BOY.
LET HIM GO.

41
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,166
- OH, MASTER!
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE BACK.

42
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,875
- DO YOU REVEL IN MAKING TROUBLE
WHENEVER YOU GO ON A JOB?!

43
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,333
- Makarov: SO I ROUGHED UP
SOME HAS-BEEN BANDITS

44
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,166
WHO WERE TALKIN' SMACK
ABOUT OUR GUILD.

45
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,125
I DON'T SEE
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

46
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:03,333
- THERE IS NOTHING WRONG
WITH FEELING THE NEED

47
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,958
TO DEFEND SOMETHING
YOU HOLD SO DEAR.

48
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,916
BUT VIOLENCE ULTIMATELY
BEGETS MORE VIOLENCE.

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,916
- WAS I JUST SUPPOSED
TO LET 'EM GET AWAY WITH IT?

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,041
- HARMONY IS KEY.

51
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,416
FORGIVENESS CAN BE
A POWERFUL THING,

52
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,208
JUST LIKE VIOLENCE.

53
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,375
WHETHER YOU FORGIVE
OR SEEK REVENGE

54
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,208
IS UP TO YOU.
BUT KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES.

55
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,458
- YOU EVER GET TIRED
OF SAYIN' THAT?

56
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,416
- I'LL KEEP SAYING IT
UNTIL IT SINKS

57
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,041
INTO YOUR THICK SKULL, BOY.

58
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:33,083
- SERIOUSLY!
STOP CALLING ME "BOY!"

59
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,583
- MASTER.

60
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,083
IT'S REALLY YOU.

61
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,125
WHY?
IS THIS SOME SICK JOKE?

62
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,041
( grunting )

63
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,541
( growls )

64
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:29,041
I SEE YOU'VE TRADED IN
YOUR IDEALS FOR A DARKER ROBE.

65
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,125
- AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,
YOU STILL VIEW THE WORLD

66
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,541
IN BLACK AND WHITE.

67
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,041
I'D HOPED BECOMING
GUILD MASTER

68
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,000
WOULD BROADEN
THAT NARROW VIEW OF YOURS.

69
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,333
- FORGIVE ME IF I DON'T
GIVE A DAMN.

70
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,541
I MAY HAVE A NARROW
FIELD OF VISION,

71
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,583
BUT I SEE
MY ENEMIES CLEARLY.

72
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,291
- ( laughs )
AT LEAST YOU LEARNED

73
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,000
HOW TO TALK THE TALK
WHILE I'VE BEEN AWAY, BOY.

74
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,916
- I ALWAYS HATED
THAT NICKNAME.

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,833
IN FACT, I WANTED TO DECK YOU
EVERY TIME YOU USED IT.

76
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,291
BUT I HAVE NO DESIRE
TO FIGHT YOU NOW.

77
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,916
LEAVE BEFORE WE DO
SOMETHING DRASTIC.

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,250
- THOUGH IT PAINS ME
TO DO SO,

79
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,916
MY PATH IS ALL TOO CLEAR
AT THIS POINT.

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,125
IT WOULD SEEM
FATE HAS CHOSEN ME

81
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,291
AS THE INSTRUMENT
OF FAIRY TAIL'S DESTRUCTION.

82
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,333
- BUT FIRST, YOU'LL HAVE
TO GO THROUGH ME!

83
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,166
- IF YOU WISH TO THROW
YOUR LIFE AWAY, BOY,

84
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,541
SO BE IT.

85
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,916
- PURGE THE DARKNESS,
O RAIN OF LIGHT!

86
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,333
- THAT WON'T BE ENOUGH.
MAKAROV.

87
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,250
SWALLOW THE LIGHT,

88
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,208
O SHADOW
OF ETERNAL DARKNESS!

89
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,583
- IN THAT CASE!

90
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,541
WHAT?!
HE CAST AN AMATERASU

91
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,666
FORMULA 28 CIRCLE
AS IF IT WERE NOTHING.

92
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,958
- UNDERSTAND WHAT
YOU'RE UP AGAINST NOW?

93
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,500
- ( whooshing )

94
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,458
- ( both grunting )

95
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,416
- ( screams )

96
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,875
- I LIVE AND BREATHE
THE DARK ARTS.

97
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,083
YOUR DEFEAT IS CERTAIN.

98
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,708
- ( groaning )

99
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,791
WHAT IS THIS?!

100
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,666
- MMM.

101
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,208
- MAXIMUM DEFENSE
MAGIC CIRCLE.

102
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,583
THREE PILLAR GODS!

103
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:47,291
- AMATERASU FORMULA 100.

104
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,958
- ( cawing )

105
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,375
- ( screams, grunts )

106
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,166
- I DIDN'T LIKE THE SOUND
OF THAT. - ME EITHER!

107
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,125
I HOPE ONE OF OUR GUYS
CAST THAT THING.

108
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,208
- I'M GETTING REALLY TIRED
OF THESE JERK-WADS

109
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,875
PLAYING IN OUR BACKYARD.
- THERE'S SO MANY OF THEM.

110
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,583
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THEY WANT?

111
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,125
- I DON'T KNOW,
AND TO BE HONEST I DON'T CARE!

112
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,541
EVERY ONE OF THESE
GRIMY HAMBURGERS

113
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:24,875
ARE ABOUT TO FEEL THE BURN!

114
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,208
- WAIT, AREN'T THEY CALLED
"GRIMOIRE HEART"?

115
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,208
- DON'T BOTHER CORRECTING HIM,
HE'S ON A ROLL!

116
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,291
- ( thinking )
MEST MENTIONED SOMETHING

117
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,000
ABOUT THE LEGENDARY
BLACK WIZARD BEFORE.

118
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:36,291
COULD IT BE...
GRIMOIRE HEART'S GOAL

119
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,916
IS TO FIND...

120
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,958
- LORD ZEREF.

121
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,958
- YOU'RE GETTING IN MY WAY!
- ( roaring )

122
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,250
- WIND BLADE!

123
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,333
- HOLY CRAP!
SHE'S PISSED!

124
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:56,041
SHE DESTROYED THOSE GUYS!
- TOO BAD. IT'S THEIR FAULT.

125
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,291
THEY SHOULDN'T BE TRESPASSIN'
ON SACRED GROUND.

126
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,500
- HEAR THAT?
HOPE YOU'RE READY FOR MORE!

127
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,500
- ( roars )
- ( gasps )

128
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,291
- CANA!
STAY FOCUSED, WOULD YA?!

129
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,750
- YEAH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.
THANKS, LUCY.

130
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,416
- C'MON.
THERE'S NO END TO 'EM!

131
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,291
THEY CRAWLIN' OUT
OF THE GROUND TOO?

132
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,708
- THERE MAY BE A LOT,
BUT THEY'RE PRETTY WEAK OVERALL.

133
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,875
- THAT DOESN'T HELP IF
THE ATTACKS NEVER STOP COMING.

134
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,583
- Cana: SHE'S RIGHT. WE CAN'T
KEEP THIS UP INDEFINITELY.

135
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,083
WITH THESE NUMBERS,
THEY'LL EVENTUALLY WEAR US OUT.

136
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,708
ONCE WE'VE EXHAUSTED
OUR MAGIC POWER,

137
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,291
THEY CAN PICK US OFF WITH EASE.

138
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,041
- IF I SUMMON TAURUS
OR SAGITTARIUS

139
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,625
WE MIGHT EVEN THE ODDS.

140
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,958
- THAT'S TOO MUCH OF A GAMBLE.
IF THEY HAVE MORE REINFORCEMENTS

141
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,000
YOU'D JUST BE WASTING POWER.
- NOW I'M MAD!

142
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,000
AND IF THEY THINK
THEY CAN TAKE US

143
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,416
WITH A BUNCH OF MASK-WEARIN'
CLOWNS, THEY'RE DEAD WRONG.

144
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,666
- ( grunts )
- ( groans )

145
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,875
- WATER LOCK!
- NOT GOOD.

146
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,291
NUMBERS DON'T SEEM TO BE
DECREASING AT ALL, DO THEY?

147
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:49,166
- THAT EXPLOSION. DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA WHAT CAUSED IT?

148
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,625
IT GAVE OFF TREMENDOUS
MAGIC POWER.

149
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,541
- I KNOW.
WE CAN WORRY ABOUT THAT

150
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,791
AFTER WE'VE DEALT WITH THE
PROBLEM AT HAND. - RIGHT.

151
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,166
OH, GRAY, ALTHOUGH
THE ENEMY SURROUNDS ME,

152
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,500
I CAN ONLY THINK
OF YOUR GORGEOUS FACE.

153
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,375
WHAT I WOULDN'T GIVE TO BE
FIGHTING BY YOUR SIDE

154
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,583
INSTEAD OF ERZA'S!

155
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,083
- WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HANDLE THEM ON YOUR OWN?!

156
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,291
- NO, MA'AM!

157
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,750
- ( screaming )
- GO, DREAM KNOCK!

158
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,416
- ( sighs )

159
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,500
- THIS KITTEN'S GOT CLAWS!

160
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,291
MEOW!
- ( groans )

161
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,708
- ARE YOU OKAY, LISANNA?
- I'M FINE.

162
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,125
YOU THINK THE OTHERS HAVE
RUN INTO THE SAME PROBLEM?

163
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,083
- WE DON'T HAVE TIME
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

164
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,750
JUST KEEP DEFENDING THE CAMP!
- WHATEVER YOU SAY.

165
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,583
- MANLY STRIKE!

166
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,125
EVERGREEN, TIME TO DO
YOUR THING!

167
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,333
- I'LL SAY THIS AGAIN:

168
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,291
WHEN I NEED A BIG OAF
TO ORDER ME AROUND,

169
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,166
YOU'LL BE THE FIRST TO KNOW!
- WHAT THE--

170
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,333
- I CAN'T MOVE!
- DON'T LOOK INTO HER EYES!

171
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,583
- SHE'S USING
PETRIFICATION MAGIC!

172
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:47,541
- WELL, NORMALLY I WOULDN'T
RESORT TO SUCH CHEAP TACTICS,

173
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,625
BUT IF IT GETS THE JOB DONE,
I GUESS IT'S MANLY.

174
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,541
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY "CHEAP"?!

175
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,708
- ( thinking )
THE FIGHTING NEVER ENDS.

176
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,083
NOTHING EVER CHANGES.

177
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:03,125
IS IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR EXISTENCE

178
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,375
TO MOVE FORWARD
WITHOUT VIOLENCE?

179
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,291
IS IT SO INTRINSIC?

180
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:11,291
WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO END
THE CONFLICT OCCURRING NOW?

181
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,541
CAN THERE EVER BE PEACE?

182
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,000
OR IS DEATH THE ONLY WAY?

183
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,666
- ( soft moans )

184
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,041
- I'D EXPECT NO LESS
FROM MY SUCCESSOR.

185
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,916
IT'S NO SURPRISE YOU'VE HELD
THE GUILD TOGETHER

186
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,291
FOR 48 YEARS.

187
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,750
- ( groaning )

188
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,875
- HMM?

189
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,000
WHAT IS IT, BOY?
ARE YOU NOT FEELING WELL?

190
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:41,208
I GUESS THE YEARS ARE
CATCHING UP WITH YOU.

191
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,833
NEARLY HALF A CENTURY
HAS PASSED

192
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,916
SINCE WE PARTED WAYS.
DOES FATE INTEND

193
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,291
TO BRING US FULL CIRCLE ON THIS
LONELY AND VENERATED GROUND?

194
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,250
- ( grunts )

195
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,750
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.

196
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,208
YOU WERE AN AMAZING
GUILD MASTER, PRECHT.

197
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,125
YOU ALWAYS SPOKE OF HARMONY

198
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:02,791
AND DID YOUR BEST TO LEAD US
TOWARD A PATH OF RIGHTEOUSNESS.

199
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,000
DID YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND

200
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,250
OR WAS IT ALL A LIE?

201
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,500
( moans )

202
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,708
- LONG AGO, MAGIC WAS BORN

203
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,541
FROM THE DEPTHS OF DARKNESS.

204
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,625
AND THOSE WHO
UTILIZED ITS POWER

205
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,708
WERE MET WITH FEAR
AND PREJUDICE.

206
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,333
EVENTUALLY MAGIC
BECAME COMMONPLACE,

207
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:30,125
SO MUCH THAT WE INTEGRATED IT
INTO OUR CULTURE.

208
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,166
BUT AS I DELVED DEEPER
INTO THE SOURCE OF MAGIC,

209
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,250
I FOUND THAT IT ALWAYS
LEAD BACK TO ZEREF.

210
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,833
AT LAST I SAW THE TRUTH.

211
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,666
I HAD FOUND THE PERSONIFICATION
OF WIZARDRY.

212
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,791
SLEEP, BOY.

213
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,125
FAIRY TAIL SHALL REST HERE,

214
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,666
WITH MAVIS.

215
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,208
- ( growling )

216
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,666
( screaming )

217
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,541
- IT'S NOT OVER.

218
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,666
NOT YET.

219
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,375
MY SUCCESSOR,

220
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:25,125
I HOPE YOU'RE READY
TO BEAR THIS BURDEN.

221
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,583
- HUH?

222
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,166
I FEEL LIKE

223
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,541
SOMEONE JUST
WALKED OVER MY GRAVE.

224
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,666
- ( screaming )

225
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,625
- YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA CATCH ME!

226
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,583
- STUPID FLYING CAT!
- WE'VE GOT YOU NOW!

227
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,041
- ( yelps )
WHATEVER WILL I DO?!

228
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:13,375
YOU TOTALLY FELL FOR IT.
- All: NO NO NO NO NO!

229
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,541
- ( giggles )

230
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,333
- ( grunts )
- ( screams )

231
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,083
- LILY!

232
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,375
- DON'T OVERDO IT!
JUST SAVE YOUR STRENGTH!

233
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,291
- DAMN.
IF I HAD MORE MAGIC POWER

234
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,458
I COULD HELP NATSU
AND HAPPY FIGHT THEM OFF.

235
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,250
- YOU'LL HAVE
TO SIT THIS ONE OUT.

236
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,750
WENDY CAN HEAL BUT SHE CAN'T
RESTORE YOUR POWER.

237
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,833
LET THEM HANDLE THIS.
- WE'RE IN A CRISIS

238
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,791
AND I'M STUCK ON THE SIDELINES?
UTTERLY DISGRACEFUL!

239
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,750
- DID YOU SEE
WHERE MEST WENT OFF TO?

240
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,041
- FORGET HIM.
WORRY ABOUT YOURSELF, CHILD.

241
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,458
- SHE'S RIGHT.
YOU SHOULD HURRY

242
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,833
AND USE YOUR MAGIC
TO HEAL THOSE WOUNDS.

243
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,250
- THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.

244
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,916
- I WAS AFRAID
YOU'D SAY THAT.

245
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,833
- YOU GUYS SHOULD HIDE!
- BUT, HAPPY--

246
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,625
- DON'T WORRY, NATSU AND I
CAN HANDLE 'EM, NO PROBLEM!

247
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,500
- VERY WELL.
CAN'T BE HELPED.

248
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,666
SO WE'LL LEAVE IT TO YOU.
BEST OF LUCK.

249
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,916
- YOU'RE SERIOUS?
- IN OUR CURRENT CONDITION

250
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,541
WE'RE A LIABILITY AND WOULD ONLY
BE A BURDEN ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

251
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,541
- DON'T FEEL BAD. YOU CAN KICK
BACK AND TAKE A LOAD OFF.

252
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,083
LEAVE THE WORK TO THE REAL
HEROES OF THE STORY!

253
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,791
- I'VE GOT ENOUGH ENERGY
TO SLAP HIM AROUND A BIT.

254
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,375
- LILY, NOW IS NOT THE TIME.

255
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,250
YOU CAN GIVE HIM A GOOD SMACK
ONCE WE'RE HOME.

256
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,541
- AW, C'MON, DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE DONE ALREADY!

257
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,791
INVADING OUR ISLAND
IS BAD ENOUGH,

258
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,375
BUT MY PRECIOUS SCARF
TURNING BLACK HAS ME

259
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,791
BURNIN' UP WITH ANGER!

260
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,750
LET ME KICK YOUR TEETH IN
A LITTLE BIT MORE!

261
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,958
- WHAT?! YOU'RE JUST VENTING
ON US? - WHAT A JERK!

262
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,708
- WE DIDN'T TOUCH
YOUR SCARF!

263
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,833
- I'LL DO MORE
THAN BURN IT BLACK.

264
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,875
I'LL TURN IT TO ASH!
- HUH?

265
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,416
- FIRE BULLET!
- HEE HEE!

266
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,000
COME TO PAPA!

267
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,500
- ( cheering )
- BULL'S-EYE!

268
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,666
- THAT'S WHAT YOU GET!
- ( laughs )

269
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,666
MY FIRE BULLETS ARE HOT ENOUGH
TO MELT SOLID ROCK.

270
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,833
I DON'T CARE IF HE WAS
A FIRE WIZARD,

271
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,083
HE COULDN'T'VE SURVIVED--
WHAT THE HELL?!

272
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:59,416
- WHAT IS THIS GUY?
- HE'S EATING FIRE?!

273
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,666
- IMPOSSIBLE!
- WAIT, IS HE...

274
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,083
- AHH. - ...THE ONE
EVERYONE TALKS ABOUT?

275
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,458
- THANKS FOR THE SNACK;
NOW I GOT A FIRE IN MY BELLY!

276
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,791
- THE DRAGON SLAYER.

277
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,125
NATSU THE SALAMANDER?!

278
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,708
- FIRE DRAGON WING ATTACK!
- ( moaning )

279
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,916
- HE'S TOO MUCH FOR US!

280
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,125
- YEAH.
WE SHOULD GET OUTTA HERE!

281
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,791
- NO MATTER WHAT WE THROW
AT THIS MONSTER

282
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,083
WE CAN'T EVEN TOUCH HIM!

283
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,625
- WHO ARE YOU CALLIN'
A MONSTER?

284
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:31,000
- ( whimpering )
- Zancrow: ENOUGH ALREADY!

285
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:34,458
( laughs )
I CAN'T WATCH ANYMORE.

286
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,916
( laughing )
- UHH.

287
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,500
- Soldier: IT'S ZANCROW!
- HMM?

288
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,291
- Zancrow: LEAVE HIM TO ME.

289
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,541
I WAS HOPING TO GET SOME
EXERCISE ON THIS TRIP.

290
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,000
HUH, I'LL POUND THIS RUNT
INTO THE DIRT

291
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,208
WHILE YOU GO
LOOK FOR ZEREF.

292
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,416
JUDGING BY WHAT
I'VE SEEN SO FAR,

293
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,000
IT SHOULDN'T TAKE MORE
THAN A FEW MINUTES.

294
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,833
- ZEREF?

295
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,750
- Wendy: SO GRIMOIRE
HEART'S GOAL

296
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,166
REALLY IS THE BLACK WIZARD.

297
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,875
- Pantherlily: AND WE'RE JUST
CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE.

298
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,791
- Carla: WHY ARE THINGS
ALWAYS SO COMPLICATED?

299
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,625
- THANKS A LOT, ZANCROW!
- WE OWE YOU ONE!

300
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,791
- I DIDN'T THINK THEY
HAD ANYONE THAT STRONG.

301
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,250
- HE DEFINITELY
LIVES UP TO HIS REP.

302
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,500
- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!
- ( wails )

303
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:18,875
- HE'S STRONG? THIS FAIRY
TAIL PANSY SCARES YOU?!

304
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,750
- UH... WELL.

305
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,083
- IT WAS A SLIP OF THE TONGUE!
- PLEASE FORGIVE US!

306
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,791
- THERE'S NO GUILD IN THIS WORLD
THAT CAN COME CLOSE

307
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,541
TO THE STRENGTH
OF GRIMOIRE HEART, UNDERSTAND?!

308
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:29,791
- BLACK FLAMES?

309
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,083
- IF YOU THINK
HE'S STRONGER THAN US,

310
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,916
THEN YOU DON'T BELONG HERE!

311
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,791
- DO YOU FEEL THAT POWER?

312
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,375
- I DON'T LIKE
THE LOOKS OF THIS.

313
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,541
- AND AS OF NOW,
YOU'RE ALL OUTTA THE GUILD!

314
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,875
- ( whimpers, screams  )

315
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,291
- NO WAY!
HE JUST WASTED HIS OWN MEN!

316
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,541
- ( cackling )

317
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,000
- YOU JERK!

318
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,291
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT
TO YOUR FRIENDS?!

319
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:05,125
- THEY WEREN'T MY FRIENDS.
IT'S NOT YOUR BUSINESS ANYWAY.

320
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,541
AND IF I WERE AS WEAK AS YOU,

321
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,833
I'D BE CAREFUL WHO I
RUN MY MOUTH TO!

322
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:13,708
- WHAT A JOKE! DON'T YOU KNOW
YOUR FIRE AIN'T GONNA HURT ME?!

323
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,458
- NATSU! STAY BACK!

324
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,958
THOSE FLAMES ARE BAD NEWS!

325
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,458
DON'T LET 'EM TOUCH YOU!
- ( moans )

326
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,833
( screams )

327
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,791
( gagging )

328
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,083
WHY CAN'T I EAT IT?!

329
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,250
WHAT IS THIS?!
YOU TRICKED ME!

330
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,666
- THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
FOR BEING SO COCKY!

331
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,625
NOW IT'S TIME
FOR THE MAIN COURSE!

332
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,333
( cackling )
- NO, NATSU!

333
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,125
- I THOUGHT THAT
A FIRE DRAGON SLAYER

334
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,750
COULD EAT ANY FLAME IN
EXISTENCE! - ( grunting )

335
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,791
- ( laughs )
SERVES YOU RIGHT

336
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,625
FOR TRYING TO EAT
ABOVE YOUR STATURE,

337
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:50,833
YOU LOWLY DRAGON HUNTER.
D'YOU LIKE MY DIVINE FLAMES?

338
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,708
- WHADDAYA MEAN
"DIVINE" FLAMES?

339
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,250
- EXACTLY WHAT
IT SOUNDS LIKE.

340
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,208
MY MAGIC IS WAY
OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE.

341
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,625
YOU'RE UP AGAINST
A GOD SLAYER.

342
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,500
MAKE PEACE
WITH YOUR OWN, FAST!

343
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,708
- Wendy: A GOD SLAYER?!

344
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,833
- ( all panting )

345
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,666
- NOT GOOD. I'M ALMOST
COMPLETELY OUT OF POWER.

346
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,875
- SAME HERE. BUT I THINK
WE PUT MOST OF 'EM DOWN.

347
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,500
- ALL RIGHT.
LET'S TAKE OUT

348
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,958
THE REST OF 'EM AND GO
LOOK FOR THE OTHERS.

349
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,125
- Lucy: BUT WHAT IF THEY'RE
FIGHTING THESE GUYS TOO?

350
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,041
WE WON'T BE ANY HELP!

351
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,041
- Gray: WE'LL CROSS THAT BRIDGE
WHEN WE COME TO IT,

352
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,458
BUT RIGHT NOW WE GOTTA--
- Loke: WAIT!

353
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,291
I SENSE SOMETHING.

354
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:45,166
- ( all gasp ) - ARE THEY
TURNING INVISIBLE ON US?!

355
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,291
- MAYBE THEY WERE JUST
SUPPOSED TO DISTRACT US

356
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,541
AND THEY SUCCEEDED.

357
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:52,166
- OR THEY ALL LEFT...
BECAUSE OF HIM!

358
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,916
- Caprico: THEY'RE INCAPABLE
OF DEFEATING YOU,

359
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,708
SO THERE'S NO NEED FOR THEM
TO CONTINUE FIGHTING.

360
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,833
BUT YOUR FIGHT IS FAR FROM OVER
PREPARE FOR BATTLE.

361
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,916
- THAT'S...
- A GOAT?

362
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,541
WEARING A SUIT?
- ( hisses )

363
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:09,416
- YOU OKAY THERE?
- YEAH.

364
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,625
BUT KEEP YOUR GUARD UP,
THIS GUY'S ON A WHOLE OTHER

365
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,041
LEVEL THAN HIS FLUNKIES.

366
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,291
WE'RE IN FOR ONE HECK
OF A FIGHT.

367
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,541
- Juvia: HOPEFULLY THAT
WAS THE WORST OF THEM.

368
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,791
- I WOULDN'T COUNT ON IT.
- RIGHT.

369
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,833
- ( chimes )
- WHO GOES THERE?!

370
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,125
- I HAVE ENCOUNTERED
THE ENEMY DURING THE MISSION.

371
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,333
I WILL DESTROY THEM
IMMEDIATELY.

372
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:35,791
ENDING THEIR LIVES IS NOW
MY HIGHEST PRIORITY.

373
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:40,000
COMMENCING
COMBAT OPERATIONS.

374
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,791
- A CHILD?
- DON'T LET YOUR GUARD DOWN.

375
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,958
THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE
ABOUT THIS GIRL.

376
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:48,291
- ( scoffs ) THAT A BAD GUY
OR A FLOWER ARRANGEMENT?

377
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,875
- WHATEVER IT IS,
IT TOOK A BATH IN COLOGNE.

378
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:54,166
- ( sighs ) IN A DESOLATE
FOREST ON A LONELY ISLAND,

379
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,541
THE DEVILS AND FAIRIES
DANCED A TANGO OF DEATH.

380
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,416
- UH...
- I AIN'T DANCING.

381
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,791
- UH-HA.
MAY THESE STONES AND MOSS

382
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,083
SERVE AS A BALLROOM
FOR OUR SOIREE.

383
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,708
- Elfman: CAN I PUNCH HIM NOW?

384
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,166
- IF IT'LL SHUT HIM UP,
BE MY GUEST.

385
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,083
- ( both gasps ) - Mirajane:
WHOEVER YOU ARE, COME OUT!

386
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:14,333
- Azuma: RIDICULOUS.

387
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:17,583
FIRST CATS AND CHILDREN,
NOW TWO YOUNG LADIES?

388
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,916
- LISANNA, STAY BEHIND ME.

389
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,958
- COME ON, SIS,
I CAN HELP YOU!

390
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,375
- ( crying )

391
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,208
I'VE BEEN OUT HERE FOR HOURS!

392
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,875
WHY CAN'T I FIND ANYONE
IN THIS FOREST?! I'M SWEATY,

393
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,791
I'M HUNGRY AND I WANT
SOMEONE TO RUB MY BELLY!

394
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,791
( wails )

395
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:39,166
- MY LORD,
I'LL BE WITH YOU SOON.

396
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,500
- Hades: MAKAROV'S BRATS
DON'T STAND A CHANCE

397
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:53,000
AGAINST THE SEVEN KIN
OF PURGATORY.

398
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,291
I'VE SPENT YEARS CRAFTING
THEM INTO SORCERERS

399
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:56,958
OF UNPARALLELED POWER.

400
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:59,166
EACH ONE OF THEM IS
A MASTER OF AN ART

401
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,875
THAT WAS BORN
FROM THE SOURCE OF ALL WIZARDRY:

402
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:04,250
FORBIDDEN LOST MAGIC!

403
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:07,958
FAIRY TAIL'S FINEST WILL
CRUMBLE LIKE DEAD LEAVES

404
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:11,666
UNDER THE KIN'S
OVERWHELMING MIGHT.

405
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:15,000
- ( cackles )
BRING IT ON, RUNT!

406
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,625
LET'S SEE IF I CAN
SCROUNGE A MEAL

407
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,333
OUT OF THOSE
PATHETIC FLAMES!

408
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:20,333
- I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING
YOU CHOKE ON 'EM, FREAK!

409
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,291
MY FIST'LL BE
THE MAIN COURSE!

410
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,916
- AHHH.

411
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,416
I'M A GONER.

412
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,666
SOMEONE GIVE ME FOOD.

413
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,000
HEY, I THINK I HEAR
WATER NEARBY.

414
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:36,208
WHAT I WOULDN'T GIVE FOR A NICE
TALL GLASS OF IT RIGHT NOW.

415
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:39,750
I THINK I'LL
JUST TAKE A NAP.

416
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,875
( whispers )
SOMEONE HELP ME.

417
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:44,083

418
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:46,208

419
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:14,750
- Natsu: I'M THE ONLY
FIRE USER AROUND HERE!

420
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,708
- Happy: HE SAID HE
WAS A GOD SLAYER.

421
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:17,708
BUT WHEN YA THINK ABOUT IT,

422
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,416
WHAT EXACTLY IS A GOD ANYWAY?

423
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,250
- Natsu: THEY'RE THOSE
FUNNY-LOOKING VEGETABLES, RIGHT?

424
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,625
- NO, YOU'RE THINKIN' "GOURD."

425
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,625
- THEN IS IT WHAT LUCY
LIKES TO FLAUNT?

426
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:27,333
- NO, THAT'S HER "BOD."
- MAYBE IT'S LIKE THE STUFF

427
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:28,708
THAT FREAKAZOID DAPHNE
WAS TRYING TO--

428
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:33,291
- NO, THAT'S "FRAUD"!

429
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:34,708
- Natsu: JEEZ! WOULD YOU AT
LEAST LET ME

430
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:35,916
FINISH WHAT I'M SAYING?

431
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,625
- Happy: NATSU,
IF I DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER

432
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,875
I'D SAY YOU WERE MESSING
WITH ME ON PURPOSE.

433
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:41,625
- WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST CLUE?
