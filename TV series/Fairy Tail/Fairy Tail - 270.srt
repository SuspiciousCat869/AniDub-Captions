1
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:26,166
How much longer do we have to
walk before we get to Magnolia?

2
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,291
[PRECHT] We should be there
in about three more days.

3
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:29,791
Wha--?!

4
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,583
I guess we're gonna be campin'
out in the forest tonight.

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:34,791
Is this guy crazy?
I can't sleep outside!

6
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,125
[MAVIS] Come on, Zera.
It'll be an adventure!

7
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:38,666
We'll have fun!

8
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,041
Don't you get that this isn't
like the woods back home?

9
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,708
This is like one of
those haunted forests

10
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:44,375
from the stories
we used to read!

11
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:45,708
[screams]

12
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,791
You see! This place is
crawling with creepy bugs!

13
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,000
And I'm sure there
are snakes, too!

14
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,083
[MAVIS] They're more afraid
of you than you are of them.

15
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:53,875
[ZERA]
That's impossible!

16
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,208
We're sleeping under the stars!

17
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,333
Time to camp out!

18
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,916
I'm gonna find some wood to
build the best damn camp fire

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,375
you guys have ever seen!

20
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,666
[PRECHT] I'm going to hunt
down fresh meat for dinner.

21
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,750
And I'll go see if I can find
some mushrooms and herbs

22
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,500
to have with it!

23
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:42,541
I think I'm gonna stay
right here and keep watch.

24
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,041
Meat, side dish,
guard duty, what's left?

25
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,958
Oh, right, I'll go try
and catch some fish!

26
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:06,458
[ZERA screams]

27
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:07,083
[gasps]

28
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,291
Uh-oh.

29
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,125
Zera! What happened?

30
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,666
Is everything okay over here?

31
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,583
Yeah, I just took
a little spill.

32
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,291
These fish are a
lot harder to catch

33
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:25,166
than the ones we
have back home.

34
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,916
I'm glad it was just that.
You had me worried!

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,625
Sorry, I didn't mean to!

36
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:30,958
[chuckles]

37
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,041
Perhaps it would
be a better idea

38
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,666
to look for nuts or
berries instead.

39
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,958
What is this place?

40
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,916
I have no idea. I've never
seen anything like this.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,041
We should show the others
and see what they think.

42
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,916
[YURI] What the heck
happened to the trees?

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,833
It's as if a poisonous
wind swept through

44
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,500
and killed all the living
things in the area.

45
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:06,166
I'm beginning to get the feeling
that it would be too dangerous

46
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,291
to camp out in the forest

47
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,500
and maybe we should
get out of here.

48
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,250
No, the sun's already
starting to set.

49
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,875
I think it's worse to travel
an unknown path in the dark.

50
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,083
Yeah.

51
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,166
Where we're camped is
far enough from here

52
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,833
that we should be
out of harm's way.

53
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,375
That makes sense.

54
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,958
Being seasoned treasure hunters,

55
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,041
you clearly have a whole
lot more experience

56
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,916
with phenomena like
this than I do.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,750
Right? Don't you think?

58
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,291
Well, if you think
so, then yeah.

59
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,625
Speaking of experience,

60
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,291
this seems oddly
similar to something

61
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,125
that went down on another gig.

62
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,541
Do you remember?

63
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:40,541
I do.

64
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,000
Feels a lot like our adventure

65
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,291
at the ruins in
Hell's Valley, right?

66
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,000
Did you say "Hell's Valley"?

67
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,000
[PRECHT] That was
definitely more dangerous

68
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,666
than taking a straight path
through a dark forest, though.

69
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,583
Yeah, the particulars are
startin' to come back to me now.

70
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,583
Yuri put us through
a special kind of hell

71
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:56,750
on that one, didn't he?

72
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:57,625
[YURI grunts]

73
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,333
Yuri caused trouble?

74
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:02,333
What? How? I wanna hear
all the juicy details!

75
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:03,791
[YURI growls]

76
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,125
Will you ever let me
live that one down?!

77
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,375
We got the treasure in the end,

78
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,625
isn't that the only
part that matters?

79
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,208
You'll never live it down!

80
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,583
It's a miracle we even lived to
see the light of another day!

81
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,875
Well, we're standing here
fighting now, aren't we?

82
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,500
You're exaggerating the story
to make me look bad!

83
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,458
With the mistakes you
make on a daily basis,

84
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,666
you do a fine job making
yourself look bad!

85
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,125
[MAVIS] So "Mister Perfect"
isn't perfect?

86
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,791
Oh, I really wanna know what
kind of mistakes he makes!

87
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,875
I'm gettin' really
tired of saying it.

88
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,250
You're reckless and impulsive

89
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,250
and you had better get
that crap under control.

90
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,458
If not, we're all heading
towards an early grave.

91
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,791
[YURI] What? It's not like
you're perfect or something!

92
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,500
You've almost gotten us killed
a few times, too, as I recall,

93
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,791
so don't lecture me
about my mistakes, bud!

94
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,208
I'm saying this stuff
for your own damn good!

95
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,541
So don't come crying
to me if you get hurt!

96
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,916
Why don't you just
mind your own business?!

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,916
Who do you think
you are anyway?!

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,541
[BOTH growl]

99
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,708
[YURI]
Tch!

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,958
Wait, you're just gonna
walk away after that?

101
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,666
I'm sleeping by myself tonight.

102
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't wanna be
anywhere near this jerk.

103
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,541
Well, good, with you gone
my odds of surviving the night

104
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:07,833
just got better!

105
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,541
Come on, you guys!
It's not worth it!

106
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,666
Those two are
acting like children.

107
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,541
[MAVIS] Precht, you're not gonna
do anything to stop them?

108
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,958
[PRECHT] What they do
is up to them, not me.

109
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,083
But splitting up is dangerous.

110
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,458
[PRECHT] Yes, but there's
not much I can do about it.

111
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,875
If something happens
to them, it happens.

112
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,083
Is he serious?

113
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,541
Why don't you and I
split up and go after them?

114
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:37,000
I'll track down Yuri;
you follow Warrod.

115
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,833
If that's what you want.

116
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,125
[MAVIS]
Yuri, where are you?

117
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,125
[MAVIS]
This part is dead, too?

118
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,291
What is going on here?

119
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:53,916
[PRECHT]
Hm?

120
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,000
I guess they really do mean
to sleep on their own tonight.

121
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,041
[PRECHT sighs]

122
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,000
[PRECHT]
Here's the whole story.

123
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,791
We made the trek
through Hell's Valley

124
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,750
in search of a legendary
magical plant

125
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,791
by the name of the Wild Rainbow.

126
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,833
It only bloomed in
one part of a cave

127
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,250
deep in the mountains
around Hell's Valley.

128
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,750
It was known for its brilliant,
rainbow-colored petals.

129
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:23,375
Because of its rarity, the plant
was worth millions of Jewel.

130
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,708
That sounds like an
amazing treasure.

131
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:26,875
[PRECHT]
If we found it,

132
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,541
our reputation
would be unmatched

133
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,000
among treasure hunters.

134
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:34,750
Legends say that it was
protected by an ancient curse.

135
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,208
To reach the treasure,

136
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,166
we had to travel through
a barren wasteland

137
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,041
where poisonous
gases spewed forth

138
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,041
from deep within the ground.

139
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,916
[WARROD] I've never seen
such a desolate place.

140
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,166
[PRECHT] This used to be
the center of a civilization,

141
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,500
despite how barren it seems now.

142
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,458
Its citizens were
plant worshippers,

143
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:52,875
and believe it or not,

144
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,583
there used to be an
abundance of vegetation.

145
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,375
The state it's in
now is the result

146
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,750
of environmental destruction
and climate change.

147
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,208
[WARROD]
Time spares no man or land.

148
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,250
[YURI]
Whatever. Who cares?

149
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,875
Let's just get inside
and grab that treasure.

150
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,625
[YURI sighs]

151
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,208
We can finally breathe again.

152
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:26,166
Stay on your toes, Yuri,
and pay attention.

153
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,333
Legend has it no one
who's entered these ruins

154
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:29,791
made it back out alive.

155
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,708
[YURI]
Don't be a scaredy-cat.

156
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,250
We're gonna make it out,
and when we do,

157
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,916
we'll be rich beyond
our wildest dreams.

158
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,125
I wish you'd slow down.

159
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,500
We need to be extra cautious
inside these caves.

160
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,125
I wanna chase down that thing
before it pulls up its roots

161
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,750
and runs away to make some other
treasure hunters millions.

162
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,791
[sighs]

163
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,416
[YURI]
Dammit, we're lost!

164
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,125
What did I tell you
about being cautious?

165
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,791
[PRECHT] Calm down, you two.
I brought a map with me.

166
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,916
How convenient! I knew
we could count on Precht!

167
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,250
Then why were you
freaking out just now?

168
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:11,000
[PRECHT] We definitely came
in from that direction.

169
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:11,916
Uh.

170
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,291
The lantern's out of oil.

171
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,458
Not to worry, I've got
some extra fuel right here.

172
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,166
[YURI] Man, it's too dark
to see what I'm doing.

173
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,291
If only we knew
how to use magic.

174
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:27,041
I bet we could light up this
entire cave in no time at all!

175
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,000
Uh?

176
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,875
Well, that was perfect timing!

177
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,083
Uhh...

178
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,791
Something weird is going on.

179
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,541
[PRECHT]
Automatic ignition lamps.

180
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,000
They must be
designed to activate

181
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,083
in response to intruders.

182
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,833
That seems like bad news.

183
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,500
[rumbling]

184
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,083
What an astute observation.

185
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,750
We'd better make
a run for it, boys!

186
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,125
Which way, genius?

187
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,750
Oh, I don't know, maybe away
from the falling rocks!

188
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,291
Look! Over there!

189
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,916
[WARROD, YURI yelling]

190
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,041
Where do you think
this thing goes?

191
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,416
Why don't you ask the
guy with the map?

192
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,458
[ALL screaming]

193
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,166
[ALL]
Huh?

194
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,250
What a perfect place to stop.

195
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,291
[PRECHT]
So now what?

196
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,416
[YURI]
We get out and walk, obviously.

197
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,541
[WARROD]
Okay... Then what?

198
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,083
[YURI] I'm sure we'll
figure something out.

199
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,333
Do you ever think ahead

200
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,916
or do you always fly by
the seat of your pants?

201
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,625
[YURI]
Hey! Look at that!

202
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,166
I believe we found our
first treasure, boys!

203
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,208
Are you kidding? That thing has
booby trap written all over it!

204
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:11,541
Nah, there's no writing. And
look at the size of that jewel!

205
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,666
[YURI]
Uh...

206
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,000
[YURI screams]

207
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,833
What did I tell you?!

208
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,291
Shut your mouth
and move your feet!

209
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,708
Keep going! We're almost there!

210
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,791
[ALL screaming]

211
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:49,416
[YURI] Ouch. We're all
still alive, aren't we?

212
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,208
[PRECHT]
By some miracle, yes.

213
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,416
Hey, look. What is this?

214
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,458
How is it so bright?

215
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,291
[PRECHT]
Hm.

216
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,000
This moss is luminescent.

217
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,208
That must be what's
lighting up the place.

218
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,750
Doesn't seem like it
should be here naturally.

219
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,666
[PRECHT] Maybe in the days
of the civilization

220
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,958
this used to be a sacred site.

221
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,416
Look!

222
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,333
[YURI]
It's the Wild Rainbow!

223
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:19,916
[YURI lauging]

224
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,416
Something has been bothering me
about this entire expedition.

225
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,333
Oh, you mean besides Yuri?

226
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:27,416
[PRECHT] I've seen a lot of
traps in other places like this.

227
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,333
They're usually designed
to kill intruders.

228
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,166
The ones here are different.

229
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,750
They seem engineered
to lead anyone

230
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,333
who sets foot in
these caves here.

231
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,166
Doesn't that seem odd to you?

232
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,791
What do you think
that means for us?

233
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,916
The people here worship plants.

234
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,375
This part of the cave
is full of them,

235
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,500
and unusual ones at that.

236
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,500
I suppose what I'm
getting at is this:

237
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,416
What if the traps
we've encountered so far

238
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,375
are set up to lead
intruders to this spot

239
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,541
so that they can become
food for some monster

240
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:55,875
that lives down here?

241
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,083
[gasps]

242
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,291
Yuri, hold on! Stay
away from that flower!

243
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,500
Why?

244
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,666
[WARROD]
What the--?!

245
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:11,666
[growling]

246
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,833
[WARROD gasps]

247
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,500
[roars]

248
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,750
[YURI yelping]

249
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:22,708
Yuri, no!

250
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,291
I knew it wasn't a flower.

251
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,416
It's bait to lure people into
this cave so it can eat them.

252
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,125
Now I understand why
the Wild Rainbow

253
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,916
has never been brought
outta this cave!

254
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,291
Hang on!

255
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,666
Try not to move around
for a second, Yuri!

256
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:45,500
Couldn't you have gotten me down
without shattering my tailbone?!

257
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,958
Gratitude would be
appropriate here!

258
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,791
[roars]

259
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,333
So what are we gonna do
about this monster?

260
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,666
We simply have to
wait for an opening!

261
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,125
At the first opportunity,

262
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,541
grab the flower and
put it in the pod!

263
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,041
You make it sound so easy.

264
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,458
What are you doing now?!

265
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,291
I'm gonna distract this thing
to get you an opening!

266
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,666
You guys go for the flower!

267
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,625
I thought I was the Wild Card!

268
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,166
He's just taking a page
from your book, I guess.

269
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,833
Let's not let him
forget that he did!

270
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,583
[yelling]

271
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,541
[BOTH]
Warrod, no!

272
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,083
Grab the flower while
you have the chance!

273
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,000
No way! Are you crazy?

274
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,125
Hang in there, and
we'll come save you!

275
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,416
I'm a treasure hunter.
I'm capable of saving myself!

276
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,416
We're this close.

277
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,916
Now get it or the
whole expedition

278
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,291
will have been for nothing!

279
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:53,208
Hurry! I can't keep his
mouth open much longer!

280
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,541
You better not get
eaten, you dummy!

281
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,416
The Wild Rainbow
would be worth nothing

282
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,625
if we didn't all make it
out of this cave alive!

283
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,916
[WARROD]
Not good!

284
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,041
[YURI]
Precht, help!

285
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,041
Hold on just a little longer!

286
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:23,791
[YURI]
For real?

287
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,666
[WARROD]
We're gonna die!

288
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,875
[WARROD]
Now's our chance!

289
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,583
How did you pull that one off?

290
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:56,833
[PRECHT]
Well, the thing is a plant,

291
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,500
so I figured the best
course of action

292
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,208
would be to take out the roots.

293
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,291
I'm just lucky it worked.

294
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,833
At least somebody's thinkin'.

295
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,375
I wish you would have come up
with it a little bit sooner.

296
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,125
[PRECHT]
Did you get the Wild Rainbow?

297
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,125
[chuckles]

298
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:11,083
Of course I did.
See for yourself.

299
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,750
Hey!

300
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,250
[rumbling]

301
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,250
Now what the heck is happening?

302
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,875
[PRECHT] All of that activity is
causing the ruins to cave in.

303
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,666
Well that's just great!

304
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,291
So we got out alive
with the treasure,

305
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,708
and we're still working
together to this day.

306
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,125
Oh, wow.

307
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:38,250
I guess going through something
like that builds unity.

308
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,958
You know, Precht, I learned
something from that story.

309
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,583
And that's: We can count on you!

310
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,375
[PRECHT]
That wasn't my intention.

311
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,375
I was simply relaying the
facts as they occurred.

312
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,375
And you're so modest, too!

313
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,791
[WARROD]
Oh-ho!

314
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,916
You've already got a
nice campfire going!

315
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,625
Perfect timing! Take a look!

316
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,875
We caught this big ol' beast
in a lake we found nearby!

317
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,666
You two weren't even
speaking earlier

318
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,500
and now you're going
fishing together?

319
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:06,750
[YURI]
Hm?

320
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,375
Oh. That's right,
we don't like each other.

321
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,208
[WARROD] I was so focused
on catching our dinner,

322
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,583
I forgot I was mad.

323
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,375
Yeah, whatever,
I'm too hungry to care.

324
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,333
Let's grill this tasty monster!

325
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,625
Precht, would you do the honors?

326
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:21,791
I guess when you're friends,

327
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,166
you let go of the things
that don't matter.

328
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,916
Right, Zera?

329
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,791
[WARROD, YURI chuckle]

330
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,166
You know, being
a treasure hunter

331
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,416
certainly seems like a
challenging way of life!

332
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,875
[YURI]
It is,

333
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,833
but the rewards always make
the hardships worthwhile.

334
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,250
The Tenrou Orb is
an S-class treasure.

335
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,083
Once we get it, we can sell it.

336
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,625
And then we'll never
have to work again

337
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,416
for the rest of our lives!

338
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,541
[MAVIS] Judging by the way
you talk about treasure,

339
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,916
I get the feeling you guys are
only going to be our friends

340
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
until we find that orb.

341
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,666
This girl's a smart one, huh?

342
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,375
I guess it makes sense.

343
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,875
But we'll see what
actually happens

344
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,666
after we find what
we're looking for.

345
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,166
I'll say this.

346
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,833
You've led a very sheltered
life on that island,

347
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,041
and you shouldn't trust people

348
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,750
that you've only known
for a little while.

349
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,375
You could easily
end up getting hurt.

350
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,250
But you guys wouldn't do that.

351
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:19,291
Because your eyes tell
me you're trustworthy.

352
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,125
Zera?

353
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,166
Did you see which way she went?

354
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,375
I hope she's not embarrassed

355
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,375
that she wasn't able
to catch any fish.

356
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,875
She can be so
sensitive sometimes.

357
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,708
I'll be back in a bit.
I'm gonna try to find her.

358
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,125
[YURI sighs]

359
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,625
[PRECHT]
That girl is incredibly strange.

360
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:42,166
I really enjoy having
her around, though.

361
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,708
I've been thinking,

362
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,875
maybe we should let her have
the Tenrou Orb back after all.

363
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,125
[PRECHT] To be honest,
I've lost interest in it.

364
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,625
What?!

365
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,583
Did you forget the entire point
of being a treasure hunter

366
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:56,416
is taking things that
other people want?

367
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,041
I won't give in to some kid.

368
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,791
When we find the Tenrou Orb,
we're taking it for ourselves.

369
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,541
That little girl isn't
getting anything.

370
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,458
You're despicable.

371
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,916
[MAVIS] Oh, there you are, Zera.
I was worried about you!

372
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,333
Oh, I'm sorry.

373
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,166
Is something bothering you?

374
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,666
Are you upset that you weren't
able to catch any fish?

375
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,500
[ZERA]
Mh-hm.

376
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:23,416
I'm just a little worn out.

377
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,208
Well, we did live by ourselves
on an island for seven years.

378
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,791
Yeah.

379
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,000
It's been a long time

380
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,791
since I've had to be
around people this much.

381
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,916
It's only three others, though.

382
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,666
You saved me.

383
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,166
I know I would've died that
night if you hadn't been there.

384
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,625
[MAVIS]
Zera!

385
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:43,500
Zera!

386
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,500
Zera!

387
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,708
[coughing]

388
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,916
Zera, you're alive!

389
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,125
[ZERA] I made a vow to myself
and to you seven years ago.

390
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:57,958
I swore that from then on,
I would always protect you.

391
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:01,208
But out here, in the world
away from the island,

392
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:04,333
I feel like there's so much
I don't understand.

393
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,750
So much I've never seen.

394
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,500
I feel useless.

395
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:16,875
In the end, all I ask is
that you stay by my side.

396
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,333
That's what best
friends are for, right?

397
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,250
No, that's not enough anymore!

398
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,458
I can't stand feeling
this way, Mavis!

399
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,041
The only way I'm gonna
be of any help

400
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,791
is if you teach me to use magic!

401
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:33,291
I wanna learn the kind of magic
spells that can beat Blue Skull,

402
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,750
and even those treasure
hunters if we need to!

403
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:39,166
Teach me the strongest
spells you know!

404
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,541
I am always gonna
protect you! I swear it!

405
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,166
Okay! I'll teach you
all the magic I can!

406
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,875
This is so exciting!
So let's not waste any time.

407
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,625
We can start my
training tonight!

408
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,708
[ZERA screams]

409
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,666
I've got to stop doing that!

410
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,083
[laughs]

411
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,666
[gasps]

412
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,916
Get in the water!

413
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,333
This journey's
been so stressful;

414
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,083
we deserve to relax
for a minute or two.

415
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,708
Wait, you mean right now?

416
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,708
Yeah, it feels incredible!

417
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:17,041
It brings back so many memories
of when we were little girls!

418
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,625
I'm not gonna let you
have all the fun!

419
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,458
[ZERA laughs]

420
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:27,041
[laughs]

421
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:30,541
[BOTH laughing]

422
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,500
[gasps]

423
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,875
Look, Mavis, a fairy!
Do you see it?

424
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:40,583
What? No, where is it?

425
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,625
I was talking about the one
we keep in our hearts.

426
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,125
I do.

427
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,750
[WARROD] There it is.
The city of Magnolia!

428
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,000
Whoa!

429
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,583
We finally made it!

430
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,458
So this is the home of the guild
who killed all of our people

431
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,083
and stole the Tenrou Orb.

432
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:11,541
[PRECHT] Our first task
is to locate Blue Skull.

433
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,791
Oh, wow!

434
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,375
I really can't wait to visit
the Kardia Cathedral!

435
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:20,375
Is that the enormous old church
you were telling me about?

436
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:22,458
[PRECHT] Kardia Cathedral
is one of Fiore's

437
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,541
three largest churches.

438
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,208
The legends say that long ago,

439
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,958
the angel known
as St. Mikardia--

440
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,791
Hey, look! See that?

441
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,416
What the heck?

442
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,291
[PRECHT]
What is that?

443
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:36,041
[YURI] It's gotta be
Kardia cathedral, but--

444
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:39,750
Why's there a
blue-skulled dragon?

445
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,750
[MAVIS] My friends and I finally
arrive in the city of Magnolia,

446
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:19,416
only to find that a giant,
blue-skulled dragon

447
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,708
keeps watch over
the Kardia Cathedral,

448
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:23,416
the symbol of the city.

449
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,416
We wander the streets,
looking for answers

450
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,750
about the Blue Skull guild and
the location of the Tenrou Orb.

451
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:31,666
What we find instead is
a hapless, dying city

452
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:35,250
and a people devoid of
joy or hope of any kind.

453
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,666
Next Time: "Blue Skull."

454
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,750
An evil magic power
rules over the city.
