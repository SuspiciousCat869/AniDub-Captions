00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,291
But, Dan...
I don't get it.

159
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,625
How could someone
as brave as he is...

160
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,041
really be an enemy
of Zentopia?

161
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,375
[DAN] Well, he sure
is acting like one.

162
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:39,750
[BYRO] What?!

163
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:40,625
[punch]

164
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,083
Bulls-eye!

165
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,875
That won't
be enough.

166
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,125
[BYRO] Strange sensation...
Looking upon you fills me

167
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,583
with emotions I forgot
a long time ago.

168
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,833
Anger is at the forefront.

169
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,500
You yammer on about
the sanctity of life,

170
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,166
about the nobility
behind your own vendetta,

171
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,041
but you are nothing more
than guild rats chasing coin.

172
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,625
That you would
compare your avarice

173
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,375
to our holy mission
belittles not only us,

174
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:12,125
but the Archbishop and
the ideals he represents.

175
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,916
That's not true!
We're not in this

176
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,875
for the money, okay?!

177
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,541
Yeah, 'cause
we've got plenty!

178
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,541
Enough to pay rent?

179
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,708
And buy food?

180
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,666
[MICHELLE] What are you
waiting for?! Say something!

181
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,125
[LUCY] Well... Uh...

182
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,666
[HAPPY] I really didn't expect
him to throw that out there.

183
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,666
That's big talk
coming from a thief.

184
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,666
You're the one who stole Lucy's
clock hand in the first pla--

185
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,041
This world is already
saturated with chaos.

186
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,208
The Infinity Clock's addition
may not even be noticed.

187
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,500
However...

188
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:44,583
Zentopia's doctrine
is to minimize that chaos,

189
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,375
and to instead, show
the people of this world

190
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,458
the righteous course of action.

191
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,208
The privilege of
putting those ideals

192
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,041
into practice falls
on the Legion Platoon.

193
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,958
[NATSU] Blah, blah! Add 'thou
shall shut-up' to your ideals.

194
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,458
Natsu isn't
hurt anymore!

195
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:00,458
How'd he do that?

196
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,208
Look! That's how!

197
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,791
[LUCY] The tomb's candles!

198
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,625
[HAPPY] Yeah, and
there's tons of 'em!

199
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,791
You dare to desecrate
these flames?

200
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,083
Does your blasphemy
know no bounds?!

201
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,416
What, you gonna
start lecturing me

202
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,833
about my diet now?
Don't bother; I already

203
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,791
forgot most of the crap you
were yammering on about.

204
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,333
I heard some of it,
though...

205
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,291
like "friends"...

206
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,250
and "lives"...

207
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,333
Then you insulted
Fairy Tail.

208
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,458
Now my fists are
gonna lecture your face.

209
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,041
He's provoking him?

210
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,250
As if the guy wasn't
mad enough already.

211
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,541
That's Natsu for ya!

212
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,916
Awesome!

213
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:40,625
[COBRA] I can hear it...
It's close, now...

214
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,833
The end is finally
within our grasp!

215
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,333
[ARCHBISHOP] The end is
finally within our grasp!

216
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:51,250
The end is finally within
our grasp! [crazed laugh]

217
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:00,875
[deep, resonating clock ticks]

218
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,458
[PRIEST A] What is the
Archbishop's condition?!

219
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,000
[PRIEST B] It hasn't
improved at all.

220
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,333
[PRIEST C] But the
Founding Festival is just

221
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,750
around the corner.

222
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,208
[PRIEST D]
It can't be helped.

223
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,208
The cardinals have convened.
They're selecting the next

224
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,041
archbishop as we speak.

225
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,416
[LAPOINTE] Don't be ridiculous.

226
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,833
[PRIEST E]
Cardinal Lapointe!

227
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,250
[PRIEST D]
When did you get back?

228
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,833
[LAPOINTE] Replacing the
archbishop is utter nonsense.

229
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,125
I'm afraid that
we are faced with

230
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,250
a far greater
problem right now.

231
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,750
[PRIEST F]
What do you mean, Sir?

232
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,250
[LAPOINTE] There are traitors
to Zentopia in our midst.

233
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,250
[gasps, murmurs]

234
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,291
Unfortunately,
the Infinity Clock

235
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,666
has recently become
public knowledge.

236
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,125
As if that
weren't enough,

237
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,833
there are also the
attacks on our churches.

238
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,875
I am told these acts are
the work of an insider.

239
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:40,750
My word...

240
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,166
Is there any
proof of this?

241
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,833
[LAPOINTE] Do you think I
have cause to deceive you?

242
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:45,791
[PRIEST D] No...

243
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,125
[PRIEST G]
Of course not, sir!

244
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,541
[LAPOINTE] I am suspicious
of the priest who survived

245
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:52,333
one of these attacks. I wish
to question him personally.

246
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,375
Bring him to me at once.

247
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,125
[PRIESTS AND NUNS]
Yes, your eminence!

248
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,291
[LAPOINTE] I'll tend to
the Archbishop myself...

249
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:02,333
From this point on, no one is to
enter his chambers except me.

250
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,625
[BYRO] This is a holy war!

251
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,666
[NATSU screams]

252
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,458
[BYRO] The retrieval
of the Infinity Clock...

253
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:17,166
That sacred mission is the sole
purpose of the Legion Platoon.

254
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,291
The misguided principles
of a measly guild

255
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,583
can't even compare.

256
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:21,916
[NATSU groans]

257
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,333
[BYRO] If consuming fire
is another manner of magic,

258
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,375
then I will
neutralize it as well.

259
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,583
Yeah? Try it!

260
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:29,916
That's cheating!

261
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,541
Why dontcha fight him
fair and square, old man?!

262
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,083
Or just give up!

263
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,750
I can't believe
Lord Byro hasn't used

264
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,666
a single offensive
spell yet.

265
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,208
Don't act so
surprised...

266
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,458
I mean, the man's
strength is legendary.

267
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:44,000
Only four others in all of
Fiore can even stand up to him.

268
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,458
A weak and helpless fool
like you is unfit to lead

269
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,875
this world out of darkness.

270
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,000
What did you call me?!

271
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,291
A weak and
helpless fool...

272
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,291
A coin-chasing wretch
couldn't possibly understand

273
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,666
what we fight for.

274
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,125
In this world of misery,
people will cling to anything

275
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:02,375
that provides hope. And if
that happens to be Zentopia,

276
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,458
then cling to it they shall!

277
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:07,000
As do we... So if
the Archbishop orders us

278
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,833
to find the clock...
Then that's what we'll do!

279
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,208
If that order requires
us to sacrifice ourselves

280
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,500
or others to succeed...
then so be it.

281
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:18,875
It's our duty... The
greater good must be served.

282
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,166
That doesn't
make any sense!

283
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,625
I didn't
understand it...

284
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,458
But whatever you said,
I know you're dead wrong!

285
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,083
No kidding!
Don't you care that

286
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,250
people are suffering because
of you and your mission?!

287
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,833
Are you that heartless?!

288
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:32,541
[BYRO] It is foolish to act on
emotion. It solves nothing.

289
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,458
To reveal the
course of righteousness,

290
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,958
and to walk its
path unfettered...

291
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,833
[BYRO] We are faced
with difficult decisions

292
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,458
and we are forced
to make sacrifices.

293
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:44,166
The world is filled to
the brim with contradictions...

294
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,250
I believe we are all
painfully aware of that fact.

295
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,208
Therefore, it is
only logical that

296
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:52,166
the path I've chosen
will end in sacrifice.

297
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,125
Aw, man...
The cryptex in my head

298
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,333
is all kinds of jumbled
up after that speech.

299
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,791
[MICHELLE] Making
difficult choices...

300
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,083
That must be
rather easy for you.

301
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,250
[BYRO] What?

302
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,833
[MICHELLE] You said
you follow your "cause",

303
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,750
to make choices instead of
listening to your "emotions."

304
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,166
That's just a strategy

305
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,833
to avoid feeling guilty.
Harden your heart to suffering

306
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,250
and you can
justify any decision.

307
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,583
Michelle?

308
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,375
I'm a little lost on
all this philosophy jargon,

309
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,416
so why don't we just
make out? Sound good?

310
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,875
You dare dispute
the principles

311
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,375
of righteousness with me?!

312
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,500
[DAN] Get down, Loopy!

313
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,875
Stop it, now!
This is righteous?

314
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,583
If you ask me, you're all
just a bunch of bullies!

315
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,833
This is just like
what we saw in Edolas...

316
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,416
those in power making everyone
else suffer and give up their

317
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,291
freedom in the name of
some fake righteousness.

318
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,666
Any path that hurts
innocent people will never lead

319
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,208
to the greater good...

320
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:44,125
In fact, it's nothing
but a dead end!

321
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,666
If you're willing
to follow that path,

322
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,833
then what does it
say about you, huh?!

323
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,625
Even fish are born
free to swim along

324
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,250
any current that
they choose!

325
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,500
It's the same for
'guild-rats' like us!

326
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,250
We decided to use our magic
to help people who need it.

327
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,666
Yes, it is our job and
we get paid for it,

328
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,750
but, in return,
they get happiness!

329
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,625
That's how we got
to where we are!

330
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,291
That's how a
guild works!

331
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,208
Fairy Tail will never
lose to somebody like you!

332
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,708
'Cause fake righteousness
won't help anyone!

333
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,916
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

334
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,375
You dare to ridicule
the followers--

335
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,000
no, all of Zentopia
to that extent?!

336
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,291
[HAPPY] You bet I do!
'Cause you should be ashamed!

337
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,916
Wow, Happy...
Way to tell him!

338
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,125
That's right! Fairy Tail
members listen to

339
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,458
what's in our hearts!

340
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,083
Our guild is about helping
anybody who needs it!

341
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,125
[BYRO] Enough of this nonsense!

342
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,166
Time for your
divine punishment!

343
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:34,958
[ROMEO] That's what you think!

344
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,208
[HAPPY] Take him down!

345
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,000
Get back here!

346
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:37,833
Romeo!

347
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,416
Lord Byro...
Are you mad?!

348
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,625
You can't use
Divine Arrow on people!

349
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,750
You'll kill them!

350
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,541
I shall turn you to dust.

351
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,333
Now, burn and be
purified in the fire...

352
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,416
of your own sins!

353
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,291
Divine... Arrow!

354
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,625
He missed?!

355
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,250
Coco... What are
you doing?!

356
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,291
[COCO] Zero points,
Lord Byro!

357
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,375
Please, you have
to stop!

358
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,875
All the suffering...

359
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,458
All of the chaos we've
caused on our mission...

360
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:18,041
That isn't what the Legion
Platoon or Zentopia stands for!

361
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,625
We should be using our
strength to protect the weak.

362
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,083
Instead of just breaking them
down we should be building them

363
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,250
up and showing them the way.

364
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:28,000
[COCO] What's righteous about
slaughtering our flock...?

365
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,375
Don't you see?

366
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,250
It is hypocrisy...

367
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:34,166
and I simply can't
abide it any longer.

368
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,708
[BYRO] Blasphemy... How
dare you turn your back

369
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,375
on our doctrine!

370
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,375
[COCO] I'm fully aware of
the penalty for betraying

371
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,916
the Legion Platoon.
But, I can no longer see

372
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,291
the righteousness at
the end of this path, sir!

373
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,166
[BYRO] "Righteousness
is like an arrow...

374
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,625
It pierces through all
in an unwavering line

375
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,791
to arrive at
one thing: truth!"

376
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,833
Are you telling me that
teaching has been lost on you?

377
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,458
If the arrow must pierce
through the hearts of lost lambs

378
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:01,041
in order to find what is
right, then it's wrong!

379
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,916
And it should be
snapped in pieces!

380
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,333
What?!

381
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:07,750
[COCO] Lord Byro, I still
believe we can do good...

382
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,791
but I've realized there's more
to me than just doctrine.

383
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,958
After seeing the
way these people act--

384
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,791
how they see the world--
I can't help but be filled

385
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,166
with warmth and happiness.

386
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,416
And I'm sure if you
opened your heart to them,

387
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,916
you might start to feel
the same way that I do.

388
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,291
[BYRO] Coco...

389
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,541
You've been corrupted!
You wretched traitor!

390
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,000
Don't do it.

391
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,875
You will not be
allowed a tribunal.

392
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,750
The only thing that
awaits you... is justice!

393
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,125
Coco!

394
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,875
Goodbye...
Princess Lucy... Thanks...

395
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:49,583
I really wish... you
and I could've become friends.

[BYRO] Titania.

Do not speak my name!
It disgusts me to hear it

404
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,583
said by someone who would
turn on their allies...

habit of putting up with

old timer really giving you

00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,875
that much trouble,
Charcoal-breath?

I'm just playin' around with him

before I kick his butt,
so keep yours outta this!

415
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,500
[LUCY] Everyone made
it... and they found

416
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,833
the other clock pieces!

417
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,666
[NATSU] Even Gajeel's here!

418

[HAPPY] Carla's group
hit pay dirt, too!

419
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:43,208
And with our piece...
we've almost got the whole set!

420
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:46,666
[ERZA] As you can see... we've
obtained all five clock pieces,

421
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,208
save one.

422
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,166
Hand over what
you stole from Lucy

423
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,291
and we'll leave in peace.

424
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,125
I'll only ask once.

425
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:57,375
Then you'll have to take
it from me... Titania.

[ERZA] You're
outnumbered, Byro.

427
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,125
We'll take them
alright, and seal them.

428
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,833
Now... be smart.

429
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,333
It's over...
Surrender it!

430
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,333
[BYRO] I'm afraid
I can't do that.

431
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:12,125
The Infinity Clock was
originally Zentopian property.

432
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,500
Destiny demands
that we watch over it.

433

What?

434
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,000
Is that true?!

435
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,708
Well... To be honest,
I'm not so sure.

[BYRO] You guild rats have
become too involved in this...

438
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,333
You've glimpsed into a
darkness that the world

439
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,333
should never know...
Because of that,

440
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:31,083
I cannot allow you
to leave here alive.

441
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,333
[ERZA] Enough!
Prepare yourself!

442
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,375
No, don't attack!
Magic won't work!

443
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,000
What the heck
are you doing?!

444
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,666
Such fools...

445
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,666
What happened?! Did he
just block all of them?!

Even with our
numbers?!

don't work on him!

This'll be
interesting.

I think you
mean 'annoying'.

450

Right...? Now I'm just a lame
ol' average talking cat!

[BYRO] One spell or a thousand;
it makes no difference...

452
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:08,166
In my presence, wizards cease
to be wizards entirely.

453

[HAPPY] What about cats?

454
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,291
There's still
one option left.

455
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,583
If we can't use magic,
we'll use our fists.

456
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,916
How arrogant.
I've been trained to fight

457
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,541
barehanded against fifty
opponents at once,

458
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,166
you won't even warm me up.

459
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,208
Well, well...
Sounds like Octo-geezer's

fired up, too!

Please stay focused. He's a
very proficient fighter.
