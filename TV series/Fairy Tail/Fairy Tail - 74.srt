1
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,458
- Natsu: PREVIOUSLY,
ON FAIRY TAIL!

2
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,208
- Happy: THE GUILD'S REALLY
GROWN THIS PAST YEAR!

3
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:22,875
WE'VE GOT A BUNCH
OF NEW MEMBERS.

4
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:26,208
- Natsu: YEAH, LUCY CAME ALONG,
THEN GAJEEL AND JUVIA.

5
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,750
- Lucy: AND DON'T FORGET WENDY
AND CARLA JUST JOINED, TOO!

6
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:31,291
I GUESS I MUST BE SOME KINDA
LUCKY CHARM FOR FAIRY TAIL.

7
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:33,291
- Happy: OOH, LIKE ONE
OF THOSE LUCKY CATS?

8
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,416
- Natsu: OR A JINX!

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,875
- Lucy: WATCH IT, PYRO!

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,083
- ( theme song playing )

11
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,000
( singing in Japanese )

12
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:12,541
- HMMM, NONE OF THEM ARE
PARTICULARLY ENTICING, ARE THEY?

13
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,791
- Mirajane: OH MY,
YOU'RE BACK AND ALREADY

14
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,166
LOOKING FOR YOUR NEXT JOB!

15
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,458
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE
GETTING THE HANG

16
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,791
OF THE WORK WE DO AROUND
HERE PRETTY QUICKLY.

17
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,625
- SO FAR SHE'S ONLY
TAKEN THE SMALL,

18
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,291
LOW-PAYING JOBS
AROUND THE CITY,

19
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,875
SO SHE COULD STAND TO
BE A BIT MORE AMBITIOUS.

20
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,958
- I'M TRYING!

21
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,708
- Mirajane: THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH TAKING SMALL STEPS

22
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:30,875
TO BUILD EXPERIENCE.

23
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,250
IT'S PERFECTLY NORMAL
TO START THAT WAY.

24
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,458
- SHE'S RIGHT, BUT DON'T YOU
WANNA START GETTING INTO

25
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,583
SOME OF THE BIG-TIME
JOBS LIKE WE DO?

26
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,875
- THEY'RE FUN, AND YOU CAN
VISIT SOME COOL NEW PLACES.

27
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,416
- NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,

28
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,458
THE SOONER I'M ABLE TO TAKE
ON SOME OF THE BIGGER JOBS,

29
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,916
THE SOONER I CAN BE MORE
HELPFUL TO THE GUILD!

30
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,125
- Happy: WENDY'S FIRST BIG JOB?

31
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,375
- SHE JUST WANTS TO DO
HER PART AROUND HERE, HUH?

32
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:58,750
- GOOD ON YOU, WENDY!

33
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,375
- NOW THAT'S THE SPIRIT!

34
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,125
YOUNG, IDEALISTIC, AND FULL OF
HEART! I'LL DRINK TO THAT!

35
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:04,666
- THANKS A LOT, YOU GUYS!

36
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,083
- LUCY SURE COULD TAKE A PAGE
OR TWO FROM HER BOOK, EH?

37
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,750
- ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY I'M NOT
HELPFUL OR I'VE GOT NO HEART?

38
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,875
- WOW, TOUGH QUESTION.

39
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,833
- NO, IT'S NOT, STUPID CAT!

40
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,458
- I'M HELPFUL BY
INSPIRING OTHERS

41
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:16,916
WITH MY INNER AND OUTER BEAUTY!

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,083
- YOU HELP ME LAUGH,
BY SAYING STUFF LIKE THAT!

43
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,875
- YOU'RE SO RUDE! OH, YOU WANNA
LAUGH AT ME, DO YA? COME HERE!

44
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,083
- ANYWAY, I'M SURE EVERYONE
WHO'S BEEN OUT

45
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,208
ON JOBS FOR A WHILE

46
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,791
WILL BE SURPRISED
WHEN THEY GET BACK.

47
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,750
YOU MIGHT BE THE YOUNGEST
NEW RECRUIT WE'VE HAD.

48
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:33,041
- OH, YEAH, WHAT
WILL GILDARTS SAY?

49
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,125
- I HAVEN'T HEARD
THAT NAME IN AGES.

50
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:38,125
- AND NOBODY'S HEARD FROM
HIM IN A LONG TIME, EITHER.

51
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:41,125
HE'S BEEN ON THAT SAME
JOB FOR HOW MANY YEARS NOW?

52
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,916
- I DON'T KNOW,
LIKE THREE, MAYBE?

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,708
- I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT HIM.

54
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,333
DON'T FORGET WHO
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

55
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,500
I MEAN, IT'S GILDARTS
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

56
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,291
- HE'S FINE,
THAT GUY CAN HANDLE ANYTHING.

57
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,625
- IT JUST SO HAPPENS,

58
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:58,291
WE HAVE A JOB REQUEST
THAT'S PERFECT FOR YOU.

59
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,458
THIS POOR PERSON IS IN
DIRE NEED OF A WIZARD

60
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,958
WHO CAN SOOTHE HIS HEART.

61
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,166
IT DOESN'T PAY A LOT, BUT
IT DOES INVOLVE SOME TRAVEL,

62
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,583
WHICH WOULD BE GOOD EXPERIENCE.

63
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:07,916
- WHERE IS IT ANYWAY?

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,333
ALL THE WAY OVER IN ONIBAS?

65
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,875
- WHAT ARE THEY ASKING FOR?

66
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:14,333
- UH, WELL, IT SAYS
"THANK YOU VERY MUCH."

67
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,458
- THANKS FOR NO REASON?

68
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,416
- HEY! I KNOW THAT!

69
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,791
THAT'S RINGING A
WEIRD BELL INSIDE ME!

70
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,500
IT'S HOPELESS. I'M DOOMED.

71
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,875
WHY? BECAUSE AGAIN AND AGAIN,
I'M LEFT OUT IN THE COLD.

72
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,125
MY ACTORS DESERT ME,

73
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,208
AND MY ART IS KEPT
HIDDEN FROM THE WORLD.

74
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,500
THE TOLL ON MY
PSYCHE IS ENORMOUS.

75
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,750
THANK YOU VERY
MUCH, SIGNED LAVIAN.

76
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,916
- THAT NAME SOUNDS
REALLY FAMILIAR.

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,250
- HE'S THAT CRAZY LITTLE
GUY THAT RUNS THE THEATRE.

78
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,291
- REMEMBER THAT HORRIBLE TRAIN
WRECK OF A PLAY WE WERE ALL IN?

79
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:46,958
- WHOA! YOU MEAN
"FREDRICK AND YANDERICA!"

80
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:50,541
- Gray: WENDY, PLEASE, TAKE MY
ADVICE AND DON'T DO IT.

81
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,375
- Natsu: YEAH, HE'S A TOTAL
SLAVE DRIVER, FOR REAL.

82
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,833
- Lucy: THE WORK WAS HARD,
THE PLAY WAS TERRIBLE.

83
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:59,000
AND HE MADE US DO LIKE FIFTY
SHOWS BEFORE WE COULD LEAVE.

84
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,666
- Carla: I'M AGAINST IT AS WELL.

85
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,041
JUST BECAUSE THE
JOB IS AVAILABLE,

86
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,500
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT.

87
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,291
SOMETHING FEELS WRONG ABOUT IT.

88
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,041
- YOU'RE NORMALLY RIGHT
ABOUT THESE KINDS OF THINGS.

89
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,083
BUT, THIS GUY SOUNDS LIKE
HE REALLY NEEDS SOME HELP.

90
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,541
- FOLLOW YOUR HEART,
BUT USE YOUR HEAD, CHILD.

91
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,708
BESIDES, IF I MAY
SPEAK CANDIDLY,

92
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,958
A JOB SUCH AS THIS, I DON'T
THINK YOU'RE QUITE READY YET.

93
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,333
- THAT'S NOT TRUE!

94
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,000
I AM READY TO DO THIS.

95
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,250
YOU'LL SEE!

96
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,750
- NO, I'M AFRAID THAT
I WON'T SEE, CHILD.

97
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,041
BECAUSE I WILL NOT
BE GOING WITH YOU.

98
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:30,916
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,375
WHY THE HECK ARE YOU
TWO FIGHTING ABOUT THIS?

100
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,333
YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE
TO BE SO HARD ON HER

101
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,708
ALL THE TIME, YOU KNOW?

102
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,041
- ( scoffs )
- ( laughing sheepishly )

103
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,875
WELL, FINE! 'CAUSE I'M
GONNA TAKE THIS JOB ANYWAY!

104
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,333
- OH, MY, WAIT.

105
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,750
YOU'RE NOT THINKING OF
GOING ALONE, ARE YOU?

106
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,875
- YEP! IT'LL BE EVEN
MORE OF AN EXPERIENCE!

107
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,541
- Makarov: HOLD YOUR HORSES,
YOUNG LADY!

108
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,583
I KNOW YOU HAVE A GREAT
DEAL OF GOOD INTENTIONS,

109
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,916
BUT IT'S SIMPLY NOT
WISE TO GO ALONE.

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,708
AND SPEAKING AS THE
MASTER OF THIS GUILD,

111
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,291
I ABSOLUTELY FORBID IT.

112
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,833
( gulping )

113
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,625
( exhales )

114
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:09,166
WHICH OF YOU HAS
BEEN THERE BEFORE?

115
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,500
LET ME SEE. HAPPY!

116
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,541
- WHO ME?

117
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,625
- UM-HMM.

118
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,541
AND, YOU AS WELL, FRIED.

119
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,250
GO WITH THEM, YOU SEEM
TO BE IDLE AT THE MOMENT.

120
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,625
- IF THAT IS YOUR WISH,
MASTER, I SHALL.

121
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,083
- WHAT?

122
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,041
- All: THAT TEAM
IS SUPER RANDOM!

123
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,083
- Wendy: WELL, I GUESS
WE'RE ON OUR WAY!

124
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,125
- ( scoffs )

125
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,166
- TRY TO BE CAREFUL
OUT THERE, YOU GUYS.

126
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,708
- HEY, FRIED.

127
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,375
YOU BETTER NOT LET ANYTHING
HAPPEN TO OUR GIRL, YOU HEAR ME?

128
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:47,708
- I SWEAR ON MY HONOR,
I WILL KEEP HER SAFE.

129
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,791
- REMEMBER THAT THIS IS A
LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR WENDY.

130
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,791
SO PLEASE KEEP YOUR
INVOLVEMENT TO A MINIMUM.

131
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,500
- WHY US THREE?

132
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,625
- ( scoffs )

133
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,125
- SHOULD WE REALLY
LET HER GO LIKE THIS?

134
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,083
- I DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANYTHING FOR US TO WORRY ABOUT

135
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,875
AS LONG AS FRIED
STAYS BY HER SIDE.

136
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,833
- BUT HE'S SO WEIRD AND RIGID.

137
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,416
NOT TO MENTION ALOOF.

138
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,875
SERIOUSLY, I CAN'T
READ THAT GUY AT ALL.

139
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,125
- Man: DUE TO
A WRECK ON THE TRACKS,

140
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:25,000
THE TRAIN BOUND FOR ONIBAS
STATION IS OUT OF SERVICE!

141
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,208
I REPEAT.

142
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,958
THE TRAIN BOUND FOR ONIBAS
STATION IS OUT OF SERVICE!

143
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,500
- OUR FIRST CHALLENGE APPEARS.

144
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,250
HOW SHALL WE PROCEED, WENDY?

145
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,750
- WELL, DON'T FORGET
I CAN USE AERA MAGIC.

146
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,750
I'M PRETTY SURE I COULD
FLY YOU ALL THE WAY THERE,

147
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,083
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANNA DO.

148
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,166
- MM-MM.

149
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,750
THAT'S NICE OF YOU TO OFFER,

150
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:46,083
BUT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO AS MUCH
OF THIS JOB AS I CAN ON MY OWN.

151
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,875
SO THAT MEANS I'M JUST GONNA
HAVE TO WALK

152
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,583
ALL THE WAY TO ONIBAS.

153
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:51,958
- HUH?

154
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,291
BUT IT'LL TAKE US FOREVER
TO GET THERE ON FOOT!

155
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,041
TALK SOME SENSE INTO HER, FRIED!

156
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,666
- I AGREE, THE MATTER
IS SETTLED, THEN.

157
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,458
- YA SEE? EVEN
FRIED THINKS IT'S CRAZY.

158
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,875
- I, TOO, SHALL WALK.

159
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:03,916
- ( exclaims )

160
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,000
- IT IS YOUR WISH.

161
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,625
MY PRIMARY DUTY
IS TO SUPPORT YOU.

162
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:13,500
AND AFTER ALL, IT'S THE
ONE RULE MASTER GAVE ME,

163
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,625
THEREFORE, I MUST FOLLOW IT.

164
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,708
- THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR LISTENING TO ME!

165
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,208
- I WISH HE WOULD'VE
LISTENED TO ME.

166
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,333
SO WE'RE SERIOUSLY GONNA
WALK ALL THE WAY THERE?

167
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,166
- WELL, TO BE
COMPLETELY ACCURATE.

168
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,166
WENDY AND I WILL
BE WALKING THERE.

169
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,666
WHILE YOU, NO DOUBT, WILL FLY.

170
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,208
- WHAT IN THE HECK KIND OF
DIFFERENCE DOES THAT MAKE?

171
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,833
- ACCURACY CAN MAKE A
WORLD OF DIFFERENCE.

172
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,708
AS ONE WHO USES ENCHANTMENTS,

173
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,083
I MUST ALWAYS BE
PRECISE IN MY WORDS.

174
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:45,291
- Happy: EITHER WAY,
IT'S GONNA TAKE FOREVER.

175
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,541
- Wendy: THEN LET'S GO.

176
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,833
I'D REALLY LIKE TO GET
THERE BEFORE SUNSET.

177
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:56,583
- WHAT'S THIS? WENDY TOOK
THE JOB AT THE THEATRE?

178
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,083
- AFRAID SO.

179
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,416
AND I WAS MORE THAN WILLING
TO GO ALONG TO HELP HER,

180
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,000
BUT MASTER THOUGHT
THAT HAPPY AND...

181
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:07,333
- AH-A-EE-EWE-A-OOH-AH-OH-KAH...

182
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:10,083
- KAY-KEE-KU-KAY-KU-KAH-KU...

183
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,500
- SO WHY EXACTLY
ARE YOU DOING THAT?

184
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,166
- ALL THINGS ARE READY,
IF OUR MIND BE SO.

185
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,666
- BE READY FOR WHAT?

186
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,875
- MASTER WAS RIGHT,

187
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,375
BUT I STILL CAN'T STOP WORRYING
ABOUT SUCH A SMALL GROUP

188
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,875
BEING UP TO THE TASK AT HAND.

189
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,458
THEREFORE, I'M GOING TO HELP.

190
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,250
- ARE YOU ALREADY PACKED?

191
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,791
AND IS IT JUST ME OR
ARE YOU CARRYING

192
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,375
MORE LUGGAGE THAN NORMAL?

193
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:32,541
- WELL, THIS IS A SPECIAL JOB.

194
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,625
- UH, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD THAT.

195
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,000
- I TOOK IT IN LIEU
OF MONETARY PAYMENT,

196
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,208
A CHOICE I'VE NEVER
ONCE REGRETTED.

197
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,708
THE MERE SIGHT OF THESE
PROPS AND COSTUMES,

198
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,333
NEVER FAILS TO LIFT MY SPIRITS.

199
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,500
SOMETIMES, I EVEN AMUSE
MYSELF BY RECREATING THE PLAY

200
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:48,916
AS A ONE WOMAN SHOW.

201
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,458
- I DIDN'T REALIZE IT
WAS THAT SPECIAL TO YOU.

202
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,083
OR, APPARENTLY,
THAT YOU HAD GONE

203
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,791
COMPLETELY OUT OF YOUR MIND.

204
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,208
- BAD NEWS!

205
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,916
THE TRAINS AREN'T RUNNING
TO ONIBAS STATION TODAY!

206
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,083
- HUH?

207
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,708
- THEN WE SHOULD
TRAVEL THERE IMMEDIATELY

208
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,333
TO SEE THAT WENDY AND
THE OTHERS MADE IT.

209
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,500
WELL, LUCY?

210
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:08,666
- YEAH, OKAY.
ARE YOU COMING WITH US?

211
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,250
- WHY MUST YOU INSIST
ON MEDDLING?

212
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,000
SHE CHOSE TO GO
IN SPITE OF MY ADVICE.

213
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,750
AND BESIDES THAT,

214
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,333
YOU DON'T CHOOSE
A JOB SIMPLY BECAUSE

215
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,500
IT'S FAR AWAY AND INCONVENIENT.

216
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,958
YOU CHOOSE A JOB THAT BOTH
PAYS WELL AND HONES YOUR SKILLS.

217
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,791
I'M SURE THAT THIS
ONE DOES NEITHER.

218
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,458
IT'S A COMPLETE WASTE
OF HER TIME AND ENERGY.

219
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,666
AND ALL OF OURS AS WELL.

220
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,375
- SO, WHY DID YOU CHOOSE
TO COME ALONG WITH US?

221
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,083
- I KNOW THE WAY SHE THINKS.

222
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,333
SHE'LL STUBBORNLY REFUSE

223
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,250
ANY ALTERNATE MEANS OF
TRANSPORTATION

224
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,041
AND INSIST ON WALKING THERE.

225
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,041
- IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG TRIP.

226
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,583
- Lucy: YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.

227
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,250
IT ALREADY FEELS LIKE AN
ETERNITY WITH THESE TWO.

228
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,666
- Wendy: I'M SORRY IF I'M MAKING
THIS JOB MORE DIFFICULT FOR YOU.

229
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,583
- Fried: YOU'RE MY COMRADE.
NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE.

230
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,875
- Happy: COME ON,
CAN WE PLEASE TAKE A BREAK?

231
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:59,083
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

232
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:02,208
I CAN SENSE THAT THERE'S A
THUNDERSTORM COMING PRETTY SOON.

233
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,875
- YEAH, RIGHT.
THIS WEATHER IS GORGEOUS!

234
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,125
- ( thunder rumbling )

235
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,708
- ( rain pattering )

236
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,250
- Happy: THIS
WEATHER'S HORRIBLE!

237
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:12,041
- Wendy: WE NEED TO HURRY
AND GET OUT OF THE RAIN!

238
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,875
- Fried: ( thinking ) I COULD
EASILY CREATE AN ENCHANTMENT

239
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,833
TO SHIELD US FROM THE ELEMENTS.

240
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:20,166
IT WOULD TAKE A TINY FRACTION
OF MY MAGICAL POWER TO DO SO.

241
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,708
HOWEVER, THE RULE IS TO AVOID
ASSISTING WENDY

242
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,500
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

243
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,916
BUT I AM TASKED WITH
KEEPING HER SAFE.

244
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,166
IF SHE WERE TO CATCH COLD,
I WOULD BE TO BLAME.

245
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,250
SHOULD I TAKE ACTION,
OR LEAVE HER BE?

246
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,458
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!

247
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,833
I NEED YOUR GUIDANCE, LAXUS!

248
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,708
FOR YEARS IN THE THUNDER
LEGION I FOLLOWED YOUR LEAD.

249
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,291
HOW WOULD YOU DEAL WITH THIS?

250
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,875
I NEED TO KNOW THE RULES!

251
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,916
LAXUS!

252
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,458
- MR. FRIED!

253
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:51,666
I FOUND A CAVE!

254
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,708
- OH.

255
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,208
MUCH BETTER.

256
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,083
IT SEEMS INACTION PROVED
TO BE THE CORRECT CHOICE.

257
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,250
- Happy: UM, WHAT ARE YOU
MUMBLING ABOUT?

258
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,500
- ( chuckles )

259
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:06,208
YOU NEEDN'T CONCERN
YOURSELF WITH IT, CAT.

260
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,833
- YEP, YOU SERIOUSLY
GOTTA WONDER

261
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,375
WHAT'S GOING ON IN
THAT GUY'S HEAD SOMETIMES.

262
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,750
- "IS IT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
THAT WE SQUEEZE OURSELVES

263
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,416
INTO SUCH A TINY SPACE?"

264
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,458
THE CAT INQUIRES UNCOMFORTABLY.

265
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,208
"YES, OF COURSE IT IS. BUT, IF
YOU'D RATHER GET DRENCHED,

266
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,625
BE MY GUEST."

267
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,166
THE YOUNG GIRL
REPLIES QUITE TESTILY.

268
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,750
"OHHH, I HOPE THAT ALL MY PROPS
AND COSTUMES DON'T GET WET."

269
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,291
THE LADY GROANS WORRIEDLY.

270
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,541
- Natsu: SAY WHAT? LUCY AND THEM
WENT ON THE JOB TOO?

271
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,000
- OUI. THEY DID.

272
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,625
- I GUESS THEY COULDN'T
STAND NOT BEING INVOLVED.

273
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:40,875
- HOW DID YOU MISS ALL THAT?

274
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,541
WHAT IN THE HECK
HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?

275
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:43,666
- I WAS SLEEPING.

276
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,083
ALL RIGHT, IF THEY'RE ALL GOING,

277
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,458
I DON'T SEE WHY I HAVE TO
SIT AROUND HERE ALL DAY!

278
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,041
- All: NATSU!

279
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,625
- DO YOU THINK THAT HE
KNOWS ABOUT THE TRAIN?

280
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,000
HE WON'T BE HAPPY.

281
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,750
- ( yells )

282
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,500
I DON'T WANT TO RIDE THIS THING!

283
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,083
BUT I GOTTA DO IT!

284
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,625
I GOTTA GET TO ONIBAS SOON!

285
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,375
BUT I HATE THE TRAIN SO MUCH.

286
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,291
- WE CAN'T WAIT HERE ALL DAY FOR
YOU TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND, KID.

287
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,666
WE'RE LATE ENOUGH AS IT IS!

288
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,583
- OKAY! I'LL DO IT.

289
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,000
JUST TRY TO KEEP IT
FROM SHAKING SO BAD.

290
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,833
- YOU WANT ME TO DO WHAT?

291
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,541
- Female Announcer:
ATTENTION, PASSENGERS.

292
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,125
DUE TO A WRECK ON THE TRACKS,

293
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:26,000
THIS TRAIN WILL MAKE ITS FINAL
STOP JUST BEFORE ONIBAS STATION

294
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,666
AND THEN RETURN TO MAGNOLIA.

295
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,166
I REPEAT.

296
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,875
THIS TRAIN WILL NOT BE REACHING
THE ONIBAS STATION TODAY.

297
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,791
WE DEEPLY REGRET
THIS INCONVENIENCE

298
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,333
AND APPRECIATE YOUR
COOPERATION AND UNDERSTANDING.

299
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:47,166
- Happy: AT LEAST IT FINALLY
STOPPED RAINING.

300
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,875
- Wendy: BUT IT'LL BE
GETTING DARK SOON.

301
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,791
I'M AFRAID THAT WE MIGHT
HAVE TO SLEEP OUTSIDE TONIGHT.

302
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,875
- THAT CAVE WILL SERVE
AS A SUFFICIENT PLACE

303
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,708
TO REST FOR THE EVENING.

304
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,125
THOUGH THERE IS THE
ISSUE OF PROVISIONS.

305
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,083
- IT'S NOT CHEATING TO HELP
US FIND FOOD, YOU KNOW.

306
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,333
EVEN MASTER WOULD SAY IT'S
A HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUE.

307
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,791
- YES, OF COURSE.

308
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,208
I AM FULLY COGNIZANT OF
WHAT MY OBLIGATIONS ON THIS

309
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:10,083
PARTICULAR MISSION MAY OR
MAY NOT REQUIRE ME TO DO.

310
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,208
- COULD YOU USE ANY MORE
WORDS IN THAT SENTENCE?

311
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:15,041
- I'VE ALREADY DETERMINED
THE BEST SOURCE OF NUTRITION.

312
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,125
IN FACT, I'VE TAKEN
STEPS TO PROCURE IT.

313
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,333
- WOW, REALLY?

314
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,291
- THIS GUY MAY BE SUPER WEIRD,

315
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,750
BUT I GUESS THERE WAS A GOOD
REASON MASTER SENT HIM WITH US.

316
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,250
- WITHIN THE BOUNDS
OF THIS ENCHANTMENT,

317
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,583
WINGFISH SHALL
FALL FROM THE SKY!

318
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,458
- WHY IS IT GOTTA BE WINGFISH?

319
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,791
- Fried: THEIR ANNUAL
MIGRATORY PATH

320
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,875
FLOWS DIRECTLY OVER THIS REGION.

321
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,083
THEY COME HERE IN FLOCKS
AT THIS TIME EVERY YEAR

322
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,583
TO FIND A MATE AND SPAWN.

323
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,750
- ARE THESE REALLY EVEN EDIBLE?

324
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:44,916
- MM-MM.

325
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT
THEY'RE "EDIBLE."

326
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,583
I CAUGHT SOME ONCE

327
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,041
AND IT WAS THE GROSSEST THING
I'VE EVER TASTED IN MY LIFE.

328
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,833
- NO DOUBT AN ASSERTION
MADE BY AN AMATEUR.

329
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,708
THE FLAW LIES NOT WITH THE
FISH, BUT THE PREPARATION.

330
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:59,666
BRINGING OUT THEIR NATURAL
FLAVOR, TAKES SKILL.

331
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,333
( grunts )

332
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,041
- OH, WHAT A NICE SURPRISE.

333
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,000
I HAD NO IDEA YOU'RE
GOOD AT COOKING!

334
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,333
I'M NOT ONE TO BOAST,

335
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:14,791
BUT MY COMRADES IN
THE THUNDER LEGION

336
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,416
ENJOYED MY OCCASIONAL DISHES.

337
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,500
AND YOU MIGHT, TOO.

338
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,333
- THAT LOOKS SO GOOD!

339
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,708
- PRESENTATION IS
VERY IMPORTANT.

340
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,166
NOW, I HOPE YOU ENJOY
THE FLAVOR AS WELL.

341
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,500
- THANKS FOR THE FOOD!

342
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:41,833
- THAT'S IT, TASTED EXACTLY
THE SAME WHEN I MADE IT.

343
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,333
- I THINK I SAW SOME NUTS
AND BERRIES OVER THERE.

344
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:47,333
- LET'S PICK SOME OF THOSE.
- AYE.

345
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:50,666
- HM, NUTRITION MUST
ALWAYS TRUMP FLAVOR.

346
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,666
WE WIZARDS MUST KEEP
OUR STRENGTH AT ANY COST.

347
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:04,208
- AND WE'RE SURE THAT THIS
IS OUR ONLY CHOICE FOR FOOD?

348
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:07,000
- WHY ELSE DO YOU THINK
WE'RE EATING THIS?

349
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,333
- Carla: A PERFECT EXAMPLE
OF WHY I DIDN'T WANT TO COME

350
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,833
IN THE FIRST PLACE!

351
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,291
- Female Announcer: ATTENTION.

352
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,791
THE ONIBAS-MAGNOLIA
TRAIN IS NOW ARRIVING

353
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,375
AND WILL BE DEPARTING FOR
THE RETURN JOURNEY SOON.

354
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,000
WE APPRECIATE
YOUR UNDERSTANDING,

355
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:24,208
AND HOPE YOUR JOURNEY
IS SAFE AND COMFORTABLE.

356
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,500
- SIR! PLEASE, YOU
HAVE TO GET UP!

357
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,083
WE'RE DEPARTING AGAIN!

358
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,958
YOU'VE BEEN RIDING THIS TRAIN
BACK AND FORTH SINCE YESTERDAY!

359
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,750
YOU CAN'T STAY ON FOREVER!

360
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,500
- ( groaning )

361
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:39,875
- Happy: GREAT, OUT OF THE
MOUNTAINS AND INTO THE DESERT!

362
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,875
- Wendy: YOU DON'T SEEM TO BE
BOTHERED BY THE HEAT, MR. FRIED.

363
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,250
- HE'S PROBABLY USING SOME KIND
OF SPELL TO COOL HIMSELF DOWN.

364
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,208
- NO, I WOULD NEVER DENY
MY COMRADES COMFORT

365
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,125
TO CLAIM IT ALL FOR MY OWN.

366
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,791
IT'S SIMPLY MIND OVER MATTER.

367
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,250
- HOT. OH, SO HOT.

368
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,916
- HAPPY!

369
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,583
HOLD ON, YOU'LL FEEL
BETTER REAL SOON, OKAY?

370
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:05,291
- SHE KNOWS THAT SPELL
WILL DRAIN HER MAGIC ENERGY.

371
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,916
BUT SHE IS SO KINDHEARTED,
SHE DOESN'T HESITATE.

372
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,208
HER CONCERN FOR OTHERS IS MUCH
GREATER THAN THAT FOR HERSELF.

373
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,083
PLEASE, STOP!

374
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,166
YOU NEEDN'T DEPLETE YOUR POWER.

375
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,125
ALLOW ME TO ASSIST HIM.

376
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,833
- DO YOU KNOW HEALING MAGIC?

377
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
- FIRST, WE LAY HIM
PRONE ON THIS ROCK.

378
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,708
THEN, I INSCRIBE
THE ENCHANTMENT.

379
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,708
THOSE WITHIN THE BOUNDS
OF THIS ENCHANTMENT,

380
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,875
SHALL NOT BE AFFECTED BY HEAT!

381
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:42,291
- I REALLY HOPED I WAS NEVER
GONNA GET COOKED AGAIN.

382
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,291
- THE RESULTS OF AN
ENCHANTMENT SUCH AS THIS

383
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,125
ARE NOT ALWAYS IMMEDIATE.

384
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,625
- AND ONCE HE LEAVES IT, ISN'T
HE JUST GONNA GET

385
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:49,833
BURNED UP AGAIN?

386
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,041
- I'M FRIED.

387
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,791
- Lucy: WE'RE STILL GOING
THE RIGHT WAY, AREN'T WE?

388
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,708
- Carla: UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IS
HOW YOU GET THERE ON FOOT!

389
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,041
- STAY BACK!

390
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,333
- ERZA!

391
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,333
- Fried: WE SHOULDN'T HAVE
MUCH FARTHER TO GO.

392
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,250
DON'T LOSE HEART.

393
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,541
- Wendy: THERE'S A STORM COMING!

394
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,416
- OH, NO! YOU MEAN A SAND STORM?

395
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,708
- Fried: THIS DESERT IS KNOWN
FOR ITS "CURSED SANDSTORMS!"

396
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,083
- Happy: WHAT?

397
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,875
WE GOTTA FIND A PLACE TO HIDE!

398
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,958
- THERE IS NO PLACE TO
HIDE IN THIS TERRAIN.

399
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,083
RUN!

400
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:28,500
- I'M TRYING,
BUT I'M STILL SINKING.

401
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,416
- Carla: CAN'T YOU DO
SOMETHING TO HELP?

402
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,500
- Lucy: I KNOW!

403
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,875
- YOU WANT TO
PUNISH ME? PRINCESS?

404
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,458
- OH, COME ON!
I NEED YOU TO HELP ERZA!

405
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:39,500
- AS YOU WISH.

406
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,291
- ( rattling )

407
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,958
- PRINCESS, IT SEEMS SHE'S
TOO HEAVY FOR ME TO MOVE.

408
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,458
- I AM NOT!

409
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,875
- NO WAY, NOT EVEN A CELESTIAL
SPIRIT CAN GET HER OUT?

410
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,166
- Wendy: HEY, LUCY!

411
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,500
OH, AND CARLA, YOU CAME TOO?

412
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,916
- ( scoffs )

413
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,916
- Lucy: WE CAME BECAUSE WE
WERE WORRIED ABOUT YOU,

414
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,750
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
DOING BETTER THAN WE ARE.

415
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,583
- Happy: ERZA! WHAT ARE YOU
DOING DOWN THERE?

416
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,750
- YEAH, ABOUT THAT.

417
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,333
- Fried: SHE'S STUCK.

418
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:11,291
PLUS, THAT CURSED SANDSTORM
CONTINUES TO BEAR DOWN ON US.

419
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,375
- HUH?

420
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,625
- ( roaring )

421
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:15,833
- ( Lucy screaming )

422
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,375
- SAVE YOURSELVES AND
GO ON WITHOUT ME!

423
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,833
- Lucy: DON'T GIVE UP, VIRGO!

424
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,208
- THIS WEIGHT IS
QUITE PERPLEXING.

425
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,000
IT'S NOT UNLIKE A GIANT
MASS OF ROCK OR IRON.

426
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,875
- WHAT IS IT?

427
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,458
MAYBE IT'S HER ARMOR
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

428
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,375
SHE'S CARRYING AROUND WITH HER?

429
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,791
- I'M STILL HOLDING ON TO
THE PROPS AND COSTUMES.

430
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,000
- WHAT?

431
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,041
- ALL THAT STUFF
MUST WEIGH A TON!

432
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:39,333
- I KNOW, BUT THE SHOW
CAN'T GO ON WITHOUT THEM.

433
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,166
- WE'RE NOT EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE
PUTTING ON A PLAY THIS TIME!

434
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,708
- FAREWELL, DEAR FRIENDS.

435
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,208
I WILL ALWAYS TREASURE
OUR TIME TOGETHER.

436
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,583
THEY'RE GONE.

437
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,458
AND A PIECE OF MY
HEART GOES WITH THEM!

438
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,583
- BE GLAD YOU'RE ALIVE
TO DIG 'EM UP LATER!

439
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,041
- SHALL I PUNISH HER?

440
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,250
- ( roaring )

441
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,416
- Carla: IT'S TOO LATE!
THE STORM'S RIGHT OVER US!

442
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,250
- Fried: IF WE GET CAUGHT IN ITS
GRIP, WE WILL NEVER ESCAPE IT!

443
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,000
- ( Lucy whimpering )

444
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,208
- DON'T BE AFRAID!

445
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,333
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT!

446
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,833
- WENDY, NO!

447
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:15,791
- SKY DRAGON ROAR!

448
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,000
- ( roaring )

449
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,291
( groaning )

450
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,958
- Fried: SHE DID IT.
THE STORM'S DISAPPEARED.

451
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,416
- OH, YEAH!

452
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,583
- THAT WAS AWESOME! WOO-HOO!

453
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:34,875
- ( laughing sheepishly )

454
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:36,583
- HM.

455
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,666
- OH, THANK YOU!

456
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,041
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

457
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,833
- HIS SPIRITS
DON'T SEEM CRUSHED.

458
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,208
- THE ACTORS AND MYSELF
HAVE ALL KISSED AND MADE UP!

459
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,958
THE PLAY HAS EVEN OPENED
TO A SOLD OUT AUDIENCE!

460
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,458
STANDING ROOM ONLY!

461
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,000
THANK YOU ALL SO VERY MUCH!

462
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,500
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

463
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,375
WE RISKED OUR LIVES
TRYING TO GET HERE

464
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,000
AND YOU DON'T NEED US?

465
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:07,416
- I WORKED LIKE A DOG
TO DIG THESE THINGS UP!

466
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,583
- THAT'S IT, I GIVE UP.

467
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:17,750
- ALL THOSE DREADFUL WINGFISH I
ATE ARE FINALLY GETTING TO ME.

468
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,333
I THINK I'M GOING TO BE SICK.

469
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,041
I AM!

470
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,333
I CAN'T STAND UP ANYMORE.

471
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,458

THE DANG TRACKS.

00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,333
SO I'M HERE NOW.

475
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:36,625
UGH, I MUST HAVE RIDDEN THAT
STUPID, SHAKY, TRAIN

478
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:42,916

00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,166
- HE'S NOT HAPPY ANYMORE!

480
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,083
- LOITERING IN FRONT OF MY
THEATRE IS BAD FOR BUSINESS!

481
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,166
YOU THERE!

482
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,708

483
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:53,208
- Lavian: PLEASE REMOVE THESE
VAGRANTS FROM MY PROPERTY.

484
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,875
I'M AWARE THAT THIS IS A VERY
BIG JOB, BUT I'LL PAY YOU.

485
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:57,916

( sighs )

487
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:09,750
MY FIRST BIG JOB IS
KICKING OUT MY FRIENDS.

488
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,333

493
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:21,083
