Huh?

Finally!

Yuri! Warrod! I can
see land up ahead!

I'm super excited to be
in a real city, aren't you?

00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,958
All the people, and
the shops, and the food!

Oh, I can't wait!

Well, you're gonna have to.

[MAVIS] After being on Tenrou
Island for all our lives,

14
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:07,458
Zera and I finally
visited our first city.

15
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:09,916
The bustling port of Hargeon!

16
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,208
Hey, Warrod, what are
you doing over there?

17
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,791
I'm mooring the ship
with a bowline knot.

18
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,125
[MAVIS]
And what does that mean?

19
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,541
I'm just tying the ship
up with this loop here

20
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,125
so it doesn't drift away.

21
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,458
Gotta get it nice and tight!

22
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,125
It makes sense.
Looks pretty secure to me!

23
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,875
I've read a couple
of books about boats,

24
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,625
but I supposed they only
focused on what happens

25
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,625
while they're out on the water
so that's why I'm asking.

26
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,125
So can you tie knots like that?

27
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,375
That's his thing.

28
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:16,000
[WARROD] Ha! Does that
answer your question?

29
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,208
Should I not have
asked him about that?

30
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,666
He obviously can't do it.

31
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,208
Oh, I guess that's a "no" then.

About being first off the boat.

tying it to the dock?

[MAVIS Ooh! He's
carrying a lot of fish!

he's a fisherman, Mavis.

all this neat stuff with me?

There's nothing here you
haven't read about before.

Reading about the world
and being in it

83
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,458
are two different things.

84

That's one of the main
reasons we left the island!

And that's why I like
to get out now and then.

[PRECHT]
What? How?

162
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,375
Like this. You're in my face.

163
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,625
[chuckles]

164
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,208
[BOY B]
Mommy! I'm scared!

165
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:29,958
[MOTHER grumbles]

166
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,541
[PRECHT]
Good grief.

167
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,916
Do you have a reason for cutting
down that tree all of a sudden?

168
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
[PRECHT]
Well--

169
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,208
[MAN D]
Hey! What's wrong with you?

170
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,333
Just who in the hell
do you think you are?

171
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,833
[MAN G] You better
explain yourself, pal!

172
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,291
[gasps]

173
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,166
[PRECHT]
The screw on that wheel,

174
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,250
it's dangerously loose.

175
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,416
[MAVIS]
Huh?

176
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,041
Whoa!

177
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,375
Hey, buddy, do you mind not
blocking the roadway here?

178
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,958
[PRECHT]
You need to check your wheel.

179
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:06,541
Say what? What are
you talking about?

180
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,583
Your wheel! The back one
has a loose screw.

181
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:10,458
Huh?

182
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,583
Yeah, it's about to fall off.

183
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:12,708
Really?

184
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,500
Hang on. Let me
tighten it up for you.

185
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,250
[PRECHT sighs]

186
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,833
[MAVIS chuckles]

187
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,833
You just saved the day!
Nicely done!

188
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,583
[WOMAN B]
Excuse me.

189
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,375
Are you feeling okay, sir?

190
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,875
You just walked in
front of that wagon,

191
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,375
so I just wanted to make
sure you're all right.

192
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,416
[PRECHT]
Yes, I'm fine.

193
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:38,750
[PRECHT]
Huh?

194
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,750
[PRECHT]
Look out, miss!

195
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,000
[ALL gasping]

196
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,291

[gasping]

198
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:55,375
What do you think you're doing?!

199
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,291
Ugh! Creepy pervert! How rude!

200
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,250
[DRIVER A]
Hey, you!

201
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,666
You know you
shouldn't be walking

202
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,333
in the middle of the street.

203
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:05,916
You weren't tryin' to cause
an accident, were you?

204
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,375
[PRECHT] No, I--
I was trying to help.

205
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,791
You seem to have attracted
a lot of attention to yourself.

206
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,916
And not in a good way.
Unfortunately.

207
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,750
[PRECHT]
It happens all the time.

208
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,000
You shouldn't let it
get you down, though.

209
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,875
I mean, you really didn't do
anything wrong, did you?

210
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,375
Of course not. And I
don't need consoling.

211
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,250
I'm not trying to console you!

212
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,666
All I'm doing is
just telling you

213
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,541
what I think about
what just happened.

214
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,041
You strike me as
the type of person

215
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,666
who's misunderstood a lot.

216
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,875
But that's only because you're
more honest than most people.

217
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:55,125
And so, they can be easily
intimidated by the way you are.

218
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,541
Everything you do is guided by
your personal code of honor.

219
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:01,041
I guess that must be a fairly
rare character trait

220
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,250
in the world today.

221
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,041
So there's nothing to be
ashamed or scared of.

222
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,666
You should be proud and
hold your head high.

223
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:13,125
Well, that's what I read in
a book about personalities.

224
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,666
Seeing how you carry yourself
and how people react to you

225
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,458
just made me think of it.

226
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,916
Uh-oh. It's that boy.

227
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,041
I've been looking
for you to say thanks!

228
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:33,541
That tree you cut down,
it was rotten on the inside.

229
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,791
So thanks! That could've
fallen and hurt somebody bad.

230
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,375
You saved us!

231
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:41,458
[PRECHT] I see.
So it was rotten after all.

232
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:42,708
Oh, yeah.

233
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,500
One of the grownups said
it was super dangerous.

234
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:48,250
I apologize. Sorry
we were rude to you.

235
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,625
[MOTHER B] Please wait!
I'd love to repay you.

236
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,458
[PRECHT]
That's not necessary.

237
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,541
Actually, there is something.

238
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,291
We're looking for a guild.

239
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,833
A guild?

240
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,083
I know! There's a
bar across town.

241
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,166
Somebody there might
be able to help you.

242
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,000
It's pro'ly worth
a shot, at least.

243
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,083
How do you know
about some bar?

244
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,541
That old man that lives
across the street told me.

245
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,791
He said that a lot of
bad guys hang out there,

246
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,333
so I should stay away.

247
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,416
And the bartender's
really weird,

248
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,791
but he knows a ton of people.

249
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,125
That sounds like a
pretty good lead to me.

250
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,166
[PRECHT]
Yeah.

251
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,708
Thanks so much
for all your help!

[PATRONS gasping]

254
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:23,333
Ah. Okay. So this is
what a real bar is like.

255
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:27,833
Do they all smell like this one?
It has a very peculiar odor.

256
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,958
Oh, yeah? Is that so?

257
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,875
Wait. I didn't mean
anything bad.

258
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,750
No kids allowed, pal.

259
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,791
You wanna drink, you'll have
to leave the rugrat outside.

260
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,666
Yes, but we're
not here to drink.

261
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,291
We actually just came to
chat with the bartender.

262
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:48,416
Hear that? She just came
for the conversation.

263
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,458
Well, friend, who are ya?

264
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,583
[PRECHT] The name's Precht.
I'm a treasure hunter.

265
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,625
Yeah? A grave robber, huh?

266
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,000
So what kinda business
could you have at my bar?

267
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:02,750
And speakin' of "business,"
that's what this bar is, ya dig?

268
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,791
[PRECHT]
Then pour me a drink.

269
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,250
Neat or on the rocks?

270
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,791
[PRECHT]
Rocks.

271
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,583
Word on the street is that you
know a whole lot of people.

272
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:11,916
[BARTENDER]
That I do.

273
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,833
Comes with the territory,
I suppose. What of it?

274
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,875
[PRECHT] We're looking for
a guild named Blue Skull.

275
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,250
Sound familiar?

276
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,375
Blue Skull, eh? Sorry, pal.

277
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,291
Haven't heard of a guild with
that name around these parts.

278
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,625
Can't help ya.

279
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,666
[PRECHT] Come on.
Just think a little harder.

280
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,208
You'll have to ask someone else.

281
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,208
[PRECHT]
I find it extremely surprising

282
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,375
that you've never even
heard it mentioned.

283
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,875
[BARTENDER] There's a lot
of new wizard guilds

284
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,500
with crazy names, but that
one ain't ringin' any bells.

[MAVIS] No, thanks.
We're here for information.

Well, I ain't got any.
So you two hit the bricks.

289
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,416
Maybe you'd have better luck

290

Let's get out of here.

294
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,708
[MAVIS]
Wait a second.

295
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,166
If you've never heard of them,

296
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,500
how did you know that Blue
Skull is a wizard guild?

297
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,833
There are a lot of different
types of guilds out there.

298
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,458
There's fighting guilds,
commercial guilds,

299
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:20,833
all kinds of them, really.

300
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:26,750
Yet, you specifically identified
Blue Skull as a wizard guild.

301
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,916
So that would lead me to believe
that you do know about it.

302
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,583
Yeah, well, lucky guess.

00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:34,125
[PRECHT]
A magic circle!

319
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:37,458
[chuckling]

320
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:43,500
Do you see his tattoo?
That's Blue Skull's guild mark!

321
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,625
[PRECHT]
So he was a member after all.

322
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,375
I knew he was lying.

323
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,083
Damn you!

324
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,833
[BARTENDER] You better
stay right where you are!

325
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:58,041
[BARTENDER] If you set one foot
outside that magic circle,

326
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,583
we'll be cleanin' ya
off the ceiling.

327
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,166
You shoulda done your homework.
Blue Skull is a dark guild.

328
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,291
We don't take regular jobs
like those other losers.

329
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,541
Since that's the case,

330
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,791
we need somebody to hang
out at the shady spots

331
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,541
to find out about all
of the shady gigs

332
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,375
that the others are
too scared to take on.

333
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,958
[BARTENDER] So I'm here to
collect information myself.

334
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,958
[PRECHT] You mean you're
just an underling?

335
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,291
That's right.

336
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,375
Wait a sec, I ain't takin'
any insults from you!

337
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,541
[PRECHT] Um, what exactly
are you doing down there?

338
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,750
[MAVIS]
Hmm.

339
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:33,750
I think this character
is used incorrectly!

340
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,208
This is supposed to be
a barrier enchantment.

341
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:39,500
It's made up of characters
from the Lezon alphabet.

342
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,750
But this one doesn't
fit in with the rest.

343
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,333
It is pretty close, though.

344
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:45,041
That means...

345
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,166
[PRECHT]
Hey! Stop!

346
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,125
[MAVIS]
This magic circle doesn't work!

347
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:53,458
So you can step outside it
without a care in the world!

348
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,500
Why, you! Little brat!

349
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:56,708
I didn't tell you earlier,

350
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,625
but I happen to know
about magic too!

351
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,041
[PRECHT]
You can use magic?

352
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,750
Yes, indeed. I studied it
for seven years straight.

353
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:08,291
Wanna see? I'll show you
one of my favorite spells.

354
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:12,583
Come forth, ancient and sacred
guardian beast from the heavens!

355
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,166
[MAVIS]
Tenrou!

356
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:29,875
[screams]

357
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,791
[BARTENDER whimpering]

358
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:38,708
Now are you going to tell us
where we can find Blue Skull?

359
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,333
You should.

360
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,125
Uh! Yes, ma'am!

361
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,375
[PRECHT]
That was an illusion?

362
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:56,916
Oh, yeah!

363
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,416
[PRECHT] You mean that giant
creature was just a giant bluff?

364
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,083
That's the kind of magic I use!

365
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:08,000
All we have to do
is combine our powers

366
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,916
and we can reach our goal!

367
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
The Tenrou Orb is
practically in our hands!

368
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,125
Now we know the
enemy's location!

369
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,708
A city to the west of here!

370
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,708
Let's go to Magnolia!

371
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,583
Oh! I can't wait
to tell the others!

372
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:26,041
[PRECHT] Be careful
running around like that!

373
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:33,125
--[thud]
--[MAVIS] Owie!

374
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:35,833
[PRECHT] You see! I told you
to be careful, didn't I?

375
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:38,125
[MAVIS] I don't know!
I wasn't listening!

376
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,333
[MAVIS] Our group embarks
on a trek to Magnolia

377
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:17,708
to find Blue Skull's
base of operations.

378
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,041
It's a long walk,

379
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,083
so we stop to camp in
the forest for the night.

380
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,625
While we get some
much-needed rest,

381
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:25,291
we sit around the campfire
next to the shore of a lake.

382
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:27,541
We share food and stories
of the adventures

383
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,875
that our treasure hunter friends
have gone on together.

384
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,250
And how those experiences

385
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:34,500
have strengthened the bonds
of their friendship.

386
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:37,750
Next Time: "Moonlit Lake."

387
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:40,541
Friendship is a strong
yet gentle thing.
