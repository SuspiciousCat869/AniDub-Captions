1
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:22,500
It's likely... you've not
heard of Fairy Heart.

2
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:23,833
For many years,

3
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:26,583
it's been our guild's most
closely guarded secret.

4
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,083
For good reason.

5
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:32,208
Because the world must never
learn exactly what it holds.

6
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:35,708
However, I believe it's
crucial that you know

7
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:39,291
why Zeref would go to
such lengths to get it.

8
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:43,791
And also, about my own sin.

9
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:47,416
It's time for my long-held
secrets to be revealed.

10
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:53,166
[MAVIS] This is a tale
of a boy and girl.

11
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,041
Of the awful curse they shared,

12
00:00:56,125 --> 00:01:00,666
and the primordial magic...
that they sought together.

13
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:37,333
[MAVIS] My story takes
place over 100 years ago.

14
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:40,916
Not long before Fairy
Tail was founded.

15
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,291
We crossed paths in a
forest west of Magnolia,

16
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:47,708
where both our fates
were forever changed.

17
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,583
He was stricken by
the Curse of Ankhselam.

18
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,208
Against his will,
this horrible curse

19
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:56,166
killed every living
thing around him.

20
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,916
[MAVIS] I found him to be
completely fascinating.

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,041
He taught me so much
about the world of magic.

22
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,541
At the time,
Magnolia was controlled

23
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,166
by a dark guild
called Blue Skull.

24
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,125
They treated the citizens
with such cruelty.

25
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:17,375
So my friends and I learned
magic to win the city's freedom.

26
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:20,041
Just when things were at
their most desperate,

27
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,458
I cast an unperfected
black magic spell

28
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,625
that brought us victory.

29
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:27,250
Because I wasn't ready
to wield that spell,

30
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,833
there was an unintended
consequence.

31
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,500
My body would cease growing.

32
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:38,208
[MAVIS] A short time after,
in April of 686,

33
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:41,666
we founded Fairy Tail.

34
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,541
Trade disputes between feudal
lords had been escalating

35
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,416
at an alarming pace.

36
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,958
And later that year,

37
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:52,333
the bloody Second Trade War
began tearing the kingdom apart.

38
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:06,708
[explosions]

39
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,833
[MAVIS]
Hmm.

40
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,791
Have the left flank
pull back, please.

41
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,083
[SOLDIER A]
Uh. What?

42
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,916
Little girl, are you insane?

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,666
They're within striking distance
of the enemy's weakest point!

44
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,125
[SOLDIER A]
Now is the time to attack!

45
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,541
[SOLDIER B]
Look, you may be a wizard,

46
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,708
but you are out of your league
here on the battlefield!

47
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,875
[MAVIS]
If I were the enemy,

48
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,958
I would set up a small
ambush squad near this hill,

49
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,375
then lure in the opposition
and loose that squad upon them.

50
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:41,208
At the same time,
I'd send reinforcements west

51
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,125
to attack our main
battalion here.

52
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,125
[BOTH]
Huh?

53
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:50,083
I can formulate 49 effective
countermeasures at the moment,

54
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,583
but first, we need to pull
back that left flank.

55
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,416
They'll join the battalion
in an echelon formation,

56
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,166
and then we all watch for
the enemy's next maneuver.

57
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,625
Look at the princess
bossin' 'em around.

58
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,250
I'd argue she's more like
a general than a princess.

59
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:08,333
Seriously. You'd never guess
she was a military genius.

60
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,125
Are you ready?

61
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,833
[MAVIS]
This is Yuri Dreyar.

62
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:15,625
Master Makarov's father-to-be.

63
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:16,916
Precht Gaebolg.

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,291
My pick to be the
guild's second master.

65
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,250
But after he goes down
a path of black magic,

66
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,416
he becomes the leader
of Grimoire Heart.

67
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,125
And this is Warrod Sequen.

68
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,416
He'll one day be recognized

69
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,375
as the fourth-highest
ranked Wizard Saint.

70
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:33,250
So, is our wizard squad
gonna get the chance

71
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,958
to join in the action?

72
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,833
I'll need you to keep the
enemy's wizard squads at bay.

73
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:41,875
And it's very likely they'll be
getting back up from the west.

74
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,541
Be careful.

75
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,708
Let's go tear it up, you guys!

76
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,708
Ready to show 'em
what we can do?

77
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:52,166
[FAIRY TAIL yelling]

78
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,000
I have faith in you!

79
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,208
[SOLDIER A]
Hold on a second.

80
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,750
Is that Fairy Tail's
munchkin master?

81
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,250
[SOLDIER B]
I think she's a real fairy.

82
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,666
[thunder booms]

83
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,000
[WIZARD A]
Hm? Is there a storm coming?

84
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:06,833
[WIZARD B]
What the--?

85
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:07,833
[WIZARD C]
An enemy wizard!

86
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,250
[WIZARD D]
What guild is he from?

87
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,166
Fairy Tail says hello.

88
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,291
[SOLDIER A]
Whoa!

89
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,291
[SOLDIER B]
That's incredible!

90
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:22,291
Boom! And with that,
my score goes up to 27!

91
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,916
Still behind me, Yuri!

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,416
I've already taken out
34 and counting!

93
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,125
I'm at 100 and something!

94
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:31,166
Ha! I'm just kiddin'
with ya, fellas!

95
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,208
[SOLDIER A]
They came in way outnumbered,

96
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,583
but somehow, still
managed to win easily.

97
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:51,458
[SOLDIER B]
That girl is a fairy tactician.

98
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,833
[MEMBER B]
Woo! We did it, you guys!

99
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,750
[MEMBER C]
Look at all this gold!

100
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,583
[MEMBER D]
Now this calls for good wine!

101
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,208
[MEMBER A, WARROD]
Cheers!

102
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,750
[FAIRY TAIL]
Cheers!

103
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,125
You look kinda glum.
Something wrong?

104
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,041
[MAVIS] I was thinking
about the battle today.

105
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:20,166
It's mind boggling how many
lives must've been lost.

106
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,541
[gasps]

107
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,666
This war is brutal.

108
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,541
How long do you suppose
until it's all over?

109
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,458
I just wanna go on
another adventure.

110
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,250
[MAVIS] The Second Trade War
finally came to an end

111
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,541
in the year 690.

112
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,416
While the cease-fire was
a welcome development,

113
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,833
the resulting casualties
were over ten times

114
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,958
that of the First Trade War.

115
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,625
Most people believed
the high rate of mortality

116
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:56,166
was due to the wizard guilds'
involvement in the fighting.

117
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,666
As a result, the wizarding
world came together

118
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,125
and the Inter-Guild Conflict
Ban Treaty was signed.

119
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,875
This monumental agreement

120
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:08,166
brought about a brief period
of peace in the land.

121
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:21,916
[MAVIS]
A few years later, in 696...

122
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,875
[gasps]

123
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,291
[MAVIS] ...I had another
chance encounter with him

124
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,208
while walking
through the forest.

125
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:29,916
[ZEREF]
Hm?

126
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,916
Is that you, Mavis?

127
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,083
Oh my gosh! It's so
good to see you again!

128
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:35,916
Yay!

129
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,583
[ZEREF]
Wait! Stay back!

130
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,125
You shouldn't get close to me!

131
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,041
I-I'm cursed, remember?

132
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,208
[MAVIS]
I know!

133
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,666
What are you--?

134
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,166
I wanna thank you.

135
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,791
We were able to drive that
dark guild out of Magnolia.

136
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,958
And it's all because
of your help!

137
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:59,166
We saved the town with
what you taught us.

138
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,333
[MAVIS]
Hold on a minute!

139
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:07,666
You're actually the Black
Wizard Zeref? For real?

140
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,041
[ZEREF] That's why I
didn't want to tell you

141
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,208
my name back then.

142
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:14,125
[MAVIS] I've heard that you've
been alive for over 300 years.

143
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,291
Is that true?

144
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,583
It is.

145
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,666
Wow. I rarely think about
how long it's been.

146
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,041
I must say,

147
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,125
you're nothing like the
rumors paint you out to be.

148
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,208
Well, what do
they say about me?

149
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,750
The bad stuff's likely
true for the most part.

150
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,166
Why would you say
something like that?

151
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,416
I mean, your eyes have such a
kind and gentle quality to them.

152
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,416
I refuse to believe there's
a bad person in there.

153
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,958
You only say that
because you're so innocent.

154
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,500
[MAVIS gasps]

155
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:46,958
[MAVIS]
Do you remember Yuri?

156
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,875
That hot-blooded friend of mine?

157
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,583
Well, he and his wife are about

[ZEREF] But he's practically
still a child himself.

159
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,708
[MAVIS] You do realize
it has been ten years

160
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,166

162
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,708
I suppose I had forgotten,

163
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,541
considering how little
you've changed since then.

164

Oh, because I still
look the same.

165
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,791
You're right. I guess
that is confusing.

166
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,375
I should tell you
that to win the battle,

167
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:14,083
I cast an incomplete
black magic spell.

168
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,625
But it was the only way
I could save my friends,

169
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,208
so it was worth it in the end.

Don't tell me you
used the Law spell!

You won't ever grow old or die!

[MAVIS]
What?

184
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,916
You made a judgement
on who lives and dies.

185
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,916
That's the purpose of the spell.

186
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,916
Now you have the
Curse of Ankhselam,

187
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
which means, the more value
that you place on life...

188
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,458
...the more death
will follow you.

[MAVIS]
That's not true!

'Cause... that hasn't happened.

Nobody just dies around
me, so it can't be.

I don't have that curse.

Perhaps that's the case
for the time being.

194
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,791
But think about this.

195
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,791
That war that went on
must've affected you.

196
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,583
War tends to dull
a person's feelings

concerning life and death.

198

I can imagine that your

There's love here.

I want my child to feel that
from everyone in the guild.

could you do the honor

What? Wait, you mean me?

their inhuman strength

can end my life of suffering.

But of course,
it hasn't worked yet.

time building a country.

318
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,625
[MAVIS]
A country?

319
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,250
It's a small place on the
western continent now,

320
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,708
but we're growing rapidly

321
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,250
because people will
do things for me.

322
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,500
It's a fun little challenge.

323
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:47,083
In fact, I'm known as
Emperor Spriggan over there.

324
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,541
I view my subjects
as mere pawns.

325
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,208
Don't judge.
It's safer that way.

326
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,541
With that attitude,

327
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,041
the Curse of Ankhselam
won't affect them at all.

328
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:59,166
It's like an intricate
simulation game.

329
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,916
What are you trying to do?

330
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,291
I guess I'm getting
ready for something.

331
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,833
A war?

332
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:09,041
But don't get the wrong
idea. I detest conflict.

333
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:13,375
In fact, I think it's
absolutely revolting.

334
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:16,083
Me building this empire is
just a way to pass the time,

335
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,166
but it disgusts me.

336
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,000
I wouldn't call it "fun."

337
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,375
Huh?

338
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,958
But you just said it
was a "fun challenge."

339
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:28,500
Did I? I don't remember.

340
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,666
[MAVIS] Are all his thoughts
contradictions too?

341
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,458
My entire life is wrapped
up in this game now.

342
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,250
I only live so I can die.

343
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:39,291
Or... to get my little
brother back... maybe...

344
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,666
...just so I can kill him.

345
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,666
Or... is it so my little
brother can kill me?

346
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,875
All this... it makes my head
feel like it's on fire.

347
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,500
[MAVIS]
Zeref.

348
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,583
[ZEREF]
The world... hates me.

349
00:19:56,666 --> 00:20:00,083
It continually rejects me.

350
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,333
Everything hurts.

351
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,083
I won't reject you, Zeref.

352
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,541
I accept who you are.

353
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,541
[ZEREF gasps]

354
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,416
[MAVIS]
I may be the only one,

355
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,083
but I understand how you feel.

356
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,125
You can't give up.

357
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:27,500
I know we'll find a way to
lift the curse someday.

358
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:31,208
Together. Just you and I.

359
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,458
Do you mean that?

360
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,166
[MAVIS]
Yes!

361
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,666
[ZEREF]
Oh, Mavis.

362
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,666
[ZEREF]
This is the first time

363
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,750
anyone's ever been
truly kind to me.

364
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:52,958
[MAVIS]
Come on.

365
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,416
[ZEREF]
Huh?

366
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,250
You've probably forgotten
what it's like, that's all.

367
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:04,250
I know that I've never felt
this way about anybody before.

368
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:22,333
[MAVIS] The Abyss of Sorcery,
where everything begins.

369
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,958
[MAVIS] It contains the
primordial essence of magic:

370
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,375
Love.

371
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,833
Love brings about miracles.

372
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:36,625
And oftentimes, tragedies.

373
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:41,208
The two who carried the Curse of
Contradiction shared their love,

374
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:45,000
and the result was yet
another contradiction.

375
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:53,625
[MAVIS] The more love you have,
the more life this curse takes.

376
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,375
[MAVIS]
Such a bitter contradiction

377
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:03,375
is what took my immortal life.

378
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,541
[LUCY] Mavis and Zeref
created their own miracle.

379
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,458
It would evolve into
an incredibly powerful

380
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:45,166
form of magic that must
remain hidden to the world.

381
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:48,083
The family she built is
determined to cheer her up.

382
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,208
To help her let go of
the shame she feels,

383
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:52,166
we share our love with her.

384
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,666
Meanwhile, across
the deep blue ocean,

385
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,333
the Alvarez Empire
continues with their plan,

386
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:59,958
steadily preparing for
an assault on Ishgar.

387
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:01,833
Next time: "Fairy Heart."

388
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:03,291
The deep bond we
have with each other

389
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,791
is our constant
source of strength.
