[JUVIA humming]

2
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,500
[JUVIA] You appreciate
a well-groomed woman.

3
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:32,333
Don't you, darling?
Of course you do.

4
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:38,791
[JUVIA humming]

5
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:45,166
I'll see you soon, Gray my love.

6
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:18,166
[giggles]

7
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,250
[WENDY] Good morning,
Juvia! How are you?

8
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,500
[JUVIA] I'm great!
Good morning to you, too!

9
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,625
You're looking
exceptionally chipper.

10
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,875
You must've had some
amazing dreams.

11
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:31,375
I don't remember any.
But this is a special day.

12
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,166
I met my Gray 413 days ago.

13
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,833
It's been that long since my
love saved me from the rain.

14
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,333
[HAPPY]
413 Days.

15
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,083
Four hundred thirteen
sounds like a big number

16
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,875
but it's nothing compared to the
amount of hours and seconds.

17
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,875
Time does fly when
you're in love!

18
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,041
[WENDY, ERZA, CARLA groan]

19
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,666
[CARLA] You're celebrating
your 413th day?

20
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,708
[JUVIA]
Oh, yes!

21
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,708
That's an odd
number to focus on.

22
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:01,166
Does 4-13 have some sort of
special significance to you?

23
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,000
Like maybe you two met
each other on April 13th!

24
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,666
Wow, this really is a
special day. That's so cute!

25
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,666
Yes, it would be. But no.

26
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,333
It's just what I said it is, the
413th day since Gray and I met,

27
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,541
fought, and fell madly in love.

28
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,041
So then, what was yesterday?

29
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,541
It was our 412th day
anniversary, obviously!

30
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:19,625
[WENDY]
Then tomorrow--?

31
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,666
Is gonna be our
414th day anniversary!

32
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,333
Every day's our
anniversary, see?

33
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,208
--[CARLA groans]
--[WENDY laughs]

34
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,875
[ERZA]
Carpe diem!

35
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,375
I learned this invigorating
phrase from Levy recently.

36
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,208
It means seize the day!

37
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,416
I admire those words.

38
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,958
And can see that
you live by them!

39
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,500
Well, when you put it like that.

40
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,125
It really is important that we
take the time to appreciate

41
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,583
the things we love,
every single day.

42
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,166
I suppose so,
but for some of us

43
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,083
there's only one thing.

44
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,958
Well, yeah! Life is great.
And it's all thanks

45
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,458
to that frosty fox
named Gray Fullbuster!

46
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,166
Why wait a year to
celebrate the bounty

47
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,166
right before you?
May today's jubilee

48
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,958
be trumped only by tomorrow's!

49
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,833
You took the words
straight from my heart!

50
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,583
Erza has such a mature
perspective on this stuff.

51
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,958
Are we listening to
the same girl right now?

52
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,375
So tell us, how do you
plan to celebrate?

53
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,875
Oh, I'm not.

54
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,500
I haven't exactly told Gray
about our anniversaries yet.

55
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,500
I just plan to be happy.

56
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:14,583
That won't do!

57
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,416
Holidays are meant
to be celebrated!

58
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,625
At the very least you
should give the boy a gift

59
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,375
to mark the occasion!

60
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,625
Juvie!

61
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,125
[JUVIA] For you, darling.
It's to mark our anniversary.

62
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:30,250
Oh, wow! It's amazing,
just like you!

63
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,375
My lovely bride!

64
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,458
Darling!

65
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,083
[CARLA, WENDY]
That escalated quickly!

66
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,166
A token of my appreciation!

67
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,333
That's a great idea,
I'll try it!

68
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:40,583
This is bad!

69
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,333
I have no idea what kind
of present he'd want!

70
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,125
It's all so sudden.
I can't think!

71
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,875
Do try not to hurt yourself.
This isn't life or death.

72
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,333
Are you sure though?

73
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,375
You have no reason
to fret, Juvia.

74
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,958
Choosing a gift is quite easy.

75
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,208
Just find something that'll
make the giftee happy.

76
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,708
Well if that's the case,
what kind of gifts

77
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:56,833
would make you happy?

78
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,166
Weapons and armor
of glistening steel!

79
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,250
[gasps]

80
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:05,291
[GRAY] Woah! These are
almost as amazing as you!

81
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,416
My lovely bride!

82
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,916
Darling!

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,041
Can't quite place it, but
something seems a bit off here.

84
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,583
Armor would make a
great gift for you,

85
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:15,416
but I dunno about Gray.
He likes to strip too much.

86
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,041
That's where you take issue?

87
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,041
Armor is tough to remove,
so that's the last thing

88
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,291
I'd wanna give my future
husband. What do you suggest?

89
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,958
Uh. Well, actually.

90
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,833
I'm kinda the worst
person you could ask.

91
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,166
I've never given
something to a boy.

92
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,250
What about you, Carl--?

93
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,166
[CARLA]
That cloud looks like a rabbit.

94
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,750
[WENDY]
Pay attention!

95
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,208
Why don't you ask other
girls like Laki and Levy?

96
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,500
I did see Cana back
in the dining room.

97
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,083
Yeah, I mean we all
live together so there's

98
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,666
plenty of people you can ask.

99
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,500
It'd be a waste not to find out
what everyone else has to say!

100
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,750
I could take a poll.

101
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:48,083
All right. Great idea!
I think I'll try it!

102
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,416
[JUVIA] It's really amazing what
you've done with your room.

103
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,166
Looks like half
a library in here!

104
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,375
It's more of a practical thing
than a decorating choice,

105
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,916
but thanks.
What can I do for ya?

106
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,833
Well, I've decided to get
a present for someone,

107
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,333
but I want it to be perfect.

108
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,666
So if you could have any gift,
then what would you want?

109
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,875
Books.

110
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,666
Studying these ancient
tomes, I rarely have

111
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,708
as many reference
materials as I need.

112
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,083
If ya gave me an encyclopedia

113
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:14,458
on the history
of Boscoe, I'd swoon!

114
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,458
[sighs]

115
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,666
I'm sorry but I
just can't decide.

116
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,625
Between wine and liquor!

117
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:23,291
Somehow that
doesn't surprise me.

118
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,708
Are you seriously
drinking wine this early?

119
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,500
Yeah, I might've nabbed a bottle
from the kitchen cellar.

120
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,291
Keep your mouth shut
and you can have some.

121
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,250
Oh, thanks.
I'd love to, but I think

122
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,791
I'd better get back to
this whole present thing.

123
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,041
Well This is a "special" room.

124
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,375
And here I thought Levy's
place was different.

125
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:41,958
[LAKI] If you're after an
offering that'll make men

126
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,458
thrash about in the feels,
then look no further.

127
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,375
In my experience,
life's greatest pleasures

128
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,500
bear the tint of pain.

129
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,333
I'm not sure I agree.

130
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,458
[LAKI] It takes an open mind
to please your man.

131
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:52,916
With a piece like
this in the mix,

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,416
the possibilities are endless.

133
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,083
Okay then! You've given me
quite a lot to think about.

134
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,125
So, I'm gonna go now.

135
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:05,208
[sighs] I'm at a total loss.

136
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,791
There's gotta be
someone around here

137
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,500
that can give me
some decent advice.

138
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,250
[door creaks]

139
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,416
[JUVIA]
Evergreen! Hey!

140
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,791
Uh.

141
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,166
You're this worked up over
picking out a present?

142
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,916
Aw, it's like you're
a little girl!

143
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,416
Exactly!

144
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,500
And you seem way more mature
than most of the girls here.

145
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:22,583
So I thought that you'd be

146
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,291
the perfect person
to ask about this.

147
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,333
You thought right. So.

148
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,750
You now realize that however
good she may be with a sword,

149
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,708
Erza's woefully inexperienced
when it comes to

150
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:34,458
the ways of romance.
Luckily for you, I'm an expert.

151
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:35,916
Teach me, master!

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,958
Ask me anything.
The sky's the limit!

153
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,166
I'll help you turn
your man into putty.

154
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,375
Anything, huh?

155
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,166
Well, what I really
wanna know is how to get

156
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,416
the guy that I like to marry me!

157
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,750
Marry you?

158
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,333
[EVERGREEN]
I've been wondering, Elfman.

159
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,666
What would you like
our first baby to be?

160
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,625
A lady or a man?

161
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:58,083
You know what I want.
A little lady.

162
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,666
What the heck! You're
supposed to say a "man"!

163
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,708
Wow. That thought
escalated quickly.

164
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,083
Um. Are you okay?

165
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,916
Well, uh, actually!

166
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,458
If you wanna know what a guy
is thinking, you should probably

167
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,208
talk to one of them!

168
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,875
Because If you ask a girl,
she'll just tell you

169
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,250
what she's into.

170
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,541
Hey, good idea!

171
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,250
I knew you'd have good advice.
Thanks so much!

172
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,041
I'll give that a try!

173
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,916
What kinda present
would you like?

174
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,291
I'd wanna get more food!

175
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,166
More specifically, fish!

176
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,541
I don't think that
a gift of fish

177
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,541
would please my darling Gray
as much as it would you.

178
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,666
Everyone loves fish.
Trust me!

179
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,916
The key is that you give
him a stupid amount of it,

180
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,416
like enough for five people!

181
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,958
Just 'cause your life
revolves around food

182
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,541
doesn't mean his does.

183
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,291
What kind of presents would
you guys like to recieve?

184
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,250
What, if I could
choose from anything?

185
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,041
Lemme think.

186
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,291
I'd want a man!

187
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,541
[JUVIA sighs]

188
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,166
He is so clueless.

189
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,458
I'd take a white suit
and a slick guitar.

190
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,916
Toss me a red rose to
bite into, and we're good.

191
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,458
Juvia. Let's make babies!

192
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:05,958
Darling!

193
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:09,000
Gray would look incredibly
dashing with a set-up like that.

194
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:12,833
[LUCY] Yeah, Debonair rock-star
isn't really Gray's style.

195
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,708
Forget the guitar.
He needs some clothes!

196
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,708
What kind though?

197
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:22,333
Juvia. Will you take me...

198
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,333
Gray Fullbuster,
to be your husband?

199
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,583
Both in sickness and in health?

200
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,708
Will you love me, and honor me?

201
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,458
I swear. I'll do the same.

202
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,625
[GRAYS]
We're ready.

203
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,333
All you have to do
is pick your favorite.

204
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,750
I can't pick one.

205
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:40,125
I'll just have to marry
all five of you!

206
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,333
[JUVIA sighs]

207
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,625
Looks like Juvia's off
in Gray-land again.

208
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,041
You should make him something.
Give him a gift you put

209
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,416
yourself into and he'll
know it's from the heart.

210
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,916
Make him something?

211
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,500
You wanna show how
you feel, right?

212
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,916
Nothin' says "love"
like a handmade gift.

213
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,583
How d'ya handmake a man?

214
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,666
That doesn't make any sense.

215
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,500
Yeah, but a handmade guitar?

216
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,041
Think I might be pretty
into somethin' like that.

217
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,750
[LUCY] Can you guys
keep it down, please?

218
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,416
She's confused enough as it is.

219
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,041
[NATSU] Know what's
always handmade? Food!

220
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,375
[LUCY] Will you stop
yammering about food?

221
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,541
[gasps]

222
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,375
I think he may
be onto something.

223
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,541
Remember that cake
Erza made the other day?

224
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,041
I dunno about you,
but it sure made me happy.

225
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:21,958
Cool, I'll just bake him a cake.

226
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,708
Think you can make
one by yourself?

227
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,291
Well, yeah. How hard can it be?

228
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,208
It's just a big pastry!

229
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,833
And don't forget to save
a couple bites for us, okay?

230
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:30,916
Out of the question!

231
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,333
I intend to spoon-feed
him every bite!

232
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,583
[HAPPY, NATSU groan]

233
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,041
Seize the cake!

234

[DOLL GRAY squeaks]

235
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,875
[JUVIA]
Just you wait, Gray, darling!

236
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,000
I'll have you
buttered up in no time!

237
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,833
First, place one cup sugar
and three eggs into a bowl,

238
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,791
then whisk into a froth.

239
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,291
[giggles]

240
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,416
That's odd. Why isn't
it all frothy yet?

[gasps]

244
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:13,208
[JUVIA sighs] I couldn't even
get the dumb thing started.

245
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:16,833
If you had been here
to see my failure...

246
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,958
I can't believe you're
such a crappy cook.

247
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,958
What an complete disappointment.

248
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:25,083
[JUVIA gasps] Please!
Just give me one more chance!

249
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,875
[GRAY] We could've spent our
lives together, but not now.

250
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,875
[JUVIA]
I'm begging you, don't leave!

251
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,000
I'll never let that happen!
But what can I do?

252
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,500
Love overcomes all barriers!

253
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,833
Even total incompetence!

254
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,333
There has to be
something, come on!

255
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,166
Just think! I figured it out!

256
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,750
Sure I suck with a
whisk, but I've got

257
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,958
other talents
I can use for this!

[WENDY, CARLA, LUCY gasp]

266
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,291
[LUCY] Why'd we let

00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,833
I hope she's okay!

Ah! It wasn't easy,
but I did it!

271
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,458
[CARLA, WENDY, LUCY] Yeah, I
wouldn't be so sure about that.

272
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,958
Really? So then,
where did I go wrong?

273
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,083
[LUCY] I guess the good news
is that anyone could see

274
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,791
you worked
really hard on it.

275
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,166
[WENDY] The bad news is you
spelled lovely with an "r".

So bad.

tastes delicious!

[WENDY]
So sour!

Whoa.

282
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,791
[JUVIA]
I didn't use any ingredients

283
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,791
that weren't in the cookbook.

284
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,166
[CARLA] You've got a
special kind of talent then.

285
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,500
Color me impressed.

286
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,125
[JUVIA]
What do I do now?

287
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,416
I could always try to cook
something else, I guess.

288
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,625
Please don't.

289
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:57,875
I'm not sure if the
kitchen could endure.

Tell you what, we'll fix
things up around here.

291

You just focus on coming up

00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,166
with another gift idea,
that sound okay?

293
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,541
But I'm back where I started.
Totally clueless.

294
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,625
Why don't you go back
to the clothes thing?

295
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,958
Try something simple,
like an accessory.

296
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,875
Ah! Thank you, Carla!
Think I'll give it a try!

I've got a really good
feeling about it this time!

So cute!

Oh! Juvia!

302
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,625
You'd be as generous as you are
talented if that were possible!

It was my love for you that
inspired me to evolve, darling!

304
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:40,083
Juvia 2.0 wasn't worthy of you,
but I've had an update!

So modern and yet so enchanting!

when he's beaten.

I really did it!

And this time it's
perfect for sure!

here comes love!

a little bit late now.

00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,291
[LUCY]
You're like a wild animal.

316
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,708
[NATSU]
I just can't resist it!

317
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You've been crammin' your
face for like an hour.

318
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,166
[NATSU]
Yup, and I'm not gonna stop

319
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,916
till there's somethin'
else to do.

320
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,666
Well, that was weird.

321
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,583
[JUVIA]
No way!

322
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,083
You're the manliest
man I've ever seen.

323
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,208
How else could I win
a woman like you?

324
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,583
[HAPPY]
Let's ditch this joint and find

325
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,000
a quiet place to cuddle.

326
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,291
[CARLA]
Sure thing.

327
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:34,583
Let's feed each other
fish somewhere private.

328
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,958
[chattering]

329
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,541
Oh. Hey, Juvia!

330
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:40,833
How's the present coming?

331
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,458
What'd you end up
deciding to make?

332
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:46,333
Well, I, uh, I knitted a scarf.

333
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:49,708
[JUVIA] Crap. These fantasies of
mine are getting out of hand.

334
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,083
Ya didn't go with the
guitar, eh? Too bad.

335
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,833
Hey, listen: Gray hasn't
been around here today.

336
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,583
He's prob'ly just layin'
around at home then.

337
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,000
Yeah, I bet you're right.

338
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:02,375
I'll go check on him there!
Wish me luck, okay?

339
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,166
Those clouds look like
they're ready to storm soon.

340
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,083
Guess I'd better
make this quick.

341
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,041
[JUVIA]
Oh, hello, Lyon!

342
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,416
[LYON] Juvia, were on your
way to Gray's house?

343
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,166
[JUVIA]
Yes, I am. Were you just there?

344
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,250
[LYON]
Kind of. I was...

345
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:23,291
...popping in for a quick visit.
But he isn't there.

346
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,625
He isn't?

347
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,041
[LYON]
You needed to see him?

348
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,291
I do.

349
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,500
Today is Gray and I's
anniversary, sort of,

350
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,541
so I made him a present,
all by myself.

351
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:33,958
Anniversary.

352
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,041
[JUVIA]
But if he's not home,

353
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,375
then I'll just have
to look around!

354
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,541
Thanks for letting
me know. See ya later!

355
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,250
Yes. But Juvia--!

356
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,708
[JUVIA]
Hm...

357
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:58,083
[gasps] Gray, darling!

358
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,791
I was looking everywhere!

359
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:03,791
Nobody's seen you.
Where have you been all day?

360
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:07,041
Uh. Just felt like
takin' a long walk.

361
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,916
[JUVIA]
This is for you!

362
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,125
[JUVIA]
I was knitting in a rush,

363
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,541
so it didn't turn out very good.

364
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,958
But I'd be honored if you
wore it! Here, please!

365
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,583
[GRAY] You should get home
before it starts storming.

366
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,791
[gasps] Wait!

367
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,041
What the hell?

368
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,708
I knitted a scarf for you.
Won't you wear it?

369
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:27,833
I don't do scarves.

370
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,708
Come on, it's a cute accessory!

371
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,458
I don't accessorize either.

372
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,833
But it's gonna get cold out,
look at those clouds!

373
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,208
So what? I'm an
ice wizard, all right?

374
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,750
The cold doesn't even affect me.

375
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:42,125
[JUVIA]
Juvie!

376
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,625
[JUVIA gasps]

377
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,041
[GRAY sighs]

378
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:51,416
[JUVIA] Please, Gray. Today...
It's the anniversary.

379
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
[gasps]

380
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,125
[JUVIA]
You don't have to wear it.

381
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,625
But I want you to keep it.
As a memento!

382
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:58,625
Of what?

383
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,208
A memento of our anniversary.

384
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,416
It's been 413 days
since we first met.

385
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,041
Don't you remember?

386
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,791
[GRAY]
That's crazy, even for you.

387
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,250
What am I s'posed to say?

388
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,583
I'd start with
"happy anniversary"!

389
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:13,208
Any day can be special
if it makes you happy.

390
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:16,041
[GRAY]
Sorry. Not this one.

391
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,458
So you found him.

392
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,208
[JUVIA]
Yes, I did.

393
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,500
[JUVIA sobbing]

394
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:41,583
[ERZA]
This isn't like you.

395
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:45,875
You're too upbeat for tears.
What happened?

396
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,458
I'm the worst!

397
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:51,375
If I'd known I wouldn't've done
it, you gotta believe me, Erza!

398
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,208
[JUVIA]
She died today?

399
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,458
Yes. Years ago, on this day,

400
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:00,250
Gray's master gave
her life to save him.

401
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,541
[gasps]

402
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,166
[LYON] For tonight at least,
just let him be.

403
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,875
[JUVIA] The anniversary of
the saddest day of his life.

404
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:20,000
And I tried to make
it about myself.

405
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,333
I feel like such
a selfish fool.

406
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:25,291
And there's no way to fix it.

407
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,166
I'm the one who pushed
you towards this.

408
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,041
That makes me the fool.

409
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:33,166
Nice try. But I know
it's all my fault.

410
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,875
[ERZA] To be honest, I doubt
that Gray's upset with you.

411
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,333
[JUVIA]
Why wouldn't he be?

412
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,833
I chased him down
and harassed him

413
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,833
on the day his master died.

414
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,708
It's only a date though.

415
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,375
[ERZA] Every time one
passes, countless lives

416
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,000
are lost and born.

417
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,791
Every date is someone's
anniversary for something,

418
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,291
good or bad.

419
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,500
But no matter what today
meant for you last year,

420
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,875
it's whatever you
make of it now.

421
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,500
You took this day and made
the most you could with it.

422
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,041
Gray needed to see that.

423
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,583
[gasps]

424
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,291
You really mean it.

425
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:18,125
[JUVIA sobs]

426
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,166
[ERZA]
There, there. You're okay.

427
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,166
[GRAY gasps]

428
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,625
[UR]
You boys look cold.

429
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,416
Here, this oughta
warm you up a little bit.

430
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,625
[gasps]

431
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:03,125
[panting]

432
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:17,625
[GRAY grunting]

433
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:35,541
[GRAY] Wow! This scarf
is friggin' warm.

434
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,125
I owe you an apology.

435
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:55,208
Lyon told me about what
happened, and I just--

436
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,041
Don't do that. I was a jerk.

437
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,833
I should apologize to you.

438
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:00,958
I'm sorry.

439
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,958
[JUVIA] I wanna make
up for my mistake.

440
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:05,583
So I made you this body pillow!

441
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:06,708
Here, do whatever
you want with it!

442
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,125
[GRAY]
No way!

443
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,541
[JUVIA]
It's also in commemoration

444
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,666
of our 414th day anniversary,

445
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,125
so you know, it'd be
pretty rude not to take it!

446
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,125
[GRAY] Seriously! That thing's
creepy, take it back!

447
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,541
[JUVIA]
Creepy?

448
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,208
Then what kind of present
do you want me to get you?

449
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,625
I'm tellin' ya, food!

450
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:21,500
I'll keep sayin' it!

451
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:22,708
Fish! Fish! Fish!

452
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,541
Na, get him somethin'
that has grit!

453
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,375
Oh, I'll show ya grit!

454
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:27,750
Now I'm wondering.

455
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:30,083
What is Gray supposed to do
with that kinda pillow?

456
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,083
[LUCY]
How would I know? Ask Erza!

457
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:35,500
Never a calm moment.
Never a dull one either though.

458
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:37,291
Guess things are just
the way I like them.

459
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,625
That's right!

460
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,458
If you get bored, then you
just need to try harder!

461
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:41,500
[laughs]

462
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,708
[HAPPY] Brr! What's the deal
with this blizzard, Natsu?

463
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:17,625
It's gonna turn me
into a cat-sickle!

464
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,333
[NATSU]
Give it a rest, ya big wimp!

465
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,000
[HAPPY] This seriously
doesn't bother you?

466
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:22,250
[NATSU]
I'm a fire wizard, dude!

467
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,000
It's like havin' a furnace
where-ever ya go.

468
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:25,458
[HAPPY]
I am way past jealous.

469
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:27,041
[NATSU] Yeah, plus I've
never caught a cold!

470
