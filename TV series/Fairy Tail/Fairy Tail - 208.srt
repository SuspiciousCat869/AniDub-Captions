You guys!

169
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,416
How in the heck
did you find us?

170
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,666
These monsters haven't
hurt you, have they?

171
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,041
We're fine.

172
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,916
[TAURUS] What an udderly
unfortunate turn of events.

173
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,166
This totally sucks, man!

174
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,750
It's infuriating.

175
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,166
[LOKE grunts]

176
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,291
[CANA] You guys can
thank Warren for this.

177
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,333
[LUCY]
He found us?

178
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,625
[HAPPY]
What a cool guy!

179
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:38,875
[MIRAJANE]
Yeah.

180
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,375
He was able to use his
telepathy to track you.

181
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,375
So all of us followed
the signal up the mountain

182
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:44,291
and into the fog.

183
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,208
I'll be sure to
thank him later!

184
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,833
You can do something nice
for him when you get home!

185
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,750
Can't say I'd want to
read anyone's mind,

186
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,375
but it comes in handy.

187
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,958
[ERZA] So this is
the Astral Spiritus?

188
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,458
And the Liberam
was not done?

189
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,041
That's right.

190
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,416
[GAJEEL] Heh, heh. I've always
wanted to go a couple of rounds

191
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,333
with some celestial spirits!

192
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:05,458
[PANTHERLILY]
That's great,

193
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,125
but we didn't come
here to fight them.

194
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,750
Yeah, I know that!
I'm just saying!

195
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,208
This ain't a freebie.

196
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,291
You're going to owe me big
time for saving your butt.

197
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,333
I thought you were
just being a bro!

198
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,625
Oh my bold,
bare-chested, brawler!

199
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,750
I'm all ready for you Loke,
so step up and get some!

200
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,541
Do you really have to say
that after you strip down?

201

[LOKE] If you really wanna
stop us, follow us in!

206
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:52,208
We'll show you just how far
we'll go for true freedom!

207
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,583
Loke!

208
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,625
Where're they goin'?

209
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,208
[HISUI]
No, wait!

210
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,333
Why?

211
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,791
I will give a key
to each one of you.

212
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,250
[HISUI]
By using them,

213
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,250
you will be able to close
the spirits' gates by force.

214
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:19,750
This is the only hope
we have to stop them now.

215
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,250
Then give me Loke's!

216
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,000
Please, let me deal with him.

217
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,791
I know you mean well, Lucy,

218
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,041
but there is no way
he's gonna listen to you.

219
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,041
But this might just
change his mind.

220
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,291
I know that he's lost his way.

221
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,125
But he's still my friend,
so don't take it too far.

222
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,916
[NATSU]
I won't, I swear.

223
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,166
Take this.
It's the lion's key.

224
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,875
We're in the rift between
our world and theirs.

225
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:45,041
It's uncharted territory.
So please be careful.

226
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,333
I will.
Let's go, Happy!

Aye, Sir!

Thank you, Princess.

00:12:56,875 --> 00:13:00,291
I give you my solemn word
that we will not let you down.

230
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,791
We can't afford to fail.

00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,375
Alright, are you ready?

232

[LUCY]
There you are!

238
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,375
[VIRGO]
It is you.

239
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:59,916
But it's hardly a surprise.

240
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,458
I had a very strong feeling

241
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:05,208
that you would be the one to
come for me, Lucy Heartfilia.

242
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,000
[ERZA]
Is this some kind of joke?

243
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,625
[SAGITTARIUS]
I've recreated a battle scene,

244
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,416
reminiscent of days long past.

245
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,583
Is that so?

246
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,416
[ERZA]
These are just paper-mache.

247
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,208
[SAGITTARIUS]
I'm a firm believer in creating

248
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:29,958
an appropriate atmosphere.

249
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,333
Best two out of three takes it.

Balance is essential.

Between our kind and yours.

254
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,583
I'm sorry.

255
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:53,666
But I don't understand
what you mean by that.

Battle coliseum, open.

Huh? What the hell is this?

258
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,750
[SCORPIO] I hear that you're
quite skilled with cards.

259
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,541
So how about the two of
us play a little game?

260
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,083
[CANA]
What?

261
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,958
[SCORPIO]
We'll begin with six cards each.

262
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,833
[CANA]
Sounds fun, but...

263
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:13,625
[SCORPIO]

Fine, here I go.

00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,500
So are you ready
to duel with me?

271
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,166
[CANA]
Wait a sec!

272
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,333
Why don't you tell me
the rules first?

273
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,166
[SCORPIO]
I am the rules.

274
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,833
That doesn't make any sense!

275

Not what I was expecting!

Alright let's do this!

[CANCER] I thought the

So let's get down and
set this floor on fire!

[CAPRICORN] We're about

What contest?

291
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:35,875
[CAPRICORN]
A quiz!

292
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,708
Worthy of a Zodiac Spirit!

293
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:39,958
A game show?

294
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,125
[CAPRICORN]
I suppose.

295
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,875
Each contestant
will be presented

296
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,625
with a series of questions
they must answer.

297

There are ten in all.

Once the final score is tallied,

299
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,333
the winner will then be
granted complete freedom.

300
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,583
And the loser will suffer
a truly horrible fate.

301
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,416
Oh... I don't like
the sound of that.

302

But why are we playing
a trivia game?

303
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,541
Well, because I'm rather
fond of them, that's why.

304
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,083
Now then.

321
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:01,625
Aw. Let's play!

322
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:08,166
[MIRAJANE] This is definitely
nicer than I expected.

323
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,083
Hm?

324
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,375
[MIRAJANE groans]

325
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,333
[MIRAJANE gasps]

326
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:21,000
[PISCES MOM] Very good!
You're a great swimmer!

327
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,583
[PISCES BOY]
What's up, girl?

328
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,791
Come on. Let's have
some fun in the water!

329
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,625
If you're looking for us,
we're over here!

330
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,500
It's hide and go seek!

331
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,750
We didn't come here to play
silly children's games!

332
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,416
[GAJEEL]
Especially not with these two

333
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,791
annoying little rugrats.

334
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,083
[GEMI]
Piri, piri.

335
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,125
These guys aren't
any fun at all.

336
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,833
[MINI]
Yeah, they're really boring.

337
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:44,833
[BOTH gasp]

338
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,666
[GEMI, MINI]
Piri, piri, pikkiri!

339
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,541
[BOTH grunt]

340
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,500
It's blinding me!

341
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,833
Well, I gotta say, this
seems like an excellent spot

342
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,000
for a little man on man action!

343
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,583
[TAURUS]
Moo.

344
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:07,916
You should know, referring to
me as a man is a big mistake.

345
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,416
Well, whatever you are,

346
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,416
I came here to school
you on your manners,

347
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,541
so let's get to it.

348
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:16,083
[TAURUS] Indeed,
we shall make this quick.

349
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:19,458
I have a quite a few things
I need to do today.

350
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:22,291
[ELFMAN yells]

351
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,250
[ELFMAN]
Hey. What gives?

352
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,791
I can't land a hit!

353
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:31,041
[TAURUS] Moo. It would seem
your muscles are just for show.

354
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,333
Oh, so that's what
you think, is it?

355
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:36,125
In that case, let me
give you a show!

356
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,291
[ELFMAN]
Beast Soul!

357
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,708
[TAURUS] First, you talk
about being a man,

358
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,833
then you turn into
a filthy animal?

359
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,500
You're nothing
but a talking cow!

360
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,583
[ELFMAN growls]

361
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,791
[TAURUS]
Change into whatever you like,

362
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,833
it will make no difference.

363
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,791
[ELFMAN growls]

364
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,083
[ELFMAN yells]

365
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,958
[TAURUS] Now, let me have
some peace and quiet.

366
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,541
[ELFMAN] You think
you can just ignore me,

367
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,291
and read your little book?

368
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,958
Well, I'll just have
to knock that thing

369
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,791
right outta your hooves, pal!

370
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,541
[TAURUS]
Moo.

371
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:20,083
It's no wonder a dullard like
you would attack a book.

372
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,375
[ELFMAN groans]

373
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,125
[TAURUS] Your low
intelligence is reflected

374
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,375
in your fighting style.
That's why you revert

375
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,541
to beastly forms. You can't
expect to win that way.

376
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,750
It's just all brawn
with no brains.

377
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:34,333
Perhaps you can inscribe
that on your tombstone.

378
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,708
[TAURUS]
Moo.

379
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,291
What a farce.

380
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,458
We've got serious beef now.

381
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,166
[TAURUS]
Moo!

382
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:01,416
[TAURUS]
Moo?

383
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,083
[ELFMAN growls]

384
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,833
[TAURUS whimpers]

385
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:09,833
[ELFMAN]
Huh?

386
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,041
[TAURUS]
How completely disgusting!

387
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,208
So unclean!

388
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:15,166
And it's all over my
nicely pressed suit!

389
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,916
Huh? My sweat.

390
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,291
[TAURUS] It's revolting.
And it smells so foul!

391
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,875
That's the sweat of a man!

392
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,625
Now taste it, cow!

393
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,083
[TAURUS moaning]
I think I'm gonna be sick!

394
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,708
Eat this!

395
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,166
[TAURUS]
Moo!

396
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,875
[ELFMAN grunts]

397
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,041
[TAURUS whimpers]

398
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,166
[ELFMAN laughs]

399
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:49,291
[TAURUS] Moo! No moore!
I can't take any moore of this!

400
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,125
So get lost!

401
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,416
[TAURUS]
No! You're forcing my gate!

402
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,958
Moo!

403
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,541
Oh, boy.

404
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:16,041
But that got the job
done. Manly style!

405
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,916
[ARCADIOS] It seems the bull
was the first to fall.

406
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,500
[HISUI]
Wonderful!

407
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:24,000
I was confident that Fairy Tail
would never let us down.

408
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:30,416
Now 11 remain.

409
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,583
Good luck.
We're counting on you.

410
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,000
[NATSU grunts]

411
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,416
[HAPPY] They get to go
to an amusement park?

412
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,666
No fair!

413
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,041
[NATSU] It makes me sick
just thinkin' about it.

414
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:18,416
[HAPPY]
Yeah, you can't go on rides

415
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,666
without tossing
your cookies, huh?

416
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,291
[NATSU retches] Oh man,
I'm so going to hurl.

417
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,958
[HAPPY] Wait a second, I can
use my hypnosis to cure you!

418
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:25,375
[NATSU]
You can really do that?

419
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:28,291
[HAPPY] You're not gonna barf.
You're not gonna barf.

420
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,375
[NATSU]
What do you know? It's work--!

421
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:31,791
Never mind.

422
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:33,125
[HAPPY]
I tried!

423
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:35,041
[NATSU and HAPPY]
Next time: Wendy vs. Aquarius.

424
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:37,291
Let's Have Fun in
the Amusement Park!

425
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,791
[HAPPY] You'd think
your little pea brain

426
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:40,041
would be easy to hypnotize.

427
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:41,833
[NATSU] You don't
have to be so mean.
