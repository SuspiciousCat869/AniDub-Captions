1
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:19,916
- Natsu:
PREVIOUSLY, ON "FAIRY TAIL"...

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,958
- Happy: THE S-CLASS WIZARD
PROMOTION TRIAL FINALLY BEGUN.

3
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:25,125
IN THE FIRST ROUND, EACH TEAM
HAD TO CHOOSE A ROUTE

4
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:27,041
WHERE THEY'D HAVE TO FIGHT
ANOTHER COMPETING TEAM

5
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,916
OR AN S-CLASS WIZARD.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,583
UNFORTUNATELY,
NATSU ENDED UP WITH GILDARTS.

7
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:34,333
- YEAH, HE'S JUST LUCKY I WENT
EASY ON HIM, YOU KNOW? (laughs)

8
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,833
- THAT WAS CONVINCING.

9
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:39,125
- ( theme music playing )

10
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

11
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,541
- TENROU ISLAND
IS JUST UP AHEAD.

12
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,875
- DO YOU THINK MASTER MAKAROV
WILL BE ANGRY WITH US

13
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,458
FOR FOLLOWING THEM HERE?

14
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:20,375
- I DOUBT THAT HE'LL BE ANGRY.
WE'RE JUST TAKING A LOOK AROUND.

15
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,083
- I ASSUME WE'RE HERE BECAUSE
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT WENDY.

16
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:25,875
- SHE KNEW I WAS FIRMLY
AGAINST THE IDEA,

17
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:32,416
BUT SHE WENT
AND DID IT ANYWAY.

18
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,708
- Lucy: MEST!

19
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:43,083
- A WEEK'S PASSED BUT I REMEMBER
IT LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.

20
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,416
- SKY MAIDEN.

21
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,958
- AND YOU ARE?

22
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,958
MY NAME'S MEST GRYDER,
AND I WAS ONCE MYSTOGAN'S PUPIL.

23
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,708
- SERIOUSLY?
I HAD NO IDEA.

24
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,125
I'M SURPRISED MYSTOGAN NEVER
MENTIONED ME

25
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:12,500
'CAUSE HE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT YOU.
- EXCUSE ME, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,916
- I JUST WANT TO KNOW
WHAT FRESH SNOW TASTES LIKE

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,375
DON'T MIND ME, WENDY.

28
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:19,291
- OKAY.
- HE'S SO ODD.

29
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,250
- I KNOW WE JUST MET,
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP.

30
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,708
- IF YOU'RE GOING TO
ASK HER FOR HELP,

31
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,333
YOU COULD AT LEAST
LOOK HER IN THE EYES.

32
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:28,250
- SORRY.  I TEND TO GET
DISTRACTED WHENEVER I WANT

33
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,083
TO KNOW ABOUT SOMETHING.

34
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,666
IT'S A REALLY BAD HABIT,
BUT I CAN'T SEEM TO BREAK IT.

35
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,875
PLEASE, WENDY.

36
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,916
PLEASE SAY YOU'LL HELP ME.

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,625
WITH YOU BY MY SIDE, I KNOW
I'LL BECOME AN S-CLASS WIZARD.

38
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,666
SO WILL YOU DO IT?
WILL YOU HELP ME?

39
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,333
- ME?  BUT, MEST,
I'M NOT THAT STRONG.

40
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:48,833
- THE ANSWER IS OBVIOUSLY NO.
- HMM.

41
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,583
I HAD TO DO IT.

42
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,458
I HAD TO KNOW WHAT IT FEELS
LIKE TO FLOAT IN A RIVER

43
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,458
IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER.

44
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,541
- I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO
PARTNER WITH THIS CRETIN, WENDY.

45
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:59,583
- HE'S WEIRD, BUT HE DOESN'T
SEEM LIKE HE'S A BAD PERSON.

46
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,208
- HOW DO YOU FIGURE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

47
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:05,791
I JUST FEEL LIKE I JUST SHOULD
HELP HIM FOR MYSTOGAN'S SAKE.

48
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,208
HE DID SO MUCH FOR ME
AND I NEVER GOT TO REPAY HIM.

49
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,916
- BUT YOU'VE DONE MORE
THAN ENOUGH, CHILD.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,500
YOU HELPED SAVE EDOLAS.

51
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,875
- ONLY BECAUSE THE OTHERS
WERE THERE WITH ME

52
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,125
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
ON MY OWN.

53
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,750
I FEEL LIKE I OWE HIM
SO MUCH MORE.

54
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,875
- NO, DON'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT IT.

55
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,541
SO IN THE END,
SHE IGNORED ME.

56
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,708
CLAIMING SHE NEEDED
TO HELP MEST IN ORDER

57
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,750
TO REPAY HER DEBT
TO MYSTOGAN.

58
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,166
- AND THAT'S THE REASON
THE TWO OF YOU DIDN'T SPEAK

59
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,083
TO EACH OTHER
FOR AN ENTIRE WEEK?

60
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,083
- SHE'S MORE STUBBORN
THAN SHE LOOKS, LILY.

61
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,291
- SAME GOES FOR YOU.
- IN ALL HONESTY,

62
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,500
I COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT HER
TEAMING UP WITH THAT CREEP MEST.

63
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,208
IT'S THE TRIAL ITSELF
THAT HAS ME ON EDGE.

64
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,833
I'VE GOT A REALLY
BAD FEELING ABOUT IT.

65
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,166
- DO YOU THINK IT'S
YOUR CLAIRVOYANCE?

66
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,083
- I'M NOT SURE. IT'S
ALL SO DISJOINTED

67
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,750
THAT IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SAY.

68
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:53,458
- PERSONALLY, I THINK WE NEED TO
KEEP AN EYE ON THIS MEST FELLOW.

69
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,875
HE SAID HE WAS
MYSTOGAN'S PUPIL,

70
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:59,083
BUT THAT DOESN'T 
SIT WELL WITH ME.

71
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,375
- YOU TWO. I WANT TO KNOW,

72
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,375
DO YOUR SKILLS WARRANT
SUCH COCKINESS?

73
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,875
- BE CAREFUL.
HERE THEY COME.

74
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,750
- I DON'T GIVE
A CRAP ABOUT MEST,

75
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,208
BUT I FEEL BAD ABOUT
KICKING YOUR BUTT, WENDY.

76
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:21,083
- I AIN'T GOING EASY
ON YOU, KID.  ICE MAKE HAMMER.

77
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,500
SNEAK ATTACK, HUH?

78
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:30,541
- GRANT ME THE POWER
OF THE HEAVENS.

79
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,125
SKY DRAGON ROAR.

80
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:36,041
- O, REGULUS.
LEND ME YOUR STRENGTH.

81
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,541
I HAD NO CLUE
YOU WERE THIS POWERFUL.

82
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,791
- I GOT YOUR BACK.
ICE MAKE FLOOR.

83
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,375
THAT JUST LEAVES YOU, WENDY.

84
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,833
TOLD YOU I AIN'T
GOING EASY ON YOU.

85
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,791
ULTIMATE SECRET ART.

86
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,208
EAT A BUNCH OF PICKLED PLUMS.

87
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,333
( groaning )

88
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,791
- ( shouts )

89
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,541
THEY'RE SO SOUR THAT JUST
THE SIGHT OF THEM

90
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,541
MAKES MY LIPS START TO PUCKER.

91
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:30,416
THIS MUST BE SOME SORT
OF TELEPATHY MAGIC.

92
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,791
I'D BETTER RUN.
- THE ZENITH OF REGULUS.

93
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,208
- ( screaming )

94
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,000
- ( groaning )

95
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:46,000
- Narrator: MEANWHILE,
ELFMAN AND EVERGREEN

96
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,333
ARE FORCED TO FACE OFF

97
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:51,541
AGAINST HIS SISTER,
THE S-CLASS WIZARD MIRAJANE.

98
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,083
- ( chuckles )

99
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,333
- YOU CAN'T FIGHT US
IF YOU CAN'T MOVE.

100
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,750
- NICE TRY, THAT SPELL'S
COMPLETELY USELESS

101
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,708
IF I DON'T LOOK
INTO YOUR EYES.

102
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,041
- GOOD THING THAT'S NOT THE ONLY
SPELL I'VE GOT UP MY SLEEVE.

103
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:09,583
FAIRY MACHINE GUN.
LEPRECHAUN.

104
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,541
- NO, EVERGREEN.

105
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:22,250
COME ON, MIRA.
DO I HAVE TO FIGHT YOU?

106
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:31,041
( screaming )

107
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:34,000
I REALLY DIDN'T WANT IT
TO COME TO THIS.

108
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:37,625
FULL-BODY TAKE OVER,
BEAST SOUL.

109
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:50,041
- IT'S OVER NOW.
- NO, WAIT.

110
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:53,416
- YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO STOP
ME?  I'LL BLOW YOU BOTH AWAY.

111
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,583
- BEFORE YOU DO, THERE'S
SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW.

112
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:08,625
- ( gasps )
- ARE YOU OKAY?

113
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,375
- THEY'VE GOT EVERY RIGHT
TO BE COCKY.

114
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,625
THEY COULD BE THE BEST FIGHTERS
IN THE ENTIRE GUILD.

115
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,875
- THOSE TWO DON'T MESS AROUND.
- I'LL SHOW THEM.

116
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,375
I'M DETERMINED TO FOLLOW 
IN MY MASTER'S FOOTSTEPS.

117
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,083
I WON'T LET THEM BEAT ME.

118
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:23,583
COME OUT AND FACE ME RIGHT NOW,
YOU COWARDS.

119
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,375
THEY HERE?
- NO.

120
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,791
I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU,
BUT WE LOST TO THEM.

121
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,333
- YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

122
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,500
- I REALLY WISH I WAS,
BUT NO.

123
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,583
THEY BEAT US AND MOVED ON 
WHILE YOU WERE PASSED OUT.

124
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:41,333
- OH!  HOW COULD I FAIL
THIS YEAR, TOO?

125
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,791
- IT'S MY FAULT.  YOU NEVER
SHOULD'VE TEAMED UP WITH ME.

126
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:47,750
( sniffles ) I TRIED MY BEST,
BUT IT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

127
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,750
( crying )

128
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,958
- DON'T CRY.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

129
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,500
TRY NOT TO BE SO HARD
ON YOURSELF, OKAY?

130
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,166
- UH-HUH.

131
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:06,000
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. WE MADE IT
THROUGH THE FIRST ROUND, BABY.

132
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,000
- LET'S HOPE THE TOUGHER GUYS
LIKE NATSU AND FRIED

133
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,916
WERE KNOCKED OUT THIS ROUND.

134
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,875
WITH THEM GONE,
IT'LL BE A WALK IN THE PARK.

135
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:15,250
OH, WAIT.
CANA'S A MAJOR CONTENDER, TOO.

136
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,083
- DON'T BE STUPID, MAN.
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO,

137
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,791
THERE AIN'T NO EASY WAY
TO BECOME AN S-CLASS WIZARD.

138
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,500
- YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.
BUT YOU GOTTA ADMIT,

139
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,708
THE TWO OF US MADE BEATING MEST
LIKE THAT LOOK PRETTY EASY.

140
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,500
- NO KIDDING.  I DON'T REMEMBER
HIM BEING SO WEAK.

141
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,958
HE WAS AT A DISADVANTAGE
'CAUSE OF WENDY,

142
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,541
BUT I FEEL LIKE HE USED
TO BE STRONGER THAN THAT.

143
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,541
- PROBABLY BECAUSE
YOU'VE GOTTEN STRONGER.

144
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,958
- WEIRD.  THIS IS A FIRST.

145
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,041
I CAN'T REMEMBER
IF I FOUGHT HIM BEFORE,

146
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,041
AND I'M THE TYPE
WHO NEVER FORGETS A FIGHT.

147
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,041
- SURE THIS ISN'T A CASE
OF SELECTIVE MEMORY?

148
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,250
LIKE HE KICKED YOUR BUTT AND NOW
YOU DON'T WANNA REMEMBER?

149
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:51,000
- HMM, LET'S SEE.
MEST MANAGED TO GET PRETTY FAR

150
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,458
IN LAST YEAR'S S-CLASS TRIAL,
DIDN'T HE?

151
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,958
- HE DID,
AS FAR AS I KNOW.

152
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,708
- I THOUGHT SO.

153
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,333
HEY, DO YOU REMEMBER WHO
HIS PARTNER WAS LAST TIME?

154
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,625
- THAT'S WEIRD.
I KEEP DRAWING A BLANK.

155
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,916
- YEAH.  ME TOO,
AND MY MEMORY'S NOT THAT BAD.

156
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,958
- MINE'S NOT EITHER. - I
CAN ONLY PICTURE A FEW THINGS

157
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,333
ABOUT MEST,
AND THEY'RE ALL HAZY.

158
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,208
- IT'S LIKE I TRY TO THINK BACK,

159
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,916
BUT THEN I HIT
SOME KIND OF BLOCK.

160
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,250
I CAN'T SEEM TO REMEMBER
ANYTHING BEFORE IT.

161
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,000
- Both: HMM.

162
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,583
- Lucy: GRAY.  LOKE.

163
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,041
- I KNEW YOU GUYS WOULD HAVE
NO PROBLEM MAKING IT PAST

164
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:30,208
THE FIRST ROUND.
- NICE WORK.  CONGRATULATIONS.

165
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,333
- I TOLD YOU.  WE WERE LUCKY
TO GET THE "SERENITY" ROUTE.

166
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:36,833
- LUCKY?  BUT I DIDN'T GET 
TO BEAT UP A SINGLE PERSON.

167
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,416
- WOW, WE WERE THE ONLY ONES
WHO WERE ABLE TO CLEAR

168
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,875
THE FIRST ROUND?
- HMM, WHERE'S NATSU?

169
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,583
HE'S SITTING RIGHT OVER THERE.

170
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,583
- HE SEEMS KIND OF DOWN.
- WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM? 

171
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,916
- IT'S A LONG STORY
- ALL RIGHT.

172
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,500
I BELIEVE ALL OUR WINNERS
ARE HERE NOW.

173
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,291
- OH, YEAH.

174
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,916
- WELL, IN THAT CASE,
THESE ARE THE RESULTS THUS FAR.

175
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,291
CANA AND LUCY DEFEATED FRIED
AND BIXLOW IN COMBAT.

176
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,833
NICELY DONE, LADIES.
- THEY BEAT FRIED?  HOW?

177
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,083
- Makarov: NATSU AND HAPPY
SURMOUNTED THE OBSTACLE

178
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,083
KNOWN AS GILDARTS.

179
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,875
GOOD JOB.
- NO WAY.  THOSE TWO?

180
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,125
- YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T REALLY
DO MUCH OF ANYTHING.

181
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,041
- LEVY AND GAJEEL CHOSE
THE "SERENITY" ROUTE.

182
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,750
WELL, AREN'T YOU LUCKY?

183
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,791
- WELL, I THINK IT'S SUCKY.

184
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:27,208
- GRAY AND LOKE DEFEATED 
MEST AND WENDY IN COMBAT.

185
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,875
WAY TO GO, BOYS.

186
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,416
- JUVIA DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT
THROUGH THE FIRST ROUND?

187
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,625
WHAT'S WITH THE CREEPY LOOK
ON YOUR FACE, GRAMPS?

188
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,791
- UNFORTUNATELY, LUCK WAS NOT

189
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,666
ON JUVIA AND LISANNA'S
SIDE TODAY.

190
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,000
THEIR ROUTE LED
TO "SHE WHO KNOWS NO MERCY."

191
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,541
- OH.

192
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:47,000
- WANT ANOTHER GO AT ME?
- NO, WE SURRENDER.

193
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,000
- THAT SUCKS.

194
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,666
- ELFMAN AND EVERGREEN
AREN'T HERE.

195
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,916
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HAPPENED TO 'EM? 

196
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,208
- WELL,
BY PROCESS OF ELIMINATION,

197
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,416
THE ONLY OTHER ROUTE--

198
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,875
- ( both gasp )

199
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,166
- Both: MIRAJANE!

200
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,875
- I FEEL SORRY FOR THEM.

201
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,000
- I COULD TAKE HER,
BUT THOSE TWO HAD NO CHANCE.

202
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,458
- Elfman:
DON'T COUNT US OUT YET.

203
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,541
DIDN'T THINK WE COULD BEAT
MY BIG SIS, DID YOU?

204
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,166
- GUESS WHO'S MOVING ON
TO ROUND TWO.

205
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,666
- MY WORD. - HOW THE
HECK DID YOU BEAT MIRA?

206
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,708
- UH...

207
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,333
A REAL MAN DOESN'T
BRAG ABOUT HIS WINS.

208
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,791
- LET'S JUST SAY WE TOOK
FULL ADVANTAGE

209
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:22,833
OF CATCHING HER OFF-GUARD.

210
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,916
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

211
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,958
- AHEM.  BACK TO THE TRIAL.

212
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:30,375
AS IT STANDS,
THERE ARE FIVE TEAMS LEFT.

213
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,791
NATSU AND HAPPY,
GRAY AND LOKE,

214
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,583
LEVY AND GAJEEL,
CANA AND LUCY

215
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,125
AND ELFMAN AND EVERGREEN.

216
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:40,541
CONGRATULATIONS ON PASSING
THE FIRST ROUND.

217
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:44,958
NOW THAT EVERYONE'S HERE, LET'S
MOVE ON TO THE SECOND ROUND.

218
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:48,541
- NATSU, I HATE TO SEE YOU
SO DOWN IN THE DUMPS.

219
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,625
- I'M NOT.

220
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,166
I'M JUST DOING SOME THINKING.

221
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,583
- YOU'RE THINKING?
YOU NEVER DO THAT.

222
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,541
BE CAREFUL.
YOU MIGHT HURT YOURSELF.

223
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,875
- JEEZ, HOW LITTLE DO YOU
THINK OF HIM, HAPPY?

224
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,916
- Gildarts:
I'LL TAKE YOU ON AGAIN ANYTIME.

225
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,125
NOW GO BECOME
AN S-CLASS WIZARD.

226
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,375
YOU HEAR ME?

227
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,375
- I'M GONNA DO MY BEST.
YOU'LL SEE.

228
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,041
GRAY.  CANA.

229
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,375
LEVY.  ELFMAN.

230
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,833
ONLY ONE OF US IS GONNA BE
AN S-CLASS WIZARD

231
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,625
AND THAT'S ME.

232
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,958
- YEAH, RIGHT, THERE'S NO WAY
I'M LOSING TO YOU.

233
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,125
- ( laughs )
- NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

234
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:31,083
- CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.
'CAUSE I'M A REAL MAN, BABY.

235
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,791
- OH, YEAH,
I'M ALL FIRED UP NOW.

236
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,541
- AYE, SIR.

237
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:36,916
- I'M GONNA DO WHATEVER IT TAKES

238
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,041
TO MAKE YOU
AN S-CLASS WIZARD, CANA.

239
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,791
- BETTER HOPE YOU DON'T
HAVE TO FIGHT ME.

240
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,083
'CAUSE I WON'T GO EASY ON YOU.

241
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:46,083
- ( laughs )
BIG TALK FOR A BUNCH OF WIMPS.

242
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:49,000
- WHAT THE HECK
DID YOU CALL ME? ( winces )

243
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:52,041
- COME ON, ELFMAN,
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER.

244
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,208
- WELL, WE KNOW WHO'S
NOT GONNA MAKE S-CLASS.

245
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,625
- LISTEN. I'M ABOUT
TO GIVE INSTRUCTIONS

246
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:57,875
FOR THE SECOND PART.

247
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,583
THE NEXT STAGE
OF THE S-CLASS TRIAL STARTS NOW.

248
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,541
- ( all gasp )

249
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:13,333
( all gasp )

250
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:16,125
- TO PASS THE NEXT ROUND, 
YOU MUST SEARCH THE ISLAND

251
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,708
FOR THE GRAVE
OF FAIRY TAIL'S FOUNDER--

252
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,291
MAVIS VERMILLION.

253
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,833
- I FORGOT SHE WAS BURIED HERE.

254
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,541
- AND WE'VE GOTTA FIND
WHERE THAT IS.

255
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:25,875
- COME ON, GRAMPS.

256
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,541
THAT'S ALMOST TOO EASY.
- NO JOKE.

257
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,500
- YOU HAVE SIX HOURS
TO FIND IT OR YOU FAIL.

258
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,791
NO EXCUSES.
IS THAT CHALLENGING ENOUGH?

259
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:38,000
VERY WELL.  I'LL BE WAITING
FOR YOU AT MAVIS' GRAVE.

260
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:42,958
- YOU READY?  LET'S GO!
- AYE, SIR.

261
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:46,708
- Narrator:
MEANWHILE, WENDY IS STILL AT IT.

262
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,166
- ( crying )

263
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,833
- IF YOU KEEP THAT UP,
YOU'LL RUN OUT OF TEARS.

264
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,791
- I'M SORRY.  I CAN'T STOP.

265
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:57,750
- LISTEN, WENDY.
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

266
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,166
MAKAROV SAID THIS ISLAND
IS CONSIDERED

267
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,125
FAIRY TAIL'S SACRED GROUND.

268
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,416
SO DO YOU KNOW WHY?

269
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,416
- WELL, YEAH, I THINK SO.

270
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,000
BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE THE
GUILD'S FIRST MASTER IS BURIED.

271
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:10,375
- YEAH.  ALTHOUGH THAT
CAN'T BE THE ONLY REASON.

272
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,666
TENROU ISLAND'S PROTECTED
BY A POWERFUL FORCE FIELD

273
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,041
THAT HIDES IT FROM OUTSIDERS.

274
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,833
APPARENTLY,
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND,

275
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,000
NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF
MAGIC YOU USE.

276
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,541
MAVIS WAS SPECIAL,

277
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,791
BUT I DON'T THINK THEY'D GO TO 
SUCH LENGTHS TO HIDE HER GRAVE.

278
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,291
SUPPOSEDLY,
THERE'S A MAJOR SECRET

279
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,500
REGARDING THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD.

280
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,583
THAT'S HIDDEN SOMEWHERE
ON THIS ISLAND.

281
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,208
- DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THE SECRET IS?

282
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,958
- NOPE.  I HAVE NO IDEA.

283
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,875
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

284
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,583
DO YOU WANNA GO
AND DO SOME EXPLORING?

285
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,125
- ( giggles )

286
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,833
- THE PRINCE--
I MEAN, MYSTOGAN,

287
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,000
FELT IT WAS BEST TO AVOID
CONTACT WITH PEOPLE

288
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:56,000
WHENEVER HE VISITED
THIS WORLD.

289
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,250
- I'VE BEEN TOLD HE WOULD
PUT EVERYONE TO SLEEP

290
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,750
WHEN HE DROPPED BY THE GUILD.

291
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,333
I ASSUME HE WAS TRYING
TO PREVENT THEM

292
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,625
FROM SEEING HIS FACE.

293
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,500
- AND THAT'S WHY I FIND
IT HARD TO BELIEVE

294
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,541
HE'D HAVE A PUPIL HERE.
- WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?

295
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:12,750
- WHILE IT'S NOTHING MORE 
THAN BASELESS SPECULATION,

296
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,458
I HAVE A THEORY.

297
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,750
- IT'S SO PRETTY UP HERE.
- BE CAREFUL.

298
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,125
- ( giggles )

299
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,916
- I KNOW IT MIGHT SOUND CRAZY,

300
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,041
BUT I'M NOT SURE MEST IS
A MEMBER OF FAIRY TAIL. 

301
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:47,500
- ( panting )
PLEASE DON'T EAT ME!

302
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:48,958
- ( roaring )
- PICK UP THE PACE, LUCY.

303
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,000
- ( screaming )

304
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,958
PRETTY PLEASE WITH SUGAR ON TOP.

305
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,416
NO, I'M TOO CUTE TO DIE!

306
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,000
- MAN, I HATE THIS ISLAND.

307
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,666
- I'M STARTING TO THINK
I MIGHT DIE HERE.

308
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,500
- THIS AIN'T NOTHING BUT A BUMP
ON THE ROAD

309
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,083
ON MY WAY TO BEING S-CLASS.

310
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,875
- SURE, WHATEVER YOU SAY.

311
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,458
- FOLLOW A REAL MAN TO SAFETY!
- OH, SHUT UP.

312
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,208
YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS OF ME.

313
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,541
- STOP INTERRUPTING ME
OR YOU'RE GONNA GET CHARRED.

314
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,625
- ( roaring )
- I WARNED YOU.

315
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,500
- THERE'S NO STOPPING NATSU
WHEN HE WANTS SOMETHING,

316
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,666
AND HE WANTS
TO FINISH THIS TEST.

317
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:29,000
- ( groans )
- ( sighs )

318
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:32,166
- HOORAY!  WAY TO GO, NATSU.
YOU READY TO GET MOVING?

319
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,625
- NO, NOT YET.
GIVE ME A SEC.

320
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,625
- YOU'D BETTER TELL ME WHERE THE
FIRST GUILD MASTER'S GRAVE IS,

321
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,041
OR I'M GONNA BURN YOU TO
A CRISP, YOU GOT THAT, BIG GUY?

322
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,916
- THAT'S CUCKOO!
- I DON'T KNOW.

323
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,958
- THAT'S COOL.
- IT ANSWERED YOU?

324
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,083
- HOW DOES GRAMPS EXPECT US
TO FIND MAVIS' GRAVE

325
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,416
WHEN HE DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER
TO GIVE US ANY CLUES?

326
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,916
- PRETTY SNEAKY.

327
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,875
I GUESS THIS ROUND'S GONNA BE
HARDER THAN WE THOUGHT.

328
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,750
- YOU KNOW,
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

329
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,666
THIS ISLAND'S SHAPED
KIND OF FUNKY, ISN'T IT?

330
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,416
- YEAH, SO?

331
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,250
- YOU WANNA GO SEE WHAT'S
AT THE TOP WITH ME?

332
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,958
- DEFINITELY!
- AWESOME!

333
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,250
I KNEW TEAMING UP WITH YOU
WAS A GOOD IDEA.

334
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,041
I COULDN'T DO THIS WITHOUT
YOU, LITTLE BUDDY.

335
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,125
ALL RIGHT.
YOU READY TO HEAD TO THE TOP?

336
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,083
- YEP, YOU KNOW IT.

337
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:16,416
- Narrator: THIS IS FAIRY TAIL'S
MAKESHIFT BASE ON TENROU ISLAND.

338
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,291
- NO WAY.  ELFMAN AND EVERGREEN
SAID THEY'RE GETTING MARRIED?

339
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,750
- YEP, IT TOTALLY CAUGHT ME OFF
GUARD AND THAT GAVE THEM

340
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,666
AN OPENING TO ATTACK.

341
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,291
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?
THEY'VE OBVIOUSLY BEEN DATING

342
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,375
AWHILE IF THEY'RE
GETTING MARRIED, 

343
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,250
BUT YOU NEVER MENTIONED IT.

344
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,000
- I THINK THEY JUST WANTED
TO SAY SOMETHING SHOCKING

345
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:36,333
TO THROW ME OFF.  I GUESS I'VE
STILL GOT A LOT TO LEARN.

346
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,250
- WHAT IF IT WASN'T A STRATEGY?

347
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,375
- REMEMBER WHO WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT HERE. 

348
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,375
KNOWING MY BROTHER,
I DOUBT THAT IT'S TRUE.

349
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,416
I NEVER IMAGINED
THE TWO OF THEM 

350
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
GETTING MARRIED
AND HAVING BABIES.

351
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,333
HMM.

352
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,250
- I'M A REAL BABY.

353
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:54,583
- ( crying )
- THERE'S NO NEED TO CRY.

354
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,000
IT'S KIND OF CUTE,
DEPENDING ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT.

355
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,666
- Lisanna: YOU KNOW,
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

356
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,666
THEY'D MAKE AN AWESOME COUPLE.

357
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,583
- THEY'RE GONNA HAVE BABIES.

358
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,000
- HEY, WHAT HAPPENED
TO FRIED AND BIXLOW?

359
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,958
- APPARENTLY, THE TWO OF THEM
AND GILDARTS WENT BACK HOME.

360
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,833
- JEEZ.
TALK ABOUT IMPATIENT.

361
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,875
THEY COULD'VE STAYED AND WATCHED
THE REST OF THE TRIAL.

362
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,875
- I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT MEST
AND WENDY.  WHERE ARE THEY?

363
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,750
- THEY SHOULD'VE 
BEEN HERE BY NOW.

364
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,583
- THEY PROBABLY JUST FORGOT THAT
WE'RE ALL SUPPOSED TO MEET HERE.

365
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:25,291
- BABIES.  BABIES.
- SO THIS MEST GUY.

366
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,166
- I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT HIM
'CAUSE I NEVER RAN

367
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,791
INTO HIS COUNTERPART IN EDOLAS.

368
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:33,583
DID HE JOIN FAIRY TAIL DURING 
THE TWO YEARS THAT I WAS GONE?

369
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,125
- I DON'T KNOW, DID HE?

370
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,958
- I FEEL LIKE HE'S ALWAYS
BEEN A MEMBER.

371
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,125
- HE DOESN'T MAKE
A BIG IMPRESSION, HUH?

372
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,625
- I VOLUNTEER TO GO
AND LOOK FOR THEM.

373
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,333
I'M STARTING TO GET
A LITTLE WORRIED.

374
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,791
- YOU TWO STAY HERE
AND GUARD THE TENT.

375
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,875
I'M GOING TO ACCOMPANY
JUVIA ON HER SEARCH.

376
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:51,916
- I WANTED TO DITCH THEM AND GO
CHEER ON MY BELOVED GRAY.

377
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,375
- ( screaming )

378
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,708
- A REAL MAN SHOULD NEVER
RUN FROM HIS ENEMY.

379
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,500
- IF YOU DON'T STOP THIS
"REAL MAN" NONSENSE,

380
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,750
I'LL FINISH YOU MYSELF.
- LOOK OUT!

381
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,916
- ( groaning )
- OW, THAT HURT.

382
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,166
- HEY!  WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

383
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,666
DON'T YOU DARE START THINKING
I'M INTERESTED IN YOU

384
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,291
JUST BECAUSE
OF WHAT I SAID TO MIRA.

385
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,125
I WAS ONLY TRYING TO
THROW HER OFF HER GAME,

386
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:28,041
NOT EXPRESSING ANY REAL DESIRE
TO HOOK UP WITH YOU, BONEHEAD.

387
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,625
- WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?

388
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,041
GOTTA HAND IT TO YOU, THOUGH,
THAT WAS PRETTY SMOOTH.

389
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,791
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE A NICE GIRL
LIKE YOU CAME UP

390
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,250
WITH SUCH
A NAUGHTY TRICK.

391
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,000
- YOU MAKE IT SOUND SO DIRTY.

392
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,875
- HUH?  PEOPLE?

393
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,250
I'M CONFUSED.

394
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,125
WHY HAVE YOU COME TO
SUCH A DESOLATE PLACE?

395
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:54,000
I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT
THIS ISLAND WAS UNINHABITED.

396
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:57,250
- WELL, YOU WERE WRONG, PAL.
- YOU'RE TRESPASSING.

397
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,958
ONLY MEMBERS OF OUR GUILD
ARE ALLOWED HERE.

398
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:02,291
- I'M TRESPASSING?
FORGIVE ME.

399
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,875
I DIDN'T KNOW THIS ISLAND 
WAS CONTROLLED BY A GUILD.

400
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,000
- IT IS.  OURS!
- NO, STAY BACK!

401
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:13,208
IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE,
DON'T COME ANY CLOSER TO ME.

402
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,750
- THAT KIND OF SOUNDS
LIKE A CHALLENGE.

403
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:18,333
- NO, IT'S NOT.
I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT YOU.

404
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,666
I'LL LEAVE THE ISLAND
PEACEFULLY.

405
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,833
PLEASE JUST DON'T COME NEAR ME.

406
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,375
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

407
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,458
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT HE SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

408
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,916
- NO.  HERE IT COMES.

409
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,208
PREDATORY DEATH.

410
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:45,791
I CAN'T STOP IT.
( grunting )

411
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,958
- Natsu: GET DOWN!
- ( grunting )

412
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,291
- ( gasps )

413
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,250
YOU.

414
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,166
NATSU.

415
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:30,791
- WHO ARE YOU?

416
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:34,750
YOU'D BETTER ANSWER ME
OR ELSE.

417
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:44,208
- ( theme music playing )

418
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,583
- ( singing in Japanese )

419
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:14,291
- Natsu: I KNOW THIS
IS A WEIRD TIME TO ASK,

420
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,916
BUT IF YOU'RE A CAT,
WHY ARE YOU BLUE?

421
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,416
- Happy:
YEAH, IT IS A WEIRD TIME TO ASK.

422
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,958
I DON'T KNOW, NATSU.

423
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,416
I DON'T REALLY THINK
THERE IS A REASON.

424
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,250
- Natsu:
THERE'S GOT TO BE.

425
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,083
SOMEONE ONCE SAID, "EVERYTHING
HAPPENS FOR A REASON."

426
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:25,583
I MEAN, IT WAS AN OLD GUY
WALKING DOWN THE STREET,

427
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,250
BUT YOU GET THE POINT.

428
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:28,916
- Happy: YOU LEARNED THAT
FROM SOME RANDOM OLD GUY?

429
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,375
MAN, I THOUGHT YOU FINALLY
PICKED UP A BOOK.

430
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:33,375
- Happy and Natsu:
NEXT TIME, "BLACK WIZARD"!

431
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:35,916
- Happy: MAYBE IT'S 'CAUSE I'M
LIKE THE BLUEBIRD OF HAPPINESS.

432
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,750
THAT'S HOW I GOT MY NAME.
REMEMBER?

433
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:39,583
PLUS I HAVE WINGS
AND I CAN FLY.

434
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:41,375
- Natsu: YOU SOUND MORE
LIKE A BIRD THAN A CAT.
