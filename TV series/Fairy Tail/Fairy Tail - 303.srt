[coughing]

3
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:28,375
[gasps] Oh, no! Your mask!

4
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,750
You gotta get it back on, now!

5
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,333
[LEVY]
I'm sorry. I was bluffing.

6
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:36,333
The truth is, it never worked.

7
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:37,583
[gasps]

8
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,625
[LEVY] Bane Particles
don't just get inhaled,

9
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,416
they're absorbed
through the skin, too.

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,958
I guess I never had
a chance, huh?

11
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:51,083
Then why in the hell
did you even come here?!

12
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,833
I hoped I could save you.

13
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:54,625
[gasps]

14
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,333
Levy!

15
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,208
Okay.

16
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,458
Hang in there, Levy.

17
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:41,291
I'm gonna take this ugly
bastard down for good!

18
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:46,208
[BLOODMAN] All your
struggling is for naught.

19
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,333
[yells]

20
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:50,916
Be careful.

21
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,833
[GAJEEL yells]

22
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:05,250
[BLOODMAN] There's nothing
you can do to harm me!

23
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:16,000
[GAJEEL] Finding the right
cat to be my partner...

24
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:20,125
Getting motion sickness like
all the other Dragon Slayers...

25
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,833
And I still haven't
achieved Dragon Force...

26
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,916
[GAJEEL] I'm always lagging
behind everybody else.

27
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,583
It used to make me
feel like such a loser.

28
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,375
Pathetic.

29
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:40,333
So many times I
wanted to walk away.

30
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,375
But I've changed.

31
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:46,083
None of that matters
to me anymore.

32
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,708
The only thing I
give a damn about

33
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,500
is protecting the
girl I fell for!

34
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,708
[LEVY]
No.

35
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:05,208
[BLOODMAN] Huh? That fool--he's
consuming my Bane Particles!

36
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:08,166
You can't mix them
with your Ether-nano!

37
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,583
You're only speeding
along your demise!

38
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,958
You don't have to do this,
Gajeel! Please stop!

39
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,458
[BLOODMAN]
Huh?

40
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:29,875
What? His body... He's turned
himself into black iron!

41
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,666
It's steel!

42
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,958
No! It's gonna kill you!

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,541
[BLOODMAN]
His element is iron.

44
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:41,583
I think he's using the trace
elements in Bane Particles

45
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,708
so he can ingest them!

46
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,125
[yells]

47
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:50,708
[BLOODMAN] He shouldn't
be able to touch me!

48
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,000
He risked his life
and took in my poison

49
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,083
just so he could hit me?

50
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,916
[BLOODMAN]
No! I can't accept it!

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,083
What kind of human is this?

52
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:10,875
[yelling]

53
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,500
[GAJEEL]
I'm doin' it.

54
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm gonna get Levy
back home safe!

55
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:20,166
[screams]

56
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,500
You okay?

57
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:31,375
[gasps]

58
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,000
[yells]

59
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,333
What the--?

60
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:35,625
[yells]

61
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,125
[BLOODMAN]
I won't die alone!

62
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,791
I'm taking you with me!

63
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,375
[LEVY]
Gajeel!

64
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,125
[GAJEEL]
What is this?

65
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:49,500
I can't get out!
It's pulling me in!

66
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:53,875
[BLOODMAN] This is a portal
to an eternity of torment.

67
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:57,125
From which there is no return.

68
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,916
[screaming]

69
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,333
Fight it!

70
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,666
Get away!

71
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,958
Don't come any closer.

72
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:14,500
I'm practically a big lump
of poison now anyway.

73
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:20,291
If you touch me,
you'll die, too.

74
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,666
[LEVY]
I don't care what happens to me!

75
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,375
[GAJEEL]
Levy!

76
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:27,041
I'm not scared!
I'm going to save you!

77
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,708
Please, hold on!

78
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,458
What do you think you're doing?!

79
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,416
Saving you.

80
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,791
[LEVY]
That's not gonna work this time!

81
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,916
I'm not the same person anymore!

82
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,750
I've grown!

83
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,666
Levy!

84
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,333
[LEVY gasps]

85
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,250
[LEVY]
Let me go!

86
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,541
[PANTHERLILY] I won't let
you get dragged in, too!

87
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,791
[LEVY]
I can help him!

88
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:10,250
If we stand here doing
nothing, he's gonna die!

89
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,958
Listen...

90
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:20,375
[GAJEEL]
I used to be... a real bad guy.

91
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,541
A total scumbag.

92
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,916
But then I met you.

93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,583
You taught me how to
see the good in others.

94
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,833
How to be a better man.

95
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,125
I learned...

96
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:39,333
...even I had the ability
to truly love another person.

97
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,875
[LEVY]
Gajeel.

98
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,958
[GAJEEL]
Because of you,

99
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,916
I started to think
about life differently.

100
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,791
Things that had never even
crossed my mind before.

101
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,000
The future...

102
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,958
A family...

103
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,958
Real happiness...

104
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,750
It's kinda funny.

105
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,375
Ol' "Black Steel" Gajeel...

106
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:16,375
...dreamin' about life
like a regular guy.

107
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:20,166
I wanted us to be
together, forever.

108
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,625
And losing that future

109
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:25,250
is way scarier than I
could have ever imagined.

110
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,958
Gajeel.

111
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,416
[GAJEEL] So I'm gonna
give my future to you.

112
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,166
[LEVY]
No! Gajeel! Don't go!

113
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,875
[GAJEEL]
Live enough for both of us.

114
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,666
Please don't leave me!

115
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,166
You gotta fight...

116
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,625
[GAJEEL] Lily, I need you to
take Levy back to the guild!

117
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,375
Promise me.

118
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,041
I promise!

119
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,375
Well, that sucked.

120
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,416
And then I had to land
face first on this board.

121
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:09,083
You're under arrest
for self-doubt.

122
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,375
You know what this
means, don't ya?

123
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,791
I'm gonna throw your butt
in a guild hall cell

124
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,125
when we get back.

125
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,666
So, do you wanna explain
why you left without me?

126
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,583
Huh...

127
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,291
You're just so tiny
that I assumed

128
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,625
you musta been stowin'
away in my bag.

129
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:31,208
That was my mistake, sorry!
Nothin' personal.

130
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:35,791
No!

131
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,833
[BOTH crying]

132
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,583
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but that's not really an option.

133
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,208
It's a big 'ol waste a time.

134
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,333
And annoying.

135
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,500
[LEVY crying]

136
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,750
[LEVY]
Well, what a surprise!

137
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:03,833
You can smile!

138
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,333
Shut up, ya little busybody!

139
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,458
But you're still a jerk!

140
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,083
He isn't heavy at all, I swear.

141
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,958
[LEVY yelps]

142
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,208
[LEVY gasps]

143
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,458
Okay, ya made your point.

144
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,416
But, Gajeel...

145
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:27,583
Gajeel? Maybe you should
go home and take a nap.

146
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,916
You're snoring in public.

147
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,791
Gajeel, no!

148
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,833
The dragons are all
but extinct. Six remain.

149
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:04,541
[IRENE] I see. So that's
your ultimate goal, is it?

150
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,375
[ACNOLOGIA]
I've no use for you. Begone.

151
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:16,750
[IRENE] You are quite
the menacing figure.

152
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:21,416
You know who I am and still
you dare stand in my way?

153
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,958
[IRENE] I do. O "Black
Dragon of the Apocalypse."

154
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:30,416
Perhaps you'll provide me
with a bit of entertainment.

155
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,541
Yes, and much more.

156
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,125
[gasps]

157
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,000
Listen, August.

158
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:51,833
Emperor Spriggan is leading
us down a path of pure evil.

159
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,958
It's genocide, nothing more.

160
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:58,500
No matter what name it goes by,
you can't change what it is.

161
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,500
This war isn't about some sort
of philosophical disagreement

162
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,291
between two sides.

163
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,625
It's plain slaughter.

164
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,333
Of all the members
of the Twelve,

165
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:11,291
you hold the most wisdom.

166
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,791
We're fighting for nothing,
that's what's left at the end.

167
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,166
Just emptiness.

168
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,166
[AUGUST] His Majesty will
make the final decision--

169
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,500
But think for yourself!

170
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:25,833
Um, you might not wanna
get too pushy with him.

171
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,833
I finally saw things
as they are.

172
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,250
The people of this land,

173
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,291
they haven't done a
thing to wrong us.

174
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,916
Oh, hey there.

175
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,958
[AUGUST]
You.

176
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,291
[growls]

177
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:48,375
Natsu, would you stop giving
him the stink-eye?! Now!

178
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,875
[BRANDISH]
Please, August.

179
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,333
All I ask is that you at
least try talking with them.

180
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,833
Well, if it means
that much to you.

181
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:02,666
But I'm only doing this because
I value your companionship.

182
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,041
Oh, thank you so much, Grandpa!

183
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,833
We're comrades,
not blood relatives.

184
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:12,208
Yeah, but you are like
a grandfather to me!

185
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,541
Wow.

186
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,125
[giggles]

187
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,916
Grandpa, I...

188
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,291
[AUGUST]
Hm?

189
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,083
[BOTH gasp]

190
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,125
Something wrong?

191
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,458
[gasps]

192
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,458
Ah! What the hell?

193
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,250
Old fool.

194
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:44,375
I've been dreaming of this day.
Die. Like I've always wanted.

195
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,250
Grandpa?

196
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,041
[gasps]

197
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:05,208
All right, you!
What the hell did you do?

198
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,125
I implanted a memory inside her.

199
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,916
Some feeling in
the back her mind

200
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,291
that she had to kill August!

201
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,333
But why?!

202
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,125
Because I'm
protecting the guild!

203
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:19,166
[BRANDISH crying]

204
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,791
Brandish...?

205
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,708
[HAPPY]
Hey. What's happening?

206
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:42,625
I don't know.

207
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:46,125
Wait. It feels like magic power.

208
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,458
[gasps]

209
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,375
It's him!

210
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,875
No way!

211
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:10,250
[AUGUST] Now do you understand
why we're here, Brandish?

212
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,791
They've finally revealed
the true depravity

213
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,708
of their character.

214
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,291
[BRANDISH]
I'm sorry.

215
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,083
Brandish, no!

216
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,208
Stay back!

217
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,416
Melt away.

218
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:14,416
[GROUP screaming]

219
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,958
That looks like
a huge explosion!

220
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,708
It's coming from the east!

221
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,666
[WIZARD E]
No, does that mean...?

222
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,583
[WIZARD F] That's where they
were meeting the enemy.

223
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,416
I hope they're okay.

224
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,958
Looks bad.

225
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,458
Fairy Glitter!

226
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:45,500
[MAVIS screaming]

227
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,791
Oh, no. I failed!

228
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:02,958
[gasps]

229
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:21,208
Master Mavis, tell me
you're okay! Wake up!

230
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:31,416
My muscles must have atrophied.

231
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,125
I barely have the
strength to move.

232
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,416
So, let's begin our dance.

233
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,875
[ACNOLOGIA]
An atmospheric enchantment.

234
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:25,041
So you're one who can use your
power on anything you desire.

235
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,416
A rare High Enchanter!

236
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,041
[laughs]

237
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:43,833
Phew.

238
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,458
For someone who learned
from that sad Black Wizard,

239
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,666
your power's impressive.

240
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,458
What fun.

241
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,208
That so?

242
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,666
I'll gladly take the praise.

243
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,333
I've heard quite a lot
about your ability.

244
00:18:57,416 --> 00:19:01,208
And I can see firsthand
why His Majesty fears you.

245
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:04,500
However, once he has
control of the Fairy Heart,

246
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:07,166
he'll fear no one.

247
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:11,333
[ACNOLOGIA] I see. His goal
is to surpass me, then?

248
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,083
It's a strong possibility.

249
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,541
[ACNOLOGIA] Does he think I'll
leave you pathetic humans alone

250
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,375
until he's ready for me?

251
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,375
How ridiculous!

252
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,083
[IRENE]
Oh?

253
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:25,666
Seems you may be
forgetting your origins.

254
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,750
You were a pathetic
human once, right?

255
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:34,333
[IRENE] Still, it would
be much better for me...

256
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,625
...if you did not interfere.

257
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:41,083
His Majesty's view...
is this is just a game.

258
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,875
I need him to stay focused.

259
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:48,041
No distractions, so this
war can end quickly.

260
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:01,708
Irene. That's her magic.

261
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,875
What spell is this?

262
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:07,083
I've never seen
anything of the sort.

263
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,375
Yes.

264
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,208
Because this spell
did not even exist

265
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:13,666
during your heyday
400 years ago.

266
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,041
This is the magic
born of a new era.

267
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,583
This power...

268
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,875
Have you actually enchanted
the ground beneath our feet?

269
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:26,291
[IRENE] I have. And it stretches
across the entire kingdom.

270
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,250
Who are you? Tell me.

271
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,666
If you're asking
my name, it's Irene.

272
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,333
I hope we meet again someday.

273
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:44,375
Until then, Acnologia.

274
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:51,875
[LEVY crying]

275
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,625
[PANTHERLILY]
This light. What's happening?

276
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,083
[PANTHERLILY]
Where's it coming from?

277
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:44,708
[CANA]
First Master, what is this?

278
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,500
So bright.

279
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,666
[ZEREF]
I can't believe it.

280
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:56,625
Irene. Have you really gone
and used that spell?

281
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,708
The magic that
reorganizes the world...

282
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,958
[ZEREF]
...Universe One.

283
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,583
[LUCY] Irene casts her
powerful Universe One spell,

284
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:43,416
restructuring the
entire kingdom of Fiore.

285
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,333
The wizards from Ishgar are
thrown into total confusion

286
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:48,375
as they scramble to
find their bearings.

287
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,083
But still, they join together

288
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,416
and fight against
the invading forces.

289
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,916
Meanwhile, after regaining
her physical form,

290
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,250
Mavis is confronted with a new
ordeal and an old friend.

291
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:02,083
Next time: "Fairy Tail Zero."

292
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:04,041
In these times of
great adversity,

293
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:06,958
we can only survive
by coming together.
