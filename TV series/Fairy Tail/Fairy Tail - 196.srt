1
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,875
Finally found you.

2
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,875
Millianna, I--

3
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:05,750
Listen to me!

4
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,625
It's okay, Erza. Leave it be.

5
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,291
No it isn't.

6
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,583
[ERZA] I've forgiven
Jellal, and so should you.

7
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,958
How could you ever
defend a monster like him?

8
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,208
Did you forget
he murdered Simon?

9
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,666
He has to pay. He's a
liar and a murderer.

10
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,375
I can't forgive that!
I'll kill him or die trying!

11
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:30,666
[ERZA] I know where that
path leads. A dark, empty place.

12
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,375
Killing him won't
bring back the dead!

13
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,666
[MILLIANNA] So I should just
pretend everything's okay?

14
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,166
I won't do it! This is wrong!

15
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,208
[ULTEAR]
Yes, I agree.

16
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,208
[JELLAL gasps]

17
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:40,291
[MILLIANNA gasps]

18
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,250
[ULTEAR]
This is wrong.

19
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,833
[HAPPY]
Sin and Sacrifice!

20
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,375
[JELLAL]
Ultear. It's you.

21
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,083
You can't blame
Jellal for the things

22
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,500
he did back then.
He wasn't in control.

23
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,000
Wait, who are you?

24
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,500
I'm the girl who was pulling
the strings the entire time.

25
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,125
[MILLIANNA gasps]

26
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,458
[YOUNG ULTEAR] I feed off
the suffering of others,

27
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,750
and I have gained
much power from you.

28
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,166
You're such a fortunate boy

29
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,250
to have the honor
of speaking with a god.

30
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,958
Yes?

31
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,625
[YOUNG ULTEAR] The most
nefarious wizard in history.

32
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:20,791
I am Zeref.
I am hatred incarnate.

33
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,250
[YOUNG JELLAL]
We need to stay here, Erza.

34
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:27,333
[YOUNG ERZA] But we're slaves.
We'll be free once we escape!

35
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,666
[YOUNG ERZA shrieks]

36
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,625
[YOUNG JELLAL]
Fine then, I'll let you leave.

37
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,541
Go on, have a good time
pretending to be free.

38
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,291
However, I swear that I'll
kill everyone you care for

39
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,708
if you ever come back here.

40
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,333
That's the price
of your freedom!

41
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,291
So go on! That is,
if you can stand

42
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,500
with the weight of their
lives on your shoulders.

43
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,500
[MILLIANNA gasps]

44
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,625
[ERZA]
Leave her be, Ultear.

45
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,416
See, that's the kind of
person that I really am.

46
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,291
[ERZA grunts]

47
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,875
[MILLIANNA gasps]

48
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,875
[ULTEAR] Heh. There's no
point in fighting it.

49
00:03:56,958 --> 00:04:01,166
No matter how hard
I try to play the hero,

50
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:07,166
the truth of it is, I'll
always be rotten at the core.

51
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,541
And what makes you say that?

52
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,500
[ULTEAR] It's a fact.
Anyway, now isn't exactly

53
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:15,500
the time for us to
stand around chatting.

54
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:18,708
This area's still crawling with
that mother dragon's offspring.

55
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,791
We should split up
and wipe them out.

56
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,625
And one more thing, kitten.

57
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,250
I alone am to blame
for your friend's death.

58
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,125
As a matter of fact,
I was the architect

59
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,958
of the Tower of Heaven.

60
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,833
[ULTEAR] I'll give you a shot
at revenge once this is over.

61
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:39,583
So if that's what you want,
you'll have to survive.

62
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,833
[ERZA] Believe it or not,
she's a victim herself.

63
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,583
She was raised as
a test subject,

64
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,833
and taught of nothing but pain.

65
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:53,333
Honestly, I dunno what
to make of all this.

66
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,583
[JELLAL] We live in a
chaotic and damaged world.

67
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:59,208
[ERZA] Even so, we have
to keep fighting.

68
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,708
To strive for something better.

69
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:17,208
[ULTEAR] There's only one way
for me to make things right.

70
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,500
And that is to kill Rogue.

71
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,541
We would just be killing a
completely innocent person.

72
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:28,875
It's wrong. So, no.
Think of our futures.

73
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,250
Just who would we
be if we did this?

74
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,875
[ULTEAR grunts]

75
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,666
[ULTEAR]
This is who I really am.

76
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:53,500
[LEVIA roaring]

77
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,416
[STING] Why the hell are
you just sittin' there?

78
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,666
[ROGUE]
Sting, what're you doing?

79
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,625
[STING] Thought I'd drop
by and save your butt!

80
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:04,916
Let's do this!

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,750
Wait, so have you already
beaten your dragon?

82
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,083
[SCISSOR RUNNER roaring]

83
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,500
[STING] Nope! Figured I'd
just bring him with me!

84
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,458
You what?!

85
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:12,916
No worries dude,
he's super slow!

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,375
[ROGUE]
This isn't time for jokes!

87
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,750
[STING]
We're a team, aren't we?

88
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,416
Figured we should
take 'em on together!

89
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,875
[LEVIA] Scissor Runner.
This human has proven

90
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:23,250
difficult to subdue.
Give me your aid.

91
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,708
[SCISSOR RUNNER] I'm not
interested in taking one alive.

92
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,541
I plan to kill every
single human I can find!

93
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,333
We're the Twin Dragons, right?

94
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,666
So let's kick
their asses. C'mon!

95
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,541
[ROGUE gasps]
Let's go.

96
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,875
[ROGUE] That's right.
As long as I have Sting

97
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,666
watching my back,
nothing can touch me.

98
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:54,708
[ROGUE] If I'm destined
to be tainted by evil,

99
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:58,541
then at least I'll have his
light nearby to strike me down!

100

[SCISSOR RUNNER, LEVIA roaring]

My studly snowflake's

[GRAY] I don't know 'bout
you man, but I'm gettin'

107
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,208
sick and tired of
this underdog crap.

108
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,708
Let's take 'em out together!

109
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,458
Sounds good to me!

They just keep coming.

114
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,250
Come on, we should
fall back and take cover.

115
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,375
Gray, we have to go!

116
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,750
Yeah I get it!

[GRAY, LYON grunting]

118
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,875
Know what these
bastards have in common

119
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:10,000
with my wife? They're annoying!

120
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,000
[MACAO] I need you to
hang in there, okay buddy?

121
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,791
I know, Dad. I'm fine!

122
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,041
[MACAO] Damn it. Those things
are way tougher than they look.

123
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,291
[WAKABA]
And there's more comin'!

124
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,333
So what're we
gonna do about it?

125
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:31,083
What can we do?
They've got us surrounded.

126
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,333
You aren't really giving
up on us, are ya?

127
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,500
What?

128
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:35,833
[ROMEO] I asked you
if you're giving up!

129
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,458
Of course not! Don't be
foolish, listen to me!

130
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,333
Hey! I'm never gonna let
anything hurt you, son!

131
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:45,083
I don't need your
protection. I've grown up.

132
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:49,666
I'm strong. Just like you. I'm a
Fairy Tail wizard. I can fight!

[MACAO grunts]

134
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,708
[WAKABA]
Hate to interrupt guys!

135
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,500
But they tracked
us down. Incoming!

[ROMEO, MACAO grunting]

Are you okay?

138
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,291
I'm not finished yet.

139
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:10,000
I can keep this up
all day if I gotta.

140
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,333
I sure wish I could
say the same but...

141
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,500
I'm old.

142
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,541
[WAKABA]
Stop your whinin'.

143
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:19,666
Ya know, I'm gettin'
a little old for this too.

144
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,583
Damn it.

145

[ROCK DRAGON]
Is this Dragon Slayer Magic

146
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,416
you've been tickling me with?

147
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,083
[COBRA] I'm gonna
need ya to keep that

148

ugly mouth of yours shut.

149

You sound like a pack
of dying Vulcans,

150
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,083
and I have sensitive ears.

See, I'm in a great
mood now that

152
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,750
I've been busted out of prison.

153
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,708
And I'd like to take in as
many voices as possible.

Problem is, this lame
excuse for a boulder

keeps makin' noise!

Petulant insect!

157
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,291
[COBRA] Heard that comin'
from a mile away!

158
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,750
Better luck next time.

159
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,958
You shall not face
this threat alone!

160
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,833
[COBRA] Keep back where
you belong! Sideliner!

[ICHIYA groaning]

165
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:10,500
My patootie! You have disfigured
my most beautiful asset! Man!

166
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:14,833
[COBRA] And that's why I told
ya to keep to the sidelines.

167
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,375
[ROCK DRAGON roaring]

168
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:20,791
This ain't good. It doesn't
seem wounded at all.

169
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,250
[NATSU] I gotta admit,
you're tougher than I thought.

170
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,708
Bring it on!

171
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,708
[FUTURE ROGUE] You can't
stop me. My will is iron!

172
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:35,375
That ain't enough. 'Cause my
flames have shattered iron!

00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,708
[ULTEAR]
I stopped just short of murder.

174
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,625
[ULTEAR]
I didn't go through with it.

175
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:22,041
But that isn't the problem.

176
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,250
The fact is that
I would've done it.

177
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:29,500
Without a second thought, I
would've killed an innocent man!

178
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:33,458
Why would that be the first
place that my mind turns?

179
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,166
Unless some part of
me still craves it.

180
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:45,250
[ULTEAR] Who am I fooling?
I haven't changed a bit.

181
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:52,416
[ULTEAR]
Crime Sorcière? What a joke.

182
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,541
I could never atone
for the sins of my past.

183
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:08,000
Is anyone here? Hello?

ya old pervert!

That cocky attitude will only

00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,875
get you so far, little insect.

[ZIRCONIS cackling]

[LAXUS] If you're gonna go
around callin' people insects,

208
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,791
then you'd better be ready
to face the consequences!

[ZIRCONIS grunts] That's good.

There's way too many of them!

215

[JELLAL]
You're feeling overwhelmed?

216
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,833
Well this is a first.

217

I wouldn't call it that.

[JELLAL]
Good then.

219
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,000
Because if the two
of us come together...

[JELLAL] ...I know we
can take on anything!

[DROY] There's no way
I can walk like this.

Damn it! Pull yourself
together, let's go!

Don't let me weigh you down.

You have to get out
of here, right now!

find her for me.

This can't be for real.

It might be the worst

It's too dangerous!

we may have a shot at this!

[ELFMAN]
I don't think so.

266
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,791
You'd better get out of here and
support the rest of the guild!

00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,708
I've gotta find a way
to get you help!

311
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,083
[WAKABA]
Don't worry about us, Happy.

312
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,041
We old timers have been
in way bigger jams

313
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,666
than this one before.

314
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,000
You heard the man.

315
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,750
We don't need
anybody rescuin' us,

316
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,416
so get on outta here.

317
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,916
[HAPPY] No way! I'm not just
gonna ditch you guys!

318
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,291
We're Fairy Tail wizards.

319
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,083
And that means we can
take care of ourselves.

320
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,583
My dad knows what
he's talkin' about.

321
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,458
Are you sure, Romeo?

322
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,500
We're glad to be
a part of this.

323
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,916
[ROMEO] Natsu's giving it all
he's got. So is everyone else.

324
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,208
We wanna help!

325
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:41,791
If there ever was a time
to fight, it's now!

326
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:45,125
I understand.
Alright then, I'll go!

327
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,833
But you have to
make me a promise!

328
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,333
[WAKABA]
What kinda promise?

329
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,416
[HAPPY] The kind where
all of you stay alive!

330
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,208
That's the only way I'll leave!

331
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,625
Well, you drive a real
hard bargain, cat.

332
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,458
You've got yourself a deal.

333
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,458
Sure hope I wasn't lyin'.

334
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,833
What'd you say?

335
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,958
You just had to put
on the tough guy act

336
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,333
'cause your son's watchin', huh?

337
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,833
[ALL groaning]

338
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:27,916
[MELDY panting]
Juvia!

339
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,375
Meldy, it's you!

340
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,625
[MELDY] I lost track
of Ultear a while back!

341
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:32,750
Have you seen her?

342
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,583
[JUVIA]
I can't say I have.

343
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,500
[GRAY]
Get down!

344
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,000
[LYON]
Stay focused!

345
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,666
This is a war-zone!

346
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,541
[MELDY]
Sorry!

347
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,750
[JUVIA gasps] I can still feel
the warmth of Gray's hand

348
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,291
on my tushie!

349
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,458
[GRAY]
Juvia. Listen for a sec.

350
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:57,541
There's somethin'
I've been meaning

351
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,041
to tell ya for a while now.

352
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:03,500
Um. Whatever "something"
is, I'm ready to hear it!

353
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,125
[GRAY] I mean it's not
that big of a deal, but...

354
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,666
You never know. It might be
a really big deal for me!

355
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,500
Looks like this is about
to get really awkward.

356
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,958
[JUVIA] Could this be the
moment I've always dreamed of?

357
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,708
Will he confess his
love to me at last?

358
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,500
Oh my goodness.
What will I say?

359
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,125
Juvia! Move!

360
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:23,916
[JUVIA gasps]

361
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,166
[GRAY groans]

362
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,750
[LYON gasps]
[MELDY gasps]

363
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,000
[GRAY]
I'm hit.

364
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:10,250
[JUVIA screaming]
[LYON] Gray!

365
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:33,291
[ULTEAR]
I'm unfit for this world.

366
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:35,708
I don't deserve to live.

367
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:15,250
[NATSU] Damn! We haven't
taken down a single dragon yet!

368
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,083
[HAPPY]
We can't give up now, Natsu!

369
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:19,166
All our friends from
Fairy Tail and the other guilds

370
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,083
are riskin' their tails
to protect the kingdom!

371
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,625
We can't let 'em show us up!

372
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,541
[NATSU] Well yeah, I know!
Plus if I gave up now,

373
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:27,000
it would destroy
Fairy Tail's reputation!

374
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:29,083
[HAPPY] Yeah! We can't afford
to show any weakness

375
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:30,375
at a time like this!

376
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:32,041
[NATSU] We ain't givin' in,
no matter what!

377
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:34,375
[HAPPY] I'm gonna fight
my hardest just like you!

378
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,666
[HAPPY and NATSU]
Next time: Time of Life!

379
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,000
[NATSU]
We're almost there, Happy!

380
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:40,000
Let's give it one last push!

381
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,875
[HAPPY]
Aye, sir!
