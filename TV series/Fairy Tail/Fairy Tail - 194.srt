1
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:22,250
[HISUI] This is horrible.
What have I done?

2
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,583
The world is as good as dead!

3
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,500
[DARTON] You aren't to
blame for this, Princess!

4
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:29,541
The fault lies solely with
that scheming time-traveler!

5
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:32,875
[ARCADIOS] Your highness.
You need to leave.

6
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,666
You're in danger here.

7
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,708
No. I will remain. I have to.

8
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,833
I've come too far to run.

9
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,166
Wherever you are,
Dragon Slayers.

10
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,625
It's all up to you now.
Give them hell.

11
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,875
[FUTURE ROGUE cackling]
Give up, Natsu!

12
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:35,333
For you're as helpless as
any other pitiful human!

13
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,333
[NATSU] Guess I'll have
to quit being human.

14
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:39,416
It'd be worth it to stop you.

15
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,333
[FUTURE ROGUE]
You'll have to do it quickly!

16
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,041
Now, Mother Glare.

17
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,791
[NATSU gasps]

18
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,875
[LISANNA]
Hey, what are those?

19
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,375
I don't see anything.

20
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,250
"Mother" is right.

21
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,458
[LISANNA screams]

22
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,583
[ELFMAN]
What are these? Giant eggs?

23
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:07,166
[LISANNA]
So, uh, those things.

24
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,250
Those are Dragon
eggs, aren't they?

25
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,916
[ELFMAN] Don't worry,
they're not gonna hatch

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,875
right after they've been laid.

27
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,333
[LISANNA, ELFMAN gasp]

28
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,916
[ROMEO]
Aw, great. We're surrounded!

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,708
[MAVIS] Unfortunately,
the odds on this fight

30
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,500
are not in our favor.

31
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,458
[HAPPY]
Zirconis' Magic!

32
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,000
"Not gonna hatch," huh?

33
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,500
Look at all of them.
They've got an army!

34
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,708
[ROMEO] Dealing with one dragon
is tough enough as it is!

35
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:50,250
[ATLAS FLAME roars]

36
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,666
[BOTH]
It's Laxus!

37
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,958
[LAXUS] Quit gawking.
Or did you not notice

38
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:58,541
there are dragons to slay?
I'll take the big guy myself.

39
00:03:58,625 --> 00:03:59,958
[ROMEO]
You can't do it alone!

40
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,541
[FRIED]
He's not.

41
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,041
We've got his back.

42
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,166
[FRIED] The Thunder Legion
will handle this.

43
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,458
We'll leave all the
babies to you guys!

44
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,625
The rest of you, keep
away from the big ones.

45
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,416
Remember what Natsu told us.

46
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,833
Only Dragon Slayers
can beat them.

47
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,041
[MAVIS] Laxus,
Thunder Legion, good luck!

48
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,333
[ALL]
Right!

49
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,208
[MAVIS] Gajeel,
find another target.

50
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,541
You got it!

51
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,958
[MAVIS] Everyone else
focus on the little ones!

52
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:23,958
[ELFMAN]
Yes ma'am!

53
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,458
Understood, First Master.

54
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,875
All right! It's time
to go to work, people!

55
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:31,291
[LEVY] Gajeel! Let me help.
I can support you!

56
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,916
Don't worry 'bout me.
You'll have your hands full.

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,750
You should go and help any
stragglers get out of town.

58
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,708
Keep your guard up around
those ankle biters.

59
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,291
[LEVY sighs]
Okay, yeah.

60
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,791
[ELFMAN]
Don't go dyin'.

61
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,375
I don't need you to tell
me that, you big dummy.

62
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,958
[STING]
Rogue! I'll handle this one!

63
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,708
Go and check on
the other guilds.

64
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,000
We need to pick up
the slack for any of them

65
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:57,833
without a dragon slayer.

66
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,208
[ROGUE]
I'm on my way.

67
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:02,333
This is for Natsu. For
helping me find my courage!

68
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:11,208
Not that I was
scared to fight.

69
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,541
He gave me the courage to
stand up for all my friends.

70
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,125
[ROGUE]
The old Sabertooth is dead.

71
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:20,083
Tonight is the start
of a new era.

72
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:23,541
From now on, we're
moving forward!

73
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,125
[ROCK DRAGON cackling]

74
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,833
[ROCK DRAGON] That guy on top
of Mother Glare seems to be

75
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,416
pretty worked up
about something!

76
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,541
Man, not having any
Dragon Slayers in our guild

77
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,416
is really making
us look useless.

78
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,541
Tell me about it.
We can't even put up

79
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:38,916
any kinda fight here.

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,041
[REN] If we survive,
we're so recruiting one.

81
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:46,250
Step aside, boys. This guy
is gonna be all mine.

82
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:50,291
[JENNY] My! What a big,
strong, dragon you are!

83
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,791
Let Jenny smooth out
those rough edges for ya.

84
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,583
[ROCK DRAGON]
Scram, you filthy human!

85
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,708
[ICHIYA] Man. In that case,
have a whiff of this!

86
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,958
My most treasured parfum!
Prepare your nose holes!

87
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:05,250
[ALL coughing]
[ROCK DRAGON] What is this?

88
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,833
[EVE]
Ugh! That is ripe!

89
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,416
[HIBIKI]
My nose hairs are burning.

90
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,041
[REN]
So nasty!

91
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:13,708
[JENNY]
What sort of parfum is that?

92
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,500
The most pungent
of all. "Underarm."

93
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:17,875
[ALL groan]

94
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,708
[ICHIYA]
Marvelous, isn't it?

95
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,500
[EVE] That wasn't the
first word that came to mind.

96
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,416
[HIBIKI]
You've outdone yourself.

97
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,250
[REN] Only a true stud
would own up to that stench.

98
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,083
[JENNY]
Pure, concentrated, manliness.

99
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,666
[NICHIYA] That should
beat him. No sweat!

100
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,083
[ROCK DRAGON laughing] Dragons
have a strong sense of smell.

101
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,583
Except me. I don't have a nose!

102
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,583
[ICHIYA]
Man!

103
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,458
[ROCK DRAGON] You humans
are as foolish as always.

104
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:47,333
It's good to know
some things never change.

105
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:50,541
[ICHIYA] If we die,
we do it with style!

106
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:55,208
[ROCK DRAGON roaring]

107
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,500
[COBRA]
I can hear it.

108
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,750
I know him!

109
00:06:58,833 --> 00:06:59,875
[REN]
Cobra, right?

110
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,791
Oracion. At least,
he used to be one.

111
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,583
[ROCK DRAGON roaring]

112
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:07,291
[ICHIYA]
But right now, he's an asset!

113
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:08,666
[COBRA]
I can hear it.

114
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,000
All the screams of
confusion and despair!

115
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:16,125
What a sweet melody.
Now get lost sideliners!

116
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,250
Sideliners?

117
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,625
How about a whiff
of my litter box?

118
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:20,833
What's the deal?

119
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,375
You don't owe us any
special favors, buddy!

120
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,666
Yeah, why are
you even here?

121
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,250
You should be in jail!

122
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,041
[REN] Damn straight.
Considering the hell

123
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,541
your pals put us through.

124
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,500
I'm not sure I want your help.

125
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,166
Why the change
of heart, anyway?

126
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,916
[JENNY] Oh, I know.
You saw my twin tigers

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,958
and wanted a chance
to tame them.

128
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:43,083
Keep playing nice and maybe
you'll get a cuddle or two.

129
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,625
Would you shut up top-heavy?

130
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:49,125
Unless you wanna die.
In which case, keep talkin'!

131
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,916
[HIBIKI]
He hasn't changed, has he?

132
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,708
[JENNY]
What a creep.

133
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,375
[ICHIYA]
Man. It is peculiar, though.

134
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:59,166
I was certain Cobra was
under lock and key for good.

135
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,458
[DORANBOLT]
You know, I could be wrong, but,

136
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:04,166
I think this is the dumbest
thing we've ever done.

137
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,166
Let's hope we only
lose our jobs.

138
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,875
Worry about the future later.

139
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,791
At least, not until
we've re-shaped it.

140
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,166
You're the boss.

141
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,791
[LAHAR]
Now then. Let's join the fray!

142
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,708
[DORANBOLT]
You heard the man!

143
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:21,458
Oh, and a bit of advice.
Avoid the mouth end.

144
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:25,083
Crackin' jokes?
What's next, Lahar? A song?

145
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,958
[ROCK DRAGON roaring]

146
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,208
[COBRA]
That's one grating howl.

147
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,541
I could really do
without that in my ears.

148
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:37,458
[KINANA] That voice.
Erik? It couldn't be.

149
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,625
[LEVY] Please keep moving!
You'll be safe on higher ground!

150
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,000
We'll take a break soon!

151
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,625
After that, we'll be
going over the mountain!

152
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:53,875
[KINANA] He's fighting too!
My Erik. He's really here!

153
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,083
[NATSU]
Get it now, chump?

154
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,458
As long as everybody
is working together.

155
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,791
There ain't a fight

Well! Hello, ladies.

Ah? You're a real cutie-pie.

312
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,291
[FUTURE ROGUE] Heh. You still
refuse to stay down.

313
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,333
Guess I'll just have
to kill you then.

314
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,833
Consider it mercy.

315
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,458
[NATSU growls]

316
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,041
[LUCY]
Natsu!

317
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,833
[NATSU]
S'that. Lucy?

318
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,958
[LUCY]
Catch me! Catch me!

319
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,750
[NATSU, LUCY screaming]

320
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:03,000
[HAPPY]
Hey, wait up!

321
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,000
[FUTURE ROGUE]
Uh...

322
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:10,541
[LUCY, NATSU screaming]

323
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,250
Dammit, Lucy, this
is hardly the time

324
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,333
to seduce the guy!

325
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:14,541
Shut up!

326
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:15,750
Will you stop wiggling?

327
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,250
All this spinning's
gonna make me hurl!

328
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,625
[LUCY]
I'm trying, but I--

329
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,916
[NATSU]
There's enough butt in here!

330
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:32,416
[LUCY, NATSU screaming]

331
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,083
[NATSU groaning]

332
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,125
[LUCY]
Can this day be over now?

333
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,625
My head. I'm still
seein' stars here.

334
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,500
[LUCY] And my ears
are still ringing.

335
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,625
[NATSU]
What's your deal?

336
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:43,958
[LUCY shrieks]

337
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,625
I'm startin' to think that
you like fightin' naked.

338
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,791
[LUCY groans]
Don't stare at me!

339
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:53,333
[NATSU] Ah, for cryin' out--
Fine, I'll cover them.

340
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,791
[NATSU screams]

341
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,708
Pervert! You were supposed
to cover your eyes instead!

342
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:01,750
[HAPPY] Uh-oh. Sorry buddy,
did I come at a bad time?

343
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,791
[NATSU]
Very funny! Don't blame me!

344
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,833
Blame Fairy Tail's
resident flasher,

345
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,125
"Lucy Heart-Feel-Me-Up!"

346
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:10,333
[LUCY] Cork it, jerk!
A dragon did this, FYI!

347
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,791
Where's your sympathy?

348
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,625
[HAPPY] Here, Lucy.
I grabbed your keys.

349
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,875
[LUCY]
At least someone is considerate.

350
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:17,958
[LUCY]
What's up?

351
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,625
[HAPPY]
Oh, did you wanna see more?

352
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,041
[LUCY]
Shut it, cat!

353
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,500
I saw enough.

354
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,458
[HAPPY] Let me guess.
That Rogue up there's

355
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,000
giving you more trouble
than you thought he would.

356
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:30,041
[NATSU] No, he ain't
that tough! I can take him.

357
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,125
But how?

358
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:37,916
[NATSU] He's definitely
strong. No doubt there.

359
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,291
And that dragon he's riding
isn't playin' around either.

360
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,666
[HAPPY]
I know.

361
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,375
I wouldn't say that
any of these dragons

362
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,333
are necessarily
"playing around."

363
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:51,208
They're all out for blood.
Or whatever they can get.

364
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:54,500
You saw what Zirconis
did. He stripped me!

365
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,750
Then he tried to make
me an hors d'oeuvre.

366
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,500
[NATSU]
They've got an appetite, huh?

367
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,833
[LUCY]
Uh... What?

368
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,583
[NATSU] That's it!
[LUCY] Huh?

369
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,791
[NATSU] I figured out
how to take 'em down!

370
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:15,375
This'll be awesome! It may
be my best idea ever!

371
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,250
[LUCY] Pervert!
[NATSU screams]

372
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,458
[MALE WIZARD 194A]
We're screwed!

373
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,083
[MALE WIZARD 194B]
There's no end to 'em!

374
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,625
[MALE WIZARD 194C]
They just keep coming!

375
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,875
[GINGER cackling]
I may have gotten knocked out

376
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,333
of the Grand Magic Games'
preliminary round.

377
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,750
But now I finally
have the chance

378
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,083
to show off and
get some action!

379
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,916
Yeah! Yeah!

380
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,416
[GINGER laughing]
[WIZARDS cheering]

381
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,416
[MALE WIZARD 194A]
Hey, girl! Not too shabby!

382
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,291
[GINGER] There's a feisty
new kitten on the scene!

383
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,750
Twilight Ogre's cutest.
The Idol of Ice and Fire.

384
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,083
The one and only,
Mattan Ginger!

385
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,958
Twilight Ogre's helping too?

386
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,500
This is nuts.
What'll happen next?

387
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,500
[ELFMAN grunts]
Quit spacin' out, Romeo!

388
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,125
You're a man, aren't ya?

389
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,625
[ROMEO]
Uh, yeah!

390
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:15,791
[GAJEEL]
Iron Dragon Club!

391
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,708
No dice. You're a tough
'ol sucker, ain'tcha?

392
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,250
[ERZA grunting]

393
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,750
[ERZA] Not good.
I'm all alone out here.

394
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:38,583
[ERZA] My foot's broken,
so running is out.

395
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:41,166
I really did push
myself too far.

396
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,166
I'm pathetic.

397
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,916
Maybe you should rest.
Like we've been telling you!

398
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,250
We can handle this ourselves.

399
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,208
Don't worry about me.
This is nothing.

400
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,166
I can still fight!

401
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,750
[ERZA] Is it impossible for me
to show any sign of weakness?

402
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,416
I know full well
that that's not

403
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,708
what makes a person
strong, and yet...

404
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,000
[ERZA]
I guess this is it.

405
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,625
[JELLAL]
It looks like you barely

406
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,416
have the strength to stand.

407
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:25,041
If I didn't know better, I'd say
you overexerted yourself again.

408
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,666
I hope this doesn't offend you.

409
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,958
But let me give you a hand.

410
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,041
[ERZA]
Thank you.

411
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,375
Millianna, it's you.

412
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,875
Quite a fashion statement.

413
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,500
Are you doing a
boudoir shoot, Princess?

414
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:58,000
No time for jokes.
It's an emergency!

415
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,250
I need some
new clothes, pronto.

416
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,083
I think she's fine as is.

417
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,958
That's what I said. But...

418
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,166
[HAPPY]
She didn't listen.

419
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,333
Of course not.

420
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,125
I'm not saving the world
in a table-cloth!

421
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,833
I may have something that will
suit your needs, Princess.

422
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,166
It's the latest craze
in the celestial world.

423
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,666
When I tried one on for size,

424
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,083
it actually brought
Big Brother to tears.

425
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,291
[LUCY] Why does that
make me nervous?

426
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,583
[NATSU]
Lucy! I'm goin' on ahead!

427
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,500
Throw the thing
on and catch up!

428
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,166
[LUCY] It won't take me
that long to change! Jeez!

429
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,208
You know that's a big fat lie.

430
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,000
Girls take forever
getting dressed!

431
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,916
If we wait, we'll probably miss
the best part of the fight!

432
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,041
Oh yeah, screw that
noise! See you later!

433
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,000
Ugh. Thanks guys.

434
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,958
Please take care out there.

435
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,500
[LUCY]
What is this thing anyway?

436
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,541
I can barely get it on!

437
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,875
[VIRGO] I heard you were
in the middle of a battle.

438
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,833
So I chose something
nice and snug.

439
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,791
You're so oblivious.

440
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,291
[VIRGO]
Why, thank you.

441
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,833
[HAPPY] Are you sure
this is gonna work?

442
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,916
Leave it to me!
I'll manage somehow!

443
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,500
[HAPPY]
That's your plan?

444
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,375
[LUCY] As usual. Natsu's
plan involves rushing in

445
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:01,833
without a strategy.

446
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,416
[VIRGO]
Does that mean punishment?

447
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,250
Then again. Whenever things
get this out of control,

448
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,958
I can always count on him.
He'll pull through.

449
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,750
Well, you are close enough
to play with him in the nude.

450
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:14,833
Knock it off! Is that--?

451
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,083
[LUCY] My diary. But,
what's it doing out here?

452
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,333
[VIRGO] It must be chock
full of embarrassing secrets

453
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,750
and fantasies for you
to throw it away like that.

454
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,583
I can keep it
safe for you, Princess.

455
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,958
[LUCY]
Seriously, it's not like that!

456
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:33,500
'Kay, this is weird.
Why is it lying here?

457
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:36,666
Hold on. No way.

458
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,166
It's the diary that
belonged to my future self.

459
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,833
[HAPPY] Natsu. What is
this strategy you have

460
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,375
for beating Future Rogue?

461
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:17,958
[NATSU] You'll just
have to wait and see!

462
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,791
[HAPPY] Yeah, right! I bet
you don't have a plan at all.

463
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,458
That's how you've always been!

464
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:25,000
[NATSU] Wow, thanks! Is that
really how you see me?

465
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,458
[HAPPY] Be honest.
Have you ever once

466
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:28,166
seriously thought
things through?

467
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:32,125
[NATSU] Of course I have! Maybe.
Wait, what was the question?

468
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:34,208
[NATSU and HAPPY]
Next time: People and People,

469
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:36,208
Dragons and Dragons,
People and Dragons!

470
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:38,666
[NATSU] I've thought things
through this time, I swear!

471
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,875
[HAPPY]
Are you sure?
