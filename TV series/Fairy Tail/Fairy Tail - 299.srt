1
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:22,125
What is she doing?

2
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,166
Her power's incredible!

3
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,666
[DIMARIA]
My ultimate spell.

4
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,291
Take Over God Soul.

5
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:39,875
[gasps]

6
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:42,083
The strength of a god?

7
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:20,500
You can unlock a source of
magic known as the Third Origin.

8
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,416
This technique will
allow you to access

9
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,416
all the power you have
the potential to gain

10
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,958
throughout your life.

11
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:29,000
But once you tap into that
power, it'll be gone forever.

12
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,833
You will never be able
to use magic again.

13
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:35,250
The ether-nano in your body will
be completely extinguished.

14
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,916
It cannot be regenerated.

15
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,375
I know it's a difficult
decision to make.

16
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:43,375
However, to stand any
chance of beating her,

17
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,000
this is the option you have.

18
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,250
If that's what it takes.

19
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,125
Okay!

20
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,708
[gasps]

21
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,125
I'd anticipated you would both
have strong reactions to this,

22
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,333
but there's a caveat.

23
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,333
I can only do this
for one of you,

24
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:58,250
the other must keep her
magic to heal Carla.

25
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,666
Make sure that she's okay.

26
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,375
That's your job.

27
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,916
I know! Which is exactly why
I have to fight for her now.

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,208
Let me!

29
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:07,958
I think it's why you need
to keep your magic.

30
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,583
So you can heal her and
fight together another day.

31
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:11,833
[WENDY]
But if you do this,

32
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,291
you'll never be able to
use magic ever again!

33
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,708
[SHELIA] Yeah, and it's the
same for you, you know!

34
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,458
I came out here today
because I wanted to help you!

35
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,625
If you lost your magic,
I would never forgive myself!

36
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,708
I'm ready to make
the sacrifice, Ultear!

37
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,750
And you're sure? This is
what you truly want?

38
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,833
If this is what it takes to save
my friends, then I'll do it.

39
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,625
Don't throw it away for me!

40
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,625
[DIMARIA]
What are you quarreling about?

41
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:36,666
[WENDY]
She's coming!

42
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,291
Come on, Ultear, I'm ready!

43
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,875
All right then. Here goes!

44
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,375
[WENDY yells]

45
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,583
I'll take care of her!

46
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,791
[WENDY]
Sky Dragon Talon!

47
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,208
Hearken to my voice.

48
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:05,375
I am a god who has
control over time itself.

49
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,750
And time remembers all the
pain that's been inflicted

50
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,500
on your body over the years.

51
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,041
[screaming]

52
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,750
[DIMARIA]
Age Scratch!

53
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,083
[screaming continues]

54
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,375
[WENDY]
What's happening?

55
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,250
I've never felt pain like this!

56
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,500
Please don't do this.

57
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,458
You've gotta stop
before it's too late!

58
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,750
Before Wendy's used up
all of her magic power!

59
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,666
[WENDY] But if this is what
it takes to save my friends,

60
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,125
so be it!

61
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,875
You've made a grave mistake.

62
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,333
Do you not understand the folly

63
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,458
of a mortal trying
to touch a god?

64
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:42,500
[screaming]

65
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,125
[WENDY]
What's going on?

66
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,333
How can I already be
running out of strength?

67
00:04:57,125 --> 00:05:00,791
[WENDY] Has my Third Origin
not been fully released yet?

68
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:07,000
Now pierce... to the
very end of time.

69
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,875
[WENDY]
I'm so weak.

70
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,750
But I gotta move!

71
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:16,708
[WENDY gasps]

72
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,000
[gasps]

73
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,666
Shelia?

74
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,250
[ULTEAR]
I made it... just in time.

75
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,833
I'll be handling
this one, Wendy.

76
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,666
There's no way I'm gonna lose.

77
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,625
Huh?

78
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:31,916
[SHELIA]
Sorry.

79
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,083
But we needed you to
buy us a little more time

80
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,916
while she used the Third
Origin spell on me.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,750
Is that true?

82
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,583
Shelia and I both agreed
that this was for the best.

83
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,375
It was her idea?

84
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,333
You and I both know
Fairy Tail's battle

85
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,750
won't be over after this!

86
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,083
Which means Wendy is gonna need

87
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,125
all the power she can
get in the future!

88
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,375
So if there's still time,

89
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:58,125
I want you to use your
technique on me instead!

90
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,583
We're fighting a god, so we have
a better chance at winning

91
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,416
if you make me stronger!

92
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,375
All I want is for
everyone to survive this,

93
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:07,500
so please use the
Third Origin on me!

94
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,833
[WENDY]
No.

95
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,291
[SHELIA]
This'll be my final performance,

96
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,000
and I've never felt better.

97
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:17,208
Because I'm happy to
fight for my friends!

98
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,125
[DIMARIA grunts]

99
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,666
Hubris!

100
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,291
How dare you defy a god!

101
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,500
[SHELIA grunts]

102
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,291
[SHELIA] The only thing
I'm defying is evil!

103
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,041
But the fact that you're a god
is actually good for me,

104
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:38,208
because my power works best
against people like you.

105
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,916
It's God Slayer magic!

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,625
So that power is real?

107
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,458
I thought she was just bluffing!

108
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,791
She's losing grasp
over her God Soul!

109
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,333
Curse you!

110
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,000
But how?

111
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,583
I hit her with
everything I have.

112
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:55,958
An enchantment?

113
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,458
[SHELIA] I've screwed up
a lot of stuff in my life.

114
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:01,791
But there's one thing that
I've always been good at.

115
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,208
Magic.

116
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,458
Thanks to magic, I've met
so many wonderful people,

117
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,750
and gone on tons of adventures.

118
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:13,750
I love it so much,
and I know I always will.

119
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,125
Hang on, please.

120
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,708
[SHELIA] Even though
that will never change,

121
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,166
I'll have to go back
to an ordinary world,

122
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,833
where I'm just a regular person.

123
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:28,833
[SHELIA] This'll be the
last spell I'll ever use!

124
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,000
I swear to you!

125
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,708
I swear I'll always
be your friend!

126
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,250
And you'll be mine.

127
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,250
[yells]

128
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,041
[SHELIA] Everything I've
been through has taught me

129
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:10,625
what's really important
in this life.

130

[DIMARIA screams]

132
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:25,791
[DIMARIA] My world...
is crumbling around me.

133
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,541
It's over.

134
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,000
No! Shelia!

135
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,791
[SHELIA]
Hurry. Help Carla.

136
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,416
[swords clanging]

137
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,125
[WENDY]
Time's moving again!

138
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,708
Carla!

139
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,625
I'm using my healing magic on
you, so you're gonna be okay!

140
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:48,916
[CARLA groans]

141
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,916
[coughing]

142
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,833
[CARLA]
Hm?

143
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,333
What's wrong?

144
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:56,625
Why in the world are you
crying this time, Wendy?

145
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,083
Because I feel bad.

146
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,416
It's all my fault.

147
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,458
I wanted to help Shelia.

148
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:09,125
That's the main reason I even
wanted to come here, but now--

149
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,333
Did I miss something?

150
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:16,000
Hold on a sec.
Where did Ultear go?

151
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:19,208
[SHELIA] It's okay,
Wendy. Please don't cry.

152
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,833
I'll be perfectly fine
living a normal life.

153
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:27,750
'Cause love is a whole
lot better than magic.

154
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:38,333
[ULTEAR]
Those girls, they're so strong.

155
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:41,166
If only I could've experienced
a love that powerful

156
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,416
when I was their tender age.

157
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,416
Poor guy.

158
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,541
It's okay. He'll wake
up before too long.

159
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,041
You're right.

160
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,083
Another Spriggan
Twelve's off the radar.

161
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,583

He realized that our movements
were being watched,

Perhaps there's no

00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,208
[JACOB]
When the feeling strikes you,

322
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,125
I suggest you'd surrender.

323
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:58,250
Otherwise, she might just
be a pretty blonde head!

324
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,750
[MAVIS]
Lucy! Get out of the way!

325
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,000
[gasps]

326
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,250
[NATSU]
Even if she was just a head,

327
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,750
she'd still be our friend Lucy!

328
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,458
[gasps]

329
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,458
[NATSU] But since you
threatened her like that,

330
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:23,083
I'm gonna have to turn you
into a pile of ashes.

331
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,166
Natsu!

332
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,583
I knew he'd be okay!

333
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,333
I hope you had a nice nap.

334
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,833
Oh, yeah. Now I've got
a fire in my belly.

335
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,458
[NATSU]
Let's go!

336
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,750
[NATSU yells]

337
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,625
Flames, eh?

338
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,208
I'm fired up!

339
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,875
Hey, man, don't go
stealin' my line!

340
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,958
[JACOB groans]

341
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,708
And would you stop tearin'
up our damn guild hall?

342
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:02,333
What the--? He disappeared!

343
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,541
[HAPPY]
Uh-oh! Where'd he go?

344
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,333
[LUCY] Can you not even
smell him anywhere?

345
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:08,416
[NATSU sniffs]

346
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,875
[NATSU]
No! It's like he doesn't exist!

347
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,833
Here I am.

348
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:13,958
[growls]

349
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,625
[NATSU]
Uh! He's gone again? Damn it!

350
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,291
It's stealth magic.

351
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:21,541
He can make himself
completely invisible.

352
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:22,666
First Master!

353
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,875
But it's a bit more
than that, innit?

354
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,333
I can also see things
that are invisible.

355
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:30,041
Your friendly ghost,
for example.

356
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,916
[NATSU]
Don't you dare touch her!

357
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,083
He's not going anywhere.

358
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,125
He's just using a
camouflage spell!

359
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,708
Which means he's still here!

360
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,541
Loke!

361
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,458
[LOKE]
Lion Radiance!

362
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:41,666
Now what?

363
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,208
I see you!

364
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,083
This guy might be a problem.

365
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,666
[LOKE yells]

366
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,791
Loke!

367
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,833
That hurt. What'd you do?

368
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,625
[yells]

369
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,208
[screams]

370
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,875
Not good.

371
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,916
His weapon's invisible.

372
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,375
I hide and see all.

373
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,458
I send away and snuff out.

374
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,666
Those are the things
my magic can do.

375
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,291
Stop! You're hurting me!

376
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,166
[NATSU
Lucy!

377
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,250
You blocked because you thought

378
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,958
I was throwing something
at you, right?

379
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,916
I was actually crackin'
me whip behind me.

380
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,916
[MAVIS] This level of
power is what I'd expect

381
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,500
from one of Zeref's
Twelve shields.

382
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,958
Well, you can watch
me punch you!

383
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:32,541
Natsu!

384
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,541
If you wanna know
what hell's like,

385
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,375
I'd be happy to show
you firsthand.

386
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:40,875
[JACOB]
Now pay close attention

387
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:43,500
to the young lady
in front of you.

388
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,708
[LUCY gasps]

389
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:50,666
[gasps]

390
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,791
[grumbles]

391
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:53,916
Hey, wait!

392
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,375
What's going on? Why me?

393
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,750
[JACOB]
How do you like that?

394
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,916
I made her clothes invisible!

395
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,250
[NATSU]
Heh...?

396
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,750
[LUCY] Cut it out!
Turn them back to normal!

397
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,333
Uh, how about making
them invisible forever?

398
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,625
[LUCY]
Okay, I am closing your gate!

399
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,666
[JACOB] Now, this is
hell, don't you think?

400
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,583
Yeah, it is for me!

401
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,166
You've got a pretty weird
concept of hell, buddy.

402
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,833
[JACOB] What do you
mean by that, mate?

403
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,541
There's a half-naked girl
squirming in front of you!

404
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,958
Don't you feel tormented?
Embarrassed?

405
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,333
I mean, do you look away,
or not look away?

406
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,916
It has to be hellish!

407
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,208
I dunno, it's not like she
wears that much anyway.

408
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,416
[LUCY] I wear clothes
all the time, Natsu!

409
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,166
[JACOB] You're saying this
doesn't bother you

410
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,333
in the slightest?

411
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,833
[gasps]

412
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,541
[LUCY]
I'm a little bit confused here.

413
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,125
[JACOB grunts]

414
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,291
[LUCY]
What's wrong with your face?

415
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,625
It's obvious!

416
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:48,791
I mean, I can't just look
at you like that, can I?

417
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,041
This technique is something
like a double-edged sword,

418
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,958
because it puts me and
my target both through

419
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,416
an incredible amount
of anguish and torture!

420
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,333
[LUCY]
Uhh...

421
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:58,916
[snickers]

422
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,041
No, Lucy, please don't take your
underwear and stuff off, too!

423
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,083
Oh, no, don't make us
see your boobies!

424
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,833
No!

425
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,500
I think we should
play along with him!

426
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:10,125
Yeah, guess you're right.

427
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,875
My god! What kinda
sick people are you?

428
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,708
You'd really strip
in front of us!

429
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,125
[NATSU]
Whoa! Lucy, you're butt naked!

430
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,666
[LUCY]
Who cares? It's just skin!

431
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,375
I'm not afraid to
show off what I've got!

432
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:23,625
It's all so indecent!

433
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,833
[NATSU]
Holy crap! These are super soft!

434
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,291
[LUCY]
Oh, yeah! Don't stop, Natsu!

435
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:31,541
You're both so depraved
and terribly lewd!

436
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,583
[MAVIS]
That's it!

437
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:36,666
[JACOB] Enough! I'll just get
straight to the killin'!

438
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:38,708
[gasps]

439
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,375

--[LUCY] ...Lucy Kick!
--[NATSU] ...Talon!

442
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,666
[HAPPY, NATSU laughs]

443
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,625
You brats.

444
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,708
You've made this
grown-up very angry!

445
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,375
[MAVIS]
I know what to do now!

446
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:05,750
How we can take down Zeref!

447
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,541
[LUCY]
In the middle of the guild hall,

448
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:42,541
we found a way to make the
assassin lose his focus.

449
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:43,750
But unfortunately,

450
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,916
that unleashes the full
force of his anger.

451
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,291
Changing tactics,
he decides to target

452
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:49,833
all the Fairy Tail
members trapped

453
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:52,041
in his weird,
alternate dimension.

454
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,916
Meanwhile, down in the south,

455
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,750
Hargeon is thrust
under a shadowy cloud

456
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:59,250
as a new enemy enters the fray.

457
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:02,125
Next Time:
"Historia of Corpses."

458
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:05,250
A dark threat looms
over the battlefield.
