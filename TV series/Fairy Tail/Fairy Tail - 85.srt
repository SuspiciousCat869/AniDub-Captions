1
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:21,083
- HAPPY AND I ARE EXCEEDS.
THE ONLY RACE IN EDOLAS

2
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:24,166
THAT'S BORN WITH MAGIC POWER
PULSING THROUGH OUR VEINS.

3
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,000
THE ONLY REASON WE COULDN'T
USE OUR MAGIC BEFORE,

4
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,916
WAS BECAUSE WE'D LOST
ALL SENSE OF WHO WE WERE.

5
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:38,458
LET'S GO. WE CAN'T KEEP EVERYONE
WAITING. - RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

6
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:40,875
- ( theme song playing )

7
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:58,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

8
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,833
- ( Byro chuckles )

9
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:15,250
IT'S AS THE LEGENDS FORETOLD.

10
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,750
WE HAVE PROVEN BEYOND
A REASONABLE DOUBT

11
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:20,125
THAT THE MAGIC THE EARTH LAND
WIZARDS POSSESS,

12
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,375
COMES FROM WITHIN
THEIR VERY BODIES.

13
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:26,375
- HMM. THEY'RE MUCH LIKE
THE EXCEEDS IN THAT REGARD.

14
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,625
- CAREFUL NOT TO INFLATE
THEIR ABILITIES.

15
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:31,625
THE EXCEEDS ARE FAR
MORE POWERFUL.

16
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,500
- HMM.
- HOLD ON.

17
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,666
YOU MEAN EVEN THAT LUCY GIRL
IS LIKE THAT?

18
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,500
SHE HAS MAGIC INSIDE OF HER,
TOO? - INDEED, SHE DOES.

19
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:42,250
- THEN WE GOTTA, LIKE,
KEEP HER ALIVE, RIGHT, OLD MAN?

20
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,958
- SHE MUST BE TERMINATED.

21
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,958
THE EXCEEDS' QUEEN CHAGOT
HAS GIVEN EXPLICIT ORDERS.

22
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:51,083
ANY DISCUSSION TO THE CONTRARY
IS A WASTE OF TIME AND BREATH.

23
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,333
- THE ORDER CAME FROM
THE QUEEN HERSELF?

24
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,583
- HMM. THEN IT'S SETTLED.

25
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,000
WE CANNOT DEFY
THE WILL OF THE EXCEEDS.

26
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:03,500
- MAN. BUT THIS IS LIKE, SUCH
A HUMUNGOUS WASTE, YA KNOW?

27
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,583
- HOWEVER, OUR TECHNOLOGY
IS LACKING AT THE MOMENT.

28
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:10,041
WE HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO
PERFORM A MAGIC EXTRACTION

29
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,583
FROM A HUMAN BODY.

30
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,458
- SO, THEN, WHAT
SHALL WE DO WITH

31
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:16,041
THE TWO DRAGON SLAYERS, SIR?

32
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,166
- THOSE TWO ARE NOT QUITE HUMAN.

33
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,000
THEY ARE MORE OF A STRANGE
HUMAN AMALGAM.

34
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,916
SUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENTS
WITH THEM COULD ONE DAY

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,541
DELIVER US
EVERLASTING MAGIC POWER.

36
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:27,750
- ( laughs )

37
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,750
NOW, THAT'S COOL.
- YEAH, TOTALLY COOL.

38
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:35,500
- VERY WELL, BYRO. YOU SHOULD
HAVE MUCH WORK TO DO. - INDEED.

39
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,916
- AND AS AN ADDED
PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE,

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
BEGIN EXTRACTING
THE MAGIC ENERGY

41
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,500
FROM THE EARTH LAND
LACRIMA IMMEDIATELY.

42
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:43,583
- RIGHT AWAY.

43
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,541
- IT TOTALLY BLOWS MY MIND

44
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,666
TO THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE OUR
OWN MAGIC POWER.

45
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,041
IT'S GONNA RULE.

46
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,958
- HMM-MM.
IT IS AN AMAZING THOUGHT.

47
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,625
- HOW ARE YOU GONNA
CELEBRATE, SUGARBOY?

48
00:03:56,708 --> 00:04:00,083
- HMM, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO CONQUER MAGIC SURFING.

49
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,416
- Coco: OH, ME, TOO.

50
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,166
- IS THERE SOMETHING
TROUBLING YOU, PANTHERLILY?

51
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,541
- MY LORD, IF I MAY ASK ABOUT
THIS RECENT SURGE

52
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,833
IN OUR ARMAMENTS...

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,333
I SEE. PLEASE EXCUSE ME.

54
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,666
- Happy: CODE ETD.

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,541
- IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE IT ALL.

56
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:44,916
HAPPY AND CARLA ARE CREATURES
CALLED EXCEEDS.

57
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,583
AND EXCEEDS ARE KINDA LIKE
ANGELS IN THIS WORLD.

58
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:50,666
THEY'RE ABOVE THE HUMANS.

59
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,041
THAT MEANS THEIR
QUEEN IS LIKE A GOD.

60
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:56,208
SHE HAS ABSOLUTE
CONTROL OVER ALL OF IT.

61
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,416
HER WORD IS NEVER QUESTIONED
OR CHALLENGED.

62
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,000
SHE HAS FINAL SAY OVER
WHO LIVES OR DIES IN EDOLAS.

63
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:08,041
ONE BEING WITH THAT MUCH POWER.
THE WHOLE THING IS CRAZY.

64
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,458
HOW COULD ANYONE CHOOSE
TO LIVE LIKE THIS?

65
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,416
- MY, YOU'VE DONE RESEARCH
ON OUR WORLD.

66
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,333
AND YOU'RE VERY THOROUGH.

67
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,791
- ( gasps )

68
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:27,583
ERZA? IS EVERYBODY ELSE OKAY?

69
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,875
- YES. THEY'RE ALL QUITE SAFE.

70
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,958
- ( sighing ) WHAT A RELIEF.

71
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,666
- YOUR ATTITUDE IS PUZZLING
TO SAY THE LEAST.

72
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,958
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THE SITUATION YOU'RE IN?

73
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,291
IT'S FAR FROM ENVIOUS.

74
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,333
- YEAH. YOU HAVE A POINT THERE.

75
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,625
IT'S JUST, YOU LOOK
AND SOUND EXACTLY LIKE

76
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,250
THE ERZA THAT I KNOW.

77
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:50,666
SO, I GUESS, I AUTOMATICALLY
LET MY GUARD DOWN FOR A MINUTE.

78
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,500
- YOU MEAN
MY EARTH LAND DOPPELGANGER?

79
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,791
- AND IN MY WORLD,
YOU'RE ONE OF THE STRONGEST

80
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,500
AND MOST LOYAL MEMBERS
OF FAIRY TAIL WE'VE EVER HAD.

81
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,416
- IS THAT TRUE?

82
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,125
- YOU'RE POWERFUL, COOL,
AND COLLECTED.

83
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,833
AND A LITTLE SCARY THERE, TOO.

84
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:07,000
BUT EVERYBODY IN THE GUILD
TRUSTS YOU WITH THEIR LIVES.

85
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,500
YOU LOVE CAKE.

86
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,375
AND YOU HAVE, LIKE, A MILLION
OUTFITS THAT YOU'LL WEAR.

87
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,125
SOMETIMES IT'S KINDA SURPRISING
HOW GIRLY YOU CAN BE.

88
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,041
ONE TIME...

89
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,916
( yelps )

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,041
( grunting )

91
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,875
- I'VE HEARD MORE THAN ENOUGH.

92
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,583
OBVIOUSLY, I'M NOT THE
ERZA THAT YOU KNOW.

93
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,166
- ( cries )

94
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,416
- PLEASE. LISTEN.
YOU AND I AREN'T ENEMIES.

95
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,166
ALL I AM TRYING TO DO HERE
IS SAVE MY FRIENDS' LIVES.

96
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,416
LOOK, ERZA, I KNOW
YOU'RE NOT THE SAME PERSON.

97
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,208
BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT
YOU HAVE A HEART.

98
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,916
YOU CAN'T BE SOMEONE THAT LAUGHS
AT SOMEONE ELSE'S SUFFERING.

99
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,375
- SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

100
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,750
- ( screams )

101
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,625
- PLEASE, ERZA.

102
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,416
- I HOPE YOU'VE MADE YOUR PEACE.

103
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,208
- HOW COULD YOU DO THIS
TO SOMEONE WHO WASN'T

104
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,708
EVEN FIGHTING BACK?
THE ERZA THAT I KNOW IS KIND.

105
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,375
SHE'D NEVER HURT
A DEFENSELESS PERSON.

106
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,666
- ( chuckles )

107
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,041
I THOUGHT I MADE MYSELF CLEAR.
I AM NOT HER.

108
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,458
I ENJOY WATCHING OTHERS
WRITHE IN AGONY.

109
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,291
I'VE EARNED MY TITLE
AS THE FAIRY HUNTER.

110
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:20,375
NO ONE HAS KILLED MORE FAIRY
TAIL WIZARDS THAN I HAVE.

111
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:26,291
- NO, YOU CAN'T SAY THAT.
NOT WITH ERZA'S VOICE.

112
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,083
NOT WITH ERZA'S FACE.

113
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,208
- THEN, I'LL SIMPLY SAY GOODBYE.

114
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,541
- ( screams )

115
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,291
- Happy: LUCY!

116
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,833
- Lucy: HAPPY! CARLA!

117
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,041
- THOSE EXCEEDS.

118
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,333
- EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE OKAY.

119
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,500
ME AND CARLA CAME
BACK TO SAVE YOU.

120
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,333
( screams )

121
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,125
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

122
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,416
HOLD ON. HOW COME YOUR
WINGS ARE WORKING AGAIN?

123
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,041
- OUR WINGS WERE FINE,
BUT OUR HEARTS WERE WEAK.

124
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,541
- ( embarrassed chuckle )

125
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,166
I GUESS I HAVEN'T TOTALLY GOTTEN
THE HANG OF FLYING AGAIN.

126
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:11,416
- BUT WHY? THE QUEEN.
SHE GAVE THE ORDER.

127
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,583
THIS EARTH LAND GIRL
WAS TO BE EXECUTED IMMEDIATELY.

128
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,625
- THE ORDER HAS BEEN RESCINDED.

129
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:20,416
- I'M SORRY. ALTHOUGH
YOU MAY BE AN EXCEED,

130
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,708
YOU DON'T HAVE THE POWER TO
TERMINATE A DIRECTIVE

131
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,708
HANDED DOWN BY
THE QUEEN HERSELF.

132
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,000
I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU
HAND OVER THE GIRL AT ONCE.

133
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:33,125
- DO YOU NOT KNOW YOUR PLACE?
BOW DOWN. - ( gasps )

134
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,708
- YOU ARE IN THE PRESENCE
OF GREATNESS HERE.

135
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,041
OF ROYALTY.

136
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,500
I AM THE ELDEST DAUGHTER
OF QUEEN CHAGOT.

137
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:43,416
BUT YOU MAY CALL ME DIVINE
PRINCESS CARLA OF EXTALIA.

138
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,208
- ( all gasps )

139
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,375
- I BEG YOUR FORGIVENESS,
YOUR GRACE.

140
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,625
- Lucy and Happy: UH...

141
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:55,208
- WHERE IS WEND, I MEAN, WHERE
ARE THE TWO DRAGON SLAYERS?

142
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,208
- IN THE BASEMENT
OF THE WEST TOWER.

143
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,458
- I COMMAND YOU
TO RELEASE THEM AT ONCE.

144
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,250
- I'M AFRAID THAT I CAN'T.
I DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY.

145
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,083
I'M TRULY SORRY.
- I WON'T ACCEPT YOUR EXCUSES.

146
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,791
- YES. IT'S UNACCEPTABLE BUT...

147
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,791
- Pantherlily: ERZA,
THOSE TWO ARE FALLEN EXCEEDS!

148
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,458
- THEY HAVE BEEN
OFFICIALLY BANISHED

149
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,291
FROM THE KINGDOM OF EXTALIA.

150
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,666
- THAT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD.
DO YOU KNOW WHO HE IS?

151
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,666
- NO. I'VE NEVER
SEEN HIM BEFORE.

152
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,708
ALL I KNOW IS HE'S GOTTA BE
THE BIGGEST CAT I'VE EVER SEEN.

153
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,083
- Carla: WE NEED TO GO NOW.

154
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,708
- HOLD ON, I THOUGHT YOU
WERE SOME KIND OF PRINCESS.

155
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,125
- ( breathing heavily
with rage )

156
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,083
HOW DARE THEY?

157
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,916
- Soldier 1: ATTENTION,
ALL SOLDIERS.

158
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,375
THERE ARE TWO FALLEN EXCEEDS
ESCAPING WITH A PRISONER

159
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,666
OF THE COURT. THE
FALLEN ARE BLUE AND WHITE.

160
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,833
TERMINATE WITH
EXTREME PREJUDICE.

161
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,416
- YOU SAVED ME. THANK YOU.

162
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,208
- I THOUGHT YOU'D BE ANGRY.
- WHY? ABOUT WHAT?

163
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,166
- BECAUSE WE WERE THE ONES
WHO GOT YOU CAPTURED

164
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,666
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

165
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,291
- ( chuckles )

166
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,666
WELL, YOU MADE IT UP BY
RESCUING ME. YEAH, RIGHT, HAPPY?

167
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,500
- I'M SO SORRY, LUCY.

168
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,125
- MAYBE IT WOULD BE
A DIFFERENT STORY

169
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,958
IF YOU HADN'T COME
BACK TO GET ME.

170
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,791
BUT FORGET ABOUT THAT FOR NOW.

171
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,166
I'M STILL SHOCKED TO HEAR THAT
CARLA IS A PRINCESS

172
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:08,958
IN THIS WORLD.

173
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,666
- I DIDN'T KNOW EITHER.

174
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,666
- Carla: THAT WAS
JUST A BLUFF, OBVIOUSLY.

175
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,833
Lucy and Happy:
( shocked ) WHAT?

176
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,041
- ( chuckling )

177
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,666
- WHY MUST YOU LOOK AT ME
LIKE THAT, HAPPY?

178
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,625
- I'M JUST SMILING BECAUSE
THAT'S TOTALLY

179
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,125
SOMETHING YOU'D DO.

180
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,958
- WOW, SHE JUST CALLED HIM
HAPPY. THAT'S A FIRST.

181
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,291
- REGARDLESS, WE NEED TO FOCUS
ON THE TASK AT HAND,

182
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,041
WHICH IS TRACKING DOWN WENDY
AND NATSU. - THAT'S SO CUTE.

183
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,875
- Happy: WHERE ARE THEY?
- Carla: WEREN'T YOU LISTENING?

184
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,916
SHE SAID THEY WERE IN
THE BASEMENT OF THE WEST TOWER.

185
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,916
WHY ARE YOU SMILING NOW, LUCY?

186
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,041
- UH... ( laughing )
IT'S NOTHING.

187
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,291
IS THAT THE WEST TOWER THERE?

188
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,541
- ( wind whooshing )

189
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,583
- HOLD ON. WHAT'S THAT SOUND?

190
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,291
- SURRENDER NOW, FALLEN.
ESCAPE IS FUTILE.

191
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,916
- WHOA. THAT'S A LOT
OF FLYING CATS.

192
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,500
- NOW, MEN. GO.
- YES, SIR.

193
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,208
- WE'RE TOO EXPOSED IN
THE AIR LIKE THIS.

194
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,166
LET'S GET TO THE GROUND.

195
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,791
- THAT'S NOT SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

196
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,500
THEY'RE ALL OVER
THE GROUND, TOO.

197
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,083
- LUCY, CAN YOU USE
YOUR CELESTIAL MAGIC?

198
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,958
- I'M PRETTY SURE THIS STICKY
STUFF IS BLOCKING MY POWERS.

199
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,833
- Faust: WHAT IS THE MEANING
OF THIS?

200
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,583
- THE EXTALIAN ROYAL GUARD.

201
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,750
THEY'VE INVADED IN PURSUIT
OF THE FALLENS.

202
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:24,875
WHAT'LL WE DO?

203
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,041
- HMM.

204
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:38,583
- ( yells ) INITIATE CODE ETD
RIGHT AWAY!

205
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:48,666
- WE'RE USING CODE ETD?
- WHOA, I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

206
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:55,083
- Soldier 2: NUMBER 10
THROUGH NUMBER 12, READY.

207
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,958
- Soldier 3: NUMBER 14 AND 15,
PREPARATIONS COMPLETE.

208
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,708
- Soldier 4: NUMBER SIX
THROUGH NINE, OKAY.

209
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,291
- THIS IS THE LAST
LINE OF DEFENSE

210
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,916
IN OUR HOMELAND
SECURITY ARSENAL

211
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,291
AND HE WENT RIGHT TO IT.

212
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,583
- WE HAVE TO GET
INSIDE IMMEDIATELY.

213
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,375
- ( screams )
CODE ETD, INITIATE!

214
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,416
- ( people screaming )

215
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,833
- HOW DARE YOU TAKE UP ARMS
AGAINST THE EXCEEDS,

216
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,083
YOU LOWLY HUMANS?

217
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,208
- WHY WOULD THEY BE FIRING
ON THEM LIKE THAT?

218
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,333
- WHAT THE HECK'S GOING ON HERE?

219
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,666
I THOUGHT THAT THE PEOPLE
IN EDOLAS PRACTICALLY

220
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,750
WORSHIPPED THE EXCEEDS.

221
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,791
IS THIS SOME KIND OF REBELLION?

222
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,083
- I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE,

223
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,041
BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE WISE
TO USE THE CONFUSION

224
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,583
TO OUR ADVANTAGE.

225
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:59,125
THIS MAY BE OUR ONLY CHANCE
TO RESCUE WENDY AND THE OTHERS.

226
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,958
- AYE.

227
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,750
- THE FALLENS, THEY'VE
TAKEN AWAY THE PRISONER.

228
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,458
CALL FOR MORE DEFENSES.

229
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,708
SEND THEM TO THE WEST TOWER.
- YES, MA'AM.

230
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,958
- YOU WILL PAY DEARLY
FOR THIS, HUMANS.

231
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:17,208
DEFYING THE QUEEN WILL
COST YOU YOUR LIVES.

232
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,583
( yelling ) MEOW!

233
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,666
- ( soldiers clamoring )

234
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:31,291
( chattering in confusion )

235
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:35,083
- Solider 1: IT TURNED
THE EXCEEDS INTO A LACRIMA.

236
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,666
- Soldier 2: THIS IS NOT GOOD.

237
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,583
- Soldier 3: WHAT WAS
THE KING THINKING?

238
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:42,916
- Faust: ( angrily ) THERE ARE
NO GODS IN THIS WORLD. - HUH?

239
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,041
- WE HUMANS HAVE SUFFERED
WITH SCARCITY

240
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,208
WHILE THE EXCEEDS FLAUNTED
THEIR LIMITLESS ABUNDANCE,

241
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,291
HOARDED THEIR WEALTH
OF MAGIC POWER

242
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,291
WHILE WE WERE FORCED TO
BEG FOR SCRAPS.

243
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,875
IT'S TIME TO GRAB WHAT HAS BEEN
KEPT AT ARM'S LENGTH

244
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,333
FOR ALL THESE YEARS,

245
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:01,583
TO CLAIM OUR RIGHTFUL PRIZE,
WHICH WE HAVE BEEN DENIED.

246
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,875
AS OF THIS MOMENT,
THE ERA OF BEGGING

247
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,625
AND SUBSERVIENCE IS OVER.

248
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,583
WE MUST FIGHT
FOR THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY.

249
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,666
WE MUST REBUILD OUR KINGDOM
ON THE FOUNDATION OF LIMITLESS

250
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,958
MAGICAL POWER FOR ALL HUMANKIND.

251
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:17,166
WE MUST RISE UP
AND TAKE WHAT IS OURS.

252
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,083
THEREFORE, I AM
INITIATING CODE ETD,

253
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:24,375
EXCEEDS' TOTAL DESTRUCTION.
THESE SO CALLED ANGELS

254
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,291
SHALL MEET THEIR EXTERMINATION
BY OUR HANDS!

255
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,791
- ( cheering )

256
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,833
- GOTTA SAY, THINGS JUST TOOK
A VERY INTERESTING TURN.

257
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,833
- HMM. IT WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN
SOONER OR LATER.

258
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,833
- ( low growl )

259
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:47,041
SO, THIS IS THE REASON WE WERE
BUILDING UP OUR MILITARY.

260
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,291
- Faust: WHEN WE TAKE THE POWER
THE EXCEEDS NOW HOLD,

261
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:55,541
OUR KINGDOM WILL HAVE ENOUGH
TO LAST FOR GENERATIONS TO COME.

262
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,000
- BUT, YOUR MAJESTY, THE QUEEN
WILL DEFINITELY

263
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,000
LAUNCH A COUNTERSTRIKE

264
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,375
AND THEY HAVE SUCH
A STRONG ARMY,

265
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,625
I DON'T KNOW IF WE WILL BE ABLE
TO FIGHT THEM OFF.

266
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,625
- WE HAVE THE DRAGON SLAYERS.
WITH THEIR POWER,

267
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,375
THE EXCEEDS DON'T STAND A
CHANCE AGAINST US.

268
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:10,291
BUT WE MUST ACT QUICKLY
IF WE WISH TO STRIKE THEM DOWN.

269
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:13,500
BYRO, EXTRACT THE DRAGON SLAYER
MAGIC AT ONCE.

270
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,666
- NOW THIS MAY TICKLE
A LITTLE BIT.

271
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,208
( chuckles )

272
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:25,875
YOUR SACRIFICE WILL MEAN
A GREAT DEAL TO OUR KINGDOM.

273
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,250
- Happy: THINGS ARE GETTING
WORSE BY THE MINUTE.

274
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,750
- Lucy: WHO KNEW EDOLAS
WAS SO CLOSE

275
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,041
TO STARTING A WAR
WITH THE EXCEEDS?

276
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,541
- WHAT THEY CHOOSE TO DO
IS NONE OF OUR CONCERN.

277
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,208
WE HAVE NO STAKE IN THE MATTER.

278
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:44,000
THEY CAN WIPE EACH OTHER
OUT IF THEY LIKE.

279
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,708
- ( all gasp )

280
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,416
- THIS IS AS FAR AS
YOU WILL BE GOING.

281
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,250
- OH, COME ON, SERIOUSLY?

282
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,000
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO

283
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:05,958
THAN BOTHER WITH US.

284
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,208
- ( chuckles )

285
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,666
- ( screaming )

286
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,333
- ( whimpers )

287
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,166
- IMPRESSIVE.

288
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,458
YOU JUST TOOK A DIRECT HIT
FROM MY MAGIC,

289
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,208
AND YET YOU'RE STILL BREATHING.

290
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,000
BUT NOT FOR MUCH LONGER.

291
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:36,000
YOU SEE, MY ORDERS SAID NOTHING
ABOUT TAKING YOU ALIVE.

292
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,375
SO, IT SEEMS THERE
IS ONLY ONE OPTION.

293
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,291
- ( yelling )

294
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,541
- ( grunts )

295
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,666
- ( screaming )

296
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,500
HAPPY, WAKE UP!

297
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:58,875
- SORRY, NATSU. I TRIED.
I REALLY THOUGHT THAT THIS TIME

298
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,708
I WOULD BE ABLE TO SAVE YOU.

299
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:04,083
BUT I'M TOO WEAK.
AND NOW IT'S ALL OVER FOR ME.

300
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:09,041
ALL THE TIMES WE SPENT
TOGETHER, THE TWO OF US,

301
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,083
FIGHTING AGAINST THE ODDS,

302
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,583
NATSU NEVER GAVE UP,
NO MATTER WHAT

303
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,916
AND HE WOULDN'T
THIS TIME EITHER.

304
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,666
- ( crash )

305
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,583
- Wendy: ( screaming ) NO. NO.

306
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,791
- ( screaming )

307
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,708
NO!

308
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:47,166
- WHAT IMPRESSIVE SPECIMENS
YOU BOTH ARE.

309
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,625
THE MAGIC POWER YOU POSSESS
IS TREMENDOUS.

310
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,583
- ( groans )

311
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,541
- NATSU, ARE YOU OKAY?

312
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:59,291
- YEAH. NO MATTER
WHAT THEY DO TO US,

313
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,541
YOU CAN'T LET THEM GET THE
BEST OF YOU, YA GOT THAT?

314
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,083
I KNOW WE'RE GONNA
MAKE IT THROUGH THIS.

315
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,791
DON'T YOU DARE GIVE UP HOPE.

316
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:11,208
- YEAH. I'M SURE OUR FRIENDS
WILL COME TO HELP US

317
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,333
ANY MINUTE NOW.

318
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,333
- ( Byro chuckling )

319
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:17,250
SO, NEITHER OF YOU IS WILLING
TO FACE REALITY

320
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,166
AND KNOW WHEN
YOU'VE BEEN BEATEN.

321
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,083
IS THIS BULL-HEADEDNESS
ANOTHER PART

322
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,208
OF WHAT MAKES A DRAGON SLAYER?

323
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,833
- ( Natsu screams )
- NATSU, NO!

324
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,916
- LISTEN TO ME!
YOU HAVE TO STAY STRONG.

325
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,958
YOU CAN'T LET THEM
BREAK YOUR SPIRIT, WENDY.

326
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:39,000
- I PROMISE I WON'T. - Byro:
SOUNDS LIKE A CHALLENGE TO ME.

327
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,541
- Natsu: ( screaming) NO.
TAKE EVERYTHING FROM ME.

328
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,875
JUST LEAVE HER ALONE.

329
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,541
( screaming )

330
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,041
- Soldier 1: HEY,
YOU FIND THEM YET?

331
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,166
- Soldier 2: NO. NOTHING.
WHERE COULD THEY HAVE GONE?

332
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:54,791
- Carla: AS IT STANDS NOW,
WE'RE TRAPPED IN HERE LIKE RATS.

333
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,750
- I'M SURE THEY HAVE A TON
OF SOLDIERS GUARDING

334
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,625
WHEREVER THEY HAVE
NATSU AND WENDY.

335
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,083
WE PROBABLY CAN'T GET
ANYWHERE NEAR IT.

336
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,750
- WE CAME SO CLOSE, BUT...

337
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,208
WENDY.

338
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,625
- ( Happy groaning )

339
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,916
- HAPPY.

340
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,458
- THERE'S NO WAY
WE CAN GIVE UP NOW.

341
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,875
( grunts in pain )

342
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:20,333
WE OWE IT TO NATSU TO KEEP ON
FIGHTING UNTIL OUR LAST BREATH.

343
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,458
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
HE WOULD DO FOR US.

344
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:26,083
WE CAN STILL WIN IF WE
JUST BELIEVE LIKE HE DOES.

345
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,666
IF WE DON'T HONOR HIS FIGHTING
SPIRIT AND HELP HIM,

346
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,458
WE DON'T EVEN
DESERVE TO SURVIVE.

347
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,375
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT WE SHOULD DO?

348
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,416
- ( Wendy screaming )

349
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,875
- ( Wendy and Natsu screaming )

350
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:46,416
- Natsu: STOP. PLEASE.
DON'T HURT HER.

351
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,500
- ( Happy yelling )

352
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,250
- IT'S THE FALLEN.
- THE BLUE EXCEED.

353
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:57,916
- GET READY.
FOR MY POISON MIST ATTACK!

354
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,333
- ( soldiers coughing )

355
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,875
- Soldier 1: TRY NOT
TO BREATHE IT IN.

356
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,708
THAT'S NOT POISON,
IT'S JUST FLOUR.

357
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,000
- Soldier 2: AW, MAN! - Soldier
3: DON'T LET IT GET AWAY.

358
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,791
- SEEMS THE PLAN WORKED.

359
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,291
- I REALLY HOPE
HE CAN OUTRUN THEM.

360
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,000
- ( crashing )

361
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,416
- ( screaming )

362
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:28,250
- CREATING A DIVERSION
TO DRAW AWAY OUR FORCES

363
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,875
IS THE MOST PREDICTABLE STRATEGY
YOU COULD HAVE CHOSEN.

364
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:34,083
DO YOU HONESTLY TAKE US
FOR COMPLETE AMATEURS?

365
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,083
- ( Wendy screaming )

366
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,208
HELP!

367
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,000
- THAT'S WENDY.

368
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,791
- ( Natsu screaming )

369
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,083
STOP!

370
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,666
- Lucy: WHAT'RE YOU DOING
TO THEM IN THERE?

371
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,041
- IN ORDER FOR US TO
SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE CODE ETD,

372
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,583
WE MUST OBTAIN
THE NECESSARY MAGIC POWER.

373
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,458
- ( Wendy screaming )

374
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,375
- NO, PLEASE.

375
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:57,791
- ( Natsu screams )

376
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:58,916
LEAVE HER ALONE!

377
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,750
- YOU'RE GOING TO KILL THEM!

378
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:01,958
- ( crying )

379
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,791

THE FALLEN.

380
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,500
- ( grunts )

381
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,291
- Carla: HAPPY.

382
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:10,291
- ( Wendy screaming )

383
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:14,000
- AND WITH THAT, YOUR DEVIL'S
LUCK HAS COMPLETELY RUN OUT.

384
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,000
- PLEASE, YOU HAVE TO
LET WENDY GO.

385
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:25,375
- ( panting )

386
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:28,416
- ( breathing heavily )
NO. I WON'T.

387
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:33,916
I WON'T LET YOU HURT CARLA.
NOT WHILE I'M HERE.

388
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,625
YOU'LL HAVE TO KILL ME FIRST.
- HAPPY.

389
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:39,916
- ( scoffs )

390
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,166
VERY WELL, THEN,
YOUR WISH IS MY COMMAND.

391
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,958
- ( screams ) NO.

392
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,000
- ( yelling )
- ( loud explosion )

393
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,958
- ( confused chattering )

394
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,541
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

395
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,416
- ( gasps )

396
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:04,416
- Gray: YOU'VE GOT
SOME NERVE, LADY.

397
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,875
YOU KNOW THEY'RE WITH US

398
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:09,166
AND YOU DECIDED TO MESS
WITH THEM ANYWAY.

399
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,500
- Erza: ANYONE WHO WOULD LAY A
HAND ON OUR FELLOW GUILD MEMBERS

400
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,458
WILL BE DEALT WITH ACCORDINGLY.

401
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,916
- BUT HOW?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONE.

402
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,916
- YOU'VE MADE A BIG MISTAKE.

403
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,833
AND NOW YOU'RE ON FAIRY
TAIL'S BAD SIDE.

404
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:25,208
YOU SHOULD'VE KNOWN BETTER
THAN TO MESS WITH US.

405
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,250
- ( chuckles )

406
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,875
GRAY! ERZA!

407
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,583
- ( theme song playing )

408
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,166
- ( singing in Japanese )

409
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,666
- Natsu: HOLD ON. WAIT A SECOND.
THIS IS GETTING WAY TOO WEIRD.

410
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,583
- Happy: WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU? CALM DOWN.

411
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:20,458
- BUT THERE'S TWO ERZAS NOW.
AND THEY'RE FIGHTING EACH OTHER.

412
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:22,375
- WELL, I GUESS YOU HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE TIED UP,

413
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:24,291
BUT THAT LACRIMA,
THEY WERE TRAPPED IN...

414
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:27,541
- THE WORLD CAN'T HANDLE
TWO ERZAS. WE'RE DOOMED.

415
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:31,166
- DON'T CUT ME OFF WHEN
I'M SAYING SOMETHING IMPORTANT!

416
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,250
- Both: NEXT TIME,
ERZA VS. ERZA.

417
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,541
- Happy: IT'S STARTING
TO GET REALLY OLD, NATSU.

418
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:39,208
JUST THE OTHER DAY I WAS-- -
AW, MAN, I'M STARVING OVER HERE.

419
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:40,750
- YOU DID IT AGAIN!
