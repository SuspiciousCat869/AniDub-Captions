1
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:22,125
- WOW. I KNEW WE'D LOOK ALIKE,

2
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,000
BUT SEEING HER IS
FREAKING ME OUT.

3
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:27,666
- IS SHE THE EDOLAS
VERSION OF ME?

4
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,083
- ( gasps )

5
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,375
- THERE THEY ARE.
- OVER THERE.

6
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,541
- I'M AFRAID THE INTRODUCTIONS
WILL HAVE TO WAIT.

7
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:38,166
- IF WE STAY HERE,
WE'RE ALL GONNA GET CAUGHT.

8
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,291
- ( theme song playing )

9
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,875
- ( singing in Japanese )

10
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,208
- ALL RIGHT, NATSU,
DO WHAT YOU DO BEST.

11
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:12,625
- WITH WHAT, EXACTLY?

12
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:15,458
- WITH YOUR MAGIC, OBVIOUSLY.
YOU'RE A WIZARD, RIGHT?

13
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:18,916
- WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO USE
OUR MAGIC SINCE WE GOT HERE.

14
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,125
- WHA...

15
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,500
- HOLD UP. HOW COME YOU
CAN STILL USE YOURS?

16
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,708
- I HAVE NO IDEA.
- LUCY, YOU'RE OUR ONLY HOPE.

17
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,458
- GIVE THOSE BRUTES
THE WHAT FOR.

18
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:28,625
- IF WE GET CAPTURED,

19
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,208
THEN ALL OUR FRIENDS
ARE AS GOOD AS DEAD.

20
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:35,041
- SO, THIS MEANS, I'M THE
STRONGEST ONE IN FAIRY TAIL.

21
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,916
- QUIT FANTASIZING
AND TAKE THEM OUT.

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,208
- Happy: FIREBALL.

23
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:47,500
- NOW OPEN,
GATE OF THE WHITE RAM, ARIES.

24
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:51,458
- UM, HELLO. LEAVE EVERYTHING
TO ME. I'LL DO MY VERY BEST.

25
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:52,666
- THE FLUFFY ONE.

26
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,291
- WHOA, WHAT KIND OF
MAGIC IS THAT?

27
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,750
- THAT GIRL CAME OUT
OF THIN AIR.

28
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:56,833
- IT'S A DEMON.

29
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,333
- DOES MAGIC LIKE THAT EXIST?

30
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,791
- ALL RIGHT, ARIES, YOU THINK
YOU CAN TAKE THESE GUYS?

31
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:06,041
- WELL, I, I'LL CERTAINLY TRY.
WOOL BOMB.

32
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,166
- IS THIS AN ATTACK?
- SO COMFY.

33
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,583
- OH, NO. I DON'T THINK
IT'S WORKING, LUCY.

34
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,166
I'M USELESS, AFTER ALL.

35
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,291
- OH, IT'S WORKING ALL RIGHT.
LET THEM HAVE ANOTHER VOLLEY.

36
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:18,083
- GO, WOOL SHOT.

37
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,916
- IF THIS IS BEING BEATEN UP...
- THEN BEAT ME EVERY DAY.

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,125
- ONE MORE PLEASE.

39
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,583
- ( yelling )

40
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:27,125
- NOW, WOOL WALL.
- I COULD GET USED TO THIS.

41
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,791
- THIS IS OUR CHANCE TO RUN.

42
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,125
- WAS THAT TO YOUR LIKING?

43
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,958
I'LL BE SURE TO DO
BETTER NEXT TIME.

44
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,708
- TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, LUCY.
- WAY TO WRECK IT, MISS FLUFFY.

45
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,583
- THAT'S ONE WAY
TO TAKE OUT AN ARMY.

46
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:40,500
- WOW. I'M STRONG,
FOR REAL. THIS ROCKS.

47
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,875
- SO, THIS IS THE POWER
OF EARTHLAND MAGIC?

48
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,333
- WHILE WE HAVE THIS MOMENT,

49
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,708
WE SHOULD FIGURE
OUT OUR NEXT MOVE.

50
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,375
- OKAY, YOU WANNA TELL US
HOW YOU WERE ABLE

51
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,375
TO EVEN GET TO EDOLAS
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

52
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,708
- OH, YEAH. WE WERE
WORRIED ABOUT YOU

53
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,208
'CAUSE WE HEARD THAT
EVERYONE IN THE GUILD

54
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,291
WAS TURNED INTO A GIANT LACRIMA.

55
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,208
- HOROLOGIUM AND
MYSTOGAN RESCUED ME

56
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,625
JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME.

57
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:05,666
- YOU MEAN THE OLD CLOCK MAN?
- MYSTOGAN WAS THERE?

58
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,666
- CO- KO.

59
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,958
- HEY. WHAT IN THE HECK HAPPENED
HERE? ARE WE STILL IN MAGNOLIA?

60
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,250
- MY APOLOGIES. IN
THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT,

61
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,500
I LACKED THE TIME TO EXPLAIN
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

62
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,208
IF I HAD NOT ACTED AS I DID,

63
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,125
YOUR FATE WOULD BE THE SAME
AS YOUR GUILD MATES.

64
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:29,041
- THEIR FATE?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

65
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,750
- I SENSED A DISTORTION
IN THE FABRIC OF SPACE-TIME.

66
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,375
FEARING FOR YOUR SAFETY,
I USED MY OWN POWER

67
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:37,333
TO APPEAR. I PROTECTED YOU
BY PLACING YOU INSIDE ME.

68
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,958
- BUT WHAT ABOUT
ALL THE OTHERS?

69
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,875
DID ANYBODY ELSE IN
THE GUILD MAKE IT OUT

70
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,458
OR AM I THE ONLY ONE?

71
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,541
- I'M TERRIBLY SORRY, MISS LUCY.

72
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,625
I'M AFRAID I DO NOT KNOW
THE ANSWER TO THOSE QUESTIONS.

73
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,750
- I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU
MADE IT OUT ALL RIGHT.

74
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:57,625
- DO NOT FEAR I AM MYSTOGAN.
- MYSTOGAN?

75
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,125
- TO SAVE OUR FRIENDS,
YOU WILL NEED TO ACT QUICKLY.

76
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,125
- Carla: INCREDIBLE.

77
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,333
- Natsu: HE SURVIVED
THE GIANT SPACE VACUUM, TOO?

78
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,458
- Lucy: YEAH. THEN HE GAVE
ME THE RUN-DOWN

79
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,125
OF WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON.

80
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,541
WAIT A MINUTE. THEY WERE TAKEN
TO ANOTHER WORLD?

81
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,000
THAT'S THE CRAZIEST
THING I'VE EVER HEARD!

82
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:18,958
- I WISH I HAD MORE TIME TO
EXPLAIN BUT WE LACK THAT LUXURY.

83
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,791
IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE
THE ENTRANCE TO EDOLAS CLOSES.

84
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,458
- LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

85
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,208
YOU WANT ME TO GO THROUGH
THAT HOLE IN THE SKY

86
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,625
TO ANOTHER WORLD?

87
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,958
- MORE OR LESS. IT'S UP TO YOU
TO RESCUE OUR FRIENDS.

88
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,666
WHILE YOU'RE DOING THAT,

89
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,208
I WILL REMAIN HERE AND SEE IF I
CAN FIND ANY OTHER SURVIVORS.

90
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,791
- YOU'LL NEED TO EAT
ONE OF THESE.

91
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,791
- HUH? WHAT ARE YOU...

92
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:43,541
- I'M SORRY, BUT WE CAN'T DELAY
ANY LONGER. MAKE HASTE.

93
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,125
- YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

94
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,958
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO
START LOOKING FOR EVERYONE.

95
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,250
- GO, LUCY. YOU CAN DO THIS.

96
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,458
- ( screams )

97
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,583
- ( gasps )

98
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,041
- THIS IS EDOLAS?

99
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:10,000
THEN I STARTED SEARCHING
FOR ANYONE I MIGHT KNOW

100
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,208
AND EVENTUALLY RAN
INTO THE FIVE OF YOU.

101
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,750
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

102
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,500
HOW COME MYSTOGAN IS THE ONLY
ONE WHO KNOWS ABOUT EDOLAS?

103
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,166
- I'D LIKE TO KNOW
WHO THAT GUY REALLY IS.

104
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,208
- IF WE'RE LUCKY,
WE MAY GET TO ASK HIM.

105
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,000
- WELL, I'D LIKE TO KNOW
WHY YOUR MAGIC WORKS

106
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,916
IN EDOLAS AND OURS DOESN'T.

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,583
- WELL, MAYBE I'M A LEGENDARILY
BEAUTIFUL HEROINE IN THIS WORLD.

108
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,625
- DON'T THINK SO.

109
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,208
- CAN'T A GIRL HAVE A DREAM?

110
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:40,083
- I WISH I KNEW THE ANSWER
TO THAT QUESTION.

111
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,333
IF NATSU REALLY CAN'T
USE ANY OF HIS POWER,

112
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,166
I DON'T KNOW HOW
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO WIN.

113
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,500
- SO, YOU BONEHEADS STILL
WANNA TAKE ON

114
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,083
THE KINGDOM ALL BY YOURSELVES?

115
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,250
- OF COURSE, WE DO.

116
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,541
- IF WE DON'T SAVE OUR
FRIENDS, WHO WILL?

117
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,833
- IS THAT REALLY
SUCH A HARD THING TO BELIEVE?

118
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,375
- YOU'LL FIGHT THEM,
EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T

119
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,958
USE ANY MAGIC? THAT'S SUICIDE.

120
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:08,083
- ARE YOU DEAF? ONE OF US
STILL HAS AN ENTIRE ARSENAL.

121
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,083
THAT'S RIGHT, EVERYONE,
JUST SIT BACK

122
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,583
WHILE FAIRY TAIL'S STRONGEST
MEMBER TAKES CARE

123
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,208
OF THIS PROBLEM BY HERSELF.

124
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,875
- OH, YEAH, I'M ALL FIRED UP.

125
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,375
- WE'RE TOTALLY
SCREWED, AREN'T WE?

126
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,833
- I SUPPOSE WE'LL JUST
HOPE FOR THE BEST.

127
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:18,916
- AYE, SIR.

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,708
- YOU'VE GOT THIS
IN THE BAG, LUCY.

129
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,833
- ( giggles ) SO,
WHICH ONE OF YOUR SPIRITS...

130
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,541
- Lucy: THESE GUYS ARE
A BUNCH OF WHACK-JOBS

131
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,458
BUT FOR SOME REASON,

132
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,166
I FEEL LIKE THEY MIGHT CHANGE
THIS WORLD FOR THE BETTER.

133
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,125
I MUST BE GOING CRAZY.

134
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,666
- HOPEFULLY, WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHERE WE'RE GOING

135
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,000
IF WE USE THIS MAP.

136
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,416
- THAT'S WEIRD. IT LOOKS WAY
MORE LIKE EARTHLAND

137
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,750
THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD.

138
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,166
- THIS IS WHERE WE LAST
SAW THE EDOLAS FAIRY TAIL.

139
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,458
THE GIANT FROG BEAST CHASED US
SOMEWHERE IN THIS VICINITY.

140
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,458
LOUEN, IS WHERE WE RAN
INTO EARTH LAND LUCY.

141
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,458
AND WE'RE CURRENTLY HOLED UP
HERE, IN THE PORT CITY OF SYCCA.

142
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,708
WE'LL HAVE TO SECURE
PASSAGE OVERSEAS

143
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,333
IF WE'RE TO REACH
THE ROYAL CITY.

144
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,416
- OUR FRIENDS
ARE HALF A WORLD AWAY.

145
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,125
- AND THAT'S HALF A WORLD
FILLED WITH ROYAL ARMY SOLDIERS.

146
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,000
WE'LL BE DODGING AROUND
EVERY CORNER.

147
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,958
IT COULD TAKE US WEEKS
TO GET EVEN NEAR THE CAPITAL.

148
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,958
- WOW, THIS IS NUTS.

149
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,375
SHE'S JUST LIKE ME.

150
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,458
WE'VE EVEN GOT THE EXACT SAME
FRECKLES ON OUR BUMS.

151
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:19,375
- OH, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
I DON'T HAVE FRECKLES ANYWHERE.

152
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,791
- WAIT, SCARY LUCY.

153
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,791
DID YOU FORGET
NATSU IS IN THE ROOM?

154
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,291
- I CAN SEE HIM FINE,
HALF-PINT. I JUST DON'T CARE.

155
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,083
- YOU SHOULD!

156
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,500
- TALK ABOUT A MAJOR ACT
OF DUP- LUCY- TY.

157
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,083
- TOMCAT, YOU'RE NOT TO SPEAK
FOR THE REST OF THIS JOURNEY.

158
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,458
- ( groans )

159
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,125
- YOU SEE SOMETHING YOU LIKE?
I'LL SHOW YOU MORE.

160
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,541
- DON'T YOU DARE!

161
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,708
- HEY, WHAT THE HECK ARE
YOU LAUGHING AT? I GET IT.

162
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,791
YOU WERE GONNA POKE FUN AT ME
BY SAYING OTHER LUCY

163
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,291
HAS A BETTER FIGURE, IS THAT IT?

164
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,125
WELL, IF YOU WANNA DIE TODAY,
BE MY GUEST.

165
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,625
- I WAS JUST THINKING, YOU COULD
TOTALLY WASH YOUR OWN BACK NOW.

166
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,625
- Both: HE'S SUCH A CHILD.

167
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,166
- THE TWO OF YOU LOOK
SO MUCH ALIKE,

168
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,875
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO
TELL WHICH IS WHICH.

169
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,416
- I'M PRETTY SURE MY CABOOSE
IS IN BETTER SHAPE.

170
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,958
- WOULD YOU KNOCK IT OFF?

171
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,125
- YOU GUYS SHOULD
TOTALLY COME UP

172
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,791
WITH A MIRROR
IMPRESSION ACT TOGETHER.

173
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,458
- Both: NOT HAPPENING!

174
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,916
- WOW, THEY'RE EVEN
IN PERFECT SYNC.

175
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,583
- PERFECTLY ANNOYING.

176
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,541
- ACTUALLY, THIS REMINDS ME
OF WHEN GEMINI IS AROUND.

177
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,458
- YEAH. NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT.
- GERM- A- WHAT?

178
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,833
- A COUPLE OF CELESTIAL SPIRITS
I'M CONTRACTED WITH.

179
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,583
THEY CAN TURN INTO PERFECT
LOOK- ALIKES OF OTHER PEOPLE.

180
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:25,500
- OPEN, GATE OF
THE TWINS, GEMINI!

181
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,416
- TA- DA. GEMINI,
AT YOUR SERVICE.

182
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,000
- WHOA.

183
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,041
- IF YOU THOUGHT TWO WAS GREAT,
TRY A TRIPLE DOSE OF HOTNESS!

184
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,500
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
THE REST OF YOU,

185
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,166
BUT I THINK THIS WOULD
MAKE FOR ONE AWESOME

186
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,500
GUESSING GAME AT A PARTY.

187
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,666
- AND NOW IT'S TIME
FOR "WHO'S THE REAL THING?"

188
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:45,208
- HELLO, I'M THE REAL LUCY.
- NOPE, I'M THE REAL ONE.

189
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,875
- THEN AGAIN, IT COULD BE ME.

190
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,541
- ALL RIGHT FOLKS, USE THE
BUZZER TO MAKE YOUR CHOICES.

191
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,750
- All: YOU JUST
LOST THE GAME BIG TIME.

192
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,500
- THEY ALL SEEM REAL TO ME.

193
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:55,750
- I HAVE ONE QUESTION.

194
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,875
WHEN DID YOU PLAN ON
CLOTHING YOURSELF?

195
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:01,958
- ( screams ) I'M STILL NAKED.

196
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,458
- EVEN WITHOUT GEMINI AROUND,

197
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,958
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL
WHICH ONE OF YOU IS WHICH.

198
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,750
- I DON'T SUPPOSE YA GOT
ONE OF THOSE GHOST THINGS

199
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,916
THAT'S GOOD WITH
A PAIR OF SCISSORS, DO YA?

200
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,041
- YEAH. IN FACT, I HAVE THE
PERFECT SPIRIT FOR THAT JOB.

201
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,333
- IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE YOU CALLED ME, BABY.

202
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,875
- ARE YOU COOL WITH HIM
CALLING YOU 'BABY' LIKE THAT?

203
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,333
- IF YOU'VE GOT
A PROBLEM WITH HIM,

204
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,166
THEN YOU'RE GONNA FREAK
WHEN YOU MEET TAURUS.

205
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,916
- BOP! SHOO! WOP!

206
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,250
I HOPE YOU LIKE
YOUR NEW DO, BABY.

207
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,333
- THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY
TROUBLE TELLING US APART NOW,

208
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,666
DON'T YOU THINK?

209
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,541
- ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY
WITH CHOPPING IT OFF?

210
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,250
- I MEAN, MINE TOOK
FOREVER TO GROW OUT.

211
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,666
- YEAH, IT'S JUST HAIR.

212
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,916
- IT'S NOT SERVING SOME
GREAT PURPOSE BY BEING LONGER,

213
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,041
SO WHY DOES IT MATTER?

214
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,375
- BECAUSE EVERY LADY
SHOULD HAVE PRIDE

215
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,958
IN THE "DO" THEY SPORT, BABY.

216
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,291
- YEAH, I GUESS SO.

217
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,541
IN A WORLD LIKE THIS YOU TEND
TO FORGET THE LITTLE THINGS,

218
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,791
LIKE 'BOY' OR 'GIRL,' THAT
SEPARATE YOU FROM YOUR FRIENDS.

219
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,583
IN THE END, WE'RE ALL
JUST SURVIVORS.

220
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,500
- IF IT'S THAT TOUGH,

221
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,208
WHY DID EVERYONE IN YOUR
GUILD SEEM SO CARE FREE?

222
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,708
- WELL YEAH, OF COURSE
THEY DID.

223
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,458
IT'S IMPORTANT TO
KEEP YOUR SPIRITS UP

224
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,875
EVEN IF YOU GOTTA FORCE THEM
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

225
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,875
AND WHEN WE CAN'T BRING
OURSELVES TO SMILE,

226
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,916
WE REMEMBER THERE ARE PEOPLE
IN THIS WORLD WHO NEED US.

227
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,541
EVEN IF THAT MEANS
WE'RE LABELED A DARK GUILD.

228
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,041
FAIRY TAIL WILL ALWAYS
BE THERE TO LEND A HELPING HAND.

229
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,458
- BUT, I GUESS THAT STILL
ISN'T ENOUGH IN THE END.

230
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,125
- HUH?

231
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,333
- NOTHING. I'M JUST RAMBLING.

232
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,708
- YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!
I CAN'T BELIEVE MYSELF!

233
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,500
- WELL, YOU'RE CERTAINLY
ENERGETIC FIRST THING

234
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,541
IN THE MORNING, AREN'T YA?

235
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,208
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

236
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,791
- LITTLE MISS ME PACKED
HER BAGS AND TOOK OFF

237
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,541
ON US LAST NIGHT.

238
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,125
- "KEEP WALKING FOR
THREE MORE DAYS

239
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,541
AND YOU'LL GET TO
THE ROYAL CITY."

240
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,458
"I'M GONNA GO BACK
TO MY GUILD NOW.

241
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,375
GOOD LUCK AND TRY
NOT TO GET BUSTED."

242
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,541
- WHAT WAS ALL THAT ABOUT
'LENDING A HELPING HAND'?

243
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,333
IF I GET MY HANDS ON HER
I'LL WRING HER SCRAWNY NECK.

244
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,458
- SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU
HAVE A SCRAWNY NECK, TOO?

245
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:58,916
- SHUT UP!

246
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,333
- THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO.

247
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,583
OTHER LUCY SAID
SHE WASN'T GONNA FIGHT

248
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,166
AND WE SHOULD RESPECT THAT.

249
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,333
- YEAH.

250
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,958
- YOU'RE SAYING I SHOULD
JUST FORGIVE THIS?

251
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,666
SOMEONE WITH MY FACE SHOULD
NEVER ABANDON PEOPLE IN NEED!

252
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,625
- Natsu: AH, COME ON,
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

253
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,208
- Lucy: IT IS, TOO.

254
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,666
- ( screams )

255
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,541
- "THEY MIGHT CHANGE
THIS WORLD FOR THE BETTER", HUH?

256
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,750
WHAT A JOKE.

257
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,791
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW LAZY I'VE GOTTEN.

258
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,958
CHANGE SHOULDN'T BE BROUGHT
ABOUT BY OUTSIDERS.

259
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,416
IT SHOULD BE DONE
BY THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE.

260
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
IF THEY CAN PULL OFF
THIS SUICIDE RESCUE PLAN

261
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,166
OF THEIRS, MORE POWER TO
THEM. BUT THEY SHOULDN'T BE

262
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,333
THE ONLY ONES TAKING
THE KINGDOM DOWN A PEG.

263
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,500
IT'S TIME FOR THE FAIRY TAIL
OF EDOLAS TO QUIT

264
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,458
RUNNING FROM OUR PROBLEMS.
I'LL CONVINCE EVERYONE

265
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,291
TO STAND UP AND FIGHT
FOR THIS WORLD TOGETHER.

266
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,541
- ( people chattering )

267
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,833
- Male: DID YOU HEAR?

268
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,250
THEY'RE GONNA EXTRACT
MAGIC POWER

269
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,125
FROM THAT HUGE
LACRIMA IN TWO DAYS.

270
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,500
- YEAH. IT KIND OF FREAKS
ME OUT, TO BE HONEST.

271
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,791
I MEAN, WHERE'D THEY HARVEST
ALL THAT POWER FROM?

272
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,416
AN ALIEN WORLD OR SOMETHING?

273
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,041
- I HOPE THEY KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE DOING OUT THERE.

274
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,791
MESSING WITH MAGIC POWER
LIKE THAT COULD BE TROUBLE.

275
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,625
- CAREFUL. SOUNDS TO ME
LIKE YOU'RE QUESTIONING

276
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,166
THE METHODS OF OUR GREAT KING.

277
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,333
- NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT
I MEANT AT ALL. I'M LOYAL!

278
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,875
- RELAX. DON'T WORRY.

279
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,708
EVERYTHING WILL WORK
OUT IN THE END.

280
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,041
JUST LEAVE IT TO HIS MAJESTY,

281
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,875
AND EDOLAS WILL BE
SITTING PRETTY.

282
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,166
- Both:
INTERESTING CONVERSATION.

283
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,583
- YOU THREE PUNKS
MIND TELLING ME

284
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,041
WHAT YOU KNOW IN DETAIL?

285
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,166
- HUH?
- HUH?

286
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,458
- ( humming )

287
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,083
- Happy: WELL, SHE'S
NOT SCREAMING ANYMORE.

288
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,041
IT'S GOOD TO KNOW YOU CAN
CHEER LUCY UP

289
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,250
JUST BY GIVING HER A
RARE BOOK TO READ.

290
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,500
- SO, WHAT BOOK DID YOU
END UP BUYING, ANYWAY?

291
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,000
- A COMPLETE HISTORY
OF EDOLAS, SILLY.

292
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,291
- DON'T YOU WANT TO LEARN
MORE ABOUT THIS AMAZING WORLD

293
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,375
WHILE WE HAVE THE CHANCE?

294
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:49,916
- NOT REALLY.

295
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,208
- YOU KNOW THE SAYING,
'KNOWLEDGE IS POWER'?

296
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,666
WELL, THIS BOOK HAS GOT
TONS OF IT.

297
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,625
FOR EXAMPLE, THERE'S A TON
OF HISTORY

298
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,916
REGARDING A FEARSOME TRIBE
CALLED THE "EXCEEDS"!

299
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,375
- OH, WE ACTUALLY HEARD
ABOUT THEM ALREADY.

300
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,750
EVERYONE GOT REALLY SCARED

301
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,250
WHEN THEY STARTED
TALKING ABOUT THEM.

302
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,958
- WHATEVER, I COULD TAKE THEM.

303
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,125
- ( gasps )

304
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,708
- WHAT THE...
- LOOK ABOVE US.

305
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,416
- Natsu: AN AIRSHIP?

306
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,958
- MOVE IT OR YOU'LL BE
LEFT BEHIND.

307
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,875
- IT'S THE ROYAL ARMY AGAIN.
- WE GOTTA HIDE.

308
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,375
- Male: I HEARD THEY'RE GONNA
PULL THE MAGIC OUT

309
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:23,416
OF THAT HUGE LACRIMA,

310
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,416
THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW.

311
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,500
- SO, THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLING
FOR ADDITIONAL SECURITY DETAIL.

312
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,208
- YEAH, THIS IS BIG
TIME, YOU GUYS.

313
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,625
WE'D BETTER GET ON BOARD.

314
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,625
- THEY'RE TALKING
ABOUT OUR FRIENDS.

315
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,750
- AND EVERYBODY
FROM MAGNOLIA, TOO.

316
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,958
- THE MAGIC EXTRACTION
IS IN TWO DAYS?

317
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,708
THAT MEANS IF WE GO ON FOOT,
WE'LL NEVER MAKE IT.

318
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,041
- AND ONCE THE EXTRACTION
PROCESS IS UNDERWAY,

319
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,083
WE'LL LOSE ANY CHANCE
OF TURNING EVERYONE BACK

320
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,291
TO THEIR NORMAL STATES.

321
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,291
- WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO STEAL THAT SHIP.

322
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,791
- STEAL IT? ALL BY OURSELVES?

323
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,708
- THAT'S A COMPLETELY
UNNECESSARY TACTIC.

324
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,833
IT WOULD BE EASIER
TO SIMPLY SNEAK ABOARD.

325
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,375
- MAN, I CAN'T STAND HIDING.

326
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,833
- THIS MUST BE THE WEIRD NATSU,

327
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,375
'CAUSE OURS WOULD NEVER
WANNA RIDE IN A VEHICLE.

328
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,125
- ( chuckles ) THAT'S TRUE,
BUT WITH WENDY'S TROIA SPELL,

329
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,625
VEHICLES AREN'T
A PROBLEM ANYMORE!

330
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,916
- DID YOU REALLY FORGET
THAT WE CAN'T USE MAGIC HERE?

331
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,583
- YOU'RE RIGHT, LET'S FIND
ANOTHER WAY. - IT'S TOO LATE.

332
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,625
- I SAY WE TAKE IT BY FORCE.

333
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,333
IT'S OUR BEST CHANCE OF MAKING
IT IN TIME TO SAVE THEM.

334
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:24,708
- BUT HOW WILL WE DO THAT?
- DUH, WE'LL USE MY MAGIC.

335
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,041
- DID YOU FORGET YOU'RE
IN THE PRESENCE

336
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,708
OF THE MOST POWERFUL
WIZARD IN FAIRY TAIL?

337
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,000
AND DID YOU NOTICE HOW QUICKLY
WE GOT THE UPPER HAND

338
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,583
ON THOSE SOLDIERS IN LOUEN?

339
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,500
EARTHLAND MAGIC MUST BE
FAR MORE ADVANCED

340
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:36,875
THAN ANYTHING IN EDOLAS.

341
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,666
- Wendy: YEAH, YOU MAY BE
ON TO SOMETHING.

342
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,541
- CHECK THIS OUT, YOU GUYS.
- YEAH.

343
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,416
- OPEN, GATE OF THE LION, LOKE!

344
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,166
WHAT? VIRGO?

345
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,583
- PLEASE FORGIVE
THIS INTRUSION, PRINCESS.

346
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:52,875
- WHY'D SHE USE HER?

347
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,833
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,
AND WHERE'S LOKE?

348
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,083
- BIG BROTHER IS CURRENTLY
OCCUPIED WITH A DATE.

349
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,541
- HE CANNOT BE SUMMONED
AT THE MOMENT.

350
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,416
- UM, "BIG BROTHER"?

351
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,166
- YES. MASTER LEO REQUESTED THAT
I REFER TO HIM IN THAT MANNER.

352
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,708
- HAS HE LOST EVERY OUNCE
OF SANITY HE HAD?

353
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,458
- THAT'S LUCY FROM FAIRY TAIL!

354
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:11,291
- CAPTURE HER.
- NOW WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

355
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,083
I WAS COUNTING ON LOKE
TO TAKE ALL OF THEM OUT

356
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,916
AND MAKE ME LOOK
LIKE A POWERHOUSE.

357
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,583
- PRINCESS, IF YOU'LL ALLOW ME,
I BELIEVE I CAN

358
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,958
FULFILL THAT ROLE.

359
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,875
- WITH THE POWER OF
INTERPRETATIVE DANCE. - GO HOME!

360
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,333
- ( grunts )

361
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,583
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST USE
AQUARIUS LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO?

362
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,083
- I CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT WATER!
- COW MAN.

363
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:30,000
- THAT WON'T WORK EITHER.
WE'RE GONNA DIE.

364
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:33,166
- IF OUR MAGIC'S USELESS
WE'LL JUST USE EDOLAS' MAGIC.

365
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,458
- WATCH OUT, BECAUSE WE KNOW
WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW.

366
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,333
- THAT'S THE STUFF
FROM THE BLACK MARKET.

367
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,291
- ( screams )

368
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,750
- WITHOUT THEIR OWN POWER,
THEY'RE TOTALLY USELESS.

369
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,708
BUT THEY'RE STILL
BETTER THAN LUCY.

370
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:48,250
- ( sobs ) I WANNA SHINE.
- THE AIRSHIP IS GETTING AWAY.

371
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,166
- WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING QUICK,
OR WE'LL NEVER MAKE IT.

372
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,458
- GET BACK HERE!

373
00:16:58,958 --> 00:16:59,916
- ( gasps )

374
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,500
- ( screams ) NO.

375
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,166
- ( grunts )

376
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,208
- WHAT IS THAT?

377
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,250
- ( tires screeching )

378
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,083
- WHO'S DRIVING
THE MAGIC MOBILE?

379
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,583
- I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT'S GOT
FAIRY TAIL'S EMBLEM ON IT.

380
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,541
- LUCY, THOUGHT YOU GUYS
MIGHT NEED A LIFT. HOP IN.

381
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,333
- ( cheers )

382
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,083
- FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS, KIDS.
WE'RE RIDING HARD.

383
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,916
GO FIRE!

384
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,666
- SO TO SUMMARIZE,

385
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,916
YOU WERE SENT TO THIS WORLD
BY ONE "MR. MYSTOGAN",

386
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,750
WITH NOTHING BUT A
SIMPLE EXPLANATION

387
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,166
AND THE SHIRT
ON YOUR BACK?

388
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,416
- THAT COULD SUM UP MY ENTIRE
LIFE UP TO THIS POINT.

389
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,625
GETTING USED TO THIS PLACE
AIN'T NO PICNIC,

390
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,041
I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH.

391
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,958
- MM, HMM. THIS HAS GOTTA
BE THE MOST BIZARRE STORY

392
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,291
OF MY CAREER.

393
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:59,625
- WELL, DUH. HOW OFTEN
YOU MEET YOURSELF IN BAR?

394
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,333
- I MUST SAY, YOUR
'SIMPLE' PERSPECTIVE

395
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,791
IS CERTAINLY REFRESHING.

396
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,791
- SEEMS LIKE YOU MADE
QUITE A NAME FOR YOURSELF

397
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,250
AS A MUCKRAKER AROUND HERE.

398
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,666
- INDEED.

399
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,916
INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING
IS MY LIFE'S TRUE CALLING.

400
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,541
SEEKING OUT TRUTH
AND ENLIGHTENING THE MASSES.

401
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:16,125
- TRUTH AIN'T AN EASY PILL.
BET YOU GOT SOME HATERS.

402
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,666
IN FACT, THERE'RE A FEW LOSERS
THAT ARE MUNCHING DIRT

403
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,250
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT I WAS YOU.

404
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,458
- WHILE I THANK YOU FOR TAKING
CARE OF SUCH ANNOYANCES FOR ME,

405
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,750
I APOLOGIZE FOR
THE INCONVENIENCE.

406
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,208
TRUTH BE KNOWN, I'VE BECOME
A THORN IN THE SIDE

407
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,291
OF MANY POWERFUL
ORGANIZATIONS.

408
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,416
MY ARTICLES HAVE CAUSED
NUMEROUS PROBLEMS

409
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,458
FOR THE KING AND THE GOVERNMENT
OVER THE YEARS.

410
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,875
YEAH. AS LONG AS I CAN PUT PEN
TO PAD, I WILL WRITE THE TRUTH.

411
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,416
- YOU KNOW, WHEN I HEARD
ABOUT THIS PLACE,

412
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,708
I THOUGHT IT'D BE COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT FROM MY WORLD.

413
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,958
- Both: BUT ME AND YOU
ARE ALMOST EXACTLY ALIKE.

414
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,375
- YOU NOT ONLY DON'T TAKE CRAP
AND FIGHT THE MAN,

415
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,333
BUT YOU DRESS GOOD
AND WRITE FANCY WORDS

416
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,791
LIKE I'D DO IF I CARED.

417
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,583
- AND YOUR UNKEMPT WILDNESS
IS REFLECTIVE OF MY SOUL.

418
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,625
WE HAVE SO MUCH
IN COMMON, MR. ME.

419
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,208
INCIDENTALLY, I'M QUITE SKILLED
WHEN IT COMES

420
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,625
TO PLAYING INSTRUMENTS
AND SINGING.

421
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,750
- OH, ME TOO.
WE'RE A MUSICAL GENIUS.

422
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,041
SOME PALS OF MINE ARE HERE, TOO.

423
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,541
HONESTLY, THEY'RE A
BUNCH OF MORONS.

424
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,250
BUT THEY GOT IT WHERE
IT COUNTS,

425
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,625
AND I'LL BE CAUSING TROUBLE
SOON. WHEN THEY DO...

426
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,666
- YES. I'LL LET YOU KNOW
THE MOMENT THEY STRIKE.

427
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,375
I'VE GOT CONTACTS EVERYWHERE.

428
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,416
THE KING CAN'T SCRATCH HIS NOSE
WITHOUT ME KNOWING ABOUT IT,

429
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,375
SO KEEPING TABS ON THEM
WILL BE EASY.

430
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,958
- I'M COUNTING ON YOU.

431
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,750
I'LL LIE LOW, TILL YOU
GIVE ME THE WORD.

432
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:36,666
- WELL, UNTIL THEN.
- DON'T KEEP ME WAITING.

433
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,708
- WE MADE A CLEAN GET AWAY
AND NOW WE GET TO CRUISE

434
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:43,916
RIGHT ACROSS THE DESERT.

435
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,250
- THANKS A LOT FOR THE RIDE.

436
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,208
- YEAH, YOU JUST
SAVED OUR LIVES.

437
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,416
- NO PROBLEM. MY PLEASURE.

438
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,166
MY WHEELS ARE WAY FASTER
THAN THAT PIECE OF JUNK AIRSHIP.

439
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,375
HA! THEN AGAIN,
THERE ISN'T A VEHICLE

440
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,791
I COULDN'T LEAVE IN THE DUST.

441
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:04,666
I'M KIND OF A BIG DEAL AROUND
HERE. THEY CALL METHE FIREBALL.

442
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,500
- All: NATSU?

443
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,875
- HUH? IT'S ME?

444
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:13,125
- THIS IS CRAZY. I MEAN, YOU'RE
NOTHING LIKE THE NATSU WE KNOW.

445
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,000
- AND YOU'RE NOTHING
LIKE MY LUCY.

446
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,875
EXCEPT FOR THE LOOKS, OF COURSE.

447
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:20,916
SO, IS PUKE- FACE BACK THERE
YOUR 'ME'? TALK ABOUT PATHETIC.

448
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,791
- ( groans )

449
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:23,958
- HE'S USUALLY NOT LIKE THIS.

450
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,125
HE'S JUST NOT VERY
GOOD WITH VEHICLES.

451
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,333
- JUST DON'T RUIN
THE UPHOLSTERY, ALL RIGHT?

452
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,041
I CAN'T IMAGINE.

453
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,916
THEY WOULDN'T CALL ME "FIREBALL
THE COURIER- WIZARD",

454
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,041
IF I TOSSED MY COOKIES
JUST FROM SITTING IN A CAR.

455
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,625
- ( wretches )

456
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,083
- HOW ARE YOU ABLE TO DRIVE
THIS THING

457
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,083
WITHOUT AN SE PLUG
ATTACHED TO YOUR ARM?

458
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,625
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

459
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,416
- THE SE STANDS FOR
"SELF- ENERGY".

460
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,250
- IT CONVERTS
MAGIC POWER INTO FUEL,

461
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,833
SO WITHOUT ONE,
IT SHOULDN'T RUN AT ALL.

462
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,375
- THEN AGAIN, I GUESS SINCE
PEOPLE IN EDOLAS

463
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,625
DON'T HAVE NATURAL MAGIC POWER,

464
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,458
THEY DON'T NEED SE PLUGS
IN THEIR VEHICLES.

465
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,625
- DOES THAT MEAN THIS THING IS
RUNNING ON ANOTHER POWER SOURCE?

466
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,458
- FASCINATING. THOUGH THEY'RE
LACKING IN MAGICAL PROWESS,

467
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,916
EDOLAS HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES
WHEN IT COMES TO VEHICLES.

468
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,875
- ( tires screeching )

469
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,166
- ( screams )

470
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,833
- ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE ME
KISS THE DASHBOARD?

471
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:11,083
- WOW, YOU PEOPLE SURE ARE
IGNORANT. - HUH?

472
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,375
- SINCE MAGIC POWER
IS A LIMITED RESOURCE,

473
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:16,750
THAT MEANS THINGS LIKE
MAGIC FUEL ARE EQUALLY LIMITED.

474
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,541
IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE
TO GET A HOLD OF.

475
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,416
LONG STORY SHORT, I CAN'T
REALLY AFFORD

476
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,958
TO TAKE YOU ANY
FURTHER. SO, GET OUT.

477
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,041
- ( exclaims )

478
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,666
- IF I KEEP BURNING
THROUGH FUEL,

479
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,750
I WON'T BE ABLE TO MAKE IT
BACK TO THE GUILD.

480
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,291
THANKS TO THE FAIRY HUNTER,
THEY HAD TO

481
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,875
CHANGE LOCATIONS
AGAIN, RECENTLY.

482
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:38,208
- HELLO, SOLID GROUND.
I'VE COME BACK TO LIFE!

483
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,750
- I'LL HAND THIS TO YOUR 'ME'.

484
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:42,541
HE KNOWS WHEN IT'S TIME TO PICK
UP AND MOVE ON.

485
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,375
NOW THEN, GET OUT.

486
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,291
- ( screaming )

487
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,833
- IF YOU WANNA TAKE ON
THE KINGDOM,

488
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,083
THEN, I WON'T STOP YOU.

489
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,416
JUST DON'T GO DRAGGING
MY FAIRY TAIL INTO IT.

490
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,208
I ONLY HELPED YOU
BECAUSE OF LUCY.

491
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,125
NOT YOU, MY LUCY.

492
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,750
I COULD NEVER TURN HER DOWN
WHEN SHE ASKS FOR SOMETHING,

493
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,458
SO THANK HER FOR YOUR RESCUE.

494
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:03,166
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE
TO DO WITH YOU.

495
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,291
FOR ME, DRIVING IS ALL
THAT MATTERS.

496
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:08,875
- HEY.
- HMM.

497
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,875
- I WANNA TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND.

498
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,041
- NO. YOU GET YOUR
HANDS OFF ME, RIGHT NOW.

499
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,750
- SORRY, BUT I GOT TO HAVE A
NICE HEART TO HEART WITH MYSELF.

500
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,750
- WILL YOU CUT IT OUT.
LET GO OF ME, NO.

501
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,583
I CAN'T GET OUT OF THE CAR.

502
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:28,583
- NOW TELL ME. WHY IS IT
YOU DON'T GET CAR SICK?

503
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:30,208
- THAT WAS YOUR BIG BEEF?

504
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:31,500
- ( whimpers )

505
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:35,583
- HUH?
- I, I...

506
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:40,041
- ( sobs ) I DON'T KNOW WHY. I'M
SORRY. PLEASE, DON'T HURT ME.

507
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:41,958
- All: HUH?

508
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,708
- ( theme song playing )

509
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,041
- ( singing in Japanese )

510
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,083
- Natsu: SO EDOLAS IS WHERE
YOU'RE ORIGINALLY FROM?

511
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:17,083
DO YOU RECOGNIZE
ANY OF THE PLACES WE'VE BEEN?

512
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:18,416
- Happy: HOW COULD I?

513
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,458
I WAS STILL AN EGG LAST
TIME I WAS HERE, REMEMBER?

514
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:21,958
- OH YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

515
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:24,500
WAIT, THEN HOW DOES CARLA KNOW
SO MUCH ABOUT THIS PLACE?

516
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:26,291
- MAYBE SHE GOT A SPECIAL
EDUCATION

517
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:27,708
FROM A GUY WHO TEACHES EGGS.

518
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:30,791
- WOW. EDOLAS IS REALLY
AHEAD OF US.

519
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:33,500
- Both: NEXT TIME, WELCOME HOME.

520
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:34,958
- Happy: I MAY BE FROM EDOLAS,

521
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:37,458
BUT EARTHLAND'S FAIRY TAIL
IS MY ONE, TRUE HOME.

522
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:39,500
- Natsu: YEAH, TOOK THE WORDS
RIGHT OUT OF MY MOUTH.

523
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,416
- Happy: OH, COULD YOU
PUT A FISH INTO MINE?
