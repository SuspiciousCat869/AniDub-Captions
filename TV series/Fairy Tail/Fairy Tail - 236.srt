00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:42,250
How could these vile people
have found out about it?

163
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:45,916
No matter, I need to find
shelter and wait them out.

164
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,833
It looks like you've got this
handled, so I'll be leaving!

165
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:49,958
--[LUCY]  Huh?
--[MICHELIA] Uh...

166
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,833
[MICHELLO]
I'm going to, uh,

167
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:55,083
see if the other former Council
members are safe! Bye!

168
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,458
Grandpa! Wait!

169
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,583
You too, Michelia! Let's
get moving! Come on!

170
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,708
I don't think you
should be leaving us.

171
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,333
If you know something,
this is the time to share it!

172
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:07,875
I don't know anything! Nothing
at all! Just leave me alone!

173
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,333
I'm not buyin' it.
You better tell us,

174
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,083
if you know what's good
for you, old man.

175
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:15,166
[MICHELLO gasps]
I know nothing and that's final!

176
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,458
[JACKAL]
What a shame.

177
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,250
[MICHELLO]
Huh?!

178
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,375
[JACKAL grunts]

179
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,166
If you had some juicy
info to share,

180
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,791
I might've let you leave
with your body intact.

181
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,083
[LUCY]
He doesn't even seem injured!

182
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:25,875
[NATSU]
Ee!

183
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,791
What is this guy made of?

184
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,166
Do you have rocks for brains?

185
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,958
I told you, I don't
know anything!

186
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,958
Go ask somebody else!
I can't help you!

187
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:37,625
That's too bad. Guess I'll
stick to my first plan.

188
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:40,000
[MICHELLO groans]
U-Uh... Hey!

189
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,000
Don't just stand there
like a bunch of idiots!

190
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,875
Get him while he's down!

191
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,416
I order you!

192
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,416
You're kiddin' me.

193
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,541
[JACKAL grunts] You've got
skill, I'll give you that.

194
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,000
But you should learn
to pay attention

195
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,666
when someone's talkin'.

196
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,541
Huh?

197
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,583
Natsu! Look!

198
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,166
[NATSU]
Uh?! What the...?

199
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,333
My curses can change anyone
stupid enough to touch me

200
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:05,791
into a living bomb.

201
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,833
I wonder... How many
times did you touch me?

202
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,416
[NATSU growls]

203
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,791
Are you okay?

204
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,041
Keep away, Happy! That goes
for the rest of ya, too!

205
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,208
[LUCY]
But, Natsu...

00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:15,791
[WENDY]
We can't!

207
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,291
Get outta here!

Oh no!

00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:37,458
Is he...?

214
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,458
I can't really tell.

215
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,625
Weren't you going to protect me?

216
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:46,083
You're the most pathetic
bodyguard I've ever seen!

217
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,333
Grandpa, please!

218
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,875
Crazy! I can't believe
he's still in one piece

219
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:53,041
after all of that!
Not bad for a total loser.

[laughing]

221
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,958
[HAPPY] Come on,
Natsu! Please get up!

He's out cold!

[LUCY growls]

224
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,833
Your knight in shining
armor is outta commission.

[MICHELLO whimpers]

226
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,458
I'm a goner. Please,
get up! I need you!

227
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,125
If you tell me what you know,

228
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,541
I promise I'll only
kill your grandkid.

[MICHELIA gasps]

Ya see, I can be a reasonable
guy. Aren't you lucky?

I can't believe this jerk!

00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,916
No! Stay back!

Let's go!

239

Whatever you do,
remember to not touch him!

240
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,291
We can handle this!

241
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,333
You won't get past us!

The explosion
canceled it out!

[JACKAL] Those weak
attacks won't hurt me!

Run away, Wendy!

you'll end up like Natsu!

This is bad! Very bad!

If Face is really what they're
after, we're all done for!

The entire world
would be doomed!

What the crap?

Did this chick just make
a guy out of thin air?

264
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,500
Stop askin' questions

265
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,333
and get ready for a dose
of my desert power!

There's sand in my eyes!

[WENDY coughs]
I think I swallowed some.

271

Don't you worry, there's plenty
more where that came from!

make a difference.

Not again! I can't see a thing!

Sorry, this isn't working.
Good try, though!

278
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,000
[JACKAL] Now do you
see how useless it is?

279
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:35,875
[WENDY, LUCY]
Mm.

280
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,208
He can block our attacks,

281
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:40,000
and hit us back harder
thanks to his explosions.

282
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,708
His magic's too powerful.

283
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:42,958
Magic?

You tools have no idea
what you're dealing with here.

We don't use magic in Tartaros,
we prefer a darker poison.

all the magic in the world.

[MALE 236A]
No idea... But I'm worried

313
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,541
it may have something to do
with what happened in Era!

[MALE 236B] They've caused
some serious damage.

We should probably go and help!

Gotta run! Gotta find shelter!
If I don't, I'm as good as dead!

Who is that? I've never
seen him around here before.

318
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,541
Yeah, neither have I. Maybe he's
connected to those explosions?

What's wrong with you?

My life is in danger,
you ignorant whelp!

Huh?!

323
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,875
Listen close. I'm a former
member of the Magic Council!

324
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:18,541
I've been protecting this town
and its people for years!

325
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:22,083
Now it's your turn
to protect me!

326

You didn't get
very far, old man.

Stop this! I have nothing
to do with anything!

I don't have any secrets!

331
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:35,166
I just wanna live a peaceful
life with my grandchild!

332

That's all!

333

[JACKAL]
Is that the same grandchild

334
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,541
you straight up left alone
and at my mercy? Huh?

Wouldn't do that. Unless
you wanna get blown up.

What is this thing?

343
00:17:57,041 --> 00:18:01,833
That's my landmine curse.

It looks like wizards
are fighting!

Get away from me, now!
You're all in danger here!

00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,833
I feel like I've seen
this girl somewhere.

349
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,041
She was one of the wizards

in the Grand Magic
Games Bikini Contest!

Looks like we've
got an audience.

That could make things
more interesting.

Aw. I wanted them to see the
true ugliness of humanity,

gonna have to miss the show.

explode. So, who goes boom?

I'm leaving that
choice up to you.

Huh?!

Which one of them lives
and which one of them dies?

I've never seen him this bad.

Stand back, I'll
try to heal him.

373
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,125
Do you think you
can help him?

374
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,875
Don't push yourself
too hard, child.

375
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:21,375
If you use too much power,
you'll be in the same condition.

376
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,541
I don't have time
to worry about that.

Please Miss, you have to help
me! I'm carrying a baby!

You came to protect me, right?
Then what are you waiting for?

381

[LUCY] Stop it! What's the point
here? You were only after him!

This is a lot more fun! Humans
are playthings, nothing more.

You creep!

You can at least face
me fair and square!

There's ten seconds left.
Better make your choice.

Seriously?

Why are you doing this to me?

I'm a former council

Careful! Any sudden movements
will set off the Mine,

393

and if you explode before
making your choice,

will go sky-high!

power that's even stronger

are, the true terror of Tartaros
