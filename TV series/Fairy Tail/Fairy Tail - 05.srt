1
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:21,000
- Narrator: IN A
LAND FAR, FAR AWAY

2
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:23,291
LIES THE KINGDOM
OF FIORE,

3
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:26,208
A SMALL, PEACEFUL NATION
OF 17 MILLION,

4
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,625
AND A PLACE FILLED
WITH MAGIC.

5
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,875
FOUND IN EVERY HOME, BOUGHT AND
SOLD IN EVERY MARKETPLACE.

6
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:34,416
FOR MOST,
MAGIC IS NEARLY A TOOL,

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,041
A MUNDANE PART
OF EVERYDAY LIFE.

8
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,375
FOR SOME, HOWEVER,
MAGIC IS AN ART,

9
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:42,416
AND THEY'VE DEVOTED
THEIR LIVES TO ITS PRACTICE.

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,625
THESE ARE THE WIZARDS.

11
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,833
BANDED TOGETHER
INTO MAGICAL GUILDS,

12
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:50,666
THEY PLY THEIR SKILLS
IN SEARCH OF FAME AND FORTUNE.

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,500
MANY SUCH GUILDS
DOT THE LANDSCAPE OF FIORE.

14
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:57,333
BUT THERE IS A CERTAIN GUILD
IN A CERTAIN TOWN

15
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,541
THAT SOARS HIGH
ABOVE THE REST.

16
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:02,750
ONE FROM WHICH COUNTLESS
LEGENDS HAVE BEEN BORN. 

17
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,375
A GUILD THAT WILL
NO DOUBT

18
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:07,916
CONTINUE TO CREATE LEGENDS
WELL INTO THE FUTURE.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,541
ITS NAME IS FAIRY TAIL.

20
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:14,708
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

21
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,750
- Natsu:
PREVIOUSLY ON FAIRY TAIL...

22
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,250
- Mira:
WELCOME TO THE GUILD, LUCY.

23
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,125
- AAH!
- STOP FIGHTING!

24
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,375
- SO NATSU'S FINALLY BACK, HUH?

25
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,875
- THERE'S NOT ONE SANE PERSON
IN THE WHOLE PLACE.

26
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,458
- ERZA IS DUE BACK ANYTIME.

27
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,875
- UH...
- THE ERZA?

28
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,583
- YEP, SHE'S THE MOST
POWERFUL WOMAN

29
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:01,125
IN ALL OF FAIRY TAIL.
SHE'S SCARY LIKE A MONSTER.

30
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,333
THEY CAUGHT ME.

31
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,750
- GIVE HAPPY BACK!

32
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,875
- BUT WHAT COULD THIS MEAN?

33
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,333
- LULLABY...

34
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:11,833
- Man:
HEY, MIRA, CAN WE GET

35
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,083
THREE BEERS OVER HERE, PLEASE?

36
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,625
- BE RIGHT WITH YOU.

37
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,000
- SO WHEN ARE YOU AND I
GONNA GO ON A DATE, MIRA?

38
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,791
- WOULD YOU LEAVE HER ALONE?

39
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,916
- WAKABA, THERE'S ONE
SMALL PROBLEM.

40
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,375
YOU ALREADY HAVE A WIFE.

41
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,791
- I HATE IT WHEN YOU DO THAT!
IT'S SO CREEPY.

42
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,625
- I WISH I COULD DRINK
IN PEACE FOR ONCE.

43
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,208
- WELL, IF YOU DIDN'T DRINK
ALL DAY...

44
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,541
- I GUESS WE SHOULD PROBABLY
TRY TO FIND ANOTHER JOB.

45
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,541
- AYE, WE'RE RUNNING OUT
OF FOOD MONEY.

46
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,458
- IF WE'D TAKEN THAT
TWO MILLION JEWEL REWARD,

47
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:39,583
WE'D BE SITTIN' PRETTY.

48
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,041
AND I CAN'T LET MYSELF FORGET

49
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,750
THAT RENT'S GONNA BE DUE
NEXT WEEK.

50
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,791
I GUESS I'D BETTER
FIND WORK TOO.

51
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,750
- ( rock music plays )

52
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,083
- HMM...

53
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,416
FINDING A MAGIC BRACELET,

54
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,750
BREAKING A SPELL 
ON A CURSED CANE?

55
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,916
READING SOMEONE'S
LOVE HOROSCOPE,

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,833
HUNTING A VOLCANO DEMON?

57
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:05,500
JEEZ, I HAD NO IDEA
WIZARDING JOBS WERE SO VARIED.

58
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,041
- WELL, LET ME KNOW IF
YOU FIND ONE

59
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,416
YOU'RE INTERESTED
IN TAKING ON.

60
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,875
THE MASTER'S AWAY
AT CONFERENCE,

61
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,333
SO I'M COVERING FOR HIM.

62
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,375
- WHAT KIND OF CONFERENCE?

63
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,958
- ONE FOR GUILD MASTERS.

64
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,583
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,
THEY ALL GET TOGETHER 

65
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,500
TO TALK ABOUT
THE STATE OF THINGS.

66
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,791
IT'S LIKE THE MAGIC COUNCIL,
BUT NOT.

67
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,791
EXCUSE ME, REEDUS?
COULD I BORROW A LIGHT PEN?

68
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,250
- OUI.

69
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,583
- Narrator:
A LIGHT PEN IS A MAGICAL ITEM

70
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,500
THAT ALLOWS THE USER
TO WRITE IN THE AIR.

71
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,166
- THE COUNCIL, ERA, IS
THE MOST POWERFUL ORGANIZATION

72
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,708
IN THE MAGICAL WORLD.

73
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,166
IT'S ONLY ONE STEP
BELOW THE GOVERNMENT.

74
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,500
IT HAS 10 MEMBERS,
AND IT'S THEIR JOB

75
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,125
TO UPHOLD ALL MAGICAL 
RULES AND REGULATIONS.

76
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,958
AND IF A WIZARD BREAKS
MAGICAL LAW,

77
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,666
THEY WOULD BE TRIED
BY THE COUNCIL.

78
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,791
THEN THERE'S THE DIFFERENT
GUILD MASTER LEAGUES,

79
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,750
WHICH ARE LOCAL GROUPS
WHO WORK TOGETHER.

80
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,625
THEN THE INDIVIDUAL MASTERS.

81
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,500
IT'S THEIR JOB TO PASS ON
THE DECREES OF THE COUNCIL.

82
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,500
THEY ALSO COMMUNICATE
WITH OTHER GUILD MASTERS

83
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:56,916
ON A REGULAR BASIS.

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,250
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
THEY'RE THE GLUE

85
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,541
THAT HOLDS ALL OF US
TOGETHER.

86
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,791
WHICH IS A PRETTY
STRESSFUL JOB.

87
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,125
- WOW, I NEVER REALIZED THAT ALL
THE DIFFERENT MAGICAL GUILDS

88
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,875
WERE INTERCONNECTED
LIKE THAT.

89
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,250
- IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
WE COOPERATE WITH ONE ANOTHER,

90
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,958
OTHERWISE OUR SYSTEM
WOULD FALL APART.

91
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:13,166
- AND THEN THE GUYS IN BLACK
WOULD SHOW UP.

92
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,458
- AAH!
- ( laughs )

93
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:18,333
THAT WAS ALMOST TOO EASY! - YOU
TRYING TO SCARE ME TO DEATH?

94
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:21,625
- BUT SERIOUSLY, THE GUYS
NATSU'S TALKING ABOUT EXIST.

95
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,791
THEY'RE THE DARK GUILDS.

96
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,416
THEY'VE CHOSEN NOT TO JOIN
ANY OF THE LEAGUES.

97
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,625
THEY'RE THE BAD APPLES.
AND MOST OF THEM ARE INVOLVED

98
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,625
IN MAGICAL CRIME.
- WOW.

99
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,833
- WOULD YOU JUST GO
AND PICK US A JOB ALREADY?

100
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,458
- YOU HAVE GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME.

101
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,083
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I'D WANNA DO THAT?

102
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,916
- WELL, WE ARE A TEAM NOW,
AREN'T WE?

103
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,041
- YEAH, AND WE PICKED THE JOB
LAST TIME!

104
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,416
IT'S YOUR TURN TO PICK,
SO GET TO IT.

105
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,666
- JUST FORGET IT, CAT.
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

106
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,250
OUR TEAM HAS BEEN DISBANDED.

107
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,333
AND BESIDES, YOU GUYS,
DIDN'T ACTUALLY WANT ME.

108
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,458
YOU JUST NEEDED ME LAST TIME
BECAUSE I'M A BLOND.

109
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,000
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

110
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,916
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY REASON
WE CHOSE YOU.

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,250
WE PICKED YOU
'CAUSE YOU'RE SO NICE.

112
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,666
- HEY, LUCY,
I WOULDN'T STAY

113
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,291
WITH THOSE LOSERS
IF I WERE YOU.

114
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,333
YOU'LL GET PLENTY OF OFFERS
FROM OTHER TEAMS.

115
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,125
- YOUR CLOTHES, GRAY.
- AAH!

116
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,750
- JERK!

117
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,208
- DID YOU JUST CALL ME A JERK,
DRAGON BOY?

118
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,250
- AND WHAT IF I DID?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

119
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,250
- YOU MOUTH-BREATHER!
- AT LEAST I'M NOT A COWARD.

120
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,750
- YOU'RE A SPINELESS WIMP!
- YOU'RE A FREAK!

121
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,083
- LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE
AT IT AGAIN.

122
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,750
- WHY DON'T YOU JOIN
THE TEAM OF LOVE

123
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,666
WITH ME, LUCY?
LATER TONIGHT,

124
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,583
JUST THE TWO OF US?
- SAY WHAT?

125
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,791
- YOU'RE JUST
SO STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS.

126
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,791
I HAVE TO KEEP MY SHADES ON
WHEN I LOOK AT YOU.

127
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,916
OR I'LL BE BLINDED
BY YOUR DAZZLING BEAUTY.

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,583
- GIRLS REALLY FALL FOR THIS?

129
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,125
- YOU'RE NOT A CELESTIAL WIZARD,

130
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,666
ARE YOU?!
- HUH?

131
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,833
- YEAH, SHE'S GOT COWS
AND CRABS AND STUFF.

132
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,291
- AAH!
CURSE YOU, FATE!

133
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,041
WHY MUST YOU TOY
WITH ME SO?!

134
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,958
I'M SORRY, BUT YOU AND I
CAN'T BE TOGETHER, MY DEAR!

135
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,875
- WHAT GOT INTO HIM
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

136
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,416
- LOKE HAS A BAD HISTORY
 WITH CELESTIAL WIZARDS.

137
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,500
RUMOR HAS IT HE DATED ONE
AND IT DIDN'T END UP VERY WELL.

138
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:51,916
- WELL, I'M NOT SURPRISED--

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,333
- ( both scream, groan )

140
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,166
- THAT LOOKED PAINFUL.

141
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,333
- WOULD THE TWO OF YOU
JUST KNOCK IT OFF ALREADY?

142
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,708
- NATSU STARTED IT.
I'M JUST FOLLOWING THROUGH.

143
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,833
- WHERE ARE YOUR CLOTHES?
- AAH!

144
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,916
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
WAS PROVOKING ME.

145
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,750
YOU DIRTY SLIMEBALL.
- OH, YEAH?

146
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,750
AND WHAT EXACTLY DID I DO
TO PROVOKE YOU?

147
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:08,958
YOU FIRE CLOWN.

148
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,416
- YOU PERVY FLASHER!

149
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,166
- PINK-HAIRED PUNK.
- LAME INSULTS, GUYS.

150
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,166
- THEY START TO RUN OUT.
- IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?! 

151
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,625
- PRETTY MUCH!

152
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,041
- ( all laughing )

153
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,666
- ( chuckles softly )

154
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,625
- I'VE GOT BAD NEWS!

155
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,333
- ( all gasp )

156
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,916
- IT'S ERZA--
SHE'S ON HER WAY HERE.

157
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
- ( all scream )

158
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,750
- WOW, JUST MENTION ERZA,
AND THE WHOLE PLACE FREAKS OUT.

159
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,958
- WELL, SHE IS THE
STRONGEST FEMALE WIZARD

160
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,041
WE'VE GOT IN FAIRY TAIL,

161
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,541
AND MORE THAN
A BIT INTIMIDATING.

162
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:39,416
- ( heavy footsteps
approaching )

163
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,791
- THAT'S GOTTA BE HER.

164
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,833
- THOSE SOUND LIKE
HER FOOTSTEPS.

165
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,833
- EVEN THE AIR'S GOTTEN
COMPLETELY STILL.

166
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,333
- JEEZ, FROM THESE REACTIONS,
YOU'D THINK SHE WAS

167
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,166
SOME KIND OF DEMON
OR SOMETHING.

168
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,541
- ( roars )
- ( screaming )

169
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:51,583
- I'M SO SCARED!

170
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:05,208
- I HAVE RETURNED.
WHERE IS MASTER MAKAROV?

171
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,958
- WOW, SHE'S PRETTY.

172
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,791
- WELCOME BACK, ERZA.
THE MASTER'S AT A CONFERENCE

173
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,000
RIGHT NOW.
- I SEE.

174
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,916
- SO, UM, WHAT'S THAT
HUMONGOUS THING YOU GOT THERE?

175
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,916
- IT'S THE HORN OF A MONSTER
THAT I DEFEATED.

176
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,083
THE LOCALS WERE SO THANKFUL,
THEY DECORATED IT

177
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,666
AND GAVE IT TO ME
AS A SOUVENIR.

178
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,708
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT?
- NO, NOT AT ALL!

179
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,916
- I BET SHE'S HEARD ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED AT MOUNT HAKUBE.

180
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,333
- YOU THINK SO?
AW, MAN, I'M A GONER.

181
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,541
- SHE'S NOT ANYTHING
LIKE I IMAGINED.

182
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,625
- NOW, LISTEN UP.
- ( all gasp )

183
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,708
- WHILE I WAS ON THE ROAD,
I HEARD A FEW THINGS.

184
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,958
WORD IS FAIRY TAIL IS CAUSING
NOTHING BUT TROUBLE AS OF LATE.

185
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,916
MASTER MAKAROV MAY NOT CARE,

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,541
BUT I MOST CERTAINLY DO.

187
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,500
CANA, YOU NEED TO START
CONTROLLING YOUR DRINKING.

188
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,000
VIJEETER, PLEASE TAKE
THE DANCING OUTSIDE.

189
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,458
WAKABA, GET RID OF THAT
FILTHY HABIT.

190
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,083
NAB, I SUSPECTED I WOULD
FIND YOU DAWDLING

191
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:55,500
IN FRONT OF THE REQUEST BOARD.
JUST PICK A JOB!

192
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:58,375
MACAO...

193
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,416
( sighs )

194
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,875
- PLEASE JUST SAY SOMETHING!

195
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,000
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO BEGIN WITH YOU.

196
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,833
YOU CAUSE SO MUCH TROUBLE.
I'VE ALMOST GIVEN UP.

197
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,916
- SHE'S REALLY TEARING IN
TO EVERYONE.

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,833
IT'S LIKE SHE'S TAKING OVER.
- THAT'S ERZA FOR YA.

199
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,625
- EVEN IF SHE IS
KINDA BOSSY,

200
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,458
SHE'S STILL SANER THAN
ANYONE ELSE HERE.

201
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,875
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
EVERYONE'S SO AFRAID OF HER.

202
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,458
- ARE NATSU AND GRAY HERE?

203
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:21,041
- Happy: AYE!
- OH, HEY THERE, ERZA.

204
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,875
WE'RE JUST HANGING OUT
LIKE GOOD FRIENDS TEND TO DO.

205
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,916
- AYE! - WHY IS NATSU
TALKING LIKE HAPPY?!

206
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,125
- THAT'S GREAT. I'M QUITE
PLEASED TO SEE THE TWO OF YOU

207
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,916
GETTING ALONG SO WELL.

208
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,500
HOWEVER, IT'S ONLY NATURAL
FOR EVEN THE BEST OF FRIENDS

209
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,208
TO LOCK HORNS
EVERY NOW AND AGAIN.

210
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,958
- I DON'T KNOW IF
WE'RE THE BEST OF FRIENDS.

211
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,416
- AYE...
- WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO NATSU?!

212
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,708
- HE'S SCARED.
A FEW YEARS AGO,

213
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,125
HE CHALLENGED ERZA TO A FIGHT,
AND SHE BEAT HIM UP PRETTY BAD.

214
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,833
- THAT WAS A STUPID THING
TO DO.

215
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,083
- AFTER THAT, SHE FOUND GRAY
WALKING AROUND NAKED,

216
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,000
SO SHE DECIDED
TO BEAT HIM UP TOO.

217
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,833
- AND LET'S NOT FORGET,
SHE ALSO BEAT UP LOKE

218
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,208
FOR TRYING TO HIT ON HER.

219
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,541
- ( grunts )

220
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:55,875
- Cana: HE TOTALLY DESERVED IT,
THOUGH.

221
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,000
- Lucy:
YEAH, CAN'T SAY I BLAME HER.

222
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,833
- NATSU, GRAY...

223
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,250
I NEED YOU TO DO ME
A FAVOR.

224
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:05,208
WHILE TRAVELING, I OVERHEARD
SOMETHING THAT HAS ME WORRIED.

225
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,875
NORMALLY, I WOULD CONSULT
WITH THE MASTER BEFORE ACTING,

226
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:11,833
BUT HE'S NOT HERE AND THIS IS
A MATTER OF UTMOST URGENCY.

227
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,666
THE TWO OF YOU ARE
THE STRONGEST WIZARDS HERE.

228
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,375
I COULD REALLY USE
YOUR HELP.

229
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,833
- ( murmuring )
- DID THAT JUST HAPPEN?

230
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,083
- ERZA ASKED THEM FOR HELP?

231
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,875
- THIS IS DEFINITELY A FIRST.

232
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,250
- WE'LL MEET AT THE TRAIN
STATION TOMORROW MORNING.

233
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,083
- ME AND NATSU?

234
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,000
- ON THE SAME TEAM?

235
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:30,208
- ERZA, NATSU AND GRAY
WORKING TOGETHER?

236
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,916
I NEVER SAW THAT ONE COMING.

237
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,125
THIS COULD BE THE MOST POWERFUL
TEAM FAIRY TAIL'S EVER SEEN.

238
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,125
- ( exhales )
THEN?

239
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,958
- ( chattering )

240
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,791
- Narrator:
MAGNOLIA STATION.

241
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,875
- AAH!

242
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,875
I HATE THIS! TEAMING UP WITH
YOU WAS THE WORST IDEA EVER!

243
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,458
- YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.
ERZA MADE A HUGE MISTAKE 

244
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,333
ASKING A LOSER LIKE YOU
TO COME ALONG.

245
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,791
- FINE THEN, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TAKE CARE OF IT YOURSELF?

246
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,166
I DON'T WANNA GO ANYWAY.
- SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN TO ME.

247
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,000
THEN I'LL GET TO WATCH HER
BEAT YOU SENSELESS.

248
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,458
- ( exhales )
- LET'S JUST SIT HERE

249
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,041
AND PRETEND
WE DON'T KNOW THEM.

250
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,708
- WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE
TO COME WITH US?

251
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,375
- MIRA ASKED ME
TO TAG ALONG.

252
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,166
- THOSE TWO ARE GONNA
BE AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS

253
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,333
WHEN ERZA'S NOT LOOKING, 
SO I WANT YOU TO BE THERE

254
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,583
TO STOP THEM, OKAY?
- WHO, ME?!

255
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,541
- YOU AREN'T DOING
A VERY GOOD JOB.

256
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,750
- THEY'RE HOPELESS.
- ( indistinct muttering )

257
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,958
- Erza: SORRY I'M LATE.
HAVE YOU BEEN WAITING LONG?

258
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,416
- NO, NOT REALLY.

259
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,375
AAH.

260
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,208
WOW, LOOK AT THAT LUGGAGE!
ALL THOSE BELONG TO YOU?! 

261
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,916
- IT'S TIME TO GO, GOOD BUDDY.
- AYE!  HA-HA!

262
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,875
- LISTEN, ONE HAPPY'S ENOUGH.

263
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,875
- GOOD, I REALLY LOVE TO SEE
THE TWO OF YOU GETTING ALONG.

264
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,583
AND WHAT WAS YOUR NAME?

265
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,833
I BELIEVE I SAW YOU
AT THE GUILD YESTERDAY.

266
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,666
- MY NAME'S LUCY,
AND I JUST JOINED FAIRY TAIL.

267
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,541
MIRA ASKED ME TO COME ALONG
WITH YOU GUYS

268
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,041
SO I COULD LEARN A THING OR TWO.

269
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,750
I HOPE THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU.

270
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,791
- THE MORE THE MERRIER.
I'M ERZA.

271
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,625
WAIT, YOU'RE THE GIRL
I HEARD ABOUT.

272
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,500
- ( lightly cheer )
- I WAS TOLD YOU DEFEATED

273
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,916
A MERCENARY GORILLA
USING ONLY YOUR PINKY FINGER.

274
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,333
- ( gasps ) - IT'LL BE GREAT TO
HAVE A WIZARD LIKE YOU ON BOARD.

275
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,041
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.
- ( cheer )

276
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,916
- OH, NO, IT'S MY PLEASURE.
( chuckles nervously )

277
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,791
- HEY, ERZA, I'LL COME WITH YOU,
BUT ONLY UNDER ONE CONDITION.

278
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,291
- SHUT UP.
- OH?  WELL, THEN LET'S HEAR IT.

279
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,250
- 'KAY, I WANNA REMATCH
WHEN WE GET BACK TO FAIRY TAIL.

280
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,250
- ( gasps )
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

281
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,666
GOT SOME KIND OF DEATH WISH?

282
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,750
- I'M A LOT STRONGER 
THAN I WAS LAST TIME.

283
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,958
THIS TIME WILL BE
WAY DIFFERENT.

284
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,000
'CAUSE I'M GONNA BEAT YOU.

285
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,125
- YES, I CAN TELL
 YOU'VE IMPROVED.

286
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,208
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT
YOU CAN BEAT ME,

287
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,083
I SUPPOSE WE'LL HAVE TO SEE.

288
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,083
I ACCEPT YOUR CHALLENGE.

289
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:35,958
- OH, YEAH!
I'M FIRED UP!

290
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,208
- ( train whistle blows )

291
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,000
- I SWEAR YOU'RE
TOTALLY PATHETIC, NATSU.

292
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,333
ONE MINUTE YOU'RE
PICKING A FIGHT,

293
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,916
THE NEXT, YOU'RE LIKE THIS.

294
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,333
- IT'S GOTTA BE TOUGH ON HIM,
 GETTING FROM PLACE TO PLACE.

295
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,250
- DON'T WORRY.
HE'LL BE FINE.

296
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,750
COME HERE AND SIT WITH ME.

297
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,791
- I-- I GUESS SHE
WANTS ME TO MOVE.

298
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,000
- NOW JUST RELAX.
- ( groans )

299
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:01,833
AAH! - THERE. THAT SHOULD MAKE
THE TRIP A LITTLE EASIER ON HIM.

300
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:05,000
- OKAY, MAYBE SHE'S NOT AS SANE
AS I THOUGHT SHE WAS.

301
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:08,208
- ERZA, I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME
YOU STARTED FILLING US IN.

302
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,708
I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF MISSION
ARE WE GOING ON HERE?

303
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,666
- OF COURSE.  I HAVE REASON
TO BELIEVE THE DARK GUILD

304
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,875
EISENWALD IS PLANNING
SOMETHING BIG.

305
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,875
I'M NOT SURE WHAT EXACTLY,
BUT IT HAS TO DO WITH

306
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,458
A MAGIC ITEM CALLED LULLABY.

307
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:22,000
- Both: LULLABY?
- WAIT, THAT THING FROM BEFORE?

308
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,500
- Narrator:
THE DARK GUILD, EISENWALD.

309
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,916
- Rayule: I HEAR KAGEYAMA
FINALLY GOT BACK TO US.

310
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,541
- Byard: YEAH, HE SAYS
 HE ACTUALLY FOUND IT.

311
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,958
- THE MOMENT OF TRUTH
HAS ARRIVED, GENTLEMEN.

312
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:40,625
THIS MEANS WE'RE ONE STEP CLOSER
TO ACHIEVING OUR GOALS.

313
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,833
THE GUILD MASTERS WILL BE TOO
BUSY HOLDING THEIR CONFERENCE,

314
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,208
THEY WON'T EVEN REALIZE
WHAT'S HIT THEM.

315
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,541
- I SEE.  SO YOU'VE RUN INTO
 THE EISENWALD GUILD BEFORE?

316
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,500
- WELL, I'M NOT POSITIVE
THEY WERE PART OF EISENWALD.

317
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,458
BUT THEY DID MENTION LULLABY.

318
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,916
- IT SOUNDS LIKE
THEY WERE MEMBERS

319
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,875
WHO DROPPED OUT OF THE GUILD

320
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,041
AND GONE INTO HIDING.

321
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,416
PERHAPS THEY WANTED NO PART

322
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,416
OF WHATEVER IT IS
THAT'S COMING.

323
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,958
- SO THIS THING IS SO BAD
IT EVEN SCARES DARK WIZARDS?

324
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,958
- I'M ONLY HYPOTHESIZING.

325
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,375
BUT WHOEVER YOU SAW
DRAGGING OFF HAPPY'S KIDNAPPERS

326
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,416
THAT DAY, MUST HAVE BEEN
FROM EISENWALD.

327
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,416
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THEY DIDN'T
WANT THEIR PLANS GETTING OUT.

328
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,875
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
 THEY'RE GONNA TRY?

329
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,500
- LET ME START
FROM THE BEGINNING.

330
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,333
JUST THE OTHER DAY
I WAS HEADING HOME

331
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,583
AFTER COMPLETING A JOB.

332
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,625
I STOPPED BY A PUB
IN ONIBAS

333
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,458
THAT I KNEW WAS A GATHERING
SPOT FOR LOCAL WIZARDS.

334
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,958
- Byard: COME ON, HURRY IT UP,
BARTENDER!

335
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,666
- Rayule:
HEY, RELAX A LITTLE.

336
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,458
- AND HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT?

337
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,083
WE FINALLY MANAGED TO FIGURE OUT
WHERE LULLABY'S HIDDEN,

338
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,666
BUT WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING.
BECAUSE OF SOME SEAL?

339
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,500
- KEEP IT DOWN, MAN.
- DON'T SWEAT IT, YOU GUYS.

340
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,166
LET ME HANDLE THIS ONE.

341
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,583
YOU JUST HEAD BACK
TO THE GUILD, ALL RIGHT?

342
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,000
- YOU SURE, KAGE?
- YOU GONNA BE OKAY ON YOUR OWN?

343
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,125
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT ME.

344
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,000
JUST TELL ERIGOR THAT
I'LL BE COMING BACK

345
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,750
WITH LULLABY IN THREE DAYS.

346
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,000
- LULLABY?

347
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,125
THAT'S LIKE A SONG
YOU SING KIDS TO SLEEP.

348
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,833
- YES.  AND THE FACT
THAT IT HAD BEEN SEALED AWAY

349
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,250
MEANS THAT IT MUST BE
VERY POWERFUL MAGIC. 

350
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,875
- YOU SURE THE GUYS YOU SAW
AT THE PUB ARE WITH EISENWALD?

351
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,708
- YES.  I CAN'T BELIEVE
I WAS SUCH A FOOL THAT DAY.

352
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,500
I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIS NAME.

353
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,708
ERIGOR, THE ACE OF EISENWALD.

354
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,541
HE ONLY ACCEPTS
ASSASSINATION REQUESTS,

355
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,666
WHICH IS WHY HE'S EARNED
THE NAME, "ERIGOR THE REAPER."

356
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,291
- Lucy:
HE KILLS FOR MONEY?

357
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,625
- WHEN THE COUNCIL OUTLAWED
ASSASSINATION REQUESTS,

358
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,333
EISENWALD DECIDED THAT MONEY
WAS MORE IMPORTANT

359
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,250
THAN THE COUNCIL'S RULES.

360
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,666
AS A RESULT, THEY WERE KICKED
OUT OF THEIR WIZARD LEAGUE

361
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,208
SIX YEARS AGO.

362
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,958
BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP THEM.

363
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,916
THEY'VE DISOBEYED ORDERS
AND REMAINED ACTIVE TO THIS DAY.

364
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,875
- OKAY, I SHOULD BE
HEADING BACK HOME NOW.

365
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,250
- LUCY'S SLIMY ALL OF A SUDDEN.
- IT'S SWEAT!

366
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,916
- HOW COULD I HAVE BEEN
SO CARELESS?

367
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,500
IF ONLY I HAD RECOGNIZED 
ERIGOR'S NAME THAT DAY...

368
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,125
I COULD HAVE
PULVERIZED THEM.

369
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,333
I COULD HAVE FORCED THEM
TO REVEAL THEIR SCHEME TO ME.

370
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,416
- SHE'S SCARY!
- SO IF I GOT THIS,

371
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,833
EISENWALD'S PLANNING TO DO
SOMETHING WITH THIS LULLABY,

372
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,625
AND YOU WANNA STOP THEM. BECAUSE
AFTER WHAT YOU OVERHEARD,

373
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,583
YOU'RE SURE THAT
IT'S GONNA BE SOMETHING BAD.

374
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,000
- THAT'S CORRECT.
AND I'M NOT FOOLISH ENOUGH

375
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,666
TO BELIEVE THAT I CAN TAKE ON
AN ENTIRE MAGICAL GUILD

376
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,958
ALL BY MYSELF.

377
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,833
THAT'S WHY I ASKED
YOU AND NATSU FOR YOUR HELP.

378
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,541
WE'RE STORMING
THE EISENWALD GUILD.

379
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,250
- SOUNDS LIKE FUN TO ME.

380
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,666
- AYE!
- I SHOULDN'T HAVE COME ALONG.

381
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,583
- EW, NOW YOU'RE SUPER SLIMY!
- I TOLD YOU, IT'S SWEAT!

382
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,958
CAN'T YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE
DISCOUNT, PRETTY PLEASE?

383
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,375
- ( blows )
- IF YOU DON'T MIND,

384
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,750
WHAT KIND OF MAGIC
DO YOU PRACTICE, ERZA?

385
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,958
- THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
- ERZA'S MAGIC IS REALLY PRETTY.

386
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,083
SHE MAKES HER ENEMIES
BLEED A LOT.

387
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,291
- I DON'T KNOW IF
I'D CALL THAT PRETTY.

388
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,416
- PERSONALLY,
I THINK GRAY'S MAGIC

389
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,666
IS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN MINE.

390
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,541
- OH, LIKE THIS?

391
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,375
- ( rock music plays )

392
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,041
- I USE ICE MAGIC.

393
00:16:57,125 --> 00:17:00,250
- Lucy: NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU AND NATSU DON'T GET ALONG.

394
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,416
HE'S FIRE AND YOU'RE ICE. TALK
ABOUT NOT MIXING VERY WELL.

395
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,833
- Erza:
I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

396
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,041
- NAH, I JUST HATE HIS GUTS.

397
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,458
- Narrator:
ONIBAS STATION.

398
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,083
- Gray: YOU THINK
THE EISENWALD GUYS

399
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,666
ARE STILL GONNA BE IN THIS TOWN?

400
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,208
- Erza:
I HAVE NO IDEA.

401
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,833
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE
TO FIND OUT.

402
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,500
- I'M STILL THINKING
MAYBE I SHOULD GO HOME.

403
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:18,958
- HOLD ON, WHERE'S NATSU?

404
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,291
- ( groaning )
- ( Lucy screams )

405
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,250
- UH-OH, THERE HE GOES.

406
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,041
- WE WERE SO BUSY TALKING,
I FORGOT ABOUT HIM.

407
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:30,875
I AM SUCH A FOOL. NATSU HATES
ALL FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION.

408
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,708
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT. I NEED
ONE OF YOU TO COME AND HIT ME

409
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,916
FOR MY PENANCE.
- THAT'S A LITTLE MUCH.

410
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,625
- ( groans)
- WELL, LOOK IT HERE.

411
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,791
IT'S A FAIRY TAIL WIZARD.

412
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,791
HOW'S THE GUILD TREATING
YOU THESE DAYS?

413
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,250
IS IT WORTH STICKING AROUND?
- WHAT?

414
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,458
- DON'T ACT
ALL HIGH AND MIGHTY

415
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,750
JUST 'CAUSE YOU'RE IN
A LEGAL GUILD, MR. FAIRY.

416
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,583
YOU GUYS WHO JUST BLINDLY
FOLLOW THE MAGIC COUNCIL.

417
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,208
KNOW WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE TO US?
HARMLESS LITTLE FLIES.

418
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,666
( laughs )

419
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,250
 GUESS I HIT A NERVE.

420
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,666
- YOU-- ( groans )

421
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,500
- ( laughs )
WHAT KIND OF MAGIC IS THAT?

422
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,166
LET ME SHOW YOU
HOW IT'S DONE. 

423
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,541
IT'S ALL IN THE FOLLOW-THROUGH.

424
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,666
- THAT MAGIC...

425
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,916
- ( chuckles )

426
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,291
- ( brakes screech )

427
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:24,000
- ( both grunt )

428
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,000
- WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
DOING, LADY? YOU CAN'T PULL

429
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,666
THE EMERGENCY LEVER
WITHOUT PERMISSION.

430
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,875
- IT'S FOR OUR COMRADE.
PLEASE UNDERSTAND.

431
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,416
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

432
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
- NOW I WOULD LIKE YOU TO
TAKE OUR LUGGAGE

433
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,500
TO THE HOTEL.
- DO I LOOK LIKE A BELLHOP?

434
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,000
- I'M STARTING TO REALIZE
THAT ALL OF THE WIZARDS

435
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,333
IN THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD
ARE JUST A LITTLE INSANE.

436
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:41,708
- Happy: WOW...
- WELL, NOT ALL OF US.

437
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,333
- OH, YEAH, WHERE ARE
YOUR CLOTHES?!

438
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:48,583
- THE TRAIN STOPPED.
WHAT IS THAT?

439
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,458
- ( groans )
 YOU SAW IT.

440
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:53,583
- THAT'S ENOUGH OUT OF YOU.
IT'S PAYBACK TIME.

441
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,833
( grunting )

442
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,041
- GUARD SHADOW!

443
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,625
- ( explosion )

444
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,583
- LUCKY SHOT.

445
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,625
- HMM.  LITTLE FLY, HUH?

446
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:06,958
- Woman on P.A.:
ATTENTION, ALL PASSENGERS,

447
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,208
OUR EMERGENCY STOP
WAS A FALSE ALARM.

448
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,708
WE'LL BE DEPARTING AGAIN
SHORTLY.

449
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,208
- OH, CRAP, I GOTTA GO.
- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE! 

450
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,208
I'M NOT LETTING YOU
GET AWAY THAT EASILY.

451
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,000
YOU'RE MESSING WITH
EISENWALD NOW.

452
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,416
- OH, SO YOU'RE WITH
EISENWALD, HUH?

453
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,708
I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT HAPPENS
TO PEOPLE WHO KNOCK FAIRY TAIL.

454
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,000
HOW 'BOUT WE TAKE THIS OUTSIDE?

455
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,166
- ( rumbling ) 
- Both: WHOA...

456
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,708
- ( gags )

457
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,708
- Narrator:
THIS IS A MAGIC-MOBILE.

458
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:32,000
IT'S A FAST VEHICLE THAT RUNS
ON THE DRIVER'S MAGIC ENERGY.

459
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,375
- Lucy:
 NATSU!

460
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:36,333
- ( screams )

461
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,708
- ( all grunt, scream )

462
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,541
- NATSU, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

463
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,125
- UH...
- Happy: ( in pain ) AYE!

464
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,916
- THAT HURT, YOU IDIOT!

465
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,625
- SHUT UP, YOU ICY FREAK.

466
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:48,875
HOW COME YOU GUYS LEFT
ME ON THE TRAIN?

467
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,083
- I'M JUST THANKFUL YOU
 WEREN'T BADLY INJURED.

468
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,666
I APOLOGIZE, NATSU.
- HUH!  IT'S OKAY. 

469
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,541
WELL, I'M SHAKEN UP
PRETTY BAD.

470
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,708
I GOT ATTACKED BY
A WEIRDO ON THE TRAIN.

471
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,166
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

472
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,000
- I THINK IT'S THE DUDE THAT
DRAGGED AWAY THE GUYS

473
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,833
WHO WERE GONNA EAT HAPPY.
SAID HE WAS WITH EISENWALD.

474
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,666
AAH!
- YOU FOOL!

475
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,166
THAT IS EXACTLY WHO WE'RE
CHASING AFTER ON THIS MISSION.

476
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,750
WHY DID YOU LET HIM GET AWAY?!

477
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,166
- WHAT THE-- THIS IS
THE FIRST I HEARD ABOUT IT.

478
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,708
- I EXPLAINED EVERYTHING
ON THE TRAIN.

479
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,500
YOU SHOULD LISTEN
WHEN PEOPLE TALK TO YOU.

480
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,125
- SHE ALREADY FORGOT THAT
SHE KNOCKED HIM OUT, DIDN'T SHE?

481
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,041
THIS WOMAN IS UNBELIEVABLE.

482
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,875
- YEP.
- THAT'S ERZA FOR YA.

483
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,291
- SO HE WAS ON THE SAME TRAIN
THAT WE WERE ON.

484
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:28,125
LET'S FIND HIM.
- BUT WHAT WAS THIS GUY LIKE?

485
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,041
- HE DIDN'T LOOK LIKE SOMEBODY
FROM A DARK GUILD.

486
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,666
BUT HE DID HAVE THIS STRANGE
FLUTE THING.

487
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,291
IT LOOKED LIKE A SKULL,
EXCEPT IT HAD THREE EYES.

488
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,041
- Lucy:
THE THREE-EYED SKULL?

489
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,416
- Gray:
THAT'S CREEPY.

490
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,416
- IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG,
LUCY?

491
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,000
- IT'S JUST, I'VE HEARD 
ABOUT THAT FLUTE BEFORE.

492
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,375
LULLABY...
THE CURSED SONG.

493
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,750
IT'S DEATH MAGIC.

494
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:52,583
- WHAT? - A CURSED SONG?
LIKE AN INCANTATION?

495
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,333
- I'VE ONLY EVER READ ABOUT THEM
IN BOOKS BEFORE,

496
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,250
BUT THERE'S SOME DEADLY SPELLS
OUT THERE

497
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,333
THAT ARE FORBIDDEN
TO BE USED BY WIZARDS.

498
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:02,333
- THAT'S RIGHT, THERE ARE
CURSED BLACK MAGIC SPELLS

499
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,208
THAT WILL KILL THE PERSON
THEY'RE USED ON.

500
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:07,333
- WELL, IF I'M RIGHT,
LULLABY IS EVEN WORSE.

501
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,500
- ( screaming )

502
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,416
- THIS TRAIN BELONGS
TO EISENWALD NOW.

503
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,833
- Narrator:
KUNUGI STATION.

504
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,750
- GET EVERYTHING
 OFF THE TRAIN--

505
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,250
LUGGAGE, THE CONDUCTOR,
ALL OF IT.

506
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,583
IF ANYONE TRIES TO DEFY US,
KILL THEM ALL.

507
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,750
- WELL, LOOK WHO'S HERE.
- KAGEYAMA.

508
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,958
I HEARD YOU WERE COMING BACK
ABOARD THIS TRAIN.

509
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:30,000
THAT'S QUITE A BIT OF WRECKAGE.
CARE TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED? 

510
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,791
- COME ON, AREN'T YOU
INTERESTED TO SEE

511
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,291
WHAT I BROUGHT BACK WITH ME?

512
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,750
HA-HA, I FINALLY MANAGED TO
BREAK THE SEAL. - EXCELLENT.

513
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,416
- OH, YEAH.
- IS THAT IT?

514
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,500
- YES, THIS IS IT, MEN.
 THE FORBIDDEN LULLABY.

515
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:47,000
ORIGINALLY, IT WAS A TOOL
FOR CASTING SIMPLE DEATH CURSES.

516
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,958
USEFUL, BUT LIMITED.

517
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,125
THAT IS UNTIL THE GREAT
BLACK WIZARD ZEREF

518
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,750
TRANSFORMED IT
INTO A DEMON FLUTE.

519
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,833
NOW ITS SONG
WILL KILL HUNDREDS,

520
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,666
THOUSANDS AT ONCE,

521
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,291
LULLING THEM ALL INTO
ENDLESS SLEEP.

522
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,875
AND IT'S ALL MINE.

523
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,166
- HEY, SLOW DOWN, ERZA.

524
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,583
YOU'RE USING TOO MUCH OF YOUR
POWER DRIVING THIS THING.

525
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,875
- I HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO PRESS ONWARD.

526
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,083
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

527
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,083
IF ERIGOR GETS HIS HANDS
ON THIS DEATH MAGIC,

528
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,916
TRUST ME,
LIVES WILL BE LOST.

529
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:23,125
CURSE THEM.

530
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,333
WHAT IS IT THEY HOPE
TO ACCOMPLISH?

531
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:27,333
THIS IS MADNESS.

532
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,125
- ( laughing )

533
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:32,333
AND SO IT BEGINS.
LET'S MOVE FORWARD, MEN.

534
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,791
- ( end theme playing )

535
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,125
- ( shouts )

536
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:46,041
- ( singing in Japanese )

537
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,375
- HEY, MIRA, DO YOU THINK
ERZA'S SCARY?

538
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:16,958
- OH, NO, I DON'T 
THINK THAT AT ALL.

539
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,500
I THINK SHE'S SWEET.
- ( sighs )

540
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,625
THANK GOODNESS.
THAT'S SUCH A RELIEF TO HEAR.

541
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:21,875
- BUT IF YOU MAKE HER MAD,

542
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:23,625
SHE MIGHT SEND YOU
FLYING WITH A PUNCH.

543
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:25,458
OR BURY YOU UP TO 
YOUR NECK IN DIRT,

544
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:27,625
WHICH MIGHT BE UNCOMFORTABLE.
- OH, MY GOSH!

545
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:29,833
I DON'T WANT ANY OF
THAT STUFF TO HAPPEN TO ME!

546
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:32,541
- ( Mira and Lucy speaking )

547
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:34,583
- Mira:
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY,

548
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:36,625
SHE JUST TAKES SOME
GETTING USED TO, YOU KNOW?

549
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,916
( chuckles ) SHE USED TO GET MAD
AT GRAY AND NATSU ALL THE TIME.

550
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,500
- OH, I'M SURE SHE'LL GET MAD
AT ME BEFORE TOO LONG.
