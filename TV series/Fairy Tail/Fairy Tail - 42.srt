1
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,083
HEY GUYS! READY FOR
SOME MORE "FAIRY TAIL"?

2
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:22,291
JUST MAKE SURE
THAT WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING,

3
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,750
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE ROOM

4
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:26,833
AND DON'T SIT TOO CLOSE
TO THE TV.

5
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,500
- HOW MANY TIMES
I GOTTA TELL YA?

6
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:36,541
WATCH OUT, BLONDIE!
- OH!

7
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,833
MAN, THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

8
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,500
( sighs )

9
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,541
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND
A DECENT JOB LATELY.

10
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,875
IF I CAN'T PAY RENT,
I'LL GET KICKED OUT.

11
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,916
- ( cooing )
- WHAT?

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,125
YOU THINK IT'LL ALL WORK OUT?

13
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:53,208
- WELL, THAT'S A POSITIVE
ATTITUDE IF I'VE EVER SEEN ONE.

14
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,833
- ( theme music playing )

15
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

16
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,916
- LOOKS LIKE WE'RE ALONE
FOR ONCE.

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,375
I WISH I COULD JUST COME HOME

18
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,583
WITHOUT HAVING TO SEARCH
THE PLACE FOR WEIRDOES.

19
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:39,958
- ( cooing )

20
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,291
- YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN THROUGH
AN AWFUL LOT LATELY.

21
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:44,041
I THINK I DESERVE A NICE,
LONG BATH.

22
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,583
AH, BACK FROM THE DEAD.

23
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,750
PRETTY CUTE FOR A ZOMBIE,
DON'TCHA THINK?

24
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,000
IT'S A SHAME
THAT THERE'S NOBODY HERE

25
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,666
TO LAUGH AT MY JOKES.

26
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,250
- ( cooing )

27
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,375
- HEY, YOU GET ALL WRINKLY
IN THE TUB JUST LIKE I DO!

28
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,375
WHO WOULD'VE KNOWN?

29
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,333
AW, PLUE,
YOU'RE SO CUTE!

30
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:09,000
- ( Happy speaking )

31
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,041
- TIME FOR BED.

32
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,541
( squeals )

33
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,708
THIS BETTER NOT BE
WHAT I THINK IT IS.

34
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:26,625
AH!

35
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,291
- ( moaning )

36
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,541
- AHHH!

37
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,500
- G'MORNING.
- DON'T PLAY COOL.

38
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:35,333
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY ROOM
IN MY BED WITH YOUR CAT?

39
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,458
- AYE?
- GO AWAY!

40
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:41,416
- FIVE MORE MINUTES.
- YOU MUST BE DREAMING.

41
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,250
- GIVE NATSU HIS SCARF BACK,
YOU MEANIE.

42
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,750
- IS IT THAT IMPORTANT TO HIM?

43
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,125
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
WITHOUT IT.

44
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,041
HE NEVER
TAKES THIS THING OFF, HUH?

45
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:53,166
- NOPE, HE GOT IT FROM IGNEEL,
SO IT MEANS A LOT TO HIM.

46
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,708
- HM.
- ( Natsu moaning )

47
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,000
- HEY.  ARE YOU SURE
HE'S GONNA BE OKAY?

48
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:03,000
- AYE.  HE'S PROBABLY
JUST FEELIN' A LITTLE SICKLY

49
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,625
'CAUSE HE ATE
ALL THAT ETHER-NANO.

50
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,166
- OH, IS THAT BAD FOR HIM?
- AYE.

51
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,208
ONE TIME HE ATE
A BUNCH OF LAXUS' LIGHTNING

52
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,000
AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED.

53
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:14,166
- MMM.  SO EATING ANYTHING
OTHER THAN FIRE MAKES HIM SICK?

54
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,125
WAIT.  WHY WOULD HE EVER
WANNA EAT LAXUS' LIGHTNING?

55
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,041
- WELL, HE DIDN'T WANNA EAT IT.

56
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,625
THEY FOUGHT AND NATSU
GOT HIS BUTT WHOOPED PRETTY BAD.

57
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,958
- ( screaming )

58
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:28,125
- WOW, I HAD NO IDEA
HE WAS THAT POWERFUL.

59
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,416
- AYE.
HE'S SUPER DUPER STRONG.

60
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,875
WHO KNOWS? MAYBE ERZA OR
MYSTOGAN MIGHT BE ABLE

61
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,125
TO BEAT HIM NOW.

62
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,833
ACTUALLY, MIRA WAS PRETTY TOUGH
BACK IN THE DAY.

63
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,083
SHE EVEN HAD THE NICKNAME
"THE SHE DEVIL."

64
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,541
- BUT SHE'S SO SWEET.

65
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,041
- WE SHOULD HAVE
A BIG TOURNAMENT

66
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,666
TO DECIDE WHO'S THE STRONGEST.

67
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,916
IT MIGHT BE FUN TO FIND
OUT WHERE YOU STAND, HUH?

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,750
- I'M FINE NOT KNOWING.

69
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,875
AND BESIDES, I DON'T LIKE
THE IDEA OF RANKING MY FRIENDS.

70
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,166
- I WONDER HOW GRAY
AND ELFMAN WOULD DO?

71
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,500
GAJEEL AND JUVIA
ARE PRETTY AWESOME TOO.

72
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,625
- YEAH, I GET IT.
EVERYONE'S GREAT BUT ME.

73
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,333
NOW IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO HEAD HOME, 'KAY?

74
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:01,750
- OKAY.
- WHAT'VE YOU GOT HERE?

75
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,125
- OH!  I FORGOT I WAS
SUPPOSED TO SHOW THAT TO YOU.

76
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,958
YOU NEED MONEY FOR RENT,
RIGHT?

77
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:09,458
FAIRY TAIL IS GONNA BE PART
OF THE HARVEST FESTIVAL.

78
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,375
- HOW'S THAT HELP ME?

79
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:14,250
CHECK IT OUT AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE PAGE.

80
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,833
- "MISS FAIRY TAIL CONTEST"?

81
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,666
- AYE.
AND AS YOU CAN SEE,

82
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,208
THE WINNER
GETS 500,000 JEWEL.

83
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,541
- OH MY GOSH, IF I COULD
JUST WIN THAT PRIZE MONEY,

84
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,416
I COULD COVER RENT
FOR THE NEXT SEVEN MONTHS.

85
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,875
- EVEN THOUGH MIRA AND CANA
ARE ENTERING THE CONTEST TOO,

86
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,916
YOU MIGHT STILL
HAVE A SHOT AT IT.

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,458
- IF MIRA'S COMPETING,
I DON'T STAND A CHANCE.

88
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,625
SHE'S A BIKINI MODEL
FOR "SORCERER WEEKLY."

89
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,000
AW, BUT WAIT.
I'M YOUNGER THAN SHE IS,

90
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,666
WHICH MAKES ME
THE EXCITING NEW MODEL!

91
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,291
I CAN DO IT!

92
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,416
YEAH!
BRING IT ON!

93
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,208
THAT PRIZE MONEY
IS AS GOOD AS MINE!

94
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,375
- SO YOU'RE AGAINST
RANKING YOUR FRIENDS

95
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,750
UNLESS THERE'S MONEY INVOLVED,
IS THAT IT?

96
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,208
- HAPPY, YOU WANNA
EAT SOME YUMMY FISH?

97
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:57,291
- I SEE. YOUR GUILTY CONSCIENCE
IS GETTIN' TO YA, HUH?

98
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,416
- MMHH!

99
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,791
- Narrator: THIS IS THE TOWN
OF SHIROTSUME.

100
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,958
IN ITS NORTHERN CORNER
LIES A DARK GUILD

101
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,250
KNOWN AS GHOUL SPIRIT.

102
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,458
- AHHH!

103
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:14,708
- YOU LAUGHED AT US,
DIDN'T YOU?  BIG MISTAKE.

104
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,083
- IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A FIGHT,
YOU GOT ONE!

105
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,708
- AHHH!

106
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,958
- TO THINK THAT A PACK OF RATS
WOULD HAVE THE AUDACITY

107
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,791
TO MOCK MEMBERS
OF A PROPER GUILD.

108
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,166
WHAT IS THE WORLD COMING TO?

109
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,666
- AHHH!

110
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,166
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- THEY TURNED TO STONE.

111
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,625
- YOU'LL PAY FOR THAT!
- AHHH!

112
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:37,416
- C'MON, BABIES.
LET'S PARTY!

113
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,416
( laughing )

114
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,750
- Fried: I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH,
BIXLOW.

115
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,291
- WHAT?
Y'MEAN WE'RE DONE ALREADY?

116
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,375
- LET'S NOT WASTE OUR TIME
WITH THESE WEAKLINGS.

117
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,000
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY EVEN
BOTHERED TO FORM A GUILD.

118
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,791
- BUT WE CAN'T LEAVE JUST YET.

119
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,375
MY LITTLE BABIES ARE LOOKIN'
TO HAVE MORE FUN.

120
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,083
- MORE FUN!  MORE FUN!
- BE PATIENT.

121
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:04,166
I ASSURE YOU THEY'LL SEE
PLENTY OF ACTION SOON ENOUGH.

122
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,958
- SO WE'RE GOING THROUGH
WITH LAXUS' PLAN?

123
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,875
I SUPPOSE IT'S ABOUT TIME.

124
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,000
- YOU BETTER NOT
BE JERKING MY CHAIN,

125
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,458
CAUSE I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS.

126
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:16,500
MY BABIES TOO.
YAH HA HA!

127
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:19,333
- WHO THE HECK ARE THESE GUYS?
THERE'S ONLY THREE OF 'EM--

128
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,500
HOW COULD THEY TAKE OUT
OUR WHOLE GUILD LIKE THAT?

129
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,750
- HOLD ON.
THAT'S THE THUNDER LEGION.

130
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:28,458
SOME OF FAIRY TAIL'S BEST
AND LAXUS' PERSONAL GUARDS.

131
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,500
- ( chuckling )

132
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,500
THE THUNDER LEGION'LL
BE BACK SOON.

133
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,291
LOOKS LIKE MY TIME
HAS FINALLY COME.

134
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:40,291
YOUR LITTLE FAIRIES
ARE GONNA EAT EACH OTHER ALIVE.

135
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,083
HEAR THAT, OLD MAN?

136
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:45,208
YOUR ERA'S
ABOUT TO COME TO AN END.

137
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,291
- Makarov: THE WHOLE TOWN'S
GETTING INTO

138
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,541
THE HARVEST FESTIVAL SPIRIT.

139
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:53,625
- AND EVERYONE AT
THE GUILD'S GETTING READY

140
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,250
FOR THE FANTASIA PARADE.

141
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,500
- OF COURSE, PEOPLE COME
FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY

142
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,583
TO SEE OUR PARADE. WE CAN'T
LET OUR FANS DOWN, CAN WE?

143
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,000
- IT WOULD BE NICE IF LAXUS
WOULD JOIN US FOR ONCE.

144
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,416
- THE LESS SAID ABOUT THAT BUM,
THE BETTER.

145
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,458
- I HEARD FROM LEVY
THAT HE'S BACK IN TOWN.

146
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,875
EVEN IF HE SAYS NO,
IT WOULDN'T HURT TO ASK HIM.

147
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:13,375
- HE CAME BACK?  MMMHH.

148
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:16,333
- SOMETHING WRONG?

149
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:20,416
- OF ALL TIMES,
WHY'D HE HAVE TO SHOW UP NOW?

150
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,375
- Young Laxus: HEY, GRAMPS!

151
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:23,541
GRAMPS!

152
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,958
HEY, WAIT UP!
- OH, HI, LAXUS.

153
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,708
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA JOIN
THE FANTASIA PARADE

154
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,166

308
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,708
- NO!  MIRA!
- SHE GOT ERZA TOO?

309
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:38,333
- DON'T BE A FOOL! RETURN THEM
TO NORMAL THIS INSTANT.

310
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,750
- WELL, LOOKS LIKE ALL YOUR FANS
DECIDED TO HEAD HOME.

311
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,625
- PITY, 'CAUSE THE PARTY'S
ABOUT TO START.

312
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,125
- I SHOULD'VE KNOWN.

313
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:54,166
- Gray: FRIED?  BIXLOW, TOO?

314
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,041
- THE THUNDER LEGION.

315
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,500
- WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU GUYS
TRYIN' TO PULL?

316
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,375
- C'MON,
LET'S HAVE SOME FUN!

317
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,000
- I'VE HAD ABOUT ENOUGH
OF YOUR NONSENSE.

318
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,125
TURN THEM BACK, OR ELSE.

319
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,250
- YOU'D BETTER PLAY NICE IF
YOU WANT THESE LADIES

320
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,708
TO JOIN THE PARADE.

321
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:14,500
- NO, STOP!

322
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,916
- IN OTHER WORDS,
I'M TAKING ALL OF THEM HOSTAGE.

323
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,333
BREAK THE RULES AND I'LL
SHATTER THESE CHICKS ONE BY ONE.

324
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,166
OR I COULD JUST SMASH 'EM ALL
RIGHT NOW.

325
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,875
- Makarov: I'M NOT AMUSED,
LAXUS. STOP FOOLING AROUND.

326
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,458
- I'M SERIOUS, OLD MAN.

327
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:31,208
- I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED WHO WAS
THE STRONGEST IN THE GUILD.

328
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,916
NOW IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT.

329
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,583
- YEAH, LET'S HAVE SOME FUN.
- FUN, FUN!

330
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,291
- THERE'S ONLY ONE RULE.

331
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,708
WHO'S EVER LEFT STANDING
IN THE END IS THE WINNER.

332
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,916
IT'S A FAIRY-TAIL
BATTLE ROYALE!

333
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,666
- NICE AND SIMPLE.
THAT'S JUST HOW I LIKE IT.

334
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,416
I'M FIRED UP NOW.

335
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
- GLAD YOU COULD SEE IT MY WAY.

336
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:55,250
IF NOTHING ELSE,
YOU GOT THE RIGHT ATTITUDE.

337
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,458
- NATSU.

338
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,875
- THIS IS A FESTIVAL,
RIGHT? LET'S PARTY.

339
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,166
- HAVE YOU ALREADY FORGOTTEN
HOW BADLY HE BEAT YOU

340
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,083
THE LAST TIME YOU GUYS
WENT AT IT?

341
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,750
- Natsu:
I WAS JUST A KID BACK THEN.

342
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,458
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THAT WAS LAST YEAR!

343
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,666
- YEAH, BUT SINCE THEN,
I'VE BECOME A MAN.

344
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,083
- ON THE OTHER HAND,
I THINK THAT ATTITUDE OF YOURS

345
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,875
IS GONNA GET YOU INTO A WORLD
OF HURT.

346
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,875
- WHY DON'T YOU SIT BACK DOWN?

347
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,458
- AHH!
- NATSU.

348
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,875
- I TOLD YOU SO.
- HE'S NO MAN.

349
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,500
- POOR GUY.  HE WAS FINALLY
FEELING BETTER TOO.

350
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,583
- NATURALLY, IF YOU WANT ME TO
TURN THE GIRLS BACK TO NORMAL,

351
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,666
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO DEFEAT US FIRST.

352
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,291
- BUT THOSE ODDS AREN'T BAD.

353
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,583
THERE'S FOUR OF US
AND LIKE A HUNDRED OF YOU GUYS.

354
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,083
- LOTS OF YOU.
LOTS OF YOU!

355
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,750
- YOU HAVE THREE HOURS
AND NOT A SECOND MORE.

356
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,833
AFTER THAT, THESE PRETTY STATUES
OF YOURS

357
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,875
WILL BE REDUCED TO DUST. 
- YOU KIDDIN' ME?

358
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,750
- Laxus: ALL OF MAGNOLIA WILL
SERVE AS THE BATTLEFIELD.

359
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,958
THE FIGHT WILL BEGIN WHEN,
AND IF, YOU CAN FIND US.

360
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,625
- LAXUS, HOW COULD YOU?

361
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,916
I WON'T STAND FOR THIS!

362
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,333
- NOW NOW,
SIMMER DOWN, OLD MAN.

363
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:57,416
IT'S ALL PART OF THE FESTIVAL,
RIGHT?

364
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,916
IT'LL BE FUN! 
- CAN'T SEE.

365
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,583
- Laxus: LET THE BATTLE
OF FAIRY TAIL BEGIN!

366
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,875
- Alzack: HE DISAPPEARED.

367
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,500
- Macao: SO IT'S HIGH-STAKES
HIDE AND GO SEEK, HUH?

368
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:13,041
- LET'S GO! WE GOTTA MAN UP
AND SAVE OUR GIRLS.

369
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,958
- ( all shouting )

370
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,916
- BISCA.
HOLD ON.

371
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,458
I'LL DO EVERYTHING I CAN
TO SAVE YOU.

372
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,708
- YOU INSOLENT BRAT!

373
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,375
JUST WAIT!

374
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:32,750
I'LL STOP YOU
WITH MY OWN TWO HANDS!  AH!

375
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,958
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- AN INVISIBLE WALL.

376
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,083
- DON'T BE SILLY, GRAMPS,
THERE'S NOTHIN' HERE.

377
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,708
MAN, WHAT'S THE DEAL?

378
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:47,708
WHAT'S THAT FLOATING ABOVE US?
LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND OF WRITING.

379
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,541
- MUST BE ONE OF
FRIED'S ENCHANTMENTS.

380
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,458
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"ENCHANTMENT"?

381
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,958
- IT'S A BARRIER FORMED
BY MAGIC RUNES.

382
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,500
ANYONE WHO STEPS INSIDE
IS BOUND BY ITS RULES

383
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,583
AND THE ONLY WAY TO ESCAPE
IS TO FOLLOW THEM.

384
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,708
- ANY IDEA WHAT IT SAYS?

385
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,875
- "STONE STATUES AND ANYONE OVER
THE AGE OF 80 YEARS

386
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,166
SHALL NOT PASS."

387
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,166
- WHOEVER WRITES THE RULES
WINS THE FIGHT, HUH?

388
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,333
- PERHAPS, BUT ENCHANTMENTS
LIKE THESE TAKE TIME TO WRITE.

389
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,416
AS SUCH, THEY WOULD BE USELESS
IN A ONE-ON-ONE BATTLE.

390
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,958
STILL, AS YOU CAN SEE,

391
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,250
THEY'RE QUITE EFFECTIVE
IF SET UP AS TRAPS.

392
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,000
- YOU'RE REALLY STUCK?
YOU CAN'T BREAK THROUGH?

393
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:26,041
- I'M AFRAID THE RULES
OF THE ENCHANTMENT ARE ABSOLUTE.

394
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,750
- WELL,
I GUESS THAT SETTLES IT.

395
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,083
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GO INTO THIS FIGHT

396
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:31,916
WITHOUT YA, GRAMPS.

397
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,625
- I'M SORRY.

398
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:36,958
- I WON'T SHOW MERCY,
EVEN IF LAXUS IS YOUR GRANDSON.

399
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,666
HE'S GONNA PAY FOR THIS.

400
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:44,041
- I DON'T KNOW IF GRAY
OR ANYONE ELSE IN THE GUILD

401
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:47,875
IS STRONG ENOUGH TO BEAT HIM.
ERZA PERHAPS.

402
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,750
BUT NOT
IN HER PRESENT CONDITION.

403
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,583
MMHH.

404
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:56,125
I SEE YOU.
- AH.

405
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,625
- WHAT'S WRONG, REEDUS?

406
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,125
- WELL, I'M AFRAID LAXUS
IS GONNA HURT ME.

407
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,000
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

408
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,833
WHY DON'T YOU VISIT PORLYUSICA
IN THE EAST FOREST?

409
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,083
- OUI?

410
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,458
- SHE MAY HAVE A POTION
TO CURE PETRIFICATION.

411
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,416
- OUI.

412
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,125
- AHHH!
- YOU'RE AWAKE!

413
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,208
- HOLD ON.
WHERE'D LAXUS GO?

414
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,500
ACTUALLY, WHERE'D EVERYONE GO?
- NATSU.

415
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:23,458
IF HE GOT SERIOUS, HE MIGHT BE
STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL IT OFF.

416
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:26,125
- GRAMPS, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE EVERYBODY ELSE RAN OFF TO?

417
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:29,916
- I'LL HAVE TO PUT MY FAITH
IN HIS RAW TALENT.

418
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,916
NOW LISTEN UP--
THE FESTIVAL IS UNDER WAY.

419
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,625
LAXUS IS HIDING SOMEWHERE
IN MAGNOLIA.

420
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,750
FIND HIM AND BEAT HIM!

421
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:43,166
- ALL RIGHT!
JUST YOU WAIT LA--

422
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:47,125
- AH!
- UH, WHAT THE HECK?

423
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,875
- YOU FIND ANYONE, ALZACK?

424
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,041
- NOPE, NO LUCK HERE.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

425
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,791
- SORRY.
WE GOT NOTHIN'.

426
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,208
- DAMN IT!
HOW DARE THEY DO THAT TO BISCA?

427
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,291
- WHOA, JUST TRY
AND TAKE IT EASY, MAN.

428
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,500
- TAKE IT EASY?
WE ONLY HAVE THREE HOURS.

429
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,958
- WHAT THE--? A TRAP?
- Alzack: IT'S AN ENCHANTMENT.

430
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:09,125
- ARE YOU TELLING ME THEY PUT
THESE THINGS UP ALL OVER TOWN?

431
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,750
- IT MUST BE FRIED'S WORK.

432
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:16,958
- IT SAYS: "ONLY THE WIZARD
WHO PROVES HIMSELF TO BE

433
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,458
THE STRONGEST IS
ALLOWED TO LEAVE

434
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:19,250
THIS BARRIER."

435
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,958
- BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

436
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,083
- I THINK HE'S TRYING TO MAKE US
FIGHT EACH OTHER.

437
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,916
- THAT'S A DIRTY TRICK, FRIED!

438
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,208
- ALL RIGHT.  SORRY.

439
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,833
BUT I GOTTA SAVE HER!

440
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,416
- Makarov:
WHY CAN'T YOU GET THROUGH?

441
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,708
OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE NOT
A STONE STATUE.

442
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:38,791
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE OVER 80?
- I DON'T THINK SO.

443
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,708
- "BATTLE OF FAIRY TAIL
STATUS REPORT."

444
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:46,791
- WHAT? IT SAYS "JET VERSUS
DROY VERSUS ALZACK."

445
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,416
IS THIS SOME KIND OF JOKE?
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND

446
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,250
WHY THOSE GUYS WOULD BE FIGHTING
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

447
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,958
- FALCON HEAVEN SOAR!

448
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,958
- KNUCKLE PLANT!

449
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:10,875
- GUNS MAGIC!
TORNADO SHOT!

450
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,666
"THE WINNER IS ALZACK.
JET AND DROY K.O.-ED."

451
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,833
- WHAT?

452
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,708
- PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

453
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,500
- LET'S SEE HOW LONG
YOU CAN ENDURE

454
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,958
THIS GAME OF FAIRY-EAT-FAIRY,
OLD GEEZER.

455
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:39,875
- STOP THIS STUPID GAME
RIGHT NOW!  LAXUS!

456
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,958
- ( theme music playing )

457
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:46,541
- ( singing in Japanese )

458
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:16,125
- THE THUNDER LEGION
IS FINALLY READY TO FIGHT.

459
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,291
EVERGREEN, BIXLOW, FRIED.

460
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,708
I'M TELLING YOU, THOSE GUYS
ARE CRAZY STRONG!

461
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:22,833
I'M GETTING ALL FIRED UP!

462
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:24,500
- WELL, I HATE
TO BURST YOUR BUBBLE,

463
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:26,541
BUT NO MATTER HOW BAD
YOU WANNA FIGHT THEM,

464
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:28,583
YOU CAN'T 'CAUSE YOU'RE
STILL STUCK INSIDE THAT BARRIER.

465
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,625
- YEAH.
I FORGOT ABOUT THAT.

466
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:33,375
- Both: NEXT TIME, "DEFEAT YOUR
FRIENDS TO SAVE YOUR FRIENDS."

467
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:36,208
- Happy: I DON'T THINK GAJEEL
CAN LEAVE THE BARRIER EITHER.

468
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:37,791
WHY DON'T YOU GET TO KNOW
EACH OTHER BETTER

469
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,083
OVER A NICE CUP OF TEA?

470
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:41,500
- I AIN'T DRINKING TEA
WITH THAT GUY!
