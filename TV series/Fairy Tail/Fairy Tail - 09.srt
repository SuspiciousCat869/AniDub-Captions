1
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:20,708
- Narrator: IN A LAND
FAR, FAR AWAY

2
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:23,041
LIES THE KINGDOM
OF FIORE.

3
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:26,208
A SMALL, PEACEFUL NATION
OF 17 MILLION,

4
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,791
AND A PLACE FILLED
WITH MAGIC.

5
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,291
FOUND IN EVERY HOME,

6
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,041
BOUGHT AND SOLD
IN EVERY MARKETPLACE.

7
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,375
FOR MOST, MAGIC IS
MERELY A TOOL,

8
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,958
A MUNDANE PART
OF EVERYDAY LIFE.

9
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,333
FOR SOME, HOWEVER,
MAGIC IS AN ART,

10
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:42,416
AND THEY'VE DEVOTED
THEIR LIVES TO ITS PRACTICE.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,666
THESE ARE THE WIZARDS.

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,833
BANDED TOGETHER INTO
MAGICAL GUILDS,

13
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:50,416
THEY PLY THEIR SKILLS
IN SEARCH OF FAME AND FORTUNE.

14
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,375
MANY SUCH GUILDS DOT
THE LANDSCAPE OF FIORE.

15
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:57,416
BUT THERE IS A CERTAIN GUILD
IN A CERTAIN TOWN

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,750
THAT SOARS HIGH
ABOVE THE REST.

17
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,583
ONE FROM WHICH COUNTLESS LEGENDS
HAVE BEEN BORN.

18
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:05,750
A GUILD THAT WOULD NO DOUBT
CONTINUE TO CREATE LEGENDS

19
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,416
WELL INTO THE FUTURE.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,500
ITS NAME IS FAIRY TAIL.

21
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,958
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

22
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,625
- Natsu:
PREVIOUSLY ON "FAIRY TAIL."

23
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,125
TEAMING UP WITH YOU IS
THE WORST IDEA EVER!

24
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,541
- YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.

25
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,125
- Erza: THE TWO OF YOU ARE THE
STRONGEST WIZARDS HERE.

26
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,916
- Gray: EISENWALD?

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,208
- Erza: WE HAVE TO STOP THEM
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!

28
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,541
- Lucy: NATSU!

29
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,375
- ( grunts, screams )

30
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,833
- Lucy:
KAGEYAMA HAS THE LULLABY.

31
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:00,958
- Erza:
THE MASTER IS IN DANGER!

32
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,125
- Lucy:
THAT'S LULLABY'S TRUE FORM?!

33
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,125
- ( shouts )

34
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,125
- ( grunts )

35
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,458
- ( grunts )

36
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,041
- Lucy:
THEY WENT OVERBOARD.

37
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,958
- THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

38
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,000
THESE ARE DEFINITELY
THEIR FOOTPRINTS.

39
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,833
FROM THE LOOKS OF IT,
IT'S BEEN TWO DAYS

40
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,458
SINCE THEY WERE HERE.

41
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,791
- IF THAT'S THE CASE,
THEN THEY SHOULD HAVE

42
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,833
REACHED MAGNOLIA
A LONG TIME AGO.

43
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,666
COULD MEAN TROUBLE.
NOW WHAT?

44
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,500
- ( sighs )
IT'S PROBABLY BEST

45
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,250
IF WE GIVE OUR REPORT
TO THE GUILD.

46
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,583
- WE'RE GOING BACK?

47
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,708
- ( squawking )

48
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,833
- Narrator:
SHE IS BISCA MULAN.

49
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,166
HE IS ALZACK CONNELL.

50
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,333
AS THEY RETURN TO FAIRY TAIL
FROM THEIR SCOUTING MISSION,

51
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:44,583
BOTH CARRY HEARTS
FULL OF UNCERTAINTY.

52
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:47,000
- OHH.
THIS IS NO GOOD AT ALL.

53
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,833
I NEED TO GIVE THEM A MESSAGE
FROM THE COUNCIL RIGHT AWAY. 

54
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:52,250
- DON'T BLAME ME.
I WANTED TO GO AFTER THEM.

55
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,791
- BUT THERE'D BE NO POINT.

56
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,833
I KNOW YOU'RE WORRIED,
BUT CLOVER CANYON

57
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,333
IS A DEATH TRAP.

58
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,666
EVEN WITH SOMEONE
FROM A HUNTER'S GUILD

59
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,333
TO GUIDE YOU,
IT WOULD SWALLOW YOU UP

60
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,833
AND NEVER SPIT YOU OUT.

61
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,833
- BUT IF IT'S A DANGEROUS
MAZE OF CANYONS,

62
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,791
WHY WOULD THEY EVEN 
WANT TO GO IN THERE?

63
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,958
- I DON'T KNOW.
BUT IT MUST BE IMPORTANT.

64
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,625
I'M SURE THE MASTER
CAN HANDLE THINGS, 

65
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,416
BUT I'M STILL
A LITTLE WORRIED.

66
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,333
- ( Happy speaking )

67
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,333
- AWW, JEEZ!

68
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,833
COME ON, HAPPY.

69
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,625
DON'T TELL ME THAT
YOU GOT US LOST AGAIN.

70
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,208
WE'VE BEEN WALKING FOR
FOREVER AND A HALF,

71
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,041
AND WE STILL HAVEN'T
FOUND MAGNOLIA YET. 

72
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,291
WHY ARE WE FOLLOWING
A CAT ANYWAY?!

73
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,041
- Narrator:
THIS IS WEB VALLEY,

74
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,291
HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN
CLOVER CANYON.

75
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,958
HERE, COUNTLESS FISSURES
PRODUCED BY ANCIENT EARTHQUAKES

76
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,291
FORM A FEARSOME MAZE.

77
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,541
MANY ADVENTURERS,
EITHER BRAVE OR FOOLISH,

78
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,916
HAVE ENTERED THIS PLACE
ONLY TO DECORATE ITS LANDSCAPE

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,666
WITH THEIR BONES.

80
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,666
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN "AGAIN"?
HOW RUDE!

81
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,333
I WASN'T LOST LAST TIME,

82
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,583
SO THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE GOTTEN US LOST.

83
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,583
- FIRST TIME OR NOT,
LET'S JUST TRY TO MAKE IT

84
00:04:58,666 --> 00:04:59,958
OUR LAST, OKAY?

85
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,208
( groans )

86
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,166
- MAN, I WANT SOME FOOD.

87
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,166
- WE ALL DO.  TALKING ABOUT IT
JUST MAKES US HUNGRIER.

88
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,250
- I CAN'T HELP IT
IF I'M HUNGRY, JERK.

89
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,500
- NO, BUT YOU CAN STOP
RUNNING YOUR MOUTH, CAN'T YOU?

90
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,250
- LISTEN UP!
WE NEED SOME FOOD.

91
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,125
- Both: YEAH, WE KNOW!

92
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,416
- ENOUGH.
( stomach growls )

93
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,416
- YOUR STOMACH'S TRYING TO TELL
YOU SOMETHING, ISN'T IT?

94
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,416
- NO, IT'S NOT.
YOU'RE HEARING THINGS.

95
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,875
- UH, YEAH.
REAL CONVINCING, ERZA.

96
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,291
- ( gasps, squeals )

97
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,666
- WHAT ARE YOU
EXCITED ABOUT?

98
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,708
- DOWN THERE!
LOOK, NATSU, LOOK!

99
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,208
- HUH?

100
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,541
- I CAN FLY!
- YOU CAN FLY!

101
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:37,791
- CAN YOU FLY!

102
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,291
- Happy:
THOSE ARE WINGFISH.

103
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,958
THEY'RE A LEGENDARY
DELICACY.

104
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,958
AND THEY'RE SUPER YUMMY,
FROM WHAT I HEAR.

105
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,500
YUM YUM YUM 
YUM YUM YUM!

106
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,291
- A LEGENDARY DELICACY?

107
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,875
- WINGFISH, HUH?

108
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,458
- SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

109
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,708
- WELL DONE, HAPPY.

110
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,541
YOU MAKE THIS
OLD MAN VERY PROUD.

111
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,208
- GUYS, ENOUGH WITH
THE GROWLING STOMACHS.

112
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,166
- ( growls )

113
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,125
- YOU WERE SAYING?
- SHUT UP.

114
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,291
- NOW, TIME TO FISH.

115
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,291
- ( wingfish chattering )

116
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,125
- AW, COME ON,
YOU STUPID FISH.

117
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,083
JUST SHUT UP
AND LET ME EAT YOU.

118
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,333
- WE GOTTA FISH HARDER,
GUYS.

119
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:12,916
- I DON'T KNOW.
ARE YOU SURE THESE THINGS

120
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,500
REALLY TASTE THAT GOOD?

121
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,000
- BE QUIET AND FISH.
ANYTHING EDIBLE WILL DO.

122
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,041
- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE THAT HUNGRY.

123
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,833
- YOU'RE GOING IN MY BELLY!

124
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,291
RIGHT NOW, YOU HEAR?

125
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:25,083
HAPPY'S GONNA 
EAT YOU, FISH.

126
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,291
WHATEVER.  I GIVE UP.
- THAT WAS FAST.

127
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:33,000
- WELL, I COULDN'T CATCH
A SINGLE FISH.

128
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,166
- YOU REALLY WANT TO
EAT ONE, DON'T YOU? 

129
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,000
YOU SHOULDN'T GIVE UP
SO EASILY.

130
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,666
YOU CAN DO IT,
LITTLE GUY.

131
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,958
- ( murmurs )

132
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,000
I CAN'T HELP
THAT I'M LITTLE!

133
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,916
- WHAT?!
I THOUGHT I WAS CHEERING YOU UP.

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,916
- Erza: THAT WAS HARDER
THAN YOU'D THINK.

135
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,750
ALL THAT TROUBLE
FOR ONE FISH.

136
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,750
- GO AHEAD AND EAT IT,
HAPPY.

137
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,791
- BUT THAT WOULDN'T BE FAIR
TO YOU GUYS, WOULD IT?

138
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,625
- IT'S WAY TOO SMALL
TO SPLIT UP.

139
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,541
IF WE HAD A BITE,
WE'D JUST WANT MORE.

140
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,166
- HURRY UP AND EAT IT
BEFORE WE CHANGE OUR MINDS.

141
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,625
- OKAY!
DON'T MIND IF I DO.

142
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:07,125
- ( all grumbling )
- ( chewing )

143
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:10,291
- WHO KNEW THAT ONE FISH
COULD BRING SO MUCH JOY?

144
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,791
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D 
BE JEALOUS OF A CAT.

145
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,625
- GROSS!

146
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,291
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

147
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:19,166
- I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT...
- ALL THAT FISHING...

148
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,625
- MADE ME HUNGRIER.

149
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,291
- ( all gasp )
- A VILLAGE.

150
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,583
- HOUSES.

151
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,000
- AND THAT MEANS
THERE MUST BE...

152
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,291
- FOOD!
- ( laughing )

153
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,583
- THERE'S NO ONE HERE.

154
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,666
- Lucy: IT DOES SEEM
AWFULLY QUIET, DOESN'T IT?

155
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,333
- Natsu: MAYBE THEY'RE TAKING 
AN AFTERNOON NAP OR SOMETHING.

156
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,250
HEY, ANYBODY HERE?!

157
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,250
- Happy: WE'RE STARVING
LIKE CRAZY OUT HERE.

158
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,583
SOMEBODY COOK US SOME DINNER!

159
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,750
- Lucy: WOW, HAPPY,
EVER HEAR OF THE WORD "PLEASE"?

160
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,833
- Gray: YOU REALLY THINK
THE WHOLE TOWN'S TAKING A NAP?

161
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,166
- Makarov:
WELL, IT'S EITHER THAT

162
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,083
OR THEY ALL GOT DRUNK
AND PASSED OUT.

163
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,416
- Lucy: I THINK THAT ONLY 
HAPPENS BACK AT THE GUILD.

164
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,000
- ( Makarov chuckles ) WE DO
LOVE OUR SPIRITS, DON'T WE?

165
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,666
- YOU GUYS CAN HANG OUT HERE
ALL DAY IF YOU WANT,

166
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,666
BUT I'M GONNA FIND
A KITCHEN TO RAID!

167
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,083
- SHAME ON YOU FOR EVEN THINKING
ABOUT ROBBING THIS PLACE, NATSU.

168
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,541
- YOU'RE JUST MAD
I THOUGHT OF IT FIRST.

169
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,208
( grunting )
HEY!

170
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,291
ANYONE HOME?

171
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,125
( grunts ) COME ON,
GIVE US SOMETHING TO EAT.

172
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,375
WE'RE DYING!

173
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,375
- LOOKS LIKE NOBODY'S HERE.

174
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:27,958
- WHO CARES? 
THERE'S FOOD.

175
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,375
( sniffs )

176
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,208
GOOD,
IT STILL SMELLS FRESH.

177
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,125
OPEN WIDE.
- NOT SO FAST.

178
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,541
- WHAT IS IT NOW?

179
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,250
- THERE'S SOMETHING
STRANGE HERE.

180
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,625
- SHE'S RIGHT.  WHO WOULD LEAVE
A TABLE FULL OF FOOD

181
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,125
JUST SITTING THERE LIKE THAT?

182
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,416
AND IF SOMEBODY COOKED THIS,

183
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,291
THEN WHERE THE HECK
ARE THEY NOW?

184
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,875
- HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

185
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,708
ANYWAY,
READY TO DIG IN, HAPPY?

186
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,291
- AYE. 
- AHH--

187
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,833
- NATSU.
- YES, MA'AM?

188
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:53,208
- WE NEED TO INVESTIGATE
THE VILLAGE FIRST.

189
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,125
WE'VE HELD OUT THIS LONG.
WE CAN HOLD ON A LITTLE--

190
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,791
- ( stomach growls )

191
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,583
- I THINK YOUR STOMACH
MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT PLANS.

192
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,875
- HMM.  YES.

193
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,625
BUT WHICH ONE
DO WE LISTEN TO?

194
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,500
- SEARCH THE AREA FOR MUSHROOMS
OR ANYTHING THAT LOOKS EDIBLE. 

195
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,750
AND DON'T EAT THE FOOD
IN THE VILLAGE, OKAY? 

196
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,333
WHILE YOU'RE ALL DOING THAT,
MASTER AND I

197
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,000
WILL TRY TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON.

198
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,916
- YEAH YEAH.
 I HEAR YOU.

199
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,333
LET'S GO, HAPPY.

200
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,083
- AYE.

201
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,875
- WAIT.  WHY MUSHROOMS?

202
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,208
( sighs )
- STUPID ERZA.

203
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,833
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET
FULL ON A BUNCH OF MUSHROOMS?

204
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:27,000
THAT FOOD BACK THERE
LOOKED REALLY GOOD TOO.

205
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,666
- HEY, MUSHROOMS.

206
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,250
- I TAKE IT BACK.
THESE LOOK TASTY!

207
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:34,333
- BUT WHY MUSHROOMS?
- IT'S SO OBVIOUS, LUCY.

208
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,833
- OH, YEAH?

209
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,250
- NATSU'S GONNA EAT
A POISONOUS MUSHROOM

210
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,041
THEN SOMETHING WEIRD
WILL HAPPEN TO HIM.

211
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,250
YOU KNOW THE CLICHE,
RIGHT?

212
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,958
- GIVE ME SOME CREDIT,
HAPPY.

213
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,958
YOU REALLY THINK I'D FALL FOR
SOME LAME GAG LIKE THAT?

214
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,250
NO WAY.

215
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,041
- ( sighs )

216
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,625
( gulps )

217
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,208
- MASTER?

218
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,666
- I WAS JUST INVESTIGATING,
ERZA.

219
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,208
- THESE MUSHROOMS
AREN'T VERY BIG, 

220
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,625
BUT IF I KEEP EATING
A TON OF THEM,

221
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,625
I'M BOUND TO GET FULL
SOONER OR LATER.

222
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,250
- AND HERE COMES THE SETUP.

223
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,750
- BETTER START PICKING FASTER.
- ( giggles )

224
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,166
- ( winces )

225
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,458
( choking )

226
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,000
- HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
NATSU?

227
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,833
- AND HERE'S THE GAG!

228
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:30,500
- THAT WAS SCARY.
- YOUR HEAD IS SCARY!

229
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,500
- I WAS HOPING THEY'D
TURN HIM PURPLE.

230
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,583
- OH, THAT'S WHAT
YOU WERE HOPING FOR?

231
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,458
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU 
ALL WORKED UP ABOUT?

232
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:40,000
- JUST TAKE A LOOK AT
ONE ANOTHER, OKAY?

233
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,750
- Both: WHY?

234
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,791
( both scream )

235
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,166
- ( laughs )
THERE'S A MUSHROOM ON YOUR HEAD.

236
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,666
- OH, YEAH?  WELL I BET YOURS
IS BIGGER THAN MINE.

237
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,083
- THIS COULD BE REALLY BAD.
WHO CARES HOW YOU LOOK?

238
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,333
GUYS...

239
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:54,625
- HEY, DROOPY EYES,

240
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,208
WHAT THE HECK
YOU LAUGHING ABOUT, HUH?

241
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:59,166
- ME?  WHAT ARE YOU
LAUGHING ABOUT, SHROOM HEAD?

242
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,666
- ( both grunting )
- YOU CAN FIGHT LATER.

243
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,625
WORRY ABOUT
THE MUSHROOMS FIRST!

244
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,125
- DID YOU FIND ANYBODY?

245
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,041
- NOPE.
NOT A SINGLE SOUL.

246
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,041
THE WHOLE PLACE
HAS BEEN DESERTED.

247
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,291
- BUT IF THAT'S THE CASE,
WHY DO ALL THE HOUSES

248
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,541
HAVE FRESHLY COOKED FOOD
ON THEIR TABLES?

249
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,041
HOLD ON.

250
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,750
WHAT IS THAT?

251
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,708
THIS ISN'T AN ORDINARY
CRACK IN THE GROUND.

252
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,000
IT MUST SERVE
SOME KIND OF PURPOSE.

253
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,791
- ( both panting )

254
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,875
- COME ON, GUYS.
TURN OFF THE STUPID, WOULD YOU?

255
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,125
- LUCY!
LOOKIE, I FOUND A BIG ONE.

256
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,916
- HOLY COW, THAT'S BIG!

257
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,125
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW 
WHAT THAT WOULD DO TO YOU.

258
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,708
- OH, MAN. WOW.
IT'S HUGE.

259
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,083
- YEAH, IT'S SO BIG
WE COULD EAT OFF IT FOR DAYS.

260
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,541
- HOW ABOUT WE HOLD OFF ON

261
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,916
EATING ANYMORE OF
THESE THINGS TODAY?

262
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,833
AFTER ALL THIS, YOU STILL
SHOVE ONE OF THOSE THINGS

263
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,333
IN YOUR MOUTH LIKE
IT'S NO BIG DEAL?

264
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,583
SPIT IT OUT RIGHT NOW!

265
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,166
- BUT IT'S YUMMY.

266
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,583
( gasps )

267
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,250
( grunts )

268
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,833
- ( screams )

269
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,583
- WELL, I GUESS THAT
HAPPENS TO EVERYONE 

270
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,083
WHO EATS THESE THINGS, HUH?

271
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,500
- I WONDER IF THE VILLAGERS
KNEW SOME WAY

272
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,250
AROUND THIS PROBLEM.
- WHO KNOWS?

273
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,083
MAYBE THEY LIKE
THE WAY IT LOOKS.

274
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,500
- YEAH.  MAYBE WE'LL BE IN STYLE
WHEN WE GET BACK TO TOWN.

275
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,916
- ( Natsu and Gray chuckle )

276
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,083
- IT'S NOT AS FUNNY
THIS TIME!

277
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,166
- WERE YOU TRYING
TO BE FUNNY?

278
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,916
UH, NATSU, IS IT JUST ME,
OR IS YOUR MUSHROOM GROWING?

279
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,500
- UHH...
- ( crying )

280
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,250
HOW COME HE ALWAYS 
GETS THE GOOD GAGS?

281
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,541
- THIS LOOKS JUST LIKE
THE OTHER SEAM.

282
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,208
- HMM.

283
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,166
- ( growling, murmuring )

284
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,000
- WHAT'S THAT SOUND?

285
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,208
- ( growling, murmuring )

286
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:53,791
- YOU HEAR THAT?

287
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,750
- WHAT IS IT?
( gasps )

288
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,708
- YAY!  THE MUSHROOMS
ARE GONE NOW.

289
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:02,125
- NOT QUITE. LOOKS LIKE YOURS
IS STILL GOING STRONG.

290
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,375
- AAH!

291
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,375
- ERZA!  GRAMPS!

292
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,958
- GET THIS THING
OFF OF MY HEAD. 

293
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,541
IT'S NOT FUNNY WHEN
THE JOKE'S ON ME.

294
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,916
- ( gasps )

295
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,916
- ERZA.

296
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,583
BE CAREFUL, HAPPY.
- AYE.

297
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,416
- ( gasps )

298
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,916
- WHOA.
WHAT'S WITH THIS PLACE?

299
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,833
- WHY IS EVERYTHING MOVING?

300
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,833
- IT LOOKS LIKE THE HOUSES
ARE HAVING A DANCE PARTY, HUH?

301
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,416
- I THINK YOU'RE MISSING
THE POINT HERE.

302
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,083
- IT CAN'T BE.

303
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,375
- IT'S TIME TO RUMBLE,
GRAMPS.

304
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,458
- NO, WAIT!
- WHAT?  WHY?

305
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,416
- WE NEED TO GET 
TO HIGHER GROUND.

306
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,333
THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO CHECK. 

307
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,000
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
LET'S GO.

308
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:45,250
TRY TO STAY CLOSE.

309
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,833
- ( roars )

310
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,625
- OH, MAN.

311
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,166
LOOKS LIKE WE GOT OUT
JUST IN TIME.

312
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,666
- NOW I SEE.
IT WAS A MAGIC CIRCLE.

313
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,291
- Makarov: THAT'S RIGHT. THOSE
LINES WE SAW IN THE VILLAGE

314
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,625
WERE CARVED INTO THE GROUND
TO FORM A MASSIVE MAGIC CIRCLE--

315
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,125
A CIRCLE USED FOR
A TYPE OF MAGIC

316
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,000
THAT WAS BANNED
MANY YEARS AGO.

317
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,000
A FORM OF SEALING MAGIC
THAT IS KNOWN AS "ALIVE."

318
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,875
- WHAT DOES IT DO? 
- SEE FOR YOURSELF.

319
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,791
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

320
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,208
IT HAS THE ABILITY
TO TURN INANIMATE OBJECTS

321
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,208
INTO LIVING CREATURES.

322
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,791
IT APPEARS THE VILLAGERS
CAST THE FORBIDDEN SPELL

323
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,625
ONLY TO END UP BEING EATEN
BY THE VERY MONSTERS

324
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,625
THEY BROUGHT TO LIFE.

325
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,166
- BUT WHY WOULD THEY USE 
MAGIC THAT'S BEEN BANNED?

326
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,000
- THIS VILLAGE WAS HOME
TO A DARK GUILD.

327
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,041
- NO WAY.

328
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,458
- WHILE INVESTIGATING,

329
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,750
I CAME ACROSS A COLLECTION
OF MAGIC TOOLS

330
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,500
TUCKED AWAY IN A SHED.

331
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,291
UPON CLOSER INSPECTION,

332
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,666
I REALIZED THEY WERE TOOLS
USED TO PRACTICE BLACK MAGIC.

333
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,083
- KNOWING HOW RECKLESS
DARK GUILDS CAN BE,

334
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,166
THEY PROBABLY THOUGHT UP
SOME CRAZY PLAN

335
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,000
AND WOUND UP GETTING
BURNED IN THE PROCESS.

336
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,625
BUT!
- ( all gasp )

337
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,416
- THERE'S ONE THING
WE SHOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR.

338
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,416
- OH, YEAH?
AND WHAT WOULD THAT BE?

339
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,250
- THE DARK GUILD'S MISCHIEF
BROUGHT THESE CREATURES TO LIFE.

340
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,083
AND MOST LIVING CREATURES
CAN BE TURNED INTO...

341
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,000
FOOD!
- ( screams )

342
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,583
- ( both chuckle )

343
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:11,083
- THAT SMIRK MAKES YOUR
NAKEDNESS CREEPIER, GRAY.

344
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,500
- HUH?
- ( stomachs growling )

345
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,708
- NOW TIME TO CHOW!

346
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,125
- YEAH!
I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU, NATSU.

347
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,541
- AT THIS POINT, 
I DON'T EVEN CARE

348
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,750
WHAT THEY TASTE LIKE.

349
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,875
- ( gasps ) EVEN ERZA'S
GONNA EAT THOSE THINGS?

350
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,791
- TIME TO GET
MY GRUB ON.

351
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,375
- WAIT!  YOU'RE CRAZY!

352
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,875
- SAVE SOME FOR ME,
YOU TWO.

353
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,458
- LISTEN UP, DINNER.

354
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,166
BEFORE I EAT YOU,
LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE SECRET.

355
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,791
I'M AN AWESOME CHEF,
AND I LOVE TO FLAMBE.

356
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:43,166
FIRE DRAGON IRON FIST!

357
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,291
- ( roars )
- SORRY, PAL.

358
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:49,750
BUT YOU'RE TOAST.

359
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,333
FIRE DRAGON IRON FIST!

360
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,125
NOW THAT HE'S COOKED...
( grunts )

361
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,041
WE'LL COVER HIM UP
AND LET HIM STEAM FOR A BIT.

362
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,250
- NORMALLY I'D SAVE DESSERT
FOR AFTER THE MEAL,

363
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,750
BUT NOT TODAY.

364
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,208
- ( roars )

365
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,083
- ICE MAKE FISHNET.

366
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,250
( grunts )

367
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,250
ANYONE WANT TO TRY 
A MONSTER POPSICLE?

368
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,666
- ( grunting )
EVEN IF YOU'RE A CHAIR,

369
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,333
YOU CAN'T TASTE WORSE
THAN A WINGFISH.

370
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,291
( grunting )

371
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,958
- HIYAH!
- AAH!

372
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,625
( whimpers )

373
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,333
( screams )

374
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,375
- ( hisses )

375
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:45,041
- ERZA!
- NOW STAND BACK.

376
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,666
IT'S TIME TO START COOKING.

377
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,208
- UH, COOKING WITH WHAT?

378
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,416
- REQUIP!

379
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,916
( grunting )

380
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,916
- ( gasps )

381
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,083
- THE TRICK IS TO CUT THEM INTO
PERFECTLY BITE-SIZED PIECES

382
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,833
THAT ARE FIVE CENTIMETERS LONG
AND FOUR MILLIMETERS WIDE.

383
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,666
- I THINK YOU GOT
A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY.

384
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,875
AND WHAT'S WITH THE WEIRD
OUTFIT YOU'RE WEARING?

385
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,750
- Natsu:
FIRE DRAGON IRON FIST!

386
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,416
- Gray:
ICE MAKE KNUCKLE!

387
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,208
- Happy: WHOA!
- ( Erza grunts )

388
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,250
- I WISH THEY WOULD HURRY.

389
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,166
I'M STARVING HERE.

390
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,750
- ( grunts )

391
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,625
TIME TO DIG IN.

392
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,250
- WHOA!

393
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,083
- WHAT THE HECK'S
GOING ON WITH HAPPY?

394
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,583
I DON'T CARE HOW HUNGRY HE IS.
HE CAN'T EAT A CHAIR.

395
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,416
- LUCY...

396
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,083
GO AHEAD.
YOU TRY IT FIRST.

397
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,666
- NOT A CHANCE.
- FINE.  I'LL DO IT.

398
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,750
- THAT'S COLD, ERZA!
YOU WERE TRYING TO USE ME

399
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:55,833
AS YOUR PERSONAL GUINEA PIG,

400
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,416
WEREN'T YOU?
- WHOA!

401
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,875
- UH, DO YOU THINK 
WE SHOULD HELP HIM?

402
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,625
- I'M SURE HE'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT.

403
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:02,875
HERE GOES.

404
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,291
- SO, HOW IS IT?

405
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,166
UH... ALL RIGHT, YOU WIN.

406
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,458
- WELL, IT AIN'T PRETTY.

407
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,416
HOPE IT TASTES
BETTER THAN IT LOOKS.

408
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,041
- ( all chewing )

409
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,291
- UHH...

410
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,041
- WHOA!

411
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,875
- All: GROSS!

412
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,875
- HUH? - WHAT WERE
YOU THINKING, GRAMPS?

413
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,458
THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN
EAT THIS NASTY STUFF.

414
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,500
- YOU TRYING TO KILL US,
YOU OLD GEEZER?

415
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,875
- TRUE.  I WOULD HARDLY
CALL THIS EDIBLE.

416
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,416
- IF YOU KNEW IT
WAS HARDLY EDIBLE,

417
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,500
WHY'D YOU FORCE ME TO EAT IT?!

418
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,000
- WHOA!

419
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,208
( groans )

420
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,500
( gasps )

421
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,583
- YOUR MUSHROOM
FINALLY FELL OFF.  LOOK.

422
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,416
- I DON'T CARE ABOUT
THE STUPID MUSHROOM.

423
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,208
I WANT TO KNOW WHY
YOU GUYS DIDN'T HELP ME!

424
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,750
HOW COULD YOU BE SO MEAN? 
I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS.

425
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,166
- WE ARE. - YOU WERE JUST
GOOFING OFF, RIGHT?

426
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,458
- ( gasps )

427
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,500
- WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO NOW?

428
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,916
I WOULD RATHER STARVE
THAN EAT MORE OF THAT STUFF.

429
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,916
- GUESS THAT'S WHAT WE GET
FOR TRYING TO COOK UP

430
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,166
A BUNCH OF MONSTERS.

431
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,500
- MAN, THIS SUCKS.

432
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,916
ALL THAT BARBEQUING
MADE ME EVEN

433
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,125
HUNGRIER THAN BEFORE.

434
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,750
- I SEE HOW IT IS.

435
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,666
EVEN AFTER ALL
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,

436
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,041
YOU'RE READY TO THROW ME OUT
LIKE YESTERDAY'S GARBAGE.

437
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,750
- ( growls ) 
- ( screams )

438
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,500
- LOOK OUT!
- NATSU!

439
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:23,250
- MAN, THESE THINGS ARE NASTY.
- IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE.

440
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,833
- I'M GONNA BLOW YOU TO PIECES.

441
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,958
FIRE DRAGON WING ATTACK!

442
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,916
- ICE WALL!
- ( grunts )

443
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,958
- I WANT TO HELP.
OPEN, GATE OF THE GOLDEN BULL.

444
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,333
TAURUS!

445
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,916
- MOO!

446
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,875
YOU'RE LOOKING SMOOTH
AS USUAL, MISS LUCY. 

447
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:54,375
- LESS PASSION, MORE BASHING.
- SHE LOVES MY MOO-VES.

448
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:55,666
( shouts )

449
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,833
- THEY JUST KEEP COMING.

450
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,250
- GREAT.
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW?

451
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,791
- THE MAGIC CIRCLE.
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

452
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,875
- OH, WOW.
IT'S SO PRETTY.

453
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,583
- YOU'RE MISSING
THE POINT AGAIN.

454
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,833
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT
MIXED UP LITTLE HEAD OF YOURS?

455
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,291
- THIS IS BAD.

456
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,916
RUN FOR IT!

457
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,041
- ( all shout )

458
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,208
- ( sighs )

459
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,041
I'M STARVING.

460
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,458
LIKE FOR REAL.

461
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,583
- I CAN'T WALK
ANOTHER STEP, YOU GUYS.

462
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,125
- WELL, GOOD THING
YOU HAVE WINGS,

463
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,791
UNLIKE THE REST OF US,
YOU SHOW OFF.

464
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,541
- I STILL DON'T GET
WHAT HAPPENED.

465
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:06,041
- UM, MASTER?
- YES?

466
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,958
- I'M NOT SATISFIED WITH
YOUR EXPLANATION, SIR.

467
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,375
- THAT SO?

468
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,875
- NOW SPILL IT.
WHAT WERE YOU TRYING TO PULL?

469
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,708
- WE WERE USING 
THE MAGIC CIRCLE

470
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,791
TO CAST FORBIDDEN SPELLS.

471
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,500
BUT THOSE MONSTERS APPEARED
AND TOOK OVER EVERYONE IN TOWN.

472
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,125
- SO THE MONSTERS WE FOUGHT,

473
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,875
YOU WERE ALL TRAPPED
INSIDE OF THEM?

474
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,750
- OH, YOU MADE ME
TASTE ONE OF THOSE THINGS.

475
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,416
- WHEN YOU STEPPED
INTO THE CIRCLE,

476
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,000
IT ACTIVATED THE SPELL

477
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,500
AND WE NO LONGER HAD
ANY CONTROL OF OURSELVES.

478
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,333
- WELL, YOU WON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT

479
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,500
THAT HAPPENING AGAIN.

480
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:39,750
- ( all gasp )

481
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,416
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT,
GRAMPS?

482
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,041
- THERE'S NO NEED TO SWEAT
THE DETAILS, MY BOY.

483
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,666
NOW AS FOR ALL
YOU VILLAGERS,

484
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,666
YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL 
THAT SOMEONE CAME ALONG

485
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,333
TO FREE YOU
FROM YOUR POSSESSION.

486
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,083
I ASSUME YOU'VE LEARNED
YOUR LESSON FROM THIS

487
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,500
GROSS MISUSE OF MAGIC.

488
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,250
AND AS LONG AS
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN,

489
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,166
I WON'T REPORT YOU
TO THE COUNCIL.

490
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,500
IS THAT A DEAL?
- YES, OF COURSE.

491
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,291
WE NEVER WANT TO
GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

492
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,833
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

493
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:02,916
- YOU HAVE OUR WORD.

494
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,500
- ( chuckles )

495
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,291
- WHEN WE FINALLY
DEFEATED THE MONSTERS,

496
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:12,125
IT SEEMED TO ACTIVATE SOME
KIND OF SELF-DESTRUCTION SPELL

497
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:15,458
WITHIN THE MAGIC CIRCLE.
THAT'S WHEN YOU CAME IN.

498
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:18,000
RUN FOR IT!
- ( all scream )

499
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,958
- IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE,
YOU SAVED US,

500
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,125
FREED THE DARK GUILD
FROM THE TAKEOVER SPELL

501
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,708
AND DESTROYED
THE MAGIC CIRCLE

502
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,833
BEFORE IT FLATTENED THE VILLAGE
AND EVERYONE IN IT.

503
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,291
HOW DID YOU DO IT?

504
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,708
- I'LL TELL YOU SOME DAY.

505
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:34,541
( sighs )
BUT WHAT MATTERS NOW IS...

506
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:36,666
- All: WE'RE STILL HUNGRY!

507
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:41,791
- ( stomachs growling )

508
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

509
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:13,833
- NO WAY!

510
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:15,583
NATSU AND ERZA
ARE GONNA FIGHT?

511
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:17,583
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING!
- 'FRAID NOT.

512
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:20,083
EVIDENTLY, NATSU'S FINALLY
READY TO GET REVENGE.

513
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,583
- BUT SHOULDN'T WE STOP THEM?

514
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:23,166
- NO.  GUILD MEMBERS
CHALLENGE EACH OTHER

515
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,333
TO FIGHTS ALL THE TIME.

516
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:25,833
SO WHO DO YOU
THINK WILL WIN?

517
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:27,583
- WELL, I'M THINKING
IT'LL BE ERZA,

518
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,666
BUT I HATE TO UNDERESTIMATE
NATSU'S POWER, YOU KNOW?

519
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,625
- ( Mirajane and Lucy speaking )

520
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,666
- Mirajane: HEY, WHY DON'T
YOU CHALLENGE ERZA

521
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,250
FOR THE TITLE OF "STRONGEST
FEMALE WIZARD IN FAIRY TAIL"?

522
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:41,625
- Lucy: YEAH, RIGHT!  MAYBE I
COULD BEAT HAPPY, THOUGH.
