1
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,791
- Natsu:
PREVIOUSLY ON "FAIRY TAIL."

2
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,375
- Happy:
WE CAN'T CATCH A BREAK!

3
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:22,708
FIRST JELLAL CAME BACK,

4
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:24,375
AND NOW NIRVANA
HAS BEEN UNSEALED.

5
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:25,791
- Angel: AW, TOO BAD.

6
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,750
- Lucy: WE TOOK DOWN
ONE OF THE ORACION SEIS,

7
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,250
BUT EVERY TIME THINGS
START LOOKING UP,

8
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,208
SOMETHING BAD'LL HAPPEN
AND TAKE US DOWN A PEG.

9
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:32,333
- Aquarius:
WITH THAT KIND OF LUCK,

10
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:33,666
YOU'LL NEVER GET A BOYFRIEND.

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,916
- Lucy: MY LOVE LIFE
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS!

12
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:40,958
- ( theme music playing )

13
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:45,041
- ( singing in Japanese )

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,166
- Lucy: SO WHENEVER
NIRVANA IS FULLY ACTIVATED,

15
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,750
EVERYBODY IN THE ALLIANCE
COULD SUDDENLY TURN EVIL?

16
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:17,458
- Happy: THAT'S NOT GOOD. WHAT
IF NATSU GOES TO THE DARK SIDE?

17
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:20,250
- EVIL NATSU'S READY FOR
A KNOCK-DOWN, DRAG OUT BRAWL!

18
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,500
I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE
OR WHAT GUILD YOU'RE FROM,

19
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,750
I'LL BURN YOUR BUTTS
TILL THE BREAK OF DAWN!

20
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,416
- ( sighs )

21
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,083
- I GUESS EVIL NATSU
WOULDN'T BE MUCH DIFFERENT

22
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,833
THAN NORMAL NATSU, HUH?

23
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,166
- I GOT THE FEELING HE WAS
A POWDER KEG WAITING TO EXPLODE.

24
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,833
- COME ON.
WE'VE GOT TO HURRY.

25
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:36,041
WE HAVE TO CATCH UP WITH THEM
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

26
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:39,916
WE'LL NEED HIM AND ERZA
TO STOP NIRVANA.

27
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:45,000
- ( Natsu groans )

28
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,125
COME OUT, JELLAL!
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU DOWN

29
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,833
FOR GOOD THIS TIME.
YOU HEAR ME?!

30
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,708
I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO MAKE SURE YOU NEVER

31
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,125
HURT ERZA AGAIN.

32
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,500
- ( Happy speaking )

33
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,125
- ( grunts )
I KNOW THAT SMELL.

34
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,000
I'M TELLING YOU,
THE NOSE ALWAYS KNOWS.

35
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,375
YO, GRAY!

36
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,541
STRANGE PLACE TO
TAKE A NAP, MAN.

37
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:12,791
WHAT HAPPENED TO 
THAT SPEEDY DUDE?

38
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:13,750
DID YOU BEAT HIM?

39
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,958
HUH?  WAKE UP!

40
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,666
( sighs )

41
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,666
( groans )

42
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,333
( grunts )
YOU'RE HEAVY.

43
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,583
COME ON, HELP ME OUT HERE.
I'M IN A HURRY.

44
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,166
WAKE UP, DUDE.

45
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,916
( grunts )

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,833
( sighs )
OH?

47
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,916
- ( chuckles )

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,750
- UH, YOU OKAY?

49
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:41,625
WHOA!

50
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,750
( gasps )

51
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,666
HOW'D YOU HIDE
A RAFT DOWN THERE?

52
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,583
( murmurs )

53
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:53,583
- TALK ABOUT PATHETIC.

54
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,708
POOR NATSU. YOUR MOTION SICKNESS
WILL BE THE DEATH OF YOU.

55
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,166
- ( groans )

56
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,583
- GOTTA SAY, I NEVER THOUGHT

57
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,708
YOU'D BE SUCH A PUSHOVER.

58
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,541
- ( grunts )
WHAT GIVES? 

59
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,958
- I'M TIRED OF HAVING TO
DEAL WITH A LOSER LIKE YOU.

60
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,541
LET'S FACE IT.
FIRE AND ICE JUST DON'T MIX.

61
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,541
I'VE HAD ENOUGH. 
I THINK IT'S TIME

62
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:12,833
I END OUR PARTNERSHIP.

63
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:15,958
THIS IS GOOD-BYE, PAL.

64
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,666
- ( groans )
- ( chuckles )

65
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,333
ALL RIGHT, COME OUT!

66
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,375
- MIND TELLING ME
WHAT THE HECK YOU'RE DOING?

67
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,041
- LOOKS OBVIOUS TO ME.

68
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,666
- IT WOULD APPEAR
WE'VE FOILED HIS FOAL PLAY.

69
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,291
- NICE SHOT, LUCY.
( groans )

70
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,375
- I KNOW YOU'RE MOTION SICK,
BUT WATCHING YOU NEARLY PUKE

71
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,250
AFTER SAYING MY NAME
IS KILLING MY SELF-ESTEEM.

72
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,583
- SHALL I SHOOT HIM?

73
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,375
- WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU, GRAY?

74
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,291
YOU'RE TAKING THIS
WAY TOO FAR.

75
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:48,250
UNLESS HE STOLE YOUR FISH, THEN
YOU'D BE COMPLETELY JUSTIFIED. 

76
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,833
- DON'T GIVE HIM AN OUT,
STUPID CAT.

77
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,583
- COULD YOU GUYS BE
ANY MORE ANNOYING? 

78
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,166
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.
I'LL DEAL WITH THE REST OF YOU

79
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,416
ONCE I'M DONE WITH HIM.
SO KEEP YOUR LITTLE MOUTHS SHUT

80
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,166
AND WAIT YOUR TURN.
- WHAT?!

81
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,166
- IS THIS NIRVANA?

82
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,333
HAS THAT THING ALREADY SWITCHED
ONE OF US TO THE DARK SIDE?

83
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,875
- Natsu: WHY WON'T IT STOP?
- ( gasps )

84
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:10,000
- IT'S WOBBLING. IT'S SWAYING.
LET ME OFF.

85
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,291
- HOW ARE YOU STILL STICK 
WHEN IT'S NOT EVEN MOVING?

86
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,500
- HANG ON, BUDDY.
I'M COMING FOR YOU!

87
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,500
AAH!

88
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,083
- HOW COULD YOU?

89
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,750
- THAT'S NO WAY TO TREAT
ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS.

90
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,666
- HAPPY MAY BE ABLE TO FLY,

91
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,666
BUT HE CAN ONLY
CARRY ONE PERSON.

92
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,750
HE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY COMBAT SKILLS.

93
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,041
THAT'S ALL THE INFO
GRAY HAS ON THE PEST.

94
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,125
- YOU'RE NOT MAKING
ANY SENSE AT ALL.

95
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,541
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?

96
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,041
- MY GUESS IS HE'S
THE FIRST VICTIM

97
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,375
OF NIRVANA'S MAGIC.

98
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,791
HE SWITCHED TO
THE DARK SIDE.

99
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,125
- HE'S GOT PLENTY OF
INFO ON LUCY.

100
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:42,125
A NEWCOMER TO FAIRY TAIL,
DEFINITELY EASY ON THE EYES.

101
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,125
HE LIKES THE WHOLE PACKAGE.

102
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,583
- UH, SHOULD I BE HEARING THIS?

103
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,708
- SHE CAN BE AS
HOTHEADED AS ERZA,

104
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,708
BUT SHE HIDES HER PURE HEART.

105
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,541
OH, SHE'S A CELESTIAL WIZARD?

106
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,666
THAT SO?

107
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,583
- ( gasps )

108
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,500
- THAT'S NOT GRAY.

109
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,291
I CAN TELL YOU'RE AN IMPOSTER.

110
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,500
DROP THE ACT.
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

111
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,875
- ACCESSING INFORMATION
ON HIBIKI.

112
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,791
A MEMBER OF
THE BLUE PEGASUS GUILD,

113
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,125
LADIES' MAN.

114
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,791
NO FURTHER DETAILS
AVAILABLE.

115
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:15,083
WELL, THAT WASN'T HELPFUL.

116
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,500
- WE'RE WASTING OUR TIME
DEALING WITH THIS NONSENSE.

117
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,500
I WISH THEY'D JUST
INCAPACITATE THE FOOL

118
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,416
SO WE COULD GET TO NIRVANA.
- Lucy: THAT'S IT.

119
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,333
ONLY THOSE WHOSE EMOTIONS
WAVER BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL

120
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,500
SWITCH TO THE OTHER SIDE.

121
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,500
SO THAT CAN'T BE GRAY, BECAUSE
HE'S AS COOL AS THEY COME.

122
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,291
WHO THE HECK ARE YOU?

123
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,833
- ( chuckles )

124
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,208
- ( Lucy gasps )
ME?!

125
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,083
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME.

126
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,583
YOU DON'T HONESTLY THINK
YOU'RE FOOLING US, DO YOU?

127
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,000
WE KNOW YOU'RE NOT
THE REAL LUCY,

128
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,750
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL
SHOW US YOUR TRUE FORM.

129
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,833
- OH, I'LL SHOW YOU.
AND I THINK YOU'LL FIND

130
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,041
I'M EVERY BIT AS REAL
AS THAT BIMBO.

131
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:57,333
( chuckles )
- ( yelps )

132
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,375
AAH!
- ( laughing )

133
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,625
- PATHETIC.

134
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,708
- SO WOBBLY.

135
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,458
- YEP, THEY'RE REAL.

136
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,541
- ( both grunting )
- I HATE BOTH OF YOU!

137
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,041
- THINK ABOUT
WHAT KIND OF EXAMPLE

138
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,875
YOU'RE SETTING FOR WENDY,
YOU FLOOZY.

139
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,375
- BUT THAT'S NOT ME.
I MEAN, IT IS, BUT IT ISN'T.

140
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:16,541
WHY DOES THIS KIND OF STUFF
ALWAYS HAPPEN TO ME ANYWAY?

141
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,625
- SORRY, BUT IT'S ONLY GONNA
GET WORSE FROM HERE ON OUT. 

142
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:23,208
YOU SEE, NOW I KNOW EXACTLY
WHICH KEYS YOU'RE CARRYING.

143
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,208
- ( gasps )
- YOU HAD AN AUDIENCE

144
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,041
WITH THE CELESTIAL
SPIRIT KING?

145
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,625
HOW DID A NOOB LIKE YOU
EVER GET THE HONOR?

146
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,833
WHATEVER. DOESN'T MATTER.
LISTEN UP, SAGITTARIUS,

147
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,666
TAKE THEM OUT.

148
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,541
- AAH!
- DID I DO THAT?

149
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,291
- ( groans )

150
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,000
- ARE YOU CRAZY?!

151
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,250
- BUT I THOUGHT YOU ONLY
TOOK ORDERS FROM LUCY?

152
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,375
- I'M SO SORRY, MY LADY.

153
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:46,833
BUT 'TIS NOT I.

154
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,625
MY BODY IS OUT OF CONTROL.

155
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,250
- HANG IN THERE.
YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

156
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,583
TELL ME, HOW ARE YOU
CONTROLLING SAGITTARIUS?

157
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,500
- I'M AN EXACT COPY OF YOU,
WHICH MEANS

158
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:59,125
YOUR SPIRITS ARE FORCED
TO FOLLOW MY ORDERS.

159
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,166
- FORGIVE ME, LADY LUCY,
AND SIR HIBIKI.

160
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,333
I'M FIGHTING WITH
ALL MY STRENGTH, 

161
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,250
BUT I CANNOT HOLD IT.

162
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,416
- CARLA, GRAB WENDY AND
GET HER OUT OF HERE

163
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,458
AS FAST AS YOU CAN.
GET HER TO SAFETY. 

164
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,458
- I WAS JUST WAITING
FOR YOU TO SAY THAT.

165
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,458
- I'M GONNA CLOSE YOUR GATE
SO YOU CAN TAKE A BREAK.

166
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,291
DON'T WORRY.
I KNOW IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

167
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,333
- I REGRET THAT I CANNOT
AID YOU FURTHER, LADY LUCY.

168
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:24,125
- IT'S ABOUT TIME.

169
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,416
NOW, OPEN GATE OF THE ARCHER.

170
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,375
COME BACK, SAGITTARIUS.

171
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,291
- I'M HAPPY TO JUMP BACK
INTO THE FRAY.

172
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,041
- ( gasps )
- HOW DID YOU--

173
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,875
THIS CANNOT BE.  BY WHAT MEANS
HAVE YOU SUMMONED ME?

174
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,291
- DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF
AND YOU'LL LIVE LONGER.

175
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,041
ALL THAT MATTERS IS
I SUMMONED YOU,

176
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,875
SO YOU HAVE TO DO
WHATEVER I ASK.

177
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,125
- I SHALL NOT
BETRAY MY CHARGE,

178
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,458
NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY.

179
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,208
- WHAT DO YOU SAY 
WE GIVE IT A SHOT?

180
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,541
PUT IT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF THAT WHITE CAT'S BACK. 

181
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,083
- Sagittarius:
I CANNOT DO THAT.

182
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,666
- WHAT'S THAT?

183
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,416
ARE YOU DISOBEYING AN ORDER
FROM YOUR MASTER?

184
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,500
- YOU MAY SHARE HER APPEARANCE
AND ABILITIES,

185
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,500
BUT COMPARING YOURSELF
TO LADY LUCY IS A TRAVESTY

186
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,916
UPON HER NAME.

187
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,333
SO I SHALL NOT OBEY YOU.

188
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,875
- KEEP FIGHTING HER.

189
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,083
- PLEASE, SEND ME BACK,
MY LADY.

190
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,791
- OKAY THEN.

191
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,750
CLOSING GATE OF THE ARCHER.

192
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,708
( gasps )

193
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,750
- HANG ON, DID YOU FORGET
I SUMMONED HORSE FACE?

194
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,500
ONLY THE WIZARD WHO
CALLS A SPIRIT

195
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,500
CAN FORCE IT BACK.
- NO.

196
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,166
- SHOOT THAT CAT
OUT OF THE SKY. 

197
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,458
I DON'T HAVE ALL DAY.

198
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,500
- THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH.
NIRVANA'S BEEN FOUND, 

199
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,333
SO THE RUNT'S USELESS.

200
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,333
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE QUIT WASTING
PRECIOUS ENERGY, MY PETS?

201
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,333
- AS YOU WISH.

202
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,708
- SAGITTARIUS!
- MY APOLOGIES.

203
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:45,833
I SHALL ENDEAVOR TO BE MUCH
STRONGER WHEN NEXT WE MEET.

204
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,291
- ( chuckles )

205
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,833
- Gemi and Mini: PIRI PIRI!

206
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,708
- HELLO, LUCY, DARLING.

207
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,333
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO
GAZE UPON AN ANGEL?

208
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,541
- I'M PRETTY SURE
I'D RATHER BE BLIND, LADY.

209
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:59,125
- WELL, I'M SURE
THAT CAN BE ARRANGED.

210
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,125
HAVE MY PETS BEEN
ENTERTAINING YOU?

211
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,125
I'M QUITE FOND OF
THEIR LITTLE TRICK.

212
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,541
- I'M GEMI.
- AND I'M MINI.

213
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,291
- Both: PIRI PIRI!
- I BELIEVE YOU KNOW THEM

214
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:10,125
AS THE GEMINI TWINS.
CELESTIAL SPIRITS

215
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,791
MAKE THE BEST TOYS.

216
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:15,375
- YOU'RE A CELESTIAL WIZARD?
THAT MAKES ME SICK.

217
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,291
I'M CONFIDENT THAT I WON'T
FALL TO THE DARK SIDE.

218
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,541
AND I DOUBT MISS
PSYCHO SWAN IS GONNA BE

219
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,666
FIGHTING FOR TRUTH
AND JUSTICE ANYTIME SOON.

220
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,625
SO AT LEAST I DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY

221
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,583
ABOUT NIRVANA'S
TRICKERY RIGHT NOW.

222
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,291
HIBIKI'S IN BAD SHAPE,

223
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,666
AND NATSU'S DOWN
FOR THE COUNT TOO.

224
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,125
IT'S ALL IN MY HANDS.

225
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,000
LUCKILY,
WE'RE NEXT TO A RIVER.

226
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:39,250
AND WHEREVER THERE'S WATER,
THERE'S AQUARIUS.

227
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,416
- YOUR GATE KEYS WOULD MAKE A
LOVELY ADDITION

228
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,833
TO MY COLLECTION.
SO HAND THEM OVER NOW,

229
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,083
OR YOU'LL BE WEARING
LOTS OF RED.

230
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,500
- NEVER TO THE LIKES OF YOU!

231
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,083
HERE WE GO.
OPEN, GATE OF THE WATER BEARER!

232
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,208
- GET LOST, YOU TWO.

233
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:54,791
- AQUARIUS!
- ( chuckles )

234
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,750
- WIPE HER OUT.  I DON'T CARE
IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE ME WITH HER.

235
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,916
- THAT'S JUST WHAT
I WAS PLANNING TO DO.

236
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,833
- WHAT DID I EVER
DO TO YOU?

237
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:05,250
- EVERY LAST MORON HERE
IS GONNA DROWN!

238
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:08,333
- NOW OPEN,
GATE OF THE SCORPION.

239
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,583
- WHAT DID SHE SAY?
THIS COULD BE BAD. 

240
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,541
- SCORPIO!

241
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,791
- ( chuckles )

242
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,875
I WAS BORN TO BE WICKED!

243
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,083
- HONEY BUNCHES OF HUNK!
- HUNK?!

244
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,875
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW? IT'S
MY MERMAID OF DELIGHT, AQUARIUS.

245
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,625
BACK THAT WICKED
TAIL UP FOR ME. 

246
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,625
- OH, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW I'VE
MISSED YOU, LOVE MUFFIN.

247
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,958
- NO WAY. PLEASE DON'T
TELL ME THAT SCORPIO--

248
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,541
- YEP. MY BOYFRIEND.

249
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,291
- HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOU.

250
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,375
FINALLY GETTING TO MEET
MY BLUE BOMBSHELL'S WIZARD

251
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,541
IS WICKED.

252
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,958
- OH!  SO WHAT EXACTLY
HAS SHE TOLD YOU?

253
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,083
- LOOK HERE, BLONDIE,
IF YOU WANT TO KEEP BREATHING,

254
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,250
LISTEN CLOSELY.
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT

255
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,250
EMBARRASSING ME
IN FRONT OF MY SCORPIO,

256
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,333
OR YOU'RE GONNA SUFFER.
CLEAR?

257
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:58,083
- AS CRYSTAL.
SHE'S GONNA KILL ME ONE DAY.

258
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,541
- SOUNDS WICKED AWESOME.

259
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,583
I'M TAKING MY LADY OUT FOR A
NIGHT ON THE TOWN, ANGEL.

260
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:05,083
YOU GOT THIS, RIGHT?
NO REST FOR THE WICKED.

261
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,833
- HAVE FUN!
- ( gasps )

262
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,833
WAIT, YOU CAN'T JUST
LEAVE ME HERE!

263
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:12,541
DON'T GO!  NO!

264
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,166
- HOW HAVE YOU
SURVIVED THIS LONG

265
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,375
WITHOUT KNOWING HOW
THE CELESTIAL SPIRITS RELATE?

266
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:19,333
- ( grunts ) - A NOVICE
LIKE YOU CAN'T BEAT ME.

267
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,541
- HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO BEAT HER
WITHOUT MY STRONGEST

268
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,125
CELESTIAL SPIRIT IN PLAY?

269
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,791
WAIT.

270
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,666
SHE'S NOT THE ONLY POWERHOUSE
I CAN CALL.

271
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,416
OPEN, GATE OF THE LION!

272
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,166
- YOUR HANDSOME
PRINCE HAS ARRIVED.

273
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,500
- LEO?

274
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:43,875
- WE HAVE TO BEAT THIS CHICK,

275
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,541
OR THE GUILD'S IN DANGER.

276
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,875
- SOUNDS EASY ENOUGH.
- ( laughs )

277
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,041
YOU'RE A SLOW LEARNER,
AREN'T YOU?

278
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,541
LET ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER
LESSON IN COMPATIBILITIES.

279
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,166
OPEN, GATE OF THE RAM.

280
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,166
- ( both gasp )

281
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,958
- ARIES.

282
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,208
- I HOPE YOU CAN
FORGIVE ME, LEO.

283
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,541
- IT'S YOU.

284
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,375
- NO WAY.
IT CAN'T BE.

285
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,166
- HOW'D SHE GET
HER HANDS ON ARIES?

286
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,750
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
ONE OF KAREN'S SPIRITS.

287
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:14,666
I CAN'T ASK LOKE TO FIGHT
A DEAR FRIEND OF HIS.

288
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,666
- ( groans )

289
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,583
- ARIES...

290
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,625
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

291
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,916
- HOW DID YOU END UP
WITH ONE OF KAREN'S SPIRITS?

292
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,250
- SIMPLE. I'M THE ONE WHO
PUT HER SIX FEET UNDER.

293
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,916
- ( gasps )

294
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,166
- AND AS THEY SAY,
TO THE VICTOR GO THE SPOILS.

295
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,500
- PLEASE, JUST STOP.

296
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,000
- SHE WASN'T MUCH
OF AN OPPONENT.

297
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,916
SHE TRIED TO OPEN
TWO GATES AT ONCE

298
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,166
WHEN SHE BARELY HAD 
THE ENERGY TO STAND.

299
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,208
THE FOOL PRACTICALLY HANDED
HER KEYS OVER TO ME.

300
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,791
IT WORKED OUT WELL,
BUT I WISH SHE WOULD HAVE

301
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,375
PUT UP MORE OF A FIGHT.

302
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,375
SO MANY CELESTIAL WIZARDS
HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES

303
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,166
AND SPIRITS TO ME,
I'VE STOPPED COUNTING.

304
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,791
- YOU'RE JUST GOING TO BE 
ANOTHER STONE ON THE TRAIL

305
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,625
OF MISERY I'VE PAVED.

306
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,375
- Hibiki: KAREN.

307
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,541
HOW COULD SHE FALL...

308
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,375
TO SOMEONE LIKE THIS?

309
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,625
( crying )

310
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,541
THIS WOMAN...

311
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,708
ANGEL...

312
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,625
TOOK MY LOVE AWAY FROM ME.

313
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:22,041
SHE WAS MURDERED BY
ONE OF HER OWN.

314
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,291
A CELESTIAL WIZARD.

315
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,208
I HATE THEM ALL!

316
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,208
THEY WILL PAY!

317
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,375
( gasps )

318
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,916
DON'T!

319
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,416
THIS IS EXACTLY
THE KIND OF THINKING

320
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,333
THAT ALLOWS NIRVANA
TO CHANGE PEOPLE.

321
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,833
I CAN'T GIVE IN TO HATRED.

322
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,833
I'VE GOT TO TRY NOT
TO THINK ABOUT IT. 

323
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,416
- YOU FINALLY GET TO 
SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN,

324
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,875
AND YOU HAVE TO FIGHT?

325
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,000
NO.  I WON'T FORCE YOU
TO GO THROUGH WITH IT.

326
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,708
- I DON'T NEED YOU TO
PROTECT ME, LUCY.

327
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,083
IT'S TRUE ARIES AND I
WERE ONCE FRIENDS,

328
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,833
BUT NOW WE HAVE
NEW CELESTIAL CONTRACTS.

329
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,958
AND WE'LL FIGHT FOR THE
WIZARDS WE'VE MADE THEM WITH.

330
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,750
- THAT'S RIGHT.
I MAY OWE MY LIFE TO YOU, LEO,

331
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,250
BUT IN THIS INSTANCE,
YOU ARE MY ENEMY.

332
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,583
- Leo and Aries:
FOR A CELESTIAL SPIRIT...

333
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,333
IT'S A MATTER OF PRIDE!

334
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,375
- THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

335
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,791
- ( grunts )

336
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,291
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
THEY'RE ACTUALLY FIGHTING.

337
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,208
WELL, IT MAY NOT BE EXPECTED,

338
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,375
BUT WHO AM I TO
STOP GOOD THEATRE?

339
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,375
- STOP IT.

340
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,208
- ( gasps )

341
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,500
- FRIENDS SHOULDN'T FIGHT.

342
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,041
PLEASE STOP.
I'M BEGGING YOU.

343
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,416
- WOOL BOMB!

344
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,458
( grunts )

345
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,375
- ( grunting )

346
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:47,125
- THIS DIDN'T WORK OUT
QUITE THE WAY I EXPECTED IT TO.

347
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,458
I NEVER THOUGHT
SHE'D BE FIGHTING

348
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,291
A COMBAT ORIENTED SPIRIT.

349
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,041
BUT AM I GONNA WORRY?

350
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:55,041
NO.  OPEN, GATE OF THE CHISEL.

351
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,875
CAELUM.

352
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,708
I'VE GOT SOME TARGETS FOR
YOU. ARE YOU EXCITED?

353
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,500
AS SOON AS ARIES IS ABLE
TO STOP LEO IN HIS TRACKS,

354
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:07,791
DO WHAT YOU DO BEST.

355
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,625
- ( gasps )

356
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:22,916
- ( laughs )

357
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,500
NOW THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT.

358
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,291
- NO, LEO!
- ARIES!

359
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:32,083
SORRY, LUCY. 
I FAILED YOU.

360
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,833
- YOUR WIZARD 
CARES FOR YOU.

361
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,000
WISH I WERE SO LUCKY.

362
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,833
UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN.

363
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:47,291
- SEE?  THAT'S HOW YOU PULL OFF
MULTIPLE GATES, DARLING.

364
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,416
LOOKS LIKE I'VE PUT YOUR
MOST POWERFUL SPIRIT

365
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,916
OUT OF COMMISSION FOR AWHILE.

366
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,125
- YOU DISGUST ME.

367
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,208
- ARE YOU CRYING?
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY ACTUALLY DIE.

368
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,875
SO WHY BOTHER
WASTING YOUR TEARS?

369
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,625
- BUT THEY DO FEEL PAIN.

370
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,416
THEY'RE NOT MINDLESS DOLLS
FOR YOU TO PLAY WITH.

371
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,125
A REAL CELESTIAL WIZARD
WOULD RESPECT THEIR SPIRITS.

372
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,250
- OH.
( chuckles )

373
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,208
- OPEN, GATE OF THE GOLDEN BULL,
TAURUS!

374
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,333
- MOO!

375
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,625
- GEMINI.

376
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,666
- MAKING LUCY CRY WAS
THE WORST MOO-VE OF YOUR LIFE.

377
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,208
GET READY FOR
A RODEO OF PAIN.  MOO?

378
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,166
- COME GET SOME,
YOU KOBE BEEF STUD.

379
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,208
- I'M IN THE MOOD
FOR RUMP ROAST!

380
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,166
- AND HE'S OUT OF HERE!

381
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,250
- SMOOCHES!

382
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,750
- NO, TAURUS!
( gasps )

383
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,000
WHAT?

384
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,583
ALREADY?

385
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,583
- I'M AFRAID YOU'RE
SIMPLY OUTGUNNED.

386
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,666
I HAVE MUCH MORE POWER
THAN A MERE NOVICE LIKE YOU.

387
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,041
- NO WAY.

388
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,208
( grunts )

389
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,416
- ( chuckles )
POOR THING.

390
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,000
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T BEAT
YOURSELF UP OVER THE MATTER.

391
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,958
( laughing )

392
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,875
- ( grunts )
- ( laughs )

393
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,500
I THINK SHE NEEDS MORE PAIN.

394
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:06,875
- ( groans )

395
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,458
MORE PAIN.

396
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,958
( chuckles )

397
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:15,791
- ( whimpers )

398
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,375
- HEY, QUIT STARING.
IT ANNOYS ME.

399
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,916
- RELEASE ARIES
FROM HER CONTRACT.

400
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,208
- YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?

401
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,041
- KAREN TORMENTED HER.

402
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,625
BROKE HER ON ALMOST
A DAILY BASIS.

403
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,208
SHE DESERVES TO BE HAPPY,

404
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,666
BUT THAT WON'T HAPPEN
UNTIL SHE'S FREE.

405
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,208
- ( gasps )

406
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,000
- ( grunts )

407
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,416
- WHAT DO WE SAY WHEN
WE WANT SOMETHING FROM SOMEONE,

408
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,583
LUCY, MY DEAR?

409
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,958
WELL, I'M WAITING.

410
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,083
- PLEASE.

411
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,083
LET HER GO.

412
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,791
I BEG YOU.

413
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,666
SHE SHOULD BE WITH LOKE.

414
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,083
AND WE CAN MAKE
THAT HAPPEN FOR THEM.

415
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,916
DO WHAT YOU WANT WITH ME.

416
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,916
JUST RELEASE ARIES SO SHE CAN
FIND HER OWN HAPPINESS.

417
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,750
- ( chuckles )

418
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,083
FOR FREE?

419
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:14,416
- YOU CAN HAVE ANYTHING.
EXCEPT FOR MY SPIRITS.

420
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,166
YOU CAN EVEN TAKE MY LIFE.

421
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,791
- MY, HOW GENEROUS.

422
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,750
GEMINI, COLLECT FOR ME.

423
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,375
- ( crying )

424
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,375
- HURRY UP!

425
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,791
- HUH?  I HEAR A STRANGE VOICE.

426
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,125
IT'S IN MY HEAD.

427
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:40,125
- Young Lucy: I LOVE CELESTIAL
SPIRITS SO MUCH, MAMA.

428
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,125
CAN YOU TEACH ME
HOW TO SUMMON THEM?

429
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,958
CELESTIAL SPIRITS
ARE MY FRIENDS, NOT MY SHIELD!

430
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,083
I CAN'T JUST SIT HERE
WHILE MY FRIEND DISAPPEARS

431
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,041
RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES!

432
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:54,000
- NO, I CAN'T.

433
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,125
SHE LOVES US.

434
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,708
SHE'S WILLING TO GIVE UP
HER LIFE FOR US.

435
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,291
WE ENVY HER SPIRITS.

436
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,583
- ( gasps )

437
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,291
- GEMINI.

438
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,791
- BE GONE!

439
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
OH, YOU'LL SUFFER FOR THAT.

440
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:17,333
- ( gasps )

441
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:23,333
( gasps )

442
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,833
HIBIKI?

443
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,000
- NO WAY!
YOUR FRIEND SWITCHED SIDES

444
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,666
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIGHT?
( laughs )

445
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,125
- JUST RELAX.

446
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,166
THIS MIGHT FEEL FUNNY.

447
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,791
I'M GONNA USE ARCHIVE
TO TEACH YOU HYPER MAGIC.

448
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,583
- ( gasps )
- THIS IS A ONE-SHOT DEAL,

449
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:42,541
SO MAKE IT COUNT!

450
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,458
- ( gasps )

451
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,833
- AAH!

452
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,625
ALL THESE SPELLS IN MY HEAD...

453
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,208
AT ONCE... WAIT!

454
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,125
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN TAKE IT!

455
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,625
- TALK ABOUT A CLOSE ONE.

456
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,875
I WAS FLIRTING AT THE EDGE OF
LIGHT AND DARK THERE FOR A BIT.

457
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:07,208
BUT THEN THE LOVE
YOU FEEL FOR CELESTIAL SPIRITS

458
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:10,208
DROVE EVERY HINT 
OF DARKNESS AWAY.

459
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:13,666
IF ANYONE CAN MAKE THIS WORK,
IT'S YOU.

460
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,625
- CAELUM, FINISH THEM!

461
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,583
- ( dings )

462
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,458
- I HAVE FAITH IN YOU, LUCY.

463
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,583
- ( dings )

464
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,958
- ( gasps )

465
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:36,083
- OH, STARS FAR AND WIDE
THAT EMBODY THE HEAVENS,

466
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:40,083
BY THY RADIANCE,
REVEAL THY FORM TO ME.

467
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,083
I IMPLORE YOU,
OH TETRABIBLOS,

468
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,666
RULER OF THE STARS,

469
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,708
