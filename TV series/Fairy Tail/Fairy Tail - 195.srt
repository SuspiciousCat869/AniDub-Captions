00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:16,166
[MOTHER GLARE roaring]

162
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,375
[NATSU grunting]

163
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:26,958
[NATSU gasps]

164
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,083
[FUTURE ROGUE grunts]

165
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,916
[NATSU] Hey are you
feelin' okay after that?

166
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,833
[ATLAS FLAME]
My body is pure flame.

167
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,083
Breath attacks can't hurt me!

168
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,625
[FUTURE ROGUE grunts]

169
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,458
[MOTHER GLARE]
And no flame could ever

170
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,416
burn my adamantine body.

171
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,333
[ATLAS FLAME] You've never
felt my Hellfire, have you?

172
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,125
[ATLAS FLAME] It burns
as intensely as flames

173
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,958
from the pits of hell.

174
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,583
[ATLAS FLAME] And this young
man whom I call my friend

175
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,416
has consumed it.

176
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,083
He has it raging
inside his belly.

177
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:10,625
[NATSU yelling]

178
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,458
[FUTURE ROGUE]
He ate the fire of Atlas Flame?

179
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:14,916
How?

180
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,125
[NATSU yelling]

181
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:23,583
[MOTHER GLARE roaring]

182
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,500
[MALE SOLDIER 195A]
Your Majesty! Do you see that?

183
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,791
[MALE SOLDIER 195B] It looks
like a couple of the dragons

184
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,166
are starting
to fight each other!

185
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,666
[MALE SOLDIER 195C]
Yes. Those two are definitely

186
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,625
going at it up there.

187
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,833
My beautiful city
of flowers has been

188
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,791
stained red with blood.

189
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,708
Trampled over by total chaos.

190
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:51,791
[TOMA] A frenzy of people,
dragons, and magic.

191
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:59,500
People fighting people.
Dragon fighting dragon.

192
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:03,041
People struggling
against dragons.

193
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,791
It's just as the
legends spoke of.

194
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,708
This is the
Dragon King Festival.

195
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,166
[MALE SOLDIER 195A]
Your highness!

196
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,375
[MALE SOLDIER 195B]
Something wrong, your majesty?

197
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,916
[MALE SOLDIER 195D]
Do you need assistance?

198
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,458
No. This is a catastrophe.
It's too late.

199
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:26,458
The world as we once knew it
has been irrevocably changed.

200
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:30,000
[RUFUS]
I know what to do. Memory Make.

201
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,458
Sword of Frozen Black Lightning!

202
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,541
Shrine of the Stormy Wind Fang!

203
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,708
[RUFUS panting]

204
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,583
Is there no end to
these foul creatures?

205
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,541
Their sheer number.
Their raw power.

206
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,208
Like nothing in my memory.

207
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,125
Here comes my Ice Bringer!

208
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,000
[GRAY grunts]

209
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,666
Magnificent.

210
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,708
[GRAY] Why are you
just standing there?

211
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,125
I used that exact same
technique to beat you,

212
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,333
don't you remember it?

213
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:25,833
[RUFUS] Then I suppose
you wouldn't mind me

214
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,916
incorporating it
into my repertoire.

215
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,916
[RUFUS]
Hm.

216
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,125
[GRAY]
Hm.

217
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,958
We can take on
these things, pal!

218
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,750
[DROY] Yeah! We may
not have Levy,

219
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,958
but we still gotta
represent Team Shadow Gear!

220
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,125
Now! Falcon Soar!

221
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,458
Have a taste of
my Knuckle Plant!

222
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,958
See? We still
got it, right bud?

223
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,583
Ha! We never lost it, man!

224
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,125
Purple Flare!

225
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,208
Take this!

226
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,583
[WAKABA]
Father and son teamwork!

227
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,458
But I've got more than
a couple of tricks

228
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,416
of my own up my sleeve.

229
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:22,125
Fooled ya! That was just
my smoke you're chasin'.

230
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,375
Thanks for the
setup, ol' buddy!

231
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,250
That was awesome, Dad!

232
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,750
You're actually pretty
quick on your feet

233
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:29,583
for an old geezer!

234
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,416
Like you're one to talk.

235
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,333
[OLGA] Lightning God
Charged Particle Cannon!

236
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:43,375
Right. So how many of these
critters do I have left?

237
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,083
[OLGA gasps]

238
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,875
How'd I not notice
them all around me?

239
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,125
[OLGA grunts]

240
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,041
Arise. Iron Rock Wall!

241
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,958
It's Jura!

242
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:09,416
[JURA]
Hm! Rock Tor!

243
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,375
I never thought I'd say this,
but man, I'm glad to see you.

244
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,916
And even though
you beat me earlier,

245
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,750
it rocks having you on my team!

246
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,625
Power up White Drive!

247
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:32,208
Now feel my
White Dragon Roar!

248
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,708
[STING]
Ya like that? Take this!

249
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,291
[STING yelling]

250
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:51,875
Let's see how scary you are
when you can't even move!

251
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,791
[SCISSOR RUNNER]
You stupid human.

252
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,791
That's just pitiful.
I don't feel a thing.

253
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,125
Is that really
the best you can do?

254
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,250
[STING grunts]

255
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:04,250
[ROGUE]
Shadow Dragon Roar!

256
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,166
[LEVIA cackles]

257
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:15,000
[ROGUE panting]

258
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:20,541
[LEVIA] Rogue. You're much
too weak to defeat a dragon.

259
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:24,083
Why exhaust yourself
any further?

260
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,791
[ROGUE]
How do you know my name?

261
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:30,791
[LEVIA] I was specifically
instructed to spare your life.

262
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,916
[SHADOW ROGUE]
It's true, you know.

263
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,083
[ROGUE]
What are you?

264
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:39,291
I am you. At least, I am
another version of your future.

265
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,541
I am the darkness
that always follows you.

266
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,791
Born form the darkness
inside your heart.

267
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,083
[ROGUE]
Shut up!

268
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,666
[SHADOW ROGUE cackling]

269
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,583
Shut up! You're
lying! You're lying!

270
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,541
[LEVIA cackling]

271
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,083
[LEVIA]
You should stop fighting

272
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,041
if you know what's
good for you.

273
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:58,875
For you are the only human that
will survive this onslaught.

274
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:03,208
And in due time become
ruler of the world.

275
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,791
What are you talking about?

276
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,916
I have no desire
to rule the world!

277
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,750
Who told you to spare me?

278
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,416
[LEVIA]
Who? Why you did, Rogue.

279
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,708
[ROGUE gasps]

280
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,791
[LEVIA] You were the
one who summoned us.

281
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,208
We will destroy the
world at your request,

282
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,250
so you can rule
over the wreckage.

283
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,666
In seven years you
will hatch this plan,

284
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,208
and travel back to this time.

285
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:26,250
[ROGUE] Heh. I don't
believe all of this nonsense.

286
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,541
[SHADOW ROGUE]
But it's the truth.

287
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,500
[ROGUE gasps]

288
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:36,958
[ROGUE panting]

289
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,833
[LEVIA]
Look inside your heart.

290
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,875
You cannot deny it has
been stained by darkness.

291
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,541
[ROGUE]
What?

292
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:49,666
[LEVIA] Or rather, your heart
will be stained by darkness.

293
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,625
You have no choice
in the matter.

294
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,208
You must accept your fate.

295
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,041
It is your destiny
to live on and rule.

296
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:59,875
[ROGUE groaning]

297
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:05,583
It's not true. It can't
be true! You're lying!

298
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,166
There you are.

299
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:20,791
[NARRATOR] Let us travel
back in time to one hour ago.

300
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,458
[MELDY]
Natsu, are you okay?

301
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:25,500
You shouldn't try
to move just yet!

302
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,500
[NATSU]
She's gone isn't she?

303
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,125
[ULTEAR gasps]

304
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,000
[NATSU]
Lucy...

305
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:47,000
[NATSU panting]

306
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,000
[NATSU grunts]

307
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:56,791
[NATSU sobbing]

308
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,958
[NATSU]
No!

309
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:06,583
[ULTEAR]
Tell me who did this.

310
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:11,083
[NATSU] Rogue. He came from
seven years in the future.

311
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,708
So there was another
time traveler after all.

312
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,541
What does he want?

313
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,583
[NATSU]
I don't know.

314
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:19,333
He's our enemy?

315
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:25,208
[NATSU] He is mine.
Because he murdered Lucy.

316
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,875
Rogue is strong now,
but it seems like

317
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,250
he's gonna get
way more powerful

318
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,708
in the next few years.

319
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:33,083
Yes. But coming from the
future betrays a weakness.

320
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,458
[MELDY gasps]

321
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,208
If we were to kill the Rogue
that lives in our time,

322
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,958
then his future self
would cease to exist.

323
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,208
Are you sure?

324
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,416
Because it seems like
a major paradox to me.

325
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,625
There is already a
Rogue from the future.

326
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,375
So doesn't that mean the
one from now can't die?

327
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,250
I just don't think it'll work.

328
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,500
You would be right.

329
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,583
But time is not flowing
as it should right now.

330
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,083
It is in a state of flux.

331
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,708
There have been far
too many disturbances

332
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,125
in its natural flow,

333
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:02,083
people crossing from
one time to another.

334
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,458
We can use this
to our advantage.

335
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:05,958
[MELDY]
How?

336
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,333
Exactly as I
had said earlier.

337
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,166
We eliminate the
present day Rogue,

338
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,458
and the one from the future
will vanish completely.

339
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,791
And if that version of
him is out of the picture.

340
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,583
He can't come back
and wreak havoc.

341
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,625
Lucy won't die like this!

342
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,208
[NATSU]
No.

343
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,708
I'm gonna defeat that
future Rogue myself.

344
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,958
[ULTEAR] You're too emotional
to think clearly right now.

345
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,750
You don't understand!

346
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,000
[ULTEAR, MEDLY gasp]

347
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,458
[NATSU] The one from the
future is not the same

348
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,583
as the one from our time.

349
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:36,375
Something happened
and he lost his way.

350
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:40,166
We would be killing a
completely innocent person.

351
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,500
It's wrong. So, no.

352
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:43,916
Think of our futures.

353
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,500
Just who would we
be if we did this?

354
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:51,875
Good point. You're
absolutely right.

355
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,916
We cannot harm the
present day Rogue.

356
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,583
I won't touch him.

357
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:05,791
[ROGUE] I'd never do that.
It's all a lie. It has to be.

358
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:12,916
[ULTEAR]
I'm sorry. I made a promise.

359
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,875
But there's no other way.

360
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,833
[ULTEAR]
Rogue may be innocent now,

361
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,666
but he will fall from grace.

362
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,750
He will become the agent
of our destruction.

363
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,333
We just can't risk
letting this happen.

364
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:28,083
If he can't come
from the future,

365
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,500
he can't open the gate,

366
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:32,000
and the dragons
will never attack.

367
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,791
The only way to save the
world from this nightmare,

368
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:41,791
is to end his life
before it's too late.

369
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:15,125
[NATSU] Man, that has
got to be the tastiest fire

370
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:16,708
I've ever had!

371
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,583
[HAPPY] Really? So does dragon
fire taste all that different

372
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:19,583
than regular fire?

373
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,000
[NATSU]
Oh yeah, totally!

374
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:23,291
It's got a completely
different flavor profile.

375
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,083
There's a kind of richness
that normal fire

376
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:26,416
just can't compete with.

377
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,208
[HAPPY] Uh. This is gonna
take a while isn't it?

378
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:30,500
[NATSU] Ah, it's like
it's aged for super long,

379
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:32,583
it gives it such a
deep, smoky quality.

380
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:34,666
[HAPPY]
Well, he's sure fired up now.

381
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,875
[HAPPY and NATSU]
Next Time: Sin and Sacrifice!

382
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:39,166
[NATSU] But what really makes
my uncle's fire so special is--

383
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,958
[HAPPY] Yeah. It's all right.
Save it for another time.
