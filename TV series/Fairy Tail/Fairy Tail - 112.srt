00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,625
then maybe you should think
about learning some Card magic.

156
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,583
The ol' wino's actually got
some good advice now and then.

157
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,958
You think I could
learn? Honestly?

158
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:16,583
But how do I even
begin to learn magic?

159
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,541
[MAKAROV] With your heart. If
you want to learn, you have to

160
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,166
believe in your heart
that you can learn.

161
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,708
Like with your fortunetelling.

162
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,708
You have faith that what you
predict will come to pass.

163
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:29,708
Learning to use magic requires
the same faith and hard work

164
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,208
as any other useful skill.

165
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:35,000
If you can believe in
the way of the natural world,

166
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:38,708
trust in yourself, and learn
to live in harmony with both,

167
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:42,625
you will easily master
the power of magic.

168
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,833
Just let your heart
be your guide.

169
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,750
My heart.

170
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:52,791
[CANA] The very next day, I
started learning card magic.

171
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,125
I took to it like
a fish to water.

172
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:58,958
Hoping that mastering it would
somehow bring me closer to him.

173
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,375
But it didn't.

174
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,750
My father was
the guild's best wizard.

175
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,083
He was placed on a pedestal,

176
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:07,291
and everyone down below
basked in his radiance.

177
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:11,083
I was buried beneath them;
out of sight and out of mind.

178
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:16,958
Years went by, and I still
never told him who I was.

179
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,083
I started to fear telling him.

180
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,666
What if he rejected me?

181
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,916
What if I wasn't good enough?

182
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,750
Then they announced the
candidates for that years'

183
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:28,000
S-Class Promotion Trial.

184
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,583
[CANA]
Master chose me?

185
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,375
[GILDARTS]
I'm rooting for ya!

186
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,541
[CANA]
I decided then.

187
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,333
I would tell
my father the truth,

188
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:43,125
when I became an
S-Class wizard like him.

189
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:53,750
But for four years in a row
now, I've only known defeat.

190
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,875
Even Erza and Mira, who
joined the guild after I did,

191
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,750
managed to become S-Class.

192
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,875
I'm nothing but a failure.

193
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:07,000
My father could never
be proud of me as I am.

194
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:10,625
That's why I decided
to make this my last attempt.

195
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,000
Alright, then.

196
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,750
I've been seriously
considering quitting the guild.

197
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,000
[CANA]
Do you understand?

198
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,416
I have to be an S-Class
wizard or I'll never be able

199
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,375
to look him in the eye.

200
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:27,541
That's why this is my last one.
If I fail, I'll leave for good.

201
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,291
Cana, will you please
let me be your partner?

202
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,708
Fairy Tail just wouldn't
be the same without you.

203
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:38,000
I promise I can help you
become an S-Class wizard!

204
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:43,458
[alarm]

205
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,375
Help! Help! Help!

206
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,875
[LUCY]
So, what's with the card?

207
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,083
[CANA] Don't lose it.
If you're ever it trouble,

208
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,416
that'll let me know immediately.

209
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,875
The card I have will start
shining and lead me back to you.

210
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,875
No matter how far apart we are.

211
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:04,250

00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,250
Help! Help! Help!

213
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,708
[CANA]
What have I done? Lucy, I...

214
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:34,916
[CANA crying]

215
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,750
[CANA] No! It wasn't
supposed to be like this!

216
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:44,000
I never meant to
betray my friends.

217
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:47,666
I can't do this anymore.

218
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,250
[CANA crying]

219
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:01,291
[CANA] It's okay if I don't
become an S-Class wizard.

220
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:05,000
It's okay if I never
tell my father the truth.

221
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:08,083
As much as I want that.

222
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,666
I want to protect
my friends even more!

223
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,500
'Please! I have to save them.

224
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,750
That's my only
purpose right now!

225
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,416
It doesn't matter whether
I stay in the guild or not!

226
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,791
Because no matter
where I end up,

227
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:30,000
or who I become, my heart will
always belong to Fairy Tail!

228
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,666
I'm begging you.

229
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,041
I need the power.

230
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,666
And you're the only one
who can give it to me now!

231
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,708
I can't do it alone!

232
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:51,125
Give me the strength...

233
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,416
...to protect the guild and
family that I hold dear.

234
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:04,875
[FEMALE VOICE] Dry your eyes.
You have nothing to fear.

235
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,250
[CANA]
Could it be her?

236
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,458
Master Mavis.

237
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,583
Right!

238
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,916
I could be running straight
to my death, but I don't care.

239
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,250
I've got twelve years
of kindness to repay.

240
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,458
And you better believe
I'm gonna deliver!

241
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,416
-- [CARD] Help! Help!
-- [CANA] This way!

242
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,791
[CANA] Hang in there, Lucy.
I'll be there soon!

243
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,666
And I'm bringing
the big guns with me.

244
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,416
The Grand Spell, Fairy Glitter!

245
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,541
Whoever's attacking you is
about to get a face full of it.

246
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,916
With this spell
I can protect everyone!

247
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,125
Help! Help! Help!

248
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,375
[CANA] Are you the one
I need to squash?

249
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,333
Look!

250
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,541
Cana!

251
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:35,625
She's okay!

252
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,083
Better late than never!

253
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,666
Aye!

254
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,958
[CANA] I'm not letting you lay
another finger on my friends!

255
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,416
You're goin' down!

256
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,083
What's that?

257
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,416
I was gonna ask you!

258
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,583
[BLUENOTE]
It can't be!

259
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,000
Tell me what that magic
is or you die here.

260
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,291
Is it possible she learned
to use Fairy Glitter?

261
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,500
Huh?

262
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:07,458
[CANA] I'm sorry. For leaving
you in the forest, I mean.

263
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,208
I betrayed you,
and our friendship.

264
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,583
That was unforgivable.

265
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,500
But with this
I can begin to atone.

266
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,583
One shot from this spell
will make sure this creep

267
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,708
doesn't bother anyone again.

268
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,416
Awesome! Does that mean
you found the grave!

269
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,666
What! She did! But if she
found it that means. Man!

270
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,916
I don't get to be
S-Class this year.

271
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,500
[CANA] We can talk about
the trial later, Natsu.

272
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,083
Right now, I need your
help to beat this guy.

273
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,500
Keep him distracted long enough
for me to gather the power

274
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:39,958
to send him packin'.

275
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,375
Little girl,
you've gravely misjudged

276
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,666
the gravity of your situation.

277
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,000
[BLUENOTE] I never thought Fairy
Glitter would be delivered

278
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,958
to me personally...

279
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,583
Now, if you'd be so kind.

280
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,125
It's time I took
that spell off your hands.

281
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,375
[CANA] Unless you plan on
joining the Fairy Tail guild,

282
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,041
that's not gonna happen.

283
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,125
The spell is useless
to anyone else!

284
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,458
[BLUENOTE] If you knew
the origins of magic,

285
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:22,958
you'd realize all spells are
fundamentally the same.

286
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:26,750
Every type of magic that exists
today was once part of a single,

287
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:27,958
unified whole.

288
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:31,000
[LUCY]
A single type of magic?

289
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:34,833
That sounds familiar,
but I can't remember why.

290
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,291
[BLUENOTE] I've approached
the Abyss of Sorcery.

291
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,708
I don't need to join your guild
to use that spell or any other.

292
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,458
Cana!

293
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,958
[NATSU]
I... can't move!

294
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,666
[BLUENOTE]
I have a question for you .

295
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,208
Did you think you
were capable of wielding

296
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,791
an advanced spell
like Fairy Glitter?

297
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,000
Got a problem with that, jerk?

298
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,416
[BLUENOTE It's an ultra-level
spell that uses pure light to

299
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,958
deny the existence of anyone its
wielder deems to be an enemy.

300
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,458
You bet I've got a problem

301
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,291
with an amateur who thinks
she could control such power.

302
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,916
Don't worry.

303
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,750
I intend to relieve you of it
as painfully as possible.

304
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:23,750
Oh Natsu!

305
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,500
I guess even his
strength can't stand up

306
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,083
to this level of gravity.

307
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,416
Just watch, I think
he'll surprise you.

308
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,000
[NATSU]
Fire Dragon!

309
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:37,333
Roar!

310
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,708
He did it!

311
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,208
Cocky little brat!

312
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,333
[CANA]
Nice one, Natsu!

313
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,666
Go! Now!

314
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,541
[CANA] This amateur's
about to rock your world.

315
00:19:56,875 --> 00:20:00,583
Assemble. O river of
light guided by fairies!

316
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,375
This is what a member
of Fairy Tail can do!

317
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,250
She's doing it. But how!

318
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,333
The sun's breaking
through the rain clouds!

319
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:23,625
Sun light with moon light
and the light of the stars!

320
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,750
[CANA] May your radiance
shine and vanquish

321
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,625
the fangs of wickedness!

322
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:34,958
Adios, you bastard!
Go! Fairy Glitter!

323
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,166
[LUCY]
Whoa! This light's intense!

324
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,166
[WENDY] I guess this
is what we should expect

325
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,291
from our Grand Spell!

326
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,083
For my family!

327
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,125
[BLUENOTE]
Fall!

328
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:18,958
[BLUENOTE] So that's the skill
it takes to use Fairy Glitter?

329
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,666
Don't make me laugh.

330
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,625
I guess even ultimate power
can be garbage when it's put

331
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:29,208
in the hands
of lowly trash like you.

332
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,458
[CANA]
I failed again.

333
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,458
[BLUENOTE]
I'll take the spell now.

334
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:37,166
And the good news is I don't
need you alive to do so.

335
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,541
[CANA]
My last chance and I blew it!

336
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,125
[NATSU]
Cana!

337
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,458
[LUCY]
Run away!

338
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,250
[WENDY]
Leave her alone!

339
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:48,791
[BLUENOTE] Another day passes
and I still didn't get to fly.

340
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,916
Maybe sending you to hell
will lift my spirits.

341
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:27,125
I don't believe it!

342
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,125
-- [CARLA] We're saved.
-- [HAPPY] Gildarts is here!

343
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:38,625
[CANA]
Dad.

344
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:46,875
♪

345
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:15,416
[HAPPY] Hey, Natsu. Did you know
that huge tree that covers

346
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,458
the island is called
the Tenrou Tree?

347
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:18,708
[NATSU]
Yeah, and Master Mavis

348
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,750
is buried somewhere at
the bottom or something.

349
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,458
Wait, does that make it
a "Fairy Tree"?

350
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:24,083
[HAPPY] Whoa, maybe
that means that a fairy

351
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:25,250
will grow out of it!

352
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:27,000
[NATSU] That would rule!
I wanna fight it!

353
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:28,750
[HAPPY] Sometimes I think
eating, sleeping, and fighting

354
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:31,000
are the only things
you care about.

355
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,416
[HAPPY and NATSU]
Next Episode: Tenrou Tree

356
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,916
[NATSU] That isn't true! I care
about messing with Lucy;

357
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,416
sneaking into Lucy's house;
Making Lucy do stuff

358
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,875
[HAPPY] Sounds like this
might take a while.

359
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:41,916
Could you write it down
for me instead?
