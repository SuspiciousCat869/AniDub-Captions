00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:20,208
- Natsu:
PREVIOUSLY, ON "FAIRY TAIL"...

2
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:21,708
- Happy: CARLA
AND I HAVE RETURNED

3
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,291
TO OUR HOMELAND OF EDOLAS.

4
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:24,791
- Lucy: AND BROUGHT US ALONG
FOR THE RIDE.

5
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,791
THIS PLACE IS SO DIFFERENT
FROM OUR WORLD.

6
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,041
- IT'S WAY COOLER, AND CATS ARE
SUPERIOR TO HUMANS HERE,

7
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:32,416
WHICH MEANS I CAN ORDER NATSU
AROUND IF I WANT TO.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,166
- Natsu: WHATEVER,
LET'S GET BACK ON TOPIC, HAPPY.

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,833

- Man: NO, IT CAN'T BE.

00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,625
- Man #2:
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

34
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:17,500
IT LOOKS JUST LIKE HER.

35
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,708
CAPTAIN ERZA?

36
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,750
- ERZA.

37
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,750
GRAY.

38
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,208
- WAIT.  IS THAT GRAY SURGE?

39
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,250
- NO,
THOSE TWO ARE EARTH LANDERS.

40
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,583
- YOU GUYS HAVE GOT SOME
EXPLAINING TO DO.

41
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,041
WHERE ARE OUR FRIENDS

42
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:39,375
THAT YOUR KING TURNED
INTO A LACRIMA?  HA!

43
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:53,000
- ( Happy speaking )

44
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,291
- IT'S ERZA AGAINST ERZA.

45
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:06,250
- Natsu: YOU ASKED FOR IT.
YOU GUYS ARE IN BIG TROUBLE NOW.

46
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,666
I'M GONNA BEAT THE CRAP OUTTA
EVERY LAST ONE OF YOU.

47
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,750
- WHOA.  NATSU?
- YEAH, HE MUST BE NEARBY.

48
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:14,166
- IT CAME FROM UP AHEAD.
- AND I BET WENDY'S WITH HIM.

49
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,916
- GO ON, I CAN HANDLE THIS.
- RIGHT.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,875
YOU OKAY?
CAN YOU STAND UP?

51
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,208
- YEAH.

52
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,208
WHERE THE HECK DID
YOU GUYS COME FROM?

53
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,625
- I'LL GIVE YOU ALL
THE DETAILS LATER.  LET'S GO.

54
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,958
- NEVER WOULD'VE IMAGINED
I'D FACE OFF WITH MYSELF.

55
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:43,291
- QUITE AN ODD FEELING INDEED.
- I'M THE CAPTAIN OF THE KINGDOM

56
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:46,291
OF EDOLAS' SECOND MAGIC
WARFARE UNIT.

57
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,458
MY NAME IS ERZA KNIGHTWALKER.

58
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,583
- I'M A WIZARD FROM
EARTH LAND'S FAIRY TAIL...

59
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,750
AND MY NAME IS ERZA SCARLET.

60
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:56,541
- WELL, IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET
YOU, EARTH LAND VERSION OF ME.

61
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:59,291
NOW LET'S SEE WHAT
YOU'RE MADE OF.

62
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,166
SILFARION!

63
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,416
- SHE'S FAST.

64
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,333
IN THAT CASE, FLIGHT ARMOR!

65
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,708
- SHE CHANGED HER ARMOR

66
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:20,416
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HER
SPEED HAS INCREASED.  HA!

67
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:25,208
MEL-FORCE.

68
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,000
- ( grunts )

69
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:35,125
A REQUIP?  NO, IT LOOKS
AS THOUGH SHE'S SIMPLY

70
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,083
ALTERING HER WEAPON'S FORM.
EXPLOSION!

71
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,416
- HOW DOES SHE KEEP TRANSFORMING
HER ARMOR LIKE THAT?

72
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,375
YOUR MAGIC ALLOWS YOU
TO CHANGE

73
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,625
YOUR ARMOR AND SWORD
SIMULTANEOUSLY?

74
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,250
- IT SEEMS UNFAIR,
DOESN'T IT?

75
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,125
ESPECIALLY WHEN ALL YOU CAN
DO IS ALTER YOUR WEAPON.

76
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,166
IT MAY APPEAR THAT
WAY TO YOU,

77
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,083
BUT MY BATTLE STRENGTH IS
BOOSTED BY THE FORM OF MY SPEAR.

78
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,250
- WHILE THE PRINCIPLE
IS DIFFERENT,

79
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:08,541
IT'S THE SAME AS "THE KNIGHT"
REQUIP I USE IN COMBAT.

80
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,666
- LET ME GIVE YOU A TASTE
OF THE TRUE POWER

81
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,208
OF MY MAGICAL SPEAR
WITH THE "TEN COMMANDMENTS."

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,250
- COME ON.

83
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,083
- YOU MEAN, THE LACRIMA
IN THE PLAZA?

84
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,458
YEAH, THAT'S THE ONE.

85
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,958
ERZA AND I WERE
TRAPPED INSIDE OF IT.

86
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,916
- WOW, SERIOUSLY?
- BUT HOW WERE YOU GUYS ABLE

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,416
TO TURN BACK TO NORMAL?

88
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,333
- IT'S ALL THANKS TO GAJEEL.
- HUH?

89
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,541
- ALL RIGHT, IT'S ABOUT TIME
FOR ME TO MAKE MY MOVE.

90
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,208
HERE GOES.

91
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:41,000
- HEY, DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME?
I SAID MOVE BACK.

92
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:44,625
- THAT MYSTOGAN GUY MAY BE ONE
FREAKY WEIRDO,

93
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,500
BUT I'VE GOT NO OTHER CHOICE
BUT TO TRUST HIM FOR RIGHT NOW.

94
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:51,291
- IRON DRAGON CLUB!
IRON DRAGON SWORD.

95
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,750
AIN'T NO STOPPING ME!

96
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,958
( shouts )

97
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,958
WHOA, WHAT THE--

98
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,791
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDIN' ME...

99
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,583
IT WAS JUST THE TWO OF THEM?

100
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:29,000
ALL RIGHT,
YOU'RE FREE SO LOOK ALIVE.

101
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,041
- ( metal clatters )
- ( gasps )

102
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:52,083
- I WAS WORRIED THEY'D
FRIED YOUR BRAINS.

103
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:55,291
- GAJEEL.
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

104
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,958
- WE CAN TALK LATER.  RIGHT NOW
WE GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE.

105
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,125
- DON'T MAKE A MOVE.

106
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,708
- YOU'RE NOT GETTING AWAY
WITH THIS.  CAPTURE THEM.

107
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,708
- ( shouting )

108
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,291
- ( grunts )

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,625
MY MAGIC ISN'T WORKING.
- WHAT?

110
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,500
-I SAID
I'LL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING LATER.

111
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:13,875
IRON DRAGON ROAR!

112
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,416
- HOW COME YOU WERE YOU
ABLE TO USE MAGIC?

113
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,041
- I'LL TELL YOU ONCE
YOU TAKE ONE OF THESE.

114
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,291
- WHAT IS IT?
- ENOUGH ALREADY.

115
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,375
JUST TELL US WHAT HAPPENED.

116
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,500
- THE TWO OF YOU HAD BEEN TURNED
INTO A GIANT LACRIMA.

117
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,125
- TOLD YOU IT'D BE EASY...
- INDEED.

118
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,500
BUT I'D EXPECT NO LESS
FROM EARTH LAND ME.

119
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,166
I KNEW YOU WERE THE RIGHT MAN
FOR THE JOB.

120
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,333
- THIS IS INSANE.
- THERE'S TWO?

121
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:51,625
- ALTHOUGH WE LOOK ALIKE,
WE'RE ACTUALLY QUITE DIFFERENT.

122
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,500
- EDOLAS GAJEEL AT YOUR SERVICE.

123
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,958
- I GOTTA SAY,
THIS GUY'S BEEN A BIG HELP.

124
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,458
CRAZY HOW MUCH HE LOOKS LIKE ME.
WE'RE LIKE TWINS.

125
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:01,166
( laughs )
- NEVER MIND THAT.

126
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,208
WHAT DO YOU MEAN WE WERE
TURNED INTO A GIANT LACRIMA?

127
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:05,875
- GUESS SHE'S NOT IMPRESSED.

128
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,000
- I DOUBT MANY CHICKS
WOULD BE IMPRESSED

129
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:11,708
BY TWO OF THAT UGLY MUG.

130
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,833
- IT SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT ALL THE
EARTH LAND FAIRY TAIL WIZARDS

131
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,500
WERE TURNED INTO A LACRIMA.

132
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,750
THE KING WANTS TO GET HIS HANDS
ON YOUR MAGIC POWER.

133
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,416
THE ONE IN THE PLAZA
WAS SO BIG

134
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,833
WE THOUGHT EVERYONE
FROM YOUR GUILD WAS INSIDE IT.

135
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,625
- BUT OBVIOUSLY WE WERE WRONG

136
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,291
'CAUSE IT TURNED OUT TO
BE JUST THE TWO OF YOU.

137
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,458
- JEEZ, HOW BIG
IS THE MAIN LACRIMA?

138
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,000
YOU KNOW,
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,

139
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,208
I DID HAPPEN TO NOTICE THAT
THE LACRIMA IN THE PLAZA

140
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,333
HAD A JAGGED SURFACE AS THOUGH
IT HAD SOMEHOW BEEN CUT OFF

141
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,833
OF A MUCH LARGER ONE.

142
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,625
- SO MANY QUESTIONS.
I'M NOT SURE WHERE TO START...

143
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,375
FIRST, WHAT'S THAT STUFF
YOU'RE FORCING ON US?

144
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,833
- THESE PILLS ARE CALLED
X-BALLS.

145
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,875
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO USE MAGIC
IN EDOLAS UNLESS YOU TAKE ONE.

146
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:51,375
I MEAN,
THAT'S WHAT I HEARD, AT LEAST.

147
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,625
- OH, AND WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

148
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,916
- IT'S WHAT MYSTOGAN SAID
WHEN HE GAVE 'EM TO ME.

149
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,333
- YOU SAW MYSTOGAN?

150
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,625
- THAT'S RIGHT.
I ALMOST FORGOT.

151
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,833
GAJEEL'S A DRAGON SLAYER,

152
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,083
IT MAKES SENSE THAT THE ANIMA
DIDN'T WORK ON HIM.

153
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:11,083
- I GUESS THAT ALL DRAGON
SLAYERS WERE LEFT IN EARTH LAND.

154
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,666
- ACCORDING TO GAJEEL, IT WAS
MYSTOGAN WHO TOLD HIM TO COME.

155
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,166
- REALLY?
BUT I DON'T GET IT.

156
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,875
WHY DIDN'T HE JUST
COME HERE HIMSELF?

157
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,083
- 'CAUSE APPARENTLY
DRAGON SLAYER MAGIC IS CAPABLE

158
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,416
OF ALL SORTS OF THINGS NO OTHER
MAGIC CAN DO IN THIS WORLD.

159
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,125
THEY EVEN HAVE THE POWER
TO CHANGE EVERYONE WHO'S STUCK

160
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:28,291
IN THAT LACRIMA BACK TO NORMAL.
- SERIOUSLY?

161
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,333
- CARLA AND I SAW
THAT LACRIMA EARLIER,

162
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,625
 AND I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE IT IS.

163
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,041
- YOU THINK YOU
COULD GET CLOSE TO IT?

164
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,500
- AYE.

165
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,541
- I GUESS THAT MEANS
WE CAN CALL OFF GAJEEL.

166
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,166
HE'S OUT THERE RAMPAGING THROUGH
TOWN LOOKING FOR IT AS WE SPEAK.

167
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,750
- ( laughs )

168
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,291
- ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU'RE GONNA
BE ABLE TO LEAD HIM STRAIGHT

169
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,416
TO THE LACRIMA?
- I'LL TAKE HIM THERE AS LONG

170
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,375
AS YOU'RE SURE HE CAN CHANGE
EVERYBODY BACK.

171
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,166
- HE'S OUR ONLY HOPE.

172
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,875
NATSU AND WENDY HAVE
THE POWER TO DO IT, TOO.

173
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,083
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT NEITHER ONE
OF 'EM KNOW HOW.

174
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:57,333
- DON'T WORRY, GAJEEL AND I ARE
GONNA GET OUR FRIENDS BACK

175
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:58,708
RIGHT NOW.

176
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,458
-  WAIT.  ARE YOU GONNA BE OKAY
BY YOURSELF, HAPPY?

177
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,916
- HE'LL BE FINE.

178
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,791
- WE'D BETTER GET GOING.
WE GOTTA FIND NATSU AND WENDY.

179
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,458
- HEY, LOOK.
THERE'S A DOOR UP AHEAD.

180
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,958
- THAT MUST BE WHERE
THEY'RE HOLDING 'EM.

181
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:24,833
( grunts )

182
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,916
- Lucy: NATSU. 
- Carla: WENDY.

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,375
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
COME ON, SAY SOMETHING.

184
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,666
- WENDY.

185
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,291
- HEY, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

186
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,791
- SHE'S OUT COLD.
I CAN'T WAKE HER UP.

187
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,333
- YEAH, SO IS HE.
- I'M SORRY.

188
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:42,291
WENDY, FORGIVE ME.
( crying )

189
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,875
- HEY, THIS IS NO TIME
TO BE SLEEPING ON THE JOB!

190
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,708
WAKE UP ALREADY,
YOU LAZY PYROMANIAC.

191
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,125
EVERYONE'S COUNTING
ON YOU TO HELP 'EM OUT.

192
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,791
WE MIGHT AS WELL FEED 'EM
SOME X-BALLS WHILE THEY'RE OUT.

193
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:56,041
OPEN YOUR MOUTH, YOU LOSER.
- WHAT ARE THOSE?

194
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:59,041
- THEY'RE MAGIC PILLS THAT
GAJEEL TOLD US TO TAKE.

195
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,666
DIDN'T MYSTOGAN GIVE YOU ONE
WHENEVER YOU RAN INTO HIM?

196
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,750
- YOU'LL NEED
TO EAT ONE OF THESE.

197
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,875
- HUH?  WHAT ARE YOU?

198
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,541
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS?

199
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,583
I WAS WONDERING WHAT
HE POPPED IN MY MOUTH.

200
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,125
- IT'S A GOOD THING YOU TOOK ONE
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T USE YOUR MAGIC

201
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,000
IN THIS WORLD WITHOUT IT.
- I HAD NO IDEA.

202
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:20,333
- ( gulps )

203
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:23,250
( coughing )

204
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,500
- NATSU!

205
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,166
- Gray: OKAY, NOW LET'S
GIVE ONE TO WENDY.

206
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,375
- ( groans)

207
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,833
- ARE YOU FEELING BETTER?

208
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,208
( gasps )

209
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:41,125
- YEAH, BUT WE GOTTA HURRY
AND STOP 'EM.

210
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:44,083
- STOP WHO?

211
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,833
- ( roars )
- ( screams )

212
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:53,208
- NATSU!
- HEY, COME BACK HERE.

213
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,208
- ( coughing )

214
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,958
- WENDY, WHAT'S WRONG?
- ARE YOU OKAY?

215
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,541
- OH, HEY, CARLA.

216
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,125
- ARE YOU HURT?

217
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,416
- NO, I'M FINE BUT--

218
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,083
THE OTHERS ARE IN TROUBLE.

219
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:23,000
- I APOLOGIZE
FOR MAKING YOU WAIT, MY LORD.

220
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:27,375
WE'VE MORE OR LESS COMPLETED
THE EXTRACTION, SIR.

221
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,541
- I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT, BYRO.

222
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:33,541
- THE DRAGON SLAYERS' MAGIC
POWER IS SPECTACULAR INDEED.

223
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,208
NOW THAT WE POSSESS IT,

224
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:38,791
WEAPONIZING IT WILL PROVE
TO BE A SIMPLE TASK.

225
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,958
- ( cackles )

226
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:46,416
- ( crying )
IT'S HORRIBLE.

227
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,125
THE ROYAL ARMY.
THEY'RE GONNA DESTROY EXTALIA

228
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,875
BY CRASHING THE GIANT LACRIMA
DIRECTLY INTO IT.

229
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:57,833
ALL OF OUR FRIENDS IN FAIRY TAIL
ARE IN DANGER

230
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,666
BECAUSE THE KING OF EDOLAS
IS GONNA USE THEM AS A BOMB.

231
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,333
- THE MOMENT I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR HAS FINALLY ARRIVED.

232
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,750
UPON IMPACT THE MAGIC OF THE
EARTH LANDERS AND THE EXCEEDS

233
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,958
WILL EXPLODE AND FUSE TOGETHER.

234
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:13,583
AND THEN, EVERLASTING MAGIC
POWER SHALL RAIN DOWN

235
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:14,791
UPON OUR KINGDOM!

236
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:18,083
( laughing )

237
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,416
- Lucy: I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU NOTICED,

238
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,583
BUT EDOLAS HAS ISLANDS
THAT FLOAT IN THE SKY.

239
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,250
THERE'S A BUNCH OF 'EM.

240
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:39,375
EXTALIA'S MAGIC POWER
IS WHAT KEEPS THEM AFLOAT.

241
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:42,666
WHAT'S MORE, THE BOOK I READ
SAID THAT IT'S WHAT MAINTAINS

242
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,250
THE MAGICAL BALANCE
OF THIS ENTIRE WORLD.

243
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,333
- AND YOU THINK THAT OUR GUILD
MATES MIGHT BE STUCK ON ONE

244
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,458
OF THOSE FLOATING ISLANDS.

245
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,583
- YES, THEY'RE ON ONE VERY
CLOSE TO EXTALIA.

246
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:58,500
BOTH EXTALIA AND THE LACRIMA
CONTAINING OUR FRIENDS

247
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,666
ARE FLOATING IN THE SKIES
ABOVE THE ROYAL CITY,

248
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,708
WHICH IS WHERE WE ARE NOW.

249
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,291
- THE ROYAL ARMY IS PLANNING
TO HIT THAT FLOATING ISLAND

250
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,458
WITH A BUNCH
OF DRAGON SLAYER MAGIC.

251
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,833
THEY WANT TO SPEED IT UP

252
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:13,125
SO IT'LL CRASH DIRECTLY
INTO EXTALIA.

253
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,666
- WHAT'LL HAPPEN THEN?

254
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,458
- THEY'RE SAYING WHEN
THEIR POWERS COLLIDE,

255
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,666
IT'S GONNA CAUSE A GIGANTIC
EXPLOSION IN THE SKY

256
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,291
AND THEIR MAGIC'LL
FUSE TOGETHER.

257
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:27,875
THEN MAGIC POWER WILL RAIN DOWN
ON THE KINGDOM FOREVER.

258
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,375
- BUT IF THAT HAPPENS,
ALL OF OUR GUILD MATES WILL--

259
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,333
- BE LOST FOREVER.

260
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,166
- ( footsteps )

261
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,208
- HEAR THAT? 
SOMEONE'S COMING.

262
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,166
- THE GUARDS?

263
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,583
- WE'LL SEE.

264
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,041
- ( screaming )

265
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:46,125
- YOU SCARED US, NATSU.
- DID YOU SEE THAT?

266
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,291
THERE WERE TWO ERZAS.
AS IF ONE WASN'T ENOUGH.

267
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,125
IT'S TERRIFYING!

268
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,166
A SHOWDOWN BETWEEN
THOSE TWO MONSTERS?

269
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,708
IF THAT'S THE CASE, THIS WORLD
IS DOOMED, I TELL YOU.

270
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,083
ARE YOU MY GRAY
OR WEIRD GRAY?

271
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,166
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT. COOL IT.

272
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,083
YOU'RE GONNA GET A LEFT HOOK
TO THE JAW, PYRO.

273
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,083
- THAT ANSWERS THAT.  IT'S
OBVIOUS HE'S EARTH LAND GRAY.

274
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,333
- IT'S YOU?
- A BUNCH OF STUFF HAPPENED

275
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,791
AND NOW I'M HERE.
ERZA AND GAJEEL, TOO.

276
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,416
- HAPPY'S TAKING HIM
TO STOP THE LACRIMA.

277
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,875
- HUH?  YOU'RE THE REAL GRAY?
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?

278
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,375
- WHAT?
YOU MEAN YOU JUST NOW NOTICED?

279
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,708
- UH-HUH.

280
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,333
- I GET IT.
YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ME

281
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,416
BECAUSE IT'S SO DARK
DOWN HERE, RIGHT?

282
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,875
IT'S NOT BECAUSE I'M SOME LAME-O

283
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,416
WHO'S PRACTICALLY
INVISIBLE TO YOU.

284
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,291
- WOULD YOU QUIT SULKING?
- WAIT A SECOND.

285
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,791
DID YOU JUST COME DOWN
AND SAVE US A MINUTE AGO?

286
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,916
OH, AND YOU'RE OKAY,
TOO, LUCY.

287
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,875
- I GUESS ALL YOU DRAGON SLAYERS
ARE OBLIVIOUS, HUH?

288
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,750
- I'M SORRY I OFFENDED YOU,
GRAY.  I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

289
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:51,458
I PROMISE.  THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR SAVING US.

290
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,583
- Gray:
EH, DON'T MENTION IT.

291
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,500
- I DIDN'T FORGET
ABOUT YOU, CARLA.

292
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,708
THANKS FOR COMING
TO MY RESCUE AGAIN.

293
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,500
YOU'RE THE GREATEST.

294
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,750
- DUDE, YOU'RE SHIRTLESS
IN FRONT OF THE KID.

295
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,333
- NOT COOL.
- I AM?  WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?

296
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,375
- YOU'VE BEEN THAT WAY
FROM THE START, GRAY.

297
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,625
- ALL RIGHT,
ARE YOU GUYS READY?

298
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:23,625
LET'S GO FIND THE KING AND STOP
HIM FROM CRASHING THAT LACRIMA.

299
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:26,125
- YEAH.
- NO, WAIT.

300
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:29,000
WE CAN'T GO THAT WAY. IT'S WHERE
THE TWO MONSTERS ARE FIGHTING.

301
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,833
- WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE ERZA
TO FEND FOR HERSELF.

302
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,666
- DO YOU WANNA GET
IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT?

303
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,333
- YOU KNOW,
YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT.

304
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:39,500
- CARLA, I THINK THE TWO OF US
SHOULD HEAD TO EXTALIA.

305
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,416
- THAT'S FOOLISH.

306
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,291
- WE NEED TO WARN THEM ABOUT
THE ROYAL ARMY'S PLAN

307
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:47,250
AND HELP EVERYONE ESCAPE.
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

308
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,083
I THOUGHT WE WERE
GOING TO STOP THE ATTACK.

309
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,583
- THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN LET THE
KING JUST DO WHATEVER HE WANTS.

310
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,500
I KNOW NATSU AND THE
OTHERS WILL STOP HIM.

311
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:57,583
BUT WHAT IF THE KING AND HIS
ROYAL ARMY HAVE OTHER WEAPONS

312
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,166
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT?

313
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,083
THIS IS THE ONLY CHANCE
WE HAVE TO WARN 'EM.

314
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,791
THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW
CITIZENS COULD BE IN DANGER.

315
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,791
- NO, I'M NOT GOING BACK.

316
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,708
I COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENS

317
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,791
TO THOSE HORRIBLE CREATURES.

318
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:17,083
- THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH BEING HUMAN OR EXCEED.

319
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,791
IF THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO
AS FELLOW LIVING BEINGS,

320
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,708
THEN WE HAVE TO DO IT.

321
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,458
- SAVE THE EXCEEDS?

322
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,083
- I PROMISE I'LL ALWAYS
BE RIGHT BY YOUR SIDE.

323
00:17:57,166 --> 00:18:00,500
NO NEED TO BE AFRAID, OKAY?

324
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,500
- Carla: FINE, I'LL GO.

325
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,750
- GAJEEL!

326
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:17,041
- HEY, CAT.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

327
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,083
- I KNOW WHERE THEY'RE KEEPING
THE LACRIMA THAT THE OTHERS

328
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,708
ARE TRAPPED IN
SO I'M GONNA TAKE YOU THERE.

329
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,583
- WAIT A SECOND.
GET YOUR PAWS OFF OF ME.

330
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:27,458
- DID YOU HAVE DO ANYTHING
SPECIAL TO CHANGE GRAY

331
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,750
AND ERZA BACK TO NORMAL?

332
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,916
- JUST SMASH IT
WITH DRAGON SLAYER MAGIC.

333
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,916
- REALLY?
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT WOULD WORK?

334
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,375
- I JUST DID WHAT MYSTOGAN
TOLD ME TO DO.

335
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,500
YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT,
FURBALL?

336
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,041
- SO IS MYSTOGAN SOMEWHERE
IN EDOLAS RIGHT NOW?

337
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,291
- I DON'T KNOW.

338
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:54,000
- OH, MAN, IT'S HUGE.
- IT'S BIGGER THAN I IMAGINED.

339
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:57,291
- OF COURSE IT IS.  TALK ABOUT
A HIGH-MAINTENANCE GUILD.

340
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,500
( stomach rumbles )

341
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:02,541
I EXPECT ALL THE IRON
I CAN EAT WHENEVER WE GET BACK.

342
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,375
- YOU CAN HAVE AS MUCH
AS YOU WANT.

343
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,708
- THAT CAT'S GOT A MAJOR SWORD.
- OH!

344
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,375
NOT YOU AGAIN.

345
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,916
- THE ROYAL ARMY'S
1ST MAGIC WARFARE UNIT.

346
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,791
CAPTAIN.

347
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,208
KNOWN AS PANTHERLILY.

348
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:33,875
MY CURRENT OPERATION IS
DEPENDENT ON THIS LACRIMA.

349
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,500
MAKE ONE MORE MOVE
AND YOU'RE DEAD.

350
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:40,666
- THOSE WINGS.  DOES THAT MEAN
HE'S AN EXCEED TOO?

351
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,375
- STAY OUTTA THE WAY.
IRON DRAGON SWORD!

352
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:48,916
BUSTER ARM.

353
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:03,416
- DON'T YOU THINK A SWORD
THAT GIGANTIC IS OVERKILL?

354
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,666
- MAN, HE'S STRONG.

355
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,916
- VALIANT EFFORT,
BUT YOU WILL NOT DEFEAT ME.

356
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,875
- ANY IDEA WHERE THIS JERK
OF A KING MIGHT BE HIDING?

357
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,583
- SEEING AS HE'S
THE KING AND ALL,

358
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,875
HE'S PROBABLY IN SOME
HIGH-AND-MIGHTY PLACE.

359
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,875
- I WAS ASKING YOU
FOR SPECIFICS, FROSTY.

360
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,625
- HOW SHOULD I KNOW?  LIKE I'VE
SET FOOT IN THIS CASTLE BEFORE.

361
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,458
CUT ME SOME SLACK, WOULD YOU?

362
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,208
- CUT IT OUT, GUYS.

363
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,208
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE LAYOUT
OF THIS PLACE

364
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:45,916
THE CELLS ARE WAY UP HIGH AND
THE COURTYARD IS REALLY COMPLEX.

365
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,125
I'VE HEARD ABOUT CONCENTRIC
CASTLES.  THIS ISN'T LIKE THOSE.

366
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,875
IT'S JUST SO DIFFERENT FROM
ANYTHING IN EARTH LAND.

367
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,208
IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH
TO FIGURE OUT.

368
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,750
- WHAT ARE YOU BLABBERING
ABOUT OVER THERE, LUCY?

369
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,666
- I KNOW THIS CASTLE'S LAYOUT IS
WEIRD, BUT IS IT REALLY CRAZY?

370
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,625
- AFRAID SO.
IN FACT, IT'S SO CRAZY,

371
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,875
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY
WERE HIDING AN AMUSEMENT PARK

372
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,791
IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

373
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,083
- ( both gasp )
- THERE IS ONE!

374
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,500
- WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

375
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:24,000
I WAS JUST KIDDING.

376
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:27,541
- WHAT THE--
THIS KING IS A TOTAL NUTJOB.

377
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,416
- YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT
TO CALL ANYBODY ELSE A NUTJOB

378
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,875
WITH THAT KIND OF LOOK
ON YOUR FACE.

379
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:46,583
- MMM.  I JUST LOVE CAROUSELS.
( laughing )

380
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:52,666
THEY'RE SO MUCH FUN.
YOU WANNA GIVE IT A TRY?

381
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,125
HMM?

382
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,125
- ( screaming )

383
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:06,041
- WHO KNEW THAT UNLIMITED MAGIC
POWER COULD BE SUCH A BLAST?

384
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:10,041
IT SUCKS THAT WE'RE SO CLOSE
TO RUNNING OUT OF IT FOR GOOD.

385
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:16,083
JUST THE THOUGHT
OF IT MAKES ME MAD, REAL MAD.

386
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,583
OUR KINGDOM IS GOING TO
OBTAIN

387
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:21,083
EVERLASTING MAGIC POWER,

388
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,958
AND WE'RE WILLING
TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES

389
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,250
IN ORDER TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

390
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:34,291
- Hughes: I HATE TO ADMIT IT,
BUT WE'RE DESPERATE.

391
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:38,875
SO IF ANYONE GETS IN OUR WAY,
WE GOTTA CUT 'EM DOWN.

392
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,291
- ( theme music playing )

393
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,750
- ( singing in Japanese )

394
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:14,875
- Natsu: WHOA!
CHECK IT OUT, HAPPY.

395
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:17,458
THERE'S A FREAKING AMUSEMENT
PARK INSIDE THE CASTLE.

396
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,041
- Happy: THAT'S SO COOL.

397
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,208
YOU THINK ALL THESE RIDES
RUN ON MAGIC POWER?

398
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:24,333
- YEAH, THEY PROBABLY DO.
AW, WHO CARES, LITTLE BUDDY?

399
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:26,750
COME ON, WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GO HAVE SOME FUN?

400
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:30,916
- DID YOU FORGET WHY WE CAME
HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE?

401
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,416
( Happy and Natsu speaking )

402
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,416
BESIDES, YOU CAN'T GO ON RIDES
WITH YOUR MOTION SICKNESS.

403
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,166
- THANKS FOR REMINDING ME.
I'M GONNA HURL.

404
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,916
- ALL I GOTTA DO IS MENTION IT
AND YOU START TO BARF.
