1
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:42,000
I think we should camp
here for the night.

2
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,666
I wanna get these guys to a
doctor as soon as possible,

3
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,833
but they need their rest.

4
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,500
[PRECHT]
I told you, I'm fine.

5
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:50,458
[ZERA] I bet there's not
a doctor around for miles.

6
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:53,666
I'll be back. I'm going to
gather some water for us.

7
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,416
Please be careful.

8
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:51,541
[MAVIS]
This is all my fault.

9
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,333
We were fighting wizards.

10
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:56,708
I should have known my
magic wasn't enough.

11
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:00,125
I was too proud to admit
we were out of our league.

12
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:03,375
I chose to stay and fight.

13
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:06,500
And now my friends
are badly hurt.

14
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,708
I wish I were stronger.

15
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,083
[gasps]

16
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,291
[MAVIS]
Ah!

17
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,791
I'm-- I'm so sorry!

18
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,541
I thought that I was
the only one here!

19
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,166
It's time to get out
of the forest now.

20
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:44,958
[MAVIS]
Huh?

21
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:48,500
[splashing]

22
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:49,875
[ZEREF]
Sorry.

23
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,208
That didn't come out
like it should have.

24
00:03:57,166 --> 00:04:00,708
I meant to say it's time for
me to get out of the forest.

25
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,541
But why?

26
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,250
[gasps]

27
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,375
What's happening to the trees?

28
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,583
This is the fate of every
living thing that I encounter.

29
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,333
They all die.

30
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,708
You killed the forest?

31
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:35,500
It isn't safe for you
to be near me.

32
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,500
So this is Ankhselam
black magic.

33
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,541
[MAVIS] I've only read
about it in books.

34
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:47,333
It's a kind of ancient curse.

35
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:50,958
Some people call it the
"Curse of Contradiction."

36
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,500
The greater the
compassion you have

37
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,833
for the living
beings around you,

38
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:58,000
the more potent your
release of death energy.

39
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:02,166
Conversely, if you have no
regard at all for living things,

40
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,666
then you'll release no death
energy into the environment.

41
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,125
[MAVIS]
Oh, I'm sorry.

42
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,916
I'm sure you already
know all that.

43
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,041
It's okay. Your
knowledge is impressive.

44
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,458
You're the only person I've ever
met who understands my curse.

45
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,791
I usually avoid
people at all costs.

46
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,958
I won't risk their lives for
the sake of my loneliness.

47
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,041
Do you live in this forest?

48
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,750
[ZEREF]
No, I try to keep moving.

49
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,916
I want as little contact with
living things as possible.

50
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,375
The less I interact
with them, the better.

51
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,458
Living this way is awful.

52
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,416
It's difficult not to
feel like a villain

53
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,041
when everything I touch dies.

54
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,000
It's very kind of you to
stay and talk with me,

55
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,166
but I don't want
to make you sad.

56
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,875
[MAVIS] I'm sure it
must get lonely for you.

57
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,666
Yes, it can be trying.

58
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,583
Though conversing with
you has made me happier

59
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,083
than I've been in a while.

60
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:00,416
I can't remember the last time
I spoke with anybody.

61
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,458
But at the same time,
I can't ignore the fact

62
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,666
that simply being in my
presence is dangerous

63
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,750
and the last thing I want
to do is bring you any harm.

64
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,875
I've never wanted to kill
anything in my life.

65
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,458
I should leave you be.

66
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:22,041
It was never my intention
to frighten you.

67
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,250
What are you doing?

68
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,458
Please stay away from me,
for your own sake!

69
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,583
What is all this?

70
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:51,000
How can they get so close
without succumbing to my curse?

71
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:54,000
They all have an
immunity to such things.

72
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,958
What?

73
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,916
This is my magic.

74
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,291
They're incredible.

75
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,625
You can't actually touch them,
though I wish that you could.

76
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,875
It's fine. I can
feel their warmth.

77
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,500
Thank you very much.

78
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,083
[MAVIS] Maybe fate brought you
and me together here today.

79
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:21,125
Perhaps we were
supposed to meet.

80
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:25,333
You are a powerful wizard.
That's quite easy to see.

81
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,000
I'd like you to help us.

82
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:32,208
Please teach my friends
and me how to use magic.

83
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,000
We have a battle to fight.

84
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:37,416
Right now, we're not strong
enough to beat our opponents.

85
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,333
[ZERA]
Uhh...

86
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,875
Who is this guy?

87
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,375
[MAVIS chuckles]

88
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,125
[gasps]

89
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,458
[MAVIS chuckles]

90
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,791
I don't understand why we
have to meditate so much.

91
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,666
What does that have to do
with magic training?

92
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,666
It's important for building
a good, strong foundation.

93
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,083
The power to use magic must come
both from within and without.

94
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,916
[WARROD]
You're too far away!

95
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,166
[MAVIS] We can't get any
closer to him than this.

96
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,500
Spells are the concentration
and physical release

97
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,250
of the magic power
that we possess,

98
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,416
stored within our bodies.

99
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,083
I got a feeling I don't
have any of that

100
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,875
magical energy junk in me.

101
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,125
Perhaps you don't.

102
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,833
But once you understand
how magic power works,

103
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,666
you'll see that isn't
really a problem.

104
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,500
Let me break it down for you.

105
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,750
Magic power is as vital to a
wizard as the air he breathes.

106
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,750
Without it, we can't
do much at all.

107
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,208
The base substance upon
which magic power is built

108
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,416
is called "ether-nano."

109
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,791
[MAVIS]
Ether-nano?

110
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,041
[ZEREF]
Yes.

111
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,500
It can be found in the
atmosphere around us,

112
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,791
and we have the ability to
absorb it into our bodies.

113
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,750
The next part requires
intense focus,

114
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,458
transforming ether-nano
into magic power.

115
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,916
Meditation is the best way
to draw in ether-nano,

116
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,166
so that's why it's
part of our training.

117
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,833
Did you know any of that?

118
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,541
I've read about some of it
in books, but that's all.

119
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,500
Teacher! I have a question.

120
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,625
You don't have to
raise your hand

121
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,958
like we're students
in a schoolhouse.

122
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,333
Precht is the scariest-looking
student I've ever seen,

123
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,791
especially with that eye patch.

124
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:47,416
[PRECHT grumbles]

125
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,333
[WARROD chuckles]

126
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,166
I understand the concept
that ether-nano

127
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,208
is the source of a
wizards' magic power.

128
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,041
But does it follow that
if we absorb more of it

129
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,375
from the atmosphere,

130
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,500
then we'll be able to use
more powerful spells?

131
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,208
That's a great question.

132
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,666
Every wizard has a "vessel,"

133
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,666
a limit to their capacity
for magic power

134
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,541
and the amount of ether-nano
they can absorb.

135
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,958
When you use a lot of magic,
you empty your vessel,

136
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,958
but your body continues to draw
in ether-nano on its own.

137
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,666
In a relatively short time,
your vessel will be replenished

138
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,083
and you'll be able
to use spells again

139
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,166
without having to do
anything at all.

140
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,083
Not even meditate.

141
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,583
In short, there's no limit

142
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,708
to the amount of ether-nano
in the atmosphere.

143
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,125
That's the best news
we've had yet!

144
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:33,333
There's one other very important
element to using magic, though.

145
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,375
[MAVIS]
Oh, really? What is it?

146
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,208
To truly be effective,

147
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,375
it requires more than
absorbing ether-nano

148
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,250
and converting
it into magic power.

149
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,208
There is something else that
you must add to that equation.

150
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,666
It's vital.

151
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:53,291
I'm referring to the great
power of a wizard's feelings.

152
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,333
The power of feelings?

153
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,500
Yes.

154
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,458
It's almost impossible
to use magic well

155
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,666
without feeding off of
our strongest emotions,

156
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,458
so we've got to be
able to access them.

157
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,708
Looks like we've let the
time get away from us.

158
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,541
I think it would be best
if we call it a night

159
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,958
and begin practical
training in the morning.

160
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,166
Good night.

161
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,166
You have a good night, too.

162
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,833
Well, I have always
wondered how magic worked.

163
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:25,208
Who is he? And where
did he come from?

164
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,833
Like I said, meditation
is the most efficient way

165
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,791
to absorb ether-nano.

166
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,583
[ZERA, MAVIS gasp]

167
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,166
He's really doing it!

168
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,791
[YURI]
That's amazing!

169
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,541
[PRECHT]
Huh? So, it works.

170
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,750
Well, Precht, it would appear

171
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,416
that you were destined
to be a wizard.

172
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,500
I won't be beat!

173
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah, neither will I!

174
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,125
Let's all try our best!

175
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,583
Yuri, don't you think it's
time to call it a night?

176
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,583
Would you please
stop bothering me?

177
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,583
I'm trying to
meditate over here.

178
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,916
It'll never happen if you
keep trying to force it.

179
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,625
Just open your mind
and let it flow into you.

180
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:44,000
Screw this! I'm going crazy!

181
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,375
Sittin' still just
ain't my style!

182
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,541
But it only works
if you stay still.

183
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,583
Not for me. I think
I'm an exception.

184
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,833
I'm hyper, so I can
only really focus

185
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,708
when I'm moving around a lot!

186
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:00,666
Huh. I guess that
is a possibility.

187
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,000
Aw, yeah!

188
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,375
[laughs]

189
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:09,041
Check it out, you guys!
I'm absorbing it!

190
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,125
That's great...

191
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,958
[PRECHT]
Just shut up and go to sleep.

192
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,541
Do you see it? Look at it!
It's so pretty, right?

193
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,750
Man, I'm glowin' like a firefly!

194
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:20,041
I'm a wizard! I'm a
real life magic guy!

195
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,916
[PRECHT]
Feelings. Right.

196
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:55,208
[MAVIS]
Focus my feelings.

197
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,750
That's the part that
I've already mastered.

198
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:04,291
[MAVIS]
I just need to go deeper.

199
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,458
[MAVIS]
It's harder than it looks.

200
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,541
How are you doing over there?

201
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:16,625
[ZERA]
Hm?

202
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:17,791
Hey, stop that!

203
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:21,125
Don't watch me!
It blows my concentration!

204
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,583
[gasps]

205
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,666
That's wonderful, Zera!

206
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,291
Can you believe it's working?

207
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,208
Yeah, I'm proud of you!

208
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,208
[growls]

209
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:55,041
I guess I'm just
not focused enough.

210
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,625
[WARROD]
Tch.

211
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:05,791
[grumbles]

212
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,250
I've always wanted to
train under a waterfall!

213
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,291
All right! I'll get more
ether-nano than those guys!

214
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,583
They're gonna wish
they had my power!

215
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,333
I want all of it!

216
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,000
[screams]

217
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,666
Uh. Maybe that's too much.

218
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,916
[WARROD grunting]

219
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:04,750
[chuckles]

220
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:21,875
[YURI chuckles]

221
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,166
[MAVIS chuckles]

222
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:15,166
[yells]

223
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,750
[YURI]
All right!

224
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,208
Hey, Precht. Your magic is
really somethin' else, man!

225
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,791
I saw you training earlier
and it blew my mind!

226
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,041
Well, I wish you would
train farther away from me.

227
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,500
Your lightning's
very distracting.

228
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,083
Yeah? You saw it?

229
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,875
My magic's pretty
awesome too, huh?

230
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,458
Stop talking and start the fire.

231
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:43,291
[YURI chuckles]

232
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,833
I know you were impressed.

233
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:48,791
Well, how about you, Warrod?
How's your training been going?

234
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,458
[WARROD]
It's goin' all right.

235
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,458
So we're all kickin' butt.

236
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:59,166
[WARROD] We need some more
firewood. I'll go gather it.

237
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,083
Yeah, you're right.
I'd appreciate it, pal.

238
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,333
Stupid magic.

239
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,000
Oh, thanks, but I
don't need any help.

240
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,333
Come on, Warrod,

241
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,375
you know that branches
pulled right off the tree

242
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,791
are too damp to
use for firewood.

243
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,291
I'll help you gather these dry
ones here on the ground.

244
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,750
I don't get why it always
has to be this way.

245
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,083
I can never keep up.

246
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,541
Those guys beat me every time.

247
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,333
When we try new things, even if
none of us have done it before,

248
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,166
they catch on and surpass me.

249
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,166
And now I'm holding
them back again.

250
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,000
But you don't hold them back.

251
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,250
They were just
saying the opposite

252
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,166
a little while ago, actually.

253
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,000
Were they really?

254
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,375
Yes, sir.

255
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,166
Nice!

256
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,250
Hey, you've been going
at your training nonstop

257
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,333
and I just wanna make sure

258
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,083
you're not pushing
yourself too hard!

259
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:01,458
I never wanna feel the way
I did back in Magnolia.

260
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,666
None of us want that.

261
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,375
And that's the whole
reason we learned magic

262
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:05,791
in the first place.

263
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,500
That's not it.

264
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:10,625
I mean, I don't want Warrod
to rescue me anymore.

265
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,416
[YURI]
He's always been the hero.

266
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,708
Whenever I do something reckless
and get us into trouble,

267
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,500
Warrod steps in to save the day.

268
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,625
Without him, I'd have kicked
the bucket a long time ago,

269
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,375
and I wanna give
the guy a break.

270
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,208
[PRECHT]
That's the truth of the matter.

271
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:28,375
We are deeply indebted to him.

272
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,375
He's been good to us
for all these years.

273
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,833
I've been tryin' to find a way
to repay him for a while.

274
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,541
Maybe now we finally
have a chance to do it

275
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,916
by protecting him for once!

276
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,291
Protecting me? They said that?

277
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:42,125
Of course they did.
They're your friends, right?

278
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:45,208
And remember the last thing
we learned about using magic?

279
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,125
Yeah. To use our feelings.

280
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:52,875
That's right! Our spells
won't even work without them!

281
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:58,875
So let's join the others.
I'm getting hungry!

282
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:10,458
I don't think my magic is meant
to create powerful attacks.

283
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,833
That being said,
I wanna be an asset.

284
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,333
Will you teach me
spells I can use

285
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,125
to support my friends in battle?

286
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,541
Very well.

287
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,750
There's a kind of magic
that suits you better.

288
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,166
One that matches the
color of your soul.

289
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,750
It has a color? Really?

290
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,541
Now that's more like it!

291
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:34,791
[chuckles]

292
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:41,208
[laughs]

293
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,458
[rumbling]

294
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:45,916
Whoa! What is that?

295
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,541
Huh? I have no idea!

296
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,500
Now what's goin' on?

297
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:55,250
Do you think Warrod's doing
that? Is this his magic?

298
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,708
Well, who else could it be?

299
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,708
Makes sense, right?
It's just like him.

300
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,500
[laughing]

301
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,833
[WARROD]
What an amazing feeling!

302
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,500
Aww. I'm the only one
who hasn't gotten it yet.

303
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,041
It'll happen soon, don't be sad.

304
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,666
It isn't exactly
that I feel sad.

305
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,791
I'd just hoped to find a
special magic of my own

306
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:26,000
that had the power to protect
those I care about most.

307
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,916
[ZERA]
Ugh! What are you doing?

308
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,083
We're trying to have an
important conversation here!

309
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:44,083
This is awesome! My whole body's
pulsing with magic power!

310
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,458
Mine, too! I think
we're finally ready.

311
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,958
[PRECHT]
Now we can fight.

312
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,375
So what do you all think?

313
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,083
I'm the black wizard Mavis!

314
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,125
You like my new look?

315
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,416
You're getting into this.

316
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,625
I am!

317
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,500
Hey, wait. Where did
our magic teacher go?

318
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,708
Huh. I haven't seen him,
now that you mention it.

319
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,458
When's the last time
you guys did?

320
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:05,375
I dunno.

321
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,958
It's been a while.

322
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,166
[YURI] That's weird.
I wonder where he went.

323
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,916
[ZEREF] I suppose I
should've said goodbye

324
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,833
after all the time
we spent together.

325
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,041
It's odd for me to
have done what I did.

326
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:19,333
To teach others to use magic,
to befriend a young girl.

327
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:20,958
I'm not sure why.

328
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:26,458
In any case, I'll never
forget my time with them.

329
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:29,000
And I'll treasure that
respite from my loneliness,

330
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,625
however brief it was, Mavis.

331
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:32,916
Fairy Tail would be born

332
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,500
just ten short days
after I left them.

333
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:37,875
I played a large part
in its formation.

334
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:41,708
Perhaps I was the reason she met
such a tragic end, after all.

335
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:14,791
[MAVIS]
It's time to strike back.

336
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:17,708
My friends and I return to set
the city of Magnolia free

337
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:20,041
from Blue Skull's evil grasp.

338
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,041
Newly empowered by their
individual brands of magic,

339
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:26,666
Yuri, Precht, and Warrod
unleash a fierce onslaught,

340
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,000
while my newfound
"Fairy Tactician" strategy

341
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:31,083
aids in the fight.

342
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:32,916
In spite of all that we learned,

343
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,791
the battle takes
a turn that none of us

344
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:37,083
could've ever predicted.

345
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:39,166
Next Time: "Treasure."

346
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,833
Some things must never be lost.
