00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:23,357
[LUCY] It's been a busy five
days since Fairy Tail's rebirth.

2
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,570
It feels so good to be back
in my old place again!

3
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:31,073
I can't believe the
landlady had it open.

4
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,824
I could've moved into
the dorm with the girls,

5
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,826
or some other place, I guess.

00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,621

the comforts of home,

kinda starting to feel normal.

10

It's crazy to think
how much damage

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,672
the battle with Tartaros did.

12
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,674
The town was nearly destroyed.

13
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,259
But since the guild
was founded here

14

history with Magnolia,

15
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,556
everyone's welcomed us
back with open arms.

16
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,475

Aw, stop your gripin'.

37
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,643
Since we're a guild again,
we need a guild hall.

38
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,770
Therefore, we're all
rebuilding that,

and our teamwork skills.

I'd like for Master

once he finally returns.

42

Me, too. But is he
really coming back?

43
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,074
I'd bet my last jewel on it.

44
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,993
We'll wait, but Al and I
can track him if need be.

45
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,036
A bounty could work.

He's not a criminal!
And that's so cheap!

How 'bout handin'

Of course! Here ya go, dear!

[JET]
You hear about them?

52
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,759
They've been shacked
up this last year.

53
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,762
Well, what I heard is
they actually tied the knot.

54
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,723
And their union bore fruit!

55
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,558
I know, but what's even
more shocking to me

56
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,476
is that Lucy is his mistress!

No way!

Would you stop with all
those crazy stories?!

60
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,735
Besides, I'd describe it less
of a "shacking up" situation

61
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:55,944

It's because Mira and
I spent the last year

00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,180
working at a
restaurant together!

working on over there?

Ugh. Filling out
lots of paperwork.

86

We can't just say we're a guild.

87
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,877
There's actually quite a bit
of documentation involved.

88
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,629
Without approval
from the council,

89
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,881
we'd be considered a dark guild.

90

That's true. And it's another
reason why we joined them.

91
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:01,885
We could learn the process

92
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,054
and make a couple of
friends on the inside.

And once this stuff is done,

we'll be able to tell the world
Fairy Tail is officially back!

Why's it hard?

Because we all need
to make a decision

about who our seventh
guild master will be.

It's a temporary measure
until our sixth master returns.

00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:52,889
[FAIRY TAIL gasping]

167
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,058
[FAIRY TAIL]
Yes, ma'am.

168
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,935
[BOTH whimper]

169
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,728
[chuckles]

170
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,273
Well, that makes things
so much easier.

171
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:06,820
Our seventh guild master
will be... Erza Scarlet!

172
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,406
[FAIRY TAIL cheering]

173
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,491
Wait! Slow down, please!

174
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,243
Naming me as guild master?

175
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,577
I'm flattered, you guys, but‐‐

176
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:18,707
[MEST] You are the most
suited for the task.

177
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,333
Whoa! It's that guy!

178
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,419
Yeah, uh. That guy.

179
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,920
He seems familiar.

180
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:28,591
He does. I know he was
in the guild, but still...

181
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,593
Something's different.

182
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,013
And I can't remember his name...

183
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,390
[MEST] I've been waiting
for this moment.

184
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:39,602
I knew it would come and
we'd be together again.

185
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,855
Master Makarov is in trouble,

186
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,482
and you're the only
ones who can help him.

187
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,901
At least, I hope that's true.

188
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:00,540
[ERZA] I had no idea all of
this was under the guild hall.

189
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:03,793
[MEST] Yes. That's completely
by design, of course.

190
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,963
Tell me Doran‐‐or, Mest, rather.

191
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,090
Mest is my real identity.

192
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,801
Your memory is
likely still hazy.

193
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,137
That would be my fault.

194
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,057
Why didn't you let anybody
else come with us?

195
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,934
Definitely ruffled
Natsu's feathers.

196
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,146
[MEST] This is a sacred and
restricted place we've come to.

197
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:27,025
In fact, only guild masters are
supposed to know about it.

198
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:32,489
These are strange times.
That's the only reason I'm here.

199
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,037
[ERZA]
What is that?

200
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:45,502
[MEST] Fairy Tail's ultimate
secret, the Lumen Histoire.

201
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,961
[ERZA]
Master Mavis?

202
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,213
[NATSU]
Cut it out!

203
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,756
‐‐[GRAY] Stop pushing, ya dope!
‐‐[LUCY] Watch the hands!

204
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:50,965
[NATSU yells]

205
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,885
[ALL groaning]

206
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,553
Hey there.

207
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,805
What are you doing?

208
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,431
Seriously?

209
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,059
I literally said "only guild
masters were allowed."

210
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,479
It's very important that
we maintain its sanctity.

211
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,190
[NATSU] Whatever, we're
part of the guild, too!

212
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,775
[GRAY]
What is this anyway?

213
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,693
[WENDY] That's our
first master, isn't it?

214
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,195
[NATSU]
She's butt naked!

215
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,823
[LUCY] Yeah, so give her
some privacy, you creep!

216
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,325
Is that the first
master's body in there?

217
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,119
Is she still alive?

218
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,870
I don't understand this.

219
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,206
Why is she kept
inside that crystal?

220
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:27,001
What's going on here,
Mest? Explain.

221
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,004
I can't claim that I
understand it, either.

222
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,714
All I can say is
that it's something

223
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,175
extraordinarily important.

224
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,344
[NATSU] Aw, forget
about her right now!

225
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,887
Where is Gramps?!

226
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,889
"Forget about her"?

227
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,141
[BOTH gasp]

228
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:47,772
That's weird. It's like...
I can see something

229
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,899
What is this?

230
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,402
You're seeing my memories.

231
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,363
Beginning ten years ago.

232
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,448
You want me to
infiltrate the Council?

233
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,702
[MAKAROV] Yes. Because
you're the only one who can.

234
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,079
[MEST] So, what do
you want me to steal?

235
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,082
I'm not asking you
to steal something.

236
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,626
You'll be gathering their intel
on the western continent

237
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,420
and passing it to me.

238
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,131
[MEST] Yeah, that sounds
a lot like stealing.

239
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,509
Forget about covering up for
any of our prior "incidents."

240
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,635
Understood?

241
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,262
All I want is
everything they have

242
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:22,891
regarding the western
continent and nothing else.

243
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,143
May I ask why?

244
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,729
It's better that you
don't know the specifics.

245
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,941
But trust me, it's for
the safety of our family.

246
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,319
I won't fail you, I promise!

247
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,528
Here's an idea!

248
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,864
Oh, yeah! I'll erase
my own memory!

249
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,283
[MAKAROV]
That won't be necessary!

250
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,328
[MEST]
Since there's no real diplomacy

251
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,704
between the two continents,

252
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,624
I haven't been able to dig
up much info so far.

253
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,375
[MAKAROV]
I see.

254
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,835
But everyone here
has been very eager

255
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,296
to share their opinions
on Fairy Tail.

256
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,505
They hate us.

257
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,799
Yep. No surprise there.

258
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,968
Have you considered
reining in Natsu a bit?

259
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,429
Natsu's fine just
the way he is.

260
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,805
Are you sure?

261
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,724
[MAKAROV]
He's not the only reckless one.

262
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,143
After all, you volunteered
to erase your memory

263
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,603
to go undercover.

264
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:09,646
Yes, I did.

265
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,315
But you can lift and reinstate
the spell whenever you need to,

266
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:13,524
so I'll be fine.

267
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,443
You're certainly clever, Mest.

268
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,694
No doubt.

269
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,904
Thank you.

270
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:21,991
But while I'm still undercover I
need you to call me "Doranbolt."

271
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,496
[LAHAR]
Doranbolt,

272
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,456
there's someone here to see you.

273
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:29,832
[MEST]
A visitor?

274
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,084
Hello, sir.

275
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,419
May I ask what business
the master of Fairy Tail

276
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,963
has with me?

277
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,258
And by the way, did you visit
me last month as well?

278
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,469
[MAKAROV]
Ugh, this is such a pain.

279
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:44,222
[LAHAR]
Hey, Doranbolt. Makarov is here.

280
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,933
I wonder why Fairy Tail's
master would wana see me...

281
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,269
He visits quite often.

282
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,937
This gives me an idea.

283
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,230
Well, what is it?

284
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,941
I could use my memory
control magic to go undercover

285
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,735
inside that notorious
guild of troublemakers.

286
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,736
Okay.

287
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,614
[MEST] We'd surely get some
actionable intel that way.

288
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,408
We could, hopefully.

289
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,451
The first step is
planting a memory.

290
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,997
I can fool Makarov into thinking
that I'm a member of the guild.

291
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,707
I'll say my name is Mest.

292
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,750
That's a strange code name.

293
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,752
Oh, yeah! That's it!

294
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,588
I wanna know all of
Fairy Tail's dirty secrets!

295
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,674
Please stop.

296
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,135
And I'm guessing that was
how you wormed your way

297
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,304
into the S‐Class trial
on Tenrou Island,

298
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,264
before you ditched us there.

299
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,515
[GRAY, NATSU]
Not cool.

300
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,184
I'm deeply sorry about all that.

301
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:30,977
[ERZA]
Then what?

302
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,896
As you know,
seven years passed by.

303
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,568
It's been quite a while.

304
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,237
I'm so relieved to see you.

305
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,324
You're alive. Everybody's okay.

306
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,450
I must apologize;

307
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,161
I had no idea the mission
would last so long.

308
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,414
It's okay. I knew
the risks going in.

309
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:54,417
Look, Mest, it's all over now.

310
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,211
Come back to the guild.
You have a home with us.

311
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,421
[MEST]
Not yet.

312
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:02,008
After all these years,
I can't give up. I'm close.

313
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,302
The intel we've been looking
for is within reach.

314
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,678
[MAKAROV]
Huh?

315
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,767
[MEST]
But then, one year ago,

316
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,895
after the final battle
with Tartaros...

317
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,397
[MAKAROV]
Fairy Tail will not rebuild.

318
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,191
I'm disbanding it.

319
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,776
[MEST]
Huh?

320
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,652
[MAKAROV] Based on the
information you obtained

321
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,905
and my own personal
investigation,

322
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:27,325
I've come to realize this is
the only way we can survive.

323
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,410
It's to protect my children.

324
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,204
So all the work we've
done convinced you

325
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,872
to break up the guild?

326
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,582
It doesn't make any sense!

327
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,168
[MAKAROV] Whether you
agree with me or not,

328
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,712
the Alvarez Empire on
the western continent

329
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,714
is just too dangerous.

330
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,258
They pose a mortal
threat to us all.

331
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,719
Why are you so afraid of them?

332
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,262
The only noteworthy
thing they've ever done

333
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:52,141
is stage a failed invasion
of Ishgar over a decade ago!

334
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:55,061
Do you happen to know the
motive behind that invasion?

335
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,396
No.

336
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,856
[MAKAROV] They were after
the Lumen Histoire.

337
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,900
They traveled halfway
across Earthland

338
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:03,403
to obtain our most
sacred treasure.

339
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,989
I assume you don't
know how that ended.

340
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,991
The invasion didn't fail.

341
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,869
It was abandoned after the
Council flexed its muscles

342
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,038
in the form of a
terrifying weapon.

343
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,124
[MEST]
The Etherion.

344
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,168
We just learned about the
magic‐nullifying system, FACE.

345
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,963
This, too, was a major part
of the Council's arsenal.

346
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:25,258
Alvarez simply could not
afford the risk involved.

347
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,677
However, those council
members have been wiped out,

348
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,221
and both the Etherion Cannon
and the FACE system

349
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,681
have been destroyed.

350
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,016
So what does that all mean?

351
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,979
It means Ishgar has lost every
tool we had to deter Alvarez.

352
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,772
[MAKAROV]
Mm‐hm.

353
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:43,359
There's no doubt in my mind
they will invade again.

354
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,527
[MEST]
I still don't understand

355
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,654
why we would have to
break up the guild.

356
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,739
Someone hits us, we hit back!

357
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,575
That's the Fairy
Tail way, right?

358
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,493
[MAKAROV] The only viable
option we have now

359
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,120
is to disband the guild.

360
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,371
Why?

361
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:58,583
[MAKAROV] Including Fairy Tail,
the continent of Ishgar is home

362
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,294
to 500 wizard guilds,
give or take.

363
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,670
However, at its peak,

364
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,715
the western continent
had around 730.

365
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:09,177
That's counting official,
legal guilds and dark guilds.

366
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,804
But the Alvarez Magic Empire
was able to unite

367
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:14,557
all of those disparate
groups under one banner.

368
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:17,852
And now they possess a
military power without equal.

369
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,688
We'd have no chance
of stopping them.

370
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,315
[gasps]

371
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,358
Although it's true
that our ragtag guild

372
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,403
has bested many powerful
enemies over the years,

373
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:28,779
this is quite different.

374
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,866
No one we've faced has been
even close to this level.

375
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,619
Master! What can we do?

376
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,662
[MAKAROV]
I'm going to the Alvarez Empire

377
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,707
to negotiate with them.

378
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,959
If I can't dissuade
them from invading,

379
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,377
I'll buy us some extra time

380
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,255
by threatening to activate
the Lumen Histoire.

381
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,257
They understand its power.

382
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,009
[MEST]
Are you serious?

383
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:52,637
Admittedly,
my chances are slim,

384
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,556
but they'd be better if you
could rebuild the Magic Council.

385
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,351
Wait! There has to
be some other way!

386
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,520
[MAKAROV] I fear that if
something were to happen to me

387
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,855
while Fairy Tail still existed,

388
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,441
my children would
be the next targets.

389
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,693
I cannot put them in harm's way!

390
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,403
I've no choice!

391
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,739
I'm willing to forfeit
our standing.

392
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,908
Throw away our glory.

393
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:18,496
If that can guarantee the safety
of our family, so be it!

394
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:22,500
[MEST] Master, please
think this through.

395
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:26,420
Because trying to hold back
an entire nation by yourself...

396
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,423
This is a suicide mission!

397
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:33,010
I'm carrying the lives of
my children on my shoulders!

398
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,806
And that is what it
means to be a parent.

399
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,102
[NATSU]
Okay!

400
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,355
So Gramps went over to deal
with this empire or whatever

401
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,315
and he never came back?

402
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,317
He wanted to protect us.

403
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,571
Disbanding the guild was
the only way he could.

404
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,824
One whole year... and
not a word from him.

405
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:55,616
Nothing.

406
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,535
[HAPPY]
Why didn't you try to stop him?

407
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,871
You do know Master Makarov
is impossibly hard‐headed.

408
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,040
What could Mest have done?

409
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,667
Do you think he's okay?

410
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,669
I don't know what to think.

411
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,380
Hopefully, he's still
in negotiations.

412
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:13,968
But they could have
imprisoned him. Or worse.

413
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,929
[ERZA]
My heart tells me he's alive!

414
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,889
So what'd you do?

415
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,559
I started following
Mokarov's plan.

416
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,854
And I got to work on re‐forming
the Magic Council.

417
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,898
With some help from Warrod,
I assembled a new council.

418
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,943
This one including the Wizard
Saints as core members.

419
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:34,113
We'd talked about this
back at Lamia Scale.

420
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,865
I knew the council had
been looking for him,

421
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,909
but Lyon just said they
were concerned.

422
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,412
[MEST] Warrod does know
how grave the situation is,

423
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,290
but I'm not so sure
about the others.

424
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,500
Regardless, the entire
council agrees

425
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,837
that Alvarez poses a
threat to all of us.

426
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,131
They were able to establish
a line of defense,

427
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:55,593
and it seems to have deterred
any invasion or attack so far.

428
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,928
That tells me Gramps managed
to buy us some time,

429
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,180
just like he said.

430
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,807
Ya know? So why the hell
isn't he back yet?

431
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,893
[MEST]
I can't say for sure.

432
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:08,397
Word travels slowly. He may not
know the new Council exists.

433
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:11,817
Or perhaps they're
keeping him there.

434
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:15,821
You realize we gotta
go save him. Don't ya?

435
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,073
I know.

436
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,824
I did as he said up till now

437
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,826
and got the Council
back and running.

438
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,411
But I'm in Fairy Tail,

439
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:25,289
so it's time I start to
break the rules a little.

440
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,083
[HAPPY] Now that we have
the guild back together,

441
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,418
no one's gonna stand in our way.

442
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,544
Am I right?

443
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,797
We'll bring him back home!

444
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,007
Hold on!

445
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:38,803
Remember what Master told him,
this is an unbeatable enemy.

446
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,180
We can't act on impulse.

447
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,058
Erza.

448
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,602
We've gotten way stronger
over the last year!

449
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,854
Do you really believe that
these jerks can beat us?

450
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,649
Master risked his life
and legacy to save ours.

451
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,359
He sacrificed everything.

452
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:55,403
We must honor his gift.

453
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,949
[ERZA] We'll do that by
rebuilding the guild hall,

454
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:04,662
taking jobs again, and restoring
Fairy Tail to its former glory.

455
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,664
We're finally reunited.

456
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,709
We need to enjoy this moment
of happiness together.

457
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:14,046
As the new master, these
are my top priorities.

458
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,634
We're not going?

459
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,678
Really? Come on!

460
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,221
[ERZA]
However,

461
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:25,391
my feelings as a fellow member
of the guild are different.

462
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,977
We have no other choice
but to bring Makarov home,

463
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,312
and quickly.

464
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:35,651
Which means... only those in
this room will join the mission.

465
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,695
A small team works best.

466
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:41,323
We'll infiltrate Alvarez,
rescue our master,

467
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,243
and make our escape.

468
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,579
This will not be
an all‐out war.

469
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,665
Hear me? We need focus.

470
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:53,043
That means we won't be starting
any unnecessary fights.

471
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,921
Am I clear?

472
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,132
Yeah, sure.

473
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,633
Let's do it you guys!

474
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,761
Gramps is counting on us!

475
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:06,432
Ha. Beat us to the punch.

476
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,184
What are you talking about?

477
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,145
They're gonna go with a
small team invasion strategy?

478
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,980
Alrighty then.

479
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:16,025
So we'll have to give a
different approach a try.

480
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,318
Hey, Cana.

481
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,779
Do you happen to know
where Gray wandered off to?

482
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,823
I drank that cool drink
right up! And it was good!

483
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,909
How could you do such a thing?!

484
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,161
Are you in there?!
Answer me, Gray!

485
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,871
[MIRAJANE]
If you're looking for Gray,

486
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:32,792
I saw him following Erza
and Mest a while ago.

487
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,668
I think he was with
Natsu and Lucy.

488
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,544
[JUVIA]
What?

489
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,547
Did you say Lucy, too?

490
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,549
[GRAY]
My, where could everybody be?

491
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:43,761
[LUCY] Who cares? All that
matters is you're here.

492
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:44,845
[LUCY, GRAY gasp]

493
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,347
[GRAY]
Lucy.

494
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,431
[LUCY]
Gray.

495
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,183
[GRAY]
Oh!

496
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,435
[groans]

497
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:52,853
That kinda hurt.

498
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,815
Hey there. You wanna
take a little tipple?

499
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,025
I'm gonna put the
B Team back together.

500
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,443
The B Team?

501
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,779
Like our team from
the Grand Magic Games?

502
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,615
We're gonna look for
ol' blond lightning, too.

503
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:05,324
[JUVIA]
Hm?

504
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:07,535
Wait, lightning? Where?

505
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,119
What are you talking about?

506
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,206
Gajeel, do you know
where Laxus is?

507
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,707
[chuckles]

508
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:48,427
[LUCY] Master Makarov is being
held inside the Alvarez Empire,

509
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,679
and it's up to us to
get him outta there.

510
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,307
We're gonna need a
foolproof plan to save him.

511
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:55,100
So it's off to the
western continent,

512
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,561
where the mysterious
empire is headquartered.

513
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:01,231
But first, we'll need to make a
little stop on Caracol Island.

514
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,442
Instead of getting our
second wind, though,

515
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:06,195
we run into an
explosive situation!

516
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:08,656
Next Time: "Law of Space."

517
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:12,451
He who controls space,
controls our progress.
