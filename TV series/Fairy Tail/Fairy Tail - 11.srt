00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,916
- Narrator: IN A
LAND FAR, FAR AWAY,

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,250
LIES THE KINGDOM OF FIORE,

3
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:26,166
A SMALL PEACEFUL NATION
OF 17,000,000

4
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,791
AND A PLACE FILLED
WITH MAGIC.

5
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,208
FOUND IN EVERY HOME,

6
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,916
BOUGHT AND SOLD IN 
EVERY MARKETPLACE,

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,416
FOR MOST,
MAGIC IS MERELY A TOOL,

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,000
A MUNDANE PART OF
EVERYDAY LIFE.

9
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,291
FOR SOME, HOWEVER,
MAGIC IS AN ART.

10
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:42,333
AND THEY'VE DEVOTED
THEIR LIVES TO IT'S PRACTICE.

11
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:44,708
THESE ARE THE WIZARDS.

12
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,916
BANDED TOGETHER
INTO MAGICAL GUILDS,

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,958
THEY PLY THEIR SKILLS
IN SEARCH OF FAME AND FORTUNE.

14
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:54,500
MANY SUCH GUILDS
DOT THE LANDSCAPE OF FIORE,

15
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:57,291
BUT THERE IS A CERTAIN GUILD
IN A CERTAIN TOWN

16
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,625
THAT SOARS HIGH
ABOVE THE REST,

17
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:02,333
ONE FROM WHICH COUNTLESS
LEGENDS HAVE BEEN BORN--

18
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:05,666
A GUILD THAT WOULD NO DOUBT
CONTINUE TO CREATE LEGENDS 

19
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,416
WELL INTO THE FUTURE.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,041
ITS NAME IS FAIRY TAIL.

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,791

PREVIOUSLY ON "FAIRY TAIL..."

00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,666
- THEY'RE CALLED
S-CLASS QUESTS. 

33
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,708
MASTER HANDPICKS THE WIZARDS

34
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,291
HE THINKS CAN HANDLE THESE JOBS.

35
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,750
- IF ONLY NATSU AND I
WEREN'T RANKED SO LOW.

36
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,291
YOU GUYS STINK!

37
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,666
- ONE OF S-CLASS QUESTS
IS MISSING.

38
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,291
- OH! HOW DID YOU GET THAT?!

39
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,000
- S-CLASS,
WE'RE GOING BIG TIME.

40
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,666
- SAY WHAT? ONE OF THE JOBS

41
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,083
FROM THE SECOND FLOOR
IS MISSING?

42
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,250
- BUT THE JOBS UP THERE
ARE S-CLASS QUESTS.

43
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,083
ANYONE KNOW WHO
TOOK OFF WITH IT?

44
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,458
- WELL, IT'S EITHER SOMEONE
REALLY STRONG OR REALLY STUPID.

45
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,791
- I KNOW.
A LITTLE BLUE CAT

46
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,791
FLEW UP HERE AND RIPPED
IT OFF THE BOARD.

47
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,208
- IT WAS HAPPY?

48
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,750
- ( muttering )
- Wakaba: HE MUST HAVE STOLEN IT

49
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:19,875
FOR NATSU AND LUCY.
- Macao: THAT'S CRAZY.

50
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,166
WHAT ARE THEY THINKING?

51
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,333
- THEY'VE GOT SOME NERVE

52
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,083
TAKING ON AN S-CLASS QUEST.

53
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,291
- I DON'T KNOW
IF I'D CALL IT NERVE,

54
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,791
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY DUMB.

55
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,583
- THAT'S A SERIOUS
BREACH OF THE RULES.

56
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,541
HEY, GRAMPS,
A STUNT LIKE THAT'LL

57
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,958
GET YOU KICKED OUT THE GUILD,
AM I RIGHT?

58
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,708
NOT THAT IT MATTERS.
IT'S NOT LIKE THOSE THREE LOSERS

59
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,958
ARE GONNA MAKE IT BACK ALIVE
FROM AN S-CLASS QUEST.

60
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,791
- LAXUS, IF YOU KNEW,
WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP 'EM?

61
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,250
- OH, LIGHTEN UP.
ALL I SAW WAS A BLUE CAT

62
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,125
FLYING OFF WITH
A PIECE OF PAPER IN IT'S MOUTH,

63
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,958
TRYING TO ACT ALL SNEAKY.

64
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,041
I HAD NO IDEA IT WAS HAPPY.

65
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,458
BESIDES, NATSU'S
NOT CLEARED FOR S-CLASS.

66
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,458
I NEVER DREAMED
HE'D BREAK THE RULES.

67
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,375
( chuckles )

68
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,958
YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN ME 
THAT LOOK IN A WHILE.

69
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,833
- THIS ISN'T GOOD.

70
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,708
WELL, WHICH JOB WAS IT?

71
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,458
- FOR LIFTING THE CURSE
ON GALUNA ISLAND.

72
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:07,458
- WHAT?!

73
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:08,708
- GALUNA ISLAND?

74
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,125
- ARE THEY INSANE?

75
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,666
- THEY'RE EVEN DUMBER
THAN WE THOUGHT.

76
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,666
- LAXUS, GO AND FETCH
THEM AT ONCE.

77
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,708
- YEAH, RIGHT.  I GOT
BETTER THINGS TO DO, GRAMPS.

78
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,166
AND BESIDES,
EVERYBODY IN FAIRY TAIL

79
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,833
IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE
TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES.

80
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,916
RIGHT? - I DON'T CARE
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT NATSU.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,458
THE FACT IS YOU'RE THE
ONLY ONE STRONG ENOUGH

82
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,791
TO BRING HIM BACK BY FORCE.

83
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,750
- SORRY, MASTER.

84
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,500
BUT I'M AFRAID I GOT 
TO DISAGREE WITH YOU.

85
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,958
- Happy: THE CURSED ISLAND.

86
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:45,125
- Narrator: THE PICTURESQUE
PORT TOWN OF HARGEON.

87
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,541
- Lucy: WOW.
THIS BRINGS BACK MEMORIES.

88
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,041
IT SEEMS LIKE ONLY YESTERDAY

89
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,625
WHEN WE MET HERE
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

90
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,250
- IT PRACTICALLY WAS YESTERDAY.

91
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,666
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GET ALL MUSHY.

92
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,916
- YEAH, YOU SOUND
LIKE AN OLD LADY.

93
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,625
- WELL, LET'S GO FIND A BOAT

94
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,041
THAT'LL TAKE US TO GALUNA.
- ARE YOU CRAZY?!

95
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,416
FORGET THE BOAT.

96
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,833
WHY CAN'T WE
ALL JUST SWIM FOR IT?

97
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,958
- AND YOU THINK
I'M THE ONE WHO'S CRAZY?

98
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:10,583
- GALUNA ISLAND?  NO WAY.
NOT FOR A MILLION JEWEL.

99
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,208
- AROUND HERE, IT'S BAD LUCK
TO EVEN MENTION THAT NAME.

100
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,625
- SORRY, KIDS,
BUT I DON'T THINK

101
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,625
ANYONE HERE WOULD
BE WILLING TO TAKE YOU.

102
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,958
- THAT ISLAND'S CURSED,
SO UNLESS YOU GOT A DEATH WISH,

103
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,625
I'D STAY FAR AWAY.

104
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,333
- DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU'D WANT TO GO THERE,

105
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:23,791
BUT NO SAILOR
WORTH HIS SALT

106
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,291
IS GONNA TAKE YOU TO GALUNA.

107
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,291
NOT EVEN PIRATES WILL
GO NEAR THAT PLACE.

108
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,041
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA

109
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,750
BE SWIMMING, AFTER ALL.
- SURE DOES.

110
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,291
- WE'RE NOT SWIMMING, NATSU!

111
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,208
- I FOUND YOU.
- ( both screams )

112
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,375
- IT'S GRAY.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

113
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,250
- GRAMPS FOUND OUT ABOUT
YOUR HAREBRAINED SCHEME 

114
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,541
AND SENT ME TO BRING YOU BACK.
- WHY? WE'RE NOT IN DANGER YET.

115
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,250
IF YOU COME BACK NOW,
YOU MIGHT AVOID

116
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,625
BEING KICKED
OUT OF THE GUILD.

117
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,291
MAYBE.
- KICKED OUT?!

118
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,708
- I DON'T CARE.
I'M GOING ON THIS S-CLASS QUEST.

119
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,666
- MAN, YOU'RE WAY OUT
OF YOUR LEAGUE HERE. 

120
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,666
JUST COME HOME.

121
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,083
WHEN ERZA FINDS OUT ABOUT THIS,

122
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,500
SHE'S GONNA BE SO ANGRY.
- UH-OH.

123
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,458
- PLEASE, GRAY,
YOU GOT TO SAVE ME.

124
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:58,833
I TOLD THEM
THIS WAS A BAD IDEA,

125
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,541
BUT THEY FORCED ME
TO COME ALONG.

126
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,041
- YOU ARE SUCH A LIAR!

127
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,333
- I'VE GOT TO PROVE
MY POWER TO ERZA,

128
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,583
SO LIKE IT OR NOT,
I'M DOING THIS.

129
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,375
- MASTER ORDERED ME
TO BRING YOU HOME. 

130
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,625
I'LL DRAG YOU BACK
TO FAIRY TAIL IF I HAVE TO.

131
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,916
DON'T MAKE ME HURT YOU, BUDDY.

132
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,833
- I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY.

133
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,291
- HMM, MAGIC?

134
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,375
EXCUSE ME,
BUT ARE YOU WIZARDS?

135
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,791
- HMM? - HAVE YOU COME TO
LIFT THE CURSE ON THE ISLAND?

136
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,708
- YEAH.
- WELL, MAYBE.

137
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,000
- NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

138
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,666
- GET IN.
- WHAT?

139
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,000
- SERIOUSLY?
- NO WAY.

140
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,958
- THERE WE GO.
WE'RE READY WHEN YOU ARE, SIR.

141
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,708
- YOU SURE WE SHOULD
BRING HIM WITH US?

142
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,416
- WE CAN'T LET HIM GO BACK
AND TELL THE GUILD

143
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,500
BECAUSE THE NEXT PERSON
THEY'LL SEND IS ERZA.

144
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:41,791
- ( whimpers )

145
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,166
- LATER THAT DAY...

146
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,833
- ( gags )

147
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,416
- Lucy: OKAY, NOW I'M
STARTING TO GET SCARED.

148
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,541
- Gray: WELL, LOOK 
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

149
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,083
AT LEAST YOU'RE NOT TIED UP.

150
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,833
THIS IS YOUR FAULT TOO, BUDDY.

151
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,708
WHY'D YOU DECIDE
TO LET US ON?

152
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,250
- THE NAME IS BOBO.

153
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,583
AND IF YOU MUST KNOW, 
I USED TO BE A CITIZEN

154
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,041
OF GALUNA ISLAND.

155
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,791
BUT I HAD TO FLEE.

156
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,500
I JUST COULDN'T 
TAKE IT ANYMORE.

157
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,583
I SHOULD WARN YOU.

158
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:10,000
TRAGEDY BEFALLS ANYONE
WHO STEPS FOOT ON THE ISLAND.

159
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,625
THERE'S NO AVOIDING IT,

160
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,375
THAT IS, UNLESS YOU'RE ABLE
TO LIFT THE CURSE.

161
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:17,291
- ( gasps )

162
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:20,000
- THIS VILE DEMON'S CURSE.

163
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,333
- WHOA, YOUR ARM,
WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?

164
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,250
- IS THAT THE CURSE?

165
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,750
- WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

166
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,500
THAT'S GALUNA ISLAND.

167
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:37,125
- Lucy: THAT'S WEIRD. WHY'S THE
MOUNTAIN TOP GLOWING LIKE THAT?

168
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,833
- ZERAM SEN.

169
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,333
DIOLUNA.
KOO-NAH...

170
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,708
- WHAT THE-- WHERE'D HE GO?
- DID HE FALL OUT?

171
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,166
- Happy: IT'S LIKE HE
DISAPPEARED INTO THIN AIR.

172
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,000
- ( gagging )
- ( water rumbles )

173
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:53,000
- WHAT'S THAT SOUND?
- UH, LUCY.

174
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,041
- AH, TSUNAMI!

175
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,750
- NOW, DON'T PANIC.
JUST HOLD ON.

176
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,375
- Lucy: HAPPY, CAN'T YOU
GRAB ONTO THE BOAT AND FLY?

177
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,708
- I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH.

178
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,750
- ( gargling )
- ( muffled screams )

179
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,625
- WHERE AM I?

180
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,458
WHAT A MESS.

181
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,708
- Narrator: THE CURSED ISLAND
OF GALUNA.

182
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,208
- LOOKS LIKE WE MADE IT,
YOU GUYS.

183
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,208
- WE'RE LUCKY THAT WAVE
WASHED US ASHORE.

184
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,125
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF I WOULD CALL IT LUCKY.

185
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,625
- I CAN'T HELP BUT
WONDER WHAT HAPPENED

186
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,208
TO THE GUY
WHO BROUGHT US HERE.

187
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,833
RIGHT AFTER HE TOLD US ABOUT
THE CURSE, HE VANISHED.

188
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,083
- FORGET ABOUT
THAT STUFF FOR NOW

189
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,083
AND LET'S GO EXPLORING!
- AYE.

190
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,791
- WE'VE BEEN HERE,
LIKE, 30 SECONDS

191
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,291
AND YOU GUYS HAVE ALREADY
FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE MISSION.

192
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:44,333
APPARENTLY, THERE'S ONLY ONE
VILLAGE ON THE ENTIRE ISLAND.

193
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:47,416
THE VILLAGE CHIEF IS THE ONE WHO
ORIGINALLY PUT IN THE REQUEST.

194
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,083
SO I GUESS WE NEED
TO TRY AND FIND HIM.

195
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,791
- NOT SO FAST.

196
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,250
- GIVE IT UP, GRAY.  YOU CAN'T
TAKE US BACK TO THE GUILD

197
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,750
NOW THAT OUR BOAT'S
BEEN DESTROYED.

198
00:08:56,833 --> 00:09:00,625
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M COMING WITH YOU.

199
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,750
THERE'S NO WAY I'M GONNA
LET THE TWO OF YOU CLOWNS

200
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,625
MAKE S-CLASS BEFORE I DO.
AND IF YOU WERE KICKED OUT,

201
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,833
THE GUILD WOULD
BE PRETTY BORING.

202
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,541
GRAMPS WILL BE UPSET,
BUT IF WE PULL THIS OFF,

203
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,750
HE WON'T STAY MAD AT US
FOR LONG.

204
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,208
LET'S GO.

205
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,375
- AYE!
- YEAH!

206
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,791
- Narrator: THE DREADED
"KEEP OUT" SIGN.

207
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,541
- Gray: WELL,
WE FOUND THE VILLAGE.

208
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,875
NOW WHAT?
- Natsu: CHECK OUT THAT GATE.

209
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,208
WHEN THEY SAY "KEEP OUT,"
THEY MEAN IT.

210
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,875
- ANYONE HOME?

211
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,083
WE CAME HERE TO HELP YOU!

212
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,375
- LET'S BUST IN.
- NO WAY!

213
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,000
- WHO GOES THERE?

214
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,666
- WE'RE WIZARDS
FROM FAIRY TAIL

215
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,958
RESPONDING TO YOUR REQUEST.

216
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,583
- WHY WEREN'T WE NOTIFIED

217
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,000
WHEN YOU ACCEPTED THE JOB?

218
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,208
- UH, WELL...
- SORRY, IT WAS PROBABLY

219
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,958
JUST A MIX-UP
WITH THE PAPERWORK.

220
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,166
- THEN LET ME SEE YOUR EMBLEMS
RIGHT NOW!

221
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,666
- ( Guards gasp )
THEY'RE HERE.

222
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,625
THEY'RE REALLY HERE.

223
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,708
- Happy: IT'S LIKE WE'RE WALKING
INTO A GIANT MONSTER'S MOUTH.

224
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,375
- ARE YOU TRYING
TO FREAK ME OUT?

225
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,166
- I'M MOKA THE VILLAGE CHIEF.

226
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,875
ON BEHALF OF EVERYONE HERE,
I WELCOME YOU.

227
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,916
PLEASANTRIES ASIDE, THERE'S
SOMETHING YOU NEED TO SEE.

228
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,291
NOW, MY PEOPLE.

229
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:21,958
- IT'S JUST LIKE
WHAT HAPPENED

230
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,750
TO THE BOAT GUY.
- YEAH.

231
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,208
- OH WOW! YOUR SIDEBURNS!
- NOT THAT.

232
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,416
I WAS TRYING TO SHOW YOU
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO MY ARM.

233
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,333
EVERYONE ON THE ISLAND
HAS SUFFERED

234
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,875
HORRIBLE DISFIGUREMENT
BECAUSE OF THIS CURSE.

235
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,125
NOT EVEN THE ANIMALS
HAVE BEEN SPARED.

236
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,666
- PLEASE EXCUSE ME FOR ASKING,

237
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,791
BUT WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
IT'S A CURSE, SIR?

238
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,416
IT COULD BE SOME KIND 
OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE.

239
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,458
- WE'VE CONSULTED WITH
DOZENS OF DOCTORS, YOUNG MAN.

240
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:47,375
BUT THEY ALL AGREE THAT
NO SUCH DISEASE EXISTS.

241
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,041
YOU SEE, OUR SYMPTOMS BEGAN

242
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:53,708
AROUND THE SAME TIME THE MOON
FELL UNDER AN EVIL SPELL.

243
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,166
- WHAT KIND OF SPELL?

244
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,791
- SINCE ANCIENT TIMES,

245
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,125
THIS ISLAND HAS ABSORBED
THE LIGHT OF THE MOON

246
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,666
'CAUSING IT TO GLOW

247
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,250
ALMOST AS BEAUTIFULLY
AS THE MOON ITSELF.

248
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,250
HOWEVER, SEVERAL YEARS AGO,

249
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,708
THE MOON'S COLOR
BEGAN TO CHANGE.

250
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:11,208
AND AN EERIE PURPLE GLOW 
WAS CAST UPON THE ISLAND.

251
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,541
- SO THE MOON TURNED PURPLE?
- ( gasps )

252
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,833
IT'S COMING OUT FROM
BEHIND THE CLOUDS.

253
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,708
- Lucy: OH WOW.

254
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,000
IT REALLY IS PURPLE.

255
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,083
- Gray: MAN,
THAT'S CREEPY LOOKING.

256
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,625
- Moka: IT'S THE CURSE.

257
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,666
STAND BACK.  THE CHANGE
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.

258
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,041
( gasps )

259
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:34,208
- ( groaning )
- WHOA, WHAT THE--

260
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,000
- ( screaming, groaning )

261
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,833
( growling )

262
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,791
- THEY'RE CHANGING.
- YEAH, I SEE THAT.

263
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,875
- WHY IS THIS
HAPPENING TO THEM?

264
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:56,958
- I'M SORRY IF OUR APPEARANCE
FRIGHTENS YOU.

265
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,666
- IT'S OKAY.
I'M JUST COMPLETELY CONFUSED.

266
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,291
- YOU POOR PEOPLE.
- OH, MAN.

267
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,000
YOU GUYS LOOK SO COOL!

268
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,708
- Village: HUH?

269
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,250
- IT'S AWESOME.
YOU'VE GOT HORNS AND STUFF.

270
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,208
I'M SO JEALOUS. - Villager:
HE THINKS WE LOOK COOL?

271
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,000
- NO ONE'S EVER SAID
THAT TO US BEFORE.

272
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,958
- NATSU, YOU'RE
BEING INSENSITIVE.

273
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,458
THEY DON'T WANT
TO LOOK LIKE THIS?

274
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,666
- SERIOUSLY?
HUH, MY BAD.

275
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,375
THEN I GUESS
WE SHOULD HELP THEM OUT.

276
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:24,375
- Happy: THAT IS WHY WE'RE HERE.
- GET A CLUE, MAN.

277
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,458
- ANYWAY, AS YOU'VE WITNESSED,

278
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:30,083
WHENEVER THE PURPLE MOON
SHOWS ITS FACE IN THE SKY,

279
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,291
EVERYONE IN THE VILLAGE
TAKES ON A HORRIFIC DEMON FORM.

280
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,500
- ( cries )
- IF IT ISN'T A CURSE,

281
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,875
THEN WHAT ELSE COULD IT
POSSIBLY BE?

282
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,708
WE'LL RETURN TO NORMAL

283
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,125
ONCE THE MORNING COMES
AND THE SUN HAS RISEN.

284
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,541
HOWEVER, THERE ARE
SOME POOR SOULS

285
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:49,166
WHO CAN NO LONGER SWITCH BACK
TO THEIR HUMAN FORMS

286
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,875
FOR THEY HAVE
LOST THEIR MINDS.

287
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,000
- HOW SAD.

288
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,708
- THE FATE FOR THEM,

289
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:56,125
THESE UNFORTUNATE SOULS
IN THE GRIP OF MADNESS...

290
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,208
WE'VE NO CHOICE,
BUT TO PUT THEM TO DEATH.

291
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:02,083
- BUT THEY MIGHT CHANGE BACK
TO NORMAL SOME DAY.

292
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,791
- IF WE WAIT
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN,

293
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,958
THE MONSTERS WILL
SURELY KILL US ALL.

294
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:09,666
WE'VE TRIED CAPTURING THEM,
BUT THEY ALWAYS BROKE FREE.

295
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,125
IT'S NO USE.

296
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,083
( in tears ):
ONCE IT TAKES HOLD,

297
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,750
THERE'S NO WAY TO SAVE THEM.

298
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,833
I SHOULD KNOW.

299
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:21,125
I WAS FORCED TO KILL
MY VERY OWN SON.

300
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,791
- ( gasping )
- THAT'S THE GUY FROM THE BOAT.

301
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,125
BUT WE JUST SAW HIM YESTERDAY--
- SHH.

302
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:29,541
NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY HE
DISAPPEARED ON US LIKE THAT.

303
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,375
HE'S DEAD, BUT HIS SOUL
CAN'T REST IN PEACE.

304
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,333
- A GHOST?

305
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:38,208
- PLEASE LIFT THE EVIL CURSE
FROM OUR ISLAND.

306
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,791
IF THIS GOES ON MUCH LONGER, 
WE MAY ALL FALL VICTIM TO IT.

307
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:45,041
WE'LL DIE. - WE'RE NOT
GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN.

308
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,083
WE CAN FIX THIS.
I PROMISE YOU.

309
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:52,833
- THERE'S ONLY WAY THIS
WRETCHED CURSE CAN BE LIFTED.

310
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,166
THE MOON.

311
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,583
THE MOON MUST
BE WIPED FROM THE SKY.

312
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,166
- Happy: I NEVER KNEW THE
MOON COULD BE SO CREEPY.

313
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,625
- HURRY AND CLOSE THE WINDOW.
YOU HEARD WHAT THE CHIEF SAID.

314
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,250
WE GOT TO STAY
OUT OF THE MOONLIGHT.

315
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,083
YOU MAY NOT CARE,
BUT I DON'T WANT TO RISK

316
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,041
TURNING INTO SOME
FREAKY-LOOKING MONSTER.

317
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,250
- I'M NOT SO SURE
ABOUT THIS JOB, GUYS.

318
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,041
- DO THESE PEOPLE REALLY THINK
WE CAN DESTROY THE MOON?

319
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,958
- I WONDER HOW MANY
PUNCHES IT'LL TAKE?

320
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,416
YOU THINK I CAN HANDLE IT?
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

321
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,208
DON'T BE STUPID, MAN.

322
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,083
- NATSU, THERE'S NOT
A WIZARD ALIVE

323
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,958
WHO'S STRONG ENOUGH
TO DO THAT.

324
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,458
- BUT THAT'S THE JOB
WE WERE HIRED TO DO, ISN'T IT?

325
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,375
WE CAN'T TAKE A JOB,
THEN BACK OUT

326
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,250
'CAUSE THAT WOULD MAKE
FAIRY TAIL LOOK BAD.

327
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,208
- WHAT THEY'RE ASKING
CAN'T BE DONE.

328
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,625
HOW DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
GONNA GET TO THE MOON, ANYWAY?

329
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,666
- WITH HAPPY.
- I DON'T THINK SO.

330
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,708
- OKAY, WE CAN'T 
DESTROY THE MOON.

331
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,500
BUT IF WE DO
SOME INVESTIGATING,

332
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,250
WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO FIND A DIFFERENT WAY

333
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,458
TO LIFT THE CURSE
FROM THE ISLAND.

334
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,166
- YOU KIDS CAN
DO WHAT YOU WANT,

335
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,250
BUT AFTER THE DAY I'VE HAD,
I NEED SOME SHUT-EYE.

336
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,791
- PLEASE DON'T
TAKE OFF ANY MORE.

337
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,250
- OKAY, OUR INVESTIGATION
STARTS TOMORROW MORNING.

338
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,208
I'M HITTING THE SACK.
- ME TOO.

339
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,125
- SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN TO ME.

340
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:03,166
- OKAY, THEN. I'M PRETTY
SLEEPY TOO. GOOD NIGHT.

341
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,833
- ( boys snoring )

342
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,416
- SO LOUD!
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO SLEEP

343
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,333
WHEN THE BEAST AND THE PERV
KEEP SNORING?

344
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,291
- ( Natsu yawning ):
IT'S SO EARLY.

345
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,166
- Gray: YEAH, I'M NEVER UP
AT THIS TIME.

346
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,875
- YOU TWO KEPT ME UP ALL NIGHT
AND I'M NOT COMPLAINING.

347
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,541
SO STOP WHINING
AND LET'S GO.

348
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,291
- All: AYE, AYE.

349
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:28,083
- OPEN, GATE OF
THE CLOCK CONSTELLATION.

350
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,833
- ( doorbell rings )
- HOROLOGIUM!

351
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:31,833
- ( ticking )

352
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,250
( hums )

353
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,500
THE TIME IS 7:48.

354
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,416
- Natsu: YOU REALLY
THINK WE'LL BE ABLE

355
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,416
TO FIND ANOTHER WAY
TO LIFT THE CURSE? 

356
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,708
- WELL, WE DON'T HAVE
MUCH OF A CHOICE.

357
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,541
- THE VILLAGE MAY THINK
THE MOON'S CURSED,

358
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,375
BUT EVERYONE ELSE LIKES IT.

359
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,541
AND DESTROYING IT
MIGHT REALLY MESS THINGS UP. 

360
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,500
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE MOON,

361
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,083
THE TIDES WOULD GET ALL CRAZY.

362
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,666
AND AT NIGHT,
THE SKY WOULD BE PITCH BLACK.

363
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,458
- WITHOUT IT,
SALMON COULD GO EXTINCT.

364
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:58,958
AND THEY'RE MY FAVORITE FISH.

365
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,750
- Horologium:
"WOULD YOU GUYS KEEP IT DOWN?

366
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,083
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
LURKING OUT HERE

367
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,833
SO WE SHOULDN'T
DRAW ANY ATTENTION,"

368
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,666
THE LADY DEMANDS IMPATIENTLY.

369
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,333
- YOU SHOULD WALK ON YOUR OWN.
- HE'S RIGHT.

370
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:11,291
DO YOU JUST SUMMON YOUR SPIRITS
BECAUSE YOU'RE LAZY?

371
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,291
- Lucy: LISTEN,
THIS CURSE IS FREAKING ME OUT.

372
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,833
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WE'RE
UP AGAINST AND I'M SCARED.

373
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,625
- Horologium:
...SHE SAYS NERVOUSLY.

374
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,583
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
THIS IS AWESOME!

375
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,333
S-CLASS QUESTS RULE!

376
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,125
- YEAH, I BET I COULD PROBABLY
FREEZE THAT STUPID CURSE.

377
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,125
- Horologium:
"YOU GUYS ARE IDIOTS,"

378
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,833
SHE RETORTS DISPARAGINGLY.
- AYE.

379
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,333
- ( loud thumping )
- Horologium: HUH?

380
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:35,041
- ( thumping approaches )

381
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,166
- HMM?
- WHAT'S THAT?

382
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,125
- ( both gasp )
- ( laughs )

383
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,375
- WHOA, WHAT THE--
- IT'S HUGE.

384
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,583
- Horologium: "WHAT ARE
YOU WAITING FOR?

385
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:43,541
BEAT IT UP, YOU GUYS,"

386
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,333
SHE YELLS FRANTICALLY.

387
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,041
- ICE MAKE: SHIELD.

388
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,791
- AAH!

389
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,583
- Horologium:
"OH NO, WHAT'S WRONG?

390
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,208
DID YOU SERIOUSLY
JUST SNEAK INSIDE HERE?"

391
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,250
"AYE,"

392
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,791
ANSWERS THE LITTLE BLUE CAT.

393
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,208
( beeping, coughing )

394
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,583
- Both: UGH! STINKY!

395
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,583
- ( laughs )

396
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,666
- IT'S A RAT! - COME ON,
NATSU, GET UP, MAN.

397
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,916
- Happy: THE SMELL
KNOCKED HIM OUT.

398
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,291
- ( breathes )

399
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,166
- LET'S GO!

400
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,333
- ( all scream )

401
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,708
- ICE MAKE: FLOOR!

402
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,666
- ( squeals ) WHOA.

403
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,458
- YOU SHOULD'VE DONE THAT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

404
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,666
- SHUT UP, NATSU.

405
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,375
- LOOK, THERE'S SOME KIND
OF BUILDING OVER THERE.

406
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,375
WE SHOULD GO HIDE
WHILE WE HAVE THE CHANCE.

407
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:45,125
- Both: WE SHOULD KICK ITS BUTT
WHILE WE HAVE THE CHANCE.

408
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,750
- GIVE ME A BREAK.

409
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:50,333
- Narrator:
THE TEMPLE OF THE MOON.

410
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,916
- Lucy:
THIS PLACE IS MASSIVE.

411
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,458
- Natsu: YEAH,
AND IT'S FALLING APART.

412
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,166
- Gray:
I WONDER HOW OLD IT IS.

413
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,416
- HUH, WHAT ARE THOSE?
- THEY'RE MOONS.

414
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,791
IT MAKES SENSE.

415
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,750
GALUNA USED TO BE CALLED
THE ISLAND OF THE MOON.

416
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,625
- A MOON ISLAND,
AND MOON CURSE,

417
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,083
AND WEIRD MOON SYMBOLS,

418
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,375
YOU REALLY GOT TO WONDER
WHAT ALL OF IT MEANS.

419
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,291
- MAN, THIS PLACE
IS A WRECK.

420
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,500
THIS FLOOR DOESN'T EVEN
LOOK SAFE TO WALK ON.

421
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,291
- WELL, DON'T GO
STOMPING ON IT. 

422
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,291
- ( grunts )
- ( all scream )

423
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,750
- Gray: NATSU, YOU IDIOT.
LOOK WHAT YOU DID!

424
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,416
- ( gasps )
HEY, IS EVERYBODY OKAY?

425
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,666
- I'D BE BETTER IF YOU
HADN'T KNOCKED OUT THE FLOOR.

426
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,958
- HERE'S A THOUGHT.
IF YOU THINK BEFORE YOU ACT,

427
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,666
MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T
CAUSE SO MUCH DESTRUCTION.

428
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,666
- SO CAN YOU FLY US
OUT OF HERE, HAPPY?

429
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,500
- NO, SORRY.
- WE'RE UNDERNEATH THE TEMPLE.

430
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,958
- WOW, IT'S A SECRET CAVE!
THIS IS SO COOL!

431
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,416
LET'S GO CHECK IT OUT.
- WOULD YOU QUIT RUNNING AROUND

432
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,625
LIKE A CRAZY PERSON?!

433
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,125
- WHOA.
- NATSU?

434
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,041
- WHAT? SOMETHING WRONG?

435
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,750
- HEY, GUYS, WHAT'S THAT?

436
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,791
- ( gasps )
- ( gasps )

437
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,416
- Gray: THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

438
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,541
IT'S DELIORA!

439
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,958
BUT HOW--
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?

440
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,708
WHY IS IT HERE?

441
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,958
WHAT THE HELL IS IT DOING
ON GALUNA ISLAND?!

442
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,541
- YOU'VE SEEN
THIS THING BEFORE?

443
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:32,333
- THERE'S NO--
NO WAY.

444
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:35,166
- GRAY, PLEASE.
TRY TO CALM DOWN.

445
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,958
- ( ragged breathing )

446
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,958
- NOW, CAN YOU
TELL US ABOUT IT?

447
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:47,083
- IT'S DELIORA
THE DEMON OF DESTRUCTION.

448
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,875
- DEMON OF CONSTRUCTION?
- DESTRUCTION.

449
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:53,916
- BUT WHY IS IT HERE?
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

450
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,250
- ( footsteps approach )

451
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,458
- THE VOICES SEEMED TO COME
FROM DOWN HERE.

452
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,041
- ( growls )

453
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,541
- I HATE BEING AWAKE
DURING THE DAY.

454
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,208
- ( growls )

455
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,625
- SO, TOBY, WERE YOU EXPOSED
TO THE MOON DRIP?

456
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,333
YOU'VE GOT THOSE POINTY EARS.
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU!

457
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,041
THEY'RE A FASHION STATEMENT,
YOU JERK!

458
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,083
- LIGHTEN UP, I WAS JUST
TEASING YOU.

459
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,000
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE SO MEAN ABOUT IT.

460
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,791
- HUH, THE MOON DRIP.

461
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,958
COULD THAT BE
THE NAME OF THE CURSE?

462
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:27,916
- YUKA, TOBY, SOMETHING
TERRIBLE HAS HAPPENED.

463
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,416
- WHAT NOW, SHERRY?
- ( yowls )

464
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,958
- IT'S ANGELICA.

465
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,875
SHE'S BEEN ATTACKED
AND I'M SAD.

466
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,333
- YOU'RE MOPING AROUND

467
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,333
BECAUSE SOMEBODY BEAT UP
YOUR STUPID PET RAT?!

468
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,291
- SHE'S NOT A RAT.

469
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,750
SHE'S A BRAVE HUNTER
PROWLING THE JUNGLE 

470
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,458
TO PROTECT US.

471
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,708
SHE IS LOVE.

472
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,250
- I DON'T KNOW WHO
THESE PEOPLE ARE, 

473
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,708
BUT TALK ABOUT
A BUNCH OF WEIRDOS,

474
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,583
ESPECIALLY THE CHICK
WITH A PET RAT.

475
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,583
- JUDGING BY THE SCENT
I PICKED UP OFF 'EM,

476
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,791
THEY'RE NOT FROM THE ISLAND.
- AND THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE

477
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:58,000
THEY HAVE THE DEMON CURSE.
- Yuka: INTRUDERS YOU SAY?

478
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,875
- Sherry: AND IT'S
ALMOST TIME TO BEGIN

479
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,750
COLLECTING MOONLIGHT AGAIN.

480
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,666
OH, THIS MAKES ME SO SAD.

481
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,666
THIS NEWS WOULD DISPLEASE
THE COLD EMPEROR.

482
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,041
WE SHOULD GET RID OF THEM
BEFORE HE FINDS OUT.

483
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:12,958
YES, WE MUST FIND THEM
BEFORE THE MOON'S FIRST LIGHT.

484
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,625
- AGREED.
- ( growls )

485
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,833
- Sherry:
SINCE THEY'VE SEEN DELIORA,

486
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,708
WE CAN'T ALLOW
THEM TO LIVE. 

487
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,708
WE'LL GIVE THEM THE GIFT
OF ETERNAL REST.

488
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,916
WE'LL GIVE THEM LOVE.

489
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,166
- YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT DEATH, RIGHT?

490
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,666
- ( stone clacks )
- WHAT WAS THAT?

491
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,291
- OVER THERE.

492
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,958
- NICE JOB, CAT.
- AYE.

493
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,666
- COME ON, WE SHOULD HAVE
GRABBED THEM

494
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,291
AND BEAT SOME ANSWERS
OUT OF THEM.

495
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,875
- NOT YET, WE'VE GOT TO DO
SOME INVESTIGATING.

496
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:45,000
- MAN, THIS JOB KEEPS GETTING
MORE AND MORE COMPLICATED.

497
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,541
- RIGHT, LIKE WHO IS THIS
COLD EMPEROR GUY?

498
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,750
- DELIORA...

499
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,625
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT ANYONE WOULD WANT WITH IT.

500
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,833
AND HOW THE HELL WERE THEY
EVEN ABLE TO FIND IT?

501
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,958
- Lucy: WAS IT HIDDEN SOMEWHERE?

502
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,708
- IT WAS SEALED AWAY

503
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:02,125
INSIDE A GLACIER
ON THE NORTHERN CONTINENT.

504
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:06,458
A DECADE AGO, THIS IMMORTAL
DEMON RAVAGED ISVAN.

505
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:09,583
COUNTLESS PEOPLE 
LOST THEIR LIVES.

506
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:12,208
THE WOMAN WHO TAUGHT ME
HOW TO USE MY MAGIC,

507
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:15,166
MY MASTER UR,
SACRIFICED EVERYTHING

508
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,208
TO SEAL IT AWAY.

509
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,791
I DON'T KNOW IF IT
HAS ANYTHING TO DO

510
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,583
WITH THE CURSE ON THIS ISLAND,

511
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,333
BUT I DO KNOW THAT IT
DOESN'T BELONG HERE. 

512
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:26,666
THIS COLD EMPEROR,
WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHO IT IS.

513
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,083
IF THEY TARNISH
MY MASTER'S LEGACY,

514
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:32,000
THEY'RE GONNA REGRET
THE DAY THEY WERE BORN.

515
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,791
- ( theme music plays )

516
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:42,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

517
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,875
- Happy: HEY, NATSU, YOU EVER
HEARD OF THIS MOON DRIP THING?

518
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:17,500
- NO, WHAT IS IT?
- I DON'T KNOW,

519
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,000
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE
IT COULD BE JUICE 

520
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,666
OR SOMETHING THAT COMES
FROM THE MOON.

521
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,583
- ( gasps ) YOU THINK THEY
MAKE FOOD OUT OF IT?

522
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:24,416
- AYE, I BET THEY
SQUEEZE THE MOON.

523
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,208
AND THEN THEY TURN THE JUICE
INTO MOON CANDY.

524
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:30,666
- HA HA, I BET
THAT'S A TASTY CANDY.

525
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,250
- Both: NEXT TIME....

526
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:34,791
- HERE'S A QUESTION.
HOW DO YOU THINK THEY'RE ABLE

527
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,250
TO SQUEEZE THE MOON?

528
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:37,541
- I BET WE FIND OUT
IN THE NEXT EPISODE.

529
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:39,000
- I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN WAIT.

530
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:41,375
I WANT MOON DRIP CANDY
RIGHT NOW!
