1
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,708
- HEY, GUYS!  READY FOR
SOME MORE "FAIRY TAIL"?

2
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:22,041
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING,

3
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,916
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE ROOM,

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,875
AND DON'T SIT
TOO CLOSE TO THE TV.

5
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:29,791
- ( gasping )
- ( clamoring )

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,875
- ( theme music playing )

7
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

8
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,458
- Simon: GRAY FULLBUSTER.

9
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:19,083
HE'S MORE POWERFUL THAN
MY INVESTIGATIONS

10
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,958
LED ME TO BELIEVE.
- Happy: YOU OKAY?

11
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:25,541
- WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.
WE GOTTA RESCUE ERZA.

12
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:28,083
- Happy: NO.
YOU CAN'T GO DOWN, TOO.

13
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,250
- IS IT POSSIBLE HIS CONCERN
FOR HIS FRIENDS

14
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,083
INCREASED THE STRENGTH
OF HIS MAGIC?

15
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,500
- COME ON, YOU GOTTA
GET UP, NATSU.

16
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:35,958
- WHY'S EVERYTHING SPINNING?

17
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:42,208
- YOU COULDN'T HAVE CHOSEN
A BETTER GUILD, ERZA.

18
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,458
( Happy speaking )

19
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:54,291
- GENERATOR TOWERS IN PLACE.
- NO ERRORS DETECTED.

20
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,958
- ACQUIRING TARGET.
- SETTING SPATIAL COORDINATES.

21
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,708
- PREPARE TO REVERSE POLARITY.
- STAND BY FOR MAGIC FUSION.

22
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,000
- READYING SATELLITE
SQUARE PLACEMENT.

23
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:05,125
- COMMENCE MAGIC ELEMENT FUSION.
- WE'RE READING HEAVY DISTORTION

24
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,166
FROM THE MOUNTAIN
REGION'S WAVELENGTH.

25
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,541
- RE-CALCULATING SPATIAL
COORDINATES.

26
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,458
- I'M TOTALLY WIPED OUT.

27
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,541
I CAN'T EVEN MOVE A MUSCLE.

28
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,708
GUESS I OVERDID IT FIGHTING
THAT ROCKER FREAK.

29
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:20,791
AND IT LOOKS LIKE JUVIA'S DOWN
FOR THE COUNT, TOO.

30
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,708
- Millianna: WOW!

31
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,750
SOMEONE REALLY DID
A NUMBER ON THIS PLACE.

32
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,500
- HEY, YOU SEE WHAT I SEE, KID?
- I KNOW THAT VOICE.

33
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,458
- GOOD THING WE FOUND
THESE DAMES.

34
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,916
- WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
I DON'T EVEN HAVE THE STRENGTH

35
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,750
TO TELL THESE GUYS WE'RE
NOT ENEMIES ANYMORE.

36
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,208
- MAGIC ENERGY LEVELS AT 60%.
- ETHERION FUSION IS UP TO 47%.

37
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,291
- PINPOINTING TARGET
IN 27 MINUTES.

38
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,041
- ELEMENTAL SUPERVISORS,
PLEASE HURRY!

39
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,833
- Org: SUCH A CRITICAL
DECISION TO MAKE.

40
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:47,916
AND WHILE THE CHAIRMAN IS ON
LEAVE DUE TO HIS AILING HEALTH,

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,041
IT IS OUR SOLEMN DUTY,
IN HIS ABSENCE,

42
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,625
WE NINE REMAINING COUNCIL
MEMBERS MUST DO WHATEVER IT

43
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,125
TAKES TO MAINTAIN ORDER.

44
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,875
- THERE'S NO NEED FOR YOU
TO WORRY, ORG.

45
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,625
I REALIZE WE'RE VIOLATING
INTERNATIONAL PROTOCOL

46
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,875
BY INITIATING
THIS MASSIVE ATTACK.

47
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,458
BUT WE'RE PROTECTED UNDER
CLAUSE 4 OF ARTICLE 27

48
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,791
OF THE NATIONAL
SECURITY DIRECTIVE.

49
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,250
- THE LEGALITY OF THIS
IS NOT MY CONCERN.

50
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:11,125
OUR DECISION TO FIRE
AN ETHERION BLAST

51
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,083
WILL PUT INNOCENT LIVES
AT RISK.

52
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,708
- IF ZEREF IS RESURRECTED,
MORE WILL BE AT RISK.

53
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:19,500
SADLY, AN EVIL FORCE OF THAT
MAGNITUDE CAN ONLY BE COUNTERED

54
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,208
BY SUCH EXTREME MEASURES.

55
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:25,500
- THE TIME HAS FINALLY
ARRIVED, MASTER SIEGRAIN.

56
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,583
- YES.

57
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,916
- AFTER ALL OF THESE YEARS,

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,083
YOUR DREAM WILL
BECOME A REALITY.

59
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,166
- LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
ARE YOU AFRAID?

60
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,625
- NO, NOT IN THE LEAST.

61
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,583
I TRUST YOU WHOLEHEARTEDLY
AND I HAVE COMPLETE FAITH

62
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:37,750
IN YOUR JUDGMENT.

63
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,416
- OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT.
WHY WOULD YOU BE?

64
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,750
YOUR LIFE ISN'T IN JEOPARDY.
- THAT'S TRUE.

65
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,583
- I MUST ADMIT.
I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS.

66
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,625
IF MY PLAN FAILS,
I WILL CEASE TO EXIST.

67
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,125
- WHAT?

68
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,916
- EVEN SO, I CONSIDER THE RISK

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,333
TO MY LIFE A SMALL PRICE TO PAY.

70
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:59,125
I'M SO CLOSE NOW.
MY DESTINY AWAITS.

71
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,583
- YES.

72
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,416
- TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES LEFT.

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,375
THE TIME HAS COME FOR US

74
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,791
TO SAY OUR FAREWELLS,
SIEGRAIN.

75
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:15,125
- HOW COULD YOU?!

76
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:18,375
YOU LIED TO ME, JELLAL.
YOU LIED TO ALL OF US.

77
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,375
I WON'T LET YOU GET AWAY
WITH IT.

78
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,708
- Erza: CALM DOWN, SHO.
- HE'S GOTTA PAY

79
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,291
FOR WHAT HE DID.
- YOU'RE GOING TO NEED MY HELP

80
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:27,416
TO FIGHT HIM.  RELEASE ME
FROM THIS CARD AT ONCE.

81
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,750
- I CAN'T DO THAT.  I'M SORRY,
BUT IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

82
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,166
YOU'RE SAFE IN THERE.
- DON'T BE STUPID.

83
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,541
- ( speaks Japanese )

84
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:01,166
I AM THE ONE THEY
CALL IKARUGA.

85
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,916
WHO MIGHT YOU BE?
- GET OUT OF MY WAY, LADY.

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,875
DON'T MAKE ME HURT YOU.
- DEAR ME,

87
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,166
WHY MUST I BE BURDENED
BY SUCH A BOORISH MAN?

88
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,166
- I WARNED YOU!

89
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,708
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

90
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,791
 MY KATANA IS ABLE TO CUT
THROUGH ANYTHING

91
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,416
WITH EXTREME PRECISION.

92
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,416
- WELL, THAT SWORD
OF YOURS WON'T SCARE ME.

93
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,375
NO.  I-- I CAN'T MOVE.

94
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,250
- I'VE JUST SEVERED YOUR NERVES
WITHOUT CUTTING YOUR CLOTHING

95
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:38,875
OR FLESH.  DON'T CHALLENGE
MY MUGETSU STYLE.

96
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,500
- LET ME OUT OF HERE.
- I CAN'T.

97
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,041
- WELL, WELL,
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

98
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,583
I WONDERED WHERE YOU
WERE HIDING, ERZA.

99
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,208
- YOU'VE GOT TO RELEASE ME, SHO.

100
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,500
SHE'S TOO POWERFUL FOR YOU
TO TAKE ON BY YOURSELF.

101
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:53,666
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
ALL THAT MATTERS IS YOU'RE SAFE.

102
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,125
I CAST A SHIELDING SPELL
ON THAT CARD.

103
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,166
SHE CAN'T HARM YOU
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

104
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,125
- IS THAT SO?

105
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,875
LET'S TEST THAT THEORY,
SHALL WE?

106
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,500
- YOUR SPELL WON'T HOLD UP
AGAINST HER.

107
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,750
THAT'S NO ORDINARY SWORD SHE'S
WIELDING. IT'S MAGICAL.

108
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,250
- YOU'RE SAFE.  I PROMISE.

109
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,583
TRUST ME.

110
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,708
SHE CAN CUT ACROSS
THE DIMENSIONAL RIFT?

111
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,291
SISTER.

112
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:34,750
- I SUSPECTED YOUR ATTACKS WOULD
WEAKEN SHO'S SEALING SPELL,

113
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,750
ALLOWING ME TO CUT RIGHT
THROUGH IT TO FREEDOM.

114
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,625
- A SWORD THAT CAN CUT THROUGH
DIMENSIONS IS AMAZING ENOUGH,

115
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,750
BUT HER ABILITY TO USE THAT
POWER TO HER ADVANTAGE

116
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,958
IS WHAT MAKES HER
EVEN MORE AMAZING.

117
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,250
- YOU SAID YOUR NAME'S IKARUGA.

118
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,458
WELL, I DIDN'T COME ALL
THIS WAY FOR YOU.  BE GONE.

119
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,041
- MY APOLOGIES,

120
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,625
BUT I THINK I'LL STAY.

121
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:01,291
- ( gasps )
- SISTER, NO.

122
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,125
- YOU SEEM SURPRISED.

123
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,166
A SKILLED WARRIOR LIKE YOU
SHOULD HAVE SEEN THAT COMING.

124
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:13,208
- ♪ CAN YOU FEEL ITS GAZE ♪

125
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:17,375
♪ FROM THE DEPTHS
OF THE NIGHT MIST? ♪

126
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,666
♪ THE MONONOKE ♪

127
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,833
- YOUR SINGLE-MINDED FOCUS
ON JELLAL

128
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,833
HAS RENDERED YOU
A FLEDGLING NOVICE.

129
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:29,125
COMPLETELY UNAWARE TO MY KATANA
FLASHING ABOUT YOU.

130
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,416
YES, THERE'S THE LOOK
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.

131
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,625
- I'VE NEVER HER SEEN HER
LIKE THIS.

132
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:38,291
- YOU MAY BE SKILLED, BUT YOU
DON'T STAND A CHANCE AGAINST ME.

133
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:42,208
- YOU'RE MY ENEMY
AND I WILL DEFEAT YOU.

134
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,666
I ALWAYS DO.

135
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,666
- I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY.

136
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:56,541
- HEAVEN'S WHEEL,
CIRCLE SWORD!

137
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,541
- MUGETSU STYLE.

138
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:06,166
- THAT WAS MY YASHA-SENKU.
- SHE CUT THROUGH THE SWORDS.

139
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,791
- ( screams )

140
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,958
- MUGETSU STYLE.

141
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,750
- PLEASE BE CAREFUL.

142
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,083
- KAHRUDAEN.

143
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,541
- AH, THE FLAME EMPRESS ARMOR.

144
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,916
IT'S HIGHLY RESISTANT
TO FLAME ATTACKS, IS IT NOT?

145
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,375
I'M IMPRESSED THAT YOU WERE
ABLE TO REQUIP SO QUICKLY.

146
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,250
HOW EMBARRASSING TO BE
SO INAPPROPRIATELY DRESSED

147
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:40,166
IN THAT YOUNG MAN'S PRESENCE.
I SUGGEST YOU ADORN YOURSELF

148
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,500
WITH THE MOST POWERFUL
ARMOR YOU POSSESS.

149
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,916
- WHAT A MONSTER.

150
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,333
- PURGATORY ARMOR
REQUIP COMPLETE.

151
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:53,416
YOU'LL REGRET YOUR ARROGANCE
WHEN I'M THROUGH WITH YOU.

152
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,208
NO ONE WHO'S SEEN THIS ARMOR
HAS LIVED TO TALK ABOUT IT.

153
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,625
- THIS IS THE MOST POWERFUL
ARMOR IN YOUR COLLECTION?

154
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,791
LET'S TEST ITS LIMITS.
- ( grunts ) 

155
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,500
- ( gasps )

156
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,625
- ( screams )

157
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,041
- I'M SORRY, BUT YOU CAN'T
SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU.

158
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,250
YOU MADE A VALIANT EFFORT,
BUT THERE'S NO ARMOR

159
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,583
IN EXISTENCE THAT MY KATANA
CANNOT CUT THROUGH.

160
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,458
ADMIT YOUR DEFEAT.

161
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:44,541
- NO, THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

162
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,458
SHE CAN'T LOSE.

163
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,875
WHAT IS SHE THINKING?
SHE MUST BE OUT OF HER MIND.

164
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,666
- IS THIS SOME KIND OF JOKE?

165
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,500
WHY WOULD YOU TRADE OUT YOUR
ARMOR FOR AN OUTFIT MADE

166
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,500
OF REGULAR CLOTH?
- Sho: REQUIP!

167
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,333
- IS THIS PECULIAR CHOICE
OF DRESS DESIGNED TO MOCK ME?

168
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,000
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

169
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,666
YOU DON'T STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST HER LIKE THAT.

170
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,708
I'M SURE YOU'VE GOT ALL KINDS OF
HEAVY-DUTY ARMOR, RIGHT?

171
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,875
YOU'VE GOTTA STAY STRONG.

172
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:17,333
- I CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE
I HAVE NEVER BEEN STRONG.

173
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:20,833
IT'S ALL A LIE.

174
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,541
I JUST PREFER TO BE ALONE

175
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,333
'CAUSE I GET NERVOUS
AROUND OTHER PEOPLE.

176
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:29,625
- Gray: WELL, YOU'RE ALONE NOW
SO WHY YOU CRYING?

177
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:35,916
- AS A CHILD, I WATCHED AS THOSE
CLOSE TO ME SUFFERED.

178
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,333
I LOST LOVED ONES BECAUSE
I DIDN'T HAVE THE STRENGTH

179
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:42,208
TO PROTECT THEM.
I TRIED TO BE STRONG.

180
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:45,166
I AM NOT CRYING.

181
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:49,291
BUT WHEN I WAS ALONE,
I COULDN'T HIDE MY EMOTIONS.

182
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,375
I DECIDED THAT IN ORDER
TO CONVINCE EVERYONE

183
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,708
THAT I WAS STRONG,
I WOULD HIDE MY HEART AWAY

184
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,375
INSIDE A SUIT OF ARMOR.

185
00:11:56,458 --> 00:12:00,166
THERE, NO ONE COULD SEE
THAT IT WAS BROKEN.

186
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,958
I WEAR ARMOR
TO CONCEAL MY WEAKNESS

187
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,791
FROM THE REST
OF THE WORLD.

188
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,500
WITHOUT IT, I'VE BEEN
TOO AFRAID TO FIGHT.

189
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,708
- Ikaruga: WEAR IT OR NOT,
IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME.

190
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:14,041
I'LL STRIKE YOU DOWN
JUST THE SAME.

191
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,625
- I THOUGHT MY ARMOR PROTECTED
ME, BUT IT DID MORE HARM

192
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,000
THAN GOOD.
IT SHIELDED ME FROM PAIN,

193
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,541
BUT IT KEPT ME DISTANCED
FROM OTHERS.

194
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,125
MY HEART WAS TOO GUARDED
TO CONNECT WITH ANYONE.

195
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:27,333
THAT IS, UNTIL I JOINED
FAIRY TAIL.

196
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,208
EVERYONE WAS SO WARM AND CARING

197
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,541
THAT MY COLD SHELL BEGAN
TO CRACK AND I BEGAN

198
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,500
TO FEEL EMOTIONS AGAIN.

199
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,500
- SISTER.

200
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,083
- I CAN'T RELY
ON MY ARMOR ANYMORE.

201
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:41,583
I KNOW I'M STRONG ENOUGH
TO DEFEAT YOU WITHOUT IT.  NOW!

202
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,750
- ( grunting )

203
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,875
- OUR BATTLE IS OVER.

204
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,666
MOST IMPRESSIVE.

205
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,166
- SISTER.

206
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,291
WHAT YOU DID WAS AMAZING.

207
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,416
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- I THINK SO.

208
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,750
- DEFEAT IS QUITE BITTER INDEED.
IN ALL OF MY YEARS,

209
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,125
I'VE ONLY KNOWN
THE SWEET TASTE OF VICTORY.

210
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,125
IT DOESN'T MATTER
THAT YOU BEAT ME

211
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,750
BECAUSE YOU AND JELLAL
ARE BOTH DOOMED TO FAIL.

212
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,500
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

213
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,625
- IN 15 MINUTES TIME...

214
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,291
 ♪ THE LIGHT OF JUSTICE ♪

215
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:54,125
 ♪ SHALL COME RAINING
FROM THE SKY ♪

216
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,458
♪ IT SHALL KILL US ALL ♪

217
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:02,875
WHAT A WRETCHED HAIKU.
- Erza: THE ETHERION BLAST.

218
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,666
SHO, GO FIND SIMON
AND MY FAIRY TAIL FRIENDS

219
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,208
AND GET EVERYONE AS FAR AWAY
FROM THE TOWER AS POSSIBLE.

220
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,333
- WHAT?  SISTER.

221
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,000
- I KNOW IT'S HARD,
BUT WILL YOU DO THIS FOR ME?

222
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,291
PLEASE.

223
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,541
- YEAH.

224
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,958
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU?

225
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,958
- I'M GOING TO SETTLE THINGS
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

226
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:30,916
- ( gasping )
WHAT THE--

227
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,833
- I WAS WONDERING WHEN YOU
WERE GONNA WAKE UP.

228
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,750
- THE LAST THING I REMEMBER WAS
FLYING AROUND IN CIRCLES--

229
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,875
- SERIOUSLY?
JUST THE MEMORY MAKES YOU SICK?

230
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,291
WELL, AFTER THAT YOU
WERE EATEN BY THE OWL.

231
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,125
LUCKILY, GRAY WAS ABLE
TO SAVE YOU.

232
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,333
- OH, GREAT.
- HE DEFEATED THE OWL,

233
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,625
BUT HE WAS BADLY WOUNDED
DURING THE FIGHT.

234
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,416
- WHERE'S ERZA?

235
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,750
- I DON'T REMEMBER
YOU BEING THIS HEAVY.

236
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,458
YOU REALLY NEED
TO LOSE SOME WEIGHT.

237
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,541
- SHUT UP, YOU DUMB CAT.

238
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,125
- YOUR FRIEND IS TAKING HIM
TO A SAFER PLACE.

239
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,250
- LOOK, IS THAT
THE SATELLITE SQUARE?

240
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,083
WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.
- LET'S PICK UP OUR SPEED.

241
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,333
- BUT WE'LL SAIL RIGHT
INTO THE FIORE NAVY.

242
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,833
- THAT'S BETTER THAN GETTING
CAUGHT IN THE ETHERION BLAST.

243
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,791
- AW, THERE GO ALL THE SHIPS.
- LOOK BELOW US.

244
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,375
- HUH?  COOL!
I FOUND A BOAT.

245
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,625
- NO, I SHOWED YOU
THE ONE WE CAME IN ON.

246
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,791
- NO WAY.
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

247
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:20,500
I LOST TO THAT OWL FREAK,
BUT GRAY WAS ABLE TO BEAT HIM?

248
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,250
- I WOULDN'T SAY THAT YOU LOST.

249
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,375
IT'S MORE LIKE YOU
WERE SWALLOWED.

250
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,333
- IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT HAPPENED.

251
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,041
HE'S STILL GONNA HOLD THIS OVER
MY HEAD FOR AT LEAST

252
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,250
THE NEXT MONTH.

253
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,583
MAN, THIS SUCKS!
- YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT.

254
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:33,083
- I WON'T STAND FOR THIS.
I DEMAND A REMATCH.

255
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,791
BRING THAT BIRD BRAIN BACK AND
LET ME SHOW HIM WHAT I'VE GOT.

256
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,916
- WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT
KIND OF NONSENSE RIGHT NOW.

257
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,166
- DON'T WANNA BE RUDE,
BUT DO I KNOW YOU?

258
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,500
- I'M SIMON. I WAS FRIENDS WITH
ERZA BACK WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

259
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,833
- OH, IN THAT CASE,
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

260
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,625
- ( wincing )
- ARE YOU OKAY, BIG GUY?

261
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:54,000
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. I'M
FINE.I JUST GOT WORD FROM WALLY.

262
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,958
- HE AND MILLIANNA
FOUND LUCY AND JUVIA,

263
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,541
BUT THEY'RE IN BAD SHAPE.

264
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,416
HE SAID IT LOOKED LIKE THEY TOOK
DOWN ONE OF THE TRINITY RAVEN

265
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,583
- ALL BY THEMSELVES.
- THE TWO OF 'EM?

266
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,875
- THEY HADN'T HEARD THAT
WE'RE NOT ENEMIES ANYMORE.

267
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,750
SO THEY WERE CONFUSED
WHEN I ASKED THEM

268
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,583
TO TAKE THE GIRLS
TO SAFETY.

269
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,583
- I GUESS THEY CALLED OFF
THE HIT ON THESE BROADS.

270
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:10,958
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

271
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,541
BUT SIMON SAYS
WE'RE FRIENDS NOW.

272
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,375
- YEAH, WELL IF WE'RE
SUCH GOOD FRIENDS,

273
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,958
WHY'D SHE TIE ME UP AND DRAG ME
ACROSS THE FLOOR LIKE THIS?

274
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,875
- Simon: SHO'S ALSO INFORMED ME
THAT THE LAST MEMBER

275
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,833
OF TRINITY RAVEN
HAS BEEN DEFEATED.

276
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,750
- I DIDN'T GET TO DO ANYTHING.

277
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,583
- NOW THEY'RE OUT OF THE
PICTURE,

278
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:27,750
THAT JUST LEAVES JELLAL.

279
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,750
ERZA'S GONE TO FIND HIM.
- BY HERSELF?

280
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,458
- SHE'S GOT A SCORE TO SETTLE
AND WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT,

281
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,333
SHE'S WANTS TO DO IT
ON HER OWN.

282
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:39,500
I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE SHE
AND JELLAL HAVE QUITE A HISTORY.

283
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:43,208
IT'S AS IF THEY'RE DESTINED
TO FIGHT EACH OTHER.

284
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,666
I'M WORRIED ABOUT HER
BECAUSE JELLAL'S STRONGER

285
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,958
THAN SHE KNOWS.
I BEG YOU.

286
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,666
YOU HAVE TO HELP HER FIGHT HIM.
- NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

287
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,916
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

288
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,208
- ( sighs ) DON'T TELL ME
THE GAME'S OVER ALREADY.

289
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,291
- YOU FIND THAT MUCH PLEASURE IN
TOYING WITH THE LIVES OF OTHERS?

290
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,250
- BETWEEN THE MOMENT OF OUR
BIRTH AND THE TIME OF OUR DEATH,

291
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:06,458
THERE IS ONLY THAT GAME
OF EMOTIONS WE CALL LIFE.

292
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:11,375
WHAT COULD BE MORE DREARY THAN
SIMPLY EXISTING DAY AFTER DAY?

293
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:15,333
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME,
HASN'T IT?

294
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:19,333
- IT CERTAINLY HAS.

295
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:23,583
SHO AND THE OTHERS ARE NO LONGER
UNDER YOUR INFLUENCE.

296
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,541
- THAT'S FINE WITH ME.

297
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,166
NOW THAT THE TOWER OF HEAVEN
HAS BEEN COMPLETED,

298
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,250
I HAVE NO NEED FOR THEM.

299
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,375
- YOU DON'T SEEM TOO CONCERNED
IT'LL SOON BE DESTROYED.

300
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:36,541
- YOU MEAN BY THE ETHERION?
( laughs )

301
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,875
- YOU'RE SO CAREFREE, I CAN
ONLY ASSUME YOU WERE BLUFFING.

302
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:43,375
- NOT SO.  THE ETHERION
WILL RAIN DOWN ON US.

303
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,458
- I'M RELIEVED TO HEAR IT.

304
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,666
THAT MEANS I JUST NEED
TO KEEP YOU OCCUPIED

305
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,333
FOR THE NEXT TEN MINUTES,

306
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,791
AND THIS NIGHTMARE
WILL BE OVER AT LAST.

307
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,875
NO.
WHEN THE BEAM STRIKES,

308
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,583
YOUR LIFE WILL BE SACRIFICED
TO ZEREF.

309
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,291
THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN CERTAIN.

310
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,625
YOU CANNOT AVOID FATE, ERZA.

311
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,833
THIS IS YOUR DESTINY.

312
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,750
- Gray: COME ON, YOU GUYS.
TURN THIS BOAT AROUND RIGHT NOW.

313
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,625
- THAT AIN'T HAPPENING,
SO CLOSE YOUR HEAD.

314
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,833
- ERZA SAID TO GET AS FAR AWAY
FROM THE TOWER AS WE CAN.

315
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:13,625
- BUT NOW SHE AND NATSU HAVE NO
WAY TO LEAVE.  THEY'RE STUCK.

316
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,000
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.
THEY'RE GONNA BE FINE.

317
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,541
I KNOW IT.
- HE CAN'T DO IT ALONE.

318
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,958
NATSU NEEDS ME THERE
TO BACK HIM UP.

319
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,875
- FORGET ABOUT IT.
SIMON'S WITH HIM

320
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,791
SO I'M SURE IT'LL
WORK OUT JUST DANDY.

321
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,666
WELL, IT'S NOT GONNA BE "DANDY"
IF THEY END UP DEAD.

322
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,541
- YEAH, WELL YOU DON'T HAVE TO
YELL LIKE THAT.

323
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:30,833
- WE SHOULDN'T BE
FIGHTING YOU GUYS.

324
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,208
- SHUT YOUR TRAP AND TAKE ME

325
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,541
BACK TO THE SHORE RIGHT NOW.
I GOTTA GO BACK FOR HER.

326
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,041
- I'M WITH HIM. TURN
THE BOAT AROUND.

327
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,416
- I TOLD YA,
THAT AIN'T HAPPENING!

328
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,375
- JUST SHUT UP!

329
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,750
QUIT YELLING AT EACH OTHER
AND JUST TRY TO GET ALONG.

330
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,750
I WANNA GO BACK FOR THEM TOO,
BUT WE CAN'T

331
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,791
'CAUSE THE ETHERION'S GONNA
BLAST THAT PLACE ANY MINUTE NOW.

332
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,375
NATSU'S GONNA SAVE ERZA.

333
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,875
AND THEY'RE GONNA MAKE IT
OUT OF THERE ALIVE.

334
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,416
SIMON TOLD ME THAT'S
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.

335
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,916
HE SAID ONCE NATSU'S TRUE POWER
AWAKENS WITHIN HIM,

336
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,708
HE'S GONNA BE UNSTOPPABLE.
( sobbing )

337
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,083
NOT EVEN JELLAL WILL BE ABLE

338
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,041
TO BEAT HIM.
- ( crying )

339
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,666
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
YOU CLAIM TO BE ERZA'S FRIEND,

340
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,875
BUT YOU REFUSE TO HELP HER?
- THIS IS HER FIGHT.

341
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,833
SHE WANTS TO HANDLE IT
ON HER OWN.

342
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,083
SHE'D NEVER FORGIVE ME
IF I BUTTED IN

343
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,666
ON THE ACTION LIKE THAT.

344
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,583
- THERE'S NO WAY THAT SHE COULD
EVER WIN AGAINST JELLAL.

345
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,958
- WHAT?  SHE'S STRONGER
THAN YOU GIVE HER CREDIT FOR,

346
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,000
SO WATCH YOUR MOUTH.
- YOU'VE GOT IT WRONG.

347
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:24,458
I'M NOT SAYING THAT I DOUBT
THE POWER OF HER MAGIC.

348
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,333
DESPITE EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED,

349
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,750
I KNOW ERZA STILL WANTS
TO TRY TO SAVE JELLAL.

350
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,000
I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY MIND.

351
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,375
IN HER HEART,
SHE COULD NEVER TRULY HATE

352
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:37,708
THE BOY SHE REMEMBERS
FROM CHILDHOOD.

353
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,041
JELLAL IS VICIOUSLY CUNNING.

354
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,666
HE KNOWS EXACTLY HOW
TO MANIPULATE HER FEELINGS

355
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,416
TO HIS ADVANTAGE.

356
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,125
AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING
WORKING AGAINST HER.

357
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,125
AS YOU KNOW, THE MAGIC
COUNCIL IS PREPARING

358
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,666
TO FIRE AN ETHERION BLAST.

359
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,166
WHEN THAT HAPPENS, THE TOWER
AND ANYONE INSIDE IT

360
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,666
WILL BE WIPED OUT.

361
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,666
IF WHAT SHO TOLD ME IS CORRECT,
WE ONLY HAVE TEN MINUTES.

362
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,500
- WHAT?
- SHE ORDERED EVERYONE ELSE

363
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,875
TO LEAVE THE TOWER
AND WENT TO FACE HIM ALONE.

364
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,541
IF YOU KNOW HER
AS WELL AS YOU SAY,

365
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,458
THEN YOU KNOW WHAT SHE'S UP TO.

366
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:11,083
SHE'S GIVING UP HER LIFE
AND WHEN THE BLAST COMES,

367
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,958
IT WILL TAKE THEM
BOTH DOWN TOGETHER.

368
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:17,708
- YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT
TO BEGIN WITH.

369
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,500
TELL ME WHERE I CAN FIND ERZA.

370
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,541
- Jellal: THERE ARE ONLY
SEVEN MINUTES LEFT.

371
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,416
WHEN THE ETHERION
STRIKES THE TOWER,

372
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,375
WE'LL TAKE OUR FINAL BREATHS.

373
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:30,500
WHY DON'T WE SIMPLY ENJOY
THESE LAST MOMENTS TOGETHER?

374
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,958
- YOU SHOULD KNOW I'VE CAST OFF
ALL MY FEARS.

375
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,166
EVEN OF MY OWN DEATH.

376
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,583
I'LL RELISH IN IT BECAUSE I'LL
BE TAKING YOU DOWN WITH ME.

377
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,291
- OH, REALLY?
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?

378
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,875
WELL, WE'LL JUST SEE
ABOUT THAT.

379
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:00,291
- YOU'D DESTROY THE VERY THING
YOU WORKED SO HARD TO COMPLETE?

380
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,833
WHAT'S THE POINT?

381
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,500
- WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT
A PILLAR OR TWO?

382
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,458
AFTER ALL, THEY'RE NOTHING
BUT DECORATIONS.

383
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,458
- MAYBE SO BUT THE REASON
THEY'RE HERE

384
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,625
IS BECAUSE THE OTHERS SPENT
ALL THOSE YEARS

385
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,125
BUILDING THEM FOR YOU.

386
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,166
- HOW IS IT YOU MANAGE TO FIND
FAULT IN EVERYTHING I SAY?

387
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,875
I NEVER FORCED THEM TO WORK.
THEY CHOSE TO.

388
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,666
THEY KNEW HOW IMPORTANT
THE TOWER WAS TO ME.

389
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,125
AND NOW, AT LONG LAST,
IT'S BEEN COMPLETED.

390
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,375
- ( gasps )

391
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:37,958
WHILE IT'S EVIDENT YOU'VE HONED
YOUR SKILLS OVER THE YEARS,

392
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,041
YOU'RE NO MATCH FOR ME.

393
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,750
- ( sobbing )
- Gray: YOU'RE FREAKING ME OUT

394
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,125
'CAUSE THIS ISN'T LIKE YOU
AT ALL.

395
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,416
WE WANNA STAY HERE
AND HELP YOU OUT.

396
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,583
MASTER TAUGHT US THAT EVEN
THE STRONGEST WARRIORS

397
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,708
NEED A LITTLE BACKUP EVERY
ONCE IN A WHILE.

398
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,708
- Lucy:
AND NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

399
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,666
WE'RE ALWAYS GONNA
HAVE YOUR BACK.

400
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,000
- Happy: AYE!
WE'RE THE STRONGEST TEAM.

401
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,500
- Simon: I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED
IN YOU, ERZA.

402
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,125
AND THERE'S NOTHING
THAT COULD CHANGE THAT.

403
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,333
- Sho: SISTER.

404
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,833
- Erza: I'LL MISS THEM.

405
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:11,666
- I WANT A REMATCH WHEN WE GET
BACK TO FAIRY TAIL.

406
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:25,375
- I TOLD YOU.  I'VE CAST OFF
ALL MY FEARS, INCLUDING YOU.

407
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:28,083
( shouts )

408
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:31,083
- THIS IS NOT THE WEAK GIRL
I REMEMBER.

409
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:34,000
( grunts )

410
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:42,083
- ( end theme playing )

411
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,708
- ( singing in Japanese )

412
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,333
- HEY, HAPPY.  JUST WONDERING,
WHAT DO YOU KNOW

413
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:17,833
ABOUT THIS ETHERION THINGY THAT
EVERYONE'S FREAKING OUT ABOUT?

414
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,625
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
YOU'RE A WIZARD

415
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,500
AND YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT IS?

416
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:23,291
IT'S AN EXTREMELY POWERFUL
WEAPON CONTROLLED

417
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,541
BY THE MAGIC COUNCIL THAT CAN
DISINTEGRATE EVERYTHING

418
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:27,708
IN ITS PATH.
- WOW!

419
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:30,500
THEN I GUESS IT WOULD BE REALLY
BAD IF IT HIT US, HUH?

420
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:35,625
WE CAN'T WASTE ANY MORE TIME
SITTING AROUND HERE.

421
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,666
WE GOTTA FIND ERZA.

422
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,333
- NATSU, YOU BETTER GET
WITH THE PROGRAM PRETTY SOON,

423
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:41,916
OR WE WON'T HAVE A PRAYER.
