1
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,291
- Carla: PREVIOUSLY,
ON FAIRY TAIL.

2
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,250
- Happy: LIFE IN THE GUILD IS
WAY MORE EXCITING

3
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:23,583
SINCE CARLA AND WENDY JOINED!

4
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,375
DON'T YOU THINK SO?

5
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,916
- Natsu: YEAH, AND GILDARTS
FINALLY CAME BACK!

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,291
I'M ALL FIRED UP!

7
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,000
- Lucy: HEY, I KNOW THIS IS
OUT OF THE BLUE,

8
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:30,916
BUT SOMETHING'S
BEEN BOTHERING ME.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,416
- Natsu: HUH?
- Happy: HUH?

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,458
- Lucy: IT'S ABOUT MYSTOGAN.
DOESN'T HE REMIND YOU OF...

11
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:35,666
- Natsu: WHOA!
WE'RE OUT OF TIME!

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,375
- Happy: OKAY! CUE THE MUSIC!

13
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:38,875
- ( theme song playing )

14
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:56,416
- ( singing in Japanese )

15
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,000
- ( cat mewing )

16
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:14,750
- ( grunting )

17
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:16,541
NO!

18
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:17,916
- ( mewing )

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,125
- NOT THIS ONE, EITHER!

20
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:20,541
- ( mewing )

21
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:21,916
- DEFINITELY NOT!

22
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,416
( groaning )

23
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,041
SALAMANDER AND THAT LITTLE GIRL

24
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,416
HAVE THEIR OWN MAGICAL
FLYING KITTY CATS.

25
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,666
I'M A DRAGON SLAYER
SO I DESERVE TO HAVE

26
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,750
A FURRY FRIEND LIKE THEY DO!

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
HUH?

28
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,208
- ( meowing )

29
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,708
- ( laughing )

30
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,000
- ( Happy reading )

31
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,541
- YOU DON'T HAVE ANY
GAJEEL FIGURES LEFT, DO YOU?

32
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,625
- IT'S NICE TO SEE SOME DIE HARD
FANS SUPPORTING OUR WIZARDS!

33
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:13,666
AND YOU GOT HERE JUST IN
TIME, TOO! MY LAST ONE!

34
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,416
- WOW! THERE'S EVEN A STAND FOR
A CAT, IN CASE HE GETS ONE!

35
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,583
- OH, MAN, YOU GUYS
THINK OF EVERYTHING!

36
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,250
- WELL, WE FIGURED IT WAS
A TREND,

37
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,458
SO WE DESIGNED IT WITH
THE FUTURE IN MIND, YOU KNOW?

38
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,125
- ( yelling )

39
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,708
- GEEZ! CALM IT DOWN!
IT'S BARELY PAST NOON!

40
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,500
- THAT'S REALLY FUNNY, CANA.

41
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,208
CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME
YOU DIDN'T START

42
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,625
BOOZIN' AFTER LUNCH.

43
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,208
- I SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT YOU'VE
DONE TO YOUR STOMACH.

44
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,375
IT MUST BE MADE OF IRON!

45
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,083
- I CAN HOLD MY LIQUOR!

46
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,750
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME I GOT
TRASHED AND ACTED LIKE A MANIAC?

47
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,875
- Both: YEAH, ALRIGHT,
YOU GOTTA GOOD POINT.

48
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:49,291
- MAN, I DIDN'T THINK
THIS WOULD BE THIS HARD.

49
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,458
- HEY, WHAT YOU READING THERE?

50
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,708
- OH, IT'S A BOOK OF POEMS,

51
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,791
WRITTEN IN THE ANCIENT
LANGUAGE OF HARAKAN.

52
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,416
- YOU SAY THAT LIKE IT'S THE
SIMPLEST THING IN THE WORLD!

53
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,833
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY
READING THAT THING?

54
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,541
- IT'S DIFFICULT BUT I
CAN UNDERSTAND MOST OF IT.

55
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,791
- Both: YOU'VE GOT
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL BRAIN!

56
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:09,666
- WHY ARE YOU SO FASCINATED
WITH JULY SEVENTH, 777?

57
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,583
- IT'S BECAUSE THAT'S THE DAY
THAT THE DRAGONS

58
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,500
THAT RAISED ME AND NATSU
BOTH DISAPPEARED,

59
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,833
SO I GUESS IT'S JUST
ALWAYS ON MY MIND.

60
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,166
- I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED.
'CAUSE ACCORDING TO NATSU,

61
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,250
APPARENTLY GAJEEL'S
DRAGON METALLICANA

62
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,500
DISAPPEARED THAT VERY SAME DAY.

63
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,708
- DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS
ON THE MATTER?

64
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,208
- MAYBE THEY ALL
WENT ON A DRAGON PICNIC?

65
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,583
- AN INTERESTING IDEA.

66
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,625
I ACTUALLY NEVER THOUGHT OF
THAT ONE BEFORE.

67
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,458
- ( snoring )

68
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:34,875
- THIS'LL BE GREAT!

69
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,583
- THEN AGAIN, NOW THAT
YOU MENTION IT,

70
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,416
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AFRAID
THAT THEY ALL JUST

71
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,708
DECIDED TO ABANDON US.

72
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,125
BUT IF THAT'S THE CASE,

73
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,083
WHERE DO YOU THINK THEY'VE
BEEN HIDING ALL THIS TIME?

74
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,083
- THERE!

75
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,333
HEY, CARLA!

76
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,833
LOOK! ISN'T THIS THE BIGGEST
MACKEREL YOU'VE EVER SEEN?

77
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,041
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE HUNGRY,
SO I CAUGHT IT FOR YOU!

78
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,000
- THANKS, BUT NO THANKS.

79
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,541
IT SMELLS.
AND I DON'T CARE FOR FISH.

80
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,583
- OH, I SEE! THEN
TELL ME WHAT YOU LIKE

81
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:03,541
AND I'LL FETCH IT FOR YA.

82
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,500
- GET AWAY FROM ME!
- OH!

83
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,208
- I DON'T HAVE TIME TO WASTE
ON SOMEONE SO ANNOYING.

84
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,000
- HOLD ON A MINUTE, CARLA!
- HMPH!

85
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:17,125
- SHE'S NEVER BEEN FRIENDLY,
BUT THAT WAS DOWN RIGHT HARSH.

86
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,541
YOU OKAY, LITTLE GUY?

87
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,875
- ( whimpers )

88
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:24,750
- WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
WHY WERE YOU SO MEAN TO HAPPY?

89
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:29,000
- I DESPISE THAT NAME! THE IRONY
OF IT TURNS MY STOMACH!

90
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,708
THEY'RE ALL SUCH IGNORANT FOOLS!

91
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,666
- CARLA, PLEASE TALK TO ME!

92
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,291
- YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS LIKE CARLA
TREATS HAPPY THE WORST

93
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,166
OUT OF EVERYONE.

94
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,208
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHY?

95
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,708
- TRUST ME, I WISH I KNEW.

96
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,166
- WAIT UP, CARLA!

97
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,125
- WHAT IS IT? I THOUGHT I TOLD
YOU TO QUIT PESTERING ME!

98
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,166
- I KNOW, BUT I WAS WONDERING
IF I'D DONE SOMETHIN'

99
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,208
TO MAKE YOU MAD.

100
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,541
- IT'S MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT.

101
00:05:58,583 --> 00:05:59,541
- ( whimpers )

102
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,791
- YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T
PROTECT NATSU.

103
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,333
- ( thunder rumbling )

104
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,916
- HOWEVER, I WILL PROTECT WENDY.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,958
- ( gasps )

106
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,083
- I MUST.

107
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,125
SHE'S THE ONLY THING
THAT MATTERS TO ME.

108
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,291
- ME AND NATSU ARE BEST FRIENDS,
JUST LIKE YOU GUYS.

109
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,333
AND I'VE PROTECTED HIM JUST AS
MANY TIMES AS HE'S SAVED ME!

110
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,416
- YOU MAY BELIEVE THAT.

111
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,291
- ( thunder rumbling )

112
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,625
- BUT YOU SIMPLY CAN'T
UNTIL YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

113
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:01,166
- UNTIL I KNOW WHO I AM?
BUT I DO! DON'T I?

114
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,458
UH...

115
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,375
- ( grunting )

116
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,208
- Happy: WHY'S YOUR FACE
ALL SCRATCHED UP?

117
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,333
- SHUT IT, CAT!

118
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,333
- ( thunder rumbling )

119
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,000
- Wendy: CARLA!

120
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,291
CARLA! WHERE ARE YOU?

121
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,875
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU!

122
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,333
- OH, WENDY, YOU'RE
GOING TO CATCH COLD,

123
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,875
BEING OUT IN THIS MESS
WITHOUT AN UMBRELLA.

124
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,291
- THE SAME GOES FOR YOU.

125
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:54,500
CARLA? WHY ARE YOU SO MEAN
TO HAPPY AND THE REST OF THEM

126
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,041
AFTER ALL THEY'VE DONE FOR US?

127
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,750
COULD YOU AT LEAST TRY TO BE
A LITTLE BIT NICER TO EVERYONE?

128
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:02,625
- I DON'T SEE THE NEED FOR IT.
- HMM.

129
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,250
LONG AS I'M WITH YOU,
THEY'RE JUST COMPLICATIONS.

130
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,875
- GEEZ! I DON'T
UNDERSTAND YOU SOMETIMES.

131
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,041
- WHO'S THIS?

132
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,125
- HELLO, WENDY.

133
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,708
- WAIT? I KNOW THAT VOICE.

134
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,166
- ( gasping )

135
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,958
- I NEVER CONSIDERED THE CHANCE
YOU'D JOIN THIS GUILD.

136
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,375
- ( gasps ) JELLAL, IT'S YOU!

137
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,208
- ( lightning crashes )

138
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,750
- IMPOSSIBLE! I SAW YOU GET
TAKEN INTO CUSTODY MYSELF!

139
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,250
- THE MAN ARRESTED IN
THE NIRVANA INCIDENT WASN'T ME.

140
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,458
- WHAT? THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN
YOUR UNCANNY RESEMBLANCE?

141
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,375
- MY NAME IS MYSTOGAN
OF FAIRY TAIL.

142
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,000
WHEN WE FIRST MET...

143
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,041
SEVEN YEARS AGO,

144
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,791
I WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH THE
WAYS OF THIS WORLD.

145
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,875
I TOLD YOU MY NAME WAS JELLAL.

146
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,333
- ( both gasping )

147
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,458
- THIS WORLD?

148
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,958
- ( gasps ) YOU MEAN...

149
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,708
YOU'RE MY JELLAL!

150
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,666
I WAS AFRAID YOU HAD
FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT ME.

151
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,916
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE REALLY HERE.

152
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,500
- ( crying ) I MISSED YOU!

153
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,416
I WISH I'D DISOBEYED AND
KEPT FOLLOWING YOU BACK THEN!

154
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,208
- AND I WISH I'D BEEN
ABLE LET YOU FOLLOW ME.

155
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,583
- ( crying )

156
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,666
- I'M SORRY, BUT
WE DON'T HAVE TIME

157
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,666
FOR A TEARFUL REUNION RIGHT NOW.

158
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,125
- DO AS I SAY.

159
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,416
( groans )

160
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,833
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE THIS CITY
AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN!

161
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:58,750
- JELLAL!

162
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,666
- I WAS UNABLE TO
COMPLETE MY MISSION.

163
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,708
( gasps )

164
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,416
- ( thunder rumbling )

165
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,166
- ANIMA!

166
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,083
- WHAT? WHAT'D YOU SAY?

167
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,291
BUT WHY?
I WANT TO STAY WITH YOU!

168
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,708
- YOU CAN'T! IT'S TOO
DANGEROUS, ALL RIGHT?

169
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,166
THE ANIMA HAS GROWN
MUCH TOO LARGE.

170
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,625
AND NOW, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME
TO CONTAIN IT ON MY OWN.

171
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,416
- ( thunder rumbling )

172
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:38,333
- VERY SOON MAGNOLIA WILL
CEASE TO EXIST.

173
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,833
- NO, IT CAN'T JUST VANISH!

174
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,125
THERE HAS TO BE
SOMETHING WE CAN DO!

175
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,000
- I'M SORRY, WENDY.

176
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,375
BUT THE CITY'S DESTRUCTION
IS UNAVOIDABLE.

177
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,291
- ( gasps )

178
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,333
- YOU NEED TO EVACUATE.
RIGHT NOW.

179
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,875
- WHAT ABOUT EVERYONE
IN THE GUILD?

180
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,000
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEM?
TELL ME!

181
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,958
- Lucy: GEEZ! WE'RE GOING
TO BE STUCK IN HERE AWHILE.

182
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,083
- YEP.

183
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,458
- I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK
I CAUSED THIS.

184
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,916
- TRUST ME, YOU'RE NOT THE ONE
WHO'S ANNOYING EVERYBODY.

185
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,375
- ( snoring )

186
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,833
- KID SAWS LOGS WITH
THE BEST OF 'EM! IMPRESSIVE!

187
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,416
- I THINK I JUST FIGURED OUT
HOW I'M GOING TO PASS THE TIME!

188
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,958
- PLEASE! I WON'T MOVE
TILL YOU TELL ME!

189
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,166
- VERY SOON ALL OF THEM
WILL PERISH.

190
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,250
- NO! WENDY!

191
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,083
- SOMEONE'S GOTTA WARN THEM!

192
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,416
- THERE'S NO TIME FOR THAT!

193
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,666
YOU NEED TO GET TO
SAFETY IMMEDIATELY!

194
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,375
- I WOULD NEVER
ABANDON MY FRIENDS!

195
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,833
I HAVE A HOME AGAIN!

196
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,125
AND IF IT'S GOING TO VANISH,
THEN I'M GOING WITH IT!

197
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,041
- ( thunder rumbling )

198
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,708
- I THOUGHT SOMEONE
WITH YOUR TALENT

199
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,125
WOULD GO WITH SOMETHING
MORE CREATIVE THAN CAT WHISKERS.

200
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,375
- ALRIGHT THEN, IF IT'S
FINE ART YOU WANT...

201
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,666
- HOW COULD HE POSSIBLY
SLEEP THROUGH THAT?

202
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:32,500
- WHO'S READY TO BRAWL?
I'LL TAKE EVERYBODY ON!

203
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:36,416
- WOW, SHOCKER. I SHOULD'VE
KNOWN IT'D BE FOOD OR FIGHTING.

204
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,875
- YOU KNOW WHAT I SEE? A COUPLE
OF LAP DOGS BEGGING FOR A BONE!

205
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,541
AND YOU CALL YOURSELVES MEN?

206
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:43,958
- LOOK.

207
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,875
- OKAY, WHO'S THE MORON
DUMB ENOUGH TO DRAW ON MY FACE?

208
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,958
- ANY MINUTE NOW, HIS TINY BRAIN
WILL REMEMBER

209
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,375
THE ONE MAN DARING
ENOUGH TO DO IT.

210
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,583
- ( exclaims ) HOPE YOU'RE
HUNGRY, SNOWFLAKE!

211
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,541
- LISTEN, PANDA BOY,
IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE GRAFFITI,

212
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:57,875
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
HARASSED MY EARDRUMS

213
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,625
WITH YOUR OBNOXIOUS BEAR SNORE!

214
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,291
- YOU'RE GOING TO WISH
I'D STAYED ASLEEP!

215
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,875
- WHAT A VIEW! HE'S SO GALLANT!

216
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,041
LIKE A KNIGHT OF OLD FIGHTING
FOR HIS ONE TRUE LOVE!

217
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,333
- ( giggles )
RAINY DAYS ARE BEST SPENT

218
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,708
CUDDLING WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND!

219
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,250
- CANA, BE SURE TO LEAVE
ENOUGH OF YOUR "BOYFRIEND"

220
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,000
FOR THE OTHER CUSTOMERS, OKAY?

221
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,708
- HOLD ON. YOU'RE ACTUALLY
GOING OUT INTO THAT TYPHOON?

222
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:20,750
WHAT FOR?

223
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,750
- OH, PAYING A VISIT
TO THE CHURCH.

224
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,708
- YA THINK YOU CAN PROTECT LEVY
WHEN THE TIME COMES?

225
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,083
YOU NEED TO MAN UP
IN THE WORST POSSIBLE WAY!

226
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,291
- YES, SIR.
- WE GET THE MESSAGE.

227
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,458
- COME ON, ELFMAN!
WE SHOULD GET GOING!

228
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,208
- YEAH, I KNOW, JUST LET ME
FINISH WITH THESE SISSIES.

229
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,958
THEY SCREWED UP THEIR
MOST RECENT JOB

230
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,625
AND NEED TO BE TAUGHT A LESSON.

231
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,500
THESE MORONS GOT THEMSELVES
KNOCKED OUT COLD

232
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:42,666
IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT,

233
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,583
AND LEVY HAD TO
FINISH THE JOB BY HERSELF!

234
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,875
- STOP! I CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE!

235
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,958
- DON'T RUB IT IN.

236
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,541
- WELL I, FOR ONE,
THINK JET AND DROY

237
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,416
HAVE GOTTEN STRONGER RECENTLY!

238
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,416
- Both: GEE, THANKS, MIRA!

239
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,041
- IN THEIR OWN WAY...

240
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,333
- Both: SAY WHAT?

241
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:08,416
- AND WHAT ABOUT YOU? I DON'T
SUPPOSE YOU COULD CONVINCE HER?

242
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,208
- I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW.

243
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,250
- ( groans )

244
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,166
- HEY, DO YOU KNOW WHY MIRAJANE
AND ELFMAN WOULD SUDDENLY VISIT

245
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,916
A CHURCH IN THIS WEATHER?

246
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,125
- NOPE. NO CLUE.

247
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,791
- THE ANNIVERSARY OF
LISANNA'S DEATH IS COMING UP.

248
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,416
- I'VE HEARD THAT NAME.

249
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,583
- SHE WAS MIRA AND
ELFMAN'S SISTER, REMEMBER?

250
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:41,375
THEY ALL WENT ON A JOB TWO YEARS
AGO BUT SHE DIDN'T MAKE IT BACK.

251
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,583
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

252
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,333
EVERY TIME THE ANNIVERSARY
COMES AROUND,

253
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,458
THEY TEND TO SPEND
A LOT OF TIME AT THE CHURCH.

254
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,041
- WOW. I HAD NO IDEA.

255
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,875
- I NEVER REALLY
NOTICED IT BEFORE.

256
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,041
BUT, YOU KINDA REMIND
ME OF HER, LUCY.

257
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,416
- THAT'S COOL.

258
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,500
- IT'S 'CAUSE SHE'S
SO CLOSE TO NATSU.

259
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,125
- ( both panting )

260
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:07,958
- MAN, HOW MUCH PENT-UP ENERGY
DO YOU HAVE?

261
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,208
( exclaims ) HE'S
PASSED OUT ALREADY?

262
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,125
- AW...

263
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:15,041
I FORGOT NATSU HAD
A SPECIAL LITTLE GIRLFRIEND.

264
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,541
- WE NEED TO TALK. IT'S TIME YOU
LEARNED TO GRIP IT RIGHT.

265
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,208
QUIT FOOLING AROUND
AND JUST EAT IT, WOULD YA?

266
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,083
- THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO DO, GRAY,

267
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,083
BUT I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE.

268
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,916
- Both: CAN THEY
EVEN HEAR THEMSELVES?

269
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,208
- THIS IS HOW YOU EAT
A CARAMADE FRANK.

270
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:37,708
FIRST, YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH
WIDE AS YOU CAN, THEN CHOMP!

271
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,958
- ( muffled ) AM I
DOING IT RIGHT, MY LOVE?

272
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:43,083
- YEAH, WHO NEEDS SILVERWARE
WHEN YOU'VE GOT HANDS, RIGHT?

273
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,500
- COULD YOU PLEASE
KEEP YOUR CLOTHES ON

274
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,583
AT THE DINNER TABLE, DARLING?

275
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,250
- I WONDER IF I CAN LEARN TO
BE A LITTLE MORE FORWARD.

276
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,375
- MAYBE ONE DAY ME AND BISCA...

277
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:55,000
- SO, UM, IT'S RAINING
CATS AND DOGS, HUH?

278
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,500
- YEAH, NO END IN SIGHT.

279
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,208
- IT'S GOOD TO SEE THAT
YOU TWO ARE AS CLOSE AS EVER.

280
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,958
- WHAT? THAT'S CRAZY!
- WHAT HE SAID!

281
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,416
- TREASURE THESE MOMENTS
AS IF THEY WON'T RETURN.

282
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,041
DO THAT, AND YOU'LL
NEVER HAVE REGRETS.

283
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,500
- HEY, ERZA! WOULD YOU
COME HERE FOR A MOMENT?

284
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,333
- YES, MASTER?

285
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,833
- I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THAT CENTURY QUEST

286
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,250
GILDARTS WAS ON.

287
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,000
IT'S ALL I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT
FOR DAYS NOW.

288
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,125
I'M CONSIDERING GIVING IT
TO SOMEONE ELSE.

289
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,541
ANY OBJECTIONS?

290
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,416
- NO, MASTER, IT MUST BE DONE.

291
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,166
- UGH! IT'S SO BORING!

292
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,458
- IT'S HARD TO FEEL MOTIVATED

293
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,500
WHEN THE WEATHER'S GOT
YOU STUCK INSIDE.

294
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,375
- I WISH SOMETHING INTERESTING
WOULD HAPPEN TODAY.

295
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,333
- ( panting )

296
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,041
- ( thunder rumbling )

297
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,458
- ( exclaims )

298
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,708
- ( rumbling )

299
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:39,791
- IT'S THE ANIMA.

300
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,750
- GET OUT! SOMETHING BAD'S
HAPPENING! YOU HAVE TO LEAVE!

301
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,000
( gasping )

302
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,958
GET OUT! RIGHT NOW!

303
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,208
( screaming )

304
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,333
NO.

305
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,083
THE GUILD HALL...
IT'S GONE!

306
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:15,208
AND THE CITY...
ALL OF IT! WHERE'D IT GO?

307
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,208
BUT HOW? HOW CAN A CITY
VANISH LIKE THAT?

308
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,833
IS ANYBODY OUT THERE?

309
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,500
ANSWER ME!

310
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,208
( voice echoes )

311
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:34,875
NO.

312
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:40,041
THEY'RE GONE. I'M ALONE.

313
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,666
WHY AM I THE ONLY ONE
WHO GETS LEFT BEHIND?

314
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,583
( crying )

315
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,375
IS THERE SOME LAW OF
THE WORLD THAT SAYS

316
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,166
I CAN'T HAVE A HOME OR FAMILY?

317
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,833
DOES IT ALWAYS
HAVE TO BE THIS WAY?

318
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,583
- ( rustling )

319
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,541
- WHAT IS THAT?

320
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,458
- UH! THIS A DREAM?

321
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,333
- NATSU!
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

322
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,750
BUBBLES? WHOA!
WHERE ARE WE?

323
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,416
- THANK GOODNESS. I'M NOT ALONE!

324
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,958
NATSU, DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA WHAT HAPPENED?

325
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,375
- NOPE, NOT A CLUE.

326
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,291
- THIS IS ALL THAT'S LEFT.

327
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,833
- HUH?

328
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,958
- A GIANT HOLE
OPENED IN THE SKY.

329
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,083
THE GUILD HALL, THE TOWN,

330
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,208
AND EVERYONE ELSE GOT
SUCKED INTO IT!

331
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,041
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYONE!

332
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,833
I'M AFRAID YOU AND I
ARE THE ONLY ONES

333
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,000
WHO MADE IT OUT ALIVE!

334
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,833
- UH, WENDY, DON'T PANIC BUT
I THINK YOU MAY HAVE

335
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,375
A COUPLE OF LOOSE
MARBLES IN HERE.

336
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,333
- I DO NOT!

337
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,833
HOLD ON, YA THINK THE
TWO OF US WERE LEFT BEHIND

338
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,958
BECAUSE WE'RE DRAGON SLAYERS?

339
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,125
- THAT'S EXACTLY WHY.

340
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:52,583
- CARLA! YOU'RE SAFE!
I THOUGHT I'D LOST YOU.

341
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,333
- IN FACT, WE'RE LUCKY
YOU'RE A DRAGON SLAYER

342
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:58,875
OR YOU'D HAVE SUFFERED
THE SAME FATE AS THE OTHERS.

343
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,875
NOT THAT I CARE. ALL THAT
MATTERS TO ME

344
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,166
IS THAT YOU'RE ALIVE.

345
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,416
- CARLA.

346
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,208
- ALRIGHT, I CAN'T TAKE
YOUR ATTITUDE ANYMORE!

347
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,791
YOU'RE SAYING THE OTHERS
DISAPPEARING ISN'T IMPORTANT?

348
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,083
WAIT, THAT CRAZY STORY
YOU TOLD ME WAS TRUE?

349
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:15,083
( exclaims ) HELLO?
CAN ANYONE HEAR ME?

350
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:18,416
- DON'T WASTE YOUR BREATH.
THERE'S NO ONE LEFT TO HEAR YOU.

351
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,583
THEY'VE BEEN TAKEN BY THE ANIMA,
AND THEREFORE, NO LONGER EXIST.

352
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:23,583
- ANIMA?

353
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,541
- ANIMA!

354
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,208
- THAT GIANT HOLE IN THE SKY?

355
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,833
IT'S ACTUALLY THE
GATEWAY TO EDOLAS.

356
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,208
THE WORLD ON THE OTHER SIDE.

357
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,791
- EDOLAS?

358
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,333
- WOULD YA QUIT TALKIN'
NONSENSE ALREADY!

359
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:37,541
I DON'T UNDERSTAND A WORD!

360
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:38,708
TELL ME WHERE THEY WENT!

361
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,250
- CALM DOWN!

362
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,208
OKAY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS STUFF?

363
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,375
COME TO THINK OF IT,

364
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,250
WHY DIDN'T YOU GET TAKEN
BY THE STORM, TOO?

365
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,916
- WHAT HAPPENED, NATSU?

366
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,625
EVERYTHING WENT POOF!

367
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,541
I'M FREAKING OUT!

368
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:54,916
- HAPPY!

369
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,166
- I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE OKAY!

370
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,375
- THE REASON I APPEAR
SO INFORMED ABOUT EDOLAS

371
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:01,250
IS BECAUSE I AM FROM THERE.

372
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
- All: HUH?

373
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,958
- AS IS THE ONE
YOU CALL "HAPPY."

374
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,833
- WAIT, YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

375
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,750
- I'M SORRY, CHILD,
BUT IT'S TRUE.

376
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,583
THE TOMCAT AND I ARE TO
BLAME FOR THIS ATROCITY.

377
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:39,000
- ( theme song playing )

378
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,208
- ( singing in Japanese )

379
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:13,916
- Happy: LEMME ASK YOU, NATSU,

380
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,333
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED
IF THERE MIGHT BE

381
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:17,458
ANOTHER WORLD OUT THERE
THAT'S A LOT LIKE THIS ONE?

382
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,916
- Natsu: OH, YEAH! YOU MEAN
LIKE A "PARASOL WORLD," RIGHT?

383
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,125
- NO, "PARALLEL" WORLD.

384
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:24,375
ANYWAY, DON'T YOU THINK IT'D BE
CRAZY IF YOU WENT TO ONE

385
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:26,041
AND FOUND OUT YOU
WERE NEVER BORN?

386
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:27,958
OR WHAT IF YOU MEET YOURSELF
AND YOU'VE GOT THREE HEADS?

387
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:31,000
- WAIT A MINUTE, I THOUGHT WE
WERE TALKIN' ABOUT UMBRELLAS!

388
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,500
- ( Happy and Natsu reading )

389
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:35,000
- Happy: YA THINK THERE'S
A WORLD OUT THERE

390
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:36,458
WHERE I'M KING,
CARLA'S MY QUEEN,

391
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,041
AND WE EAT FISH ALL DAY?

392
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:41,000
- Natsu: MAYBE, BUT IF YOU GET
TO BE A KING, I GET TO BE A GOD!
