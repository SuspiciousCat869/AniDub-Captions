1
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,083
- Natsu: LISANNA!
WHERE DID YOU GO?

2
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,625
WOULD YOU QUIT PLAYING
AROUND ALREADY,

3
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,333
COME ON AND SAY SOMETHING.

4
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,666
OW. THIS STINKS.

5
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,791
- ( Lisanna screaming )

6
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:36,833
- LISANNA.

7
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,250
- ( theme song playing )

8
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:00,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

9
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,375
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

10
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,833
- JUST A DREAM.

11
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,166
- IF YOU'RE GONNA STEAL MY BED,

12
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,333
YOU COULD AT LEAST TRY
TO LOOK A LITTLE HAPPIER.

13
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,208
THAT'S IT, I'M DONE DOING
NICE THINGS FOR YOU.

14
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:27,625
I HAD TO SLEEP ON THE
COLD HARD FLOOR

15
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,250
AND THIS IS THE KIND OF
THANKS YOU GIVE ME?

16
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,875
- GEEZ, LUCY. DO YOU
HAVE TO BE SO LOUD

17
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,541
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING?

18
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,500
- IF YOU TWO ARE GONNA
KEEP FREELOADING OF ME,

19
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,000
I CAN BE AS LOUD AS I WANT,
WHENEVER I FEEL LIKE IT. OKAY?

20
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,458
- IT'S TOTALLY WORTH IT, THOUGH.

21
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,791
THIS BED IS LIKE A FLUFFY CLOUD
FLOATING OVER DREAMLAND.

22
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,041
- AYE!

23
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,708
- THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD
BUY ONE FOR YOURSELF.

24
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,208
- YOU WANNA GRAB SOME BREAKFAST?

25
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,375
- AYE.

26
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,875
- SO WHAT WERE YOU
DREAMING ABOUT?

27
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,166
- WHAT?

28
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,291
- YOU JUST WOKE UP FROM
A NIGHTMARE, DIDN'T YOU?

29
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,125
- Natsu: ( chuckles )
NOW I'M DREAMING ABOUT FOOD.

30
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,541
- Happy: AYE, SIR! - Lucy:
YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANY OF MINE.

31
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:01,583
- Happy: GILDARTS.

32
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:10,000
- GOTTA SAY, YOU TWO ARE LOOKING
RIGHT AT HOME AT FAIRY TAIL.

33
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,250
- YEAH.

34
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,291
- ACTUALLY, WE LIVE IN THE
GIRLS-ONLY DORM.

35
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,083
- HOW COME YOU DON'T LIVE
THERE TOO, LUCY?

36
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,208
IT'S REALLY NICE AND COZY.

37
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,916
- YEAH, WELL, I DIDN'T
FIND OUT ABOUT IT

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,500
UNTIL AFTER I GOT MY PLACE.

39
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:21,625
BESIDES, THE RENT
THERE IS LIKE

40
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,750
A HUNDRED THOUSAND
JEWEL A MONTH.

41
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,875
MY APARTMENT IS WAY MORE
AFFORDABLE AND I'M BROKE.

42
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,583
- ( chuckling )

43
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,500
- Both: BIG NEWS!

44
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,333
- ( church bells ringing )

45
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,916
- ( people gasping )

46
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:43,166
- WHAT'S UP?
- SOUNDS LIKE BELLS.

47
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,791
- I BET I KNOW WHY THEY'RE
RINGING. - AYE!

48
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,000
- YEAH.

49
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,166
- THAT'S AWESOME.

50
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,333
- THERE THEY GO.

51
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,791
- OH, MAN!
- KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS!

52
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,375
- OLD GILDARTS IS
COMING BACK HOME.

53
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,791
- OH YEAH!

54
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,625
- All: GILDARTS IS BACK!

55
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,541
- GILDARTS? WHO'S THAT?
ARE THEY IN A GUILD?

56
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,833
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER EVEN
HEARD OF THEM BEFORE.

57
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,458
- HE'S THE STRONGEST WIZARD
IN FAIRYTAIL.

58
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,500
- OH. ARE YOU SERIOUS?

59
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,500
I THOUGHT ERZA WAS
TOP DOG AROUND HERE.

60
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,250
- ALL MODESTY ASIDE, I DON'T
EVEN HOLD A CANDLE TO HIM.

61
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,000
- I'LL BET THAT THIS GUY MUST BE
THE KING OF BREAKING STUFF THEN.

62
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,625
- ( people cheering )

63
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,125
- WELL, IT'S GOOD HE'S BACK,

64
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,333
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
EVERYONE'S GOING TOTALLY NUTS.

65
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,083
- LOOK HOW HAPPY THEY ALL ARE!

66
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,458
- THEY'RE CERTAINLY MORE
OUT OF CONTROL THAN USUAL.

67
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,541
- IT'S ONLY NATURAL
EVERYONE'S EXCITED.

68
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:30,333
HE'S BEEN GONE QUITE A WHILE.
THREE YEARS IN FACT.

69
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,208
- THAT'S SO CRAZY.

70
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,125
SO WHAT HAS HE BEEN DOING?

71
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,625
- Mirajane: WELL, WE HAVE
REGULAR JOBS AND S-CLASS QUESTS.

72
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,291
ABOVE THOSE ARE SS-CLASS QUESTS.

73
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,625
AND ABOVE THOSE ARE JOBS
CALLED DECADE QUESTS.

74
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,791
- DECADE QUESTS?

75
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,083
- Erza: THEY'RE JOBS THAT
NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE

76
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,000
TO COMPLETE IN LESS
THAN TEN YEARS.

77
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,791
THUS, THE NAME, DECADE QUEST.

78
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,208
ACTUALLY, GILDARTS TOOK ON AN
EVEN HIGHER LEVEL JOB THAN THAT.

79
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,625
A CENTURY QUEST.

80
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,166
- Lucy: YOU'VE GOT TO
BE KIDDING!

81
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,916
WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND
WOULD TAKE ON A JOB

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,333
THAT LASTS A HUNDRED YEARS?

83
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,458
- HIM.

84
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,833
- GILDARTS IS BACK!

85
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,958
- EVERYBODY BETTER
GET READY FOR HIM!

86
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,583
- PREPARE TO COMMENCE MAGNOLIA'S
GILDARTS SHIFT.

87
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,041
CITIZENS, PLEASE TAKE YOUR

88
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,291
DESIGNATED POSITIONS
IMMEDIATELY.

89
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,916
- I'M ALL FOR FESTIVE,
BUT THIS IS JUST RIDICULOUS.

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,416
- THEY SURE ARE EXCITED.

91
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,791
- WHAT THE HECK IS A "MAGNOLIA
GILDARTS SHIFT," ANYWAY?

92
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,833
- STEP OUTSIDE AND
SEE FOR YOURSELF.

93
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,708
- ( bells ringing )

94
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,666
- ( rumbling )

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,583
- ( exclaiming )

96
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,375
- ARE WE HAVING AN EARTHQUAKE?

97
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:49,666
- MAGNOLIA JUST SPLIT IN TWO.

98
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,583
- A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE FOR
GILDARTS' CRASH MAGIC.

99
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,833
- SINCE HE DESTROYS EVERYTHING
THAT HE TOUCHES,

100
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,000
IT'S MUCH BETTER FOR
EVERYONE IF HE STAYS CLEAR

101
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,250
OF THEIR HOMES AND BUSINESSES.

102
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,541
- LIKE HE JUST WALKS RIGHT
THROUGH THEM?

103
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:03,083
YOU MODIFIED THE TOWN JUST
'CAUSE HE'S CLUMSY?

104
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,708
- Wendy: HE SOUNDS AMAZING!

105
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,416
- Carla: YES. AMAZINGLY STUPID.

106
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,291
- Natsu: HERE HE COMES!
- Happy: AYE!

107
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,708
- COME ON, YA OLD GEEZER,
LET'S THROW DOWN.

108
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,666
- THAT'S NO WAY TO TREAT A MAN.

109
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,041
- WELCOME HOME.

110
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,791
- HE'S THE MOST POWERFUL
GUY IN THE GUILD?

111
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,250
- SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, MISS.

112
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,000
BUT I'M LOOKING FOR A
GUILD THAT USED TO BE

113
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,416
AROUND THESE PARTS
CALLED FAIRY TAIL.

114
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,000
- THIS IS IT. REMEMBER ME?

115
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,000
MIRAJANE.

116
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,541
- HUH? MIRA?

117
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,333
WOW.

118
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,375
YOU SURE HAVE GROWN UP A LOT,
LITTLE GIRL.

119
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:03,416
AND DID YOU CHANGE SOME STUFF
AROUND THE HALL, TOO?

120
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,250
- HE DIDN'T NOTICE THAT
FROM OUTSIDE?

121
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,583
- GILDARTS!

122
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,458
- NATSU. HEY PAL.

123
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,125
THERE'S SOMEONE I RECOGNIZE.

124
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,083
- ( chuckling )

125
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,708
GOOD TO SEE YA.
NOW LET'S PARTY.

126
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,875
( exclaiming )

127
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,416
- NOT NOW, KID.

128
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:26,916
- ( chuckles ) OH YEAH.
HE'S STILL SO AWESOME.

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,958
- SAME OL' TOUGH GUY
WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN.

130
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,750
- GENUINE, OLD FASHIONED
MAN'S MAN.

131
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,708
- I SEE A COUPLE OF NEW FACES
AROUND HERE, TOO.

132
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,166
A LOT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS GONE.

133
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,625
- GILDARTS.

134
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,291
- OH, MASTER.
YOU'RE LOOKING WELL.

135
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,416
- HOW'D THE JOB GO?

136
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,333
- HMM.

137
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,625
( laughing )

138
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,666
- ( sighs )

139
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,541
- NO GOOD.
WAY TOO MUCH FOR ME.

140
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,125
- ( crowd gasping )

141
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,166
- NO WAY. BUT THAT'S GILDARTS.

142
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,541
- HE FAILED?
- HE'S JOKING, RIGHT?

143
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,958
- I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'D JUST
GIVE UP LIKE THIS.

144
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:09,375
- I GUESS IT TAKES A BIG MAN
TO ADMIT DEFEAT.

145
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,041
- THE CENTURY QUEST IS TOO MUCH
FOR EVEN THE STRONGEST

146
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,916
WIZARD IN FAIRY TAIL?

147
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,125
I WONDER WHAT IT TAKES TO
FINISH IT.

148
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,958
- I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING
OVER THERE AND YOU SHOULD STOP.

149
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,500
THERE'S NO WAY.

150
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,291
- Oh. I WASN'T THINKING ABOUT
ANYTHING AT ALL, I SWEAR.

151
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,666
MY MIND IS TOTALLY BLANK.

152
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,458
- I SEE.
THE JOB WAS TOO TOUGH.

153
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,333
- FORGIVE ME FOR BRINGING
SHAME TO THE GUILD.

154
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,208
- NO.

155
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,541
YOU'VE ONLY BROUGHT YOURSELF
BACK IN ONE PIECE.

156
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,541
THAT'S NO SMALL FEAT IN ITSELF.

157
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,250
AS FAR AS I KNOW,
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

158
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,083
WHO'S MADE THE
JOURNEY HOME ALIVE.

159
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,958
- ( chuckles )

160
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,041
THANKS, BOSS.
NOW I GOTTA GET BACK HOME

161
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,958
AND START TO ACTUALLY
FEEL ALIVE.

162
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,500
REST MY WEARY BONES.

163
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,833
OH, NATSU.

164
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:52,416
STOP BY LATER.
I BROUGHT SOMETHING BACK FOR YA.

165
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,000
WELL, I'M OUTTA HERE, YOU GUYS.

166
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,750
- ( crowd gasping )

167
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:02,916
- I WAS AFRAID OF THAT.

168
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,166
- YOU CAN USE THE FRONT DOOR,
YA KNOW?

169
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,208
- ( laughs ) WONDER WHAT
THE OLD MAN'S GOT FOR ME.

170
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,708
I'M FIRED UP JUST
THINKING ABOUT IT.

171
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,291
- ONE WALL BREAKER
AROUND HERE IS ENOUGH.

172
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,750
- OH MY GOODNESS.

173
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,958
- COME ON, HAPPY.
WE'RE OUTTA HERE TOO.

174
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,291
- Huh. ARE THIS GILDARTS GUY
AND NATSU, LIKE,

175
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,000
ESPECIALLY CLOSE OR SOMETHING?

176
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,166
- AYE. GILDARTS IS
ON A COMPLETELY

177
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,375
DIFFERENT LEVEL THAN NATSU,

178
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:27,750
BUT THEY'VE STILL BEEN
PRETTY GOOD FRIENDS

179
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,958
FOR AS LONG AS THEY'VE
KNOWN EACH OTHER.

180
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,541
- Lucy: OH YEAH? BUT ISN'T HE
GONE OUT ON QUESTS

181
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,125
MOST OF THE TIME?

182
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,041
- AYE.

183
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,625
BUT HE WAS AROUND ABOUT
THE TIME I WAS BORN,

184
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,208
SO I'VE KNOWN HIM MY WHOLE LIFE.

185
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,666
- Happy: WHEN DO I GET
MY FISHY-WISHY?

186
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,666
- Natsu: HOLD YOUR HORSES. I'M
JUST ABOUT TO LAND A HUGE ONE.

187
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,250
- Lisanna: THEY DON'T SEEM TO
BE BITING, DO THEY?

188
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:53,666
- Happy: SHE DIDN'T FISH, BUT
LISANNA WAS WITH US THAT DAY.

189
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,208
- WHAT DID I TELL YA?
- BRING THAT SUCKER IN.

190
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,291
- YES!

191
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,041
- IT'S TINY!

192
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,083
- IT'S SMALL,
BUT IT'LL FEED US, RIGHT?

193
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,000
- I GUESS, BUT THAT HUGE ONE
YOU WERE GONNA LAND

194
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,333
WOULD'VE FED US EVEN BETTER.

195
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:10,708
- I'LL GET A BIGGER ONE,
JUST NOT TODAY, OKAY?

196
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,833
- ( giggling )

197
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,625
- IT'S JUST LIKE WATCHING
A LITTLE KID ASKING HIS DAD

198
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,125
TO GIVE HIM A BETTER TOY.

199
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,958
- NO IT'S NOT,
'CUZ I'M NOT HIS DAD.

200
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,416
- I'D DEFINITELY NEVER
SEE HIM AS A FATHER FIGURE.

201
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,333
- WELL, I WOULDN'T
MIND BEING THE MOM,

202
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,000
BECAUSE THAT WOULD
MEAN I'M LIKE YOUR WIFE.

203
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:27,083
- DON'T START THAT AGAIN.
YOU AND ME AREN'T MARRIED, OKAY?

204
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,083
- THEN WHY ARE YOU
BLUSHING LIKE THAT?

205
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,208
IT'LL BE TRUE SOME DAY,
WON'T IT?

206
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,875
- NO IT WON'T, YA BIG DUMMY.

207
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,625
- YOU ARE JUST THE CUTEST
WHEN YOU'RE EMBARRASSED.

208
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,708
- OH, NATSU, SHE LOVES YOU.

209
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,750
- THAT IS GONNA
GET OLD REAL QUICK.

210
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,458
- ( snoring )

211
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,666
- SO TELL ME,
DO YOU EVER REMEMBER

212
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,041
ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR
MOM OR DAD, NATSU?

213
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,375
JUST CURIOUS.

214
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,791
MY BROTHER AND SISTER ARE SUPER
NICE AND TAKE GOOD CARE OF ME,

215
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,625
SO IT'S NOT LIKE I DON'T HAVE
A FAMILY OR ANYTHING.

216
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,500
BUT I WONDER WHAT IT'D BE LIKE.

217
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,333
JUST TO FEEL A PARENT'S WARMTH.

218
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,291
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

219
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,291
- DO YOU EVER FEEL THAT WAY?

220
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:14,500
- MAYBE. I MEAN I GUESS THAT
I KNEW IGNEEL'S WARMTH.

221
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:15,958
- YOUR DRAGON?

222
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,541
OH.

223
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,833
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

224
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,458
WHY? WHY DID HE LEAVE ME?

225
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,041
I TRIED REALLY HARD TO FIND HIM.

226
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,583
I LOOKED EVERYWHERE.

227
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,916
BUT IT WAS JUST NO USE AT ALL.

228
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,625
HE LEFT.

229
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,000
- IT'S SO SAD.

230
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,625
I ALMOST FORGOT TO TELL YOU,

231
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,958
I FOUND SOME GIANT FOOTPRINTS
ON THE EDGE OF THE EAST FOREST.

232
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,458
- WHAT? FOR REAL?

233
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,875
- YEAH. I'M NOT SURE IF
THEY WERE DRAGON TRACKS

234
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,666
BUT THEY SEEMED
BIG ENOUGH TO ME.

235
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,291
- ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO CHECK 'EM OUT!

236
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,208
- I DON'T KNOW,
THE SUN'S ABOUT TO SET.

237
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,791
- WHO THE HECK CARES.

238
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,791
I'LL GO BY MYSELF IF I GOTTA.
TELL ME WHERE YOU FOUND EM.

239
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,625
- WHAT'RE YOU YELLING ABOUT?

240
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,541
- I'LL GO TOO, OKAY?

241
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,208
I'LL SHOW YOU.

242
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,833
- OH YEAH.
I'M FIRED UP NOW.

243
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,250
- IT'S GETTING KINDA SCARY.

244
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,833
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

245
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,083
SO, DO YA SEE EM' OR WHAT?

246
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:28,083
- NOT YET, BUT I THINK WE'RE
GETTING PRETTY CLOSE TO 'EM.

247
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,333
RIGHT HERE.

248
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,625
- WOW, THOSE ARE FOOTPRINTS?

249
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,166
THEY'RE SO BIG.

250
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,791
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, NATSU?

251
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:40,083
- I THINK THESE ARE FROM
A FOREST VULCAN.

252
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:43,041
- HUH? ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT ONE OF THOSE BIG MONSTERS

253
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,500
LIKE THAT GORIAN YOU
FOUGHT THAT ONE TIME?

254
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,791
- ( sighs )

255
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,250
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN BETTER.

256
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,708
I MEAN, I LOOKED
ALL OVER FOR IGNEEL,

257
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:56,250
THERE'S NO WAY HE'D JUST HAPPEN
TO SHOW UP SO CLOSE BY.

258
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,416
- I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN
TO GET YOUR HOPES UP.

259
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,458
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

260
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,375
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

261
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,250
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
START HEADING HOME.

262
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,791
- MMM-HMM.

263
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:14,958
- WHERE IS HE?

264
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,541
WHERE DID IGNEEL GO?

265
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,875
- NATSU!
WAIT FOR ME.

266
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,208
( panting )

267
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,666
YOU'RE WALKING A LITTLE
TOO FAST FOR ME.

268
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,916
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

269
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,916
- IT'S GETTING SUPER FOGGY.

270
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,250
- YEAH, IT IS.

271
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:41,000
- HEY, SHOULDN'T WE WAIT AND
LET LISANNA CATCH UP?

272
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:44,458
- OH, YEAH.
HEY, COME ON, HURRY UP.

273
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,750
IS SHE STILL BACK THERE?

274
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,375
- I TOLD YOU WE SHOULD'VE
WAITED FOR HER.

275
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,041
- UH-OH. IF WORD GETS OUT
THAT I LOST HER OUT HERE,

276
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,958
I'M GONNA BE IN
SERIOUS TROUBLE.

277
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,666
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY FRIEND.

278
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,458
- GET READY FOR THE BEATING
OF YOUR LIFE, YOU LITTLE PUNK.

279
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,958
- MIRAJANE'S RIGHT.

280
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,916
THIS IS GOING TO BE
VERY PAINFUL.

281
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,708
- HOLD ON LISANNA,
I'M COMING FOR YA.

282
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,041
LISANNA.

283
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,708
WHERE DID YOU GO?

284
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,375
WOULD YOU QUIT PLAYING
AROUND ALREADY.

285
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,916
C'MON AND SAY SOMETHING.

286
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,250
OW. THIS STINKS.

287
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,250
- ( Lisanna screaming )

288
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,416
- ( laughing )

289
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,208
- THERE IT IS.

290
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,041
- LONG TIME, NO SEE,
YA LITTLE PUNK.

291
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,333
YOU AIN'T LOOKIN' FOR THIS,
ARE YOU?

292
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,666
- HELP ME.

293
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,625
- LISANNA! LET HER GO.

294
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,458
GET YOUR HANDS
OFF OF HER, MONKEY.

295
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,833
- NO WAY. YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW THINGS WORK

296
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,541
IN THE FOREST, DO YA KID?

297
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,666
FINDERS KEEPERS,
LOSERS WEEPERS.

298
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,166
- SHE ISN'T YOURS TO KEEP.
- YEAH.

299
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,875
- OH, I'M GONNA
KEEP HER ALRIGHT,

300
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:47,208
'CUZ IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT
I'VE BEEN LOOKIN' FOR A WIFE.

301
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,083
- A WIFE?

302
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,166
I DON'T THINK SO.

303
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,583
- YOU SEE,
THAT'S KINDA HOW I FEEL.

304
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,166
- OH, WOW. SCANDALOUS.

305
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,041
TRULY FORBIDDEN LOVE.

306
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,333
- I'M SORRY IF YOU FEEL
THAT WAY, MR VULCAN.

307
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,708
BUT MY HEART BELONGS TO MY
SWEET LITTLE NATSU.

308
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,708
- YEAH? WELL I SAY YOU'RE MINE,

309
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,958
SO THAT MEANS
YOU'RE MINE, OKAY?

310
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,375
- YOU DON'T MAKE THE
RULES AROUND HERE.

311
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,250
- YOU DISRESPECTED ME, KID.

312
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,958
SO I'M GONNA KEEP HER.

313
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,666
BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT HER BACK,
YOU SHOULD APOLOGIZE.

314
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,375
- NOW YOU'RE BLACKMAILING ME?

315
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,583
- NO. HE'S JUST
MESSING WITH YOU.

316
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,375
- SWALLOW YOUR PRIDE,
GET ON YOUR HANDS AND KNEES,

317
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,291
AND I'LL GIVE HER RIGHT BACK.

318
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,625
- ( sighs ) FINE.

319
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,125
- HE'S DOIN' IT?
- HE'S DOIN' IT?

320
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,708
- I'M SORRY ABOUT THE
WAY I TREATED YOU, SIR.

321
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,458
PLEASE GIVE LISANNA BACK.

322
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,583
- NATSU.

323
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,875
- IN YOUR DREAMS.

324
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,875
- NO! DON'T.
- THAT'S PLAYING DIRTY, YOU APE.

325
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,333
- ( laughs ) YOU JUST FELL FOR
THE OLDEST TRICK IN THE BOOK.

326
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,375
- THAT REALLY HURTS.

327
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,958
- OH YEAH! NOW I'M FIRED UP.

328
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:59,208
- PREPARE TO GET CRUSHED
LIKE THE LITTLE PEST YOU ARE.

329
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:08,291
- YOU REALLY ARE A NASTY,
STUPID MONKEY, YA KNOW?

330
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,583
- IT'S GILDARTS!

331
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,375
- WHO ARE YOU CALLING
NAMES, YA RUNT?

332
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,375
- I'LL JUST GET THIS
OUTTA THE WAY.

333
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,750
- LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU HOW THIS
THING IS GONNA GO FROM HERE.

334
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,708
YOU'RE GONNA LET GO OF THE GIRL,
TURN AROUND, AND WALK AWAY.

335
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,458
- I HEAR YA LOUD AND CLEAR.
I'M SORRY, SIR.

336
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,250
- THANKS A LOT!

337
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,458
- DO I KNOW YOU, LITTLE GIRL?

338
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,958
- YES, I'M LISANNA.

339
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:34,250
- I'LL BE, YOU'RE
MIRAJANE'S KID SISTER.

340
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:37,500
- NATSU, ARE YOU FEELING OKAY?
- YEAH.

341
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,541
- DOES ANYBODY ELSE SEE
A FLYING CAT OVER THERE,

342
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:40,791
OR AM I GOING NUTS?

343
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,750
- THAT'S JUST OUR NEWEST
GUILD MEMBER, HAPPY.

344
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,500
- SORRY, GILDARTS, BUT...

345
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,583
- YOU'VE GROWN UP TO
BE QUITE THE MAN, NATSU.

346
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:50,791
- HUH?

347
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,666
THERE'S A WHOLE LOT
MORE TO BEING A WIZARD

348
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,416
THAN JUST HAVING
MAGICAL POWER.

349
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,875
IT'S ABOUT HAVING GUTS

350
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,375
AND STANDING UP FOR THOSE
WHO CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES,

351
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,416
NO MATTER WHAT
THE ODDS MAY BE.

352
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,750
AND YOU'VE GOT GUTS.

353
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,833
- THANKS!

354
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,375
- BUT. I GUESS HAVING A WIFE

355
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,166
IS PRETTY MANLY TOO, HUH?

356
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,458
- SHE'S NOT MY WIFE.

357
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:14,333
- OH, DON'T BE EMBARRASSED.
- HE LOVES HER!

358
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,125
- ( Glidarts laughs )

359
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,708
- MAN, THIS FOG
IS LIKE PEA SOUP.

360
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,750
- IT TENDS TO GET THICK
THIS TIME OF YEAR.

361
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,416
SO WATCH YOUR STEP.

362
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,458
- IT'S SO MAGICAL,
LIKE WE'RE WALKING AROUND

363
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,333
ON A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
PLANET RIGHT NOW.

364
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,458
- YOU THINK SO?

365
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,541
- EARLIER WHEN YOU WERE
LOOKING FOR ME,

366
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,541
IT MADE ME FEEL SO GOOD
TO HEAR YOUR VOICE

367
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,458
CALLING OUT MY NAME
THROUGH ALL THE MURK AND FOG.

368
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,916
- HMM.
- HEY.

369
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,041
IF I EVER WENT MISSING
LIKE THAT AGAIN,

370
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,250
YOU'D GO LOOKING FOR ME,
WOULDN'T YOU?

371
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,666
YOU WOULDN'T JUST LET
ME STAY GONE, RIGHT?

372
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,541
- YEAH, OF COURSE.

373
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,958
- I KNEW YOU'D SAY YES.

374
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,083
- WHY NOT?

375
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,083
- COME BY TOMORROW, PAL.

376
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,916
WE'LL PLAY A LITTLE CATCH,
ALL RIGHT?

377
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,833
- OH YEAH!
I HOPE YOU'RE READY.

378
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,333
- ( Natsu grunting )

379
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,458
- LEMME ASK YOU. WHAT WERE
YOU DOIN' WALKIN' AROUND

380
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,833
THE EAST FOREST IN THE
DARK OF NIGHT, ANYWAY?

381
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,291
- I TOLD YA ABOUT IGNEEL BEFORE.

382
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,166
YOU REMEMBER, DON'T YA?

383
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,208
- YEAH. THAT'S THE RED DRAGON
YOU BEEN CHASING AFTER.

384
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,750
- LISANNA FOUND SOME FOOTPRINTS,
SO WE WENT TO LOOK FOR HIM.

385
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,833
BUT TURNS OUT,
SHE WAS DEAD WRONG.

386
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,291
- SORRY, MY BAD.

387
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,541
THIS IGNEEL,

388
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,541
I RECKON SEEING HIM AGAIN IS
PRETTY IMPORTANT

389
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:41,750
TO YA, ISN'T IT?

390
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,208
WITH GUTS LIKE YOU GOT,

391
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,083
I KNOW YOU'LL FIND HIM, KID.

392
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,375
- YEAH!

393
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,041
- NOW WHAT DO YOU SAY TO
DOIN' A LITTLE FISHIN'?

394
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,375
- GILDARTS IS REALLY NICE.

395
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,083
HE'S ALMOST LIKE
A FATHER TO HIM.

396
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,208
- AYE!

397
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:32,083
- WOW, MAYBE HE BROUGHT ME BACK
SOME KINDA RARE FIRE

398
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,166
FROM ANOTHER KINGDOM
OR SOMETHING.

399
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,458
- YEAH, WONDER WHAT IT IS.

400
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,708
- YO!
- WHAT'S UP, MAN?

401
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,541
- HEY, GOOD TO SEE YA.

402
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,375
- MAN, IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE WE'VE BEEN HERE.

403
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,208
- SEEMS LIKE IT'S BEEN FOREVER.

404
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,625
- SO, WHATCHA GOT FOR ME, POPS?

405
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,208
- NEVER MIND THAT.

406
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,583
HOW HAVE YOU AND LITTLE LISANNA
BEEN GETTING ALONG

407
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:53,000
SINCE I'VE BEEN GONE? HUH?

408
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,458
- WHAT?
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY COY.

409
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,791
( laughs )

410
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,291
- LISANNA DIED,

411
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,125
TWO YEARS AGO.

412
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,500
- ( gasps )

413
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,166
YOU'RE SERIOUS?

414
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,208
I SEE. THAT'S EXPLAINS
WHY MIRA...

415
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,625
MY CONDOLENCES.

416
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,166
- IF THAT'S ALL YOU WANNA
TALK ABOUT, I'M OUT.

417
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,875
- NATSU, WAIT.

418
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,000
- LISTEN, WHILE I WAS GONE,

419
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:23,916
I MET A DRAGON.

420
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,625
IT'S NOT THE ONE YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR, THOUGH.

421
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,125
IT WAS BLACK AS
A MOONLESS NIGHT.

422
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,125
- WHERE WAS IT?

423
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,875
- SACRED MT. ZONIA.

424
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,708
HE'S THE REAL REASON
WHY I FAILED ON MY QUEST.

425
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,375
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

426
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,958
- WELL, OBVIOUSLY,

427
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,250
I'LL ASK HIM IF HE
KNOWS WHERE IGNEEL IS.

428
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,958
- THINK AGAIN, KID.

429
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,041
THAT BLACK ONE'S
LONG GONE BY NOW.

430
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,625
HE'S OUT FLYING IN
THE WILD BLUE YONDER.

431
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:56,208
- I DON'T CARE, I CAN TRACK HIM
DOWN IF I PUT MY MIND TO IT.

432
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,750
- NATSU, LOOK AT ME.

433
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,375
IT WAS OVER BEFORE
I KNEW WHAT HIT ME.

434
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,083
IT RIPPED OFF MY ARM.

435
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,041
MY LEG, AND THEN IT GUTTED ME.

436
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,625
IGNEEL MAY BE A DIFFERENT
KIND OF CREATURE,

437
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:18,333
BUT I'M TELLING YOU THIS BLACK
ONE IS NO FRIEND TO ANYONE.

438
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,958
THERE'S NOT A MAN THAT
COULD BEAT HIM.

439
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,333
- LOOK, WE DRAGON SLAYERS
AREN'T JUST CALLED THAT

440
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,916
FOR NOTHING, YA KNOW.

441
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,583
THIS GUY DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF.

442
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:31,833
- IF THAT'S WHAT YOU BELIEVE,

443
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,666
I'M NOT GONNA TRY TO
STAND IN YOUR WAY.

444
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,625
- ( grunting )

445
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:39,750
GOOD!

446
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,291
- HOLD ON!
- HEY, CAT!

447
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:46,500
BETTER MAKE SURE TO
HAVE HIS BACK, ALL RIGHT?

448
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:49,875
THERE MIGHT NOT BE A MAN OUT
THERE THAT CAN BEAT THAT THING.

449
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,333
BUT, MAYBE A DRAGON CAN.

450
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:53,875
THERE'S HOPE FOR NATSU.

451
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,916
- ( sighs )

452
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,375
THERE ARE NOW THREE
DRAGON SLAYERS IN THIS GUILD.

453
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:10,208
PORLYUSICA, IT IS JUST
AS YOU FORETOLD.

454
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:13,000
WE ARE STANDING ON THE
CUSP OF A NEW ERA.

455
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,708
- COME ON. COME ON.
I GOTTA FIND HIM.

456
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,125
( exclaiming )

457
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:33,166
ARE YOU OUT THERE, IGNEEL?

458
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,625
DAD?

459
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:40,625
- ( theme song playing )

460
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

461
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,250
- Natsu: I'M SO BORED.

462
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,416
HEY, WHERE'D GAJEEL
RUN OFF TO?

463
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,833
ME AND HIM SHOULD FIGHT.

464
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:20,166
- Happy: BEING BORED IS
NO REASON TO FIGHT A GUY.

465
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,083
ANYWAY, IS IT JUST ME OR IS THE
SKY LOOKIN' REALLY WEIRD?

466
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:26,250
- Natsu: WHOA, YEAH. LOOKS LIKE
A STORM'S A BREWIN' FOR SURE!

467
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:27,916
- Happy: I HOPE THAT'S
ALL WE GET.

468
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,333
I'VE NEVER SEEN THE SKY
