1
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,916
[LYON] Their numbers
are too great for us.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
At this point, we can't even
get anywhere close to the city.

3
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:28,500
I know, but we have to take it
back to stave off the invasion.

4
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,375
Because if we don't,
they're going to keep on

5
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:33,500
sending ships full
of reinforcements.

6
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,583
[SHELIA]
We have to get the upper hand.

7
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,333
Oh, I wish Wendy were here.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,333
How lame!

9
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,708
You had a four-against-one
advantage,

10
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:49,458
and this is the best
you old farts can do?

11
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,083
My old friend.

12
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:55,208
Sadly, I'll never see
your smiling face again.

13
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,583
Huh?

14
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:01,041
[WARROD]
Yuri. Precht.

15
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:04,083
I'll be joining you very soon.

16
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:07,416
[GOD SERENA] I think
turning you into firewood

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,458
is going to be a lot
of fun, Warrod, no joke.

18
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,416
This does not bode well.

19
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,375
He took us down with
no help from the others.

20
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:19,458
I'm afraid going to Alvarez
has only made him stronger.

21
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:21,458
How can this be?

22
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:22,916
We've failed.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,666
We've sullied the name of
the Four Emperors of Ishgar.

24
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,958
Time to say God-bye-bye.

25
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:33,166
[WARROD]
Sorry, Mavis, this is farewell.

26
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,500
However...

27
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:37,416
As one of the founders
of Fairy Tail,

28
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,333
it's not in my nature
to go down quietly.

29
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:42,291
I will fight to the end!

30
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:46,583
God Serena.
I'm taking you with me!

31
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:22,416
[WARROD] God Serena.
I'm taking you with me!

32
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,875
[grunting]

33
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:33,000
[WOLFHEIM roars]

34
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:42,083
I see. You're not as
weak as I thought.

35
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,458
[gasps]

36
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,833
[GOD SERENA]
Hyberion!

37
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,500
Nice.

38
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,625
Vampiric magic.

39
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:58,333
Without any contact. Seems
he's earned his stature.

40
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,708
[HYBERION]
As I suspected,

41
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:11,666
your bluster exceeds your
abilities, God Serena.

42
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,250
[AUGUST]
No need to get involved.

43
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,000
Just be content to
stand back and watch.

44
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,291
This will be a delight.

45
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,875
All right! Cavern Dragon!

46
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,916
Earth Collapse!

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,625
[gasps]

48
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,708
[WARROD groaning]

49
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,541
[WOLFHEIM yells]

50
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:41,666
What is this? Earth
Dragon Slayer magic?

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,083
There's more.

52
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:49,000
Purgatory Dragon:
Blazing Inferno!

53
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:53,541
Mighty Sea King Dragon:
Water Vortex!

54
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,000
Fire and water?

55
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,791
I've got Tempest
Dragon magic, too.

56
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,458
More elements?

57
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:03,333
[AUGUST]
You've done enough, God Serena.

58
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,916
[GOD SERENA] Whoops.
Seems I had too much fun.

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,333
Seeing him in action
was a delight indeed.

60
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,083
A Dragon Slayer with
eight dragon lacrimas.

61
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,250
Puts on a hell of a show.

62
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,583
The Hybrid Theory personified.

63
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,916
He is a man favored by
the god of dragons.

64
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,416
[chuckles]

65
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,416
There aren't any gods or kings
when it comes to dragons.

66
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,458
How could there be when none
can even compare to my power?

67
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,250
[AUGUST]
With those four bested,

68
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,791
let us continue
onward to Fairy Tail.

69
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:43,708
[WARROD]
They'll destroy everything,

70
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,125
leaving only death
in their wake.

71
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,500
But who can stop them?

72
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:54,583
[gasps]

73
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,000
[WARROD]
Wait. What is this presence?

74
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,791
This power?

75
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,875
Who is that approaching?

76
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,083
I smell the putrid
stench of a dragon.

77
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,583
[AUGUST]
Acnologia.

78
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,791
[grunts]

79
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,791
So you've come to me,
aren't I lucky?

80
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:28,208
I left Ishgar behind with the
dream of killing you, so--

81
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,750
[gasps]

82
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,791
[gasps]

83
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,500
[groaning]

84
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,625
[ACNOLOGIA] Only seven
more dragons remaining.

85
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,750
I will slay them all.

86
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:03,666
That's him. That's Acnologia.

87
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,208
[AUGUST]
Calm down.

88
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,875
You'd be dead before
you hit the ground.

89
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,250
[AUGUST] Perhaps His Majesty
could defeat him,

90
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,000
once he's acquired
the Fairy Heart.

91
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:19,500
[AUGUST]
Let us make haste to Fairy Tail.

92
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:23,250
So we may help secure
his extraordinary prize.

93
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,666
[footsteps]

94
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,458
How's his condition?

95
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:48,458
Can't tell. He hasn't
woken up yet.

96
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,791
Have you checked on
Bixlow and Evergreen?

97
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,958
Yes, they're feeling
much better.

98
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,333
[LUCY]
I'm happy to hear it.

99
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:57,583
If anyone's curious,
I should recover, too.

100
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,708
[FRIED] Do you happen
to know where Laxus is?

101
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,166
I think he left town
with Erza's team.

102
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,833
They're going to go
liberate Hargeon.

103
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,791
Gray and Wendy went with them.

104
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:11,000
I see. I hope he's not reckless.

105
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,666
[LUCY]
And how likely is that?

106
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,833
[FRIED]
Touché.

107
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,875
Caution? Not his style.

108
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:26,875
[ICHIYA] A man who dives
headlong into danger.

109
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,625
Man.

110
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,666
We'll reach Hargeon by morning.

111
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,000
So get all the rest
you can tonight.

112
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,208
Okay.

113
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,333
And you'd be wise to
take your own advice.

114
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,000
Wendy has better things
to do than play nurse.

115
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,208
Gray, my darling!

116
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,750
Aren't you glad I
brought my special

117
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,375
two-person sleeping bag
with me on this trip?

118
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,541
No way I'm gettin'
in that thing!

119
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,666
Juvie!

120
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,083
Feel like I haven't
seen Laxus in a while.

121
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,416
Earlier he said he was hungry
and he ambled towards the woods.

122
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,083
He's prob'ly off tryin'
to eat a bear or somethin'.

123
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,208
Think so?

124
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,958
Are bears tasty?

125
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,500
[WENDY]
Uh. You're drooling.

126
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:11,541
[LAXUS grunting]

127
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,958
[GRAY]
When did it start?

128
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,500
[LAXUS]
None of your damn business.

129
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,333
[GRAY]
Come on, man, we're guild mates.

130
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,458
I'm askin' as a friend.

131
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,375
[GRAY]
I'd guess a year ago?

132
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:36,458
Right when you got a double
lung full of Bane Particles?

133
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,041
That sound right?

134
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,875
[LAXUS sighs]

00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,500

He's not human!

[TEMPESTER yelling]

138
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,000

[TEMPESTER yelling]

140
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,833
Stand still. Coward.

141
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:23,333
Is this still enough for ya?

142
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,875
Lightning Dragon Jaw!

143
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,833
[TEMPESTER] A great number
of people are about to die.

144
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,208
And we'll be the first.

145
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,833
[LAXUS]
No one else is gonna die here!

146
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,666
Not while I'm around!

147
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,875
[FRIED]
Laxus. Shield your mouth!

148
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,625
[FRIED]
What are you doing?

149
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,625
[LAXUS] That's twice you've
misjudged me, "Disaster."

150
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,708
First you underestimated
the strength of my magic,

151
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:26,333
now you've done the
same with my lungs.

152
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:29,291
[FRIED] Please stop.
You'll kill yourself!

153
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,541
No way you're talkin'
me outta this.

154
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,333
But you can make sure
they get home safe.

155
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,791
Not one word.

156
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:50,833
Okay, this is between us.
Enough with the death glare.

157
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:51,833
[LAXUS sighs]

158
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:52,916
[LAXUS]
It's nothing.

159
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,291
Just bothers me every
once in a while.

160
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,458
Don't worry about it.

161
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:58,791
[GRAY]
Hm.

162
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,333
[LAXUS]
Tch.

163
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:12,666
I'm gonna protect the guild,
up until the battle is over.

164
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,750
Even if it kills me.

165
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,500
[LAXUS]
Get dressed, damn it!

166
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,000
Aw, man! Sorry about that!

167
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,416
[LEVY]
Hey, Gajeel.

168
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,000
Trouble sleeping?

169
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,416
Yeah. Guess I'm
not the only one.

170
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,458
I'm worried.

171
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,916
It feels like there's
a good chance

172
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,458
we're not gonna make
it back from this one.

173
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,583
We've said it before,

174
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,125
but there's something
different about this enemy.

175
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,375
I'm scared.

176
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,125
And I'm not nearly as
strong as everyone else.

177
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:06,083
Is this gonna be the end
of the story for us?

178
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:09,958
[gasping] What the--?

179
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,750
Gajeel!

180
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,375
You're under arrest
for self-doubt.

181
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,458
Sorry.

182
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,500
[GAJEEL] Ya know what
that means, don't ya?

183
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,791
I'm gonna throw your butt
in a guild hall cell

184
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,708
when we get back.

185
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:07,041
[WIZARDS yelling]

186
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,625
Today we will take back Hargeon!

187
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,041
Drive them out!

188
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,500
I rattled her yesterday,
but look at her now.

189
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:16,750
All fired up.

190
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,541
[WALL laughs]

191
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:22,125
Still though, I think I'll play
with someone else today.

192
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:27,541
Now Sky God... Boreas!

193
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:28,958
[SOLDIER A]
Who's that little shrimp?

194
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,916
[SOLDIER B]
She's pretty tough!

195
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,083
And Sky God--

196
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,916
I'm claiming this
little one for myself.

197
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,291
No please! Don't do this!

198
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,833
[DIMARIA] You're just
getting me more excited.

199
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:48,791
You want me to do to you
what I did to your friend?

200
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,291
[SHELIA growls]

201
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,583
[DIMARIA] Too bad, because
today is going to be different.

202
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:53,958
[gasps]

203
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:57,166
Let's see. You're
a healer, right?

204
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,708
Well, that means
I can't let you live.

205
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,291
[gasps]

206
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,041
[gasps] Wendy, it's you!

207
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,166
Sorry I got here late.

208
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,666
But the Sky Sisters
are back in action!

209
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:19,041
[DIMARIA] That brat...
kicked me in the face.

210
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,000
Ice Make Eagle.

211
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:32,750
If I can pull that off a couple
thousand more times, we're good.

212
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,000
[GRAY]
Lyon!

213
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,500
We're headed for the front line!

214
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,208
Let's send them back home!

215
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,916
Juvia? And Gray?

216
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,875
It's now or never, guys!
This is our chance!

217
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,291
[LYON] Whoa! She's
practically glowing!

218
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,333
[gasps]

219
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,333
What the hell are
you doing here?

220
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,833
[ERZA] This was our
battle from the start!

221
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:59,291
We never expected
another guild to butt in.

222
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,125
But here you are!

223
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,625
So thank you!

224
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,333
Erza!

225
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,583
Let's get moving!

226
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,958
Right.

227
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,250
[WALL]
Wow.

228
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:18,666
So Fairy Tail actually decided
to bring the fight to us.

229
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,958
Huh?

230
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,250
[growls]

231
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,666
You're the one who messed
with the Thunder Legion?

232
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,666
Never heard of 'em!

233
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,166
[WALL screams]

234
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,583
They're my friends, you freak!

235
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,833
Ah.

236
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:54,666
Alchemizing copper and zinc,
nine-millimeter rounds.

237
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,000
Fire!

238
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,041
That lightning?

239
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:10,375
We get that kinda weather
back in Magnolia.

240
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:13,458
Sunny with a chance of Laxus.

241
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,500
And plenty of ice
in the forecast!

242
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:24,083
Not bad, big guy!
What makes you tick?

243
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,333
A quick analysis.

244
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,125
[WALL]
Huh?

245
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,125
Your organs are
in quite a state.

246
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,458
Tch.

247
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,333
What's your secret?

248
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,458
I honestly wanna know
how you're alive.

249
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,791
I mean, are you actually human?

250
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,750
It's not about "how I'm alive."

251
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,000
It's "how I live"!

252
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,333
So profound.

253
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,041
You people really
enjoy showing off

254
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:55,458
your pithy wordplay, don't you?

255
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:59,791
And for your information,
lightning doesn't work on me.

256
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,458
[WALL laughing]

257
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,708
So the conversation needs to
shift to "how you'll die."

258
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:17,833
Erza, this way!

259
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,916
But what about all
the enemies here?

260
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,125
[KAGURA] My guild mates
can handle them.

261
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,625
We have to get to the port!

262
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,166
[ERZA]
What's the situation?

263
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,791
[KAGURA]
Two of the Twelve are in town.

264
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,541
The swordswoman and
the Machias alchemist.

265
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,041
But there's one more
who's not left their ship.

266
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,750
It's up to the two of
us to dispose of them.

267
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,083
Right!

268
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,375
[CARLA] You're underdressed
for the battlefield.

269
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,666
Here. Wendy's jacket
should fit you.

270
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,000
I appreciate it, thank you.

271
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:50,125
[SHELIA]
Wow, it's really tight.

272
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:53,875
I'm sorry, little girls.
But do you realize where we are?

273
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,291
Careful, Wendy.

274
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:58,625
I can't quite figure out what
kind of magic she uses.

275
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,541
[DIMARIA]
At least the one with the tail

276
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,041
knows it's a battlefield,
not a playground.

277
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:07,166
Hargeon used to be a place
where children could play.

278
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,916
Till you got here!

279
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,375
We're gonna make you leave!

280
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,583
So the people here
can live in peace!

281
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:13,875
[DIMARIA]
I don't care if you're kids,

282
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,041
I show mercy to no one.

283
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:19,375
The truth is, I could kill you
in the blink of an eye.

284
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,375
You wouldn't even
know what hit you!

285
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,625
Get ready, girls!

286
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,791
[DIMARIA] A split second
would last an eternity.

287
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,083
[WALL]
Analysis complete.

288
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,833
His innards are swimming
with Bane Particles,

289
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,166
but his magic power level

290
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,166
is one of the highest
in Fairy Tail.

291
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,875
I can't maintain
the upper hand

292
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:59,458
on my current "prankster"
personality setting.

293
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:02,583
So I'll set my program
to "coldhearted."

294

Enhanced exoskeleton
assault mode.

Designating Laxus
as sole target.

Locked on.

297
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,291
Magic fusion reactor ignited.

298
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:16,416
Estimated time to complete
target elimination, 90 seconds.

00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,833

[ERZA gasps]

301
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:28,916
What now?

The sky is on fire?

Oh, no! Electrical attacks
only feed his magic power.

But they don't affect me at all!

00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,208
threaten to stop him.

325
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:43,000
But can he pull off
one last ditch attack

326
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,416
that tears down Wall for good?

327
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,791
To the east of Magnolia,

328
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:49,125
Wendy and Shelia face
off against Dimaria,

329
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:52,750
the Warrior Queen, and the
odds are not in their favor.

330
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:56,458
But out of nowhere,
a familiar face appears,

331
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:58,875
a witch standing before them!

332
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:02,208
Next Time: "In a Silent Time."

333
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,166
Waiting somewhere
inside eternity,

334
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,000
the traveler of eras
smiles quietly.
