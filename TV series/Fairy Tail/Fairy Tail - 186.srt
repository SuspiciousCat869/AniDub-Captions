[KAGURA] The man
whose will I speak of?

2
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,791
It turns out you
knew him very well.

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,125
His name was Simon
and Jellal killed him.

4
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,083
He was my brother.

5
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,000
[ERZA] Simon...

6
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,166
[ERZA] You're his sister?!

7
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,541
[ERZA] I can see
why you thought Jellal

8
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,750
was responsible for
your brother's death.

9
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,958
It would be easy to let you
go on believing that, but...

10
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,041
...I'm the one to blame.

[NARRATOR]
After successfully defeating

00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,708
the Hungry Wolf Knights,

17
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,916
Natsu and the others
came face to face

18
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,166
with another Lucy,
who had come from the future.

19
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,541
How did this Lucy manage
to travel back in time?

20
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,333
For what purpose?

21
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,791
What sort of future
has she come from?

22
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:17,208
And what does Princess Hisui
of Fiore hope to achieve

23
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,250
by opening the Eclipse
door and using its power

24
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,958
over the passages of time?

[NARRATOR] At this point,

[NATSU]
Oh, come on! Another door?!

29
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,375
How many more 'exits'
are we gonna go through?

30
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,791
For that matter,
how do we know

31
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,875
we haven't been making
circles this whole time?

32
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:46,875
[WENDY]
There are wind drafts blowing

33
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,625
from almost every direction.

00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,041
I can't tell
which one goes outside.

[LOKE] The big guy isn't
gonna last much longer...

36
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,416
If we could get in
touch with the others,

37
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,833
none of this would be a problem.

38
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,041
Just our luck.

39
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,625
I'd give anything to
hear Warren in my head,

40
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,250
and I don't say that very often.

41
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,041
We just have to hope
our luck will change

42
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,666
and keep looking
for a way out of here.

43
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,083
[PANTHERLILY]
And if it doesn't change,

44
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,958
we could all be stuck
wandering down here forever.

45
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,125
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,541
We wouldn't be stuck down here

47
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,916
if I was more acquainted
with the layout of the castle.

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,375
Hey, don't sweat it!
No one here blames you.

Whatever, let's just
keep on moving.

50

This place sure ain't helping
Future Lucy feel better.

[WENDY] You're right.

I completely understand
your apprehension.

56
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,458
I realize
how absurd it sounds.

57
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,166
We're deciding
the fate of this world

58
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,125
based on the
outcome of the games.

59
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,666
Truth be told,

60
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,750
I would prefer if we had more
time to study the situation

61
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:49,958
in detail.

62
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,208
[HISUI] The lives and futures
of everyone in this kingdom

hang in the balance.

64
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:58,666
And yet,

65
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,500
I have nothing
to base my decision on

66
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,916
but the word of a single person.

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,750
At first, I thought
they were insane

68
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,875
claiming to be from the future.

69
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:10,208
But as I began to listen,
the pieces came together.

70
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,000
And now, there is
just one more thing

71
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,375
that will validate
their predictions.

72
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:18,250
And if it comes to pass,
we will face certain doom.

73
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:22,541
I pray that their claims
will prove to be untrue,

74
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,916
or else calamity may
soon be at our doorstep.

75
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,875
[WENDY] How does it look, Lucy?

76
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,291
I think the coast
is clear. Let's go.

Right!

How do you think the
Grand Magic Games are going?

79

I'm sure our guys are
pulling their own weight.

Sucks that we're
down here missing it.

00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,291
with a wing-plucked
fairy for dessert.

162
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,875
How scrumptious.

163
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,458
[MINERVA laughing evilly]

164
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,666
You'll pay for that.

165
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,458
I'd like to see you make me,

166
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,000
especially when you're
so obviously wounded.

167
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,208
That'd be an amusing trick.

168
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,208
[KAGURA] Millianna... Please...

169
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:52,000
You have to... save her.

170
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,458
I will.

171
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,458
Who's Millianna?

172
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,333
Oh, the little kitten.

173
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,958
As you can see, she's
already down and out.

174
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,250
I believe I've
earned another point!

175
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:14,250
Sabertooth's total
just jumped to fifty-five!

176
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,708
[MATO] Fairy Tail keeps falling
further and further behind!

177
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,375
A five-point gap.

178
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:22,375
That'll be difficult
to come back from.

179
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,125
Please, talk to me!

180
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:30,708
Erzy? S'that you?

181
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,291
Stay with me! Millianna!

182
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,166
[ERZA] What the hell is this?

183
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,750
Frankly, the two of you
were beginning to bore me.

184
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,666
I needed to do something
to entertain myself.

185
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,291
Her screams were quite lovely.

186
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,000
Bad move.

187
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,791
They're both down.
This is horrible!

188
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,625
We gotta do something, quick!

189
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,833
They need medical help! Hurry!

190
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,583
[CHAPATI] All of
Mermaid Heel's competitors

191
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,000
are now out of the match,

192
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,375
leaving Erza and Minerva
to battle it out,

193
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,583
one on one!

194
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:14,750
[MATO] It'll be tough.

195
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,125
Erza's covered in
wounds from head to toe!

196
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:20,291
And Minerva's come out
of this as fresh as a daisy.

197
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,625
[CHAPATI] It's down to
the Queen of the Fairies

198
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,166
versus the Queen of the Tigers!

199
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,333
[NARRATOR] Erza and Minerva
aren't the only combatants

200
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,875
still in the final match.

201
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,250
While many have fallen,

202
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,416
there are other
intense wizard battles

203
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,333
erupting over every corner
of Fiore's capital city.

204
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,916
[groaning in pain]

205
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:05,375
[yelling]

206
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,750
Well, this got
boring in a hurry.

207
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,125
You're just wasting
my time, kid.

208
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,666
I'm outta here.

209
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,166
[ROGUE] You don't scare me.

210
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,666
You aren't even as
strong as Natsu Dragneel.

211
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,708
The hell you say?

212
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:53,416
'Lightning God Slayer'
Olga, s'that right?

213
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,291
Catchy name.

214
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,833
[OLGA chuckling]

215
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,000
Am I supposed to be
flattered or something?

216
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,416
Come on.

217
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,875
What? I thought all you
Saber-punks liked lip service.

218
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,208
I mean, with a name like that,

219
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,791
your lightning's gotta
be something to behold.

220
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:12,541
Sorry, but second-best
is all it's ever gonna be.

221
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,041
[OLGA]
Are you saying yours is best?

222
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,916
That's some bold talk,
coming from a Fairy.

223
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,583
There's always
someone better than you.

224
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,375
Having your face
shoved in the gravel

225
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,166
is a good way to learn that.

226
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,375
Bring it on!

227
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,500
Let's see whose
lightning comes out on top.

228
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:31,583
Grit your teeth!

229
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,416
'Cause here comes
the first strike!

230
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,083
What's the matter?

231
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:47,666
Don't tell me the great Laxus
is so terrified he can't move.

232
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,541
Come on, we both know
you weren't really gonna hit me.

233
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:54,041
You've got a lot to learn about
the art of intimidation, pal.

234
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,541
[yelling]

235
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,916
That was pretty impressive.

236
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,708
Now who's being flattering?

237
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,333
Are we doing this
sometime today?

238
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,458
I can't be stuck playing
grab ass out here forever.

239
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:28,833
[yelling]

240
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,041
[JURA] My, my...

241
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:03,041
I was hoping to come across
some capable warriors.

242
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,250
The Wizard Saint, Jura!

243
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,833
The monster's here...

244
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,416
This should be good.

245
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,375
I won't let you snare
Lyon with your wiles!

246
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,791
I told you,
I only have eyes for Gray!

247
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,291
[LYON] To think that she's
giving Shelia this much trouble.

248
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,916
That's my Juvia!

249
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,583
[GRAY] Man, Not this
crap again! Come on!

250
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,625
--[SHELIA] Hi, Lyon!
--[JUVIA] Darling!

251
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,583
What happened to you, Gray?
You're looking a little rough.

252
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,083
I was just taking care
of some unfinished business;

253
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,583
you know how it is.

254
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,666
Juvia.

255
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,708
Yes?

256
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,541
[GRAY]
Let's take 'em out together!

257
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,083
[GRAY]
Let's take 'em out together.

258
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,875
[GRAY] Together, my love...

259
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,250
[GRAY]
We'll be together forever.

260
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,291
I've got just the spot
for our honeymoon, my darling.

261
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,708
What crazy nonsense
are you on about now?!

262
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,583
Damnit! I've got to bring
dear Juvia to her senses!

263
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,458
You're the one who needs
to come to his senses, Lyon.

264
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,541
This is so lame.

265
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,375
It's just one
maze after another.

266
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,041
It's quite a dilemma...

267
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,750
If I had only known
this was going to happen,

268
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,000
I could have memorized
the castle's floor plan.

269
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,250
You shouldn't feel bad.

270
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,791
Master Makarov and
the rest of the guild

271
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,416
must be worried sick by now,
so we need to get out quickly.

272
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,541
Aye.

273
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:35,708
We need to tell them
about the Eclipse

274
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,458
and the Lucy from
the future, too!

275
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:38,625
Why don't we
just charge through

276
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,250
all their soldiers
and be done with it?

277
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,416
We can't!
We have injured with us.

278
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,791
I bet the rest of us
could pull it off

279
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,375
if we work together!

280
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,791
No, there's more
to it than that.

281
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,250
Don't forget,

282
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,708
Fairy Tail's still competing
in the Grand Magic Games.

283
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,708
And it's a
kingdom-sponsored event.

284
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,625
If we go taking out
their Royal Army,

285
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,166
they might disqualify our
guild from the tournament.

286
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,666
Considering we took
out their execution squad,

287
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,375
it might be too late...

288
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,791
She does have a point.

289
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,875
Maybe we should have gone
a little easier on them...

290
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,375
I mean, when you take
time to think about it,

291
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:08,791
they weren't actually bad guys;

292
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,250
they were just doing their jobs.

293
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,000
Still, given the circumstances,

294
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,958
we didn't really
have another choice.

295
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,166
The fact of the matter is

296
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,958
that they were sent
down there to kill us...

297
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,125
I'd say just taking them
outta commission for a while

298
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,666
was going easy on 'em.

299
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:22,833
Hey there.

300
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,791
Don't look so worried;
it'll be fine.

301
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,208
Even if there
are two of you now,

302
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,916
I'm enough of a man to share
my love with both of you!

303
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,125
You're as clueless
as the tomcat...

304
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,833
[HAPPY] Hey, Lucy.
You feeling any better?

305
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:39,791
Where are we?

306
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,125
Not sure.

307
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,250
[MIRAJANE] It looks like
the castle's dining hall.

308
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,208
[FUTURE LUCY]
We're still inside the castle?

309
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,375
From what I
remember from last time,

310
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,916
after we escape
the Palace of Perdition,

311
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,416
we end up getting caught
by the royal army again.

312
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,041
That's why I rushed here
as soon as I was able to.

313
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,958
I was hoping that I could
warn you beforehand.

314
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,833
But luck abandoned me.

315
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,791
Just like it always does.

316
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,166
[FUTURE LUCY]
To make matters worse,

317
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,958
we're going to be stuck
behind bars until it happens.

318
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,750
[HAPPY] Whaddya mean "it"?

319
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,458
So these events are
in our immediate future?

320
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,833
Quite ominous indeed.

321
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,166
Don't be a downer!

322
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,208
Now that we know, there's
no way they'll catch us.

323
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,291
Yeah!

324
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,333
I can't see them
being a problem for us.

325
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,291
While we were making
our escape last time,

326
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,583
we got too close
to the Eclipse gate.

327
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,208
As a result, we lost
all of our magic power.

328
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:39,291
We were thrown into
a dungeon soon afterward.

329
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:42,041
Our future selves
sound like total morons.

330
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,166
So, uh...

331
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,791
What made you decide
to risk your life

332
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,125
and come here from the future?

333
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,333
For real.
What's this all about?

334
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,583
Why'd you come back
in the first place?

335
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,833
[FUTURE LUCY] To change
the horror that is my past.

336
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,125
[NATSU]
What happened that was so bad?

337
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,958
Tell us.
Maybe we can help,

338
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,125
and at least you won't
have to do it alone.

339
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,750
Okay...

340
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,666
I haven't disclosed
all the details to you yet.

341
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,666
It's almost too much
for me to comprehend.

342
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,041
Pure terror...

343
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,791
[HISUI] A swarm of over
ten thousand dragons

344
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,708
will assail the kingdom.

345
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:43,458
[DRAGONS roaring]

346
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,833
The city will burn,
the castle will fall,

347
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:58,416
and countless lives
will be lost.

348
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,500
Are those words true?

349
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:02,625
I don't know.

350
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,041
Regardless...

351
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,250
[HISUI] The decision rests
squarely on my shoulders.

352
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:13,250
And the echoes of
this one decision

353
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,125
will reverberate
throughout the rest of time.

354
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,125
[NATSU] Ten thousand dragons?!

355
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:16,750
I guess something serious
goes down in the future.

356
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:18,250
[HAPPY] What do we do, Natsu?!

357
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,500
[NATSU] Oh! Oh! Happy!

358
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,833
I just figured out
how we'll fix this!

359
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:23,166
[HAPPY] Yeah?
Well, forgive me,

360
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,291
but I don't have very high
hopes about your plan.

361
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,125
[NATSU] Just hear me out!

362
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:27,750
This is legit! Seriously!

363
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,833
The best plan ever!

364
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:31,958
[NATSU, HAPPY]
Next time: Frog!

365
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:33,250
[HAPPY]
So tell me, whatcha thinkin'?!

366
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,291
[NATSU] I betcha the
dragons are super strong,

367
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:38,208
so I'll beat 'em up with
magic instead of my fists!

368
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:40,958
[HAPPY] How's that any
different than your usual plan?
