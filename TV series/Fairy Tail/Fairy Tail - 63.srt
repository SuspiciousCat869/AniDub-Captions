1
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:19,708
- Natsu:
PREVIOUSLY, ON "FAIRY TAIL"...

2
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:21,416
- Happy: I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,000
AFTER ALL OF OUR HARD WORK,
WE FINALLY BEAT BRAIN,

4
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:24,833
THE LEADER
OF THE ORACION SEIS.

5
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:26,791
- Gray: WHAT'S THIS "WE" STUFF?
POPS TOOK HIM OUT SOLO.

6
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,375
- Lucy: CAN WE FOCUS
ON WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE,

7
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,041
LIKE WHY NIRVANA
IS STILL MOVING?

8
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,458
HOW DO WE TO STOP THIS THING?

9
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:33,208
- Erza: AS LONG AS WE
DRAW BREATH INTO OUR LUNGS,

10
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,916
WE SHALL KEEP HOPE ALIVE
INSIDE OUR HEARTS.

11
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:40,625
- ( theme music playing )

12
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:57,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

13
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:11,041
- Narrator:
THE BELOVED MAGICAL GUILD

14
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:15,125
THAT COALITION MEMBERS WENDY,
MARVELL AND CARLA CALL HOME--

15
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,666
CAIT SHELTER.

16
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,666
- ( all chattering )

17
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,333
- I'VE GOT TERRIBLE NEWS,
EVERYBODY.

18
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:25,958
NIRVANA'S BEEN ACTIVATED.

19
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,458
IT'S HEADING STRAIGHT FOR US!

20
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,208
- SERIOUSLY?

21
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,166
- NOT EVEN THE COALITION
COULD STOP THAT MONSTROSITY?

22
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,541
- HOW COULD THEY FAIL WITH BOTH
ERZA AND JURA ON THEIR SIDE?

23
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:34,958
- MASTER?

24
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,833
- NABURA.

25
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,500
- ( all clamoring )

26
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,708
- WHY POUR A GLASS IF YOU'RE
GONNA CHUG FROM THE BOTTLE?

27
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,250
- NABURA.
- PLEASE TELL US, SIR.

28
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,208
NIRVANA WILL BE HERE
ANY MINUTE!

29
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:54,500
- DON'T TELL ME THAT INFERNAL
THING IS HEADED OUR WAY?!

30
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:58,708
- Man: WOULD YOU PLEASE SWALLOW
BEFORE YOU SPEAK, MASTER?

31
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:02,458
- NIRVANA HAS SET
ITS WAKING EYES UPON US.

32
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,125
COULD THIS BE OUR FATE

33
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,750
OR NOTHING MORE
THAN COINCIDENCE, NABURA?

34
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,708
- IF THE COALITION FAILED,

35
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,916
WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED TO
WENDY? - DON'T KNOW.

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,958
I'M NOT SURE THE ANSWER
TO THAT QUESTION

37
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,625
WOULD SIT WELL WITH ANY OF US.
- ( chugging )

38
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,458
DO NOT BURDEN YOURSELVES
WITH WORRY.

39
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,000
- All: DRINK OR TALK!

40
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,541
- FEAR NOT!

41
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,833
THE MAGIC OF LIGHT
IS ALIVE AND WELL.

42
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,166
YES, NABURA!

43
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,208
ITS INCANDESCENT GLOW
SHALL LEAD US TO VICTORY.

44
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,208
- YEAH!

45
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,000
- STILL THIS DOESN'T FEEL
LIKE A COINCIDENCE, DOES IT?

46
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,833
- AT THIS POINT,
IT'S FAIRLY OBVIOUS

47
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,500
SOMEONE'S FIGURED OUT
WHO WE ARE.

48
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,291
- Woman: THAT'S WHY
THEY'RE COMING FOR US.

49
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,708
- PLEASE GUIDE US, NABURA.

50
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,250
- AS LONG AS I'VE KNOWN YOU,
I STILL HAVE NO IDEA

51
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,208
WHAT "NABURA" EVEN MEANS.

52
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,833
- Man: SHOULDN'T WE BE
EVACUATING, MASTER?

53
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:56,750
WE CAN'T CONJURE A BARRIER
STRONG ENOUGH STOP NIRVANA.

54
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,541
- YOU FOOLS!

55
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,333
- ( all gasping )

56
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:04,750
- HAVE YOU ALL FORGOTTEN,
NABURA, THERE ARE WIZARDS

57
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,250
FIGHTING TO STOP
ITS DESTRUCTIVE ADVANCE?

58
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,541
WE MUST HAVE FAITH
THAT THEY'LL SUCCEED,

59
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,416
AND NOT DISHONOR THEM
BY RUNNING AWAY.

60
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,458
TRUST ME, I KNOW.

61
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,083
IT'S HARD TO KEEP FAITH
IN THE GRIP OF FEAR.

62
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,958
PERHAPS THE TIME
HAS FINALLY COME.

63
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:32,708
WE KNEW OUR TRANSGRESSIONS
WOULD CATCH UP TO US ONE DAY.

64
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,666
- Happy: "YOUR WORDS"!

65
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,000
- SO IF THERE ISN'T A PILOT SEAT
OR CONTROL PANEL

66
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,041
WHERE WE CAN STOP THIS THING,
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

67
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,666
- DESTROY IT, OF COURSE.

68
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,833
- LEAVE IT TO US
TO DEMOLISH A CITY, RIGHT?

69
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:11,250
- NOT TO SOUND PESSIMISTIC,
BUT THAT'S A PRETTY TALL ORDER.

70
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,208
- BEFORE THAT,

71
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,250
WE SHOULD SEE IF BRAIN KNOWS
HOW TO STOP NIRVANA.

72
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,291
- I DOUBT THAT BRUTE WOULD SHARE
SUCH INFORMATION WITH US.

73
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:23,625
- IF HE WON'T TELL US,
MAYBE JELLAL WILL KNOW.

74
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,291
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

75
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,125
- THINK OF SOMETHING
THAT'LL HELP?

76
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,958
- WELL, I'M NOT QUITE SURE,

77
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,625
BUT IT MAY BE THE BEST OPTION
WE HAVE,

78
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,541
SO I'LL DO MY BEST
TO FIND IT.

79
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,375
- WENDY?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING, CHILD?

80
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,500
- HEY!

81
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:43,291
- SHE SURE IS DETERMINED.

82
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,625
- Hoteye: MY FRIENDS,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

83
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,916
IT IS I,
THE WIZARD KNOWN AS HOTEYE.

84
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,958
- YOU GUYS HEAR THAT TOO
OR AM I GOIN' CRAZY?

85
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:55,000
- I HEARD IT. - DID YOU
DEFEAT MIDNIGHT, RICHARD?

86
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,333
- I TRIED MY BEST,
BUT IN THE END,

87
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:00,875
IT SEEMS MY MAGIC SIMPLY WASN'T
STRONG ENOUGH TO TRUMP HIS.

88
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,250
DO NOT CONCERN YOURSELF
WITH MY RESCUE.

89
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,833
YOU MUST WORK TOGETHER TO
BRING MIDNIGHT DOWN FOR GOOD.

90
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,875
IF YOU SUCCEED
IN DEFEATING HIM,

91
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,750
NIRVANA'S SOURCE OF MAGIC POWER
WILL BE RENDERED DRY

92
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,041
AND THE CITY WILL CEASE
ITS DESTRUCTIVE PATH.

93
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,958
- AM I SUPPOSED
TO KNOW THIS GUY?

94
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,416
- SO WE CAN STOP NIRVANA WITHOUT
DESTROYING THE WHOLE THING?

95
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,750
- ( whimpering )

96
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,416
- HE'S DIRECTLY BELOW YOU,

97
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
JUST OUTSIDE
OF THE ROYAL THRONE.

98
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,750
HIS POWER IS NOT ONE
TO BE UNDERESTIMATED.

99
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,666
PLEASE, BE CAUTIOUS,
MY FRIENDS.

100
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,125
- THE SAME TO YOU, RICHARD.

101
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,125
- WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?
- NICE.

102
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,125
THIS MESS
JUST GOT A WHOLE LOT EASIER.

103
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,083
- I'M ALL FIRED UP NOW.

104
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,041
WE'RE COMIN' FOR YOU,
SLEEPY HEAD.

105
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,250
- COME ON.  I KNOW YOU
CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT.

106
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,500
- Natsu: ALL RIGHT,
HOW ABOUT SIR SNORES-A-LOT?

107
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,375
- Hoteye:
ONLY ONE OF THE SIX PRAYERS

108
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,583
STILL REMAINS
ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

109
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,208
EVERY OUNCE OF MY TRUST AND
CONFIDENCE

110
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,875
BELONGS TO YOU, MY FRIENDS.

111
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:53,208
DEFEAT MIDNIGHT, AND STOP
NIRVANA ONCE AND FOR ALL.

112
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,083
OH YEAH!

113
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:59,333
( disguised voice ) I WISH YOU
LUCK, MY FAITHFUL COMRADES.

114
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,000
( grunting )

115
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,666
- Jura: SIR RICHARD!

116
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,875
- ( chuckling )

117
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,041
YOU MAY HAVE BESTED ME,

118
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,458
BUT IT WILL COME AT A PRICE.

119
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,833
- HE SHOULD BE THROUGH THERE.
- LET'S DO THIS THING!

120
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,333
( grunting )

121
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,166
ALL RIGHT, FREAK.
TIME FOR A DIRT NAP!

122
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,750
- ( all gasping )
- EVERYBODY GET DOWN!

123
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:32,791
- WHAT WAS THAT EXPLOSION?
- IT WAS NEAR THE THRONE.

124
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,583
- FATHER CAN BE
SO SELFISH SOMETIMES.

125
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,625
HE TOOK A BIG BITE
OUT OF MY FUN

126
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,375
AND LEFT ME
WITH MEASLY SCRAPS.

127
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:49,125
NOW SINCE YOU'RE THE LAST
OF MY PREY,

128
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,708
AT LEAST MAKE IT
ENTERTAINING FOR ME.

129
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,791
- STAND BACK.
HE'S MINE.

130
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,333
- JELLAL, YOU CAN'T.

131
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:20,375
- HEY, YOU GUYS,
EVERYONE OKAY?

132
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,708
- KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN,
WILL YA?

133
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,875
I'M TRYING TO SLEEP HERE.
- AYE.

134
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,541
- ARE WE REALLY THIS STUPID?
WE'RE IN FAIRY TAIL.

135
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,208
I CAN'T ACCEPT THAT WE FELL
FOR THAT TRAP SO EASILY.

136
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:33,291
- WELL, WE'RE ALSO DUMB ENOUGH
TO GET BURIED ALIVE.

137
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,375
- WHAT?  BUT IF THAT'S THE CASE,
THEN WHERE'S JURA?

138
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,791
- ( grunts )

139
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,958
- ( panting )

140
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,416
- NO!
- ARE YOU OKAY?

141
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,208
- HE RISKED HIS LIFE
TO PROTECT US.

142
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,375
- POPS, HANG IN THERE!

143
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,416
- THE STRENGTH AND COURAGE
YOU POSSESS--

144
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,875
YOUR GUILD IS A LUCKY ONE.

145
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,291
IT BRINGS ME GREAT RELIEF

146
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:14,708
TO KNOW YOU'RE STILL ALIVE.

147
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,791
- POPS, NO!

148
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,708
- YOU CAN'T GO LIKE THIS!
- PLEASE, DON'T DIE!

149
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,125
- Natsu: JURA!

150
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,458
- WE GOTTA FIND HIM

151
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,958
BEFORE THIS THING
GETS ANY CLOSER TO CAIT SHELTER.

152
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,958
- IF WE DON'T LAND SHORTLY,
CHILD,

153
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,291
I'M LIABLE TO LOSE MY GRIP
ON YOU FOR GOOD.

154
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,708
- OH, I'M SORRY,
I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION.

155
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,958
LET'S CONTINUE THE SEARCH
ON FOOT.  SOUND GOOD?

156
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,333
- YOUR SENSE OF SMELL
WILL BE OUR GUIDE.

157
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,291
- ( both sigh )

158
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,833
- HONESTLY, I'M KIND OF NERVOUS
ABOUT FINDING HIM

159
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,666
'CAUSE I'VE NOTICED
HE HAS A DIFFERENT SCENT

160
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,500
THAN THE ONE I REMEMBER
FROM BEFORE.

161
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,833
- WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T
LET THAT DISTRACT YOU

162
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:59,666
FROM COMPLETING OUR GOAL.
IF WE CAN FIND HIM,

163
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,166
WE MAY BE ABLE
TO STOP NIRVANA FROM MOVING.

164
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:08,458
- Wendy: WHEREVER YOU ARE,
JELLAL, PLEASE BE SAFE.

165
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,541
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE FORGOTTEN
ABOUT ME, BUT I DON'T CARE.

166
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:15,583
JUST KNOW, I'VE NEVER ONCE
FORGOTTEN ABOUT YOU.

167
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:19,500
YOU'VE BEEN A PART OF MY
THOUGHTS EVERY SINGLE DAY.

168
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:36,791
- HOW COULD I MISS HIM
AT SUCH CLOSE RANGE?

169
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,916
- ( chuckles )

170
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,958
- PLEASE STOP THIS
RIGHT NOW.

171
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,583
YOU'RE IN NO CONDITION
TO FIGHT HIM.  LET ME DO IT.

172
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,208
- WELL?
I'M WAITING.

173
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,083
- ( grunts )

174
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,708
- THIS IS BORING.

175
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,166
YOU'RE THE FEARSOME JELLAL
I KEEP HEARING ABOUT?

176
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,833
TALK ABOUT A WASTE OF TIME.

177
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,458
- Midnight:
DID YOU LOSE YOUR MEMORY

178
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,416
AND FORGET
HOW TO USE MAGIC TOO?

179
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,541
HOW PATHETIC.

180
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,833
- Erza: MEMORIES OR NO,
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE

181
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,500
GONE DOWN SO QUICKLY.

182
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:34,916
- ( chuckles )

183
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,916
AT LEAST YOU'RE DETERMINED.

184
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,333
- THE SELF-DESTRUCTION CIRCLE
HE PLACED ON HIMSELF

185
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:44,333
MUST'VE DRAINED MORE OF HIS
MAGIC ENERGY THAN HE THOUGHT.

186
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,708
- WHAT A NICE SURPRISE.

187
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,500
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING
JUST HOW MUCH PAIN

188
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:53,958
YOU CAN ENDURE.

189
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,500
- IF ERZA SCARLET'S THAT EAGER
TO HAVE HER TURN,

190
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,666
WHO AM I TO KEEP HER WAITING?

191
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,041
- Erza: MY SWORD
DIDN'T EVEN HIT HIM!

192
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,916
- NO, YOU MUSTN'T
TAKE YOUR CHANCES AGAINST HIM.

193
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,541
HE'S TOO DANGEROUS.

194
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,916
- HOW IS HE DOING THAT?

195
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:25,250
WHAT IS THIS? AH!

196
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,166
- LET HER GO.

197
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,291
- AAH!

198
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,458
NOW I GET IT.

199
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,291
YOU USE REFLECTOR MAGIC.

200
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,875
- YES.

201
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,166
AND WHATEVER KIND OF ATTACK
YOU THROW AT ME,

202
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,375
I'LL BE ABLE TO TWIST
AND MANIPULATE ALL OF IT.

203
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,583
BESIDES GIVING ME
A FLAWLESS DEFENSE,

204
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,041
MY MAGIC ALLOWS ME
TO DOMINATE MY OPPONENTS.

205
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,958
EVEN LIGHT ITSELF
BENDS TO MY WILL.

206
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:03,375
- COULD SUCH A POWER
TRULY EXIST?

207
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,958
- EVERY OPPONENT
HAS THEIR FLAWS.

208
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,875
YOU ARE NO DIFFERENT.
I WILL BE YOUR END!

209
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,958
- THAT'S IT--
RUSH TOWARDS YOUR DOOM.

210
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:15,458
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOUR FACE
AS I TWIST YOUR BODY APART.

211
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,541
- OH, MAN,
HE LOOKS BAD.

212
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,750
- HANG IN THERE, POPS.
WE'LL GET HELP FOR YA.

213
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,958
- Happy:
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

214
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,625
- Klodoa: RIDICULOUS.

215
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,750
BRAIN IS SUCH A FOOL.

216
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,750
HE USED THE LAST OF HIS POWER
TO LAY HIS TRAP,

217
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,916
YET ONLY ONE OF YOU
FELL IN ITS SNARE.

218
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,083
- WHO ARE YOU?
- OVER THERE!

219
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,833
- HE WAS A PITIFUL LEADER,

220
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:51,000
A DISGRACE TO THE SIX DEMONS.

221
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,833
BUT OUR GOAL
HAS NOT FALLEN OUT OF REACH.

222
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:59,750
AS LONG AS MIDNIGHT STANDS,
WE SHALL BE VICTORIOUS.

223
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,250
SINCE HE'S BUSY AT THE MOMENT,

224
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,750
THERE'S NOTHING KEEPING ME
FROM DISPOSING OF YOU MYSELF.

225
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,208
- THAT CANE'S TALKIN' TO ME!
- AS A TALKING CAT,

226
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,416
I WOULDN'T THINK YOU'D FIND IT
ALL THAT SURPRISING.

227
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,541
- I GUESS.

228
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,250
- ( chuckling )

229
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,416
( guffawing )

230
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,583
- THAT'S CRAZY.

231
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,041
IT'S THE STAFF THAT BRAIN
WAS CARRYING AROUND.

232
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,208
- 'KAY, I'M FREAKED OUT NOW.

233
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,916
- OH, WOULD YOU KNOCK OFF
THE CREEPY LAUGHING?

234
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,875
I'VE ALREADY GOT A SPLITTING
HEADACHE THANKS TO YOUR BOSS--

235
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,583
- HEY!
DON'T GO GRABBING THAT.

236
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,333
THERE'S NO TELLING
WHERE IT'S BEEN, YOU KNOW?

237
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,708
- STOP THIS CITY RIGHT NOW,
YOU PIECE OF ROTTING DRIFTWOOD.

238
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,416
- HOW DARE YOU
INSULT MY FAMILY LEGACY?

239
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,625
I COME FROM A LONG LINE
OF PROUD CEDAR,

240
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,416
SO SHOW SOME RESPECT.

241
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,875
BEFORE YOU
IS THE VENERATED SEVENTH MEMBER

242
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,875
OF THE ORACION SEIS,

243
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,208
EMERGED FROM HIS SLUMBER
TO DESTROY YOU ALL--

244
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,583
- I'VE HEARD JUST
ABOUT ENOUGH OUTTA YOU!

245
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,916
- LET GO OF ME THIS INSTANT!

246
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,208
- HOLD ON, I THOUGHT
THERE WERE ONLY SIX MEMBERS

247
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,458
OF THE ORACION SEIS.

248
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:06,125
- PROFESSOR HAPPY'S BACK WITH
ANOTHER CLASS

249
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,458
ABOUT "FAIRY TAIL."

250
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,166
- LUCY'S RIGHT,
FOR A CHANGE.

251
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,291
THE WORD IN "SEIS"
IN ORACION SEIS MEANS SIX,

252
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,083
AS IN THERE ARE SIX MEMBERS
THAT MAKE UP THE GUILD.

253
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,041
YOU'RE RIGHT,
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

254
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,291
- I KNOW, AND DON'T THINK
I DIDN'T CATCH YOU SLIPPING

255
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,500
IN THAT "FOR A CHANGE" COMMENT,
YA FLEABAG.

256
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,958
- WHO CARES? WHATEVER THE
NUMBER OF MEMBERS MIGHT BE,

257
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,000
A CANE IS TALKING
ABOUT KICKING OUR BUTTS.

258
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,833
- LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE--

259
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,625
IT CAN'T REALLY KICK OUR BUTTS
SINCE IT HAS NO FEET.

260
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:34,500
- AH!
UNCIVILIZED NEANDERTHAL.

261
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:38,041
IT WON'T BE LONG UNTIL THEIR
WRETCHED GUILD

262
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,583
IS WITHIN OUR SIGHTS.

263
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,000
THEN WE CAN FINALLY BEGIN TO
CLEANSE THIS WORLD OF REFUSE.

264
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,166
- YOU MEAN WE'RE ALREADY
THAT CLOSE TO CAIT SHELTER?

265
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,958
- INDEED WE ARE!

266
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,375
ONCE THEY'RE STAMPED OUT,

267
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:51,916
WE CAN TRULY BEGIN
OUR CRUSADE OF DARKNESS.

268
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,958
( cackling )

269
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,541
- NOW, DANCE, MY SWORDS!

270
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:04,625
- YOU COULD THROW A THOUSAND,
BUT THEY STILL WON'T HIT ME.

271
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,833
SO TELL ME,

272
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:13,000
HOW'S IT FEEL TO FEND OFF
ONE OF YOUR OWN ATTACKS?

273
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,083
- GET OUT OF THERE!

274
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,541
- THAT'S BETTER.

275
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,916
NOW SOOTHE ME WITH A LULLABY
OF TORMENT AND AGONY.

276
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,916
- AAH!

277
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
- ( laughs )

278
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:36,375
NOTHING WHETS MY APPETITE
LIKE TORTURED SCREAMS.

279
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,083
IMPRESSIVE...

280
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,958
BUT FUTILE.

281
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,000
SPIRAL PAIN!

282
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,708
- ( screams )

283
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,250
- NO, ERZA.

284
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,041
- FINISHED ALREADY?

285
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,958
- CURSE YOU.
- YOU CAN'T DIE ON ME YET.

286
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:24,291
I STILL WANT TO PLAY.
I NEED ENTERTAINMENT.

287
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,333
AT LEAST
UNTIL WE REACH CAIT SHELTER.

288
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,500
- WHAT IS THIS CAIT SHELTER?

289
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,458
- IT'S OUR FIRST TARGET,
OF COURSE.

290
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,250
- WHAT EARNED THEM THAT HONOR?

291
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,958
- AN EXCELLENT QUESTION.

292
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:41,583
LONG AGO, A PEACEFUL TRIBE,
THE NIRVITS,

293
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,583
CREATED NIRVANA,

294
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,916
HOPING TO END
A CATACLYSMIC WAR.

295
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,416
BUT THE TOOL THEY'D CREATED
WAS FAR MORE DANGEROUS

296
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,708
THAN THE WAR
THEY SOUGHT TO END.

297
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,625
SO THEY SEALED IT AWAY,

298
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:56,291
HOPING IT WOULD NEVER
BE USED AGAIN.

299
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,583
THEY WERE SO AFRAID OF IT,

300
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,708
THEY SWORE TO KEEP WATCH
OVER THE BURIAL SITE.

301
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:05,458
THEIR DESCENDANTS HAVE TAKEN UP
THAT TASK THROUGH THE AGES.

302
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:08,791
AND THEY MAKE UP A GUILD
THAT STILL REMAINS TODAY--

303
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,500
CAIT SHELTER.

304
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,750
- THEY ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE
IN ALL OF EXISTENCE

305
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,375
WITH THE POWER
TO SEAL NIRVANA ONCE MORE.

306
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,791
THEREFORE,
THE NIRVIT BLOODLINE MUST END.

307
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
- YOU'D HAVE TO BE INSANE

308
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,208
TO LET AN INCREDIBLE POWER
LIKE THIS TO GO WASTE.

309
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:31,333
WE WILL UTILIZE IT.

310
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:35,916
WE WILL SEND THE WORLD SCREAMING
DOWN THE PATH TO SWEET CHAOS.

311
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,625
AND WE'LL START BY MAKING
CAIT SHELTER AN EXAMPLE.

312
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,833
THE NIRVITS
WANTED TO STAY NEUTRAL?

313
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,000
WE'LL FORCE THEM
INTO BLOODY WAR.

314
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,041
NIRVANA WILL TURN THEIR HEARTS

315
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,583
INTO THE BLACKEST
PITCH IMAGINABLE.

316
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,791
AND THEN THEY'LL SLAUGHTER
EACH OTHER!

317
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,083
OH,
WHAT A LULLABY IT'LL BE.

318
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,208
- HEARTLESS MONSTER.

319
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:00,708
- DO ME A SOLID AND DROP
THE GOODY-GOODY ACT ALREADY.

320
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,708
IT'S KIND OF A DRAG.

321
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,708
AFTER ALL,

322
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:10,375
YOUR HEART'S SO BLACK,
MINE SHINES NEXT TO YOURS.

323
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,166
ONE COULD SAY

324
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,583
THAT YOU'RE THE VERY EMBODIMENT
OF DARKNESS.

325
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,208
- THAT'S A LIE!

326
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,833
- BE PROUD OF YOURSELF.

327
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,000
YOU FORCED CHILDREN
INTO SLAVE LABOR,

328
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,750
MURDERED YOUR CLOSEST FRIEND,

329
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,250
AND EVEN TRIED TO KILL
SWEET ERZA IN YOUR MAD RISE

330
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:28,041
FOR THE GREATEST POWER
IN EXISTENCE.

331
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:35,208
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MANY INNOCENT PEOPLE

332
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,333
YOU'VE BROUGHT SORROW UPON?

333
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:40,750
THEY'VE ALL FEARED YOU,
TREMBLED AT YOUR NAME.

334
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,416
AN ENTIRE OCEAN OF TEARS
WAS SHED

335
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,791
FROM THE SUFFERING YOU CAUSED.

336
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:53,500
YOU INSPIRE ME. 
 - I WHAT?

337
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,583
- SO WHY DON'T YOU JOIN US?

338
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,750
YOU ARE DESTINED

339
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:07,583
TO BECOME THE NEWEST MEMBER
OF THE ORACION SEIS.

340
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,291
- DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.

341
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,375
THE LIGHT INSIDE YOU
IS BRIGHTER THAN EVER BEFORE.

342
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,458
- ERZA.

343
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:49,583
- WOW.
I'M SURPRISED YOU CAN STAND.

344
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:58,166
- AND THAT HOPE WILL GUIDE YOU
THROUGH THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

345
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,250
- YOUR WORDS ARE THE LIGHT

346
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:03,166
THAT GIVES ME HOPE
AND COURAGE.

347
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:10,250
- I GET MY REAL FIGHT
AFTER ALL.  WONDERFUL.

348
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:13,708
DESTROYING YOU
WILL BE A TREAT.

349
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:20,541
- I SWEAR ON THIS SACRED BLADE
I WIELD,

350
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:24,791
I WILL END THIS CHAOS
AND YOUR LIFE.

351
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:51,375
- ( singing in Japanese )

352
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:14,791
- Happy: OF COURSE, THE
STRONGEST GUY OF ALL SHOWS UP

353
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,583
AFTER WE'VE
BEEN BEAT DOWN A BUNCH.

354
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:18,333
IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE BACK
TO SQUARE ONE AGAIN.

355
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,833
I'M STARTING TO SEE
A PATTERN HERE.

356
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,666
- Natsu: HEY, OUR EARLIER FIGHTS
WEREN'T FOR NOTHIN', RIGHT?

357
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,708
AND LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE--
HE'S THE LAST ONE

358
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:26,458
WE GOTTA KNOCK DOWN.
SO LET'S FINISH THIS THING.

359
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:28,500
- MUST BE NICE TO LIVE
SUCH A CAREFREE LIFE, HUH?

360
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,500
I PREFER TO CALL IT
BEING POSITIVE.

361
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:32,791
- Both: NEXT TIME-- "ZERO"!

362
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:35,708
- Happy: WOW, I FEEL ALL
INSPIRED NOW. THANKS, NATSU.

363
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:37,833
- I KNOW, RIGHT?
GUESS I'VE GOT PHILANTHROPY

364
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:41,416
IN MY BLOOD, HUH, LITTLE BUDDY?
- YOU MEAN PHILOSOPHY.
