[LUCY]
This is Crocus,

2
01:00:24,083 --> 01:00:26,916
the bustling, flower-blooming
capital of the Fiore Kingdom!

3
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,791
A city that once
again finds itself

4
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:31,708
hosting the annual
Grand Magic Games.

5
01:00:31,791 --> 01:00:33,541
It's time to see the
kingdom's wizard guilds

6
01:00:33,625 --> 01:00:37,333
competing for the coveted
title of "Fiore's finest"!

7
01:00:41,291 --> 01:00:43,500
[LUCY] The glowing palace
of lights, Mercurius,

8
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:47,083
shines as the crown jewel
in the heart of it all.

01:00:47,166 --> 01:00:49,041
Atop a craggy mountain
to the west

10
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:51,041
stands the true
home of the games,

11
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:53,708
the Domus Flau coliseum.

12
01:00:53,791 --> 01:00:55,958
And this fabulous
little apartment

13
01:00:56,041 --> 01:00:57,875
is where I call home these days.

14
01:00:57,958 --> 01:00:59,125
At 80,000 Jewel,

15
01:00:59,208 --> 01:01:01,250
it's a bit pricier than
my place in Magnolia.

16
01:01:01,333 --> 01:01:03,458
But the location can't be beat!

17
01:01:03,541 --> 01:01:05,791
So many shops and cafes nearby.

18
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:09,000
It's a like whole new exciting
world has opened up for me!

19

Good morning, world.

20

It's time to face
a brand new day.

21
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:20,833
I miss my old place sometimes,

22
01:01:20,916 --> 01:01:22,333
all those peaceful mornings.

23
01:01:22,416 --> 01:01:23,750
Just me alone with my thoughts.

24
01:01:23,833 --> 01:01:26,250
Till I walk into
the living room.

25
01:01:37,375 --> 01:01:38,250
Come on!

26
01:01:38,333 --> 01:01:41,500
Well, no time for moping around!

27
01:03:16,833 --> 01:03:19,708
Flowers can't bloom
without water, right?

Everything's so fresh here.
This fruit is amazing.

All done!

Ladies and gentlemen,

01:04:32,541 --> 01:04:34,750
it's going to be a
thrilling day four

47
01:04:34,833 --> 01:04:37,833
of the 792 Grand Magic Games!

48
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:41,041
Greetings! Howdy, folks,
it's Chapati Lola again.

49
01:04:41,125 --> 01:04:43,125
Joining me here is Former
Member of the Magic Council

01:04:43,208 --> 01:04:45,333
and Fiore's current
favorite celebrity chef!

51
01:04:45,416 --> 01:04:47,875
That man is Mr. Yajima!

52
01:04:47,958 --> 01:04:49,375
Good to be here.

53
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:51,000
So are we ready to see

54
01:04:51,083 --> 01:04:53,583
some heart-stopping
battles of wizardry?

55
01:04:53,666 --> 01:04:56,208
Oh crap, it's already
getting started!

56
01:04:58,583 --> 01:05:00,625
I need to see a
valid pass, please.

Wait, i-it's in here.

At least, I hope it's in here.

We can't let you through
without a proper ID, miss.

[LUCY]
Can't you make an exception?

62
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:12,916
No exceptions.

63
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,333
[LUCY]
Aw, come on. Please?

64
01:05:14,416 --> 01:05:16,291
I just said "no exceptions."

65
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:19,583
I get your point, okay?

66
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:23,458
[LUCY] Well, if words
don't do the trick.

67
01:05:23,541 --> 01:05:27,083
[LUCY] Umm, I know that it'd be
bending the rules a little bit,

68
01:05:27,166 --> 01:05:29,500
but I won't tattle on you.

use more brain than beauty!

[CHAPATI] Now let's get into the
first match of the semi-finals!

80
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:06,583
After dominating
the earlier rounds,

81
01:06:06,666 --> 01:06:09,583
it's no surprise to see
Chrisark of Duallahan Head

82
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:11,750
enter the coliseum!

83

Yo-ho-ho!

84
01:06:15,541 --> 01:06:18,666
[CHAPATI] Will he continue
his winning streak today?

85
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:22,375
Or will Berick of Dwarf
Gear shut him down?

86
01:06:22,458 --> 01:06:25,958
Whatever happens, it's sure
to be an amazing battle!

87
01:06:26,041 --> 01:06:28,541
Well, Mr. Yajima, your thoughts?

88
01:06:28,625 --> 01:06:30,416
What should we keep an
eye on in this match?

89
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,000
I suppose it'd be wise to say

90
01:06:32,083 --> 01:06:34,000
that we should keep
both eyes on the match.

91
01:06:34,083 --> 01:06:35,500
Yeah, but for what?

92
01:06:35,583 --> 01:06:38,000
This Chrisark fellow is
a truly powerful wizard,

93
01:06:38,083 --> 01:06:39,833
and seemingly without equal.

94
01:06:39,916 --> 01:06:41,041
If you were to blink,

95
01:06:41,125 --> 01:06:43,250
you could very well
miss the entire match.

these semifinals! So cool!

[JASON]
No, not quite yet.

107
01:07:14,666 --> 01:07:18,125
But I think it's about to be
over if Chrisark keeps his cool.

[LUCY] It's crazy how
much things have changed

01:07:27,208 --> 01:07:28,208
in the last year.

112

at Sorcerer Weekly!

"Editor-in-training" actually.

115
01:07:38,541 --> 01:07:41,375
[LUCY] Literally the very next
day after Natsu and Happy

116
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:43,375
left for their training mission,

117
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:46,958
Master Makarov
disbanded the guild.

118
01:07:47,041 --> 01:07:50,416
Although I tried to believe
it wasn't really happening,

119
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,208
it was true.

120
01:07:52,291 --> 01:07:54,041
I was devastated.

121
01:07:54,125 --> 01:07:57,375
It was like losing my family.

122
01:07:57,458 --> 01:08:02,166
Everyone had to pick up the
pieces and go our separate ways.

123
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:03,708
The others seemed so hopeful

124
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:06,666
about what the future
had in store for them.

125
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,041
Just like the master said,

126
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:12,416
it was "time to follow
our own paths."

127
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:15,416
It took a while for me
to accept what happened.

128
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:18,500
So I may have gotten
a late start on that.

129
01:08:18,583 --> 01:08:23,875
But one day Jason came
to me with a job.

01:08:34,291 --> 01:08:36,500
but I guess I must've
impressed him

so I wanna push the
envelope even further!

163
01:09:45,375 --> 01:09:47,208
I have read Sorcerer
Weekly every single week

164
01:09:47,291 --> 01:09:48,625
for as long as I can remember.

165
01:09:48,708 --> 01:09:52,291
The photography and the
articles are really inspiring.

166
01:09:52,375 --> 01:09:53,916
Writing for such
a great magazine

167
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,208
would be a dream come true!

168
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:58,208
And I promise you won't
be disappointed in me!

169
01:09:58,291 --> 01:09:59,625
Pretty please?

170
01:09:59,708 --> 01:10:01,333
[JASON]
Hmm...

171
01:10:01,416 --> 01:10:03,375
I don't know.

172
01:10:03,458 --> 01:10:06,083
[LUCY] I'll give it
everything I've got!

173
01:10:06,166 --> 01:10:08,666
Well...

174
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:09,833
Okay.

175
01:10:09,916 --> 01:10:11,250
I guess I could be cool
and ask my bosses

176
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:12,708
if they'll hire you on.

177
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:14,500
[LUCY]
That would be uber cool!

178
01:10:14,583 --> 01:10:16,125
[JASON]
But if we do hire you,

179
01:10:16,208 --> 01:10:18,375
it'd have to be as an
editor-in-training.

180
01:10:18,458 --> 01:10:19,583
[LUCY gasps]

181
01:10:19,666 --> 01:10:21,583
Oh, that sounds like an
amazing opportunity!

182
01:10:21,666 --> 01:10:23,375
I swear, I won't let you down!

183
01:10:23,458 --> 01:10:25,875
[JASON]
I gotta warn ya first.

184
01:10:25,958 --> 01:10:28,833
Our models are treated
extremely well by the company.

185
01:10:28,916 --> 01:10:31,708
But a lowly trainee is a
different story altogether.

186
01:10:31,791 --> 01:10:33,125
You understand?

187
01:10:33,208 --> 01:10:35,958
You'll be on the bottom rung.
It's brutal down there.

188
01:10:36,041 --> 01:10:40,458
Yeah, I understand.
And I realize it won't be easy!

189
01:10:44,083 --> 01:10:46,208
[PHOTOGRAPHER A]
Nice! Nice!

190
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:47,541
Nice!

191
01:10:47,625 --> 01:10:52,125
So hot! I mean, so cool!

192
01:10:52,208 --> 01:10:53,666
[PHOTOGRAPHER A] All right,
everybody, that's a wrap.

193
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,666
Let's clear the set!

194
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:56,875
Thank you so much!

195
01:10:56,958 --> 01:10:58,208
Cool!

196
01:10:58,291 --> 01:11:00,166
Hm?

197
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:01,916
Lucy! Robe! Now!

198
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,750
Uh, yes, sir!

199
01:11:04,916 --> 01:11:06,000
[JASON]
You forgot her drink!

200
01:11:06,083 --> 01:11:07,208
[LUCY]
Yes, sir!

201
01:11:07,291 --> 01:11:08,375
[JASON]
Prep for the interview!

202
01:11:08,458 --> 01:11:09,958
Right!

203
01:11:10,041 --> 01:11:11,583
Hey, uh, I hope you don't mind,

204
01:11:11,666 --> 01:11:15,041
but I thought of a couple of
questions for today's interview.

205
01:11:16,666 --> 01:11:17,833
Not in a million years.

206
01:11:17,916 --> 01:11:19,375
Sorry.

207
01:11:23,291 --> 01:11:24,791
[JASON]
Hmm.

208
01:11:24,875 --> 01:11:27,208
I'm startin' to sweat
over my deadline,

209
01:11:27,291 --> 01:11:28,958
but this article is crap.

210
01:11:29,041 --> 01:11:30,166
[LUCY]
Umm.

211
01:11:32,291 --> 01:11:34,000
This might be presumptuous,

212
01:11:34,083 --> 01:11:37,041
but here, I put
something together.

213
01:11:40,708 --> 01:11:42,083
[LUCY]
What do you think?

214
01:11:42,166 --> 01:11:44,666
I dunno. It reads more like
a novel than a puff piece.

215
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:45,416
[LUCY]
Huh?

216
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,583
Not in a thousand years!

217
01:11:47,666 --> 01:11:48,916
Oh.

218
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,375
That's a whole lot better
than a million, I guess!

219
01:11:51,458 --> 01:11:53,416
I'll rewrite it!

220
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:54,750
Now hold on a minute.

221
01:11:54,833 --> 01:11:56,791
First you gotta book us a
photographer and stylist

222
01:11:56,875 --> 01:11:57,708
for tomorrow.

223
01:11:57,791 --> 01:11:59,083
[LUCY]
They're booked, boss!

224
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:05,916
Will this work?

225
01:12:07,625 --> 01:12:08,916
Not in a hundred years!

226
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,083
That's practically
tomorrow at this rate!

227
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:14,083
For your consideration.

228
01:12:15,208 --> 01:12:16,500
Not in ten years!

229
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:18,000
[LUCY]
Almost there!

230
01:12:19,541 --> 01:12:21,416
[LUCY]
Whaddaya think, boss?

231
01:12:22,791 --> 01:12:24,833
I think it's time I
teach you to do layouts.

232
01:12:24,916 --> 01:12:26,166
Awesome!

233
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:28,458
I meant it when I said
I wouldn't let you down.

234
01:12:28,541 --> 01:12:29,875
And I've already been studying

235
01:12:29,958 --> 01:12:31,958
about how to do
layouts on my own!

236
01:12:32,041 --> 01:12:34,041
Cool as ice!

237
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:36,333
[LUCY] All the articles
have been edited, boss.

238
01:12:36,416 --> 01:12:38,875
We've got a wicked
cool issue this week.

239
01:12:38,958 --> 01:12:40,333
Thanks, rockstar.

240
01:12:40,416 --> 01:12:41,750
And you've gotta be
excited about getting

241
01:12:41,833 --> 01:12:43,083
your first one
published, huh?

242
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:45,708
[LUCY] Oh, yeah!
Tired, but super excited!

243
01:12:45,791 --> 01:12:47,458
Thanks, I owe it all to you.

244
01:12:47,541 --> 01:12:50,500
You did it yourself.
You don't owe me anything.

245
01:12:50,583 --> 01:12:51,583
That's sweet.

246
01:12:51,666 --> 01:12:52,958
[JASON]
Actually, you owe yourself.

247
01:12:53,041 --> 01:12:54,208
One well-earned day off.

248
01:12:54,291 --> 01:12:55,625
[gasps]

249
01:12:55,708 --> 01:12:57,125
Cool.

250
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:03,208
It's already been a long night,
but I gotta do this.

251
01:13:14,208 --> 01:13:16,708
[LUCY]
And that's how I wound up here.

252
01:13:16,791 --> 01:13:18,291
[LUCY] All right,
I can handle the editing

253
01:13:18,375 --> 01:13:20,291
and the layout no
problem, boss man!

254
01:13:20,375 --> 01:13:22,125
You're a life-saver.

255
01:13:23,666 --> 01:13:24,666
[LUCY gasps]

256
01:13:32,958 --> 01:13:34,916
[JASON]
It's kind of a bummer.

257
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,375
This year's Grand Magic Games

258
01:13:36,458 --> 01:13:38,666
aren't nearly as cool
as they used to be.

259
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:41,291
I mean, all of the guilds
that battled it out last year

260
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,625
were like totally
legendary, ya know?

261
01:13:43,708 --> 01:13:46,666
Yeah, there definitely were some
truly great ones, weren't there?

262
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:49,458
There were.
Especially Fairy Tail.

263
01:13:49,541 --> 01:13:52,791
Well, we're not really
a guild anymore, so--

264
01:13:52,875 --> 01:13:55,250
You still have the
emblem on your hand.

265
01:13:59,458 --> 01:14:02,625
But you guys did
kinda break up.

266
01:14:02,708 --> 01:14:05,208
And you were so cool.

267
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:24,541
[LUCY] It's been almost a year
since I've been in contact

268
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:26,833
with any of my old friends.

269
01:14:26,916 --> 01:14:29,208
I've been way too busy.

270
01:14:29,291 --> 01:14:31,458
Yeah, right, who am I kidding?

271
01:14:33,916 --> 01:14:36,916
[LUCY] I needed to give
everyone some space, is all.

272
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:41,375
They can't follow their own
paths with me tagging along.

273
01:14:41,458 --> 01:14:43,416
That's not true either.

274
01:14:46,166 --> 01:14:48,833
This sucks.

275
01:14:48,916 --> 01:14:51,583
[LUCY] I was just too
scared to face them.

276
01:14:55,291 --> 01:14:58,375
I miss Fairy Tail!

277
01:14:58,458 --> 01:15:02,833
[NEIGHBOR A] Shut up, will ya?!
I'm trying to sleep!

01:15:02,916 --> 01:15:06,166
Jeez, how embarrassing.

279
01:15:09,916 --> 01:15:11,541
[LUCY]
The truth be told,

280
01:15:11,625 --> 01:15:14,916
the main reason I became
a reporter in the first place

281
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,666
was to gather all the
information I could find.

282
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:21,750
From verified eyewitness
accounts to gossip.

283
01:15:21,833 --> 01:15:23,458
All of it.

284
01:15:25,875 --> 01:15:29,916
[LUCY] This whole year
has been one long search.

285
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,375
Still no solid leads
on Natsu and Happy.

286
01:15:33,458 --> 01:15:35,625
It's like they just disappeared.

287
01:15:35,708 --> 01:15:39,666
All I can think about
is finding them.

288
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:42,333
So we can be a family again.

290
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,458

But it's never gonna happen.

291
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:57,583
[LUCY] It's over, Lucy.
Fairy Tail's done.

292
01:16:22,708 --> 01:16:25,166
Well. Okay.

293
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:27,250
It's time to get movin'!

Back to work.

[CROWD cheering]

297
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:40,166
[CHAPATI] Here it is folks,
the day of reckoning!

298
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:41,750
Who will take home
the coveted title

299
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:44,125
of "Fiore's Mightiest Guild"?

300
01:16:44,208 --> 01:16:45,375
Let's find out!

301
01:16:45,458 --> 01:16:48,041
I've got my predictions.
And how about you, sir?

302
01:16:48,125 --> 01:16:49,708
I can't quite say.

303
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:53,041
Surely our old friend Mato
can provide some insight!

304
01:16:53,125 --> 01:16:55,291
[MATO]
I'll try, punkin!

305
01:16:55,375 --> 01:16:57,125
[CHAPATI]
Well, anyone who's been watching

306
01:16:57,208 --> 01:16:58,500
could've seen this one coming.

307
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:00,625
Chrisark and Dullahan Head
have powered their way

308
01:17:00,708 --> 01:17:01,416
into the finals!

309
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,750
Yo-ho!

310
01:17:06,208 --> 01:17:07,666
[CHAPATI] They've got a
challenge on their hands

311
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:10,250
from the underdogs of
the Scarmiglione guild,

312
01:17:10,333 --> 01:17:12,333
who have pulled off
one miraculous comeback

313
01:17:12,416 --> 01:17:13,583
after another!

314
01:17:13,666 --> 01:17:15,375
This year's games have
been a little different.

315
01:17:15,458 --> 01:17:17,375
Since it's a single
elimination tournament,

316
01:17:17,458 --> 01:17:19,541
both of these guilds
have remained undefeated

317
01:17:19,625 --> 01:17:22,583
up to this very point, but
that's about to change for one!

318
01:17:22,666 --> 01:17:25,416
Last round! It's on! So cool!

319

This has "feature story"
written all over it!

320
01:17:27,958 --> 01:17:30,083

You there?

01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:37,125
Huh? Say what?
I kinda zoned out.

323
01:17:37,208 --> 01:17:41,125
It's cool. But it's showtime!
The final battle!

324
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:43,458
Oh yeah, it's gonna
be a blowout.

325
01:17:43,541 --> 01:17:45,833
Have you been zoning
out this whole time?

326
01:17:45,916 --> 01:17:49,708
Scarmiglione are like the kings
of "come from behind" victories.

327
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:52,333
There's so much drama.
Can they do it again?

328
01:17:52,416 --> 01:17:54,791
Maybe. I think they might!

329
01:17:54,875 --> 01:17:58,083
[LUCY]
Yup, that's exactly my point.

330
01:17:58,166 --> 01:17:59,916
Chrisark is definitely tough.

331
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,250
It's true.

332
01:18:01,333 --> 01:18:03,291
But according to everything
I've seen from them.

333
01:18:03,375 --> 01:18:06,333
Scarmiglione's members have
gotta be tougher by a mile.

334
01:18:06,416 --> 01:18:07,708
[JASON]
Huh?

335
01:18:07,791 --> 01:18:09,416
I think every single one of them

336
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:12,208
has twice the magic power
that ol' Chrisark does.

337
01:18:12,291 --> 01:18:13,750
They've just been hiding it.

338
01:18:13,833 --> 01:18:15,875
Say what? That's crazy talk!

339
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:17,666
Why in the heck would
they wanna do that?

340
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:21,458
So they could gin up the odds
with all the bookies, obviously.

341
01:18:21,541 --> 01:18:23,208
[JASON]
What?

342
01:18:23,291 --> 01:18:25,666
Scarmiglion's gonna win.

343
01:18:26,916 --> 01:18:28,791
There's no doubt about it.

344
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:35,083
Cool!

345
01:18:35,166 --> 01:18:37,291
[CROWD cheering]

346
01:18:37,375 --> 01:18:39,791
What an upset! I'm speechless!

347
01:18:39,875 --> 01:18:41,875
Who'da thunk it? Not I.

348
01:18:41,958 --> 01:18:44,166
[MATO]
Ooh, my.

349
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:47,166
[CHAPATI] Overcoming
incredible 100-to-1 odds,

350
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:48,916
Scarmiglione takes home the gold

351
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,291
in this year's
Grand Magic Games!

352
01:18:51,375 --> 01:18:52,833
Worked like a charm.

353
01:18:52,916 --> 01:18:54,291
[CHAPATI]
That's right, folks!

354
01:18:54,375 --> 01:18:56,333
The only guild worthy of the
title "Fiore's Mightiest"

355
01:18:56,416 --> 01:18:58,583
is Scarmiglione!

356
01:18:58,666 --> 01:19:00,375
I can smell the money.

357
01:19:00,458 --> 01:19:01,666
[JASON laughs]

358
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:04,708
You nailed it, Lucy.
They're best in the land.

359
01:19:04,791 --> 01:19:07,041
I definitely never said that.

360
01:19:07,125 --> 01:19:10,291
They may have won the games
this year, but still...

361
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:13,791
Who's that?

362
01:19:13,875 --> 01:19:15,916
I have no idea.

363
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,250
[BOTH gasp]

364
01:19:17,333 --> 01:19:19,916
Hold on a minute.
Somebody's entering the arena.

365
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:20,916
Who is it?

366
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:21,666
[YAJIMA]
Hm?

367
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:22,458
[MATO]
Huh?

368
01:19:22,541 --> 01:19:23,958
[CHAPATI gasps]

369
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:29,166
[CHAPATI]
Ladies and gentlemen,

370
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:33,416
a mysterious individual has
walked onto the battlefield.

371
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,083
Who in the hell are you?

372
01:19:35,166 --> 01:19:36,750
What's going on?

373
01:19:45,291 --> 01:19:49,875
Something's weird.
So much magic power.

374
01:19:49,958 --> 01:19:52,250
Everyone needs to
get out of here!

375
01:19:59,291 --> 01:20:00,750
[SCARMIGLIONE B]
You've got guts friend,

376
01:20:00,833 --> 01:20:02,625
but you're short on brains.

377
01:20:02,708 --> 01:20:04,666
[SCARMIGLIONE C]
Wait, is this the "man in black"

378
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:05,916
people have been talking about?

379
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,166
[SCARMIGLIONE D]
Nah, there's no way.

380
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:11,125
So you clowns think you're
Fiore's greatest guild, do ya?

381
01:20:11,208 --> 01:20:12,208
Huh?

382
01:20:12,291 --> 01:20:14,208
All right, man, who are ya?

383
01:20:14,291 --> 01:20:15,500
Who me?

384
01:20:17,458 --> 01:20:19,375
[NATSU]
I'm a challenger!

385
01:20:19,458 --> 01:20:21,416
[ALL screaming]

386
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,833
He unleashed a brutal attack!

387
01:20:23,916 --> 01:20:26,750
We need to find some wizards
who can fight him off!

388
01:20:31,208 --> 01:20:32,291
[WOMAN A]
This is horrible!

389
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:33,333
[MAN A]
t's so hot!

390
01:20:33,416 --> 01:20:34,666
[MAN B]
Oww!

391
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:38,166
Hold on to your horses.
And your clothing.

392
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:41,750
The whole stadium is
melting like butter!

393
01:20:41,833 --> 01:20:44,375
[gasping]

394
01:20:45,916 --> 01:20:49,250
[LUCY]
This heat is frikkin' insane!

395
01:20:49,333 --> 01:20:50,833
[chuckles]

396
01:20:52,458 --> 01:20:54,708
This heat. Fire.

397
01:21:00,291 --> 01:21:01,083
[gasps]

398
01:21:01,166 --> 01:21:01,958
Natsu?

399
01:21:02,041 --> 01:21:04,791
[JASON]
Cool!

400
01:21:04,875 --> 01:21:06,750
It's Natsu Dragneel!

401
01:21:06,833 --> 01:21:07,833
Holy smokes!

402
01:21:07,916 --> 01:21:09,958
[MATO]
Punkin!

403
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:15,750
[HAPPY] Hey! It's been
a while. How ya doin'?

404
01:21:16,833 --> 01:21:18,166
Happy!

405
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:19,500
You're back?

406
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:21,875
Yeah, well, Natsu
insisted on challenging

407
01:21:21,958 --> 01:21:23,916
whoever won this year's
Grand Magic Games,

408
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,416
so here we are, I guess.

409
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:30,000
[LUCY] They don't seem to be
putting up much of a fight.

410
01:21:30,083 --> 01:21:32,708
Whoever wants a piece,
come and get some!

411
01:21:32,791 --> 01:21:36,875
[WIZARDS yelling]

412
01:21:36,958 --> 01:21:38,708
[NATSU]
Now we're talkin'!

413
01:21:40,291 --> 01:21:43,166
[WIZARDS screaming]

414
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:45,250
[BOTH gasp]

415
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:47,041
[WIZARD A]
Take him down!

416
01:21:47,125 --> 01:21:49,000
[WIZARDS yelling]

417
01:21:49,083 --> 01:21:50,208
[chuckles]

418
01:21:50,291 --> 01:21:53,291
[NATSU]
I'm all fired up now!

419
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:56,250
[WIZARDS gasping]

420
01:21:56,333 --> 01:21:58,416
[WIZARD A]
The place is burning up!

421
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:01,291
[WIZARD B]
I feel like I'm on fire!

422
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:03,500
No! He's a monster!

423
01:22:03,583 --> 01:22:04,833
[WIZARD E]
Run!

424
01:22:04,916 --> 01:22:06,250
He's crazy.

425
01:22:06,333 --> 01:22:09,625
But to his credit, he knows
how to make an entrance.

426
01:22:25,208 --> 01:22:29,333
Hey! Good to see ya, Lucy!
How's it goin'?

427
01:22:29,416 --> 01:22:33,000
[LUCY] At that moment,
I heard a voice inside my head.

428
01:22:33,083 --> 01:22:34,625
Pretty good.

429
01:22:36,791 --> 01:22:40,833
[LUCY] It said that Fairy Tail
is still alive and kickin'!

430
01:24:16,375 --> 01:24:19,041
[HAPPY] Whoa, can you believe
we ran into Lucy like that?

431
01:24:19,125 --> 01:24:20,666
[NATSU]
Has it really been a whole year?

432
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:23,125
[HAPPY] I gotta say, I'm in
shock Fairy Tail disbanded.

433
01:24:23,208 --> 01:24:24,666
That's seriously messed up.

434
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:27,000
[NATSU] I can't imagine how
hard it must've been on Lucy.

435
01:24:27,083 --> 01:24:28,333
[HAPPY]
I know.

436
01:24:28,416 --> 01:24:30,041
Do ya think there's anything
we can do about it?

437
01:24:30,125 --> 01:24:31,416
[NATSU]
Hmm.

438
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,750
I've got a great idea
that's sure to work!

439
01:24:33,833 --> 01:24:35,666
[HAPPY]
I can always count on you!

440
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:38,208
[NATSU]
Aw, yeah! I'm fired up now!

441
01:24:38,291 --> 01:24:40,708
[NATSU, HAPPY]
Next Time: "Message of Flame."

442
01:24:40,791 --> 01:24:41,750
[NATSU]
Let's go, Happy!

443
01:24:41,833 --> 01:24:43,666
Time to start a
brand new adventure!

444
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:45,333
[HAPPY]
Aye, sir!
