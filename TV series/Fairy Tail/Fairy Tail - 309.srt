1
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,666
Where is Zeref?

2
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,541
I need to find Zeref right now.

3
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,000
[NATSU]
He's there.

4
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,291
Natsu.

5
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,666
It's you.

6
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,333
[NATSU]
Gray.

7
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,291
[GRAY]
Natsu.

8
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,958
Move, Gray.

9
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:41,291
All this time,
you've been E.N.D.

10
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,958
Get out of my way!

11
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,166
I know it's you!

12
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,625
[NATSU]
Zeref must die.

13
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:53,708
I must kill Zeref.

14
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,041
I can't get through to you.

15
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,625
Are you still in there?

16
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:02,833
[NATSU]
Don't. Don't interfere.

17
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,791
I have to kill Zeref!

18
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:11,416
[INVEL] The demons of
the Books of Zeref.

19
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,583
They're essentially tools
His Majesty created

20
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:17,166
to bring about his own death.

21
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,000
He views his immortality
as a curse.

22
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,708
So to end his suffering,

23
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:25,500
he developed a demon
powerful enough to kill him.

24
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:29,416
Etherious Natsu
Dragneel, or E.N.D.

25
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,666
Your friend is the culmination
of decades of work.

26
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,875
The incarnation of his brother,
and his mightiest demon.

27
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,083
His Demons have one purpose.

28
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,791
It's like a homing instinct.

29
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,750
Once triggered, they
become single minded.

30
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:49,583
[INVEL] Their only thought
is that Zeref...

31
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,083
...must die.

32
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,500
[GRAY]
I can't believe it.

33
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:07,041
My mortal enemy has been
right here beside me.

34
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,458
[NATSU]
Move, Gray.

35
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,416
[GRAY] You're the one who took
everything away from me.

36
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,000
My family. Ur.

37
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,750
You and those other
demons took it all.

38
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,291
And now Juvia's gone.

39
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,000
I said move.

40
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,333
[GRAY]
This ends now, Natsu.

41
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:30,541
Nobody else dies,
except for you!

42
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,166
Get out of my way!

43
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,208
[BOTH growling]

44
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,291
[BOTH yell]

45
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:58,875
[yelling]

46
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:07,041
Well, your magic is
really something else.

47
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:10,083
Those injuries were
severe moments ago.

48
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,750
[BRANDISH]
I can shrink my wounds,

49
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:15,000
but I'm afraid I can't fix all
the damage that's been done.

50
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,541
[EVERGREEN]
So her time-stopping spell

51
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,083
didn't work on Natsu, huh?

52
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:23,083
I had no idea just how
powerful he'd become.

53
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:27,041
If only I had the ability
to shrink my confusion.

54
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:30,166
I just don't know what
to do about everything.

55
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,875
[LUCY]
That's completely normal.

56
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:37,666
Life can seem impossible
to navigate sometimes.

57
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,083
But it's really an
opportunity to grow.

58
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,500
[HAPPY]
Mh-hm. Mh-hm.

59
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,916
So I wouldn't see it
as a bad thing.

60
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,291
All it means is you're trying
to live to your fullest.

61
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,791
[HAPPY]
Let's go, Lucy!

62
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,041
[LUCY]
Yeah!

63
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,541
You girls stay here.

64
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,750
We're gonna go and find Natsu!

65
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,958
We'll talk some
sense into him!

66
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,208
[JUVIA]
My darling's out here.

67
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:08,291
Confused and alone.

68
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:12,458
I'm so worried. I just
hope I'm not too late.

69
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,000
[yells]

70
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,583
[yells]

71
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:33,916
No, Gray! You won't stop me!

72
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:41,083
Hey. Lucy.

73
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:45,625
Open your eyes.
Come on, wake up.

74
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,125
Please. Lucy!

75
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,375
No one can stop me!

76
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,500
Oh, yeah? You're wrong, Natsu!

77
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,708
I'll stop you for good!

78
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:18,000
[groaning]

79
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:23,750
Master!

80
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,208
Is everything okay?

81
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:28,916
[MAKAROV] Don't worry about
me, just keep moving!

82
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,458
That's not gonna be easy!

83
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,750
[SOLDIERS yelling]

84
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,833
There's wave after
wave of them!

85
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,625
They just keep on coming!

86
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,250
[ERZA]
Don't be afraid!

87
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,208
I'll carve a path for you!

88

--It's Erza!
--Oh, yeah!

89

[WIZARD A laughs]

90
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,458
[MAKAROV]
Thank you.

91
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:54,250
[ERZA] Master, don't push
yourself too hard.

92
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,625
Together, we'll make it
back to the guild hall.

93
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:01,041
Of course we will.
I'm no fool.

94
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,125
What in the--?

95
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,250
Whoa! A giant eyeball?

[gasps]

97
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,083
[IRENE]
You can try to hide, Mavis,

98
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,875
but it will only prove futile.

99
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,750
Nothing escapes
my all-seeing eye.

100
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,000
I'll find you.

101
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,208
[WIZARD D]
It can talk!

102
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,750
[WIZARD E]
Who's Mavis?

103
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,958
[WIZARD F]
They're after the First Master!

104
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:28,250
[YUKINO]
This power... it feels familiar.

105
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,916
Like the wizard from
the northern front.

106
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,958
[ANGEL squeals]

107
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,666
The Scarlet Despair is here.

108
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,625
I've never seen
that kind of magic!

109
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,416
It's creepin' me out.

110
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,666
Me, too. It's so scary!

111
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,458
[MAVIS] I have no intention
of hiding from you!

112
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,916
Sounds like the First Master.

113
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,041
Where is she?

114
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,083
[gasps]

115
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,750
[MAVIS] You may have
control of our guild hall

116
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,125
for the time being.

117
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,166
But we will without
a doubt reclaim it!

118

[WIZARDS gasping]

119

Hear me, my guildmates
and brothers in arms.

That's an illusion, right, guys?

125
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:18,291
Our First Master is showing
us all what she does best.

126

It's incredible.

[WIZARDS cheering]

She gives us inspiration
like no other.

And just like that,
morale rises tenfold.

So that's how it is.

She can sway them so easily
with only a few choice words.

165
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,416
Show em' what you're made of!

166
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,541
Requip! Flame Empress Armor!

167
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,291
[ERZA]
Thunder Empress Armor!

168
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:37,166
[WIZARDS cheering]

169
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,791
Purgatory Armor!

170
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,041
[ERZA yells]

171
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,500
[gasps]

172
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:56,375
[snarling]

173
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,750
They got back up!

174
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,625
[WIZARD P]
You gotta be kidding!

175
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,166
[WIZARDS screaming]

176
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,833
I don't think they
can feel pain.

177
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,416
Oh, man, we're screwed!

178
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,375
No, Dad!

179
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,666
Open your eyes, please!

180
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,166
Come on!

181
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,166
[MAKAROV]
So this is how it ends.

182
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,958
Master! We have to stay strong!

183
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,000
I will carve a path!

184
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:41,958
My journey will end here,
while my children go on.

185
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:45,083
That stance he's
taking... Fairy Law!

186
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,125
Oh, yeah! Take 'em all out!

187
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,125
We've got this in the bag, now!

188
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,333
You got this, Master!

189
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,000
Thank goodness!

190
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,250
[MAVIS]
Don't do it!

191
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,291
[WIZARD G]
First Master?

192
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,458
[WIZARD H]
Why shouldn't he?

193
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,416
[WIZARD C]
It's the only chance we've got!

194
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,708
It's too risky!

195
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,500
The more enemies
the spell targets,

196
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,791
the more it drains
your lifeforce away!

197
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,500
This army is massive!

198
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,458
There's no way
you'll survive it!

199
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:10,958
Is that true?

200
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,166
He'll die.

201
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,208
We can take care of 'em, Master!

202
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,625
It's just gonna
take some muscle!

203
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:20,250
Trust me. I'm painfully aware
of the toll this will take.

204
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,458
Let me have this.

205
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,500
One final blaze of glory.

206
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,541
But I have a plan!

207
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,833
I know of a way
we can avoid this!

208
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:28,875
You don't have to die!

209
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,416
[MAKAROV]
Shut your mouth!

210
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,625
My children are suffering
before my very eyes.

211
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,125
I have to end their pain.

212
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,458
Their lives are in my hands!

213
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:42,625
You may see them as soldiers,
or pieces in some game,

214
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,541
but to me, they're family.

215
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,500
My own flesh and blood!

216
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:51,125
No, I-I don't--

217
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,166
[MAKAROV] I realize that
any plan you may propose

218
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,083
will result in our
ultimate victory,

219
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,291
but I can't wait
for that outcome.

220
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,500
Not while my children's
blood is shed.

221
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,750
And so I have to end this!

222
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,625
An old soldier like me
has little time left,

223
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,791
and if it means the young
can go on living...

224
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,291
...I'll gladly pay that price.

225
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,500
Master!

226
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,875
Erza. Listen to me.

227
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,625
No, please! Don't do it!

228
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,375
Keep going! Let me
lead you back home!

229
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,541
[MAKAROV]
Although you may face

230
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,250
what seem like
insurmountable odds,

231
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:36,375
you will find the way forward
if you work together.

232
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,583
Trust in yourself.

233
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:41,583
But don't forget that
you're not alone.

234
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,666
This guild is a family.

235
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,500
The bond you share
is unbreakable.

236
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:50,458
My journey has been one
filled with happiness...

237
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,833
...and love...

238
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,000
...thanks to all of you.

239
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,958
Master!

240
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,916
[MAKAROV]
I will die leaving no regrets.

241
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,625
Please, kids.
Take care of each other.

242
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:17,083
So it's a parent's duty to stand
up in front of their children.

243
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,458
And though they may tremble,

244
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,583
plant their feet firmly
into the ground.

245
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,500
I will not allow you to
have our First Master!

246
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:31,500
Let's go help the First Master!

247
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,916
We're not giving a monster
like you a drop of alcohol.

248
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,500
You should respect her
more than anyone else!

249
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,625
I apologize.

250
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,750
It feels good to be
with my family again!

251
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:54,666
As long as I draw breath, I'll
protect my family at any cost!

252
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,458
And that is what it
means to be a parent.

253
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:06,166
[MAKAROV]
Fairy Law.

254
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,291
It got really quiet
all of a sudden.

255
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:41,375
I know. Wonder what happened.

256
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:45,166
What was that? I thought
I heard something.

257
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,875
That light... It's strange.

258
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:51,083
[ANGEL]
I can hardly see a thing.

259
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,041
Me, too.

260
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,500
That felt like something big.

261
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:56,958
[PORLYUSICA]
Yes.

262
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,750
Fool.

263
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,791
That damned fool.

264
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,791
Cute!

265
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,750
You really want me to name him?

266
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,958
That would be a priceless gift.

267
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,750
[MAVIS]
Makarov.

268
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,541
It's from a story
I read as a child.

269
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:57,416
[MAVIS]
The name of a kind-hearted king.

270
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:02,458
[crying]

271
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,375
Get up, First Master.
Stand strong.

272
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,708
We all still have a fight ahead.

273
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,916
And if we wanna win
this one, we need you.

274
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,375
It's what the old
geezer would want.

275
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,250
[ERZA]
Know this...

276
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:50,416
Being your child... has been
my life's greatest honor.

277
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,666
How many men did
we lose just now?

278
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,625
If I had to guess,
I'd say 70 to 80%.

279
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,875
I must admit, that
is very impressive.

280
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,750
I gave them too little credit.

281
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,875
Mavis learned that
spell from me,

282
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:12,375
and it seems that she, in turn,
passed it on to Makarov.

283
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,875
[IRENE]
Luckily, the remaining members

284
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,375
of the Spriggan Twelve
were unaffected by it,

285
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,916
so we still have the advantage.

286
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,333

287
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,375

[growls]

290
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,250
[GRAY]
You won't get past me, Natsu.

291
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,875
You hear me?!

292
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:21,083
[yelling]

293
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,458
[screams]

294
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,458
[yells]

[yelling]

[gasps]

297
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,166
[gasps]

298
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,708
How can you do this right now?

299
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,708
At a time like this?

300
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,875
Erza.

301
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,958
She's crying.

302
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,916
[LUCY] Erza's tears stop the
fight between Natsu and Gray.

303
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,291
A reminder of all they've
shared over the years.

304
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:46,125
The joys and sorrows,
triumphs and heartbreaks.

305
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:47,500
The loving voice of their family

306
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:49,791
works its song into
the warriors' hearts,

307
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:52,583
warming them as it cools
the fires of hatred.

308
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:54,791
Meanwhile, led by the
remaining Twelve,

309
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,750
Alvarez continues its onslaught.

310
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:59,875
And launches a ferocious
assault on Ishgar.

311
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:02,291
Next Time: "Pleasure and Pain."

312
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:06,958
Love can cause extreme changes--
creating life or bringing death.
