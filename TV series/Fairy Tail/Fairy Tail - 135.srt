1
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,583
[NATSU] Previously,
on Fairy Tail!

2
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,541
[LUCY] Early into our
journey to gather the pieces

3
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,166
of a mysterious clock...

4
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,583
we stumbled upon a massive
tomb underneath the desert.

5
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,500
And of course,
given our horrible luck,

6
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,500
it's filled with booby traps!

7
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,708
♪

8
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,166
Aw man, not this clown!

9
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,750
How did you guys even find
out about this place?

10
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,833
Thanks to the "Key of
the Starry Heavens".

11
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:15,916
Samuel told me the
whole story from memory.

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,625
[DAN] And guess what?
It says there's a piece

13
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,625
of the clock right here.

14
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,875
It looks to me like you
sorry losers haven't been able

15
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,208
to find it yet, either.

16
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:25,708
[DAN] Hmm?

17
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,625
Could that really be my
lovely little Lulu pumpkin

18
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:30,666
over there?

19
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,666
Don't you ever call
me that again!

20
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,875
I guess she's
kinda pumpkiny.

21
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,500
That is quite a bit
more embarrassing than

22
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,166
the names from the last time.

23
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,250
Our paths were
meant to cross again...

24
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,416
Unavoidable destiny.

25
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,166
I can practically feel
the thread of fate

26
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,458
pulling us together!

27
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,833
How about you take that
thread and wrap it

28
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,125
around your
neck instead!

29
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:48,791
[DAN] L...!

30
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:49,416
O...!

31
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,083
V...!

32
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,583
E!

33
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,916
[NATSU] Well, I'd love to get
payback for last time...!

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,083
Fire Dragon... Roar!

35
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:00,333
I can't waste my time
screwin' around like this...

36
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:03,125
Because... love beckons me
with its sweet song!

37
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:04,416
Oh yeah!

38
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,583
Somebody help me!
My butt's on fire!

39
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:09,708
My butt's on fire!!!

40
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,041
[MICHELLE] I'll spank
it out for you!

41
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,416
Natsu, you need to
be more careful!

42
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,166
That shield is a real
big pain in the butt,

43
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,416
am I right?

44
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,041
[ROMEO] We gotta
get outta here!

45
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,291
[HAPPY] Footprints of the Myth!

46
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,375
[ROMEO] They're not
coming after us...

47
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,291
[MICHELLE] Oh, I hope we
were able to lose them!

48
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,041
[NATSU] Exactly like I planned!

49
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,791
[HAPPY] You're such a liar!

50
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,750
[LUCY] Let's just find
what we came here for!

51
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:47,333
Slooow down...! My
Lovely Lulu pumpkin.

52
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,916
First you and I need to
water our garden of love!

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,416
That has got to be the
craziest thing I've ever

54
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,000
heard in my life!

55
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:56,708
[COCO] Hold on! First, you and
I need to find that clock piece.

56
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:57,958
Have you already
forgotten that we were

57
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,000
sent here on an
important mission?

58
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:03,083
Did I forget my
mission? No way!

59
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,000
I remembered
my sweet love!

60
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,500
That's kinda
my point.

61
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:07,208
[DAN] L...!

62
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:07,833
O...!

63
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:08,458
V...!

64
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:09,458
E!

65
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,958
Would you stop?!

66
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,750
No my gorgeous,
delicate skin...

67
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,333
Your bottom's
on fire again!

68
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,250
Whoops, I'm sorry
about that, Lucy!

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,333
You dare stand in the
way of our love...?

70
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:25,208
For that I'll slice you up
like a tuna and serve you raw!

71
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,666
Sounds like a good
way to go to me!

72
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,541
[DAN] Now I'm gonna give you
another taste of my magic spear!

73
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,083
Open wide 'cause
here it comes!

74
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,000
[MICHELLE] You can't
let it hit you, Natsu!

75
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,750
Listen to her, if that
thing gets you again,

76
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,625
you're gonna go right
back to shrimpy mode!

77
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,083
Yeah, well duh...!

78
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,708
And that means you're gonna
step on me like last time!

79
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,458
[DAN] Good luck
dodging this...!

80
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,208
[MICHELLE] Lucy!

81
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,791
[high-pitched] Hey... Wait...!

82
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,958
No...! No...! NO...!
This isn't happening to me!

83
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:01,583
Oh crap, I missed!
I'm so sorry my love!

84
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:04,291
I never meant for this
to happen to you!

85
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,750
I've gone and shrunk
the love of my life!

86
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,166
How could I...?!

87
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,958
There's no way you'll want
me as your boyfriend now!

88
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,833
You're right, but
turn me back anyway!

89
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,375
Why, of course, my dear.

90
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,291
Hey, what's the hold up?

91
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,958
I kinda like this cute
little version of you.

92
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,458
Huh?!

93
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,666
You were smokin' hot
as a normal sized girl,

94
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,333
but now you're like the
cutest thing I've ever seen!

95
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,750
I wanna carry you with
me everywhere I go.

96
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,583
That is not
happening!

97
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:36,791
I'm just gonna
keep you like this

98
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,000
for a little while okay?
I got a special place

99
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,125
at home for you...

100
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,208
Then I can look at
you anytime I want!

101
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:45,333
I'm not some kind of
action figure, ya weirdo!

102
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:48,041
I'll hang you right here
and we'll always be together!

103
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,291
Whoa...!

104
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,000
He turned Lucy into some
kinda good luck charm!

105
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,333
Well, she is a whole
lot cuter like this!

106
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,541
Oh gosh, I want a
little Lucy, too!

107
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,916
Would you stop being
ridiculous and help me out here?

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,458
[DAN] Now that my tiny
beloved is by my side,

109
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:04,333
I have the heart of
a lion! I fear no man!

110
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,583
And thanks to her
my aim is true!

111
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,666
[COCO] Cut it out, Dan!
You can fight him later!

112
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,541
We need to find the
clock piece first!

113
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,791
Can't you see that
I'm busy right now?

114
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,833
Go on! I'm sure
you can find it!

115
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,333
I can't because Samuel
gave you all the details

116
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:21,875
about how to find it!

117
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,416
I don't even know where
to start looking!

118
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,375
What do we do? The whole
reason we came here

119
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:29,083
was to look for one of those
missing clock thingies, too!

120
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,166
But there's no way
we can leave Lucy behind

121
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,583
when she's so
tiny and helpless!

122
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,708
[LUCY] I'm gonna hurl unless
someone can make this stop...!

123
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:40,875
Hey wait!

124
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,000
Open! Gate
of the Archer!

125
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,208
Sagittarius!

126
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:47,291
How the diddley do
do you do, my lady?

127
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,958
Great googly moogly,
I've been turned

128
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,375
teensy weensy!

129
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:51,541
Pardon me!

130
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,875
All of my Spirits were
shrunk down, too?

131
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,291
What kinda crazy sense
does that make?!

132
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,416
Although I may be no
bigger than a doormouse,

133
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,666
I was still summoned to
my lady's side in her time

134
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,083
of great and dire need!

135
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,916
Therefore, I'll defend
her with all my might!

136
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,458
Whoa! Luck is
on my side today!

137
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,833
I've had this annoying little
fish bone stuck in my teeth

138
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,500
since lunch and it's been
driving me up the freakin' wall!

139
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,875
My mighty arrows
have been reduced

140
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,041
to toothpicks?

141
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,708
Never before in my life
have I experienced

142
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,166
such heart-breaking shame!

143
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,041
Thanks for your help,
'lil horse-man!

144
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,583
To return your kindness
I'll make this quick!

145
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:26,541
That's not necessary!

146
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:27,625
I can leave on
my own accord...

147
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,333
Get outta the
way, horsie!

148
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:31,541
Oh, my body!

149
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,041
Oh no! I did it again!

150
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,458
I think you're probably
better off goin' back home.

151
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:37,833
My complete and
utter failure here

152
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,083
has me saying
toodle-loo, my good lady!

153
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,875
That may have actually
made things worse.

154
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:44,958
I know!

155
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:45,958
Huh?

156
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,458
Normally, I'd never
dream of rushing

157
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,083
anybody into this,
but if you and Lucy

158
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,791
are meant to be together,
why don't you go ahead

159
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:51,958
and get married
right here?

160
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,875
Have you gone
completely insane?!

161
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,375
[MICHELLE] This place
is historic, sacred,

162
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,666
and romantic in its
own unique way...!

163
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,041
This could be
the perfect place!

164
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,875
[DAN] No, this is the
absolute most perfect place!

165
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,208
[LUCY] You know this is
some musty, old tomb, right?

166
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,041
This is going to be the
biggest day of your life

167
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,666
so we had better
start planning!

168
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,916
I'll do whatever it takes
to make it special!

169
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,625
[MICHELLE] First off,
we need to get the invitations

170
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,083
sorted out...

171
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,500
Some folks from your side,
some folks from her side...

172
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,583
Let's try to keep it intimate...
Maybe fifty guests?

173
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,958
[DAN] Yeah, A classy, intimate
ceremony is the only way to go!

174
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,333
[MICHELLE] And then you'll
travel around the world

175
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,708
on your honeymoon!

176
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,791
[DAN] A romance at sea!

177
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,708
[MICHELLE] Stories of your
undying love will inspire

178
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:32,000
future star-gazers to name a
constellation in your honor...!

179
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,041
"The Legendary Lovers"
will dominate the night sky!

180
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,416
This is amazing!

181
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,916
The sun is rising on our
glorious new life together!

182
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,125
Do I even have
a say here?

183
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:43,625
[DAN] L...!

184
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:44,333
O...!

185
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,000
V...!

186
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,333
E!

187
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,916
I can't take any more
of this lovey-dovey crap!

188
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,833
Are we gonna duke
it out or what?!

189
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,416
Now there's a stench
that'll ruin the mood.

190
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,833
Pee-yew!

191
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,833
Romeo, are you
causing that smell?

192
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:00,708
Yeah, I am.

193
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,291
Sorry.

194
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,000
but it's the only thing I could
think of trying that might help.

195
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,333
My god!

196
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,458
It smells like
hot sewage in here!

197
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,916
This cloud of
concentrated yuckiness

198
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,041
is setting my nostrils on fire!

199
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:18,666
No!

200
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,750
Our thread of fate
has been broken!

201
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,000
I got ya!

202
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,916
[LUCY] Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Not again!

203
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Why does this keep
happening to me today?!

204
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,791
Hop on, Lucy!
I'll help you!

205
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:34,083
Hey! Give me back my
beautiful bride, cat!

206
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,666
Thanks! You're
a real life-saver!

207
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,750
Now, it's time to get
the heck outta here!

208
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,041
Aye, Sir!

209
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,958
All I have to do is turn
you back to normal size

210
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,916
and you'll fall to the ground
like a sexy sack of potatoes!

211
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:55,916
I'm back!

212
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,875
[MICHELLE] Whaaaa?!
[ROMEO] Whaaaa?!

213
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:58,958
[LUCY screams]

214
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,666
Uh-oh...

215
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,208
I guess my hand must have
slipped a little bit.

216
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,750
Wow! Happy
is a giant!

217
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,083
You suck at
that, ya know!

218
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,291
Yeah, he's right!

219
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,500
You should really learn
how to use that thing

220
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,500
before ya go whippin'
it out, ya moron!

221
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,375
I'm way too big, you
guys! I can't get out!

222
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,708
No! Please!
Happy! Stop!

223
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:24,541
Sorry! I didn't mean
to squish you again.

224
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,833
I'm starting to
think that you might

225
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,625
be doing this
on purpose, buddy.

226
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,333
Are you sure there's
not an easier way

227
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,000
to get where we're going?

228
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,333
Hate to break it
to ya but according

229
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,958
to the map we're following,
this is the only way!

230
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,791
If we were traveling
on flat ground,

231
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,625
I could get there in no time...
But all this climbing is

232
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,750
a huge pain in the butt!

233
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,791
Hey Lily, why don't you
do your teammates a favor

234
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,291
and fly us to the top
of this stupid thing?!

235
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,333
If I do that, we run
the risk of missing any

236
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,833
important clues we might
find along the way.

237
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,250
We simply can't afford
to take the easy way out!

238
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,041
Either stop with
all your whinin'

239
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,916
or get left behind!

240
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,708
As soon as we're there,
I'm gonna kill him.

241
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:15,583
[ERZA] Hmm... It would appear
we took a wrong turn somewhere.

242
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,208
It feels as if we've
been wandering around

243
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,875
aimlessly all day,
if ya ask me.

244
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,500
Don't you have the
directions to get there?

245
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,791
I have a map but the
details are extremely vague.

246
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,500
I'm afraid that we're
just going to have to rely

247
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:30,250
on these road signs
to show us the way.

248
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,750
[CARLA] That's all well and
good, but can anybody tell me

249
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,833
which direction this sign
is actually pointing?

250
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,333
Now that you mention it,
it is a bit confusing.

251
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,958
Yes, to say the least...

252
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,708
You don't suppose that
this could be somebody's

253
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,833
sick idea of a prank?

254
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,916
[CANA] That'd be a really
crappy thing to do...

255
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,208
Besides, isn't it a crime to
change the direction of a sign?

256
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,458
One wrong turn could put
somebody in real danger.

257
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,916
We should at least
be getting closer...

258
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,958
Let's proceed with caution
while checking the map as well.

259
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,125
Is it really just
a random prank?

260
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,791
Or could it be someone
deliberately trying

261
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,625
to steer us
off course?

262
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,333
[HAPPY screams]

263
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,625
Stop flying
around, Happy!

264
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,166
If I get back on the
ground, I'm afraid

265
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,791
I'm gonna squish somebody!

266
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,041
I know these are ruins,
but they're part of

267
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:40,708
Fiore's history! We can't
afford to ruin them any further!

268
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,541
I'm more afraid of these
rocks ruining my skull!

269
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,916
[DAN] Alright, you
overgrown flea-bag!

270
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:53,708
[HAPPY screams]

271
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,708
Quit freakin' out,
you're normal.

272
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,458
Everyone's finally
back to regular size!

273
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,791
We gotta find that
missing clock piece.

274
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,666
I hated bein'
a monster!

275
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,500
[ROMEO] But how are we
gonna find the stupid thing

276
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,875
if we don't even know
where to start looking?

277
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,333
Don't worry...

278
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,958
I brought the book along with
me to help us figure out

279
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,541
some more clues.

280
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,375
I have no doubt it'll point us
in the right direction at least.

281
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,000
[COCO] If we get our
hands on that book,

282
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,125
we could find the
piece in no time!

283
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,250
So hand it over, blondie!

284
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,458
Get back!

285
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,208
Hey now!

286
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,416
[LUCY] This is our chance!

287
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,791
You can't run from us!

288
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,125
[NATSU] Good, cause I ain't
runnin'! I'm stayin' right here!

289
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,541
'Cause I still owe you
a serious butt kickin'!

290
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,458
Thanks for holding
him off, Natsu!

291
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,750
Just try not to let
him step on you again!

292
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,416
The only one who ever
stepped on me was you!

293
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,625
[COCO] Get back here!

294
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,583
If you stand in my
way be prepared to pay

295
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,125
the ultimate price!

296
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm ready to settle
the score once and for all!

297
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,250
I've got you now!

298
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,500
No you don't!

299
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,041
So where's the
piece?! Have you

300
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,416
figured it out yet?!

301
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,208
I'm still
looking. Uhhh...

302
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:07,000
[bonk]
[LUCY screams]

303
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:11,333
[rumbling]

304
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:18,625
[COCO] Aw man! I guess I
ran out of magic power...

305
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,291
[LUCY] Hold this!

306
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,916
[LUCY] Grab
my hand!

307
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,708
I can't accept
an enemy's mercy!

308
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,916
Would you quit being
so darn stubborn?!

309
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:37,958
[gasps]

310
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,416
[relieved sigh]

311
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,583
[BOTH moan and groan]

312
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,375
[MICHELLE] Oh no,
Lucy! Are you okay?!

313
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,541
I'm still alive,
at least!

314
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,250
[ROMEO] Hang on! We're
coming down to help you!

315
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,541
[LUCY] No, don't
worry about me...!

316
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:00,333
You guys just hurry up
and find that clock piece!

317
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,625
We'll meet up
eventually, I'm sure!

318
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,708
[MICHELLE] Oh, I'm
worried about her...

319
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,666
I mean, she's stuck down there
with that horrible little girl.

320
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,916
[HAPPY] Well, she does have her
Celestial Spirits with her too,

321
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,416
so she'll probably be fine.

322
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,666
Yeah. Let's go. We can't
help her from up here anyway.

323
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,166
[MICHELLE] We'll find it
Lucy! But please be careful!

324
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,291
[LUCY] Yeah, you too!

325
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,500
Owie...

326
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,041
Hey... are you hurt?

327
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,791
You get away from me!
In case you didn't notice,

328
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,875
your so-called "help" is
how we got stuck down here

329
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,291
in the first place!

330
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,708
You better watch
your mouth little girl,

331
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,083
unless you wanna end up
someplace a whole lot worse!

332
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,875
I can't think of any
place worse than being trapped

333
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,291
down here with you!

334
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,875
What is with
the attitude? Ya know,

335
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,708
I once met someone who looks
and sounds a lot like you;

336
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,458
except she wasn't such a brat!

337
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,458
[COCO] Wow...
What a great story.

338
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,000
Obviously that wasn't me,
so get over it!

339
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,583
So... what exactly
is the Legion Platoon's

340
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,166
goal here anyway? Why're
you trying to collect

341
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,625
all the clock pieces?

342
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,541
What's with all this
"holy war" and "chaos" stuff?!

343
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,416
Well, I got a
question for you!

344
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,750
If you don't know
what we're doing,

345
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,458
then why are you and your
friends trying to stop us?

346
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,833
We're trying to figure
everything out, that's all...

347
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,458
Why? Is there something
else we should be doing?

348
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,666
Yeah, how about
leaving us alone?!

349
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,125
You guys are nothin' but
a bunch of crappy wizards.

350
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,500
You might as well give
up while you still can.

351
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,708
[LUCY] Isn't she
a ray of sunshine?

352
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,666
We need to be careful...
There's probably a lot more

353
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,416
of those booby
traps everywhere.

354
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,416
I know, genius! The
builders put them here

355
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,916
to stop grave robbers
like you and your buddies.

356
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,416
You're here for the exact
same reason as we are!

357
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,250
[COCO] Look out!

358
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,625
Thanks...
You saved my life!

359
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,583
There's need to thank me.
You tried to save me earlier,

360
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,583
I'm returning the favor
by actually saving you.

361
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:08,500
Are you seriously this
unfriendly all of the time?

362
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,041
It's weird because you're
so much like the other

363
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:13,333
Coco I know... Except
she's a million times nicer.

364
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:16,666
That so? Well then,
how am I like this other girl?

365
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,041
[LUCY] Besides
your personality,

366
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,083
you two are
practically identical.

367
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,375
[COCO] What?

368
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,916
Like I was saying earlier,
she looks and sounds

369
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,916
exactly like you, and
we actually started out

370
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,500
as enemies, too. But by the
end, she'd become one of

371
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,625
my closest friends.

372
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,041
That sounds
nothing like me.

373
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,041
Because I would never
be friends with a stupid

374
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,083
wannabe wizard like you!

375
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,666
You don't have
to get so personal;

376
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,458
we're just worried putting the
clock together is gonna cause

377
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,041
major some problems.

378
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,541
We're trying to stop a worldwide
disaster from happening.

379
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,375
You know, the whole
"inevitable chaos" thing?

380
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,791
Do you guys honestly
think we want

381
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,666
to destroy the world?

382
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,791
We really don't
know what you want.

383
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,666
Personally, I'm just hoping
to try and understand

384
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,583
what in the heck my dad
was tryin' to tell me.

385
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:57,958
Yeah, your dad...

386
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,833
You're the daughter of
Jude Heartfilia, aren't you?

387
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:04,041
He was one of the richest
businessmen in the country.

388
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,333
[LUCY] I may be his daughter,
but I can't say that we ever

389
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,375
saw eye-to-eye on much.

390
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:11,125
And this is no exception;
I mean, why would anybody go

391
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,875
to all the trouble to
hide pieces of a clock

392
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,250
in all these weird,
hard to find places?

393
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,208
I can't help thinking
there had to be an easier way

394
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,500
to go about it.

395
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:21,083
That may be the one
thing we agree on.

396
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,875
[amused sigh]

397
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,625
You wanna tell
me what's so funny?!

398
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,375
Nothing! Well, I was
actually just thinking

399
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,333
that you're kind
of silly, that's all.

400
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:32,041
Hey, I don't appreciate
you saying that about me.

401
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:35,958
Sorry, I didn't mean
it as an insult... Hold on.

402
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,083
It's a dead-end.

403
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,125
You think maybe we should
turn around and go back?

404
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,416
Geez... You don't
know anything, do ya?

405
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,750
Places like this always
have secret hidden exits.

406
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,041
[LUCY] No! Don't touch that!

407
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:56,125
[rumbling]

408
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,625
[crash]

409
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,125
Coco!

410
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,875
Oh my gosh!
Are you okay?!

411
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,500
[HAPPY] Lucy!

412
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,833
Thank goodness you're
alive! I was so worried!

413
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:14,958
Hey!

414
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,583
Come over here and
we can pull you up!

415
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,916
I probably would've just
left her there if I were you.

416
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,375
Yeah, but that just
didn't feel right to me.

417
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,125
According to the
information Lucy gave us...

418
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,958
we should be sitting on top
of one of the clock pieces

419
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,875
right about now.

420
00:19:58,958 --> 00:19:59,833
Hmmm...

421
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:00,708
If that's the case,

422
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,625
how come nobody's seen it yet?

423
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:08,333
[groans and panting]

424
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,666
I was afraid we'd
never get up that cliff.

425
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,500
The air's so
thin up here.

426
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,333
Not to mention
super cold.

427
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:17,291
You creampuffs better
get over it. Now c'mon...

428
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,500
Move your butts.

429
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,750
Will you let us catch
our breath for a minute?

430
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,125
I don't even think
I can move right now.

431
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,958
I gotta eat
somethin'.

432
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:28,291
Oh no, I think we climbed
the wrong mountain!

433
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,541
The clock piece is on
that mountain over there!

434
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,541
Looks like we've got
more climbing to do!

435
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,833
[ALL] Say what??!!

436
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,833
[chuckles] I'm just kidding
but those looks are priceless.

437
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,208
[smirks]

438
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,708
Huh?

439
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,125
[PANTHERLILY] I was trying
to lighten the mood with

440
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:51,541
a little humor, but I guess it
backfired. Learn to take a joke.

441
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,833
[GAJEEL] I'm still not
seein' any clock pieces.

442
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,166
Which means... the
stupid thing's probably

443
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,333
buried up here
somewhere, I'll bet.

444
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,166
So what do we do now?

445
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,791
We're here! We've
finally found it!

446
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,083
The Library of Sorcery
holds countless texts

447
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:22,291
on almost every type of magic
that's ever been practiced.

448
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,958
It's quite impressive.

449
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:28,208
[CANA] Yeah, no joke. The
place is freakin' humongous.

450
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,500
[WENDY] But it doesn't
look like anybody's

451
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,708
been here in a long time.

452
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,333
That's a real tragedy.

453
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,916
All that knowledge just
waiting to be learned.

454
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,541
[gasps]

455
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,666
[CANA] You're tellin' me all
these books are about magic?!

456
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,416
What a wonderful sight
to behold, don't you think?

457
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,208
Yeah, We should come
back here sometime

458
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,500
and bring Levy.

459
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:58,250
My word! So many books
full of ancient wisdom.

460
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,916
[gasps]

461
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,416
[shock]

462
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,333
[confused sound]

463
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:14,125
[NATSU] Fire Dragon Roar!

464
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,666
Take this!

465
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:23,500
[DAN] I'm sick and tired
of messin' around with you!

466
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:25,500
I could say the same
thing to you, pal.

467

00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,125
[NATSU] Man, that smell
is really familiar.

474
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:16,458
[HAPPY] What smell?

475
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:17,666
[NATSU] It's weird...
It's either from somebody

476
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,625
who helped me when
I was feelin' sick...

477
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,166
Or from somebody
who attacked me.

00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,791
[HAPPY] Those are
totally different things!

479
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:23,875
So which one is it?

480
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:25,875
Is it a good guy
smell or bad guy smell?

481
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,791
[NATSU] It's the smell of
someone who's pretty harmless,

482
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,791
but acts like a
really bad guy?

[HAPPY] Hmm... So, what
does that smell like?

485
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:38,125
[NATSU] I guess it's kinda
like a black unitard...

486
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:41,291
[HAPPY] That doesn't sound
like a good smell to me!
