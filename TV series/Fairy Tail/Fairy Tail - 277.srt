This is serious!

The only reason you're here now

00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,750
You guys are so full of crap!

162
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,541
It was me that
caught the fishie!

163
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,916
[MIRIN] Well, if that's true,
then you stole it from us!

164
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,541
Mt. Altana is on our turf!

165
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,208
[MASTER G]
That means everything that grows

166
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,708
or lives here is ours!

167
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:45,041
[TROM] So if you want this fish
back, you're gonna have to--

168
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,333
[NATSU]
I know.

169
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,125
Take it by force?

170
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,166
Like how you guys beat
up poor little Happy

171
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,416
and took it from him?

172
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,958
[MASTER G] We didn't beat
anybody up for it!

173
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,583
[DABO]
What's he talking about?

174
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:55,958
There's a pretty hefty price

175
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,458
for makin' my best
friend cry, ya know?!

176
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,250
Simmer down.

177
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,625
[TROM]
Oh, man! He's a fire wizard?

178
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,125
[MIRIN]
Master!

179
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:07,458
[MASTER G] In that case, we have
no other choice! Get 'im!

180
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:08,750
[TROM, MIRIN, DABO]
Yeah!

181
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,833
[TROM]
Iron Make: Needle Hammer!

182
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,791
[NATSU yells]

183
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,041
[NATSU] Hand over the fishie
and no one else gets hurt.

184
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,708
[MIRIN] This guy is packing
serious firepower.

185
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,541
[MASTER G]
Why don't ya cool him down?

186
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:32,541
[MIRIN]
Yeah! Solid Script!

187
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,041
Blizzard!

188
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,375
Oh, yeah?

189
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,166
Oh, no!

190
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,625
[HAPPPY screams]

191
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,583
That was nothin'!

192
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,416
[DABO] We're in serious trouble!
This guy is a freak!

193
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,708
[MASTER G] Wait, I recognize
him from somewhere!

194
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:53,541
Pink hair. And a scarf
that looks like scales.

195
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,083
[DABO]
Whoa! No way!

196
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,958
[MASTER G] Yeah.
That's impossible. His guild--

197
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:02,666
[NATSU]
Fire Dragon Roar!

198
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:09,041
[laughing]

199
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,291
Natsu.

200
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,000
Don't you think
you might've gone

201
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,958
a little overboard
with the fire?

202
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,750
I said I'd get our fish back.

203
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,958
So that's all I'm
doin' here, okay?

204
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,208
--[MASTER G] Let go!
--[DABO] Stop pushin'!

205
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,916
[MASTER G]
You're supposed to shield me!

206
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,416
[MIRIN]
Sorry, Master, I'm trying!

207
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,666
Oh, wow.

208
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,750
I think they're startin'
to fight themselves.

209
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,375
[NATSU] I can't believe the way
you're acting right now.

210
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:30,208
[HAPPY]
Huh?

211
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,958
I thought you're in a guild!

212
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:35,833
You're supposed to have each
other's backs no matter what!

213
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,083
And fight your common enemy!

214
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:41,541
[WIZARDS screaming]

215
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:42,708
[screams]

216
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,083
[HAPPY] No! You're
gonna burn the fishie!

217
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:49,083
[yells]

218
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,916
[MASTER G]
He's a demon.

219
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,041
Here's your fish, Happy.

220
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:09,916
Eat your fill, but save
some for me, okay?

221
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,791
You're such a big dummy.

222
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,666
See?! It's things like this!

223
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,125
All of that fighting
and commotion

224
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,458
and we both still
went hungry that night!

225
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,833
Sounds like him.
Captain Overkill!

226
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,833
So you guys were the ones
who melted Mt. Altana?

227
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,375
They thought it was
a natural disaster!

228
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,625
It was all over the news!

229
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:31,000
I guess so. But I don't
remember any of it happening.

230
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,083
Hey, sorry,

231
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,666
I need to take a little
bathroom break!

232
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,458
[HAPPY] Hang on, Natsu! We're
still in the middle of lunch!

233
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,125
[NATSU]
Gotta make room for more!

234
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,875
You two really haven't
changed at all, have you?

235
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,416
It's actually kinda reassuring.

236
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,708
[HAPPY] You know what
really bothered me

237
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,458
about the whole thing?

238
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:50,625
After he beat those guys, Natsu
said something in his sleep.

239
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,125
[LUCY]
What was it?

240
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,958
[HAPPY] He said he'll
teach a lesson to anyone

241
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:57,041
who doesn't treat their
friends like family.

242
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,291
He really said that?

243
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,583
[HAPPY]
I mean, I agree with him.

244
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,125
But what kind of person

245
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:06,041
would turn a friend's yummy
fishie into a pile of ashes?

246
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:06,916
Uh?

247
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,833
Hey, Lucy. Are you feelin' okay?

248
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,458
Uh, yeah.

249
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,333
[HAPPY]
Huh. You sure?

250
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:20,708
[JASON]
This is so cool!

251
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:21,958
There it is!

252
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:25,291
This year the victor is
no guild! It's Fire Boy!

253
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,291
That has got to be the
freakin' coolest headline

254
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,166
Sorcerer Weekly's ever had!

255
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,500
You haven't seen Lucy
around, have ya?

256
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,916
No. Not lately.

257
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,500
I swear.

258
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:38,833
We get a massive scoop like this
and she just up and disappears?

259
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,541
Oh, it's cool.

260
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,208
Are you sure?

261
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:49,791
[HAPPY]
Ask her.

262
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,541
[NATSU]
Yeah, okay.

263
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,291
Hey, Lucy?

264
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,958
[LUCY]
What?

265
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,666
Something happened, right?

266
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:04,041
[NATSU] Come on, I can tell
when you're feelin' sad.

267
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,458
[HAPPY]
You start actin' all weird,

268
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,041
just like you are right now.

269
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,166
[sighs]

270
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,916
I guess you guys still
don't know, huh?

271
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,083
[BOTH]
Huh?

272
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:19,208
Right after you left...
the guild broke up.

273
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,500
[BOTH]
Huh?

274
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,750
I just can't believe it.
How could that happen?

275
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:37,958
I know I just ate,

276
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,041
but I really need a
fish right about now.

277
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,083
[LUCY]
I would've told you,

278
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,708
but I didn't know
where you were.

279
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:46,083
This has to be some
kinda joke, right?

280
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:53,833
[LUCY] I wish it was,
but it really happened.

281
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,791
[NATSU]
Do you know where Gramps is now?

282
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,208
I'm gonna kick his butt!

283
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:01,291
And after that, I'll rip out
what's left of his hair.

284
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,583
You gotta leave his
mustache, at least.

285
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,291
[LUCY] Nobody knows
what happened to him.

286
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:11,750
[NATSU] What about Erza and
Gray? Where'd they go?

287
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:12,958
You know?

288
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,416
[LUCY] Everybody went
their separate ways.

289
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,208
I haven't seen them.

290
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,375
No one? You haven't
even kept in touch?

291
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:27,000
Fairy Tail split up and no one
even gives a crap about it?

292
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,625
That's not true.

293
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,625
Well, it seems like it to me!

294
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:35,041
I mean, why didn't anyone try
to stop it from happening?!

295
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,375
If Gramps really wanted to quit,

296
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,583
he coulda made Laxus
the new master!

297
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,125
I don't think you have
any room to talk, Natsu.

298
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,541
You weren't there.

299
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,250
Say what?

300
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,916
Can you honestly say you
were thinking about the guild

301
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,708
when you decided to run
away for a whole year?

302
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,333
You just took off.

303
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,583
You didn't even talk
to any of us about it.

304
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,583
It wasn't like that.

305
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:03,750
Sorry. I'm not telling you
how to live your lives.

306
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,458
I know you had your
reasons for leaving.

307
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,375
[LUCY sighs]

308
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,958
Yeah, I know Master
and everyone else

309
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:20,083
had their own reasons
for taking off, too.

310
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,208
Oh, wow!

311
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,583
Fancy!

312
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,666
[NATSU]
You actually live here?

313
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,125
[HAPPY] I can't believe you
moved out of Magnolia.

314
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,708
[LUCY]
Yup. This is my new place.

315
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,750
You don't have anywhere
to stay, do ya?

316
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,500
You can crash here for a while.

317
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,083
[NATSU] Oh, thank you,
merciful goddess Lucy!

318
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,083
[HAPPY]
We're not worthy!

319
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,625
[LUCY chuckles nervously]

320
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,083
But you gotta promise you
won't mess anything up!

321
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:56,041
And if I find you in my bedroom,
you're gonna be dead meat!

322
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,208
[HAPPY laughing]

323
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:00,625
I just told you not
to mess anything up!

324
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:03,125
You better clean up after
yourselves, ya hear me?!

325
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,250
Your panty collection
has grown quite a bit!

326
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,208
Get the heck outta my dresser!

327
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:11,958
Snip! Snip! Snip!

328
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,166
I feel like I got
a brand new head!

329
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,541
Baby.

330
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,458
[sighs]

331
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,416
his is so relaxing.

332
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,541
You sure you don't
wanna join us, Lucy?

333
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,250
[LUCY]
n your dreams!

334
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:27,958
[NATSU]
Just like that.

335
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,208
[LUCY laughs]

336
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,583
[HAPPY] I don't know
why you're laughing.

337
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,208
It wasn't funny at all.

338
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,041
We ran out of money
right after we left,

339
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,666
so we had find some jobs to do.

340
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,083
Just to earn a little
Jewel to get by.

341
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:42,208
[LUCY] Oh, and I bet Natsu spent
all of it on food, didn't he?

342
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,750
Of course!

343
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,958
I only eat fish and that comes
from hard work and patience.

344
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,375
But this guy's like a
walking bottomless pit!

345
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,666
Don't try to pretend like you
caught everything you ate.

346
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,083
You bought most of it and
you never stop eating.

347
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,291
Well, you ate a whole
lot more than me.

348
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,500
We had to wash dishes
to pay off our tab.

349
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,375
It made me wish Mira had
taught us how to do it

350
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,583
without breakin' 'em.

351
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,208
Because then we had to
work those off, too!

352
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,708
I'd be surprised if that
only happened the one time.

353
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,041
Yeah, you're right.

354
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,833
The point is, Natsu
would never've made it

355
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,958
if I weren't there
to help him out.

356
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,625
Say what? I woulda
made it just fine, buddy!

357
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,666
I've had to bail your butt outta
trouble too many times to count!

358
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,833
[NATSU]
Oh, is that so?

359
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,708
How about you try
counting a few of 'em?

360
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,791
I want specifics!
Dates, times, and places!

361
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,250
[HAPPY] You see how
I'm still the only one

362
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,416
who acts like a grownup, right?!

363
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,041
You're full of it, cat!

364
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,750
Oh. I almost forgot
to mention it.

365
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:35,458
We ran into Gildarts. In the
middle of some random forest.

366
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,291
[LUCY]
Really? What happened?

367
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,791
[NATSU]
Ha-ha! I fought him, of course.

368
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,666
Did I even have to ask?

369
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,416
[NATSU]
Still hurts a little.

370
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,125
Then what next?

371
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,583
[HAPPY]
Yeah, and?

372
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,375
So you guys helped destroy
another mountain, did ya?

373
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,458
And guess what happened next!

374
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,375
Ooh, do tell.

375
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,333
[HAPPY] Ol' Gildarts
and Natsu walked away

376
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,375
with each other's
bags by mistake.

377
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,666
[LUCY]
Yeah?

378
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:40,125
[HAPPY] Well, when we decided
to stop for lunch...

379
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,666
[HAPPY]
...he ran up and attacked Natsu

380
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,583
with tears runnin'
down his face!

381
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,125
That makes sense.

382
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,958
There were probably a bunch
of pictures of Cana in there.

383
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,333
[HAPPY] We didn't get much
of a chance to look at 'em.

384
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,666
I win for the
seventh time in a row!

385
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,750
Aw, no way!

386
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,666
All right, I call for a rematch!

387
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,875
[LUCY]
Another one?!

388
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,916
[NATSU] We're gonna keep
playin' till I win!

389
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,083
[NEIGHBOR A] Keep it down,
or I'll have you evicted!

390
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:12,041
[LUCY] Wow. Tonight brought
back so many memories.

391
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,041
Hey, Happy?

392
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,208
[HAPPY]
Aye, sir?

393
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:25,916
Our guild... doesn't
exist anymore.

394
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,208
Hard to believe it's true.

395
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,583
[NATSU]
I know!

396
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,375
Let's draw on Lucy's face
while she's asleep!

397
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:38,541
[HAPPY] Wouldn't be a sleep-over
without a little prankery!

398
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,625
[NATSU giggles]

399
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,833
She's sawin' logs.

400
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,291
[HAPPY] Careful not
to wake her up, okay?

401
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,083
I'm gonna do it
nice and steady.

402
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,833
[HAPPY]
So what're you gonna draw?

403
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:57,333
[NATSU] Duh. A mustache,
a big ol' unibrow.

404
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,875
Maybe even a full on beard.

405
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,000
[gasps]

406
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,625
What is this?

407
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,333
She's tracking everybody.

408
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,625
Some of these
have a lot of info.

409
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,125
Eyewitness reports and
specific dates and times

410
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,708
when they were last seen.

411
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,458
Amazing.

412
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,750
[LUCY]
Uh, what's going on?

413
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:49,791
[SOLDIER A]
This is the place!

414
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,708
[SOLDIER B]
Should we bust in, sir?!

415
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,833
[LUCY] A buncha soldiers
standing outside my door

416
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,958
is not the kinda thing
I wanna wake up to!

417
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,875
So they've found us
already, huh?

418
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,041
Aye, sir!

419
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,791
The army came looking for you?!

420
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,291
Let's go, Lucy!

421
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,791
What kinda trouble
are you in now?!

422
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:06,708
[SOLDIERS gasp]

423
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,291
[NATSU]
Nothin' we can't outrun!

424
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,125
[NATSU laughs]

425
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,250
[SOLDIER C]
There he is!

426
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,083
[SOLDIER D]
He's the one responsible!

427
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,750
I didn't do anything wrong!

428
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,041
I'm just getting kidnapped!

429
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,833
What did you do
this time, Natsu?!

430
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,875
[NATSU giggles]

431
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:25,625
[NATSU] I just left a
message about Fairy Tail!

432
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,833
Telling everyone
we're comin' back!

433
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,041
[SOLDIER F]
Fairy Tail?!

434
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,083
[SOLDIER G]
The palace is burning!

435
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,333
We let him go.

436
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,083
That troublemaker.

437
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:38,041
Fine. Fine. It's okay.

438
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,833
Summon the Hungry Wolf Knights!

439
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,625
[JASON]
Fairy Tail's back?! Cool!

440
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,791
This scoop is gonna be massive!

441
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:49,541
Best of luck to ya, Lucy!
And try to stay cool.

442
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,583
That type of fire goes
out super quickly,

443
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,416
so everything's gonna be okay!

444
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,625
That's not the only
problem here, Happy!

445
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,625
How can you just announce
Fairy Tail's comeback?

446
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,458
'Cause we all
still believe in it!

447
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,250
We're gonna get
everyone together.

448
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,833
And the guild'll be
better than ever!

449
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,916
[laughs]

450
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,458
Come on!

451
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,875
[LUCY]
Yeah!

452
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,583
I wonder how far
we can get today!

453
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:52,750
We're gonna get just
as far as we can!

454
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,708
If I had to take a wild guess,

455
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:56,083
I'd say we'll
make it to the city

456
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:58,208
on the other side
of that mountain!

457
00:23:58,291 --> 00:23:59,625
[LUCY] Well, if we're
gonna travel that far,

458
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,625
we should take a train
or something, right?

459
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:02,791
[NATSU]
Are you crazy?!

460
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,000
Just thinkin' about
makes me wanna hurl!

461
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:08,166
[LUCY] And so, we continue
our eternal adventure!

462
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,208
Let's keep moving on!
