1
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,666
As I've said, I dislike humans,

2
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,625
but they can be so entertaining.

3
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:26,958
You, defeating the
Underworld King?

4
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:28,166
Ridiculous.

5
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,833
Just watch us!

6
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:31,416
[NARRATOR]
The Twin Dragons of Sabertooth

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,125
came to the aid of
their fallen guildmate

8
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,291
and took on Mard Geer himself.

9
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:38,791
This gave Minerva, Erza, and
the Exceeds a chance to escape.

10
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:42,125
The group searched the ruins of
Plutogrim for the control room,

11
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,291
hoping to stop the detonation
of thousands of Face bombs.

12
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:48,875
But the fungal Franmalth
proves to be a deceptive guide.

13
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,208
[TORAFUZAR] Only the full
might of the Etherious

14
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:53,708
can conquer such powerful foes.

15
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,875
[TEMPESTER]
Let's end this.

16
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,125
[NARRATOR] Natsu and Gajeel
kicked into high gear

17
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,541
and switched to their
dual-element modes,

18
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:06,416
combining lightning and
shadow with fire and iron.

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,291
But will this be enough to
conquer the bloodthirsty demons

20
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,833
in their terrifying
Etherious forms?

21
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:12,958
[NATSU yelling]

22
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:15,750
[GAJEEL yelling]

23
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:20,125
Who have they turned into?

24
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:23,708
Flame Lotus Exploding
Lightning Blade!

25
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:32,041
Iron Shadow Dragon Roar!

26
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:35,833
You'll meet your demise in
the depths of the Underworld.

27
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:38,541
Dark Deluge!

28
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,416
[NARRATOR]
Our heroes put up a good fight,

29
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,708
but Torafuzar unleashed
his "Dark Deluge" curse,

30
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:48,500
engulfing everything in a wave
of black, poisonous water.

31
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:51,166
With his comrades rendered
unconscious by the flood,

32
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,541
Gajeel found himself
running out of options,

33
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,083
and running out of air.

34
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,416
But then...

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,291
[GAJEEL]
Don't you touch her!

36
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,958
Levy!

37
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,875
Pull yourself together!
Wake up, kid!

38
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,333
You gave me that breath
of air just now, right?

39
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,083
There more where
that came from?

40
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,500
[LEVY]
He wants me to do it again?

41
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,708
[LEVY gasps]

42
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,250
[LEVY] Uh, hang on! I think
he's got the wrong idea!

43
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,458
I knew he was in trouble,

44
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,791
so I shared some of my
own breath with him!

45
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,750
[GAJEEL] Hurry up and give
the others some air, too!

46
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,375
They're gonna drown
if you don't!

47
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,541
[LEVY] But if I do that,
I won't have any left.

48
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,041
I don't wanna drown with them.

49
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,708
I mean, I didn't even
know if it would work,

50
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,375
and the only reason I gave it
to him because he was closest.

51
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,166
Yeah, that's it!

52
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,166
What in the hell
are ya stallin' for?

53
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,375
Use your magic and
make us some air!

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,625
[LEVY] Yeah, he's right!
What the heck was I thinking?

55
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,375
I should've written an
air spell to begin with

56
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,500
instead of doing that!

57
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,125
How embarrassing!

58
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:58,416
Solid Script Air!

59
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,916
[BOTH gasping]

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,125
Sorry!

61
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,625
They're still breathing?

62
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,708
[GAJEEL] Now help
Salamander and the others!

63
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:12,791
[LEVY]
Right!

64
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,375
I owe you kiddo. Big time!

65
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:43,416
[yelling]

66
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,666
[screaming]

67
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:05,083
Behold the greatest defense
of the Nine Demon Gates.

68
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,791
I can alter my body's hardness

69
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,125
to deflect whatever
attack comes at me.

70
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:12,500
Therefore, my skin is
resistant to your pitiful iron.

71
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:16,000
[GAJEEL]
Damn.That hurt.

72
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,000
The iron on your
skin helped stave off

73
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,583
the poison in the water,

74
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,250
but it's abundantly clear that
you are finally starting to feel

75
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,416
its effects.

76
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,875
You just bought enough time to
see all your comrades perish.

77
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,291
[growls]

78
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,208
Humanity's era is over.

79
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,166
You did put up a valiant effort,

80
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,958
but you were no match
for the Dark Deluge.

81
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,500
The poison will slow down
your body's processes,

82
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:47,041
and then everyone in your guild
will drown together as one.

83
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,958
[LEVY] We have some air for now,
but the carbon in the water

84
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:53,208
means it'll be
hard to make more.

85
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:56,541
If we're trapped here much
longer, we're gonna die.

86
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,583
[TORAFUZAR]
This is the end for you!

87
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,208
[LEVY]
C'mon, Gajeel.

88
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,333
[ORG]
And once again,

89
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:21,625
we have Gajeel of
Phantom Lord before us.

90
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:26,958
Honestly now, how many times
has it been just this year?

91
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,458
[GAJEEL chuckles]

92
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,333
[BELNO]
Gajeel, wait!

93
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,291
For another lecture?

94
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,833
Don't ask me why I
waste my breath on you,

95
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,375
but you should strongly consider
leaving Phantom Lord.

96
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,625
I'll leave when
I'm ready to leave.

97
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,625
It's none of your business.

98
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,625
When guilds engage in
such wretched behavior,

99
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,291
it is my business.

100
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,250
It must be stopped.

101
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,708
[GAJEEL]
I think you'd better stop.

102
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,125
You know you're talking
to Black Steel Gajeel,

103
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,750
the Iron Dragon
Slayer, right, hag?

104
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,458
[BELNO]
"Iron-Headed," you mean.

105
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,875
I've seen countless
tough guys like you,

106
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,000
all with a huge chip
on their shoulder.

107
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:15,166
And all you really want to try
to do is hide your loneliness.

108
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,041
The hell you say?!

109
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:20,125
[BELNO] I know that being a
"do-gooder" isn't your style.

110
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,750
However,

111
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:25,333
someone like you could live
a life that has true meaning.

112
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,875
[laughing]

113
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,791
Oh yeah? My life's
got tons of meaning!

114
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,541
Actually, I've got
something big happenin' soon.

115
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,333
We're taking down
those Fairy failures!

116
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,833
[NATSU] Check it out, Lucy, it's
like this job was made for us!

117
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,333
Don't waste my time, Natsu!

118
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,250
I need to pay my
rent this month!

119
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,666
This one's a piece of cake!

120
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,083
Then we'll take another one
and make more money!

121
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,416
"In search of somebody
who can teach me

how to grill tasty,

123
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,208
You've gotta be kidding me.

124
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,666
That sounds like something
that takes a little finesse,

125
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,625
and I'll bet you don't even
know what that word means.

you want an expert on how to
make the yummiest fishies,

then look no further
than yours truly.

Although I prefer it so
raw, it's still wiggling.

131
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,208
That sounds disgusting.

132
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:26,375
But maybe you and I should have
a little cook off, ya down?

133

Aye, sir! Hope you like
the taste of shame!

bigger waste of time!

It would seem that this
killer is the stealthy type.

[GAJEEL] I failed. I should've
gotten here sooner.

We did our best.

[GAJEEL] You told me I could
live a life with true meaning.

00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,250
I wish I could've gotten
the chance to let you know

that I took those
words to heart.

To show you who I've become.

Even though I was
a no good punk,

All I can do now is get revenge.

159
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:08,125
No, I should heed your
advice more than ever.

160
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:13,166
That's the best way I can
truly honor your life.

161
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,458
I'll never forget what else
you said to me that day.

162
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,708
The truth be told, you remind me
quite a bit of my own late son.

163
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,166
I ain't gonna die here today!

164
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:36,750
I hope you're watchin'
this somehow, lady!

165
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:40,291
I ain't some pissed-off piece
of scrap metal anymore!

166
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:43,666
I went out lookin' for that
meaningful life and I found it!

167
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,541
You see?

168
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,375
Now I live to protect
those that helped me.

169
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,750
The only way I really know how.

170
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,666
They gave my life meaning.

171
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,041
And no one's gonna
take that away!

172
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,625
Impossible!

173
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:02,791
How could that weak iron break
through my defenses like that?

174
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:06,125
No. That's not iron.

175
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,000
He must've absorbed
the carbon in the water.

176
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,833
He turned my curse against me.

177
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,875
Gajeel's a lot smarter
than he lets on.

178
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,291
That was brilliant.

179
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,375
He used it to make steel!

180
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:21,416
[yelling]

181
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,666
[GAJEEL]
Steel Dragon Sword!

182
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:32,416
[screaming]

183
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,958
[GAJEEL chuckles]

184
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:21,250
Okay. Well, Salamander,
you owe me a song.

185
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Everyone's still down, and
there's one more demon to go.

186
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:09,875
Ah, man!

187
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,083
You may've just
defeated a Demon Gate,

188
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,500
but it's cost you
your magic power.

189
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,375
You fought well human. Now die!

190
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,541
I must say I'm surprised.
You should be dead.

191
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,333
Or still in agony.

192
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,166
He left some sort of mist.

193
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,416
[FRIED] Bixlow! Ever!
You have to resist!

194
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,500
[LAXUS]
No one else is gonna die here.

195
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,250
Not while I'm around!

196
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,250
[FRIED]
Laxus, shield your mouth!

197
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,958
[FRIED]
What're you doing?!

198
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,875
Nobody has ever taken in
that many Bane Particles

199
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,375
and survived.

200
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,875
Last one up. Déjà vu.

201
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:25,916
No matter.

202
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,166
Defeating you in
your weakened state

203
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,125
should prove to be an easy task.

204
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,083
Come on.

205
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,333
Whoosh!

206
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,875
It's completely up to me again.

207
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,333
Do something!

208
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:43,250
[yelling]

209
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:57,875
I don't understand this.
Did you neutralize the poison?

210
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,375
I'm running solely
on vengeance.

211
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,041
Whoosh!

212
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,208
[gasps]

213
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,666
You hurt my friends.

214
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,958
And nobody has ever
done that and survived!

215
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,000
This is for Fairy Tail!

216
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,875
[TEMPESTER]
He's just as powerful as before,

217
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,458
but more fierce.

218
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,625
Bring it on.

219
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,583
Yes. It'll be my pleasure.

220
00:16:58,666 --> 00:16:59,875
Vwum.

221
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,250
[TEMPESTER]
Ka-bam.

222
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,333
[TEMPESTER]
Vwu-wum.

223
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,875
[yelling]

224
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,208
[yelling]

225
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:28,708
Whoosh!

226
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,625
[yelling]

227
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,083
[yelling]

228
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,541
[TEMPESTER] What is this?
Why won't he attack?

229
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,333
[TEMPESTER]
Could it be?

230
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,250
But how?

231
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,458
No way!

232
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,708
You're not even human are you?

233
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,875
Wait. What's he talkin' about?

234
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,291
You didn't recover.

235
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,250
Your body is teeming
with Bane Particles

236
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,125
and you're still able to stand?

237
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:40,208
Your organs should
be liquefied by now.

238
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,416
That's why you're
just standing there

239
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,041
and not launching any
attacks, isn't it?

240
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:58,125
I guess my secret's out huh?

241
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,958
That means I'd better
end this, quickly.

242
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:03,458
This is the end, you fool.

243
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,000
Kerfwoosh!

244
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,791
Laxus, no!

245
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:12,875
[LAXUS]
Heh.

246
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,333
Can you even call
this stuff fire?

247
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:23,958
It's not hot enough to burn.
Is this the best you can do?

248
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,541
[LAXUS yelling]

249
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,750
You're sick.

250
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,541
The poison is coursing
through your veins,

251
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,625
so why do you still fight?

252
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,666
Because nothing's gonna
stop me from getting revenge

253
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,041
for what you did to Fairy Tail!

254
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,916
Holy crap.

255
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,541
[coughs]

256
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:56,875
[GAJEEL]
You okay?

257
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,833
[GAJEEL]
He must've taken a hit.

258
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,166
Now stay down.

259
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,375
[TEMPESTER]
You're quite remarkable.

260
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,708
[TEMPESTER] A normal human
would be dead by now,

261
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,041
or praying for the end
to take away their pain.

262
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,708
But clearly you're
no normal human.

263
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:40,125
However, your entire
species is pitifully weak.

264
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,791
I'm a life form far above yours.

265
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,333
Etherious.

266
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,833
You were foolish to believe
you could defeat me.

267
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:58,166
For I am Tempester the Immortal.

268
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,625
[TEMPESTER yelling]

269
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:02,916
I missed?

270
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:15,125
[LAXUS]
Lightning Dragon Jaw!

271
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,458
You may've bested
me once human,

272
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,458
but I swear it will
not happen again.

273
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,625
Ya know, I feel exactly
the same way about it.

274
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,333
[coughing]

275
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:49,833
[BIXLOW coughing]

276
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:01,125
[TEMPESTER]
That means I'll see you soon.

277
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,666
In the netherworld.

278
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,583
[LAXUS] This is the second
time you've brought harm

279
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,125
to my family.

280
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:28,458
[LAXUS yelling]

281
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,250
And it's the last time.

282
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:36,291
Because you're not gonna
make it outta here alive.

283
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,833
[LUCY] Even as the Bane
Particles eat away at him,

284
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,500
Laxus faces his foe,

285
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:19,416
powered solely by the spirit
of vengeance for his friends.

286
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,541
But Tempester is known
as "The Immortal."

287
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:22,916
Could this really be true?

288
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,833
Our Lightning Dragon
Slayer is definitely

289
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:26,291
gonna test that theory.

290
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:29,041
Meanwhile, as Erza locates
the demolished control room,

291
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:31,958
she also finds another life
or death battle with Kyoka.

292
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:34,416
The showdown with the Demon
Gates enters its final phase,

293
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,125
with humanity on the line.

294
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:39,208
Next Time: "Tartaros
Chapter Final Duels."

295
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:41,625
This is the
beginning of the end.
