00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,583
SINCE WE FINISHED OUR
JOB EARLY FOR ONCE,

47
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,958
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE STOP BY
A SPA AND TAKE IT EASY?

FAMOUS FOR ITS SPAS,
THIS FLAMBOYANT,

54
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,041
IF SOMEWHAT DODGY
TOURIST ATTRACTION,

55
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:38,083
WAS DESIGNED BY A DUKE WHO WAS
FASCINATED WITH THE ORIENT

56
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,083
AND ITS ARCHITECTURE.

57
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:45,291

WHY IS LOKE SO AFRAID OF ME?

58

- YOU'RE BATHING IN YOUR ARMOR?

61
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,000

KINDA WEIRD?

IT DOES.

64
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,625
I MAY NEED TO RECONSIDER
MY DEFINITION OF "RELAXATION".

65
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:07,708
- YEAH. I DON'T THINK "TAKING IT
EASY" IS YOUR STRONG POINT.

66
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:11,208
WOW. YOU LOOK JUST AS AWESOME
WITHOUT YOUR ARMOR!

67

- WHATEVER, ERZA!
YOU'RE GOIN' DOWN!

81
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,500

YOU'RE IN FOR IT NOW!

83
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:54,708

YOU KNOW, ON SECOND THOUGHT,
I THINK I'LL PASS.

89
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,916
DON'T REALLY FEEL LIKE
DYIN' TONIGHT.

90
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,416

ITS WIDE SELECTION OF
EXQUISITE DISHES

153
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,666
IS THE TRUE DRAW FOR
LOCALS AND TOURISTS ALIKE.

154
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,750
- YOU KNOW...

155
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,791
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SIT SO FAR AWAY.

156
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,458
- OH, RIGHT. SORRY.

157
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,083
- I'VE BEEN MEANING TO ASK
YOU THIS FOR A WHILE.

158
00:09:56,166 --> 00:10:00,333
IS IT TRUE THAT YOU HAVE A BAD
HISTORY WITH CELESTIAL WIZARDS?

159
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,083
IF YOU DON'T WANNA
TALK TO ME ABOUT IT,

160
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,791
THEN I CAN RESPECT THAT.

161
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,833
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR
FOR YOU TO JUDGE ME

162
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,708
JUST 'CAUSE I AM ONE.

163
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,291
- YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

164
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:22,416
SORRY. HONESTLY, I WASN'T TRYING
TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

165
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,458
I'M NO GOOD FOR YOU,
SO JUST FORGET ABOUT ME.

166
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,791
- UH, WHY'RE YOU GIVIN' ME
SOME LAME BREAKUP LINE?

167
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,166
- THAT CAME OUT FUNNY,
DIDN'T IT?

168
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,958
I DIDN'T MEAN IT THAT WAY.

169
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,041
- YOU WEREN'T SERIOUS, WERE YOU?

170
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,583
- NO, I-- UH,

171
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,416
JUST THINKIN' ABOUT SOMETHIN'
THAT HAPPENED A WHILE BACK.

172
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,791
- CAN YOU TELL ME?

173
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,000
- ( snoring )

174
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,875
- ( sighs ) WELL, WHATEVER.

175
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,000
I FIGURED
IT COULDN'T HURT TO ASK.

176
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,083
THANKS AGAIN FOR SAVING ME
BACK THERE.

177
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:08,666
I FINALLY SEE WHY YOU'RE SO
POPULAR WITH THE LADIES.

178
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,958
THIS WAS NICE.

179
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,500
THINGS WERE STARTIN' TO GET
A LITTLE AWKWARD,

180
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:14,541
SO IT FELT GOOD TO JUST
SIT DOWN AND TALK TO YOU.

181
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,458
ANYWAY, I'D BETTER GET GOING.

182
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,750
- WAIT.

183
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,416
- UH, YEAH?

184
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,333
- LUCY.
- WHAT IS IT?

185
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,291
- THE TRUTH IS,

186
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,750
I DON'T HAVE LONG TO LIVE.

187
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,500
- YOU WHAT?

188
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,875
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

189
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,125
- ( laughs )

190
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,333
I SURE FOOLED YOU!

191
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:14,583
IT MAKES FOR A PRETTY GOOD
PICKUP LINE THOUGH, DOESN'T IT?

192
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,000
PULLS AT THE HEARTSTRINGS
EVERY TIME.

193
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,416
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN YOUR FACE.
HA! CLASSIC!

194
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,458
- ( slaps )

195
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,250
- YOU JERK.

196
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,875
GEEZ. I TOTALLY BELIEVED YOU!

197
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,041
HAPPY, PLUE, WE'RE LEAVING!

198
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:49,000
- WHAT AM I DOING?
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

199
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,625
I CAN'T LET MY FEELINGS
GET THE BEST OF ME.

200
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:55,083
AND I CAN'T DRAG LUCY INTO THIS.

201
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,833
IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME.

202
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,875
- WHAT'S WITH THE TWO OF THEM?

203
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,333
- EVIDENTLY THEY BOTH WERE
HURT DURING A PILLOW FIGHT

204
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,666
AFTER THEIR LAST JOB.
- IF THEY'RE THAT BANGED UP

205
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,708
THEN THOSE PILLOWS MUST'VE BEEN
FULL OF BRICKS.

206
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,208
- POOR GRAY.
I HOPE HE'S NOT IN PAIN.

207
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,666
- IT WAS JUST A PILLOW FIGHT.

208
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,375
WHAT WERE YOU GETTIN'
SO WORKED UP ABOUT?

209
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,541
- 'COURSE I GIVE EVERYTHING
ONE-HUNDRED PERCENT!

210
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,625
- OH, LIKE WHEN YOU
ONE-HUNDRED PERCENT LOST?

211
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,666
- I WAS AWESOME!
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO LOST!

212
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,125
- MY PRINCE IS ALWAYS THE WINNER
IN MY HEART.

213
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:28,750
- LUCY! I WON
THE PILLOW FIGHT, RIGHT?

214
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,916
- PUT A SOCK IN IT.

215
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,625
- WE'RE SORRY!
WE'LL BE QUIET NOW!

216
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,375
- WOW, I THOUGHT ERZA
WAS THE ONLY ONE

217
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,125
WHO COULD KEEP THOSE
TWO IN CHECK.

218
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,291
- SHE'S A REAL MAN.

219
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
- WHAT'S WRONG?

220
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,166
YOU SEEM LIKE
YOU'RE IN A BAD MOOD.

221
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,958
- DEAL WITH IT.
I'M ALWAYS LIKE THIS.

222
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,250
- YOU STILL MAD AT ME
ABOUT THAT PLUE THING?

223
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,083
- YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDIN' ME.

224
00:13:55,166 --> 00:14:00,125
YOU THINK I'M PETTY ENOUGH TO
GET HUNG UP ON SOME PRANK?

225
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,916
LOOK, I'M SORRY.

226
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,875
I JUST HAVE A LOT ON MY MIND
RIGHT NOW.

227
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,625
- HEY, YOU CAN ALWAYS
TALK TO ME!

228
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,291
- I'LL PASS.
THANKS ANYWAY, THOUGH.

229
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,541
- THIS IS MY FAULT.

230
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,458
MY TIME'S ALMOST UP.

231
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:22,583
- I'VE BEEN LOOKIN' ALL OVER
FOR LOKE! WHERE IS HE?

232
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,166
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE RAN OUT ON ME!

233
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,708
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, HUH?

234
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,500
- I COULD ASK YOU
THE SAME THING!

235
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,916
- LOKE, COME BACK!
- WHAT'S GOIN' ON OVER THERE?

236
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,750
- THEY'RE A BUNCH OF GIRLS
FROM AROUND TOWN.

237
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:33,916
FROM THE LOOKS OF THINGS,

238
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,791
THEY ALL THINK THEY'RE
LOKE'S GIRLFRIEND.

239
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,166
- LAST NIGHT, HE SAID HE WANTED
TO BREAK UP WITH ME!

240
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,500
- AND HE BROKE UP WITH ME, TOO!

241
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,541
- AND ME!
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

242
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,750
- WHY DOESN'T HE WANT ME
ANYMORE? HUH? WHY?

243
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,000
- WELL-- UH.

244
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,208
IS HE GETTING MARRIED
TO SOME OTHER GIRL?

245
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,500
- UH, NO.

246
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,500
WHO IS SHE? IS IT SOMEONE
FROM THE GUILD?

247
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,541
LUCY! SAVE ME!

248
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,208
- SO, IS THIS THE GIRL?

249
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,833
- WELL, SHE DRESSES
LIKE A TRAMP.

250
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,000
- SHE THINKS SHE'S CUTE.

251
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,166
- DON'T TELL ME
LOKE'S GONNA MARRY HER!

252
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,041
- ( screams ) WHY'D YA
HAVE TO GO

253
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,250
AND DRAG ME INTO
THIS MESS, MIRA?

254
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,666
- SO.

255
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,583
- Narrator: THIS IS MAGNOLIA'S
ONE AND ONLY PUBLIC BATHHOUSE.

256
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,750
IN ADDITION TO
RELIEVING FATIGUE,

257
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:19,125
IT ALSO RESTORES THE MAGIC
ENERGY OF ALL WHO BATHE THERE.

258
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:22,666
- BATHHOUSES ARE MANLY!

259
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,000
- I LIKE MY BATH AT HOME,
BUT THIS PLACE TAKES THE CAKE!

260
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,708
NOTHIN' BEATS SOAKING
IN A BIG TUB!

261
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,125
LOKE?

262
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,541
- TRY THIS.

263
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,583
IT REALLY HITS THE SPOT
AFTER A BATH.

264
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,375
- OH, FLAVORED MILK? THANK YOU!

265
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:46,041
- THOUGHT I MIGHT HAVE ONE
WITH YA, IF YA DON'T MIND.

266
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,750
- JUST SO YOU KNOW, I HAD
A ROUGH DAY TODAY

267
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,791
THANKS TO YOU AND YOUR
STUPID FAN CLUB.

268
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:53,083
- LET'S PUT THAT BEHIND US.
HERE'S TO YOUR BEAUTIFUL EYES.

269
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,750
CHEERS!

270
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,208
- GOOD STUFF!

271
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,500
- NO KIDDIN'!

272
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:07,750
- THE SKY SURE IS PRETTY, HUH?
- YEAH.

273
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,250
- A SHOOTING STAR!

274
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,708
IT SOUNDS SILLY,

275
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,750
BUT I ALWAYS WONDERED WHERE
THOSE FALLEN STARS END UP.

276
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,875
- I KINDA FEEL SORRY FOR THEM.

277
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,208
JUST THINK, ONCE THEY
FALL FROM THE SKY,

278
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,916
THEY CAN NEVER RETURN TO HEAVEN.

279
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,166
DOESN'T THAT SEEM SAD?

280
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,791
- THAT'S ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR
SAPPY PICK-UP LINES, ISN'T IT?

281
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:34,916
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU
ALMOST FOOLED ME TWICE!

282
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,458
- SAW RIGHT THROUGH ME.

283
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,583
C'MON. CAN'T YOU GO
LIKE FIVE MINUTES

284
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,833
WITHOUT TRYING TO
PICK UP A GIRL?

285
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,583
- I KNOW I CAN BE A REAL PAIN,

286
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:46,666
BUT I'M GLAD WE GOT
TO TALK AGAIN.

287
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,375
GOODBYE.

288
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,500
- OPEN GATE OF
THE SOUTHERN CROSS!

289
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,125
CRUX!

290
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,458
- WOW. SO THIS WEIRD
FLOATY GUY'S A SPIRIT, HUH?

291
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:14,583
- THAT'S RIGHT! I LIKE TO
CALL HIM "GRANDPA CRUX".

292
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,916
I NEED YOU TO LOOK UP SOMETHING
FOR ME, PLEASE.

293
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,875
COULD YOU USE YOUR POWER TO FIND
OUT WHICH CELESTIAL WIZARDS

294
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,750
LOKE'S MET IN THE PAST?

295
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,125
- I DON'T THINK
HE HEARD YOU, LUCY!

296
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,833
- NAH, HE HEARD ME.
HE'S JUST DOING A SEARCH.

297
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,208
- WELL, HOW COME HE'S SNORING
LIKE THAT?

298
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:43,041
GRANDPA CRUX IS AN EXPERT
ON CELESTIAL WIZARDRY.

299
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,125
HE CAN TELL YOU ANYTHING
YOU WANNA KNOW ABOUT

300
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,291
THE DIFFERENT GATES THAT CONNECT

301
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,041
THE SPIRIT WORLD
TO THE HUMAN WORLD.

302
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,291
HE CAN EVEN TELL YOU ABOUT
PARTICULAR SPIRITS,

303
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,958
AND WHICH WIZARDS HAVE SUMMONED
THEM IN THE PAST.

304
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,625
SO DID YOU FIND ANY INFO?

305
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,708
INDEED. BUT REGRETTABLY,

306
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,000
I CANNOT PROVIDE ANY
EXTENSIVE DETAILS

307
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:05,750
AS PERSONAL PRIVACY LAWS DO
APPLY TO THE CELESTIAL WORLD.

308
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,791
HOWEVER, I CAN TELL YOU THAT
LOKE WAS ONCE CONNECTED TO

309
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:12,000
A CELESTIAL WIZARD
NAMED KAREN LILICA.

310
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,708
- KAREN LILICA?

311
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,041
- YOU KNOW HER? WHO IS SHE?

312
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,416
- SHE WAS SUPER FAMOUS
A FEW YEARS BACK.

313
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,583
I ACTUALLY HAD THE ISSUE FROM
WHEN SHE WAS PROFILED

314
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,125
IN SORCERER WEEKLY.

315
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,875
BUT, SHE DIED ON A JOB.

316
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,125
THEY SAY HER MASTER TOLD HER
NOT TO TAKE IT.

317
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,375
- SO SHE WAS A GUILD WIZARD
JUST LIKE US, HUH?

318
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,791
- MM-HMM.

319
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:35,500
SHE WAS A MEMBER OF BLUE PEGASUS
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY.

320
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,500
GRANDPA CRUX, WHAT WAS
THE RELATIONSHIP

321
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,416
BETWEEN KAREN AND LOKE?

322
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,416
- SORRY, BUT I'M AFRAID I'VE
SAID ALL I CAN ON THE MATTER.

323
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,708
- AW, C'MON!

324
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,916
- HEY, IT LOOKS LIKE HE DECIDED
TO GO AHEAD AND SEARCH FOR YA!

325
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,541
- NO, HE'S ASLEEP THIS TIME.

326
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,666
SO KAREN AND LOKE.

327
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,958
- THE TRUTH IS
I DON'T HAVE LONG TO LIVE.

328
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,583
- HOLD ON.

329
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:03,708
- ONCE THEY FALL FROM THE SKY,
THEY CAN NEVER RETURN TO HEAVEN.

330
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,500
DOESN'T THAT SEEM SAD?

331
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,375
- FALLEN STAR? HE CAN'T BE.

332
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,791
- UH. IS SOMETHIN' WRONG?

333
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,250
- I GOT BAD NEWS, LUCY!

334
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:18,000
IT'S LOKE! HE QUIT FAIRY TAIL
AND THEN RAN AWAY!

335
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,583
- DID HE SAY WHY?

336
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,041
- NO, WE DON'T HAVE A CLUE!

337
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,708
EVERYONE'S OUT
LOOKING FOR HIM NOW.

338
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:26,166
HE'S BEEN ACTING WEIRD LATELY
BUT NOBODY EXPECTED THIS!

339
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,208
- MAYBE I'M RIGHT.

340
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,583
- Natsu: HEY, WHERE YA GOIN'?

341
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,166
LUCY! DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING
WE DON'T?

342
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,833
- HEY! LOKE!

343
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,333
- WHERE ARE YOU?
- COME ON OUT!

344
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,083
- LOKE!

345
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:42,000
- IS HE HIDIN' IN HERE?
- I'M GUESSIN' NO.

346
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:45,333
- LOKE!
- WHERE ARE YA, MAN?

347
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,500
- THERE YOU ARE!

348
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,208
- LUCY.

349
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:20,000
- THE WHOLE GUILD'S
LOOKING FOR YOU.

350
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:23,250
THAT'S KAREN'S GRAVE, ISN'T IT?

351
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,500
SHE WAS A GREAT CELESTIAL WIZARD

352
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:30,125
AND SHE HAD A CONTRACT
WITH YOU, RIGHT?

353
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,041
THE SPIRIT LOKE.

354
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:35,916
WAIT, THAT'S NOT REALLY
YOUR NAME.

355
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:40,208
YOUR NAME IS LEO.

356
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,166
LEO THE LION.

357
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,666
- WELL, I WON'T DENY IT,
BUT HOW DID YOU FIND OUT?

358
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,083
- DON'T FORGET,
I'M A CELESTIAL WIZARD, TOO,

359
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,958
AND I HAVE CONTRACTS
WITH A LOT OF SPIRITS.

360
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,625
IT WASN'T TOO HARD
TO DIG UP THE TRUTH.

361
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,083
STILL,

362
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:07,041
YOU SHOULD'VE COME TO
TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS!

363
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,416
NORMALLY, WHENEVER THE OWNER
OF A GATE KEY DIES,

364
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,666
THE CONTRACT BETWEEN SPIRIT
AND WIZARD IS TERMINATED.

365
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,791
THE SPIRIT IS THEN FORCED BACK
INTO THEIR WORLD,

366
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:18,750
UNTIL THE KEY FALLS INTO NEW
HANDS AND A CONTRACT IS MADE.

367
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,041
YOUR CONTRACT
WITH KAREN

368
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,333
SHOULD'VE ENDED ON
THE DAY SHE DIED.

369
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,666
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE STILL HERE.

370
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,250
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF
THAT BEFORE. I MEAN,

371
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:30,333
THAT'S JUST NOT THE WAY
IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK, RIGHT?

372
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:33,541
I KNOW YOUR KIND CAN'T SURVIVE
IN THE HUMAN WORLD FOR LONG.

373
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,166
JUST LIKE HUMANS CAN'T
SURVIVE IN YOUR WORLD.

374
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,208
IT'LL SLOWLY SAP AWAY
YOUR LIFE TILL, FINALLY,

375
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:40,666
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT.

376
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,125
- THAT'S RIGHT, AND IT'S BEEN
THREE YEARS NOW.

377
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:48,583
- THREE YEARS? I DIDN'T EVEN
THINK ONE WAS POSSIBLE!

378
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,333
- PRETTY AMAZING, HUH?

379
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,500
BUT I DON'T HAVE THE STRENGTH
TO KEEP IT UP.

380
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:55,583
- HOLD ON! THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOME WAY THAT I CAN SAVE YOU!

381
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,791
WHY CAN'T I JUST OPEN A GATE
FOR YOU?

382
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:00,750
TELL ME WHY YOU CAN'T GO BACK
TO THE SPIRIT WORLD!

383
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,583
- YOU DON'T NEED TO SAVE ME.

384
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,416
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
IF YOU DON'T GET SOME HELP SOON,

385
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,958
YOU'RE AS GOOD AS DEAD!

386
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,125
- LOOK, THERE'S NO WAY
I CAN GO BACK.

387
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,041
- BUT WHY?

388
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,500
- I BROKE A FUNDAMENTAL LAW

389
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,708
THAT APPLIES TO BOTH
WIZARD AND SPIRIT.

390
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,250
AND AS A RESULT,

391
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:19,750
I WAS BANISHED FROM THE
CELESTIAL WORLD FOR ETERNITY.

392
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:22,916
- LOKE. JUST WHAT DID YOU DO?

393
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,583
- I CAN'T DENY MY CRIME

394
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:29,291
SO I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO FACE
THE PUNISHMENT.

395
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:33,791
I AM A TRAITOR TO MY OWN KIND.
I WAS CONTRACTED TO KAREN.

396
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,166
BUT SHE DIED,

397
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,833
BECAUSE I KILLED HER.

398
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:44,791
- ( closing theme song playing )

399
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,833
- SOMETIMES I WONDER WHAT
THE CELESTIAL WORLD IS LIKE.

400
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:18,500
- OH, YEAH? I THOUGH YOU ALREADY
KNEW WHAT IT WAS LIKE!

401
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,375
DIDN'T YOU SEE IT BACK AT
DUKE EVERLUE'S PLACE

402
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,125
WHEN YOU HITCHED
A RIDE ON VIRGO?

403
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,791
- NAH, THAT ONLY
LASTED A SECOND.

404
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:25,625
I COULD BARELY SEE ANYTHING.

405
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:28,083
BUT NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,
I DO REMEMBER SOMETHING.

406
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,500
- OH! WHAT? TELL ME!
- A MUSTACHE.

407
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:33,375
- Natsu and Happy: NEXT TIME:
CELESTIAL SPIRIT KING!

408
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:35,291
- Happy: MUSTACHE?
WHAT ARE YA TALKIN' ABOUT?

409
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:37,500
- WELL, YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO
TUNE IN NEXT TIME

410
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:38,875
IF YOU WANNA FIND OUT!

411
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:41,041
- NOW THAT'S A PREVIEW LINE!
