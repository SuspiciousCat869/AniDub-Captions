you're gonna go down!

159
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,416
[MAVIS] That Sabertooth
worries me.

160
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,791
I hate to say it.

161
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,166
But I'm not sure that we'll
be able to beat them.

162
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,750
[ROMEO] Yeah, it sucks to admit,

163
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,541
but they're awesome.

164
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,041
[CHAPATI] Day one's
matches are about to come

165
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,375
to a close, but we still
have one more battle!

166
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,333
[YAJIMA] Fairy Tail B
and Lamia Scale must be

167
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,583
competing since they're the

168
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,250
only teams we haven't seen yet.

169
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,375
[JENNY] These two guilds
used to be equally-skilled

170
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,208
so this should be
an interesting fight.

171
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:11,166
I can't wait to see which
team comes out on top!

172
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,250
[CHAPATI] Okay folks,
are you ready?

173
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,541
The final match of the
first day is going to be.

174
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:24,500
Fairy Tail B's Mystogan versus
Lamia Scale's Jura Nekis!

175
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,416
[crowd erupts in cheers]

176
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,458
[MALE SPECTATOR 160G]
I can't wait!

177
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,500
[BOY SPECTATOR 160A]
Way to go, Jura!

178
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,750
[MALE SPECTATOR 160H] Hooray!

179
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,125
He's the only reason I
came to watch the games!

180
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,458
[FEMALE SPECTATOR 160A]
I never would've expected

181
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,833
him to fight on
the very first day!

182
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,875
[ERZA THINKS] Jellal,
right off the bat?

183
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,458
And he's fighting against
Jura, of all people!

184
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,166
[CHAPATI] Mystogan is such
a mysterious wizard that

185
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,916
only a select few in Fairy Tail
have ever seen his face!

186
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,375
[FEMALE SPECTATOR 160B]
You gotta be kiddin' me!

187
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,875
[FEMALE SPECTATOR 160C]
That's ridiculous!

188
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,125
[SHELIA] Good luck
out there, Jura!

189
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,708
[YUKA] This match
is as good as ours.

190
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,958
[TOBY] It ain't even
started yet, Yuka!

191
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:00,958
[YUKA] Chill out, man.

192
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,541
There's no need
to get ticked off.

193
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,500
[crowd cheers]

194
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:06,666
[BOY SPECTATOR 160B]
Look! It's Jura!

195
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,666
[MALE SPECTATOR 160I]
He's the coolest!

196
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,541
[MALE SPECTATOR 160J] Oh wow!

197
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,791
It's really him!

198
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,083
[MALE SPECTATOR 160K]
This is gonna be great!

199
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:14,208
Wow, I had no idea that
Jura guy was so popular!

200
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,708
Yeah, of course he is.

201
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,250
I mean, he is one of the
Ten Wizard Saints, after all.

202
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,875
He's basically as strong
as Master Makarov.

203
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,958
[LAXUS] I guess luck
isn't on your side today.

204
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,208
Who'd have thought you'd
be forced to fight Jura?

205
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:27,875
He's just a big,
bald priest.

206
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,541
Is he really that tough?

207
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,500
I'm not even sure
that Erza and I

208
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,916
could beat him in
a two-on-one battle.

209
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,625
[JELLAL] Don't worry.
You can count on me.

210
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,208
[JURA] Personally, I would
love to see Fairy Tail do

211
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,416
well in this competition,
but I'm afraid the old

212
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,625
hag would throw a fit
if I were to let you win.

213
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:25,000
My sincere apologies
but I won't be holding back.

214
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,833
[JELLAL] Nor will I.

215
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:29,833
[JELLAL] It was
never my goal to

216
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,166
enter into the arena
as a competitor.

217
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,375
But nothing makes me
happier than being given

218
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:38,041
the chance to fight for
my friends in Fairy Tail.

219
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,583
There's no need to
look so glum, First Master.

220
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:50,875
He'll be just fine.

221
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,083
You know, he once held

222
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,000
the very same title
as Iron Rock Jura.

223
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,833
So I think it's fair to say
that they're evenly matched.

224
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,333
[MAKAROV] Something wrong?

225
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,833
Sorry.

226
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,000
I was listening but I really
need to go to the restroom.

227
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,583
[ALL] For real?
But you're a ghost!

228
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,333
[ERZA THINKS] Jellal.

229
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,625
I hope you're
going to be all right.

230
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:21,708
What?

231
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,625
Jellal is fighting in
the next match?

232
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,833
Ya think he'll
be found out?

233
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,541
No, he's too smart
to let that happen.

234
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,333
That is, unless he
tries to show off

235
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,791
for Erza, then he
could ruin everything.

236
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,916
[CHAPATI] Fairy Tail B's
man of mystery going

237
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,666
head to head with
Lamia Scale's iron rock!

238
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,250
[CHAPATI] So let's get
this final match underway.

239
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,833
Right now!

240
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,625
[JELLAL] I might not
get another chance

241
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,916
to help Fairy Tail in the games.

242
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:53,666
[JELLAL] I've got to make the
most of it, and defeat Jura!

243
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,750
Whoa, that was
totally awesome!

244
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,583
[JELLAL]
Five-Layer Magic Circle.

245
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,375
Sacred Song!

246
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,541
That's nuts.

247
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,125
I can't believe he's
copying Mystogan's magic.

248
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,625
Very impressive.

249
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,000
Oh no, Jura!

250
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,958
Don't you
worry about him...

251
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,875
I don't mean to belittle
Juvia's team, but I happen to

252
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:51,708
think that Jura is the
greatest wizard in all of Fiore.

253
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,875
[JELLAL]
Three-Layer Magic Circle.

254
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,375
Mirror Water!

255
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,041
He deflected it!

256
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,416
Hell yeah, he did!

257
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,750
It's headed back to him!

258
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,833
[CHAPATI]
It's obvious why Jura's

259
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,291
one of the Ten Wizard Saints!

260
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,916
Because he rocks!

261
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,375
Yes, that's
the spirit, Jura!

262
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,750
Now hurry and finish him off!

263
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,166
Don't make me spin you!

264
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,916
[LAMIA SCALE WIZARD 160A]
Hey, cut it out, old hag!

265
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,500
[JELLAL] I should've
known I wouldn't be

266
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,708
able to beat him using
someone else's magic.

267
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,041
[JELLAL] Meteor!

268
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,375
But that's...!

269
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,333
No way!

270
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,291
[JURA] Iron Rock Wall!

271
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,125
There you are!

272
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,041
[JELLAL] Perfect timing.

273
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,291
There are magic
circles in the sky!

274
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,833
But how'd
they get there?

275
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,541
He must've drawn them
while dodging Jura's attacks!

276
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:30,041
[JELLAL] May the seven stars
bring judgment upon you!

277
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,708
Grand Chariot!

278
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,416
Rock Tor!

279
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,500
[JURA THINKS]
Just as I suspected.

280
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,125
I know exactly who you are now.

281
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,333
Unfortunately, it seems
my candid advice

282
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:08,416
to Fairy Tail's master
fell on deaf ears.

283
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,250
[JURA] By the way,
Sir Makarov, the Wizard

284
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,916
Saints will be holding
a meeting very soon.

285
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,083
You should come.

286
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,708
You need to be
debriefed and there's

287
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,916
a matter of importance
to discuss.

288
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,541
[JURA THINKS] I've been wary
of you and your guild

289
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,125
for some time Jellal,
but I never expected you to

290
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,916
assume the role of
a Fairy Tail wizard.

291
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,750
[JURA] Perhaps I should
have acted on my intuition.

292
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:36,458
[JELLAL] I have to win this
match, for Fairy Tail's sake.

293
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,000
[JELLAL] Forgive me, Ultear.

294
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,041
but I'm going to use it now!

295
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,333
Just what do you
think you're doing, Jellal?

296
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,625
This is bad!

297
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:49,000
If he uses that spell,
he's gonna blow his cover!

298
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,875
[JELLAL] True Heavenly
Body Magic: Sema!

299
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,875
What has he done?

300
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,875
[ULTEAR] How could
he be so stupid?

301
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,625
You see, that's the
problem with men!

302
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,375
They can't control
their ridiculous egos!

303
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,958
[MELDY] What are
we gonna do now?

304
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,916
[Ultear chuckles]

305
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,083
[JELLAL] The inside of my mouth!

306
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,041
[JELLAL] It's on fire!

307
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,583
Here ya go, why don't you
have some more hot peppers?

308
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:50,500
Eat!

309
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:51,666
Eat!

310
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,750
[MELDY] No, it hurts!
They're too spicy!

311
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,416
Don't be a wuss!
C'mon, down the hatch!

312
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,125
[CHAPATI] I don't know what
happened, ladies and gentlemen,

313
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,916
but all of a sudden Mystogan
is writhing in agony!

314
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,458
Now let's see how
you like this, Jellal!

315
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,166
[MELDY] Please stop tickling me!

316
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,958
I can't take it!

317
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:15,833
[Jellal laughs]

318
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,666
[CHAPATI] If there's a joke
here, I am not in on it!

319
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,625
[ULTEAR] Oh, it's not over yet.

320
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,291
[ULTEAR] How do you like this?

321
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,291
[ULTEAR] And what about that?

322
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:32,625
[MELDY] Cut it out!

323
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,791
I can't take it anymore!

324
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,916
[CHAPATI]
Down in a fit of laughter!

325
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,875
[CHAPATI] I dunno
what was so funny,

326
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:01,291
but it put Mystogan
outta commission!

327
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,833
Sorry about that.
But we couldn't afford to let

328
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,083
Jellal attract too
much attention.

329
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:13,083
[CHAPATI] Jura Nekis gets
the last laugh and the win!

330
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,583
You done good!

331
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,958
You sure about
that, old hag?

332
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,500
Well folks,
that's a wrap for

333
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,625
day one of the
Grand Magic Games!

334
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,041
Let's see how the teams are
sizing up on the scoreboard!

335
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,416
[JET] What?

336
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,958
Team A has zero points
and Team B only has one?

337
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,750
This is a disaster.

338
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,791
Didn't I tell you
guys that we never

339
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,958
should've entered
in the first place?

340
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,000
It's been an exciting
day, hasn't it?

341
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,416
The talent level this
year is off the charts.

342
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,583
As we expected, the Sabertooth
guild is in first place...

343
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,291
...while the two Fairy Tail
teams are in dead last.

344
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,708
Yes but remember
it's only the first day.

345
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,000
Here's hoping
that we'll see some

346
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,291
dramatic comebacks
in the days ahead.

347
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:02,041
[JENNY] Yeah, Blue Pegasus
still has a chance to win!

348
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,625
I can't wait to see what's
in store for day two!

349
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:05,958
[CHAPATI] I'd like to thank you

350
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,958
for joining me today,
Mr. Yajima and Ms. Jenny!

351
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,208
[YAJIMA] It was my pleasure.

352
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,166
[JENNY] I had fun!

353
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,750
See you tomorrow!

What a loser!

[MALE SPECTATOR]
Is he, like, Fairy Tail's

357

jester or somethin'?

That was hilarious!

359
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,833
Oh, good grief.

360
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,958
I don't understand; what
the heck happened to him?

361
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,250
I assume it was
Meldy's doing.

362
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,041
Way to make our team

00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,416
look like a bunch of idiots!

[MIRAJANE] You tried your best.

[LAXUS] Man, you're pathetic.

[JELLAL] I'm sorry
that I let you guys down.

Oh, hey Lucy!

368

[ERZA] Feeling better?

Much better, thanks.
