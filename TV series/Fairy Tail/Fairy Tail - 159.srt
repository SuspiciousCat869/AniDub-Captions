[MAVIS] It's still only day
one of the Grand Magic

Games and so far,

7
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,125
the competition has
been less than inspiring.

8
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:12,458
[MAVIS]
Fairy Tail's Team B is in

9
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,416
seventh place with
one measly point.

10
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,583
[MAVIS] And Team A?
They did even worse!

11
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:18,791
Dead last!

12
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,125
I guess none
of us thought the guy

13
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,541
with the fancy hat was
gonna be all that strong.

14
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,666
Don't forget, it was a
member of Raven Tail who

15
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,166
kept Gray from going
all out in the fight.

16
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,541
That and Juvia's
over-zealous devotion.

Listen to my cat friend
as he explains the rules!

21
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,708
A victory in the
battle portion is

22
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,958
worth ten points,
but a loss is worth no points.

23
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,833
In the case of a draw,
both teams get five points.

24
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:45,916
That means, if we win,

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,500
we can still nab
one of the top spots!

26

[MAVIS] That's right!
So don't count us out just yet!

[MALE SUBORDINATE 159A]
Perhaps the battle-portion

will prove more entertaining.

on stopping Gray than winning.

With all due respect,
it's obvious

00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,250
Aw man, what a waste.

161
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,208
[FLARE THINKS]
I don't believe it.

162
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,000
My beloved, scorching red hair.

163
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,916
It barely even hurt her?

164
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,583
Damn you, Blondie!

165
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,458
Man, Lucy's tearin'
it up out there.

166
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,958
She's pretty awesome now!

167
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,375
Yeah!
It's amazing!

168
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,416
I'm very impressed.

169
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,250
[HIBIKI] You'd never
think she spent the

170
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,833
last seven years in
stasis on Tenrou Island.

171
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,458
But, from where I'm standing,

172
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,958
she might as well
be a different person...

173
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:14,500
I watched her fight Angel
during the Nirvana incident.

174
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,291
The power she
had then is nothing

175
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,166
compared to what she has now.

176
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,791
Yeah, tell me about it.

177
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,500
And after that she went through
that whole ordeal with Zentopia

178
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,375
which probably made her
even stronger in the end.

179
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,708
That's true.

180
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,791
And the red-headed
chick isn't lacking in skill.

181
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,875
This fight's just
getting started.

182
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,708
Hey. What gives?

183
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,875
Are you trying to
go for my feet again?

184
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,666
She's too exposed now.

185
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,416
Without shoes to protect her.

186
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,708
Flare's attacks will be far more
effective at slowing her down.

187
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,083
Be careful out there, Lucy!

188
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:52,958
[LUCY THINKS] Crap.

189
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,791
I can't sense its
movement at all this time!

190
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,250
Where's it gonna pop up?

191
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,000
[CROWD]
Fight! Fight! Fight!

192
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,708
What is she doing?

193
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,166
No Asca, look out!

194
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,708
Ah, come on!
You could've dodged that!

195
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:39,875
You've gotta move quickly!

196
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:40,875
As if you're dancing!

197
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,291
Maybe her legs
took more damage

198
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,333
than we thought
and we just can't tell.

199
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,375
[FLARE] Be quiet.

200
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,125
if you want the girl to live.

201
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,416
Try calling out to
your friends up there.

202
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,875
And I'll break her neck.

203
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,708
So be a good
little bimbo and take

204
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,291
your punishment with a smile.

205
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,375
[LUCY THINKS]
What a dirty trick!

206
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,583
[MALE SUBORDINATE 159A] Oh, Sir.

207
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,416
I didn't realize you
were watching from here.

208
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,625
[ARCADIOS] It's bearing fruit.

209
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:12,958
[MALE SUBORDINATE 159A]
Excuse me?

210
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,500
[ARCADIOS] With any luck,
it will be ripe soon.

211
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:19,041
Wouldn't it be nice if we could
move ahead of schedule?

212
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,375
[ARCADIOS] Are
you watching, Zeref?

213
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,458
It won't be long now.

214
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,000
D'you see something, Master?

215
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,166
I sense something.

216
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,666
An odd magical presence
I've never felt before.

217
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,541
[BISCA] It's probably just gas.

218
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:36,500
Or old age.

219
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,708
Shuddap!

220
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,000
[ASCA] You're a stinky old man!

221
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,916
[FLARE] No one notices.

222
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,916
No one's going to notice.

223
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,125
If I wanted I could end the

224
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,333
baby fairy's life
before anyone realized.

225
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,833
[LUCY THINKS]
This girl's insane!

226
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,166
[CHAPATI] I just can't take
my eyes off of this battle!

227
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,583
Lucy Heartfilia
and Flare Corona are

228
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,750
two stunning and
ferocious competitors!

229
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,833
Seeing Fairy Tail
in action must bring back

230
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:11,000
memories of your Magic
Council days, Mr. Yajima.

231
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,833
They had quite the reputation
back then, didn't they?

232
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,666
Yeah,
that's an understatement.

233
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,000
To be honest,
they were a pain in the butt.

234
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,083
But beyond that,
they were highly skilled

235
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,625
and the community
practically worshipped them.

236
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,833
[CHAPATI] Yes, I'm
sure that comes as a

237
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:28,625
surprise to a lot
of the people watching!

238
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,500
[MAKAROV] Aw yeah!
Beat her up!

239
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,583
We're countin' on ya, Lucy!

240
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,791
[Flare crazily laughs]

241
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,250
[LUCY THINKS] This chick's
seriously demented.

242
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,250
[FLARE] Mouth, shut.
Body, still.

243
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,083
And keep your magic to yourself.

244
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,541
Disobey me in any way,

245
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,666
and I'll snuff the little
one out like a candle.

246
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,875
[FLARE] Ready, Blondie?

247
00:12:58,958 --> 00:12:59,750
Oh no!

248
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:00,958
Perhaps the strain of summoning

249
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,166
two spirits at once
was too much for her.

250
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,333
Did she run out of magic?

251
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,166
Whaddaya mean?
She's not runnin'!

252
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,833
No one said
she was, you flea bag!

253
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,666
[Flare screams out
and laughs crazily]

254
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,625
Why isn't
she fighting back?

255
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,958
I don't get it; she
was on a roll just a second ago!

256
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,791
Why isn't she
calling on her spirits?

257
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,083
I can't watch this.

258
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,500
She's getting creamed out there!

259
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,041
You can get through this, Lucy!

260
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,958
[NAB] Is she conserving
her magic power?

261
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,416
She better crack the
lid on it soon, or else.

262
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,208
[MALE SPECTATOR 159A]
What happened?

263
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:46,916
[MALE SPECTATOR 159B]
Did she forget how

264
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,416
to fight or somethin'?

265
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,916
[MALE SPECTATOR 159C] Come
on, goldie-locks, step it up!

266
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,083
And just like that, the fight
has switched gears!

267
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,333
I'm not sure what happened,
but Lucy Heartfilia is now

268
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,833
on the receiving end
of a brutal beat-down!

269
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,000
You can do it, Lulu!

270
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,125
[FLARE] Feel the burn!
How's that!

271
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,833
You like it?

272
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:23,041
[LUCY] Everyone.
Wendy. Gray.

273
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,958
[LUCY] Please forgive me.

274
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,791
[LUCY] Okay.
That's enough.

275
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,458
I surrend--

276
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,333
What happened?

277
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,958
Maybe she's so hungry
she can't fight properly!

278
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,708
Great thinking,
that's gotta be it.

279
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,750
I'm pretty sure
that I said 'no talking';

280
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,541
Did you forget the rules?

281
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,791
[FLARE] How dare you defy me?

282
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,708
[FLARE] You can't surrender
during the warm-up!

283
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,916
Not when I have
so many delectably

284
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,416
painful things to try.

285
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,583
Now be a dear and take your

286
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,916
punishment like
a big girl, okay?

287
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,500
No talking, but you
are allowed to scream and cry!

288
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:09,458
[FLARE] Now, let's see.
What should I have you do first?

289
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,833
Peeling those clothes off in
front of everyone might be fun.

290
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,875
Would you like to put on a show?

291
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,750
[FLARE] Then again,
I'm feeling artistic today,

292
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,791
and your body would
be the perfect canvas.

293
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,875
[FLARE] I think I'll brand it
with the Raven Tail emblem.

294
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,000
Would you like that?
Think of it as a

295
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:31,541
souvenir that you'll
have the rest of your life.

296
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,750
[FLARE] Where would
you like me to put it?

297
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,041
Hmm?

298
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,416
[FLARE] Oh!
I know!

299
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,791
You want it on top of your
Fairy Tail emblem, don't you?

300
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:46,125
[LUCY] No, please don't!
Put it anywhere but there!

301
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,083
[FLARE] I told you to be quiet!

302
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,083
[LUCY] No!
Stop!

303
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,500
I'm begging you!

304
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,416
My Man-Sense is telling
me that something is not right.

305
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,250
Where did Natsu go?

306
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,000
[ELFMAN] He was
here a second ago.

307
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,541
[NATSU] My ears don't lie to me.

308
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,791
[NATSU] I heard
her loud and clear!

309
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,666
She was tryin'
to protect Asca!

310
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,708
[HAPPY] Way to go!

311
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,000
[MAKAROV] Does anyone
else smell burning hair?

312
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,666
You're in the clear,
Lucy!

313
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,083
[LUCY] Thanks, Natsu!

314
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:27,958
[LUCY] Gemini!

315
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,416
[GEMI AND MINI] Piri Piri!

316
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,083
[LUCY] We're doing the big one!

317
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,625
[GEMI] But we
haven't practiced enough!

318
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,333
[MINI] We're not
sure we can do it.

319
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:44,000
[LUCY] Don't worry,
just transform into me!

320
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,083
[GEMI] You got it!

321
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,541
[MINI] Piri Piri!

322
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,291
[LUCY] Why are you
dressed like that?

323
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,833
[LUCY (GEMINI)]
It's not our fault.

324
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:57,041
This is the outfit you had on
the last time we copied you.

325
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,083
[LUCY] Oh, right.

326
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,041
That was after
my bath yesterday.

327
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,083
[LUCY (GEMINI)]
I'll get changed.

328
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,083
[LUCY] Not here, you won't!

329
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,166
I will kill that bimbo!

330
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,666
I don't understand.

331
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,708
Why doesn't she just
have 'em turn into Erza?

332
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:10,958
Or someone even stronger?

333
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,333
Doesn't work that way.

334
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,000
They can only copy
people with magic

335
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,291
power that's less
or equal to Lucy's.

336
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,666
Oh, I see.

337
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,291
So they couldn't copy Master
Makarov or Master Mavis?

338
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,208
Maybe not.

339
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,833
But I bet they could copy
Master Macao, no problem.

340
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,166
Hold on pal.

341
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,000
Are you implying that I
have less power than her?

342
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,125
I don't know what's
going on here,

343
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,666
but I like what I'm seeing!

344
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,541
Hubba!

345
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:33,791
Oh, grow up.

346
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,541
Sure, she's got curves,
but she's no Miss Fiore.

347
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,000
I want curves.

348
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,833
She must have
some kinda reason

349
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,208
for needing two of
herself on the battlefield.

350
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,458
[WARREN THINKS]
I can think of a couple.

351
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,750
[MAX] Get your telepathy
out of the gutter, dude.

352
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,583
Wow! I feel a
dance coming on!

353
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:49,625
You're always dancing!

354
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,208
What's new? How 'bout
you stop being

355
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,416
perverted and
support your teammate?

356
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,333
[CHAPATI] There are now
two Lucy Heartfilias and

357
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:59,416
not a single man in the audience
is complaining about it!

358
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,958
[YAJIMA] The Celestial
Spirits she summoned

359
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,291
must be Gemini,
the twins of the Zodiac!

360
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,666
[BOTH LUCYS] Oh stars far and
wide that embody the heavens.

361
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,250
By thy radiance,
reveal thy form.

362
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,000
I implore Tetrabiblos.

363
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,166
Eternal ruler of
the stars above.

364
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,083
It can't be.
That spell?

365
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,541
Now I see.

366
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:22,375
She's using Gemini's ability
to increase her own power.

367
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,791
Amazing.

368
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,833
She's actually mastered it.

369
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,083
The spell of the stars.

370
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,291
[LUCY] Even with two of me now,

371
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,750
this won't be nearly
as strong as last time.

372
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,250
[LUCY (GEMINI)]  I ask that you
to lend your power to me.

373
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,916
[LUCY] But it'll be
enough to show her.

374
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,208
What sort of
spell is she casting?

375
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:42,208
[BOTH] Open the raging,
tumultuous gate!

376
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,250
[LUCY] The power of Fairy Tail!

377
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,208
[LUCY] This is it!

378
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,791
I'm placing all of our guild's
pride into this one attack!

379
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:56,041
[BOTH] With all eighty-eight
heavenly bodies shining!

380
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:00,875
[FLARE] Huh?

381
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:03,083
What's with the starry sky?

382
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,208
This doesn't make any sense!

383
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,958
[BOTH] Uranometria!

384
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,125
Huh?
No "boom"?

385
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,666
Did she lose control?

386
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,958
It looks like Gemini's
gone as well.

387
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,750
[LUCY] Someone
countered the spell.

388
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,708
[FLARE] Obra!
You saved me?

389
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:02,416
[LUCY THINKS]
No way. But how?

390
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,458
The spell vanished?

391
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,333
There's something
fishy goin' on here.

392
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,500
Well.

393
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,708
I expected something
way more bombastic.

394
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,875
But her spell
was a complete dud.

395
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:13,958
Mr. Yajima.

396
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,583
Any thoughts?

397
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,458
Just forget I asked!

398
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,375
[CHAPATI] And she's down!

399
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,916
Looks like that's
it for Lucy Heartfilia!

400
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,750
You know what
that means, folks!

401
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:35,583
[CHAPATI] The winner is
Raven Tail's Flare Corona!

402
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,958
'Crazy hair' must have cheated!

403
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,541
It doesn't seem possible for her

404
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,333
to have nullified that
spell in time, does it?

405
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,750
It's clear she
had outside assistance.

406
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,666
Those guys're playin' dirty!

407
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:03,875
What's your plan? You tryin'
to start an off-field fight?

408
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,250
Are you?

409
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,500
[FLARE] I told you I'd win.

410
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,500
You never stood a
chance against me, Blondie!

411
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:15,750
[FLARE] You're pathetic! How
does it feel to be such a loser?

412
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,291
She can't even
control her own magic!

413
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,375
No wonder she lost!

414
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,791
[MALE SPECTATOR 159E]
Lame-fest!

415
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:21,958
[MALE SPECTATOR 159F]
Now Raven Tail's got eighteen

416
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,708
points and Fairy Tail's
stuck with zero.

417
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,583
Big shock there, right?

418
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,708
[JURA] Deplorable.

419

"It's not cheating if no
one catches you in the act".

420
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,916
That's how Dark guilds
choose to operate.

421
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,958
What a crappy way to lose.

422
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:40,083
She knows they cheated, so
she shouldn't beat herself up.

423
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,500
Still, they won.

424
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,750
[MATO] Thank you for
a splendid magic battle!

425

[NATSU] Hey, now.
No crying.

426

[LUCY] I can't help it.
It's just not fair!

No, it's not.

That's why we'll pay them
back a hundred times over.

You were amazing.

430

You proved that seven
year gap means nothing.

431

We still got a fightin' chance!

[NATSU] Zero points?
Sounds great to me.
