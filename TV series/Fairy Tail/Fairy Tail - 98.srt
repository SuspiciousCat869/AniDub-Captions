HOLDS THE S-CLASS WIZARD
PROMOTION TRIAL,

30
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:15,708
A HIGHLY ANTICIPATED EVENT 
FOR THE MOST ELITE MEMBERS.

31
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:18,583
IT'S BEEN ONE WEEK SINCE NATSU
AND THE OTHERS WERE CHOSEN.

32
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:19,958
WITH THEIR PARTNERS IN TOW,

33
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,708

THIS YEAR'S TRIAL

39
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,916
WASN'T IT SNOWING
THE OTHER DAY?

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,916
FEELS LIKE MY SKIN'S
GONNA MELT OFF.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,250
I'D LOVE TO TURN
INTO A POPSICLE,

42
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,958
BUT HAPPY'D JUST EAT ME.

43
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,916
- I'LL THINK I'LL PASS.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,916
- LU, I KNOW IT'S 
RIDICULOUSLY WARM,

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,791
BUT DO YOU HAVE
TO SIT LIKE THAT?

46
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,250
- YOU THINK IT'S WARM?
IT'S FREAKING BOILING HERE

47
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,750
YEAR ROUND 'CAUSE
THERE'S LIKE NEVER ANY WIND.

48
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:01,958
- ( groans )

49
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:08,041
- SO HOT.

50
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,958
- MY KINGDOM FOR
AN ICE CREAM CONE.

51
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,541
- KINGDOM?

52
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,625
- Gajeel: ALL RIGHT, WE GET IT.
IT'S A SCORCHER.

53
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,708
TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.
- JUVIA, AREN'T YOU HOT

54
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,958
WEARING THAT?
YOU'RE GONNA GET HEATSTROKE.

55
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,541
- NO, I'M PERFECTLY FINE.

56
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,541
HOWEVER, ONE THING 
THAT MIGHT DO IT...

57
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,458
IS THE SIGHT OF MY BELOVED
GRAY'S NAKED BODY!

58
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,500
- I'M DYING HERE!

59
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,333
- SO THIS IS WHAT
HELL IS LIKE.

60
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,583
YO, POINT THAT PUKE CANNON
SOMEWHERE ELSE, BRO.

61
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,333
- IT WOULDN'T BE SO BAD
IF WENDY WOULD CAST

62
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,416
THAT MIRACLE SPELL
ON ME AGAIN.

63
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,625
( hacks )

64
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:41,916
- YOU CAN'T BLAME HER THOUGH.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,291
I MEAN, SHE IS
TECHNICALLY YOUR ENEMY.

66
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,916
- SORRY, NATSU.
HANG IN THERE. 

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,375
- ( groans )

68
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,166
- WELL, ISN'T THIS TOUCHING?

69
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,583
HERE THEY ARE ABOUT TO ENGAGE
EACH OTHER IN BRUTAL COMBAT

70
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,416
AND THEY'RE BEING
ALL BUDDY-BUDDY.

71
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,041
- UGH! I'M ROASTING! 
I'M LIKE A MAN-STEAK.

72
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,083
- WOULD YOU MIND
ROASTING AWAY FROM ME?

73
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:03,041
- HEY, HAPPY.
TURN INTO A POPSICLE.

74
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,833
- I'LL JUST TASTE LIKE
DRIED FISH AND REGRET.

75
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,083
- AT THIS POINT, I'D PUT
ALMOST ANYTHING IN MY MOUTH

76
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,333
AS LONG AS IT'S COLD.

77
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,083
- WE'VE ARRIVED.

78
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,041
- OH.

79
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,083
- WHOA, IT'S WEIRD LOOKING.

80
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,250
SURE TOOK US LONG ENOUGH.

81
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,958
- THAT'S THE UGLIEST
ISLAND EVER.

82
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,916
- Elfman: YOU THINK?
LOOKS KIND OF MANLY TO ME.

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,166
- Levy: AN ISLAND
ON TOP OF AN ISLAND, HUH?

84
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,791
- Wendy: IT'S AMAZING!

85
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,708
SO MUCH MAGIC POWER.

86
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,958
I CAN FEEL IT FROM
ALL THE WAY OVER HERE.

87
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,625
Mest: MOST IMPRESSIVE.

88
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,708
- ( groans )
- DON'T WORRY.

89
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,583
WE'LL BE ON LAND SOON.

90
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:04,166
- THERE'S A LEGEND
ABOUT THIS PLACE, 

91
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,166
THAT IT WAS ONCE
POPULATED BY FAIRIES.

92
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,166
- IS THE LEGEND TRUE?

93
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,708
- NOBODY KNOWS,

94
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,833
BUT IT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE
TO OUR GUILD--

95
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,833
THE RESTING PLACE
OF OUR FIRST MASTER

96
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,541
MAVIS VERMILLION.

97
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,875
- AND YOU'RE GOING THERE
DRESSED LIKE THAT?

98
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,750
- SAID THE NUDIST
TO THE STYLISH MAN.

99
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,500
- SPEAKING OF WHICH,
MIND PUTTING SOME CLOTHES ON?

100
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,000
- ANYTHING ELSE?
I'D LIKE TO REVEAL

101
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,416
THE FIRST ROUND OF YOUR TRIAL
IF I MAY.

102
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,500
- THERE'S MORE THAN ONE ROUND?

103
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:33,208
- IF ANY OF THE MASTER'S EVENTS
WERE EVER DEEMED SIMPLE,

104
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,500
HE'D PROBABLY KEEL OVER.

105
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,291
- Makarov: PLEASE DIRECT
YOUR ATTENTION

106
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,083
TO THE SMOKE COMING
FROM THE SHORE.

107
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,416
YOUR FIRST TASK WILL
BE TO HEAD TO ITS SOURCE.

108
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,041
ONCE THERE, YOU WILL CHOOSE
ONE OF THE EIGHT ROUTES

109
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,791
LEADING INTO THE ISLAND.

110
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,541
EACH IS MEANT FOR
A SINGLE TEAM ONLY.

111
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,375
SO DON'T DAWDLE AND PICK ONE.

112
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,208
AFTER YOU'VE
MADE YOUR CHOICE,

113
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,375
YOU WILL HAVE TO CONQUER
THESE OBSTACLES.

114
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:56,708
- ( gasps )

115
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,625
- HMM.

116
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:02,708
- ( growls )

117
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,333
- TEAMS THAT MAKE IT THROUGH
THESE TESTS IN ONE PIECE

118
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,291
WILL ADVANCE
TO THE SECOND ROUND.

119
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,458
- WHOA.
- THAT LAST ONE

120
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,041
IS FIGHTING S-CLASSERS.

121
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:24,458
"INTENSE COMBAT," NO JOKE.
- YEAH, GREAT.

122
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,333
- WHAT'S THE SERENITY ROUTE?

123
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:29,041
- Makarov: COMBAT ROUTES
ARE SELF-EXPLANATORY.

124
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,666
TWO TEAMS CLASH,
BUT ONLY ONE MOVES ON.

125
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,625
USE EVERY POWER
IN YOUR DISPOSAL.

126
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,875
INTENSE COMBAT ROUTES
ARE MORE DIFFICULT.

127
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,625
FIND YOURSELF ON THESE
AND YOU'LL BE

128
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,833
FIGHTING ONE OF
FAIRY TAIL'S ELITE.

129
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,541
ON THE SERENITY ROUTE,

130
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,583
YOU'LL PASS THE FIRST ROUND
WITHOUT FIGHTING,

131
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,166
BUT YOU WILL
STILL BE TESTED.

132
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,916
PASSING THIS CHALLENGE
REQUIRES QUALITY TEAM WORK

133
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,333
AND A WHOLE LOT OF LUCK.

134
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,833
- HOW DO YOU TEST THAT?

135
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,916
- LET'S COUNT ON 
GOOD LUCK, RIGHT?

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,291
- EVEN AS A GAMBLER,
I THINK THAT STRATEGY BLOWS.

137
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,125
WITH ONE-AND-EIGHT ODDS.
BE READY TO BRAWL.

138
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,875
- IF I'VE DONE
THE MATH CORRECTLY,

139
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,916
ONLY A MAXIMUM OF SIX TEAMS
WILL MAKE IT TO THE NEXT ROUND.

140
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,458
- THIS SUCKS!

141
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,500
IF WE PICK THE ROUTES
WITH THE S-CLASSERS,

142
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,208
WE'RE GONNA GET
A MANLY POUNDING.

143
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,083
- YOU'RE NO REAL MAN.
YOU'RE A REAL WIMP.

144
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,000
- THE FIRST ROUND
COULD BE THE END OF US.

145
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,375
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO FIGHT
A BUNCH OF MY FRIENDS.

146
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,333
- SOUNDS GREAT TO ME.

147
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:23,166
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR AN EXCUSE
TO PUNCH ONE OF THESE FOOLS.

148
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,583
- YEAH, I KNOW.

149
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,583
- ALL RIGHT, YOU READY?

150
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,916
YOUR TRIAL STARTS RIGHT NOW.

151
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,833
- WHAT?
- HOLD UP.

152
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,125
IT STARTS BEFORE
WE GET ON THE ISLAND?

153
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,875
- ( snickers )

154
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,458
- YOU KNOW WHAT 
THAT MEANS, BUD.

155
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:39,250
TIME TO JET.
- HMM.

156
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,375
- LOOKS LIKE THE FIRST PICK
IS OURS, LOSERS.

157
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,000
- CATCH YA LATER.

158
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:46,250
- HEY, GET BACK HERE.
- LOSERS! YOU WANT TO DIE?

159
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,500
- ( groans )

160
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:49,791
- AN ENCHANTMENT.

161
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,458
- IT ISN'T PERMANENT.

162
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,875
FIVE MORE MINUTES ON THAT BOAT
WON'T KILL YOU.

163
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,083
- SPEAK FOR YOURSELF!
- THAT'S CHEATING.

164
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,000
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU DON'T

165
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,708
JUST KEEP THEM
TRAPPED THERE ALL DAY.

166
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,458
- IT WOULDN'T BE
MUCH OF A TRIAL THEN.

167
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,250
- GRAMPS, DO SOMETHING.

168
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,416
THAT'S GOT TO BE
AGAINST THE RULES.

169
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,833
- CHILL, IT'S NOT A RACE,
SO JUST WAIT.

170
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,750
- IF HE GETS TO THE ISLAND
FIRST, WE'RE ALL SCREWED.

171
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,875
HE COULD COVER THE WHOLE
PLACE WITH ENCHANTMENTS.

172
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:18,125
- OH, GOD DANG IT!
THIS IS SO NOT FAIR!

173
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,250
- WAIT A SEC,
COULDN'T LEVY GET US OUT?

174
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,000
- HM-HMM.
THIS'LL BE A PIECE OF CAKE.

175
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,500
- Both: NICE.

176
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,875
- SORRY.

177
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,375
I ONLY REWROTE IT 
FOR ME AND GAJEEL.

178
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:30,041
- NOT COOL.

179
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,291
- I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS.

180
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,083
- NOT TODAY, LULU.

181
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,625
LATER, TATERS.
SEE YOU ON THE ISLAND.

182
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,583
- WHAT A BUNCH OF TRAITORS!

183
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,041
- NOW, AREN'T YOU GLAD
YOU TEAMED UP

184
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,333
WITH SOMEONE WHO KNOWS
FRIED SO WELL, MUSCLE MAN.

185
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,625
- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU COULD DO THAT?

186
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:44,958
- REWRITING SOMETHING

187
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,708
AS SIMPLE AS THIS
IS CHILD'S PLAY.

188
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,250
SOMEONE WITH MY TALENTS
COULD HANDLE

189
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,875
THE TOUGHEST ENCHANTMENTS
WITH EASE.

190
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,583
LET'S GO.

191
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,375
- MANLY DIVE!

192
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,791
- AH, COME ON.

193
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,125
- HOW MUCH LONGER 
ARE WE STUCK HERE?

194
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,416
- ANOTHER FOUR MINUTES AT LEAST.

195
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,708
- WHOA, REMIND ME
TO HAVE LEVY AROUND

196
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,083
THE NEXT TIME
I PISS OFF FRIED.

197
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,666
- Narrator: FIVE MINUTES LATER.

198
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,125
- All: FINALLY!

199
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,333
- ONCE YOU HIT THE WATER,

200
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,791
GO ALL OUT.
- OKAY.

201
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,458
- GUESS WE'RE
PLAYING CATCH UP.

202
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,458
- THINK YOU CAN PLAY
WITH SOME PANTS ON? 

203
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,666
- LET'S DO THIS.
- AYE, SIR.

204
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,500
- TIME FOR A LITTLE--
ICE MAKE: FLOOR!

205
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,000
- WHOA! WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY
TO GET ACROSS.

206
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,541
- I'M VERY FAST AT SEA.

207
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,041
ARE YOU SURE THAT
YOU CAN KEEP UP? 

208
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,250
- OF COURSE.

209
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,166
- NEVER THOUGHT 
I'D ENVY A FISH.

210
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,333
- WHAT ARE WE GAWKING FOR?
IF WE DON'T GET A MOVE ON,

211
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,958
WE'RE GONNA BE
THE LAST ONES THERE.

212
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,416
- DON'T BE SILLY.
WENDY AND MEST

213
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,791
HAVEN'T EVEN LEFT
THE SHIP YET.

214
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,666
- WHAT THE?
- WHEN DID THEY LEAVE?

215
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,291
- HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW?

216
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,208
- IF WE DON'T
GET THERE ASAP,

217
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,125
WE'RE GONNA END UP
FIGHTING ERZA OR WORSE.

218
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,208
- WE'RE DEAD.

219
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,000
- DO YOU FEEL THAT, NATSU?

220
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,708
THERE'S SO MUCH
MAGIC ENERGY HERE,

221
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,125
IT'S KIND OF
FREAKING ME OUT.

222
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,208
- YEAH.

223
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,166
OKAY, LET'S GO!

224
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,208
- Narrator: ONCE A ROUTE
HAS BEEN CHOSEN,

225
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,500
A MAGIC BARRIER
SEALS IT OFF.

226
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,500
AFTER THAT, THE ONLY WAY
TO MAKE IT OUT,

227
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,250
IS TO WIN THE CHALLENGE.

228
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,583
- Natsu: MAN, WE'RE WAY BEHIND.

229
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,000
- HALF OF THE ROUTES
HAVE ALREADY BEEN TAKEN.

230
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,666
WELL, WHICH ONE
SHOULD WE PICK?

231
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,958
YOU CHOOSE.
- HMM.

232
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,458
THAT ONE!

233
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,833
IF WE TAKE ROUTE "E,"

234
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,541
I BET WE'LL HAVE TO FIGHT ERZA.

235
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,000
- THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT 
THE PATH I WOULD CHOOSE.

236
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,791
- I FINALLY GET TO FIGHT HER
<i>MANO A MANO.</i>

237
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,625
I'M COMING FOR YOU, ERZA.
- UGH.

238
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,041
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO

239
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,833
IF SHE'S NOT ON THIS PATH?

240
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,000
- Narrator: ROUTE "E"
IS SEALED.

241
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,500
- LOOKS LIKE WE'RE DEAD LAST.

242
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,458
I CAN'T BELIEVE EVEN
WENDY AND MEST

243
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,666
GOT HERE BEFORE
WE DID.

244
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,250
- HEY, DON'T SWEAT IT.

245
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,000
LIKE THEY SAY, THE BEST
IS ALWAYS SAVED FOR LAST.

246
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,875
THAT'S US.  WE'VE GOT
GOOD LOOKS AND GOOD LUCK.

247
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:21,083
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GET YOU
THAT S-CLASS RANK?

248
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,958
- HMM, NICE TO KNOW
ONE OF US CAN STAY CHIPPER.

249
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,583
- I DIDN'T EXPECT A CAVE
TO BE SO WELL LIT.

250
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,333
- PROBABLY ALL
THE SPIRIT FLIES.

251
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,083
SINCE THE ISLAND
STAYS WARM ALL YEAR,

252
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,333
THEY MULTIPLY LIKE RABBITS.

253
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,041
- Man: UGH! I WAS JUST
STARTING TO RELAX.

254
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,458
- WHO'S THERE?

255
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,041
IF SOMEONE ELSE IS HERE,
THAT MEANS...

256
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,833
OUR LUCK SUCKS!

257
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,750
- LOOK, BABIES, IT'S CANA
AND THE LOUDMOUTH BLONDE.

258
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,541
- THE NAME'S LUCY, JERK!
- SORRY, IT APPEARS THAT

259
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,333
YOU WON'T BE MAKING
IT PAST THIS ROUND.

260
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,000
- Narrator:
FRIED AND BIXLOW

261
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,416
ARE MEMBERS OF THE INFAMOUS
THUNDER LEGION.

262
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,125
DURING THE BATTLE
OF FAIRY TAIL,

263
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:05,916
LUCY AND CANA FACED OFF
AGAINST THESE POWERFUL WIZARDS

264
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,416
IN BRUTAL ONE-ON-ONE COMBAT.

265
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,500
HOWEVER...

266
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,875
- OKAY, LUCY,
ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN,

267
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,916
HOW SCREWED ARE WE?
- 11, GIVE OR TAKE 100.

268
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,375
- Narrator: CANA WAS UTTERLY
HELPLESS AGAINST FRIED'S POWER.

269
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,000
AND IF LOKE
HADN'T INTERVENED,

270
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,750
LUCY WOULD HAVE FALLEN
TO BIXLOW AND HIS BABIES.

271
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,958
- Narrator: THE FIRST ROUND
OF THE S-CLASS

272
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,916
WIZARD-PROMOTION TRIAL
IS WELL UNDERWAY

273
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,500
ON TENROU ISLAND.

274
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,291
AFTER ARRIVING AT
THE STARTING POINT DEAD LAST,

275
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,666
LUCY AND CANA WERE LEFT
WITH NO CHOICE

276
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,708
BUT TO TAKE THE ONLY
REMAINING ROUTE.

277
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:49,166
UNFORTUNATELY FOR THEM,
IT TURNED OUT TO BE

278
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,583
ONE OF THE COMBAT ROUTES.

279
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,500
AND NOW THEY MUST BATTLE
AGAINST TWO MEMBERS

280
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,041
OF THE THUNDER LEGION
FRIED AND BIXLOW.

281
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,875
- THE GATE OPENS
WHEN ONE TEAM WINS.

282
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,166
AND I'M SURE IT AIN'T
GONNA BE YOU TWO BIMBOS.

283
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,958
- BIMBOS! BIMBOS!

284
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,166
- FORGIVE ME, CANA.
I CAN'T ALLOW YOU

285
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,125
TO PASS THIS ROUND.
NOT NOW.

286
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,416
IF I'M TO FOLLOW
LAXUS'S PATH,

287
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,750
I MUST WIN HERE.

288
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,666
- BRING IT ON!

289
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,250
I SWEAR, I AM NOT GONNA
LET THE S-CLASS

290
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,625
SLIP THROUGH MY FINGERS
A FIFTH TIME.

291
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,958
IT'S ALL OR NOTHING FOR ME.

292
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,125
- ( snickers )

293
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,750
- BEFORE WE BEGIN,

294
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,250
WOULD YOU LADIES MIND
COVERING UP A LITTLE?

295
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,083
- COME ON, MAN,
IT'S BETTER THIS WAY.

296
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,208
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
- Tommen: BOUNCY, BOUNCY.

297
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,375
- ( screams )
- IT'S DISTRACTING.

298
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:35,583
NOW PLEASE COVER UP.

299
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,333
- OH, A LITTLE SHY, ARE WE?

300
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,250
THAT'LL MAKE THIS
SUPER EASY.

301
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,666
- WHAT SORT OF
VULGAR SORCERY IS THIS?

302
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,875
SUMMONING BIKINI BABES?!

303
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,666
- DO YOU HAVE IDEA HOW MANY
MEN WOULD KILL FOR THAT POWER?

304
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,916
- ( whimpers )

305
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,541
- WHOA, THAT WORKED?
- HECK YEAH!

306
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,125
I WISH I'D KNOWN
ABOUT THIS WEAKNESS

307
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,208
THE LAST TIME WE FOUGHT.

308
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,583
- DREAM ON.

309
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,166
IT AIN'T GONNA WORK ON ME.

310
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,541
- YOU'RE UP, LU.
- RIGHT.

311
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,458
NOW OPEN GATE

VIRGO!

313
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,166
- FAN-SERVICE VERSION
FOR YOUR VIEWING PLEASURE.

314
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,041
- WHAT? DO YOU JUST HAVE
WOMEN TUCKED AWAY SOMEWHERE?

315
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,666
- I SHOULD SHOW MY APPRECIATION
FOR THE EYE CANDY.

316
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,000
SAY THANKS, BABIES.
- WEE!

317
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,125
- ALLOW ME
TO TEACH YOU MY TENETS.

318
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,000
"V:" VERY CLEAN BATHROOMS

319
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,750
ARE A STAPLE
OF ANY GOOD HOME.

320
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:26,166
"I.R:" IRREPLACEABLE OBJECTS
SHOULD BE HANDLED WITH CARE.

321
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,916
"G.O:" GOING TO THE STORE
IS THE DUTY OF EVERY MAID.

322
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,083
OW.  YEOW.

323
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,333
THAT HURT.

324
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,166
- COME ON!
- WHY WOULD YOU SUMMON

325
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,000
YOUR MAID RIGHT NOW?
- I DON'T KNOW,

326
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,250
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO KEEP WITH THE SHTICK!

327
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,583
( screams )

328
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,208
- I LIKE IT WHEN 
YOU DANCE FOR ME.

329
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,833
OH, YEAH.  I COULD
WATCH THIS ALL DAY LONG.

330
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,583
- GO AWAY!

331
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,166
- YOU PIG!

332
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,625
- Bixlow: THAT'S STRIKE TWO.

333
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:54,958
GET 'EM, BABIES!

334
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,458
- ( screams )

335
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:57,791
OPEN GATE OF THE RAM!
- ( doorbell rings ) 

336
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,416
- UM, WHAT WOULD
YOU LIKE ME TO DO?

337
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,000
- AAH! ANYTHING!
I DON'T CARE.

338
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,000
- ANYTHING? OKAY.

339
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,125
WOOL BOMB!

340
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,875
- ( chattering )

341
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,375
- FIRST BIKINI BABES

342
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,583
AND NOW A WEIRD RAM CHICK

343
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:12,666
THAT SHOOTS COTTON CANDY?!

344
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,666
- I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.

345
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,958
- SO MUCH INDECENCY.

346
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,208
- GO WOOL WALL!

347
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:21,000
- WHAT IS THIS
STRANGE SENSATION?

348
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,625
MY BODY FEELS 
WOOLY AND WARM

349
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,666
AS IF I'M BEING HUGGED
BY A FLUFFY CLOUD.

350
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,208
- LOOK, MAN, WE ALL GOT TO GO
THROUGH PUBERTY SOME TIME,

351
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,416
BUT COULD YOU HOLD OFF
UNTIL WE BEAT THESE BIMBOS?

352
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,291
- BIMBOS! BIMBOS!

353
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,208
- LUCY...

354
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,750
KICK!
- ( groans )

355
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,208
UGH!

356
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,958
- OH, YEAH!
MY STRATEGY WORKED.

357
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,416
I REMEMBERED HE'S REALLY WEAK
WITHOUT HIS BABIES.

358
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,625
THESE BIMBOS REALLY
KICKED YOUR BUTT, PAL.

359
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,416
- IF IT'S OKAY, MISS LUCY,
I'D REALLY LIKE TO GO HOME NOW.

360
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,208
I'LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME.

361
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,875
- "LUCY KICK"?

362
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,583
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU 
TO COME UP WITH THAT ONE?

363
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:59,416
- STOP THIS! I'M SERIOUSLY
ABOUT TO REACH MY LIMIT.

364
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,875
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME!
THE SPELL ALREADY WORE OFF?

365
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,875
- HOW UTTERLY DEGRADING.

366
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,208
BUT NOW THAT I'M FREE,
YOU WON'T TRAP ME AGAIN.

367
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,708
LET'S GO.
- ( Lucy squeaks )

368
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,833
I THINK YOU MADE HIM MAD.
- DARK ECRITURE...

369
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,375
WINGS!

370
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,791
- CANA! - IT'S GONNA
TAKE MORE THAN A LITTLE SCRAPE

371
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:23,875
TO BRING ME DOWN.

372
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,083
HERE GOES NOTHING.

373
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,041
PRAYERS FOUNTAIN!

374
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,416
- IT'S NO USE.

375
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,458
- NOT AGAIN.
- WATER, HUH?

376
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,166
- NO, THAT WON'T
WORK WITH THIS. 

377
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,166
IT'S VOLATILE MAGIC 
MEANT FOR ATTACKING.

378
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,791
IF YOU TOUCH IT,
IT COULD KILL YOU.

379
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,250
- YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA.

380
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,541
OPEN GATE OF THE WATER BEARER!
- ( doorbell rings )

381
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:48,958
- AQUARIUS!

382
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,041
- ANOTHER BIKINI BABE?!

383
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,291
- HE'S DISTRACTED. 
TAKE HIM OUT QUICK.

384
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,666
- ( scoffs )

385
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,916
- ( both scream )

386
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,375
- THAT HURT.

387
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,666
YOU GOT SPONGE FOR BRAINS?

388
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,416
LOOK, HE'S THE ENEMY!

389
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,000
- EVERY TIME I SEE YOU,
YOU'RE WEARING LESS AND LESS.

390
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:06,000
HA! LITTLE LUCY THINKS
SHE CAN SEDUCE A MAN, HUH?

391
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,791
GOOD LUCK WITH
THAT SCRAWNY BOD!

392
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,333
- YOU LOOKING TO GET
BATTERED AND DEEP FRIED?!

393
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,791
- I'M STAYING OUT OF THIS.

394
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,208
- CAN YOU NOT TELL
THE DIFFERENCE

395
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,666
BETWEEN FRIENDS
AND ENEMIES?!

396
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,250
- EVERY WOMAN ALIVE
IS MY ENEMY, IDIOT.

397
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,916
YOU THINK YOU'RE HOT STUFF
JUST BECAUSE

398
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,291
YOU LET YOUR JUBBLIES
OUT TO JIGGLE.

399
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:26,375
WOW, I DIDN'T KNOW GIRLS
WERE SO DESPERATE THESE DAYS.

400
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,791
POOR THING.

401
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,708
YOU'LL NEVER
LAND A MAN THAT WAY.

402
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:32,083
- I BET YOU SETTLED ON
THE FIRST UGLY MERMAN 

403
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,583
THAT SHOWED YOU HIS TRIDENT.
IT MUST BE ROUGH

404
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:37,125
WHEN YOU'RE 20,000 LEAGUES
OF PURE SKANK.

405
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:40,000
- RUMMY WENCH.
- FISHY SEA BEAST.

406
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,250
- MAYBE I SHOULD TRY
TO SEPARATE THEM.

407
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,875
NO, I'LL JUST STAY HERE.

408
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,666
- I'D LOVE TO CHAT MORE,

409
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,083
BUT I HAVE TO MEET
MY BOYFRIEND.

410
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,708
- WOULD YOU QUIT
BRAGGING ABOUT IT?!

411
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,833
UGH! WHY DO I 
EVEN USE HER?!

412
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,000
- NOT THAT THIS HASN'T
BEEN AMUSING,

413
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,541
BUT IF YOU'RE DONE...
- FORGOT ABOUT HIM.

414
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,916
- I'M ALL OUT OF IDEAS.

415
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,958
- FINE.  I'LL JUST
USE THIS AGAIN.

416
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,708
- THIS IS FRIED
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

417
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,416
HE WON'T FALL FOR
THE SAME TRICK TWICE.

418
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,625
- NOT THIS AGAIN!

419
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,500
- ARE YOU FRICKIN'
KIDDING ME?!

420
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,250
- PLEASE, I CAN'T
FIGHT LIKE THIS. 

421
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,875
DON'T YOU WANT TO WIN
FAIR AND SQUARE?

422
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,666
- I GOT YOUR "FAIR" RIGHT HERE.

423
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,833
HA!

424
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,916
- Girls: OOH!

425
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,291
AHH.

426
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,791
PLEASE COME
SNUGGLE WITH US, FRIED.

427
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,083
- YOU'RE DESPICABLE!

428
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,708
I WON'T LET YOU BEAT ME!

429
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:29,375
- AWW, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE SO MEAN, DARLING.

430
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,958
WE'LL DO ANYTHING 
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY.

431
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:35,000
- IT MAY BE OUR ONLY STRATEGY,
BUT IT'S CREEPY.

432
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,791
- I'M GOING ALL OUT.

433
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,250
THIS SHOULD
FINISH YOU OFF!

434
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,791
- WHY WON'T YOU COME
AND PLAY WITH US?

435
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,833
THERE'S NO NEED TO BE SHY.

436
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,791
WE'RE JUST LOOKING
TO HAVE SOME FUN. 

437
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,166
WE'RE READY TO SERVE
YOUR EVERY DESIRE,

438
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,333
MASTER FRIED.

439
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,291
- ( gasping )

440
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,166
- YOU'RE SUCH A CUTIE-PIE.

441
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,291
CAN'T YOU SEE WE'RE
MADLY IN LOVE WITH YOU.

442
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,291
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

443
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:01,041
- MADE A CAGE
OUT OF BIKINI BABES?

444
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,000
- HA! THAT WAS TOO EASY.

445
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:06,500
- PLEASE BE GENTLE WITH US.
- ( panting )

446
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,750
- GUESS THAT'S ONE WAY
TO DO IT. - HONESTLY,

447
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,666
I DON'T KNOW WHY
WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT THEM.

448
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,375
WHAT IS IT NOW?
- IT'S GREAT

449
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,875
THAT WE HAVE
HIM TRAPPED AND ALL,

450
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,750
BUT WE GOT TO BEAT HIM
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

451
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,083
UH, CAN YOU MAKE
THE GIRLS TACKLE HIM

452
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,000
SO HE GETS CRUSHED
OR SOMETHING?

453
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,333
- ( chattering )
- THERE MUST BE A WAY

454
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,041
TO BREAK FREE.  THINK!

455
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,041
HER CAGE HAS A WEAK SPOT.

456
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,875
- HE FELL FOR IT.
- FOOLED YOU!

457
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,416
- OH, DEAR.

458
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,333
- SUMMON LIGHTNING.

459
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,791
- ( screams )

460
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,708
- WHOA, WE BEAT HIM.
- HEY, LOOK.

461
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,041
THE GATE LEADING
TO THE NEXT ROUTE IS OPEN.

462
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,041
- YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?

463
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,875
- THAT WE ROCK.

464
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,041
- S-CLASS RANK,
HERE I COME.

465
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,916
LET'S GO!
- YEAH.

466
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,125
- ( groans )

467
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,875
YOU SURE THIS WAS
FOR THE BEST?

468
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,500
YOU LOST S-CLASS.

469
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,791
- I'M SURE.

470
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,250
IF IT'D BEEN ANYONE ELSE,

471
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,125
I WOULD'VE GIVEN 
THE FIGHT MY ALL.

472
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:26,125
BUT I FEEL I OWE THOSE TWO
A DEBT OF SORTS.

473
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,541
AND GIVING THEM THIS VICTORY

474
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,375
SEEMED LIKE A FAIR WAY
TO PAY IT OFF.

475
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,750
- WHATEVER.

476
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,583
WE PUT ON A KILLER SHOW,
BUT TO BE HONEST,

477
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:35,000
I THINK YOU GOT
THE BETTER END OF THE DEAL.

478
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,125
- PERHAPS.
- I AM SURPRISED.

479
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,541
I MEAN, WEREN'T YOU
DEAD SET

480
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,625
ON FOLLOWING
IN LAXUS'S FOOTSTEPS?

481
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:44,250
- I'D LIKE TO, BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO ME. 

482
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,333
- BEING IN FAIRY TAIL
IS ALL THAT MATTERS. 

483
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:54,250
BESIDES, I HAVE NO DOUBT
LAXUS WILL RETURN ONE DAY.

484
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,208
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
THOSE GIRLS HIT THE JACKPOT.

485
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,250
WHAT'RE THE ODDS
THAT THEY'D RUN INTO US?

486
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,208
I GUESS THEY'RE
PRETTY LUCKY AFTER ALL.

487
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:08,791
- Narrator: MEANWHILE
ON ROUTE "E..."

488
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,916
- HEY, ERZA!

489
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,833
QUIT HIDING
AND FIGHT ME!

490
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,916
I'D LIKE TO KICK
YOUR BUTT TODAY!

491
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,166
- NATSU, WE DON'T EVEN KNOW 
IF THIS IS HER ROUTE OR NOT.

492
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,583
YOU NEED TO REMEMBER THAT.

493
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,041
- NO, I CHOSE "E" FOR ERZA,

494
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,541
SO IT'S GOT
TO BE HER PATH!

495
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,333
I'M GONNA CLAIM
THE TITLE OF S-CLASS WIZARD!

496
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,625
AND I'LL HAVE 
A BALL KICKING

497
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,541
ERZA'S TEETH IN
WHILE I DO IT. 

498
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,375
- CHECK IT OUT.
THE PATH AHEAD OPENED UP.

499
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,166
- HE HE HE.

500
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,291
I THINK I SEE SOMEBODY.
- IS IT ERZA?

501
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,208
- ( both gasp )

502
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,750
- ( gasps )

503
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,333
NO FREAKING WAY!

504
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,458
- SORRY, DEAD END.

505
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,666
LUCK JUST
AIN'T ON YOUR SIDE.

506
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,916
- WE'RE DEAD.

507
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:09,125
- I SHOULD WARN YOU.

508
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,250
I'VE NEVER BEEN GOOD
AT HOLDING BACK IN A FIGHT.

509
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:12,375
SO THIS'LL BE QUICK.

510
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,250
- NATSU?

511
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,041
- ( chuckles )

512
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:29,625
OH, YEAH, I'M FIRED UP NOW.

513
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:32,000
- ( theme music playing )

514
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:40,041
- ( chuckles )

515
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,083
- ( singing in Japanese )

516
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:14,583
- Happy: WELL, NATSU,
YOU HAD A GOOD RUN.

517
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,708
- Natsu: HUH? YOU MAKE IT
SOUND LIKE I'M LEAVING.

518
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,291
- I MEAN THE FIRST ROUND'S
OVER FOR YOU.

519
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,708
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

520
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,416
I HAVEN'T EVEN
THROWN A PUNCH YET.

521
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,208
- THAT'S TRUE, BUT YOU'RE
UP AGAINST GILDARTS.

522
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:25,458
I'M PRETTY SURE WE ALL KNOW
THE OUTCOME AT THIS POINT.

523
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:26,791
- OH, YEAH, WELL,
I'LL SHOW YOU.

524
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,500
I'M GONNA POUND GILDARTS
INTO THE GROUND

525
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,375
AND LAUGH WHILE I'M DOING IT.

526
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:33,166
- ( Natsu and Happy speaking )

527
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,375
- Happy: IF ANYONE GETTING
POUNDED INTO THE DIRT,

528
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:37,375
IT'S GONNA BE YOU.
- AND YOU'LL BE RIGHT THERE

529
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:38,875
WITH ME, PAL.
OR DID YOU FORGET

530
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:40,416
THAT YOU'RE MY PARTNER
IN THIS FIGHT?

531
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,583
- ( Happy whimpers )
