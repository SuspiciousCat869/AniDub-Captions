And I'm not sure that
all of us are even gonna be

165
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,000
lucky enough to do that.

166
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,750
[NATSU] Whaddaya mean?

167
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:02,000
Are you tryin' to say that this
thing's gonna kill some of us?

168
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:04,750
Come on.

169
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,708
Everyone run, now!

170
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,375
What's it doing?

171
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,958
No way.

172
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,000
[NATSU] I don't believe it.

173
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:54,000
The entire forest has
completely disappeared!

174
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,583
[ELFMAN] That's crazy.

175
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:58,541
[LEVY] How can it
be so destructive?

176
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:02,125
It wiped out those trees
with just a single roar!

177
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,041
How strong is that thing?

178
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,500
Not just strong.

179
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,833
He's evil.

180
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,750
Pure and simple.

181
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,500
That just now was
nothin' more than

182
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,666
his way of gettin' warmed up.

183
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,541
Listen up!

184
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,291
If you wanna stay alive!

185
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,583
You can't waste time
freakin' out!

186
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:23,291
Pull yourselves together
and let's get outta here.

187
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,375
Are you okay, dear?

188
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,458
Hurry!

189
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,916
Everyone get to the ship!

190
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,416
It's this way!

191
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
Just through those trees!

192
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,166
Now get moving!

193
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,625
Wendy!

194
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,583
You know how to communicate
with dragons, don't you?

195
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,458
Can you talk to it for us?

196
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,500
Anyone can communicate
with a dragon,

197
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,958
but this one didn't
come here to talk to us!

198
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,625
[PANTHERLILY] He's attacking!

199
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:06,583
No, Fried!

200
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,500
Bixlow!

201
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,583
He cut off our
escape route!

202
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,291
But, why us?

203
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,000
Why are you doing this?

204
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,625
Answer me!

205
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:23,833
[ZEREF] He refuses
to speak to them.

206
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:27,291
Which means he views them
as nothing more than insects.

207
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,791
Men don't engage
vermin in conversation.

208
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,291
This is no different.

209
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,541
And men certainly
don't battle pests the same

210
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,208
as actual threats.

211
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:43,500
Those poor souls don't
have a prayer of surviving.

212
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,500
[EVERGREEN] Elfman!

213
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,625
[ERZA] Be careful!

214
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,125
[ZEREF] Mankind
will soon learn who's

215
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,166
at the top of the food chain.

216
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,166
Ever.

217
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,416
Thank you.

218
00:11:58,666 --> 00:11:59,916
[LEVY] No.

219
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,833
We're trapped.

220
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,375
What'll we do?

221
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,125
[ZEREF] It seems.

222
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,791
I find myself at the
crossroads once again.

223
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,583
At the end
of yet another era.

224
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,583
So farewell.

225
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,333
Natsu.

226
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,083
You jerk!

227
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,958
C'mon gramps!

228
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,625
[MAKAROV] Get to the ship!

229
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,625
[GRAY] He's crazy!

230
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,083
He can't fight that thing!

231
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:43,875
Master!

232
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,416
Please don't
play the hero!

233
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,708
The guild needs
you to stay alive!

234
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,625
[MAKAROV] Get out of here!

235
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,458
I will fight
by master's side!

236
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,958
No lizard is gonna
tear this guild apart!

237
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,208
I'll stay with you
'til the bitter end!

238
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,625
Me, too!

239
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:05,416
[EVERYONE agreeing]

240
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,958
Will you brats
just shut up and honor

241
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,625
your master's final wish?

242
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,750
Get out of here now!

243
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,625
[MIRAJANE] Final wish?

244
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,833
I am a Dragon
Slayer wizard, Gramps!

245
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,375
This is what I was born to do!

246
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,416
So let me--

247
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,833
[LAXUS] Not
today, kid!

248
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:28,583
Let go.

249
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:29,791
Laxus!

250
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:37,958
Best of luck.

251
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,125
Now, run!

252
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,958
[MAKAROV] What good children.

253
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:45,333
It may be hard to believe now,
but this is for the best.

254
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,166
It's times like these that
teach you important lessons

255
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,666
for your future.

256
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,208
Like knowing that tears
are wasteful things,

257
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,083
nothing to trouble over.

258
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,041
Is death caused by sadness?

259
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,250
Or is sadness caused by death?

260
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:01,208
The answer is in your hearts.

261
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:07,125
My dear children, you
must learn and grow, and live!

262
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,333
You foul creature!

263
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,833
I don't know
what your goal is here.

264
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:43,333
But I'm not letting
you get any further.

265
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:47,083
I won't let you
hurt my children!

266
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,791
This is what a father
does for his family.

267
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,625
I have no regrets.

268
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,833
I can die a happy man.

269
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,166
[NATSU] We're
getting gramps back.

270
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,875
ya hear me?

271
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,375
[MAKAROV] Natsu!

272
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:08,750
[MAKAROV]
Erza. You, too?

273
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,625
[LAXUS] I was down
with the plan to evacuate.

274
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,500
I'm sure there are plenty
of folks out there who'd let

275
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,583
an old guy take the fall.

276
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,166
But not your guild.

277
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,958
Now attack!

278
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,083
You damned
stupid bunch of kids.

279
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:33,916
[LAXUS] Alright, you guys!.

280
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,291
Let's get ready to hit
this overgrown lizard

281
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,625
with everything we've got!

282
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,458
[LAXUS] If you let loose
on him and I blast him

283
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,250
with a million
watts of lightning.

284
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,166
he'll learn to never mess
with Fairy Tail again!

285
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,333
[ALL] Laxus!

286
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,916
[WENDY] Please Be careful!

287
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,250
Laxus?

288
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,500
[LAXUS] You'd better
get out of the way Natsu,

289
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,041
'cause here it comes!

290
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,750
Hold on just
a second, man!

291
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,208
No, do it
now, Laxus

292
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,500
I haven't
moved yet!

293
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,541
Raging Bolt!

294
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:02,916
Heaven's Wheel.

295
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,416
Scattered Petals!

296
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,791
Super Freezing.

297
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,041
Arrow!

298
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,250
Water Nebula!

299
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,083
Solid Script: Fire!

300
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,291
Now Sagittarius!

301
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:14,375
Get him!

302
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,416
Evil Explosion!

303
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,791
We'll use the full
power of the Thunder Legion!

304
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:19,583
Come on, babies!

305
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:20,750
Time to Rock!

306
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,666
[LAXUS] Seriously?

307
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,250
We just totally unloaded on this
bastard and he's still smiling?

308
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,458
Let's see what you
Dragon Slayers can do!

309
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,458
You hear me, Natsu?

310
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,125
I still owe Laxus a
serious butt kickin'.

311
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,333
[HAPPY] Maybe later.

312
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,666
[GAJEEL] Iron Dragon.

313
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,875
Roar!

314
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,250
[WENDY] Sky Dragon.

315
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,791
Roar!

316
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,250
[NATSU] Fire Dragon.

317
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,500
Roar!

318
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,166
[ERZA] Did that work?

319
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,583
[GILDARTS] Of course not.

320
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,500
What do you mean?

321
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,500
[GILDARTS] He's not even
using half as much power

322
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,416
as the time he fought me.

323
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,083
He's playing with us!

324
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,125
He's back
in the air!

325
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,125
All our attacks
didn't even

326
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,916
put a single
scratch on him!

327
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,333
His power's
unbelievable!

328
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,833
We gave it
everything we had.

329
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,958
Three Dragon Slayers
all at the same time.

330
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:13,166
Our whole guild went against
him, and it still wasn't enough.

331
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,000
This shouldn't happen!

332
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,041
I'm supposed to be
a freakin' Dragon Slayer,

333
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,500
so why the hell
couldn't I beat him?

334
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,375
[PANTHERLILY] What do
you think he'll do now?

335
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,583
Maybe he'll just
decide to go back home.

336
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,833
We can't let
down our guard.

337
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,583
Breath attack!

338
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,958
Is he gonna try and wipe
out the whole island?

339
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,041
My god.

340
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,500
He's that strong?

341
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,375
[LUCY] No.

342
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:44,125
Isn't there
anything we can do?

343
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,208
Is this it?

344
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,791
Are we all just
gonna die here?

345
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,583
Defense magic
users, bring out your

346
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:51,833
most powerful spells!

347
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,041
But I don't have time
to write an Enchantment!

348
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,500
Script magic has plenty
of other defensive spells

349
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:57,791
that we can use right now.

350
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,041
Yes, you're right, Levy!

351
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,666
Think of one real quick!

352
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,666
Everybody concentrate
all your magic power

353
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,208
on Fried and Levy!

354
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,625
Let's hold hands!

355
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,875
[NATSU] Come on, Lucy.

356
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,166
We are not gonna go out crying.

357
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,666
Fairy Tail never
gives up the fight!

358
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,958
We've gotta all face
our fears together!

359
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:30,500
We'll show him we have a bond
that can never be broken!

360
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:42,708
Okay, kids.

361
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,000
Let us all go home together!

362
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,125
[ALL] Back home to Fairy Tail!

363
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,500
I guess it's over now.

364
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,166
Natsu.

365
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,541
[NARRATOR] It all
happened on this day.

366
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:01,916
December sixteenth,
seven-hundred-and-eighty-four.

367
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,833
On Tenrou Island.

368
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:07,666
The day Acnologia
wiped it off the map.

369
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,041
His work completed.

370
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:14,791
he disappeared into
the wild blue yonder.

371
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Search crews spent
nearly half a year scouring

372
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,875
the nearby waters for survivors.

373
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:27,458
Unfortunately,
none were ever found.

374
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:35,000
Time marches on.

375
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:39,625
And seven long years have
passed since that fateful day.

376
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,750
♪

377
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,000
[HAPPY] Natsu, what in the
heck happened to us out there?

378
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,583
[NATSU] I'm not sure.

379
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:18,791
I remember getting attacked by
that big, black dragon and then

380
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,041
seeing blinding white light.

381
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:20,916
[HAPPY] Do you
think it's possible

382
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,750
that we're all dead now?

383
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:24,250
[NATSU] Don't be ridiculous!

384
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,291
You and I both know
there's no way Fairy Tail

385
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:27,791
would ever go out like that!

386
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:30,416
[HAPPY] If we're all alive,
where is everybody?

387
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,708
[HAPPY &amp; NATSU] Next time: Fairy
Tail, year seven-ninety-one!

388
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:35,416
[NATSU] I don't know,
but we need to find 'em

389
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,708
and get back to the guild!

390
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:37,875
[HAPPY] Yeah, you're right.

391
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:40,125
Let's all go back
to Fairy Tail together!
