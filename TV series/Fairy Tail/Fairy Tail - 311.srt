[LARCADE]
I love that look on your face.

2
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:21,958
It's rare to see someone
caught between

3
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,916
defiance and resignation.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,416
[yells]

5
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,250
[LARCADE]
Fear not.

6
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:45,708
For eventually this pain will
give way to ultimate pleasure.

7
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,666
You were fierce earlier.

8
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,666
And you referred to the
magic I wield as "vulgar."

9
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,541
I concede that may be
true to a certain degree.

10
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:59,583
But if you look, you'll
find there's love in it.

11
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:03,000
It allows you to die
without feeling any pain.

12
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:09,791
[LARCADE]
May your spirit of pure white

13
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,000
into the heavens take flight.

14
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:14,750
Kagura, no!

15
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,500
Enjoy it for now.

16
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,333
Your pleasure will
become so intense

17
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:20,708
you'll be begging
for it to stop.

18
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:22,708
[gasps]

19
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,083
No!

20
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:32,625
And now, your death will
be filled with pure bliss.

21
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:42,250
These two have serious injuries,
but they should pull through.

22
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,916
Luckily, I was able to
shrink their wounds.

23
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,916
That's great. Thanks a lot.

24
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,250
[PORLYUSICA]
And if it weren't for Wendy,

25
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,833
we could've lost Juvia.

26
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,041
The main concern is with Natsu.

27
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,416
Poor guy.

28
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,291
Earlier, I could shrink
the mass inside of him,

29
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,791
but my magic seems to've
lost its effect on it.

30
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,041
Whatever that is,

31
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,833
I'm not powerful enough
to counteract it.

32
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,250
That's quite alarming.

33
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,625
Considering we've seen you
shrink an entire island

34
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,291
down to the size of a pebble.

35
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,333
I wonder what could
possibly be that resistant.

36
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,291
It boggles the mind.

37
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,958
He was immune to the
time-stopping spell.

38
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:24,166
And flew into a violent
rage when it was cast.

39
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,333
I hate to admit it, but I'm
completely at a loss.

40
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,291
[DIMARIA]
He's a demon.

41
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:33,958
That's the only way
to truly describe him.

42
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:37,708
[HAPPY]
A demon. E.N.D.

43
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,583
You're wrong about
Natsu! That's a lie!

44
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:50,833
And you believe you know him
to his very core, do you?

45
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,708
I know him way better
than you ever will,

46
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,291
I can guarantee you that.

47
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:58,458
How naive. You can never
truly know a person.

48
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,166
Even so-called "friends"
have things

49
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,291
they keep hidden away
from each other.

50
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,458
Right, Randi?

51
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,791
I mean, Natsu...
he has outbursts,

52
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,708
and he's kinda hard to
work with sometimes,

53
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,500
but I have no doubt
that he's been honest

54
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,041
about who he really
is deep down.

55
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,833
She's totally fallen for him.

56
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:17,875
Seems like it.

57
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,791
Oh, grow up, would ya?

58
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,541
He's practically the
reason I was able

59
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,166
to join Fairy Tail
in the first place.

60
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,833
I'm grateful.

61
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,208
[gasps]

62
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,541
What's happening?

63
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,166
I've never seen someone
just give off smoke.

64
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,083
Natsu, no!

65
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,541
I'm afraid it might be related

66
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,125
to that strange mass
growing inside of him.

67
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,916
Wake up, Natsu!

00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,875

Where the hell am I?

Wait, is somebody there?

77
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,041
It's just me, Natsu.

00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,833
What do you want?

79
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,125
Calm down, please.

80
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,500
All of this is taking place
inside your subconscious.

81
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,750
I don't have to
listen to this crap!

82
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:30,791
[ZEREF] My point is,
I'm not really here with you.

83
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,208
Wait, so this is like
a dream or somethin'?

84
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,708
In a way.

85
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,666
While we're here,
I'd like to ask a favor.

86
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,083
Do you think you could please
call me big brother now?

87
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,041
[NATSU]
Hell no!

88
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,791
It's the end for you.

89
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,166
You will die at any moment.

90
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,583
But before it's completely over,
I wanted the chance to fill in

91
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,500
some of the blanks
in your memory.

92
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,333
Say what?

93
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:56,333
[ZEREF] There's quite a bit to
go over before the year 777,

94
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,041
when you awoke.

95
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,958
I was living with Igneel.

96
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,208
[ZEREF]
Before even that time.

97
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,208
[ZEREF] We had a quiet, peaceful
family life in a small village.

98
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:19,250
[ZEREF] Our mother and father
were kind and loving.

99
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,916
[ZEREF] But that idyllic life
was shattered in an instant

100
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,125
when dragons destroyed our home.

101
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:39,250
Our mother and
father were killed,

102
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,083
and you perished right
alongside them.

103
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,583
[gasps]

104
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,291
[ZEREF]
I vowed to bring you back.

105
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,791
And after many years of
research and hard work.

106
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,666
That became a reality.

107
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:56,250
You were reincarnated as
E.N.D., the ultimate demon.

108
00:07:56,333 --> 00:08:01,333
I realize I've shared that story
with you before to some degree.

109
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:04,250
You refused to learn
to talk or read.

110
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:08,291
I was at my wit's end, so I
consulted my friend Igneel.

111
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,166
I left you in his care.

112
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,041
He'd teach you many things,
but most importantly,

113
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,083
you'd learn Dragon Slayer Magic

114
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,833
so you could one day
defeat Acnologia.

115
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:22,541
For that same purpose,
Metalicana raised Gajeel,

116
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,375
Weisslogia raised Sting,

117
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,541
Skiadrum raised Rogue,

118
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:33,708
and Grandeeney raised
little Wendy Marvel.

119
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,500
But it seems your memories
of this period are a bit fuzzy.

120
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,125
Perhaps the Dragon Soul
technique is to blame.

121
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:44,375
Do you recall when you
first met Gajeel?

122
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,166
You were always quarreling
over something.

123
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,791
And countless times,
Wendy would erupt in tears

124
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,291
as she begged you to get along.

125
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,583
[GRANDEENEY]
She has such a caring soul.

126
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,333
I'm sure when the
others join them,

127
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:59,125
they'll all become
great friends.

128
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,625
[ZEREF] Sting and Rogue were
about the same age as Wendy.

129
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,958
They looked up to you and
Gajeel like big brothers.

130
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,666
[STING] Our dragon parents
would get together

131
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,333
a few times every year.

132
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,375
Luckily, they'd always let
us tag along with them

133
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,583
and have some fun.

134
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,125
[NATSU]
Sting!

135
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:20,083
To be honest, I don't
remember a thing.

00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,500
Not from around
that time, at least.

137
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,625
Wait a sec. What the hell
are you doing here?

138
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,708
Shouldn't you be fighting?

139
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,333
[STING]
I'm not actually Sting.

140
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:33,041
I'm more like an illusion of
him that your mind created,

141
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,708
or something like that.

Just a familiar face to guide
you through your memories.

143
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,625
Seriously?

144
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,125
Yep.

145
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:45,583
In the real world, I'm out there
fighting the Alvarez army.

146

Where did Zeref go?

147
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,708
[STING] Well, don't forget
we're inside your mind, Natsu.

148
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:54,333
I imagine you subconsciously
replaced him with me.

149
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,791
You're not makin'
any sense, man.

150
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,750
[STING]
That's all right. Follow me.

151
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,666
We can find the answer together.

152
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,958
To what?

153
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,458
Don't you wanna know
what that thing

154
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:08,000
growing inside you actually is?

155
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:15,500
Well, thanks to Fried's help,
I was able to get this far.

156
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,875
I'm going to search for Laxus.

157
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,500
Good luck!

158
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,541
Where's Rogue and Lector?

159
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,166
I hope they're okay.

160
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,083
Wait, that smell!

00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,791
Don't give up. Please.

162
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,750
Try to hang in there.

163
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,416
[FROSCH groans]

164
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,958
[YUKINO] I can hardly
even think right now.

165
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,041
Sting, you gotta help us.

166
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:54,541
I know you're out
there! We need you!

167
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,916
[ALL gasp]

168
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,750
Sorry I'm late, you guys!

169
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,625
Oh, you made it!

170
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,625
I knew you'd come
for us, buddy!

171
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,500
Yay!

172
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,166
What's goin' on here?

173
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,250
Looks to me like you've
been givin' my guild members

174
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,750
a hard time!

175
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,125
What a surprise.

176
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:14,208
Seems yet another fool
has decided to join us.

177
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:22,333
If you truly want to
hurt me, then try harder.

178
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,625
Be careful, Sting!
Don't let that touch you!

179
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,666
[STING]
What is this?

180
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,250
It tastes kinda funky,

181
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,708
but it feels good,
in some weird way.

182
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,833
[laughs]

183
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,458
[STING]
White magic has no effect on me.

184
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:45,208
After all, I am the
White Dragon Slayer.

185
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:57,291
What's your deal?
Something pisses me off.

186
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:00,166
To make it worse,
you smell like Natsu.

187
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,041
Just who in the hell
are you, anyway?

188
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,375
Why do you and Natsu
have the same scent?

189
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,541
Well, according to him,

190
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,458
his last name is Dragneel,
just like Natsu.

191
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:24,833
He's told us a lot of things,

192
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,875
but I'm not sure we can
believe a single word of it.

193
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,250
He said that he's Zeref's son

194
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,791
and Natsu is Zeref's
younger brother.

195
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,791
Huh? That doesn't
make any sense to me.

196
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,458
I'm having a hard time
following it, too.

197
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:41,125
Hold on. It doesn't add up
with the way this guy smells.

198
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:44,958
If that's true, he and Natsu
having the same scent is weird.

199
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,958
[STING] I mean, I could sorta
see if he smelled like Zeref,

200
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:54,333
but Nastu and Zeref don't
really give off the same odor.

201
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:02,125
Everyone's got their own scent.
It's not genetic or anything.

202
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:05,625
But not this guy. He smells
exactly like Natsu.

203
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,625
Things are not so simple.

204
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:11,000
One could say Natsu is
Zeref's child like me.

205
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,583
What did I tell you?

206
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:23,208
Light magic and white magic
aren't gonna work on me!

207
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,750
[STING]
Holy Ray!

208
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,500
Holy Nova!

209
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,458
You're a more capable
foe than I'd realized.

210
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:40,875
But still...

211
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,291
[LARCADE]
Famished Soul!

212
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:49,166
[stomach growls]

213
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,666
Huh?

214
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,416
What's wrong, Sting?

215
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,500
The hunger you feel will
be impossible to endure.

216
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,458
[stomach growling]

217
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:01,958
[STING] Ugh. Oh, man.
I'm starving all of a sudden.

218
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,166
[chuckles]

219
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,166
[STING yells]

220
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,416
Stay strong, buddy!

221
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm tryin'.

222
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,541
You can beat this guy.

223
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:19,041
Just hang in there!
You got this!

224
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,666
Come on, Sting!

225
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,833
You look so freakin' tasty!

226
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:27,208
[LECTOR]
Whoa! What? Sting, it's me!

227
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,875
[YUKINO] Master Sting!
What's come over you?

228
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:33,250
[KAGURA] Hey! Don't you dare
look at me like that!

229
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:41,125
Yes. Go and eat your fill.

230
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,208
[LECTOR]
Ow! Sting! Cut it out!

231
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:46,208
It's Lector! I'm your
friend, not your food!

232
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:50,000
[STING] I need meat!
My belly is crying!

233
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,916
Come to your senses!

234
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,625
Yukino?

235
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:04,541
So hungry. I can't
take it anymore.

236
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,208
I feel like I'm gonna
starve to death.

237
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:10,208
Oh, please. Save me some.

238
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,708
Hey, Rogue. Are you
still able to move?

239
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:44,125
I can get around somewhat.

240
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,750
I think I've taken
too much damage

241
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,125
to do anything beyond that.

242
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,666
[MINERVA]
I feel the same.

243
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,750
It's like my resources are gone.

244
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:56,083
This battle has taken nearly all
the strength I had left in me.

245
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,625
And we can probably
assume the others

246
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,291
have had their powers
drained as well.

247
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,791
Which means Sting and
Yukino are in trouble.

248
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:06,458
Whoever cast that spell
is quite powerful, indeed.

249
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:10,125
M'lady, are you able to
determine their location?

250
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,375
I can definitely sense
their power from here.

251
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,791
Seems to be coming
from that way.

252
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:19,833
Wouldn't be very much of
a journey to reach them.

253
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,750
You shouldn't go alone,
I can come with you.

254
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,875
Please stay. I believe
you should remain here.

255
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,375
I can go!

256
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,333
You've taken quite a bit more
damage than I have today.

257
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,291
In the event that
something happens to me,

258
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,791
it'd be better for our side
you if were to stay behind

259
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,583
and avoid the fight.

260
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:52,750
[LARCADE] The world of man
is filled with desires.

261
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:56,333
May you devour each other
and meet your ruin.

262
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:08,041
Everybody is super
hungry and I am, too.

263
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,875
But I think I'm gonna
wait a little bit

264
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:13,000
for Rogue to come back
so we can eat together.

265
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:21,500
I know you're dying of
starvation, ol' pal...

266
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,791
...so if this is the only
thing that'll save you...

267
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,125
I gotta do what I gotta do!

268
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,333
[STING] Sorry, ladies. I don't
have any other choice!

269
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,041
[YUKINO, KAGURA grunt]

270
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,041
[STING]
Sorry, Frosch!

271
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,125
[FROSCH groans]

272
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,500
[STING] This is the
only way I can think of

273
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,625
to fight my appetite!

274
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,208
That so?

275
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,500
But how do you plan to stave off
those crippling hunger pangs?

276
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,791
I'm just gonna have to eat you!

277
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:08,583
Have you forgotten how weak
this hunger has made you?

278
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,500
How could I forget? But still--!

279
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,625
There's no point in trying.

280
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:18,625
I'm Sabertooth's Master.
I gotta save my guild!

281
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,000
[LARCADE]
Hm. Never heard of them before.

282
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,708
Why would you bother getting
involved in such a fight

283
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,708
if you're not a member
of Fairy Tail?

284
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,750
Because their guild
needs our help right now

285
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,333
and that's what allies
do for each other!

286
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:40,541
[STING] Because they helped
us change for the better!

287
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:43,125
And because I owe it to Natsu!

288
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,458
Don't agonize over owing him.

289
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,708
His spirit will be
free from concern,

290
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,583
once he's been released
from this world.

291
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,250
I have taken on the
responsibility of killing him

292
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,125
with my own hands.

293
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,291
What the--?

294
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,125
M'lady's Territory spell!

295
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:10,833
Territory. That's
space-swapping magic.

296
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,250
Yukino!

297
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:24,375
Oh. I didn't see you before.

298
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:27,500
What are you doing?
Cut that out this instant!

299
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,958
I just can't help myself.
You look so yummy.

300
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,250
What the hell is wrong with you?

301
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,750
I'm not some sort
of dinner entrée!

302
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,166
Please, stop!

303
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,625
Wondered where you were.

304
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,875
I don't have enough strength
left to fight alongside you.

305
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:53,583
But m'lady sent me for
delivery, so eat me!

306
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,916
Say what? You mean--

307
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,500
[ROGUE]
You're hungry, aren't you?

308
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:02,625
So I want you to consume
the rest of my magic power!

309
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,708
But I can't eat a
different type of magic;

310
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,125
it's not gonna work.

311
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:10,291
Might as well try
since I'm starving!

312
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:15,416
There are three primary
desires that drive humans.

313
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,416
First one is sex.

314
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,333
Then there's food.

315
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:22,291
They're all eventually
followed by sleep.

316
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,916
[LARCADE] That is the final
desire I shall grant you.

317
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,458
The gift of sleep.

318
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:34,458
To be more precise, what I
offer is eternal slumber.

319
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,125
I've heard about
enough of your crap!

320
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,208
And I hate the way you smell!

321
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,625
It's burning up the
hair in my nostrils!

322
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,916
The fact that a weak,
insignificant person

323
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,875
has the gall to challenge me
makes me want to vomit.

324
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:54,541
Hey, Rogue!
Thanks for the power!

325
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,625
Now go, White Shadow Dragon!

326
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,583
I've got a fire in my belly.

327
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,541
On to the next desire.

328
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,125
One you will not
be able to resist.

329
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:08,125
This spell is known
as "Rest In Peace."

330
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:13,125
Call it whatever you want,
but you're still gonna lose.

331
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,041
Once I've ended your life,

332
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:18,958
Natsu Dragneel will be
the next one to perish.

333
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,458
[STING] Are you tryin'
to get me more fired up?

334
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:24,458
'Cause whether you like it or
not, that's what's happening!

335
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:40,125
Natsu, come on, just
open your eyes. Natsu!

336
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,291
Natsu.

337
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,750
This is bad.

338
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:47,166
His temperature is
continuing to drop.

339
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,875
If this keeps up...

340
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,666
No.

341
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,583
Wake up!

342
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,208
[LUCY]
Natsu!

343
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,958
[LUCY]
Sting absorbs Rogue's power

344
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:42,583
and overwhelms Larcade with
a powerful combination

345
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,583
of White and Shadow magic.

346
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:47,708
But the enemy still unleashes
his Rest In Peace spell

347
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:50,125
in an attempt to lull
Sting into a slumber

348
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,291
from which he can never awake.

349
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:54,791
Can the Master of Sabertooth
find a way to combat

350
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:58,375
the irresistible waves of
desire washing over him?

351
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:02,125
Next Time: "Sting,
the White Shadow Dragon."

352
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:06,000
The combined powers form
an unbendable iron will.
