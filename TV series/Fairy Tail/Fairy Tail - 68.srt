1
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,916
Lahar:
JELLAL FERNANDES.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,791
YOU ARE HEREBY UNDER ARREST

3
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,583
FOR CRIMES
AGAINST THE KINGDOM.

4
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:38,125
- ( theme music playing )

5
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:54,041
- (singing in Japanese )

6
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,166
- NO,
PLEASE DON'T TAKE HIM AWAY!

7
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,791
- Happy: "A GUILD FOR ONE."

8
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,041
- Wendy: IT'S NOT FAIR.

9
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,875
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HE'S DONE!

10
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,708
ALL HIS MEMORIES
HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY ERASED.

11
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:31,083
- IGNORANCE OF ONE'S CRIMES
IS NO DEFENSE.

12
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:34,500
PENAL CODE SECTION 13
STATES THIS EXPLICITLY.

13
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,375
YOU MAY
REMOVE THE BARRIER NOW.

14
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,583
- YES, SIR.

15
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,375
- HOLD ON!

16
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:45,083
- Jellal: IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I WILL NOT RESIST ARREST.

17
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,916
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

18
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,958
I WISH
THAT I COULD REMEMBER YOU.

19
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:59,416
I'M SORRY THAT I CANNOT.

20
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,041
TRULY.

21
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,458
- WHEN SHE WAS LOST AND ALONE,

22
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,041
YOU FOUND HER WANDERING
AND SAVED HER LIFE.

23
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,041
- DID I?

24
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:14,666
I MAY NEVER KNOW THE HARM
I INFLICTED UPON YOU

25
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,833
AND COUNTLESS OTHERS.

26
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:21,208
BUT AT LEAST I KNOW AT SOME
POINT, I HELPED ONE PERSON.

27
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,750
ERZA.

28
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:35,625
I WON'T FORGET
YOUR KINDNESS.

29
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,458
- Erza: 
I CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN.

30
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:56,166
I CAN'T LET THEM TAKE HIM
AWAY LIKE THIS.

31
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,833
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

32
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,375
ALL THESE YEARS, HE WAS
SLEEPWALKING

33
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,583
THROUGH THE DARKNESS.

34
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:09,875
HE'S FINALLY BEEN
LET INTO THE LIGHT AGAIN.

35
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,875
THEY CAN'T SHUT HIM AWAY.

36
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,791
- YOU HAVE
ANY MORE PARTING WORDS?

37
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,541
- NO.

38
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,500
- YOU'LL GET AT LEAST
A LIFE SENTENCE.

39
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,166
THAT'S IF YOU'RE LUCKY.

40
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,583
- NO WAY.

41
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:33,541
- IN ANY CASE, YOU'LL NEVER
SEE THESE PEOPLE AGAIN.

42
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,875
- HE'S GONE.

43
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:42,208
- I WILL NOT LET HIM GO!
- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

44
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,375
- NATSU!

45
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,708
- I DON'T THINK THAT'S
A GOOD IDEA!

46
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,458
- ( all fighting )

47
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:52,166
- STOP THIS!
- OUTTA MY WAY!

48
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,458
HE'S ONE OF US!

49
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,666
AND THAT MEANS
HE COMES WITH US!

50
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,208
- NATSU.

51
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,416
- NO, DON'T DO THIS.

52
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,708
- SUBDUE THAT MAN!
- AHHH!

53
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,541
- ( heartbeat )

54
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:17,416
- KEEP GOIN', NATSU!
- DON'T STOP!

55
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,875
- Gray: GIVE UP.

56
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,541
THERE'S NO WAY YOU GUYS
CAN STOP HIM!

57
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,125
- THIS IS WRONG ANYWAY.

58
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,708
JELLAL TOOK DOWN NIRVANA!

59
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,250
HE JUST SAVED
A WHOLE LOTTA PEOPLE,

60
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,291
AND THIS IS THE THANKS
YOU GIVE HIM?

61
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:34,291
- YOU WOULD PUNISH THIS MAN
FOR HIS SINS,

62
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,416
YET STILL CHOOSE NOT TO REWARD
HIM FOR HIS GOOD DEEDS?

63
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,708
- IT PAINS ME,
BUT IF YOU TAKE HIM AWAY,

64
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,541
IT WILL HURT ERZA MORE!

65
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,625
- HEY, I CAN'T SEE
WHO I'M HITTING,

66
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,875
SO I'M INNOCENT, RIGHT?
- ME TOO!

67
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,625
- NO, PLEASE.

68
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,875
PLEASE DON'T
TAKE JELLAL AWAY FOREVER!

69
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:54,833
- C'MON!
LET HIM GO!

70
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,458
LISTEN,
YOU OWE ERZA BIG TIME.

71
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,458
SHE NEEDS YOU
TO STAY BY HER SIDE!

72
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,833
SHE DID IT FOR YOU, MAN!

73
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,666
YOU GOTTA STAY!

74
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,416
'CAUSE WHETHER YOU LIKE IT
OR NOT, YOU'RE ONE OF US NOW.

75
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,250
- ARREST THEM ALL

76
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,291
FOR AIDING A FUGITIVE
AND OBSTRUCTING THE LAW!

77
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,625
- THAT'S ENOUGH!
STOP THIS AT ONCE.

78
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,833
I APOLOGIZE
FOR THIS DISTURBANCE.

79
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:40,625
IT'S GONE TOO FAR.
I'M THE ONE TO BLAME.

80
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,208
NOW PLEASE...

81
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,083
TAKE HIM AWAY.

82
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,041
- BUT WHY?
- SIT DOWN!

83
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,791
- YES, MA'AM.

84
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,500
- Jellal: I REMEMBER.

85
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,291
IT WAS THE COLOR
OF YOUR HAIR.

86
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:31,875
FAREWELL, OLD FRIEND.

87
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,000
- ( hoof beats )

88
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,375
- Happy: HEY, YOU GUYS,

89
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,083
DOES ANYBODY HAPPEN
TO KNOW WHERE ERZA WENT?

90
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,958
- SHE JUST NEEDS TO BE ALONE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

91
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,708
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

92
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:28,166
- Jellal: BUT AT LEAST I KNOW
AT SOME POINT,

93
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,416
I HELPED ONE PERSON.

94
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,583
- Young Jellal:
MY NAME'S JELLAL FERNANDES.

95
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,625
- Young Wally:
WHOA, THAT'S A TOUGH ONE.

96
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,625
SO DON'T GET SORE
IF I FORGET IT.

97
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,708
- I WON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH YOURS.

98
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:57,166
WALLY BUCHANAN.
YEAH, IT'S KIND OF BORING, EH?

99
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,500
- ALRIGHT RED,
YOU'RE "ERZA" WHAT?

100
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,791
- NOTHING, THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT.

101
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,458
JUST PLAIN OLD ERZA.

102
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,291
- WELL, YOU GOTTA
HAVE A LAST NAME.

103
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,416
OOOHH.
- HEY, WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA?

104
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,250
- YOUR HAIR'S PRETTY, IS ALL.

105
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,916
YOU THINK SO?
- I GOT IT.

106
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,916
HOW ABOUT WE MAKE
YOUR LAST NAME SCARLET?

107
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,750
- Young Wally:
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDIN' ME.

108
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,958
YOU CAN'T JUST MAKE UP
WHATEVER NAME YA WANT.

109
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,500
- I LIKE THAT A LOT.

110
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:31,833
SO NOW,
I'LL BE ERZA SCARLET.

111
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,666
- THAT'S PERFECT.

112
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,083
NOW I'M NEVER GONNA FORGET
YOUR NAME.

113
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,541
ALL I GOTTA DO IS THINK
ABOUT YOUR PRETTY HAIR.

114
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,291
- JELLAL.

115
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,541
- Lucy: WHEN THE SUN ROSE
THE NEXT MORNING,

116
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:05,583
IT FILLED THE SKY WITH THE
MOST BEAUTIFUL CRIMSON COLOR.

117
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,750
I'D NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE.

118
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:13,375
IN A WAY, THAT SUNRISE
MADE ME THINK OF ERZA.

119
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,500
IT REMINDED ME OF THE HOPE
SHE CARRIES

120
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:20,000
AND THE WARMTH AND PASSION
SHE HAS IN HER HEART.

121
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,375
I LIKE TO THINK OF HER LOOKING
INTO THE SKY THAT MORNING

122
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,666
AND SEEING THE BEAUTY
OF THE NEW DAY DAWNING.

123
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,416
I JUST HOPE SHE SAW IT.

124
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,458
- OOOH!
THIS IS ADORABLE!

125
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,791
- YEAH, YEAH, YOU LOOK CUTE
AND ALL,

126
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,916
BUT YOU'RE NOT NEARLY
AS SEXY AS ME.

127
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,333
- EVERYONE IN THE VILLAGE
IS A MEMBER OF THE GUILD.

128
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:07,500
CAIT SHELTER'S FAMOUS FOR ITS
PRETTY TEXTILES AND CLOTHES.

129
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:11,000
- SO ARE THESE LIKE
TRADITIONAL NIRVIT STYLES?

130
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,333
- I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT BEFORE,

131
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,625
BUT I GUESS IT WOULD
MAKE THE MOST SENSE, HUH?

132
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,916
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA

133
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,208
EVERYONE IN THIS GUILD BUT YOU
IS A DESCENDANT OF THE NIRVIT.

134
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,333
- Wendy: WELL, YEAH,
I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO JOINED

135
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,708
AFTER IT WAS FORMED.

136
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,708
- COME TRY THIS ON, ERZA.

137
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:30,041
I KNOW HOW YOU LOVE
A COSTUME CHANGE.

138
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,333
- YES.
I SUPPOSE.

139
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,708
- AND I'M GUESSING
YOU DON'T KNOW

140
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,833
WHEN CAIT SHELTER
JOINED THE LEAGUE OF GUILDS

141
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,208
ALONG WITH THE OTHERS,
DO YOU?

142
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,833
I DON'T WANNA BE RUDE,

143
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,708
BUT I HAD NEVER EVEN HEARD
OF YOUR GUILD

144
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,708
BEFORE ALL OF US
WERE THROWN TOGETHER.

145
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,791
I KNOW EVERY GUILD CAN'T BE AS
POPULAR AS MINE, BUT STILL.

146
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,791
- COME TO THINK OF IT,
I HADN'T EITHER.

147
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,208
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

148
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:58,291
( laughs ) WOW, I DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT WE WERE SO OBSCURE.

149
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,083
- THIS IS ALL VERY INTERESTING.

150
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,916
BUT EVERYONE
IS WAITING ON US.

151
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,166
- Robaul: FAIRY TAIL.

152
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,833
BLUE PEGASUS.

153
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,791
LAMIA SCALE.

154
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,291
NOT TO MENTION
WENDY AND CARLA.

155
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:17,625
I COMMEND YOUR EFFORTS IN NOT
ONLY DEFEATING THE ORACION SAYS,

156
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,500
BUT SAVING OUR VILLAGE
FROM NIRVANA'S WRATH.

157
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:24,041
SPEAKING AS A REPRESENTATIVE
OF OUR REGIONAL GUILD LEAGUE,

158
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:27,000
I, ROBAUL,
OFFER MY DEEPEST GRATITUDE.

159
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,000
THANK YOU. 
- ( all laughing )

160
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:32,666
- NABURA,
WE ARE IN YOUR DEBT.

161
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,875
- WE WERE HAPPY TO HELP YOU,
MASTER ROBAUL!

162
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,000
IT WAS A HARD-WON VICTORY

163
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,375
AGAINST A FEROCIOUS OPPONENT.

164
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:44,416
BUT FROM THE DEEPEST,
DARKEST DEPTHS OF DESPAIR,

165
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,416
A LIGHT SHINED DOWN ON US.

166
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,500
IT WAS THE BRIGHT
AND WARMING GLOW

167
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,375
OF TRUE FRIENDSHIP.

168
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,875
WE FOLLOWED IT
ALL THE WAY TO VICTORY.

169
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,625
- All: WELL SAID, MASTER.
- MAN.

170
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,708
- THE BRIGHT AND WARMING GLOW
IS PROBABLY COMING

171
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,291
FROM THE SPOTLIGHT HE'S HOGGING.
- NO JOKE.

172
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,666
AND BY THE WAY,
DID HE EVER FIGHT ANYONE?

173
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,708
- I SUPPOSE IT'S OVER NOW.

174
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,250
- YOU TWO SHOULD KNOW,
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

175
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,708
- THANK YOU, SIR.

176
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,250
- HEY,
WE DESERVE A VICTORY PARTY.

177
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,916
- AYE, SIR!
- YES, YES, YES, YES!

178
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,833
IT'S TIME--
- All: YES IT'S TIME--

179
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,333
- TO GET DOWN.
- TO GET DOWN.

180
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,916
- All: OH YES, OH YES,
OH YES, OH YES....

181
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,666
- WOW!
- A PARTY SOUNDS GREAT.

182
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,416
- PLEASE KEEP YOUR CLOTHES ON!
WOW!  YOU TOO, BUDDY.

183
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,958
- ( laughing )

184
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:33,291
- All:
OH YES, OH YES, OH YES...

185
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:40,250
- SO IS THE CAIT SHELTER GUILD
FEELING UP TO GETTING DOWN?

186
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,625
- OH YES, OH YES!
- All: OH YES, OH YES, OH YES...

187
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,208
- OH YES!

188
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,625
OH.

189
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,583
- OH!

190
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,541
UH...

191
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,583
- ( all grunt )

192
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,875
- I'M TRULY SORRY.

193
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,583
I'VE NEGLECTED MY DUTY
TO TELL YOU

194
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,083
ABOUT THE NIRVIT PEOPLE.

195
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,583
PLEASE ACCEPT
MY SINCERE APOLOGY.

196
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:24,041
- WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT'S
GONNA STOP US FROM PARTYIN'!

197
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,750
- BUT WE'LL LISTEN TO WHATEVER
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO SAY.

198
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,000
RIGHT?
- AYE, SIR.

199
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,250
- Wendy:
IT'S ALL RIGHT, MASTER.

200
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,500
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL US
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

201
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,875
- IT IS IMPORTANT.

202
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,666
I ASK THAT EVERYONE
PLEASE LISTEN VERY CLOSELY

203
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,333
TO THE TALE
I AM ABOUT TO TELL.

204
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,750
FIRST, LET ME CLEAR THE AIR
ABOUT SOMETHING.

205
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,375
THE TRUTH IS, WE ARE
NOT DESCENDANTS

206
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,333
OF THE NIRVIT PEOPLE.

207
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,750
- WHAT?

208
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:58,000
- INDEED WE ARE THE NIRVITS
THEMSELVES.

209
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:02,291
AND MANY YEARS AGO,
400 TO BE EXACT,

210
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:05,500
NIRVANA WAS CREATED,
FASHIONED BY MY HANDS.

211
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:08,375
- BY YOU?
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

212
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,916
- 400 YEARS AGO?

213
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,583
Robaul: I THOUGHT IF MY DREAM
OF NIRVANA WAS MADE A REALITY,

214
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:24,625
I COULD END THE GHASTLY WARS
TEARING THE WORLD APART.

215
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,291
I WOULD DO SO BY REVERSING
THE MORALITY

216
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:31,416
OF THOSE WHOSE MINDS WERE SET ON
THE DESTRUCTION OF OTHERS.

217
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,416
WE MADE OUR HOME THERE.

218
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,250
AND WE TOOK GREAT JOY IN WHAT
WE'D ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH PEACE.

219
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,083
WE WERE A SHINING BEACON
OF LIGHT

220
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:43,166
IN A ONCE DARK
AND SHADOWY WORLD.

221
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:47,583
HOWEVER,
DESPITE OUR BEST INTENTIONS,

222
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,791
WE COULD NOT CHANGE THE FACT
THAT FOR EVERY ACTION

223
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,708
THERE IS AN EQUAL
AND OPPOSITE REACTION.

224
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,583
NIRVANA HAD BROUGHT LIGHT

225
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,833
TO WHAT WAS ONCE
A TERRIBLE DARKNESS,

226
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:02,125
NOT BY CHASING IT AWAY,
BUT ABSORBING IT, SO TO SPEAK.

227
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:06,583
THE WORLD YEARNS
FOR BALANCE AND ORDER.

228
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,541
THE LIGHT SERVES NO PURPOSE
WITHOUT THE DARKNESS,

229
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,958
AND VICE VERSA.

230
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,791
LIGHT IS BORN FROM DARKNESS,

231
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,208
AND DARKNESS
IS BORN FROM LIGHT.

232
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,916
THE TWO
ARE FOREVER INTERTWINED.

233
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,291
- Gray: YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY
HOW IT PLAYED OUT FOR US.

234
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,875
- ALL THE WORLD'S EVIL,

235
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,875
TAKEN FROM THOSE WHOSE HEARTS
WERE ONCE CONSUMED WITH IT,

236
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,625
WAS TRANSFERRED
TO THE PEACE-LOVING NIRVIT.

237
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,000
- IT WAS?

238
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,000
- IT WAS A NIGHTMARE.

239
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,875
ENGULFED IN RAGE AND HATRED,

240
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,250
WE SLAUGHTERED EACH OTHER
UNTIL NO ONE WAS LEFT STANDING.

241
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,458
THAT'S NOT QUITE TRUE.

242
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,666
FOR I AM THE ONLY SURVIVOR.

243
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:21,416
THEN AGAIN,
IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION,

244
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,500
THE WORD "SURVIVOR"
IS A LITTLE MISLEADING.

245
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:29,250
IN TRUTH, MY BODY CEASED
TO FUNCTION MANY YEARS AGO.

246
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,791
WHAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU NOW
IS A PROJECTION

247
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,458
OF THE MAN I ONCE WAS.

248
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,958
AS PUNISHMENT FOR MY SINS,

249
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:42,500
I, THIS POWERLESS SPIRIT,
HAVE STOOD AS SENTINEL

250
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,375
OVER MY CREATION
FOR 400 YEARS,

251
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,583
KEEPING MY WEARY EYES OPEN
FOR THE ONE WHO COULD,

252
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,791
AT LAST,
DESTROY NIRVANA

253
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,708
AND CONSIGN IT
TO THE PAGES OF HISTORY.

254
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,375
AND NOW

255
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,375
MY POST CAN BE VACATED,

256
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,291
FOR THAT PERSON
HAS BEEN FOUND.

257
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,291
- NO.

258
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,458
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

259
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,166
- MMM.

260
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,750
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?!
DON'T GO!

261
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,458
- YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE US.

262
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,750
- Wendy: MAGUNA!
PEPEL!

263
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:32,041
- EVERYONE'S DISAPPEARING
RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR EYES.

264
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:35,000
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

265
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,333
PLEASE DON'T GO!

266
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:44,083
- I'VE DECEIVED YOU WENDY.
FOR THAT, I AM DEEPLY SORRY.

267
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,416
ALL YOUR FELLOW GUILD MEMBERS
WERE SPECTERS.

268
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,166
THEY WERE NOTHING
BUT ILLUSIONS.

269
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,583
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

270
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,041
- ILLUSIONS
WITH THEIR OWN PERSONALITIES?

271
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:01,291
- THAT TAKES POWERFUL
CREATION MAGIC.

272
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:08,000
- FOR MANY YEARS, I LIVED
IN THIS DESERTED VILLAGE ALONE,

273
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,875
ALWAYS KEEPING A WATCHFUL EYE
OVER NIRVANA.

274
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,500
UNTIL ONE DAY,
WHEN A BOY CAME TO ME

275
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,458
WITH A COMPANION
NEEDING HELP.

276
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:26,125
- I NEED SOMEONE
TO TAKE CARE OF HER FOR ME.

277
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:30,000
- HIS EYES BURNED WITH SUCH
INTENSITY AND SINCERITY

278
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:33,333
THAT I SIMPLY HAD NO CHOICE
BUT TO TAKE THE LITTLE GIRL IN.

279
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:37,208
I HAD RESIGNED MYSELF
TO A SOLITARY EXISTENCE,

280
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,333
BUT THERE SHE WAS.

281
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,708
- Wendy: HEY, MISTER?
WHAT IS THE PLACE?

282
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,708
- WELL, HOW DO I PUT THIS?

283
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,958
- HE LIED TO ME.

284
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:52,333
HE SAID HE WAS GONNA TAKE ME
TO A MAGIC GUILD.

285
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,625
- RIGHT!
THIS IS A GUILD.

286
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:57,541
A MAGICAL GUILD FOR WIZARDS
OF EVERY STRIPE.

287
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,041
- WOW!  REALLY?

288
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,875
- OF COURSE IT IS.

289
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,375
GO ON AND SEE FOR YOURSELF.

290
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:06,750
YOUR NEW FRIENDS
ARE ALL OUTSIDE WAITING FOR YOU.

291
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,250
- Robaul: I FILLED THE VILLAGE
WITH APPARITIONS

292
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,125
SO SHE WOULDN'T BE ALONE.

293
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,666
- SO YOU CREATED AN ENTIRE GUILD
JUST FOR WENDY?

294
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,833
- NO ONE I CARE FOR
IS A REAL PERSON?!

295
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,833
HOW COULD YOU DO SOMETHING
SO CRUEL TO ME, MASTER?

296
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:25,208
- DON'T FRET, MY DEAR.
CALM DOWN.

297
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:29,750
NEITHER YOU NOR CARLA
NEED THOSE IMAGINARY FRIENDS.

298
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,458
YOU'RE SURROUNDED
BY REAL FRIENDS

299
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,250
WHO CARE FOR YOU.

300
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,666
( laughs )

301
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,166
A BRIGHT FUTURE AWAITS YOU.

302
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,666
EMBRACE IT WITH OPEN ARMS.

303
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,791
- MASTER!

304
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,625
- Robaul:
TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU,

305
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:06,125
I OWE MY DEEPEST GRATITUDE.

306
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:10,416
I KNOW I CAN LEAVE WENDY
AND CARLA IN YOUR HANDS.

307
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:37,833
- MASTER!

308
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,125
- I KNOW ALL TOO WELL

309
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:19,916
THE PAIN
OF LOSING A LOVED ONE.

310
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,166
BUT YOU'LL HEAL.

311
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,875
