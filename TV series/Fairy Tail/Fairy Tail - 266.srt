1
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,250
[HAPPY]
Whoa! Check it out!

2
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,750
That's the stadium from
the Grand Magic Games!

3
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,666
We had some crazy times there.

4
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,333
Why's this place look
like it got attacked

5
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:28,750
by a pack of dragons?

6
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:32,958
Because it did, remember?
It was kind of a big deal.

7
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,291
They came outta
that Eclipse thing

8
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,583
and blew up half
the freakin' city.

9
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,583
[NATSU]
Huh. Oh, yeah.

10
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:41,208
Now that ya mention it,
that does sound familiar.

11
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,458
[HAPPY sighs]

12
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,291
Well, if I thought
that you gave a crap,

13
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,750
I'd say that it's impressive
how they've rebuilt so much

14
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:48,333
in so little time.

15
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,333
[NATSU]
Yeah, it is.

16
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:04,708
[NATSU] Just goes to show you
we humans always bounce back!

17
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,166
Aye!

18
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,000
[NATSU]
So, Happy.

19
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,541
[HAPPY]
Yeah? What's up?

20
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,375
[NATSU]
Where exactly are ya leadin' us?

21
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:16,583
[HAPPY] Uh, I'm not leadin'
us anywhere. You are.

22
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,500
That's a question you
should be askin' yourself.

23
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,208
[NATSU]
Huh? You're kiddin,' right?

24
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:22,625
I've been followin' you
the whole time, dude.

25
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,500
That's the price we pay
for walkin' side by side.

26
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,041
Guess so.

27
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:30,875
[BOTH]
Hm?

28
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,291
Wait, don't say a word.

29
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:34,208
My head's doin' that thing
where it hurts really bad

30
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:36,208
and then a thought pops out!

31
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:37,791
Be careful.

32
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,000
[gasps]

33
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,541
[HAPPY]
Listen,

34
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,500
we've been on this training
mission for an entire week now.

35
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:43,750
[NATSU]
Yeah?

36
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,208
[HAPPY] But when I think
about it real hard...

37
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:46,583
[NATSU]
Yeah?

38
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,333
...all we've done so far
is eat, sleep, and walk!

39
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,625
You haven't been
training at all!

40
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:01,875
Yeah, you're right. I really
haven't done anything.

41
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:04,791
[HAPPY] We've been trampin'
around like a couple a hobos.

42
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,458
It's the first time we
tried to do somethin'

43
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,625
by ourselves in months,

44
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:10,583
and we forgot what
we even wanted to do!

45
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:13,958
[HAPPY] I can't believe
how much we suck.

46
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:19,000
[NATSU]
Try not to think about it.

47
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,250
[HAPPY] Okay, the training
thing might be a bust,

48
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,166
but I still feel like
we should stop walkin'

49
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,916
in random directions.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,583
We need to pick out
like a destination

51
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,166
or a goal or somethin'.

52
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,333
Easier said than done.

53
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,625
Hey! I got it!

54
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,875
[NATSU]
Tenrou Island, eh? Good idea!

55
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,500
[HAPPY] I know we spent
seven years there,

56
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,666
but we didn't exactly
get to see the sights.

57
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,875
It's holy ground and the
first Master's buried there.

58
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,666
We should make a pilgrimage!

59
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,708
Sounds awesome!
Let's get this rollin'!

60
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:56,083
Yes, lets. Although,
the better word is "rowing."

61
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,333
[NATSU yelps]

62
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,250
[NATSU]
Ugh... Happy, listen.

63
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,666
I need you to tie a
rope around my waist

64
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,375
and throw me overboard, 'kay?

65
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,208
Just let it drag me,
I'll be fine. Yeah...

66
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,750
[HAPPY]
I would if I had some.

67
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,916
But I bet we're
gettin' pretty close.

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,750
[HAPPY gasps]

69
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:15,375
That's it!

70
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,708
[NATSU]
Uh?

71
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,708
[HAPPY]
Won't be long now!

72
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,458
[laughs]

73
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,125
Solid ground at last!
That's what I'm talkin' about!

74
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,708
[HAPPY] Hurry up, Natsu.
Let's go find Mavis' grave.

75
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,083
Sure. So d'ya know
how to get there?

76
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,541
[HAPPY]
Aye!

77
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,791
I got directions from Cana
like a really long time ago.

78
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,041
You've already gotten
us lost, haven't ya?

79
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:49,041
Of course not, I'm followin'
Cana's directions perfectly!

80
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,333
Okay, then why don't
you say 'em back to me?

81
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,041
Well, my memory's
a little bit foggy,

82
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,541
but I do know that
she said there'd be

83
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,208
a whole bunch of trees and rocks
and bushes along the way.

84
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,041
And look around! There are!

85
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,125
[NATSU]
Huh.

86
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,041
Yup, there's definitely
a whole bunch

87
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,916
of that stuff around here.

88
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,916
[NATSU]
So yeah, I guess we're good.

89
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,041
[HAPPY]
Aye!

90
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,041
Wait a minute!

91
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,083
The whole friggin'
island's covered

92
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,083
in trees, rocks, and bushes!

93
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,166
She might as well have told me

94
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,083
it was somewhere
near a big tree.

95
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:20,166
At least that woulda
told us which way to walk.

96
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,416
Hey, look!

97
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,708
Whoa.

98
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,875
[HAPPY]
An old village!

99
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,958
[NATSU]
It's totally overgrown.

100
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:34,125
[HAPPY] Yeah. It's practically
part of the forest again.

101
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,416
We never would've seen
it from the ocean.

102
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,708
[NATSU] I didn't realize Tenrou
Island ever had a town.

103
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,250
[HAPPY]
Neither did I.

104
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:44,541
But I don't think we've ever
been to this side of it before.

105
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,750
[gasps]

106
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,833
[NATSU] Oh, cool.
That tree's a building.

107
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,958
And judgin' from the markings,
I bet is was a guild house.

108
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,416
Huh?

109
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,000
Red Lizard? Never heard of it.

110
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,625
Did someone used to live here?

111
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:13,333
Nah, It was prob'ly
just a barn for animals.

112
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:16,375
[NATSU]
There's a place to sit though.

113
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,041
[HAPPY]
Hey, check this out!

114
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,375
[NATSU]
That some kinda math?

115
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:25,000
[HAPPY] I guess so. Makes for
some really weird graffiti.

116
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,416
[HAPPY] So the people
who used to live here,

117
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,291
what do you figure
they were like?

118
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,500
[NATSU]
Hm...

119
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,833
I feel like there
were grown-ups,

120
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,208
and some had kids.

121
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,958
A few boys, a few girls.

122
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,875
They prob'ly had to work a lot,

123
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,666
but they also got to laugh
and play sometimes.

124
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,500
[HAPPY]
Well then,

125
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,458
that means they were
just like we are!

126
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:51,500
[NATSU, HAPPY screaming]

127
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,750
[HAPPY] So, I guess I
coulda caught ya, but--

128
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,416
[HAPPY yelps]

129
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,000
Wow. You're screwed.

130
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,791
[NATSU]
Huh? Ah!

131
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:06,208
Get off my face,
ya cranky little monsters!

132
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,458
Gah!

133
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,375
[screams]

134
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,583
[NATSU]
Come back here!

135
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:15,041
I'm injured! You gotta
nurse me to health!

136
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,708
[HAPPY]
Don't touch me, you freak!

137
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:19,291
[NATSU] You can't fly away
from me! I hatched you!

138
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,500
[HAPPY]
Hey. What's that?

139
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,916
[NATSU]
It looks like... an altar.

140
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,458
[HAPPY] Then this must be
Master Mavis' grave.

141
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,875
We really found it!

142
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,750
Of course we did! We're awesome.

143
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,500
Pretty sure we could've
been treasure hunters!

144
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,000
[NATSU]
Always liked you, Mavis.

145
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,083
I'll get way stronger
and make you proud.

146
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,500
[HAPPY] We're goin' on
a training mission,

147
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,833
so look after our friends
while we're gone, please.

148
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,750
Welp! We'll catch ya later, kay?

149
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,083
Bye!

150
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,333
[HAPPY] So if the first
Master was buried here,

151
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,666
d'ya think that means
this is where she's from?

152
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,708
[NATSU] No clue. We can ask
Gramps next time we see him.

153
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,916
You know, if we remember. Heh.

154
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,250
[HAPPY]
Yeah, but we're gonna forget.

155
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,625
[MAVIS] The story to come
takes place in a time

156
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,833
long before Happy and Natsu's.

157
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,500
A harsher time.

158
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,750
It's about a girl
with a silly dream,

159
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,375
fighting despair and anguish

160
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,708
with nothing but the
heart they stab at.

161
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,833
It's a tale of overcoming.
Of chasing hope.

162
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,416
Of friends who formed a guild.

163
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,208
So how'd that Bosco
job end up goin'?

164
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,541
Hardest part was the
boat ride, honestly.

165
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,666
Heard a few of those Blue Skull
wizards tried to mess with ya.

166
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,541
[WIZARD B]
Oh, they tried all right.

167
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,166
But let me tell ya,
they won't be tryin' again.


168
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,416
Lesson learned!


169
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,416
--[WIZARD A] Good work!
--[WIZARD C] Way to go!


170
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,791
[WIZARDS laughing]


171
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:36,916
[gasps]

172
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,750
And yet again, I find ya
slackin' on the job!


173
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,333
I'm sorry, sir!

174
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,791
It's just, I've already cleaned
the whole guildhall, so...

175
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:50,583
But ya haven't even touched
the sidewalk! Now have ya?

176
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,333
[MAVIS]
Why would I clean--?

177
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,125
[gasps]

178
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,166
[ZEESELF]
Don't talk back to me!

179
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,750
You've always been useless,

180
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,333
but these books have
got you actin' uppity.

181
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,791
Is this street rat seriously
hopin' to learn magic?

182
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,000
Never gonna happen!

183
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,166
She hasn't even
learned how to clean!

184
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,666
The floor or herself!
She smells like a barn!

185
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,291
[WIZARDS laughing]

186
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,791
One more thing, Mavis.

187
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:23,791
Those nice shoes, tell me,
who bought 'em for ya?

188
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,833
[MAVIS]
Well, you did, Master Zeeself.

189
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,208
That's correct.

190
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:31,250
But nice things really don't
suit you. Give 'em back.

191
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,458
Yes, sir.

192
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:35,750
It's just, these are
the only shoes I have.

193
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,125
What?

194
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,250
You better do what I say
or I'll throw your butt out

195
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,208
with the rest of the garbage!

196
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,125
[sighs]

197
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:58,500
[ZERA]
Daddy! I'm back from school!


198
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,625
Hey there, sweetheart!
Did you enjoy your classes?

199
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,708
School's stupid.
My teachers are so dumb!

200
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,458
Well, yeah, of course
they are compared to you!

201
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,458
Guess what! Daddy got
you some new shoes!

202
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:13,500
[ZERA] Eww, gross! I don't
want those nasty things!

203
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:16,208
[ZEESELF] Oh! No worries!
I'll just throw 'em away!

204
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,291
[ZERA] I hope these
weren't the orphan's.

205
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,500
I don't want her yucky
germs touching me.

206
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,208
[ZEESELF]
Oh, I'm sorry, darling.

207
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,541
[ZERA]
Just don't do it again.

208
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,083
[MAVIS]
I will not cry, no matter what.

209
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:31,583
'Cause if I do, I'll never
get to meet a fairy.

210
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:35,458
See, fairies don't
'sociate with crybabies.

211
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,333
I learned that from my parents.

212
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:41,458
They work for the
Red Lizard Guild too.

213
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:45,083
Or... they did at least.
Before they died.

214
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,500
I don't understand why
that had to happen,

215
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,166
but they're still
with me, in my heart.

216
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,708
Master Zeeself tells me that
they owed the guild money.

217
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,583
He's letting me work
for him, though.

218
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:59,083
So someday, I can
pay off their debt.

219
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,625
I'd like to do wizard
work once I get older,

220
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:05,083
but for now, it's just a lot of
sweeping and scrubbing.

221
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:08,000
It gets pretty hard
sometimes, but still,

222
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,875
I try to be grateful.

223
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,916
[roars]

224
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
[MAVIS] The Master gives
me a place to sleep

225
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,708
and scraps from the restaurant.

226
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,083
And we aren't even related!

227
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:21,333
Plus, I get nights to myself,
so if the moon's bright enough,

228
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,250
I can practice the math
and reading I learned

229
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,083
from Mommy and Daddy.

230
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,541
Aw, thank you!
You're so nice to me.

231
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:38,041
[MAVIS] So I will not cry,
no matter what.

232
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,541
Not until I meet my fairy.

233
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:44,916
And when I do, we're
gonna fly far, far away.

234
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,333
[grunts]

235
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,333
[gasps] Is that for school?

236
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,416
Yeah, it is.

237
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,000
Zera got a late start
this morning

238
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,375
and forgot to take her lunch.

239
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,250
Go bring it to her.

240
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,375
I'm going to school.

241
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,458
It's almost lunchtime now;
you're gonna have to be quick,

242
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,208
so you'll have to cut through
the forest to save time.

243
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,625
[MAVIS]
The forest?

244
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,791
Uh, sir, there are
monsters in there.

245
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,291
[growls]

246
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,708
This had better be the last
time I get any lip from you!

247
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,500
Stop your whining and do
as you're told, right now!

248
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,291
What are you more scared of,
the forest or me?

249
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,875
I'm sorry!

250
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,958
And I'd better not find out that
you dawdled on your way back.

251
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,541
I'll be keepin'
an eye on the time,

252
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,375
so don't you dare screw around.

253
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,541
[MAVIS]
Right!

254
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:45,166
[MAVIS] A real school!
With classes! And books!

255
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,666
And I get to see it!

256
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,416
[MEN laughing]

257
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,750
[MAVIS] I've never actually
gone to a school before,

258
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,875
but I've heard all about them.

259
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,833
Mommy and Daddy told me
that they have people

260
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,333
who teach for a living.

261
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,208
And there're huge shelves
piled with hundreds of books!

262
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:09,875
At a school, you can find out
anything you'd like to learn.

263
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:20,000
No dawdling. Hurry up!

264
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,833
[MAVIS] If I get there
before lunch starts,

265
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,916
I might get a peek at
everyone studying.

266
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,041
And if I'm really lucky,

267
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,416
I'll get to overhear
part of a lesson!

268
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,916
[screams]

269
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,125
[groans]

270
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:46,750
[MAVIS] At least the
lunch box didn't break.

271
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:47,916
Uh...

272
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,958
I'm really sorry,
please don't kill me!

273
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:57,916
[MAVIS]
Uh-oh. That run got me lost.

274
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,041
The tree rings are more
spaced out on one side.

275
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,583
That means it got the most
sunlight as it was growing.

276
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,791
This part of the planet tilts
away from the sun, so...

277
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:10,041
The big rings point south!

278
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,375
Sometimes you learn stuff

279
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,416
that doesn't seem
useful at the time,

280
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,708
but then it comes back to you
when you need it later,

281
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:19,125
or helps you understand
something else.

282
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,041
So I'll read just
about anything,

283
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:24,666
but my favorite books are about
people from across the world.

284
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:30,666
[MAVIS gasps]

285
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,750
Wait a second, I've read
about these lizards.

286
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,875
It was in some kind
of nature guide.

287
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,708
Hey, I remember!

288
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,708
Get outta here!

289
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:44,666
[MAVIS screams]

290
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,875
[MAVIS]
Whew. Guess the guide was right.

291
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,458
You are not a fan
of loud noises.

292
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,250
Sorry 'bout that.

293
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,083
Hi.

294
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:57,583
The scary lizard's gone
now. You okay, buddy?

295
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,916
I'm on my way to visit
a school. You wanna come?

296
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,208
[RAT squeaks]

297
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:09,125
[MAVIS] Wow. It's even
bigger than I thought.

298
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,458
[gasps]

299
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,666
[MAVIS]
A teacher!

300
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,958
Maybe if we're really, really
quiet, we'll hear her talk.

301
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,333
[MAN A]
Looking for something?

302
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,125
Pardon me, sir.

303
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:27,458
Zera forgot her lunch today.
I'm just here to drop it off.

304
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,791
[MAN A] Ah, you mean Master
Zeeself's daughter.

305
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,166
That building to the
left is the library.

306
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,083
She should be in there
till the end of the period.

307
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,875
Thank you very much!

308
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,750
[MAVIS]
Wow! All these books!

309
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,666
Where would you even start?

310
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,458
[ZERA]
Mavis?

311
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:46,958
Why are you here?

312
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:51,333
Umm. Master Zeeself asked me
to bring you your lunchbox.

313
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,375
You shoulda been
here sooner, dummy.

314
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:56,375
If I'd missed my lunch because
of you, Daddy'd be mad!

315
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:58,708
It's so cute!

316
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,625
I've never seen
anything like it.

317
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,333
So what is he, a pet?

318
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:05,333
A friend. We met in
the forest earlier.

319
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:06,833
[GIRL D]
His tail looks so fluffy!

320
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,458
[GIRL B]
Can I touch it?

321
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,291
[ZERA grunts]

322
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,791
[thud]

323
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,666
I got my lunch, now go
home and do some dishes.

324
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,250
This isn't a place
for servant girls,

325
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,500
so stop pretending
that you belong.

326
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:18,583
[MAVIS]
Right.

327
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:19,500
Could I--?

328
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,458
[ZERA]
I said get out of here!

329
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,458
Get moving, or else I'm
gonna tell on you to Daddy.

330
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:25,833
All right.

331
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:26,833
[GIRL A]
Was that mean?

332
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,166
Not really.

333
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,958
She's just a smelly brat
who lives off of my daddy.

334
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,583
None of you actually thought
she was normal, did you?

335
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:34,791
[GIRLS]
Uh.

336
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,708
I mean, yeah, she did
seem a little dirty.

337
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,416
She wasn't even wearing shoes.

338
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,083
No wonder the rat liked her.

339
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:43,333
[GIRLS chuckle nervously]

340
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,333
Hmph!

341
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,625
The school, it looked
fun, didn't it?

342
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,416
Hope I can go to school
for real someday.

343
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,958
I'd get books from the library.
Ask my teachers about 'em.

344
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,916
I could learn just
about anything.

345
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,291
[grunts]

346
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,916
Is that your Mom? I bet she
was worried about you.

347
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,875
Go! I'll be fine.

348
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,583
[MAVIS] It was a full
moon the night before,

349
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,833
so I stayed up studying.

350
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:35,125
That's probably why
I fell asleep so fast.

351
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,750
Oh, no! What time is it?

352
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,041
I'm gonna be in so much trouble.

353
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,041
[MAVIS]
Are those signal flares?

354
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,000
I wonder what they mean.

355
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:59,041
Bet there's a book in
that library that says.

356
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:06,208
That rumbling, it came
from the guild house!

357
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,916
[PEOPLE screaming]

358

[MAN E] We're under attack!
It's Blue Skull!

359
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,500
[MAN B] Defend yourselves!
Defend your homes!

360
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:22,833
[MAN C] Slaughter 'em, boys!
Leave none alive!

361
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,083
[MAVIS]
Conflict between wizard guilds

362
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:31,250
was a fairly common
occurrence in those days.

363
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,500
Despite its horrible costs,

364
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,958
war was the quickest way
for a guild to gain status

365
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,291
and remove competition.

366
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,041
Let's go!

367
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,833
[MAVIS] The aggressor in
this fight was Blue Skull.

368
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,625
They and Red Lizard
were old rivals.

369
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,208
This attack put an end to that.

370

[BLUE SKULL WIZARD A] Looks like
this is goodbye, Zeeself.

00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,458

00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,500
Oh, no! Master Zeeself.

[ZERA grunting]

Zera!

00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:15,958
Thanks, Mavis.

378
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,708
[MAVIS] Can you run? If we
stay here, they'll kill us.

379
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,791
Yeah, but--

380
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,666
[MAVIS]
C'mon! This way!

381
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,958
[ZERA]
Let go!

00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,333
You can leave without me!

383
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,583
I don't wanna run away
from home! I like it there!

384
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,208
It's where Daddy is.
And the guild.

385
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:35,000
And all my friends from school
and my favorite outfits, too!

Those things aren't gone yet!

You can keep them in
your heart, like I do!

00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,958
[MAVIS] Everything that you
just lost, I used to have.

389
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,375
And I still do.

390
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:48,166
They'll never be gone while
you remember them, okay?

391
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:52,000
But for us to remember,
we have to stay alive!

392
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,291
[ZERA] I've always
been so mean to you...

Why're you helping me?

394
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:59,541
[MAVIS] 'Cause you're a person.

Mavis, do you think...

00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,083
...you and me could be friends?

00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,583
Of course we could.

Get up.

[MAVIS wails]

406
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,916
[MAVIS] After the way
I cried that night,

407
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'll probably never
meet a fairy.

408
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:44,041
The next day, I went
back to the village.

409
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,666
Mostly I found ash.

410
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,291
Blue Skull had killed
everyone, wizard or not.

411
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,916
No one who stayed there
survived. Not a soul.

412
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,416
In the year 679,

413
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:01,208
Tenrou Island was seemingly
wiped of all human presence.

414
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:05,333
And that's how it would stay
for seven long years.

415
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:08,041
[WARROD]
So this is Tenrou Island, eh?

416
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:09,208
Nice and humid.


417
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:11,791
Remind me to come here
next winter, okay?


418
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,000
[PRECHT sighs]


419
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,833
[PRECHT] Do try to take
this task seriously.


420
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,291
Will you, Warrod?


421
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,750
[WARROD] Come on, you know
I take everything seriously!

422
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,583
Land ho!

423
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,458
[WARROD]
Why did we bring this guy?

424
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:25,041
[YURI]
This is gonna be awesome!

425
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:27,666
My treasure senses
are tinglin' all over!


426
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,208
Come on, you two!
Let's nab that Tenrou Orb!


427
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:33,916
[MAVIS]
On this day in 686,

428
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,833
destiny set countless
things in motion.

429
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:39,291
One of those things
was this story.

430
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:42,375
The story of Fairy
Tail's origin.

431
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:15,291
[MAVIS] After the attack
on Tenrou Island,

432
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:18,000
Zera and I were left with
nothing but books and animals

433
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,416
to keep us company.

434
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,041
Still, we always
made the best of it.

435
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:25,416
Seven years passed before
our isolation was interrupted

436
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,333
by a group of treasure hunters.

437
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:28,833
I couldn't have guessed
what the results

438
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:30,291
of that meeting would be.

439
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:32,750
It set me on a course
I'd only dreamed of.

440
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:35,625
But it also brought me that
much closer to my fate.

441
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:38,791
Next time:
"The Adventure Begins."

442
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:41,625
The door to our journey
has just been opened.
