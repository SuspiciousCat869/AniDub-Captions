1
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:20,458
- Natsu:
PREVIOUSLY ON "FAIRY TAIL"...

2
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:21,583
- Lucy: I'M SO GLAD THAT
THE BATTLE OF FAIRY TAIL

3
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,000
IS FINALLY OVER.

4
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:24,250
- Happy: AND EVERYONE
HAD A GREAT TIME

5
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,666
AT THE FANTASIA PARADE.

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,666
IT WAS AWESOME!
- Lucy: EVERYONE BUT LAXUS.

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,291
MASTER EXPELLED HIM
FROM THE GUILD.

8
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,500
- Natsu: MAN!
IT'S JUST NOT FAIR.

9
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:32,666
- Happy: YEAH, HE'S RIGHT.

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,916
YOU HAVE HORRIBLE LUCK
WITH BOYS, LUCY.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,250
- Lucy: WHAT?!
THAT CAME OUTTA NOWHERE.

12
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,916
WHY'D YOU HAVE TO
BRING THAT UP?

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,916
- ( theme music playing )

14
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,416
- ( singing in Japanese )

15
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,875
- Lucy: THE HARVEST FESTIVAL
ENDED A WEEK AGO.

16
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:16,291
AND IT FEELS LIKE MAGNOLIA
IS FINALLY

17
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:19,041
STARTING TO GET BACK
TO NORMAL AGAIN.

18
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,583
NO ONE REALLY EXPECTED LAXUS

19
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,791
TO GET KICKED OUT OF
THE GUILD, THOUGH.

20
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,000
WHEN WORD GOT OUT,
EVERYONE REACTED

21
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,125
TO THE NEWS
IN THEIR OWN WAY.

22
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:31,375
OF COURSE, NATSU THREW 
A GIANT TEMPER TANTRUM.

23
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,291
- WHY'D YOU KICK HIM OUT,
GRAMPS?!

24
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,041
COULDN'T YOU JUST SEND HIM
TO HIS ROOM OR SOMETHING?!

25
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,250
- ( Happy speaking )

26
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,083
- I THOUGHT HE WAS PART
OF OUR FAMILY!

27
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,250
WE ALL KNOW HE'S A JERK,
BUT COME ON!

28
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,875
- THAT IS QUITE ENOUGH.
- ( groans )

29
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,833
BUT NOW THAT HE'S GONE,
I MAY NEVER GET THE CHANCE

30
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:52,958
TO FIGHT HIM AGAIN, GRAMPS!

31
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,458
I JUST KNOW I'D BE STRONG ENOUGH
TO BEAT HIM NEXT TIME!

32
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,041
- I SAID ENOUGH!

33
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,083
IMAGINE HOW THE MASTER
MUST BE FEELING RIGHT NOW.

34
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,208
DO YOU THINK HE EXPELLED LAXUS
BECAUSE HE WANTED TO?

35
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,666
- NO, BUT-- 

36
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,666
- I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
HE ENDED UP BEING

37
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,500
A DRAGON SLAYER
JUST LIKE YOU! 

38
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:14,916
- NO, LAXUS WAS NEVER
A REAL DRAGON SLAYER.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,500
- ( all gasp )

40
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,291
- AND THEN...!

41
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,583
- Lucy: WELL, EVERYBODY WAS
SHOCKED TO HEAR THAT.

42
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,250
MASTER SAID THAT GROWING UP,

43
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:26,125
LAXUS HAD ALWAYS BEEN A FRAIL
AND SICKLY LITTLE BOY.

44
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:29,250
SO HIS FATHER, IVAN, HAD A
LACRIMA IMPLANTED INTO HIS BODY

45
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:32,125
THAT GAVE HIM THE ABILITY TO
USE DRAGON SLAYER MAGIC.

46
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,666
WHAT KIND OF PARENT
WOULD DO THAT?

47
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,250
- I'M SORRY.

48
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,291
- WOW, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT EXISTED.

49
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,750
DRAGON SLAYER LACRIMA?

50
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,375
- ( sighs )

51
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,041
- ( sighs )

52
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,000
- ( straining )

53
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,750
- Lucy: TO ATONE FOR THE TROUBLE
HIS GRANDSON CAUSED US,

54
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,958
MASTER SAID HE WOULD RELINQUISH
HIS TITLE AS HEAD OF THE GUILD.

55
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,750
WE TRIED REALLY HARD
TO TALK HIM OUT OF IT.

56
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:01,125
- MASTER, PLEASE DO NOT COMPOUND
THE PAIN OF LAXUS' PUNISHMENT.

57
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:04,541
IT WOULD BREAK HIS HEART EVEN
FURTHER IF YOU WERE TO RESIGN.

58
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,166
- EH... MM.

59
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,625
- Lucy: FRIED CUT HIS HAIR
TO SHOW HIS REPENTANCE.

60
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,166
HE'S SO OLD-FASHIONED.

61
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,208
BUT WITH THAT GESTURE
AND THOSE FEW WORDS, 

62
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,625
HE TALKED THE MASTER
INTO STAYING.

63
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:18,833
AND HE WASN'T THE ONLY ONE
IN THE THUNDER LEGION

64
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,833
WHO STARTED TO OPEN UP
TO THE REST OF THE GUILD

65
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,791
AFTER WHAT WENT DOWN.

66
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:26,000
- WITH YOUR ARTISTIC TALENT,
I'LL GLADLY BE YOUR MUSE.

67
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,000
BUT DON'T GO GETTING
ANY FUNNY IDEAS.

68
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,708
I DON'T DO NUDES, OKAY?

69
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,583
- UH, <i>OUI.</i>

70
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:32,916
- SO, HOW'S THIS POSE?

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,166
OR DO YOU LIKE THIS BETTER?

72
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,791
JUST HURRY,
AND START PAINTING!

73
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,166
- SO, ARE YOU
AND LOKE GOING OUT?

74
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,208
- Tommen:
ARE YOU, ARE YOU?  TELL US.

75
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,916
- Happy:
THEY'RE IN LOVE.

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,125
- UH, NO.
- ( Happy giggles )

77
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,500
- LUCY AND LOKE...

78
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:46,583
- Tommen:
...SITTING IN A TREE.

79
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,583
- K-I-S-S-I-N-G.
- ( sighs )

80
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,375
BUT THE ONE THING
THAT HASN'T CHANGED,

81
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:54,000
IS THAT I STILL HAVE TO DEAL
WITH A BUNCH OF WEIRDOES.

82
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,750
- ( chuckles )

83
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,250
- I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE

84
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,250
THAT EVER SINCE
THE HARVEST FESTIVAL ENDED,

85
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,041
ERZA'S BEEN SPENDING
A LOT OF TIME BY HERSELF.

86
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,333
- MASTER...

87
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,750
TELL ME ABOUT MYSTOGAN.
WHO IS HE?

88
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,958
- TO THINK HE WOULD BEAR
SUCH A RESEMBLANCE

89
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,166
TO SOMEONE FROM YOUR PAST...

90
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,166
I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW
ANYMORE ABOUT HIM THAN YOU DO.

91
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,458
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN
THE SILENT TYPE.

92
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,333
- JELLAL...

93
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,916
- ( birds chirping )

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,333
- Lucy: AND ALL OF THAT
JUST WENT DOWN IN THE PAST WEEK.

95
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,958
IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT,
BUT THAT'S NOTHING COMPARED TO

96
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,333
THE PROBLEM
I'M DEALING WITH NOW.

97
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:42,666
- ( all cheering, chattering )

98
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,291
- Warren: SHE IS A BEAUTY.

99
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,750
- Droy: LUCY CAME IN SECOND?

100
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:46,750
- AND JUVIA'S THIRD!

101
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,500
- CONGRATULATIONS, LADIES!

102
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,916
- AW, THERE GOES
MY RENT MONEY!

103
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,916
( sobs )

104
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,541
- YOU CAN TAKE A JOB.

105
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,916
- BUT WINNING THE PAGEANT

106
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,708
WOULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH EASIER.

107
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,708
( crying )

108
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,333
WHAT AM I GONNA DO NOW?

109
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:06,166
- UH, I REALLY NEED A MAN.

110
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,375
- WHAT THE HECK?
A MAN?

111
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,791
- I NEED, WELL, A BOYFRIEND.

112
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,416
I'VE BEEN SINGLE FOR TOO LONG,

113
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,875
AND I'M STARTING TO GET THE
URGE, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

114
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,083
- UH--

115
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,250
- OH, WHY DID THAT
MAKE YOU BLUSH, LUCY?

116
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,666
- OH, UH, I'M NOT BLUSHING.

117
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,291
- ( chuckles )
COME ON, BLONDIE.

118
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,125
YOU'VE HAD
BOYFRIENDS BEFORE, RIGHT?

119
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,291
- YEAH, I'VE HAD,
LIKE, THREE.

120
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,125
- THREE?
YOU'RE SO LYING.

121
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,583
- EH...

122
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:34,000
- HAVEN'T YOU EVER WANTED
TO DATE ANYBODY?

123
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,291
- WELL, YEAH,
I'VE HAD CRUSHES...

124
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,416
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

125
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,666
( sighs )

126
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,583
I SUPPOSE IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE.

127
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:46,000
- HEY, LISTEN UP, EVERYONE!
YOU'LL LOVE THIS!

128
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,208
THE SECOND-CUTEST GIRL
IN FAIRY TAIL

129
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,750
JUST TOLD ME THAT
SHE'S NEVER HAD A BOYFRIEND!

130
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,083
- ( laughs nervously )

131
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,083
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.
- UH--

132
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,291
- YOU SEE, THE CARDS
HAVE SPOKEN TO ME.

133
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,750
APPARENTLY,
YOU'RE DESTINED TO HAVE

134
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,500
A FATEFUL ENCOUNTER TODAY.

135
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,291
- WAIT, I WILL?

136
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,291
TODAY?

137
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,000
UH...

138
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,708
HEY, ERZA.
WHAT'S WITH THE FANCY GETUP?

139
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,708
- I DON'T HAVE TIME TO TALK.

140
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,333
I HAVE TO GO
AND PUT MY MAKEUP ON.

141
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,333
- HUH? 
- UH...

142
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,166
- ( plays chord )

143
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,333
- EH... OKAY?

144
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,583
WONDER WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THOSE TWO TODAY.

145
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,208
- ( giggles )

146
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,666
YOU DIDN'T HEAR THE NEWS?

147
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,625
A REPORTER FROM
"SORCERER WEEKLY" MAGAZINE

148
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,833
IS COMING TO THE GUILD LATER
TO DO AN INTERVIEW.

149
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,000
- AAH!

150
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,208
- Narrator: "SORCERER WEEKLY" IS
A WIDELY CIRCULATED PUBLICATION

151
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,375
THAT HITS THE NEWSSTANDS
EVERY WEDNESDAY.

152
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,625
IT FEATURES HOT NEW SPELLS,

153
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,291

154
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,541
IT IS THE PREMIERE

155
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,958
- AN INTERVIEW?! 
WITH "SORCERER"?!

156
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,916

00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,208
- COVER STORY!  INTERVIEW!
REPORTER!

159
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,625
FATEFUL ENCOUNTER!
( gasps )

160
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,791
OH, MY GOSH!

161
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,583
SO THIS REPORTER
COMES TO FAIRY TAIL,

162
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,833
AND HE GETS BLOWN AWAY
BE MY STUNNING GOOD LOOKS.

163
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,458
HE SAYS, "OH, LUCY,
BEAUTY LIKE YOURS

164
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,500
MUST BE SHARED
WITH THE WORLD!"

165
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:09,333
AND I'LL FINALLY GET MY CHANCE
TO BE THE WEEKLY CENTERFOLD!

166
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,708
THIS IS THE FATEFUL ENCOUNTER
SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT!

167
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,625
"LUCY, MY DARLING,
YOU'RE SO FASCINATING.

168
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,416
I WANT TO INTERVIEW YOU
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!"

169
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,791
WHAT'S MORE, IF I GET
THE MODELING FEE I DESERVE,

170
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,416
I'LL ACTUALLY BE ABLE
TO PAY MY RENT THIS MONTH.

171
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,416
WAY TO KILL TWO BIRDS
WITH ONE GIANT STONE!

172
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,875
OH, YEAH!

173
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,875
( chuckles )

174
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,875
THIS IS MY BREAK.
MY BIG BREAK!

175
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,041
- ( Mira sighs )
- ( Lucy cackles )

176
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,458
- WOW, LUCY FINALLY SNAPPED,
HUH?

177
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,750
- SHE'S PROBABLY JUST GOT
A BAD CASE OF GAS OR SOMETHING.

178
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,166
- COME ON, MAN.
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY FREAKED OUT

179
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,791
'CAUSE HER RENT'S DUE AGAIN,
AND SHE'S COMPLETELY BROKE.

180
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:47,000
- I'M WASTING PRECIOUS TIME!
- HMM?

181
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:52,000
- BA-DA-DA-BOP, SNIP.
BA-DA-DA, SNIP-SNIP, AH!

182
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,208
YOU ARE LOOKING COOL, BABY.

183
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:57,291
- YEAH... MM.

184
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,041
- YOU NOT DOWN WITH
THIS STYLE, BABY?

185
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:03,666
- WELL, IT'S JUST-- MAYBE IT
COULD BE A LITTLE EDGIER?

186
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,500
OR-- I DON'T KNOW.

187
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,916
- YOU AIN'T PICKING UP
WHAT I'M LAYING DOWN, BABY?

188
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,458
- I LIKE IT,
BUT, UH...

189
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,541
- GUESS I GOTTA SPLIT
AND FIND MY MOJO.

190
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,458
- DON'T BE SO DRAMATIC!

191
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,958
OH, I KNOW.

192
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,208
I'LL GO OUT AND GET
SOME HAIR MAGAZINES

193
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,500
FROM THE BOOKSTORE.

194
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:21,875
THEN WE CAN GIVE IT
ANOTHER SHOT.

195
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,875
- ( door opens, closes )

196
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:25,833
- CHICKS...

197
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,625
- HMM...

198
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,125
HMM.

199
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,000
A FATEFUL ENCOUNTER, HUH?

200
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,708
WELL, IF SHE'S RIGHT, THEN
AS SOON AS I REACH FOR A BOOK,

201
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,583
HE'LL REACH FOR THE SAME ONE.

202
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,416
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS, RIGHT?

203
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,625
WELL, HERE GOES NOTHING.

204
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,541
UH--
- HUH?

205
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,291
- OH, TAKE IT.

206
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,875
- NO, PLEASE.
IT'S YOURS.

207
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,166
- BUT---

208
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,916
AW!
- Narrator: FATEFUL ENCOUNTER?

209
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,500
- ( gasps )

210
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,333
NO, I INSIST!
ENJOY!

211
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,291
- HOLD ON.

212
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,375
- WHOA, THAT WAS CLOSE.

213
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,250
I GOTTA GET
OUTTA HERE QUICK.

214
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,375
I CAN'T WASTE MY BIG CHANCE
ON SOME RANDOM GUY LIKE THAT.

215
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,208
I'VE GOTTA SAVE IT FOR LATER.

216
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,750
I'M GONNA NEED ALL THE LUCK
I CAN GET.

217
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,541
- PLEASE!  WAIT A SECOND.

218
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,791
- AAH!

219
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,083
- HEY.  DO YOU LIVE HERE
IN TOWN?

220
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,500
- YEAH.

221
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:28,916
- IF IT'S NOT
TOO MUCH TROUBLE,

222
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,625
COULD YOU SHOW ME
AROUND A BIT?

223
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:31,916
- YOU WANNA SEE MAGNOLIA?

224
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,875
- YOU SEE, I'M WORKING ON
A NOVEL,

225
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,458
AND I'M TRYING
TO GATHER MATERIAL.

226
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,791
- A NOVEL?

227
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,291
- YEAH, I FOUND THAT WHEN
I TRAVEL AROUND

228
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,666
SEEING THE COUNTRY,

229
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,250
I'M INSPIRED IN A WAY THAT I
NEVER COULD BE AT HOME.

230
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,833
- THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

231
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,708
YOU NEED LIFE EXPERIENCE
BEFORE PUTTING PEN TO PAPER.

232
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,041
- EXACTLY.
ARE YOU A WRITER TOO?

233
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:54,666
- OH... MORE LIKE
A WANNABE.

234
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,666
- HUH.

235
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,208
WELL, LISTEN,

236
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,208
SHOW ME AROUND TOWN,
AND I'LL LET YOU

237
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,875
HAVE THIS BOOK AS A GIFT.
HOW'S THAT SOUND?

238
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,416
IS IT A WORTHWHILE TRADE
FOR YOUR TIME?

239
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,583
- SORRY.
TODAY'S NO GOOD FOR ME.

240
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,750
I'M SUPER BUSY.
- I SEE.

241
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:12,041
WELL, IT WAS WORTH A TRY.
- I GOTTA RUN.

242
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,666
- ( inaudible )

243
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,208
- DON'T TELL ME--

244
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:19,083
CANA'S PREDICTION WAS ABOUT
ME MEETING THAT GUY?

245
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,833
- HEY, I DIDN'T MISS
THE INTERVIEW GUY, DID I?

246
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,666
UH.  OH, MAN.

247
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,666
I TOTALLY FORGOT
TO PICK UP HAIR MAGAZINES.

248
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,708
AND I CAME TO THE GUILD HALL
WHEN I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO HOME.

249
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,791
- WHOA!  IS THAT TITANIA?!
- HUH?

250
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,875
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
 IT'S REALLY YOU!

251
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,083
THIS IS SO COOL!

252
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:04,333
I AM SUCH A FAN!
WHOO!

253
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,333
COOL!  COOL!
- UH...

254
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,208
SO WHO'S THE WEIRDO
WITH THE CAMERA?

255
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:11,666
- GIRLS, MEET JASON.
FROM "SORCERER WEEKLY."

256
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,166
- BUT THIS OUTFIT
ISN'T ANYTHING SPECIAL.

257
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,083
THE DRESS I HAD ON WAS CUTER.

258
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,875
- NO, YOU LOOK PERFECT!

259
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,791
I WAS HOPING TO CAPTURE YOU
IN YOUR NATURAL ELEMENT.

260
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,750
MAN, THIS IS SO COOL!
OH, WOW...

261
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,000
- NOPE, HE'S NOT THE ONE.

262
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,875
I HOPE.

263
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,708
( exhales )
BUT HE IS THE ONE

264
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,291
WHO CAN GET ME A MODELING GIG
AT "SORCERER WEEKLY."

265
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,333
- VERY CUTE!

266
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,291
- HELLO THERE,
MR. REPORTER MAN.

267
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,666
I'M ERZA'S TEAMMATE, LUCY.

268
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,083
- OOH OOH OOH! DO YOU HAVE
TIME FOR A QUICK INTERVIEW?

269
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,750
- I SUPPOSE SO.
- DISSED!

270
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,166
- OUR READERS
WOULD LOVE TO KNOW

271
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,291
HOW MANY DIFFERENT REQUIPS
YOU COULD DO.

272
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,708
- WELL OVER 100.

273
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,625
- WHOA!

274
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,500
AND WHICH ONE OF THEM
IS YOUR FAVORITE?

275
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,625
- I'M QUITE FOND
OF THE BUNNY GIRL.

276
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:56,958
- BUNNY?!

277
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:00,791
- THE EARS ARE
SIMPLY ADORABLE.

278
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,250
- YEAH!
( laughs )

279
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,208
AND WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE FOOD?

280
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:10,000
- I'D SAY IT'S A TIE
BETWEEN CHEESECAKE AND SOUFFLE.

281
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:13,000
- WHAT GIVES? THE ONE TIME
FAIRY TAIL GETS GOOD COVERAGE,

282
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,791
AND I MIGHT AS WELL
BE INVISIBLE.

283
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,291
- ( snickers )

284
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,916
- HEY, YOU'RE IN
THE SAME BOAT AS ME, CAT!

285
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,583
- SO, HAPPY, WHY EXACTLY
ARE YOU BLUE?

286
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,958
- BECAUSE I'M A CAT.
- AW, THIS SUCKS!

287
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,583
- OH.
- ( sighs )

288
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,166
- HMM...

289
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,791
- JEEZ, THIS GUY
IS NOT MY TYPE AT ALL.

290
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:37,541
WHAT IF HE REALLY IS THE ONE
CANA PREDICTED I'D MEET?

291
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:40,500
- HOLY COW!  IT'S THE AMAZING
ICE WIZARD GRAY!

292
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,041
- WHAT THE HECK?!

293
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,166
- YEAH, WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- ( whistle tweets )

294
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,958
- IS HE FROM
"SORCERER WEEKLY" MAGAZINE?

295
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,166
- AND I'M IN LUCK!
HE'S WITH JUVIA.

296
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,750
COOL!

297
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,416
SO, GRAY, WHY DO YOU TAKE
YOUR CLOTHES OFF ALL THE TIME?

298
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,041
- THAT'S NOT TRUE!
I NEVER DO THAT!

299
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:59,083
- YOU'RE IN YOUR
UNDERWEAR RIGHT NOW!

300
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,250
- WOW, IT IS SO HOT.

301
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,375
MAYBE I SHOULD START
STRIPPING DOWN TOO.

302
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:06,000
- ( shouts )

303
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:09,375
YOU'RE THE REPORTER, HUH?!
- Lucy: AAH!

304
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,958
- YEAH!  THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

305
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,208
NATSU THE SALAMANDER
IS THE PERSON

306
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,833
I WANTED TO MEET MOST OF ALL.

307
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,291
THIS IS JUST 
WAY TOO COOL!

308
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,750
- OH, CHILL OUT, MAN.

309
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,458
- YOU JERK!
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S

310
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,083
ALWAYS WRITING
THAT BAD STUFF ABOUT ME!

311
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,791
- OH, YEAH!

312
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,791
- ALL YOU EVER WRITE ABOUT
IS HOW I BLEW UP THIS THING,

313
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,458
OR DEMOLISHED THAT THING!

314
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:30,083
- THIS IS SO COOL.
NATSU... IN THE FLESH.

315
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,791
THE SALAMANDER.

316
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,958
COULD I SHAKE YOUR HAND, SIR?

317
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,583
- ( groans )
NO WAY!

318
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,166
- AAH!

319
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,000
OH, MAN, THAT'S AWESOME!
NATSU IS SUCH A HERO.

320
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,208
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE HE EVEN
SHOWED ME HIS SECRET HANDSHAKE.

321
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,708
- WHAT A PRO.

322
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,750
- SO, ELFMAN, I ASKED YOU
WHAT MAKES A REAL MAN,

323
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,791
AND YOU SAID,
"A REAL MAN."

324
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:58,000
( laughs )
COOL!

325
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,625
SO, TELL ME, TEAM SHADOW GEAR,

326
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,625
IS IT TRUE YOU THREE
ARE IN A LOVE TRIANGLE?

327
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,666
NO COMMENT?
WHAT A SCOOP!

328
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,166
THIS IS AMAZING!

329
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,291
HEY, CANA, WHY HAVEN'T YOU
POSED FOR OUR MAG YET?

330
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,833
- WHY DON'T YOU SIT DOWN
AND GRAB YOURSELF A DRINK?

331
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:15,333
OKAY, I MAY BE LONELY, BUT I
NEVER SAID I WAS DESPERATE.

332
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,708
- MASTER, YOUR PLANS
FOR THE GUILD?

333
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,125
- YEAH, WELL WE...

334
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,833
WILL CONTINUE SPREADING
JUSTICE AND GOODWILL

335
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,625
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.
- THAT'S SO FAKE!

336
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,500
- HAS THE THUNDER LEGION
DISBANDED?

337
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,500
- NO.
- NOT ON YOUR LIFE, BUDDY!

338
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,916
- IN FACT, WE'RE STRONGER
THAN EVER.

339
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,583
- I LOVE YOUR NEW LOOK, LAKI.

340
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,333
- JUST WATCH, I'LL BE
MISS FAIRY TAIL NEXT YEAR.

341
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,333
- WHOA, AM I GLAD
TO SEE YOU TWO AGAIN.

342
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,458
- YOU'VE GROWN SINCE
THE LAST TIME WE SAW YOU.

343
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,291
- BE SURE TO GET
MY GOOD SIDE, OKAY?

344
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,791
- OF, COURSE, SIR...
- HE'S EVEN SHOOTING THOSE GUYS?

345
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:47,000
OH! WHAT AM I GONNA HAVE TO DO
TO GET NOTICED BY THIS LOSER?

346
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:50,000
I'VE GOT NO OTHER CHOICE.
I'LL HAVE TO SWALLOW MY PRIDE

347
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,166
AND PULL OUT 
THE BIG GUNS.

348
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,333
LISTEN UP, EVERYBODY!

349
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,250
I'D LIKE TO SING A
LITTLE NUMBER FOR YOU.

350
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,166
- SHE'S A BUNNY GIRL?!

351
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,666
- OW!
- I GOT THIS, BLONDIE!

352
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,875
- ( plays chord )
- SHOO-BEE-DOO-BA! 

353
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,541
- All: GAJEEL!

354
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,916
- OH, NOT AGAIN!

355
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,916
- ( exhales )

356
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,666
- YEAH!  AWESOME!

357
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,583
THAT'S BLACK STEEL GAJEEL.

358
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,750
COOL!

359
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:14,166
- ( plays somber riff )

360
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,416
- DOING THE RIGHT THING 
AIN'T ALWAYS THAT SMART.

361
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,375
BUT LUCKY FOR YOU,
YOU JUST AIN'T THAT SMART.

362
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,000
- ( plays chord ) 
- YOU DIG ME, MAN?

363
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:28,416
THAT MEANS YOU ALWAYS DO RIGHT.

364
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,583
NOW LISTEN CLOSE TO ME,
BROTHER.

365
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,375
'CAUSE IT'S COMING
FROM THE SOUL.

366
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,208
- OH, YEAH!
I COULD TOTALLY DIG IT.

367
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,666
- WOULD YOU SHUT UP?!

368
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,750
- YOU LITTLE...

369
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,916
- I WAS MAD ENOUGH
AT THIS JERK HERE,

370
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,791
BUT THAT SONG OF YOURS
SENT ME OVER THE EDGE.

371
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,416
- I GOT A SONG
IN MY HEART, SALAMANDER.

372
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,166
AND YOU AIN'T STOPPING IT
FROM COMING OUT!

373
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,041
- OH, YEAH?!

374
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,916
- ( both grunting )

375
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,708
- CUT IT OUT, YOU GUYS.

376
00:16:58,791 --> 00:16:59,875
THE PRESS IS STILL HERE.

377
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,708
- ( cheers )

378
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,875
FAIRY TAIL'S TWO DRAGON SLAYERS
ARE BRUTALLY SLUGGING IT OUT

379
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,416
RIGHT BEFORE MY VERY EYES.

380
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
THIS IS GONNA BE THE MOST
AWESOME PHOTO SPREAD

381
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,208
IN "SORCERER WEEKLY"
HISTORY!

382
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,750
- ( camera shutter clicking )

383
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,916
- YES.  AWESOME.
KILLER!

384
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,416
- ( both shout )

385
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,541
- ( laughs maniacally )

386
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,583
AAH!

387
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,000
OH, MAN.
IT'S HARD-HITTING.

388
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:29,333
IN DEPTH...
SO COOL.

389
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,000
- BIG TIME PRO.

390
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,333
- WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.

391
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,333
HUH?

392
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,208
- ( chuckles )

393
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,625
- ( chuckles )
IF IT'S NOT TOO LATE,

394
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,708
I'D BE HAPPY TO GIVE
A FELLOW NOVELIST A TOUR.

395
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,083
- WELL, I'M NOT A NOVELIST
QUITE YET,

396
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,625
BUT I AM WORKING ON SOMETHING.

397
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,625
- ( laughs ) 
JUST LIKE ME.

398
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,083
- ( laughs )

399
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,125
- ( both laugh )

400
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,416
- WHOA, WHAT'S WITH THAT
CREEPY FACE YOU'RE MAKING?

401
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,375
- IT'S WEIRD.
- UH--

402
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,375
YOU GOT SOME KIND
OF PROBLEM WITH MY FACE?!

403
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,375
- GUESS WHAT.
I GOT US A JOB.

404
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,583
- WE'VE GOTTA MEET UP
WITH A CLIENT FIRST THING

405
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,291
IN THE MORNING, SO WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO HOP ON

406
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,541
THE LAST TRAIN TONIGHT.

407
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,541
- LIKE RIGHT NOW?
GO WITHOUT ME.

408
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,208
- BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE
ALL STRESSED OUT

409
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,000
ABOUT NEEDING MONEY TO
MAKE RENT THIS MONTH.

410
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,833
- IT'S JUST NOT
A GOOD TIME FOR ME.

411
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,291
SORRY.

412
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,750
- HOW ABOUT THE TWO OF US

413
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,541
GO AND GRAB SOME DINNER LATER?

414
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,333
I'D LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT
THE NOVEL YOU'RE WORKING ON.

415
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,875
- I'M GOING OUT
ON A DATE TONIGHT.

416
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,958
- OKAY...
- ( sadly ) AYE...

417
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,583
- JEEZ, JUST BECAUSE
I'M NOT GOING,

418
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,083
DOESN'T MEAN
IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD.

419
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,291
SO DRAMATIC.
WHAT GIVES? 

420
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,708
- THEY'RE SO CUTE.

421
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,125
RIGHT AFTER THE REPORTER
LEFT TODAY,

422
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,333
THEY STARTED GETTING
REALLY EXCITED ABOUT

423
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,833
GOING OUT ON A JOB WITH YOU.

424
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:29,125
- OH, YEAH?
BUT HOW COME?

425
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,166
- I DON'T KNOW.

426
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,791
ALL THEY SAID IS THEY FOUND A
JOB THAT WASN'T WORTH VERY MUCH,

427
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,458
BUT IT WOULD BE PERFECT
FOR YOU.

428
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:03,000
- OH, WELL, GUESS LUCY 
ISN'T COMING AFTER ALL.

429
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,750
- ( footsteps approaching )

430
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,458
- UH--
( chuckles )

431
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,000
- YEP, I FIGURED
SHE WOULDN'T SHOW UP.

432
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,333
- ( grunts )

433
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,625
- ( footsteps approaching )

434
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:40,833
- YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT ME?

435
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:41,833
- Natsu and Happy:
HUH?

436
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,458
- HERE FOR DUTY!

437
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,541
- LUCY!

438
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,791
- WHAT HAPPENED?  I THOUGHT
YOU HAD A DATE TONIGHT.

439
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,625
- YEAH, WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME ABOUT THIS JOB

440
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:53,791
THAT'S PERFECT FOR ME?

441
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,916
- IT'LL PAY YOUR RENT
EXACTLY-- 70,000.

442
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,291
- UH--

443
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,041
- THAT IS WHAT YOU PAY
FOR RENT EACH MONTH, RIGHT?

444
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:03,083
SO YOU SHOULD BE SET FOR
THE NEXT THREE MONTHS.

445
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,083
- NO.
BUT IT'LL LAST ONE MONTH.

446
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,750
THAT'S WHY I SAID "EXACTLY."

447
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:10,375
- BUT WAIT A SECOND.
WHAT ABOUT THE TWO OF YOU?

448
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,333
- WE CAN'T AFFORD FOR YOU
TO LOSE YOUR PLACE

449
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,333
'CAUSE THEN WE'D HAVE TO FIND
SOMEWHERE ELSE TO WORK OUT.

450
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,416
- AYE!

451
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,250
- OH, I GET IT NOW.

452
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,916
( chuckles softly )

453
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,625
THANK YOU, GUYS.

454
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,041
I MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE.

455
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:26,041
I'M GLAD I DECIDED
TO COME ALONG WITH THEM.

456
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,750
BECAUSE WHEN ALL IS SAID
AND DONE,

457
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,916
MY FAIRY TAIL FRIENDS
ARE WHAT MATTER MOST TO ME.

458
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
BESIDES, THAT GUY
WAS REALLY NICE, 

459
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,083
BUT HE WASN'T THE ONE.

460
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,750
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?
YOU WAITING FOR SOMEBODY?

461
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,833
- UH...

462
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,666
- ( chuckles )

463
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,916
LUCY COULDN'T HANDLE HIM.
SHE'S TOO NAIVE.

464
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,083
HE NEEDS A GIRL 
WITH EXPERIENCE.

465
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,541
- ( exhales )

466
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,583
WHOA!
YOU'RE TOTALLY MY TYPE!

467
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,458
- NOT AGAIN, NATSU!

BUT TO GET
IN ON THE ACTION. AM I RIGHT?
