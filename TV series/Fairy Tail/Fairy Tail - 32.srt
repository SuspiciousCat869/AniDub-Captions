1
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,916
- HEY GUYS! READY FOR
SOME MORE FAIRY TAIL?

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,666
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING

3
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,458
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS
ON IN THE ROOM

4
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:26,666
AND DON'T SIT TOO
CLOSE TO THE TV!

5
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,958
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

6
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:36,208
YOU HAD A CONTRACT
AND YOU KILLED HER?

7
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,708
- MMM-HMM.

8
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:40,375
AND SPIRITS WHO KILL THEIR
WIZARDS ARE FOREVER BANISHED

9
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,666
FROM THE CELESTIAL WORLD.

10
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,125
SO I'M JUST GONNA
DISAPPEAR RIGHT HERE,

11
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,333
IN FRONT OF HER GRAVE.

12
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:49,833
- LOKE.

13
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,875
- Loke: IT WAS ABOUT
THREE YEARS AGO.

14
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,791
- Karen: I'M SORRY BOYS.

15
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,500
I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT AT
THE SALON THIS AFTERNOON.

16
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:35,083
WHY DON'T YOU COME BACK
AND SEE ME TOMORROW?

17
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,291
- I DON'T GET WHAT THOSE GUYS
SEE IN HER ANYWAY.

18
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,500
- TRAMP!

19
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,333
- OH, KAREN MY DEAR, YOU'VE
GOT QUITE THE FOLLOWING,

20
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:42,458
DON'T YOU?

21
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,333
- I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

22
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:50,250
OPEN GATE OF THE
GOLDEN RAM! ARIES!

23
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,291
- ( bleating )

24
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,875
- I'M SORRY, MA'AM.
DID YOU SUMMON ME?

25
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,916
- ( chattering in excitement )

26
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,708
- LOOK, I GOTTA RUN.

27
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,958
SO WILL YOU ENTERTAIN
THESE GENTLEMEN FOR ME?

28
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:06,375
- NO, NOT THAT AGAIN!
DO I HAVE TO?

29
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,333
- WE'LL SHOW YOU A GOOD TIME.

30
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,875
- I'M SORRY BUT I'M A
CELESTIAL SPIRIT!

31
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,833
I'M NOT CUT OUT FOR
THIS KIND OF THING.

32
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:16,500
- YOU'RE NOT REFUSING TO
FOLLOW ORDERS, ARE YOU?

33
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,166
- NO, OF COURSE NOT, MA'AM!

34
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:23,708
( chattering distinctly )

35
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:26,541
- CELESTIAL SPIRIT KING!

36
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,458
- UNBELIEVABLE. I MEAN WHO DOES
THAT LITTLE HUSSY THINK SHE IS,

37
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,916
TALKING BACK TO ME LIKE THAT?

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,083
- I KNOW YOU'RE FRUSTRATED,

39
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,625
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T BE SO CRUEL

40
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,833
TO YOUR CELESTIAL
SPIRITS, MY DEAR.

41
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,750
- WHAT? WELL, AS FAR AS
I'M CONCERNED,

42
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:45,041
SHE'S MY PROPERTY, SO I CAN
TREAT HER ANYWAY I PLEASE!

43
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:49,708
- ( sighs ) IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE
ESPECIALLY HARD ON POOR ARIES.

44
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:52,083
I'VE HEARD ABOUT ALL THOSE AWFUL
THINGS YOU'VE DONE TO HER.

45
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,208
LIKE USING HER AS A SHIELD
WHENEVER YOU'RE FIGHTING

46
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,125
AGAINST ANOTHER WIZARD.

47
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,125
- ( grunts )

48
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,541
- ( screaming )

49
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,166
- YEAH AND SO WHAT?

50
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,583
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S HUMAN
OR ANYTHING, RIGHT?

51
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,166
CELESTIAL SPIRITS ARE
NOTHIN' BUT TOOLS.

52
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,541
- KAREN! THEY'RE LIVING
BEINGS JUST LIKE YOU!

53
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,125
AND IF YOU CONTINUE TO
TREAT THEM SO DEPLORABLY,

54
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,583
THEY'RE BOUND TO
REBEL AGAINST YOU.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,416
- ( slapping )
- ( Ariel exclaims in pain )

56
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,458
- HOW DARE YOU GO BEHIND MY BACK
AND TATTLE TO MASTER BOB!

57
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,916
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN!

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,916
I NEVER EVEN SAID A WORD TO HIM!
HONESTLY, MA'AM!

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,208
- YOU WENT AND MADE
THE MASTER ANGRY WITH ME,

60
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,416
WHICH MEANS NOW
I'M ANGRY WITH YOU.

61
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,708
- I NEVER TOLD HIM. IT'S THE
TRUTH, MA'AM. I SWEAR I DIDN'T!

62
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,000
- YOU'RE STILL
FEIGNING INNOCENCE?

63
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,375
- WHAT ARE THOSE FOR?

64
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:44,500
- I'M GONNA USE THEM TO
LOCK YOU UP FOR SEVEN DAYS,

65
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,333
RIGHT HERE IN
THE HUMAN WORLD.

66
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:47,625
- FOR SEVEN DAYS?

67
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,916
BUT YOUR MAGIC WON'T
HOLD OUT THAT LONG!

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,250
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

69
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,333
- I'M A LOT STRONGER THAN
YOU EVEN KNOW, MISSY.

70
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:57,791
I'M GONNA BE JUST FINE
BUT YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND...

71
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,000
I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT
A WEEK IN THE HUMAN WORLD

72
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:03,083
WOULD DO TO A CELESTIAL SPIRIT.

73
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,708
I CAN'T WAIT TO FIND OUT!

74
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:10,333
- PLEASE DON'T DO THIS, MA'AM!
I'M BEGGING YOU!

75
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:13,166
- ( scoffs ) IT WON'T WORK,
ARIES! YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY!

76
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,791
I'LL SUMMON YOU RIGHT BACK!

77
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:19,000
- SHE DIDN'T RUN AWAY.
I SWITCHED PLACES WITH HER.

78
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,208
- IT'S YOU.

79
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,208
- YOU'VE ABUSED HER
LONG ENOUGH, KAREN.

80
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,750
- LEO THE LION.

81
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:30,000
- I TRIED MY BEST TO STOP HER
BUT I COULDN'T DO MUCH

82
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:34,083
'CAUSE ARIES AND I WERE STILL
CONTRACTED TO HER.

83
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,083
- WHY, YOU! HOW DID YOU
OPEN YOUR OWN GATE?

84
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,625
- I'M A CELESTIAL SPIRIT
BUILT FOR BATTLE.

85
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,416
I'M PATIENT AND STRONG.

86
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,166
YOUR ABUSE DOESN'T AFFECT ME
LIKE IT DOES MY FELLOW SPIRITS.

87
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,666
I'M WARNING YOU.

88
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:52,500
IF YOU EVER LAY A HAND ON
ARIES AGAIN, YOU'LL BE SORRY.

89
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,458
- WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE
THREATENING ME LIKE THAT?

90
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,833
- THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT I'VE BEEN MEANING

91
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,583
TO SAY TO YOU FOR A WHILE NOW.

92
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,500
I DEMAND THAT YOU RELEASE ME
AND ARIES FROM OUR CONTRACTS.

93
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,416
- WHAT? YOU DEMAND ME?

94
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,625
- YOUR BEHAVIOR AND THE WAY
YOU'VE TREATED US IS DEPLORABLE.

95
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,791
IN FACT, MANY SPIRITS IN
OUR WORLD ARE AFRAID

96
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,958
OF THEIR KEYS FALLING
INTO YOUR HANDS.

97
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,250
- SHUT UP! THAT'S NOT TRUE!

98
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,000
- YOU'RE A DISGRACE TO
OTHER CELESTIAL WIZARDS.

99
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:19,416
- GO BACK!
CLOSE GATE OF THE LION!

100
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:30,875
CLOSE! CLOSE! GO BACK, LEO!

101
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,416
( panting )

102
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,750
WHY CAN'T I FORCE
THE GATE TO CLOSE?

103
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,541
- YOU HEARD ME. I DEMAND THAT
YOU TERMINATE OUR CONTRACTS.

104
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,083
AND I'M NOT LEAVING
UNTIL THAT HAPPENS.

105
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:46,000
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SUMMON
ANOTHER SPIRIT WHILE I'M HERE.

106
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,291
YOU'RE FAR TOO WEAK.

107
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,500
AND I REFUSE TO BE AT
YOUR BECK AND CALL.

108
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,583
WHICH MEANS IT'LL BE HARD
FOR YOU TO FIND WORK.

109
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,041
- THERE'S ONE THING YOU
DIDN'T THINK ABOUT, LEO.

110
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:03,416
EVEN I HAVE LIMITS TO
MY MAGICAL POWER.

111
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,125
I'LL RUN OUT OF MAGIC
ENERGY IN ABOUT TEN DAYS

112
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,500
AND THEN YOU'LL BE FORCED BACK
INTO THE CELESTIAL WORLD,

113
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,083
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

114
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:14,000
- NO. IF YOUR MAGIC RUNS OUT,
IT WON'T AFFECT ME IN ANY WAY

115
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,708
BECAUSE I USED MY OWN
MAGIC TO GET HERE.

116
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:19,625
AND I'M PREPARED TO STAY
HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES.

117
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,833
I'LL BE WAITING IN THE
RUINS WEST OF TOWN.

118
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:26,375
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND,
YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME.

119
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,500
- ( door closing )

120
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,166
- HOW DARE HE!

121
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,583
- Karen: GIVE IT UP, LEO.

122
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:42,666
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE

123
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,166
TO HOLD OUT FOR
MUCH LONGER, YA KNOW?

124
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,875
- I'M THE LION,
THE LEADER OF THE ZODIAC.

125
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,541
I'M STRONGER THAN
THE OTHER SPIRITS.

126
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,083
I CAN DO THINGS THEY CAN'T.

127
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:54,041
LIKE I SAID BEFORE, I'M NOT
GOING ANYWHERE

128
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,541
UNTIL YOU VOID BOTH
OUR CONTRACTS.

129
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,000
- OH, GIVE ME A BREAK!

130
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,708
YOU REALLY THINK
I'D BE STUPID ENOUGH

131
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,791
TO GIVE UP TWO ZODIAC KEYS?

132
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,375
I CAN'T TAKE THE
HIGH PAYING JOBS

133
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:06,416
IF I DON'T HAVE YOU
TWO UNDER CONTRACT!

134
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,416
- GET OUT. AND DON'T COME BACK
'TIL YOU'RE READY TO RELEASE US.

135
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,750
- LEO.

136
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,500
- PLEASE. DON'T DO THIS TO ME.

137
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,083
IT'S BEEN A MONTH AND I
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO WORK.

138
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:26,500
I HAVE TO MAKE MONEY
IN ORDER TO SURVIVE!

139
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:30,750
IF YOU'LL STOP THIS, I PROMISE
I'LL NEVER MISTREAT ARIES AGAIN!

140
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:34,083
- YOU PROMISE?
YOU'RE LYING TO ME.

141
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,458
IF YOU TRULY FELT REMORSE
THEN YOU WOULD GO AHEAD

142
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,750
AND FREE US FROM OUR CONTRACTS.

143
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:42,583
- ( grunts ) WHY WON'T YOU
JUST DIE ALREADY, HUH?

144
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,875
ONCE YOU'RE GONE,
I CAN SUMMON ARIES!

145
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,958
I'LL FORCE HER TO WORK
LIKE A DOG JUST TO SPITE YOU!

146
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,833
- ( Loke groaning )

147
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,750
- I WON'T LET YOU GET
AWAY WITH THIS, LEO!

148
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,750
- IT'S NOT SO BAD NOW,
LIVING IN THE HUMAN WORLD.

149
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,000
UNFORTUNATELY, THERE'S
NOTHING I CAN DO

150
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,250
TO STOP MY LIFE
FORCE FROM DRAINING,

151
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,916
BUT AT LEAST IT'S NOT
AS PAINFUL ANYMORE.

152
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,458
IT'S BEEN THREE
MONTHS. I SUPPOSE

153
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:16,291
IT'S ABOUT TIME I FORGAVE KAREN.

154
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,041
IF SHE'S STILL ABUSIVE TO ARIES,

155
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:21,166
I CAN ALWAYS THREATEN
TO LEAVE AGAIN.

156
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,166
- Loke: NO! SHE CAN'T!

157
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,208
- I WARNED HER NOT TO WORK
UNTIL THIS WAS RESOLVED,

158
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,666
BUT SHE TOOK A
JOB REQUEST ANYWAY.

159
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,291
SHE HASN'T MADE ANY MONEY
IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS.

160
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,666
SO SHE MUST'VE BEEN DESPERATE.

161
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,708
- BUT WHY WOULD SHE TAKE A JOB?

162
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,083
SHE KNEW SHE COULDN'T
SUMMON ANOTHER SPIRIT.

163
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,125
NOT WHILE I'M HERE.

164
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,916
- A CELESTIAL WIZARD CAN SUMMON
MORE THAN ONE SPIRIT AT A TIME

165
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,708
BUT THE PROCESS
REQUIRES THE WIZARD

166
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,625
TO EXPEND MASSIVE AMOUNTS
OF MAGIC ENERGY.

167
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,916
I GUESS KAREN THOUGHT
SHE COULD HANDLE IT.

168
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,541
BUT IN THE END IT SEEMS,

169
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:06,416
THE POOR DEARY SIMPLY WASN'T
STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL IT OFF.

170
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,833
- I JUST... I WANTED HER TO
REALIZE SHE WAS WRONG ABOUT US.

171
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:15,375
CELESTIAL SPIRITS ARE MORE THAN
JUST MAGIC TOOLS.

172
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,875
WE'RE LIVING BEINGS,
WE HAVE FREE WILL.

173
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,208
WE CAN FEEL EMOTION
AND HER CRUELTY HURT US!

174
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:27,333
BUT I... I NEVER WANTED
HER TO DIE!

175
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,250
KAREN.

176
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,750
( screaming ) KAREN!

177
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:43,541
IT WAS MY FAULT AND I'VE LIVED
WITH THE GUILT EVER SINCE.

178
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,250
WHEN SOMEONE DIES,
THEY'RE GONE FOREVER.

179
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:50,541
I WISH I COULD BRING HER BACK,
IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE.

180
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:55,166
THE ONLY WAY I COULD MAKE THINGS
RIGHT IS IF I WERE TO DIE, TOO.

181
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:56,791
( gasps )

182
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,750
- OH NO! LOKE?

183
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,375
- I GUESS THIS IS IT.
IT'S MY TIME.

184
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,583
- WHADDYA MEAN YOUR TIME?

185
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,416
- FOR ME TO DISAPPEAR FOREVER.

186
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,375
- YOU CAN'T JUST GIVE UP!

187
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,750
- KAREN.

188
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:23,041
EVER SINCE THAT DAY, I'VE BEEN
BANNED FROM THE CELESTIAL WORLD.

189
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,666
- NO, YOUR HANDS!

190
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,958
- WHEN I KILLED KAREN, I BROKE
A FUNDAMENTAL CELESTIAL LAW.

191
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,291
NOW I HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE.

192
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:36,666
NOT A DAY GOES BY THAT I DON'T
THINK ABOUT HER AND WHAT I DID.

193
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,291
I TRY TO STAY DISTRACTED SO IT
WON'T CONSTANTLY BE ON MY MIND

194
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:43,250
BUT IT'S LIKE SHE'S HAUNTING ME.

195
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,875
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS,

196
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,625
FOR MY MAGIC ENERGY
TO FINALLY RUN OUT.

197
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:51,458
AND NOW IT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN,
RIGHT IN FRONT OF KAREN'S GRAVE.

198
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:55,666
THEN I'LL BE FREE. FREE FROM
THE GUILT THAT'S BURDENED ME.

199
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,708
BEFORE I GO,
I WANT TO THANK YOU.

200
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,958
YOU'VE RESTORED MY FAITH
IN CELESTIAL WIZARDS.

201
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:05,208
- WAIT. I CAN SAVE YOU!
YOU CAN'T GIVE UP YET!

202
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,708
- PLEASE TELL EVERYONE IN
FAIRY TAIL I SAID GOODBYE.

203
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,500
- IT'S NOT FAIR!
- LUCY...

204
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,041
I WON'T LET YOU DIE!

205
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,416
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GO
BACK TO THE CELESTIAL WORLD

206
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,083
AND YOUR LIFE FORCE
WILL BE RESTORED, RIGHT?

207
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:24,833
THERE'S GOTTA BE A WAY
I CAN SEND YOU BACK!

208
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,916
- I'M AFRAID THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

209
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,083
I BROKE THE LAW AND
I'M BEING PUNISHED.

210
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,083
- EVEN SO. THIS ISN'T RIGHT!

211
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,708
YOU DIDN'T KILL KAREN.

212
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:39,166
IT WAS JUST AN ACCIDENT!
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT!

213
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,041
- LUCY, I...

214
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,833
- OPEN GATE OF THE LION!

215
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:45,041
TAKE LEO BACK TO
THE CELESTIAL WORLD!

216
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:48,083
PLEASE! OPEN!

217
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,291
- ( sobbing )

218
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,708
- CALM DOWN.
IT WON'T WORK. IT'S OKAY.

219
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,375
- IT'S NOT OKAY!

220
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,541
I CAN'T JUST SIT HERE WHILE
MY FRIEND DISAPPEARS

221
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,875
RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES!

222
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:07,333
OPEN! GATE OF THE LION!

223
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,416
- STOP IT!

224
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,708
YOU'RE GONNA USE UP ALL OF
YOUR MAGIC ENERGY LIKE THIS!

225
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,500
- WHATEVER IT TAKES!
I'M GONNA SAVE YOU, LOKE!

226
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:18,958
I'LL OPEN YOUR GATE!
I WON'T GIVE UP!

227
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,916
I PROMISE I'M GONNA GET YOU
TO THE CELESTIAL WORLD!

228
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,125
- IT'S TOO DANGEROUS!

229
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:27,375
- OPEN GATE OF THE LION! OPEN!

230
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,166
- IT'S NOT GONNA OPEN FOR YOU!
AS FAR AS THEY'RE CONCERNED,

231
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,125
I'M RESPONSIBLE
FOR KAREN'S DEATH!

232
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,791
THEY'RE NOT GONNA
LET ME GO BACK!

233
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,875
- ( Lucy screaming )

234
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:40,083
- CUT IT OUT, LUCY! YOU'RE
STARTING TO ASSIMILATE WITH ME!

235
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,291
IF YOU DON'T STOP THIS
YOU'RE GONNA DISAPPEAR, TOO!

236
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:46,125
- I WON'T STOP 'TIL THE GATE'S
OPEN! I WON'T LET YOU DIE!

237
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,333
WHAT'S THE POINT OF
HAVING MAGIC POWER

238
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:52,125
IF YOU CAN'T USE IT TO SAVE
THE PEOPLE YOU CARE ABOUT?

239
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,416
- DON'T DO THIS!

240
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,416
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME LIVE WITH
THE GUILT OF KILLING YOU, TOO!

241
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,875
- YOU DIDN'T KILL HER!

242
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,166
WHOEVER DECIDED YOU
WERE RESPONSIBLE

243
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,791
NEEDS TO KNOW THAT
THEY WERE WRONG!

244
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,125
WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE?

245
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:30,500
- IMPOSSIBLE. IT'S HIM.

246
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,916
THE CELESTIAL SPIRIT KING!

247
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,875
WHAT IN THE HECK
IS HE DOING HERE?

248
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:41,083
- HE'S THE KING? LIKE, THE
RULER OF THE SPIRIT WORLD?

249
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:44,333
- HELLO, MY OLD FRIEND.

250
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,875
AS YOU WELL KNOW,

251
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:50,666
BOTH WIZARDS AND SPIRITS
MUST OBEY CELESTIAL LAW.

252
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,791
AND TAKING THE LIFE
OF A KEY HOLDER

253
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:56,208
IS FORBIDDEN UNDER
ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.

254
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,750
THOUGH NOT BY YOUR HAND,

255
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,750
YOU ARE STILL RESPONSIBLE
FOR YOUR KEY HOLDER'S DEATH,

256
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,375
LEO THE LION.

257
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,333
THEREFORE, YOU
HAVE BEEN BANISHED

258
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,125
FROM THE CELESTIAL
WORLD FOR ETERNITY.

259
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,708
- HOLD ON! THAT DOESN'T
SEEM FAIR AT ALL!

260
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,416
- LUCY, STOP!

261
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,958
- OLD FRIEND, HUMAN GIRL,

262
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:17,083
I HAVE MADE MY JUDGMENT
AND IT STANDS.

263
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,666
LEO HAS BROKEN CELESTIAL LAW.

264
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,500
- NO WAY. DID HE SHOW UP
JUST 'CAUSE LUCY

265
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,250
BLURTED OUT SOMETHIN'
ABOUT HIM BEING WRONG?

266
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,125
THAT'S CRAZY. WHY WOULD HE
CARE WHAT SHE THINKS?

267
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,166
- LOKE'S BEEN SUFFERING
IN THE HUMAN WORLD

268
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,000
FOR THREE LONG YEARS.

269
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:36,041
HE DIDN'T KILL KAREN!
BUT HE DID STAND UP TO HER!

270
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,708
BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAD
TO PROTECT ARIES!

271
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,500
I MUST SAY,
I FIND IT HEARTBREAKING

272
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:45,375
TO SEE MY OLD FRIEND IN
SUCH A FRAGILE CONDITION.

273
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,083
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

274
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,333
AN "OLD FRIEND" IS
STILL A FRIEND, RIGHT?

275
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,041
WELL, THERE'S ONE IN
FRONT OF YOU RIGHT NOW

276
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,875
ASKING FOR A SECOND CHANCE!

277
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,083
SO OPEN YOUR EYES, 'STACHE FACE!

278
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,333
- 'STACHE FACE?

279
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,833
- UH. LUCY?

280
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,500
- KAREN DIED 'CAUSE SHE TOOK ON
A JOB SHE COULDN'T HANDLE!

281
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,166
HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT!

282
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,708
YOU HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR VERDICT
'CAUSE HE'S INNOCENT!

283
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,000
PLEASE, SIR!

284
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,375
- JUST DROP IT ALREADY.

285
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:15,666
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF
THE VERDICT IS CHANGED.

286
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,708
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR FORGIVENESS.

287
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:22,875
I WANNA DISAPPEAR AND FINALLY
BE FREE FROM THIS GUILT!

288
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,375
- I WON'T LET YOU!

289
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:32,250
YOU DISAPPEARING ISN'T GONNA
BRING KAREN BACK TO LIFE!

290
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:36,416
ALL IT'S GONNA DO IS
CREATE MORE SADNESS!

291
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,416
YOU DID NOTHIN' WRONG!

292
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,416
BECAUSE IT CAN'T BE
A CRIME TO PROTECT

293
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,541
THE PEOPLE YOU CARE ABOUT!

294
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:47,541
- SHE SUMMONED ALL OF
THOSE SPIRITS AT ONCE?

295
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,750
NOT EVEN KAREN
COULD DO THAT!

296
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,416
- WHAT ABOUT ALL
OF YOUR FRIENDS?

297
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,875
YOU'RE JUST GONNA
LEAVE THEM?

298
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,083
IF YOU WERE TO DIE,
YOU'D LEAVE ME, AND ARIES,

299
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,166
AND EVERYONE ELSE HERE BEHIND!

300
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:03,083
THINK ABOUT US AND HOW MISERABLE
WE WOULD BE WITHOUT YOU!

301
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,375
- LUCY!

302
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:19,166
- ALL OF MY FRIENDS WHO
CAME FORWARD JUST NOW,

303
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,791
THEY FEEL THE
SAME WAY I DO.

304
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,375
- YOUR FRIENDS?

305
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,750
- IF YOU'RE A CELESTIAL
SPIRIT TOO,

306
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:26,833
YOU CAN SYMPATHIZE WITH

307
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,291
WHAT LOKE AND ARIES
WENT THROUGH!

308
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,625
- WOULD YOU STOP?

309
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,625
YOU'RE GONNA END UP LIKE
KAREN IF YOU KEEP THIS UP!

310
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,416
DON'T RISK YOUR
LIFE TO SAVE MINE!

311
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,833
- HMM.

312
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,916
HEARING YOU SPEAK SO
HIGHLY OF MY OLD FRIEND

313
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,250
HAS LED ME TO THINK MAYBE
IT IS NOT HIS ACTIONS

314
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,833
BUT THE LAW ITSELF THAT
SHOULD BE IN QUESTION.

315
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,958
LEO WAS FORCED TO
COMMIT HIS CRIME

316
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,583
TO PROTECT ARIES, HIS BRETHREN

317
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:58,291
AND THE HUMAN GIRL IS WILLING
TO RISK HER LIFE TO SAVE LEO.

318
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:01,666
I AM SO MOVED BY YOUR
BONDS OF LOYALTY,

319
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,458
I SHALL MAKE AN
EXCEPTION IN THIS CASE.

320
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,083
LEO THE LION, YOU ARE
HEREBY GRANTED

321
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:11,208
RETURN PASSAGE TO
THE CELESTIAL WORLD.

322
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,791
- YOU'RE AWESOME.
THANKS, 'STACHE FACE!

323
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,250
- ( laughs )

324
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,750
YOU ARE EXONERATED.

325
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,958
BE GRATEFUL TO THE
GUIDANCE OF THE STARS.

326
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:28,666
- I HAVE TO MAKE IT UP
TO HER. PLEASE, SIR!

327
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,375
- VERY WELL THEN.

328
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:34,083
IF YOU INSIST ON ATONING
FOR YOUR ACTIONS IN THE PAST,

329
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,791
THEN I HEREBY ORDER
YOU TO LIVE YOUR LIFE

330
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:42,708
IN THE SERVICE OF YOUR
FRIEND, THE HUMAN GIRL.

331
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:46,166
YOU ARE LUCKY TO HAVE FOUND
SUCH A LOYAL FRIEND.

332
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,125
I SUGGEST YOU PROTECT
HER WITH YOUR LIFE

333
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,291
JUST AS SHE FOUGHT
TO SAVE YOURS!

334
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,666
- YOU HEARD HIM.

335
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,541
- HEY, LUCY?

336
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,458
- MMM-HMM?

337
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,958
- I JUST WANTED TO SAY,
THANK YOU.

338
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,541
- Natsu: YOU'RE A
CELESTIAL SPIRIT?

339
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,333
- Happy: NO WAY, REALLY?

340
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,416
- SORRY I DIDN'T TELL YA BEFORE.

341
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,958
- AHA! SO THAT MUST BE
WHY I FELT SO WEIRD

342
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,000
WHENEVER WE SWITCHED BODIES!

343
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,291
- YEAH, I GUESS SO.

344
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,833
GOTTA SAY, I'M SURPRISED
I NEVER CAUGHT ON TO YA.

345
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,500
- HOW COME YOU'RE NOT A
COW OR A HORSE OR A CRAB?

346
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,083
YOU'RE JUST A DUDE.

347
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,916
- VIRGO HAS A HUMAN FORM, TOO.
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE ALL ANIMALS.

348
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,041
- Natsu: YOU SAY THAT

349
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,541
BUT I'VE SEEN HER
TURN INTO A GORILLA!

350
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,083
- SHE'S NOT REALLY A GORILLA.

351
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,250
- LOKE HERE'S ACTUALLY
A LION SPIRIT.

352
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,375
- SERIOUSLY?

353
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,791
- A LION'S LIKE A
GROWN UP CAT, RIGHT?

354
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,750
- YEP, YOU GOT IT!
- DON'T LIE TO HIM!

355
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,708
- YOU'RE THE COOLEST
SPIRIT EVER!

356
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:05,791
- SHOULDN'T YOU BE RESTIN' UP

357
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,958

WORLD RIGHT NOW?

358
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,958
- I'M DOING A LOT
BETTER THAN I WAS.

359
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,875
I JUST WANTED TO COME SAY HI.

360
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:15,041

361
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,791
- HE LOVES YOU!

362
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,750
- SHUT IT, CAT, OR
YOU'RE GONNA GET HURT.

363
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,083
- EXCUSE US, WE NEED TO HAVE

364
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,000
A LITTLE CHAT ABOUT
OUR FUTURE TOGETHER!

365
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,541
- WHAT'RE YOU DOIN'?
PUT ME DOWN!

366
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,125
- OH, MAN, I WISH I HAD
A CELESTIAL SPIRIT!

367
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,708
- WHAT KINDA THING WOULD IT BE?

368
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:32,416
- A DRAGON, DUH! 'CAUSE THEN I
COULD PRACTICE MY MAGIC ON IT!

369
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,916
- ( exclaiming excitedly )

370
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,958
- YOU DON'T SUMMON SPIRITS

371
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,958
JUST TO PRACTICE
YOUR MAGIC ON 'EM!

372
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,666
- THAT'S RIGHT! YOU SUMMON 'EM
WHEN YOU NEED SOME LOVIN'!

373
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,250
- I THINK YOU'D BETTER

379
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,708
- THEY'RE TICKETS TO THIS
AWESOME BEACH RESORT.

380
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,250
YOU DID SO MUCH FOR ME,
IT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO.

381
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,166
- THE BEACH!

382
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,291

ERZA HER TICKET.

383
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,583

00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,541

390
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,750

391
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,666

I WAS JUST THINKIN'.

405
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,583
IF I WAS EVER IN HIS SITUATION,
AND I HAD ACCIDENTALLY CAUSED

406
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:59,333
SOMEBODY HERE TO GET
HURT OR WORSE.

407
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:02,375
I'D BE JUST AS TORN UP

421
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:37,333
SHE COULDN'T STOP SMILING.

422
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:42,000
BUT LITTLE DID I KNOW,
THAT SMILE WOULD SOON VANISH.

423
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,541

432
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,958
- WAIT A MINUTE, THIS ISN'T
HEAVEN, IT'S A FISH RESTAURANT!

433
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,875
- Happy: THAT'S RIGHT!
