00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,000
[LUCY]
An eerie light illuminated

2
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:22,708
the entire Kingdom of Fiore,

3
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:27,583
transporting everyone and
everything to unexpected places.

4
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,541
If you disappear on me,

5
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:32,916
I'll just have to use my
magic to create you again!

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,291
We can still be
together forever.

7
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,083
I know that's what you want,

8
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,625
but it only worked
the first time

9
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,416
because you weren't aware of it.

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,500
If you know I'm an illusion,
it can't be like before.

11
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:44,875
Hey, Mavis.

12
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:47,583
You know where you can
find a fairy, don't you?

13
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:53,541
[MAVIS]
Yeah. Inside my heart.

14
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:56,333
It's true. And I'll be there.

15
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:57,666
[gasps]

16
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:01,333
[ZERA]
I'm not leaving you.

17
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:05,000
I'll always be in
your heart. Forever.

18
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:12,416
Promise me you'll
always be my friend.

19
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,500
Cross my heart.

20
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,375
[MAVIS]
I'm not leaving you.

21
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,458
[MAVIS]
Cana? Cana? Where are you?

22
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,083
[MAVIS] I'm having a little
bit of trouble moving around,

23
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,041
but I'll manage.

24
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,000
Cana!

25
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:15,250
That's good. My
magic still works.

26
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,291
Now I need to get upstairs.

27
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:30,750
[MAVIS]
Huh? There's not a soul in here.

28
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,958
That strange light earlier.

29
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,125
What's going on?

30
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,583
Zeref!

31
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,500
Hello, Mavis.

32
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:48,041
Everybody's disappeared.
What'd you do?

33
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,333
[ZEREF] I assure you,
I had no part in that.

34
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,666
Nor did I expect to
be here right now.

35
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,791
Honestly, the whole
situation is perplexing.

36
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:59,041
So, why are you here?

37
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:02,000
The question is,
why are you alive?

38
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,958
[gasps]

39
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:11,708
What in the hell is going on?!
I don't even know where I am!

40
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,000
Well, right now
you're on top of me.

41
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,041
Me, too.

42
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,541
Didn't even realize
you were here.

43
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,250
The last thing I
remember is being hit

44
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,375
by August's fire spell.

45
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,250
Please stop groping me.

46
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,333
His spell? No way.
I cancelled that out.

47
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,666
I mean, mostly.

48
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,166
Were you really
able to dispel it?

49
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,375
Yeah, pretty much.

50
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,250
Luckily it was a
little heat magic.

51
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:35,041
Now cancel out
your grabby hands!

52
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,333
[HAPPY]
It's weird.

53
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,958
I gotta wonder, how in the heck

54
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,791
did we end up
wherever we are now?

55
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,708
I can't get a whiff
of Mest or Brandish.

56
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,875
Nope. No trace of August.

57
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,541
What in the world
could've happened?

58
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:57,125
The landscape changed
somehow. Or maybe...

59
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:00,208
Were we transported somewhere?

60
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,083
[JUVIA]
Gray, darling.

61
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:07,083
Sorry, but I can't find
Wendy or Carla anywhere.

62
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,625
[GRAY]
I'll go out and look for 'em.

63
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,458
You take care of Erza.

64
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,750
[JUVIA]
Okay.

65
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:16,833
[WENDY]
Hey, Gray! Juvia!

66
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,125
Where are you guys?

67
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:24,500
What'll we do?
We all got separated.

68
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,083
[WENDY]
I can't even smell them.

69
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,666
They must be far away.

70
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,666
[MAKAROV]
What in blazes was that?

71
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,916
[JET]
We're outside?!

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,958
But we were just
in the guild hall!

73
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,708
[DROY]
Yeah, where the heck are we?

74
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,125
I'm totally confused!

75
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,208
[WAKABA] We seem to be
missing some folks!

76
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:44,458
The First Master! Does
anybody know where she is?

77
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:47,250
This is so crazy.
What's up with the map?

78
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:50,875
Can you even figure out where
we are on that doohickey?

79
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:51,916
Uh...

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,083
What's everybody doing here?

81
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,000
Wait. What?

82
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,625
Yeah, Mira and Lisanna
weren't with us before.

83
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,083
[MIRAJANE]
The sky lit up and here we are.

84
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,583
That's exactly what
happened to us.

85
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:07,375
Hey, you guys! Enemy forces!
And they're super close!

86
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,958
Whoa! Really?

87
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,500
They're startin'
to come this way!

88
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,666
What now?

89
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,541
We must prepare to do battle!

90
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,625
[FAIRY TAIL yelling]

91
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,541
Fiore looks wrong.

92
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,291
[BRANDISH] I was able
to shrink your wound,

93
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,500
so that should help a bit.

94
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,041
August, what'd you do?

95
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,791
It's not my magic.

96
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,250
Irene's cast a
compression spell.

97
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,875
So what does that mean?

98
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:40,583
[AUGUST] She used her power to
enchant this entire landmass,

99
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,416
and then altered its shape.

100
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,333
[BRANDISH]
The whole kingdom?

101
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,500
Everyone in Fiore has
randomly changed locations

102
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,916
as a result of this enchantment.

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,375
Universe One.

104
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,041
[BRANDISH]
But why would she do that?

105
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,291
[AUGUST] I understand this
to be a side effect

106
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:59,958
of moving specific individuals
to specific locations.

107
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,875
My guess is that she
moved His Majesty

108
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,750
close to the Fairy Heart,

109
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:08,166
and Acnologia as far
away as possible.

110
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,833
She's trying to speed up the
final conflict and end the war.

111
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,750
[ZEREF]
Anyway.

112
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,250
You likely know why I'm here,

113
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,625
but how I got here
is another matter.

114
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:22,958
The game board has
been re-arranged.

115
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,666
The players have moved.

116
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,916
A result of Fiore
itself being shrunk.

117
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,500
It's now 1/20th
of its original size.

118
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,666
Perhaps even smaller.

119
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,833
[MAVIS] Was that to increase
the probability of clashes

120
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,000
between our forces?

121
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,166
[ZEREF]
Ah, that tactical mind.

122
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,458
It seems Irene wishes to
bring an end to the war

123
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,791
in her own special way.

124
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:48,000
And as good fortune
would have it...

125
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:51,583
...I'm now face to face
with the Fairy Heart.

126
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:00,041
I must say, that went
better than expected.

127
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,416
That was my first try.

128
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,541
His Majesty is now at
Fairy Tail's headquarters,

129
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:09,333
and hopefully Acnologia
is across the sea.

130
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:12,166
I admit, there is a curious
feeling of excitement

131
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,333
in not knowing exactly
where I ended up, either.

132
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,750
But maybe... you'll tell me?

133
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,250
This woman, where'd
she come from?

134
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,583
Hey. Who are you?

135
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,750
[LUCY]
The light moved us.

136
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,916
It took us to unfamiliar places.

137
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,458
Look!

138
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,583
[LUCY]
Fiore had been twisted.

139
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,875
Nothing in the kingdom was
where it should've been.

140

[LUCY] Mercurius next
to Kardia Cathedral?

141

[NATSU] I don't remember
them bein' this close.

142
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,208
[LUCY] Yeah, because
they're supposed to be

143
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,291
hundreds of miles
from each other!

144
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,416
[LUCY]
It was like we had wandered

145
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,666
into an alternate world.

146
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,166
But what would we
find waiting for us?

147
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,875
Hope or despair?

148

[GAJEEL coughing]

149

[GAJEEL]
Huh? Where am I?

150
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:11,750
Because I think... I died.

Hey, you there.
We in hell or what?

That's so rude!

00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:24,208
You see me and then
assume we're in hell?

Huh?

Who are you?

My name is Zera.

And I'm one of

Oh my gosh! This is so hard!

00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:59,375
So, this place has gotta
be either heaven or hell.

163
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,708
Which one?

164
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:05,333
[ZERA] It's neither?
Because you're still alive?

165
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,416
[GAJEEL]
Huh?

166
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,875
[ZERA]
You got lucky.

167
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,583
Someone out there cast a
spell that warped the land

168
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,416
and moved everybody around
completely at random.

169
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,916
And right before you got sucked
into the underworld,

170
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
you were transported
here instead.

171
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,250
Just in the nick of time, huh?

172
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,000
You kiddin' me?

173
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,916
I wanted us to be
together forever.

174
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,208
[GAJEEL] If this ain't the
afterlife, then where are we?

175
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:36,166
[ZERA] Fairy Tail's sacred
ground, Tenrou Island.

176
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,916
But it's not really
an island anymore

177
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,375
because it's connected
to the mainland now.

178
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,333
And who are you?

179
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,250
[ZERA]
I told you! I'm Zera!

180
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,166
Never heard of you before.

181
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,583
[growls]

182
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,916
Jeez, Mavis. You really never
told the guild about me?

183
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,291
That hurts my feelings.

184
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,916
Anyway, in another
coincidence,

185
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,708
Mavis finally woke up
from her long sleep.

186
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,041
It happened just
a little while ago.

187
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:05,666
And when she woke up,
I was reborn.

188
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,875
Uh, maybe "revived" is
a better way to put it.

189
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,041
[GAJEEL]
Huh?

190
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,250
[ZERA] In other words,
Mavis' magic power

191
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,708
and consciousness
were instantly reset.

192
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,250
I was automatically
regenerated as well,

193
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,208
but only for a short time.

194
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,041
[GAJEEL]
I don't totally get it,

195
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,500
but you're sayin'
somethin' like,

196
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,791
you came back to life
because she woke up?

197
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,833
Kind of. I guess that's
one way to put it.

198
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,791
But I'll only be
around temporarily.

199
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:35,541
I'd be willing to bet that the
moment Mavis remembers me,

200
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,875
I'll probably disappear again.

201
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,041
But no matter how
long I'm here for,

202
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,791
I need to make the most
of the time I have.

203
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:47,583
I gotta figure out exactly what
I can do to help her out.

204
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,250
Wait a second!

205
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,375
This is actually
happening, isn't it?

206
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:54,125
You can see and hear me, right?

207
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,500
Well, yeah.

208
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:58,625
Your magic's gotten stronger,
Mavis. I'm so proud!

209
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,208
Not to be rude,

210
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:03,541
but this ain't really the best
time to be shootin' the breeze.

211
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:04,875
You're right.

212
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,541
And since I'm an
original guild member,

213
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:11,416
I say, let's go and
protect Fairy Tail.

214
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,375
[LUCY]
How in the heck are they

215
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,750
right next to each
other like that?

216
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,500
I don't know.

217
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,333
They look like they're
in two different cities.

218
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,541
Did they merge somehow?

219
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,791
[HAPPY] I don't see the
guild hall anywhere.

220
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,083
Or any other buildings.

221
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,541
It's like the rest of
Magnolia disappeared!

222
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:34,500
[NATSU]
What?

223
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,208
[LUCY]
That's crazy!

224
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,833
Wait. That smell.

225
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:39,875
Someone's here!

226
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,166
[JUVIA, GRAY gasp]

227
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,166
'Sup, Gray?

228
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,708
[LUCY, HAPPY]
Good to see ya!

229
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:45,791
Hey.

230
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,000
So glad we found you.

231
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,625
[NATSU]
What's goin' on with her?

232
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,916
Erza? She had a
pretty brutal fight.

233
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,125
[JUVIA] We were trying to get
her back to the guild.

234
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,250
[LUCY] Yeah, that's where
we were going, too.

235
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,833
[HAPPY]
I'm super worried about Carla.

236
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:03,083
[GRAY] Problem is, we don't
know what direction it's in.

237
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,916
[NATSU]
This sucks!

238
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:11,458
[ARCADIOS] She defeated us...
in less than a second.

239
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:15,125
How? How could she
be so powerful?

240
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,458
[TOMA]
I beg of you.

241
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,583
Please, miss.

242
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:24,166
Do whatever you wish
with me, but spare her.

243
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,708
Please spare my only daughter!

244
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,666
[TOMA]
Don't hurt her!

245
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,250
Hisui!

246
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,916
No, not my princess!

247
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,958
What...? What have
you done to her?

248
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:46,208
Turned into a mouse? Dear god.

249
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,458
Oh, no. Hisui.

250
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,208
[IRENE] Can you still
love her in that form?

251
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,708
Love her despite the fact
she's a disgusting rodent?

252
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,208
Yes, of course.

253
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:02,083
No matter what she may look
like, she's still my child.

254
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,791
Oh, Hisui.

255
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:07,208
I promise I will get you
back to normal somehow.

256
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,625
[IRENE]
I'm wasting time here.

00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,083

An eye?

263
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,875
A huge one!

264
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,416
That scarlet hair.

270
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,041
[SOLDIER C]
Keep fighting! Gang up on 'em!

271
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,750
[SOLDIER D] We'll drive
'em all over the cliff!

Not if I can help it!

273
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,791
Let's make 'em scatter!

You can try, but you'll
never keep up with me!

No, idiot!

You eat the appetizers,
then the main course!

Master Mavis is alone at
the guild hall. Let's go!

where it is anymore!

Listen up!

start heading north, now!

from inside my head.

I've never heard her before.

[ZERA] You need to assemble
at the guild hall

before it's too late!

separated you,

come together now!

Aye!

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,166

trust some random voice?

317
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,958
[JUVIA] What if they're trying
to steal you from me?

Go and help her!

mother to all of you,

so don't waste any time
and get over there!

321
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,625
It's your duty to protect her!

322
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,041
Let's go!

323
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:57,125
She told us where it was.
Did anyone understand it?

324
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,666
That way!

325
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,166
But still.

326
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,416
This voice...

327
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,291
I wonder who it is,
and why they care.

328
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,000
Who gives a crap, man?
Let's head out!

329
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,666
[LUCY groans]

330
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,625
Came off pretty bossy, ya know?

331
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,250
I think you could've
sounded a little sweeter,

332
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,958
maybe even said please.

333
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,333
You sure you're friends
with our First Master?

334
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,083
[LEVY gasps]

335
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,500
[LEVY]
It's him.

336
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,083
I just heard Gajeel!

337
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,625
Me, too! That's awesome!

338
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,375
So that voice is
really on our side.

339
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:32,333
Back to the guild, you guys!
We've got work to do!

340
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,625
He's alive.

341
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:39,833
Head north! Let's go
help the First Master!

342
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,958
[FAIRY TAIL yelling]

343
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,125
Hey. Where's Elfman?

344
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,208
Don't know. He's not here.

345
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:50,541
I'm worried. He must've
gotten separated from us.

346
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,125
I'm kinda worried, too.

347
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:55,125
But wherever he is, I just hope
he was able to hear that voice.

348
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,916
[JULIET yells]

349
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,416
What is all this stuff?

350
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,333
It's so sticky!

351
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,750
[MIRAJANE gasps]

352
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,375
Mira!

353
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,625
Mine!

354
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,791
[MIRAJANE yells]

355
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,833
No fair! She was s'posed
to be my snack!

356
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,166
[MIRAJANE] Lisanna. I want you
to go with the others.

357
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,291
[LISANNA]
You sure?

358
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,041
I can handle them by myself.

359
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,791
It's fine, I've got it.

360
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,416
Okay.

361
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,708
That's ridiculous. You can't
take us down on your own.

362
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,291
Prepare to die, fool.

363
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,791
I'll kill you, while she
watches and takes notes.

364
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,041
[LECTOR] So, uh, does anybody
have a clue where we are?

365
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,708
[FROSCH] There's a mountain,
a forest, and a river!

366
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,291
[ELFMAN] Well, Fairy Tail's
supposed to be this way.

367
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,583
[YUKINO] Is that what
the nice voice told you?

368
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,041
[LECTOR]
Was it nice?

369
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,375
[FROSCH]
I think so!

370
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,875
Yeah, well, Elfman
was the only one

371
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,875
who actually heard it, so...

372
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,125
I didn't hear a single
word they said.

373
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:11,583
Guessin' only Fairy Tail members
could hear it or something.

374
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,125
If that's true,

375
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,958
are you sure it's okay we're
coming to the guild with you?

376
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,750
Aw, I wanna see Rogue.

377
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,083
Well, if Sting
and the rest of 'em

378
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,375
are with other people
from Fairy Tail,

379
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,750
they're probably heading to
the guild hall, too, like us.

380
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:26,708
Right?

381
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,291
With Rogue?

382
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,333
There's no other option. Just
gotta trust the voice for now.

383
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,875
[YUKINO]
Yeah.

384
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,416
[ALL]
Huh?

385
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,583
[ELFMAN]
Who's that?

386
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:36,916
[LECTOR] I don't know,
but whoever it is,

387
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,125
I hope they're friendly.

388
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,041
[FROSCH]
Rogue?

389
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You're my big sister.

390
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,291
It's you.

391
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,458
Huh?

392
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,500
Seems like they know each other?

393
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,541
I think so, too.

394
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,083
--[ELFMAN, LECTOR] I see.
--Yeah!

395
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:01,333
[ALL]
Huh?!

396
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:07,750
This oughtta keep you busy!
It's nice and sticky!

397
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,125
Ugh. This slime.
It's burning me.

398
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,375
[chuckles]

399
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,750
[MIRAJANE screams]

400
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,458
Take that!

401
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,583
[MIRAJANE]
I underestimated them.

402
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,208
They're way stronger
than I thought.

403
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:33,166
It's stupid to show your
full power right off the bat.

404
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,875
No duh.

405
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,416
[MIRAJANE]
Heh. Oh, I agree.

406
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:43,916
Which is why I saved
something as a surprise.

407
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,583
[MIRAJANE]
Satan Soul...

408
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,375
...Form Alegria.

409
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,333
No.

410
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:55,208
What the--? Uh-oh.

411
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,500
We fought against Tartaros,

412
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:01,583
and I collected many souls
before it was all over.

413
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,083
I practically lost count.

414
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:06,833
[gasps]

415
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:09,000
[JULIET]
Whoa! That's terrifying!

416
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,583
She boiled away the sea
with her power!

417
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,750
She's a monster!

418
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,500
Heard that one before.

419
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,416
But I'd say I'm actually
more of a demon.

420
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,333
Still, though...

421
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,708
[HEINE, JULIET scream]

422
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,958
I don't like being called
either by people I don't know.

423
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,791
[MIRAJANE] That used up
so much magic power.

424
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,750
I'm drained.

425
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,291
Please stay down.

426
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,875
That's more than
enough for today.

427
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,500
[MIRAJANE gasps]

428
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:53,375
[MIRAJANE]
Black and white swords?

429
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,041
This magic...

430
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:59,166
Someone enchanted those
swords to have personalities.

431
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,958
It's hard to believe.

432
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:05,666
To think there's a wizard
with that kind of power.

433
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,541
[LUCY] Mirajane defeated Irene's
top two soldiers in a flash.

434
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:44,125
But before she has a chance
to rest or celebrate,

435
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:47,250
the Scarlet Despair
herself closes in.

436
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:48,958
Meanwhile, the Fairy
Tail members

437
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,833
who were scattered
all over Fiore

438
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:53,750
make their way to save
the First Master.

439
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:56,375
But the invading enemy force
gathers its military might

440
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:59,750
to prevent them from
reaching their destination.

441
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:02,625
Next Time: "White Dragneel."

442
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:06,166
The life-or-death battle
for our future rages on.
