[LUFFY sighs]

2
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,041
[NARRATOR] Earthland has
been afflicted by a series

3
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,916
of strange phenomena.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,875
These mysterious disruptions
to the natural flow of life

5
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:31,208
have done great harm not
only to the creatures

6
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:34,333
of Earthland, but
also to its people.

7
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,291
A region once
gorgeous and lush

8
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:40,291
with greenery now suffers
from unrelenting drought.

9
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:43,750
A once beautiful beach,
known for sunlit skies

10
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:49,125
and temperate weather,
lies blanketed in dark clouds.

11
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:51,708
A scorching desert that
once stretched as far

12
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:56,166
as the eye could see has
transformed into tundra.

13
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,250
[BIRDS screeching]

14
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:03,000
[NARRATOR] Disoriented by
these anomalies, a vast number

15
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:06,000
of creatures have
begun to migrate.

16
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,708
All have felt these
changes. However,

17
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:11,958
as of now, there is not a
single person in this world

18
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:15,750
who comprehends
their true significance.

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,708
[All gasp]

20
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,583
[LUCY]
The whole place is cleared out!

21
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,250
[HAPPY]
Weird, where'd everyone go?

22
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,291
[NATSU]
It's like a graveyard in here.

23
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,583
[HAPPY]
Signal of Rebellion

24
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,625
Is everybody else
out workin', or what?

25
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,458
Yeah. Between this weather
and the natural disasters,

26
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,958
folks have been
hurting out there.

27
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,000
[KINANA] So naturally,
the guild's been just about

28
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,958
buried in job requests.

29
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,000
Hey, I'm great at
disasters, let me at 'em!

30
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,583
Giddy up, man, I wanna
check out that request board!

31
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:21,625
This is perfect!

32
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,083
My celestial spirits
were pretty much

33
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,541
born to put nature in its
place. They'll rock this!

34
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,333
Just point me to a
town that's overheated

35
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,625
and I'll have Aquarius flood
the place with cool water!

36
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:30,916
There was a place like that,

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,916
but Juvia and Gray
beat you there.

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,041
[GRAY] This place is hotter
than I thought it'd be.

39
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,958
[JUVIA] We only just got
here and it feels like

40
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,666
I'm being cooked alive.

41
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,625
[GRAY]
Well, let's get to it.

42
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,875
I'll follow your lead,
darling. Go ahead.

43
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,000
Ice Make Geyser!

44
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,041
Water Slicer!

45
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,041
[FEMALE VILLAGER 205A]
It's so refreshing!

46
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,916
[MALE VILLAGER 205A]
I should've brought my coat!

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,625
[MALE VILLAGER 205B]
Finally, I can get...

48
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,375
[GRAY] Well, That should
last 'em for a while.

49
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,250
I'm cold now, warm
me with your body!

50
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,958
Gah, keep your
grabby hands off me!

51
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,250
[LUCY] Hm...

52
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,833
Okay, is there anywhere around
that needs to have repairs done?

53
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,041
'Cause I bet Taurus
could rebuild

54
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,541
a whole town singlehandedly!

55
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,416
Yeah there was, but Erza
has it covered by now.

56
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,500
[FOREMAN 205A]
Come on men, get a move on!

57
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,375
Work like you give a damn!

58
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,500
[FOREMAN 205A] And if you
need some inspiration,

59
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,833
take a good look at her.

60
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,791
[ERZA yells]
Dig for glory!

61
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,500
She's my hero!

62
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,125
[WORKERS]
Yeah, mine too!

63
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,541
[ERZA]
My work here is done.

64
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,125
I'll assist the others now.

65
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm in your debt for
exposing me to such

66
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,666
an excellent workout routine.

67
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,666
[LUCY laughs]

68
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,583
Let's see here.

69
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,916
Oh yeah, Wendy and Carla
are off helping a ship

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,375
that got stuck in the
open sea for lack of wind.

71
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,250
[MIRAJANE] Laxus and
the Thunder Legion went

72
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,875
to protect this city with
a broken lightning rod.

73
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,875
[CROWD cheers]

74
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:06,041
[LUCY sighs] So are Elfman and
Lisanna helping out as well?

75
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,666
They're dealing with a
farmland pest problem.

76
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,541
My brother's probably
scaring the spots off

77
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,708
some leopard boars as we speak.

78
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:16,083
[LUCY] Gotcha. Wait,
is Nab out there too?

79
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,875
[KINANA] He read some
scary books and now

80
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,333
he's afraid to leave his room.

81
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,666
Sounds like him.

82
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,666
But, just about everybody
else was able to find

83
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,791
something that suited
their abilities.

84
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,041
That wall was covered in flyers.

85
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,166
But at this point,
the pickings are slim.

86
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,916
[HAPPY] Seriously. The only
ones left are all gross or lame!

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,625
[NATSU] Lawn work, book sorting.
Tricks at a birthday party?

88
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:35,958
Who do they think I am?

89
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,916
[LUCY] Don't knock those
till you see this side.

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,333
This is your fault Lucy.
If you hadn't spent half the day

91
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,125
in the bathtub, we'd be
wrapping up by now!

92
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,500
I have a morning routine.

93
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,875
You might not care how
you look or smell, but I do.

94
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,250
Don't you worry! I saw
a job that had "Lucy"

95
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,666
written all over it,
so I snagged it for ya.

96
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,750
[LUCY]
Did you really?

97
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,333
[HAPPY]
You're our savior, thank you!

98
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,166
[MIRAJANE]
Oh, stop it.

99
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,416
[KINANA]
Take a look!

100
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,250
There's a little coastal
village called Seabellus

101
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,666
that needs help with research.

102
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,333
There's a pretty
hefty reward, too.

103
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,375
[NATSU] Sounds legit.
Let's get a move on!

104
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,458
If we make it back before Gray
does, we can call him a slacker!

105
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,500
Aye!

106
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,416
Job after job.
You never see it coming.

107
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,166
[HAPPY]
Does it help to lay like that?

108
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,708
[NATSU]
I gotta get off this thing.

109
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,875
Just throw me out
the window. I'll walk.

110
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:20,083
[LUCY] Walking isn't an option.
It'd take us days to get there.

111
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,000
[HAPPY]
Wow, he turned a new color!

112
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,750
[NATSU groans]
How long till the pain ends?

113
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,166
[LUCY]
Around two hours or so.

114
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,333
[NATSU groans]

115
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:28,583
[HAPPY] This job is
perfect for ya Lucy,

116
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,541
I mean no one else
from Fairy Tail can do it.

117
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,375
[LUCY]
Mm-hm! celestial wizard wanted.

118
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,875
Assistance is required
investigating a disturbance

119
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,875
amongst the celestial spheres.

120
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,041
This is a possible cause
of recent changes seen

121
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,208
in the climate
throughout Earthland.

122
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,750
Maybe you can fix the weather!

123
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,916
Celestial wizards
really are super hard

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,208
to come by these days!

125
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,250
This job and I are a match
made in the heavens,

126
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,458
my feline friend.

127
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,583
[HAPPY] If your head
keeps growing it'll pop.

128
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,750
[LUCY] So I was thinking,
if the client can afford to do

129
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,125
this kind of research,
I'll bet they're like a scholar

130
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,500
with a royal grant or
a government agency.

131
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,125
[HAPPY] The flyer
doesn't say who they are.

132
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,916
But, I guess we'll find
out when we get there.

133
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,375
So, uh...

134
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:11,500
This is it. Or it should be.

135
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,208
[HAPPY] I don't know
how to it break to ya,

136
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,541
but there's nothin' here.

137
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,333
[LUCY]
Yeah, I noticed.

138
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,375
[NATSU]
"Just two hours left," she said.

139
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,791
Bull crap, it felt like days.

140
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,416
[NATSU sniffs]

141
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,791
That smell. What is it?

142
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:30,541
[LUCY, HAPPY gasp]

143
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,125
[LUCY, HAPPY scream]

144
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,333
[HAPPY]
What is that thing?

145
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,416
[LUCY] It's a sea slug!
A really frickin' big one too!

146
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,750
[HAPPY]
Is that a kind of fish?

147
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,375
'Cause if it is,
then we can eat it!

148
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,666
Crazy as this sounds, I think
he's hungrier than you are!

149
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,250
Okay fine, what's your plan?

150
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,500
I've got this!

151
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,375
It actually works out
that we're by the sea.

152
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:51,416
Open, Gate of the
Water Bearer! Aquarius!

153
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,416
[LUCY] Uh.
[HAPPY] Pop it open, now!

154
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,791
This is so not right.

155
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,416
Hey Aquarius.
What's the matter with you?

156
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,125
[LUCY] C'mon, Open,
Gate of the Water Bearer!

157
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,916
Aquarius!

158
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
[HAPPY]
What happened?

159
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,500
[LUCY]
Pretty please? I need your help!

160
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,166
[HAPPY, LUCY scream]

161
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,416
[NATSU]
Fire Dragon Iron Fist!

162
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,125
[LUCY screams]

163
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,666
It downed him
like a roast pepper!

164
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,791
I'll try this one.

165
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,166
Just hang in there, okay?

166
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,291
Open, Gate of the Golden Bull!

167
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,166
Come on!

168
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,916
Taurus!

169
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,208
[HAPPY]
What's the deal?

170
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,541
[LUCY] Why won't any of
my spirits come help me?

171
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,625
[NATSU]
Fire Dragon...

172
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,083
Roar!

173
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,458
[NATSU screams]

174
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,625
[HAPPY]
You're alive!

175
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,625
[LUCY] At least one
of 'em's gotta work!

176
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,333
Loke! Get your butt out here!

177
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:45,250
What's wrong with me?
I need some help!

178
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,916
Sagittarius! Please! Virgo?

179
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,625
Anybody out there?
Don't let me get eaten!

180
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,333
One, two three, heave!

181
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:55,375
I'm good! Lucy isn't
usin' her spirits?

182
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:56,458
What's the deal?

183
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,625
Uh...

184
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:00,583
[NATSU]
Hit the sand, Lucy! Fire...

185
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,666
Dragon Roar!

186
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,250
[LUCY screams]

187
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,708
Eat your fill.

188
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,625
Lucy, run! She's gonna blow!

189
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,708
[LUCY screams]

190
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,000
[NATSU] Yeah, I don't
think it's comin' back.

191
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,750
Hey Lucy, you okay?

192
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,708
[LUCY]
My celestial spirits won't come.

193
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,416
I say the words. Then, nothing.

194
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,208
[ERZA]
It's certainly strange.

195
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,041
[CARLA]
Yes. To say the very least.

196
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,750
Come on. Is nobody else
gonna be real with her?

197
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,916
As your friend,
I'm obliged to say it.

198
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,416
This ain't your look.

199
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,791
I find it ironic, getting
fashion advice from a nudist.

200
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,250
Cover yourself please

201
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,750
Excuse me. But what is it
that you said was strange?

202
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,041
The job that Natsu's
group just took.

203
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,666
Seabellus village
doesn't actually exist.

204
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,125
But, how could it not exist?

205
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,208
[ERZA] I've done a number
of jobs in that region

206
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,833
and it's quite deserted.

207
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:05,291
If there were a town there, it'd
be populated by giant sea slugs.

208
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,083
[GRAY] If the town isn't
real, we can assume

209
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,416
the job was faked too.

210
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,375
[MIRAJANE] But who would
do something like that?

211
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,791
And what are they after?

212
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,125
I have a bad feeling about this.

213
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,291
Unfortunately, it seems far
too elaborate to be a prank.

214
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,958
If they're heading for a trap,
then we should warn them!

215
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,875
[YUKINO]
I hope I'm not too late.

216
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,375
It's Yukino.

217
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,208
[GRAY]
You're soaking wet.

218
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,583
[WENDY]
You must be freezing!

219
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,791
I have to speak with
Lucy, where is she?

220
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,791
[ERZA] Tell us what's happening.
Why are you so flustered?

221
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,791
[MIRAJANE] Hold on a sec.
I'll go grab you a towel, okay?

222
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,583
There isn't any time.

223
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,083
I need to find Lucy
as soon as possible!

224
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,541
There's something important
I have to tell her!

225
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:46,416
Alright then.

226
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,208
Now Open, Gate of the Ram!

227
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,708
Come Aries!

228
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,375
[LUCY]
Open, Gate of the Twins!

229
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,291
Gemini!

230
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,291
[HAPPY] I'm sure they'd
come if they could, Lucy.

231
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,166
[NATSU]
All ten keys are broken?

232
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,333
[LUCY] I don't understand
what's wrong with them!

233
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,875
Maybe they're all
out doing some

234
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,958
important celestial
spirit stuff.

235
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,708
No. Even if that
were the case

236
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,208
they'd still give
some kind of response.

237
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,333
What could've happened?

238
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,416
I can kind of picture
Loke or Aquarius

239
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,250
blowin' you off, but Virgo and
Aries wouldn't do that to ya,

240
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,250
they take things too seriously.

241
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,250
[LUCY gasps]
There's one way to find out.

242
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,333
I still haven't tried
my silver keys!

243
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:23,583
Open, Gate of the
Southern Cross!

244
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,208
Crux!

245
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:25,958
It worked!

246
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,375
Wow, you did it!

247
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,791
[HAPPY]
Long time, no see, Grandpa Crux!

248
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:32,041
[CRUX groans]

249
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,333
[LUCY]
Grandpa Crux!

250
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,416
[NATSU]
Whoa man, you okay?

251
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,916
I'm afraid not.

252
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,208
You're badly hurt.

253
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,041
Talk to us, what
happened to you?

254
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:44,125
Just tell us what their name is.
I'll take care of the rest.

255
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,000
Something awful's happened.

256
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,791
In the celestial world.

257
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,041
Wait, what do you mean?

258
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:53,208
[CRUX]
Miss Lucy. Heed my words.

259
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,166
If that which has been set
in motion isn't stopped,

260
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,166
then both the celestial world
and the human world

261
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,708
will end up completely--

262
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,291
[NATSU]
Watch out!

263
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,916
[LUCY]
Who attacked us?

264
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,583
[HAPPY]
Maybe those moles had kids!

265
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,041
I know that scent.

266
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,000
Natsu? Where's Grandpa Crux?

267
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,958
[CRUX screams]

268
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,208
[NATSU, LUCY gasp]

269
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:21,166
[CRUX] Miss Lucy.
Please run while you can!

270
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,083
[WOMAN]
Shut your mouth.

271
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,666
The punishment for
chatting up humans is severe.

272
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,916
[LUCY]
Hey, who are you?

273
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,708
[NATSU]
Scent doesn't lie. We know her.

274
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:32,833
[LUCY]
No.

275
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,458
She would never hurt
a friend of mine--

276
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,833
[VIRGO]
I like to hurt things.

277
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,208
It's the best part
of being The Maiden.

278
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,916
Oh yeah!

279
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,208
[ERZA] Those are the
keys of the Balance

280
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,666
and the Two Fish, aren't they?

281
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,875
[YUKINO]
Yes.

282
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,000
I use these keys to
summon Libra and Pisces.

283
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,750
Unfortunately, the last several
times I attempted to use them,

284
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,500
my calls went unanswered.

285
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,791
You must be so worried.

286
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,416
Those spirits
are special, right?

287
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah, they're two of the
12 Zodiac celestial spirits.

288
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,375
There are many beings
in the celestial world,

289
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,958
but those 12 are
uniquely powerful.

290
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,541
[JUVIA]
I don't understand.

291
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,500
Are celestial spirits even
able to disregard a summons?

292
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,333
I thought they were
bound to obey the wizard

293
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,208
to whom they're contracted.

294
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,208
Is something interfering
with the keys?

295
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,958
[YUKINO] I've been looking
into it, but nothing's come up.

296
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,625
But, that's why I
must find Lucy,

297
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,500
to find out if
her zodiac spirits

298
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,041
have gone silent as well.

299
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,750
[CARLA] First we learn she's
taken a false job, and now this?

300
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,041
[WENDY] Without her spirits,
she could be in real trouble.

301
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,291
[GRAY]
Don't worry, she's with Natsu.

302
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,541
Did I just say that?

303
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,291
[MIRAJANE] We could try
to get in touch with her

304
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:48,458
telepathically, but Warren's
out on a job right now.

305
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,458
I hope she's okay.

306
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,500
Please. Help me!

307
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,458
Your cries of pain are giving
me the shivers, old boy.

308
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:57,750
Hey, let him go!

309
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,791
That can't be her. Can it?

310
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,916
[VIRGO] Go back where
you belong, traitor!

311
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,791
[CRUX screams]

312
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,583
She forced the gate to close!

313
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:10,500
[NATSU]
Tell me. Are you actually Virgo?

314
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,708
[VIRGO]
Who else would I be?

315
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,291
[HAPPY]
I don't know, but the real Virgo

316
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,583
wouldn't do this stuff!

317
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:18,208
[LUCY]
Mm-mm. No, I'm sure of it now.

318
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,708
You don't even look the same.

319
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,250
But you're her.

320
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,500
[LUCY] Whatever happened,
you're still Virgo.

321
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,541
There's no doubt about it.
I know my friends.

322
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,041
You've worked
that out, have you?

323
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,375
Well done, I'll reward
you with pain.

324
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,166
That's not how rewards work.

325
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,833
[VIRGO grunts]
[ALL scream]

326
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,375
You wanna fight me? Let's go!

327
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,416
Let's see what
your guts look like.

328
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,875
[NATSU yells]

329
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,125
[LUCY]
Stop fighting, please!

330
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,208
[NATSU]
How come?

331
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,958
[LUCY]
I have to deal with this myself.

332
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,125
I'm the one she made
her contract with,

333
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,708
so it should be me
that enforces that pact.

334
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,375
[VIRGO] In that case,
you must be Lucy Heartfillia.

335
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,666
I'm told that I used
to be a slave of yours.

336
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,500
[LUCY]
Slave? We were friends!

337
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,875
What do you mean "told?"
Don't you remember?

338
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,083
[VIRGO]
Sure don't.

339
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,958
The days I spent serving
you have gone dark.

340
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,708
That's crazy.
You forgot that much?

341
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,750
I'm bored talking, let's get
straight into the pain!

342
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,791
[LUCY]
I'll make you remember!

343
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,791
[HAPPY] Lucy's barely
keeping up with her!

344
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,250
[NATSU] Virgo was trouble
enough when she liked us.

345
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,333
[VIRGO gasps]

346
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,041
Take this!

347
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,875
[VIRGO gasps]

348
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:25,916
Princess.

349
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,166
[LUCY whimpers]

350
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,083
You just showed
mercy to a sadist.

351
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:31,916
Bad move!

352
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,375
[LUCY screams]

353
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,250
[NATSU, HAPPY]
Lucy!

354
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,041
Stay back. It's my fight.

355
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:37,916
[HAPPY]
But why?

356
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,125
Something's taken her memories,

357
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,250
but that doesn't mean
she's not my friend.

358
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,250
I have to find
a way to help her.

359
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,041
Weakling! You coward!

360
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,458
Suffer, master!

361
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,666
Screw this.

362
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,333
[LUCY]
Natsu, stop!

363
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,166
If you really wanna help,

364
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,458
then stay out of this one, okay?

365
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:57,583
[LUCY screams]

366
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,083
The look on your face
is quite exquisite, Lucy.

367
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:05,208
But you can scream far louder
than that and we both know it.

368
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,166
[VIRGO cackles]

369
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,625
[LUCY screaming]

370
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,625
[VIRGO] And that means you've
been holding out on me!

371
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,833
How dare you!

372
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,166
You're a glutton for
punishment, aren't you?

373
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,083
I said louder! Cry for help!

374
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,125
You're pathetic!

375
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,833
I'm not gonna
watch this anymore!

376
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:25,375
[NATSU]
Lucy! Snap out of it, c'mon!

377
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,791
[VIRGO] Come back later, you
can have her once I'm through.

378
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,041
[NATSU]
You'll pay for this.

379
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,166
[HAPPY]
Why're you being so mean?

380
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,958
Can't see a thing!
What's goin' on?

381
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,625
It's burning through my eyelids!

382
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,541
Golden light.

383
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,875
[LUCY]
No way! Are they all here?

384
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,125
Aries?

385
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,000
Taurus!

386
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,041
Gemini.

387
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,041
Cancer?

388
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,916
Sagittarius!

389
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,750
Scorpio!

390
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,750
Capricorn?

391
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,875
Aquarius?

392
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,833
[NATSU]
Why do they look so different?

393
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,583
[HAPPY] I guess
whatever freakified Virgo

394
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,541
got ahold of them too.

395
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,166
Greetings, old master.

396
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,250
We thank you for
that introduction.

397
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:17,416
We also ask that you excuse us
for our ill-mannered entrance.

398
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,375
We weren't plannin'
to beat you up till later.

399
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,583
She's not right.

400
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,625
[NATSU] Okay spill it,
why do you all look so weird?

401
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,666
[LOKE] Perhaps we once
took on forms designed

402
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,166
to please you humans,
but no more.

403
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,166
Loke. Is that you?

404
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,208
[LOKE]
Loke?

405
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,750
Is that what you
used to call me back

406
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,375
when I was one of
your pet spirits?

407
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:38,708
Hear me well.

408
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,166
I am as through with that
name as I am with you.

409
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,500
[HAPPY] Did you really
just snub Lucy's love?

410
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,416
That's crazy, I mean you've
been hittin' on her for years!

411
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,333
[LOKE]
Silence, cat. I am Leo the Lion.

412
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,833
The Leo she tamed with a
key and a whip is no more.

413
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,541
In light of this new reality,

414
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:55,916
I'm free.

415
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,458
The contract I once
signed with you is void.

416
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,000
[LUCY gasps]

417
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,166
[LOKE] That goes for each
of us. We serve ourselves now.

418
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,208
[SAGITTARIUS] We lured you
here in order to inform you

419
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,333
of the termination
of our contracts.

420
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,250
[AQUARIUS] That fake job
flier we made tricked you

421
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,708
pretty good, huh?

422
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,416
[TAURUS] We decided to let
you see your utter inability

423
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,125
to control us for yourself.

424
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,458
[NATSU]
Wait.

425
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,791
So was that Sea Slug
attack a part of your plan?

426
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,125
[AQUARIUS]
Sure was!

427
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,875
We wanted to let you know
that you can't call us

428
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,750
to do your dirty work,
even with those golden keys.

429
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:25,625
Teehee!

430
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,375
Please. No.

431
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,208
It's so creepy when she
tries to act cute like that.

432
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,958
Can we talk about this?

433
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,208
Listen, please.

434
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,958
I understand that you
don't remember making

435
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,583
your contracts with me.

436
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,250
But you did, and it was
because you wanted to!

437
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,916
[LUCY]
I was never your master.

438
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,875
I was your partner, your friend!

439
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,791
I still am. it's just
that you've forgotten!

440
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,708
Crying. My, what a pitifully
human sight to behold.

441
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,250
[LUCY]
Aquarius!

442
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,625
You and I have been together
since I was just a little girl.

443
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,166
My whole life.

444
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,083
And now you're saying
that you don't remember

445
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,250
anything about me?

446
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,125
Honestly, you don't
look too familiar!

447
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:04,083
I've moved on, Lady, you should
probably try to do the same.

448
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,541
Times are changing.

449
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,083
[TAURUS] Any more questions
before we take our leave?

450
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,666
This can't be.

451
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,791
Please at least try to remember!
You've been with me for so long.

452
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,500
Good times and bad, I was
never alone because of you.

453
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,083
I just. Want my friends back.

454
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,458
[AQUARIUS]
Think she means it?

455
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,916
[TAURUS] It matters not.
We've delivered our message.

456
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,833
It's not our fault if she
refuses to understand.

457
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,416
[AQUARIUS] Yeah, humans
are dense like that.

458
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,875
[LOKE] Well if the girl won't
be convinced by our words.

459
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,875
Then let's give
her a demonstration.

460
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,958
Let's prove our bond is broken.

461
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,333
[LUCY gasps]

462
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:42,791
The hell?

463
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,291
[HAPPY] Good thing you
got her outta there.

464
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,875
That blast was huge!

465
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:48,666
[LOKE]
Aquarius!

466
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,000
[AQUARIUS]
Okay!

467
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,666
You three look awful thirsty!

468
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,458

My aim is true.

00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,875
[TAURUS] Yes. If you'd
be so kind as to leave.

474
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,458
[ALL screaming]

475
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:06,458
Virgo.

476
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,958
[VIRGO]
This'll be fun. Let's go!

477
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,208
[NATSU grunting]

478
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,458
[LUCY, HAPPY]
Natsu!

479
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,333
That'll do.

480
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,291
'Kay. I'm fired up now!

481
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,791
Wait, Natsu!

482
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,958
I know they're acting like
jerks, but it isn't their fault.

483
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,833
they're just not themselves.

484
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,333
If we could
somehow find a way

485
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:23,791
to bring their memories back.

486
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,333
They'd stop.

487
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,625
I've got an idea. Happy!

488
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:28,875
Keep an eye on Lucy!

489
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,041
[HAPPY]
Aye, Sir!

490
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,791
[SAGITTARIUS]
Where shall I stick them?

491
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,000
[HAPPY]
Oh no!!

492
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,125
[NATSU yells]

493
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,833
[HAPPY]
Natsu! Be careful, will ya?

494
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,416
Don't hurt them!
They're still our friends okay?!

495
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,291
Yeah. Don't worry 'bout it.

496
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,333
I'm just gonna pound on 'em
till they remember who I am!

497
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:46,958
Behold.

498
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,500
the raw power of a
celestial spirit unleashed!

499
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,875
Cool! Give me
everything ya got!

500
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,208
[NATSU] I'm kind of glad
this happened, Loke!

501
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:57,500
'Cause I still owe yo two
whacks from awhile back!

502
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,541
[LOKE] Are you saying
I've defeated you before?

503
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:03,000
[NATSU] No you sucker-punched
me, doesn't count!

504
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,750
[LOKE]
Ha! You'll have to hit harder

505
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,916
than that to put
a dent in my armor.

506
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,541
[NATSU] Look man.
I'm sure it's good armor,

507
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:12,083
but is it worth lookin'
that dumb, Loke?

508
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,625
That's not my name!

509
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,916
[AQUARIUS]
Points for hanging in there.

510
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,250
But Leo's gonna tear him apart.

511
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,750
[SAGITTARIUS]
Well, he's only human.

512
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,958
[LOKE] It's time to give up,
because you're beaten.

513
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:26,166
No mere mortal can defeat an
unshackled celestial spirit.

514
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,791
[NATSU]
Cut it out with the braggin'!

515
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,916
It ain't like you, Loke!

516
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,291
I told you not
to use that name!

517
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,833
[LOKE] This taste of freedom
has left us craving more.

518
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,708
Complete freedom will be ours.

519
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:39,958
[NATSU]
What?

520
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,166
[LOKE] There's no point
in explaining it to you.

521
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,791
It is something far
beyond your comprehension!

522
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,416
[NATSU grunting]

523
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,541
[NATSU]
Let me down, Happy!

524
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,208
I had him right
where I wanted him.

525
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,625
Who's side are you on, cat?

526
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:52,958
[HAPPY]
You eat too much.

527
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,125
My little arms are
gonna pop right off.

528
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,833
He says they want
"complete freedom." But.

529
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:03,166
[LUCY] Weren't they free
already? What does he mean?

530
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,666
[HAPPY] You're like
two sacks of bricks.

531
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:12,916
[NARRATOR] The celestial
world's current state.

532
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,333
[AQUARIUS] Lame! I can't
believe we let 'em escape.

533
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,208
We totally had 'em too!

534
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,208
[TAURUS] Ignoring the
winged cat was a mistake

535
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,541
for they couldn't have
retreated without him.

536
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:26,916
[SAGITTARIUS] Their escape
does complicate things.

537
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
[LOKE]
We'll deal with them later.

538
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,083
In the meantime, there
are more pressing matters

539
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:32,583
that require our attention.

540
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:38,791
[LOKE] There are many tasks
and obsticles before us.

541
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:41,375
They'll forge the
path to freedom.

542
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:15,041
[HAPPY] Okay! Time to
buckle down and research

543
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,250
why the celestial
spirits got so weird!

544
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:19,125
[NATSU]
Perfect! That's my specialty!

545
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,375
[HAPPY] I said
"research," not "rampage."

546
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:23,666
[NATSU] Hey, for all you
know I could be a natural!

547
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,583
Ain't no tellin'
till I give it a try.

548
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:28,083
[HAPPY] This is how all your
great failures begin, Natsu.

549
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,250
[NATSU]
Just you wait!

550
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:30,833
I'll tear this book
apart in three sec--

551
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:33,833
[HAPPY]
Wow, knocked him right out.

552
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:36,208
[NATSU, HAPPY]
Next Time: Library Panic!

553
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:39,208
[NATSU] Ah, crap! Did I
just get KO'd by a book?

554
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:41,250
[HAPPY] Yup. Still
think you're a natural?
