1
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:19,958
- HEY, GUYS, READY FOR 
SOME MORE "FAIRY TAIL"?

2
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,666
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING,

3
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,333
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE ROOM.

4
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:26,333
AND DON'T SIT TOO CLOSE
TO THE TV.

5
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:28,958
- Happy:
PREVIOUSLY ON "FAIRY TAIL"...

6
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:31,625
- Natsu: S-CLASS!
WE'RE GOING BIG TIME.

7
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:33,958
- Happy: WE CAME TO GALUNA
ISLAND ON AN S-CLASS QUEST

8
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,000
WITHOUT THE GUILD'S PERMISSION.

9
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,958
GRAY AND ERZA TRIED TO STOP US,

10
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,250
BUT THEY ENDED UP
GETTING INVOLVED.

11
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,333
WE DEFEATED THE DEMON DELIORA,

12
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,208
BUT NOW WE'VE GOT
A BIGGER PROBLEM.

13
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,666
- THE MOON!
IT MUST BE WIPED FROM THE SKY!

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,125
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

15
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,750
- NATSU, WE'RE GOING
TO DESTROY THE MOON.

16
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,583
- REALLY?!
- HUH?!

17
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,416
- IT'S THE ONLY WAY
WE CAN CHANGE

18
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,458
THE VILLAGERS BACK TO
THEIR HUMAN FORMS.

19
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,083
- ( all cheer )

20
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,625
- THEY'RE REALLY GONNA DO IT!

21
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,208
WE GET TO WATCH IT HAPPEN!

22
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,791
- THAT'S RIGHT.

23
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,625
AND WE'RE ALL FINALLY
GONNA BE HUMAN AGAIN!

24
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,333
- WHERE DO YOU WANNA GO?

25
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,166
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD CLIMB UP
TO THE TOP OF THE TEMPLE?

26
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,791
IT'S A LOT HIGHER UP THERE.

27
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,291
- WE'LL DO IT FROM HERE.

28
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,833
THE VILLAGERS CAN'T
GO NEAR THE TEMPLE,

29
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,375
AND THEY NEED
TO WITNESS THIS.

30
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,333
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'S THINKING.

31
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:58,125
I MEAN, SHE CAN DO
SOME AMAZING THINGS, BUT STILL.

32
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,958
- SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK
SHE'S GONNA DO TO IT?

33
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:04,333
- THIS IS EXCITING, HUH?
- MORE LIKE TERRIFYING.

34
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,333
- ( Villagers chattering )

35
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,416
- THIS IS GIANT ARMOR.

36
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,625
IT INCREASES MY STRENGTH
AND ALLOWS ME TO THROW FARTHER.

37
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:12,791
AND THIS...

38
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,541
THIS IS THE SPEAR OF HAJA.
IT REPELS DARKNESS.

39
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,458
- Villagers: OHH...

40
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,375
- WHOA!  I SEE WHAT 
YOU'RE PLANNING NOW.

41
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:26,541
YOU'RE GONNA USE THAT SPEAR

42
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,000
TO KNOCK THE MOON
OUT OF THE SKY.

43
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,375
- Natsu, Lucy, Happy:
GIVE ME A BREAK.

44
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,916
THAT'S NEVER GONNA WORK.

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,541
- THAT'S RIGHT,
BUT I'M AFRAID I'LL NEED

46
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,000
MORE STRENGTH
THAN THIS ARMOR CAN GIVE ME.

47
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,833
SO NATSU, I'M GOING TO NEED TO
USE YOUR FIRE POWER AS A BOOST.

48
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,250
- HUH?

49
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,750
- WHENEVER I BEGIN 
TO THROW THE SPEAR,

50
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,958
I WANT YOU TO HIT
THE BACK OF IT WITH YOUR FLAMES.

51
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,416
- ( grunting )

52
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,666
- NOW I'LL HAVE TO TIME
OUR ATTACK PERFECTLY.

53
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,500
BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD GIVE ME
JUST ENOUGH POWER TO DO THE JOB.

54
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,916
- SOUNDS LIKE
A KILLER PLAN TO ME!

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,333
- THEN LET'S DO IT.

56
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,833
- WHOA...
- THEY DON'T REALLY THINK

57
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,666
THEY'RE GONNA
PULL THIS OFF, DO THEY?

58
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,333
- WELL, I THINK THEY'VE TOTALLY
GONE OFF THE DEEP END THIS TIME.

59
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,291
- ( Happy speaking )

60
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:25,791
- NOW!

61
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,541
- ( grunts )

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,333
- SHE DID IT!
- THIS IS BAD...

63
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,791
- WHAT ARE THEY THINKING?!

64
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,708
- ALMOST THERE!

65
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,833
- ( chattering excitedly )

66
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,291
- HA-HA-HA!

67
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,416
- ( all gasp )

68
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,041
( cheer )

69
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,833
- Both: NO WAY!

70
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,750
- ( all gasp )
- THE MOON... 

71
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:09,916
- IT'S STILL THERE.

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,375
- ( all murmuring )

73
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,833
- IT WASN'T THE MOON
THAT SHATTERED.

74
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,833
IT WAS THE SKY.

75
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,708
- ( gasps )

76
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,958
- WHAT THE HECK
IS GOING ON?

77
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,500
- AS A RESULT OF THE SPELL,

78
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,375
A NOXIOUS MEMBRANE WAS
COVERING THE ISLAND.

79
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,625
- A WHAT?

80
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,583
- THE MOON DRIP
RELEASED EVIL ENERGY

81
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,833
IN THE FORM OF A GAS.

82
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:35,666
THAT GAS CRYSTALLIZED,
AND FORMED AN INVISIBLE SHELL

83
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,666
IN THE SKY
THAT COVERED THE ISLAND.

84
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,625
THAT'S WHY THE MOON
LOOKED PURPLE HERE.

85
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:46,125
- ( all murmuring )

86
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,083
- NOW THAT THE SHELL
HAS BEEN BROKEN,

87
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:51,125
EVERYTHING WILL GO BACK
TO HOW IT WAS THREE YEARS AGO.

88
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,750
- ( all gasping, chattering )

89
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,583
- WHAT'S WRONG?
THEY'RE NOT TRANSFORMING.

90
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,125
- OH, NO.

91
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,000
- THAT'S BECAUSE THESE
ARE THEIR TRUE FORMS.

92
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,416
- ( gasps )

93
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,208
THE MOON DRIP NEVER HAD
ANY EFFECT ON THEIR APPEARANCE.

94
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,958
HOWEVER, IT SEEMS TO HAVE
ALTERED THEIR MEMORIES.

95
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,291
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- THEY THINK THEY'RE HUMANS

96
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,833
WHO HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED
INTO DEMONS.

97
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,708
BUT IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

98
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:12,958
- ( Happy and Lucy gasp )

99
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,375
- WAIT, SO YOU'RE SAYING...

100
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,708
THEY'RE REALLY...
- YEP, YOU'VE GOT IT.

101
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,250
- ( all scream )
- ( Villagers murmuring )

102
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,208
- THE VILLAGERS
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN DEMONS.

103
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,458
- AAH!

104
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,291
- AAH!

105
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,708
- HEY, IS THAT TRUE?
- WELL, MAYBE.

106
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,541
MY MEMORY'S HAZY.

107
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,958
WE ALL LOOKED PRETTY HUMAN 
WHEN YOU MET US, DIDN'T WE?

108
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:36,500
- YES, BECAUSE YOU POSSESS THE
ABILITY TO TAKE ON HUMAN FORMS.

109
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,416
YOUR FALSE MEMORIES
LED YOU TO BELIEVE...

110
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,416
THAT YOUR TEMPORARY STATES
WERE ACTUALLY YOUR TRUE FORMS.

111
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,500
IN REALITY, YOU WERE DEMONS
WHO HAD FALLEN VICTIM

112
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,583
TO THE MOON DRIP'S
SIDE EFFECTS.

113
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,208
- HOLD ON.

114
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,708
HOW COME LYON AND THE OTHERS
WEREN'T AFFECTED?

115
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,916
- I ASSUME IT'S BECAUSE
THEY'RE HUMAN.

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,666
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL,

117
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,458
DEMONS WERE THE ONLY ONES
SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE MEMORY LOSS.

118
00:06:57,541 --> 00:07:00,083
I KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON
AS SOON AS THE VILLAGERS TOLD ME

119
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,708
THEY WERE UNABLE TO GO
TO THE TEMPLE.

120
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,916
THE MOONLIGHT COLLECTED THERE
WAS SACRED,

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,750
THEREFORE CREATURES OF
DARKNESS COULDN'T GO NEAR IT.

122
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,041
- YOU'RE QUITE THE DETECTIVE!
- (gasps) 

123
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,708
- I KNEW I COULD TRUST YOU
AND YOUR FRIENDS.

124
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,125
- AAH!
- THANKS, WIZARDS.

125
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,583
I OWE YOU ONE.

126
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,041
- A GHOST!

127
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,875
- YOU'RE THE GUY FROM THE BOAT.

128
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,666
- ( gasps )

129
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,458
- ( gasps ) BOBO...

130
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,041
- BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE--

131
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,250
- GETTING STABBED IN THE CHEST
HURT PRETTY BAD,

132
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,208
BUT YOU GOTTA DO MORE
THAN THAT TO KILL A DEMON.

133
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,958
( laughs )

134
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:37,291
- BUT, ON THE BOAT, YOU JUST
DISAPPEARED INTO THIN AIR.

135
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,541
- AAH!

136
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,375
- I REALLY HOPE
YOU KIDS CAN FORGIVE ME

137
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,083
FOR NOT TELLING YOU
THE TRUTH SOONER.

138
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,083
- HE CAN FLY?

139
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,458
- I WAS THE ONLY ONE

140
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,958
WHO DIDN'T
HAVE ANY MEMORY LOSS.

141
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,208
I HAD TO LEAVE,
'CAUSE EVERYONE WENT NUTS.

142
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,625
I KNEW I WAS A DEMON,
BUT EVERYBODY ELSE-- 

143
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:53,291
SUDDENLY, THEY THOUGHT
THEY WERE CURSED HUMANS!

144
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,500
( laughs )
- WHA--?

145
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,791
OH, BOBO!

146
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,708
( crying )

147
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,583
BOBO!

148
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,875
- I'M SO GLAD YOU FINALLY
 SNAPPED OUT OF IT, POPS!

149
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,458
- ( all chattering excitedly )

150
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,208
- YOU'RE ALIVE!
- WE'VE GOT BOBO BACK!

151
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:19,041
- WE MISSED YOU!

152
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,666
- YEAH.
THEY ARE DEFINITELY DEMONS.

153
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,583
- I DON'T KNOW.
IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR FACES...

154
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,208
- MY SON IS ALIVE!

155
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:29,416
- ...THEY KINDA LOOK...

156
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,041
MORE LIKE ANGELS TO ME.

157
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,458
- HMM...

158
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,125
- ( chuckles )

159
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,666
- LET'S HAVE A FEAST TONIGHT
TO CELEBRATE!

160
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,208
IT'LL BE AN ALL-OUT DEMON PARTY!

161
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,416
- I DON'T KNOW IF I'M ROWDY 
ENOUGH TO PARTY WITH DEMONS.

162
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,666
- ME EITHER.

163
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,208
- ( all chattering )

164
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,208
- THIS IS SO GOOD!

165
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:59,166
- ( all chattering excitedly )

166
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,750
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING? YOU'RE
SURE LOOKING A LOT BETTER.

167
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:08,875
- DO I KNOW YOU?

168
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,875
- MAYBE THIS'LL HELP.

169
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,791
- ( ticking )

170
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,166
- ( bell dings ) 
- I REMEMBER YOU.

171
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,166
- I LOOK A LITTLE DIFFERENT
NOW, HUH?

172
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,166
- UH, YEAH.

173
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,041
- JUST SO YOU KNOW,

174
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,250
EVERY GIRL IN OUR VILLAGE 
HAS TOTALLY FALLEN FOR YOU,

175
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,625
'CAUSE WE THINK YOU'RE LIKE
THE COOLEST GUY EVER!

176
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:32,000
- YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT, WE THINK
YOU'RE SUPER AWESOME, GRAY.

177
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:35,000
- YOU PROBABLY THINK WE'RE CUTER
IN OUR HUMAN FORMS, DON'T YOU?

178
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:38,625
- NO, THAT'S NOT 
NECESSARILY TRUE.

179
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,500
I THINK YOU LADIES LOOK FINE
THE WAY YOU ARE.

180
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,250
- Girls: AAH!

181
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,458
- YOU'VE GOTTA BE THE SWEETEST
GUY I'VE EVER MET.

182
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,916
- YOU KNOW JUST WHAT
TO SAY TO A GIRL.

183
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,875
- LET'S HIT THE DANCE FLOOR,
AND WE'LL TEACH YOU

184
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,208
THE DEMON WIGGLE-WAGGLE!

185
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,041
- ( Village girls chattering )

186
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,583
- OKAY.

187
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,583
- IT LOOKS LIKE
SOMEONE'S GETTING A LOT

188
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,208
OF ATTENTION FROM THE LADIES.

189
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,208
- HE'LL SCARE THEM OFF
SOONER OR LATER.

190
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:02,166
- WELL, I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I WAS WRONG ABOUT HUMANS.

191
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,375
- HUH?

192
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,458
- ALL OF THESE YEARS,
WE'VE CHOSEN TO HIDE

193
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,125
FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

194
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,750
WE WERE SO AFRAID
THAT OTHERS

195
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,791
WOULD JUDGE US
BY OUR APPEARANCE.

196
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,416
- YOU KNOW THE CURSE?
THAT WAS JUST A RUMOR WE SPREAD

197
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,958
SO NO ONE WOULD COME TO
THE ISLAND AND BOTHER US.

198
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,375
- WELL, IT WORKED, 'CAUSE
THE SAILORS AT THE DOCK

199
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,208
WERE TERRIFIED.

200
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,666
NOBODY WANTED TO COME HERE.

201
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,708
- I KNOW,
AND IT'S A SHAME.

202
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,375
BUT AFTER MEETING YOU,
WE'VE CHANGED OUR MINDS.

203
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,208
YOU'VE RESTORED OUR FAITH
IN HUMANS,

204
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,875
AND NOW WE'RE NOT AFRAID.

205
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,916
WE'RE READY TO GO OUT
AND BEFRIEND PEOPLE

206
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,791
FROM OTHER LANDS.
- THAT'S GOOD.

207
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,000
FRIENDSHIP IS A BEAUTIFUL THING.

208
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,000
IT'S AN EMOTIONAL BOND
THAT TRANSCENDS

209
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,791
ONE'S PHYSICAL APPEARANCE.

210
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:43,291
- MM-HMM.
- ( chuckles )

211
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,250
- ( Villagers chattering )

212
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:50,416
- OHH.  ARE YOU REALLY
GONNA GO DOWN THERE?

213
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,750
- I HAVE NO CHOICE.
IT WOULDN'T BE RIGHT

214
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,666
TO LEAVE THINGS THE WAY
THEY ARE NOW.

215
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,083
YOU JUST STAY HERE
WITH COLD EMPEROR LYON, OKAY?

216
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,833
- ( growls )

217
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:02,458
- WE HAVE TO DO THIS.
IT'S ALL IN THE NAME OF LOVE.

218
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,083
- ( Villagers
chattering happily )

219
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,125
- UH-OH.
- HUH?

220
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,666
- OH, NO, NOT AGAIN.

221
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,375
- IT'S THE COLD EMPEROR'S
MINIONS.

222
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,916
- ( all murmuring )
- WHAT DO WE DO?

223
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,958
- DON'T WORRY,
I'LL TAKE CARE OF 'EM.

224
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:41,958
- ( gasps )

225
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,208
- HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

226
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,041
- YOU FAIRY TAILERS ARE TOUGH.

227
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,500
THE COLD EMPEROR'S SO BANGED UP,

228
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,083
HE COULDN'T EVEN MAKE IT
DOWN HERE.

229
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,958
- THAT'S WHY WE'VE COME
TO PAY YOU A VISIT

230
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,000
IN HIS PLACE.

231
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,416
- WAIT JUST A MINUTE!

232
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,916
I THOUGHT WE WERE COOL.

233
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,500
DIDN'T LYON TELL YOU GUYS
WHAT HAPPENED?

234
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,500
- YES, BUT THAT DOESN'T
MATTER TO US.

235
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,833
- WE WANTED TO SETTLE THINGS
WITH YOU OURSELVES.

236
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,666
- ALL RIGHT, WHY DON'T YOU
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT?

237
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,833
- WAIT, NATSU!

238
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,208
THANKS FOR THE HELP,

239
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,750
BUT WE CAN'T KEEP
RELYING ON YOU,

240
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,083
SO LET US FIGHT 'EM.
- HE'S RIGHT.

241
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,583
WE GOT THESE CLOWNS.

242
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:17,625
- IF WE WANNA KEEP
 OUR VILLAGE SAFE,

243
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,125
WE'VE GOTTA PROTECT IT.

244
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,125
- NORMALLY I WOULD
AGREE WITH YOU, GENTLEMEN.

245
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,541
BUT I THINK IT'S BEST
THAT I HANDLE THIS ONE.

246
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,208
- WE MEET AGAIN,
TITANIA OF FAIRY TAIL.

247
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,000
YOU GAVE DEAR ANGELICA
QUITE A BEATING EARLIER.

248
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,916
- SHE SEEMS LIKE
A FORMIDABLE OPPONENT.

249
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,125
- WATCH OUT FOR
THAT CREEPY CHICK!

250
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,625
SHE CAN CONTROL
INANIMATE OBJECTS.

251
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,458
- AND DON'T EVEN BOTHER
TRYING TO USE YOUR MAGIC

252
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,791
AGAINST OL' MEGABROWS.

253
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,416
- IS THAT SO?

254
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,750
IN THAT CASE,

255
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,833
I'LL DO IT
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY!

256
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,083
HA!
- ( gasps )

257
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,416
- ( grunting )
- ( grunts )

258
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,541
- ( Villagers murmuring )

259
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:58,916
- HOLY...

260
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,750
- SHE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
TO USE ANY MAGIC.

261
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,750
- THAT'S THE GREAT ERZA
FOR YA.

262
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,250
- WOULD YOU CUT THAT OUT?

263
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,125
- ( groaning )

264
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,125
YOU'RE TRULY
AN AMAZING WARRIOR.

265
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,750
- ( exhales )
NO KIDDING.

266
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,583
WE'RE NO MATCH FOR YOU.
- ( exhales )

267
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,291
- UH-- WAIT.

268
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,541
SO YOU'RE NOT HERE
TO ATTACK US?

269
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,166
- I DOUBT THIS IS
 GOING TO MAKE UP

270
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,375
FOR ALL THE TROUBLE
WE'VE CAUSED YOU.

271
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:25,083
BUT WE WANTED TO
APOLOGIZE IN PERSON.

272
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:28,291
- OH, SO YOU GUYS CAME HERE
TO SETTLE THINGS IN A GOOD WAY.

273
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:32,083
- THE COLD EMPEROR 
TOLD US EVERYTHING.

274
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,500
THANKS TO YOU, WE CAN
FINALLY LET GO OF THE PAIN

275
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,583
DELIORA CAUSED US 
SO MANY YEARS AGO.

276
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,416
- YOU MEAN YOU WERE VICTIMS
OF DELIORA TOO?

277
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,250
- WHEN WE WERE CHILDREN,
THE MONSTER RAVAGED OUR VILLAGE.

278
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:46,083
WE WATCHED IT MURDER
ALL OF OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

279
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,291
- THE COLD EMPEROR
HAD A PLAN

280
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,708
TO KILL THE DEMON
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

281
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,375
THAT'S WHY WE JOINED HIM.

282
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,916
- YOU SEE, WE WANTED REVENGE.

283
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,708
AND WE WERE SO FOCUSED
ON GETTING IT,

284
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,375
WE NEVER REALIZED
WE WERE HURTING INNOCENT PEOPLE.

285
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,875
- WE WERE SO BLINDED
BY OUR HATRED,

286
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,583
THAT WE ENDED UP ACTING
NO BETTER THAN THE DEMON ITSELF.

287
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,208
FROM NOW ON, WE'LL TREAT
OTHER PEOPLE WITH RESPECT.

288
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,000
AND LOVE.

289
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,166
- Natsu: ALL RIGHTY, THEN!
- ( gasps )

290
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,458
- ( chuckles )
YOU GUYS SHOULD STICK AROUND,

291
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,250
AND JOIN IN ON THE FEAST!
HUH?

292
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,208
- BUT WE WERE ENEMIES
A SECOND AGO.

293
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,833
- I DON'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA,

294
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,708
BECAUSE I'M TRYING
TO WATCH MY FIGURE AND--

295
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,166
( gasps )
- ENOUGH WITH THE EXCUSES.

296
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,916
LIVE A LITTLE, WOULD YOU?!

297
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,416
OKAY, NOW I'M READY TO PARTY!

298
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,916
- ( all murmuring )

299
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,041
- WERE YOU ABLE TO SEE
ALL OF THAT, SIR?

300
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,666
- YES.  WHY DID YOU 
RESTORE THE VILLAGE?

301
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,125
- 'CAUSE I'M NICE.

302
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,416
- SOME MIGHT SAY TOO NICE.

303
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,791
YOU'D BETTER LEAVE
BEFORE THEY FIND YOU.

304
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,416
THOSE FAIRY TAIL WIZARDS--

305
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,166
THEY COULD POSE QUITE A THREAT
WERE THEY TO GET IN OUR WAY.

306
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,666
- HEH.

307
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,041
( chuckles )

308
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,500
THAT'S TRUE.

309
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,625
- WHERE'D EYEBROWS 
AND "LOVE" GIRL GO?

310
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,083
- LIKE TYPICAL PARTY GUESTS,

311
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,166
THEY STUFFED THEIR FACES
AND TOOK OFF.

312
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,666
- HMM...

313
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,500
I THINK IT'S GONNA
LEAVE A SCAR.

314
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,166
- WHATEVER, IT DOESN'T
MATTER TO ME.

315
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,541
- ON YOUR FACE?

316
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,250
- I DON'T MIND
HAVING A FEW SCARS,

317
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,000
AS LONG AS I CAN SEE 'EM.

318
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,208
IT'S THE ONES YOU CAN'T SEE
THAT STING.

319
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,166
- WELL, AREN'T YOU
A SMOOTH TALKER?

320
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,666
- SO YOU'VE GOT INVISIBLE SCARS?

321
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,208
- SHUT UP, NATSU!

322
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,208
EVERY TIME I SAY SOMETHING COOL,
YOU GOTTA RUIN IT!

323
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,916
- HOW WAS THAT COOL?

324
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,250
- WHAT?

325
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,833
BUT MISS, YOU DESERVE
THE REWARD,

326
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,500
SO TAKE IT.  PLEASE.

327
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,833
- THANK YOU.

328
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,750
BUT YOUR GRATITUDE
IS PAYMENT ENOUGH.

329
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,166
- THAT'S NICE, BUT YOU SHOULD
TAKE THE MONEY.

330
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,666
- I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT
A FLAMING IDIOT LIKE YOU

331
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,166
WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT I WAS SAYING. 

332
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,458
- I CAN'T BECAUSE YOUR REQUEST
WAS NEVER

333
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,833
OFFICIALLY ACCEPTED
BY THE GUILD.

334
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,250
IT FELL INTO THE HANDS OF
FOOLISH WIZARDS

335
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,791
TRYING TO PROVE THEMSELVES.
- ( laughs )

336
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,541
FOOLISH AS THEY MAY BE,

337
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,833
IF IT WASN'T FOR THEM,
WE NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SAVED.

338
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,666
WHAT IF I GIVE YOU THE MONEY
NOT AS A REWARD,

339
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,291
BUT INSTEAD
AS A THANK-YOU GIFT?

340
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,958
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO
AFTER EVERYTHING

341
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,416
YOU'VE DONE FOR OUR VILLAGE.

342
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:29,083
- WHEN YOU PUT IT THAT WAY,
YOU MAKE IT HARD TO SAY NO.

343
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,791
- ( chuckles )

344
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,250
- SHE'S REALLY GONNA TAKE IT!

345
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,250
- WE'RE RICH!

346
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,416
I'M SORRY.

347
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,583
ACCEPTING YOUR REWARD
WOULD BE CONTRARY

348
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,000
TO OUR GUILD'S PRINCIPLES.

349
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:41,166
HOWEVER, WE'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE
THE GATE KEY YOU OFFERED

350
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,250
ALONG WITH IT.

351
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,541
- THE GATE KEY?!

352
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:44,958
- COME TO MAMA!

353
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:48,166
- WELL, AT LEAST LET ME TAKE YOU
BACK TO HARGEON.

354
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,375
- THANK YOU.

355
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,125
BUT I HAVE
A BOAT WAITING, SIR.

356
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,500
- HUH?

357
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,666
- A PIRATE SHIP?

358
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,791
- YOU KIDDING ME!
DID SHE HIJACK IT?!

359
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,125
- THIS IS AWESOME.

360
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,958
- AHOY, ME BEAUTY!
- ( all cheering )

361
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,166
- "ME BEAUTY"? 
- THAT'S RIGHT.

362
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,791
THEY'VE BECOME
QUITE FOND OF ME.

363
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,416
- THAT'S THE GREAT ERZA FOR YA!

364
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,250
- JEEZ, YOU'RE SUCH A SUCK-UP.

365
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,291
- AHOY!  COME ABOARD ME SHIP,
MATEYS!

366
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,333
- MATEYS?

367
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,750
- I DON'T WANNA!

368
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,125
I'M NOT RIDING
THAT CREEPY BOAT!

369
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,833
- IF YOU WANNA SWIM,
I'LL JOIN YOU.

370
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,458
- ARE YOU INSANE?!

371
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,666
- WEIGH ANCHOR!
WE'RE SHOVIN' OFF!

372
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,583
- Pirates: AYE AYE, SIR!

373
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,458
- ( Villagers chattering )

374
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,375
- WE THANK YOU!

375
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:33,083
HOPE YOU GUYS
WILL COME BACK SOMEDAY!

376
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:37,666
- YEAH, YOU BETCHA!
( laughs )

377
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,291
- SO LONG!
- Girl: HOPE WE GET TO DO

378
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,500
THE DEMON WIGGLE-WAGGLE AGAIN,
GRAY!

379
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,333
- GOOD LUCK BACK AT THE GUILD.

380
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,208
- FAIRY TAIL'S THE BEST!

381
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:48,000
- COME BACK AND SEE US
SOMETIME!

382
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,625
- YOU KNOW,
THEY WEREN'T SO BAD.

383
00:17:56,708 --> 00:18:00,666
- GUYS, I'M NOT CRYING.
I GOT SOMETHING IN MY EYE.

384
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,166
- OH, YEAH?
YOU COULD HAVE FOOLED ME.

385
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,375
- ARE YOU OKAY, LYON?

386
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,208
YOU NEVER GOT THE CHANCE TO SAY
GOOD-BYE TO YOUR FRIEND.

387
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,375
AND GIVE HIM YOUR LOVE.

388
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,708
- IT'S FINE.

389
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:19,791
YOU TWO WERE IN A GUILD ONCE.

390
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,166
WHAT'S IT LIKE?

391
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,791
- IT'S QUITE A SHAME
THAT DELIORA DIDN'T WORK OUT.

392
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,250
- YES, IT IS UNFORTUNATE.

393
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:39,125
BUT WE HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING
THE DEMON WAS ALREADY DEAD.

394
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,208
C'EST LA VIE.

395
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,833
IT'S A RELATIVELY MINOR
SETBACK;

396
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,291
I'LL BE MORE THOROUGH
NEXT TIME.

397
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,916
- PLEASE FORGIVE ME,
SIEGRAIN, SIR.

398
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,333
I HAD NO IDEA THAT WENCH'S
MAGIC WAS SO POWERFUL.

399
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,708
- YOU SHOULDN'T SPEAK ABOUT
YOUR MOTHER THAT WAY.

400
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:55,833
DON'T CAUSE UR
TO SHED ANOTHER TEAR.

401
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:59,250
SHE WAS A MAGNIFICENT WIZARD
WHO WAS GREATLY ADMIRED.

402
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:02,083
IN FACT, I THINK, IF SHE WERE
STILL ALIVE TODAY,

403
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,333
SHE WOULD BE COUNTED AMONG
THE TEN WIZARD SAINTS.

404
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,125
- YOU GIVE HER
FAR TOO MUCH CREDIT.

405
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,958
MY MOTHER LOVED HER MAGIC
AND NOTHING ELSE.

406
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,833
IT'S NO WONDER MY FATHER
ABANDONED THE WRETCH.

407
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,458
- THEY SAY THE GREATER THE LOSS
A PERSON SUFFERS,

408
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:17,875
THE STRONGER THEY MUST BECOME
TO TRIUMPH OVER IT.

409
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:21,500
- I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT MY MOTHER
EVER FELT I WAS A GREAT LOSS.

410
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,291
- HMM, YOU NEVER KNOW.

411
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,708
WHAT IF SHE TOOK ON
THOSE STUDENTS

412
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,708
TO FILL THE VOID
YOU LEFT BEHIND?

413
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,916
- COULD WE PLEASE
CHANGE THE SUBJECT?

414
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,125
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US
TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT STAGE.

415
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,291
- URTEAR, YOUR FACE.

416
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,500
WHAT HAPPENED?

417
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:36,750
- WOW!

418
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,916
- THAT IDIOT NATSU PUNCHED ME!
- ( laughing )

419
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,666
THAT CERTAINLY IS
A DELAYED REACTION.

420
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,208
-SO HOW WAS HE?

421
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,041
DID YOU FIND HIM TO BE
A WORTHY OPPONENT?

422
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:49,083
- I NEVER HAD TO USE MORE THAN
 HALF OF MY POWER AGAINST HIM.

423
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,583
BUT I WAS IMPRESSED.

424
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:54,083
IT SEEMS HE'S GETTING STRONGER
WITH EACH PASSING DAY.

425
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,041
- I'M NOT SURPRISED.

426
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,958
HE IS IGNEEL'S SON.

427
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:03,583
TO REALIZE MY DREAM, HE MUST
CONTINUE BURNING BRIGHTLY.

428
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,291
- WE'RE HOME!

429
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,708
- AYE, SIR!

430
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,291
- I'M BUMMED.

431
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,541
ALL THAT TIME AND HARD WORK
FOR SOME LOUSY GATE KEY.

432
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,125
- YEAH, AND THAT S-CLASS REWARD
WAS BIG TIME MONEY.

433
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,541
- WELL, I'M SORRY,
BUT IT WASN'T AN OFFICIAL JOB.

434
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,375
JUST BE GLAD YOU GOT SOMETHING.

435
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,625
- SHE'S GOT A POINT.
NOW QUIT YOUR COMPLAINING.

436
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,250
- THAT'S PRETTY EASY
FOR YOU TO SAY,

437
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,458
YOU GOT A REWARD!

438
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:28,875
CAN WE SELL IT?

439
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,666
- HOW COULD YOU
EVEN SUGGEST THAT, HAPPY?!

440
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,791
YOU GUYS JUST DON'T GET IT.
THEY'RE HARD TO COME BY.

441
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,791
SURE, THERE ARE LOTS OF
SILVER GATE KEYS,

442
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,208
BUT THERE ARE ONLY
TWELVE GOLD ZODIAC KEYS.

443
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,083
AND I'M LUCKY ENOUGH
TO HAVE FIVE.

444
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,291
- HMM, IT'S TOO BAD
 THEY'RE ALL CRAZY.

445
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,125
- YOU HAD BETTER WATCH
 YOUR MOUTH, YOU PUNK!

446
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,583
ME AND MY CELESTIAL SPIRITS

447
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,416
ARE GONNA BE STRONGER
THAN YOU SOMEDAY!

448
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,416
- SO, WHICH ONE OF THE ZODIAC
 KEYS DID YOU END UP GETTING?

449
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,583
- IT'S SAGITTARIUS THE CENTAUR!

450
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,625
- IT'S A HORSE MAN?!

451
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,916
- WELL, YEAH,
BUT IT'S MORE LIKE THIS...

452
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,291
- YO, WHAT'S UP?
I'M SAGITTARIUS!

453
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,833
- AND THAT IS NOT 
EVEN CLOSE, DUMMY.

454
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,666
- YOU'RE ALL SO CAREFREE.

455
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,333
IT'S ALMOST AS IF
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN 

456
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,500
YOU FACE PUNISHMENT
WHEN WE GET BACK TO THE GUILD.

457
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,416
- ( all gasp )
- BUT WHY?

458
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,083
- EVERYTHING WORKED OUT
IN THE END!

459
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,208
CAN'T WE JUST FORGET
THE WHOLE PUNISHMENT THING?

460
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,666
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
EVERYTHING WORKED OUT.

461
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,333
BUT ONLY BECAUSE I CAME HERE
AND FINISHED THE JOB

462
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,083
NONE OF YOU WERE
QUALIFIED TO DO.

463
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,750
STEALING AN S-CLASS REQUEST
IS A SERIOUS OFFENSE.

464
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,416
- All: HUH?!
- WE SAID WE'RE SORRY.

465
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,041
- IF YOU PROMISE THAT
YOU'LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN,

466
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:29,291
THEN I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO
BE PENALIZED BY THE GUILD.

467
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,708
UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T HAVE
ANY SAY IN THE MATTER.

468
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,916
YOUR FATE IS IN
MASTER MAKAROV'S HANDS.

469
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,375
SO I'M SURE YOU'LL BE
FACING PUNISHMENT.

470
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,875
- NOW I'M SCARED.

471
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:40,125
YOU THINK HE'S GONNA
MAKE US DO THAT?

472
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,750
- JUST KILL ME NOW!

473
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,958
I DON'T THINK I COULD LIVE
THROUGH THAT AGAIN!

474
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,625
- YOU GUYS ARE FREAKING ME OUT!
- DON'T LET 'EM SCARE YOU.

475
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,458
I'LL TALK THE OLD MAN
OUTTA PUNISHING US.

476
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,416
THAT GUY LOVES ME.

477
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,208
- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
SHOULD DO THE TALKING.

478
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,291
- NATSU...

479
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,000
YOU CAN'T TALK YOUR WAY
OUT OF THIS ONE.

480
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,208
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

481
00:21:56,291 --> 00:22:00,208
( chuckling )

482
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,708
- NO!  SAVE ME!

483
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,125
- ( Gray shuddering )
- Natsu: NOT THAT!

484
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,333
ANYTHING BUT THAT!
NO!

485
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:09,375
- WOULD SOMEBODY PLEASE
TELL ME WHAT "THAT" IS?

486
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:13,000
I'M TOTALLY FREAKING OUT!

487
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,791
- ( end theme playing )

488
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

489
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:51,041
- PROFESSOR HAPPY'S CLASS
ABOUT FAIRY TAIL!

490
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,916
FOR TODAY'S LESSON,
I'LL TEACH YOU

491
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,166
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
OUR OTHER FAIRY TAIL MEMBERS.

492
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,000
OUR GUILD IS LED
BY MASTER MAKAROV,

493
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,833
AND SOMETIMES IT CAN
GET PRETTY CRAZY.

494
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:00,458
IT'S FULL OF
ALL KINDS OF WIZARDS

495
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,875
WHO PRACTICE DIFFERENT
TYPES OF MAGIC. YAY!

496
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,541
THEY FIGHT CONSTANTLY,
BUT DEEP DOWN

497
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:06,958
THEY'RE GOOD FRIENDS
WHO CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER.

498
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,583
WELL, THAT'S TODAY'S CLASS.

499
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:10,708
DISMISSED!  AYE!

500
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:14,791
- YOU'RE LUCKY.
I WISH I COULD FLY.

501
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,541
THINGS WOULD BE
SO MUCH EASIER.

502
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,750
- AYE. IT'D BE
AWESOME IF WE COULD

503
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,416
SOMEHOW SWAP MAGIC
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

504
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,833
I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE
TO BREATHE FIRE LIKE YOU.

505
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:24,833
- YOU MAY BE ON TO SOMETHING.

506
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:27,041
YOU THINK THERE'S A SPELL
FOR THAT LYING AROUND?

507
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:30,125
- UH, I DON'T THINK WE HAVE
SPELLS JUST LYING AROUND.

508
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,833
- ( Happy and Natsu speaking )

509
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:34,458
- Happy: YOU KNOW,
I THINK THERE IS A SPELL

510
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:35,791
THAT ALLOWS WIZARDS
TO SWAP POWERS.

511
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,125
- ( Natsu laughs )

512
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:39,208
REALLY?!  COOL!
WHAT'S IT CALLED?

513
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:41,000
- STUPID SHORT-TERM MEMORY...
