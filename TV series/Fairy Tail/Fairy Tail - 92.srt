WHEW, I DON'T KNOW HOW

3
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:22,541
WE DID IT, BUT WE
MANAGED TO STOP

GIVE ME A LITTLE CREDIT.

00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,291
THINGS WORKED OUT
'CAUSE I SHOWED UP.

7
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,291
- Natsu : YEAH, IT HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE REST OF US.

8
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,541
- Happy:
THEN I WANT CREDIT, TOO!

9
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:31,875
I SAVED YOU, REMEMBER?

10
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:34,083
I ALMOST BROKE MY BACK
'CAUSE YOU WEIGH A TON!

WHEN ALL YOU HAD TO DO
WAS CARRY ME?

STANDOFF WITH KNIGHTWALKER.

- ( screams )

43
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,291
- OW!
- THEY FOUND US.

44
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,625
- ( Happy speaking )

45
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,250
- JEEZ, IT'S LIKE THEY'RE
COMING OUT OF THE WOODWORK.

46
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,250
- THEY'VE GOT
US SURROUNDED, LUCY.

47
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,125
- I GUESS WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO FIGHT 'EM.

48
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:02,791
- Gray:
STAY BACK!

49
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:07,833
- Carla:
STOP SHOOTING AT US!

50
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,250
- WHY DO THEY KEEP FIRING
AT HAPPY AND CARLA?

51
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,916
- Soldier #1:
ALL OF THE ESCAPING EXCEEDS

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,125
HAVE BEEN CAPTURED AND TURNED
INTO LACRIMAS.

53
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,000
- Soldier #1:
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF YOU TWO.

54
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:20,458
NOW SURRENDER, AND BECOME
MAGIC POWER FOR OUR KINGDOM.

55
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,250
- THE EXCEEDS ARE LIVING BEINGS,
JUST LIKE US.

56
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,666
ARE YOU SO OBSESSED
WITH GAINING POWER

57
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,166
THAT YOU DON'T CARE
WHAT HAPPENS TO 'EM?

58

- ( screams )

59
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,750
- Gray:
YOU PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD

60
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,166
NEED TO LEARN SOME LESSONS
ABOUT LIFE!

61
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,791
YOU CAN'T KILL SOMEONE
TO TAKE WHAT THEY HAVE.

62
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,125
NOT ON MY WATCH!

63
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,208
- Lucy: WE HAVE TO
HELP SAVE THE EXCEEDS.

64
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,583
ON MY WAY BACK HERE
I MET WITH GAJEEL.

65
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,583
HE TOLD ME THE ROYAL ARMY'S
CAPTURING THEM

66
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:47,833
AND TURNING THEM INTO LACRIMAS.

67
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,333
- WHO'S GAJEEL?

68
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,916
WAIT, YOU MEAN THAT REPORTER?

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,041
- HE'S KIND OF A CREEP.
BUT I'VE GOT TO ADMIT,

70
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,583
HIS INFORMATION'S
ALWAYS ACCURATE.

71
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,500
- LISTEN UP!
WE HAVE TO HELP THEM.

72
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,500
THE EXCEEDS AND THE EARTH LAND
FAIRY TAILERS

73
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:00,750
ARE IN SERIOUS DANGER.

74
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,708
THE ROYAL ARMY WANTS
TO WIPE THEM OUT

75
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,666
AND TAKE OVER THIS WORLD!

76
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,291
COME ON, WE CAN'T JUST SIT BACK
AND LET THAT HAPPEN, CAN WE?

77
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,666
- WELL, NO.
BUT THE ROYAL ARMY

78
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,916
HAS ALL KINDS OF MAGIC POWER
AT THEIR DISPOSAL NOW.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,500
WE DON'T STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST THEM, IF YOU ASK ME.

80
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,958
- HE'S RIGHT.
WE'VE HAD A HARD ENOUGH TIME

81
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,208
DEALING WITH THEM
WITHOUT ANY ADDED POWER.

82
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:23,791
LOOK, I HATE TO BE A DOWNER,
BUT THEY WOULD PULVERIZE US.

83
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:32,291
- HEAVEN'S WHEEL,
TRINITY SWORD!

84
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,625
- GRAVITY HOLE!

85
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,166
- BLUE CRIMSON!

86
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,791
- REEQUIP!

87
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,208
MORNING STAR...
PHOTON SLICER!

88
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,208
- RUNE SAVE!

89
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,166
- SHE CUT RIGHT THROUGH
MY ATTACK!

90
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,083
SILFERION!

91
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,583
- ( screams )

92
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,666
- I'VE GOT YOU NOW!

93
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:18,791
NO!

94
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,208
- I KNOW!  WHY DON'T WE
JUST WAIT UNTIL THE ROYAL ARMY

95
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,541
AND THE EXCEEDS ARE
DONE FIGHTING.

96
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,250
THAT'S THE PERFECT TIME
TO ATTACK

97
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,750
'CAUSE THEY'LL BE EXHAUSTED,
YOU KNOW?

98
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:31,875
WE COULD SWOOP IN
AND GIVE THEM

99
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,375
A PROPER FAIRY TAIL THRASHING!

100
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,958
- I HAVE TO ADMIT,
THAT IS A BRILLIANT IDEA, DROY.

101
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,250
AFTER ALL, THEY SAY
IT'S BEST TO STRIKE

102
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,500
WHILE THE IRON'S HOT, RIGHT?

103
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,625
PERHAPS WE SHOULD COZY UP
TO THE ROYAL ARMY.

104
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,541
THIS IS OUR ONLY CHANCE.

105
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,250
IF WE SIDE WITH THEM
THEN THEY'LL BE INDEBTED TO US.

106
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:49,333
AND THEY WOULD NO LONGER
SEE US AS THEIR ENEMY.

107
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,250
- THAT'S TRUE.
IT WOULD BE NICE

108
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,375
TO NOT HAVE TO LIVE
IN CONSTANT FEAR OF THEM.

109
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,000
- YOU'RE SO SMART, JUVIA!

110
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,166
AND PRETTY, TOO!

111
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,666
- UGH, STAY AWAY FROM ME!

112
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,250
JEEZ, GIVE A GIRL
A LITTLE SPACE, WOULD YA?!

113
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:03,500
- OUT OF THE QUESTION.

114
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,416
THE KING'S DRUNK WITH POWER.

115
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,125
EVEN IF WE WERE TO SIDE
WITH THE ROYAL ARMY

116
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,291
THERE'S STILL NO GUARANTEE
WE'D BE IN HIS GOOD GRACES.

117
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:12,333
- ( grumbling )

118
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,791
- SHE'S GOT A GOOD POINT.

119
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,250
WE CAN'T TRY TO MAKE
PEACE WITH THEM.

120
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,916
YOU KNOW THEY CAN'T
BE TRUSTED.

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,541
EVEN IF WE WERE
TO SIDE WITH THEM

122
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,333
THEY COULD TURN ON US
AT ANY MOMENT.

123
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,291
- MHM.

124
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,083
DROY'S SUGGESTION
WON'T WORK EITHER.

125
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,583
KING FAUST ISN'T GOING
TO WAIT AROUND.

126
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,458
AS SOON AS HE'S WIPED OUT
THE EXCEEDS

127
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,208
HE'S GOING TO MOVE ON
TO HIS NEXT GOAL.

128
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:33,083
HE'LL USHER IN A HORRIFIC AGE
OF DARKNESS.

129
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,250
TYRANNIZING ANY
WHO DARE OPPOSE HIM.

130
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,416
I'M TELLING YOU, THIS IS OUR
ONLY CHANCE TO SAVE OURSELVES.

131
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,166
HUMANS AND EXCEEDS NEED
TO WORK TOGETHER

132
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,750
TO STOP HIM ONCE AND FOR ALL.

133
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:47,625
- ( grumbling )

134
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,458
- ( laughing )

135
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:56,750
- Faust:
YOU'RE PATHETIC!

136
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,958
YOU DON'T STAND A CHANCE
OF WINNING.

137
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,958
- Natsu: EVERYONE IN
THIS WORLD'S SUFFERING

138
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,583
'CAUSE THERE'S NO MAGIC POWER.

139
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,708
I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHY
THEIR CRAZY KING

140
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,000
SEEMS TO HAVE MORE
THAN HIS FAIR SHARE OF IT.

141
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,916
- ( laughing )

142
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,875
- YOU'D BE HARD PRESSED
TO FIND A KING

143
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:14,000
WHO HASN'T IMPOSED A TAX
ON HIS PEOPLE.

144
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,375
THAT'S HOW MONARCHY WORKS,
MY BOY!

145
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:19,875
THE DORMA ANIM REQUIRES A
CONSTANT INFLUX OF MAGIC POWER.

146
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,000
SO IT'S GATHERED
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.

147
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,833
THAT'S WHY IT WAS SEALED AWAY.
IT'S A FORBIDDEN WEAPON.

148
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:28,375
NOW THAT I'VE ACTIVATED IT,
THE FATE OF THIS WORLD

149
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,500
IS DEPENDENT UPON MY VICTORY.

150
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,875
- WHY SHOULD WE BELIEVE YOU?

151
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,583
- YOU DON'T GIVE A CRAP
WHAT HAPPENS TO THIS WORLD.

152
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,666
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE STEALING
ALL ITS MAGIC POWER.

153
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,166
- ( laughing )

154
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,500
- ONE OF THE REASONS
I JOINED FAIRY TAIL

155
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,208
WAS SO I COULD HELP OTHERS.

156
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,666
TO BE HONEST, I COULDN'T CARE
LESS WHAT HAPPENS

157
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,875
TO YOUR STUPID WORLD.

158
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,750
BUT I DO CARE ABOUT EVERYONE
WHO LIVES HERE.

159
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,833
SO I'M ABOUT TO KICK
YOUR BUTT FOR THEM!

160
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,833
- MAYBE THIS ISN'T
SUCH A GOOD IDEA AFTER ALL.

161
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,833
I THINK IT'S BETTER
FOR US TO MIND OUR OWN BUSINESS

162
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,500
AND LET THEM DUKE IT OUT.

163
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,541
- YOU KNOW, HE'S GOT A POINT.
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO WAR.

164
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,416
I'D RATHER STAY HERE
AND CUDDLE WITH YOU.

165
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,041
- YEAH, I AGREE.

166
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,416
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
GET INVOLVED.

167
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,791
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH US.

168
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,166
- WHY ARE YOU GUYS ACTING
LIKE A BUNCH OF WIMPS?

169
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,791
EVERYTHING MAY SEEM FINE NOW,

170
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,416
BUT ONCE THE KING'S WIPED OUT
THE EXCEEDS, HE'LL COME FOR US.

171
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,625
- TRUST ME, EVERYONE'S
WELL AWARE OF THAT, LUCY.

172
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:21,041
YEAH, WE KNOW
THAT'S A POSSIBILITY.

173
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,041
BUT THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN
TAKE ON THE KING

174
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,458
AND THE ENTIRE ARMY.
- MHM.

175
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:26,708
- HERE'S THE THING,

176
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,458
WE'RE RUNNING LOW
ON MAGIC POWER RIGHT NOW.

177
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,750
IN FACT, WE'RE ALMOST OUT.

178
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,458
WE ONLY HAVE ENOUGH
TO WARP ONE MORE TIME.

179
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,708
SO IF WE DECIDE TO GO
INTO BATTLE

180
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,583
THERE'S GOING TO BE
NO TURNING BACK.

181
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,500
- Lucy:
OPEN, GATE OF THE LION!

182
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:46,541
LOKE!

183
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:47,791
- YOU MISS ME, LUCY?

184
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,625
- DON'T WORRY, I'LL KEEP
YOU SAFE!

185
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:54,625
- THANK YOU!

186
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,416
- Soldier 2:
FIRE, MEN!

187
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,083
- MAGIC BULLETS?

188
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,500
- ( screams )

189
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,916
- HAPPY, LOOK OUT!

190
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,791
- CARLA!

191
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,875
- Happy:
ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

192
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,875
- Soldier 3: OH, CRAP. I
ACCIDENTALLY HIT AN EXCEED.

193
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,416
- Soldier 4: WATCH WHERE YOU
SHOOT, YOU IDIOT.

194
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,333
WE NEED THEM FOR MAGIC POWER.

195
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:20,666
- CARLA, YOU'VE GOT
TO HANG IN THERE.

196
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,708
YOU HEAR ME?

197
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,833
- HAPPY, GRAB THE GIRL
AND RUN TO SAFETY.

198
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,333
- YOU GOT IT, LOKE.
THANKS!

199
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,708
- DON'T MESS WITH ME.

200
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,166
 - ( roar )

201
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,500
- IT'S TIME TO MAKE
A DECISION.

202
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,541
ARE WE GOING TO HELP
THE EXCEEDS, OR NOT?

203
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,500
- ( grumbling )

204
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,750
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
I CAN SAY TO CHANGE YOUR MINDS.

205
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:08,000
PLEASE.  THE FAIRY TAIL MEMBERS
FROM EARTH LAND--

206
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:11,291
THEY'RE OUT THERE RISKING THEIR
LIVES AGAINST THE ROYAL ARMY.

207
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,250
THE EARTH LAND VERSION OF ME,

208
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,666
NATSU,

209
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,208
GRAY,

210
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,541
ALL OF US!

211
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:36,625
- AT THIS RATE,
EVERYBODY'S GOING TO DIE!

212
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,125
- WE CAN'T GIVE UP.
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

213
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,666
WE'VE GOT TO KEEP FIGHTING!

214
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,375
- NOW, ARE WE GOING TO LEAVE
THEM TO DIE ON THE BATTLEFIELD?

215
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,375
OR ARE WE GOING TO LEND
THEM A HAND?

216
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,750
THE FUTURE OF EDOLAS
IS AT STAKE!

217
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:54,583
- Lucy: I'LL BET NATSU
AND ERZA ARE STILL IN IT.

218
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,666
IF THEY CAN FIND THE STRENGTH
TO KEEP GOING,

219
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,583
THEN I KNOW I CAN, TOO.

220
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,208
- I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THE REST OF YOU,

221
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,958
BUT I'M TIRED OF ALWAYS RUNNING
AWAY FROM FIGHTS.

222
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,666
I THINK IT'S TIME WE STAND UP
TO THE ROYAL ARMY!

223
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,291
- WE'VE GOT TO KEEP FIGHTING!

224
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,291
- WE'VE GOT TO FACE
OUR FOES HEAD-ON!

225
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,833
- ( both Lucys ) BECAUSE
THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS

226
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,750
TO BE A FAIRY TAIL WIZARD!

227
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,666
- Happy:
IT'S HOPELESS.

228
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,375
THERE'S WAY TOO MANY
OF THEM.

229
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:28,625
- NO-OO!

230
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,750
- SOMEONE, PLEASE SAVE US.

231
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,625
- Soldier #5: HEY, WHERE'D
THOSE ROOTS COME FROM?!

232
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:53,833
- Soldier #6:
THEY'RE CHOKING THE LEGIONS!

233
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,208
- WHOA, WHAT THE HECK?

234
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,666
- Soldier #7: NO WAY.

235
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,666
- Soldier #8: IT'S THOSE COWARDS
WHO ALWAYS RUN FROM US.

236
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,791
- Gray:
LET'S GO!

237
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,208
- YEAH!

238
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,750
- WE'LL SHOW YOU MEATHEADS
THE POWER OF CAMARADERIE.

239
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,750
- ( all shout )

240
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:31,708
- THE EDOLAS FAIRY TAIL
SAVES THE DAY!

241
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:35,666
- WE MADE IT. SORRY WE'RE LATE,
BUT THAT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING.

242
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,791
- YOU'RE A LIFESAVER.

243
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,250
- LET'S GO!

244
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,791
- Droy: WE'RE GOING TO TAKE
YOU DOWN, ROYAL ARMY!

245
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,833
- OKAY-- READY, NATSU?

246
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,250
- YEAH, IF THE EARTH LANDERS
CAN STAND UP TO 'EM,

247
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,416
THEN I CAN TOO.

248
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,333
I WON'T LET MY FEAR
GET THE BEST OF ME.

249
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,500
- DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
GOING TO BE ABLE TO STAND?

250
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:06,541
- Loke:
DOUBLE THE LUCY!

251
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:07,583
- YEAH, THANKS A LOT.

252
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:08,791
- YOU'RE ME?

253
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,208
- ( both ):
WHAT'S WITH YOUR CLOTHES?!

254
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,083
- TAKE SOME OFF!
- YOU PUT SOME ON!

255
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,750
- ONE GRAY WAS BAD ENOUGH,
BUT NOW THERE'S TWO?

256
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:15,958
I CAN'T HANDLE IT!

257
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,333
- OH, I'M SO JEALOUS OF THEM.
- WHY?

258
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,416
- JUST THE SIGHT
OF OUR BELOVED JUVIA

259
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,083
MAKES ME WEAK.
OH, WHAT I WOULDN'T GIVE

260
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,750
TO BE PRESSED UP
AGAINST HER BOSOM, TOO!

261
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,750
- YOU'VE GOT THE HOTS
FOR THAT PSYCHO?!

262
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,125
- I'M SO IN LOVE
WITH YOU, JUVIA!

263
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,875
- ARGH, SHUT UP!

264
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,333
- WE CAN'T LET OURSELVES
BE OUTDONE, LOVE GUN.

265
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,875
WHAT DO YOU SAY? - YEAH,

272
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,458
- YEAH!

273
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,208

274
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:52,666
WITH THE STRONGEST TEAM
IN FAIRY TAIL!

275
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:59,291
- YOU PUNKS AIN'T GOT NOTHING
ON ME!

276
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,625
- WOW, HE'S AWESOME!

277
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,375
HE'S EVEN FASTER THAN ME.

278
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,541
- Lucy: GRAY'S
HEAD-OVER-HEELS FOR JUVIA?

279
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,375
JET AND DROY ARE THE STRONGEST
WIZARDS IN THE GUILD?

280
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,416
EVERYTHING'S TOTALLY SCREWY
HERE!

281
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,250
- WE'RE SO LUCKY CARLA,

282
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,750
WE'D BE GONERS IF THEY
HADN'T COME TO OUR RESCUE.

283
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,875
- Carla: HUH?

284
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,583
- I KNEW WE COULD COUNT ON THEM.

285
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,291
THEY'RE DIFFERENT
BUT THEY'RE STILL FAIRY TAIL!

286
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,833
- Lisanna:
HOW ARE YOU DOING, NATSU?

287
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,666

- Alzack:
YOU TOO, LITTLE PISTOL.

291
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,041
- THEY'RE A LOVABLE BUNCH
OF HOOLIGANS,

292
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,000
NO MATTER WHAT WORLD THEY'RE IN.

293
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,375
- I WILL KILL YOU!

294
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,916
- NOT IF YOU CAN'T CATCH ME!

295
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,958
- Erza Scarlet: TO THINK WE'RE
THIS EQUALLY MATCHED--

296
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,958
- Erza Knightwalker: IT FEELS
THAT WAY NOW, BUT JUST WAIT.

297
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,750
THAT'LL CHANGE ONCE YOU
EXPERIENCE THE FINAL FORM

298
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,333
OF MY TEN COMMANDMENTS.

299
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,625
SACRED SPEAR, RAVELT!

300
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:21,583
IT WAS FORGED BY THE GREATEST
BLACKSMITH IN ALL OF EDOLAS!

301
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,625
A SINGLE BLOW WILL
ROCK THE HEAVENS

302
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,708
AND HERALD ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION!

303
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:35,333
- ARMADURA FAIRY,
MY STRONGEST ARMOR.

304
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,000
IT'S NAMED AFTER MY GUILD

305
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,750
BECAUSE IT EMBODIES
ALL THE QUALITIES

306
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,291
I LOVE ABOUT FAIRY TAIL!

307
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:43,875
- WELL THEN, I CAN'T WAIT
TO PUT IT TO THE TEST.

308
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,375
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

309
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:46,708
- NOW!

310
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,500
- NO!  THE RAVELT'S DESTROYED.

311
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,958
- WHAT? MY ARMOR'S GONE.

312
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,875
DID THE SHOCKWAVE
FROM THE IMPACT

313
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,208
CAUSE THE ISLAND
TO BECOME UNSTABLE?

314
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:19,416
- AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE,
WE'RE BOTH LOW ON MAGIC POWER.

315
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,333
THAT WON'T STOP ME
FROM KILLING YOU!

316
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:27,916
CURSE YOU!

317
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,916
- Faust: CAN'T YOU SEE THAT
YOU'RE JUST WASTING YOUR ENERGY?

318
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,500
THERE'S NO DEFEATING ME
AND MY DORMA ANIM!

319
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:39,041
I HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER THE
MAGIC POWER OF THIS WORLD.

320
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,375
THEREFORE, I HAVE THE RIGHT
TO USE IT HOWEVER I PLEASE!

321
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,250
- YOU SHOULD SHARE IT
WITH YOUR PEOPLE

322
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,750
INSTEAD OF HOGGING IT ALL
FOR YOURSELF, YOU GREEDY GEEZER!

323
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,375
- IF YOU THINK YOU'RE
INDESTRUCTIBLE,

324
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,875
THEN I'VE GOT
NEWS FOR YOU.

325
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,125
YOU AND THAT PHONY DRAGON
OF YOURS ARE ABOUT TO GO DOWN!

326
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,541
- SKY DRAGON ROAR!

327
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,375
- ( laughing )

328
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,541
- HOW MANY TIMES MUST I TELL YOU
NOT TO WASTE MAGIC POWER?

329
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,416
I HATE TO THINK HOW MUCH
YOUR ATTACKS

330
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,875
MIGHT BE AFFECTING MY SUPPLY.

331
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,958
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"YOUR SUPPLY?"

332
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:14,666
MY MAGIC POWER BELONGS TO ME.
IT AIN'T NOBODY ELSE'S, GOT IT?

333
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,666
IRON DRAGON CLUB!

334
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,000
- IT'S ONLY A MATTER
OF TIME NOW.

335
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,208
IT WILL BE MINE,

336
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,625
YOUR LIVES AND POWER
ARE MY SPOILS OF WAR!

337
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,458
- ( laughing )

338
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,500
- NOT IF WE STOP YOU!

339
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,333
- YOU'RE SO CUTE
WHEN YOU FIGHT, JUVIA.

340
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,083
- YOU'RE TOO CLINGY.
TAKE SOME NOTES

341
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:51,916
FROM EARTH LAND GRAY-- BACK OFF
AND DITCH A SWEATER OR TWO.

342
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,708
- TELL ME THE TRUTH,

343
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,125
DO YOU AND YOUR BUDDIES
HONESTLY THINK

344
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,250
YOU'RE DOING
THE RIGHT THING?

345
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,125
- I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO ANSWER THAT!

346
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,041
- THEY'RE JUST FOLLOWING ORDERS.

347
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,500
I'M SURE THERE ARE PLENTY
OF SOLDIERS

348
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:02,833
WHO OPPOSE THE ROYAL ARMY.

349
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,125
HOWEVER,

350
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,125
THEY'RE FORCED TO FIGHT
BECAUSE THEY KNOW

351
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,208
THAT THE KING WILL HAVE
THEM KILLED IF THEY DISOBEY.

352
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,250
- I DON'T BELONG
ON THE BATTLEFIELD, I'M A LADY.

353
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,791
BUT I'LL STAY AND FIGHT
WITH THE REST OF YOU.

354
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,791
EVEN THOUGH I'D MUCH RATHER
BE AT A TEA PARTY.

355
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,625
- THANKS A LOT, CANA.

356
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,041
AT THIS POINT, WE NEED
ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET.

357
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,791
- I KNOW THIS IS NONE
OF MY BUSINESS,

358
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:26,041
BUT IS THE GUY WITH THE GLASSES
YOUR BOYFRIEND, LUCY?

359
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,916
- NO, DEFINITELY NOT!
HE WISHES.

360
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,625
- YOU'RE DRAWN TO ME,
AREN'T YOU?

361
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:33,375
CAN'T REALLY SAY I'M SURPRISED,
SINCE YOU'RE LUCY, TOO.

362
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:37,125
- I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN PRETTY BOYS LIKE YOU, PAL.

363
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,583
- HAPPY!

364
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,541
- Happy:
THANKS, BIG WENDY!

365
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,125
- YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE,
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

366
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,791
OH, YOU'VE BEEN INJURED.

367
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,333
DO YOU WANT ME
TO STAY WITH YOU?

368
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:51,250
- THANK YOU, BUT I'M FINE.

369
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,208
HAPPY WILL TAKE GOOD CARE OF ME.

370
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,541
- YOU SHOULD BE A LOT SAFER
OVER HERE.

371
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,750
HOLLER IF YOU NEED ME
AND I'LL COME RUNNING.

372
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:10,208
I'LL STAY CLOSE BY.

373
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,500
- LOOKS LIKE WENDY'S
JUST AS NICE HERE

374
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,708
AS SHE IS AT HOME.

375
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:18,208
- Erza Knightwalker: EVERLASTING
MAGIC POWER IS AT STAKE,

376
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,458
I CAN NOT LOSE!

377
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,916
- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU
COULD LIVE WITH YOURSELF,

378
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,666
KNOWING HOW MANY LIVES
WERE LOST TO GRANT THAT POWER.

379
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,250
YOU'RE SO OBSESSED WITH IT,
YOU'LL DO ANYTHING!

380
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,583
HATE AND OPPRESS,

381
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:33,708
PLUNDER AND KILL.

382
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,666
- THAT'S HUMAN NATURE, YOU KNOW.

383
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,416
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

384
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,875
HUMAN BEINGS ARE FULL
OF LOVE AND COMPASSION.

385
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:44,500
IT'S OUR NATURE TO STAND UP
FOR THOSE WE HOLD DEAR.

386
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,958
AND TO TAKE UP ARMS TO PROTECT
OUR SUFFERING COMRADES.

387
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:51,625
TELL ME, HOW ARE YOU NOT MOVED
BY THE SCREAMS OF THE EXCEEDS?

388
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:52,958
CAN'T YOU HEAR THEM?

389
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,041
- I CAN HEAR THEM
LOUD AND CLEAR.

390
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,500
BUT IT'S THE ONLY WAY
THE KINGDOM

391
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:57,916
CAN REGAIN ITS MAGIC POWER.

392
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,833
WE'VE GOT NO CHOICE,
WE CAN'T SURVIVE WITHOUT IT!

393
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:05,125
- YOU'RE WRONG. IT'S PEOPLE,
NOT POWER, THAT MATTERS!

394
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,541
- THAT MAY BE TRUE WHERE
YOU'RE FROM, BUT NOT HERE.

395
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,583
YOU HAVE A WEALTH
OF MAGIC POWER,

396
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,375
YOU COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND

397
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:15,875
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE YOUR LIFE

398
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,166
IN FEAR OF LOSING IT

399
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,166
BECAUSE YOU'VE NEVER
BEEN WITHOUT IT!

400
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,041
IF YOU FELT THE DESPERATION
THAT COMES FROM BEING POWERLESS

401
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,791
YOU'D UNDERSTAND WHY
WE NEED IT TO LIVE!

402
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,916
- IF THAT WERE TRUE, WE'D BE
DEAD RIGHT NOW. BUT WE'RE NOT.

403
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,750
YOU DON'T NEED MAGIC POWER
TO SURVIVE.

404
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,666
THE TWO OF US HAVE RUN
OUT OF IT,

405
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,250
BUT WE'RE STILL ALIVE.

406
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,166
IT'S NICE TO HAVE MAGIC,
BUT IT'S NOT VITAL.

407
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,125
YOU MUST OVERCOME YOUR FEAR.

408
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,458
DON'T LET ANXIETY AND
DESPAIR RULE YOU.

409
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:47,666
THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE ALIVE.

410
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,208
TRUST ME, ERZA.

411
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,000
I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR EYES,
YOU POSSESS MY STRENGTHS

412
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,833
AS WELL AS MY WEAKNESSES.
THAT MEANS, DEEP DOWN,

413
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,583
YOU MUST POSSESS
THE SAME LOVING HEART I DO.

414
00:20:56,666 --> 00:21:00,083
DON'T LET IT BE OVERSHADOWED
BY YOUR GREED.

415
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:03,291
- ( thinking )
COULD IT BE TRUE?

416
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,916
- Erza Knightwalker:
IS THIS THE REAL ME?

417
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,166
- LET YOURSELF SPEAK
WITH YOUR TRUE VOICE.

418
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:13,041
- ( gasps )

419
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,291
- Erza Knightwalker: TEARS?

420
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:18,666
- I PROMISE YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

421
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,875
- DID YOU SEE THAT?!

422
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,166
- SOMETHING JUST CRASHED
TO THE GROUND.

423
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,291
- ERZA?

424
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:38,000
- GREAT, WE DON'T EVEN HAVE
STRENGTH LEFT TO MOVE NOW.

425
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,083
- MAYBE NOT, BUT WE'RE ALIVE.

426
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:46,083
- I FOUGHT HARD, BUT I'M
NO MATCH.  YOU WIN, SCARLET.

427
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:49,958
- I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR
TO DECLARE A VICTOR.

428
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,541
YOU AND I ARE THE SAME.

429
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:55,666
- HM, THAT'S TRUE.

430
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,208
- WHERE ARE WE?

431
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:07,083
- Pantherlily: ISN'T THIS WHERE
THEY FORMED THE ANIMAS?

432
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:10,125
TELL ME, WHAT ARE YOU
PLANNING TO DO?

433
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:13,875
- I HAVE SPENT A GREAT DEAL
OF TIME OBSERVING EARTH LAND.

434
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,875
IT HAS ITS FAIR SHARE
OF PROBLEMS,

435
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:18,791
BUT IT'S
A BOUNTIFUL WORLD.

436
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:21,125
IT WILL SERVE
AS A FINE RECEPTACLE.

437
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:23,250
- BUT PRINCE--
NO, IT'S MADNESS.

438
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:24,875
IT'S GOING TOO FAR.

439
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:27,083
THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER WAY.

440
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,541
- I'VE EXHAUSTED
EVERY OTHER POSSIBLE OPTION.

441
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:30,916
I HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE.

442
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,291
I'M GOING TO CREATE A WORLD
WHERE HUMANS AND EXCEEDS

443
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:34,416
CAN LIVE IN HARMONY.

444
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,833
I'LL OPEN A REVERSE ANIMA

445
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:42,000
AND ELIMINATE ALL MAGIC POWER
LEFT IN THIS WORLD.

446
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,708
- ( theme music playing ) 

447
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:47,375
- ( singing in Japanese )

448
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:14,083
- Natsu:
THIS IS INTENSE!

449
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:15,875
THAT PHONY DRAGON'S
EVEN HARDER TO BEAT

450
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:16,958
THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

451
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,458
- Happy:
WELL IT IS A FORBIDDEN WEAPON,

452
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,083
SO IT'S GOT TO BE
PRETTY HARDCORE.

453
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,458
- Natsu:
IT SUCKS THAT OUR MAGIC ATTACKS

454
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:22,708
DON'T HAVE ANY EFFECT ON IT.

455
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:23,958
- Happy:
LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

456
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:25,625
WE'VE GOT THREE SUPER-STRONG
DRAGON SLAYERS

457
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,875
ON OUR TEAM.
THERE'S NO WAY WE COULD LOSE!

458
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:29,791
- Natsu: YOU'RE RIGHT, LET'S
GO SHOW THAT OLD GEEZER

459
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:30,875
