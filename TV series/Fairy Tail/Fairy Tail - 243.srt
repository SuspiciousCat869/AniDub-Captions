[HAPPY]
Look at all of the writing.

2
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:23,000
And that big floating
sphere in the center.

3
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:24,875
Doesn't it look like a globe?

4
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,291
[CARLA] This must be some
kind of command center.

5
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,541
[FRANMALTH]
How could they make it this far?

6
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:36,208
Those worthless guards couldn't
be more pathetic if they tried.

7
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,250

Hey. Do you see that?

[WENDY gasps]

9
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,416
I had hoped Erza was wrong,

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,416
but it looks like the
Face has been unsealed.

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,166
How do we stop it?

12
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,125
Could we use this magic circle?

13
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,375
Maybe it could seal
it all over again.

14
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:54,416
Perhaps. But there's no
way for us to operate it.

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,791
We're locked out.

16
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,791
Hold on.

17
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,208
If I'm reading this right,

18
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:02,041
the Face can only be activated
by its on-site controls.

19
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:03,791
We might be in luck here.

20
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:06,916
It's already started?

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,250
[FRANMALTH chuckles]

22
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:11,791
[FRANMALTH] You sure work
fast, Ezel. Well done.

23
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:12,875
Oh no!

[LUCY gasps]

25
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:21,291
I don't wanna
jump to conclusions,

26
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:23,833
but this looks like a countdown.

Theres only 41 more minutes.

30
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:33,166
Then all magic on the continent
will be purged from existence!

31
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,916
You brat! I'll kill you!

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,166
Well, if the small fries
aren't goin' to cut it,

33
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,250
I have no choice but to show
you my most powerful soul!

34
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,583
You asked for this!

[FRANMALTH groaning]

36
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,166
[NARRATOR] Face, a pulse
bomb with the power

37
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,291
to destroy all magic on the
continent, is counting down.

38
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:00,541
Most of Fairy Tail
fights in the Cube:

39
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,458
Home of the demons of Zeref

40
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:05,166
who set Face to work
against mankind.

41
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,125
But In a last ditch effort
to prevent the detonation,

42
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:12,500
Wendy and Carla fly
out on their own.

43
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:16,541
Time is a precious resource,
and Fairy Tail's is running out.

44
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,250
Can Wendy's team
succeed in its mission?

45
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:23,791
Or will our heroes soon dwell
in a world without magic?

46
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,375
[WENDY]
We have to hurry, Carla!

47
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,791
[CARLA]
I realize that.

48
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,791
We can't afford to mess this up.

49
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,958
The stakes are bigger than us.
The whole continent's at risk.

50
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,583
No matter what happens,
we have to find a way.

51
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,416
[CARLA] I agree, but I have
no idea what we should try.

52
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,125
Neither do I.
We'll have to improvise.

53
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,000
I know that's what
Natsu would do.

54
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,791
Failure's not an option.

55

You've gotta fly even faster,
Carla! As fast as you can!

Whoa, that smoke.

00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,208
Crazy.

59
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,250
This shouldn't be possible.

00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,416
How does he...?

61
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,458
How does he have that soul?

62
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,083
[LUCY]
It's Master Hades.

63
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,708

the body right!

[LUCY]
I don't like it.

67
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,125
The nuances of my appearance
aren't important.

68
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:13,416
Don't you get it? I've become
the dark wizard Hades!

[NATSU] I can see that's
what your goin' for.

Can you?

71
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,666
Because if you could then you'd
be cowering in fear right now.

72

Obviously you have no idea
what a scary man he was.

Yeah, no. I remember
him pretty well.

That's enough! Shut
your wretched traps

and I will tell you all you
never knew about him!

You may have heard of the
dark guild, Grimoire Heart.

Well this man, a man after
my own heart, led the thing!

He was the darkest genius the
world had seen since Zeref.

grovel at my feet!

Seven years ago, as I was
searching for Lord Zeref,

I stumbled upon this
fabulous hunk of carrion.

87
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,166
This man was human in name
alone, because everything

88
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,875
from his taste in books to his
better eye radiated with power.

89

Demonic power!

[HAPPY] So you never heard about
how Hades got beat, didja?

91

Can't say I have,

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,375
but I don't see why that
would matter to me.

[chuckles] Oh, it matters.

94
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,625
'Cause it was me who kicked
his wrinkled butt!

00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,750
I already won this
fight seven years ago.

00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,291
It's how my flames
got their spark.

98
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:27,625
Yeah, man, Natsu already gave
that Hades guy the business.

99
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,125
But did you fight him alone?

00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,875
The body might not
look like much,

104
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,333
but once it's revved
up, it doesn't quit!

[NATSU growls]

106
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,625
Such power can
only come from those

who've seen the
Abyss of Sorcery!

There we go. Connection!

110
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:06,666
Soon I'll be putting
your soul in the bank!

Say what now?

122
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:39,333
So he can nom on the
souls of Natsu's spells?

123
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,958
I didn't even know that
spells could have souls.

125

I gotta say, that was
yummy little snack.

126
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,500
Sure didn't see that one comin'.

127
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,083
[FRANMALTH] I can feel
the scope of your strength

128
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,708
from the taste you gave me.

129
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,958
You're likely the wizard
who beat Jackal,

130
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,666
but that doesn't speak for
your odds with the rest of us.

131
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,625
'Cause we're all demons
of the Books of Zeref.

132
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:08,541
Each of us a unique and living
weapon from a far better time.

133

Expertly crafted by
the cruelest of hands.

134
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,083
You'd do yourself a service
by keeping sight of the fact

135
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:17,083
that each of us has the
strength of a full army.

136
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:20,500
And a lust for human pain.

137
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:35,083
[SEILAH] You've no chance
against my Macro curse.

138
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,958
With it, I can force
any human being

139
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,875
to do exactly as I bid them.

140
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,625
So that's how you were able to
get Elfman to destroy our guild.

141
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:43,666
Well then.

142
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,333
Listen, demon.

143
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:49,125
You hurt my siblings. That means
you'll have to answer to me.

144
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,833
And I'm not as nice as I seem.

Careful, sis! She's
trying to provoke you.

146
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,416
A reckless charge is
exactly what she wants!

147
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:17,083
Humans are quite easily
swayed by their emotions.

148
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:20,541
This makes you simple
to manipulate.

149

On such foolish beings,

150
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,666
my powers are wasted.

[gasps]

152
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,666
Those "foolish emotions"

153
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,083
are also a source of
humanity's strength.

Your human rage is
nothing to the pen of Zeref.

00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,708
Mirajane, behind you!

158
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,625
This is Mirajane's

and she still isn't winning.

00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,958
I will not lose.

161
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:32,750
[KYOKA yells]

162
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,041
Such power.

163
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,916
I'll ask you once again.

164
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,375
What is your guild
trying to accomplish?

165
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,708
You say you wish to return to
Zeref, but what does that mean?

166
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,541
We live to serve the great
being who created us.

167
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,916
As he has made his
wishes quite clear,

168
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,208
there is but one
path set before us.

169
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,333
The destruction of your world.

170
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,958
Don't expect all to go
according to your plan.

171
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:11,500
My comrades'll be fighting
to stop Face as we speak!

172
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:15,333
[KYOKA] You speak of our plans,
but yours are just as fragile.

173
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,583
[ERZA]
What?

174
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,125
[chuckling]

175
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:22,750
[ERZA] That smile, as if
she's predicted all of this.

176
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:26,375
Still, plans are the last
thing you should worry about.

177
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,791
Just hang in there.
We're getting close!

178
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,500
[CARLA] Don't worry.
I'll get us there, somehow.

179
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:43,333
[GRAY] Listen, man. I'm in
a bit of a rush, all right?

180
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:49,166
So either tell me why you're
bringin' up this "Silver" guy,

181
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,000
or shut up and come at me!

182
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,791
[KEYES chuckles]

183
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,750
This freak has the
same defense as Juvia.

184
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,583
What the heck are you doin'?

185
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,958
If you're gonna
fight, then fight!

186
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,583
[KEYES]
Tartaros does have a member

187
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,875
who might match your
strength, but I am not he.

188
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:11,583
The hell, man? Are you tryin'
to beat me, or take me home?

189
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,708
Because either way,
I'm not that easy!

190
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,416
[KEYES]
Think what you will.

191
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,416
It matters not.

192
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,583
[GRAY]
I can't land a single hit.

193
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,000
[KEYES]
With power like yours,

194
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,291
you could cause
quite the disruption.

195
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:27,375
I think I'll hold
you here instead.

196
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,125
So that means you're just
tryin' to keep me busy.

197
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,083
[ELFMAN yelling]

198
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,875
[SOLDIER A]
Six men, one punch?

199
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,000
[SOLDIER B]
I counted seven.

200
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,791
That was barely even a warm up!

201
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,166
I've got a lot more
manly atonement ahead!

202
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,750
[SOLDIER C yelling]

203
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,708
[ELFMAN yells]

204
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,875
Mirajane! Lisanna!
Where are you?

205
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,416
Your sisters are strong, Elfman,

206
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,208
if anyone can hold out
in here, it's them.

207
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,916
So instead of worrying,
have faith and focus!

208
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,250
They'd do the same for you.

209
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,958
Yeah, you're right.
Those two are manly.

210
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:16,875
They're gonna be fine,
the both of 'em. I know it.

211
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,666
I think that's the Poison
Jelly Valley cavern.

212
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,083
Take us inside.

213
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:33,375
[WENDY]
Wow. How deep is it?

214
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:36,083
[CARLA] It'll be hard
to locate Face in this.

215
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,750
[CARLA]
I apologize, Wendy.

216
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,208
It seems that I used
up too much magic.

217
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,541
[WENDY]
Don't worry. You were awesome.

218
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,916
[WENDY]
Hey, look. A tunnel.

219
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,500
Let's check it out.

220
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,666
I'm no gambler, but
against demonic curses,

221
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,375
human magic has worse odds

222
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:46,041
than a three-legged
goat in a lion's den.

223
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,916
Oh, and countdown update.

224
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,875
If you're going to win
against those odds,

225
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,041
you'd better do it in
the next ten minutes,

226
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,583
or else you'll have
no magic to fight with.

227
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,541
I'll have to ask
you how it feels.

228
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,750
Once the magic's been torn away
from you, tell me what's left!

229
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,750
Something tells me you
don't really give a crap

230
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,958
about our feelings, do ya?

231
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,416
Wish we knew exactly
how much time was left.

232
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,333
You have a remaining
9 minutes and 43 seconds.

233
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,833
[LUCY] Everyone who can stand
is fighting right now.

234
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:16,041
If we lose our magic all
at once, we'd be doomed.

235
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:18,875
[JUVIA]
What is that?

236
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,208
[ELFMAN]
Whatever it is,

237
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,208
let's deal with it fast so
we can find my sisters!

238
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,458
[roaring]

239
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,541
[WAKABA] Damn it! Looks like
we'll be on our own for a while.

240
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,083
[MACAO]
It doesn't matter.

241
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,500
Where d'ya think we'll find
the guy with the Bane Particles?

242
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,833
How would I know?

243
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,791
Let's just keep fightin'
and hope we run into him.

244
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:40,166
If we can somehow pull this off,
I'm gettin' drunk tonight.

245
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,666
[WAKABA]
I'm up for that!

246
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,541
[LUCY] Nine minutes.
That's all we have left.

247
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,416
[LUCY] If Face detonates,
there'll be nothing we can do.

248
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,250
It's all up to Wendy.

249
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,333
Just Wendy, that's it.

250
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,666
[HAPPY]
Hey, she's gonna be fine.

251
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,458
She's not alone.
Carla's with her,

252
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,083
and Carla's one smart cookie!

253
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:05,041
Whatever they're up against,
I'm sure she'll figure it out.

254
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,291
[WENDY]
It's getting even darker.

255
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,166
There was a distant
light near the entrance,

256
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,750
but now I can barely
see where I'm walking.

257
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:18,625
[CARLA groans]

258
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:22,541
Hey, I'm sorry
I pushed you so hard.

259
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,833
I'll be fine. Just need a nap.

260
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:28,291
But first let's find this Face
device and neutralize it.

261
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,208
Well, the problem is we don't
know the first thing about it.

262
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,500
I couldn't even tell you
what it looks like.

263
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,791
What do you think Natsu
would do if he was here?

264
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,583
[CARLA] I suspect that
he would go buck-wild

265
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,500
and destroy the entire cave.

266
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:45,625
But I'm not nearly as
strong as Natsu, so I can't.

267
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,125
I'm glad for that.

268
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:50,208
Natsu would've brought the
whole thing crashing down on us.

269
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:53,333
Why don't you just try
to feel for magic power?

270
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:56,083
Yeah, good point.
I'll give that a shot.

271
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,791
[WENDY sniffs]

272
00:16:58,875 --> 00:16:59,708
[rustling]

273
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:00,750
[WENDY]
Hm?

274
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,375
[WENDY yelps]

275
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:09,875
[WENDY screaming]

276
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:23,875
[WENDY screaming]

277
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,041
[WENDY]
Do you know where we came from?

278
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,583
'Cause I'm definitely lost now.

279
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,125
Be calm.

280
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,708
Settle down, and take
a nice, deep breath.

281
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,500
If you say so.

282
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,666
[WENDY inhales]

283
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,000
[WENDY exhales]

284
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,666
[WENDY]
Wow, this air's amazing.

285
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,791
[CARLA] It's certainly moist and
cool. Did it clear your head?

286
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:53,750
Well yeah, but I feel like there
might be more to it than that.

287
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,666
Now that you mention
it, I think I'm--

288
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,166
I think I'm on the verge
of realizing something.

289
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,458
Yeah?

290
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,708
Yes, but I'm too exhausted
to focus properly.

291
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,916
It's on the tip of my tongue.

292
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,916
I feel like it might
be important, but--

293
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,250
[EZEL] What kind of
pathetic morsels are these?

294
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,000
Kyoka's playing me for a fool.

295
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:16,250
You two won't even come
close to filling me up.

296
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,541
[WENDY gasps]

297
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,833
[EZEL] But I guess
you'll do for a snack!

298
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:26,416
It's a demon. He must be the
one they sent to activate Face!

299
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,000
[EZEL]
That's right!

300
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,208
I was told that Fairy Tail would
send someone to try and stop us.

301
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:34,500
I only took this job 'cause
Kyoka said I could eat 'em!

302
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,666
I was hoping to have a feast!

303
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,291
Well, looks like
the jokes on me!

304
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:42,541
What do we do now?

305
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,791
We can't fight, we only
have a few minutes left!

306
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,583
Come back here. I'm starving!

307
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:47,958
[CARLA]
Even if we did have time,

308
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,333
you're not nearly strong
enough to take him on alone!

309
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,333
[EZEL roars]

310
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,875
He's gonna catch us!
I don't have a choice!

311
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,208
[CARLA]
Wendy, don't!

312
00:18:57,416 --> 00:19:00,958
Enhancing all elemental
resistances! Deus Corona!

313
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:04,333
Enhancing all physical
abilities! Deus Eques!

314
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,958
Swift Winds, Stalwart Might,

315
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,500
and Steel Resolve of
the heavens combine!

316
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:13,916
Enchantment!

317
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:16,916
You know this won't save you.

318
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,125
Sky Dragon Roar!

319
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,750
[gasps]

320
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,625
That wasn't bad, pipsqueak!

321
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:36,250
No. But it's about to be my
turn. And this will end it all!

322
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,666
[WENDY]
Sky Dragon Talon!

323
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,375
[chuckles]

324
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:42,500
It did nothing.

325
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,333
Swords of Tenka Goken!

326
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,208
Don't just stand
there, take cover!

327
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:47,833
Onimaru!

328
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,750
[laughing]

329
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,583
Juzumaru!

330
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:08,833
Wendy, look out!

331
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:09,875
[gasps]

332
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,000
[WENDY] I used every defense I
have, but he's still too strong.

333
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,791
[WENDY screaming]

334
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,875
[WENDY yelps]

335
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,458
[EZEL]
Behold.

336
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:30,500
[WENDY gasps]

337
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,583
[EZEL]
You will die beside Face.

338
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:41,041
No, I... can't.

339
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,208
[EZEL]
It detonates in five minutes.

340
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,875
Hopefully that'll dissipate
the stench of ether-nano.

341
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:50,166
It's brutal at this range.
Kills my appetite.

342
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,291
Wait, ether-nano?

343
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,625
[gasps]

344
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,416
[EZEL] With the treatment
this stuff's getting,

345
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,208
it'll become the end
of all other ether-nano,

346
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,916
and all magic too.

347
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,583
Just five minutes till
our curses reign supreme!

348
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,291
Face's ether-nano.

349
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,666
If we can smell it,

350
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,583
that must mean it's seeping
into the air somehow.

351
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:11,083
[groaning]

352
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,625
Lucky for you,

353
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:15,916
that five minute countdown'll
take longer than your death.

354
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,125
[screaming]

355
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,458
Unhand Wendy, you monster!
Take this! And this too!

356
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,833
I'm sorry, Carla.

357
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,916
I'll scratch your
eyes out. Let her go!

358
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,416
Carla... you have to run.

359
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,583
Let her go! Take me instead!

360
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,583
[CARLA]
Come on then!

361
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:36,041
Don't hurt her!
Please, put her down!

362
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:39,291
That's a weird lookin' cat.
Still, it looks edible.

363
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,916
Stop! Don't do this,
I'm begging you!

364
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:47,000
No!

365
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,625
Wendy... the air.

366
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:50,666
[gasps]

367
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:55,750
[WENDY] This wonderful air.
That breath I took.

368
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:59,458
Face is permeated with
high-density ether-nano.

369
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:00,666
There's so much of the stuff

370
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,708
that the air around
Face is swathed in it.

371
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,166
If I could ingest it
like Natsu did.

372
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,541
If I could just...
breathe it in,

373
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:11,250
it might make me strong
enough to save Carla.

374
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,833
[WENDY yelling]

375
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:20,500
[EZEL grunts]

376
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,666
Whoa! What was that?

377
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:30,125
[CARLA] Wendy used to
seem so weak and timid.

378
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:33,791
I thought I'd always
have to protect her.

379
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:37,291
I was wrong. She got
stronger every day.

380
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,791
And now she has
the Dragon Force.

381
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,708
[LUCY]
Right when we needed her most,

382
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:17,250
Wendy finally obtained
the Dragon Force.

383
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:19,958
Now, as Face continues
its countdown to the end,

384
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,583
her fight with the
demon Ezel begins anew.

385
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:24,791
As that fight draws
to a close, however,

386
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:27,833
Wendy and Carla are
confronted by a new horror.

387
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:30,125
This one comes in
the form of a choice.

388
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,708
And perhaps a sacrifice too.

389
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:36,416
Next Time: "Tartaros Chapter
Friends Forever."

390
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,291
The smallest amongst us,
have the courage of giants.
