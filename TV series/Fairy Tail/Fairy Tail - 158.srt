159
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,041
city right in the
middle of the arena?

160
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,291
I've never seen
anything like it before.

161
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,875
[JELLAL] A manifestation
on such a large scale.

162
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,625
How much magic
energy does that require?

163
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,125
Juvia? Lyon?

164
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,458
Where in the heck
did everybody go?

165
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,708
All the others just disappeared.

166
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,875
Now I see.
So this is the game, is it?

167
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,958
High stakes Hide-and-Seek.

168
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,208
Should I be hidin'?

169
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,666
Or should I be
seekin' instead?

170
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,791
I used to play this
game when I was a little kid.

171
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,250
[YEAGER] Is there
somebody looking for us?

172
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,000
[CHAPATI] Those of you
in the stands can catch all

173
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:02,958
the exciting action in
crystal-clear lacrima-vision.

174
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,458
[CHAPATI]
I bet the eight contestants in

175
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,291
the arena wish
they had that luxury.

176
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,916
But that would make it too easy.

177
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,125
[CHAPATI] Speaking of easy,
here are the rules of the game.

178
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:14,208
All the players are hiding
and seeking at the same time!

179
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,000
What does that mean?

180
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,791
[CHAPATI] The main
objective in Hidden is to

181
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,625
locate the other players.

182
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:23,416
Once you've done that, you'll
have to land an attack on them!

183
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,750
[CHAPATI] The player
that successfully

184
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:25,958
connects
their attack,

185
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,625
whether or not it
does any damage,

186
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,916
will then be awarded one point.

187
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,166
Wait. Now what's
going on?

188
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,458
[GRAY] Aw man,
there's hundreds of 'em!

189
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,666
What's with all the look-alikes?

190
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,250
Why are you
getting all pukey?

191
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:54,791
The thought of that many Grays
just really grosses me out, man.

192
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,458
That's extremely difficult.

193
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,541
Even after knowing
Gray for all these years.

194
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,750
I'd probably have trouble
finding the real one.

195
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,333
[CHAPATI] I know they're pretty.

196
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,958
But those copies aren't
just for show, folks.

197
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,625
Attack one of your fake
competitors by mistake,

198
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,875
and it'll cost you one point!

199
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:13,666
It's time to disappear like a
black cat in a dark alleyway.

200
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,416
Fade into your surroundings
and hide in plain sight.

201
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,500
[CHAPATI] Let's play Hidden!

202
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:22,541
[YEAGER] This game
isn't really about

203
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,166
hiding as much as seeking.

204
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,541
It's gonna be tough
figuring out who

205
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,666
the real enemies
are in here, though.

206
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,166
Oh, there are so many beautiful
Grays to feast my eyes on!

207
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,500
But I don't
just have to look,

208
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,333
surely I can wrap my
arms around at least one!

209
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,333
This is heavenly.

210
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,250
[buzzer]

211
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,416
[CHAPATI] And with
that bear hug attack,

212
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,958
Juvia from Fairy
Tail B loses one point!

213
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,208
[CHAPATI] She will be put into
a ten second time-out and

214
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,041
then forced to start again
from another part of the arena.

215
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,625
The same is true if you
are attacked by another player.

216
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,666
One point taken off,
time-out, and then it's

217
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,583
starting all over again
from somewhere else!

218
00:10:58,666 --> 00:10:59,916
What an idiot.

219
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,375
This could prove to be a little

220
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,125
bit of an issue for poor Juvia.

221
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,500
We wouldn't be
having this problem

222
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,291
if I were playing the game.

223
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,250
[CHAPATI] You are allowed
as many restarts

224
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,583
as you need,
but the clock is ticking.

225
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,625
The game will last for
thirty minutes, and of course,

226
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,916
whoever has the most points
at the end takes first place!

227
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,375
[GRAY] I can't believe this.

228
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:21,458
Finding the real people in
here is gonna be impossible.

229
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,208
[NALPUDDING] You dimwit.

230
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,750
You don't have a snowball's
chance if it takes

231
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,375
you this long to
figure out the game.

232
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,708
[GRAY] You're with Raven Tail!

233
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,583
[NALPUDDING]
As a matter of fact I am.

234
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,041
The name's Nalpudding.

235
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,375
Well, it's awfully
nice of you to

236
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,250
come find me like this.

237
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,500
[Nalpudding laughs]

238
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,833
'Cause that means
I don't have to find you!

239
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,875
Ice Hammer!

240
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,625
Oh yeah!

241
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,291
Is there something different
about his maker magic now?

242
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:48,000
And that's what training
will do for ya, guys.

243
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,083
Thanks for givin'
me my first point!

244
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:55,375
[GRAY] What the?
I clearly just pounded the guy!

245
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,458
[Nalpudding laughs]

246
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,625
No way!

247
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:00,958
[NALPUDDING] Nice try.

248
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,541
But this here is
the real thing, see?

249
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,041
I didn't know he'd
be that easy to trick.

250
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,583
Neither did I.

251
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:11,541
And that means another Fairy
Tail team is gonna lose a point.

252
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,416
Man. What a
major screw-up!

253
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,083
Oh well. At least I
learned something.

254
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:24,416
You can use your copies
to get close to an enemy.

255
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,375
And then, when they attack
and reveal themselves

256
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:31,208
you can take them by
surprise and score a point.

257
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,583
[GRAY]
That's how you play Hidden!

258
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,666
Everybody's totally
blended in with the crowds.

259
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,750
How are we supposed to figure

260
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,708
who's real and
who's not in this thing?

261
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,458
I'm glad I'm
not playing this one.

262
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,875
I get lost in a
crowd really easily.

263
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,125
And as we've just seen,
any careless actions

264
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,541
could cause you to be
revealed to the enemy.

265
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,250
How will you proceed.
Gray?

266
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,000
There are a
ton of people in here.

267
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,416
And most of 'em are fakes.

268
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,458
[NALPUDDING] Oh Gray.
You make this too easy.

269
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:08,750
Come on!

270
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,375
He lost another point?

271
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:14,125
This sucks. Why is he
coming after me so hard?

272
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:17,125
[NALPUDDING]
This game is getting really fun!

273
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,791
[CHAPATI] The tension is so
thick in this game of Hidden,

274
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,166
you could cut it with
a knife, with Raven Tail's

275
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,541
Nalpudding quickly
taking the lead.

276
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,083
[CHAPATI] Say, on a field
full of copies of yourself

277
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,875
and your enemies,
how would you figure

278
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,583
out who was real,
and who was just a fake?

279
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,041
There are
a variety of ways

280
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,625
to suss out
which ones are real.

281
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,458
One might begin
by trying to detect

282
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,291
an opponent's magic power.

283
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,666
[JENNY] I'm sure our
crafty little Eve will

284
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,083
figure out a more
sophisticated method.

285
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,958
Searching for
magic might be a start.

286
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,333
It would certainly get
you in the general vicinity.

287
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,125
But pinpointing a
foe would be tough.

288
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,750
Keep screwin' up and it's
gonna cost us the game, Gray!

289
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,916
That little purple guy got
ya two times in a row!

290
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,375
What's up
with Raven Tail?

291
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,333
You know staring
isn't very nice, Blondie.

292
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,000
They're the ones
that attacked Wendy,

293
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,500
and for some
strange reason it seems

294
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,041
like they're only targeting
Gray in this round.

295
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,041
Maybe I'll teach
you some manners.

296
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,625
[IVAN (ALEXAI)]
That's enough, Flare.

297
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,291
Ivan, you scum.

298
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,041
I know you can win this, Gray!

299
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,625
Square one again.

300
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,541
[BETH] Carrot Missiles!
Aw shoot!

301
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,625
I totally missed that guy.

302
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,916
[GRAY] What is that?

303
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,208
Ah yeah!

304
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,791
I was sick of waitin' for
the chance to use magic!

305
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,125
[LYON] So was I!

306
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,750
You.

307
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,375
I've found my rival.
Finally.

308
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,666
[JUVIA] You can't hide
from me, my darling!

309
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,291
Holy crap!

310
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,833
What a view!

311
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,750
[GRAY] Look, I don't need
any help from you, got it?

312
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,500
I'm aware of that.

313
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,916
That was so worth it.

314
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,541
As a matter of fact,
I'm determined to beat you.

315
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,625
Because of the
promise master made.

316
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,916
I'll bet that promise
has something to do with me.

317
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,458
Yes.

318
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,416
[GAJEEL] Are you kidding me?

319
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,250
I don't want anything to do with
that big, stupid freak show!

320
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,250
Well I don't
have any objection.

321
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,291
But getting put on the B team
is kind of insulting, though.

322
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,000
Then what if I
sweeten the deal?

323
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,333
Yes.

324
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:36,625
The members of the winning
team get to do whatever

325
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:39,250
they want to the losing
team for one entire day.

326
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,708
That sounds to
me like it's more of a

327
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,958
punishment game for
the ones on the bottom.

328
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,125
[LAXUS] Whatever we want, huh?

329
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,041
Hey... get me some food.

330
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,250
{NATSU] Right away, Mr. Laxus!

331
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,250
[GAJEEL] One whole day?
Shake it, baby!

332
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,500
[LUCY] With pleasure!

333
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,291
That could be pretty sweet.

334
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,875
Bring me some
salt-grilled mackerel, please!

335
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,166
[ERZA] Of course, ma'am.

336
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,958
Anything that we want?

337
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,958
Oh my.

338
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,166
If master says'
that I have to do this.

339
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,791
Then I've got no choice.

340
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,375
That's true.

341
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,541
Is this some kinda joke?

342
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,333
Hey, Gramps, if you're gonna
make crazy rules like that.

343
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:14,875
Then they have gotta be fair!

344
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,666
That means they better work
if our team wins this thing too!

345
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,083
Yes.
Of course they will.

346
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:20,958
Yeah.

347
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,208
I know exactly
what I want.

348
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,958
[NATSU] Gimme
a Happy impression!

349
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,208
[LAXUS AND GAJEEL]
Aye!

350
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,875
Hold on. That's all
you'd want from them?

351
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:29,833
I want my wish.

352
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,291
So I'm not planning on losing.

353
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,625
Bring it on!

354
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,583
[NALPUDDING] Two fairies
for the price of one!

355
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,750
Why is he only
going after our guild?

356
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:39,833
I don't know.

357
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,083
What in the hell
is this guy's problem?

358
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,291
[CHAPATI]
Wow, would ya look at this?

359
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,916
Our city is turning into
a winter wonderland!

360
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,166
That's gotta be Eve.

361
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,333
[EVE] It's a shame
there are some wizards

362
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,166
here that aren't
affected by the cold.

363
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,666
But most of them are.

364
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,833
I see.

365
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,625
When people are
cold they start to shiver.

366
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,625
And you can see
steam from their breath.

367
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,250
But it doesn't work
that way for the copies.

368
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,083
Pretty smart strategy,

369
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,208
I can see you!
Right there!

370
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:17,375
[CHAPATI] Eve accumulates
a flurry of points!

371
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,583
And the ice wizard Lyon answers
with a storm of his creation!

372
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,625
Unfortunately for you I've spent
my life training in the cold!

373
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,166
Yeah, I kinda figured.

374
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,500
Again?
What's the deal?

375
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,750
Why is this freak
so obsessed with me?

376
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,333
We're still yet to
see any movement on the

377
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,500
board by the top-seeded Rufus
of the Sabertooth guild.

378
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:48,250
He's hasn't lost any points,
but he hasn't scored any either.

379
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,916
[RUFUS] I find this
game dreadfully boring.

380
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,500
Wait!
There he is!

381
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,125
[RUFUS] I've committed
this song to memory.

382
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,750
The rhythm of their
heartbeats, their footsteps,

383
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,541
the tone of their magic.

384
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,041
That's a pretty conspicuous
hiding place if ya ask me!

385
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,375
Ya think that guy
actually wants

386
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,291
the others to find
him for some reason?

387
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,416
Gray, right above you!

388
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:23,833
It's all there.
Inside my mind.

389
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,375
[RUFUS] Memory Make.

390
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:34,541
What is this magic?
I've never heard of it.

391
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,458
[RUFUS]
Night of Shooting Stars!

392
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,333
You could really learn
a thing or two about hiding!

393
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,541
Oh, no! A fake?

394
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:18,250
[RUFUS] Not quite!
You haven't lost a point.

395
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,875
That was a memory
of my being there.

396
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,583
[Nalpudding cries out]

397
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:24,875
[RUFUS]
I find that's much more

398
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,458
effective than
using mere decoys.

399
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,250
[CHAPATI] And the hits
rain down from above,

400
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,666
turning the scoreboard
upside down!

401
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,375
This is what you'd expect
from a guy like Rufus!

402
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,666
Sabertooth takes the lead!

403
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,333
[RUFUS] The organizers
really need to work harder.

404
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,333
These games aren't
the least bit interesting.

405
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,250
[RUFUS] After all.

406
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,000
I was still able
to claim victory

407
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,583
without even needing to hide.

408
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:51,958
They may have
spotted me but

409
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,791
nobody even came
close to touching me.

410
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:58,666
[RUFUS] The best they could do
was merely chase my memory.

411
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,333
Wow.
That was unbelievable.

412
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,541
No kidding.

413
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,916
I think I'm starting
to see why

414
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,208
they're the number
one guild in Fiore.

415
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,083
Man.

416
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,458
Thattaboy Rufus!

417
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,958
I can't wait until everybody
sees what Sting can do!

418
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,625
Yay for Rufus!

419
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,291
That's some kind
of maker magic?

420
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,583
He's truly a force
to be reckoned with.

421
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:20,666
I'll watch out.

422
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,166
But we can still beat them.

423
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,666
[GRAY] Ya think
you've outsmarted us?

424
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,625
This game's called Hidden,
so start playin' by the rules!

425
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,625
[GRAY] Aw crap!

426
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,541
That Rufus guy was standing
completely open up there.

427
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,708
But still Nalpudding passed
him over to attack Gray.

428
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,250
[crowds cheering]

429
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:48,666
[CHAPATI] And with that,
the game is over!

430
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,208
[CHAPATI] So let's take a
look at the ol' scoreboard!

431
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,791
That was absolutely
pitiful, Lyon!

432
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,166
You should be ashamed!

433
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,833
Please master, you
should really calm down!

434
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,375
Eve could've done a
whole lot worse I guess.

435
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:03,708
Not too bad.

436
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,916
Fifth place, huh?
We'd better step up our game.

437
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,583
We gotta give Beth
some credit for trying!

438
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:14,625
[CHAPATI] Just as we expected,
Sabertooth claims the top spot!

439
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,000
[YAJIMA] Stupendously done!

440
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,833
[CHAPATI] Both Fairy Tail
teams gave it their all.

441
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,708
But unfortunately,
it wasn't enough

442
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,958
to get them out of last place.

443
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,625
[YAJIMA] Better luck next time!

444
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,750
Well what do you expect
from the weakest guild in Fiore?

445
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,083
They're such losers!

446
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:31,291
Get used to being
in dead last, ya has-beens!

447
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,708
You'd better stop laughing
at us right now, or else!

448
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,750
Ooh!
He's mad!

449
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,875
What, are you gonna cry?

450
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:42,791
Natsu.

451
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,166
Let 'em laugh, they won't
be doing it for very long.

452
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,625
[GRAY] Sorry.

453
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,541
[LUCY] Don't worry about it.
It's only the first game.

454
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:57,833
[GRAY] Raven Tail.
And that pompous wizard.

455
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,916
I will be gettin
payback for this,

456
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,541
so they should watch out.

457
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:10,166
Coming up next is the
battle part of the contest!

458
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,750
One member of each team
will participate in a match.

459
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,000
But this isn't
a tournament setup!

460
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,500
It's the game's organizers
who decide who's

461
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,916
going to be duking
it out in the battles, right?

462
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,083
I'm sure they'll set up some

463
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,708
spectacular displays
of magical skills.

464
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,041
I've just received the lineups,

465
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,875
so we'll find out how
spectacular those will be!

466
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:29,416
[CHAPATI] Our very first match
of this year's Grand Magic Games

467
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,250
will test the abilities
of Fairy Tail A's,

468
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,750
zodiac wielder, Lucy Heartfilia.

469
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:34,916
