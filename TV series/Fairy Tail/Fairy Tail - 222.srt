00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,708
[LUCY]
Lucy here!

2
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,625
I've been doing jobs
for the Fairy Tail guild

3
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:42,958
for a while now, and each one's
been more intense than the next.

4
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:45,625
I need to step up my
game to tackle them.

5
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,000
And the best way to do that

6
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,708
is add some spells
to my repertoire.

7
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,291
So, that's what I'm doing!

8
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:55,791
And not just new spells.
All new Magic!

9
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,000
Sweet!

10
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,500
So, there a reason for
the sudden interest?

11
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:40,166
[LUCY] Well, I can wreck shop
with the best of them,

12
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,791
but take away my celestial
keys and I'm helpless.

13
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,625
If I were to learn
transformation magic,

14
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,875
I should be able to
handle myself no problem!

15
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,375
Not to mention it sounds
totally wicked awesome.

16
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:50,375
Aye, sir!

17
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:51,916
Wait.

18
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,250
What possible use could you
have for transformation magic?

19
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,958
I'm always lookin'
for ways to step up

20
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,041
my prankin' game!

21
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,125
[HAPPY]
They'll never know what hit 'em!

22
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,291
I should've figured as much.

23
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,291
[HAPPY]
Transform!

24
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,583
Transformation magic can
get pretty complicated.

25
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:13,375
But I'm sure you can master the
basic level quickly enough!

26
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:14,875
You really think so?

27
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:15,791
Sign us up!

28
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,250
Let's do this!

29
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,833
[MIRAJANE] For safety's sake,
we should practice with

30
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,208
a bit more open space.

31
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,375
Why don't we all head
somewhere outside?

32
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,791
[MACAO, WAKABA]
Transformation magic.

33
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,625
Something like that
would help us get back

34
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,541
into the spotlight.
We're not getting any younger.

35
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,458
If we follow them,
we could learn to transform

36
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,875
and be back in our
primes by sundown.

37
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,666
[MACAO, WAKABA]
Sounds like a plan.

38
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,916
Indeed. The idea has merit.

39
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,083
[ERZA] Maybe I should
learn to transform.

40
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,583
[WENDY] Hey, Evergreen!
Are you about to head out?

41
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:46,916
What's the job?

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,375
Oh, there isn't a job.

43
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:51,000
A new boutique just opened
in Magnolia to rave reviews,

44
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,916
and I intend to
shop 'til I drop.

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,958
[giggles] I've been wanting
to get a new outfit or two.

46
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,291
Maybe I should tag along.

47
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,875
Not a bad idea!

48
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:01,666
It's important for girls to stay
in tune with the latest fashion.

49
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,541
Fashion isn't just for girls!
Men can be stylish, too!

50
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,125
Hell yeah!

51
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,541
I was thinkin' of addin' some
pyrotechnics and a zoot suit

52
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,708
to my stage outfit!

53
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,875
I've made my decision!

54
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,583
[ALL]
Uh...

55
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,875
[MIRAJANE] And those
are the basic principles

56
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,625
of transformation magic.
Any questions?

57
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,333
[LUCY]
Uh... Way too many to ask.

58
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,958
[NATSU, HAPPY snoring]

59
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,833
Are you two serious
about learning this stuff,

60
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,916
or did you just wanna
annoy me for the day?

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,583
[MIRAJANE] Now, there are
some important things

62
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,458
to keep in mind
when transforming.

63
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,916
Nap time's over.

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,583
Uh, sorry.

65
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,291
[LUCY]
Don't you dare sleep again.

66
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,458
[NATSU]
I can't help it.

67
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,541
It's because this is
so freakin' boring.

68
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,333
[HAPPY]
Aye.

69
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,041
I wouldn't mind
a little less theory

70
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,750
and more practice,
ya know. Whaddya say?

71
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,500
I suppose it can't be helped.

72
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,125
All right then, we can give
transformation a shot.

73
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,500
[NATSU, HAPPY, LUCY]
Awesome!

74
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:57,500
[LUCY] You're like my
favorite teacher ever, Mira!

75
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,166
[MACAO, WAKABA]
It's about time.

76
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,791
We'll start with
something simple.

77
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,500
A basic form transformation.

78
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,458
Like so.

79
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,750
[NATSU, LUCY gasp]

80
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,125
Okay.

81
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,250
Something's off here, but I
can't put my paws on it.

82
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,875
[MIRAJANE] At the basic level,
your clothes stay the same.

83
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,500
[HAPPY]
Ah! That was it!

84
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,750
[LUCY]
And the next level?

85
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,250
Intermediate will
change your clothes!

86
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,708
[NATSU, LUCY]
Whoa!

87
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:23,875
[LUCY]
Awesome!

88
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,291
[NATSU]
Even her armor is perfect!

89
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,500
[HAPPY]
Yup! That's Erza, all right!

90
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,250
[giggles] Memorizing even
the smallest details

91
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,166
will help you sell the illusion.

92
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,583
Are you sure about that?

93
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,083
'Cause, I'm not exactly shakin'
in my sandals over here.

94
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,125
--[ERZA] Natsu.
--[NATSU] Huh?

95
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,125
I trust you and Gray have
been behaving yourselves

96
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,125
like I've asked you to?

97
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,291
[whimpers]

98
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,041
You even sound just like her!

99
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,916
Being true to the
character is key.

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,791
If you wanna be a master.

101
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,041
That's cool!

102
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,583
No kiddin'!

103
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,875
For a second, I thought Erza
had appeared out of thin air!

104
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:59,541
[MIRAJANE] And, if you make
it to the advanced level.

105
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,166
You can alter your physical
form completely, at will.

106
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,416
[NATSU, LUCY gasp]

107
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,083
[HAPPY]
You look delicious!

108
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,666
[MACAO, WAKABA]
Whoa!

109
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,750
[MIRAJANE] And, if you
get even more advanced.

110
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:09,541
[LUCY gasps]

111
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:10,791
She's flyin'!

112
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,833
You can change your abilities!

113
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:14,625
[NATSU, LUCY]
Huh?

114
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,333
She's foxier than before!

115
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:19,208
Even your fighting strength
can be altered this way.

116
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,541
Did you hear that?

117
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,083
If we learn transformation
magic, we're set!

118
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,416
No more lounging around
the guild losing our hair.

119
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,166
[LUCY] I had no idea there
was so much to this!

120
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,458
[NATSU]
I wanna try next!

121
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,208
[MIRAJANE giggles]
Sounds good.

122
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,083
Mira, could you turn
into a fish again?

123
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,458
I'd really like to see it.

124
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,333
I think kitty's gone psycho.

125
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,208
That was a little too
advanced for you to try

126
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,333
right off the bat.
So, let's start

127
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,208
with a beginner
transformation.

128
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,875
Come on, we're not newbies!

129
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,958
Skip the kid stuff and
show us the goodies.

130
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,375
Yeah, we can do it!

131
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,916
[ERZA]
Enough of your insolence!

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,958
[HAPPY, NATSU yelp]

133
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,250
I'll have to try that.

134
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,041
[MIRAJANE] We're starting
with the basics for safety.

135
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,250
I won't tell you again,
so don't forget.

136
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,708
I had a feeling
I'd rock this.

137
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,500
[WENDY]
You're so pretty!

138
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,666
You're not looking
shabby either, Wendy.

139
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,000
[WENDY]
You really think so?

140
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,833
I was worried it might
be a bit "flashy".

141
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,041
[EVERGREEN]
Not at all!

142
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,833
This is your chance to be bold.

143
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,750
Show off your looks!

144
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,333
Is this bold enough for you?

145
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,666
[WENDY]
Wow, Carla!

146
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,458
You know how to
dress to impress!

147
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,833
[EVERGREEN]
Agreed.

148
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,916
Yes, you've certainly found
some keepers, ladies!

149
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
They're so you!

150
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,333
No.

151
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,125
It isn't bold enough to
clearly state my devotion

152
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,000
to the warrior's way of fashion.

153
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,791
[GAJEEL]
Now this is cool!

154
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,083
[PANTHERLILY]
Perhaps too cool.

155
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,000
[GAJEEL, PANTHERLILY laugh]

156
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,166
[gasps]

157
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,791
[WENDY, CARLA, EVERGREEN]
Uh...

158
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,166
Are we dynamic, or what?

159
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,208
We're the heroes
this city deserves!

160
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,291
[ERZA]
Heroes?

161
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,541
[GAJEEL, PANTHERLILY]
Justice!

162
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,416
Like a couple of
children at play.

163
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,041
No matter their age,
men are always children,.

164
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,291
Excuse me, sir, but
what are those outfits?

165
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:00,041
You truly have a keen eye
for fashion, Miss Erza.

166
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,458
Legend has it...

167
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,833
Long ago, people donned
those suits and defeated evil

168
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,125
in this town as
mighty superheroes!

169
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,166
At least, that's
what the label said.

170
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,625
I see.

171
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:13,791
Costumes for dispensing
justice. I'm deeply moved.

172
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,291
Is she serious about this?

173
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,166
Yeah. Definitely.

174
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,666
[CARLA] Just look at her face.
There's no stopping her now.

175
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,333
Hero! That's it!

176
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,333
Sir. I'm in your capable hands.

177
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,625
Just leave everything
to me, darling.

178
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,041
Am I good or am I good?

179
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,375
[ERZA]
Mm!

180
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,500
[ERZA] It's as comfortable
as I'd hoped.

181
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:42,833
Perhaps even more so.

182
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,833
I had it tailored to your
exact measurements.

183
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,083
I feel as if I'm
brimming with power!

184
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,333
The only explanation is destiny.

185
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,958
That suit has been waiting
for you to put it on!

186
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,500
Yes, that must be it!

187
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:58,208
From now on, I am Fairy Woman,
Defender of Magnolia! Woosh!

188
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,791
[WENDY]
So, uh...

189
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,250
Do you think we should
do something about this?

190
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,250
[EVERGREEN]
About what? I saw nothing.

191
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,041
Yes, child, it was
nothing but a breeze,

192
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,625
and should be forgotten
as soon as possible.

193
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,875
Natsu and Happy will
try turning into Lucy.

194
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,500
Lucy, you'll try Natsu.

195
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,208
--[NATSU, LUCY] Sure thing!
--[HAPPY] Aye, sir!

196
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,750
[WAKABA] 'Kay, what are
we supposed to try?

197
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,250
[MACAO]
What are you, brain dead?

198
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,333
If we pull this off,
we could turn into our young,

199
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,500
handsome selves again!

200
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:27,083
[WAKABA]
Oh, right! I forgot about that.

201
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,916
[MACAO] And then, maybe my
ex-wife will finally

202
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
come back to me.

203
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,500
[WAKABA] Maybe my wife will
finally stop henpecking me

204
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,333
and see me for the
gorgeous hunk I truly am.

205
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:40,166
And I can have my
hairdo back again!

206
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,458
[MIRAJANE] Start by looking
deep into each other's eyes.

207
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,750
[LUCY]
Yes, ma'am!

[HAPPY grunts]

211
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,166
Good, now really try
to picture your partner

212
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,666
inside your mind.

Picture it!

Picture it!

[WAKABA]
Pompadour!

217
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,833
Look even closer. That's it!

218
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,750
Try to take in all
your partner's details.

219
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,833
Oh. A pimple.

220
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,333
[LUCY]
Shut up!

221
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,708
[MIRAJANE] The fact that you
two are friends should help,

222
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,208
but it goes even faster when
the pair is extra close.

223
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,375
Like this?

224
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,458
[LUCY] Uh! That's...
not what she meant.

225
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:35,250
[MIRAJANE]
Focus on the person. Very good.

226
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,208
Now, imagine that you
have their face and body.

227
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,666
Then, focus your magic power

228
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,250
on the picture of
them in your head.

It's fine!

You shouldn't expect
it to work right away.

And you call yourself a wizard?

like you did any better!

Yeah.

But I've already
figured out how to do it.

So did I!

overshadows us for a reason.

Okay, we've had our trial run.

It doesn't feel like I've dealt
a blow to the forces of evil.

If that's the case.

474
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,208
[MACAO groans]

475
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,416
Looks like she did it.

476
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,750
I never doubted
her for a minute!

477
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:36,750
What gives?

478
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,166
We finally turned
back to normal!

479
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,500
Talk about lame.

480
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,750
I didn't even get to throw
a single punch at 'em.

481
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,750
Transformation magic's tougher
than you thought, huh?

482
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,333
[ERZA] Are you okay?
Was anyone injured?

483
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,083
[LUCY] We're good,
thanks to you, Erza!

484
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:52,166
[ERZA]
I am not Erza. I'm Fairy Woman!

485
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,291
[LUCY whimpers]

486
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:53,958
I'm scared.

487
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,166
That's unexpected.

488
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,875
What the--?!

489
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,458
[ERZA]
What's wrong with your faces?

490
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:02,000
You've gotta be kiddin'!
We should be asking you that!

491
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:02,916
Huh?

492
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,916
[HAPPY]
She's turned realistic!

493
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,875
[LUCY]
A few days later.

494
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,708
If I ever try that
crap again, shoot me.

495
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:18,916
I guess we'll just hafta
do our best as we are now.

496
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,208
The real question is "when will
I change back to normal"?

497
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,375
[HAPPY]
Hey, look!

498
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,666
Apparently Erza--
I mean, Fairy Woman--

499
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,458
saved Magnolia again today.

500
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:28,791
[laughs]

501
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,125
She did? Huh.

502
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:15,166
[HAPPY] Natsu, why are you
sitting in bed like that?

503
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,083
[NATSU] I found this
weird egg, so I'm warming it

504
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:18,208
to see what'll happen.

505
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,625
[HAPPY]
Whoa! Cool!

506
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,125
Do you think it's
gonna hatch soon?

507
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:22,666
[NATSU]
I'm not sure yet!

508
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,541
But, if it does, you'll have
a little brother to play with!

509
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:26,958
[HAPPY] Are you for real?
I'm so excited!

510
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:28,291
[NATSU]
We'll need a name, though.

511
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,333
[HAPPY] Right. If he's
my little brother, then...

512
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:31,708
[NATSU]
Happy Mark II!

513
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:33,333
[HAPPY]
Absolutely not!

514
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,416
[HAPPY, NATSU]
Next time: It's Kemo-Kemo!

515
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,625
[NATSU]
Okay, how 'bout this?

516
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:39,458
If Mark II is no good,
then Happy 2!

517
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:41,958
[HAPPY]
No! That's basically the same!
