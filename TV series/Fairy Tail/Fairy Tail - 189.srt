[DARTON] The Games are
nearly at an end, Princess.

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,500
Yes. And as I watch
the action, my source's words

3
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:28,833
haunt me even more.
I fear they're true.

4
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:31,875
I take it you still haven't
changed your mind, then?

5
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:35,083
If this "time-traveler's"
prophecy turns out to be true,

6
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,625
will you activate
the Eclipse Two project?

7
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,333
Trust me, I didn't
make this choice lightly.

8
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,750
At first, I didn't
want to believe it.

9
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:45,166
But, as time went by,
I wondered.

10
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,416
"Do I really believe
that they're wrong?

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,083
Or am I just afraid?"

12
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:52,083
Understandable, given
the horror of the predictions.

13
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:53,500
Yes, I know.

14
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:56,875
I feel that this is the
only way to decide our course.

15
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,916
[HISUI] If this final match
ends as they foretold,

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,833
I will take it
as proof that they do

17
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:05,041
possess knowledge of the future.

18
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:07,500
[DARTON] Meaning the claim
that a swarm of dragons

19
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:10,625
will destroy the Kingdom
of Fiore is also true.

20
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:13,916
For all our sakes,
I hope they're wrong.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,333
For now, let's watch.

22
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:20,875
As the battle unfolds so,
too, will the future we face.

You're surprised?

He did beat everyone

That's Laxus?

He's certainly become powerful.

he is your grandson.

00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,833
[JUVIA yells]

162
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,375
If you don't do something
we're going to lose this!

163
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,250
Huh?

164
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,333
Water Nebula!

165
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,083
Ice Geyser!

166
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:32,166
[BOTH yell]

167
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,291
[LYON] This is all your fault!

168
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,750
[SHELIA]
Sorry, I just zoned out!

169
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,125
[GRAY]
That's a win for teamwork!

170
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,166
[GRAY] How long are you
gonna hold my hand?

171
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,333
[JUVIA giggles]

172
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,916
Till we're dead and buried.

173
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,708
[GRAY] That's so creepy!

174
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,791
Wait, they lost?
There's no way!

175
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,541
They're my strongest wizards!

176
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,791
Ugh! Shelia!

177
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:12,458
No! No! It can't be over!

178
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,833
[SHERRY] You're gonna
spin your head off, old hag!

179
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,833
[CHAPATI] Lamia Scale is
out of the match for good!

180
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,208
Fairy Tail is
truly unstoppable!

181
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,458
[MATO]
And they're sitting pretty

182
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,208
at fifty-eight points, punkins!

183
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:44,250
Loh hoset! Loh Hosetia!

184
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,833
Nothing can save you!

185
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,833
Yi Ragdoh!

186
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:55,791
Huh?

187
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,208
She cut through the spell!

188
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,750
I saw! But I still
don't believe my eyes!

189
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,958
"The Nakagami Armor.
It consumes magic power at

190
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,708
such an intense rate
that no wizard has been able

191
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,916
to utilize it
for the past ten years!"

192
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,708
[ROMEO] Where were you
hiding that book?

193
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:12,791
[LEVY] "However, if anyone
were to don this armor,

194
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,916
they would become
a force without equal

195
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,416
and conquer all that
stand against them!"

196
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,958
But how? No!
You should be out of power!

197
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,125
How can you still be standing?

198
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,416
[ERZA] I told you.
I'll keep standing

199
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,916
until I've
put you in the dirt.

200
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,041
[MINERVA] No, stop!

201
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,541
I will have revenge!

202
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,041
Stay back! You've won this!

203
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,166
Let me go!

204
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,250
Nakagami Starlight!

205
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,750
[yells]

206

[MINERVA grunts, groans]

207
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,791
[MINERVA groans]

208
00:12:53,958 --> 00:13:00,000
[MINERVA whimpers sotly]

209
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:07,333
[CHAPATI] Erza does it!
She defeats Sabertooth's leader

210
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,791
and scores five points!

211
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,625
I guess we know who
the truly regal one is!

212
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:16,500
All hail the Queen of
the Fairies, Erza Scarlet!

213
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,958
Most of the other guilds'
wizards are out of the game!

214
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:22,416
Can Fairy Tail win without
losing a single member?

215
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,416
We'll find out!
Don't you dare look away!

216
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,041
I sure won't!

217
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,708
Mr. Yajima!
Any comments?

218
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:40,125
Well, I'd say Fairy Tail is
close to winning it all now!

219
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,000
[MATO] Incredible!

220
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,375
Hear that?

221
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:44,916
We could win it all?

222
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,500
Even after we started
this thing dead last.

223
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,166
You Idiot! I'm gonna cry
if you keep that up!

224
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,833
Knock it off!

225
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,833
[MALE CROWD 189D] Isn't there
still one person left?

226
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,250
[MALE CROWD 189E] Yeah.
But what do you expect one guy

227
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,000
to do against all of them?

228
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,625
[FEMALE CROWD 189A]
Nothin', that's what!

229
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,666
[MALE CROWD 189F] The fairies
got this win in the bag!

230
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,458
[CROWD chants] Fairy Tail!
Fairy Tail! Fairy Tail!

231
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,875
[chanting continues]

232
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,083
This is it.

233
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,541
Indeed.

234
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,416
[STING]
Hm. Well whaddya' know.

235
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,041
It's all gone exactly
as I hoped it would.

236
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:24,125
Must be fate.
That, or good karma.

237
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,125
Uh.

238
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,166
What is it?

239
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,583
Oh, it's just the scores.

240
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,375
[MALE CROWD 189H]
What? Is something off?

241
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,375
[MALE CROWD 189G] No, it's...
Look, if Sting can somehow

242
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:37,125
beat all five of the fairies,
what'll happen then?

243
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,458
 Let's see.
The leader is worth five,

244
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,041
and the other four are--

245
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,541
[gasps]

246
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,333
[CHAPATI] Nine points! If Sting
manages to defeat all five

247
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,625
of Fairy Tails' members
he'll score just enough

248
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,375
for Sabertooth to make a
come-from-behind victory!

249
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,958
It's possible, but unlikely!

250
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,166
He could! All of
Fairy Tails' members

251
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,750
are covered with injuries!

252
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,333
[MATO] Is he going to
beat all of them?

253
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,916
[MALE CROWD 189I]
Did Sting plan this?

254
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,541
[MALE CROWD 189J]
No way. That'd be crazy!

255
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:13,708
[STING] I'm ready Fairy Tail!
Let's go! Come and get me!

256
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,208
[gasps]

257
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,458
[MAKAROV growls]

258
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,541
[CROWD gasps]

259
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,583
Now there's a sight.
It's weird, being surrounded

260
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:57,125
by heroes from my childhood
really isn't all that grand.

261
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,708
Enough chit-chat.

262
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,000
We didn't come out here
to make pals.

263
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:04,208
[GRAY] We'll fight you
one-on-one. Pick somebody.

264
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,125
Why not all at once?

265
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:10,125
With those injuries,
one-on-one'll be boring.

266
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,375
Do not underestimate us.
Ask your comrades.

267
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,875
Wouldn't dream of it!

268
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,958
I'm trying to treat you
with the respect you deserve.

269
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:21,083
That's why I'll
destroy you all together!

270
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,416
I've been waiting
for this moment!

271
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,583
I'll show you
how strong I've become.

272
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,166
I'll do it for Lector!

273
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,916
Oh yeah?

274
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,375
You wanna fight us
by yourself? Are you serious?

275
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,916
'Course I am! I'm more
than a match for you!

276
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,791
Losing Lector brought me pain,

277
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,833
but it also
granted me new power!

278
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,583
For Lector, for my best friend,

279
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:46,375
I'm gonna beat you
and win it all!

280
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,208
[ERZA] Very well.
If you're so determined

281
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,958
to see this to the end,

282
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,166
we'll give you
the fight you want.

283
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,750
[STING] Now you're talkin'!

284
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,833
Prepare to witness
the awakened power

285
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:11,000
of a dragon slayer!

286
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,166
[chuckles]

287
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,625
Huh?

288
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:33,666
[STING] Why am I hesitating?
They're all bruised and beaten.

289
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:39,791
They'd probably fall
over if I just blew on them!

290
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,666
Get a grip!
You've come this far!

291
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,916
Why the hell are you wavering?

292
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,958
All you have to do
is beat these guys

293
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,458
and you'll have done
everything Milady told you.

294
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:53,125
You'll get to see Lector again!

295
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,791
Yes. Do it for him!

296
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:03,250
[STING] Get moving.
I've grown so much!

297
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,750
My feelings for Lector have
made me stronger than ever!

I can't beat you.

[CROWD murmurs]

304
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,541

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Hm.

320
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,125
[chuckles]

321
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,583
[giggles softly]

322
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:45,333
[ERZA] Sting. Why did you
back down from the fight?

323
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,666
I was so sure I'd win.

324
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:55,791
[STING] That's all I had to do,
and I would see him again.

325
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:59,875
But all of a sudden,
it's like I just lost hope.

326
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,125
I don't know why exactly.

327
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,541
But I know I don't
have your strength.

328
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,666
And I guess I
felt like I didn't

329
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,250
deserve to see him. Not yet.

330
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,750
You still can.

331
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,208
[MILLIANNA] Erzy!

332
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,291
[STING gasps]

333
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,041
[MILLIANNA giggles]

334
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,083
[STING] Aah.

335
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:31,666
[LECTOR gasps]

336
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,458
[STING quavered breathing]

337
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:37,250
[LECTOR] Mm. Ugh. Ah!

338
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,416
Lector!

339
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:43,041
[LECTOR] Aah! Sting! It's you!

340
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:46,833
You're okay! Lector!

341
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,791
[LECTOR sobbing]

342
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:58,041
[STING laughs]

343
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:13,416
[LECTOR sobbing]

344
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:37,666
[ARCADIOS]
Princess! Princess Hisui!

345
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:42,541
Don't tell me!
She's already on her way?

346
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,500
[DARTON] So Fairy Tail won
without losing a member,

347
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,208
and Sting surrendered to them.

348
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:53,208
As I feared, the unpredictable
has been predicted.

349
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:57,083
[HISUI] Now I'm sure of it.
My advisor is from our future.

350
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,750
 Which means
their horrific past

351
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:01,416
will soon be our present.

352
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,750
[HISUI] A battle for
the survival of humankind

353
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,375
is about to begin!
Move the Eclipse Two,

354
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,958
henceforth known as the
Eclipse Cannon, above ground!

355
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,458
[MALE SOLDIERS yell]

356
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,333
Any of you
know what time it is?

357
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:18,166
No clue! It's gotta
be night by now!

358
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,791
The games should be over!

359
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,041
Maybe we won and
all of this will end too!

360
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,916
'Course we won!
Which means we can't be

361
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,500
wasting time here!

362
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:28,125
Last I checked,
we had a kingdom to save!

363
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,625
[NATSU] Let's meet up
with Gramps and the others.

364
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:35,666
They need to know about the
Eclipse before it's too late!

365
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,500
[NATSU] All right!
Fairy Tail takes the gold!

366
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:16,666
[HAPPY]
You know what that means!

367
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,375
Party at the guild hall!
Bring on the fish!

368
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,291
[NATSU] Yeah! Man, I can't
wait to stuff my face!

369
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:25,541
[HAPPY] Hold on. Some strange
man just showed up!

370
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:29,250
[NATSU] Whoever he is, he smells
just as funky as he looks.

371
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:32,458
[NATSU and HAPPY] Next time:
The One Who Closes the Gate!

372
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:34,625
[HAPPY] Natsu, I hate to
cut the party short,

373
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,041
but we've got a problem!

374
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:38,208
[NATSU] I know!
All right, creepy.

375
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:41,541
Get ready for a grade-A
Dragon Slayer thrashing!
