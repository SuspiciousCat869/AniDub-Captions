1
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,291
What was the source
of all that shaking?

2
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,583
Our Fortress had a stronger
than expected reaction

3
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,416
to the unsealing of Face.

4
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,625
So, you did unseal Face?

5
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Then, does that mean
you killed Jellal?

6
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:42,208
[KYOKA]
No. We did not.

7
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,291
We did break the seal however.

8
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,916
After finding a
different method.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,458
What exactly are you
trying to achieve?

10
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,416
[ERZA] Activating Face
would purge all magic

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,416
from this continent.
Why would you want that?

12
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,583
What would it
accomplish for you?

13
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,333
Everything we've done...

14
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:05,375
...we've done so that
we may return to Zeref.

15
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,750
What do you mean
"return" to him?

16
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:12,416
[KYOKA]
You're such a fool!

17
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:16,416
[KYOKA] These restraints are
designed to inhibit magic.

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,125
But they have no effect on
curses, thus no effect on me!

19
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:22,166
[gasps]

20
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:29,208
So, you're all
followers of Zeref.

21
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:31,041
"Followers" would be
an understatement.

22
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,375
No, we're more
like his children.

23
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:36,291
We were all born of
the sacred books.

24
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,416
Born of the Books of Zeref!

25
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,708
It's only natural for us
to have faith in our Creator.

26
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:47,666
I have no problem with
faith in others.

27
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,416
But it can't justify what
the heart knows is wrong!

28
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,791
[KYOKA]
How could a human understand?

29
00:01:56,375 --> 00:02:00,000
[ERZA] Humans have beliefs
of their own, and faith too.

30
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:03,791
And we need that, but
we mustn't let it blind us.

31
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:09,000
We think for ourselves,
and we stand for our beliefs.

32
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,291
What's the deal?

33
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,333
They're all frozen in place.

34
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,416
[ZEREF] You've come
quite a long way, Natsu.

Uh.

the library of Zeref.

Where all my books reside.

39
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:31,375
[ZEREF] Have you enjoyed
your visit so far, Natsu?

40
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,583
I hope my creations haven't
been too hard on you.

41
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,333
It's you again.

42
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,625
[ZEREF]
Strange, isn't it?

43
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:04,666
Given the right motivation, even
beings of chaos can collaborate.

44
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,000
[ZEREF]
Tartaros.

45
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,541
A collection of my finest works.

46
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:16,791
Of course, I can't take any
credit for their organization.

47
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:20,458
Apparently, that belongs
solely to Master E.N.D.

48
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,125
You must be so proud of him.

49
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:40,541
[NATSU] This E.N.D., he's the
one Igneel tried to kill, right?

50
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:47,583
It would be more accurate to say
that Igneel couldn't kill him.

51
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,250
Then I'll have ta finish
what he started.

52
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:54,000
Beginning with you!
Then your monster!

I have no doubt that you can.

57
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:12,750
[ZEREF] But first, you should
consider why Igneel failed.

58
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,666
The answer might
surprise you.

59
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,875
[gasps]

60
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:21,875
E.N.D. is my most powerful
creation. My legacy.

61
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,500
You'll face the same
choice as Igneel.

62
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,958
To let live, or to kill.

63
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,416
Either way, I look
forward to it.

64
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,500
I've enjoyed our conversation.

65
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,208
[NATSU] Hold it!
You're not making any sense!

66
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:44,166
[ZEREF] Tartaros is only doing
this so they can meet me.

67
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,000
They should get the chance
to see it through to the end.

68

If I waltzed in
here prematurely,

69
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,583
it would spoil all the fun.

70
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,708
Who will reach me
first, I wonder?

71
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,041
You, or E.N.D.?

Well done. You've
opened a path for us.

we upside down?

Sorry, but we don't have
time to play catch up.

That just leaves

You can take me

[HAPPY gasps]

163
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,875
[HAPPY]
Look at all of the writing.

164
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,250
And that big floating
sphere in the middle.

165
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,125
Doesn't it look like a globe?

166
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:46,208
[CARLA] This must be some
kind of command center.

167
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,375
[FRANMALTH]
How could they make it this far?

168
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:52,166
Those worthless guards couldn't
be more pathetic if they tried.

169

[LUCY]
Hey. D'ya see that?

170

[WENDY gasps]

171
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,333
I had hoped Erza was wrong,

172
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:00,208
but it looks like the Face
has been unsealed.

173
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,125
How do we stop it?

174
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,041
Could we use this magic circle?

175
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,250
Maybe it could seal
it all over again.

176
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:10,375
Perhaps. But there's no
way for us to operate it.

177
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:11,750
We're locked out.

178
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,750
Hold on.

179
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,166
If I'm reading this right,

180
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,000
the Face can only be activated
by its on-site controls.

181
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,791
We might be in luck here.

182
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,875
It's already started?

183
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,208
[FRANMALTH chuckles]

184
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:27,791
[FRANMALTH] You sure
work fast, Ezel. Well done.

185
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:28,833
Oh no!

[LUCY gasps]

187
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,208
I don't wanna jump
to conclusions,

188
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,750
but this looks like a countdown.

There's only 41 more minutes.

192
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,958
Then all magic on the continent
will be purged from existence.

193
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,750
What do we do? What do we do?

194
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,458
It's every cat for himself!
Fly! Run away!

195
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,541
Head for the hills but...!

196
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,291
Freaking out isn't
going to help us.

197
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,333
[LUCY]
Should we wreck the place?

198
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:03,416
[WENDY] I don't think we can
stop it unless we go to it.

[HAPPY whimpering]

200
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,166
We don't have time to
tell the others about this.

201
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,041
It's in our paws now.

202
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,333
It is?

Ee! Perfect timing!

[MAN] The prayers of
these woeful maidens

206
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:23,583
resonate like the bitter
toll of hell's bells.

207

The Demon Light shall shine with
the radiance of a morning star,

Oh fairy maidens who have fallen

into the netherworld, may you
wander Purgatory as corpses.

Is that... a skeleton?

It's just a mask... I hope.

215
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:17,333
There's no time. We need to
get out of this place, and fast.

Okay.

217
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,333
Stopping the Face
is all that matters.

If we don't,
there will be chaos.

Yes, I did. Thanks for summoning
such tasty souls for me to eat.

It's really not a hard
concept to grasp.

323
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:35,000
[NATSU] Oh, and so we're
clear, Carla is a cat.

324
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:38,333
Uhh. Okay, now you're
just being annoying!

325
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,500
You will release
Taurus and Aries.

326
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,583
In your dreams, pig tails.

327
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,708
They're part of my
precious collection now,

328
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,875
and I have no intention
of giving them up.

329
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,416
[NATSU]
Fine by me.

330
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,958
It'll be a blast ripping
them out of you.

331
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,833
Rat bastard!

332
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,333
Oh, so it's okay
for you to say it?

333
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,708
Natsu!

334
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,083
[LUCY]
Aries!

335
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,166
[NATSU gasps]

336
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,041
No fair!

337
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,583
[groans]

338
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,750
I can't hit him.

339
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,125
That's fightin' dirty!

340
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,375
I bet your soul is top notch.

341
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,458
I can't wait to add
it to my collection.

342
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,625
Too bad it's not for sale!

343
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,500
Please don't roast
my tender loin!

344
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,041
Taurus, no!

345
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:30,875
[growls]

346
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,375
[NATSU]
Sorry.

347
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,958
I can hit you!

348
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:37,333
[TAURUS]
Mooooo!

349
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,458
Horrible.

350
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,458
I understand where he's
comin' from, but still.

351
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:53,125
You brat! I'll kill you!

352
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,416
Well, if the small fries
aren't going to cut it,

353
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,541
I have no choice but to show
you my most powerful soul!

354
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,708
You asked for this!

355
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:08,750
[FRANMALTH groaning]

356
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,625
No way.

357
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:20,625
I don't believe what
I'm seeing. What is this?

358
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:23,208
Why does he have his soul?

359
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:15,041
[LUCY] After unleashing
his hidden power,

360
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:19,208
Franmalth attacks Natsu, Happy,
and me in an atrocious form.

361
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,291
Meanwhile, Gray,
Erza, and Mirajane

362
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:25,416
continue their intense battles
with the demons of Tartaros.

363
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,958
Elsewhere, Wendy and
Carla race against time

364
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:30,708
to stop the Face from
destroying Fiore.

365
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:33,625
But the shadow of the enemy
isn't far behind them.

366
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:37,958
Next time: "Tartaros Chapter
Wendy vs. Ezel."

367
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:41,458
The fate of the continent rests
in the hands of one girl.
