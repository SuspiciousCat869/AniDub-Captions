1
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,250
- Lucy: PREVIOUSLY,
ON FAIRY TAIL.

2
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,708
- Happy: CARLA
AND I BLASTED OUR WAY

3
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:22,583
INTO EDOLAS WITH NATSU AND WENDY

4
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,541
AND STARTED LOOKING FOR
OUR MISSING FRIENDS.

5
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,333
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE I'M
ORIGINALLY FROM

6
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:27,625
THIS WACKY PLACE.

7
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:28,875
- Natsu: YOU GOTTA
BE KIDDIN' ME.

8
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,666
WE CAN'T USE MAGIC AT ALL?

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,833
- Wendy: HEY, IS IT JUST ME

10
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,791
OR IS EVERYONE ACTING
REALLY STRANGE?

11
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,166
- Carla: EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS
PLACE IS STRANGE.

12
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:39,666
- ( theme song playing )

13
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:57,166
- ( singing in Japanese )

14
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,416
- Lucy: HEY, WHAT THE HECK
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

15
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,833
WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA WITH YOU
SNEAKIN' AROUND OUR GUILD?

16
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:21,625
- I DON'T KNOW. WHY ARE YOU
ALL ACTING SO FREAKY?

17
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,125
- YOU THINK THIS PLACE HAS
WARPED THEIR MINDS SOMEHOW?

18
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,958
- NATSU.

19
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,166
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST SAY IT
WAS YOU, YA BIG BONE HEAD?

20
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,875
- WAIT, THAT'S NATSU?

21
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,833
- THAT'S QUITE A
FASHION STATEMENT, BRO.

22
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:44,750
- NATSU, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? I
WAS THINKING THE WORST HAPPENED.

23
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,166
DON'T EVER MAKE ME WORRY
LIKE THAT AGAIN.

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,541
- Happy: Fairy Hunter!

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,666
- UM, I'M SORRY?

26
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,708
- NO, BUT YOU'RE GONNA BE.

27
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:01,958
- SHE BROKE OUT THE
GOOD STUFF.

28
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,958
- NO ONE CAN ESCAPE
LUCY'S GRIND CRUSH.

29
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,125
IT'S ONE OF HER "FORTY EIGHT
TORTURE TECHNIQUES".

30
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,416
- HUH!

31
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,166
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

32
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,291
- LUCY, DON'T BE SO HARD
ON THE POOR THING.

33
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,666
YOU KNOW HOW HE CAN BE.

34
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,291
- WHOA! WHY ISN'T CANA
HALF-NAKED AND FULLY DRUNK?

35
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,958
- ( crying )
- AND WHY IS ELFMAN CRYING

36
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,166
INSTEAD OF PREACHING ABOUT
THE GLORY OF MANHOOD?

37
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,416
- Both: FOR CRYIN' OUT LOUD,
WOULD YOU STOP CRYIN' OUT LOUD?

38
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,416
- I'M SORRY, I CAN'T HELP IT.

39
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,791
- WHY IS EVERYBODY ACTING
SO CRAZY?

40
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,625
MY POOR LITTLE BRAIN FEELS LIKE
IT'S ABOUT TO EXPLODE.

41
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,750
- WE'RE GLAD YOU MADE IT
BACK IN ONE PIECE.

42
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,958
RIGHT, MY SWEET JUVIA?

43
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,666
- SURE, WHATEVER.

44
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,250
- WENDY'S RIGHT. I THINK THIS
PLACE HAS CHANGED THEM SOMEHOW.

45
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:41,208
THAT'S THE ONLY EXPLANATION FOR
WHY THEY'RE BEING SO WEIRD.

46
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,500
- HMM.

47
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,750
- HEY, NATSU.
GLAD YOU MADE IT BACK SAFELY.

48
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,458
- AT LEAST MIRA'S NORMAL.

49
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,166
- YEAH, THAT'S KIND OF
A DISAPPOINTMENT.

50
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,916
- BY THE WAY, NATSU,

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,041
WHAT'S WITH THE KID AND THE
CATS, YOU A BABYSITTER NOW?

52
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,083
- SERIOUSLY.

53
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:01,375
- Both: WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ARE THESE CATS DOING HERE?

54
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,625
- All: CATS?

55
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,083
- HOW'D THEY GET INSIDE?

56
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,333
- THOSE AREN'T REGULAR HOUSE
CATS, THOSE ARE EXCEEDS.

57
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:07,833
- NO WAY.

58
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,416
- SHOULDN'T WE DO SOMETHING?

59
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,625
- UM, IT'S THE OUTFITS,
ISN'T IT?

60
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,666
- NATSU, WHAT THE HECK IS
GOIN' ON HERE?

61
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,666
- HAS ANYONE ELSE NOTICED
THAT EVERY PERSON

62
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,125
WE'VE MET SO FAR FREAKS

63
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,500
WHENEVER THEY HEAR EXCEED?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, ANYWAY?

64
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,791
- WELL, CARLA?

65
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,041
- ( sighing )

66
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:30,666
- PHEW! IT'S WAY TOO HOT
FOR THIS GETUP.

67
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,166
- THEY SURE DO LOOK A
LOT LIKE THEM.

68
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,625
NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY
EVERYBODY'S SO ON EDGE.

69
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,791
- Macao and Wakaba: CAREFUL,
DON'T GET TOO CLOSE TO IT,

70
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:38,666
IT MAY BITE YOU.

71
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,333
- I DON'T TRUST THEM
ONE BIT.

72
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,250
- YOU KNOW,
I THINK BIG SIS IS RIGHT.

73
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,958
DON'T WORRY, THE LITTLE GUYS
JUST LOOK LIKE EXCEEDS.

74
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,375
- WHATEVER YOU SAY.

75
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,333
- I'VE GOT A BAD FEELING.

76
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,625
- THAT MAKES TWO OF US,
I MEAN, A SPADE'S A SPADE.

77
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,500
- UM, SPADE?

78
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,750
- CALM DOWN. AND PUT YOUR
HELMET BACK ON.

79
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,416
- BUT IT'S SO STUFFY WHEN
IT'S ON, I CAN'T BREATHE.

80
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,375
- QUIT COMPLAINING AND
JUST PUT UP WITH IT.

81
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,083
- LUCY'S REALLY SCARY.

82
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,500
- SPILL IT, CAT WRANGLER,

83
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,041
I WANNA KNOW WHERE YOU
WERE, WHAT YOU WERE DOING,

84
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,750
AND YOU BETTER HOPE
I LIKE YOUR ANSWERS.

85
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,000
- I DON'T SUPPOSE I CAN GET
BACK TO YOU ON THAT ONE.

86
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,041
- WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO WASTE,
SO TELL HER EVERYTHING

87
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,125
THAT'S HAPPENED SO FAR.

88
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,416
- FINE. I GUESS THAT'S
SIMPLE ENOUGH.

89
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,083
THEN AGAIN, I WAS ASLEEP
FOR MOST OF IT.

90
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:28,583
- HUH? GEEZ, COULD YOU BE
ANY MORE ANNOYING?

91
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,458
- SPIT IT OUT ALREADY, WOULD YA.
- ( Natsu grunting )

92
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,791
- BREAK HIS ARM.

93
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,958
- NOBODY CAN TAKE LUCY'S
ELBOW GRIND CRUSH.

94
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,208
- THEY'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT
NAMING THINGS, HUH?

95
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,833
- MIND IF I BEND YOUR EAR?

96
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,041
- ONLY IF YOU PROMISE
TO BE ROUGH WITH IT.

97
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,750
- THE THOUGHT OF GOING ON
A JOB BY OURSELVES

98
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:42,791
GETS YOU EXCITED, BISCUIT?

99
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,333
- OH, YOU BET IT DOES.

100
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,875
WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND,
MY SUGAR PISTOL?

101
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,125
- WHATEVER JOB YOU WANT TO
GO ON IS ALL RIGHT WITH ME,

102
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,750
MY BOUNCY BIKINI BLOSSOM.

103
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,250
- OH, LOVE RIFLE,
YOU'RE SO SWEET.

104
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,791
LET'S FIND A JOB ON A
ROMANTIC ISLAND GET-AWAY.

105
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,875
- YOU KNOW, I KINDA FEEL
LIKE I SHOULDN'T BE

106
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,375
WATCHING ANY OF THIS.

107
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,375
- I'M GLAD THEY FINALLY ADMITTED
THEIR LOVE FOR EACH OTHER,

108
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,333
BUT THERE'S SUCH A THING
AS RESTRAINT.

109
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:04,625
- SO, JUVIA, YOU SAID YOU WERE
PLANNING ON DOING A JOB SOON.

110
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,750
IF YOU WANT SOME COMPANY,
I'D LOVE TO COME WITH YOU.

111
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,208
- WHY WOULD I WANT HELP
FROM A WALKING COAT RACK?

112
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,666
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.

113
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,833
I CAN HANDLE ANY JOB ON MY OWN.
I DON'T NEED A PARTNER.

114
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,916
FIND SOMEONE ELSE TO FULFILL
YOUR FANTASIES WITH

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,250
AND QUIT WASTING MY TIME.

116
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,333
- YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES THE
BEST COURSE OF ACTION

117
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:21,541
IS TO GIVE IT A REST.

118
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,291
- NO KIDDIN'. WHEN IT
COMES TO THE LADIES,

119
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,083
YOU'RE MORE OF A LOST
CAUSE THAN LYON.

120
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,583
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD
COMPARE ME

121
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,291
TO THAT OVER-CLOTHED
PICK-UP ARTIST.

122
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,625
PRETTY PLEASE, MY DARLING.
I'LL BE A GOOD BOY.

123
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,458
- WOULD YOU BACK OFF?

124
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,375
- ( exclaiming ) HELP ME.

125
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:38,833
- ( screaming )
ITS A RUNAWAY GRAY BALL.

126
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,458
REEDUS?

127
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:46,125
- JEEZ. WHY DON'T YOU WATCH
WHERE YOU'RE GOING, HALF-PINT.

128
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,958
WHAT ARE YOU ANYWAY? A WANNABE
EXCEED OR SOMETHING?

129
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,750
- ARE YOU PICKING A FIGHT?

130
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:54,083
I DON'T KNOW WHAT AN EXCEED IS,
BUT I AIN'T NO WANNABE!

131
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,541
- THE ROOM'S STILL SPINNING.

132
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,583
- GRAY. WOULD YOU QUIT
PLAYING AROUND, ALREADY? GET UP!

133
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,291
- LYING ON THE FLOOR IS
ACTUALLY WAY MORE WARM AND COZY

134
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,000
THAN YOU MIGHT THINK,
SO I'M OKAY.

135
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,083
- ARE YOU SERIOUSLY
THIS PATHETIC?

136
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,791
- HOW DO YOU LIKE TECHNIQUE
NUMBER THIRTY-FIVE,

137
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,416
THE "MAN, THAT'S CRUEL" HOLD.

138
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,625
- IF THAT DOESN'T WORK,
THE "PLEASE STOP" LOCK

139
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,791
WILL SUIT YOU JUST FINE.

140
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,375
- I WISH LUCY WOULD GO
BACK TO NORMAL.

141
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,083
- AW, THAT'S SO CUTE,
HE'S RUNNING,

142
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,875
BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE FOREVER.

143
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,958
- OF COURSE THE CONDUCTING WIRE
SHORTED OUT. JUST MY LUCK.

144
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,041
- TIME TO ROCK THE NEXT JOB.

145
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,291
- ( grunting ) DARN IT, NAB,
WOULD YOU PUT A SOCK IN IT?

146
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,666
- WHAT'D YOU SAY TO ME?

147
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,000
YOU NEED A MAJOR TUNE-UP
ON YOUR ATTITUDE, LEVY.

148
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,791
- I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR YOUR
LAME JOKES.

149
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,791
DID YOU FORGET HOW
VITAL THIS MACHINE IS?

150
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,333
I CAN'T GET IT WORKING
WITH YOU SCREAMING

151
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,916
LIKE A KID EVERY FOUR SECONDS.

152
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,375
- COME OUT AND PLAY, NATSU.

153
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,708
I GOT A NEW TECHNIQUE I
WANNA TRY ON YA.

154
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,208
- THAT GOES DOUBLE FOR YOU,
BLONDIE, SHUT YOUR TRAP.

155
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,583
- WHAT WAS THAT?

156
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,375
- IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO FINISH
THIS JOB WITHOUT YOU

157
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,583
ACTING LIKE A CRAZED GORILLA,
YA BRAWNY BEAST!

158
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,000
- THAT'S FUNNY, COMING FROM
A SCRAWNY LITTLE GREASE MONKEY

159
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,625
WHO CAN'T FIX ONE PIECE OF JUNK.

160
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,916
- COME ON, YOU TWO, WE'RE ALL IN
THIS TOGETHER, AREN'T WE?

161
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,541
- NOT ONLY THAT, BUT WE
REALLY COUNT ON LEVY.

162
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:03,333
WHO KNOWS HOW MANY TIMES
SHE'S GOTTEN US OUT OF A JAM.

163
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:07,291
- WHAT? QUIT WASTIN' TIME
AND GET THAT THING WORKIN'.

164
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,500
- WELL, IT IS
WHAT I DO BEST.

165
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,583
- I RECOGNIZE MOST
OF THE PEOPLE HERE,

166
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,500
BUT I DON'T THINK
I'VE SEEN ERZA YET.

167
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,791
- THAT MIGHT NOT BE
A BAD THING.

168
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,958
- NO KIDDING. DO YOU THINK
SHE'D BE THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE

169
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,500
OF HERSELF LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

170
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,791
- THE WAY OUR LUCK'S BEEN,

171
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,083
SHE'LL BE EVEN MORE
PSYCHO THAN LUCY.

172
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,583
- I HOPE NOT.

173
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,250
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT
ERZA'S 'OPPOSITE' WOULD BE LIKE.

174
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,291
- WELL, MAYBE IT'S
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

175
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,333
ARE YOU A COMPLETE AND
UTTER MORON?

176
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:35,291
HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO CLEAN UP YOUR MESSES, HUH?

177
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,541
- I'M SO SORRY.
FORGIVE ME, NATSU.

178
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,250
I WON'T BE A BURDEN
TO YOU ANYMORE,

179
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,000
JUST GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE.

180
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,958
- APOLOGY ACCEPTED. KEEP TRYIN',
AND YOU'LL BE AS STRONG AS ME.

181
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,083
- MY GREATEST WISH. MASTER.

182
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,541
- LIKE THAT.

183
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,083
- THERE'S NO WAY BIZARRO
ERZA WOULD BE THAT PATHETIC.

184
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,583
- ALL RIGHT THEN. SINCE YOU'RE
SUCH A SMARTY CAT,

185
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,875
WHAT DO YOU THINK
SHE'LL BE LIKE?

186
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,500
- OH, I DON'T JUST THINK,
FRIEND. I KNOW.

187
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,916
- LORD HAPPY, ALLOW ME TO
TAKE CARE OF THIS NUISANCE.

188
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
- AYE. I SHALL LEAVE IT TO YOU.

189
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,333
- THANK YOU, LORD.
I'LL USE EVERY TOOL

190
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,375
IN MY ARSENAL TO
SERVE YOUR WILL.

191
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,250
- YES, YES, THAT'S
QUITE REASSURING.

192
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,833
HOP TO IT MY FAITHFUL SERVANT.

193
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:14,958
CHOP CHOP!

194
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,041
- AYE, SIR.
- AWESOME!

195
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,291
- THAT'S CRAZY.

196
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,416
AND YOU HAD THE NERVE TO
MAKE FUN OF MY FANTASY?

197
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,208
- HMM. I THINK I KNOW
WHAT SHE'D BE LIKE.

198
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:27,041
- I BAKED THEM JUST FOR YOU,
SO DON'T LET THEM GO TO WASTE.

199
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,250
EAT AS MUCH AS YOUR LITTLE
HEART DESIRES.

200
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:33,125
( chuckles ) THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THEY LOOK DELICIOUS.

201
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,083
- ( giggles ) JUST REMEMBER
TO FLOSS AFTERWARDS.

202
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,208
- LIKE THAT.

203
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,416
- Both: YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING!

204
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,541
- THESE FANTASIES OF YOURS
ARE A WASTE OF BRAIN POWER,

205
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,125
NOT TO MENTION EMBARRASSING.

206
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,541
- ( chuckles ) STILL, I
CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER

207
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,125
HOW DIFFERENT SHE'LL BE.

208
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,333
- Happy: YEAH, I KNOW.
IT'S KIND OF EXCITING.

209
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,208
- HIDE AND SEEK IS OVER.

210
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,541
- MAN, YOU'RE OBSESSIVE.

211
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,708
- THIS NEW MOVE'S GONNA ROCK
YOUR SOCKS OFF.

212
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,291
- QUIT IT. I DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR THIS

213
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,333
FREAKY PAIN THING
WHENEVER YOU...

214
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,875
- THAT SO?
SO YA WANNA PLAY TOUGH?

215
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,625
I LOVE THAT GAME.

216
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,958
- ( both grunting )

217
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,916
- WOW. THAT MUST'VE HURT.

218
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,416
- YOU FEELING OKAY THERE, BUDDY?

219
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,458
- YEAH, I'M FINE,
NEVER BETTER.

220
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,916
- REMEMBER THIS THE NEXT
TIME YOU DECIDE TO PLAY.

221
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,666
- I CAN'T BELIEVE NATSU
HAD THE NERVE

222
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,291
TO TALK BACK TO
LUCY LIKE THAT.

223
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,750
- SOMETIMES LIFE THROWS THE
UNEXPECTED AT YOU.

224
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,958
- THE UNEXPECTED LOOKS PAINFUL.

225
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,458
- ALL RIGHT, MR. DEATH WISH.

226
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:36,333
YOU GONNA TELL ME WHERE YOU'VE
BEEN LATELY. SPIT IT OUT.

227
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:41,666
- WELL, GIVE ME A MINUTE.
HEY, HAPPY, A LITTLE HELP HERE.

228
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,833
- I'D LOVE TO, BUT THIS
MASK IS SO HEAVY,

229
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,291
I CAN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING.

230
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,458
- HOW COULD YOU ABANDON ME?

231
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:51,458
- LUCY, ARE YOU HARASSING NATSU
AGAIN? YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER.

232
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,875
- ( gasping )

233
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,958
- FINE. WHATEVER.

234
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,625
- AM I DREAMING?

235
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,791
- HEY. WELCOME HOME.

236
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,958
- GLAD YOU MADE IT BACK.
I WAS WORRIED.

237
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,500
- GOOD TO SEE YA, SIS. YOU TOO,
BRO. SORRY FOR THE WAIT.

238
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,958
- IT'S REALLY YOU.

239
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,041
- SHE'S ALIVE.

240
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,208
- LISANNA.

241
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,541
- HOW MANY TIMES HAVE
I TOLD YOU JERKS

242
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,666
NOT TO BULLY MY BROTHER
WHEN I'M NOT AROUND?

243
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,250
- YEAH, WE KNOW.

244
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,875
- ( thunder rumbling )

245
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,333
- YOU'RE GONNA CATCH A COLD,
YOU KNOW?

246
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,583
- OH, HEY, UM, WHAT
WAS YOUR NAME AGAIN?

247
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,875
- I'M LISANNA, SILLY.

248
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,375
- THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE MIRA'S LITTLE SISTER.

249
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:59,916
- YOU GOT IT. SO, WHY ARE YOU
OUT HERE? IT'S COZY INSIDE.

250
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:01,916
- MMM.

251
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,125
- IT'S OKAY, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO ANSWER THAT ONE.

252
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,916
SO, NATSU, IS IT TRUE YOU WERE
RAISED BY A DRAGON?

253
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,625
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

254
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,250
- HIS NAME'S IGNEEL.

255
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:13,375
- I'D LOVE TO SEE ONE FOR
MYSELF SOMEDAY. IT SOUNDS FUN.

256
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:17,375
- SURE IS. IGNEEL'S AWESOME.
I THINK YOU'D REALLY LIKE HIM.

257
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,416
HE'S SUPER STRONG
AND BIG AS A HOUSE.

258
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,458
HE TAUGHT ME ALL THE DRAGON
SLAYER MAGIC I KNOW. WANNA SEE?

259
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,333
- YOU BET. BUT LET'S GET OUT
OF THE RAIN FIRST.

260
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,750
- OKAY.

261
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,625
- IT'S BEEN FUN
PLAYING HOUSE WITH YOU.

262
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,708
MAYBE SOMEDAY I COULD
BE YOUR REAL WIFE?

263
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,166
IT'S SO PRETTY.

264
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,125
IT'D BE NICE IF WE COULD
STAY LIKE THIS FOREVER,

265
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,458
DON'T YOU THINK?

266
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,375
WELCOME BACK, DEAR.

267
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,583
- OH, UH, WHAT?

268
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,916
- I SAID WELCOME BACK, DEAR.

269
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,875
- OH. HI HONEY, I'M HOME.

270
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,583
HEY, LISANNA.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

271
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,541
- JUST LEAVING SOME FLOWERS FOR
BIG BROTHER ELFMAN'S PARAKEET.

272
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,291
- DID YOUR BROTHER MAKE THAT
GRAVESTONE ALL BY HIMSELF?

273
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,333
- HE LOVED HIS
PARAKEET SO MUCH.

274
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,541
- HE'S BETTER AT CRAFTING
THAN MAGIC.

275
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,041
- HEY, NATSU, IF ANYTHING
HAPPENS TO ME,

276
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,500
WILL YOU MAKE MY GRAVESTONE?

277
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,833
- HUH? WHAT ARE YOU
EVEN TALKING ABOUT?

278
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,958
- ARE YOU GONNA GO
WHERE THE PARAKEET WENT?

279
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:27,708
- CUT IT OUT. IT'S BAD LUCK TO
TALK LIKE THAT, AND CREEPY!

280
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,541
- YOU KNOW, SOMEDAY EVERYONE
NEEDS A GRAVESTONE OF THEIR OWN.

281
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,375
- ( crying )

282
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,041
- I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S GONE.

283
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,875
- THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT
TO BRING BACK.

284
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,708
- I JUST WISH SHE COULD
HAVE HAD A PROPER BURIAL.

285
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,500
- Happy: HEY, NATSU, WHY DID YOU
MAKE A GRAVE FOR HER

286
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,083
WAY OUT HERE WHEN
THERE'S ALREADY ONE

287
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,791
AT THE CHURCH CEMETERY?

288
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,291
- THIS WAS ONE OF HER
FAVORITE PLACES.

289
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,833
SHE LOVED TO SIT AND
WATCH THE SUNSET.

290
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:05,333
AS LONG AS THIS IS HERE,
SHE'LL NEVER MISS A SINGLE ONE.

291
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:06,458
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

292
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,625
- I JUST WISH I COULD
KEEP MY PROMISE.

293
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,166
- HUH?

294
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,500
- I DON'T THINK I'LL BE
ABLE TO FIND HER THIS TIME.

295
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,000
- AYE.

296
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,250
- Lisanna: NATSU.

297
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,250
I'LL BE HOME REAL SOON.

298
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,750
HEY, IF I EVER WENT
MISSING LIKE THAT AGAIN,

299
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,291
YOU'D GO LOOKING FOR ME,
WOULDN'T YOU?

300
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,750
YOU WOULDN'T JUST
LET ME STAY GONE, RIGHT?

301
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,000
- I FOUND YOU.

302
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,375
- Both: LISANNA!

303
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,666
- NOT HAPPENING. YOU GOT
THREE SECONDS TO TELL ME

304
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,208
WHAT'S GOIN' ON THEN I START
BREAKIN' BONES. YOU HEAR ME?

305
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:03,583
- SHE'S THERE, LISANNA'S
RIGHT THERE. ALIVE!

306
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,125
- OF COURSE SHE IS.

307
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,125
- ( Natsu crying )

308
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,916
- JUST CRY IT OUT.

309
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,958
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE STRONG
FOR ME. WE'RE OLD BUDDIES.

310
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,416
- THE GRAY I KNOW WOULD BE
HALF NAKED BY NOW.

311
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,083
- WELL YOU TWO SURE MAKE A
CUTE COUPLE, DON'T YOU?

312
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,875
THAT'S SO ADORABLE
I MIGHT HURL.

313
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,500
- REAL FRIENDS TALK
TO EACH OTHER,

314
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:21,875
NOT FIGHT LIKE YOU AND LEVY.

315
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,625
- WAIT. HOW'S LISANNA HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

316
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,166
- MIRA AND ELFMAN'S SISTER?

317
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,833
BUT I THOUGHT SHE'D BEEN KILLED
ON A DANGEROUS JOB.

318
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,958
- WE THOUGHT THIS WORLD WAS
THE OPPOSITE OF OUR OWN

319
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,333
BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

320
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:38,125
IF IT WERE, SURELY MIRAJANE
WOULD BE BEHAVING DIFFERENTLY.

321
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,208
BUT THE BIGGEST PROOF IS
RIGHT THERE.

322
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,000
- HEY, WENDY, THAT SHRIMP
THERE KINDA LOOKS LIKE YOU.

323
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,000
A LITTLE YOU.

324
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,375
- YEAH, YOU THINK SO?

325
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,416
- NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,
THEY DO LOOK SIMILAR.

326
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,041
- ARE YOU SAYING THAT'S ME?

327
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:58,625
- THIS IS BAD. WE SHOULD LEAVE
HERE. AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

328
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,041
- WHY? WHAT'S GOING ON?

329
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:05,041
- THESE PEOPLE, THEY'RE NOT
OUR MISSING FRIENDS.

330
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:08,791
THIS ISN'T THE FAIRY TAIL
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.

331
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:12,250
THEY'RE NOT OPPOSITES. THEY'RE
DIFFERENT PEOPLE ENTIRELY.

332
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,583
THEY'VE BEEN EDOLAS CITIZENS
FROM THE BEGINNING.

333
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,041
IT'S NOT AS CRAZY AS IT SOUNDS.

334
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:25,166
THINK OF IT AS SORT OF
A PARALLEL WORLD.

335
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,083
EDOLAS HAS ITS OWN
SEPARATE HISTORY AND CULTURE.

336
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:31,166
SO IT'S POSSIBLE FOR COMPLETELY
SEPARATE FAIRY TAIL TO EXIST.

337
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,375
- Wendy: NO WAY.

338
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,625
- Happy: MY HEAD HURTS.

339
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,625
I CAN'T HANDLE ALL THIS
COMPLICATED CRAZY TALK.

340
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,166
- OKAY. IF THESE PEOPLE
AREN'T OUR FRIENDS,

341
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,541
WHERE ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO FIND 'EM?

342
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,750
- WHAT ARE YOU BABBLING
ABOUT OVER HERE?

343
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,333
- YOU EXPECT ME TO KNOW THAT?
IF I DID, WE WOULDN'T EVEN BE

344
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:48,416
ON THIS WILD GOOSE CHASE.

345
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,625
WE SHOULDN'T REMAIN IN THIS
PLACE A MINUTE MORE.

346
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:51,625
COME ALONG NOW.

347
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,000
- CARLA. WHERE'LL WE GO?

348
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,541
- Carla: THE ROYAL CITY.

349
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,750
IF THERE ARE ANY CLUES AS TO
THE WHEREABOUTS OF OUR FRIENDS,

350
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,250
WE'RE SURE TO FIND THEM THERE.

351
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,625
- WE'VE GOT BIG TROUBLE.
THE FAIRY HUNTER IS HERE.

352
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,416
- WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING? YOU WANNA DIE?

353
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,458
DON'T YOU DARE WALK OUT.

354
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,833
- IMPOSSIBLE.

355
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,666
- HOW COULD SHE HAVE
TRACKED US DOWN SO QUICKLY?

356
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,208
- THOSE MONSTERS
FROM THE KINGDOM,

357
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,583
WILL THEY NEVER STOP HUNTING US?

358
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,333
- Both: I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL
GET OUT OF THIS ONE.

359
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,583
- THE KINGDOM?

360
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,041
- THEY'RE THE ONES
WHO CREATED ANIMA

361
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,708
AND SENT THE TWO OF US TO
EARTH LAND ON OUR MISSION.

362
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:35,625
- SO THAT MEANS YOU AND I
ARE ENEMIES OF FAIRY TAIL.

363
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:39,458
- PREPARING REACTOR FOR
IGNITION. ENTERING COORDINATES.

364
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:44,291
AUTOMATED ERROR CORRECTION IN
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE...

365
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:48,000
MARKER CONNECTED. ROUTING MAGIC
POWER TO SHOCK ABSORBERS.

366
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,708
- SHUT UP AND CAST THE
TELEPORTATION CIRCLE ALREADY.

367
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,416
- DO YOU WANNA GO OUT THERE
AND BUY US SOME TIME?

368
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,916
- OH, YOU'RE SO FUNNY. JUST CAST
IT BEFORE SHE GETS HERE.

369
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,708
- I'M TRYING. DON'T RUSH ME.

370
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,833
- THIS IS NO TIME FOR
A CAT FIGHT, LADIES.

371
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:05,166
- IS THE FAIRY HUNTER
A MONSTER?

372
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,166
- Levy: MAGIC POWER OUTPUT
AT FORTY PERCENT

373
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,541
FOR TELEPORT CRITICALITY.

374
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:12,041
FORTY THREE, FORTY SIX,
FIFTY ONE.

375
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,291
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

376
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,208
- I DON'T WANT TO DIE TODAY.

377
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,208
- QUIT FREAKING OUT,
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

378
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,500
- GO FASTER.

379
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,375
- CAN'T YOU SPEED IT UP
OR SOMETHING?

380
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,875
- YOU WANNA WALK INSTEAD?

381
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:27,375
OUTPUT AT SIXTY ONE, SIXTY
THREE, TWO MINUTES TO TELEPORT.

382
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,500
- WHAT'S WITH THE AIR?
IT'S VIBRATING.

383
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,125
- SHE'S HERE!

384
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,250
- WHOA, WHAT IS THAT?

385
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,625
- THE FAIRY HUNTER!

386
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,583
- WHAT A MONSTER!

387
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:43,041
- WHY WOULD THE KINGDOM SEND
THAT AFTER FAIRY TAIL?

388
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,708
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

389
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,791
- ARE YOU THAT OUT
OF THE LOOP?

390
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,291
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

391
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,125
- THE KING ORDERED ALL GUILDS
DESTROYED TO PROTECT

392
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,833
THE LIMITED MAGIC SUPPLY.

393
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,083
OUT OF ALL OF THEM,
ONLY ONE IS STILL STANDING

394
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,916
AND IT'S THIS ONE.

395
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:02,250
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU THINK YOU ARE.

396
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:05,208
BUT THIS IS FAIRY TAIL AND
WE'RE A DARK GUILD.

397
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,291
- ALL RIGHT, WE FINALLY
REACHED CRITICALITY.

398
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:14,750
NOW, ACTIVATE SHOCK ABSORBERS.
TELEPORTATION CIRCLE DEPLOYING.

399
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,875
- WHY IS EVERYTHING
FLOATING AWAY?

400
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,208
- WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?

401
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,875
- THIS IS CRAZY.

402
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,958
- EVERYONE GRAB ON TO
SOMETHING, QUICKLY.

403
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,125
- HOLD ONTO ME,
MY BLUE-HAIRED DARLING.

404
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,250
- KEEP THAT UP AND
I'LL LEAVE YOU BEHIND.

405
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,583
- COMMENCE TELEPORT.

406
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,458
- OH MY! I HOPE WE'LL
MAKE IT OUT SAFELY.

407
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,166
- I'LL KEEP YOU SAFE,
MISS CANA.

408
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,750
- NO, THAT'S MY JOB.

409
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,750
- BIG SIS. LISANNA. HOLD ON
TO ME AS TIGHT AS YOU CAN.

410
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,666
- WAIT A SEC,
THIS IS A VEHICLE?

411
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,166
- ( explosion )

412
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,000
- FILTHY COWARDS.

413
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,875
- HMM. TELEPORTATION MAGIC?

414
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,041
TO THINK THEY'D STOOP
TO EMPLOY A SPELL

415
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,625
THAT USES SUCH AN ENORMOUS
AMOUNT OF POWER IN ONE SHOT.

416
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:16,041
MY, OH MY, DARK GUILDS
SURE ARE WASTEFUL.

417
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,375
- I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE
HERE, SUGARBOY.

418
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,500
- MMM. THIS IS TRULY CONCERNING.

419
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:24,041
THOSE FAIRIES ARE QUITE
A RESOURCEFUL BUNCH.

420
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:27,541
- YOU SHOULDN'T PRAISE INSECTS,
YOU SHOULD SQUASH THEM, QUICKLY.

421
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:31,333
- MMM. YET THEY'VE MANAGED TO
ESCAPE HOW MANY TIMES NOW?

422
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,958
THESE INSECTS ARE RESILIENT

423
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,250
BUT THEY CAN'T KEEP
THE ACT UP MUCH LONGER.

424
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,083
THEIR DEMISE IS AS
CERTAIN AS THE SUNSET.

425
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,875
DID YOU HEAR THE GIANT
ANIMA PLAN WAS A SUCCESS?

426
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,625
ALMOST HARD TO BELIEVE.

427
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,500
ANYWAY, ALL CAPTAINS OF THE
MAGIC WARFARE UNITS

428
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,625
ARE TO RETURN TO THE ROYAL CITY.

429
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,708
- SO EARTH LAND'S FAIRY TAIL
HAS BEEN DESTROYED?

430
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,250
- MORE PRECISELY,
IT HAS BEEN ABSORBED.

431
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:55,666
YOU HAVE TO HAND IT TO THE
KING, HE CERTAINLY HAS STYLE.

432
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,250
- AND WHAT OF THE
EARTH LAND WIZARDS

433
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,291
WHO WERE ALSO
ABSORBED BY THE ANIMA?

434
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:03,500
- THEY'RE ENJOYING THEIR STAY
AS PART OF A GIANT LACRIMA.

435
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,458
- SPLENDID. THEN
EDOLAS' MAGIC SUPPLY

436
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,333
SHOULD BE FILLED TO CAPACITY
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

437
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,291
- MMM-HMM.

438
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:20,583
- ( explosion )

439
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,791
- Lucy: THAT WAS CLOSE,
BUT WE MADE IT.

440
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,291
- Macao: THANK GOODNESS.

441
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,125
- Wakaba: I DON'T THINK I'LL
EVER GET USED TO THAT THING.

442
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,666
- Max: IS ANYBODY HURT?

443
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,041
- Warren: JUST MY PRIDE. - Droy:
I'LL FEEL THAT FOR A WEEK.

444
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,541
- OKAY, I'M LOST.

445
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,916
- I THINK THE GUILD
CHANGED LOCATION.

446
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,625
- SO DID MY STOMACH.

447
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:38,958
- SEE, MY LOVELY JUVIA,

448
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,041
WEARING LOTS OF CLOTHES
CAN COME IN HANDY.

449
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,083
- YEAH. THANKS, I GUESS.

450
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,916
- NEVER A DULL MOMENT
IN THIS PLACE.

451
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,125
- Macao and Wakaba: YOU WEREN'T
HURT, WERE YOU, MISS CANA?

452
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,625
- OH, NO, I'M QUITE ALRIGHT.

453
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,833
- LISANNA.
NOTHING'S BROKEN, IS IT?

454
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,208
- NO, BIG BROTHER.
I'M STILL IN ONE PIECE.

455
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,375
- YOU TOOK YOUR SWEET TIME
FIRING THAT THING UP.

456
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,833
SHE WAS ALMOST ON TOP OF US.

457
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,458
- SHUT UP. AND WHAT EXACTLY
DID YOU DO TO HELP US?

458
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:01,625
- CAN'T YOU AT LEAST
DO SOMETHING

459
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,083
ABOUT ALL THE ANNOYING SHAKING?

460
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,541
- IT WOULDN'T DO IT SO MUCH
IF YOU WEREN'T SUCH A COW.

461
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:05,958
- YOU'RE JEALOUS OF MY BODY.

462
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,333
- YEAH, RIGHT,
GIMME A BREAK.

463
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,333
- WHO WAS AT THE REIGNS OF
THAT MONSTER EARLIER?

464
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,083
- HAVE YOU SERIOUSLY FORGOTTEN?

465
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,958
YOU MUST'VE HIT YOUR HEAD
WHEN WE LANDED.

466
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,583
- HE'S JUST AN IDIOT.

467
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,875
- Mirajane: THAT WAS ONE OF THE
CAPTAINS OF THE ROYAL CITY'S

468
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:19,500
MAGIC WARFARE UNITS.

469
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:23,125
ERZA KNIGHTWALKER.

470
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:26,666
SHE'S ALSO KNOWN
AS THE FAIRY HUNTER.

471
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,000
- IT CAN'T BE.

472
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:35,375
OUR ENEMY IS ERZA?

473
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,541

475
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,541

VERSION OF LUCY

476
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:15,750
IS ONE TWISTED SISTER.

477
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:17,500
- Natsu: YEAH, BUT OUR
LUCY IS PRETTY SCARY

478
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,000
WHEN SHE WANTS TO BE.

479
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,291
- Happy: HMM. GOOD POINT.
ACTUALLY, WHEN YOU REALLY THINK

480
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,041
ABOUT IT, THERE'S
ALMOST NO DIFFERENCE

481
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,000
BETWEEN THE TWO OF 'EM.

482
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:24,208
I BET IF THEY DRESSED ALIKE

483
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:25,416
WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO
TELL 'EM APART.

484
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
- Natsu: GREAT!
I'M ALREADY CONFUSED.

485
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:28,875
WHICH OF THESE ANGRY
VIOLENT BLONDE CHICKS

486
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:31,333
IS THE ONE WE USUALLY
HANG OUT WITH?

487
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:33,708
- Both: NEXT TIME, KEY OF HOPE!

488
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:35,750
- Happy: IT'LL BE EASY IF
WE CALL ONE OF THEM LUCY

489
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,208
A AND THE OTHER LUCY B.

490
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:39,333
- Natsu: AWESOME! WHICH ONE IS
A AND WHICH ONE IS B?
