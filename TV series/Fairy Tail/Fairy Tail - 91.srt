00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:20,625
- LILY, LONG AGO,
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

2
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:23,916
I'M GLAD THAT I COULD RETURN
THE FAVOR TODAY.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,041

MY PRINCE.

- ( gasping )

32
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,625
- YOU PATHETIC TRAITOR.
YOU'RE NOT A NOBLE EXCEED.

33
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,875
YOU'RE JUST A LOUSY FALLEN.

34
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,166
TO THINK YOU WOULD FORGET
YOUR DEBT TO OUR KING

35
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,791
AND DARE BETRAY HIS ORDERS.
- IT'S THE EDOLAS ERZA.

36
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:43,958
THE ONE CALLED "KNIGHTWALKER."
- LILY!

37
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,625
- HEARTLESS BROAD,
YOU'RE GONNA PAY.

38
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,291
- NO, WE HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING TO HELP LILY.

39
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,416
- IT'S TOO DANGEROUS, CHAGOT.
- DON'T WORRY, YOUR HIGHNESS.

40
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,500
I'LL GO DOWN THERE
AND TAKE CARE OF HIM FOR YOU.

41
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,375
- SCARLET.

42
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,291
IT'S KNIGHTWALKER.
- Mystogan: LET ME HANDLE THIS.

43
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:13,125
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOUR
INSOLENCE, CAPTAIN KNIGHTWALKER.

44
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,791
HOW DARE YOU POINT YOUR SWORD
AT ME,

45
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,291
THE ROYAL PRINCE OF EDOLAS.
- THE PRINCE?

46
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,541
- ( laughing )

47
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,666
YOU, THE ROYAL PRINCE
OF EDOLAS?

48
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,083
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.
YOU DON'T DESERVE THE TITLE

49
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,708
BECAUSE I NEVER THOUGHT
OF YOU AS MY SON.

50
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,125
- THAT'S THE KING'S VOICE.

51
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,041
- YEAH, WHERE THE HECK IS HE?

52
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:39,458
- YOU HAVE SOME NERVE.  YOU
CAN'T RUN OFF FOR SEVEN YEARS

53
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:42,375
AND THEN SUDDENLY WALTZ BACK IN
AS THOUGH NOTHING HAPPENED.

54
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:45,833
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN FOOL ME?

55
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,541
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN
IN EARTH LAND

56
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,250
SEALING ALL OF THE ANIMAS.
YOU'RE A TRAITOR.

57
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:53,083
AND AS SUCH, YOU MUST BE
PUNISHED FOR YOUR ACTIONS.

58
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,500
- WHERE'S THAT VOICE
COMING FROM?

59
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,458
I HAVE NO IDEA BUT HE CERTAINLY
SOUNDS ANGRY, DOESN'T HE?

60
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,791
- COME ON.
SHOW YOURSELF, BUCKO.

61
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,833
- COME OUT AND FACE US.

62
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:07,083
- YOUR ANIMA PLAN HAS FAILED.
PLEASE SURRENDER PEACEFULLY.

63
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,291
YOU'VE NO REASON
TO FIGHT ANYMORE.

64
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,416
- RIDICULOUS.

65
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,166
WHO SAYS I NEED A REASON
TO FIGHT?

66
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,041
- DO YOU GUYS HEAR THAT?

67
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,833
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S COMING
FROM UNDERGROUND.

68
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,958
- FEEL THE MAGIC POWER
BUILDING UP IN THE AIR?

69
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:24,208
- THIS IS NOT A SIMPLE FIGHT.

70
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,833
NO, THIS IS RETRIBUTION.

71
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:31,166
THE EXTERMINATION OF ALL WHO
WOULD DARE TO OPPOSE THEIR KING.

72
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:37,958
- WHAT IS THAT THING?
- SOME KIND OF MAGIC WEAPON?

73
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,875
- SINCE YOU AND YOUR MEDDLESOME
FRIENDS INSIST

74
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,500
ON STANDING IN MY WAY,

75
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,416
I'VE NO CHOICE BUT TO OBLITERATE
EACH ONE OF YOU,

76
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,875
REGARDLESS OF WHO YOU ARE.

77
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,125
- FATHER, PLEASE.

78
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,375
- I'M NOT YOUR FATHER.

79
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:58,208
I AM THE KING OF EDOLAS.

80
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,875
IF I DISPOSE OF YOU HERE
AND NOW,

81
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:07,208
I'LL NO LONGER WORRY ABOUT YOU
SEALING MY ANIMAS IN EARTH LAND.

82
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:11,125
I'LL BE FREE TO CREATE ANOTHER
GIANT LACRIMA

83
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,250
AND FUSE IT
WITH THE EXCEEDS.

84
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,541
LIMITLESS MAGIC POWER
WILL BE MINE!

85
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:17,750
- OH, NO.

86
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,416
- ( laughing )

87
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,875
TRY AS YOU MIGHT,
THERE IS NO STOPPING ME.

88
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,250
I AM THE KING.

89
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,416
MY POWER IS ABSOLUTE.

90
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,875
- ALL OF THAT MAGIC
CAN YOU FEEL IT?

91
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,583
- I CAN AND I RECOGNIZE
THAT FORM.

92
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:52,333
- NO, THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.
- IS THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS?

93
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,416
- DORMA ANIM.

94
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,416
- THE DORMA ANIM.

95
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,125
FROM OUR OLD LANGUAGE,
IT MEANS DRAGON KNIGHT.

96
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,625
IT'S ENHANCED DRAGON ARMOR.

97
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,708
- Natsu: A DRAGON?

98
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:08,083
- CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE ONE.
DON'T YOU GUYS THINK SO?

99
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,000
- IS IT MAGIC ARMOR?

100
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,041
- IT'S UNLIKE ANY
I'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE.

101
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:15,250
- Coco: IT'S AN ENHANCED ARMOR
MADE FROM AN ANTI-MAGIC LACRIMA

102
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,166
CALLED "WIZARD CANCELLER."

103
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,291
IT'S BAD NEWS FOR US,
BECAUSE OUR ATTACKS

104
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:23,625
WON'T HAVE ANY EFFECT ON IT.
THE KING MUST BE INSIDE OF IT.

105
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,833
HE'S CONTROLLING
THE DORMA ANIM'S EVERY MOVE.

106
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:31,333
- AS YOUR KING, I ORDER YOU
TO CAPTURE THE EXCEEDS AT ONCE.

107
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,041
- All: YES, SIR!

108
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,583
- HURRY.
FLY FOR YOUR LIVES.

109
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,000
- ( screaming )

110
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,833
- THEY'RE GETTING AWAY.
- MAGICALIZING CANNON.

111
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,750
CHARGED AND READY.
- FIRE!

112
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,958
- FLY AWAY.  HURRY.

113
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,541
- WE MUST FLEE, MY QUEEN

114
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,791
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS HERE.

115
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:03,000
EVERYONE, TRY TO STAY STRONG.

116
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:06,875
- AFTER THEM.
- YES, CAPTAIN.

117
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,791
- DO YOUR BEST TO PROTECT
THE EXCEEDS FROM THE ROYAL ARMY.

118
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,875
I'M GOING TO TRY
TO TAKE DOWN KNIGHTWALKER.

119
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:15,416
- YOU GOT IT.
WELL, LOOK AT YOU.

120
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,833
GOOD JOB.  I THOUGHT RIDING THIS
LEGION WOULD MAKE YOU NAUSEOUS.

121
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:22,166
DID WENDY CAST A SPELL TO HELP
YOU WITH YOUR MOTION SICKNESS?

122
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,291
- OH!  JEEZ!  WHY WOULD I BE
NAUSEOUS WHEN I'M NOT EVEN

123
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:29,166
RIDING ON A VEHICLE?  THIS GUY'S
LENDING US A HAND AS OUR ALLY.

124
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,916
MAN, YOU'RE CRUEL.
- I'M SORRY.  THAT'S MY MISTAKE.

125
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,416
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA BARF,
BUT IT'S JUST YOUR UGLY FACE.

126
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,833
- WE'VE GOTTA STOP THAT MONSTER.
HELP ME OUT, LOSERS.

127
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,583
- HEY,
WHO YOU CALLING A LOSER?

128
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,208
- I WOULDN'T GO NEAR THAT THING
IF I WERE YOU.

129
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,833
YOUR MAGIC IS USELESS
AGAINST IT.

130
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,708
- WE'LL JUST HAVE TO
DODGE ITS ATTACKS.

131
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,041
WE MUST DO WHAT WE CAN
TO PROTECT THE EXCEEDS.

132
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,166
THEY'RE COMPLETELY
DEFENSELESS RIGHT NOW.

133
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,166
- ALL RIGHT, HERE GOES.

134
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,500
- THINK YOU CAN DODGE ME?
WE'LL SEE.

135
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,500
( laughs )

136
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,875
I WILL OBLITERATE ANYONE
WHO GETS IN MY WAY.

137
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:06,041
I WON'T LET A SINGLE HUMAN
ESCAPE MY WRATH.

138
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:09,333
BE GONE!

139
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,791
- OH!

140
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,583
- MYSTOGAN.

141
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,250
- MYSTOGAN.  DON'T TELL ME
THAT'S THE NAME YOU CHOSE

142
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:20,291
TO BE CALLED IN EARTH LAND?
YOUR NAME'S JELLAL.

143
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,541
- ERZA, GET OUT OF HERE
WHILE YOU STILL CAN.

144
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,833
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?
- FORGET ABOUT ME.

145
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,875
- WILL HE BE OKAY?
- YEAH, HE'S GOT THIS.

146
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:33,083
THREE-LAYER MAGIC CIRCLE
MIRROR WATER!

147
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,291
- WHAT?
HE REFLECTED MY ATTACK.

148
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:43,375
- THINK THAT GOT HIM?
- OH, WOW.

149
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,958
MYSTOGAN'S SO POWERFUL.

150
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,333
- ( laughs )

151
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,458
GOODNESS.  THAT TICKLED.

152
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,375
- WHOA.
IT'S NOT EVEN SCRATCHED.

153
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,458
- YOU'RE KIDDING.
- THAT'S CRAZY.

154
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,333
- BEHOLD.

155
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,458
THIS IS THE POWER
OF THE GREAT WIZARD CANCELLER.

156
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:02,000
YOU CAN ATTACK WITH ALL YOUR
MIGHT BUT IT WILL NOT STOP ME.

157
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:06,500
THE DORMA ANIM IS IMPERVIOUS
TO ALL FORMS OF MAGIC.

158
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,958
- ( gasping )

159
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,666
 - ( screams )

160
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,666
- MYSTOGAN.

161
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,250
- THE MIGHTY PRINCE HAS FALLEN.

162
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,375
I'M SURE HE'LL FEEL RIGHT
AT HOME CRAWLING ALONG

163
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,208
THE GROUND WITH THE OTHER PESTS.

164
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,583
- ALL RIGHT, ICE MAKE LANCE.

165
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,666
- MAN, TALK ABOUT A ROUGH RIDE.

166
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,625
- IT'D MAKE ANYBODY SICK,
NOT JUST NATSU.

167
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:39,916
- ( screaming )
- FLY FASTER!

168
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,958
- OH, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT.

169
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:45,583
- I'M GOING TO TURN EVERY LAST
EXCEED INTO A SPARKLING LACRIMA.

170
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,375
- LEAVE IT TO THE HUMANS.
- ( crying )

171
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,666
- ONLY THEY WOULD COME UP WITH
SUCH A HORRIBLE CONTRAPTION.

172
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,208
- THE ONE WHO TURNS
THE HEAVENS BLACK

173
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,625
AND BRINGS WITH IT DESTRUCTION.

174
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,375
- THE STUFF OF NIGHTMARES.

175
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,041
DORMA ANIM
OR THE "DRAGON KNIGHT. "

176
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,041
- LEGEND HAS IT THAT LONG AGO

177
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,041
IT WAS USED TO ATTACK EXTALIA

178
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,958
AND IT NEARLY DESTROYED ALL
OF EDOLAS IN THE PROCESS.

179
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,375
- THE HUMANS WERE HORRIFIED

180
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,041
THEY CHOSE TO BAN ITS USE
AND SEAL IT AWAY FOREVER.

181
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,708
AND YET, HERE IT IS AGAIN.

182
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:18,375
- HOW WAS IT "NEARLY DESTROYED"?
YOU CARE TO ELABORATE?

183
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:22,291
- I'M AFRAID WE DON'T
KNOW THE DETAILS.

184
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:26,583
- BUT THE LEGEND SAYS THE MOMENT
THIS WORLD LOST MOST

185
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,166
OF ITS MAGIC POWER WAS
WHEN DORMA ANIM

186
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,250
FIRST TURNED
THE SKY BLACK.

187
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,916
- ( laughing )

188
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,583
- Gray: THIS SUCKS!  HOW ARE WE
TO FIGHT DODGING THIS THING?

189
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:42,333
- Coco: HANG IN THERE, LEGGIE.
- WE'VE GOTTA DO SOMETHING.

190
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,916
- LET'S USE LUCY AS A DECOY
TO DISTRACT THE DRAGON THINGY.

191
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,625
- SHUT YOUR FACE, FISH BREATH.
- JUST SAYING.

192
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:52,291
- NOW, NOW.
WE HAVE TO STAY FOCUSED YOU TWO.

193
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,333
- WHAT WAS THAT?

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,458
WHO'S ATTACKING?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

195
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:04,416
THE DORMA ANIM SHOULDN'T BE
AFFECTED BY THEIR MAGIC ATTACKS.

196
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,458
- SKY DRAGON ROAR!

197
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,875
- UGH!

198
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,875
YOU LITTLE BRAT!

199
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,583
- PRETTY IMPRESSIVE JOB, KIDDO.
- THANK YOU.

200
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:21,833
THE TWO OF YOU CAN CAUSE
A LOT MORE DAMAGE THAN I CAN.

201
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:25,333
- GEEZER, YOU'RE GONNA
REGRET HURTING MY CAT.

202
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,708
- IT WAS YOU.
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN.

203
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,875
- NATSU!
- PLEASE BE CAREFUL.

204
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,291
- YOU CAN DO IT.

205
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:36,791
- WE'RE GOOD.
JUST KEEP THE CATS SAFE.

206
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:40,041
- IN THAT CASE,
I'LL LEAVE IT TO YOU.

207
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,791
- Lucy: YOU SURE THEY'RE GONNA
BE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT MONSTER

208
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,500
ALL BY THEMSELVES?

209
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,500
- Gray: DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
OF COURSE THEY CAN.

210
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,500
WHO BETTER TO FIGHT A DRAGON

211
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,458
THAN THOSE WHO WERE TRAINED
TO DEFEAT THEM?

212
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:56,166
THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES
WHO STAND A CHANCE.

213
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,333
THE DRAGON SLAYERS.

214
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,375
- Girl: LOOK UP THERE.
THEY'RE LACRIMAS.

215
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,750
HAS EVERYONE BEEN TRANSFORMED?

216
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,541
- WHEN THE DRAGON CHAIN
WAS SEVERED,

217
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,750
THE KINGDOM LOST TEN YEARS'
WORTH OF MAGIC POWER.

218
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,541
EVEN IF THEY WERE TO MAGICALIZE
ALL OF THE EXCEEDS,

219
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:30,291
THEY WOULD NEVER BE ABLE
TO RECOVER THAT MUCH.

220
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,125
THEY'VE RESORTED
TO USING THE DORMA ANIM.

221
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,750
IF THEY'LL GO TO THAT EXTREME,

222
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,416
THEN WHO KNOWS
WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN NEXT?

223
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,125
- TRY NOT TO MOVE TOO
MUCH 'CAUSE IT'LL HURT.

224
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:41,666
- LILY,
THANK GOODNESS YOU'RE ALIVE.

225
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,583
- PRINCE.

226
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,333
- Man: GIMME A BREAK.

227
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,375
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

228
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,666
THREE SCRAWNY HUMANS ARE
TAKING ON THAT BEAST?

229
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,625
- THEY MUST BE CRAZY.
- MAYBE THEY'RE SUPER STRONG.

230
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,166
- NOW COME ALONG, CHAGOT.

231
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,083
- WE NEED TO GET YOU AS FAR AWAY
AS POSSIBLE, DEAR.

232
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,541
- IF YOU STAY YOU'RE BOUND
TO GET CAUGHT UP IN THE BATTLE.

233
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,291
- LET'S DO THIS, SALAMANDER.
- GREAT.

234
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,500
I HAVE TO TEAM UP
WITH YOU AGAIN.

235
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,500
- QUIT YOUR WHINING, WILL YOU?

236
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,583
- WE CAN SETTLE OUR SCORE
AFTER WE'RE DONE

237
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,083
KNOCKING THIS OLD GUY'S
TEETH IN.

238
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,083
- I'M ALL FIRED UP NOW.

239
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,583
- I WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU TRY.

240
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,625
- I'LL LEND A HAND.
SWIFT WINGS

241
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,750
THAT SPEED THROUGH THE HEAVENS.

242
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,041
- WHAT THE--

243
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:35,083
- THAT IS CRAZY.
MY BODY FEELS SO MUCH LIGHTER.

244
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,083
- VERNIER!

245
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,791
- HOW DID THEY DODGE MY ATTACK?

246
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,666
- WHOA!  WE'RE REALLY FLYING.

247
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,541
- I CAN'T LOCK MY TARGETS
ON THEM.

248
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,375
- FIRE DRAGON IRON FIST.

249
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,125
- IRON DRAGON CLUB.

250
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,875
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

251
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,291
THEIR ATTACKS SHOULDN'T
AFFECT ME.

252
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:08,500
WHY IS THE DORMA ANIM
TAKING DAMAGE?

253
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,583
- COME ON.
IT SHOULD'VE FALLEN BY NOW.

254
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,875
- THIS IS GONNA BE TOUGH.

255
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,708
- LET ME HELP.
I CALL UPON THEE,

256
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,916
THE STALWART MIGHT
TO CLEAVE THE HEAVENS.

257
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,791
- OH!
- WHAT'S SHE DOING NOW?

258
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,625
- ARMS!

259
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,208
- THAT'S AWESOME.
I FEEL WAY STRONGER.

260
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,625
- 'CAUSE IT'S AN ATTACK
ENHANCEMENT SPELL.

261
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,041
- YOU READY
TO CRUSH THIS OLD GUY?

262
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,458
- YEAH, YOU KNOW IT.
- NONSENSE.

263
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,375
WHY IS THEIR MAGIC POWER
INCREASING ALL OF A SUDDEN?

264
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:48,166
- FIRE DRAGON BRILLIANT FLAME.
- IRON DRAGON SPEAR, DEMON LOG.

265
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:51,875
- IT'S HER.

266
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,833
YOU'RE DONE FOR, BRAT.

267
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,916
LAUNCH DRAGON RIDER MISSILES.

268
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,750
- OH, NO,
LOOK OUT, WENDY!

269
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,625
- DON'T WORRY.
I CAN HANDLE THIS.

270
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,500
VERNIER!

271
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:15,916
- THEY'RE TRACKING HER?
- ( wincing )

272
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,833
- ( screaming )

273
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,250
- YOU SAVED ME.
- I WON'T LET HIM HURT YOU.

274
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,416
- TRY AND STOP ME.

275
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,333
- YOU AIN'T SHOOTING NO ONE,
YOU HEAR ME, OLD MAN?

276
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,166
- ( growls )

277
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:46,375
YOU'RE GRATING ON MY NERVES!

278
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,541
- THERE'S STILL
TWO MISSILES LEFT.

279
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,833
- HOW CAN THAT BE?
NO, WAIT, NATSU.

280
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,166
THOSE ARE DIFFERENT
THAN THE OTHERS.

281
00:15:57,125 --> 00:16:00,625
- ( screaming )

282
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:07,125
- ( laughing )

283
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,958
IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU LOWLY
WIZARDS LEARNED YOUR PLACE.

284
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,500
YOU COULDN'T SLAY A DRAGON
IF IT LAID DOWN BEFORE YOU.

285
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,750
HUH?  IMPOSSIBLE.

286
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:20,041
HE'S EATING THE FLAMES
FROM THE DRAGON RIDER MISSILES?

287
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,416
IS HE INSANE?

288
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,666
WHY IS HE EATING
THE DORMA ANIM'S TAIL?

289
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,250
- MAN, THAT WAS SOME SERIOUSLY
NASTY TASTING FIRE.

290
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,416
DON'T THINK I'VE EVER TASTED
A FLAME THAT GROSS BEFORE.

291
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,291
- ( spits )
THE IRON, TOO.

292
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,458
BAD STUFF, BUT EVEN SO...

293
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,916
- I'M STARTING TO FEEL LIKE
I GOT A REAL FIRE IN MY BELLY.

294
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,541
- ARE YOU TRYING
TO COPY ME, METALHEAD?

295
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,333
- IT WAS JUST A COINCIDENCE,
NUMB NUTS.

296
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,291
- UNBELIEVABLE.

297
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,708
ARE ALL EARTH LAND WIZARDS
THIS POWERFUL?

298
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:59,916
- MAN, THIS THING'S HARDCORE.

299
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,291
NO WONDER THEY CALL IT A DRAGON.

300
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,125
- THAT AIN'T A DRAGON.

301
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:07,125
IT'S JUST A DUMB, OLD MAN HIDING
INSIDE A BIG HUNK OF JUNK.

302
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:10,625
- HE'S OUT HERE ALONE WITHOUT
ANY GUARDS TO PROTECT HIM.

303
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,666
SO ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS TAKE
THAT THING DOWN.

304
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,291
- I'M FIRED UP NOW.

305
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:20,875
- SO THESE ARE
THE DRAGON SLAYERS.

306
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:24,708
( panting ) SUCH POWER.

307
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,875
I WILL NOT REST UNTIL
I HAVE IT FOR MYSELF.

308
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:31,500
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?
- THIS IS BAD, YOU GUYS.

309
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,500
IT'S GAINING POWER,
PULLING IT FROM THE AIR.

310
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:36,083
AND IT'S FLOWING
INTO THE ARMOR.

311
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:45,208
- ( laughs )
IF I CAPTURE THE DRAGON SLAYERS,

312
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:49,125
I'LL BE ABLE TO START
MY ANIMA PLAN OVER AGAIN.

313
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:55,916
THEY'RE THE KEY TO EVERLASTING
MAGIC POWER FOR EDOLAS.

314
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,791
WAIT.
WHAT AM I THINKING?

315
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:02,833
THEY'RE WEAPONS.
I SHOULD SECURE THEM FOR MYSELF.

316
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,708
IF THEY HAPPEN TO GET DAMAGED
IN THE PROCESS, SO BE IT.

317
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:08,625
I SHALL ROB YOU
OF THE WILL TO FIGHT.

318
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,625
YOU'LL BE BEGGING ME
FOR MERCY.

319
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:16,375
WITNESS THE POWER
OF DORMA ANIM.  BLACK HEAVEN!

320
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,000
I GOT YOU NOW.

321
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,958
- ( screaming )

322
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:39,000
- YOU'LL HAVE TO
DO BETTER THAN THAT.

323
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,875
- NO, NATSU.

324
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,500
- HE HIT THE THING WITH ARMS
ATTACK AND IT DIDN'T FLINCH.

325
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,458
- ( laughs )
CAN YOU FEEL IT,

326
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:52,666
THIS ABSOLUTE MAGIC POWER?
IT'S SPECTACULAR.

327
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,375
DON'T BOTHER FALLING TO YOUR
KNEES, BEGGING FOR YOUR LIVES.

328
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,833
STAY RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE,

329
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:02,458
SO I CAN WATCH YOU TREMBLE
IN FEAR.

330
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,083
YOU CAN'T STOP ME.

331
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:07,083
I'M THE ONE DRAGON
YOU CANNOT SLAY.

332
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,916
- ( screaming )

333
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,125
- FORGIVE ME, NATSU.

334
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:24,500
- YOUR HIGHNESS,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

335
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,625
I SAW WHAT HAPPENED.
WHY DID YOU LET HIM HIT YOU?

336
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:33,750
DON'T TELL ME THAT YOU DID
IT TO SAVE ME.

337
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,541
- I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

338
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,333
- I'M FINE.
IT'S BARELY A SCRATCH.

339
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,000
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

340
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:42,416
YOU'RE IN A LOT OF PAIN
RIGHT NOW AND YOU KNOW IT.

341
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,333
- WE'VE NO CHOICE BUT TO LEAVE
THE DORMA ANIM TO NATSU

342
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:48,125
AND THE OTHERS.  WE HAVE
ANOTHER MATTER TO ATTEND TO.

343
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,625
- WHAT MIGHT THAT BE?

344
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,875
- I HAVE ONE FINAL TASK,

345
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,083
AND I KNOW I WON'T BE ABLE
TO DO IT WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

346
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:06,625
- THIS IS HORRIBLE.
- I CAN HEAR THEIR SCREAMING.

347
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,500
- THE ROYAL ARMY,
THEY'VE ALMOST CAUGHT UP.

348
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,833
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THERE'S SO MANY OF 'EM.

349
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,583
- WHAT'LL WE DO?
- ONLY ONE THING WE CAN DO.

350
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:18,166
STOP THEM BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
THE EXCEEDS ARE COUNTING ON US.

351
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,958
- I WANNA HELP YOU FIGHT, ERZA.
- ME, TOO.

352
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:24,333
WE HAVE TO DO WHATEVER WE
CAN TO PROTECT OUR HOMELAND.

353
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:28,250
- I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU,
SCARLET.

354
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:32,208
- WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME?
- ( laughs )

355
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,791
- OH, NO.  IT'S A TRAP.
- WE'VE BEEN AMBUSHED.

356
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,958
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE, LEGGIE.

357
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,291
- ( screaming )
- LEGGIE, NO!

358
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,333
- HAPPY.
- AYE, SIR.

359
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:03,833
- THOSE WHO DARE TO THREATEN OUR
KING CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO LIVE.

360
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,791
WE MUST MAKE SURE NONE
OF THEM ESCAPE.

361
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:09,708
HEAD TO THE SURFACE.
- YES, CAPTAIN!

362
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:13,375
- PLEASE, YOU'VE GOT TO STOP
FLAILING, CHILD,

363
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:16,500
UNLESS YOU WANT ME TO DROP YOU.
- WE HAVE TO RESCUE LEGGIE.

364
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,875
- THANKS A LOT, CARLA.
HEY, YOU HEARD HER.

365
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,833
NOW QUIT SQUIRMING OR ELSE.

366
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,416
- AW, MAN.
YOU'RE SO HEAVY.

367
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,458
- YOU'RE SO DEAD
IF YOU DROP ME, CAT.

368
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:31,041
- HOLD ON.
DID WE FORGET SOMEONE?

369
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,041
- YEAH, WHERE'S ERZA?

370
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,708
- TRYING TO SNEAK UP ON ME?

371
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,333
- I'M READY TO FINISH
THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL

372
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,625
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU.

373
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:53,916
- GET TO THE SURFACE, MEN.

374
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I CAN HANDLE THIS ONE MYSELF.

375
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,750
- YES, CAPTAIN!

376
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:02,958
- RUINS OF THE WRETCHED
CATS' ANCIENT CITIES.

377
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,875
THIS SEEMS LIKE THE PERFECT
PLACE FOR YOUR GRAVE.

378
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:09,083
- WISHFUL THINKING. 
I WILL NOT DIE BY YOUR HAND.

379
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:13,250
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SOMEONE WITH MY FACE

380
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,000
COULD EVER CAUSE FAIRY TAIL
SO MUCH PAIN.

381
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,625
- WELL, I CAN'T BELIEVE
SOMEONE WITH MY FACE

382
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,541
WOULD BARE THEIR FANGS
AT THE KING.

383
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:25,833
- COME GET ME.
- I WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO.

384
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:36,500
- Both:
I WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING,

385
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:39,958
NOT UNTIL I'VE RID
THIS WORLD OF YOU.

386
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,083
- ( theme music playing )

387
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,958
- Happy:
HEY, NATSU, I'VE BEEN WONDERING.

388
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:18,083
WHAT'S THE MEANING OF LIFE?
- WHOA, WHERE'D THAT COME FROM?

389
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,291
YOU DIDN'T EAT ANY WEIRD
MUSHROOMS, DID YOU?

390
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,958
- NO WAY.  I HATE MUSHROOMS.
ARE YOU GONNA ANSWER ME OR WHAT?

391
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:24,583
- HOLD ON, LET ME THINK

392
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:27,541
I'D SAY THE MEANING OF LIFE IS
EATING, SLEEPING AND FIGHTING.

393
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:30,541
- YOU'RE NEVER GONNA BE A
PHILOSOPHER, THAT'S FOR SURE.

394
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:35,875
- FINE, WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS?
- FISH.

395
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:39,625
CATCHING FISH, COOKING FISH,
EATING FISH.  THEY'RE SO YUMMY.

396
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:41,958
- YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO CRITICIZE ME, PAL.
