[HAPPY] Nothing's wrong.

162
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:37,166
Oh, cool. Well, it's show time!

163
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,791
Hold on. I'm not
gonna say anything.

164
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,041
Do you know what
I mean by that?

165
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,000
Hm.

166
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:52,583
[NATSU] Yeah.
I hear ya, Partner.

167
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,083
[distant rumbling]

168
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,708
[CHAPATI] The energy is
electric here in Domus Flau!

169
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,625
We may be seeing
history in the making!

170
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,458
Can Fairy Tail take
back Sabertooth's title

171
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,250
as Fiore's mightiest?

172
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,708
Four dragons are squaring
off in a battle so intense,

173
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,291
it's crashed through the floor!

174
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,541
[YAJIMA] One seems to
be missing in action.

175
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,208
[CHAPATI] Right you are,
which means Fairy Tail's

176
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:30,416
Natsu Dragneel has to win
the match all by himself!

177
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,458
It's gotten rather quiet.

178
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:36,291
Kinda. But there's a
weird tension in the air.

179
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,708
[CARLA]
Can you sense it, child?

180
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,791
[WENDY] Yeah.
I wonder what it is.

181
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,833
[NATSU] Hey. Are ya
feelin' any better?

182
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,958
[LUCY] I'm getting there.

183
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,958
Is your match about to start?

184
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:52,166
[NATSU] Yep. And I'm
gonna win it for sure.

185
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,208
[LUCY] Natsu.

186
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,750
Huh?

187
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:58,500
I believe in you.
And I always have,

188
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,750
from the moment
I joined the guild.

189
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:04,250
Thanks! That means a lot to me.

190
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,583
[EVERGREEN] Please, I think your
bandages are just too tight!

191
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,500
[ELFMAN] You're just jealous
'cause you can't feel it!

192
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,875
[PORLYUSICA] Would you stop the
"old married couple" routine?

193
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,250
[EVERGREEN and ELFMAN]
We're not a couple!

194
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,708
I will always be
watching over you.

195
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:20,125
No matter what happens. Right?

196
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,500
[CARLA and WENDY giggle]

197
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,750
[PORLYUSICA]
You've really done it.

198
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,125
You've taken this group
of misfits and made them

199
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:37,083
into a strong and
loving family. Bravo.

200
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,791
[MAVIS] There are some
walls that power alone

201
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,416
will never break through.

202
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,250
However...

203
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:48,041
it is possible
to get beyond them.

204
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,083
[BOTH] Holy Shadow
Dragon Flash Fang!

205
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,083
[MAVIS] If you
harness your feelings...

206
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,375
Dragon Slayer Secret Art!

207
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,833
[NATSU] Flame Lotus
Exploding Flame Blade!

208
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,958
[CHAPATI] Whoa momma!
The fighters have unleashed

209
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,708
major techniques and
the clash is sending

210
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,291
shockwaves all
throughout the arena!

211
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,625
It seems to have had an
effect on the lacrima-trons!

212
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,208
Just some technical
difficulties, folks.

213
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,000
We should be back up soon!

214
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,291
I don't sense
any magic power.

215
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,958
I think the fight
might be over, you guys.

216
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,166
[CHAPATI] All right!
Ladies and gentlemen,

217
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,666
looks like we are
back in business!

218
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,875
Sorry for the delay, but who
could have seen that coming?

219
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,416
[ROGUE groans]

220
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,041
Natsu... Dragneel...

221
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:50,916
Your power... knows no bounds.

222
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:57,333
[STING]
Sorry, Lector. I failed.

223
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:00,583
He's... too strong.

224
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,416
[CHAPATI] Unbelievable.
The last man standing

225
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,833
is Fairy Tail's Natsu Dragneel!

226
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:13,375
[MAVIS] A guild is a place where
those feelings are nurtured.

227
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,625
--[bell dinging]
--[NATSU] Yeah!

228
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,166
[CROWD cheers]

229
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,125
[CHAPATI] Let's hear it for
Natsu, who singlehandedly

230
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,708
took down Sabertooth's
Twin Dragons!

231
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,250
[BOTH laughing]

232
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,875
[CHAPATI] It's a huge
win for Fairy Tail!

233
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,875
They've moved into first place!

234
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,041
What an exciting
way to end day four

235
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,250
of the Grand Magic Games!

236
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,166
We're giving the fighters
a day to recuperate,

237
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,416
and then it's on to
the thrilling conclusion!

238
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,791
It's all culminating
in one ultimate match!

239
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,125
A game that puts
every team member

240
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,541
on the field to duke it
out in a battle royale!

241
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,666
Only one guild
gets the title, folks!

242
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,375
So... you won't
want to miss it!

243
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:51,458
[CROWD cheering]

244
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:54,458
I just knew the fairies
would end up on top!

245
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,541
There's no doubt about it.
They're a wild bunch!

246
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:58,875
Thanks to this
big turn-around,

247
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,291
we're gonna have to
beat them instead.

248
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,083
Heh. Bring it!

249
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,791
[GUILDS] Fairy Tail
is goin' down!

250
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:10,083
Watch out, Gray.
I'm coming!

251
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,875
My target...

252
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,583
is the would-be-heir, Laxus.

253
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,250
Titania.

254
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,166
Let's find Gajeel.

255
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,791
[ICHIYA] Your parfum is
irresistible... Natsu.

256
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:25,083
[LECTOR crying]

257
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,958
It'll be okay.

258
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:32,333
[crying]

259
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:33,833
I can't believe they
both got their butts

260
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,791
handed to 'em by one guy.

261
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,333
[RUFUS chuckles]

262
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,750
It was fascinating to behold.

263
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,625
I've fully committed
it to memory.

264
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,083
Heh. I'm gonna have a
lotta fun holdin' this

265
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,250
over their heads for a while.

266
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,666
[MINERVA] Perhaps you will.

267
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,958
Of course, that's assuming
they have that long.

268
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,333
This guy's about
to explode over here!

269
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,958
[MALE 175B] That's
Sabertooth's master!

270
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:08,958
[MINERVA] So your power
comes from feelings, does it?

271
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,541
[STING] Fine, whatever.
I didn't need this win,

272
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,333
so I'll just let you guys have
it. Sabertooth's just gonna

273
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,708
keep rackin' up
the points after this.

274
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,375
In the end, one
measly little point

275
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,416
isn't gonna change the outcome.

276
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,875
One point is nothin'
to scoff at, kid.

277
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,958
[GAJEEL] Don't you forget that!

278
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,541
[STING grunts]

279
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,250
[NATSU] Let's do
it again sometime!

280
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:42,916
[ROGUE] A complete and
utter loss. I wonder...

281
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,125
could Gajeel be as
strong a fighter as Natsu?

282
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,541
[ROGUE] If that's true,
how could I have

283
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:52,041
ever been so arrogant?

284
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,875
Way to go, pal!

285
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,833
Let's go tell Lucy that
Fairy Tail is back on top!

286
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,541
That was pretty
freakin' awesome, man!

287
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,916
Thanks, dude! I had fun!

288
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,833
What you did today
deserves genuine praise!

289
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,916
You're really
something else, Natsu.

290
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,125
Ah, ya think?

291
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,000
Yeah.

292
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,333
That hurt!

293
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,375
I applaud your victory.

294
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,458
But do you know what
happened to your partner?

295
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,208
Oh, ya mean Gajeel?

296
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,791
Yeah, that jerk took off
in the middle of the fight.

297
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,750
Did he just forget that he
was on my team all of a sudden?

298
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:27,041
More like, you just forgot
what you did to your teammate.

299
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,000
That's classic Natsu!

300
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:32,041
Be sure to remember that
tomorrow is a day of rest.

301
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,500
And then it's on
to the final round.

302
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,666
I can't wait for that.

303
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,458
We're gonna be number
one in Fiore again!

304
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,083
And when that's done!
I'll fight both you turkeys

305
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,875
for the number one
spot in the guild!

306
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,375
I'll be ready.

307
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:49,625
Let's just get past these
games first, okay guys?

308
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,875
[ELFMAN and WENDY chuckle]

309
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,125
It's good to see you.

310
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,500
You're not gonna
ask how it went?

311
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:05,375
I don't need to. I told
you I believed in you,

312
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,125
since the very beginning.

313
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:11,250
Hm. But this still ain't over.

314
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,791
We're just gettin' started.

315
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:17,000
We still gotta win this
thing! Well, don't we?

316
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:20,333
Of course, child. We've
come this far after all.

317
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,458
Can ya believe we started off
at the bottom of the barrel?

318
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,666
The audience had
the gall to boo us.

319
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,500
We suffered defeat and
humiliation along the way.

320
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,208
But now we can
practically taste victory!

321
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,708
Natsu? Remember what you said?

322
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,583
It was right after I lost
my fight against Flare.

323
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,708
You told me that zero
points was a great place

324
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,791
to start an epic comeback.

325
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:44,291
That's right! We're
climbing back to the top!

326
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:47,833
Fairy Tail wizards never back
down and we're not startin' now!

327
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,833
[MAKAROV] Let's win
the thirty million Jewel!

328
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,833
[ALL] That's not why we're here!

329
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:58,583
First place! Ya with me?

330
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,625
[ALL] Yeah!

331
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,375
[LUCY] So much has happened
since I first joined this guild.

332
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,833
So many tears, so many laughs.

333
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,666
So many special
moments I got to share

334
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,916
with people that
mean the world to me.

335
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,916
I couldn't be more
proud to call myself

336
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,791
a member of Fairy Tail!

337
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,125
[giggles]

338
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:55,541
[GAJEEL] Damn you, Salamander.
If you lived through that fight,

339
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,666
I'm gonna kill you for this.

340
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,041
Where the hell
am I, anyway?

341
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,583
Still under the coliseum?

342
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,083
Hm?

343
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:12,083
Whoa. I don't believe it.

344
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:15,583
[GAJEEL] Is this some
kinda dragon graveyard?

345
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,750
[ULTEAR]
Jellal. What's going on?

346
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:23,000
[MELDY] Oh no,
did they get away again?

347
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,458
[JELLAL] No.
I'm still tailing them.

348
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:28,791
I'm waiting for the
opportunity to make my move.

349
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,541
[ULTEAR and MELDY] Understood.

350
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:34,000
[JELLAL] I'm not letting
you out of my sight.

351
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,958
I need to find out
why you remind me

352
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:39,833
so much of Zeref. Who are you?

353
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,333
[YUKINO] So Natsu's done it.

354
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:47,083
He's defeated Sabertooth
all by himself.

355
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:50,583
[IRIKI] You must feel a bit
conflicted, Sergeant Yukino.

356
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:54,666
[YUKINO] No. My attachments to
that guild have been severed.

357
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,250
[YUKINO] I'm fine.
What's difficult is

358
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,083
getting used to being
called "Sergeant."

359
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,416
I understand completely, ma'am.

360
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,625
But your involvement with
Eclipse requires a rank.

361
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,750
It's a military
project, after all.

362
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,708
You'll get used
to it soon enough.

363
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,208
This is an
important undertaking.

364
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,958
[YUKINO] I am prepared
to do whatever may be

365
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:19,666
required of me to ensure the
success of this operation.

366
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,916
And I'm very grateful
to Arcadios...

367
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,291
for extending his invitation.

368
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:28,250
Wait. I suppose I should
call him "Colonel" instead.

369
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,125
Don't worry about it.

370
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,916
I usually just call
him "sir" myself.

371
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,458
[IRIKI] Some of his oldest
friends get away with "Dio."

372
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,958
Is that so?

373
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:42,083
[YUKINO] He doesn't
seem to have many friends.

374
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:46,708
[YUKINO] It's bizarre.
He's trying to save the world,

375
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:49,083
but nobody knows about it.

376
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,000
[gasps]

377
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,958
What's up? Are you okay?

378
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,458
Yes.

379
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,166
[CARLA] It's that
strange premonition again.

380
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,000
Mercurius crashing down.

381
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,708
[LEVY] Did you hear? We won!

382
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,000
[LUCY] Hey guys!

383
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:12,000
Are you two starting
to feel any better?

384
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,041
I brought snacks,
if you're hungry!

385
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,625
If we can keep
our spirits up,

386
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,583
we're gonna win
this thing after all!

387
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:21,583
Oh yeah! There's no way Team
Fairy Tail is losing now!

388
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:25,500
That's right! Especially
after seeing that fight today!

389
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:26,875
We are on a real hot streak,

390
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:28,916
and there's
just one more to go!

391
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,458
You wouldn't know where
Gajeel went, would ya?

392
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:34,250
Haven't seen him
since before the fight.

393
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:37,375
[LUCY] What? Ya mean
he's still not back yet?

394
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:40,166
[ELFMAN] He's probably stuffin'
his face with iron somewhere.

395
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,125
[LUCY] He'll be back
before too long.

396
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,875
[WENDY] Sure he will!

397
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:46,708
Hmmm...

398
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:54,375
[LEVY] It was nice. Everyone was
positive that we were winning.

399
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:58,541
Then the fight on that
final day was so intense.

400
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:00,833
Do you remember it, Lucy?

401
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:05,125
[LEVY] That happiness
was such a stark contrast

402
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:07,166
to what was to come.

403
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:11,458
On that fateful day...
July seventh.

404
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:15,583
When everything we'd
hoped for turned to ash.

405
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:25,791
[LEVY] First they died.
Then we lost.

406
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:30,375
We loved them so much. But...

407
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:37,125
[LEVY] I can barely even
write this. Please, Lucy.

408
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,750
I can't take it anymore.

409
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:43,125
I just want someone to help me.

410
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:48,958
[JELLAL] Stop right there!

411
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:54,958
Reveal your identity.
I have already revealed mine.

412
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,666
[JELLAL] A woman?

413
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:18,875
No way!

414
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:34,250
[LUCY, HAPPY, and NATSU]
Thanks, everybody!

415
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:37,083
[NATSU] We'll catch
you later, okay?
