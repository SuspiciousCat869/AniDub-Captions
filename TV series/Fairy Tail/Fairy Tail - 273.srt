1
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:23,958
[gasps]

2
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,500
This is bad.

3
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:31,958
Blast 'em!

4
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,833
[MAVIS]
Focus my feelings.

5
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,875
[MAVIS] That's the part
that I've already mastered.

6
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:57,375
[MAVIS]
I just need to go deeper.

7
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,958
[screams]

8
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,458
Yeah!

9
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:13,625
[chuckles]

10
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,375
This is awesome!

11
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,375
My whole body's pulsing
with magic power!

12
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,833
Mine, too! I think
we're finally ready.

13
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:23,291
[PRECHT]
Now we can fight.

14
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,666
So what do you all think?

15
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,291
I'm the black wizard Mavis!

16
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,041
You like my new look?

17
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,333
[MAVIS] Now that the
stranger in the woods

18
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,083
had taught us
how to use magic,

19
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,750
we needed to train hard

20
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,750
and focus on honing our
new-found skills as wizards

21
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,125
so we could hold our
own against Blue Skull.

22
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,291
As we began to
master our abilities,

23
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,416
our confidence grew ten-fold.

24
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,666
It was then we realized
this wasn't any old magic.

25
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,708
This was our magic.

26
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,583
[YURI] Say what? Now you
wanna liberate Magnolia?

27
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,000
Yes.

28
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,833
What's happening to the people
there breaks my heart.

29
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,916
I can't watch them
suffer anymore.

30
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,500
Don't be ridiculous!

31
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,750
The only reason we're here
is to snatch the Tenrou Orb

32
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,333
from Blue Skull and that's it!

33
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,125
We're just hunting for treasure!

34
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,750
Just because we learned magic
doesn't make us superheroes!

35
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:11,916
Don't forget.

36
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,541
Our ultimate objective
in learning magic

37
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,791
was to utilize it in battle.

38
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,458
Now is the time. There's
nothing holding us back.

39
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,500
Look, I know that wizard
had some really nice things

40
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:21,666
to say about your skills,

41
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,541
but you can't let
that go to your head!

42
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:24,875
Think about the numbers, man!

43
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,791
Four brand new wizards
are really gonna take down

44
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,291
a guild with hundreds of 'em?

45
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,208
It'll never happen. It's insane.

46
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,625
It sounds to me like
you're too afraid

47
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,833
of gettin' your
butt kicked again.

48
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,875
I'm not afraid.
I'm just being logical!

49
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,416
Listen, man.

50
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,000
We've seen a bunch of cities
that were just as bad this one,

51
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:43,375
but we always had reasons
why we couldn't help.

52
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,625
Now that we have this kinda
power, we're all out of excuses.

53
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,375
It's time to act.

54
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,750
[MAVIS]
Okay.

55
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,708
I've come up with
our plan of action.

56
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:30,916
Anybody here?

57
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,375
We've come back.

58
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,958
It's you. Hey, Mommy!

59
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,291
Sorry that we're
running a little late.

60
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,375
Did you find their base?

61
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,625
We did, without
anybody spotting us.

62
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:45,791
Why are you here?

63
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,791
Oh, I wasn't expecting you.

64
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,750
I thought you left the
city after our talk.

65
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,833
We need to ask a favor of you.

66
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,333
Do you think you can get a
small group of people together?

67
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,291
Even just two or three
would be fine.

68
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,833
The most important thing
is they have to be loud.

69
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:00,833
[MAKO]
I don't understand.

70
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,416
Just gather a few people.

71
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,916
I promise, I'll explain
everything to you later.

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,416
We're going to change things
for the better in this city.

73
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,500
But we can't do it
without a little help.

74
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,625
I appreciate it, but I'm
afraid that's impossible.

75
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,958
[MAVIS] Don't say that!
Nothing is impossible!

76
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,291
What happened here
is a real tragedy.

77
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,875
The people can't go on
living like this any longer.

78
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,666
It's time to fight back.

79
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,166
We're more than willing
to lead the way

80
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,666
and fight on the front line.

81
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,833
But we're gonna need the people
of Magnolia to back us up.

82
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:31,458
Please help us.
Let's take back this city!

83
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,708
I know someone.

84
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,416
What about the blacksmith?

85
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,541
He's always angry
and super loud!

86
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,041
He sounds like the
perfect guy to me.

87
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:44,083
[MAVIS] Me too. Do you know
where we can find him?

88
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,791
Whaddaya want?!
Can't ya see I'm busy?!

89
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,833
Come on! Out with it!

90
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,375
Tell me! Who are these people?!

91
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,833
This guy's a piece o' work.

92
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,125
He sure is loud.

93
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,500
You're perfect for us!

94
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,750
Whaddaya talkin'
about?! Huh?! Hm?

95
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,083
Hey, mister.

96
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,458
They came here to save our
city from the bad guys.

97
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:05,625
What?!

98
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,500
Are you crazy?!
Who are you, really?

99
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,875
I know how it sounds,
but just hear them out.

100
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,583
Little Miko told us that
you're always angry.

101
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,000
Well, she's 100%
right about that!

102
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,666
I'm angry at Blue Skull.

103
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,291
I'm angry about what
happened to the city.

104
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,250
And most of all
I'm angry at myself!

105
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,625
I believe you.

106
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,791
But would you be willing

107
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,416
to truly direct your
anger at Blue Skull?

108
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,375
Whaddaya mean? Would I?

109
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,291
You got some kinda
wild idea in mind?

110
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,875
I don't know, but things
sure could get wild.

111
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,250
If you wanted them to.

112
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,291
I dunno what you're
gettin' at here,

113
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,916
but you can count me in, missy!

114
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,625
Listen up! I ain't takin'
this garbage anymore!

115
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,333
[KERSEY] So I'm gonna go up
to those Blue Skull jerks

116
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,125
and give them a
piece of my mind!

117
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,125
Who's with me?

118
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,750
You can count me in, buddy!

119
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:57,791
Yeah, me too!

120
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,875
I'm so sick of this crap!

121
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,041
Let's go up there and
do somethin' about it!

122
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,916
All right! Anyone else?

123
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,416
I'll go with ya!

124
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,833
I'm with you, too!

125
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,500
[PRECHT] That Mavis is
really something else.

126
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,208
Before, everyone here was
too scared to even speak up,

127
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,083
but look what happens
when she gets involved.

128
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,625
[KERSEY]
Let's go!

129
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,500
[CROWD]
Yeah!

130
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,958
[KERSEY]
All right, folks!

131
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,625
We're goin' up to Blue Skull
and tellin' 'em to shove it!

132
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,916
There's strength in numbers,
so the more the merrier!

133
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,041
Magnolia is our city!

134
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:33,000
Are we just gonna sit around
and take this crap? Hell no!

135
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:36,333
So come with us!
We're takin' this city back!

136
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,833
Let's kick those
thugs outta here!

137
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,041
[YURI] I think it's safe
to say that angry mob

138
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,916
is gonna keep the guild's
wizards busy for a little while.

139
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,208
[PRECHT] Yes. Giving us
our chance to strike.

140
00:08:56,833 --> 00:09:00,375
[MAN A] Hey, Blue Skull!
We're goin' hungry out here!

141
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,791
[WOMAN A] Please!
My children are starving!

142
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,125
Give us some food!

143
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:07,125
[MAN B] How can you do
this to us? We need help!

144
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,833
Open up those doors,
ya damn cowards!

145
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,166
Thank you for doing this.

146
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,666
I kept saying that we
should do something

147
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,125
to help the people of this city,

148
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:20,291
but even so, you're the only
one who'd listen to me.

149
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:24,666
Well, I was thinking the
exact same thing actually.

150
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,125
These people are hurting.

151
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,458
The life was getting
choked out of this city.

152
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,708
Blue Skull put us through
hell on Tenrou Island,

153
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,833
but what's happening
here might be worse.

154
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:36,291
They're all living in fear, and
made to suffer on a daily basis.

155
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,041
We've no choice but
to step in and fight

156
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,041
before they lose every
last shred of hope.

157
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,375
We barely made it in time.

158
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,208
[MAVIS]
Speaking of time...

159
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,958
This is Master Geoffrey's
favorite hunting ground.

160
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,458
The mountains north of the city.

161
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,875
Apparently he goes
there fairly often.

162
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,875
I get ya. We're gonna launch
a sneak attack on him.

163
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,125
Not exactly.

164
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,208

Huh?

[chuckles]

166
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:15,958
[MAVIS]
There's no way we could beat him

167
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,875
in a head-to-head battle.

168
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,708
What a beaut'! Nice shootin'!

169
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:21,958
[MAVIS]
We may have grown stronger,

170
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,833
and we can use a
few fighting spells,

171
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,291
but he is the master
of a large wizard guild.

172
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,583
Something's not right
with those trees.

173
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,958
[MAVIS] For now, we're making a
declaration of war against them.

174

What the--?

175
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,541
Did that tree attack us?

176
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,125
It's nothing to worry about.

177
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,958
I know you're hiding up there,
so show yourself!

178
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,708
We've got your base.

179
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,625
Kardia Cathedral's ours now.

180
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,708
That means all your
treasure is too.

181
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,583
You guys've got boatloads
of expensive stuff in there.

182
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,166
It should net us a lotta Jewel!

183
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,625
I know who you are.

184
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:00,958
So you've learned some magic

185
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,416
and you've come to take
your revenge, is that it?

186
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,708
Good guess. But we've
already taken our revenge.

Master Geoffrey!

Magnolia's on fire!
It's burning down!

190
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,041
[MAVIS]
You're a tough guy, Warrod,

191
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,750
but you don't stand a chance
against his kind of power.

192
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:17,958
But how?

193
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,875
[MAVIS] You'll have to
make a break for it.

194
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,708
[WARROD] Well, that's all
I got! Later, losers!

Now, men! After him!

What are you gonna do?

197
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,541
Go back to Magnolia!

198
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,958
How could this be happening?

199
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:33,333
They were weak! They ran
from us like cowards!

200
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,916
I'll hunt them down and
make them suffer for this!

201
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,500
The rest of their lives
will be nothing but pain!

202
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,083
They cannot destroy my kingdom!

203
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,583
The city's engulfed in flames!

Can I not leave my men
unsupervised for one afternoon?

[MAVIS]
Seven years ago...

206
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,208
[MAVIS]
...you invaded our island.

207
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,458
You burned down our homes.

208
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,333
And slaughtered our
families, without mercy!

209
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,375
So you're the one behind this.

210
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,958
You brought this on yourself.

211
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,083

[MAVIS]
Hm?

219
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:45,583
Really? It's another illusion.

220
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:49,416
I was afraid you'd actually
gone and learned real magic.

221
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,708
But all you've done is conjured
another cheap parlor trick.

222
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,208
It's insulting!

223
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,916
When will you realize you
can't win with empty threats?

You think I'm afraid of
your pretend firestorm?

You were so upset that
you didn't even notice

the ride back home was shorter.

The whole city was an illusion?

How were you able to pull off
a spell of that magnitude?

00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:37,041
We were taught by a wizard
more powerful than you.

The real Magnolia is over there.
Still in one piece.

Whatever you do,

you must never make physical
contact with the orb!

00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,916
That's where it gets tricky.

321
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,958
[MAVIS]
Are you saying you've found it?

322
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,458
Yes, as a matter of fact,
it's right here.

323
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,166
And I am not gonna let go of it.

324
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,166
Put it down! It's dangerous!

325
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,083
This is Tenrou's sacred stone,

326
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,583
passed down for
generations, right?

327
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,875
I'm serious. The orb's cursed.

328
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:01,083
It has a dark secret that
I was never told about.

329
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,750
I'm begging you.
Please listen to me.

330
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,791
What you're holding
is pure evil.

331
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,166
What do you mean?

332
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,583
[MAVIS] Long ago,
it absorbed massive amounts

333
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,291
of evil magic energy.

334
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,833
It was impossible to control,

335
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,916
so it was taken to Tenrou Island
to keep people away from it.

336
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,833
Any human who touches it
will succumb to its curse.

337
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:23,083
The evil energy will completely
take control of you! You'll die!

338
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,583
Put it down! Let it go
right this instant!

339
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:26,958
Oh, please.

340
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,916
Do you actually believe
this crap she's telling us?

341
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,708
I'm telling you the truth!

342
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:31,916
I don't buy it.

343
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,291
You may be a crafty
little thing,

344
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,416
but I am not gonna
fall for this one!

345
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,375
You just want it for yourself.

346
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:40,041
And this is the only way you
think that I'll give it up.

347
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,583
Oh, jeez. You're
so damn stubborn.

348
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,541
You gotta put it down.
Please, Yuri!

349
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:48,333
I told you this treasure
is mine! You can't have it!

350
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,208
[MAVIS, ZERA gasp]

351
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,750
What's happening to me?

352
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:04,875
[PRECHT]
Yuri!

353
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,541
[screaming]

354
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:12,333
Master Geoffrey was right
about the curse!

355
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,666
[YURI screams]

356
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:36,083
[CROWD gasping, chattering]

357
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:42,833
[roars]

358
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,041
[KERSEY]
Holy crap!

359
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:44,958
I'm scared!

360
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,916
It's gonna be okay.

361
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:52,708
[CROWD screaming]

362
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:04,541
[DRAGON roars]

363
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,333
What the hell is going on?!

364
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,000
How is that thing alive?

365
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,333
[PRECHT]
What just happened?

366
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,875
Yuri disappeared!

367
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,833
He was taken over
by that evil energy.

368
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,666
And then it possessed
a symbol of evil

369
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,291
to gain a more destructive
physical form.

370
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,625
[PRECHT]
Wait.

371
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,666
Are you saying that Yuri
is inside of that dragon?

372
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,333
[MAVIS]
Yes. I'm sure of it.

373
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,916
That dragon is gonna
demolish the entire city!

374
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,416
What's going to happen to Yuri?

375
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,583
[ZERA]
Mavis!

376
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,666
Wait, Mavis,
where are you going?

377
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:03,458
Yuri! Can you hear me?

378
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,375
[roars]

379
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,500
[MAVIS] You have to stop this!
You're hurting innocent people!

380
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,250
We came to protect them!

381
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:13,083
Think about how many
lives are at stake!

382
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,666
[roars]

383
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,833
Please, Yuri!

384
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,541
I know deep inside
you're a good person who

385
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,375
wouldn't hurt anybody.

386
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:27,916
Yuri! You have to stop
and listen to me!

387
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,166
You can't be so reckless!

388
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:40,958
[MAVIS gasps]

389
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,666
You just saved my life!

390
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,333
[PRECHT]
That thing is not Yuri.

391
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,458
It's a monster and a
threat to everyone here.

392
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,500
Our only choice
is to use our magic.

393
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,375
To kill it before it kills us.

394
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:52,750
You're wrong.

395
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,833
I know Yuri is still in there.

396
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,958
I'll save him. And the city.

397
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,500
But nobody is gonna die today.

398
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,583
[PRECHT]
How? That's impossible.

399
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,666
I just need to get as
close to him as I can.

400
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,958
[PRECHT]
It's too dangerous!

401
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:11,208
Walking hand-in-hand
with danger, without fear,

402
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,583
isn't that the treasure
hunter way?

403
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,250
[PRECHT] But you aren't
a treasure hunter!

404
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,291
[MAVIS]
I am.

405
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:24,000
I've looked... for so long.

406
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,375
My treasure... is right here.

407
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,541
And it's more valuable
than anything else.

408
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:31,708
The friends I've made
mean everything to me.

409
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:33,958
[roars]

410
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:37,333
So I can't let Yuri be
taken. No matter what.

411
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,166
Because what I treasure
most in the world

412
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,708
are the people
closest to my heart.

413
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:15,000
[MAVIS] After his greed
got the better of him,

414
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:18,083
Yuri fell under the horrible
curse of the Tenrou Orb.

415
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,458
His spirit has fused with
the giant bone dragon

416
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:22,833
and he'll destroy the city
if we can't stop him.

417
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:24,583
But I'm gonna save him.

418
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,541
I have to get through
to him somehow.

419
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:28,000
The others may have
abandoned hope,

420
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:29,833
but I'm not that kind of person.

421
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:31,166
This won't be easy.

422
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,333
To pull this off I'm going
to have to risk it all.

423
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:34,833
I'll have to use
an ancient spell,

424
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:36,833
the most powerful one yet.

425
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:39,333
Next Time: "Law."

426
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:41,958
A white spell of
absolute justice.
