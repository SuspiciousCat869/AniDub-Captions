- Natsu:
PREVIOUSLY ON "FAIRY TAIL"...

2
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:22,041
- Happy: HEY, LUCY.
SINCE YOUR DAD'S A TYCOON,

3
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:24,375
YOU MUST HAVE HAD A LOT
OF MONEY GROWING UP, HUH?

4
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:25,916
- Natsu: I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU LEFT ALL OF THAT BEHIND.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,666
- Lucy: WHY ARE YOU GUYS
BRINGING THIS UP NOW?

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,875
- Happy: I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT ALL THE FANCY FOOD

7
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:32,375
YOU MUST HAVE HAD.
- Natsu: OH!  WHAT I WOULDN'T DO

8
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,208
FOR SOME FANCY FOOD!
- YOU PROBABLY ATE FISH

9
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:35,250
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD!

10
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,916
- Lucy: AGAIN WITH THE FOOD!

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,958
- ( theme music playing )

12
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,458

- Narrator:
ONE DAY AT DUSK

15
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,208
IN THE TOWN OF MAGNOLIA,

16
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:14,583
A DISHEVELED MAN ARRIVED--

17
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,833
A TRAVELER ON HIS OWN.

18
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:24,041
- Happy: MMM..
- ( Lucy sighs )

19
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,250
- Gray: I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW QUIET IT'S BEEN TODAY.

20
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,208
- Mira: IT'S KINDA NICE TO HAVE
A SLOW DAY

21
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,208
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

22
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,500
IT CAN GET
A LITTLE LONELY, THOUGH.

23
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:34,500
- MAN, I COULD HAVE FOUND
THAT TREASURE.

24
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,916
IF ONLY I'D HAD VIRGO THERE
TO HELP ME.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,041
- GET OVER IT ALREADY!

26
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,916
- YEAH, WOULD YOU JUST 
FORGET ABOUT THAT JUNK,

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,291
AND LET US TRY TO FIND
A REAL JOB?

28
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,875
- JEEZ!  IT'S TREASURE,
NOT JUNK.

29
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:49,875
- ( sighs ) I'M NEVER GONNA
BE ABLE TO COVER MY RENT.

30
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:53,250
- HMM, LET'S GO FIND A JOB.

31
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,666
- ( gasps )

32
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,666
- WHOA, YOU SURE CHANGED YOUR
MIND QUICK ON THAT ONE.

33
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,083
- UH, UH...
- HMM?

34
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,291
- SERIOUSLY?
YOU WANNA GET BACK TO WORK?

35
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,500
YOU MEAN IT?!
OH!

36
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,708
THANK YOU, NATSU!

37
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,083
- LOOK, I WASN'T TRYING
 TO BE LAZY OR NOTHING.

38
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,791
I WAS JUST WAITING
FOR THE PERFECT JOB.

39
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,541
RIGHT, LITTLE BUDDY?
- Happy: AYE!

40
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,916
- ( exhales )

41
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:19,458
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU OKAY?

42
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,375
- HMM...

43
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,208
- ( Happy speaking )

44
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,708
- ( Happy exhales )
- ( Natsu groans ) 

45
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,791
- IT MIGHT BE MY IMAGINATION,

46
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,583
BUT LATELY I'VE BEEN GETTING
THIS SUPER-CREEPY FEELING

47
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,625
THAT SOMEBODY'S WATCHING ME.

48
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,458
- WHAT DO YOU THINK? IS THERE A
TERM FOR LUCY'S CONDITION?

49
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,125
- I THINK THAT IT'S A TEXTBOOK
CASE OF AN EXCESSIVE EGO.

50
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,541
- DON'T BE STUPID.

51
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,208
IT'S NOT LIKE
I WANNA BE STALKED.

52
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,791
I SAID IT'S JUST
MY IMAGINATION. 

53
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,416
- NATSU AND LUCY ARE SO CUTE.

54
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,666
THEY'RE REALLY CLOSE NOW.

55
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,333
- Gray: YEAH...

56
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:56,000
- I GOTTA RUN.

57
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,000
- SO TOMORROW AT NOON.
WE'LL SEE YOU THEN.

58
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,958
- SEE YOU!
- YOU BETCHA.

59
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,958
♪ TOMORROW'S GONNA BE
A DAY OF GLEE ♪

60
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:14,208
♪ FINALLY SOME WORK FOR ME. ♪

61
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,833
- YOU'RE GONNA FALL IN
ONE OF THESE DAYS, LUCY.

62
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,833
- DON'T WORRY.
I'M FINE.

63
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,791
I WONDER WHAT
I SHOULD WEAR TOMORROW.

64
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,875
- BE CAREFUL ON YOUR WAY HOME.

65
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,458
- THANKS!  I WILL!

66
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,500
AAH!

67
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,375
IT WASN'T JUST MY IMAGINATION.

68
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,625
THERE IS SOMEONE WATCHING ME.

69
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,666
OH, CRAP!
NOW HE'S FOLLOWING ME.

70
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,500
( panting )

71
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,875
GUESS HE'S GONE.

72
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,083
( exhales )

73
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,291
- LUCY.
- ( screams )

74
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,791
LEAVE ME ALONE!

75
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,041
- THERE'S NO NEED 
TO GET HYSTERICAL.

76
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,500
IT'S YOUR FATHER.

77
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,333
- ( slightly gasps )

78
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,750
BUT--

79
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,250
- ( inaudible )

80
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,166
- HUH?

81
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,208
UH--

82
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,250
IT REALLY IS YOU.

83
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,041
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

84
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:52,625
AND WHAT'S WITH THE BEARD
AND TATTERED CLOTHING?

85
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,000
- HEARTFILIA RAILWAYS

86
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,500
WAS RECENTLY BOUGHT OUT
FROM UNDER ME.

87
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,125
WHICH MEANS...

88
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,916
I'VE LOST EVERYTHING I OWN--
THE COMPANY,

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,125
THE ESTATE AND ALL MY MONEY.

90
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,125
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

91
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,583
- I'M AFRAID SO.

92
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,375
I HAD PUT UP
MY ENTIRE FORTUNE

93
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,583
AS COLLATERAL.

94
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,708
I SPENT ALL THOSE YEARS

95
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,333
WORKING MY TAIL OFF TO MAKE
THAT BUSINESS SUCCESSFUL,

96
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,291
AND THIS IS THE THANKS
I GET?

97
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,541
- WHAT?  THE HOUSE?  NO!

98
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,125
WHAT ABOUT MOM'S GRAVE?

99
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,250
DON'T WORRY.
I HAD IT MOVED HERE.

100
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:34,083
I WOULD BE
COMPLETELY HEARTBROKEN...

101
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,791
IF I DIDN'T FIND IT
SO FUNNY.

102
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,541
TO THINK THAT SO MUCH WEALTH

103
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,333
COULD DISAPPEAR IN
THE BLINK OF AN EYE...

104
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:44,333
ALL MY YEARS' WORK
WERE RUINED IN THE TIME SPAN

105
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,958
OF A SINGLE EVENING.

106
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,291
IT WENT UP IN SMOKE.

107
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,291
I PUSHED MY OWN FAMILY ASIDE
FOR THAT FORTUNE.

108
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,291
AND NOW IT'S GONE?

109
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,291
ISN'T THAT RIDICULOUS?

110
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,333
I CAN'T HELP BUT LAUGH!

111
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,750
( laughing )

112
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,416
- WHY DID YOU
COME HERE, FATHER?

113
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:07,916
- I JUST WANTED TO SEE
MY PRECIOUS DAUGHTER AGAIN.

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,750
- BUT WHY NOW,
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED?

115
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,750
YOU BETTER NOT HAVE COME HERE
TO MESS WITH FAIRY TAIL,

116
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,416
'CAUSE I WARNED YOU NOT TO.

117
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,375
- I DON'T HAVE THE POWER TO MESS
WITH ANYONE ANYMORE, MY DEAR.

118
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:25,083
HONESTLY, I ONLY CAME HERE
SO THAT I COULD SEE YOU.

119
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,291
PLEASE DON'T GIVE ME
THAT LOOK.

120
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,291
I'M TRULY SORRY
ABOUT THE WAY I TREATED YOU

121
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:31,541
WHEN YOU CAME TO SEE ME.

122
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,416
I WON'T BE HERE LONG.

123
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,666
I'M JUST PASSING THROUGH
ON MY WAY TO ACALYPHA.

124
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,125
I'M GOING TO WORK
AT THE MERCHANT GUILD THERE.

125
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,250
I'VE DECIDED I'M GOING
TO START OVER AGAIN.

126
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,791
- HMM?  ACALYPHA?

127
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:48,000
- YES, IT'S JUST A FEW TOWNS
WEST OF HERE.

128
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,833
- OH.

129
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,166
- I DO HAVE A FAVOR TO ASK.

130
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,041
I NEED MONEY

131
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,625
IN ORDER TO PAY
FOR MY TRAVELS.

132
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,666
- ( slightly gasps )

133
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,958
- WOULD YOU MIND
LENDING ME A LITTLE BIT?

134
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,416
ALL I NEED IS 
100,000 JEWEL.

135
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,875
- FATHER, I'M REALLY SORRY,

136
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,750
BUT I DON'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF MONEY.

137
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,750
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
 A MEASLY 100,000?

138
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,750
YOU'RE MY DAUGHTER.
THE LEAST YOU COULD DO

139
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,125
IS LEND IT TO ME.
I NEED IT TO START OVER.

140
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,583
- I'M SORRY.
BUT I DON'T HAVE IT.

141
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:19,041
- I NEED MONEY! I'M SWALLOWING
MY PRIDE AND BEGGING YOU FOR IT,

142
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,708
DON'T LET ME DOWN, LUCY.

143
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,291
HELP ME OUT THIS ONCE,

144
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,291
AND I'LL NEVER ASK YOU AGAIN.

145
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,250
- ( inaudible )

146
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,666
- YOU CAN BEG ALL YOU WANT;
IT WON'T DO ANY GOOD.

147
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,791
- HOW COULD YOU DENY ME?!

148
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,083
AFTER ALL I SPENT ON YOU?!

149
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,208
- I NEVER...

150
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,875
EVER ASKED YOU FOR MONEY.

151
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,125
FANCY DRESSES AND HOUSES!

152
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,583
THEY DON'T MATTER TO ME.

153
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:51,208
'CAUSE I DON'T NEED MONEY
TO BE HAPPY.

154
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:55,291
THERE'S ONE THING ABOUT MONEY
YOU NEVER FIGURED OUT.

155
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:58,375
IT CAN BUY YOU EVERYTHING,
BUT HAPPINESS.

156
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,708
- LUCY!

157
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:00,666
- GO AWAY!

158
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:18,125
I CAN'T BELIEVE HIM.
HE'S SUCH A HORRIBLE MAN.

159
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,208
- ALL CLEAR ON YOUR END,
SERGEANT HAPPY?

160
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,166
- AYE AYE, CAPTAIN NATSU!

161
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,250
- YO.  WELCOME HOME.

162
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,625
- WE'RE HAPPY TO REPORT
THAT NO SUSPICIOUS INDIVIDUALS

163
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:37,583
HAVE BEEN DETECTED.

164
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,458
- THANKS, YOU GUYS.

165
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,333
- CAPTAIN! IT APPEARS THE BUCK
PRIVATE IS A PARTY POOPER, SIR!

166
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,333
- HOW DID I END UP
BEING A PRIVATE?

167
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,583
- ( laughs )
WELL, YOU ARE STILL A NEWBIE.

168
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,208
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?
YOU LOOK UPSET.

169
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,750
- Natsu and Happy:
HUH?

170
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,875
- IS THAT HIM?

171
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,500
- CAPTAIN, SIR!
WE'VE GOT A CREEPER OVER HERE.

172
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,666
- I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM!
- ( grunts )

173
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,083
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

174
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,166
- MAN, WHAT THE HECK
 ARE YOU DOING HERE?

175
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,500
- IT WAS GRAY?

176
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,333
- I NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
YOU'D BE THE PERV

177
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,541
WHO'S STALKING LUCY.

178
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,291
- WAIT, YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG!
- CALM DOWN.

179
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,041
I OVERHEARD HER SAY
THAT SHE FELT LIKE 

180
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,083
SOMEONE WAS WATCHING HER,
SO I FOLLOWED HER TO MAKE SURE

181
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,500
SHE GOT HOME SAFE.

182
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,833
JEEZ, I WAS JUST LOOKING
OUT FOR A FRIEND.

183
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,083
- YOU LOVE HER, DON'T YOU?

184
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,208
- WATCH IT OR I'LL PUNCH
YOUR FACE IN, CAT!

185
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,375
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER REALLY
LIKED YOU THAT MUCH,

186
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,791
BUT NOW I'VE LOST
ALL RESPECT FOR YOU.

187
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,458
- WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT?

188
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,416
- I'VE ALWAYS SUSPECTED
YOU MIGHT BE A PERVERT,

189
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,958
'CAUSE YOU WALK AROUND
HALF-NAKED,

190
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,000
BUT NOW THAT YOU'RE STALKING
CUTE GIRLS,

191
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,083
I'M ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE!

192
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,250
- ( Gray grunts )
- AAH!

193
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,541
- I WASN'T STALKING HER!

194
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,125
I WAS LOOKING OUT FOR HER!

195
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,958
- WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE
SOMEONE'S IN DENIAL.

196
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,333
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
YOU WANT A PIECE OF ME,

197
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,166
YOU FIERY MOUTH BREATHER?!

198
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,083
- YOU'RE JUST MAD THAT
YOU'VE BEEN CAUGHT RED-HANDED,

199
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,583
YOU PERVY POPSICLE.

200
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,791
- CAN'T YOU GUYS
TAKE THIS FIGHT SOMEWHERE ELSE?!

201
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,083
PLEASE!

202
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,666
- ( guys grunting )

203
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,125
- ( laughs )

204
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,416
- HEY, LUCY,
IT'S TIME FOR US TO GO TO WORK!

205
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,875
- COME ON, LET'S GO!

206
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,583
- YEAH.

207
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,125
- SO, WHAT KINDA JOB
ARE WE TAKING ON?

208
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,583
- I DON'T KNOW.

209
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,333
- HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?
- ( maniacal laughter )

210
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,708
- IT'S CATCHING AN ESCAPED
CONVICT NAMED VELVENO.

211
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,333
- HEY, I'VE HEARD
THAT NAME BEFORE.

212
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,041
HE'S ALSO CALLED 
THE GUILD HUNTER.

213
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,833
WOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE'S ON THE LOOSE.

214
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:26,458
- HA-HA-HA!  RUMOR HAS IT
HIS MAGIC IS WAY AWESOME!

215
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,166
I AM FIRED UP!

216
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,000
- THE REWARD SPLITS UP TO
400,000 JEWEL EACH.

217
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,416
THAT SHOULD TAKE CARE OF
YOUR RENT FOR A WHILE.

218
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,416
- MM-HMM.
LIKE THE NEXT SIX MONTHS.

219
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,083
YOU CAN COUNT ME IN.

220
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,291
- HEY, DID YOU HEAR ABOUT 
WHAT HAPPENED IN ACALYPHA?

221
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,541
- WELL, I HEARD SOMEONE SAYING
THAT THEIR MERCHANT GUILD

222
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,791
WAS TAKEN OVER BY
A GANG OF THUGS.

223
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,958
TALK ABOUT SCARY, HUH?

224
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,041
- ACALYPHA?

225
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,666
- YEAH, BUT EVIDENTLY, IT'S NOT
JUST ANY OLD GANG OF THUGS.

226
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,916
IT'S A DARK GUILD
CALLED NAKED MUMMY.

227
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,541
- SERIOUSLY?  THE ARMY
DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE

228
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,291
AGAINST A BUNCH
OF RENEGADE WIZARDS.

229
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,291
- Mira: IT WORRIES ME
THAT THE DARK GUILDS SEEM

230
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,375
TO HAVE BECOME
MUCH MORE ACTIVE LATELY.

231
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,041
- Macao:
YEAH, THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.

232
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,833
- I'M JUST PASSING THROUGH
ON MY WAY TO ACALYPHA.

233
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,125
I'M GOING TO WORK
AT THE MERCHANT GUILD.

234
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:13,708
- FATHER.

235
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,875
I SHOULDN'T EVEN CARE.

236
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,083
NOT AFTER WHAT HE DID.

237
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:24,083
AND THE WAY HE TREATED ME.

238
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,208
( gasps )

239
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,666
WHERE IS ACALYPHA?!
TELL ME!

240
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,083
- OKAY!  READY, LUCY?
UH?

241
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,083
- IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
SHE'S HERE.

242
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,708
I WONDER WHERE
SHE COULD HAVE GONE.

243
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,500
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

244
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,500
- I MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO STAND HIM,

245
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,500
BUT EVEN SO,
HE'S MY FATHER

246
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,291
AND I HAVE TO SAVE HIM!

247
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,833
- ( crowd clamoring )

248
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,916
- Narrator: THIS IS THE LOVE
AND LUCKY MERCHANT GUILD

249
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
IN THE TOWN OF ACALYPHA.

250
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,000
- HEY, WHY AREN'T YOU GUYS
STORMING THE PLACE?!

251
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,833
- PLEASE RESCUE THE HOSTAGES.

252
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,666
MY POOR HUSBAND
IS STILL IN THERE.

253
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,583
- TRY TO REMAIN CALM, EVERYONE.

254
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,916
WE'VE CONTACTED A NEARBY
MAGICAL GUILD,

255
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,541
AND ASKED FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE.

256
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,000
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS
FOR YOU TO STAY HERE.

257
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,666
PLEASE VACATE THE AREA.
- FATHER...

258
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,875
- COME ON!  CAN'T YOU JUST
BUST IN THERE AND SAVE THEM?

259
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,208
- AAH!

260
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,833
- HOLD IT!
CIVILIANS AREN'T ALLOWED

261
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,833
PAST THIS POINT.
- MY DAD'S IN THERE!

262
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,708
WELL, I'M NOT SURE,
BUT I THINK HE IS. 

263
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:27,875
- WHAT DID I SAY?!

264
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,291
- ( chuckles )

265
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,708
AAH!
- NO WAY!

266
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,833
TRY IT AGAIN,
AND I'LL ARREST YOU!

267
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,583
- ( blows raspberry )

268
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,416
THERE'S GOTTA BE A WAY
TO GET INSIDE.

269
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,500
THINK HARD, LUCY.

270
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,333
THAT'S IT!

271
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,833
NOW OPEN!
GATE OF THE MAIDEN!

272
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,416
VIRGO!

273
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,916
- PRINCESS, DO YOU WISH
TO PUNISH ME?

274
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,208
- WHAT'S WITH YOU?!

275
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,666
NO.  I NEED YOUR HELP
WITH SOMETHING.

276
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,750
- PRINCESS...
- ( gasps )

277
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,500
AAH!

278
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,708
- ...I SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM
DRILLING A PASSAGEWAY

279
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,041
LEADING INTO THE BUILDING.

280
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,458
- I KNEW I COULD
COUNT ON YOU.

281
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,875
- ARE YOU GOING
TO PUNISH ME NOW?

282
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,458
- YOU'RE STARTING
 TO CREEP ME OUT.

283
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:22,875
- WHAT ABOUT
ALL THE WIZARDS INSIDE?

284
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,500
THERE APPEARS TO BE
QUITE A FEW.

285
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,750
ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN
HANDLE THEM ALL ON YOUR OWN?

286
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,041
- I DON'T HAVE
MUCH OF A CHOICE.

287
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,416
HERE GOES.

288
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,000
- ( groans )

289
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,000
- YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

290
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,083
I THOUGHT A MERCHANT GUILD
WOULD HAVE MORE MONEY

291
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,833
THAN THIS SILLY CHUMP CHANGE.

292
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,291
- I TOLD YOU THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

293
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,291
WE SHOULD HAVE JUST
ROBBED A BANK INSTEAD.

294
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:51,708
- JUST SHUT YOUR TRAPS!

295
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,666
HURRY AND LOAD UP THE DOUGH
BEFORE THE ARMY

296
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,958
DECIDES TO BARGE IN HERE!

297
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,958
- ( hostages murmuring )

298
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,666
- YOU BETTER QUIT
YOUR YAPPING OR ELSE!

299
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,500
WHAT?

300
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:07,166
EH, YOU GOT AN ITCH
ON YOUR BUTT OR SOMETHING?

301
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,041
- ( whimpering )

302
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,375
- IF YOU GUYS HAD JUST
GIVEN US THE MONEY

303
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:13,750
WHEN WE ASKED FOR IT,

304
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,916
THIS WHOLE THING
WOULD BE OVER BY NOW!

305
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,458
- DON'T DO NOTHING STUPID, BOSS!

306
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,875
- YOU IDIOTS ARE GONNA WISH

307
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,958
YOU NEVER MESSED WITH ME!

308
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,291
( shouts )

309
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,833
- Lucy: TAURUS!
- MOO!

310
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,541
WHAT AN UTTERLY
DESPICABLE MOO-VE.

311
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,375
- WHAT THE HECK?
- A COW?

312
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:33,833
- THE CELESTIAL SPIRIT.

313
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,375
- BUT WHAT'S IT DOING HERE?

314
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,208
- AND HOW'D IT GET
INSIDE THE BUILDING?

315
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,875
- ( all murmuring )

316
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,500
- FUN'S OVER, BOYS.

317
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,083
- WHAT THE--?
- A CHICK?

318
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,583
- A WIZARD FROM
AN OFFICIAL GUILD?

319
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:45,583
CRAP!

320
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,041
- YOU BETTER START BEHAVING,

321
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,250
OR YOU'RE GONNA GET HURT.

322
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,208
CANCER!

323
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:55,666
- I SHARPENED MY PINCERS
 FOR THE OCCASION, BABY.

324
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,166
- ( all scream )

325
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,833
- SAGITTARIUS!

326
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,583
- I'LL TAKE THEM
DOWN-DIDDLY-OWN.

327
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,125
- ( screaming )

328
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,333
- AAH.

329
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,708
- ( all murmuring )

330
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,750
- NOW THE FINAL BLOW!

331
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,500
- Guys: I WONDER WHAT KIND
OF MAGIC SHE'S GONNA USE NEXT!

332
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,958
- AAH!

333
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,958
- LUCY!  KICK!

334
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,000
- ( guys shout )

335
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,416
- KICK!
( echoing )

336
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,625
- ( hostages gasp )

337
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,791
- JUST LIKE TAKING CANDY
FROM A BABY.

338
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,291
- ( all cheering )

339
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,625
- LET'S GET 'EM!

340
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,125
- Army: YES, SIR!

341
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,291
- ( chattering and cheering )

342
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,916
- I DID IT!  ME!

343
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,916
ALONE.

344
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,875
FATHER.

345
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,541
- HEY, THANKS FOR SAVING US.

346
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,458
- YEAH, THANK YOU, MISS.
- UH, SURE.

347
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,250
- YOUR MAGIC IS AMAZING.

348
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,916
- ON BEHALF OF THE
OTHER SOLDIERS...

349
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,833
I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU AS WELL.

350
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,625
- ( cheers and applause )

351
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,375
- FATHER...

352
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,208
WHERE ARE YOU?
- ARE YOU A FAIRY TAIL WIZARD?

353
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,083
- UH, YEAH, I AM.

354
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,791
- SERIOUSLY?  THAT'S AWESOME.

355
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,583
YOU'RE LIKE
THE COOLEST WIZARD EVER.

356
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:07,166
- ( chatter continues )

357
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,333
- I DON'T SEE HIM ANYWHERE.

358
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,916
WHAT IF SOMETHING'S
HAPPENED TO HIM?

359
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,916
WHERE ARE YOU, DAD?!

360
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,666
- ( footsteps approaching )
- LUCY?

361
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,541
- UH...

362
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,708
AAH...

363
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:35,541
NO.  DON'T TELL ME
THAT YOU...

364
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,000
JUST MADE IT INTO TOWN.

365
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,375
THERE'S NO WAY.

366
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,500
- YES, IT TOOK ME
A WHILE TO GET HERE.

367
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,500
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY,
SO I HAD TO WALK.

368
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,333
- WAIT.  HE WANTED
TO BORROW 100,000 JEWEL

369
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,125
FROM ME FOR TRAVEL EXPENSES?!
HE'S INSANE!

370
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,958
THAT'S A HUGE PRICE TAG
FOR SUCH A SHORT TRIP! 

371
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,750
- WHAT BRINGS YOU TO
ACALYPHA, MY DEAR?

372
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,375
- I WAS WORRIED. I KNEW YOU WERE
HEADED TO THIS MERCHANT GUILD.

373
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,000
AND I HEARD
IT HAD BEEN ATTACKED.

374
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,583
- HMM?

375
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,458
- THERE'S NO NEED TO WORRY.

376
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:02,916
EVERYONE INSIDE IS SAFE NOW.

377
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,750
SOME OF THE WIZARDS
HAVE ESCAPED.

378
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,583
- YOU CAME ALL THIS WAY, BECAUSE
YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT ME?

379
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,041
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.
WELL, SEE YOU.

380
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,208
- IT DOES MATTER.

381
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,375
THANK YOU, LUCY.

382
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,458
- LET'S GET ONE THING STRAIGHT.

383
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,000
JUST 'CAUSE I WAS 
WORRIED ABOUT YOU,

384
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,750
DOESN'T MEAN THAT
I'VE FORGIVEN YOU, OKAY?

385
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,000
- RIGHT.  I KNOW THAT.

386
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,166
CAN'T SAY I BLAME YOU.

387
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,875
THE WALK HERE FROM MAGNOLIA

388
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,958
WAS DEFINITELY A LONG ONE.

389
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,875
I FOUND MYSELF WITH
PLENTY OF TIME

390
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,000
TO THINK ABOUT MY ACTIONS.

391
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:43,916
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE WAY
I ACTED YESTERDAY.

392
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,583
I WASN'T IN MY RIGHT MIND.

393
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,083
I WISH I COULD TAKE BACK
EVERYTHING I SAID.

394
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,041
I REALLY DO.

395
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,041
I PROMISE YOU
I'M GOING TO CHANGE.

396
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:55,416
I MANAGED TO MAKE IT HERE
WITHOUT USING ANY MONEY AT ALL.

397
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,250
I'M LEARNING...

398
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,875
TO LIVE MY LIFE WITHOUT IT.

399
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:03,083
THIS MERCHANT GUILD...

400
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,458
HOLDS A GREAT DEAL 
OF MEMORIES FOR ME.

401
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:08,083
ACTUALLY, THIS IS THE SPOT
WHERE I FIRST MET YOUR MOTHER.

402
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,708
- ( slightly gasps )

403
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,916
- AFTER WE WERE MARRIED
AND SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH YOU,

404
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,750
I DECIDED THAT I WAS READY TO 
TRY AND START MY OWN BUSINESS.

405
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,791
WE LEFT THE GUILD
SO I COULD PURSUE

406
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,791
MY ENTREPRENEURIAL DREAMS.

407
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,500
WHEN WE WERE LEAVING,
WE NOTICED THE GUILD'S SIGN

408
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:24,833
HAD LOST ITS "K."

409
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,458
THE WORD "LUCKY"
HAD BECOME "LUCY."

410
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,791
WE THOUGHT IT WAS
THE FUNNIEST THING.

411
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:35,208
AT THAT MOMENT, WE DECIDED 
THAT IF WE HAD A BABY GIRL,

412
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,583
WE WOULD NAME HER LUCY.

413
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,541
- GIVE ME A BREAK.

414
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:49,375
WHAT KINDA PARENTS NAME
THEIR KID AFTER A BROKEN SIGN?

415
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:54,750
- WELL, I SUPPOSE
NOT THE BEST PARENTS.

416
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,458
YOU KNOW,
I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME HERE.

417
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:02,458
I FINALLY GOT TO MEET THE "PLAIN
OLD LUCY" YOU'VE TOLD ME ABOUT.

418
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,708
I MUST SAY,
SHE'S A MUCH STRONGER WOMAN

419
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,916
THAN "LUCKY LUCY HEARTFILIA"
COULD EVER HOPE TO BE.

420
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,916
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

421
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,416
- THANK YOU, DAD.

422
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,000
EH?  AAH!

423
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,500
- THERE YOU ARE!
YOU OKAY?!

424
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,416
- YOU HAD US WORRIED SICK!
- Happy: LUCY!

425
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,791
- ( murmurs )

426
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:25,791
- YOU WERE ABLE TO DIFFUSE 
THIS SITUATION BY YOURSELF?

427
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,333
COLOR ME IMPRESSED.

428
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,625
- WELL, THANKS, BUT--

429
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,000
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, DAD!

430
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,458
- YOU WANNA EXPLAIN WHY
YOU DITCHED US LIKE THAT?

431
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,458
- ( giggles )
IT WAS NO BIG DEAL.

432
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,541
- YEAH, RIGHT!
"NO BIG DEAL," MY BUTT!

433
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,375
- Happy: I HOPE YOU KNOW WE HAD
TO CANCEL OUR JOB 'CAUSE OF YOU!

434
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,083
- YEAH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

435
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,041
- DEAREST LAYLA...

436
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:00,250
I HOPE YOU CAN FORGIVE ME.

437
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,416
I'VE BEEN SUCH A FOOL.

438
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,916
- ( blows landing )
- AAH!

439
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,625
- Narrator: MEANWHILE,
AT THE HEADQUARTERS OF

440
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,875
THE NAKED MUMMY DARK GUILD...

441
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:17,500
- ( blows landing )

442
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,208
- NOW WHY DON'T YOU GOT
THE MONEY?

443
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,625
- I TRIED TO GET IT FOR YOU!

444
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:25,250
WE GOT SIDETRACKED BY A WIZARD
FROM AN OFFICIAL GUILD

445
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,416
WHO SHOWED UP, AND WE BARELY
MADE IT OUT OF THERE

446
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,583
WITH OUR LIVES!

447
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,833
- UH-HUH?

448
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:36,458
NOW WHY DON'T YOU
GOT THE MONEY?

449
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,250
- ( laughs )

450
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:41,041
DO YOU EVEN REALIZE
YOU KEEP REPEATING YOURSELF?

451
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,375
IF HE SAYS
HE DON'T HAVE IT,

452
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,375
HE DON'T HAVE IT,
BIG BRO GATOU.

453
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,375
- LAUGH ALL YOU WANT,
BUT THERE'S NOTHING FUNNY

454
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,375
ABOUT THIS, BIG BRO ZATOU.

455
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:51,000
WE GOTTA PAY ORACION SEIS
THEIR PROTECTION MONEY

456
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,333
BEFORE THE DEADLINE.

457
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,416
SO YOU CAN LAUGH
ALL YOU WANT,

458
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,916
BUT I'M TELLING YOU, THERE'S
NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT THIS.

459
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,166
- ( laughs )

460
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,541
THERE YOU GO AGAIN.
YOU CRACK ME UP.

461
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,833
- I'D TELL THEM THE BIG BRO
SCHTICK IS GETTING OLD,

462
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,166
BUT THEY SCARE ME.

463
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,000
- THERE AIN'T A SINGLE
DARK GUILD

464
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,500
IN THE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD

465
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,875
WHO'D EVER GO AGAINST
THE ORACION SEIS.

466
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,375
YOU KNOW, THERE AIN'T
A SINGLE DARK--

467
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:11,958
- I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME!

468
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,958
I GET THE FEELING THOSE GUYS
ARE UP TO SOMETHING,

469
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,958
AND I BET YOU IT AIN'T
GONNA BE GOOD.

470
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:19,375
WHY ELSE WOULD THEY SUDDENLY
RAISE THEIR PROTECTION FEES?

471
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:23,458
- ( thunder cracks )

472
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,041
- I CAN HEAR IT.

473
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:30,250
THE SOUND OF THE TIMES CHANGING.

474
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,416
THE SOUND OF EYES OPENING.

475
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,041
IT'S THE SOUND
OF A NEW BEGINNING.

476
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:38,000
THE BREAKING OF THE LIGHT!

477
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:44,958
- ( end theme playing )

478
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:52,083
- ( singing in Japanese )

479
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:14,333
- Happy: HEY, NATSU!
THE MASTER'S BEEN

480
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:16,000
LOOKING ALL OVER FOR YOU.

481
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:17,625
HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT TAKING ON

482
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:18,916
AN IMPORTANT JOB.
- OH, YEAH?

483
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,666
SOUNDS SERIOUS.
I WONDER WHAT IT IS.

484
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,666
- I ASKED HIM, AND HE SAID
HE WANTS US TO TEAM UP

485
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,791
WITH SOME OTHER MAGICAL GUILDS
IN ORDER TO TAKE DOWN

486
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:27,791
AN EVIL DARK GUILD.
- MAN, THAT'S GONNA BE TOUGH.

487
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:30,500
COUNT ME IN.
I'M ALL FIRED UP!

488
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:33,083
- ( Happy and Natsu speaking )

489
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:35,208
- Natsu: WHAT'S IT GONNA BE LIKE
WORKING WITH OTHER GUILDS?

490
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:36,708
- Happy:
A NON-STOP THRILL RIDE

491
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:39,708
FILLED WITH INTRIGUE,
SUSPENSE AND ROMANCE.

492
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:41,500
- THIS AIN'T A SOAP OPERA,
LITTLE BUDDY.
