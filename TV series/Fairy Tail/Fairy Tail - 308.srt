[INVEL]
Etherious Natsu Dragneel.

2
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:26,708
He is the mightiest demon
of the Books of Zeref.

3
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,291
[INVEL] Which means,
he's your ultimate foe.

4
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,500
Here's the deal.

5
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,625
If you decide to stand
in our way like that,

6
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,666
we'll take you out, too.

7
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,125
Brandish, stand down.
You have to.

8
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,958
This is so annoying.

[NATSU grunts]

00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:28,000
Wha--? Ow.

11
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,083
What's the matter?

12
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,583
Natsu! What's wrong?

13
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:44,250
[NATSU groaning]

14
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:47,291
What's happening? It hurts.

15
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,958
It'll be okay. Hang on.

16
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,208
Natsu!

17
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,791
[HAPPY]
Oh, no!

18
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,916
You haven't already
forgotten that I'm the one

19
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,375
who shrunk his tumor, have you?

20
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,750
I can't even hear
his heart beating.

21
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,833
I fear it's an
anti-ether-nano tumor.

22
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,583
Let me use my magic.

23
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,333
I can change the size
of anything I want.

24
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:15,458
So if I know the exact
location of his tumor,

25
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:19,208
I can make it small enough
that it never poses any risk.

26
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,916
[BRANDISH]
I simply un-shrunk it.

27
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,875
But why would you do that?

28
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,000
[BRANDISH]
Seriously?

29
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:29,583
Because he's standing in the way
of the Empire's mission.

30
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:30,916
You gotta stop this!

31
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,416
Can't you see how
much he's suffering?

32
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
[BRANDISH]
That's the fate of our enemies.

33
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,958
There's no need for this.

34
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,666
We really don't have to fight
each other, you know?

35
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,041
[BRANDISH] Maybe that was
the case for our mothers,

36
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,958
but you and I grew up
with an ocean between us.

37
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,416
We come from two different
sides of the world,

38
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,666
and have completely
different objectives.

39
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,875
Although it's true I don't
hold a personal grudge

40
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,166
against you anymore,

41
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,041
my duty to the empire
puts us at odds.

42
00:03:57,125 --> 00:04:00,500
So what in the hell am I
supposed to do about it, Lucy?

43
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:09,000
The only real option I have left
is to set my doubts aside...

44
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,583
...and end this.

45
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,416
If I win this fight,

46
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,458
I want you to promise
you'll heal Natsu again.

47
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,250
You've got the wrong idea, Lucy.

48
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,666
When I say "end this,"

49
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,541
I don't mean that we're
gonna fight each other

50
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,083
to settle the score.

51
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,541
I mean, I'm going to end the
internal conflict I'm feeling,

52
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,583
and to do that, I'm afraid
I'll have to kill you.

53
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:36,416
[HAPPY]
Her magic power is crazy.

54
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,041
[BRANDISH]
Besides, if you really believe

55
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,750
you have a chance at beating me,

56
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,375
you're more delusional
than I thought.

57
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:44,333
You still better promise me!

58
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,666
Yeah, sure, whatever.

59
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,375
You could never win anyway!

60
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,958

00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:59,125
All right, then.

00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,458
Go, Scorpio!

00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,875

more irritating like this!

So awesome!

00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,875
That spell makes
the ground swell

84
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,625
and surge like ocean waves.

different level than you!

There's a reason why
I'm one of the Twelve!

way stronger than me!

But no matter what,
I can't afford to lose!

could be friends instead.

What are you talking about?

109
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,458
This whole thing's a farce.

110
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,208
She never had any
intention of killing

111
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,791
you or your friends from
the very beginning.

112
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,541
I mean, it's completely obvious.

Reverting his tumor
back to how it was?

115
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,875
It would have been just as easy
for you to make his innards

116
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:37,666
start expanding until
he popped like a balloon.

117
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,625
And then, once you
shrunk the girl,

118
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,583
you could've stomped
her like a grape.

119
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,083
But you made the choice not to.

120
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,000
[DIMARIA]
You knew I was watching,

121
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,125
so you were planning
on pretending to lose

122
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,458
to this weak little girl.

123
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,666
Well, you won't have to pretend.

124
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,166
I'll end you... right now!

125
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,416

I couldn't even see it.

Randi was perfect,

I know it was you.

I'll take my time!

I don't believe that the
process of stripping somebody

ever taken this long before.

[IRENE]
May I ask the reason?

142
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,875
So I can speak with
Mavis one last time.

Alone.

It's awfully late for that.
Having second thoughts, are we?

I just need three minutes.

She's not real?

I've been played for a fool.

How dare she trick me like that.

157
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,541
We must find her at once.

However, you must swear
that she won't be harmed.

As you wish.

That was close.

I never thought I'd have
to flee the guild hall.

Of course, that's easier

to reach them?

[LEVY]
You promised.

00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,625
You swore you'd take me
back to the guild hall.

Don't you see? You have to.

That voice.
I've heard it before.

Oh, I'm Zera. Hi.

209
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,291
She's the girl who
guided everybody

210
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,750
back to the guild hall.

211
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,958
She's friends with
the First Master.

00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:21,458
What's up with your body?
Not to be rude.

213
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,958
[DROY]
But you're see-through!

214
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,208
If I had to guess,

215
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:28,125
it's because Mavis has
regained consciousness.

216
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,458
I was honestly
beginning to worry

217
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,750
she was going to
forget me for good.

218
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:32,833
Let me explain.

219
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,625
Since I'm an illusion
that was created

220
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,625
by Mavis's unconsciousness,

221
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,791
once she remembers me,
I'll disappear completely.

222
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,041
[LEVY]
That's horrible.

223
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,083
Actually, it's only
natural because I died

224
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,166
over a hundred years ago!

225
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,875
So you don't have
to worry about me.

226
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,875
[MAVIS]
You heard a girl's voice,

227
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,416
and it told everyone
to gather here?

228

That's what happened.

229
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,333
And I'm pretty sure that
only Fairy Tail members

230
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,958
could hear her.

after I woke up.

You and I will be
together forever, Zera.

Aw, but she was
such a cutie-pie.

Zera's back where she belongs.

I put you through as punishment?

Wait. Who are you people?

268
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:23,791
I'm Porlyusica, a magic healer
who works with Fairy Tail.

But what's more important
now is Natsu's whereabouts.

Is this sealstone?

280
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:04,083
You've got some extremely handy
tools available in Ishgar.

281
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:07,916
I was tied up, too.
Strapped in tightly.

282
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,583
Unable to move, and at
the mercy of my enemy.

283
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,166
It was you. You killed Brandish.

284
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,958
But you and your little
friends corrupted her.

So of course, you have
to pay for that.

Oh, calm down, if it makes
you feel any better,

00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,416
I'm gonna strip him, too.

292
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,458
Maybe. I'm not actually
sure he's still alive.

293
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,208
He hasn't moved.

Look at those big brown eyes.

295

Do many people in Ishgar
have eyes like those?

296
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,125
I think you would
stand out even more

297
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,791
if I were to pluck them
from their sockets.

298
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,708
Come on. What's with that look?

299
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:05,125
Aren't you gonna scream and cry
and beg just a little bit?

300
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,791
I refuse to put on some kind of
show for a psychopath like you.

301
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,416
I'd rather lose my eyes.

302
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,916
I can remember what
everything looks like.

303
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,041
I don't need eyes to see.

304
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:21,166
My guildmates' faces, and
the streets of Magnolia,

305
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,833
even all the smudges
and scribbles

306
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,833
in the books I've read.

307
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,916
If you're going to do it,
then go ahead!

308
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,541
I'm not afraid of
losing my sight!

309
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,958
So I'll have to do more!
I'll butcher your entire face!

that, can you?

[LUCY gasps]

323
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,000
[LUCY]
Did he do this?

324
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,333
[DIMARIA]
He got inside my flow of time.

325
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,833
He has the power of a god.

326
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,916
E.N.D.

327
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,125
Only E.N.D. could've done that.

328
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,583
[HAPPY]
Lucy!

329
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:53,250
Happy!

330
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,916
[HAPPY crying]

331
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,291
[PORLYUSICA]
Natsu's not with you?

332
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,125
[LUCY]
Porlyusica!

333
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,250
You're alive.

334
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,708
Oh, thank goodness! You're okay!

335
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,125
I was so worried!

336
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,541
Yeah, I'm fine.

337
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,791
Now hurry up and put her
back in those restraints

338
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,666
while you still can.

339
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,791
Her power stops time.

340
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,125
We can't afford
to let her use it.

341
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,458
[HAPPY]
What happened down here anyway?

342
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,708
[LUCY]
I'm not exactly sure.

343
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,500
Natsu and I had both
been taken prisoner.

344
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,958
I blacked out,
and when I came to,

345
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:35,708
she was lying there
and Natsu was gone.

346
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,041
Natsu had that
tumor inside him.

347
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,458
It's quite concerning.

348
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,708
At first I'd thought his
overuse of magic power

349
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,833
had caused a mass
of anti-ether-nano,

350
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:50,333
but now, I'm afraid
it's something else.

351
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,041
I'm not entirely
certain what it is,

352
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,000
but at the moment this
girl changed it back

353
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,666
to its former size,

354
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,750
well, it triggered some
kind of awakening.

355
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,875
Stirring something
demonic within him.

356
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,791
[HAPPY]
E.N.D.

357
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:11,458
[LUCY] No! I gotta find
him before it's too late!

358
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,916
You mean dressed like
that? How risqué.

359
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,125
[LUCY screams]

360
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,666
[SOLDIERS groaning]

361
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,833
[NATSU]
Where is Zeref?

362
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,750
I need to find Zeref right now.

363
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,416
[NATSU]
He's there.

364
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,083
Natsu.

365
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,541
It's you.

366
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,333
[LUCY]
Natsu and Gray.

367
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:41,250
As the two begin an epic clash,

368
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:44,250
their emotions threaten
to spiral out of control.

369
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,958
The hatred that's been awakened
in their hearts blinds them,

370
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:49,291
until they're unable to
recognize that their opponent

371
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,041
is really a dear friend.

372
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,666
Meanwhile, on the front line,

373
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,125
Erza's group faces the
massive enemy army,

374
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:58,375
hoping against hope that
they can break though.

375
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:01,208
Next Time: "Broken Bonds."

376
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:03,125
The path forward will
only be opened

377
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:06,125
by a heart full of love
and without fear.
