[NATSU]
I'm good!

00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:25,291
Don't worry. I've got enough
for one more attack.

00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,708
[NATSU]
Igneel. I need your strength.

19
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:45,583
One more shot is all
it's gonna take!

20

[ZEREF]
I'm impressed.

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,083
You've grown so
strong. It's true.

[ZEREF] If there's anyone alive
who can stop me, it's you.

At least, that's what
I've wanted to believe.

24
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,250
But so much time has passed.

25
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,666
I shifted my focus away
from destroying myself

26
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,708
some years ago, and
directed those wishes

toward the world at large.

Although I am immortal,

your next strike could
very well end my life.

31
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:34,375
Yet another contradiction.

32
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,958
It all depends on your strength.

33
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:46,416
[ZEREF] With that said, I have
something to share with you.

34
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,958
And this may be the last
chance I'll ever get.

35
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,458

My true name is Zeref Dragneel.

[ZEREF]
About 400 years ago,

41
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,833
both of our parents
were killed by dragons.

42
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,291
They were burned alive.

43
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,833
I lost my entire
family that day.

44
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,708
Including my little
brother, Natsu.

45
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:20,750
[NATSU gasps]

46
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,875
No way. I don't believe it.

47
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,083
For years I tirelessly
researched ways

48
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,125
to bring you back from the dead.

49
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,375
Instead, I created new life.

50
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,916
"Etherious," also known as

51
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,125
"demons from the
Books of Zeref."

52
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,708
You are one of those.

53
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:41,666
Originally named
Etherious Natsu Dragneel.

54
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,416
Or... E.N.D.

He's lying!

57
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,208
Why would you believe
a word he says?

58
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,208
[NATSU gasps]

59
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,291
Yeah!

60
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,750
So, I'm supposedly
your dead brother

61
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,125
and some kinda demon you made?

62
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:05,041
I've never heard
such a load of crap!

63
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:08,250
Anyway, I thought Igneel
wasn't able to beat E.N.D.!

64
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,166
We all know he could've
totally crushed me

65
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,750
whenever he felt like it,

66
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,458
so there's no way that's me.

67
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,583
[ZEREF]
It's not that he couldn't

68
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:19,500
physically defeat you, brother.

69
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,541
He simply refused to
out of fatherly love.

70
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:23,958
Huh?

71
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:27,083
What about E.N.D. being the
demon who made Tartaros?

72
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,708
That ain't me!

73
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,875
Besides, I'm human!

74
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:36,000
Mard Geer was responsible for
bringing Tartaros into being.

75
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:39,291
He happened upon this book
by a stroke of sheer luck,

76
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,083
then used it to
gather other demons,

77
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:44,000
claiming it was
the will of E.N.D.

78
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,083
So, one could still
make the argument

79
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,541
that you created Tartaros.

80
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:52,583
That's enough! There's no
way in hell I'm a demon!

81
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,833
[groans]

82
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:02,083
Natsu!

83
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,375
[ZEREF]
All these years,

84
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,250
and it's still impossible
to reason with you.

85
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,375
Back then, you refused
to learn how to read,

86
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,833
among other things.

87
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:15,041
That's why... I turned to my
old friend Igneel for advice

88
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,833
on what to do with you.

89
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:17,708
[NATSU]
Huh?

90
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,333
You were friends?

91
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:23,375
[ZEREF] At the time, Igneel was
one of the very few dragons

92
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:26,416
that harbored no hostility
toward humans.

93
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,250
We met completely
by chance one day,

94
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,583
while I was out collecting
herbs for my research.

95
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,291
[ZEREF] He offered to share
his knowledge with you,

96
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,958
to teach you Dragon
Slayer Magic.

97
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,166
Igneel, Metalicana,
and the others

98
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,041
had devised a special plan.

99
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:47,208
They would all raise
Dragon Slayers.

100
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,416
Then, after using the
Dragon Soul technique

101
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,250
to seal away their power
inside the children,

102
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,458
they would travel to the future.

103
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,625
[ZEREF] The ultimate goal
was to slay Acnologia.

104
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,291
[ZEREF] You may be
wondering why they'd need

105
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:06,333
to travel to the future.

106
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,791
The truth is, the dragons
were simply at their weakest

107
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,541
at that moment.

108
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,875
They needed more Ether-nano
in the environment.

109
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,416
The only way they
could break the seals

110
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,291
on the Dragon Soul
spells was by going

111
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:21,125
to an era rich with Ether-nano.

112
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:25,291
Five children were chosen to be
their vessels for this mission.

113
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:34,333
You, Gajeel, Wendy,
Sting, and Rogue.

114
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,583
[ZEREF] Each one of them
a child without a family.

115
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,208
Well, you had me,

116
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:44,208
but I gave my approval
for my own reasons.

117
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:48,041
I did want Acnologia
dead, but...

118
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,541
...there was a more
selfish factor.

119
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:51,875
I hoped you'd grow strong enough

120
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:56,416
to someday end my suffering
and kill me as well.

121
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,750
They used the Eclipse gate to
create a portal into the future.

122
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:03,208
A celestial wizard named Anna
was in charge of the entrance.

123
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:07,916
The exit was left to an
undetermined point in time.

124
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,916
Anna's family passed
this responsibility

125
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,541
down for generations.

126
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,833
The gate was finally
unlocked in this current era,

127
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:17,000
when Ether-nano is abundant.

128
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:20,791
A Celestial Spirit wizard named
Layla opened the Eclipse.

129
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,458
That event happened
on the seventh day

130
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:26,083
of the seventh month
of the year 777.

131
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,500
The day you thought the
dragons disappeared.

132
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,958
In fact, it was the day
you Dragon Slayers

133
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,250
awoke in this era.

134
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:38,666
You were children. Ones born
400 years in the past.

135
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,083
I waited for you. Centuries
spent in anticipation.

136
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:51,500
However, 400 years
is a long time.

137
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,750
Much has happened since then.

138
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,291
I've seen ages come and go,

139
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:00,041
countless people being
born only to die.

140
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:03,666
For a while, the importance
of any one life lost meaning.

141
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:08,250
Then I met Mavis.
And inevitably lost her.

142
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,583
So I...

143
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,208
Shut up!

144

this crap you're spewin'!

Since you're a demon

00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,375
if you kill me...

...you'll die, too.

00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,541
[NATSU]
I'm losin' Igneel's power,

163
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,041
so ya gotta put me down!

164
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,458
This is our last chance!

165
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:12,750
If he gets away, he's gonna
destroy the whole world!

166
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,666
But you're my best
friend, Natsu!

167
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,833
You'd stop me from
dying, wouldn't you?

168
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:27,958
I'm taking you home,
no matter what! Right now!

169
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,916
[ZEREF]
It could've ended here.

170
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,375
[ZEREF]
Goodbye, Natsu.

171
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,666
[ZEREF] Now, there's not a
soul left who can stop me.

172
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,375
I've been unburdened
of all hesitation.

173
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,916
Have the troops resume
their advance at once.

174
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,666
The target is the
Fairy Tail guild hall.

175
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,166
The unending power of the
Fairy Heart shall be mine,

176
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,583
and mine alone.

177
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:06,458
Also, a new set of
clothes in in order.

178
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:12,041
A wardrobe befitting an emperor.

179
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,250
[DIMARIA]
This place is pretty nice.


180
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,416
I suppose that it was wise
of you to not destroy it.

181
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,333
[WALL laughs]

182
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:29,666
Well, I was aiming for
Magnolia, if you must know!

183
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,291
Then we're quite fortunate
that wasn't destroyed, either.

184
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:36,333
It's where Randi's
being held prisoner.

185
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:37,916
The mere thought
of the humiliation

186
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,583
she must be feeling...

187
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,041
I can't wait to see it.

00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,291
[chuckles]

189
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:46,583
You humans don't make a
damn bit of sense to me.

190
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,708
Do you know where Neinhart is?

191
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,750
[SOLDIER A]
Still on his ship, ma'am.

192
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,958
[DIMARIA]
Wonderful.

193
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,875
I'm stuck babysitting a
sullen loner and a machine.

194
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:09,166
But seeing Randi like that
should cheer me right up.

195
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,958
[MILLIANNA]
Meow...

196
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,500
How many of these Alvarez
goons did they send our way?

197
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,000
[KAGURA]
From what I'm hearing,

198
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:20,000
nearly 2,000 are in position
outside of Hargeon.

199
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,791
There's a ton more
inside the city.

200
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,791
Supposedly there are
boatloads full of troops

201
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,208
that haven't landed yet.

202
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:28,125
Prob'ly more than 300,000.

203
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,041
That's just crazy!

204
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,000
Between Lamia Scale
and Mermaid Heel,

205
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,458
we have around 200 people.

206
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:35,708
We're at a disadvantage,

207
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,208
so we must fight with
everything we've got.

208
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,250
They've come onto our
homeland of Ishgar.

209
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:45,083
No matter the cost,
we will not be overrun!

210
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:49,250
The forces of Mermaid Heel and
Lamia Scale have come together.

211
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:53,125
We will give our lives in the
fight to liberate Hargeon!

212
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,833
Forward!

213
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:58,000
[WIZARDS cheer]

214
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,041
[DIMARIA] Well now,
it seems we must teach

215
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,791
these arrogant fools
a hard lesson.

216
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,291
They must learn what power is.

217
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,500
Yes. Ha!

218
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,125

Yeah, they're fine, thanks.

E.N.D.

00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,833
Since you're a demon
of the Book of Zeref,

223
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,583
if you kill me...

00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,708
...you'll die, too.

Hm?

You and me are friends
forever, aren't we?

00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,958
Yeah. We are.

What's up?

230
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:15,750
You gotta find some
other way. Okay?

231
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:21,500
I won't let my best
friend die. You hear me?

00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,000
Yeah.

you're okay, Natsu.

I almost can't believe
you'd run off

237
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,208
to fight Zeref all by yourself.

238
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:47,666
That's crazy, even for you.

Listen to Happy and
make sure he's safe.

240

You've sunk to a new low.

Huh?

That was not a solo endeavor.

I had some help from

Will you lecture them?

What compelled you to dishonor
your motherland, God Serena?

Surely there's a reason.

That's some glare.
You must be feeling fussy.

[gasps]

323
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,375
I must say, your reaction
speed's impressive!

324
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:47,708
I love your eastern
kimono. It's beautiful.

325
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,166
However...

326
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,791
...I'm afraid your blood
is going to stain it.

327
00:20:55,666 --> 00:21:00,041
[KAGURA] No. Where is all this
magic power coming from?

328
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,000
Can you feel it too, Lyon?

329
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,041
There's intense
pressure in the air.

330
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,000
My goodness, Beth, you okay?

331
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,666
Yeah. But somethin'
scary's goin' down.

332
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,250
Please! Be careful!

333
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,666
[KAGURA]
Her power is so intense,

334
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,708
the entire battlefield
is frozen in terror.

335
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:21,416
She has to be a member
of the Spriggan Twelve.

336
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,916
Your bangs kind of
remind me of Randi's.

337
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,750
Now this will be fun.

338
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,041
[gasps]

339
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:31,875
Huh? I didn't see her.

340
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:50,375
That's good! I can see
Magnolia right up ahead!

341
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,375
Hm? Natsu?

342
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,666
Oh, no! What's wrong with you?

343
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,875
Please, say something!

344
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:00,666
Natsu!

345
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,333
[LUCY] Brandish is nearly
killed by her "precious pet,"

346
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:41,500
but luckily for her,

347
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:42,916
we're not gonna let
something like that

348
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,750
happen in our guild hall!

349
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,916
As she recovers from
that vicious attack,

350
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,125
she finally reveals her
mysterious connection

351
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:50,958
to my mother, Layla.

352
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:53,166
Her heart has been in
the fiery grip of revenge

353
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,500
for all these years,

354
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:56,458
and since Mom's
not around anymore,

355
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:59,958
she's been waiting to
take her anger out on me.

356
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:02,833
Next Time: "What I Want to Do."

357
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:06,625
The memories of the stars
guide us on to a new future.
