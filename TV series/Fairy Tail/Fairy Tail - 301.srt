1
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,750
[NEINHART]
These souls, that never had

2
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,250
the pleasure of meeting before,

3
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:24,333
now interact as old friends.

4
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:27,166
Ahh. It's such a
marvelous thing.

5
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,708
Now, spread forth,
Historia of Corpses.

6
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:09,875
[KAGURA]
Live!

7
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:50,125
So, you ready for more training?

8
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,625
[GRAY, LYON]
Ur?

9
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,375
Yo. If it ain't ol' Meldy.

10
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,833
Zancrow?

11
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,041
What is this? They're dead!

12
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,625
[KEYES]
Not wandering corpses

13
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:02,416
but memories of fallen
rivals given form.

14
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,208
Whoa! Who is that?

15
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:07,833
[WENDY]
Shelia, take Carla and run.

16
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,583
Right now!

17
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,208
This has gotta be
some kinda joke.

18
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,333
[KYOKA]
Oh.

19
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:19,125
The pain you'll experience
will be absolutely exquisite.

20
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,750
How pathetic! That's it
after all these years?

21
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,000
Dear boys.

22
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,791
It's obvious that you're
never gonna surpass me.

23
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:36,666
[LYON]
Ur.

24
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,000
[GRAY]
Don't fall for it, man!

25
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,208
That's not Ur!

26
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:44,833
I realize that. It's just
a spell to throw us off.

27
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,375
But still...

28
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,125
[UR]
Rose Garden!

29
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,333
[LYON yells]

30
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,833
She has the same skills
and power level?

31
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,541
[GRAY] Maybe, but you
and I both have more

32
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,000
than we did back then, remember?

33
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,583
Oh?

34
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,750
You have to get over it, Lyon!

35
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,583
She's just an enemy
that looks like Ur!

36
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,375
But, Gray...

37
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:13,833
[GRAY] We can't let her defile
our master's memory like this!

38
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:17,791
But you're dead! You never
made it off of that island!

39
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,916
Oh, yeah! I died on Tenrou!

40
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,416
That's why seeing you...

41
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,958
[MELDY screaming]

42
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,000
...and finding out you
made it when I didn't

43
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,125
totally pisses me off!

44
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,541
[KEYES]
The voices of the dead

45
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:36,666
once again reverberate
across the battlefield.

46
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,375
Now I find myself as
the puppet in this scene.

47
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,666
How fascinating!

48
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,166
The dead shouldn't be
playthings for anyone.

49
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,208
[KEYES] Those alive once again
plagued by the memories

50
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,291
of their past struggles.

51
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,666
[WENDY screams]

52
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,916
[KEYES laughs]

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,083
[KEYES] This is a joyous
occasion indeed.

54
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:58,083
Oh, no! I can't walk!

55
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,916
[LAXUS]
Tch.

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,958
I mean, I get it.

57
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,750
Course the founding
members of Fairy Tail

58
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:08,041
wouldn't just stay in
their graves, but damn!

59
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,625
[ERZA yells]

60
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,583
[NEINHART]
I can't believe the pitiful show

61
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:15,333
Dimaria and Wall put on.

62
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,250
Overpowering these
buffoons is an easy task.

63
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,125
That is, for me at least.

64
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,041
[ERZA yelling]

65
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,083
[ERZA gasps]

66
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,291
Isn't this fun?

67
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,791
[ERZA screams]

68
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,875
[NEINHART] That rage in
your eyes is delicious.

69
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:56,291
I've no doubt you'll make
someone a lovely Historia.

70
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,416
Once we're finally
done with you.

71
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,208
Pull her up, would you, dear?

72
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:08,625
[ERZA grunting]

73
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,875
Well, this takes me back, Erza.

74
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,791
To our time in my
torture chamber.

75
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:25,166
You remember my loving
caresses, don't you? Hmm?

76
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,833
[ERZA screams]

77
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,750
[KYOKA] I've amplified
your sensitivity to pain.

78
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,625
[KYOKA chuckles]

79
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,708
[KYOKA] Now, I wonder if
I should raise it more.

80
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:42,708
Or should I introduce a
hint of pleasure instead?

81
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:46,916
I'm starting to believe I may
have actually missed you, Erza.

82
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,333
[ERZA]
That so?

83
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:51,375
Because I've grown quite
weary of this little reunion.

84
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,875
[gasps]

85
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:56,166
[ERZA] It's true all of you
were once powerful foes,

86
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,750
and obstacles to my
progress, however...

87
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,958
...each of you...
also fell by my hand!

88
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,166
[gasps]

89
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,416
[KYOKA]
Shut your mouth!

90
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:17,875
[gasps]

91
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:23,083
Get out of my sight,
you damned ghosts.

92
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:26,291
Before you feel the bite
of my blade again!

93
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,916
Such ferocity...

94
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,875
Erza!

95
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,125
[gasps]

96
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,041
What's happening?

97
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,458
I can't believe this!

98
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,458
Damn you, Erza!

99
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,541
[NEINHART] She was able
to defeat my Historias

100
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,666
with mere intimidation?

101
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,875
Who is she?

102
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,333
[JELLAL, KAGURA]
Erza!

103
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,208
[NEINHART]
Wait a second.

104
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,875
[KAGURA]
She's badly injured.

105
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,125
Erza! Talk to me!

106
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,208
[gasps]

107
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,791
[JELLAL growls]

108
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:19,041
[NEINHART] Her name. Her scarlet
hair. Her immense power.

109
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,666
It all adds up.

110
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,083
But could she really
be Irene's...?

111
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:27,125
[KAGURA]
Please! Erza! Open your eyes!

112
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:31,500
It seems there's one final
sin I need to commit.

113
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,833
What do you mean?

114
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,083
[gasps]

115
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,541
[NEINHART]
No! What happened to the sky?

116
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,625
Has night fallen?

117
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,708
[growling]

118
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:49,708
[KEYES] The stars, harbingers
of blessings... or misfortune?

119
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,416
What's going on?

120
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,208
This is Jellal's magic!

121
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,208
Really?

122
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,625
Who in the hell
even gives a crap

123
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,541
about the stars and the sky?

124
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,041
Juvia. Link with me again!

125
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,208
If that'll help, but how?

126
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,041
[MELDY] When people who trust
each other share their senses,

127
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,583
their power is multiplied, too.

128
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,375
So now it's something good?

129
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,958
[MELDY] This is how the spell
was intended to be used.

130
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,958
[KEYES]
What you call mutual trust

131
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:20,041
is nothing more than
pitiful dependency.

132
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,125
And that means you'll
both feel more pain

133
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,000
when I roast you alive!

134
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:28,333
[BOTH yell]

135
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,083
[WIZARD B] Does anybody
else feel a little chilly?

136
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,333
[WIZARD G] It's 'cause Gray
and Lyon are doin' their thing!

137
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,500
[WIZARD C] The enemy is on its
last legs! We've almost won!

138
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,583
Ice Make Geyser!

139
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,875
Ice Make Volcano!

140
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,000
[gasps]

141
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,583
[GRAY, LYON scream]

142
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,500
[LYON]
There's no way we can win.

143
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,291
Not against Ur.

144
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:01,166
I told you that thing isn't Ur!

145
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,833
Ur's dead, you hear me?

146
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:08,833
She's dead, and it's my
fault! You know that, Lyon!

147
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,583
[LYON]
You've had to walk a long road

148
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:14,166
to get where you are now, Gray.

149
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:20,000
That road took you to place
where you could heal yourself.

150
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,416
Where you could get over
all that happened with Ur.

151
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,166
That journey...

152
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,791
...I never had the
chance to take it.

153
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:57,083
Well, you have a chance now.
Don't let it go to waste.

154
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:02,875
Listen, man. My journey
didn't just happen to me.

155
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,625
I only made it this far
because I never stopped.

156
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,750
I kept on pushing forward.

157
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,416
Get moving. Right now!

158
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:17,583
Why even bother? You might
as well just give up.

159
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,875
[WENDY]
This is bad.

160
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,041
How am I gonna fight like this?

161
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,375
[CARLA]
Wendy!

162
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,666
[gasps]

163
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,416
[WENDY]
It's Carla! And Shelia!

164
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,916
Get back!

165
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,666
No way! We'll help you!

166
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,541
Wendy! I could never leave you!

167
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:42,458
I'll help you fly!

168
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:46,083
Friends stay together forever
and always, don't they?

169
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,958
[WENDY]
Yeah!

170
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,375
Now, Wendy, let's go!

171
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,500
Right!

172
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,500
You belong in the past,
you old geezer!

173
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:04,625
So apologize to the First Master
and then go back to hell!

174
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:05,750
Ready?

175
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,750
Let's do it!

176
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,250
Here's the first step!

177
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,750
Oh, yeah! And we're
gonna take it all the way!

178
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,791
[GRAY]
Ice Demon... Zero Long Sword!

179
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,625
[LYON]
Ice Blade... Swan Wings!

180
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:21,250
[WENDY]
Sky Dragon Crushing Fang!

181
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,291
[BOTH]
Maguilty Water!

182
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:27,500
[LAXUS]
Lightning Dragon Jaw!

183
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,666
[JELLAL] May the seven stars
bring judgment upon you.

184
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,291
[NEINHART]
Oh, Jellal,

185
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:36,291
we've already seen
your Historia today!

186
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,708
Simon! Your old friend!

187
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,375
The one you murdered after
all he'd done for you!

188
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,833
[gasps]

189
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:46,208
[NEINHART] You can't do
it again! How could you?

190
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:49,750
The guilt... Could you
live with that burden?

191
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,708
This thing is not my brother!

192
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,791
[gasping]

193
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,333
Jellal! Strike him down!

194
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,916
[JELLAL]
Grand Chariot!

195
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:19,291
[screaming]

196
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,666
[BOTH chuckle]

197
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,708
[BOTH laughing]

198
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,916
[ALL laughing]

199
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:43,000
[ALL cheering]

200
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:47,166
It was just the middle of the
night and now it's sunset?

201
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:52,750
The sky... Scarlet and lovely.

202
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,708
[NATSU]
That guy in the east?

203
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,583
I'm gonna meet him
halfway and kick his butt!

204
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,541
Are you talking about August?

205
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,625
You can't take him
on by yourself.

206
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,000
I'll go with you!

207
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,000
Aye, me, too!

208
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,750
[MAKAROV]
Hmm... I don't know.

209
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,208
[NATSU] You want me to just
sit around and wait for him?!

210
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,833
What's the point if we're gonna
end up fighting anyway?!

211
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,583
If we're fighting the
strongest of the Twelve,

212
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,208
we have to be ready!

213
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,958
[BRANDISH]
He's not the strongest.

214
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,125
Huh?

215
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,083
The enemy--?

216
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,333
[BRANDISH]
To be more accurate,

217
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,208
he's only one of the strongest.

218
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,208
[ROMEO] Whoa! She's in
the Spriggan Twelve!

219
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,208
[MEST]
Why is she out of her cell?

220
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,458
Because I let her out.

221
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,666
Say what?!

222
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,041
She's actually been
pretty cool, ya know?

223
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:43,916
So you're saying there's
another one as strong as he is?

224
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,083
Yes, exactly.
August is powerful.

225
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:52,416
Hardly anyone else in the
Twelve can compare to him.

226
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,625
But there is another
that rivals,

227
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,708
or maybe even exceeds
his magic power.

228
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,083
--[LUCY, HAPPY gasp]
--[MAKAROV] Hm...

229
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:06,166
[BRANDISH] You could say,
if he's the strongest man,

230
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,541
then she's the strongest woman.

231
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,666
Irene Belserion.


232
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,500
A wizard also known as
the "Scarlet Despair."


233
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,000
You're finally awake.

234
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,083
[ERZA]
Kagura. Uh!

235
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,750
[KAGURA]
Don't exert yourself.

236
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,791
[WENDY]
Your wounds were pretty bad,

237
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,166
so it's gonna take a little time

238
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,000
before you're
completely healed up.

239
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,833
But don't worry, there
shouldn't be any scarring.

240
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,416
It looks like you guys went
through the wringer yourselves.

241
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,291
[JUVIA]
Gray! Your clothes!

242
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,791
[CARLA]
Yours, too.

243
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:42,958
Thank you.

244
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,333
[gasps]

245
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,416
What's going on now
with the battle?

246
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,291
[chuckles]

247
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,500
[GRAY] We were able
to liberate Hargeon

248
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:54,458
and take back
control of the port.

249
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:57,166
There are still a few soldiers
left hangin' around,

250
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,333
but Jellal and his team
are takin' care of 'em.

251
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,291
That's great.

252
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:07,041
We're gonna head back
to the guild hall soon.

253
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,000
They probably still need
our help back home.

254
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,416
Luckily, our friends from
Mermaid and Lamia

255
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,916
will look after everything
here after we leave.

256
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,708
I should return, too.

257
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,250
[KAGURA] You need to stay
put until you're well.

258
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,166
You know I can't just lie here.

259
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,958
What's the matter with Laxus?

260
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,083
[KAGURA] He had two big
fights back to back,

261
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,833
so he'll be out for a while.

262
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,000
[gasps]

263
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:34,875
[KAGURA]
Erza.

264
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:35,875
Huh?

265
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:39,875
[KAGURA]
Uh... this is awkward.

266
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,541
I hope you'll forgive me.

267
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,541
What are you talking about?

268
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:51,750
[ALL scream]

269
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,000
That was my apology.

270
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,625
[ERZA]
Uh.

271
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,750
[LYON]
Hey. Are you okay?

272
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,833
[SHELIA]
Yeah. I'll be fine.

273
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,791
[LYON]
Quite a reckless move.

274
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,791
[SHELIA]
It was pretty stupid, wasn't it?

275
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,666
'Cause now...
I've lost my magic.

276
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:26,500
That may be, but you traded it
for something far greater:

277
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,333
A future for all of us.

278
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,791
[DIMARIA]
They captured her?

279
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,916
Talk about a hassle.

280
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,916
It's almost too pitiful
to joke about.

281
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,166
[DIMARIA]
Randi.

282
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,666
[MAKAROV]
So, you're finally willing

283
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,583
to divulge some information?

284
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,875
[BRANDISH]
Just this once.

285
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,125
Don't let me give
you the wrong idea.

286
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:05,291
I don't intend to completely
betray my homeland.

287
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,583
I'm not going to start
fighting for your side.

288
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,875
But I do owe a debt to Lucy.

289
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,333
Huh?

290
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,375
What in the world
did you do for her?

291
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,458
Uh, I--

292
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:17,833
Here's the deal.

293
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,875
I'm willing to negotiate
with August on your behalf.

294
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,125
What?

295
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,041
But you're allies!

296
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,791
What do you mean by that?

297
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:27,958
Tell us.

298
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,583
[BRANDISH]
There isn't a wizard alive

299
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,333
who'd have a snowball's
chance in hell

300
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,958
against August in battle.

301
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,250
Except Irene, that is.

302
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:39,291
Back in Alvarez, August is
known as "the Calamity,"

303
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:42,458
while Irene is called
"the Scarlet Despair."

304
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,625
I don't have a
relationship with Irene,

305
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,083
so I wouldn't be
much help there.

306
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:51,750
But August and I have been close
ever since I was a little girl.

307
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:55,375
No promises, but I may be able
to talk him out of an attack.

308
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,541
Oh, wow!

309
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,875
For real?

310
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:01,375
Uh, thank you. That's an
incredible thing to offer.

311
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,750
No way! It's just a ploy.

312
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,625
She is not trustworthy!

313
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,291
She's trying to escape!

314
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:12,083
[BRANDISH] You can believe me or
not, that's totally your call.

315
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,833
[NATSU]
Hm...

316
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,750
I think we should
trust her, guys.

317
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,291
Lucy!

318
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,541
[chuckles]

319
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,208
That settles it for me!

320
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,708
I'm gonna kick that
old dude's butt!

321
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,208
Pay attention for once
in your life, would ya?

322
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,000
[HAPPY]
Classic Natsu move right there.

323
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,541
[NATSU] I got him and Lucy
can take on the other one!

324
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,750
[LUCY]
Me? Why?

325
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:45,708
So this is Zonia,
the sacred mountain,

326
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,500
where the heavenly black and
white maidens fought long ago.

327
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,750
As the white maiden
claimed victory,

328
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:56,333
snow began to blanket the peak
and still falls to this day.

329
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,791
Wow, Lady Irene,
I'm impressed you know


330
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,291
so much about this
country's old legends.


331
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:04,916
Idiot, she's actually
from Ishgar, remember?


332
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,541
I think you may be an idiot
for bringing that up.

333
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,916
Huh? Uh, please, forgive me!

334
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,083
[IRENE chuckles]

335
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,625
The heavenly white maiden
and black maiden

336
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:18,125
reminds me of the two of you.

337
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,916
I call dibs on black!

338
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,458
I'm obviously the
black one, dummy!

339
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,958
If you two were to
do battle, I wonder,

340
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,041
which one of you would
emerge the victor?

341
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,208
[BOTH whimpering]

342
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,541
[IRENE]
I'm joking.

343
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,416
[BOTH sigh]

344
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,541
[IRENE] The initial conflict
between those maidens

345
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:38,125
began because the two girls
were fighting over a man.

346
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,458
A darling little tale.

347
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:45,083
But as lovely as it may be,
I can't stand the chill.

348
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,583
[SOLDIERS yelling]

349
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,666
[LISANNA yells]

350
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,250
Come on, Sting. Wake up!

351
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:02,583
All the others...
are they still alive?

352
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:05,250
[GAJEEL]
Safe and sound. Don't worry.

353
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,000
What a disgrace.

354
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,458
We didn't stand a
chance. We're weak.

355
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,125
Don't beat yourself up.

356
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,791
We'll get revenge for you.

357
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,625
They'll be pickin' their
teeth up off the ground.

358
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,416
What's happening?

359
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,458
Hey, Gajeel!

360
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,833
[GAJEEL gasps]

361
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,625
Something's not right.

362
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,750
You can say that again.

363
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:31,333
[LEVY] It's so weird.
The snow's melting.

364
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:38,333
[JULIET]
Yay! Lady Irene, you're amazing!

365
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,625
[HEINE]
It's warm now.

366
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:42,666
It appears we have some
more guests joining us.

367
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,750
Has everything been prepared?

368
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:48,083
Bloodman. Larcade.

369
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:51,250
[STING crying]

370
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,791
[STING]
Damn it. What're we gonna do?

371
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:57,666
They've got those three
monsters on their side!

372
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,583
[chuckles]

373
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,000
Yeah, well, we got six
monsters on our side!

374
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,625
Whoa. You're counting me?

375
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,291
[LUCY]
As the Wizard King, August,

376
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:42,708
approaches from the east,
we set out with Brandish in tow,

377
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:45,500
hoping to convince him
to call off his attack.

378
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:48,125
Meanwhile, on the sacred
mountain of Zonia,

379
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:50,958
Sabertooth and Blue Pegasus
spring back into action

380
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:52,750
thanks to Gajeel's team.

381
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,583
They may have their sprits back,

382
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,208
but the foes they'll
face will send them

383
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:58,708
spiraling into a
world of terror.

384
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:01,250
Next time: "The Third Seal."

385
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,083
Death looms all around

386
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:06,833
and threatens to drag everyone
down to the underworld.
