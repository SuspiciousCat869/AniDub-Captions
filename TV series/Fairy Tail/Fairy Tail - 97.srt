ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS
ABOUT BEING BACK HOME.

00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,750
- Cana:
THE TUB IS PRETTY GREAT.

5
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,875
- YEAH, IT'S THE BEST.

6
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,333
- IF YOU EVER WANT A ROOMMATE,

7
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:39,916
I WOULDN'T MIND LIVING
HERE AT ALL.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,833

YOURSELF RIGHT AT HOME TO ME!

- YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO HAVE
ANY ADULT BEVERAGES

32
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,583
HIDDEN AWAY IN THIS PLACE,
WOULD YOU?

33
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:16,916
- THIS IS MY HOUSE, YOU KNOW!

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,083
- Lucy: MY UNEXPECTED
GUEST IS CANA ALBERONA.

35
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,833
OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION
OF FAIRY TAIL MEMBERS

36
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:26,041
SHE'S BEEN IN THE GUILD
THE LONGEST.

37
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:29,583
- ( sighs )

38
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:30,916
- Lucy:
WHAT'S UP?

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,500
IS SOMETHING BOTHERING YOU?

40
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:37,958
- Cana: NO, I'M OKAY.
BUT I'VE GOT TO ASK,

41
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,458
DO YOU LIKE, MAKE A HABIT
OF BATHING WITH OTHER PEOPLE?

42
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:43,708
- DO YOU MAKE A HABIT OF
BREAKING INTO HOUSES? SERIOUSLY.

43
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:47,291
- SO HOW HAVE THINGS BEEN GOING
BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR DAD

44
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,708
THESE DAYS?

45
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:53,791
- UM...I DON'T KNOW.
OKAY, I GUESS.

46
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:57,958
BUT I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY HEARD
FROM HIM IN A WHILE.

47
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,583
- HMM.

48
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,541
- ( sighs )

49
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,708
- JUST SPILL IT ALREADY.

50
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,458
I'LL ALWAYS LISTEN IF YOU
WANT TO TALK.

51
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,708
- ALRIGHT THEN. I'VE BEEN
SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING

52
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,041
QUITTING THE GUILD.

53
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,166
- Lucy:
WHAT?!

54
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:22,125
- ( Happy speaking )

55
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,250
- Chico: CHEERS!
- Wang: CHEERS!

56
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,333
- Lucy:
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

57
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,291
I MEAN, I THOUGHT CANA
WAS IN FAIRY TAIL FOR LIFE.

58
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:33,666
I TRIED TO GET HER TO TELL
ME WHY, BUT SHE WOULDN'T SAY.

59
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,583
- I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

60
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,333
SHE ALWAYS STARTS TALKING
ABOUT QUITTING

61
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,208
WHENEVER THIS TIME OF YEAR
ROLLS AROUND.

62
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,375
- SAY WHAT?!

63
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:41,875
OH, NO.  IS SOMETHING BAD
GOING TO HAPPEN?

64
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:45,125
- Lucy:
IT SEEMS WAY LONGER,

65
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,416
BUT IT'S BEEN LESS THAN A YEAR
SINCE I JOINED FAIRY TAIL.

66
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,375
THEY HAVE A LOT OF MAJOR EVENTS
AND TRADITIONS

67
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,875
THAT I'VE NEVER BEEN A PART OF.
AND LITTLE DID I KNOW,

68
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:56,916
ONE OF THE BIGGEST WAS GOING
TO BE TAKING PLACE VERY SOON.

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,625
- LET'S GET TO WORK, HAPPY.
-AYE!

70
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,791
- HEY, IF YOU'RE GOING ON A JOB,
TAKE ME WITH YOU!

71
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,166
- IT'S SOLO-MISSION SEASON,
SORRY.

72
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,708
- WE'LL HANG OUT WITH YOU
WHEN WE GET BACK.

73
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,125
- YOU BETTER WATCH WHERE YOU'RE
GOING, YOU PINK-HAIRED FREAK!

74
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,291
- AND YOU BETTER TRY TO STAY OUT
OF MY WAY, MR. GRUMPY PANTIES!

75
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,750
- YOU GUYS REALLY HAVE TIME
TO STAND AROUND AND ARGUE?

76
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,083
- ( both )
YEAH, GOOD POINT.

77
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,416
- I'M BACK.

78
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,791
- Mirajane:
FORGET YOUR CLOTHES AGAIN?

79
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:20,916
- NO TIME TO WORRY ABOUT IT,

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,291
I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS JOB,
SEE YA!

81
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,958
- Mirajane:
BYE-BYE, GOOD LUCK.

82
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,583
- HE'S ON A SOLO GIG, TOO?

83
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,583
- HEY, THIS IS A JOB
FOR A REAL MAN.

84
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,208
- Mirajane:
ALRIGHT, BE CAREFUL OUT THERE.

85
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,541
- I'M GOING TO PULL THE TRIGGER
ON THIS JOB OVER HERE, OKAY?

86
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:32,833
- GOT MY SIGHTS ON THIS ONE.

87
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,625
- I CALLED DIBS ON THAT JOB,
WARREN!

88
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,000
- I'M SORRY, PAL.
BUT IT'S FINDERS KEEPERS.

89
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,291
- ( both ) THE GREAT AND
MIGHTY TEAM SHADOW GEAR

90
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,333
IS SPLITTING UP FOR NOW.

91
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:41,916
- WHY IS EVERYONE GOING CRAZY?

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,083
- Mirajane:
YOU'LL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH.

93
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,666
- Wendy: HUH?

94
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,000
- ( both ) 
YOU CAN SEE INTO THE FUTURE?

95
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,708
- YES, A TRAIT THAT THE
EXCEED QUEEN AND I SHARE.

96
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,791
BOTH OF US WERE BLESSED WITH
THE RARE GIFT OF CLAIRVOYANCE.

97
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,750
I WASN'T AWARE OF IT
UNTIL RECENTLY,

98
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,250
BUT I BELIEVE I HAVE A SMALL
DEGREE OF CONTROL OVER IT.

99
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,250
- WOW, THAT'S TOTALLY AMAZING.

100
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,583
- SO CAN YOU TELL ME WHICH GUY

101
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,250
IS GOING TO BE
MY FUTURE HUSBAND?

102
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:05,166
- I'M AFRAID I'M NOT ABLE
TO SEE THAT FAR AHEAD.

103
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,333
BUT MAYBE, SOMETHING SOONER?

104
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:11,250
OKAY, KEEP AN EYE
ON MACAO OVER THERE.

105
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:14,166
I PREDICT THAT ANY MOMENT NOW,
WAKABA WILL WALK UP TO HIM

106
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,333
AND START DISCUSSING
THE YOUNGER FOLKS IN THE GUILD.

107
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,541
- ( both )
LET'S SEE.

108
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,541
- WHAT'S SHAKING, OLD TIMER?
- HEY, PAL.

109
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,791
- YOU WERE RIGHT, HE WALKED UP
JUST LIKE YOU SAID!

110
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,666
- BE QUIET SO WE CAN HEAR
WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.

111
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,250
- WE'RE GETTING TO THAT TIME
OF YEAR AGAIN, BUDDY.

112
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,125
- YEAH, IT REALLY TAKES ME BACK.

113
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,541
- Wakaba: THOSE WERE THE
GOOD OLD DAYS, WEREN'T THEY?

114
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,500
- Macao: WE WERE FULL
OF SPUNK BACK THEN.

115
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,250
- Wakaba: TELL YOU WHAT, THIS
NEW CROP IS SOMETHING ELSE.

116
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,958
ESPECIALLY THEIR DERRIERES!

117
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,125
- WHAT, NO WAY!

118
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,375
- YOU MORE OF A BREAST MAN?

119
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,000
- LOOK, I'M TRYING
TO RAISE A KID.

120
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,166
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO AROUND
CHECKING OUT BUTTS.

121
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,375
- THAT'S RIGHT,
YOU'RE A LEG MAN, AREN'T YA?

122
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,291
- Macao:
NOW YOU'RE SPEAKING MY LANGUAGE.

123
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,291
I'LL STAND BEHIND
A PAIR OF LEGS ANY DAY.

124
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,000
- THAT IS SO COOL!

125
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,833
- YEAH, YOU HIT IT ON THE NOSE.

126
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,958
YOU DIDN'T TELL US IT WOULD BE
SO CREEPY, THOUGH.

127
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,333
- QUITE HONESTLY, WE SHOULD HAVE
ALL SEEN THAT ONE COMING.

128
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,625
- STILL, I'M SUPER IMPRESSED.

129
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,250
- MM-HM.
- THANK YOU.

130
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,750
BUT I STILL HAVE
MUCH MORE TO LEARN

131
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,625
ABOUT HOW
TO PROPERLY CONTROL IT.

132
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:09,250
- HEY GUYS, YOU SHOULDN'T
BE DOING THAT INDOORS.

133
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,791
- HAD ENOUGH?

134
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:21,333
- IT SEEMS I CAN'T STAY IN MY
ORIGINAL FORM FOR VERY LONG.

135
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,500
- STILL, I FIND YOU
QUITE IMPRESSIVE.

136
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,166
YOUR BLADE SKILLS
ARE TOP-NOTCH.

137
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,500
- YOU FLATTER ME.
I THINK I SHOULD BE THE ONE

138
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,583
COMPLIMENTING YOU.

139
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,291
- WHAT DO YOU THINK, ERZA?

140
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,291
MY CAT IS A FORCE OF NATURE,
AIN'T HE?

141
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,000
- I ASSUME THIS IS
WHAT THE GUILD REFERS TO

142
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,875
AS AN S-CLASS SKILL LEVEL?

143
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,833
- ( humming )

144
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,500
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
SO MANY PEOPLE 

145
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,791
ARE FREAKING GUNG-HO
ABOUT GOING OUT ON JOBS,

146
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,458
WHILE EVERYONE ELSE IS
JUST GOOFING OFF

147
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,166
LIKE THERE'S NOTHING HAPPENING.

148
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,666
- IT WILL ALL MAKE SENSE
TO YOU TOMORROW.

149
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,500
- Male Narrator:
THE FOLLOWING DAY,

150
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,958
ALMOST EVERY MEMBER
OF FAIRY TAIL

151
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,375
HAS GATHERED IN THE GUILD HALL

152
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,125
AWAITING A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT.

153
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,083
- WHAT'S ALL
THE COMMOTION ABOUT?

154
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,166
- BEATS ME.

155
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,708
- I THINK THE MASTER IS
GOING TO TELL US

156
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,416
ABOUT SOMETHING BIG HAPPENING.

157
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,083
- CAN'T SAY I'M EXCITED.

158
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,708
- WHAT'S HE GOING TO SAY?

159
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,583
THE SUSPENSE IS KILLING ME!

160
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,916
- WE WORKED 
OUR LITTLE TAILS OFF, RIGHT?

161
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,041
DON'T WORRY.

162
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:18,166
- JUST CALM DOWN, NATSU.
YOU'VE GOT THIS.

163
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,083
- THE TENSION HERE IS HUGE,
VERY MANLY.

164
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:26,250
- I'M DYING TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

165
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,000
- THIS IS
SO UNBELIEVABLY EXCITING.

166
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:31,208
- Juvia:
GRAY IS ALMOST WITHIN REACH.

167
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,708
- Lucy:
YEAH, BE STILL MY HEART.

168
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,708
- ( crowd cheering )

169
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,000
- HERE WE GO!

170
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,541
- PLEASE DON'T MAKE US
WAIT ANY LONGER!

171
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,291
- YEAH, JUST TELL US ALREADY!

172
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:45,041
- I'M STILL SO LOST.
TELL US WHAT NOW?

173
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:49,000
- AHEM, IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD'S

174
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,708
TIME HONORED TRADITION,
I WILL NOW ANNOUNCE

175
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:56,166
THIS YEARS ENTRANTS FOR THE
S-CLASS WIZARD PROMOTION TRIAL!

176
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,666
- ( crowd cheers )

177
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,166
- THIS IS WHY EVERYONE'S
BEEN ACTING CRAZY LATELY.

178
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,791
- I'M ALL FIRED UP NOW!

179
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,958
- Erza:
PLEASE BE QUIET, EVERYONE.

180
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,958
- SHUT UP AND LET THE MASTER
FINISH TALKING.

181
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,041
- THE TRIAL THIS YEAR WILL
TAKE PLACE ON TENROU ISLAND.

182
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:17,791
OUR GUILD'S SACRED GROUND.

183
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,916
- ( crowd talking excitedly )

184
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,250
- DO YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT HE'S
GOING TO MAKE THEM DO?

185
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,958
- WELL, IT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT
EVERY YEAR.

186
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,208
- IT'S BASICALLY
A SERIOUSLY TOUGH JOB.

187
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,500
- BUT IF YOU'RE ABLE
TO PULL IT OFF,

188
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,625
HE'LL BUMP YOU UP
TO AN S-CLASS WIZARD.

189
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:33,458
- THE STRENGTH THAT YOU
POSSESS INSIDE, YOUR CHARACTER,

190
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,500
AND YOUR HEARTS.
THESE ARE WHAT I CONSIDERED

191
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,833
WHILE MAKING MY SELECTION.

192
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:41,166
AND I HAVE CHOSEN
EIGHT PARTICIPANTS.

193
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,000
- Makarov:
NATSU DRAGNEEL.

194
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,625
- THANK YOU, SIR.

195
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,166
- YOU'VE GOT THIS
IN THE BAG, BUDDY.

196
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,291
- Makarov:
GRAY FULLBUSTER.

197
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,291
- IT'S FINALLY MY TIME
TO  MOVE UP.

198
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,333
- Makarov:
JUVIA LOXAR.

199
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,541
- REALLY?
THE MASTER CHOSE ME?

200
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,041
- Makarov:
ELFMAN.

201
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,583
- S-CLASS DESERVES
A REAL MAN LIKE ME.

202
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,416
- BEST OF LUCK, BIG BROTHER.

203
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,833
- Makarov:
CANA ALBERONA.

204
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:12,083
- Makarov:
FRIED JUSTINE.

205
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,541
- SO I'LL BE FOLLOWING
IN LAXUS' FOOTSTEPS.

206
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,583
- Makarov:
LEVY MCGARDEN.

207
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,291
- I'M SO STOKED ABOUT THIS.

208
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,125
- ( both ) LEVY IS TOTALLY
GOING TO WIN THIS ONE!

209
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:24,041
- Makarov:
AND MEST GRYDER.

210
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,500
- Guild Member #1:
MEST!

211
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,500
- Guild Member #2: HE ALMOST
MADE S-CLASS LAST TIME.

212
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,666
- I WORKED SO HARD, SO WHY
DIDN'T HE PICK ME THIS YEAR?

213
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,708
- IT'S BOUND TO HAPPEN
SOME DAY, BUCK UP.

214
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:33,958
- Droy and Jet:
LEVY'S GOING TO BE--

215
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,291
- Max: WELL, MASTER
FINALLY CHOSE NATSU.

216
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,416
- Warren:
DON'T FORGET GRAY.

217
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,875
- I'M SO PROUD OF THOSE KIDS.

218
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,500
- I BET THEY'RE PRETTY EXCITED.

219
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,416
- WHEN I GROW UP, I'M GOING
TO BE AN S-CLASS WIZARD, TOO.

220
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,500
YOU JUST WATCH ME.

221
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,375
- Lucy:
I GET IT NOW,

222
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,625
EVERYONE WANTED MASTER
TO PICK THEM FOR THE TRIAL

223
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,416
SO THEY WORKED THEIR BUTTS OFF
TO IMPRESS HIM.

224
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,916
- I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT,
YOU GUYS!

225
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,708
- Lucy:
I WONDER...

226
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:01,750
IS THIS WHY SHE WAS TALKING
ABOUT QUITTING?

227
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,958
- ALTHOUGH EIGHT WIZARDS
HAVE BEEN SELECTED, 

228
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,000
ONLY ONE WILL EMERGE VICTORIOUS.

229
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,083
THE TRIAL WILL BEGIN
IN ONE WEEK'S TIME.

230
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,125
SO YOU'D BETTER STEP UP
YOUR PREPARATIONS.

231
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,041
- HE'S ONLY GOING TO CHOOSE ONE?

232
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,541
- I'D PUT MY MONEY
ON FRIED THIS YEAR.

233
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,750
- I'VE GOT TO GO WITH MEST.

234
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,416
- NATSU AND GRAY ARE
NO SLOUCHES.

235
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,291
- HOW COME HE PICKED JUVIA,
BUT I GET PASSED OVER?

236
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,541
I THOUGHT THE OLD MAN
LIKED ME MORE THAN HER.

237
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,166
- YOU SEEM TO HAVE
A SHADY REPUTATION

238
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,500
IN THE GUILD FOR SOME REASON.

239
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,708
I GET THE FEELING THEY DON'T
TRUST YOU VERY MUCH.

240
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,416
- THAT'S CRAZY!  THEY CAN ALL
TRUST ME JUST FINE!

241
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,666
- Gajeel:
I JUST CAN'T TELL THEM

242
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,875
WHAT I'M REALLY DOING
AROUND HERE.

243
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,333
- Pantherlily:
TAKE IT UP WITH ERZA.

244
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,291
- SORRY, BUT YOU'RE
NOT READY YET.

245
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,375
- THIS WHOLE THING SUCKS!

246
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:42,541
- AND AS USUAL,
EVERYBODY LOSES CONTROL.

247
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,208
- HEY, IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG,
CARLA?

248
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,791
- NO, I'M FINE.

249
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,958
SO STRANGE, WHAT WAS I SEEING?

250
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:11,208
WHO WAS THAT?

251
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:14,666
- Lucy: LITTLE DID I KNOW,
EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T CHOSEN

252
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,583
BY THE MASTER TO PARTICIPATE,

253
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:18,916
I WOULD STILL PLAY A ROLE.

254
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,791
AND SOMETHING ELSE UNEXPECTED
WOULD TAKE PLACE.

255
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,625
- Makarov: FOR THE BENEFIT
OF OUR NEWCOMERS,

256
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,166
LET'S GO OVER THE RULES
OF THE CHALLENGE, SHALL WE?

257
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,125
- THE EIGHT PARTICIPANTS
WILL EACH CHOOSE A PARTNER.

258
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,708
THIS PERSON WILL ALSO
BE ALLOWED TO TRAIN WITH THEM

259
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,541
DURING THE WEEK LEADING UP
TO THE EVENT.

260
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,041
- A PARTNER?

261
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,916
- YEAH, ULTIMATELY IT'S A BATTLE
BETWEEN TWO-PERSON TEAMS.

262
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,708
- A BIG PART OF IT IS PUTTING
THEIR FRIENDSHIPS

263
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,166
TO THE TEST AS WELL.

264
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,375
- OBSERVE THESE TWO RULES
WHEN CHOOSING YOUR PARTNER--

265
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:54,458
NUMBER ONE, THEY MUST BE
A MEMBER OF FAIRY TAIL.

266
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:57,833
AND NUMBER TWO, YOUR CHOICE
CANNOT BE AN S-CLASS WIZARD.

267
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,625
- HUH.

268
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,000
- BUT THAT ONLY RULES OUT
A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE.

269
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:05,041
NEITHER ERZA, MIRAJANE,
NOR GILDARTS CAN BE CHOSEN.

270
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,125
- GUESS A TEAM WITH
THOSE GUYS ON IT

271
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,000
WOULD BE PRETTY HARD TO BEAT.

272
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,041
- WE'LL REVEAL
ALL THE PARTICULAR DETAILS

273
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,833
OF THE TRIAL ONCE WE'VE ARRIVED
ON TENROU ISLAND.

274
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:17,000
BUT KNOW THAT YOU'LL HAVE TO GET
PAST ERZA TO CLAIM VICTORY.

275
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,708
- ( gasping )

276
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,208
- AND I'LL BE DOING MY VERY BEST

277
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,208
TO HELP WEED OUT THE REST OF YOU
RIGHT BESIDE HER.

278
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,000
- ( gasping )

279
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:27,000
- SO THE ONLY WAY SOMEBODY
CAN BECOME AN S-CLASS WIZARD

280
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,916
IS BY DEFEATING ERZA
AND MIRAJANE?

281
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,625
- BUT THE RUMOR HAS IT,
THEY'VE BEEN ORDERED

282
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,083
TO HOLD BACK A LITTLE BIT.

283
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,750
- I STILL DON'T ENVY ANYBODY
THAT HAS TO TAKE THEM ON.

284
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,750
- QUIT YOUR BELLYACHING.

285
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,083
THE THREE OF US
HAD TO GO THROUGH THIS TRIAL.

286
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,666
IT'S ONLY FAIR YOU DO, TOO.

287
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,000
- NO WAY, HE SAID,
"THE THREE OF US?"

288
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,416
- SWEET TUNA!

289
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,250
- I'M FINALLY GOING TO GET
TO FIGHT OLD MAN GILDARTS!

290
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,333
- THAT'S NOT GOOD NEWS!

291
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,166
- THE EIGHT PARTICIPANTS
I NAMED EARLIER

292
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,625
AND THEIR CHOSEN PARTNERS
ARE ASKED TO MEET

293
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,750
AT THE PORT OF HARGEON,
ONE WEEK FROM TODAY.

294
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,666
SO GET TO WORK.

295
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:04,500
- MAN, THEY SET THE BAR
CRAZY HIGH THIS YEAR.

296
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,541
- I'M KIND OF SURPRISED NONE
OF YOU HAVE EVER BEEN CHOSEN

297
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,166
FOR THIS THING BEFORE.

298
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,666
- Natsu: I'M READY FOR THE
BIG TIME. S-CLASS, HERE I COME!

299
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,750
- I KNOW I'M THE MANLIEST GUY
IN THE GUILD,

300
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,291
BUT I'M AS SCARED
AS A LITTLE GIRL RIGHT NOW!

301
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,916
- Wendy:
IT SURE SOUNDS TOUGH TO ME.

302
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,375
- Lisanna:
GOOD LUCK, EVERYBODY.

303
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,833
- I'LL BE COUNTING ON YOU.

304
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,833
- DON'T WORRY.  I'VE GOT
YOUR BACK, OLD BUDDY.

305
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:24,875
- Tommens:
THAT'S RIGHT.

306
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:25,958
- WE NEED AN S-CLASS MAN
IN OUR RANKS

307
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,250
NOW THAT LAXUS AIN'T AROUND.

308
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,708
HE'S GOT BIG SHOES TO FILL,

309
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,541
BUT I CAN'T THINK OF ANYONE
WHO COULD DO IT BETTER.

310
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,458
BESIDES, WE'VE GOT
TO SHOW EVERYONE

311
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,083
THE THUNDER LEGION'S
STILL GOT IT!

312
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,333
- Tommens:
REPRESENT!

313
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,625
- Lucy: WELL, IT
LOOKS LIKE FRIED'S PARTNER

314
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:37,916
IS GOING TO BE BIXLOW.

315
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,291
I THINK THEY'LL PROBABLY BE

316
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:40,666
A PRETTY TOUGH TEAM TO BEAT,
DON'T YOU?

317
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,666
- JEEZ, LUCY,
WAY TO BE ENCOURAGING.

318
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,458
- SPEAKING OF PARTNERS,

319
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,750
DO YOU GUYS KNOW WHO YOU'RE
GOING TO CHOOSE YET?

320
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,458
- I'M GOING WITH MY LITTLE
BUDDY, OF COURSE. - AYE!

321
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,416
- HEY, NOT SO FAST THERE PINKY.

322
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,416
IF THIS THING ENDS UP BEING
SOME KIND OF RACE,

323
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,875
HAVING A PARTNER THAT CAN FLY
IS AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE.

324
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,791
- WELL, IT SEEMS FAIR TO ME.

325
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,583
- Gray:
I'M COOL WITH IT TOO.

326
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,833
IF THIS ENDS BEING A BATTLE,
IT WILL BE A <i>DISADVANTAGE.</i>

327
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,125
- I'M SITTING RIGHT HERE,
YOU KNOW.

328
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,958
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS BECAUSE YOU
KNOW I'M GOING TO MAKE NATSU

329
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,250
AN S-CLASS WIZARD!

330
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,791
- WELL, YOU BETTER GET OVER IT.

331
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,500
'CAUSE THERE AIN'T NO WAY
YOU'RE BREAKING UP OUR TEAM.

332
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,083
- LET'S GO, PAL!

333
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,416
- SCREW A BUNCH
OF SITTING AROUND,

334
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,458
WE'VE GOT TRAINING TO DO!

335
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,625
- Happy:
AYE, SIR!

336
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:23,208
- I KNOW I'VE BEEN GONE
FOR TWO YEARS, BUT STILL--

337
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,416
I CAN'T BELIEVE NATSU'S
GOTTEN STRONG ENOUGH

338
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,625
TO BE IN THE RUNNING
FOR AN S-CLASS RANK.

339
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:31,916
- Lisanna: HE'S ALWAYS BELIEVED
THAT IF HE CAN BECOME

340
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,750
A MORE POWERFUL WIZARD, HE'LL
BE ABLE TO SEE IGNEEL AGAIN.

341
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,583
HE PROBABLY HAS TWICE
THE MOTIVATION FOR MOVING AHEAD

342
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:39,666
THAN ANYONE ELSE.

343
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,666
- MAYBE SO.

344
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,250
(thinking )
GOOD LUCK, NATSU.

345
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,416
YOU'LL SEE HIM SOMEDAY.

346
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,583
- I THINK I MIGHT
PREFER TO WITHDRAW

347
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:48,750
FROM THE TRIAL THIS YEAR.

348
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:49,958
- HUH? BUT, WHY?

349
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,791
- IT'S JUST...

350
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,458
I'D MUCH RATHER BE
SOMEBODY'S PARTNER THAN RIVAL.

351
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:55,875
- SAY WHAT?

352
00:14:55,958 --> 00:15:00,791
- WELL, I MEAN, IF I--
IF IT WERE MY CHOICE...

353
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:04,250
- IT'S OBVIOUS SHE'D RATHER
BE YOUR PARTNER. - YOU THINK?

354
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,458
- DON'T YOU DARE TRY
TO STEAL HIM AWAY FROM ME!

355
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,541
- I WOULD NEVER DO THAT!

356
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:08,958
- Juvia:
BE HONEST WITH ME GRAY,

357
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,166
WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE
THIS BLONDE BIMBO ON YOUR TEAM?

358
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,833
- SIMMER DOWN, OKAY?

359
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,083
I'VE ALREADY GOT SOMEONE
LINED UP. - YOU DO?

360
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,791
- LONG TIME NO SEE, YOU GUYS.

361
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,125
- YOU'RE USING
ONE OF MY SPIRITS?!

362
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,416
- SERIOUSLY?

363
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,333
- WE WORKED THIS WHOLE THING OUT
A YEAR AGO.

364
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,333
- PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS
TOO HARD, LUCY.

365
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,000
BUT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO PUT
A HOLD ON OUR CONTRACT

366
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:27,875
WHILE I TEAM UP WITH GRAY.

367
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,916
JUST IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING,

368
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,666
I USED MY OWN POWER IN ORDER
TO PASS THROUGH THE GATE.

369
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,375
SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT RUNNING OUT
OF MAGIC BECAUSE OF ME.

370
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,875
- 'KAY.

371
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,250
BUT I KIND OF WISH YOU WOULD
HAVE RUN THIS BY ME FIRST.

372
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,791
- ALRIGHT HAPPY, IT'S TIME
TO GET STARTED...

373
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:46,958
- ( both )
...ON SOME HARDCORE TRAINING!

374
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,458
- Natsu:
WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

375
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,166
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO START WITH.

376
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,500
- Happy:
 WELL, IT'S SNOWING RIGHT NOW

377
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,833
SO THE CHOICE IS
PRETTY CLEAR TO ME.

378
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,916
- RIGHT YOU ARE, OLD PAL.
LET THE TRAINING BEGIN!

379
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,666
WAIT, HOLD ON!

380
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,791
- FOR THE FIRST EXERCISE,

381
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,208
YOU'LL BE WORKING ON
DEFENSE TECHNIQUES

382
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,333
BY STOPPING THESE GIANT BOULDERS
USING ONLY YOUR BODY.

383
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,500
- CAN'T WE TRY
SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD?!

384
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,041
- Elfman:
WAIT A MINUTE, LOKE.

385
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,208
ARE YOU STILL A FULL-FLEDGED
MEMBER OF THE GUILD?

386
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,666
- Loke:
MM-HMM.

387
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,833
SEE?  I'M STILL
A PROUD FAIRY TAIL WIZARD.

388
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,791
AND AS SUCH, IT'S MY
DUTY TO HELP GRAY

389
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:15,541
REACH HIS FULL POTENTIAL

390
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,250
AND MAKE IT TO S-CLASS.

391
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,375
- I APPRECIATE THE HELP, BUDDY.
- I'VE GOT YOUR BACK.

392
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,208
- I DON'T REMEMBER THESE GUYS
BEING EACH OTHER'S "BFFs"

393
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,708
BEFORE TODAY.

394
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,041
- SO FEEL FREE TO COME AT ME
WITH EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT.

395
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:29,250
WE'LL GET HOT AND HEAVY LIKE
WE DID THE FIRST TIME WE MET.

396
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,916
- ( gasps )
HOT...

397
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,958
AND HEAVY?

398
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,041
WOW-WW.

399
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,750
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN HANDLE IT.

400
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:36,916
- EASY THERE, GIRL.

401
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,791
- HEY, I'LL BE
ON YOUR TEAM, JUVIA.

402
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,291
- YOU BARELY EVEN KNOW HER.

403
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,458
- ACTUALLY, ME AND THE JUVIA
BACK IN EDOLAS

404
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:43,958
CAME TO BE REALLY GOOD FRIENDS.

405
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,000
NOT THAT YOU'RE ANYTHING
LIKE HER.

406
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,708
YOU'RE A LOT SWEETER.

407
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,750
- YOU WOULD CHOOSE ME?

408
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,250
- SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

409
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,500
- I SUPPOSE SO. BUT I HAVE A
FEELING YOU'RE JUST USING ME

410
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,416
TO GET TO GRAY... - Lucy:
WHY IS SHE ALWAYS SO PARANOID?

411
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,583
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD
DO THIS TO ME, LITTLE SIS!

412
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:57,916
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE
YOUR OWN FLESH AND BLOOD

413
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,583
GO THROUGH THE TRIAL
WITHOUT A PARTNER?!

414
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,000
- NO.  YOU'VE BEEN GETTING
SUCH AN INTENSE STARE

415
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,208
I THOUGHT YOU ALREADY HAD
SOMEONE. - HUH?

416
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,666
( gasps )

417
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,500
- I THINK SHE MIGHT BE
A LITTLE UPSET

418
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,875
THAT FRIED TEAMED UP
WITH BIXLOW INSTEAD OF HER.

419
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:14,750
- SHE'S LOOKING RIGHT AT ME.

420
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,208
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

421
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:19,208
- Elfman: HER INTENSE STARE
IS ACTUALLY MORE LIKE...

422
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,916
...PETRIFYING!

423
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,125
- Happy:
HERE WE GO!

424
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,458
SPECIAL EXERCISE NUMBER 15
WILL DEFINITELY PUMP UP

425
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,458
THOSE SKINNY LEG MUSCLES!

426
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:28,916
HEY, YOU WANT TO TAKE
A BREAK, BIG GUY?

427
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,458
- INTENSE PAIN AIN'T
STOPPING ME!

428
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:31,958
LET'S MOVE ON
TO THE NEXT ONE, 'KAY?

429
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,583
- Happy:
SPECIAL EXERCISE NUMBER 16.

430
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:38,125
- GUESS I'D BETTER BE
HEADING TO TENROU ISLAND.

431
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,291
I'LL SEE YOU THERE, NATSU.

432
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,666
- THOSE S-CLASS HOTSHOTS
THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE

433
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,208
ABLE TO STAND IN MY WAY, HUH?

434
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,291
I'D LIKE TO SEE THEM TRY!

435
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,416
- Happy:
AYE, SIR!

436
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,666
- Jet:
MASTER CHOSE YOU!

437
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,000
- Droy: YOU'RE GOING TO BE
AN AMAZING S-CLASS WIZARD.

438
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,125
YOU'RE GOING TO PICK ME
TO BE YOUR PARTNER, AREN'T YOU?

439
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,208
- YOU? INSTEAD OF ME?

440
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,000
I'M A HUNDRED TIMES FASTER.

441
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,708
- Droy: BUT LET'S FACE IT,
I'M THE BETTER FIGHTER.

442
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,041
- Jet: WHATEVER, YOU'VE JUST
GOT A THING FOR LEVY.

443
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,916
- Droy:
OH, AND YOU DON'T?

444
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,083
- IF YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE
IT TO S-CLASS,

445
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:09,541
YOU SHOULD PICK ME INSTEAD
OF THOSE TWO CLOWNS.

446
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,958
- SERIOUSLY?

447
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,250
- I GET CHANCE TO BEAT UP
ON ALL THOSE OTHER IDIOTS

448
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,750
IF WE DO THIS, DON'T I?

449
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,500
- I GUESS THERE'S GOING TO BE
SOME FIGHTING INVOLVED.

450
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,500
BUT I'M SO PUNY AND WEAK.

451
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,625
WE'LL PROBABLY JUST LOSE
RIGHT AWAY.

452
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,125
- DON'T GO WIMPING OUT
BEFORE THE WHOLE THING

453
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,166
EVEN GETS STARTED, YOU HEAR?

454
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,708
- HEY, LET GO!
PLEASE, PUT ME DOWN!

455
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:29,541
- I'LL MAKE YOU BIGGER THAN
YOU'VE EVER BEEN, LITTLE GIRL.

456
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,416
- Wendy: HOW COME YOU'VE
BEEN SO QUIET TODAY?

457
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,041
I WISH YOU WOULD TELL ME
WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU.

458
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,583
- I'M NOT SURE.

459
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,083
I KEEP HAVING
THESE STRANGE VISIONS--

460
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,000
SOMETHING GOING WRONG
AT THE TRIAL.

461
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:06,708
I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE
ANY PART OF IT, UNDERSTAND?

462
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,000
- Wendy: DON'T WORRY, I DON'T
THINK ANYONE'S GOING TO PICK ME

463
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,083
TO BE THEIR PARTNER.

464
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,291
- Mest:
I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE

465
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,416
ABOUT THAT, SKY MAIDEN.

466
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,916
- OH, IT'S YOU.

467
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,083
WHO ARE YOU, AGAIN?

468
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:21,500
- MY NAME'S MEST GRYDER.

469
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,791
I WAS MYSTOGAN'S PUPIL.

470
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,583
- SOUP'S ON!
YOU READY TO EAT?

471
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:30,041
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG, NATSU?

472
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,958
- I'M FINALLY GETTING
MY BIG CHANCE.

473
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,083
AND I <i>WILL</i> BE 
AN S-CLASS WIZARD.

474
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:45,875
- Happy:
AYE.

475
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,875
- Lucy:
WHOA, CHECK IT OUT PLUE.

476
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,708
I DIDN'T THINK IT EVER SNOWED
IN MAGNOLIA.

477
00:19:56,125 --> 00:20:00,125
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
PASSED OUT IN THE ALLEYWAY?

478
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,625
- Cana:
AH-HH.

479
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,583
I OWE YOU ONE.
IF YOU HADN'T NOTICED ME

480
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,250
I WOULD HAVE FROZEN MY BUTT OFF
OUT THERE TONIGHT.

481
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,958
- NO JOKE, NOW YOU WANT TO TELL
ME WHY YOU'VE BEEN ACTING

482
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,541
LIKE SUCH A LUNATIC LATELY?

483
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,333
- YOU MEAN MIRA HASN'T
ALREADY TOLD YOU ABOUT IT?

484
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:17,166
I GET KIND OF CRAZY
AROUND S-CLASS TRIAL TIME.

485
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,791
IT HAPPENS EVERY YEAR.

486
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,541
- DOES THIS HAVE SOMETHING TO DO

487
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,500
WITH YOU SAYING THAT YOU WANT
TO QUIT THE GUILD?

488
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:28,291
- THIS WILL BE MY FIFTH TRIAL.

489
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,416
THAT MEANS I'VE TRIED
FOUR TIMES,

490
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,166
BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO GO ALL THE WAY.

491
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,375
BECAUSE I SUCK.
- OH, DON'T BE SILLY.

492
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:35,833
IS THAT ALL?

493
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,250
JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T
MADE IT YET

494
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,583
DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T.

495
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:42,041
- I'M THE ONLY PERSON
WHO'S FAILED FOUR TIMES.

496
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:46,458
THAT'S WHY THIS WILL BE
MY LAST ONE.

497
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:50,333
IF I DON'T PASS IT THIS TIME,
I'M GOING TO LEAVE FAIRY TAIL.

498
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:54,041
- HEY, NOW. THERE ARE PLENTY OF
GUILD MEMBERS

499
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,458
WHO AREN'T S-CLASS.

500
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,000
- WELL, I DON'T WANT TO BE
ONE OF THOSE LOSERS, OK?!

501
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,125
I HAVE TO BE AN S-CLASS WIZARD.

502
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:09,000
OR I'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO LOOK HIM IN THE EYE.

503
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,958
- ( melancholy music plays )

504
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,166
- ( music continues )

505
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,625
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

506
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:49,708
THAT'S WHY IF I DON'T
MAKE IT THIS TIME,

507
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,541
I'M QUITTING FAIRY TAIL
FOR GOOD.

508
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:55,625
MY MIND IS MADE UP.

509
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,833
- CANA, WILL YOU PLEASE
LET ME BE YOUR PARTNER?

510
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,208
FAIRY TAIL JUST WOULDN'T
BE THE SAME WITHOUT YOU.

511
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:03,208
I PROMISE, I CAN HELP YOU
BECOME AN S-CLASS WIZARD!

512
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,166
- ( trembling )

513
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,750
- THANK YOU.

514
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,375
- Male Narrator:
ONE WEEK LATER,

515
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:22,375
OUR CONTESTANTS GATHER
AT THE PORT OF HARGEON.

516
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:33,750
WITH THEIR HEARTS RACING
AND THEIR DREAMS ON THE LINE,

517
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:37,833
THEY BEGIN THE S-CLASS WIZARD
PROMOTION TRIAL.

518
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:40,333
BUT WHO WILL ADVANCE?

519
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,750
- ( theme music playing )

520
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:45,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

521
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,166
- ( laughing )

522
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,416
- Natsu: WHOA, WHAT'S
WITH THE CREEPY LOOK?

523
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,500
- Happy:
YOU WANT TO KNOW?

524
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:17,833
- Natsu:
EH, PROBABLY NOT, REALLY.

525
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,333
- Happy: THE STARS
HAVE ALIGNED IN MY FAVOR

526
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,958
AND TODAY I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
EXTREMELY LUCKY IN LOVE!

527
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,666
CANA READ MY FORTUNE EARLIER.
- Natsu: HUH.

528
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,416
- Happy: IF I CAN PULL OFF SOME
MAJORLY COOL STUFF IN THE TRIAL,

529
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,375
CARLA WILL FALL
HEAD-OVER-HEELS FOR ME!

530
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,625
- ( giggling )

531
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:33,750
- ( Happy and Natsu speaking )

532
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,500
- Natsu: YOU KNOW CARLA ISN'T
EVEN GOING TO BE THERE,

533
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:36,916
DON'T YOU?

534
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,958
- Happy:
WHAT-TT?!

535
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,416
OH, MAN!

536
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,750
- Natsu:
I GUESS ALL THAT GOOD LUCK

537
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:41,833
IS GOING TO GO TO WASTE, PAL.
