1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,458
- WITH THE 88 HEAVENLY BODIES.

2
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:24,791
SHINING!
URANOMETRIA!

3
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:30,250
( screaming )

4
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:37,416
- ( theme music playing )

5
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,958
- ( singing in Japanese )

6
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,375
- ( water splashing )

7
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:08,750
- ( gasping )

8
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:11,375
DID I JUST WIN?

9
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,250
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

10
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:16,791
HIBIKI!

11
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,166
HAPPY!

12
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,250
NATSU,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

13
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,166
- ( panting )

14
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:30,541
- I WILL NOT LOSE!

15
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,625
- ( computerized beeping )

16
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:35,208
- I'M ONE OF THE ORACION SEIS.

17
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,291
YOU NEVER STOOD A CHANCE.

18
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:43,541
- ( Happy speaking )

19
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,458
- Lucy: WHAT'S GOING ON?

20
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,916
IT FEELS LIKE
ALL MY STRENGTH WAS DRAINED.

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,583
AND WHY DOES SHE LOOK LIKE SHE
FOUGHT A TORNADO HEAD ON?

22
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,750
- I'LL USE
THE LAST OF MY POWER

23
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:01,208
TO SEND YOU TO THE GRAVE!

24
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,166
NO.
YOU MISSED!

25
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,208
FILTHY TRAITOR.

26
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,750
- ( beeping )

27
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,916
- ( shivering )

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,291
- HANG ON!

29
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:26,375
- Angel: WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I PRAYED FOR?

30
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,791
WHAT I WANTED
MORE THAN ANYTHING...

31
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:38,208
WAS TO VANISH,
INTO THE HEAVENS,

32
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:43,041
LIKE AN ANGEL,
PURE AND WHITE.

33
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,208
BUT I KEEP ENDING UP
ALL WET!

34
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:50,916
- IT'S MOVING TOO FAST.

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,583
- ( mumbling )

36
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,750
- YOU'VE GOTTA
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER.

37
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,500
COME ON, I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.

38
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:58,916
TAKE MY HAND!

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,541
GOT YA!

40
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,250
- Both: OH!

41
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:10,875
- Lucy: AHH! WHERE DID
THESE RAPIDS COME FROM?

42
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,166
OH, NO WAY.

43
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,833
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!

44
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,083
NATSU!

45
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,958
- ( bell dings )

46
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,958
- THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.

47
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:49,500
ANGEL HAS ALSO
BEEN DEFEATED?

48
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:53,291
MARK MY WORDS,
I SHALL AVENGE YOU ALL.

49
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:57,333
SOON THE LIGHT OF THIS WORLD
WILL COME CRASHING DOWN.

50
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:05,000
- I'M STILL ALIVE,
YOU KNOW.

51
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,333
- Erza: JELLAL.

52
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,208
HE'S COME BACK.

53
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,041
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

54
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:34,625
AND WHY DID HE SHOW UP HERE,
OF ALL PLACES?

55
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,666
- Young Jellal:
LET'S GO, OKAY?

56
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,375
- Jellal: THERE IS NO HEAVEN,

57
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:46,375
NOR DOES TRUE FREEDOM
REALLY EXIST.

58
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:50,583
- Young Jellal:
SHE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!

59
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,958
- I WISH I KNEW WHAT I'M
SUPPOSED TO BE

60
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,208
FEELING RIGHT NOW.

61
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,125
- Jura: HOLD ON.

62
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,166
SO WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME
IS THAT NIRVANA'S MAGIC

63
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,083
ACTUALLY ALTERS THE
PERSONALITIES

64
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,208
OF THOSE IT AFFECTS?

65
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,541
- PRECISELY RIGHT.
OH YEAH.

66
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,291
WITHIN ITS AREA OF EFFECT,
THAT BLACK LIGHT

67
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,333
WILL FORCIBLY CHANGE
ANYONE WHOSE HEART

68
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,333
IS TEETERING ON THE EDGE
OF GOOD AND EVIL

69
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:18,208
TO THE OPPOSITE OF THEIR
USUAL NATURE. OH YEAH.

70
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,291
- IF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS TRUE,
THAT WOULD MEAN

71
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:23,125
YOU WERE WAVERING BETWEEN LIGHT
AND DARKNESS YOURSELF.

72
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,125
- I WAS NEVER TRULY EVIL
TO BEGIN WITH.

73
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,000
AND I COULD NO LONGER
CONVINCE MYSELF

74
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,833
WHAT I WAS DOING WAS NOBLE.
OH YEAH.

75
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,875
- I DON'T SEE HOW YOU COULD
EVER JUSTIFY WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

76
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,583
- WHEN YOU'VE LOST A LOVED ONE,

77
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,125
YOU CAN JUSTIFY ANYTHING,
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?

78
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:45,041
MY ONLY GOAL WAS TO FIND
MY LONG-LOST BROTHER.

79
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:48,458
TO DO THAT, I NEEDED HEAPS
AND HEAPS OF MONEY.

80
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,583
OH YEAH.

81
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,500
WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU,

82
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,666
ALL OF MY PRECIOUS MEMORIES
CAME CRASHING TO THE SURFACE.

83
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,833
- LET ME GUESS--
I BEAR A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE

84
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,833
TO THIS LONG LOST BROTHER
OF YOURS?

85
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,833
- HMM HMM! QUITE HONESTLY,
YOU LOOK LIKE A POTATO

86
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,250
MY BROTHER AND I
ONCE SPLIT TOGETHER.

87
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,375
- DON'T TELL ME THAT!
- ONWARD.

88
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,208
LET'S STOP BRAIN AND HIS
MINIONS TOGETHER, FOR LOVE!

89
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:12,000
OH YEAH! 
- UM, SURE.

90
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,083
- HAVING TROUBLE?

91
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,666
- IT'S LIKE MY MAGIC
HAS NO EFFECT ON YOU.

92
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,875
BUT I HAVE TO KEEP TRYING.

93
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,416
AIR MAGIC, AERIAL SHOT!

94
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,416
YOU'RE GOIN' DOWN!

95
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,458
YOU'VE GOTTA
BE KIDDING ME!

96
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,083
AHH!

97
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,500
NO.

98
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,583
WHY COULDN'T I HIT YOU?

99
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,375
- HMM.  TWO DOWN.

100
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,125
THESE GUYS ARE SO PITIFUL.

101
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,541
COME ON.
THIS IS THE BEST THEY'VE GOT?

102
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:55,125
- MAYBE I SHOULDN'T
HAVE JOINED THE ALLIANCE.

103
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,333
- CHILD,
STOP BEATING YOURSELF UP.

104
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,708
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.
- YES, IT WAS.

105
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,916
- YOU'RE PLAYING
WITH FIRE, WENDY.

106
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,500
NIRVANA COULD CHANGE YOUR HEART
AT ANY MOMENT.

107
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,958
- I'M A COWARD.

108
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,708
I LEFT LUCY
AND THE OTHERS

109
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,791
INSTEAD OF STAYING
TO FIGHT WITH THEM.

110
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,916
- YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO
THAT IF YOU HAD STAYED,

111
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,291
YOU WOULD ONLY BE IN THE WAY.

112
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,250
- Wendy: SEE?
I SHOULDN'T HAVE COME.

113
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,416
- DON'T YOU DARE SAY THAT.

114
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,541
REMEMBER, IF YOU HADN'T BEEN
HERE, THEY WOULD'VE LOST ERZA.

115
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,333
- YEAH.

116
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:26,208
BUT THE ORACION SEIS
FOUND NIRVANA BECAUSE OF ME.

117
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,291
- IS IT REALLY ALL THAT BAD,
CHILD?

118
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,833
I SENSE PART OF YOU IS GLAD
TO SEE THAT JELLAL FELLOW AGAIN,

119
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,166
THOUGH I'M NOT SURE WHY.
- ( sighs )

120
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,666
- AND WHILE
WE'RE ON THAT SUBJECT,

121
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,833
WOULD YOU CARE TO EXPLAIN
WHO HE IS?

122
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,208
YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT OWING
HIM YOUR LIFE. BUT I'M CONFUSED.

123
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,375
IF HE'S SO IMPORTANT, WHY HAVE
YOU NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT HIM?

124
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:47,208
- IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.
IT JUST NEVER CAME UP.

125
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:50,625
I MET HIM SEVEN YEARS AGO

126
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:54,625
NOT LONG AFTER SKY DRAGON
GRANDINA DISAPPEARED.

127
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:59,333
HE FOUND ME SCARED, ALONE,
AND WANDERING AIMLESSLY.

128
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,500
- GRANDINA!
WHERE'D YOU GO?

129
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,583
PLEASE, COME BACK.

130
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:07,541
( sobbing )

131
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,833
- WHY ARE YOU CRYING?

132
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:32,333
- SHE LEFT ME.
( crying )

133
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,291
SHE LEFT ME ALL ALONE!

134
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,000
- Wendy:
THAT'S HOW WE MET.

135
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,166
HE SAID HE WAS ON HIS OWN TOO

136
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,500
AND HE ASKED IF I WANTED
TO JOIN HIM ON HIS JOURNEY.

137
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:56,208
WE TRAVELED TOGETHER
FROM THAT DAY FORWARD.

138
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,333
WE DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE WE WERE GOING,

139
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,916
BUT I DON'T THINK
WE REALLY CARED.

140
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,833
- YOU CAME BACK!

141
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,833
- I NORMALLY
DON'T LIKE RAINY DAYS,

142
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:16,833
BUT FOR SOME REASON THIS DOESN'T
BOTHER ME AT ALL. HUNGRY?

143
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,375
- WOW!  HOW WERE YOU ABLE
TO FIND SO MUCH FOOD?

144
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,500
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

145
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,750
YOU READY TO CHOW DOWN?
- MM-HMM!

146
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,916
- HOLD ON A SECOND.

147
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,208
- THAT'S WAY BETTER.

148
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,458
- WHICH WAY
 DO YA THINK WE SHOULD GO?

149
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,916
- I DON'T KNOW. THERE'S TONS
OF PLACES WE COULD GO.

150
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,708
- I'M FINE GOING ANYWHERE
AS LONG AS IT'S WITH YOU.

151
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,500
- SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

152
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,791
- ( giggles )

153
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:20,375
- Wendy: THEN ONE DAY,
HE STARTED ACTING STRANGE.

154
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,208
- ANIMA!

155
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,458
- WHAT?
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

156
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,458
BUT WHY--
I WANNA STAY WITH YOU.

157
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,041
- YOU CAN'T.
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS, ALL RIGHT?

158
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,458
- DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?
I'LL FIX IT.

159
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,625
PLEASE, JELLAL,
DON'T LEAVE ME.

160
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:43,375
- THERE'S A GUILD ACROSS THE
FOREST WHERE YOU'LL BE SAFE.

161
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,916
WE'LL STOP THERE, BUT THEN
WE'LL HAVE TO PART WAYS.

162
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,625
- NO!

163
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,458
- WENDY, COME ON.
- NO!

164
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,166
- Wendy:
WHEN WE GOT BEYOND THE FOREST,

165
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,333
HE LEFT ME
WITH THE CAIT SHELTER GUILD.

166
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,041
I'VE BEEN THERE EVER SINCE.

167
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,666
- SO WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM
AFTER YOU PARTED WAYS?

168
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,708
- THAT WAS THE LAST TIME
I EVER SAW HIM.

169
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,833
BUT I DID HEAR RUMORS
NOW AND THEN.

170
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,625
FIRST PEOPLE SAID THERE WAS A
COUNCIL MEMBER

171
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:10,708
WHO LOOKED LIKE HIM.

172
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,208
AND THE MOST RECENT ONES
WERE ALL ABOUT

173
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,458
HOW HE WAS DOING
THESE INCREDIBLY EVIL DEEDS.

174
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,291
SO SILLY.

175
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,833
HE'D NEVER THINK ABOUT
DOING SUCH HORRIBLE THINGS.

176
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,625
I WONDER--

177
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:24,625
DO YOU THINK HE REMEMBERS ME
ANYMORE?

178
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,791
- Cobra: NO.
SHE SURVIVED?  IMPOSSIBLE.

179
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,833
WHY WASN'T I ABLE
TO SENSE HER APPROACHING?

180
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,166
I CAN'T LET HER
TAKE JELLAL DOWN

181
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,333
BEFORE NIRVANA
IS FULLY ACTIVATED.

182
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,541
- JELLAL.

183
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,250
- ERZA.

184
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:21,250
- NOW TELL ME,
HOW DID YOU END UP HERE?

185
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,458
- I CAN'T ANSWER THAT.

186
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,916
ERZA.

187
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,416
WHO IS THAT?

188
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,958
I HAVE NO MEMORY.

189
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,916
AND YET I REMEMBER THAT NAME.

190
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,500
I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM

191
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,708
OR WHERE I CAME FROM.

192
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,416
CAN YOU TELL ME?

193
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,875
DO YOU KNOW?

194
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:51,208
AT LEAST TELL ME
WHO ERZA IS.

195
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:55,250
PLEASE, IF YOU KNOW,
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME.

196
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,166
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

197
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,458
HIS MEMORY'S
BEEN WIPED CLEAN?

198
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,625
- OH, JELLAL.

199
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,666
- AHHH!  WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING, GRAY?!

200
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,583
DON'T YOU WORRY CARLA,
MY LOVE.

201
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,500
YOU JUST HURRY
AND GET WENDY TO SAFETY

202
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,500
AND LET THE CATMANDER
TAKE CARE OF SAVING HIS BUDDY!

203
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,625
HUH?
THERE'S NOT EVEN ANYBODY AROUND!

204
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,208
AND I WAS SOUNDING
TOTALLY MACHO TOO.

205
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:31,166
- Jellal: PLEASE, IF YOU KNOW,
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME.

206
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:37,208
- Cobra: YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
HIS MEMORY'S BEEN WIPED CLEAN?

207
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,500
- JELLAL.

208
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,541
- STAY BACK!

209
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,416
- ALL RIGHT,
THEN YOU COME TO ME.

210
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,125
I'M THE PERSON
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

211
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,750
I AM ERZA.

212
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,666
AND YOU ARE JELLAL.

213
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,958
THERE WAS A TIME
WHEN WE WERE CLOSE FRIENDS.

214
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,750
- WE WERE?

215
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:15,500
- YES, BUT THAT WAS BEFORE
YOU BECAME DERANGED,

216
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:19,000
DESECRATED THE DEAD,
HURT MY FRIENDS,

217
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,875
DESTROYED THE MAGIC COUNCIL

218
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,666
AND KILLED SIMON.

219
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,416
IF YOU TRY--

220
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,625
IF YOU EVEN DARE FORGET
THE PAIN YOU'VE CAUSED,

221
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:35,125
I'LL TAKE MY SWORD TO YOUR HEART
AND ENGRAVE IT THERE!

222
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,166
NOW COME TO ME.
FACE YOUR ATONEMENT!

223
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:44,583
- I DID THAT TO MY COMRADES?

224
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,375
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

225
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,666
PLEASE, NO.

226
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,916
TELL ME IT'S NOT TRUE.

227
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,458
TELL ME.

228
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,708
HOW CAN I MAKE AMENDS?

229
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:03,541
- IS THIS THE SAME JELLAL?

230
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,708
- WHO DID THIS?

231
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,583
QUESTION TWO--
WHO CHANGED MY CLOTHES?

232
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,125
- I THOUGHT GARMENTS FROM THE
CELESTIAL WORLD WOULD SUIT YOU.

233
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,166
AS FOR WHO CHANGED YOU,
THAT WOULD BE ME.

234
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,250
- VIRGO?

235
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,916
- ( grunts )

236
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
OKAY, NOW WHERE AM I?

237
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:37,000
- I ALSO PROVIDED SIR NATSU
WITH A MATCHING SET.

238
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,208
- TOTALLY NOT NECESSARY.
- I'M WASTING TIME HERE.

239
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,958
WHERE'S THAT WEIRD
LIGHT THINGY?

240
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:48,000
- Lucy: WELL, WE'RE CLOSER, BUT
IT LOOKS DIFFERENT THAN BEFORE.

241
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,500
- Virgo: YES, THE LIGHT
CHANGED FROM BLACK TO WHITE

242
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,666
WHILE THE TWO OF YOU
WERE UNCONSCIOUS.

243
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,541
- ( exhaling )

244
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,875
- ( gasps )

245
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,500
- THANKS A LOT FOR SAVING MY
BUTT BACK THERE, LUCY.

246
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:07,500
- UH, YEAH, SURE,
DON'T MENTION IT.

247
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,291
- SHE LOVES YOU.

248
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,416
- DON'T COPY
THAT STUPID CAT AGAIN!

249
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,333
- SPEAKING OF WHICH,
WHERE IS HAPPY?

250
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,958
- I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.

251
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,666
- NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT,
WASN'T A CERTAIN BLONDE

252
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,083
SUPPOSED TO STAY WITH ERZA?

253
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,750
- I WAS,
BUT WE GOT SPLIT UP.

254
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,916
- THEN WHY ARE WE
STANDING AROUND WASTING TIME

255
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,708
WHEN WE SHOULD BE RUNNING
TOWARD THE LIGHT?

256
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,666
- I'M HAPPY I COULD SERVE YOU,
PRINCESS.

257
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,375
UNTIL NEXT TIME.
- WAIT!

258
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:31,250
THAT'S RIGHT,
I DIDN'T SUMMON HER.

259
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,208
SHE MUST HAVE CROSSED OVER
USING HER OWN POWER.

260
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:37,416
DOES THAT MEAN I USED UP
ALL OF MINE?

261
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,000
AHH!

262
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,958
SHERRY!
- ( Sherry moans )

263
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,500
- I'M GLAD YOU'RE ALL RIGHT,
BUT DID YOU HAVE SCARE ME?

264
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,000
- HEY, I KNOW YOU.

265
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,041
WEREN'T YOU
ON BIG TUNA ISLAND?

266
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,541
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THAT DOG
AND THE DUDE WITH THE EYEBROWS?

267
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,500
- GALUNA ISLAND,
AND YOU'VE SEEN HER SINCE THEN.

268
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,041
- IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

269
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,083
YOU FAIRY TAIL MEMBERS
ARE TO BLAME.

270
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,291
- EXCUSE ME?

271
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,416
- ( laughs )

272
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:12,250
- I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU!
- ( gasping )

273
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,208
- IS SHE OKAY?

274
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,291
- I THINK SHE MIGHT
BE POSSESSED.

275
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,166
- GET OFF OF ME! YOU'LL PAY FOR
WHAT YOU DID TO MY LOVE.

276
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,000
YOU'LL NEVER
LEAVE THIS FOREST.

277
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,458
- SHE'S BEEN ACTING STRANGE
SINCE THAT LIGHT SHOWED UP.

278
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,208
HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING WEIRD?

279
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,875
- YEAH, AND I OWE YOU
A KICK IN THE TEETH

280
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,666
FOR THAT LITTLE TRICK
YOU PULLED. - HUH?

281
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,916
- NATSU, THAT WASN'T REALLY GRAY
BACK THERE.

282
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,250
- YOU WON'T ESCAPE ME.

283
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,625
I SWEAR ON MY LIFE
I'LL AVENGE HIM.

284
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,208
- AVENGE ME FOR WHAT, EXACTLY?

285
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:40,041
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU HAD
MORE FAITH IN ME THAN THAT.

286
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,208
- IS IT REALLY YOU?

287
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,791
- OF COURSE, HE'S A WHOLE
LOT TOUGHER THAN HE LOOKS.

288
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:48,166
- Lyon: IT WAS CLOSER
THAN I'D CARE TO ADMIT.

289
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,708
EVEN AFTER I PUT SOME DISTANCE
BETWEEN US AND THE BOMB,

290
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,500
I SPENT EVERYTHING I HAD
KEEPING THE BLAST AT BAY.

291
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,541
IT TOOK ME A WHILE
TO RECOVER.

292
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,583
- Lucy: SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAD
AS ROUGH A TIME AS WE DID.

293
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,208
- WOW, NATSU,
WHERE'D YOU FIND THAT GET-UP?

294
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,541
- WHY, YOU JEALOUS?

295
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,291
- I SERIOUSLY DOUBT
THAT'S THE CASE.

296
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,000
- OH, MY LOVE.

297
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,750
- WHOA, WHAT'S THAT?

298
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:18,250
- I TOLD YOU GUYS SHE SEEMED
LIKE SHE WAS POSSESSED.

299
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,041
- NO KIDDING.

300
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,208
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

301
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,083
- IT APPEARS THAT THE BLACK
HAS VANISHED FROM THE PILLAR.

302
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:33,041
- I WONDER IF THAT'S A GOOD
OR A BAD SIGN.

303
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,250
- PLEASE!
WAKE UP!

304
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,791
HIBIKI!
WE'VE GOT TO HELP THE OTHERS.

305
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:41,125
BE SAFE, YOU GUYS.
I SWEAR I'LL BE THERE SOON.

306
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:46,208
NATSU, ERZA.

307
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,791
- Cobra:
IF YOU'VE LOST YOUR MEMORY,

308
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,083
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY
I COULDN'T HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS.

309
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:56,541
BUT NOW I'VE GOT A WHOLE SLEW
OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU TO ANSWER.

310
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,500
- I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
WE WERE BEING WATCHED.

311
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,041
- I'D LIKE TO KNOW
HOW YOU FOUND NIRVANA.

312
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,083
BUT EVEN MORE THAN THAT,

313
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:08,666
I WANNA KNOW
HOW YOU BROKE ITS SEAL.

314
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,500
- WHILE I WAS UNCONSCIOUS,

315
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,666
I HEARD A VOICE.

316
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,666
"I MUST HAVE NIRVANA",
IT WOULD SAY.

317
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,791
IT'S STRANGE,
BUT WHEN I WOKE UP,

318
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,958
I KNEW PRECISELY
WHERE TO FIND IT.

319
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,666
SOMEHOW I COULD ALSO SENSE

320
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:28,041
HOW INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS
AND POWERFUL IT IS.

321
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,625
AND SO I DECIDED

322
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,708
TO BREAK NIRVANA'S SEAL,
TO OBLITERATE IT.

323
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:37,458
- HOW DO YOU INTEND
TO DESTROY SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

324
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:40,833
- I'VE RIGGED THIS MONSTROSITY
WITH A SELF-DESTRUCTION CIRCLE.

325
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:44,791
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE NIRVANA CRUSHES ITSELF.

326
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:57,208
- I'VE NEVER SEEN A MAGIC CIRCLE
WITH THIS KIND OF COMPLEXITY.

327
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,500
IF I CAN'T FIND A WAY
TO STOP THIS,

328
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,125
WE'LL LOSE EVERYTHING.

329
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,125
SPILL IT, JELLAL!

330
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,916
TELL ME HOW TO DISARM IT
OR I'LL BEAT IT OUT OF YOU.

331
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,625
- ( grunts )

332
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,750
ERZA.

333
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,958
WHENEVER I HEAR THAT NAME,
A CALMNESS WASHES OVER ME.

334
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,500
( coughing )

335
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,208
CHEERFULNESS,

336
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,958
KINDNESS,

337
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,416
FIERCE UNWAVERING LOYALTY.

338
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:30,250
I HAVE NO DOUBT
YOU'LL CONTINUE TO DESPISE ME.

339
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,291
BELIEVE ME,
I DON'T BLAME YOU.

340
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,083
I WOULD PROBABLY FEEL
THE SAME.

341
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,625
IF I AM TRULY YOUR FRIEND,

342
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,666
THEN I CAN'T ALLOW
THAT HATRED

343
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,083
TO KEEP ROBBING YOU
OF YOUR FREEDOM. ( grunts )

344
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:47,875
- BUT WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

345
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,875
- ( sighs )

346
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:54,333
I'M SORRY YOU'VE SUFFERED
BECAUSE OF ME.

347
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,708
I'LL DO EVERYTHING I CAN
TO MAKE IT RIGHT.

348
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:00,625
- YOU DIDN'T.

349
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:04,541
- BE FREE, ERZA,
FROM YOUR HATRED.

350
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,250
ESCAPE YOUR PAST.

351
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:09,500
I WILL TAKE YOUR PAIN

352
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:12,291
AND YOUR SADNESS--

353
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:15,250
ALL OF IT.
THEY CANNOT SHACKLE YOU.

354
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,375
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE'S GONNA GO THROUGH WITH IT.

355
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:22,250
HE'S SERIOUSLY
GONNA SACRIFICE HIMSELF.

356
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:29,375
- FAREWELL, ERZA.

357
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:37,166
- Erza: JELLAL!

358
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,333
- ( end theme playing )

359
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:50,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

360
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:14,250
- Happy: OH NO, WHAT'LL WE DO?

361
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,250
NIRVANA'S BEEN
FULLY ACTIVATED.

362
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,291
- Natsu: AND IT'S GOT LOTS
OF LEGS. WHOA!

363
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,375
THAT THING TOTALLY LOOKS
LIKE A MONSTER OCTOPUS.

364
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:21,875
- WHAT?  YOU'RE CRAZY.

365
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:23,666
- ALL RIGHT THEN,
HOW ABOUT A SQUID?

366
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,375
- SURE, WHATEVER.
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME,

367
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:26,958
SO LET'S JUST
"SQUID" TALKING AND HURRY.

368
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:28,958
- OH, I SEE
WHAT YOU DID THERE, HAPPY!

369
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:30,583
NICE ONE. 
- HUH?

370
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:32,500
- ( Happy and Natsu speaking )

371
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:35,041
- Happy:
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY THAT,

372
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:37,166
IT'S JUST 'CAUSE YOU SAID IT
FIRST. - I'VE GOT NO PROBLEM

373
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,125
TAKING THE BLAME
FOR THAT COMEDY GOLD.

374
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:41,500
- NATSU, I DON'T THINK
WE CAN BE FRIENDS ANYMORE.
