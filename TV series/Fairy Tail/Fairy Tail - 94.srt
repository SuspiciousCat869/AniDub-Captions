SEE WHAT?

AND EXECUTE ME FOR MY CRIMES.

45

47
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,375
YOU CAN QUELL THE CHAOS.

48
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,416
BECOME THEIR SAVIOR!

00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,708
YOU ARE THE RULER THEY NEED,

LEAD THE PEOPLE INTO A WORLD
WITHOUT MAGIC.

51
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,500
- DO YOU REALLY THINK

52
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,041
THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE
THIS KINGDOM

53
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,708
IS FOR YOU TO DIE?

- YOU MAY THINK
THAT THIS IS MADNESS,

58
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,125
BUT IT'S OUR ONLY CHOICE.

59
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,583
- ( groans )

60
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,250
- BUT PRINCE,
THIS FOOLISH PLAN--

61
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,916
HOW COULD YOU ASK THIS OF ME?

62
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,541
- Pantherlily:
I SIMPLY CANNOT DO IT!

63
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,208
- Mystogan:
I THINK YOU CAN.

64
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:11,166
- THEN YOU OBVIOUSLY
DON'T KNOW ME.

65
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,125
- DESPITE THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE AN EXCEED,

66
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,208
YOU CHOSE TO SAVE THE LIFE
OF A HELPLESS HUMAN CHILD.

67
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:21,083
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT LIFE HAS
VALUE FOR EVERY LIVING CREATURE,

68
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:24,041
REGARDLESS OF WHAT FORM
THEY TAKE.

69
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,750
- AND STILL YOU'D BURDEN ME?

70
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,208
MAKE ME CARRY THE WEIGHT
OF THIS WORLD ON MY SHOULDERS?

71
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,375
- YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO COULD BEAR THAT WEIGHT.

72
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,708
THERE'S NO ONE ELSE.

73
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:37,375
AND I'M AFRAID THERE IS
NO OTHER WAY.

74
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:41,208
- YOU ARE PRINCE OF THIS WORLD.
THE ONE MOST SUITED TO RULE.

75
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:45,000
- I AM THE DESTROYER
OF THIS WORLD.

76
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,000
- YOU'VE TAKEN
EXTREME MEASURES TO SAVE IT.

77
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,750
YOU'RE EVEN WILLING TO PUT
YOUR OWN LIFE ON THE LINE.

78
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,416
WE NEED SOMEONE WITH THAT KIND
OF HEART TO TAKE THE HELM.

79
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,875
STEER US OUT OF THIS DARKNESS!

80
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:59,541
YOU CANNOT BREAK THIS WORLD,
AND THEN LEAVE IT TO OTHERS

81
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,541
TO PICK UP THE PIECES.

82
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,458
<i>YOU</i> MUST MAKE IT WHOLE AGAIN.
IT'S <i>YOUR</i> RESPONSIBILITY.

83
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,000
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE IT IN DEATH!

84
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,583
- Mystogan: THIS STORM
CANNOT BE QUELLED BY ME.

85
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:15,083
- WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
TO US, MOMMY? I'M SCARED!

86
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:18,125
- WE'RE GOING TO BE OKAY,
I PROMISE WE WILL.

87
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,083
- ( running )

88
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,583
- COME ON, EVERYBODY.
JUST CALM DOWN!

89
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,541
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
IN A TIME LIKE THIS?

90
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,833
I'D START RUNNING NOW
IF I WERE YOU, LADY.

91
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,708
THIS PLACE IS HISTORY!

92
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,375
- IS HE SERIOUS?

93
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:36,958
- WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT
OF HERE RIGHT NOW!

94
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,750
- DADDY!

95
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:39,875
- OH, THERE YOU ARE!

96
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,791
- KEEP YOUR EYES ON YOUR KID,
OKAY?

97
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:00,333
- Pantherlily:
I'LL DO IT.

98
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,791
I WILL PLAY THE ROLE OF VILLAIN.

99
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,166
- ( explosion )

100
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,541
- THE WHOLE THING'S
BLOWN TO PIECES!

101
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,625
- OUR POOR, LITTLE HOUSE
IS GONE.

102
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,500
- NOW THE BOY HAS NO PLACE
TO COME HOME TO.

103
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:21,625
IT'S AN OUTRAGE!
AN OUTRAGE!

104
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,041
- Pantherlily: WHEN I
WAS EXILED BY MY HOMELAND,

105
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,666
THE KINGDOM TOOK ME IN.

106
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:35,375
BUT NOW, I'VE RUN AFOUL
OF THE KINGDOM AS WELL.

107
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:38,166
I'M A MAN WITH NOWHERE
TO CALL HOME.

108
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,625
IF I'M TO BE SACRIFICED,

109
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,708
THERE'S NO ONE TO MOURN ME.

110
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,083
- PLEASE, STOP.

111
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:47,875
YOU GAVE ME THE GIFT OF LIFE.

112
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,083
I COST YOU YOUR COUNTRY!

113
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,833
I CANNOT ASK YOU
TO SACRIFICE ANYMORE.

114
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,458
- I FEEL THE SAME AS YOU.

115
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,708
PLEASE, DO NOT THROW
YOUR LIFE AWAY.

116
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:02,833
MORE DEATH WILL ONLY LEAD
TO MORE SORROW.

117
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,375
AND MUCH MORE SUFFERING.

118
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:09,083
- PERHAPS.  THEN HOW DO YOU
SUGGEST WE MAKE THINGS RIGHT?

119
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:13,083
I'VE ONLY CAUSED MORE PAIN.

120
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,125
- PANTHERLILY, SIR.
THE SITUATION'S MUCH WORSE.

121
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,541
- I'M AWARE OF THAT.

122
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:21,125
AS YOU CAN SEE, WE'RE DEALING
WITH THE ANIMA, HERE.

123
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,375
- HAVE YOU STOPPED IT?

124
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,500
- NO, NOT EXACTLY.

125
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,458
- THERE'S BEEN MASSIVE RIOTING
IN THE ROYAL CITY.

126
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:31,625
THE DESTRUCTION IS BEYOND
OUR CONTROL.

127
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:36,541
- THE CHAOS IS FAR WORSE
THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED.

128
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,041
WE MUST DO WHAT WE CAN
TO STOP IT.

129
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,666
- Pantherlily: CONTROLLING THE
CROWD IS THE FIRST PRIORITY.

130
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,208
- YOU'RE RIGHT. WE CANNOT
LET IT SPREAD. WE SHOULD GO.

131
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,833
- Soldier #1:
- UM, SIR?  WHO MIGHT <i>HE</i> BE?

132
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,791
- ( screaming )

133
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,791
- ( whispering )

134
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,416
- HOW MANY ARE THERE?

135
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,125
- Soldier #2:
THREE, SIR.

136
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,583
- AND YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN
THEM OUT?

137
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,125
EXPLAIN YOURSELF!

138
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,541
- Soldier #2: YES, SIR.
UH... THEY'RE REALLY STRONG.

139
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:26,416
- ( evil laughing )

140
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,625
- I AM THE DEMON
THEY CALL DRAGNEEL!

141
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,875
AND I'VE COME HERE TO THIS WORLD
TO STEAL ALL

142
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,416
OF YOUR MAGIC POWER!

143
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,500
- WHAT?!

144
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:40,583
- NATSU?

145
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,666
- Man #1:
OH, NO!  THIS IS HORRIBLE!

146
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:49,250
- Natsu:
HAVE YOU GONE INSANE, OTHER ME?!

147
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,250
NEVER MIND!

148
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,750
- ( evil laughing continues )

149
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,208
- FAUST AIN'T YOUR KING
ANYMORE!

150
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:59,458
'CAUSE I KICKED
HIS SORRY, OLD BUTT!

151
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,708
- ( evil laughing )

152
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:06,166
BUT I DECIDED TO SPARE
HIS LIFE, FOR NOW!

153
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,750
- YOUR MAJESTY!
- OH, NO!

154
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,958
- POOR KING FAUST!
- HOW DARE HE HURT HIM!

155
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:13,791
- COME ON, RED FOX.
HEY, MARVEL!

156
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:17,041
NOW, MY FAITHFUL SERVANTS,
IT'S TIME TO TRASH THE CITY!

157
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,041
- HE'S GOT A SWORD FOR AN ARM!

158
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,541
- IT'S ANOTHER DEMON!

159
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,333
- WE'RE DOOMED!

160
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:34,416
- THESE VILLAINS WON'T STOP
UNTIL THEY'VE DESTROYED

161
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,833
EVERYTHING IN SIGHT!

162
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,541
THE CITY IS UNDER ATTACK
BY DEMONS FROM ANOTHER WORLD!

163
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,750
- YOU BETTER RUN!

164
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,708
- UH...

165
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,708
- ( screaming )

166
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,666
- I'M SORRY.

167
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,208
- JUST LOOK AT THEM, THEY'RE
AN UNSTOPPABLE FORCE OF EVIL.

168
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:58,291
- ( chuckling )

169
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:01,250
- ( crowd murmuring )

170
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,625
- JUST WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?  STOP THIS!

171
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:08,250
- NOW, MY LOYAL SERVANTS
OF LORD DRAGNEEL--

172
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,625
DON'T STOP DESTROYING STUFF!

173
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,333
- KEEP GOING
WITH THIS SERVANT CRAP

174
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,916
AND I'M COMING UP THERE FIRST.

175
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,916
- Natsu: JUST DO WHAT
I TELL YOU TO, SLAVE!

176
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,041
- I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN
MORE SPECIFIC.

177
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:20,375
- ( thinking)
HOLD ON.

178
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,208
- THEY'RE TO BLAME FOR THIS!

179
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,750
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO STOLE
EDOLAS' MAGIC POWER!

180
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,916
- IT'S ALL THAT
DRAGNEEL'S FAULT!

181
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,083
- Gajeel: THAT'S RIGHT, THE DARK
LORD DRAGNEEL'S THE BRAINS

182
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,791
 BEHIND THE WHOLE OPERATION.

183
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,166
- UNFORGIVABLE!

184
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,375
- GIVE US OUR MAGIC BACK, NOW!

185
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,458
- BETTER BE CAREFUL,

186
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,041
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU PLAY WITH FIRE.

187
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:42,958
- Man #2: OH, NO!
- Man #3: HE REALLY IS A DEMON!

188
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,083
- NATSU,

189
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,958
STOP THIS, NOW!

190
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,083
- HUH?

191
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,750
- IS SOMEBODY CHALLENGING HIM?

192
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,000
- HE'S OVER THERE,
IN THE CASTLE TOWER.

193
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,208
- DO YOU KNOW WHO IT IS?

194
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,083
- ( sighs )

195
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,958
- ARE YOU TELLING ME WHAT TO DO,

196
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,041
YOU LITTLE PUNK?

197
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,125
- STOP THIS FOOLISHNESS,

198
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,000
THE KING HAS BEEN DEFEATED.

199
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,500
THERE'S NO NEED
TO ATTACK INNOCENT PEOPLE.

200
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,625
- Natsu:
OH YEAH?

201
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,833
- NO, DON'T!

202
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:11,375
- IF YOU'RE TRYING TO SCARE ME,

203
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,708
IT AIN'T GOING TO WORK.

204
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,083
I DON'T CARE IF YOU ARE
THE PRINCE.

205
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,208
- HE'S THE PRINCE?

206
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,916
- COULD IT REALLY BE HIM?

207
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,291
- BUT THE PRINCE MYSTERIOUSLY
VANISHED SEVEN YEARS AGO.

208
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,625
PRINCE JELLAL IS BACK!

209
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,875
- Man: I DON'T BELIEVE IT,

210
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:25,958
HE'S RETURNED?

211
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,541
- Man #2:
JUST IN TIME.

212
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,958
- Man #3:
IT'S A MIRACLE!

213
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:32,625
- Pantherlily:
WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE?

214
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:35,375
- Nadi:
I'M RESPONSIBLE, SIR.

215
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,000
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

216
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:40,208
- I HAPPENED TO OVERHEAR
YOUR CONVERSATION EARLIER.

217
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,750
- LET'S FIGHT.

218
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:49,583
OR YOUR PRECIOUS CITY IS GOING
TO GET BURNED TO THE GROUND.

219
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:55,250
- IT SEEMS WE HAVE
OUR VILLAIN, DON'T WE?

220
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,708
- WHY ISN'T THE ARMY
DOING ANYTHING?

221
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,833
- SOMEONE HAS TO SAVE THE KING
OR THEY'LL KILL HIM!

222
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,541
- IS ANYBODY EVEN SURE THAT
<i>THAT</i> GUY IS REALLY THE PRINCE?

223
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:03,833
- I DON'T CARE WHO HE IS,

224
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,041
AS LONG AS HE CAN BEAT
THAT MONSTER.

225
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,458
- Panther Lily: THE CITIZENS DO
NOT BELIEVE IN THE PRINCE YET.

226
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,666
- NATSU, STAY RIGHT THERE.

227
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,791
- DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME?

228
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,375
I AM THE GREAT AND POWERFUL
LORD DRAGNEEL.

229
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:19,583
- Pantherlily: IT'S OBVIOUS HE
WANTS TO MAKE JELLAL PLAY

230
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,000
THE ROLE OF HERO.

231
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,916
BUT IF HE THROWS THE FIGHT
AND THE PUBLIC FINDS OUT,

232
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,666
THE CONSEQUENCES COULD
BE TRAGIC.

233
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,125
- ( thinking ) IS HE WILLING
TO PAY THE ULTIMATE PRICE?

234
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,833
- SIR, I'D ADVISE YOU TO BE
READY FOR SOME MAJOR SURPRISES.

235
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:37,500
THERE'S QUITE A BIT MORE
IN STORE FOR TONIGHT,

236
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,833
TO SAY THE LEAST.

237
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,833
- OH, MY.
I FEEL MYSELF AGAIN.

238
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,875
EXCEPT FOR THIS CRUSHING WEIGHT!

239
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,958
I'M BEING SQUASHED BY MY MEN!

240
00:12:56,041 --> 00:13:00,333
WHAT THE DEVIL
IS HAPPENING HERE?

241
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,666
IS THAT MAGIC POWER?

242
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,666
THE QUEEN,

243
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,750
I MUST PROTECT THE QUEEN!

244
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:12,291
- Nichiya:
( roars )

245
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,791
- Gajeel:
THERE GOES THE PRINCE,

246
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,750
IS HE REALLY GOING TO FIGHT
THAT MONSTER BY HIMSELF?

247
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,708
WHAT UNBELIEVABLE COURAGE
HE HAS.

248
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,583
- Woman #2:
HE'S SO BRAVE.

249
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:32,416
- YOU IDIOT, I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

250
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,583
BUT YOU'RE JUST GOING TO END UP
MAKING THINGS WORSE

251
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,041
FOR EVERYONE.

252
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,416
NOW SLEEP!

253
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:54,791
THE ANIMA MUST HAVE
TAKEN MY POWER.

254
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,666
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

255
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,708
YOU SCARED WITHOUT
YOUR MAGIC, HUH?

256
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,541
- ( grunts )

257
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,791
- WELL YOU SHOULD BE.

258
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,750
'CAUSE CHECK THIS OUT,
I'VE GOT PLENTY!

259
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,875
- Man: EVERYBODY, RUN!

260
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,291
- I SAID, STOP!

261
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,666
- Wendy: NATSU, YOU'RE
GOING WAY TOO FAR.

262
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,250
- Gajeel:
NO, HE'S NOT.

263
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,750
THE MORE POWERFUL THE VILLAIN'S
MAGIC SEEMS TO EVERYONE,

264
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,125
THE STRONGER THE HERO LOOKS
WHEN HE BEATS HIM WITHOUT

265
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,833
USING ANY MAGIC AT ALL.

266
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,000
- LISTEN TO ME, NATSU.

267
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,666
YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE
WITH ALL THIS,

268
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,583
THIS WHOLE SHOW
THAT YOU'RE PUTTING ON.

269
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,625
YOU CAN'T EXPECT
TO FOOL ALL THESE PEOPLE.

270
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,833
- HAH, I CHALLENGE YOU!

271
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,416
- Woman: PRINCE!

272
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,666
- Man: WATCH OUT,
HE'S DANGEROUS!

273
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,500
- YOU FOOL,

274
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,500
YOU CAN'T BRING THE PEOPLE
TOGETHER LIKE THIS--

275
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,583
THROUGH EVIL.

276
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:54,791
- FIGHT ME FOR REAL.

277
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,083
- YEAH!

278
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,333
- YOU GOT HIM, PRINCE!

279
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,416
- WE KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.
YOU'RE OUR ONLY HOPE!

280
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,791
- YEAH, NOW THEY'RE
REALLY GETTING IN TO IT.

281
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,958
- IDIOT!  YOU SHOULD HAVE
STAYED DOWN

282
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,083
SO WE WOULDN'T HAVE
TO STRETCH THIS OUT FURTHER.

283
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,250
- NOT MY STYLE!

284
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,791
- ( groans )

285
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,875
- OH, NO.
- GET UP!

286
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,583
- HOW DARE HE STRIKE
THE PRINCE LIKE THAT.

287
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:32,416
- ( crowd cheering )

288
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,375
- ( chanting )
GO, PRINCE!

289
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,041
- THIS IS IT, BUDDY.

290
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,416
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
A REAL FAIRY TAIL SEND-OFF.

291
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,583
SINCE YOU'RE LEAVING FAIRY TAIL,

292
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,166
YOU'VE GOT TO SWEAR TO
FOLLOW THESE THREE RULES--

293
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,791
NUMBER ONE,

294
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,875
NEVER, EVER, SHARE SENSITIVE
INFORMATION ABOUT FAIRY TAIL

295
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,041
WITH ANYONE,
AS LONG AS YOU LIVE.

296
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,208
TWO--

297
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:58,333
HOW'D THAT ONE GO AGAIN?

298
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,500
- NUMBER TWO, YOU MUST NEVER
CONTACT ANY CLIENTS

299
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:02,791
YOU MAY HAVE WORKED
WITH FOR THE GUILD

300
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,083
FOR YOUR OWN PERSONAL GAIN.

301
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,375
- THAT'S RIGHT,
AND DON'T FORGET NUMBER THREE.

302
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,791
ALTHOUGH OUR PATHS MUST STRAY,

303
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,000
YOU'VE GOT TO PROMISE TO LIVE
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE

304
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,416
TO THE FULLEST.

305
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,000
THAT MEANS TO TREAT EVERY DAY
LIKE IT WAS GOING TO BE

306
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,708
YOUR LAST DAY IN THIS WORLD.

307
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,250
DON'T FORGET THE FRIENDS
YOU LOVED.

308
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:25,416
- YOU MUST TREASURE THEM
FOR AS LONG AS YOU LIVE.

309
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,333
- DID YOU GET ALL THAT?

310
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,708
- Natsu: WHEN A GUILD
WORKS TOGETHER,

311
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,916
THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN'T DO.

312
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,500
NICE KNOWING YOU, PAL.
LATER.

313
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,458

- Woman: PRINCE, YOU'RE MY HERO!

319
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,166
- NATSU.

320
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:32,166
- WHAT?

321
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,333
WHAT'S THAT?

322
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,458
- IT'S STARTING.

323
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,541
- YEAH, I GUESS
OUR LITTLE SONG AND DANCE

324
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,541
AIN'T OVER JUST YET.

325
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,000
- Man: DO YOU SEE THAT?

326
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,916
- Woman: HIS BODY IS GLOWING.

327
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,500
- WHAT'S HAPPENING TO US?

328
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,958
- THE REVERSE ANIMA SPELL
IS BEGINNING TO CAST

329
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,291
EVERY REMAINING SHRED OF MAGIC
OUT OF EDOLAS.

330
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,750
AND BECAUSE WE POSSESS
INTERNAL MAGIC POWERS,

331
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,666
THAT INCLUDES ALL OF THE EXCEEDS
AND THE DRAGON SLAYERS AS WELL.

332
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,125
WE'LL ALL BE PULLED
INTO EARTH LAND.

333
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,875
- SAY WHAT?

334
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,833
- I BELIEVE THE
QUEEN IS PREPARING

335
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,666
FOR THIS OCCURRENCE AS WE SPEAK.

336
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,666
- I'M SCARED, YOUR HIGHNESS.

337
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,250
- I'M FEELING REALLY WEIRD.

338
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,833
- Chagot: DON'T BE AFRAID,
IT WILL BE ALRIGHT.

339
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:17,708
THEY DON'T NEED ANGELS NOW,
SO WE HAVE TO MOVE ALONG.

340
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,708
THERE'S GOING TO BE
A BIG CHANGE FOR US.

341
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,625
AND WE ALL HAVE TO WALK
TOWARDS IT WITH A BRAVE FACE.

342
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,875
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

343
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,125
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

344
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,916
- THE ANIMA IS PULLING US
OUT OF THIS WORLD!

345
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,416
- ( gasping )

346
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,333
- Lucy: IT LOOKS LIKE THE ANIMA
IS STARTING TO WORK IN REVERSE

347
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,416
AND IT'S PUSHING THE MAGIC
OUT OF HERE.

348
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,416
THAT MEANS WE'VE
GOT TO GO, TOO.

349
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,625
- Natsu:
HEY, WHAT'S UP, YOU GUYS?

350
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:49,833
- Lucy: NATSU!
- Happy: NATSU!

351
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,166
- Gray: GOOD TO SEE
YOU, PAL. YOU'RE OK.

352
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,166

- Alzack:
I GUESS IT'S FINALLY HAPPENING.

354
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,750
WE'RE LOSING
OUR MAGIC POWER, FOREVER!

355
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,916
- Bisca: DOES THIS MEAN WE'RE
GOING TO LOSE OUR GUILD, TOO?

356
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,375
- I'M SO SCARED.
WHATEVER WILL BECOME OF US, NOW?

357
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,083
- YOU'RE ASKING ME, LIKE I'VE
GOT SOME KIND OF ANSWER?

358
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,375
- TRY NOT TO WORRY ABOUT IT,
YOU GUYS.

359
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,500
IT TAKES A HECK OF A LOT MORE
THAN JUST MAGIC

360
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,500
TO MAKE A REAL GUILD,
TRUST ME.

361
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:20,500
IT'S ALL ABOUT FRIENDSHIP.
THAT'S THE HEART OF A GUILD.

362
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,958
- IS THIS IT, SCARLET?

363
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,125
- I'M AFRAID SO, NIGHTWALKER.

364
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,750
NO. WE'RE BOTH--

365
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,708
- ( both )
ERZA.

366
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:55,000
- Lucky: WHAT IN TARNATION
IS GOING ON HERE?

367
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,500
- THIS FORCE IS PULLING US IN!

368
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,333
- THIS CANNOT BE!
JUST WHEN WE WERE REVIVED

369
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:02,083
AND READY TO PERFORM FEATS
OF UNIMAGINABLE HEROISM!

370
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,541
- SIR, YES, SIR!

371
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:14,000
- ( screaming )

372
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:17,375
- Mystogan: I KNEW
THE MAGIC WOULD BE EXPELLED.

373
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:21,208
BUT I HAD NO IDEA THE PEOPLE
WOULD BE AS WELL.

374
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:24,291
- WHOA, HE TOTALLY SENT
THE BAD GUYS FLYING AWAY!

375
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,916
- THE PRINCE JUST SAVED
THE ENTIRE KINGDOM!

376
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,083
- Man: OH, YEAH!

377
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,916
- HERO OF THE KINGDOM!

378
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,916
- Pantherlily:
PRINCE.

379
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,916
ALTHOUGH THINGS ARE
CHANGING RAPIDLY,

380
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,791
DON'T FORGET, ADAPTING
TO THEM CAN TAKE TIME.

381
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,458
DON'T RUSH.

382
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:42,541
LEAD YOUR PEOPLE WITH WARMTH
AND A CALM HEART.

383
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,000
TAKE THEM AT A PACE
THEY CAN KEEP UP WITH.

384
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:48,333
THEY WILL MARCH ALONGSIDE YOU
INTO THE FUTURE.

385
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:51,500
- I WILL.

386
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,083
- BYE-BYE, LUCY ASHLEY!

387
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,166
BYE, EVERYBODY IN FAIRY TAIL!

388
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,125
- LATER!
AND BEST OF LUCK TO ME!

389
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,291
I MEAN, THE YOU
THAT'S ALSO ME.

390
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:07,208
- GOOD LUCK TO YOU, TOO.
I MEAN GOOD LUCK TO ME, TOO.

391
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:10,166
- YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE IT'S
CONFUSING OR SOMETHING.

392
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,666
- BYE-BYE, PRINCESS.
TAKE CARE UP THERE.

393
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,000
- BYE-BYE, EVERYONE.
WE'LL SEE YOU LATER.

394
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:19,000
- DON'T BE SUCH A FOOL, WE WON'T
BE SEEING THEM AGAIN. NEVER.

395
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,333
- WHAT?!

396
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:24,083
( crying )
I'LL MISS YOU!

397
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,583
- STOP BEING SO SENTIMENTAL.

398
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,208
IT'S JUST PATHETIC.

399
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:34,958
- Lucy: AND WITH THAT, WE
ALL WENT BACK TO EARTH LAND.

400
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:38,375
- FAREWELL, PRINCE.

401
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:41,708
- FAREWELL, LILY.

402
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:45,375
AND FAREWELL TO MY FAMILY
IN FAIRY TAIL.

403
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:48,916
I'LL CHERISH OUR MEMORIES
FOR AS LONG AS I LIVE.

404
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,416
I PROMISE I WILL.

405
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,875
- Lucy: YOU CAN'T HELP BUT
WONDER WHAT WENT DOWN

406
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,208
AFTER WE LEFT.

407
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:16,125
- THE MONSTERS
HAVE BEEN DEFEATED!

408
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:19,500
WHETHER WE HAVE MAGIC OR NOT,
OUR KINGDOM WILL LIVE ON

409
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:22,125
SAFELY AND PEACEFULLY
FOR ALL ETERNITY!

THINGS ARE GOING TO BE

412
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:34,000
A WHOLE LOT BETTER
FOR THEM.

413
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:38,125
AFTER ALL, THEY'VE LEARNED
THERE'S STILL MAGIC EVERYWHERE.

414
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:41,375
AS LONG AS YOU KNOW
HOW TO LOOK FOR IT.

415
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:44,041

YOU BE SO SURE?

'CAUSE OUR GUILD IS AWESOME!

423
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,250
PLUS, WE'VE GOT GRAMPS AROUND
IF THINGS GET TOO OUT OF HAND.

424
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:27,833
HE CAN TAKE CARE OF ANYTHING.

425
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:30,666

MORE OF YOUR USUAL CRAZY TALK.

- Happy:
WELL, I GUESS FOR YOU,

429
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,375
MAKING SENSE IS CRAZY.

430
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:40,458
- Natsu: PFFT, YOU'RE JUST
JEALOUS OF MY BRAIN.
