1
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,958
- HEY, GUYS.  READY FOR
SOME MORE "FAIRY TAIL"?

2
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,791
JUST MAKE SURE
THAT WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING

3
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,375
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE ROOM.

4
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:27,041
AND DON'T SIT
TOO CLOSE TO THE TV.

5
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,875
- Happy:
PREVIOUSLY ON "FAIRY TAIL."

6
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,375
- Natsu:
CHECK THAT OUT.  WHAT IS IT?

7
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:31,791
- Happy:
WHILE EXPLORING GALUNA ISLAND,

8
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,625
WE FOUND A DEMON
FROZEN IN ICE,

9
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,791
AND GRAY SAID
ITS NAME IS DELIORA.

10
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,833
HIS MASTER,
A LADY NAMED UR,

11
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:40,375
USED HER MAGIC TO SEAL AWAY
THE DEMON FOREVER.

12
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,416
BUT LYON, HER STAR PUPIL,

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,208
IS DETERMINED TO REVIVE IT
TO PROVE HIS POWER.

14
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,125
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

15
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,166
- Ur: WHAT'S THE MATTER?

16
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,833
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE
GIVING UP THAT EASILY.

17
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,916
GET UP, GRAY.

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,958
GET UP, GRAY.

19
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,333
- Natsu: GET UP, GRAY.

20
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,375
MAN, YOU LOOK ROUGH.

21
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,208
HE BEAT THE SNOT
OUT OF YOU, HUH?

22
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,208
- NATSU...

23
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,541
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

24
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,541
- I COULDN'T REMEMBER
HOW TO GET TO THE VILLAGE,

25
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,333
SO I CLIMBED BACK UP
TO LOOK FOR IT.

26
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,958
I SEE IT NOW.
COME ON.  LET'S GO.

27
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,458
- WAIT.  I CAN WALK.

28
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,625
WHERE'S LYON?

29
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,041
- DON'T KNOW.
BY THE TIME I MADE IT BACK,

30
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,625
EVERYBODY HAD VANISHED.

31
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:09,750
- ( exhales )

32
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,958
- ( sighs )

33
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,041
NOW HOLD ON.
WE HAVE TO HURRY

34
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,458
AND GET BACK TO THE VILLAGE
BEFORE THEY DO.

35
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:24,250
- NO WAY! DELIORA IS
OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE, GRAY.

36
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,208
IT'LL KILL YOU.
DON'T GO.

37
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,750
- I AM GOING ON THIS
S-CLASS QUEST.

38
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,833
- NATSU, I'M WARNING YOU. YOU'RE
WAY OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE HERE.

39
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,000
JUST COME HOME.

40
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,250
HEY.
- YEAH?

41
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,416
- I'M SORRY.

42
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,041
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
BELIEVE IN YOU.

43
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,000
I'M NO BETTER.

44
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,833
- QUIT FEELING
SORRY FOR YOURSELF

45
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,416
'CAUSE YOU LOST A FIGHT!

46
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,875
YOU'RE A MEMBER OF
FAIRY TAIL!

47
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,583
NOW WE DON'T GIVE UP 
WHEN TIMES ARE TOUGH.

48
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:03,208
SO JUST PUT IT BEHIND YOU
AND KEEP MOVING FORWARD. 

49
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,416
( grunts )
OH, GREAT.

50
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,416
NOW IT'S EVEN HARDER TO RUN.

51
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,458
- ( Happy speaking )

52
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,125
- LISTEN UP.

53
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,041
THE PEOPLE WHO CAUSED
THE CURSE THAT TRANSFORMED YOU

54
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,791
ARE PLANNING AN ATTACK
ON THE VILLAGE.

55
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,458
- THEY'RE GONNA COME
DOWN HERE TO FIGHT US?

56
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,291
- YEAH.
BUT I'VE GOT A PLAN.

57
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,958
WE'LL CAPTURE THEM
AND LOCK THEM UP

58
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,500
UNTIL THEY TELL US
HOW TO CHANGE YOU BACK.

59
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,625
- I DON'T KNOW.
DO YOU THINK IT'LL WORK?

60
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,708
- DOESN'T HURT TO TRY.
- I'M SCARED.

61
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,458
- ONLY THING IS,
I'M PRETTY SURE 

62
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,791
THOSE THREE ARE WIZARDS.

63
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,125
THEY'RE GONNA BE
HARD TO CATCH.

64
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,791
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

65
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,625
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WE'VE GOT RIGHT NOW.

66
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,625
WELL, GOOD LUCK.
- LAST TIME I CHECKED,

67
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,500
YOU'RE A WIZARD TOO!

68
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,458
- ( gasps )

69
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,666
I JUST HAD A BRILLIANT IDEA.

70
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,750
- NOTHING GOOD
CAN COME OF THIS.

71
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,000
- WHAT ARE ALL OF YOU
DOING OUT HERE?

72
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,083
- All: CHIEF?!
- WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME, SIR.

73
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,083
THE ENEMY'S GOING TO
ATTACK ANY SECOND NOW.

74
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,125
- ENEMY? -

75
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,083
THE ONES RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE CURSE

76
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,666
THAT'S TRANSFORMED
YOUR PEOPLE.

77
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,625
THEY'VE BEEN HIDING IN
THE OLD TEMPLE IN THE JUNGLE.

78
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,500
- I DON'T CARE
WHO'S IN THE TEMPLE!

79
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,041
WHY HAVEN'T YOU
DESTROYED THE MOON?!

80
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,166
- WELL, YOU SEE,
IT WASN'T THE MOON

81
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,083
THAT DID THIS TO YOU,
EXACTLY.

82
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,416
BUT NOW WE KNOW WHO DID.

83
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,500
- YOU LIE!
DO WHAT I ASKED OF YOU!

84
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,500
- CHIEF, PLEASE.
YOU HAVE TO CALM DOWN.

85
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,666
- COME ON, LET'S GO.
- GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME!

86
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,333
DON'T LISTEN TO HER!

87
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,625
SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT
SHE'S TALKING ABOUT. 

88
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:21,625
- HE DOESN'T MEAN
ANY OF THAT.

89
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,500
HE'S JUST UPSET.

90
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,333
HE'S BEEN LIKE THIS
SINCE BOBO DIED.

91
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:28,083
- POOR MAN.
I KNOW HOW TO TRAP THE ENEMY.

92
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,833
- WE'LL BE HAPPY TO HELP
IF YOU NEED US.

93
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,541
- ( chuckles ) I'M THE
GREATEST CELESTIAL WIZARD

94
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,125
FAIRY TAIL'S GOT.

95
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,875
SO WHY DON'T YOU
JUST LEAVE IT TO ME?

96
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,875
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.
IT'LL BE A PIECE OF CAKE.

97
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,458
( Lucy squeals )

98
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:40,958
I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED TO SAY THAT.

99
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,208
- SOMEBODY'S STARTING
TO GET COCKY.

100
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,125
- OPEN, GATE OF THE MAIDEN.

101
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,375
VIRGO!

102
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,708
- SHE'S CUTE.
- THAT'S A MAID?

103
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,000
- I WANT ONE.
- CAN I HUG HER?

104
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,458
- SHE'S NOT THAT CUTE.

105
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,916
- HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED NEXT.

106
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,125
- PRINCESS,
I HAVE COMPLETED THE TASK.

107
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,291
- GOOD WORK, VIRGO.

108
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,125
MY PLAN IS GONNA
WORK PERFECTLY. 

109
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,541
- I'M NOT SO SURE.

110
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:07,875
- WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

111
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,708
- HEY, LUCY?
- YEAH, WHAT IS IT?

112
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,583
- I REALLY HATE
TO BREAK IT TO YOU,

113
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,750
BUT I THINK
YOU MIGHT BE STUPID.

114
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,166
- WOW.  THANKS A LOT
FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT.

115
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,583
- I JUST DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S
GONNA FALL FOR YOUR TRAP

116
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,166
'CAUSE IT'S THE OLDEST
TRICK IN THE BOOK.

117
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,583
- NOW DON'T BE SILLY.

118
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,750
A PITFALL TRAP
WILL GET THEM EVERY TIME.

119
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,791
- BUT YOU CAN TELL
WHAT IT IS BY LOOKING AT IT.

120
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,375
- IT DOESN'T MATTER 'CAUSE
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY

121
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,875
TO GET IN THE VILLAGE.

122
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,083
SO THE ENEMY'S GONNA HAVE TO
GO OVER IT IF THEY WANT IN.

123
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,916
- WELL I STILL DON'T 
THINK THERE'S ANY WAY

124
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,416
THEY'RE GONNA FALL FOR IT.

125
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,833
- UM, ME EITHER.

126
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,583
- I'M SORRY,
BUT I AGREE WITH THEM.

127
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,708
- YES, I HAVE TO CONCUR.
- NOT YOU TOO?!

128
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:47,166
GO AHEAD AND DOUBT ME.
YOU'LL SEE.

129
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,500
- MISS LUCY, 
IT LOOKS LIKE

130
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,500
THERE'S SOMEBODY
HEADED THIS WAY.

131
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,500
- THAT'S GOT TO BE THEM.
OPEN THE GATE!

132
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:53,458
- RIGHT!

133
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:58,125
- NOW COME TO MAMA.
- HEY, GUYS.

134
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,458
ARE YOU OKAY?
- ( screams )

135
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,000
- All: NATSU!

136
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,166
- STAY RIGHT THERE.
DON'T COME ANY CLOSER.

137
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,541
- WHAT?
- NATSU!

138
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:07,833
STOP, PLEASE!

139
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,625
( sighs )

140
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,041
- WHAT'S WITH THE GRASS?
- ( gasps )

141
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,708
NO!
- ( screams )

142
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,208
- ( all murmur )

143
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,208
- HE ACTUALLY FELL FOR IT.

144
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,791
- YEAH.
I'M SORRY WE EVER DOUBTED YOU.

145
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,291
- IT'S RUINED.

146
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,875
- VERY FUNNY.

147
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,625
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TIME 
TO PLAY PRACTICAL JOKES

148
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,208
ON EACH OTHER.
- DON'T TALK TO ME.

149
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,458
IT WAS LUCY'S DUMB IDEA.
- I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN!

150
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,166
- IT WASN'T A JOKE.
IT WAS A TRAP.

151
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,833
- I'M GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.

152
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,500
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

153
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:37,916
- YEAH, I'M FINE.

154
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,416
BUT GRAY'S DOWN
FOR THE COUNT. 

155
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,500
- THE GUY IN THE MASK
BEAT HIM UP THAT BADLY?

156
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:42,666
- HUH?

157
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,250
HEY, THE ICE IS GONE.

158
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,625
WHOA.  IT MUST HAVE 
CRACKED WHEN I FELL.

159
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,250
- SEE?  TOLD YOU
THE PITFALL WOULD WORK.

160
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,666
- EXCUSE ME, PRINCESS,

161
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,666
BUT I BELIEVE THE SPELL
WAS ACTUALLY BROKEN

162
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,083
WHEN HE LEFT THE CASTER'S
RANGE OF MAGIC.

163
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,041
- I'M FREE!

164
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,666
- GRAY.

165
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,416
- SO HOW COME LYON'S LACKEYS
HAVEN'T MADE IT HERE YET?

166
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,916
- YOU KNOW,
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

167
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,500
THEY LEFT FOR
THE VILLAGE BEFORE YOU,

168
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,166
BUT YOU GOT HERE FIRST.

169
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,083
I WONDER WHAT'S
TAKING THEM SO LONG.

170
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,500
- YEAH.  AND WITH GRAY
AND THAT GIANT ICE CUBE,

171
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,666
I WAS PRETTY SLOW.
- OKAY, GUYS.

172
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,458
HURRY AND COVER UP
THAT HOLE.

173
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,791
- THEY'RE NOT GONNA
FALL FOR THAT.

174
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,166
- HUH?  OVER THERE!

175
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,958
- HUH?

176
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,875
- IT'S A GIANT FLYING RAT.

177
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,833
- AND IT'S CARRYING A BUCKET.

178
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,958
- WHAT?  BUT NOW
MY PITFALL TRAP 

179
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,666
IS TOTALLY POINTLESS!

180
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,958
- I DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT DOUBLE POISON JELLY

181
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,708
TOOK SO LONG TO PREPARE.

182
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,375
- WE TIMED IT PERFECTLY.

183
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,666
THOSE WIZARDS WERE ABLE
TO MAKE IT BACK TO THE VILLAGE.

184
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,083
- ( growls )

185
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,708
- WE CANNOT REST UNTIL
THE DEMON DELIORA

186
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,875
HAS BEEN REVIVED
FOR THE COLD EMPEROR.

187
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,666
ANYONE WHO DARES
TO STAND IN OUR WAY MUST DIE.

188
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,708
- JELLY?

189
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,708
( grunts )
- WATCH OUT!

190
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,333
- ( winces )
- THAT SMELL.

191
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,041
I KNEW THE STUFF
WAS DEADLY.

192
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,750
- THAT BIG FLYING RAT HAS 
A WHOLE BUCKET FULL OF IT!

193
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,875
- NO!  THEY'RE GONNA
DUMP IT RIGHT ON US.

194
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,041
- HIDEOUS.

195
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,916
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
THE MOON DRIP

196
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,375
COULD TURN PEOPLE 
INTO THESE BEASTS?

197
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:21,250
- THEY LOOK LIKE
THE DEMON CHILDREN OF DELIORA.

198
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,583
- ( growls )

199
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,250
- ANGELICA,
WOULD YOU DO THE HONORS?

200
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,583
- OOH!

201
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,458
( grunts )

202
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,583
- HOW ARE WE GONNA PROTECT
OURSELVES FROM ACID JELLY?!

203
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,875
- I WANT EVERYBODY TO GET IN
THE CENTER OF THE VILLAGE.

204
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,958
- ( gasps )
- Natsu: READY TO FLY, HAPPY?

205
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,125
- AYE, SIR.

206
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,500
- ( grunts )

207
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,958
- ( screaming )

208
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:50,166
- I'M NOT GOING.
I WON'T LEAVE BOBO'S GRAVE.

209
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,458
- BUT CHIEF,
THAT JELLY'S GONNA GET YOU.

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
- FLAMES OF MY RIGHT HAND,

211
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,083
FLAMES OF MY LEFT HAND,

212
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,958
YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER...

213
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,458
( shouts )

214
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,958
YOU GET...

215
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:08,833
FIRE DRAGON BRILLIANT FLAME!

216
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,208
- HE DISPERSED IT.

217
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,708
- THAT BOY'S A FIRE WIZARD?

218
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,416
- OH, NO!  CHIEF!

219
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,541
- ( gasps )

220
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,000
- ( groans )
- YOU WISH TO PUNISH HIM

221
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,250
FOR DISOBEYING YOU?

222
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,250
- VIRGO!

223
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,333
- ( groans )

224
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,500
- THE VILLAGE HAS BEEN
COMPLETELY DISSOLVED. 

225
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:47,041
- THIS IS TERRIBLE.
- IS ANYBODY HURT?

226
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,541
- BOBO'S GRAVE'S STILL STANDING.

227
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,333
( gasps )

228
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:54,833
- THE COLD EMPEROR
ORDERED US

229
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,208
TO ERADICATE THE VILLAGE
AND ITS PEOPLE.

230
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,916
WE WERE TRYING
TO SHOW MERCY 

231
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,833
BY MAKING YOUR DEATHS
QUICK AND PAINLESS.

232
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,458
BUT SINCE THAT DIDN'T WORK,

233
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,708
WE'LL HAVE TO RESORT
TO BLOODSHED.

234
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:06,708
- ( gasps )

235
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,041
- 50 VILLAGERS, TWO WIZARDS.

236
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,875
IT SHOULDN'T TAKE MORE
THAN 15 MINUTES.

237
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,000
- ( snarls )

238
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,708
- YOU READY?
- YEAH.

239
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,250
- COUNT AGAIN,
'CAUSE THERE'S THREE WIZARDS.

240
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,041
- HOW DARE THEY.

241
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,041
SUCH DISRESPECT.

242
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,708
THEY KICKED OVER BOBO'S GRAVE!

243
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,041
- CALM DOWN, CHIEF.

244
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,875
- WE HAVE TO GET 
OUT OF HERE, SIR.

245
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,458
- YEAH, WE DON'T WANT TO
GET CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF

246
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,625
 A MAGIC BATTLE.
- I'M NOT GOING!

247
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,041
- HURRY AND GET HIM TO SAFETY.

248
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,875
- I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU!

249
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,458
PUT ME DOWN AND LET ME
TEACH THEM A LESSON!

250
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:37,875
- LET ME HELP YOU.

251
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,166
- GRAY.  YOU CAME TO.

252
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,458
- NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

253
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,833
WE DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.

254
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,500
- NATSU...

255
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:45,708
DON'T DO THIS TO ME.

256
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,500
( grunts )
- JUST LIE DOWN

257
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,083
AND GET SOME REST.

258
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,083
- SOME DAY..

259
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:55,458
I'LL KILL...

260
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:58,791
- BUT WHY?

261
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,583
- HE'S GIVING GRAY
SOME TOUGH LOVE.

262
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,583
NATSU KNOWS HE'S IN
NO CONDITION TO FIGHT

263
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,041
SO HE HAD TO STOP HIM.

264
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:07,875
- THAT MEANS DEEP DOWN
THEY REALLY DO CARE.

265
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,750
- CAN YOU LOOK
AFTER HIM FOR US?

266
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,166
- NO PROBLEM, MISS LUCY.

267
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,125
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

268
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,500
- WE'RE NOT LEAVING

269
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:24,000
UNTIL EVERY PERSON
IN THIS VILLAGE IS DEAD.

270
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:28,458
ANGELICA?
- ( squeals )

271
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:34,250
- WE'RE NOT GONNA LET YOU
GET AWAY WITH THIS!

272
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,958
( gasps )
OH, NO!

273
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,541
I GOT EXCITED AND GRABBED ON!

274
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,125
- YEP.  SHE'S STUPID.

275
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,708
- MORE LIKE INSANE.
- LEAVE THE VILLAGERS ALONE.

276
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,416
THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
TO DESERVE THIS.

277
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,083
- WHAT DOES SHE
THINK SHE'S DOING?

278
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,708
- ARE YOU TICKLISH?

279
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,916
- TRY ALL YOU WANT.
IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

280
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,541
- ( laughs )

281
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:51,583
- Sherry: ANGELICA?

282
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,458
- ( laughing )

283
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,791
- Sherry:
YOU HAVE TO FIGHT IT.

284
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,375
KEEP SPINNING YOUR TAIL.
- ( screams )

285
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,541
- WE'RE GOING DOWN!
- I DID IT.

286
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,500
( yelps )
WHY DID I DO THAT?

287
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,875
- ( screaming )

288
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,000
- OH, GREAT.
HE'S GONNA BE TICKED.

289
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,750
- I DON'T HAVE ANY TICKS!

290
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,125
- I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT YOU.

291
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,583
- DO YOU THINK SHE MADE IT?

292
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,166
THAT BIG RAT
MIGHT HAVE CRUSHED HER.

293
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,166
- IF SO,
SHE'S PROBABLY A GONER.

294
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,666
I'LL GO AND CHECK ON HER.

295
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,666
- THANKS.  BE CAREFUL.

296
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,666
I'LL STAY HERE

297
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,083
AND DEAL WITH THEM.

298
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,291
( grunts )

299
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,000
- ( groans )

300
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,375
- ( shouts )

301
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,666
- A WIZARD WHO CAN
BREATHE FIRE?  I SEE.

302
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,250
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE
THE SALAMANDER FROM FAIRY TAIL

303
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,666
I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT.

304
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:45,125
- ( grunts )
I'M GOOD!

305
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,125
- YOU KNOW,
WE USED TO BE MEMBERS

306
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,583
OF A FAMOUS GUILD OURSELVES.

307
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,666
SO YOU SHOULDN'T
BLOW US OFF.

308
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,208
IN FACT, IRON ROCK JURA USED TO
BELONG TO THE SAME GUILD.

309
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,958
SURELY YOU'VE HEARD OF
THE LAMIA SCALE?

310
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,000
- ( growls )

311
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,583
- ( grunts )

312
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,375
- HEY, CUT IT OUT.

313
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,166
LISTEN WHEN I'M
TALKING TO YOU.

314
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,875
- WHY?  YOU THINK I CARE
 WHAT GUILD YOU'RE FROM,

315
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,541
OR WHO THE OTHER MEMBERS ARE?

316
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,208
WE CAME HERE TO
HELP THE VILLAGERS,

317
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,208
AND YOU'RE THE ONES
WHO PUT THEM IN DANGER.

318
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,000
- ( sighs )

319
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:16,041
- WHICH MAKES YOU
FAIRY TAIL'S ENEMY.

320
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:19,250
AND THAT GIVES ME MORE THAN
ENOUGH REASON TO FIGHT YOU.

321
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,708
- ( sighs )
HEY, TOBY, JUST STAY BACK.

322
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,041
YOU DON'T NEED TO GET INVOLVED.
I'VE GOT THIS.

323
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,583
- ( growls )

324
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,583
- WAVE!

325
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,166
- I'LL TEAR THAT THING APART.

326
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,375
AAH!

327
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:34,208
- OOPS.  GUESS YOU WEREN'T
READY FOR THAT.

328
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,875
- AAH! 
- WAVE!

329
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,750
THE PULSING ENERGY
THAT'S COMING FROM MY HAND

330
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,666
DIFFUSES ALL TYPES OF MAGIC.

331
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,583
WHICH MEANS NONE OF YOUR SPELLS
WILL WORK AGAINST ME.

332
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:48,083
- SO THAT'S WHY MY FIRE POWER
COULDN'T DESTROY HIS BARRIER.

333
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,208
I GET IT.

334
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,083
- I SPECIALIZED IN
ANTI-WIZARD MAGIC

335
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,250
WHILE I WAS WITH
THE LAMIA SCALE GUILD.

336
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,333
AND I'M SURE YOU CAN
UNDERSTAND WHY.

337
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,250
NO MATTER HOW STRONG
THEY MIGHT BE,

338
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,208
ALL WIZARDS ARE
POWERLESS AGAINST ME.

339
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,458
EVEN YOU!

340
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,333
- OH YEAH?
( shouts )

341
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,875
- WAVE.

342
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,250
LIKE I TOLD YOU,

343
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,916
YOUR MAGIC IS USELESS
AGAINST MY WAVE.

344
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,125
- THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M GONNA
LET YOU OFF THE HOOK.

345
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,541
I'LL JUST HAVE TO
CRUSH YOU WITHOUT IT.

346
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,166
HEY, LOOK.
I BROKE THROUGH IT.

347
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,291
AAH!

348
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,291
- YOU PUT YOUR BARE ARM
INSIDE A VORTEX OF MAGIC ENERGY.

349
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,083
NOT A SMART MOVE.

350
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,041
- ( laughing )

351
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,750
- WHOA! HE'S PUSHING HIS
WHOLE BODY INSIDE THE WAVE.

352
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,291
- YOUR MAGIC'S NO MATCH
 FOR MY BRUTE STRENGTH.

353
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,625
SO WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO NOW?

354
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,625
- HE'S CRAZY, YUKA!
WATCH OUT!

355
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,041
- YOU BROKE THROUGH MY WAVE,

356
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,875
BUT NOW YOU'RE STUCK,
SALAMANDER.

357
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,041
YOUR FLAMES AREN'T GONNA WORK
NOW THAT YOU'RE INSIDE.

358
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,041
- BUT I CAN STILL
USE THEM OUTSIDE.

359
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,291
AND YOU JUST GAVE ME
A GREAT IDEA.

360
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,708
FIRE DRAGON!

361
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,708
- HE'S USING HIS FIRE MAGIC
AS A BOOSTER

362
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,416
TO INCREASE
THE POWER OF HIS PUNCH!

363
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,541
- FLAME ELBOW!
( grunts )

364
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:58,916
- ( grunts )

365
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,083
- THAT'S ONE DOWN.

366
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,333
- OH.

367
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,083
MAN, YOU'RE AWESOME.

368
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,666
- YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE
JUST HOW AWESOME FIRSTHAND.

369
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,125
- I'M NOT SCARED.

370
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,250
'CAUSE I'M EVEN
STRONGER THAN YUKA IS.

371
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:18,166
CHECK OUT MY MEGA JELLYFISH
PARALYZING CLAWS.

372
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,125
BET YOU'LL NEVER GUESS
WHAT THESE BABIES CAN DO.

373
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,000
- PARALYZE YOU?
- WHOA.

374
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,000
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

375
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,041
HEY, YOU GOT E.S.P.
OR SOMETHING?

376
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,916
- NO.  YOU'RE JUST REAL DUMB.

377
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,250
- NOBODY TALKS TO ME LIKE THAT!
- WATCH IT!

378
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,541
- WITH JUST ONE SWIPE
FROM MY CLAWS,

379
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,000
YOU'LL BE FROZEN,
WAITING TO DIE.

380
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,791
- HEY, MAN.
HOLD ON A SEC.

381
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,500
YOU GOT A LITTLE SOMETHING
RIGHT HERE.

382
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,708
- OH?

383
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:46,958
( screams )

384
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,791
OHH...

385
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,291
- WELL, THAT WAS EASY.

386
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,375
THOSE GUYS WERE A JOKE.
HERE WE GO.

387
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:57,375
WE'RE GONNA FIND A WAY
TO CHANGE YOUR PEOPLE 

388
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,208
BACK TO NORMAL, BOBO.

389
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,791
I KNOW WE WILL.

390
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:05,333
AND I PROMISE YOU,
I WILL AVENGE YOUR DEATH.

391
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,916
- EXCUSE ME, COLD EMPEROR,

392
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,291
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
BUT I WAS WONDERING

393
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:16,166
WHY YOU CHOSE TO SPARE
THE LIFE OF THAT WIZARD GRAY?

394
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,000
- NO REASON OTHER THAN
I DON'T FEEL THE NEED 

395
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,125
TO SHED ANYMORE BLOOD.

396
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,416
- YOU SAY THAT,
BUT ORDERING YOUR MINIONS

397
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,250
TO KILL THOSE VILLAGERS 
TELLS A DIFFERENT STORY.

398
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:29,958
IT WOULD APPEAR THAT YOU HAVE A
SOFT SPOT FOR YOUR FORMER RIVAL.

399
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,916
- ( sighs )
NONSENSE.

400
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,166
I SIMPLY HAVE NO DESIRE TO
GET ANYMORE BLOOD ON MY HANDS.

401
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,416
BUT IF HE HAPPENS
TO GET IN MY WAY AGAIN,

402
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,333
I WON'T HESITATE
TO KILL HIM.

403
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,250
- ( chuckles )

404
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,208
THAT'S GOOD.  I'M GLAD.

405
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,416
- ( murmurs )

406
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,500
WAIT, WHERE'S THAT WEIRD CHICK?

407
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:59,208
- ( crying ) DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA WHAT YOU'VE DONE?

408
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,125
IT'S HORRIBLE.

409
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,041
BECAUSE OF YOU, 
THE COLD EMPEROR

410
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,291
WILL NO LONGER BE
ABLE TO TRUST ME.

411
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,666
HE WON'T LOVE ME ANYMORE.

412
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,791
- LOVE?

413
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,208
- AND LOOK WHAT YOU
DID TO ANGELICA.

414
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,291
I'LL MAKE YOU PAY!
- BRING IT ON!

415
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,666
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

416
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,708
- WOOD DOLL!

417
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,000
- HMM?
( gasps )

418
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,625
- ( roars )

419
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,375
- THAT TREE'S ALIVE.

420
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,500
- ( screams )

421
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,291
- ( roars )
- ( gasps )

422
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,041
OPEN, GATE OF THE GOLDEN BULL.

423
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,458
TAURUS!

424
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,458
- I'M NOT A PERV.

425
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,875
JUST A FAN OF PRETTY LADIES.

426
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,791
( grunts )

427
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,375
MOO!

428
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,583
- SO, SHE'S A CELESTIAL WIZARD?

429
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,500
- NICE WORK, TAURUS.

430
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:46,708
- WHY DON'T YOU REWARD ME
WITH A SMOOCH?

431
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,750
- WHAT KIND OF WIZARD
FORCES THEIR CELESTIAL SPIRITS

432
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,250
TO SAY THINGS LIKE THAT?
YOU DISGUST ME.

433
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,666
- I DIDN'T FORCE HIM
TO SAY IT.

434
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,083
I HATE WHEN HE'S PERVY.
- MOO.

435
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,916
- WELL, YOUR KIND
DON'T LIKE MY MAGIC,

436
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,833
AND YOU'RE ABOUT
TO FIND OUT WHY.

437
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,208
- TAURUS, GO!

438
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,750
- ( groans )

439
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,750
- ( gasps )
- ( chuckles )

440
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:14,000
( screams )

441
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,166
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
STOP IT!

442
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,458
- MOO!

443
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,833
- WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?

444
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,541
- MOO!

445
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,500
- ( gasps )

446
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,375
- UH, MISS LUCY,

447
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,791
I CAN'T CONTROL MY MOO-VEMENTS.
- ( gasps )

448
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,375
- MARIONETTE ATTACK MAGIC.
YOU LIKE?

449
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,958
IT ALLOWS ME TO CONTROL
ANY LIVING THING.

450
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,458
WELL, EXCEPT FOR
HUMANS, THAT IS.

451
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,333
IT WORKS WELL ON
YOUR SPIRIT FRIEND.

452
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,125
- PLEASE, LET ME GO.

453
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,375
- I WISH THAT I COULD,
MISS LUCY.

454
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,125
I CAN'T HELP IT.

455
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,541
SHE'S CONTROLLING
MY EVERY MOO-VE.

456
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,500
- CLOSE NOW,
GATE OF THE GOLDEN BULL.

457
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:54,875
- ( grunts )

458
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,791
- I THOUGHT CELESTIAL GATES
COULDN'T BE CLOSED

459
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,083
UNLESS BOTH PARTIES
CONSENT TO IT.

460
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:05,750
- CLOSE THE GATE, TAURUS,
PLEASE!

461
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,416
- BEG ALL YOU WANT, BUT IT
WON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.

462
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,666
- TAURUS!

463
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,333
- OH, I KNOW.

464
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,416
LET'S PLAY A ROUND OF
RUSSIAN ROULETTE PUNCHES.

465
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,541
CLOSE YOUR EYES AND PUNCH
TILL YOU GET A HIT.

466
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:19,916
- ( gasps )

467
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,833
- FINE.
HOW LONG CAN YOU DODGE

468
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,166
BEFORE YOU WEAR OUT?

469
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,333
- ( straining )

470
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,083
- ( gasps )
DON'T HIT ME!

471
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,000
- I'M TRYING NOT TO.

472
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,458
MOO!

473
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:33,541
