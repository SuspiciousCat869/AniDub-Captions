1
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:20,708
- Narrator: IN A LAND
FAR, FAR AWAY

2
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:23,041
LIES THE KINGDOM
OF FIORE.

3
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:26,208
A SMALL, PEACEFUL NATION
OF 17 MILLION,

4
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,791
AND A PLACE FILLED
WITH MAGIC.

5
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,291
FOUND IN EVERY HOME,

6
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,041
BOUGHT AND SOLD
IN EVERY MARKETPLACE.

7
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,375
FOR MOST MAGIC IS
MERELY A TOOL,

8
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,958
A MUNDANE PART
OF EVERYDAY LIFE.

9
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,333
FOR SOME, HOWEVER,
MAGIC IS AN ART,

10
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:42,416
AND THEY'VE DEVOTED
THEIR LIVES TO ITS PRACTICE.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,666
THESE ARE THE WIZARDS.

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,833
BANDED TOGETHER INTO
MAGICAL GUILDS,

13
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:50,416
THEY PLY THEIR SKILLS
IN SEARCH OF FAME AND FORTUNE.

14
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,375
MANY SUCH GUILDS DOT
THE LANDSCAPE OF FIORE.

15
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:57,416
BUT THERE IS A CERTAIN GUILD
IN A CERTAIN TOWN

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,750
THAT SOARS HIGH
ABOVE THE REST.

17
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,583
ONE FROM WHICH COUNTLESS LEGENDS
HAVE BEEN BORN.

18
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:05,750
A GUILD THAT WOULD NO DOUBT
CONTINUE TO CREATE LEGENDS

19
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,416
WELL INTO THE FUTURE.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,500
ITS NAME IS FAIRY TAIL.

21
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,958
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

22
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,875
- Natsu:
PREVIOUSLY ON "FAIRY TAIL."

23
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,250
- WHY WON'T YOU 
GO LOOK FOR HIM?

24
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,125
- I'M NOT LEAVING
WITHOUT MACAO!

25
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:50,958
- Macao:
I OWE YOU ONE, BUDDY.

26
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,208
- NATSU AND GRAY,
I HAVE AN IMPORTANT FAVOR

27
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,708
THAT I NEED TO
ASK OF YOU.

28
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,041
- Natsu: HEY ERZA,
I'LL COME WITH YOU,

29
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,541
BUT ONLY UNDER ONE CONDITION.

30
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,500
I WANT A REMATCH WHEN WE
GET BACK TO FAIRY TAIL. 

31
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,375
- I ACCEPT YOUR CHALLENGE.

32
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,333
- Lucy: YOU'RE NOT REALLY
GONNA FIGHT, ARE YOU?

33
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,791
- Doma: THE EISENWALD GUILD
MAY HAVE BEEN DEFEATED,

34
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,958
BUT THAT IS ONLY ONE
SMALL VICTORY

35
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,791
IN A MUCH LARGER BATTLE.

36
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,375
- Michello: THE NUMBER OF
DARK GUILDS HAS BEEN GROWING

37
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,125
AT QUITE AN ALARMING RATE.

38
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,625
- WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH
A PLAN TO ELIMINATE THEM ALL.

39
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,541
- Shitou:
BUT HOW WOULD WE DO THAT?

40
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,958
- HOWEVER IT'S DONE,
WE CANNOT ALLOW ZEREF'S MAGIC

41
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:24,833
TO FALL INTO
THE WRONG HANDS AGAIN.

42
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,416
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW EISENWALD WAS ABLE

43
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,625
TO OBTAIN A TOOL OF FORBIDDEN
MAGIC IN THE FIRST PLACE.

44
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,750
- I HATE TO SAY IT,
BUT THE BLAME MAY EXTEND

45
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,416
ALL THE WAY TO
THE HIGHEST LEVELS.

46
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,041
- WHATEVER THE CASE,

47
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,583
ALTHOUGH THEY'RE USUALLY
JUST A THORN IN OUR SIDES,

48
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,750
IT SEEMS FAIRY TAIL PROVED
TO BE QUITE USEFUL.

49
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,416
- THEY TOOK DOWN
AN ENTIRE GUILD 

50
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,958
WITH A HANDFUL OF WIZARDS.
THAT IS QUITE A FEAT.

51
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,291
- ( overlapping chatter ) 
- I STILL DON'T LIKE THEM.

52
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,833
- YOU MAY NOT
WANT TO ACCEPT IT,

53
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,958
BUT THAT'S THE REALITY
OF THE SITUATION.

54
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:55,666
IN THE END, THE ATTACK ON
THE GUILD MASTERS WAS PREVENTED,

55
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,416
LIVES WERE SPARED

56
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,250
AND NONE OF US HAD TO GIVE UP
OUR HARD EARNED POSITIONS

57
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,791
ON THIS COUNCIL
TO SAVE FACE.

58
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,666
- YOU FOOL!
ARE YOU INSINUATING

59
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,541
THE COUNCIL IS
SOMEHOW TO BLAME?

60
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,125
- ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE.

61
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,625
FAIRY TAIL'S GOOD DEEDS
ARE OVERSHADOWED

62
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,625
BY THEIR RECKLESS DESTRUCTION.

63
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,791
- THEN WHY DON'T WE
TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY

64
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,416
TO DISCUSS THE MATTER
WITH THEM?

65
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,208
- ( Happy speaking )

66
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,416
- ( bell ringing )

67
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,750
- Lucy: "EISENWALD'S FAILED
ATTEMPT TO ATTACK

68
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,125
THE GUILD MASTERS WITH LULLABY

69
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,708
ENDED UP BEING BIG NEWS.

70
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,291
IT MADE ALL THE PAPERS,

71
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,708
AND IT SEEMED LIKE
EVERYBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT IT.

72
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,875
BEFORE JOINING FAIRY TAIL, 
I NEVER WOULD HAVE IMAGINED

73
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,041
I'D BE PART OF
SUCH A BIG EVENT.

74
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:46,166
IT FEELS AWESOME, BUT I'M NOT
GONNA LET IT GO TO MY HEAD.

75
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,500
IT STILL MAKES MY HEART
SKIP A BEAT

76
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,666
WHEN I THINK ABOUT
EVERYTHING WE WENT THROUGH.

77
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,625
I HEARD THAT THE AUTHORITIES

78
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,083
CAUGHT MOST OF THE
EISENWALD MEMBERS

79
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,500
WHO WERE INVOLVED.

80
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,166
THEY EVEN GOT A HOLD
OF KAGEYAMA,

81
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,500
SO THAT'S REASSURING AT LEAST.

82
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,500
THE SCARY THING IS,

83
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,083
THEY STILL HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO TRACK DOWN ERIGOR.

84
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:08,083
I'M WORRIED HE MIGHT SHOW UP AT
FAIRY TAIL LOOKING FOR REVENGE.

85
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,833
BUT I'LL BE OKAY,
'CAUSE I'M WITH THE GUILD'S

86
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,500
STRONGEST TEAM.

87
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,166
ERZA, GRAY, AND NATSU
HAVE MY BACK NO MATTER WHAT.

88
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,708
NOT TO MENTION HAPPY.

89
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,500
FAIRY TAIL IS AWESOME,
AND MY FELLOW MEMBERS 

90
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,125
ARE REALLY GREAT PEOPLE.

91
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,500
SO DON'T WORRY, MOM.
I'M DOING FINE.

92
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:26,083
P.S. PLEASE DON'T TELL DAD
ANY OF THIS, 'KAY?"

93
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,916
( sighs )

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,250
MAYBE I'LL DO A LITTLE
SHOPPING LATER TODAY. 

95
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,125
SAVING THE WORLD
FROM EVIL IS COOL AND ALL,

96
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,291
BUT SOMETIMES IT'S NICE
JUST TO RELAX AT HOME. 

97
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,833
- MAN, 70,000 JEWEL
A MONTH IS DIRT CHEAP

98
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:40,708
FOR A PLACE LIKE THIS.

99
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,708
YOU TOTALLY SCORED, LUCY.

100
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,208
- INTRUDER ALERT!

101
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,958
( grunts )

102
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,291
NO STRIPPING
IN MY HOUSE, BUDDY.

103
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,916
- HEY, GIVE ME A MINUTE
TO EXPLAIN, WOULD YOU? 

104
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,291
I WAS NAKED
WHEN I GOT HERE.

105
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,708
- GET OUT. - SO YOU FORGOT
ABOUT TODAY, HUH?

106
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,125
I FIGURED YOU WOULDN'T REMEMBER,
SO I CAME BY TO REMIND YOU.

107
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,541
- ABOUT WHAT?

108
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,083
- WELL, LET ME TRY
AND JOG YOUR MEMORY.

109
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:05,625
REMEMBER WHEN NATSU CHALLENGED
ERZA AT THE TRAIN STATION?

110
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,833
- ( crowd cheering )
- FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT!

111
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,958
- SHOW HIM WHO'S BOSS, ERZA!
- COME ON, NATSU!

112
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,291
- Gray: THEY'RE ABOUT
TO FIGHT THEIR REMATCH.

113
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,791
- ( laughing )
- ( gasps )

114
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,166
NO WAY!  THEY'RE REALLY
GOING THROUGH WITH IT? 

115
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,750
- OH, HEY, LUCY.

116
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,500
- WELL, IF THOSE TWO
VALUE THEIR MANHOOD,

117
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,166
THEN THEY'D BETTER 
GO THROUGH WITH IT.

118
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,833
- ERZA'S NOT A MAN.

119
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,458
- BUT YOU GOTTA ADMIT
SHE'S MANLY.

120
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,375
- Lucy: AREN'T YOU WORRIED
THIS FIGHT COULD

121
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,000
TEAR OUR STRONGEST TEAM APART?

122
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,750
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
OUR STRONGEST TEAM?

123
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,666
- YOU, NATSU, AND ERZA,
YOU DUMMY.

124
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,625
YOU'RE THE THREE STRONGEST
WIZARDS IN THE GUILD.

125
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,750
- WE ARE?  YEAH, RIGHT.

126
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,708
WHAT IDIOT
FED YOU THAT LINE?

127
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,583
- ( crying )
- OH, YOU'RE NOT AN IDIOT, MIRA.

128
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,250
- SMOOTH MOVE, GRAY. - I'LL
HAND IT TO NATSU AND GRAY.

129
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,083
THEY'RE TOUGH LITTLE DUDES.

130
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,833
BUT NEITHER OF THEM ARE EVEN 
CLOSE TO BEING THE STRONGEST.

131
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,208
THERE ARE GUYS IN FAIRY TAIL
WHO ARE STRONGER THAN

132
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,708
BOTH OF THEM COMBINED.

133
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,291
LIKE THIS GUY.

134
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,708
- BUT CALLING ERZA THE STRONGEST
WOMAN IN THE GUILD

135
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,291
IS A PRETTY SAFE BET.

136
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,041
- AS FAR AS THE GUYS,
IT'S A TOUGH CALL,

137
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,125
BUT I'D PUT MY MONEY 
ON LAXUS OR MYSTOGAN.

138
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,625
- ALL I MEANT WAS THE THREE OF
THEM WORK WELL TOGETHER

139
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,125
AND THEY HAVE THE BEST
TEAM CHEMISTRY

140
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,708
IN ALL OF FAIRY TAIL.

141
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,541
- OKAY.  AND THIS IS COMING
FROM THE SAME PERSON

142
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,291
WHO SENT ME ON A MISSION
TO KEEP NATSU AND GRAY

143
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,333
FROM KILLING EACH OTHER 
WHEN ERZA WASN'T AROUND?

144
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,375
- GOTTA SAY, I'M PRETTY PSYCHED 
TO SEE HOW THIS FIGHT TURNS OUT.

145
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:22,833
- OH YEAH? I'M SURE SHE'LL END
UP MOPPING THE FLOOR WITH HIM.

146
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,708
- IT'S BEEN QUITE AWHILE SINCE
WE'VE SQUARED OFF LIKE THIS,

147
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,333
HASN'T IT, NATSU?

148
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,208
- I WAS JUST
A LITTLE KID BACK THEN.

149
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,041
TODAY'S GONNA BE DIFFERENT.

150
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,750
'CAUSE I'M TAKING YOU DOWN,
ERZA.

151
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,916
- WELL, I'M NOT GOING
TO GO EASY ON YOU.

152
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,250
IN FACT,
I HAVE THE PERFECT ARMOR

153
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,416
FOR THIS OCCASION.

154
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:59,416
- THAT'S FLAME EMPRESS ARMOR.
GOOD CHOICE AGAINST FIRE MAGIC.

155
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,250
- SO NOW NATSU'S FLAMES
WILL ONLY BE HALF AS EFFECTIVE.

156
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,875
- COME ON, ERZA, AT LEAST GIVE
THE KID A FIGHTING CHANCE.

157
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,125
- HMM.

158
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,083
PUT ME DOWN FOR ERZA
IN THE FIRST ROUND. 

159
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,666
- YOU'RE BETTING AGAINST
YOUR OWN BEST FRIEND?

160
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,416
WHY ARE YOU GUYS
PICKING SIDES?

161
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,083
I DON'T WANT
EITHER OF THEM TO LOSE.

162
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,833
- GET INTO THE SPIRIT, LUCY.

163
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:20,708
- WOW, FLAME EMPRESS ARMOR, HUH?
GOOD NEWS FOR ME.

164
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,958
THAT MEANS I CAN TURN UP
THE HEAT AS HIGH AS I WANT TO.

165
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,875
- ROUND ONE, START!

166
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,500
- ( grunts )

167
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,000
( grunting )

168
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:38,875
( shouts )

169
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,291
- ( cheering )

170
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:41,833
( screaming )

171
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,041
- WHOA.
- SEE?  IT'S A GOOD FIGHT, HUH?

172
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,583
- THIS FIGHT SUCKS.

173
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,083
- ( groans )

174
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,250
- THIS FIGHT IS OVER.

175
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,875
- ( crowd chattering )

176
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,166
- MAY I HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE?

177
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,875
I HAVE COME HERE ON BEHALF
OF THE MAGIC COUNCIL.

178
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,750
- NO WAY.
- SERIOUSLY?

179
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,416
- WHY WOULD THE COUNCIL
SEND HER HERE?

180
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,875
- AM I THE ONLY ONE
WHO NOTICED SHE'S A FROG?!

181
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,333
- AS A RESULT OF
THE EISENWALD INCIDENT,

182
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,500
A MEMBER OF YOUR GUILD
HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH 

183
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,208
11 COUNTS OF CRIMINAL
PROPERTY DAMAGE.

184
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,916
ERZA SCARLET,
YOU ARE UNDER ARREST.

185
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,083
- HUH?  YOU'RE PUTTING HER
UNDER A-- WHAT?!

186
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,500
- AND THEN THIS HAPPENED.

187
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:36,625
- ( murmurs )

188
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,583
- ( sighs )

189
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,125
- Natsu:
THIS ISN'T FAIR, YOU GUYS!

190
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,625
LET ME OUT OF HERE ALREADY!

191
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,833
- NATSU, TRY TO CALM DOWN.

192
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,458
- LET ME OUT!
PRETTY PRETTY PLEASE?

193
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:51,916
- YOU'LL GO ON A RAMPAGE.

194
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,250
- I'LL BE GOOD, I SWEAR.

195
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,458
NOW PLEASE JUST
TURN ME BACK

196
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,708
TO THE WAY I WAS BEFORE.

197
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,375
- THE SECOND WE TURN YOU BACK,

198
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,875
YOU'LL RUN OUT
TO SAVE ERZA. 

199
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,250
- GIVE ME A BREAK.
I COULDN'T CARE LESS

200
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,583
WHAT HAPPENS TO HER.

201
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,250
- EVEN IF YOU WANTED
TO HELP HER,

202
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,375
IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN
FACE OFF WITH THE COUNCIL.

203
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,458
- BUT DON'T THOSE JERKS
ON THE COUNCIL REALIZE 

204
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,875
THAT ERZA DID
WHAT SHE HAD TO DO

205
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,458
TO SAVE THE LIVES
OF THE GUILD MASTERS

206
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,541
FROM THOSE BAD GUYS
AND THEIR EVIL DEATH FLUTE?!

207
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,375
- IF THE MAGIC COUNCIL
SAYS YOU'RE GUILTY,

208
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,291
THEN YOU'RE GUILTY.
END OF STORY.

209
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,458
THEY DON'T CARE
WHAT WE HAVE TO SAY.

210
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,041
- I JUST DON'T GET IT.

211
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,833
WE'VE DESTROYED PLENTY
STUFF IN THE PAST

212
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,666
AND THEY NEVER MADE
A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT.

213
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,916
- I KNOW.
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

214
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,875
- IT'S LIKE THERE'S
SOME OTHER REASON FOR THIS.

215
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,916
- Narrator: THIS BUILDING
HOUSES THE FIORE BRANCH

216
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
OF THE MAGIC COUNCIL.

217
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:40,500
AS WE SPEAK, ERZA SCARLET
IS BEING LED DOWN ITS HALLS,

218
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,583
DRAWING CLOSER TO THE TRIAL
THAT AWAITS HER.

219
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,166
- ( croaking )

220
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,125
- ( chuckles )

221
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,250
- ( gasps )
SIEGRAIN.

222
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,833
- ( croaking )
- IT'S BEEN QUITE AWHILE, ERZA.

223
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,708
PLEASE, RELAX.

224
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,041
I'M ONLY HERE IN SPIRIT.

225
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,458
I'M SENDING THIS PROJECTION
FROM ERA.

226
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,208
IN FACT, ALL THE WRINKLED
FACES IN THAT COURTROOM

227
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,666
ARE PROJECTIONS AS WELL.

228
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,041
WE DIDN'T THINK IT
NECESSARY TO BE HERE

229
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,875
FOR SUCH A TRIVIAL MATTER.
- I SEE.

230
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,041
SO YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S BEHIND THIS FARCE?

231
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,083
YOU MAKE ME SICK.

232
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,708
- LET'S BE CIVIL.

233
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,208
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A STAUNCH
DEFENDER OF FAIRY TAIL.

234
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,625
BUT THE ELDERS ARE WORRIED THE
BLAME FOR CLOVER'S DESTRUCTION

235
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,375
WILL FALL INTO THEIR LAPS.

236
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,041
AND THE ONLY WAY TO AVOID THAT
IS TO PLACE THE BLAME

237
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,291
ON SOMEONE ELSE ENTIRELY.
YOU'RE THEIR SCAPEGOAT.

238
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,041
- ENOUGH.

239
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,708
- JUST A FRIENDLY WARNING.

240
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,375
IN FACT, IT'S ANOTHER
MATTER ALTOGETHER

241
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:43,041
I WISH TO DISCUSS WITH YOU.

242
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:47,708
DON'T LET A WORD SLIP
ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT. 

243
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,250
FOR BOTH OF OUR SAKES.

244
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,083
I MUST JOIN MY
COLLEAGUES ON THE COUNCIL.

245
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,291
I'LL SEE YOU SHORTLY
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

246
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:03,583
- OH, WOW.  YOU KNOW SOME
VERY IMPORTANT PEOPLE.

247
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:06,583
- HE'S EVIL.

248
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:09,000
- ( croaking )

249
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:14,083
- I'VE WORKED VERY HARD
TO GET THIS FAR, ERZA. 

250
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,041
DO NOT STAND IN MY WAY.

251
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:28,833
- ( gavel bangs )

252
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,666
- THIS COURTROOM
WILL NOW COME TO ORDER.

253
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,208
BEFORE US IS THE DEFENDANT
ERZA SCARLET.

254
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,750
PLEASE TAKE THE STAND,
MISS SCARLET.

255
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,708
- THIS IS WRONG.

256
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,875
WE SHOULD BE THERE
TO TESTIFY.

257
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,541
- BUT LUCY...
- WE'RE NOT GOING TO COURT.

258
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,083
- WHY NOT, MASTER?

259
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,833
WE ALL KNOW SHE'S INNOCENT.

260
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,041
WE CAN'T JUST SIT HERE
AND LET THEM LOCK HER AWAY.

261
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,958
- EVEN IF WE LEFT
THIS VERY SECOND,

262
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,000
THERE'S NO WAY WE'D
MAKE IT THERE IN TIME.

263
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,708
- BUT--
- I'VE BEEN STUCK UNDER

264
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,125
THIS STUPID GLASS 
ALL DAY, YOU GUYS.

265
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,291
IT'S GETTING HARD TO BREATHE.
COME ON,

266
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,666
YOU GOTTA LET ME OUT OF HERE!

267
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,916
- Makarov:
YOU SURE YOU WANT OUT?

268
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,041
- HMM.

269
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,500
- ALL: HMM?

270
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,083
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

271
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,375
IT SEEMS YOU'VE LOST
THE FIRE IN YOUR BELLY.

272
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:19,958
HA!
- ( grunts )

273
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,958
- IT'S MACAO!
- ( gasps )

274
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,500
- All: THAT WAS YOU?!

275
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,166
- YEAH.  SORRY, GUYS.

276
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,416
BUT I OWED NATSU A FAVOR.

277
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,416
I TURNED MYSELF
INTO A SALAMANDER

278
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
SO THAT EVERYBODY
WOULD THINK I WAS HIM.

279
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,750
- LOOK, EVERYONE!
MY DADDY CAUGHT NATSU

280
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,250
TRYING TO SNEAK AWAY.

281
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,500
- HERE'S YOUR CHANCE.
I GOT YOU COVERED.

282
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,583
NOW RUN.
- DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE WENT?

283
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:44,166
- UH...
- HE WENT AFTER ERZA, DIDN'T HE?

284
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,500
- YEAH, AFRAID SO.

285
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,083
- YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

286
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,875
THAT IDIOT WILL PROBABLY
TRY TO FIGHT THE WHOLE COUNCIL.

287
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,791
- WOULD EVERYONE
JUST CALM DOWN? 

288
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:55,375
WE'VE NO CHOICE BUT TO
WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

289
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,500
- ( sighs )
- HMM.

290
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,625
- ERZA SCARLET,
YOU STAND BEFORE THE COUNCIL

291
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,708
TO ANSWER TO CHARGES
STEMMING FROM THE INCIDENT

292
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,375
INVOLVING THE DARK GUILD
EISENWALD.

293
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:09,000
THESE CHARGES INCLUDE EXTENSIVE
DAMAGE TO OSHIBANA STATION,

294
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:12,708
THE COLLAPSE OF THE REEYUSIKA
GORGE RAILWAY BRIDGE,

295
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,625
AND THE COMPLETE DESTRUCTION
OF THE CLOVER MEETING HALL. 

296
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:18,458
THERE ARE 11 PROPERTY DAMAGE
CHARGES AGAINST YOU.

297
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,208
ACCORDING TO EYEWITNESS
REPORTS,

298
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,875
THE PERPETRATOR IS DESCRIBED
AS A HEAVILY ARMORED

299
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,458
FEMALE WIZARD.

300
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,666
- ( all gasp )
- WHAT IS THIS?

301
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,000
- I'M THE CRAZY LADY IN ARMOR

302
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,083
YOU OLD TIMERS
HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR!

303
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,250
IF YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM WITH THE
WAY ME AND MY GUILD DO THINGS,

304
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:40,125
YOU CAN FIGHT ME!
I AM THE ALL POWERFUL ERZA!

305
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,500
YOU THOUGHT I WAS
DESTRUCTIVE BEFORE,

306
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,875
WELL, YOU AIN'T SEEN
NOTHING YET.

307
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,833
( screams )

308
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,083
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THE STUFF I DESTROYED

309
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,541
IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN
THE GUILD MASTERS' LIVES?

310
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,916
WELL?

311
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,166
- ( sighs )
- ( chuckles )

312
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,166
- TAKE THEM AWAY.

313
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,833
- I'M TRULY SORRY FOR THIS,
YOUR HONOR.

314
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,750
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, ERZA?
DON'T APOLOGIZE

315
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:06,125
TO THESE COUNCIL JERKS!
OOPS, I MEAN-- I AM ERZA!

316
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,458
- WORDS CAN'T EXPRESS
HOW ANGRY I AM WITH YOU.

317
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:16,125
THAT TRIAL WAS JUST
A FORMALITY.

318
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,291
- SERIOUSLY?
- IT'S A GLORIFIED SPECTACLE.

319
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:22,041
THE COUNCIL IS USING ME AS AN
EXAMPLE TO REMIND EVERYONE

320
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,041
THAT IF YOU BREAK THE LAW,
YOU'LL BE PUNISHED.

321
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,291
IT HELPS THEM MAINTAIN
ORDER IN THE MAGICAL WORLD.

322
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,958
- WAIT A MINUTE.
SO THIS IS ALL FOR SHOW?

323
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,291
- THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
FOUND ME GUILTY

324
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:34,500
THEN SENT ME HOME WITH
JUST A SLAP ON THE WRIST.

325
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,041
BUT THANKS TO YOU,
I'M STUCK IN A JAIL CELL!

326
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,708
- ( screams )
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

327
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,458
- I'M SORRY.

328
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,125
- IT'S OKAY.

329
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,875
YOU MEANT WELL.

330
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,916
- ( grunts )
OW, THAT HURT.

331
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,291
- I SEE.
A FAIRY TAIL WIZARD

332
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,000
CAME TO HER AID.

333
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,333
NATSU DRAGNEEL.

334
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,666
- WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
FRESH AIR COULD SMELL SO SWEET!

335
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,208
I'M GONNA BREATHE IT IN ALL DAY.

336
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,375
IT'S THE SWEET
SMELL OF FREEDOM!

337
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:06,833
- SHUT UP.

338
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,333
- I'LL NEVER TAKE IT
FOR GRANTED AGAIN.

339
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,083
- PUT A SOCK IN IT, MAN.
- ISN'T HE PRECIOUS

340
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,750
WHEN HE GETS ALL EXCITED?

341
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,166
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT 
STUPID ARREST AND TRIAL

342
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,500
WERE JUST FOR SHOW.

343
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,500
ALL THAT WORRYING FOR NOTHING.

344
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,583
- SO SHE WASN'T
A SACRIFICIAL LAMB,

345
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,083
BUT A SCAPE GOAT.

346
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,916
- YOU MUST BE ONE HECK
OF AN ICE WIZARD,

347
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,541
'CAUSE EVEN YOUR JOKES
LEAVE ME COLD.

348
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,333
HEY, NATSU!
YOU GONNA FINISH

349
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:27,916
GOING MAN-TO-MAN WITH ERZA?

350
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,958
- UH-OH.
- OH, YEAH, I FORGOT ABOUT THAT.

351
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:34,000
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY? WANT TO
PICK UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF?

352
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,666
- I'M NOT IN THE MOOD
RIGHT NOW.

353
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,375
- I'M NOT LETTING YOU
OFF THE HOOK THAT EASY!

354
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,750
- I SWEAR.

355
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,291
- ( grunts )

356
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,916
( whimpers )

357
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,416
- ( all gasp )
- HOW'S THAT? 

358
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,291
ARE YOU SATISFIED?
- AND HE'S OUT!

359
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,958
- ( laughing )
- WAY TO GO, CHAMP.

360
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,125
- GUESS WE KNOW
WHO THE REAL MAN IS.

361
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,791
- ( giggles )
- ( sighs )

362
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,583
- SIR, IS SOMETHING WRONG?

363
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,166
- I'M FINE.  JUST SLEEPY.

364
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,041
HE'S COMING.

365
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,500
- OHH.

366
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,000
- ( thuds )

367
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:11,916
- NOT AGAIN.

368
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,541
- ( sighs )

369
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:14,791
- SO TIRED.

370
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,500
- MMM.

371
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,500
- ( sighs )
- ( moans )

372
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,250
- MYSTOGAN.

373
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,833
- I SHALL RETURN.
- NO, WAIT.

374
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,000
LIFT YOUR SLEEPING SPELL
BEFORE YOU LEAVE.

375
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,333
- FIVE,

376
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,250
FOUR,

377
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,166
THREE,

378
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,166
TWO,

379
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,125
ONE.

380
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,416
- ( all gasp )

381
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,375
- ( snores )

382
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,416
- OH, MAN.

383
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,708
WAS MYSTOGAN HERE?
- WHAT A JERK.

384
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,500
- DOES HE HAVE TO
PUT US TO SLEEP

385
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,750
 EVERY TIME HE COMES HERE?
- WHO'S THIS MYSTOGAN GUY?

386
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:06,041
- FOR ONE, HE'S A CONTENDER FOR
FAIRY TAIL'S STRONGEST WIZARD.

387
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,791
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

388
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,791
AND FOR SOME REASON
HE DOESN'T WANT ANYONE TO SEE

389
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:13,291
WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE. SO WHENEVER
HE COMES HERE TO TAKE A JOB,

390
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,291
HE CASTS A SLEEPING SPELL.

391
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,833
- THAT'S KIND OF CREEPY.

392
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,041
- MASTER MAKAROV'S
THE ONLY PERSON HERE

393
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,041
WHO'S EVER GOTTEN
A GOOD LOOK AT HIS FACE.

394
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:24,333
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I'VE SEEN HIM BEFORE.

395
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,833
( chuckles )

396
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,875
- LAXUS?
- TALK ABOUT RARE.

397
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:32,458
- YOU'RE NEVER HERE.
- AND HERE'S ANOTHER CONTENDER.

398
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:35,041
- MYSTOGAN'S JUST
A LITTLE SHY.

399
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,916
YOU SHOULD ALL
RESPECT HIS PRIVACY.

400
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,625
- ALL RIGHT, LAXUS.

401
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,416
YOU AND ME, RIGHT NOW!

402
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,708
- GETTING YOUR BUTT KICKED
ONCE TODAY WASN'T ENOUGH? 

403
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:47,333
- YEAH, PAL. IF YOU CAN'T EVEN
WIN AGAINST THE REDHEAD,

404
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,625
WHY BOTHER WITH ME?

405
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,500
- WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO SAY?

406
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,541
- NO NEED TO GET
ALL WORKED UP, ERZA.

407
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,458
- I'M SAYING THAT IM
THE GUILD'S STRONGEST WIZARD.

408
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,333
- THEN COME DOWN HERE
AND PROVE IT.

409
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,750
- YOU COME TO ME,
LITTLE MAN.

410
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,458
- WITH PLEASURE!

411
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,250
- ( gasps )

412
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,833
- ( grunts )

413
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:07,500
- YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED ON 
THE SECOND FLOOR, NATSU.

414
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,125
AT LEAST, NOT YET.

415
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,500
- I THINK YOU MADE HIM GRUMPY.
- SHUT UP!

416
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,583
- THAT'S ENOUGH
OUT OF YOU, LAXUS.

417
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,916
- THE MOST POWERFUL ONE
IN THE GUILD ISN'T A CHICK

418
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,583
OR SOME HOODED WEIRDO.

419
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,916
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT
THE STRONGEST WIZARD LOOKS LIKE?

420
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,666
YOU'RE LOOKING RIGHT AT HIM.

421
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,125
- HEY, MIRAJANE,
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

422
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,375
WHAT WAS THE MASTER
TALKING ABOUT EARLIER?

423
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,291
WHY CAN'T WE GO UP
TO THE SECOND FLOOR?

424
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,416
- THAT AREA'S RESERVED FOR
ADVANCED MEMBERS OF THE GUILD.

425
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,791
THE JOBS THAT ARE LISTED
ON THE REQUEST BOARD UP THERE

426
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,375
MAKE THE ONES LISTED DOWN HERE

427
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,541
LOOK LIKE CHILD'S
PLAY IN COMPARISON.

428
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,916
THEY'RE CALLED 
S-CLASS QUESTS.

429
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,791
- S-CLASS?
- THEY'RE JOBS SO DANGEROUS

430
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,875
THAT ONE WRONG MOVE
COULD BE YOUR LAST.

431
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:52,375
BUT WITH THAT RISK
COMES A HIGHER REWARD.

432
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,958
MASTER MAKAROV HAND PICKS
THE WIZARDS HE THINKS

433
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,583
ARE CAPABLE OF
HANDLING THESE JOBS.

434
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,791
THERE ARE ONLY FIVE PEOPLE
IN THE ENTIRE GUILD

435
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,541
WHO ARE CONSIDERED S-CLASS.

436
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,666
THAT INCLUDES LAXUS,
MYSTOGAN AND ERZA. - HMM.

437
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,833
- I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT
IF I WERE YOU, LUCY.

438
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,333
IN MY OPINION,
THERE'S NO AMOUNT OF MONEY

439
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,250
THAT'S WORTH RISKING
YOUR LIFE OVER.

440
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,375
- YEAH, NO KIDDING.

441
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,291
- HEY, WHERE YOU GOING THERE,
BLONDIE?

442
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:19,416
- Lucy: WOW.
MYSTOGAN AND LAXUS.

443
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,833
THAT IS SO COOL.

444
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,583
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY
FAMOUS WIZARDS

445
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:23,750
ARE IN FAIRY TAIL.

446
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,166
AND I THINK I'M STARTING

447
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,375
TO FIGURE OUT HOW 
EVERYBODY'S RANKED

448
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,791
WITHIN THE GUILD.

449
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,625
GOTTA START WORKING
MY WAY TO THE TOP. 

450
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,833
- WELCOME HOME.
- 'SUP?

451
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,583
- AAH!

452
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,041
YOU GUYS STINK!

453
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,416
WHY DON'T YOU JERKS
WORK OUT AT YOUR OWN HOUSE?

454
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,916
- NOW LUCY, IF WE WANT TO 
WORK TOGETHER LIKE A TEAM,

455
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,416
WE GOTTA TRAIN LIKE ONE.

456
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,250
- WE THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE
THE PINK DUMBBELL.

457
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,791
- I DON'T CARE
WHAT COLOR IT IS,

458
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,166
I'M NOT LIFTING
WEIGHTS WITH YOU!

459
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,875
- WE GOTTA KICK IT UP A NOTCH

460
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,875
IF WE WANNA BEAT
LAXUS AND ERZA. 

461
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,291
- AYE, SIR.

462
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,791
- I JUST WANT
A LITTLE PIECE AND QUIET.

463
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,291
NOW GET OUT!
- ( whispers ) DON'T WORRY.

464
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,875
WE'LL TRAIN QUIETLY, LUCY.

465
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,916
- WHY DOES THIS KIND OF
STUFF ALWAYS HAPPEN TO ME?

466
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,291
- I'VE MADE A DECISION.
- HMM?

467
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,208
- OUR TEAM IS READY
FOR THE BIG TIME.

468
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,416
S-CLASS.
- YEAH!

469
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,041
CHECK IT OUT!
- HOW DID YOU GET THAT?!

470
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,416
I THOUGHT WE WEREN'T ALLOWED
TO GO ON THE SECOND FLOOR.

471
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,125
- WELL, I JUST
CLIMBED THE STAIRS

472
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,458
AND TOOK IT.
- YOU LITTLE CAT BURGLAR!

473
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,875
- ( giggles )
- SINCE THIS IS OUR FIRST

474
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,791
S-CLASS QUEST,
WE DECIDED TO GO WITH

475
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,791
THE SMALLEST REWARD
WE FOUND ON THE BOARD.

476
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,791
BUT SEVEN MILLION
IS STILL A LOT OF JEWEL.

477
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,208
- WE'RE NOT READY FOR IT.

478
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,708
IF THE MASTER KNEW
WE HAD THIS JOB REQUEST,

479
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,500
HE'D BE FURIOUS.

480
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:29,916
- YEAH, BUT I THINK HE'LL
END UP BEING PROUD OF US 

481
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,666
IF WE ACTUALLY PULL IT OFF.

482
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,666
- ( sighs )
YOU KNOW, THIS MAY BE

483
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,666
THE DUMBEST THING
YOU'VE EVER DONE, NATSU.

484
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,166
IF YOU WANT TO
RISE UP THE RANKS,

485
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,416
YOU SHOULD TRY FOLLOWING
THE GUILD'S RULES.

486
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,833
- JEEZ, WE'RE NEVER
GONNA MAKE S-CLASS

487
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,208
WITH THAT KIND OF ATTITUDE.

488
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,750
- YOU CAN HANDLE THIS
ON YOUR OWN.

489
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,125
I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE.

490
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,833
- BUT THE JOB IS SAVING
A TROPICAL ISLAND.

491
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,833
- REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

492
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,041
- ( steel drums playing )

493
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,666
- Both: IT'S THE CURSED
ISLAND OF GALUNA.

494
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,875
- NO WAY.
DEFINITELY NOT GOING NOW.

495
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,416
- I'LL GIVE YOU HALF
THE FISH I CATCH, LUCY.

496
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,083
- WHAT KINDA INCENTIVE 
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE?

497
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,250
( scoffs )
- FINE.  WE'RE OUT OF HERE.

498
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,250
- AYE. - THAT'S THE BEST IDEA
YOU'VE HAD ALL DAY.

499
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,958
HOLD ON.  FOR CRYING OUT LOUD,
WOULD YOU USE THE DOOR?

500
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,708
( sighs, gasps )

501
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,625
OH, NO!  THEY LEFT
THE JOB REQUEST HERE.

502
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,125
NOW EVERYBODY'S GONNA THINK
I'M THE ONE WHO STOLE IT.

503
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,291
WHAT DO I DO?

504
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,291
IS THIS FOR REAL?

505
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:21,541
ON TOP OF THE GIANT REWARD,

506
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:22,791
YOU ALSO GET A GATE KEY?!

507
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:26,291
HMM.
( giggles )

508
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,291
HEY, WAIT UP, YOU GUYS!

509
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:31,083
I'VE DECIDED TO COME ALONG!

510
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:34,083
- Mirajane: MASTER!

511
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,708
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED,

512
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:37,666
BUT ONE OF THE S-CLASS
QUESTS IS MISSING.

513
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:41,916
- ( spits )

514
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

515
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:15,666
- Happy: WHICH ONE DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD TAKE, NATSU?

516
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,583
- I DON'T KNOW. SINCE THIS
IS OUR FIRST S-CLASS QUEST,

517
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,416
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
PICK THE EASIEST ONE.

518
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,250
- AYE.  THIS GALUNA ISLAND
JOB LOOKS COOL.

519
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:26,250
AND LUCY WON'T BE ABLE TO
TURN DOWN THE BONUS REWARD.

520
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,083
- OH, THEN GALUNA ISLAND IT IS.

521
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,458
QUICK, GRAB IT BEFORE
SOMEONE SEES US.

522
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:30,541
- AYE!

523
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:33,708
- ( Natsu and Happy speaking )

524
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:36,000
- Natsu: ALL RIGHT. NOW LET'S
HEAD OVER TO LUCY'S HOUSE

525
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:38,000
AND GET SOME TRAINING IN
BEFORE IT'S TIME TO LEAVE.

526
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,500
- Happy:
SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

527
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,458
HER PLACE COULD USE
A LITTLE TESTOSTERONE.
