1
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,541
- HEY, GUYS, READY FOR 
SOME MORE "FAIRY TAIL"?

2
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,250
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING,

3
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:23,916
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE ROOM.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,916
AND DON'T SIT TOO CLOSE
TO THE TV.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,833
- Cana:
PREVIOUSLY ON "FAIRY TAIL"...

6
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:33,625
- Mira: BOTH ERZA AND MYSTOGAN
DECIDED TO CHALLENGE LAXUS

7
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:36,333
IN THE HOPES OF STOPPING
THE TURMOIL HE'S CAUSED.

8
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:38,583
BUT WHEN THINGS
TAKE AN UNEXPECTED TURN,

9
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:42,375
ERZA RUSHES OFF TO DESTROY
THE THUNDER PALACE ON HER OWN...

10
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:44,250
LEAVING NATSU AND LAXUS
IN A FACE OFF

11
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:45,625
OVER THE FATE OF THE GUILD.

12
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:50,500
- ( theme music playing )

13
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

14
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,750
- ( people chattering )

15
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,833
- HEY, WARREN!
WHERE IS HE?

16
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:32,791
DAMN.

17
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,583
- ( Mira speaking )

18
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,791
THAT'S 198.

19
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:56,708
199.

20
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,125
( panting )

21
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,208
THERE'S STILL NOT NEARLY ENOUGH
TO DESTROY THEM ALL...

22
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,625
AT ONCE.
( gasps, groans )

23
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,000
( panting )

24
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:18,000
I'M RUNNING LOW 
ON MAGIC ENERGY.

25
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,708
AND I'M ALMOST
OUT OF TIME.

26
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,500
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

27
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,291
- LESS THAN A MINUTE,
30 SECONDS

28
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,625
UNTIL THE THUNDER PALACE
IS ACTIVATED.

29
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,416
YOU'RE TOO LATE, NATSU.

30
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,125
- OH, YEAH?!
WE'LL SEE!

31
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,916
( grunts )

32
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,416
- YOU... DOUBT ME?!

33
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,375
- AAH!

34
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,833
- ( laughs )

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,291
- ( groans )

36
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,375
I STILL NEED TO CONJURE
ANOTHER 100 SWORDS

37
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,833
TO DESTROY
ALL THE LACRIMAE.

38
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,250
- HEY, FAIRY TAILERS!
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

39
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,625
- THAT'S WARREN.

40
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,250
- THINGS AREN'T LOOKING
SO GOOD FOR US.

41
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,666
CHECK OUT
WHAT'S FLOATING IN THE SKY.

42
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,833
- HE'S USING
HIS TELEPATHY.

43
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,291
- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
PULL TOGETHER,

44
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,333
SO GET OFF YOUR BUTTS
AND LEND US A HAND.

45
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,583
- HMM?
IS THAT WARREN?

46
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,500
- WHAT'S IN THE SKY?

47
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,166
- WHAT THE HECK
ARE THOSE THINGS?

48
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,833
- IF ANY OF YOU
ARE STILL FIGHTING,

49
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,833
JUST GIVE IT A REST
FOR A SECOND.

50
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,458
- HOLD ON.

51
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,666
NOW I HEAR A MAN'S VOICE
INSIDE MY HEAD.

52
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,583
- WARREN'S USING
HIS TELEPATHY.

53
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,750
IT MUST BE IMPORTANT,
'CAUSE HE'S NEVER USED IT

54
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,208
TO CALL EVERYONE
LIKE THIS.

55
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,833
- NOW LISTEN CAREFULLY.

56
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,500
THOSE LACRIMAE UP THERE
ARE PART OF A SPELL

57
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,041
CALLED THE THUNDER PALACE.

58
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,916
LAXUS IS USING IT
TO THREATEN THE ENTIRE TOWN.

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,916
SO WE HAVE TO TAKE IT OUT
BEFORE HE CAN SET IT OFF.

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,375
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME,
SO WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER.

61
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,291
- MAN, HE'S GOT ISSUES.

62
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:09,083
- BUT WHY?
WHY WOULD HE DO THIS?

63
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,291
- WAIT A MINUTE.
HOW DID YOU FIND OUT

64
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,583
ABOUT THE THUNDER PALACE,
WARREN?

65
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,833
- I'VE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER
TO HEAR YOUR VOICE.

66
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,125
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

67
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,291
- Erza:
GRAY.  I SEE.

68
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,916
SO YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO TOLD HIM.

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,958
- YEAH.
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED SOONER,

70
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,666
BUT I HAD TO TRACK
THE GUY DOWN.

71
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,125
- Jet:
WAS THAT ERZA?

72
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,791
YOU MEAN SHE'S NOT
PETRIFIED ANYMORE?

73
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:31,250
WAIT, IF SHE'S BACK
TO NORMAL, THEN... 

74
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,875
- WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER GIRLS?
HOW IS LEVY?

75
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,458
- Cana: THERE'S NO NEED
TO WORRY, BOYS.

76
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:36,791
ALL THE LADIES ARE FINE.

77
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,250
- EVEN JUVIA'S BACK
ON HER FEET.

78
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,250
- YEAH, AND SO IS BISCA.

79
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,750
HEAR THAT, ALZACK?

80
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,375
- THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.

81
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,041
I WAS WORRIED.

82
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,791
I THOUGHT SHE WAS A GONER.

83
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,541
- THERE'S ONE PROBLEM.

84
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,541
MY TELEPATHY CAN'T REACH
ALL THE WAY TO THE GUILD HALL.

85
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,958
SO WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE DUE
WITH THE PEOPLE WHO CAN HEAR ME.

86
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,708
IF WE WORK TOGETHER,
WE CAN DO THIS!

87
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,791
- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE, WARREN!

88
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,166
WHY SHOULD I DO
WHAT YOU SAY

89
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,750
AFTER WHAT YOU DID TO ME?

90
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,041
- OH, UH, MAX...

91
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,875
HEY, I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

92
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,458
I-- I SWEAR IT WASN'T
ANYTHING PERSONAL.

93
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,208
I WAS JUST DESPERATE
TO SAVE THE GIRLS.

94
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,750
- Droy: I GOT A BONE TO PICK
WITH YOU, ALZACK.

95
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,291
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

96
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:14,250
- YEAH, I CAN HEAR YOU.
I'M SORRY ABOUT BEFORE.

97
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,375
- SORRY AIN'T GONNA CUT IT,
YOU LITTLE COWARD.

98
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,333
YOU SHOT ME WHEN 
I WASN'T LOOKING!

99
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,125
- Macao: YOU BETTER WATCH
YOUR BACK, WAKABA!

100
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,583
- ( overlapping clamor )

101
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,958
- HMM...

102
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,333
- WOULD YOU IDIOTS
QUIT YELLING AT EACH OTHER?!

103
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:39,541
- All: HEY, SHUT UP!
PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH, GRAY!

104
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,458
- WE DON'T HAVE TIME
TO BE GOOFING OFF!

105
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,666
WE GOTTA HURRY
AND TAKE DOWN THOSE LACRIMAE!

106
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,125
- ( overlapping arguing )

107
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,291
- SHUT UP!

108
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:04,333
- ( all slightly gasp )

109
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,875
- WE SHOULDN'T BE WASTING

110
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,500
OUR TIME ARGUING.

111
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,666
THE CITIZENS OF MAGNOLIA
ARE IN DANGER,

112
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,083
AND WE'RE THE ONLY ONES
WHO CAN HELP THEM.

113
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,375
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
WORK TOGETHER.

114
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,208
LOOK, I KNOW THINGS
HAVE BEEN ROUGH

115
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,375
WITH ALL OF US
FIGHTING AGAINST EACH OTHER.

116
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:21,208
BUT WE COULD DO ANYTHING
IF WE PULL TOGETHER.

117
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,083
THAT'S WHAT YOU GUYS
HAVE TAUGHT ME.

118
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,500
I KNOW THAT I'M STILL
FAIRLY NEW TO FAIRY TAIL,

119
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,791
BUT I PROMISE YOU...

120
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,416
I LOVE BEING
A PART OF THIS GUILD

121
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,083
JUST AS MUCH AS 
THE REST OF YOU.

122
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:36,833
I ALWAYS DREAMED OF
JOINING FAIRY TAIL SOMEDAY.

123
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,750
IT'S WHAT I WANTED MORE
THAN ANYTHING IN THIS WORLD.

124
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,625
NOW THAT I'VE JOINED...

125
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,500
IT--

126
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,458
IT MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME.

127
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,791
IF YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY...

128
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,958
LET'S WORK AS A GUILD
AND SAVE OUR TOWN!

129
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,125
- LUCY...

130
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:02,000
- IF NONE OF YOU
ARE UP TO THE CHALLENGE,

131
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,166
THEN I'LL DO THIS ALONE.

132
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,916
I'LL DESTROY
THOSE THINGS MYSELF.

133
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,208
- ( all snicker softly )

134
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,666
- WHAT'S IT GONNA BE, GUYS?

135
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,791
YOU HEARD THE LADY.
YOU GONNA LET A NEWBIE

136
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,125
SHOW YOU UP LIKE THAT?

137
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,375
- Jet: SHE MAY NOT
HAVE BEEN A MEMBER

138
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,666
FOR AS LONG AS SOME OF US,

139
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,416
BUT SHE'S GOT MORE
FAIRY TAIL PRIDE

140
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,875
THAN ALL OF US
PUT TOGETHER.

141
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,666
- Alzack: RIGHT.
WE GOTTA SAVE THE TOWN.

142
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,000
WE CAN WORK OUT
OUR OTHER PROBLEMS LATER.

143
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,958
- Wakaba: JEEZ, NOW WE GOTTA
AGREE TO HELP,

144
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,875
OR WE'RE GONNA LOOK BAD, HUH?

145
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,708
- Macao:
YOU DONE GOOD, LUCY.

146
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,166
YOU GOT EVERYONE
TO COOL THEIR JETS.

147
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,625
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
ARE YOU READY DO DO THIS?

148
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,250
- THANK YOU.

149
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,500
- THANK YOU, LUCY.

150
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,333
- Max: WARREN,
WE'LL WORK OUT OUR ISSUES

151
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,833
AFTER WE GET 
THE JOB DONE.

152
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,541
- Wakaba: CAREFUL, MACAO.

153
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,083
AN OLD MAN LIKE YOU
CAN'T HANDLE ALL THIS ACTION.

154
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,916
- YOU CALLIN' ME OLD?
THAT'S RICH.

155
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,333
( laughs )

156
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,750
- ( sniffles )
RIGHT.  LET'S DO THIS.

157
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,083
- BUT THEY'VE GOT
THAT BODY LINK MAGIC!

158
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,166
IF WE ATTACK THEM, THEN WE'RE
JUST GONNA GET ATTACKED

159
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,000
RIGHT BACK.

160
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,458
AND IT'S GONNA HURT.

161
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,125
- WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO DEAL.

162
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:15,333
I'VE ALWAYS LOOKED UP
TO FAIRY TAIL, AND NOW...

163
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,708
I COULDN'T EVEN IMAGINE
MY LIFE WITHOUT IT.

164
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,375
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH
IN SUCH A SHORT TIME.

165
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:23,791
AND NO MATTER WHAT, EVERYONE'S
ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR ME.

166
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,500
I REALLY FEEL LIKE THIS IS
WHERE I'M MEANT TO BE.

167
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,458
IT'S MY HOME.
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

168
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,708
I'VE FINALLY FOUND
A PLACE WHERE I BELONG.

169
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,083
SO I'LL FIGHT.

170
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,875
'CAUSE I DON'T WANNA LOSE IT.

171
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,500
FAIRY TAIL'S MADE ME
WHO I AM TODAY--

172
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,958
A STRONG, CAPABLE WIZARD.

173
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,500
- MM.

174
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:44,541
I'M RIGHT WITH YOU!
- ( softly chuckles )

175
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,958
LET'S GO!
- AYE!  YOU GOT IT.

176
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,791
- I'LL TAKE THE 200
TO THE NORTH.

177
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,500
EVERYBODY ELSE
CAN TAKE THE REST.

178
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:55,958
WE CAN DO THIS!

179
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,708
- WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO MISS ANY OF THEM.

180
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,541
ICE MAKE LANCE.

181
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:00,708
( grunts )

182
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,541
- DEMON BLAST!

183
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,041
- NOW!

184
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,291
- ( grunts )

185
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,500
- HA!

186
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,875
- ( grunting )

187
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,041
-NOW GO FORTH,
MY SWORDS.

188
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,541
( grunts loudly )

189
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,750
- AAH!

190
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,041
- MAX SPEED ATTACK!

191
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,250
- WHOA, WHAT'S GOING ON?
- ( all murmuring )

192
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,958
- ARE THOSE SOME KIND
OF FIREWORKS?

193
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,208
- LOOKS LIKE FAIRY TAIL
IS SPARING NO EXPENSE

194
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,875
FOR THE HARVEST FESTIVAL, HUH?

195
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,666
- ( townspeople chattering )

196
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,666
- WE SAVED THE TOWN.

197
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,333
- ( both scream )

198
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,333
- ( all scream )

199
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,250
- ( both groaning, screaming )

200
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,541
- AAH!

201
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,791
- HMM?

202
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,208
- Both: AAH!

203
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,666
- ( screaming continues )

204
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:28,500
- ( all groaning, coughing )

205
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,041
- YOU SEE?
- ( growls )

206
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,041
- TOLD YOU IT WOULDN'T WORK.

207
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,833
- ( all groaning )

208
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:41,041
- Erza:
IS EVERYBODY OKAY?

209
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,875
I CAN'T BELIEVE ALL OF YOU.

210
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:47,541
HOW COULD YOU DO
SOMETHING SO RECKLESS?

211
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:51,583
- WE SHOULD PROBABLY BE
ASKING YOU THE SAME THING.

212
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,458
- ( Erza chuckles )

213
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:57,875
WE REALLY DO MAKE
A GREAT GUILD, DON'T WE?

214
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,375
- Macao:
WE'D BE A LOT BETTER

215
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,583
IF LAXUS WOULD OUTGROW
HIS REBELLIOUS STAGE.

216
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,791
- ( Wakaba groans )
YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.

217
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,208
- Droy: HEY, ALZACK,
YOU DOIN' ALL RIGHT?

218
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,583
- YEAH, DROY, I'M FINE.
THANKS.

219
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:12,791
- WEREN'T YOU SAYING
SOMETHING ABOUT

220
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,833
OUR GUILD NEEDING A CHANGE?

221
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:18,250
THAT'S FUNNY. I DON'T SEE
ANYTHING THAT NEEDS CHANGING.

222
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:21,041
IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYBODY'S
GETTING ALONG JUST FINE TO ME.

223
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,250
HOW DO YOU EXPECT
TO BECOME OUR MASTER

224
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,166
IF YOU CAN'T GET ALONG
WITH THE REST OF US?

225
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,125
- ( growls )

226
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,500
AAH!

227
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,708
I'LL TAKE FAIRY TAIL

228
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,875
BY FORCE IF I HAVE TO.

229
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,791
WATCH ME!

230
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,583
IT'S MINE!

231
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,041
- ( chatter, laughter )

232
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,041
- LAXUS, YOU'VE GONE
TOO FAR THIS TIME.

233
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,041
YOU GOTTA STOP THIS
RIGHT NOW.

234
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:53,541
PLEASE.  WHILE YOUR
GRANDFATHER'S STILL ALIVE.

235
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,708
- I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME
FOR YOU TO GIVE UP THE FIGHT!

236
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,625
YOU'RE NOT TAKING OVER
FAIRY TAIL!

237
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,708
'CAUSE I'M NEVER GONNA
LET THAT HAPPEN!

238
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,750
- OH, YEAH?

239
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,500
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU'RE MESSING WITH.

240
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,333
I'M A LOT STRONGER THAN 
ANY OF YOU EVER DREAMED.

241
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,708
I COULD TAKE OVER THE GUILD
BY FORCE ANYTIME I WANT.

242
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,833
AND YOU'RE NOT STRONG ENOUGH
TO STOP ME!

243
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,791
YOUR BEST BET IS TO JUST
GET OUT OF MY WAY!

244
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,791
- IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE JUST
BEGGING FOR SOMEONE

245
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,416
TO KNOCK YOU DOWN
A FEW NOTCHES.

246
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,250
I COULD DO THAT.

247
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,458
FIRE DRAGON...

248
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,250
IRON FIST!

249
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,833
( gasps )

250
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,333
- COME ON.

251
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,916
THAT ALL YOU GOT?!

252
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,416
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO
A WHOLE LOT BETTER THAN THAT.

253
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,291
I'VE GOT MORE POWER THAN YOU
IN MY LITTLE FINGER.

254
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,666
- ( both shout )

255
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,583
( grunting )

256
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,958
- ( groaning )

257
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,041
MAN, I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.

258
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,375
HE'S SO STRONG.

259
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,125
- CAN YOU FEEL
THE ELECTRIC ENERGY

260
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,875
OF THE LIGHTNING
I'VE SUMMONED FORTH?

261
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,416
- WHAT THE HECK?
I CAN'T MOVE A MUSCLE.

262
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,625
- IT WILL PLUMMET
FROM THE HEAVENS,

263
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,875
AND TURN YOU INTO ASH!

264
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,666
RAGING BOLT!

265
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,625
AAH!

266
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,250
( laughs )

267
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:57,208
SO, WHO'S THE MOST POWERFUL
WIZARD IN OUR GUILD NOW?

268
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,125
( cackling )

269
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,791
GUESS YOU CAN'T REALLY
ANSWER THAT QUESTION

270
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,000
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN
TURNED TO DUST!

271
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,750
- THAT'S NO WAY TO TREAT
ONE OF YOUR COMRADES.

272
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,000
- ( exhales )

273
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,500
- ONLY A NUT JOB LIKE YOU
WOULD BE SO GIDDY

274
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,708
ABOUT TAKING DOWN
ONE OF HIS FRIENDS.

275
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:20,125
THANKFULLY, I GOT TO HIM
BEFORE YOU DID.

276
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,125
I WANNA BE THE ONE
TO TAKE THIS KID OUT.

277
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,000
- GAJEEL...

278
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,208
- I HAVE ANOTHER CHALLENGER?

279
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,875
( laughs )
- ( Natsu yelps )

280
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,250
- YOU'LL ALL END UP
DEAD SOON ANYWAY.

281
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:36,875
ANYBODY WHO DARES TO STAND
IN MY WAY WILL BE ELIMINATED!

282
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,208
- LET ME TAKE CARE
OF LAXUS, OKAY?

283
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,875
YOU STAY OUTTA THIS.

284
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,750
- NO DEAL.  I GOT A SCORE
TO SETTLE WITH THAT PUNK.

285
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,750
THIS GUY'S NOT MESSING AROUND.

286
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,833
HE'S A REAL MONSTER.

287
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:51,750
YOU CAN TELL HE'S GOT MAKAROV'S
BLOOD RUNNING THROUGH HIM.

288
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,750
IT SUCKS, BUT I THINK WE'RE
GONNA HAVE TO FIGHT HIM

289
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:55,541
AS A TEAM.

290
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,166
YOU AND ME.

291
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,583
- AIN'T NO WAY!

292
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,291
I'M GONNA TAKE DOWN LAXUS
ON MY OWN!

293
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,041
BESIDES, I'D NEVER TEAM UP
WITH A GOON LIKE YOU,

294
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,291
SO STAY OUTTA THIS!

295
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,250
- JUST LOOK AT HIM.
- HMM?

296
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,750
- IS THAT THE SAME GUY
YOU REMEMBER?

297
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,958
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

298
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,166
YOU SCARED?
YOU SHOULD BE.

299
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,666
( laughs )

300
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,458
- FAR AS I CAN TELL,
THAT'S AN ENEMY.

301
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,000
IF WE WANNA SAVE THE GUILD,

302
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,000
WE GOTTA STOP HIM
RIGHT HERE AND NOW.

303
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:24,416
EVERYBODY ELSE HAS EITHER BEEN
KNOCKED OUT BY ANOTHER MEMBER,

304
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,125
OR ZAPPED
BY HIS THUNDER PALACE.

305
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,625
DON'T YOU GET IT?

306
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,416
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES LEFT
WHO CAN STOP HIM.

307
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,916
- SINCE WHEN ARE YOU
SO PRO-FAIRY TAIL?

308
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
- I COULD PROTECT OR DESTROY
WHATEVER THE HELL I WANT TO!

309
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,750
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID...

310
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,291
THAT THE SKY'S NOT
BIG ENOUGH FOR TWO DRAGONS.

311
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,958
- YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

312
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,166
BUT THERE AIN'T NO DRAGONS
FLYING IN THE SKY NOW.

313
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,041
NOT WITH ALL THIS LIGHTNING.

314
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,541
- JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR,
THIS IS GONNA BE THE ONLY TIME

315
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,000
I EVER TEAM UP WITH YOU.

316
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,750
- TRUST ME, THIS AIN'T FUN
FOR ME, EITHER.

317
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,791
WE'LL FIGHT IT OUT SOMEDAY.

318
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:56,750
- Both:
LET'S DO THIS!

319
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,500
- ( grunts )

320
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,375
- ( all grunting )

321
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,000
- USE YOUR BREATH!

322
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:17,333
- FIRE DRAGON ROAR!

323
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,750
- IRON DRAGON CLUB!

324
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,416
IRON DRAGON SWORD!

325
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,250
AAH!

326
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,666
- ( laughs )

327
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,333
- FIRE DRAGON...

328
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:33,625
BRILLIANT FLAME!

329
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,625
- ( shouts )

330
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,041
IRON DRAGON LANCE!

331
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,500
DEMON LOGS!

332
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,500
- FIRE DRAGON...

333
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,250
- IRON DRAGON...

334
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,416
- Both: ROAR!

335
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,666
- DON'T TELL ME THAT'S THE BEST
THE TWO OF YOU CAN DO.

336
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,833
NEITHER OF YOU DESERVE
THE TITLE OF DRAGON SLAYER.

337
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,666
- WHAT THE HECK? HE DOESN'T
EVEN HAVE A SCRATCH ON HIM.

338
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,583
- BUT HOW?
I DON'T GET IT.

339
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,583
I KNOW HE'S STRONG AND ALL,
BUT WE WHIPPED OUT

340
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,000
A TON OF DRAGON-SLAYING MAGIC
ON HIM.

341
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,958
HOW'S HE STILL STANDING?

342
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,375
- I'LL LET YOU GUYS IN
ON A LITTLE SECRET.

343
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,791
I HAVEN'T TOLD ANYONE
ABOUT THIS,

344
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,916
'CAUSE I REALLY HATE
THE OLD MAN'S LECTURES,

345
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,083
BUT I GUESS I CAN TRUST
THE TWO OF YOU.

346
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,666
( roars )

347
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,541
( shouts )

348
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,166
- YOU GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME.

349
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,375
- OH, NO WAY.

350
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,083
- LIGHTNING DRAGON...

351
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,791
- I HAD NO IDEA THAT LAXUS
IS A DRAGON SLAYER TOO.

352
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,208
- ...ROAR!

353
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,791
- ( Natsu and Gajeel groaning )

354
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,291
- YOU'RE STILL ALIVE?

355
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,750
DAMN.  I WAS SURE
THAT WOULD FINISH YOU OFF.

356
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,375
WHY WON'T YOU JUST
KICK THE BUCKET ALREADY?

357
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,041
- ( Natsu straining )
I CAN'T MOVE.

358
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,166
- ME EITHER.
( groans )

359
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,791
- YOU TWO LOSERS.

360
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,791
ERZA AND MYSTOGAN.

361
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,458
THE OLD GEEZER.

362
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,666
THOSE WEAKLINGS 
IN FAIRY TAIL...

363
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,083
AND THE PATHETIC PEOPLE
OF MAGNOLIA--

364
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,458
YOUR TIME IS OVER NOW!

365
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,333
- WHERE'S ALL THAT
MAGIC ENERGY COMING FROM?

366
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,750
- THIS FEELS FAMILIAR.

367
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,375
LIKE ONE OF GRAMPS' SPELLS.

368
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,291
- THIS GUY'S INSANE.

369
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:57,500
HE'S TRYING TO CAST MAKAROV'S
ULTIMATE JUDGMENT SPELL.

370
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:01,000
IT'LL TARGET ANYONE THE CASTER
SEES AS THEIR ENEMY.

371
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,125
- ( shouts )
- Gajeel: WE'RE AS GOOD AS DEAD.

372
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,041
- ( laughs )

373
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,666
YOU'RE RIGHT, METAL HEAD.

374
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,500
I'VE MASTERED
THE FAIRY LAW SPELL.

375
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,500
- THAT'S THE SAME SPELL
THAT DEFEATED MASTER JOSE.

376
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:15,708
NO.

377
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,333
- LAXUS, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

378
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:21,125
- ( inhales, growls )

379
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,583
- DON'T DO THIS!

380
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:25,041
- ( growls )

381
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,708
- LAXUS, STOP!

382
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,416
- Natsu: LEVY?
- Gajeel: YOU IDIOT!

383
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,375
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

384
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:39,083
- YOU'VE GOTTA SEE THE MASTER.
HE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

385
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,750
MASTER MAKAROV--

386
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,208
I MEAN, YOUR GRANDFATHER...

387
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,583
IS CLOSE TO DEATH.

388
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,375
- ( both exhale )

389
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,458
- STOP THIS NOW!
GO SEE HIM ONE LAST TIME

390
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,250
PLEASE!  HURRY BEFORE
IT'S TOO LATE!

391
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,208
- NO.  IT CAN'T BE.

392
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,125
GRAMPS IS GONNA DIE?

393
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:12,833
NO WAY.

394
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,583
- PLEASE, LAXUS!

395
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:25,208
- THIS IS WORKING OUT
PERFECTLY FOR ME.

396
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,416
NOW THAT THE OLD MAN
IS AT DEATH'S DOOR, 

397
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,291
I HAVE AN EVEN BETTER CHANCE
AT BECOMING

398
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,958
FAIRY TAIL'S NEW MASTER.

399
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,750
- ( gasps )

400
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,083
- DAMN YOU.

401
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:42,000
- THIS WILL BE THE DAWN
OF A NEW ERA FOR FAIRY TAIL.

402
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:46,208
I'LL REBUILD EVERYTHING
FROM THE GROUND UP.

403
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,458
I'LL FORM THE ULTIMATE GUILD.

404
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,375
ONE SO POWERFUL...

405
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,041
ALL WILL TREMBLE
IN OUR NAME!

406
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,583
- NO, LAXUS.

407
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,083
- YOU CAN'T DO THIS!

408
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,708
DON'T YOU EVEN CARE 
ABOUT GRAMPS AT ALL?

409
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:02,125
- FAIRY LAW!

410
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:03,375
( grunts )

411
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,750
- ( end theme playing )

412
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:46,083
- ( singing in Japanese )

413
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,625
- NOT TO TOOT MY OWN HORN,
BUT I'M A VERY CHARMING CAT.

414
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:18,250
- HUH?  I DON'T GET WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, BUDDY.

415
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,083
- WE'RE DISCUSSING WHY
I SHOULD BE THE STAR

416
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,750
OF THE FANTASIA PARADE!

417
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,375
I MEAN, NOT ONLY AM I
OVERFLOWING WITH CUTENESS,

418
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,375
BUT I'M A WIZARD, I CAN FLY

419
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:27,208
AND I'M A TALKING CAT,
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!

420
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,458
BESIDES, I'M PRETTY MUCH
FAIRY TAIL'S UNOFFICIAL MASCOT.

421
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:30,875
SO IT WOULD ONLY MAKE SENSE
THAT I WOULD-- 

422
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:33,500
- ( Natsu and Happy speaking )

423
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:35,375
- Happy:
WAY TO CUT ME OFF, NATSU!

424
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:36,750
- MY BAD. I WASN'T
PAYING ATTENTION.

425
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,166
WHAT WERE WE TALKING
ABOUT AGAIN?

426
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,291
- I WAS EXPLAINING WHY I WOULD
BE THE PERFECT CHOICE

427
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,083
TO BE THE STAR --
- UH-OH! WE'RE OUT OF TIME.
