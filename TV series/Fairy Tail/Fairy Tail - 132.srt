159
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:52,958
mission before!

160
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,083
Nah, I think I'll pass.

161
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,708
[GILDARTS] Yep, sure heard
her mother say that a lot.

162
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:00,583
Just go already!

163
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,375
[GILDARTS] See you later! Bye!

164
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,083
So is that what you'd
call going easy

165
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,041
on your poor old man?

166
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,000
I don't need to
cut him any slack.

167
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,541
Geez, that guy.

168
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,458
He's always been so cool and
collected under pressure before.

169
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,125
[PRIEST A]
He's had another one?

170
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,291
[PRIEST B] The nightmares
are getting worse

171
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,291
with each passing day.

172
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,541
[PRIEST C] We've
tried giving him sedatives,

173
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,166
but it doesn't seem to help.

174
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,958
[MEDIC] Are you
feeling any better?

175
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,708
[PRIEST B]
Were you able to sleep?

176
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:27,583
[ARCHBISHOP] Yes.
But the dream has returned.

177
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,458
[MEDIC]
You had it again tonight?

178
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,041
[ARCHBISHOP]
I did. Such horrors.

179
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,958
How could they spring
from my own mind?

180
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,208
However, I believe
there must be some purpose

181
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,166
behind these visions.

182
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,750
The very thought
of sleep terrifies me now.

183
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,416
[MEDIC] But sleep
is crucial to maintaining

184
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
your good health, sir.

185
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,500
[ARCHBISHOP] The time for the
Founding Festival draws near.

186
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,333
We must summon the cardinals
in the event some misfortune

187
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,583
was to befall me.

188
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,166
[MEDIC] Please,
you mustn't talk like that!

189
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,208
[ARCHBISHOP] I cannot
take this lightly.

190
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:03,458
Facing unpleasant facts is
part and parcel of leadership.

191
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,250
I am bound by
my solemn duty

192
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,875
as the Archbishop of Zentopia.

193
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:14,166
Whoa. This place
looks kinda familiar.

194
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,750
[ERZA] It's where Lucy grew up.

195
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,333
[GRAY] Does the
family still own it?

196
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,708
[HAPPY] Well, it looks
like someone's been taking

197
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,625
really good care of it.

198
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,208
[CARLA] I suppose they'd
want to keep it clean

199
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,708
and well maintained until
a buyer can be found.

200
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,583
Apparently,
that hasn't been easy.

201
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,500
People have checked it out,
but nobody's made an offer

202
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:29,500
to buy it.

203
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,416
Because nobody
can afford it.

204
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,250
Such good memories.

205
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,500
Your house always reminded
me of a beautiful palace

206
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,000
out of a storybook.

207
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,916
[MICHELLE] I had
so much fun here!

208
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,875
[LUCY] Wait, you've
been here before?

209
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,041
[MICHELLE sobs]

210
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,708
We-We used to play
together all the time.

211
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,375
[LUCY] Uh. That's right!
Of course we did.

212
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,250
[cries]

213
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,333
You remember all the pretty
clothes you made for me?

214
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,750
[LUCY, nervously]
Yeah, sure... I remember...

215
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,041
You made clothes?

216
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,250
I never imagined you
were the handy type.

217
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,541
I bet you two must
have been adorable.

218
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,416
She used to make
the cutest outfits out of

219
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,666
colored paper and flowers.

220
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,875
Huh?!

221
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,166
Oh, wow.

222
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,041
How would ya be able
to make clothes outta paper

223
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:07,958
and flowers?

224
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:08,958
Well, uh...

225
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,750
[LUCY] Don't be creepy!

226
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,375
[ERZA] Now, do you think
you can finally get serious?

227
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,583
Is that too much to ask?

228
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,041
[HAPPY, GRAY, and NATSU]
No, ma'am!

229
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:22,125
Okay. Where do you think
we should get started?

230
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,791
Yes, and what type of clues
should we be looking for?

231
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,416
[ERZA] The first order
of business is splitting

232
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,291
into teams of two.

233
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,500
Each team will take
a different area and scour

234
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,000
every room from top to bottom.

235
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,625
We're looking for old clocks.

236
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,666
Anything related to clocks.
If something reminds you of

237
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,041
the inscription,
take note of it.

238
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,458
Any literature written
in ancient Potamelian.

239
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,083
Anything out of the ordinary.

240
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:47,875
Clues may present themselves in
any form, so keep an open mind.

241
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,000
[MICHELLE] Oh my.
There's certainly a lot

242
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,291
of furniture up here.

243
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,458
[LUCY] Yeah. There's a
lot of stuff in general.

244
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:57,250
Some of it priceless.
And I'm sure some of it's

245
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,000
completely worthless.

246
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,458
[MICHELLE] When
was this painted?

247
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,041
I remember
posing for this.

248
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,875
It wasn't long before
Mom passed away.

249
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,833
I had a heck of a time
sitting still for this painting.

250
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,791
All I wanted to do was play.

251
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,166
It was really hard on me
when I lost her.

252
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,791
Unfortunately, I took it
out on everyone around me.

253
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,166
I think I was a little terror.

254
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,583
[LUCY] I probably just made the
whole thing harder for them.

255
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,125
[MICHELLE] It's okay.

256
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:34,000
Someday I'm gonna make enough
money to buy this place.

257
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,333
I'll put everything
back how it used to be!

258
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,291
Or as close as I can.

259
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,708
Really? Do you mean it?

260
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,208
[LUCY] Yeah!

261
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,875
[gasps happily]

262
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:46,958
[LUCY] Is something wrong?

263
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,583
[MICHELLE] Oh, no.
It's a wonderful idea.

264
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,625
That would make
Uncle Jude very happy.

265
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,875
[LUCY] You just
gave me another idea!

266
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,000
[MICHELLE] Wow!
This is amazing!

267
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,083
This was Dad's library.

268
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,958
He's actually the reason
that I grew up to be such

269
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,375
a bookworm myself.

270
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,750
There's so many!

271
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,250
And I'm willing to bet
there's a book here

272
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,125
that'll give us a clue.

273
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:15,208
[LUCY] Oh man, looking through
all these is gonna take forever.

274
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,000
Hmm?

275
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:21,708
[MICHELLE] "To My Daughter".
What about this one?

276
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:24,625
It just seems kind of special.

277
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,333
[LUCY] All the pages
are completely blank.

278
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,833
The book is called
"To My Daughter"

279
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,875
but there's nothing inside.

280
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,583
Do you think maybe
there's been some kind of

281
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:44,000
spell cast on it? And
I wonder something else.

282
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:46,666
[MICHELLE] Is he asleep?

283
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,416
[LUCY] Uh-umm.

284
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,791
He's doing a search.

285
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,625
If anyone can figure this
out, it's Grandpa Crux!

286
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,250
[pop sound, screams]

287
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,458
[traumitized giggles]

288
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,833
Any luck?

289
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,416
[CRUX] What we have here
is nothing more than a stack

290
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,875
of incredibly old paper.

291
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,666
There are no spells,
invisible inks,

292
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,041
or watermarks to
be found inside.

293
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,666
And it would appear
to be the case that

294
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,541
your late father himself
bound the book by hand.

295
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:12,041
[LUCY] I see. Is there anything
else worth mentioning?

296
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,750
[CRUX] I do have
a suggestion for you.

297
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,666
It might serve you well to
consider approaching this book

298
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,208
as a riddle of some sort.

299
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,791
Think of the title,
"To My Daughter".

300
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,250
Perhaps it could be an anagram?

301
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,291
Yeah, you're right.

302
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,125
So we should rearrange
the letters?

303
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,500
[whining]

304
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,041
How are we supposed
to know what in the heck

305
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,500
to look for, huh?

306
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,166
Let's look for some food.

307
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,375
[NATSU] Oh!

308
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:35,458
[NATSU groans]

309
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,791
[NATSU] Are you guys
just playing a game?

310
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,041
[WENDY] No, we're not.

311
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,083
[ERZA] Please, be quiet.

312
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,833
[GRAY] We're tryin'
to concentrate.

313
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,791
[HAPPY] Is it
some kinda puzzle?

314
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,541
We're figuring
out anagrams.

315
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,708
Yeah, of course.
I totally knew that!

316
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,583
It's basically
just a word puzzle.

317
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,625
Sounds like more fun
than what I was doin'!

318
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:51,833
Can I try?

319
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,958
[sneezes]

320
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,750
You just ruined
our train of thought!

321
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,333
And we were all
working so hard on it!

322
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,166
Whoops, my bad.

323
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,083
[steel rings]

324
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,291
[scared yelling]

325
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,500
I was on the verge
of a huge breakthrough!

326
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,583
Erza looks pretty
serious, doesn't she?

327
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:05,750
Yeah, no kiddin'.

328
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,583
Remind me never to
break her concentration.

329
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,166
Well I suppose that we
should start collecting

330
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,708
the letters again.

331
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,500
Wait. Do you see that?

332
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,833
[pop sound, screams]

333
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,916
[CRUX] The letters before
you spell the word 'myth.'

334
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,041
[WENDY] Yeah.

335
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,791
[CRUX] Hmph. That
could be important.

336
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,041
[GRAY] I think he might
be on to something.

337
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,708
[ERZA] So what can we spell
with the other letters?

338
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:28,333
Duo.

339
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,083
Great.

340
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,041
Myth.

341
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,291
Oh, I know!
Check it out!

342
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,958
There is a pair of books known
as "the two great myths"!

343
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,625
Both were written
by Will Neville.

344
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,291
One is called "Life of
the Clockwork" and it also

345
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:43,166
just so happens to be where the
strange inscription came from!

346
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,833
You have that book
in your apartment!

347
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:45,791
Isn't that right?

348
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,916
Yep! Talk about
a coincidence!

349
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,166
And the other book
should be right here!

350
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,166
[LUCY] Tadah! "Key of
the Starry Heavens"!

351
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,083
[NATSU] Isn't that
just a picture book?

352
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,958
It's not 'just
a picture book'.

353
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,875
It's an amazing
work of art!

354
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,416
Well, whatever it is,
I bet ya the word 'key'

355
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,541
is pretty important.

356
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,125
[ERZA] It seems like
the perfect place to begin

357
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,875
looking for a clue.

358
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,208
[CARLA gasps]

359
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,333
[LUCY] You guys think it
could be another anagram?

360
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,791
No, probably not.

361
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,375
But maybe if we
look at it differently

362
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:14,875
we'll figure something out.

363
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,250
[DEEP VOICE] Don't.

364
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:17,875
[CARLA gasps]

365
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,125
What's the matter?

366
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,625
I don't know if there
will be anything to do

367
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,375
with the clock hand or not,
but maybe my dad left

368
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,583
some kind of message for me
to find inside this book.

369
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,333
[LUCY] Uh. Is there
something you'd like to

370
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,375
share with the group, Happy?

371
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,708
This one of my very
favorite stories!

372
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,250
Some say "The Tortoise
and the Hare" is an

373
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,333
amazing work
of art as well!

374
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:39,041
[MALE VOICE] Would you be so
kind as to hand over the book?

375
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,833
I'm not givin' this
to some random stranger!

376
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,958
[MALE VOICE] I don't find your
joke to be very amusing. Sorry.

377
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,750
[NATSU] What's goin' on?

378
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,750
[GRAY] The door
handle just blew up!

379
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,875
[MALE VOICE] What a
rudimentary understanding.

380
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,625
What happened was the handle
expanded to twice its size,

381
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,958
which in turn,
broke down the door.

382
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,333
Whoa! That's crazy!

383
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,708
I don't believe it!

384
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,291
[HAPPY] He's an Exceed!

385
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:04,875
But he doesn't look like anyone
I remember seeing in Extalia.

386
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:05,583
Hmph.

387
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,083
[CARLA] He wasn't there.

388
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,625
He must have hatched from one
of the eggs that were sent

389
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,291
to Earth Land all those
years ago! Just like us!

390
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,291
[NATSU] Tell us who you are!

391
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,458
The brains of
the Legion Platoon.

392
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,125
The name's Samuel.

393
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,791
So you clowns came
snoopin' around

394
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:19,791
for us after all?

395
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,458
Give back what
you stole from us!

396
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:22,041
I'll pass.

397
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,041
Say what?

398
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,791
[SAMUEL] I consider this
an amazing feat.

399
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,125
Really quite
spectacularly played.

400
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,666
I mean, I was certain that you'd
do exactly as I'd predicted

401
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,541
by coming here
and finding a clue.

402
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,958
So, of course, you found one.

403
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,291
I amaze myself.

404
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,125
Can I turn him
into a cat-sicle?

405
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,541
Only if I can barbeque
him as soon as you're done!

406
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,166
You ready?

407
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,250
I am.

408
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:44,666
Then let's go!

409
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,375
Ice Make: Lance!

410
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,125
You'll get nothing
more from us!

411
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,541
Fire Dragon Roar!

412
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:52,416
Hmph.

413
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,791
What the--?

414
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,041
[screaming]
Don't ruin everything!

415
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,916
I just decided that
my number one goal in life

416
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,458
is to buy this
place back someday!

417
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,916
What just happened?

418
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,791
Some guy came outta nowhere
and deflected our attack!

419
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,625
[MAN] Some guy? I'm the
spearhead of the Legion Platoon.

420
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:14,291
My name is Dan Straight!
So check me out!

421
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,708
Another personality
disorder?

422
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,958
[DAN] You guys saw what I
did with my shield, right?

423
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,166
It's called Ricochet!

424
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,458
Get it?

425
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,041
This baby takes any
attack you can throw at it

426
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,708
and sends it right back atcha!

427
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,000
No. That's a
powerful shield.

428
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,083
We gotta be careful about
what we hit it with.

429
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,958
We don't wanna turn
Lucy's childhood home

430
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,458
into a burned up
pile of rubble.

431
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,583
Why do all of you guys gotta
be such pains in the butt?

432
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:34,666
He'll attack.

433
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,958
Come at me, it'll be
the same as before!

434
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,916
Not if I melt that thing first!

435
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,916
[LUCY] Can we please
take this outside?

436
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,083
That girl.

437
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,666
She's the one who
has the book we need.

438
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,416
Huh?

439
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,708
Lucy!

440
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:50,791
I'm being serious, I'm
gonna lead him outside!

441
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,500
But it could be more
dangerous out there!

442
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:53,916
Is this what you're after?

443
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,791
Come and get it,
I double dare ya!

444
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,208
[DAN gasps]

445
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,791
Ka... pow!

446
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:05,541
[LUCY screams]

447
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,166
Such beauty! Kapow!

448
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,750
Such incredible beauty!

449
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,833
It's as if love's arrow's shot
me straight through the heart!

450
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,666
But it just keeps beating
stronger and stronger!

451
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,416
It's almost too much
for me to handle,

452
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,583
but I can't get enough!

453
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,333
And what do they
call this loveliness?

454
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,208
Uh, Lucy.

455
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:24,250
Lucy! I just
can't take it!

456
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,375
Lucy.

457
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,333
Oh!

458
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,375
Stunning perfection has a name!

459
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,083
Mind if I
call you Lulu?

460
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:31,958
Louie?

463
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:34,791
[LUCY] I don't know.

464
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:35,791
I feared for this.

[yells excitedly]

466
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:38,708
[DAN] That voice!

467
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:39,666
Those eyes!

468
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,291
Those lips!

00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:40,958
That hair!

00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,125
That chest!

00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,041
That waist!

Those legs!

The perfect Fibonacci
sequence in human form!

Love on two legs!
Beauty personified!

L! O! V! E! Spells love!

476
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,125
I just got
super confused.

477
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,791
True love!

478
00:18:58,791 --> 00:18:59,875
[ERZA] Lucy!

479
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,708
Stay back!

480
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,583
No one comes between
me and my love!

481
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,958
You two make a
break for it.

482
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,458
They must not get their
hands on that book!

483
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:10,541
Right!

484
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,625
As for the rest
of you, cover the girls

485
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:13,833
while they escape!

486
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,583
Uh. I just blanked out.

487
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,666
We got too overwhelmed
by that craziness.

488
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,291
Well, your ego seems
to be extremely healthy.

489
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,208
You shouldn't
underestimate us.

490
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,708
Let me beat up
this jerk!

491
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,916
Your job here is
to keep Lucy safe.

492
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,208
So get moving, now!

493
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:27,958
Let's go!

494
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,000
Okay!

495
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,333
I wasn't finished
talking to you!

496
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,625
[LUCY] Don't blow
up the house!

497
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,416
Now, then.

498
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,458
Taking into consideration
the layout of estates

499
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,291
such as this one. Yes.

500
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,791
[SAMUEL] Dan, I trust that
you'll neutralize Titania?

501
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:48,625
[DAN] Yeah, I got it!

502
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:49,750
[ERZA] Engarde!

503
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,041
The same effect
on physical attacks?

504
00:19:58,708 --> 00:19:59,708
But how?

505
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,583
What kind of
magic is this?

506
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,750
[DAN] Wow, that was kinda cute.
You are quite attractive

507
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,125
in your own way.

508
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,625
But it's like a
teacup compared to

509
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,208
the ocean of loveliness
my Lulu possesses.

510
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,791
[ERZA] What's
wrong with you?

511
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:22,625
[DAN] Stay right there for now.
Until we meet again, Titania!

512
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,041
[chuckle]

513
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,208
[ERZA] Hey! Wait a minute!

514
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,791
[crash]

515
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:28,541
What was that?

516
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,625
I hope Erza's okay.

517
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:31,666
Me too.

518
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,291
[MICHELLE] Come on,
we need to hurry!

519
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,166
[LUCY] When did
you get there?

520
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,541
Just in time, I'd say.
Your moves are quite

521
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,125
easy to calculate.
I simply needed to factor how

522
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,833
someone in your panicked
states would maneuver

523
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:45,958
through this floor plan.

524
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,708
Time for me
to shut you up!

525
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:50,708
[GRAY] Natsu!

526
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,708
[WENDY] No!

527
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:52,541
[GRAY] That's it!

528
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:53,875
How dare you
hurt our friend!

529
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,791
Precisely as arranged.

530
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,791
[NATSU high-pitched groan]

531
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,333
Where are you Natsu?
Are you okay?

532
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,375
I'm right here!

533
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,958
[high-pitched scream]

534
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,625
Happy! Did you see
where Natsu went?

535
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:15,166
Yeah, I kinda just
accidentally stepped on him.

536
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,458
[LUCY]
He's so tiny!

537
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,541
[SAMUEL] By now, even you
should have figured out

538
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,000
that escape is impossible.

539
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,833
[LUCY] What the heck
have you done to Natsu?

540
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,791
[DAN] Those gorgeous lips
are asking the wrong person.

541
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:28,583
My weapon is Habaki. A spear
that can change your size.

542
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,750
[SAMUEL] So kindly hand over
the book and we can be done

543
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,750
with this unpleasantness.

544
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,791
Mary has such a
heavy-handed approach

545
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,583
to these kinds of situations.

546
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,666
I much prefer a more
intellectual solution.

547
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,833
Screw you pal!

548
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,333
Happy! Grab the book
and get outta here!

Go! Go!

553
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:50,916
How simple-minded.

Aw, man!

00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,250
[HAPPY] He didn't
fall for it!

How did he know?

559
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,875
I've considered
every possible outcome.

560
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,041
And I have made plans
for each one of them.

561
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,500
Which means
I will forever be

a countless number
of steps ahead of you.

You can have the
book back now.

I've memorized
every single page.

[LUCY] Wait!

Bye-bye Lulu!

Next time we get together, let's
have it be just you and me!

[SAMUEL] Tell me, have you
been putting on weight again?

570
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:24,833
[WENDY] At least
he left the book.

571
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:26,916
[CARLA] After making
absolute fools of us.

[GRAY] I can't stand

[ERZA] They will not be
getting away with this.

[NATSU] This sucks.
I hate being this small!

means you're gonna be
