Wow. Look at that.

This means that our future

You okay, Lucy?

What's gotten into you?

Would you care to explain?

00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:56,208
[CARLA] It's set in stone
that the gate will close.

We don't have much time left!

You have to close it!

28
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,500
I can't do that! This is
the only weapon we have

that's capable of combating

32
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,583
You won't be able to
fire it anyway!

33
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,333
That thing's not a weapon!

34
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,500
It's just a gate that
connects points in time!

35
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,500
It contains a massive
amount of magic power,

00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,041
the cannon releases
it all in one blast!

[LUCY] Don't be ridiculous!

I'm telling you,
it isn't a weapon!

That's enough out
of you, young lady!

Don't forget you're speaking

[LUCY] I can't take any credit!

107
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,166
It's all thanks to Grandpa Crux!

his final analysis!

110
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,541
[LUCY] Apparently it was
created by combining

111
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:09,333
magic from the Book of Zeref
with Celestial Spirit magic!

112
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,500
Normally, it'll let you
travel to any time period

113
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,000
you choose but
that's not the case today!

114
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,916
[LUCY] You see
the full moon above us?

115
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,041
That's what's causing
the magic to go crazy!

116
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,125
Because of the moon?

117
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,375
[LUCY] It sounds
ridiculous but it's true!

118
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:25,958
It's making the gate
go out of control

119
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,125
and now it's locked
on one time period!

to be the era when

[roars]

326
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,708
[FUTURE ROGUE] Yes, That's it!
Good work, my minions!

327
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,875
Rampage and tear the city apart!

328
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:16,041
Show them the unadulterated
rage of dragons!

329
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:38,083
It's you, Natsu Dragneel.

330
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,250
[HAPPY] There are seven
insanely strong dragons

331
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,250
on the loose and
they're terrorizing the city!

332
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:17,791
[NATSU] Don't tell me
you're scared, 'lil buddy?

333
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,208
[HAPPY] No, of course I'm not!

334
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,083
[NATSU] This worked out great!
There are seven dragons

335
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,791
and seven of us Dragon Slayers!

336
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,166
Don't you worry, we got this!

337
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,125
[HAPPY] But there are
only six Dragon Slayers,

338
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:27,625
so that means
you're outnumbered!

339
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:29,458
Geez, you can't even
count, ya big dummy!

340
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:30,916
[NATSU]
Hey, don't make fun of me!

341
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,416
There's a seventh
Dragon Slayer! You'll see!

342
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,833
[NATSU and HAPPY]
Next time: Seven Dragons!

343
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:37,916
[NATSU] You're never gonna
guess who's the seventh one!

344
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,208
[HAPPY] Aah! Wait a minute!
Is it who I think it is?
