1
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,625
- Evergreen: I'M GLAD YOU
SHOWED UP WHEN YOU DID, NATSU.

2
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:34,333
- Elfman: ME TOO. BUT CAN YOU
GIVE US A HEADS UP NEXT TIME?

3
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,916
- NATSU.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,875
- ( trembling )

5
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:46,958
- ( theme music playing )

6
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,041
- ( singing in Japanese )

7
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,375
- Happy:
NATSU?

8
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,000
DID YOU NEED TO USE THE BUSHES
TO MAKE A STINKY,

9
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,375
 OR ARE WE NOT GOING TO THE TOP?

10
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,916
- THERE'S DEFINITELY
A STINK HERE.

11
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,083
BUT I'M NOT THE ONE THAT YOU
SHOULD BE BLAMING FOR IT.

12
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,083
- ( gasps )

13
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,083
- Happy:
WHOA!

14
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,416
HOW DID ALL THE TREES DIE?

15
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,833
- Evergreen:
NOT JUST THE TREES,

16
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,000
EVERYTHING'S WITHERED.

17
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:31,958
- Elfman:
EXCEPT US.

18
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,791
- ( Happy speaking )

19
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,750
- Happy:
THIS GUY DID ALL THAT DAMAGE?

20
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,416
- Evergreen:
HE'S NO ORDINARY WIZARD.

21
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,833
- Elfman:
WHAT'S WITH THE SISSY TEARS?

22
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,750
- LOOK PAL, THIS ISLAND IS
OFF-LIMITS

23
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,750
TO ANYONE WHO'S NOT
IN THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD.

24
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,666
KEEP YOUR FREAKY DEATH CLOUD
OUT OF OUR TRIAL.

25
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:01,708
- YOU'VE GROWN SO MUCH.

26
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,875
- HUH?

27
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,208
- Zeref:
I'VE MISSED YOU,

28
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:07,875
NATSU.

29
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:15,000
- TELL ME WHO YOU ARE,
OR I'LL HIT HARDER.

30
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,916
- CHEAP SHOT.
- YEAH, HE COLD-COCKED HIM.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,375
- THAT'S HOW HE DOES THINGS.

32
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:21,291
- Zeref: I SEE.

33
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:25,250
NOTHING'S CHANGED, HAS IT?

34
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,166
NOT AT ALL.

35
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,958
YOU STILL CAN'T BREAK ME.

36
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,125
- Natsu: YOU'D BETTER
TELL ME WHO YOU ARE, BUB.

37
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,583
I WON'T ASK AGAIN.

38
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:44,041
- WHEN WILL
THIS MINDLESS DESTRUCTION END?

39
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,166
I DON'T WANT TO KILL ANYMORE.

40
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,375
AND THE ONE PERSON WHO CAN STOP
ME, STILL ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH.

41
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:54,375
HOW LONG MUST I WAIT?

42
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:57,958
- ( crying )

43
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,458
- UH, WHY'S HE CRYING?

44
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,750
- HIS CREEP FACTOR'S SKY-HIGH.

45
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,833
- RUN!  NOW!

46
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:20,875
- ( gasps )

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,458
- WHAT THE HECK?!

48
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,041
- THAT'S THE SAME BLACK WAVE
WE SAW EARLIER!

49
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,708
- IT INSTANTLY DRAINS
THE LIFE FORCE

50
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,833
OF EVERYTHING IT TOUCHES!
- Happy: NATSU!

51
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,166
- GET OUT OF HERE, RIGHT NOW!

52
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,166
- ( screaming )

53
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,666
- NO!

54
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,333
- DON'T BE STUPID.

55
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,125
YOU GO BACK THERE AND YOU'LL
GET YOURSELF KILLED.

56
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,041
- ( groans )

57
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,083
- WELL, THAT SUCKED.

58
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,791
- ( coughing )

59
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,083
- YOU'RE ALIVE!
- WHAT ABOUT HIM?

60
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,833
IT LOOKED LIKE
HE LOST CONTROL.

61
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:13,041
- Evergreen:
HE'S GONE.

62
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,708
- YOU SOUND DISAPPOINTED.

63
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,250
- NATSU, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR SCARF?

64
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,208
IT TURNED BLACK!

65
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:27,875
- HE'LL PAY FOR THIS.

66
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,375
NEXT TIME I SEE THAT PUNK,
HE'S GETTING A FIERY FIST

67
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,833
TO THE FACE!

68
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,625
- Happy:
IGNEEL GAVE NATSU THAT SCARF.

69
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,500
MAYBE IT CHANGED COLORS
'CAUSE IT ABSORBED

70
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,375
THE MAGIC FROM THE BLAST.

71
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,041
- HOW MUCH LONGER?

72
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:58,708
WHEN WILL THIS WORLD
STOP REJECTING ME?

73
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,500
- Mest: ( thinking )
THIS MAGIC POWER,

74
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,541
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT--

75
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,041
IT'S HIM!

76
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,000
HE MUST BE SOMEWHERE
ON THE ISLAND.

77
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:37,166
- Narrator:
IN THE SKIES ABOVE,

78
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,291
ANOTHER DARK
AND MYSTERIOUS THREAT

79
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,333
IS MAKING ITS WAY
TO TENROU ISLAND--

80
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:46,125
THE DARK GUILD GRIMOIRE HEART.

81
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,583
A MEMBER OF THE SINISTER

82
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:51,250
AND OVERWHELMINGLY POWERFUL
BARAM ALLIANCE.

83
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,916
AMONG ITS RANKS IS AN
AMBITIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL WIZARD,

84
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,333
WHO WAS ONCE JELLAL'S CONFIDANT.

85
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:01,625
SHE IS THE MANIPULATIVE
AND RUTHLESS ULTEAR MILKOVICH.

86
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:05,458
- WE'VE FINALLY FOUND
OUR QUARRY,

87
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,583
AND HE APPEARS TO BE
IN A STATE OF REST.

88
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:12,041
I BELIEVE THE TIME IS UPON US,
MASTER HADES.

89
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,791
- Hades: I SHALL FINALLY MEET
THE MAN WHO SHOWED THE WORLD

90
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,583
THE TRUE POTENTIAL
OF THE BLACK ARTS.

91
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,958
HIS HORDE OF DEMONS CREATED
CHAOS AND DEATH TOLLS

92
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,291
WITHOUT EQUAL.

93
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,958
CATASTROPHE IS HIS DAILY BREAD.

94
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:30,375
IN ALL THE HISTORY
OF THE MAGIC WORLD,

95
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:33,000
HE IS THE TRUE CHAMPION
OF WICKEDNESS.

96
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:36,916
THE BLACK WIZARD, ZEREF.

97
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,666
- Hades:
THE DAY IS UPON US.

98
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,416
THE ABYSS OF SORCERY IS
WITHIN OUR GRASP.

99
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,333
IT'S TIME TO GET TO WORK.

100
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:52,666
TENROU ISLAND WILL RUN RED
WITH THE BLOOD OF FAIRY TAIL.

101
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:54,500
- WHERE DID HE GO?

102
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:57,041
HE HAS NO IDEA HOW BAD
HE'S GOING TO GET POUNDED

103
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,708
WHEN I GET MY HANDS ON HIM.
- SORRY.

104
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,000
- I MEAN, HOW DOES HE EXPECT
ME TO GO OUT IN PUBLIC

105
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,208
WEARING A BLACK SCARF
WITH A BLACK VEST?!

106
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,666
- Elfman: WOW, I NEVER THOUGHT
NATSU WAS THAT CONCERNED

107
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,500
ABOUT FASHION.

108
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,750
- Evergreen:
ME NEITHER.

109
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,208
- SO, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
ABOUT THE TRIAL?

110
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:15,166
- HM, WITH MR. DOOM AND GLOOM
RUNNING AMUCK IN THE WOODS,

111
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,958
I THINK IT SHOULD BE
PUT ON THE BACK BURNER.

112
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,541
- Happy:
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

113
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,125
- THERE AIN'T NO WAY
I'M DITCHING THE TRIAL!

114
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,125
- A REAL MAN WOULD CONQUER
BOTH AT THE SAME TIME.

115
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,291
- ( scowl )

116
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,625
- IF I QUIT, I'D BE BREAKING

117
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,250
MY PROMISE TO GILDARTS.

118
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,166
- AS MIRAJANE'S BROTHER
IT'S MY DUTY TO WIN.

119
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,958
I'LL BEAT DOWN ANYONE
WHO GETS IN MY WAY!

120
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:33,833
- WE CAN'T JUST IGNORE
THAT CREEPY, TREE-KILLING GUY.

121
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,500
- Happy:
HE WAS CRYING WHILE HE ATTACKED,

122
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:38,375
LIKE HE DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT.

123
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:41,208
YOU NEED TO QUIT MAKING FRIENDS
WITH PSYCHOS, NATSU.

124
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,708
- THAT FREAK AIN'T
NO FRIEND OF MINE!

125
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,541
- Happy:
STILL, IF YOU ASK ME,

126
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,583
HE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE HOSTILE.
- HE COULD'VE FOOLED ME.

127
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,333
- ENOUGH!  WE'VE GOT
A TRIAL TO CONQUER!

128
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,791
- AYE, SIR!

129
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,958
- HE'S RIGHT,
LET'S GO, EVERGREEN.

130
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,333
- WHEN I NEED A SHIRTLESS BOZO
TO BOSS ME AROUND,

131
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,291
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

132
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,833
- Mest:
HE REALLY IS ON THIS ISLAND,

133
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:07,541
SHOULD I RETURN AND REPORT NOW?
NO...

134
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,750
I'LL WAIT UNTIL I HAVE
A LITTLE MORE

135
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,916
DEFINITIVE INFORMATION FIRST.

136
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,500
- Hades:
THIS IS A MOMENTOUS DAY, INDEED.

137
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,458
IF ALL GOES AS PLANNED,
WE WILL SEE THE RETURN

138
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,375
OF ZEREF THE BLACK WIZARD.

139
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,666
THE AMBITIONS OF GRIMOIRE HEART
WILL NO LONGER BE A FANTASY.

140
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,458
NOW THAT WE'VE GATHERED
ALL THE NECESSARY KEYS,

141
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,833
WE WILL AWAKEN THAT WHICH SLEEPS
WITHIN ZEREF.

142
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,708
- MASTER, YOU'RE OVERLOOKING
THE OPPOSITION.

143
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:39,125
OUR PLANS COULD STILL COME
CRASHING DOWN AROUND US

144
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,250
SHOULD FAIRY TAIL DECIDE

145
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,875
TO INTERVENE.

146
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,750
THEY DEFEATED ONE OF THE BARAM
ALLIANCE'S MOST POWERFUL GUILDS,

147
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,375
THE ORACION SEIS.

148
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:50,791
THE STRONGEST AMONG THEM

149
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,791
ARE CURRENTLY GATHERED
ON TENROU ISLAND.

150
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,250
AWAKENING ZEREF WON'T BE
A SIMPLE TASK.

151
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,958
- Zancrow:
ENOUGH WITH ALL THE WIMPY TALK!

152
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,333
THAT SAD BUNCH OF WEAKLINGS

153
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,666
SHOULDN'T BE CALLED A GUILD.

154
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,625
I'VE GOT MORE POWER
IN THIS FINGER.

155
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:03,833
- ( laughing )

156
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,041
WHEN I'M DONE WITH THEM,

157
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,166
THEY'LL BE ASH
BENEATH MY BOOTS.

158
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,375
- ( laughing )

159
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,500
- Ultear: BEWARE OF
OVERCONFIDENCE, ZANCROW.

160
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:16,208
- NEVER UNDERESTIMATE
ONE'S OPPONENT.

161
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:20,583
EVEN SO, I HAVE FAITH
WE WILL WIN THIS BATTLE.

162
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:23,041
- I COULDN'T AGREE MORE,
CAPRICO.

163
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,625
- I, UH, WELL... YEAH.

164
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,541
- AT LAST, WE WILL UNLEASH
OUR ULTIMATE DESIRES.

165
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,583
- OH-HH!

166
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,875
- OUR WAR DRUMS BEAT
AGAINST THEIR CAGES

167
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,458
AND CRY FOR VIOLENCE.

168
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,833
WE SHALL DANCE THE WALTZ
OF DEATH TO THEIR RHYTHM.

169
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,041
- OH...

170
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,250
I FEEL THE SAME WAY!

171
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,166
- NO ONE UNDERSTANDS YOU, TUBBY.

172
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,291
- KAIN HIKARU'S STATEMENT
IS DECIPHERED AS FOLLOWS--

173
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,083
"I FEEL THE SAME WAY,"
IS THAT CORRECT?

174
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,666
- YEP, THAT'S IT!

175
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,333
- RUSTYROSE'S PREVIOUS
STATEMENTS DECIPHERED--

176
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,333
"DESIRE" MEANS "WANTS."

177
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,958
"WAR DRUMS" REFERS TO HEARTS.

178
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,458
- MELDY, WILL YOU
BE JOINING US?

179
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,541
- IN BATTLE?

180
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,000
YES.

181
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:03,375
- I AM DELIGHTED.

182
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,666
NO ONE WILL BE ABLE
TO WITHSTAND OUR MIGHT.

183
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,083
NOT EVEN FAIRY TAIL.

184
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,583
THEIR STRONGEST WIZARDS WILL
SOON KNOW THE POWER

185
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,125
OF TRUE DARKNESS.

186
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:16,375
THE EMINENCE THAT LURKS
WITHIN THE ABYSS.

187
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:19,166
FOR WE ARE GRIMOIRE HEART.

188
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,958
WE'VE WALKED THE PATH
OF DEVILS

189
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,208
AND WILL FORCE THIS WORLD
INTO THE DARKNESS.

190
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:26,708
TONIGHT, THESE DEVILS
WILL BATHE TENROU ISLAND

191
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,958
IN THE BLOOD OF FAIRIES.

192
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:32,333
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE AGONY
ON MAHKAROV'S FACE.

193
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:36,958
OUR SHOWDOWN AGAINST THE
FAIRY TAIL GUILD STARTS NOW!

194
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,666
- Lucy: IF I WERE THE
GUILD'S FOUNDING MASTER,

195
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,041
WHERE WOULD I BE BURIED?

196
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,291
- ANYTHING COMING TO YOU?

197
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,708
- NOT AT ALL.  I MEAN, HOW ARE
WE SUPPOSED TO FIND THIS THING

198
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,666
WITHOUT ANY CLUES?  MY BRAIN IS
GOING ON STRIKE HERE.

199
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,791
- I'M NOT CONVINCED WE HAVEN'T
BEEN GIVEN CLUES.

200
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,291
THE OLD MAN MAY BE A SADIST
WITH HIS TESTS.

201
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,625
BUT IN THE FOUR TIMES I'VE BEEN
THROUGH THIS TRIAL,

202
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,500
THERE'S NEVER BEEN A TASK
THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE, YOU GET ME?

203
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,458
I HAVE A FEELING HE MAY HAVE
SUBTLY GIVEN US ALL THE CLUES

204
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,083
WE NEED TO FIND THIS THING.

205
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:17,625
THEN AGAIN, I COULD BE
GIVING HIM WAY TOO MUCH CREDIT.

206
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,750
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- IT DOES MAKE SENSE.

207
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,625
FIRST ROUND TESTED STRENGTH,
THIS ONE MUST TEST INTELLECT.

208
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,708
SO...

209
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,583
...MAYBE IT'S A RIDDLE.

210
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,750
- Lucy: WHAT IF MASTER
TOLD US HOW TO FIND IT

211
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,291
WHEN HE WAS EXPLAINING THE RULES
OF THE SECOND ROUND?

212
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,458
- I DON'T FOLLOW YOU.

213
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,583
- UM, YOU KNOW, LIKE--

214
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,166
LIKE THE WORD "GRAVE."

215
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,541
WE ASSUME THAT IT REFERS
TO A PHYSICAL HOLE IN THE GROUND

216
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,875
OR HEADSTONE, BUT IT CAN
ALSO BE USED AS IMAGERY

217
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,250
TO SUGGEST THE END
OF SOMEONE'S LIFE.

218
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,708
- YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

219
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,583
- "GRAVE"...

220
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,041
THINK, LUCY.

221
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,375
IS IT A KEY WORD?
A PART OF A PHRASE?

222
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,166
- THINK YOU COULD SPEED UP
THE BRAINSTORMING A BIT?

223
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,083
THIS PLACE IS MAKING
ME PARANOID.

224
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,875
- REMEMBER HOW HE SAID HE'D
BE WAITING FOR US AT THE GRAVE?

225
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,250
WHAT IF HE'S GOING TO DIE
AND WANTS US TO FIND HIS BODY?

226
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,916
- THAT MAKES NO SENSE.

227
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,333
YOU'RE OVERANALYZING.

228
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,541
JUST SAY IT LIKE ONE
OF YOUR LUCY-ISMS.

229
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,625
"WHEN YOU DIE, YOU BECOME
A SHOOTING STAR!"

230
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,208
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

231
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,958
- UH, DO I REALLY COME OFF
AS THE TYPE OF PERSON

232
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,166
WHO WOULD SAY SOMETHING
SO DITZY AND CORNY?

233
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,791
I HOPE THE WHOLE GUILD
DOESN'T THINK I'M THAT WAY.

234
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:20,791
- ( gasps )

235
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,083
IT'S SO SIMPLE!

236
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,375
DITZY OR NOT,

237
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,875
THIS BLONDE BOMBSHELL
JUST FIGURED OUT

238
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,875
WHERE THE GRAVE IS HIDDEN!
- FOR REAL?

239
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,000
- Lucy:
FOLLOW ME!

240
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,375
- Cana:
YOU GO, GIRL!

241
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,833
- I TOLD YOU SHE'D GET IT.

242
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,416
- IT'S GOOD LUCK
WE RAN INTO THEM.

243
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,833
- Lucy:
LET'S HURRY.

244
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,750
IF I FIGURED IT OUT,
I GUARANTEE YOU LEVY

245
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,375
IS ALREADY ON HER WAY THERE.

246
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,916
- NOW WE JUST FOLLOW THEM
AND CLEAR THE ROUND.

247
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,625
- Gray:
HATE TO DO THIS TO YOU, LUCY.

248
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,000
BUT THIS WHOLE TRIAL
IS ABOUT USING WHAT YOU GOT,

249
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,166
AND I WOULDN'T BE SHOWING OFF
MY S-CLASS POTENTIAL

250
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,333
IF I DIDN'T USE YOU.

251
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,541
- HAH, SOUNDS LIKE
A RELATIONSHIP TO ME.

252
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,875
- Gray: ENOUGH PHILOSOPHY,
THEY'RE GETTING AWAY.

253
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:57,958
- Loke:
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

254
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,250
- Erza:
I FORGOT HOW BIG THIS ISLAND IS.

255
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,375
IT MAY TAKE US ALL DAY,
BUT I'M SURE WE'LL FIND

256
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,583
WENDY AND MEST EVENTUALLY.

257
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,500
- WHY DIDN'T I JUST WAIT
UNTIL I HAD A CHANCE

258
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:08,083
TO SLIP AWAY QUIETLY?
I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

259
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,958
TO ESCAPE HER AND FIND
MY DARLING, GRAY!

260
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,833
AND THEN--

261
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,291
UNISON RAID!

262
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,333
- Gray:
HOW WAS I SO BLIND?

263
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,708
I COULDN'T POSSIBLY PARTNER
WITH ANYONE ELSE.

264
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,708
JUVIA, PLEASE SAY THAT YOU
WILL BE WITH ME FOREVER.

265
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,500
- Juvia:
OF COURSE, GRAY, MY LOVE.

266
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,708
NOW HOW MANY BABIES
WOULD YOU LIKE?

267
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,375
- ARE YOU FEELING
ALRIGHT, JUVIA?  YOU'RE FLUSHED.

268
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,208
- I'M FINE.
I'M PERFECTLY HEALTHY.

269
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,583
- LET'S MOVE ON.

270
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,625
- WE'RE GOING TO MAKE
SO MANY BABIES!

271
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,916
YOU KNOW, IF WE SPLIT UP
WE COULD COVER MORE GROUND.

272
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,375
- YOU SHOULD STICK CLOSER TO ME,

273
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,750
THE LAST THING WE NEED
IS TO GET SEPARATED.

274
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,541
LISTEN, JUVIA.

275
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,791
YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF ME,
ARE YOU?

276
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,916
PLEASE ACCEPT
MY HUMBLEST APOLOGY FOR EARLIER.

277
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,333
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

278
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,291
OH, SHE MUST MEAN WHEN WE FOUGHT

279
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,375
DURING THE FIRST ROUND.

280
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,791
- I'LL ADMIT, I COULD HAVE
EXERCISED MORE RESTRAINT

281
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,000
IN OUR BATTLE.

282
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,041
BUT IT'S MY DUTY TO MAKE
SURE YOU UNDERSTAND

283
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,958
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE S-CLASS.

284
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,416
IT'S A DIFFICULT PATH--

285
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,916
HARD AND GRUELING WITH DANGERS
BEYOND COMPARE.

286
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,333
I BARELY SURVIVED THE TRIAL
WHEN I WAS CHOSEN.

287
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:14,000
ALL MY YEARS OF TRAINING
WERE PUT TO THE ULTIMATE TEST.

288
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,666
PEOPLE JUST DON'T SEEM
TO UNDERSTAND

289
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,250
THAT THE CHALLENGE
OF BEING S-CLASS

290
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,250
DOESN'T STOP
WHEN YOU ACHIEVE THE RANK.

291
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,583
FOR STARTERS, EVERYONE
IN THE GUILD

292
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,041
SUDDENLY WANTS TO FIGHT YOU.

293
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,625
AND THE PUBLIC EYE IS
ALWAYS WATCHING,

294
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:24,791
SO YOU HAVE TO BE
ON YOUR BEST BEHAVIOR

295
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,541
AT ALL TIMES.

296
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,833
- IF I DON'T SHUT HER UP,
I'LL NEVER FIND GRAY.

297
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,458
PLEASE, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO APOLOGIZE.

298
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,125
I MEAN, YOU WERE ONLY DOING
YOUR JOB.

299
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,125
AND THE TRIAL REALLY ISN'T
ALL THAT IMPORTANT.

300
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,583
- NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

301
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,708
I MAY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE ROUGH
ON LISANNA, TOO.

302
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,041
AND SHE JUST RETURNED.

303
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,708
ONE MIGHT SAY
I ACTED IMMATURELY.

304
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,041
HOWEVER,

305
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,666
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND,

306
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,791
IT WASN'T OUT OF SPITE.

307
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,708
I SWEAR, THERE WAS NO ILL WILL.

308
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,416
SORRY, I WANTED
TO CLEAR THE AIR.

309
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,958
- IT'S NOT A PROBLEM, REALLY.

310
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,458
LISANNA AND I BOTH REALIZED

311
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,250
WHAT THE RISKS WERE
GOING INTO THE TRIAL.

312
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,583
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY WE SPLIT UP
TO MAKE THE SEARCH--

313
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:57,916
- THANK YOU, JUVIA!

314
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,333
I'M SO GLAD YOU UNDERSTAND.

315
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,916
CAMARADERIE TRULY IS
A WONDERFUL THING.

316
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,625
I HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE
TO WORK TOGETHER.

317
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,125
NOW WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO
FIND MEST AND WENDY?

318
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,291
- ( crying )

319
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:11,750
- I'M THE MOON AND GRAY
IS THE SUN-- ALWAYS SO DISTANT!

320
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:15,208
- Lisanna: OKAY, I THINK
IT'S READY FOR A TASTE TEST.

321
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,375
- Mirajane:
DON'T MIND IF I DO!

322
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,250
- IT'S DELICIOUS!

323
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,291
- REALLY?  YOU THINK SO?

324
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,916
- I'M PROUD OF YOU, LISANNA.

325
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,666
GUESS YOUR TIME IN EDOLAS
WAS WELL SPENT.

326
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,541
- I LEARNED A FEW THINGS
FROM THE OTHER MIRA.

327
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:27,791
SHE WAS A GOOD COOK, TOO.

328
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,958
- IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE

329
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,250
IT'S NOT A DREAM.

330
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,458
HAVING YOU COME BACK
INTO OUR LIVES

331
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,041
HAS BEEN A MIRACLE.

332
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,250
SOMETIMES I'M AFRAID
I'M GOING TO BLINK,

333
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,291
AND YOU'LL BE GONE AGAIN.

334
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,458
- I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

335
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,958
- BY THE WAY, IT'S A BIT
ON THE SALTY SIDE.

336
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,916
AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO WORK
ON CUTTING YOUR VEGETABLES

337
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,166
A LITTLE SMALLER.

338
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,833
- YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO
CRITICIZE ME RIGHT NOW?

339
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,833
- THINK YOU CAN SCARE ME?!

340
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:56,750
YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER THING COMING!

341
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,166
- Gajeel: I DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE POINT OF THIS STUPID TRIAL.

342
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,916
HOW DOES PICKING A ROUTE
OR FINDING A GRAVE

343
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
PROVE YOUR STRENGTH TO ANYONE?

344
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,583
- UGH!  WOULD YOU SHUT UP?

345
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,875
- I ONLY CAME TO THIS ISLAND
SO I COULD HAVE A CHANCE

346
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,875
TO BEAT UP ERZA OR SALAMANDER.

347
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,291
WALKING THROUGH CAVES
AND FIGHTING OVERSIZED LIZARDS

348
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,333
IS NOT MY IDEA
OF TIME WELL SPENT.

349
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,375
- OH! SO IT WASN'T TO HELP
ME GET S-CLASS? - HUH?

350
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,750
WHY ARE YOU GETTING ALL BENT
OUT OF SHAPE, SHORT STUFF?

351
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,583
- YOU JUST SAID
THE ONLY REASON YOU'RE HERE

352
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:20,958
IS SO YOU CAN BEAT UP
OUR FRIENDS.

353
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,166
YOU DON'T SEEM TO CARE
ABOUT ME AT ALL!

354
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,208
I'M RIGHT, AREN'T I?

355
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,625
- AWE, IS SOMEONE
FEELING LEFT OUT?

356
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,625
SO YOU WANT TO GET MY ATTENTION.
IS THAT IT, HALF-PINT?

357
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,833
IN THAT CASE, ALL YOU'VE GOT
TO DO IS GET STRONG ENOUGH

358
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,416
TO ACTUALLY BE A CHALLENGE
FOR ME.

359
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,958
- WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS I'LL
NEVER BE UP TO THE TASK.

360
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,500
'CAUSE I'M TOO WEAK.

361
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,416
- NOT THAT THIS AIN'T FUN,
BUT YOU'VE GOT

362
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,250
MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO
THAN GET ALL--

363
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,000
- FINE!  WHO NEEDS YOU,
YOU IRON-HEARTED JERK!

364
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,583
- WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

365
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,166
- WHAT'S WITH HIM?

366
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,750
I WAS STARTING TO THINK
HE'S A NICE GUY,

367
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:57,750
UNTIL THIS!

368
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:05,750
BUT HE'S NOT!

369
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,250
HE'S JUST ARROGANT

370
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,666
AND SELFISH!

371
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,375
- ( crying )

372
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,416
I HATE HIM.

373
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:27,875
LEAVE ME ALONE.

374
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,083
- ( screams )

375
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,458
- I DON'T THINK
THESE ARE ISLAND CRITTERS!

376
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,750
- ( squawking )

377
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,083
- ( screaming )

378
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,083
- FIRST CATCH OF THE DAY.

379
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,166
- Gajeel:
IT'S TOUGH TO KEEP TRACK OF YOU

380
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,708
IF YOU RUN OFF ON YOUR OWN, KID.

381
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,791
SERIOUSLY, DON'T LEAVE
MY SIDE AGAIN.

382
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,166
SO, WHO ARE YOUR NEW PALS?

383
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,416
- THEY AREN'T ANY FRIENDS
OF MINE.

384
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,583
GRIMOIRE HEART?

385
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:31,166
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY ANYONE
FROM A DARK GUILD WOULD BE HERE.

386
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,416
- THE OLD MAN'S MORE CREATIVE
THAN I THOUGHT

387
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,333
IF HE MADE THESE GUYS
PART OF THE TRIAL.

388
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,291
- MASTER WOULDN'T DO THAT.

389
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,833
MY GUESS IS THAT THEY SNUCK ONTO
THE ISLAND TO CAUSE TROUBLE.

390
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:43,625
- WHATEVER, I DON'T CARE AS LONG
AS I GET TO BEAT SOMEONE UP.

391
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:44,916
IF THERE'S ONE THING
I'M GOOD AT,

392
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,416
IT'S CLEANING UP MESSES
LIKE THIS.

393
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,041
DEALING WITH THE UNEXPECTED

394
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,166
IS AN EVEN MORE IMPORTANT SKILL
THAN FIGHTING.

395
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,791
IF YOU CAN'T ADAPT, YOU DON'T
DESERVE TO GET TO S-CLASS.

396
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,458
- BUT THEY'RE IN THE MOST
POWERFUL DARK GUILD THERE IS!

397
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,375
IT'S THE HEAD
OF THE EVIL BARAM ALLIANCE.

398
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:58,791
WE'RE NOT EVEN ALLOWED
TO FIGHT THEM

399
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,625
WITHOUT APPROVAL
FROM THE COUNCIL.

400
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,458
- ( laughing )

401
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,916
- THAT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH BEING IN AN OFFICIAL GUILD.

402
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,208
WHAT'S THE POINT OF JOINING

403
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,833
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE
RESTRICTED BY RULES?

404
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:12,000
- THAT'S NO WAY TO FIGHT A WAR,
IF YOU ASK ME.

405
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,833
- ( clucks )

406
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,791
- ARE YOU TWO DONE TALKING YET?

407
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,125
- Levy:
WHO ARE YOU GUYS?

408
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,583
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
ON TENROU ISLAND?

409
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,541
- WE'RE A COUPLE
OF PASSIONATE HUNTERS

410
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,000
LOOKING FOR THE ULTIMATE PREY.

411
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,666
I'M YOMAZU.

412
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,500
- AND I'M HIS PARTNER,
KAWAZU.

413
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:29,333
- Gajeel: WHAT'S THIS ULTIMATE
PREY YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?

414
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,000
- Yomazu:
I'M SO GLAD YOU ASKED.

415
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,208
- Levy:
HE'S KILLING MY EARS!

416
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:41,875
- Yomazu: OUR PREY IS
EVERY MEMBER OF FAIRY TAIL!

417
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:45,750
- Narrator: THE FIRST
BATTLE BETWEEN FAIRY TAIL

418
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,875
AND GRIMOIRE HEART
IS SET.

419
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,875
BUT THEIR DECLARATION OF WAR
IS ONLY A FOOTNOTE

420
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:54,250
IN THEIR PLANS TO FIND
THE BLACK WIZARD, ZEREF.

421
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,625
WHAT IS
THEIR ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE?

422
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,666
AND WILL NATSU BE ABLE
TO STOP THEM?

423
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,708
- ALRIGHT, NOW EVERYTHING
IS GOOD TO GO.

424
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,708
- AFTER ALL THAT, YOU JUST
TURNED YOUR VEST INSIDE OUT?

425
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:05,708
- FIND GRAVE!  BECOME S-CLASS!
BE A REAL MAN!

426
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,625
- UGH, SO MANY IDIOTIC MEN
IN OUR GUILD

427
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:10,500
AND I JUST HAD TO TEAM UP
WITH THE ABSOLUTE DUMBEST ONE!

428
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,458
- Narrator:
THE HOPES AND DREAMS

429
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:15,166
OF THE S-CLASS WIZARD
PROMOTION TRIAL PARTICIPANTS

430
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,666
ARE SOON TO BE DISRUPTED

431
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,333
BY THE MERCILESS TIDES
OF WAR.

432
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,458
WHO WILL EMERGE VICTORIOUS?

433
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,958
AND WHO WILL CALL TENROU ISLAND
THEIR GRAVE?

434
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:27,916
GOOD AND EVIL FACE OFF
IN A BATTLE

435
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,250
SURROUNDING THE LEGENDARY
BLACK WIZARD, ZEREF.

436
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:34,500
THE ULTIMATE SHOWDOWN
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.

437
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,458
- ( theme music playing )

438
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,375
- ( singing in Japanese )

439
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:14,750
- Natsu: PROTEIN! LET'S HAVE
MEAT FOR LUNCH TODAY.

440
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:15,833
IS THAT COOL WITH YOU?

441
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:17,416
- Happy:
WHAT? MEAT, AGAIN?

442
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,791
CAN'T WE SETTLE FOR A
LOVELY TROUT FILET INSTEAD?

443
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,875
- Natsu: FISH CAN'T
RE-ENERGIZE THIS BODY, BABY.

444
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:23,166
IT'S MEAT OR NOTHING.

445
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,041
- Happy:
JEEZ, YOU ARE SO HARDHEADED.

446
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:27,250
- Natsu: I COULD BUTT HEADS WITH
GAJEEL AND COME OUT ON TOP!

447
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,125
- Happy: YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T
REALLY MEAN THAT

448
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:30,750
AS A COMPLIMENT.

449
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:33,791
- ( Natsu and Happy speaking )

450
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:36,416
- Happy: WAIT, HOW COULD YOU
BEAT GAJEEL WITH YOUR HEAD?

451
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,750
HIS IS IRON
AND YOURS IS FLUFF.

452
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:38,541
- Natsu:
I'M NOT FLUFFY!

453
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:40,000
I HAVE A GREAT FIGURE!

454
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,833
- Happy: OKAY, THIS ROUTINE
IS JUST GETTING WEIRD.
