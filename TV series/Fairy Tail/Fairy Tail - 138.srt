00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,541
Hey anyone
want some mayo?

158
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,458
[surprised gasps]

159
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,166
Kay, Lackey A and Lackey B!

160
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,041
Let's teach these twerps
a lesson and smother 'em

161
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,541
with our jiggly jumblies!

162
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,500
[BOTH] We're ready
to rumble, Boss!

163
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,166
[BOSS] Your itty bitty
titty committee...

164
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,666
[LACKEY B] ...Can't handle
our boobiferous brawn!

165
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,291
[BOSS] Y'know, your
bazongas would be bigger

166
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,375
if you'd quit
dieting the fat away!

167
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,875
[LACKEYS] Yeah,
just look at us!

168
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,791
Our mantra is,
"You gonna eat that?"

169
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,125
[BOSS] We know a thing or two
about fun bags 'cause...

170
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:50,541
[ALL]
We're the Jugs Jiggle Gang!

171
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:51,916
No way! They've
got bigger boobs

172
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,208
than me and
they're men?!

173
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,958
[shocked gasps]

174
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,666
[BOSS] You can't just
barge into our territory;

175
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,291
there are rules, y'know!

176
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,708
[LACKEY A] Rule number one: is
skinny girls can't picnic here!

177
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,208
[LACKEY B] But I'd be happy
to share my mayo with you!

178
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,875
[CANA] Look out you guys, I
think Erza's about to explode...

179
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,708
[ERZA] I even put another
flower in my hair!

180
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,125
[BOSS] You broke the rules
so give up the food!

181
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,458
[LACKEY A] There's
too many veggies!

182
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,958
Where's the meat and cheese?!

183
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,291
[LACKEY B] Hey,
anyone want mayo?

184
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:19,041
[CARLA] Don't blame us for
what's about to happen.

185
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,791
How dare you do this
to me? I'm going to make

186
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:26,083
you pay for ruining our second
attempt at my first picnic!

187
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,083
Huh?

188
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,375
I said I'd share
my mayo with you!

189
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:32,416
Prepare yourselves!
Come forth...

190
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,250
Spectral Sword:
Crimson Blossom!

191
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,708
You three are
about to learn

192
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,416
a very important lesson.
Just because you're bigger

193
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,083
than someone doesn't mean
they can't destroy you!

194
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,791
[LACKEY B] No!
I'll give you my mayo!

195
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,166
[JUGS JIGGLE GANG
yell and groan]

196
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,333
Can't say I didn't
try to warn them...

197
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,541
[MIRAJANE] Elfman...? Lisanna?

198
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:01,375
[gasps]

199
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,041
[LISANNA cries out]

200
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:06,125
Let me go!
[gasping]

201
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,708
Lisanna!

202
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,208
[MARY laughs]

203
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,208
[MARY] That was fun...!
But I don't wanna play

204
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,708
with you guys anymore...
I'll like totally put you

205
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,916
out of your misery
before I go, though.

206
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,416
Tell me...
do you enjoy it?

207
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,916
Hurting others like this?

208
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
[smirks]

209
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,500
Honestly, I do
'cause it proves I'm not

210
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,666
the helpless loser I used to be.

211
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,208
[MIRAJANE]
Huh?

212
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,041
[MARY] Now that I'm powerful,
the only thing I gotta worry

213
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:34,416
about is wiping out anyone
who opposes the archbishop.

214
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,208
It's a shame you're
defying Zentopia

215
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:40,750
'cause it's like, a major sin...
and all sinners must die!

216
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:41,875
Just try it!

217
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,125
Whatcha gonna do? You're
helpless now that

218
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,666
my Sacred Baton has
control of your powers.

219
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:51,000
This is the end of the line!
Bye-bye Fairy Tail wizard!

220
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,666
[MARY] Who knew
she was so strong?

221
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,791
I think I might've
overdone it a little bit.

222
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:01,750
[gasps]

223
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:05,125
Uh-oh. We've got
trouble now.

224
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,000
Calm down, Mira!
Don't let it take over!

225
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,333
Stay in control!

226
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,041
No way, that's
impossible!

227
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,458
No one told me she has
another Satan Soul!

228
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,541
You'd think they would've,
like, warned me!

229
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,833
I don't understand,
what's happened to her?!

230
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,375
This is bad... We've
gotta get outta here

231
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:22,791
while we can.

232
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,416
[ELFMAN] That form is
different from a Satan Soul.

233
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,666
The reason you've never seen it
before is because our master

234
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,666
forbade her from using it.

235
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:34,250
It's known as...
the Demon God Halphas!

236
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,875
[NATSU screams]

237
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,291
Your tentacles
are so heavy!

238
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,791
[NATSU cries]

239
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,708
[NATSU] No! Don't shoot,
Octo-scum!

240
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,833
You're lucky I got
here when I did

241
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,791
or your loud-mouth friend
would be a goner!

242
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,333
I knew I could
count on you!

243
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,291
Hey, what in the heck
do you think you're doing?!

244
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,958
You summoned me from a puddle?!

245
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,916
Sorry! But that's
all I could find!

246
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,333
Thank you, Lucy and...
uh... Aquarium?

247
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,625
[AQUARIUS] It's Aquarius!

248
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,833
[HAPPY] Cool! It's
like Natsu fishing!

249
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,250
I'm willing to let
you off the hook for

250
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,375
the puddle thing if you'll
do me a little favor...

251
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,625
Would you please hurry up and
figure out how to summon two

252
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,250
Celestial Spirits at once?!
I might be nicer to you

253
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:26,916
if I had my man Scorpio's
around... Well...?!

254
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,458
Whoa... I thought
she was called here

255
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:31,291
to help Lucy, not
threaten to hurt her.

256
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,750
[NATSU] Hey Romeo...! ya think
ya can get his mouth open?

257
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:37,166
[ROMEO] Yeah, just leave
it to me! Purple Net!

258
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,916
[NATSU] Alright!

259
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,041
Fire Dragon...

260
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,458
It looks like he's
gonna blast fire

261
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,750
down the
octopus' mouth!

262
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,250
But isn't that
kinda cruel?!

263
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,333
Oh I bet it's
going to taste

264
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,458
delicious freshly-grilled!

265
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,250
Well, She doesn't
seem to think so.

266
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,583
How terribly naïve...
Kanaloa is a veteran warrior

267
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:58,958
just like me.

268
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,666
[BYRO] Such childish tactics
aren't going to work.

269
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,041
He's got Natsu!

270
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,958
We've gotta save him!

271
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,791
[LUCY] Oh no, he's getting sick!

272
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,458
[BYRO] It would appear
that victory is ours...

273
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:12,041
Let's go, Kanaloa.
We have what we need.

274
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,083
[LUCY] Hold it right there!

275
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,666
My father left that clock hand
to me which makes it mine!

276
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,083
It's the only thing I
have to remember him by!

277
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,875
You don't have any
right to take it!

278
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,750
What's so important
about these clock pieces

279
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,208
that you would go to such
lengths to steal them?

280
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,916
[BYRO] We are not
stealing them...

281
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,875
We are taking them
into our care.

282
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,583
[LUCY] What's that
supposed to mean?

283
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,833
We're gathering these
pieces because they belong

284
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,583
to the Infinity Clock.

285
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,875
The Archbishop of Zentopia
has demanded that

286
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:40,750
we retrieve them... We're
simply following his orders.

287
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,083
The Infinity Clock...?

288
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,916
What could the
Archbishop possibly want

289
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,375
with such a thing?

290
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,041
[ARCHBISHOP's voice]
"Time ticks forward...

291
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:52,333
on toward inevitable chaos."

292
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,916
[ARCHBISHOP] I don't
suppose you have any idea

293
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,583
what that means, Byro?

294
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,416
[BYRO] That's the phrase
you hear in your dreams,

295
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,916
is it not? Forgive
me my lord,

296
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,958
but I haven't
the slightest.

297
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,875
[ARCHBISHOP] Once every
one hundred years,

298
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,250
the Infinity Clock
releases the magic power

299
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,791
it has accumulated
and becomes active...

300
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,541
It is said that if all six
of the scattered clock pieces

301
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,750
are gathered together
when it is activated...

302
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,000
[BYRO] What will happen?

303
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,541
[ARCHBISHOP] Then the clock
will begin to tick...

304
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,125
and it will usher in
the end of the world.

305
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,750
[BYRO] That cannot be...

306
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,041
[ARCHBISHOP] According to the
cardinals, a wizard guild is

307
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:29,583
looking to gather the pieces
of the Infinity Clock.

308
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:32,000
We are the only ones
who can stop them.

309
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,583
In other words...

310
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,458
We now have a
purpose given to us

311
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,875
by a higher power.

312
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:42,625
Byro... Prepare
yourself for a holy war.

313
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,041
[LUCY] If all the clock pieces
are gathered together...

314
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,166
...then the world
will come to an end.

315
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,166
So that's the
"inevitable chaos".

316
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,041
Yeah...
Sounds like it.

317
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,750
Things just got way
more serious around here!

318
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,416
I cannot give
this back to you.

319
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,166
A meager wizard guild doesn't
have the power to protect

320
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,791
the world from destruction.

321
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,083
He's got a point.
If we make one mistake

322
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,791
it could spell disaster!

323
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,666
Then maybe... we
should just let him

324
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,458
take it after all.

325
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,958
No way!

326
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,666
That story sounds
like a bunch of baloney,

327
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,583
if you ask me!

328
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,791
[BYRO] What?

329
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,250
[NATSU] If gatherin'
the clock parts is gonna

330
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,708
make somethin' bad happen,
then I gotta wonder what you

331
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,208
and your buddies are up to!

332
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,583
Natsu's right, the answer
is to not gather them!

333
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,125
Besides, do we really want
Zentopia holding the fate

334
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,708
of the world in their hands?

335
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,000
Yeah, you don't know
what to do with 'em

336
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,333
any more than we do!
Who says that you guys

337
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,000
won't make a
dangerous mistake?!

338
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,208
Oh no! We're
all gonna die!

339
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,583
I can assure you our
teachings are not mistaken.

340
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,833
How dare you even
question the archbishop?!

341
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,125
He is infallible!

342
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,916
[MICHELLE] That's not true.
Nobody is perfect;

343
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,833
we all make mistakes.
That's why we can't find

344
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:50,166
world peace. I thought
everyone knew that.

345
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,416
[NATSU] I don't buy it!
You're tryin' to play the hero

346
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,833
but I can tell
you're up to somethin'!

347
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,500
You can't
fool me, man...

348
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,666
Someone's a jerk; either
you or that "Archbishop"

349
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,125
you keep talkin' about.

350
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,833
He might think he's calling
the shots right now but...

351
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,833
[BYRO] Such blasphemy!
Kanaloa!

352
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,416
Don't get sick!

353
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,125
Funny how fast he can go
from kick butt to butt face.

354
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
[WAKABA] What's the
matter, Kinana?!

355
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,250
[KINANA trembles]

356
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,916
Are you feeling
all right?

357
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,750
[KINANA] It's close...
So very close...

358
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:28,916
[KINANA] I sense it... The
end... is within our grasp...

359
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,875
I can hear it now...
I hear--!

360
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,375
There's no
need to panic.

361
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,208
It's just another
of her fits.

362
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,208
Hey Wakaba... Know
where Makarov is?

363
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,333
In the East Forest,
gettin' healed up.

364
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,208
Man, I hope he
gets back soon...

365
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,375
I could really use
his help about now.

366
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,166
Run faster, Lisanna!

367
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,958
[LISANNA] That's kinda hard to
do when you're carrying me!

368
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,958
This is no fair;
she's totally cheating!

369
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,666
I had no idea she was,
like, an actual demon!

370
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,208
How'm I supposed
to fight her?!

371
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,166
She's so sinful and wicked!

372
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,708
[MIRAJANE] To be
honest with you...

373
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,250
I like Zentopia's teachings...

374
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,083
Acknowledging and
baring the malevolence

375
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:18,500
within you... Devoting every
ounce of your love to others...

376
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:19,791
However...

377
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,250
I've lost all respect
for them now that I know

378
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,333
they embrace people
like you. Such a shame.

379
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:31,083
That's it! I've had
enough of you!

380
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,625
[MARY] I'm sorry, Archbishop!

381
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,625
I know that
I'm committing a sin.

382
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,708
Forgive me! I'm
doing it all for you!

383
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,541
[ELFMAN] What the
heck is happening?!

384
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,375
[LISANNA] Look!
Inside the blast!

385
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,333
[MARY, demonically] Merging
with someone you control...

386
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,916
Conducting Art,
Third Movement!

387
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,750
Using this forbidden
technique I will defeat you,

388
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,291
with your own power!

389
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,958
[demonic scream]

390
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,125
[MIRAJANE] So this...

391
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,041
...is what you
call a sin?!

392
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,750
[ELFMAN] They're moving so
fast I can barely see 'em!

393
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:14,208
[LISANNA] Wow...
Mira's... kinda... scary...

394
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,916
[MARY] Begone!

395
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:20,958
No way!

396
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,875
That attack didn't
even scratch her!

397
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,125
As far as I'm
concerned,

398
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,000
you've committed
a greater sin.

399
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,791
You've had your
fun. Now...

400
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,500
you'll pay for
taking my power,

401
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,375
and using it against me.

402
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,250
But most of all,
you'll pay for hurting

403
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,958
my brother and sister!

404
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,708
[MARY groans]

405
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,458
[MIRAJANE] You used my magic
to threaten my loved ones!

406
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,125
That's unforgiveable!

407
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,375
[MARY] Stay away...!

408
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,583
Here it comes!

409
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,916
Just thinkin' about it
makes me wanna pass out!

410
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,708
What's Mira
gonna do to her?!

411
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,916
[MARY] Please... don't...!

412
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,250
Bad!

413
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,250
[confused whimpers]

414
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,083
[MIRAJANE] Bad!

415
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,166
It's so terrifying...
This one time...

416
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,666
she was so desperate to catch
her enemy and discipline 'em

417
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,500
that she wiped out
an entire town.

418
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,416
Well, no wonder Master
forbade her from using it.

419
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,583
[BYRO] I have thoroughly
explained the purpose

420
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:30,208
of this holy war... Yet you
still insist on opposing us.

421
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,625
[LUCY] Honestly, I don't know
if I believe all that stuff

422
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,583
you said about the
end of the world.

423
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,208
I just care about keeping
my dad's memento safe!

424
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,625
So that's why
we're takin' that hand,

425
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,416
and the other clock pieces!

426
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,166
We're gonna do our
best to gather them all!

427
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,000
Enough of
your sinful drivel.

428
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,875
[LUCY] Run, Michelle! Hurry!

429
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,125
[MICHELLE] Okay!

430
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:52,083
Alright, Open, Gate of
the Golden Bull Taurus!

431
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:55,541
[TAURUS] Fierce... Mooove!

432
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,250
And here's another one!

433
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,625
[TAURUS] Look at you
with that tentacle!

434
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,833
This is my wildest
fantasy come truuuue!

435
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,208
Geez, would you
quit bein' a perv

436
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,625
and help me out here?!

437
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,333
Such indecent behavior.

438
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,083
I'm free!

439
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,458
[HAPPY] It's about time!

440
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,000
It's time to show this
jerk he can't mess with us!!

441
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,625
[ALL THREE]
Aye, aye, sir! Let's do this!

442
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,041
--[ROMEO] Purple Wire!
--[LUCY] Fleuve d'étoiles!

443
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,583
[BYRO] No!

444
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:22,791
[ROMEO] Now, Natsu!

445
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:23,916
[LUCY] This is your chance!

446
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
[NATSU] Here goes!

447
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,833
[HAPPY] Max Speed!

448
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:31,333
[NATSU] Plus...
Fire Dragon... Sword Horn!

449
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,708
[LUCY] I can't
hold on much longer-

450
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,666
By working together
to restrain Kanaloa,

451
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,791
they can now focus on me.
Quite an impressive attack.

452
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,250
Apparently there's more
to these Fairy Tail wizards

453
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,541
than we'd originally thought.

454
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,541
I'm losin'
my patience...

455
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:57,041
You'd better give Lucy that
clock hand or I'm gonna hurt ya.

456
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,083
I'm afraid I can't do that.

457
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,708
As we speak, members of
your guild are collecting

458
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,958
the scattered clock pieces
and are most likely

459
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,666
bringing them here.

460
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,166
I'm prepared to do
whatever it takes to stop you

461
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,500
from gathering them.

462
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,958
Well, I'm prepared
to beat your face in!

463
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,041
[PANTHERLILY] So what did you
want to talk to me about?

464
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,791
I consider myself
a proud member

465
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,041
of the Legion Platoon.

466
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,458
However, I have not
forgotten my roots.

467
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,666
I cannot deny
that I am an Exceed.

468
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,708
I've come to realize
that our sense of time

469
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,166
is vastly different than
that of the humans.

470
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,083
Surely even a muscle-brained
goon like you has noticed that.

471
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,000
Are you trying to pick
a fight with me?!

472
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,833
Please, just
hear me out...

473
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,541
Something has bothered me
since I deciphered that book.

474
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,791
It may sound odd... but,
as someone who shares

475
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,375
my sense of time, you
will likely understand.

476
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,791
I noticed something
inside of it

477
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,625
that I feel the need
to share with you.

478
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,291
Inside what book?

479
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,750
You mean "Key of
the Starry Heavens"?

480
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,333
Nu-uh! I don't
like this book at all!

481
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,583
[ALZACK and BISCA] Huh?

482
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:59,208
[ASCA] It's got a weird
story... and it's scary.

483
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,291
[gasps]

484
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,458
What are you doing,
Archbishop?!

485
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,375
You shouldn't be up, sir!

486
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:07,750
[ARCHBISHOP, excitedly]
It's close... So very close...

487
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,333
"Time ticks forward...

488
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:12,666
on toward inevitable chaos... "

489
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,583
It won't be long
before the end is upon us...

490
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,708
So very close...

491
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,083
[laughs]

492
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:20,666
[PANTHERLILY] Let me
get this straight...

493
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,708
there's still something
hidden in the book?

494
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,125
[SAMUEL] Don't think that
by sharing this with you

495
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:27,083
I am denouncing Zentopia.
I will fulfill my duty

496
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,041
as a member of
the Legion Platoon.

497
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:31,958
However, just as in Edolas,
no one knows what course

498
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:34,958
this holy war in the
human world will take.

499
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:55,500
♪

500
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,333
[HAPPY] Wait a minute,
that's not fair!

501
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:15,875
Nullifying magic
is totally cheating!

502
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,291
[NATSU] Chill out! We don't even
need magic to beat this guy!

503
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,291
[HAPPY] He seems to be
beating you pretty bad...

504
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,833
In fact, you've been
completely helpless

505
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:23,208
against him in this fight!

506
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:25,166
[NATSU] Don't be stupid!
Everyone knows a real hero

507
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,333
doesn't save the day until
things are at their worst!

508
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:30,416
[HAPPY] Uh-huh, sure.
Whatever you say "hero".

509
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,958
[HAPPY and NATSU] Next time:
Time Begins to Tick!

510
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:35,125
[HAPPY] I think you're more
of an underdog than a hero.

511
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:37,375
[NATSU] Hey, now! I'm
obviously a classic hero!

512
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:39,000
[HAPPY] I dunno. You'd
have to be a lot more

513
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:41,416
sophisticated to
pull off "classic".
