1
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,375
[LUCY] What the--?

2
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:22,416
Oh yeah! Water!
That's all I need!

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,666
Oh no!

4
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,458
Lucy's about to summon
the fish-lady spirit!

5
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,083
I thought
you liked fish!

6
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:30,208
[LUCY] Open, Gate
of the Water Bearer!

7
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,625
Huh?

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,041
[LUCY] Aquarius!

9
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,708
[AQUARIUS growls]

10
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:20,916
[MIRAJANE grunts]

11
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:24,750
[KAMIKA] Oh dear. It seems
the tales I'd heard about you

12
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,500
were nothing
more than that.

13
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,208
Mirajane,
the She-Devil?

14
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,083
Just a silly fantasy.

15
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,000
But I can
still have fun.

16
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:35,958
Executing criminals never fails
to bring a smile to my face.

17
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,875
[KAMIKA] Paper Blizzard:
Purple Dance!

18
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,291
I'm sure you remember
what these papers can do.

19
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,041
[MIRAJANE] Well, if you're
talking about making

20
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,791
it hard for me to
move. I remember.

21
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:56,333
Good. But, we can still
have so much fun together.

22
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,583
[KAMIKA] Paper Blizzard:
Red Dance!

23
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,041
I forgot that she
could use fire magic!

24
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,791
Now there's the
look I wanted to see.

25
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,500
That beautiful
face of yours

26
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,375
is even lovelier with
that expression...

27
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,250
I can see all the pain and
fear you're feeling inside.

28
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,750
It sends so many
shivers down my spine!

29
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,416
[KAMIKA laughs]

30
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,083
[MIRAJANE grunts]

31
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:22,708
[KAMIKA] But I suppose it's
time to cool you down a bit.

32
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,250
Paper Blizzard:
White Dance!

33
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,916
[MIRAJANE] My body feels
like it's turning to ice!

34
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:33,000
[KAMIKA] Oh, this is
unbelievably satisfying.

35
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:36,375
But I want more.
Let's liven things up!

36
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,375
[KAMIKA] Paper Blizzard:
Yellow Dance!

37
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,291
Yellow papers hold
the spirit of lightning.

38
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,833
]You may
use lightning.

39
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:47,041
But this is nothing compared
to what Laxus can do with it!

40
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,458
So you'd
like more pain?

41
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:49,708
Then perhaps I can
give you a taste

42
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:52,625
of what true agony feels like.

43
00:03:55,916 --> 00:04:01,458
[KAMIKA] Paper Blizzard:
Green Dance.

44
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,750
[MIRAJANE] What is this?!

45
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,250
It's an entirely
new level of pain.

46
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,625
These papers hold
the spirit of poison.

47
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,458
It should feel like a
million burning needles

48
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,375
are racing through
your bloodstream!

49
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,291
[MIRAJANE] You get some
sick enjoyment out of this?

50
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,291
[KAMIKA] What a silly question!

51
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,625
Of course I enjoy bringing
criminals to justice!

52
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,750
Besides, you
chose your fate

53
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,500
when you broke the
laws of the kingdom!

54
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,416
It's quite an
intense pain, isn't it?

55
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,916
But still, you seem
to be withstanding it.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,083
Could it be your
S-Class background?

57
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,875
I suppose I was a bit
too stingy with the poison.

58
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,416
[KAMIKA] Green Dance, Level Two!

59
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,250
[MIRAJANE grunts]

60
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,125
[KAMIKA] Ah,
that's more like it!

61
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,166
So, are you prepared to die?

62
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:46,958
[MIRAJANE] This is wrong.

63
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,875
Magic shouldn't be
used to kill people.

64
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,375
But sometimes, you
have to go to extremes

65
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,375
to protect others.

66
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,458
If you have the
power, you must use it.

67
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,541
To do what
has to be done.

68
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,500
[KAMIKA] Nothing but
complete and utter nonsense.

69
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,166
It appears the poison
has made you delirious!

70
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,166
[HAPPY] Our Place!

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,125
[NATSU] Fire Dragon... Roar!

72
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:24,166
What the...?
Where did all my fire go?

73
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,750
[LEADER] Neutralized.

74
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,333
My right scythe
reaps criminals' heads,

75
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:31,583
and my left scythe
reaps their magic.

76
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,416
Breathe all
the fire you wish.

77
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,875
The result will be the same.

78
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:38,625
Just hot air and the sound
of your life escaping.

79
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:42,166
[NATSU] Man, you love to listen
to yourself talk, don'cha?

80
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,375
So magic doesn't work on you.

81
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,583
That just means I'll
have to pound your face in!

82
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:53,541
[PANTHERLILY grunts]

83
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,583
[NEPPA] Sploosh!

84
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:56,500
[NEPPA laughs]

85
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:57,541
You're pretty tough.

86
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:58,958
I didn't think
skinning a pussy-cat

87
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,833
was gonna be so much fun!

88
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,458
Here kitty-kitty!

89
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,375
[PANTHERLILY] I'm no
pussycat! I'm an Exceed!

90
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,958
[NEPPA] I don't
care what you are.

91
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,583
But it seems like you
may have had some kind

92
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,875
of military training
or something?

93
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,791
As a matter
of fact, I have!

94
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,833
Guess that's what
makes you so hard-headed.

95
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,500
But I can wash that all
away with a little splash

96
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:17,958
of my special blend!

97
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:18,958
[PANTHERLILY] Never!

98
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,416
[NEPPA] Pop!

99
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,791
[NEPPA] Sploosh!

100
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:26,041
You sure are a nervous little
pussycat, aren't ya now?!

101
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,291
[NEPPA] Well ain't
that something?!

102
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,166
I thought my magic acid
could eat through anything.

103
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,250
Guess not!

104
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,625
[NEPPA laughs]

105
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,875
[NEPPA] Cuz' there you are,
back on your feet again!

106
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,625
I sure do love
me a challenge!

107
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,041
All your talking

108
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,708
just lets me know
how weak you are!

109
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,041
Oh yeah?

110
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,291
[PANTHERLILY] It's obvious...

111
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,125
A fighter who brags on
and on about his skills

112
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,541
when he should be
showing them off.

113
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,750
is simply covering
for his insecurities.

114
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,416
[NEPPA] Is that why ya keep
on flapping your gums, kitty?

115
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,166
[PANTHERLILY] I'd be willing to
bet that the only things you can

116
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,166
dissolve are those without
a mind of their own.

117
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,666
That you can only kill
what is weaker than you.

118
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,458
A true warrior
doesn't work that way.

119
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,833
That's why I won't lose.

120
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,041
[NEPPA] Oh?

121
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,958
That's a nice little speech,
but it ain't gonna help you.

122
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,458
In fact, you just
made things worse!

123
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:14,041
I'm done playing around with
you! It's killin' time!

124
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,583
[HAPPY] Oh no! It's
the mean ol' fish lady!

125
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,041
[CARLA] Hush, Happy!

126
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,791
If you got something
nasty to say about me...

127
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,291
Just say it! 'Kay?!

128
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,708
[HAPPY] She's so scary.

129
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:37,000
[CARLA] Then stop provoking
her, silly tomcat.

130
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,833
[UOSUKE] Boy howdy, that
is one funky lookin' catch!

131
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,416
[LUCY] C'mon Aquarius,
take this guy out for me!

132
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,583
[AQUARIUS] Tch...

133
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,791
Hey, where is this
attitude coming from?

134
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,666
I thought we were past all that.

135
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,916
Well, we're not.
Ya know...

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,833
I'm not feeling it today,
see ya later.

137
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,500
[LUCY] No, please don't go!

138
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,666
So, um... What's the matter?

139
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,333
Are you and Scorpio
having some issues?

140
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,875
Say what?!

141
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,041
[LUCY screams]

142
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,833
Do you know about
something that I don't?!

143
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,791
'Cause if I find out you're
keeping secrets from me,

144
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,833
you won't live to
regret it, bimbo!

145
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,416
No, I promise!

146
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,541
It's just that he seemed kinda
off when I summoned him earlier.

147
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,916
He's normally so cool and stuff,
but he wouldn't even look at me.

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,833
Does he normally
make eyes at you?

149
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,916
Is there something
going on behind my back?

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,541
No, no, there's
absolutely nothing going on.

151
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,958
I actually like living
too much to piss you off.

152
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,583
Quit jawbonin' cuz
we got some executin' to do...

153
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,041
Ya hear me?!

154
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,208
[AQUARIUS] I don't
like being interrupted.

155
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,291
You hear ME?!

156
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,416
[LUCY whimpers]

157
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,291
[UOSUKE] Doggone?!

158
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,708
That Whirlpool was a real doozy,

159
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,250
and you just sucked
the dang thing up!

160
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,958
[AQUARIUS] If you
wanna know the truth,

161
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,708
apparently Scorpio went on
a date with some other girl.

162
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,083
What? Oh, no he didn't!

163
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,500
[AQUARIUS] Apparently,
someone even saw them.

164
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,500
Apparently, huh?

165
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,291
Taurus said he thought
he heard Crux mumbling

166
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,000
something about
Nicola or somebody

167
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,541
seeing him out somewhere.

168
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,708
He said that he was slinking
around with some cheap floozy

169
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:00,916
in the human world.

170
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,416
Have you tried just
asking Scorpio about it?

171
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,125
It's not
that easy.

172
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,958
When I talk to him I start
to get all giddy and stuff.

173
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:12,250
So... I really just
don't see that happening.

174
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,875
Well, do you want
me to talk to him?

175
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,291
If you think this is
some kinda joke,

176
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,458
you're dead wrong!

177
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,500
You dare say one word
to him about this

178
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,833
and I'm gonna make you
wish you were never born!

179
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,750
[LUCY] Okay, mum's the word.

180
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,750
This is more entertaining
than I expected.

181
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:26,958
It's way better
than being stuck

182
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,750
in the middle of a fight.

183
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,166
[UOSUKE] Meddlin' in
a lady's love life

184
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,791
is like swimmin' with sharks.
You're gonna get bit...

185
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,666
Hang on, that reminds me...

186
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,000
[LUCY] What the? Oh yeah!
Water! That's all I need!

187
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,458
So this here water's
what let her land

188
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,375
that crabby fish lady, huh?

189
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:43,750
And that means...

190
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,500
If there wasn't no
cold water around,

191
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,166
then she wouldn't
be around, neither.

192
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,083
[HAPPY] Lucy! Look!

193
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,875
He's got some super weird
grin for some reason!

194
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,291
Careful, I think he's figured
out his plan of attack!

195
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:58,791
Terrain Effect Magic:
Boiling Water Zone!

196
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,750
[LUCY] Hey.

197
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,500
This water is getting
really hot all of a sudden.

198
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:04,833
[CARLA] It's steaming!

199
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,333
[HAPPY] Nice! It's a hot spring!

200
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,375
[LUCY] Oww! Hot! Hot!

201
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,666
[UOSUKE] Oh, that hot water's
got my little catch a-jumpin'!

202
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,125
Things are gonna get
really heated up now.

203
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,416
I'm just about
ready to reel ya in!

204
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,541
Yeah. This is
gonna be really bad.

205
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:24,208
[COSMOS] ♪ A beautiful sleep,
full of beautiful nightmares! ♪

206

♪ So much blood to
feed the flowers! ♪

208
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,208
[WENDY] Is that a song?

209
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,916
Yeah, And I wrote
it all by myself!

210
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
[COSMOS gasps]

211
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,541
[COSMOS] Wait, how did
you get up from that?!

212
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,708
[WENDY] Oh, shining light.
Cleanse me of my ailments...

213
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,541
Re-Rays.

214
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,458
[COSMOS] What?! Impossible!

215
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:44,500
Your status
ailment spells

216
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,625
will never be
able to work on me.

217
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,750
Because my friends all count
on me to support them.

218
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:50,791
]But still...

219
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,916
sometimes supporting
isn't enough.

220
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:55,833
What's happening?

221
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,875
This wind... it's
scattering my lovely flowers!

222
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,791
When I fight.
I become a Sky Dragon!

223
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:07,125
No! How revolting!

224
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,875
[COSMOS] Running
away isn't beautiful!

225
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,666
And playing dirty tricks
on me is disgusting!

226
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,125
I thought you had true beauty
underneath all your sins.

227
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,875
But there is
nothing but ugliness!

228
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,083
I haven't done anything 

229
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,916
[COSMOS] I can
never forgive you.

230
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,458
I can never love you...

231
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,375
[WENDY] Who said
anything about love?

232
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:27,125
[COSMOS] I will reduce your body
to ashes scattering in the wind!

233
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:30,166
Spore Bomb...
Rinka Renka!

234

[WENDY shouts]

00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,000
[COSMOS giggles]

236
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:39,208
When this dance is over,
you'll be just a memory...

237
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,333
with not even bones to bury.

238
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,250
[WENDY grunting]

239
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,083
[LEADER] You're only
postponing the inevitable.

240
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,541
Your fire magic is useless,

241
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,666
and your attacks have not
even come close to me.

242
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,166
[NATSU] Yeah, it's
kinda annoying...

243
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,291
But like I was saying, I'll
just have to kick your butt

244
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,625
the old fashioned way.

245
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,333
[LEADER] For your hubris,
and your crimes,

246
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:02,000
you will pay with your head.

247
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,958
[NATSU] Listen pal, I've had
more than my fair share

248
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,833
of fights where I
didn't use magic.

249
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,791
So I ain't scared
of you at all.

250
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,083
I'm not gonna
lose to a guy like you.

251
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,458
'Cause I've got some
other scores to settle

252
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,041
when we're done here.

253
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,166
[LEADER] You guild wizards
are ridiculous.

254
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,833
I won't deny that
you're strong...

255
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:20,250
But you will still fall before
me like all the other criminals!

256
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,583
And like them, you'll
become a nameless corpse!

257
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,000
[NATSU] I don't think so!

258
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:28,250
Gimme a shot! 'Cause
I'm fired up now!

259
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,375
I wish we could
help Natsu and them.

260
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:51,416
but master told us that we
shouldn't leave the coliseum.

261
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,750
Well, he's
right about that.

262
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,208
We don't wanna attract
any unwarranted attention.

263
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,500
If someone gets
suspicious it could

264
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,750
put Lucy's rescue
mission in trouble.

265
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:00,750
Oh, hey.

266
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,291
You ladies run off
to grab a snack?

267
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,625
[KINANA] Yeah, and walk
off some nerves, too.

268
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:05,666
[MAX] Tell me about it.

269
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,333
I'm worried about
Natsu and Lucy.

270
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,583
And the games are making
me even more stressed out.

271
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,708
[LAKI] Where'd Warren go?

272
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,041
I haven't seen him
in a little while.

273
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,750
[MAX] Somethin' was gettin'
in the way of his telepathy...

274
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,458
So he was gonna try to
get up onto higher ground

275
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,166
to see if that helps.

276
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,583
[KINANA] I'd love to get
outta here, but we can't...

277
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,875
It feels so helpless,
just waiting.

278
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,000
[LAKI] It'll work out.
You know Natsu...

279
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,875
I'll bet he's probably on
his way back with Lucy.

280
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,666
And the match seems
to be going our way,

281
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,916
exactly like Master Mavis
said that it would.

282
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,541
But there still are a lot
of tough ones left to beat.

283
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,291
Just have faith in her plan
and we'll win the games,

284
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,541
and have everybody
back to celebrate.

285
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,291
[ELFMAN] I'm a man!

286
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,833
[MAX] Yeah, nobody
said that you weren't!

287
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,375
Help me talk
some sense into him!

288
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,208
I'm making
perfect sense.

289
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,583
What's the matter?

290
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,708
Mira went with the team
that was going after Lucy..

291
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,916
We shoulda heard something
from them by now!

292
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,250
So, this genius thinks
that we all need to go

293
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,583
off and storm the royal palace
so we can go help them fight!

294
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,000
[MAX] Not exactly the best idea.

295
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,750
[ELFMAN] I know Mira can
hold her own but I'm worried,

296
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,750
and a real man fights
to save his family.

297
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,250
[LISANNA] We all want to help
them, but we just have to

298
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,625
give it some time
for the plan to work!

299
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,041
Got no other choice.

300
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,708
Besides, she's with Natsu
and he won't let anything

301
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,000
bad happen to her.

302
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,291
Well. As long as he
doesn't do something crazy

303
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:17,791
and stray away
from the plan.

304
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,375
That's it! I'm going!

305
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,250
No, you're not!

306
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,916
Just try to relax, man...

307
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,250
Natsu went through that whole
"second origin" thing...

308
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,625
And we all just saw
him beat the crap

309
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,583
out of those guys
from Sabertooth.

310
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,708
Mirajane has
her Satan Soul forms,

311
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,708
and Wendy is a
Dragon Slayer, too...

312
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,208
We'd just get in their way.

313
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,500
You're absolutely right.

314
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,250
We should focus our
energy on our team spirit

315
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:40,333
and cheer for our
guys in the match.

316
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,500
All right... I guess
I could pound some sense

317
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,458
into that old geezer
Darton, instead.

318
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,791
Were you
even listening?

319
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,041
You're staying with us!

320
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,750
We should probably
get back to our seats...

321
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,125
Somebody could be
watching us right now.

322
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,083
You're right. Come
on, let's get moving.

323
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:57,375
[ELFMAN] Yeah, okay... But
I still don't like this.

324
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,833
A real man would do
something, ya know?

325
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,666
I know, but
that's how it is.

326
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,541
Mirajane can handle it.

327
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,166
Actually the
real truth is...

328
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,208
we should feel sorry for the
poor soul who tries to stop her.

329
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,125
Impossible. You should
be so full of poison by now

330
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:15,416
that your body feels like it's
burning from the inside out!

331
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,125
You should
be on your knees.

332
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,625
screaming in pain

333
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,708
and begging me to put
you out of your misery!

334
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,833
How in the hell can
you still be standing up?!

335
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,791
[MIRAJANE] That's easy.

336
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,541
There are so many things
that you don't know about me.

337
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,541
Like, when I know
that I'm being watched...

338
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,500
or anywhere around
people, really.

339
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,125
I tend to stay a little guarded.

340
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,916
I try not to go all
out strength-wise,

341
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,041
because I don't
wanna scare anybody.

342
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,250
What?

343
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,333
[MIRAJANE] It's funny.

344
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,500
I'm a walking
contradiction, I guess.

345
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:46,708
But it's just the way I am.
Always have been.

346
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,500
But whenever it's just me,

347
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,750
I can go full-throttle
one hundred percent

348
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,083
power, no
problem at all.

349
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:56,000
What exactly are
you trying to say?

350
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,458
[KAMIKA gasps]

351
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,875
[KAMIKA] Unbelievable!
Is she really inhaling it?!

352
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,333
[MIRAJANE chuckles]

353
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:09,416
[MIRAJANE] Demons
like me love poison.

354
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,125
It's actually one of
my very favorite things.

355
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,875
A disgusting
Take-Over spell...

356
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:17,166
But I suppose it's fitting for
a filthy criminal like you!

357
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,375
It's over!

358
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,958
Because I can still
leave you paralyzed!

359
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:27,208
[KAMIKA] The gray papers
hold the spirit of protection!

360
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,875
[MIRAJANE] You may
be an executioner...

361
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,833
but just how much
of a fighter are you

362
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,500
when your victim
can fight back?!

363
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:37,000
[KAMIKA] The blue papers hold
the spirit of divine winds!

364
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,791
[MIRAJANE] Oh? The "divine"
running away from the demonic?

365
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,250
Not this time.

366
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,250
[KAMIKA] She can fly?!

367
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
[MIRAJANE] I'll ask
you once again!

368
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,958
[KAMIKA grunts]

369
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,708
[MIRAJANE] Can you tell
me where my friends went

370
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,708
or is this gonna get ugly?

371
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,375
[KAMIKA coughing]

372
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,291
I don't have to tell you
anything I don't want to!

373
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,625
[MIRAJANE] How far
are you willing to go

374
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,666
to keep it from me?!

375
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,958
Because, I'm
ready to fight you

376
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,333
without holding anything back...

377
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,583
So you'd better give me
the answer I'm looking for.

378
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,541
You're an
unclean monster!

379
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,250
[MIRAJANE] I'm a She-devil!

380
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,541
[KAMIKA] The black papers
hold the spirit of cleansing!

381
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:19,708
I can defeat a devil!

382
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,583
All I have to do is
purge your darkness!

383
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,708
[KAMIKA gasps]

384
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,791
My darkness is a flame
that'll never go out!

385
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,166
She's gone!

386
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,458
[KAMIKA grunts]

387
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,833
[KAMIKA] The indigo papers
hold the spirit of love.

388
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:34,958
Meaning they'll
conjure up any pain

389
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,916
you've endured
grieving over love!

390
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,375
And your heart will
literally be broken!

391
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,166
[roaring]

392
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:46,791
[LISANNA] C'mon.
Don't be afraid, Big Brother.

393
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:47,458
We still love you.

394
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:48,458
[MIRAJANE] Lisanna!

395
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,250
You have to wake up, Lisanna!

396
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:59,458
[rain pouring]

397
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,458
[KAMIKA] Now you'll be
trapped in your misery.

398
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,291
Forced to relive the trauma
and go through the pain

399
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,166
over and over again.
An endless hell.

400
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,416
The grief will
keep intensifying

401
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,958
until you lose your mind.

402
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,416
Ah...

403
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:15,458
[MIRAJANE] I got over
that pain a long time ago...

404
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:19,250
I know that I'm one of the
lucky ones, but I'm not alone...

405
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,458
Everyone experiences
profound pain

406
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,291
at some point
in their life.

407
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,000
But they
can all heal.

408
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,375
Let the past fade
into their memory.

409
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,625
For me, magic
gives me the strength

410
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,041
I need to grow from it.

411
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,416
Stop all this babbling!

412
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,208
I won't be lectured
by a criminal like--

413
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,958
[KAMIKA muffled screams]

414
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,208
[MIRAJANE] I learned
how to use my power

415
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,708
to protect the
people I care about.

416
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:40,916
Let me show you.

417
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,958
[KAMIKA whimpers]

418
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,250
[LUCY wails]

419
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,291
This water is boiling!

420
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,583
That means Aquarius
can't use it to attack.

421
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,916
What are we gonna do?

422
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,458
[UOSUKE] Yeah, she's
right on the money.

423
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,208
So, why don't ya haul it on
outta here, ya old rotten fish!

424
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,875
You're all used up,
and I guarantee

425
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,625
if I was your boyfriend,
I woulda thrown ya back too!

426
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,500
[LUCY] What a low blow!

427
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,250
What?!

428
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,916
I don't think he
shoulda said all that!

429
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,750
Definitely not.

430
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,625
[AQUARIUS] Water temperature
doesn't make a bit of difference

431
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,791
to me. This idiot
even summoned me

432
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,666
in the middle of
her bath before.

433
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,833
Huh?

434
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,666
Oh, yeah. That was
not such a good time.

435
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,333
Kinda blocked it out.

436
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,583
[UOSUKE] I was sure
that was gonna work!

437
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:19,791
What a load of chum!

438
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,000
[LUCY] Now, let's teach
this jerk a lesson!

439
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,750
Why don't
we just kill him?!

440
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,791
[PANTHERLILY grunts]

441
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,333
[NEPPA] You got popped!

442
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,000
There's never been a criminal
that's been able to get away

443
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:34,083
from my Multi-Angle acid
technique, so say your prayers!

444
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,541
[PANTHERLILY] Dig deep...

445
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,083
I won't be able to stay in
combat mode for much longer.

446
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,833
Gotta
make it count!

447
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,750
[GAJEEL] Come on! Is
that all ya got!

448
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,875
Step it up!

449
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,125
[PANTHERLILY thinking]
All those days I spent

450
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,916
training with Gajeel.
I gotta remember them.

451
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,500
[grunting]

452
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:53,583
[GAJEEL] Don't get soft on me!
Hit me with your best shot! Now!

453
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,958
[NEPPA] Eh?

454
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,791
[PANTHERLILY] No matter how
many times he pummeled me

455
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,750
with those iron fists,
I never gave up!

456
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,250
[GAJEEL yells]

457
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,541
Hey. Tell me something...

458
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,708
[GAJEEL] What?

459
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,625
Can you explain to
me what just happened?

460
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,416
My sword is made from
metal like your body,

461
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,125
so why did it
shatter to pieces?

462
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,916
Isn't it obvious?

463
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,458
This makes all
the difference, pal.

464
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,250
Well, that and what
I got on the inside...

465
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,291
There's iron in my soul.

466
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,500
My mind and body
are stronger than steel!

467
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,125
All your acid will
never eat that away!

468
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,125
[NEPPA] Sploosh!

469
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,500
And it'll never
break my spirit!

470
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,666
That's the strongest of all!

471
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,000
[NEPPA] Uh oh. He cut the acid?!

472
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,500
[COSMOS grunts]

473
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:47,041
[COSMOS] No! You blew away
all of my lovely spore bombs!

474
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:50,083
But still, I have many
beautifully deadly plants

475
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,125
at my disposal.

476
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,958
[WENDY] What now? I gotta think.

477
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,708
Even though I don't
understand her magic.

478
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,000
I can't lose.

479
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:01,000
What would
Natsu do to win?

480
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,333
Yeah, definitely.

481
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,375
That's exactly
what he would do.

482
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,958
[LEADER] Damn you!

483
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,541
I don't understand!
How can you even touch me?

484
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,125
Are you some kind of monster?!

485
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,291
[NATSU] Sorry,
I'm not a monster...

486
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:16,208
But I am a Fire Dragon Slayer.

487
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,625
[LEADER] No!

488
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,208
[NATSU] I think you're way
overdue for a beat-down!

489
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,166
[LEADER] Where is all this
strength coming from?!

490
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,125
How can he still have
so much magic power?!

491
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,375
[grunts]

492
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,333
Did you seriously think
you could take it away?

493
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,791
Think again!

494
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,291
[LEADER] How dare you.

495
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:38,708
With that, you've
truly made yourself

496
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,541
an enemy of the kingdom!

497
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,125
[NATSU] You know, I'm not
too worried about that...

498
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,541
You should be, though.

499
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,791
Because it's an even bigger
mistake to make yourself

500
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,625
an enemy of the
Fairy Tail guild.

501
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,041
[gasps]

502
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,750
[UOSUKE yelling]

503
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,291
[NATSU] And that
means everybody in it.

504
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,125
[NEPPA yelling]

505
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,291
We're not scared
of the kingdom

506
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,375
or anybody who tries
to bring us down!

507
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,708
[WENDY] Shattering Light:
Sky Drill!

508
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,041
[MIRAJANE] Hyaah!

509
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,583
[NATSU] We never
give up the fight!

510
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,208
[ALL groaning]

511
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,500
Oh!

512
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:16,500
Nice.

513
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:17,541
Oh, hi!

514
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,083
[HAPPY] Natsu!

515
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:20,458
[WENDY] Wow, you're all here!

516
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,666
[LUCY] Talk about
perfect timing!

517
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,750
Yeah, this is
totally awesome!

518
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:25,833
[MIRAJANE] I'll say!

519
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:27,791
And it looks like
everybody's okay!

520
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,458
By the skin
of our teeth...

521
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,375
And we're gonna be even
better once we figure a way

522
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,083
to get out of this dungeon.

523
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,708
We lost... But how?

524
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:37,208
[NATSU] Okay, scumbag!

525
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:40,083
Tell us where the exit is, or
you're gonna get executed.

526
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:41,541
He's scary.

527
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:15,500
[NATSU] Ugh. Well,
that took forever,

528
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,416
but I think I finally
see sweet daylight again!

529
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,333
[HAPPY] I was worried
we wouldn't make it

530
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,708
past those creeps.

531
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:22,416
[NATSU] We always do,
little buddy!

532
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,666
Hold on, who's that
standing by the exit?

533
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,333
Don't you think they
look kinda familiar?

534
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:28,083
[HAPPY] Yeah, weird...

535
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:31,375
I was just thinkin'
the exact same thing!

536
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:33,916
[HAPPY &amp; NATSU] Next time:
The Kingdom 'til Tomorrow!

537
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,791
[NATSU] Wait a second... Whoa.
I totally know that smell!

538
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:38,791
[HAPPY] Huh?

539
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:41,458
What in the heck
is going on here?!
