[CROWD cheering]

2
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:32,791
[LUCY whimpers]

3
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:36,500
[WENDY] You're finally awake!
We were starting to get worried.

4
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,916
I'm fine. What
match are they on?

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,375
[WENDY] Far as I can tell,
they're between matches.

6
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,666
And it sounds like
Blue Pegasus won.

7
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,250
[CARLA] The second round should
be starting any minute now.

8
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,916
Lamia Scale's going
up against Mermaid Heel.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,791
Oh, good. I was worried that

10
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,500
I might've missed Natsu's fight.

11
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,208
There's no need to worry,
he said he's gonna

12
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,041
make sure to come by and check
on you before he goes in.

13
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,666
Until then...

14
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,708
why don't you try
to get some rest?

15
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,750
[CARLA] You just focus on
getting your strength back.

16
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,458
We'll wake you
when he gets here.

17
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:07,208
You're the best.
Thank you, Carla.

18
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,583
All right! It's time
for the second match!

19
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,666
Let's hear it for
Lamia Scale's...

20
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,916
[CHAPATI] Lyon and Yuka!

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,375
[CROWD cheering]

22
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:52,125
And here come the lovely
ladies of Mermaid Heel.

23
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:55,208
[CHAPATI] Give it up
for Kagura and Millianna!

24
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,250
Are you feelin' pretty pumped?

25
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,541
[MILLIANNA] You can
cheer louder than that!

26
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,291
C'mon, lemme hear ya!

27
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,875
[CHAPATI] So what do
you think, Mr. Yajima?

28
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,750
Who's going to come out on top?

29
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,583
[YAJIMA] Honestly, this
one could go either way.

30
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,375
I can assure you it's going
to be an exciting match.

31
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,416
Lyon and Yuka
are formidable foes!

32
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,833
Stay focused. Okay, Millianna?

33
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,583
Heh. Well, well,
you're rootin' for

34
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,333
Mermaid Heel now, are ya?

35
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,333
Yeah. I've known
Millianna a long time.

36
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,083
I consider her a friend.

37
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,000
Can you blame me
for supporting her?

38
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,458
What about you? Your ol'
buddy Lyon is about to

39
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,083
go to battle
for Lamia Scale.

40
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,916
Dontcha want to help
him out a little?

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,333
Why should I? Doesn't
make sense to help

42
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,333
another guild, not when
our teams are rivals.

43
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,208
[ERZA]
What's the matter, Natsu?

44
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,291
It's just that Lucy,
Elfman, and the others...

45
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,666
prob'ly wish they could
watch the matches, too.

46
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,750
Hmmm.

47
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,458
In that case, we'll
just have to try

48
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,208
and remember
all the details.

49
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,916
That way we can tell
them about it later.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,500
Yeah, great idea.
Okay! Let's do it!

51
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,375
[HAPPY]
Battle of Dragon Slayers!

52
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,791
Just lettin' you
know that I'm gonna be

53
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,375
rootin' for Mermaid Heel.

54
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,333
And that's only because
I've known Millianna since

55
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,333
the whole Tower of
Heaven thing went down.

56
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,541
Well, I'm gonna be
cheering for Lamia Scale.

57
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,166
It's the least I can do since
they're always helping us.

58
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,125
Yes, indeed.
It's very noble of you

59
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,791
to honor them in that way.

60
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,000
You do that kid,
meanwhile we're gonna root

61
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,708
for Mermaid Heel
'cause they're hotties!

62
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,458
[LEVY sighs]

63
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:30,458
Lemme guess, you're gonna be
cheering for Lyon, eh Juvia?

64
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,750
So has he confessed his
undying love to you yet?

65
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,166
Aw c'mon,
you can tell us,

66
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,958
inquiring minds wanna know!

67
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:39,666
Well, kinda. I guess he did.

68
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,291
[JUVIA] If only I was
on the same team as Gray.

69
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:46,166
What I wouldn't give
to fight alongside him!

70
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,708
That's it! There's still
a chance it could happen!

71
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,333
If someone on
our team is injured,

72
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,875
then someone else will
have to take their place!

73
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:59,500
You're the only partner
for me! Let's become one!

74
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,583
Whaddya say?

75
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:07,250
Yes! I'd be happy to
be your partner, my love!

76
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,583
[JUVIA] What's wrong with me?

77
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,708
I'm a horrible person
for hoping that my fellow

78
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:13,375
guild members get hurt
so I can be close to Gray!

79
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,625
I care about him so much

80
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,500
that I'll do anything
to be by his side!

81
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,708
[JUVIA] Anything!

82
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,666
But not if it means
my friends will suffer!

83
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,041
I'm so torn,
I don't know what to do!

84
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,291
[LEVY] Uh. No need
to freak out, okay?

85
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,916
Is there something
that's troubling you?

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,375
If so, you can tell us.

87
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,250
You'll feel a lot better if
you get it off your chest.

88
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,208
[JUVIA muffled yells]

89
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,708
[MAKAROV] We're getting close.
Only one more match until

90
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:38,000
Fairy Tail finally goes
head-to-head with Sabertooth.

91
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,541
Well, I'm not worried
because I believe in them!

92
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,958
[MAVIS] They'll be fine.
Let's sit down and enjoy the--

93
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,208
Waaa-hohaaa!

94
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,833
First Master!

95
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,958
How about we just
pretend that didn't happen

96
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,625
and go back to watching
the match, okay?

97
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,166
[MILLIANNA] It's crazy to
think Jellal could be out there

98
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,333
somewhere, sitting in the
stands watching us fight.

99
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,250
[KAGURA] Millianna.

100
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,291
You need to focus.

101
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,458
'Kay! I swear I will!

102
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,791
Hmmm.

103
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,041
Tell you what, I'm going
to let you take a shot

104
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:13,291
at them first. I'll be
standing by if you need me.

105
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,125
[MILLIANNA]
Hey, wait! All alone?

106
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,125
[KAGURA] You need to
gain more experience.

107
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:20,000
This is your opportunity
to show me what you can do.

108
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:23,250
Don't treat it like a game,
it's a serious fight.

109
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,000
[KAGURA] Don't let
me down, Millianna.

110
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:28,208
[MILLIANNA] I won't!
I'll beat 'em, you just watch!

111
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,833
We can't get lazy just because
they're girls, ya hear?

112
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,000
They're tough so
we need to give it

113
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,833
everything we've
got in this battle.

114
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:37,541
Especially if we want
to beat Kagura. That's it!

115
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,125
[LYON] If I claim
victory for Lamia Scale...

116
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,500
then Juvia will
fall in love with me!

117
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,416
[YUKA] Aw, geez. Get your
priorities straight, man.

118
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,875
'Kay boys! You'd better
kick some butt this round

119
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,791
or I'll take ya
both for a spin!

120
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:54,208
[MATO] Remember you've only got
thirty minutes to seal the deal!

121
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,500
Now, let the match begin!

122
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,833
[MILLIANNA]
If you snooze, you lose!

123
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,583
Bad Kitty Restraint Tube!

124
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,583
[BETH] Whoa, is Millianna
gonna fight 'em all by herself?

125
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,041
I don't think she's
ready to take on

126
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,750
Lamia Scale on her own.

127
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,833
Well, Kagura seems to think
that she can handle it.

128
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,833
[LISLIE] Let's just
hope she's right.

129
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:22,125
I don't need any help
with these guys! Ha!

130
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,083
It's gonna be so embarrassing
if she beats both of them.

131
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,416
We'll be the laughing
stock of the tournament.

132
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,458
[OHBA] I don't know what
you're up to, Mermaid Heel...

133
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,416
but we're not gonna
let you get away with it!

134
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,458
Go get 'em, Lyon and Yuka!
Show those hussies what happens

135
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,083
when you mess
with Laymia Scale!

136
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,083
Hey, why's Kagura
just standing there?

137
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,583
Good question. Bet I
can get her to fight.

138
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:47,083
[LYON] Ice Make Eagle!

139
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,666
I'm your opponent, not her!

140
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,125
Wave!

141
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,458
Holy!

142
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,916
[MILLIANNA] Kitten Blaster!

143
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,041
What? That was just a fake-out?

144
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,625
[MILLIANNA] I've got you now!

145
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,708
Kitty Punch! Kitty Punch!
Kitty Punch! Kitty Punch!

146
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,750
Man, That's gotta hurt!
Who would've thought

147
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,375
such a cute, little cat-girl
could be so incredibly vicious?

148
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,250
Whoa, that's one
hard-core kitty!

149
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,625
She's definitely not
holding back in this fight.

150
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,458
She must feel more
confident knowing that

151
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,250
Kagura's there
if she needs her.

152
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,208
[MILLIANNA]
What's the matter, boys?

153
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,000
You're not scared, are you?

154
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,416
Then again, maybe you should be

155
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,791
'cause I've been
training with Kagura daily!

156
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,000
[MILLIANNA] Special technique.

157
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,416
Kitty Scratch Attack!

158
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,875
Aw, what's the matter?

159
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,666
Did I give you a boo-boo?

160
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,708
[YUKA and LYON grunt]

161
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,208
I certainly
didn't see this comin'!

162
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,958
Millianna is actually holding
her own against those two.

163
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,166
And they're a couple of
Lamia Scale's strongest!

164
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,708
I think it's those nimble,
cat-like movements of hers.

165
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,541
The way she bounces around in
battle would throw anyone off.

166
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:54,750
Stupid cat-girl!

167
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,625
I'm gonna rip out
those claws of hers.

168
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:57,875
If we wanna win this round,

169
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,875
we'll have to step up our game!

170
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,708
Bad Kitty Restraint Tube!

171
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,250
Here we go!

172
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:08,500
[YUKA] It's useless! My waves
can nullify any magic attack!

173
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,708
Oh, yeah? Then nullify this!

174
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,833
[MILLIANNA] Bad Kitty Restraint
Tube! Double! Triple!

175
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,666
Mmmm...

176
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,250
[MILLIANNA] Lots of 'em!

177
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,291
You can throw more than
one of 'em at a time?

178
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,583
I can show you
just how many

179
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,166
if you really
want me to!

180
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,500
[grunts]

181
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,375
[LYON] Ice Make Eagle!

182
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,833
She's throwing some more!

183
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,416
That's right!
Just try and stop me!

184
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,833
[grunts]

185
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,583
[MILLIANNA] Well, boys?
Are you ready to surrender yet?

186
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:46,916
[LYON] Now what'll we do?

187
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,041
At this rate...

188
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:51,000
I'll never be able
to impress Juvia!

189
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,375
You have gotta be
kidding me. Get a grip!

190
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,083
[LYON] It's not over yet.
I've got more than skill;

191
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,958
I have intelligence!

192
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,791
You may be faster,
but I'm much smarter!

193
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,625
[LYON] Ice Make Mouse!

194
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,458
[MILLIANNA] Meow! Meow!

195
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,666
[giggles]

196
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,750
[MILLIANNA] It's a mousey!
Yay! Hey, wait up!

197
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,000
[laughing]

198
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,458
That was a
dirty trick, jerkface!

199
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,166
You need to chill out, kitty!

200
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,375
[LYON] Rage, oh blizzard!

201
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,250
It's freezing.

202
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:29,958
[MILLIANNA] Cats hate
being stuck out in the cold!

203
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:33,166
Huh? Oh! That looks warm!

204
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,291
Cats love snuggling
up to the heater!

205
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,333
It's so nice and toasty! Meow!

206
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,833
I could stay here forever.

207
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,333
[MILLIANNA]
Cut it out, ice freak

208
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,125
or I'm gonna scratch
out your eyeballs!

209
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,666
Ugh! Talk about
playing dirty;

210
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,750
how dare he torment
Millianna like that?

211
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,083
Well, that Lyon has
quite the reputation.

212
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,916
He's deviously cunning.

213
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,750
Uh, don't ya
think you might be

214
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,708
givin' him too much credit?

215
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,375
[LYON] Did you see that, Juvia?

216
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,291
Were you impressed
by my clever strategy?

217
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,416
[LYON] That's not
the reaction I expected.

218
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,166
[KAGURA] Lyon has a
reputation as a skilled wizard,

219
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,875
but has yet to land a
single attack on Millianna.

220
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,666
[MATO] Oh, wow! I knew
Mermaid Heel and Lamia Scale

221
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,625
were tough competitors,
but this match is

222
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,916
even more exciting
than I expected!

223
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,416
[laughs]

224
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,000
Hurry up! Quit dillydallying
and finish them off already!

225
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,416
You had better defeat them,

226
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
or I'll spin you
'til you're sick!

227
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,583
What's it like to be
spun by the ol' hag?

228
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,625
It's one of the worst
feelings in the world.

229
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:34,833
It makes you so dizzy that you

230
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,875
can't even tell
which way is up.

231
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,583
The hag's right;
we need to hurry.

232
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,625
It feels like we've been
fighting them for a while.

233
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,333
We're running out of time.

234
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,791
Well, in that case...
I was saving this spell

235
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,041
for our battle
with Kagura, but...

236
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:50,541
Ice Make... Snow Tiger!

237
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:54,791
[screaming]

238
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:59,541
I like kitty cats,
but tigers not so much!

239
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,000
Aaah!

240
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,750
[MILLIANNA]
I'm so sorry, Kagura.

241
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,250
[KAGURA] Unfortunately,
it seems I'm going

242
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,041
to have to fight after all.

243
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,000
We're so glad you could
join us! Let's go!

244
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,791
Less talking,
more fighting!

245
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,250
Wave!

246
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:26,458
[KAGURA] Attacks that nullify an
opponent's magic? Impressive.

247
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:32,041
[KAGURA] But against me...
it's pointless!

248
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,958
This match is getting
intense, folks!

249
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,833
[CHAPATI] Kagura doesn't
even have to draw her sword

250
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,833
to lay the smack
down on her opponent!

251
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,458
Heck, she's not
even using her magic!

252
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,916
Wave!

253
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,666
[KAGURA] Too slow!

254
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,416
[cheering]

255
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,500
Poor Yuka couldn't
even get in a single hit

256
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,250
before he was knocked out cold!

257
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,125
Lamia Scale's in trouble now!

258
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,291
[CHAPATI] Looks like it's
gonna be Kagura versus Lyon

259
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,208
in a one-on-one battle!

260
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,583
[CROWD cheering]

261
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,208
She defeated Yuka
without drawing her sword.

262
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,750
She's more powerful
than I thought.

263
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,583
Kagura Mikazuchi.

264
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,750
It's clear that she's
a skilled fighter.

265
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,250
She's not bad but I bet
she wouldn't last a second

266
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,208
against my Iron Dragon Sword.

267
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,666
[chuckles]

268
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,416
Hey, do you think that
Lyon's gonna be all right?

269
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,166
Well, I hope so, but he had
a hard time against Millianna,

270
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,583
and now he's up against
Kagura, who's even stronger.

271
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,250
[OHBA] Watch your tongue!
You have no idea

272
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:43,333
what kind of power he has
buried under that cool façade.

273
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,416
Lyon! Don't let that
stone-faced strumpet

274
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,666
get the best of you!

275
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,958
Make her pay for what
she did to poor Yuka!

276
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,541
[KAGURA] I've heard
a lot about you.

277
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,625
Apparently you once called
yourself the "Cold Emperor"

278
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,583
and you performed a
dangerous ritual in

279
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,000
the hopes of fighting
the demon Deliora.

280
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,833
[LYON]
That was a long time ago.

281
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:04,541
Now I'm just Lyon Bastia,
a wizard with Lamia Scale.

282
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,500
Nothing more, nothing less.

283
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:07,916
You know something?

284
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,458
You remind me a lot
of myself years ago.

285
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,916
But that's not a compliment,
because I was consumed

286
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,625
by bitterness
and hatred back then.

287
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,083
I have a question for you.

288
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,375
[KAGURA] I noticed
that you never

289
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,125
attacked Millianna directly.

290
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,958
Were you holding back
just because she's a girl?

291
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,791
Or were you worried
that in doing so

292
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,375
you might reveal
your secrets to me?

293
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,583
Good question.
Maybe you'll find out

294
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,708
the answer during our battle!

295
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,666
[LYON] Ice Make Dragonfly!

296
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,833
[LYON] Ice Make Eagle!

297
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,500
Just one swing and...
he's down!

298
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,583
[CHAPATI] Can he get back up or
is this the end of the match?

299
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,583
[GRAY] What the hell do
you think you're doing?

300
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,916
And you call yourself
Master Ur's student!

301
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,875
If she saw you right now,
she'd be completely embarrassed!

302
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,833
C'mon, I know you can
do better than that!

303
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,041
Are you going to attack?

304
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,041
Because I thought
we came here to fight!

305
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,708
I'm losing my patience!

306
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:11,166
[LYON] Me, too. So let's
hurry and get this over with!

307
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:15,375
[LYON] Ice Make Snow Tiger!

308
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,708
And now, Ice Make Snow Ape!

309
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,708
