1
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:21,750
[girl crying]

2
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,541
[MICHELLE]
Why are you crying?

3
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,208
[YOUNG LUCY]
I can't help it.

4
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,583
I'm sad 'cause
everyone's gone.

5
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:31,708
Mommy, Daddy, and
even my little sister.

6
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,375
[MICHELLE] So you
remember me now?

7
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,000
[YOUNG LUCY] Yeah.

8
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,958
I'm sorry I forgot.

9
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,875
[MICHELLE] You don't
have to apologize.

10
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:44,541
I'm just happy you
remembered me, Big Sister.

11
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,416
Michelle.

12
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:53,000
[panting]

13
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,958
Aw, c'mon!

14
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,125
How many more of these

15
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,250
do we have to destroy
before this works?

16
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:00,166
[ERZA] Warren!

17
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,625
What's the situation?

18
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:04,166
[WARREN] More than half of
the chains are still intact!

19
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,708
You guys, please hurry!

20
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:07,083
It's no use.

21
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:08,708
It's taking
us too long.

22
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:10,250
I'm afraid
we've no other choice

23
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,333
but to go through
and cut them one-by-one.

24
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:15,208
[CARLA] Come child,
we have to keep going!

25
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:22,291
[MIDNIGHT] It won't
be long now.

26
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,833
Once I fulfill
my father's wish,

27
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,458
everything will
cease to exist!

28
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:27,916
[COCO] No!

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,333
Please Lucy!
You have to wake up!

30
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:31,458
Natsu, we're
gonna lose her

31
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,166
if we don't hurry!

32
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,583
[NATSU] No way!

33
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:36,875
I'm not gonna let
you just disappear!

34
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:40,250
You've gotta hang
in there, Lucy!

35
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,250
Can you stand up?

36
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,541
[ROMEO] Michelle's gone.

37
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:19,916
Yeah, she is.

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,125
Just let it go.

39
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,125
We got more
important things

40
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,625
to worry about right now.

41
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,041
Yeah, you're right.

42
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,250
Can you hear me?

43
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,541
I know they're
cutting the chains

44
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:28,583
but it doesn't seem 

45
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,250
to be doing
anything to help her!

46
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,291
[ROMEO] We're not
gonna make it in time!

47
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,750
We've gotta
defeat their final member!

48
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,875
Alright, we'll help
you take him down, Natsu!

49
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,291
Yeah!

50
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,458
[MIDNIGHT] Klodoa.

51
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,625
[KLODOA] Allow me to
handle them, Master.

52
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,583
I won't let you fools
interfere with our plans!

53
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,708
[NATSU] You guys focus on
snappin' that twig in two!

54
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,875
Meanwhile, I'm gonna
punch the make-up

55
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,708
right offa this punk's face!

56
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,458
Let's do this, Romeo!

57
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,333
Yeah!
I'm fired up now!

58
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:02,541
[HAPPY] Lucy and Michelle!

59
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,833
[COBRA] Damn you, Titania.

60
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,083
You should've
just killed me

61
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,416
when you
had the chance.

62
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,375
Someone's coming.

63
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,416
Who's there?

64
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,291
Reveal yourself!

65
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,708
I'm not scared
of your flames.

66
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:22,625
You can attack
all you want

67
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,416
but they will
never burn me.

68
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,333
[MIDNIGHT] Eventually...

69
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,250
You'll run out
of magic power.

70
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,291
[NATSU] Yeah,
that's what you think!

71
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,125
If you ain't afraid of me 

72
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,250
how come you keep
avoiding my attacks?

73
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,625
You're a coward!

74
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,875
[MIDNIGHT] And now all
you can do is hurl insults?

75
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,125
It's quite telling.

76
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,250
Obviously I hold
the power here.

77
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,000
[MIDNIGHT] I've always
dreamed of having magic power

78
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,375
equal to that of my father.

79
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,958
And after my sacrifice,
I finally do.

80
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,750
[NATSU] What kinda sacrifice?

81
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:50,875
[MIDNIGHT] Now you will become
a traveler of the void.

82
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,958
Salamander.

83
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,833
Genesis Zero!

84
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,333
Open Gate
of Restless Wailing!

85
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,375
Go forth,
travelers of the void!

86
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,875
I want you to consume
his soul, his memory.

87
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,625
Consume his very existence!

88
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:12,708
Devour him!

89
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:15,208
For the sake of your master!

90
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,208
[ELFMAN] Natsu!
[ROMEO] Natsu!

91
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,833
[MIDNIGHT] That should be
the last of you.

92
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,583
You're forever
trapped within the darkness.

93
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:27,791
Much like your friend 

94
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,166
who is trapped
within perpetual time.

95
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,750
[JUDE] Lucy.

96
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,041
[LAYLA] What do
you think, dear?

97
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,125
Do you like her?

98
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,208
[YOUNG LUCY] Oh yeah!

99
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,875
She's the best
birthday present ever!

100
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,666
[YOUNG LUCY] And she's gonna
be my new, little sister!

101
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,666
[LAYLA] That's wonderful.

102
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,458
Take good care of her, okay?

103
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,583
[YOUNG LUCY] I need to
think up a nice name for her.

104
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:52,875
Like Gonzales!

105
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:53,708
Yeah!

106
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,958
[LAYLA] Um.

107
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,791
Why don't you go with
something more feminine?

108
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,208
[MICHELLE] Do you
remember how much fun we had?

109
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,958
The mansion was so big

110
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,125
that it felt like
a castle to us.

111
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:06,375
[MICHELLE] You made me so
many beautiful outfits

112
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,375
out of nothing but
paper and flowers.

113
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,333
[MICHELLE] We went
everywhere together

114
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:15,750
and wherever we went,
you were all smiles.

115
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,583
But then...

116
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,458
[LUCY] My mom died.

117
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,291
Every day I would go
to her grave and cry.

118
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,833
[LUCY] I lashed out
at everyone around me.

119
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,291
I can't imagine

120
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,291
how worried my
father must've been.

121
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,625
[MICHELLE] I felt so helpless
because all I could do

122
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,291
was watch you go through it.

123
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,833
I wish I had been
able to help you somehow.

124
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,916
[LUCY] Every time
I looked at you,

125
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,750
it reminded me of my mom

126
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,541
and how much I missed her.

127
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,083
[MICHELLE] I know.

128
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:48,125
[MICHELLE] I assumed that's
why you stopped talking to me.

129
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,500
[LUCY] Sorry.

130
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:53,833
Time passed and I eventually
forgot all about you.

131
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:58,083
[LUCY] For years and years,
you sat patiently,

132
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,458
waiting for the day

133
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,500
I would come
back to you again.

134
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,416
[JUDE] I'm sorry.

135
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,500
She hasn't
necessarily abandoned you.

136
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,458
It's just that the sorrow

137
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,875
of losing her mother
has overwhelmed her.

138
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,208
She's so distracted

139
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:20,500
she's lost sight of what
was once important to her.

140
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:23,041
[JUDE] I wish
there was something

141
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:26,083
I could do to
ease her heartache.

142
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,958
[JUDE] Someday,
when she's grown up

143
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,916
and she's gotten
over her mother's death,

144
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,458
it is my hope that
you'll get the chance

145
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,500
to be her
little sister again.

146
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,250
[MICHELLE] For years
I waited patiently,

147
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,958
hoping you'd come back.

148
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:50,833
Over time, the once-lively
mansion grew quiet.

149
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,708
[MICHELLE] Eventually,
it was deserted.

150
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,041
[MICHELLE] When someone
finally came looking for me

151
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:02,083
it wasn't my big sister.

152
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,583
[MICHELLE] I was so
thankful to be given life

153
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:11,458
as Imitatia that I did
exactly as I was told.

154
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,125
I took the name
Michelle Lobster

155
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:16,208
and set out to obtain
the Infinity Clock.

156
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,083
[LUCY] So when you told me

157
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,208
you had helped
my father with his work.

158
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,333
[MICHELLE] It was
the absolute truth.

159
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,541
[MICHELLE] It broke
my heart to use him

160
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,208
but it had to be done.

161
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,791
I wanted the good
old days back.

162
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,041
[MICHELLE] Lucy,
all I wanted

163
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:36,916
was to be your
sister again.

164
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,375
I know you
and your father

165
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,291
have had your ups
and downs over the years.

166
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,916
But that's normal.

167
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,125
It's all
part of being a family.

168
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,791
No matter
what happens

169
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,833
the bond you share
will bring you together.

170
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,583
[JUDE] I haven't
heard from her

171
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:59,875
but I know Lucy's still
alive out there somewhere.

172
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:04,208
Will you go find her and
give her the clock hand?

173
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,208
Please, Michelle.

174
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,958
Of course I will.

175
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,166
You know,
I'm always amazed

176
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,875
by the power of magic.

177
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:17,375
This time
I'm sure of it.

178
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:21,958
You will be her little
sister once again.

179
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm so sorry, Michelle.

180
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,166
That must've been
really hard for you.

181
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,375
[MICHELLE] Please
stop crying, Big Sister.

182
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,750
It's okay.

183
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:46,333
You're loved by
so many people.

184
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,083
Listen closely
and you'll hear

185
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,416
them calling out to you.

186
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,875
I do!

187
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,500
I can hear everyone

188
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,291
and I can see them!

189
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,958
My friends!

190
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,875
[ERZA] Hang in
there, Lucy!

191
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:06,833
[WENDY] We're too slow!

192
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,458
Hurry! We've gotta
work faster!

193
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,125
[CARLA] Okay!

194
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,000
On to the next one!

195
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:10,708
[GRAY] What's up?

196
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:11,916
Have we beat 'em yet?

197
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,166
[CARLA] Warren!

198
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,625
How's Natsu's team?

199
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:15,333
[WARREN] Aw, crap!

200
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,500
I dunno what happened 

201
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,375
but I've lost my
telepathic link with him!

202
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,375
[ROMEO] Natsu's in
serious trouble!

203
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,250
[ELFMAN] He just
vanished into thin air!

204
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,791
[KLODOA] There's no
saving your friend

205
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,916
now that he's been
consumed by the darkness,

206
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,375
so you might as well
give up the fight.

207
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,208
[NATSU] Please, just wait
a little longer, Lucy.

208
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,166
I'm comin' to save you!

209
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,291
[LUCY] Natsu.

210
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,958
The longer I'm here.

211
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:40,208
The more I lose
sight of who I am.

212
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,750
I can't!

213
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,791
I've gotta do something!

214
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,375
[MIDNIGHT] No matter
how much you struggle,

215
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:48,250
you will never
escape the darkness.

216
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,625
[MIDNIGHT] Your time is up.

217
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,291
Goodbye, great
dragon wizard.

218
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,333
[NATSU] No!

219
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,041
I ain't done yet!

220
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,083
[NATSU] You hurt
Lucy and Michelle!

221
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,458
Now I'm gonna hurt you!

222
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:04,750
[LUCY] I can't
keep crying forever.

223
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:05,708
No!

224
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,333
Apologize to Michelle!

225
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,750
And bring Natsu back!

226
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:14,916
[COCO] What's
happening now?

227
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,458
[HAPPY] It's so bright!

228
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,833
[ROMEO] Did you hear that?

229
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,625
[ELFMAN] Yeah, it
sounded like Lucy!

230
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:24,166
[MIDNIGHT]
What happened to me?

231
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,708
[MIDNIGHT]
The Tower of Heaven?

232
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:28,875
No!

233
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,000
This is it!

234
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:33,375
[MIDNIGHT] This is
the Real Nightmare!

235
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,375
[MIDNIGHT]
How did this happen?

236
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,166
It must've been the girl!

237
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,500
My seal is
all that's left.

238
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,458
It's not strong enough
to hold her back!

239
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,958
[MIDNIGHT] I'm such a fool!

240
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,833
[NATSU] I heard you, Lucy!

241
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,000
[COCO] How'd he come back?

242
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,041
[HAPPY] Lucy did it!

243
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,333
She used
the Infinity Clock

244
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,666
to cast the Real Nightmare
spell on that creep!

245
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,541
[NATSU] So, You
made a sacrifice?

246
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:57,916
Gimme a break!

247
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,791
[MIDNIGHT] As they say,
magic comes from the heart.

248
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,208
And the greater the feelings

249
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,333
that you're willing to abandon,

250
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,458
the greater
the power you'll gain!

251
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,833
[KLODOA] I don't like
the looks of this!

252
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,500
Those two are about
to throw down!

253
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,541
[KLODOA] Now, now,
there's no need

254
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,791
to resort to violence!

255
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,166
The girl's taken control
of the Infinity Castle,

256
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,166
so as far as I'm concerned,
you guys win.  See ya!

257
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,208
[ROMEO] He's runnin'.

258
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,000
[ELFMAN] And you
call yourself a man?

259
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,583
[ROMEO] No, he's a stick.

260
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:19,750
[MIDNIGHT] When you
care for someone,

261
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,625
your deepest wish
is to see them again!

262
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,875
[MIDNIGHT] There's nothing
more excruciating

263
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,791
than knowing
you will never have

264
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,833
the chance because
of your own actions!

265
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,166
[NATSU] Whatever you say.

266
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,250
So tell me,
what did you sacrifice

267
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,250
to gain the power
that you have now?

268
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,750
[MIDNIGHT] My future.

269
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,125
At least one in which

270
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,083
I'll ever get
to see my father again.

271
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,666
[COCO] So he
took a possibility

272
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,750
and then made
it an impossibility

273
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,291
in order to gain power?

274
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,541
My head hurts.

275
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:52,458
[HAPPY] A backward view
using forward thinkin'.

276
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:55,166
That's pretty
impressive, huh?

277
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,666
[NATSU] I don't
get it, man.

278
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,916
You're not
makin' any sense.

279
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,541
If you wanna see
your dad so badly,

280
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,375
then why dontcha
just go see him?

281
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,833
[MIDNIGHT] You're the
reason my father and I

282
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,750
were torn apart
all those years ago.

283
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,958
Don't tell me
that you've forgotten.

284
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,458
[NATSU] That's what
you're pissed off about?

285
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:09,458
Don't you dare try to act 

286
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,166
like the innocent
victim, buddy.

287
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,125
You're the scumbag
who made Lucy cry.

288
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,291
[NATSU] So you "sacrificed"
your future.

289
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,916
If you ask me,
givin' up somethin'

290
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,041
that hasn't happened yet
ain't that big a deal.

291
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,083
Quit your whining
and fight me!

292
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,041
[LEVY] Warren!

293
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:26,833
[WARREN] What's up?

294
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,458
[LEVY] I've got news.

295
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,541
We've been double-checking
our notes and, well.

296
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,000
[JEAN-LUC] Now
Listen carefully!

297
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,166
You see, we've actually
discovered something

298
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,125
very important
that we thought

299
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,000
you and the others
should know!

300
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:39,708
[WARREN] Say what?
Run that by me again!

301
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,166
[MIDNIGHT] Impossible!

302
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,875
How am I being overpowered?

303
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:44,791
[NATSU] I know
what it's like

304
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,041
to miss havin'
your dad around,

305
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,041
so I can definitely
sympathize with you.

306
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,208
But you're wrong.

307
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,416
[NATSU] That whole
thing about having

308
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,416
to abandon your feelings

309
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,208
to gain power
is a huge crock.

310
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,250
'Cause you only gain it

311
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,916
by holding 'em
close to your heart.

312
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,750
[MIDNIGHT] Liar!

313
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,291
That can't be true!

314
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,166
I was taught that
sacrifice is the only way!

315
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,791
[NATSU
'Fraid not!

316
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,666
[NATSU] You don't know what
to think anymore, do ya?

317
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,541
You've been twistin'
everything around so much

318
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,958
your perception's
all screwed up now.

319
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:14,041
If you keep it up,
you can't be true to your past!

320
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,916
Much less your future!

321
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,625
[NATSU] You can't even
be true to your own heart!

322
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:22,166
[MIDNIGHT] Are you implying 

323
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:27,041
that I'm not being
true to my father?

324
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,541
[NATSU] Lucy opened
up to her dad

325
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,208
and Michelle
opened up to her.

326
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,208
Don't punish them just
'cause you got it wrong!

327
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,208
[NATSU] You think
you're so smart

328
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,375
but you've got
a lot to learn.

329
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,875
[NATSU] Feelings
are one thing.

330
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:44,041
[NATSU] You obviously
don't know anything about!

331
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,791
[ROMEO] Yeah!

332
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,833
[laughing]

333
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,500
[MIDNIGHT] Father.

334
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,500
[ROMEO] We beat the last
of the Six Demons!

335
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,250
[ELFMAN] How's Lucy?

336
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:02,708
[COCO] Oh, no.

337
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:03,916
[HAPPY] We're too late.

338
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,958
What'll we do now?

339
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,833
[HAPPY] Lucy's
completely disappeared.

340
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,458
[NATSU] How'd that happen?

341
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,583
I mean, we got rid of
all six of the seals!

342
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,166
Where the heck did she go?

343
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,083
We ain't leavin'
'til we get her back!

344
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,166
[LUCY] Huh?

345
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,708
What're they talking about?

346
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,166
I didn't go anywhere,
I'm right here!

347
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,541
[LUCY] Whoa, wait a sec!

348
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,250
Don't tell me that I'm...

349
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,750
You gotta be kiddin' me!

350
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,083
[ELFMAN] What was that?

351
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:31,916
[ROMEO] Is Lucy
here somewhere?

352
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,875
[NATSU] That's weird.

353
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,166
I can smell
her all around us!

354
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,500
[GRAY] Whoa.

355
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,166
That wasn't telepathy.

356
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,625
[ERZA] We can't
give up hope.

357
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,666
Not yet.

358
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,916
[WENDY] Oh no.

359
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,916
We were too late.

360
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,041
[CARLA] Yes, It
appears as though

361
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,833
she's merged with
the Infinity Castle.

362
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:46,708
[HAPPY] Lemme
get this straight,

363
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:47,916
you're sayin'
that Lucy's

364
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,666
turned into this
humongous fish?

365
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,166
[NATSU] So, in a way,
this is her body now, huh?

366
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,041
[LUCY] No!

367
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,500
[LUCY] I can't believe
this is happening to me.

368
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,500
One minute I'm normal 

369
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,375
and the next I'm Happy food?

370
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,125
[HAPPY] Don't worry,
I won't eat ya!

371
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,375
[WARREN] It's gonna be okay!

372
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,166
Unfortunately, you sped
up the merging process

373
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,166
whenever you used the Real
Nightmare spell to save Natsu.

374
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,833
[NATSU] Don't blame
me for this!

375
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,583
[WARREN] Look, I'm just glad 

376
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:13,916
I finally got through to you!

377
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,208
Listen up, everyone!

378
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,291
I've got some news 

379
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,083
from the team back
at the guildhall.

380
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,500
[WARREN] Jean-Luc
and the others

381
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,541
have figured out a way
for us to save Lucy!

382
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,500
[NATSU] Who is Jean-Luc?

383
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,541
[HAPPY] He's the guy who
always says "actually".

384
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,000
[JEAN-LUC] If the
seals aren't removed

385
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,125
from the Infinity Clock

386
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,625
before the merging
process is complete,

387
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:32,166
the person who has been
merged can only be freed

388
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,458
if they focus their mind

389
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,833
and actually control
the Real Nightmare spell.

390
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,041
[LEVY] According to
what it says here,

391
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,750
the clock is
remaining in this world

392
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,583
because of the magic
power it's absorbing

393
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,250
from the Celestial wizards
who are serving as body links.

394
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,708
[WARREN] They're stuck
in chrysalis form,

395
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,208
so we need to lift the curse
that's been placed on 'em.

396
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,666
Luckily, it should
be pretty simple.

397
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,166
[COCO] Lucy's gotta alter
their perception of time

398
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,166
to one hundred years
in the future.

399
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,458
[WARREN] Yep, you got it.

400
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:55,375
If she does that, 

401
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,541
then the clock
will break apart

402
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,958
and all the pieces
will scatter themselves.

403
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,375
[WENDY]
 Are you sure?

404
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,291
[GRAY] Wait.

405
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,833
But what about Lucy?

406
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,833
[ERZA] How is this
going to affect her?

407
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,583
[JEAN-LUC] I wish
I could tell you.

408
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,625
All we know for sure is
this will undo the merging.

409
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:10,916
[ELFMAN] Yeah, but
it could also send her

410
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,125
flyin' along with
the clock pieces!

411
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,375
[ROMEO] What'll we do?

412
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,666
[NATSU] C'mon, there's
gotta be another way!

413
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,375
[LUCY] I'll give it a shot!

414
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,750
[LUCY] The other
Celestial Wizards need me.

415
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,333
If I don't pull it off

416
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,166
they'll sleep
for a hundred years.

417
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,250
[LUCY] So what if I get
sent flying off somewhere?

418
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,125
I think that
it's worth the risk!

419
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,166
I'm not scared

420
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,750
'cause I'm a
Fairy Tail wizard.

421
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,500
Jude and Layla
Heartfilia's daughter.

422
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,875
Lucy... Michelle's
big sister!

423
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,958
I can do this!

424
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,666
[MICHELLE] I believe
in you, Lucy.

425
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,583
[LUCY] This is tough!

426
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:56,750
[MICHELLE] Don't be afraid.

427
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,083
I'll stay right
by your side.

428
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,333
[LUCY] Thank you!

429
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,375
[KINANA] You've
been badly injured.

430
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,625
Is there anything
I can do to help you?

431
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,000
[COBRA] You can get
your dirty hands off of me.

432
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:26,291
[KINANA] So the person calling
out to me, was that you?

433
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,666
[COBRA] I can hear it.

434
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,458
[COBRA] It's you!

435
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,166
[KINANA] Tell me.

436
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:46,125
[KINANA] What
happened to your eye?

437
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,750
[COBRA] I sacrificed
it to gain power.

438
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,500
It's no big deal.

439
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,958
All I need is
my hearing anyway.

440
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,166
[KINANA] What's your name?

441
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,916
[COBRA] It's Erik.

442
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,875
[KINANA] Hello, Erik.

443
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:06,041
[LAHAR] You're Cobra of
the Neo-Oración Seis?

444
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,666
[DORANBOLT] The others
are already in our custody.

445
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,250
We ask that you
surrender peacefully.

446
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,791
[COBRA] And
what if I don't?

447
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:12,625
[KINANA] No, wait!

448
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:13,625
He's not a bad guy.

449
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,083
He's not!

450
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,041
[DORANBOLT] What the?

451
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,000
[LAHAR] Are you
resisting arrest?

452
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,083
[LAHAR] That's odd.

453
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,083
The girl doesn't
appear to be a wizard.

454
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,416
[DORANBOLT] If she's
an accomplice to

455
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,083
the Neo-Oración Seis,

456
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:29,666
we're gonna have
to take her in, too.

457
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,958
[COBRA] Relax, I'm coming.

458
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,291
Get outta here.

459
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,125
[KINANA] What?

460
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,208
Erik.

461
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,125
[KINANA] Wait!

462
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,208
You never answered!

463
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,208
Were you the one
calling out to me?

464
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:42,500
[KINANA] Were you?

465
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,875
[COBRA] I don't know
what you're talking about.

466
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:48,875
[LAHAR] What about the girl?

467
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,041
[DORANBOLT] Is she
an accomplice of yours?

468
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,208
[COBRA] Nope.

469
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,458
I don't know her.

470
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,000
Apparently she's
been wandering around

471
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,041
looking for an
old friend of hers.

472
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:56,916
[LAHAR] Very well then.

473
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,125
Let's go.

474
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,375
[DORANBOLT] You're givin'
up a lot easier

475
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,583
than I thought you would.

476
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,583
[COBRA] Yeah, well.

477
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:02,958
Change of heart.

478
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,333
I envy that girl.

479
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,791
Knowing you have a friend.

480
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,875
[COBRA] It must be
a comforting thing.

481
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,708
Maybe I'll find
one some day.

482
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,291
[KINANA] Erik.

483
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,708
I know that was your
voice calling out to me.

484
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,375
[KINANA] I can't
help but wonder

485
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:24,000
if you could
hear me too.

486
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:27,125
[COBRA] I finally
got to hear it.

487
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,000
The sound of your voice.

488
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,625
[ICHIYA] Man!

489
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,125
I'm glad you're okay!

490
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:43,791
[NATSU] Are we on
top of an octopus?

491
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,125
[ICHIYA] There's
no need to panic.

492
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,750
Kanaloa and I are now bound

493
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,916
by the parfum of
eternal friendship.

494
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,791
[NATSU] So you guys
are buddies now?

495
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,208
[HAPPY] Hey Natsu, listen.

496
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,375
[NATSU] Where's Lucy?

497
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,250
We gotta get out
there and find her!

498
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,541
[ERZA] We're already
working on it.

499
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,250
[GRAY] Yeah, Warren's
team is lookin' for her.

500
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,166
[NATSU] Well, that
ain't good enough!

501
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,958
[sniffing]

502
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,791
[NATSU] Guys,
I've picked up her scent!

503
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:07,916
It's gotta be her.

504
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,708
Take us thataway, octopus!

505
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,583
[ICHIYA] Very well then.

506
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,291
If you would, Kanaloa.

507
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,583
[KLODOA] We were so close 

508
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:15,750
but we still
failed miserably.

509
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:16,791
I should've known better 

510
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,333
than to leave those
Fairy Tail brats

511
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,125
to the "Neo-Oración Seis." 

512
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,583
[KLODOA] I guess I'll just
have to become Brain the Third

513
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,583
and find six more idiots

514
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,083
who are willing
to sacrifice-- Wha?

515
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,041
[BOOK GIRL]
There's no escape.

516
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,083
You, too, shall
sleep for a century.

517
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:46,833
[LUCY] By the time I came to,
both the Infinity Castle

518
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:52,708
and the Neo-Oración Seis
were long gone.

519
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:55,083
[LUCY] And so,
the journey that began

520
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,041
with the hand of a clock

521
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,125
and all of the
confusion and chaos

522
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:01,458
caused by "Key of
the Starry Heavens"

523
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:05,333
finally came to an end.

524
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,500
[LUCY] I'm not sure why, 

525
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,458
but ever since I've
been back in my apartment,

526
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:24,708
it's felt kinda
cold and empty to me.

527
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:28,916
[LUCY] But even so,
I never feel lonely.

528
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,791
[LUCY] Don't worry about me.

529
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:33,458
I'm gonna be okay.

530
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,125
Oh, and one more thing.

531
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,000
[LUCY] Mom.

532
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,333
Dad.

533
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:40,458
Thanks for giving me
such a great little sister.

534
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,791
[NATSU] We did it!

535
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:15,750
We actually defeated
Brain the Second!

536
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:17,375
[HAPPY] And everybody
got to play a part in it!

537
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:18,583
[NATSU] Fairy Tail's
definitely

538
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:19,833
the strongest
guild around!

539
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,208
[HAPPY] I'm not
so sure about that.

540
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:23,166
I heard that while we
were stuck on Tenrou Island,

541
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,166
another guild took our place
as the strongest in Fiore!

542
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:28,583
It sucks but we were
gone for seven years.

543
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:29,416
[NATSU] Another guild?

544
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,125
No way!

545
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,708
Who?

546
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:33,250
[HAPPY] Next time: Sabertooth!
[NATSU] Next time: Sabertooth!

547
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,250
[NATSU] I say we kick their
butts and take our title back!

548
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,541
[HAPPY] Geez, what's with you?

549
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:41,000
I'm startin' to wonder if
fighting is all you think about.
