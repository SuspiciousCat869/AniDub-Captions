1
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,000
No matter what
we're up against,

2
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:22,791
Fairy Heart must remain secret.

3
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:25,166
The world just
isn't ready for it.

4
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,583
We'll need to formulate
our strategy.

5
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:30,833
Everybody, pay close attention.

6
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:34,333
Zeref will invade Ishgar
with his entire army.

7
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,083
I won't sugar coat it.

8
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:39,416
There's no question we are at
an overwhelming disadvantage.

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,416
Our enemy is greater in number

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,500
and far more powerful than
any we've faced before.

11
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:49,250
But due to our courage and
our bond, we will prevail.

12
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,666
Let's show them what
our guild is made of!

13
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,333
[chuckles]

14
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:40,958
[LUCY]
Fairy Heart.

15
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:44,250
A powerful source of
everlasting magic,

16
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,708
with a limitless potential.

17
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,708
[LUCY] Zeref can't resist
its destructive power,

18
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,708
and is launching an invasion
of Ishgar to get it.

19
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,125
We have to make sure
that doesn't happen.

20
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:02,083
We can't let that thing
be used for evil.

21
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:05,250
No. I shouldn't say
it's a "thing."

22
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:08,916
It's the body of our First
Master, Mavis Vermiliion.

23
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,333
Which is even more
reason to keep it safe.

24
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:14,000
Had it not been for
her kind heart,

25
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,958
Fairy Tail would never have
brought us all together.

26
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,625
Who knows where we'd be.

27
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,666
Pretty good stuff there, Lucy!

28
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,916
If you keep it up,

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,875
you could turn into a
real novelist someday.

30
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,375
[LUCY gasps]

31
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,666
"Had it not been for
her kind heart"...

32
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,041
..."Fairy Tail would've never
brought us all together."

33
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,833
[LUCY] There's a difference
between "being together"

34
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,458
and "breaking and entering!"

35
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,291
You should try to
relax a little.

36
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,791
The town is all
empty and boring,

37
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,583
so we decided to come over here.

38
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,291
Well, I'm glad they
were able to evacuate

39
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,333
all the citizens at least.

40
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,958
Cut loose, Lucy! Heh.
Let's have some fun!

41
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,125
Yeah, come on!

42
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,791
We brought a whole
buncha games and stuff!

43
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,500
You know, we're going
into a huge battle

44
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,291
with a terrifying
enemy tomorrow.

45
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,833
I'm not feeling games.

46
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,666
And unlike the two
of you knuckleheads,

47
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,625
I'm really not feeling all that
excited about fighting, either.

48
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,458
Huh?! I'm not "excited"
about the war!

49
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,875
I don't think you understand
somethin' about me.

50
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,833
I mean, I enjoy a good fight,

51
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,458
but only when it's
a competition.

52
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:17,291
I hate it when it involves
death, like this one.

53
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,041
Giving everything
I've got in a fight

54
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,000
to see how much I've
grown is what I live for.

55
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,791
But this time is way different.

56
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:30,291
I'll do anything for us to win,
or else we won't survive this.

57
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,666
Plus, there's somethin' I really
wanna do when it's over.

58
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,916
Aye!

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,958
I know you're dyin' to
hear what it is, Lucy!

60
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,000
[LUCY]
Nope, stop right there!

61
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,416
Don't say a thing.

62
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,625
This is actually a classic
literary technique

63
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,125
we writers call
"foreshadowing."

64
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,208
And what does that mean?

65
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,250
Like when someone talks
about their future plans

66
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,916
right before something big.

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,791
But then a tragedy strikes
and prevents them

68
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,500
from fulfilling their dream.

69
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,250
[NATSU] We're not scared
to talk about the future.

70
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,625
[HAPPY]
Aye.

71
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,708
Igneel himself told me I
should always talk about it.

72
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,916
Because that's what gives us
the strength to make it there!

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That's a nice way to look at it.

74
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,458
[NATSU] All right!
Let's play some games!

75
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,208
[HAPPY]
Who's in for strip poker?

76
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:14,041
[LUCY] Not me, you freaky cat!
Besides, you're already naked!

77
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,833
So do you think it's possible

78
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,833
Jellal and Crime
Sorcière will help?

79
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,333
I do.

80
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:32,416
Since Zeref is the enemy,
I'd say it's almost guaranteed.

81
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,750
That does make me feel
a little bit better.

82
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,416
Although, most of that
crew were the ones

83
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,041
who destroyed Cait Shelter.

84
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,875
Well, they've changed!

85
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,625
[ERZA]
Ah, that reminds me

86
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,500
of the day I first invited
you to join Fairy Tail.

87
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,833
[WENDY]
We're so grateful!

88
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,958
[ERZA] Which also means I was
the one who dragged them

89
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:54,541
into this life filled
with so much fighting.

90
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,041
I'm responsible for them.

91
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,958
I have to keep them
safe best I can.

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,625
[WENDY]
Hey, Erza!

93
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,416
This time I'll protect you
for all you've done for me.

94
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,708
Oh, my!

95
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,291
I have loved watching you
grow into who you are.

96
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,250
Everyone in the guild
is so very proud of you.

97
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,375
[gasps]

98
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:21,833
[giggles]

99
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,375
Are you okay, my love?

100
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,250
[GRAY]
Hm?

101
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm fine. Care for a bite?

102
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:40,333
Wow! My darling Gray is
sharing his food with me?

103
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,250
His lips touched this!

104
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,166
I hope you know
I appreciate you.

105
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,666
[JUVIA gasps]

106
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,416
[GRAY] I can always count on
you to be by my side, right?

107
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,625
[JUVIA] Oh, well, uh,
yes, of course, my love!

108
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,458
If that's what you want!

109
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,458
I'll give you my answer
once the battle is over.

110
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:56,708
[JUVIA]
Huh?

111
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,791
[GRAY] But for now,
let me focus on this.

112
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,416
Sure.

113
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,875
I'm gonna take down Zeref.

114
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,750
With my secret weapon!

115
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:10,083
Natsu's not the only one of us
who's got a trick up his sleeve.

116
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,750
So Zeref... E.N.D...

117
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,166
...we're coming for both of you.

118
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,250
[MAKAROV] Has your scanner
picked up anything yet, Warren?

119
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:30,125
There's been no sign of the
enemy inside of Fiore so far.

120
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,625
That's good to hear,

121
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,250
but are you positive we can
put our trust in that thing?

122
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,875
I built this ultra-high
performance

123
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,291
radar myself, ya know?

124
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:39,125
They're coming. That we know.

125
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,333
But we don't know
from what direction.

126
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,625
Finding out where they plan
to launch their assault

127
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,750
may mean the difference
between life and death.

128
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,750
The most orthodox
strategy would be

129
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,250
creating a diversion
in the north,

130
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,125
with the main force
coming from the south.

131
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,000
First Master!

132
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:58,166
I just checked up on everyone,
before the battle begins.

133
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,791
Our guild, they all seem so
carefree despite the danger.

134
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,291
Their bravery is
quite remarkable.

135
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:07,958
I think I may have a different
read on the situation.

136
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,625
The kids are all
desperately trying

137
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,583
to keep their anxiety at bay,

138
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,416
so they're spending
time with each other

139
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,666
to pool their fortitude and
lift one another's spirits.

140
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,708
That is crucial at
a time like this.

141
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:25,375
But still, I cannot hold them
at fault for their fear tonight.

142
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,708
When a parent is afraid,

143
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,750
that feeling will be shared
with their children.

144
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:35,666
So it's a parent's duty to stand
up in front of their children,

145
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,958
and though they may tremble,

146
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:40,000
plant their feet firmly
into the ground.

147
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,583
You're right!

148
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,333
[ALL gasp]

149
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:56,958
What's that?

150
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,125
[LUCY gasps]

151
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,583
I think something's
happening outside.

152
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,000
Is that fog?

153
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,250
It can't be.

154
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,583
Warren, is your contraption
working properly or not?

155
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,375
Yes, of course it's working!

156
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,041
But I don't know
that this is magic!

157
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,583
[alarm blaring]

158
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,791
How in the hell were we not able
to see them approaching earlier?

159
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,208
All members, prepare for battle!

160
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,750
They're coming from the sky!

161
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:05,458
Approximately 50
full-size aerial cruisers!

162
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,333
There's way too many of 'em!

163
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,041
Just one of those
suckers is big enough

164
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,208
to wipe out the whole guild!

165
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,791
[MAKAROV]
This is but a tiny fraction

166
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,916
of the empire's full forces.

167
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,208
No one ever said anything
about an aerial attack!

168
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,875
[laughs]

169
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,375
Listen up, 'cause I've travelled
halfway around the world

170
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,750
to do one thing!

171
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,000
And that's to pulverize all
of you into fairy dust!

172
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,416
Ring the bell
immediately! It's time!

173
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,708
They're coming from the west
with 50 aerial cruisers!

174
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,000
They're here now!

175
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,375
Already?

176
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:57,208
I don't think I'm ready
for this fight, you guys!

177
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,458
Fire!

178
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,166
What?

179
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,750
Enchantment activated!

180
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,166
Ah.

181
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,750
They've conjured up some
kind of magic barrier.

182
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,041
I'll have to punch through it.

183
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:33,458
So what now?

184
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,000
Fried's spells are powerful,

185
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:38,583
but I'm not sure how long he
can hold back this onslaught.

186
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,250
You can't give up now, Fried!

187
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,333
I'll lend you some of my
magic power if you need it!

188
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,041
This attack is
absolutely nothing

189
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,500
like we were anticipating.

190
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,125
How do we fight back?

191
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,458
Stay calm.

192
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,958
I thought it unlikely,
but I had considered this.

193
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,166
At the moment,

194
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,666
what we're dealing with
is an advance squad,

195
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,708
and as luck would have it,

196
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,416
this is a much
smaller-scale attack

197
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,833
than I'd originally feared.

198
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:05,500
Uh...

199
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,500
Ahh...

200
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,708
Now! I need you to
relay this message:

201
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:13,000
"Start Strategy D! Flying
Dragons and Ospreys!

202
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,458
Commence the attack!"

203
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,916
Got it!

204
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,458
This is Osprey reporting
from the Eastern Woods.

205
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,750
Target is currently
too far out of range.

206
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,958
Why is Mommy calling
herself "Osprey"?

207
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,083
Beats me.

208
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:30,625
Bisca, I have complete
faith in you.

209
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,041
Yes, ma'am.

210
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,541
So how do ya like that?

211
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,083
[laughs]

212
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,916
A few more rounds
and that shield's gone!

213
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,958
[CREWMAN A] Ajeel, sir!
Something's coming up quickly!

214
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Now what do we have here?

215
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,458
[CREWMAN B] That one's moving
towards us really fast!

216
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,333
[CREWMAN C]
Evasive maneuvers!

217
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,208
[CREWMAN D] Ship number
four has been destroyed!

218
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,375
The hell?

219
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:59,375
Say hi to the Flying
Dragon squad!

220
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,208
It's that guy again.

221
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,750
Now let's rock!

222
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,041
Right!

223
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,458
[CREWMAN E]
A tornado? Uh!

224
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,875
[AJEEL]
Blow 'em outta the sky!

225
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:16,708
[HAPPY]
Whoa!

226
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,291
[NATSU]
Nice moves, Happy!

227
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,916
Curses! There's too
much enemy fire!

228
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,791
Bisca needs to get shooting!

229
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:27,166
[BISCA] This is Osprey unit!
Magic power charged and ready!

230
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,000
Go, Mommy! I know
you can do it!

231
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,083
[ALZACK]
Asca! Get back!

232
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,708
It takes 15 minutes
to charge a shot,

233
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,708
so I gotta make this one count.

234
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:37,708
You're good!

235
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,958
Don't worry, you
got this, honey!

236
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,875
You know what an osprey is?

237
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:45,333
A bird that never
loses its prey.

238
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,500
Focused magic cannon Jupiter.

239
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,750
Fire!

240
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,041
Wasn't that Phantom Lord's?
When did we get it?

241
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,625
Don't know. Let's hope it works.

242
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,500
[AJEEL]
Nice try, ya losers!

243
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,500
He broke up the blast!

244
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:08,500
Maybe, but it looks like you
still took out a few ships!

245
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,958
[PANTHERLILY] He diffused a
shot from the Jupiter Cannon?

246
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,708
Guess we gotta
fight 'em up close.

247
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,750
I say we start with
the sandy bastard!

248
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,916
You guys really know
how to break stuff.

249
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,750
[ALL groan]

250
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,416
What the hell?!

251
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,875
Oh, no! We forgot
this is a vehicle!

252
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,458
What a huge oversight.

253
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31,166
Hey, Wendy, time to
use your Troia spell!

254
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,541
I'm so sorry, you guys...

255
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:37,250
...but I can't use it if I'm
already feeling pukey, too.

256
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,208
That's no good.

257
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:44,041
This part completely
slipped my mind.

258
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:53,375
[NATSU, GAJEEL, WENDY groaning]

259
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,791
What are you guys gonna do,
throw up on my feet?

260
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,250
Works for me.

261
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,875
We've taken some hits tonight.

262
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,750
I want you to have some
of the ships land

263
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,458
while I deal with these idiots.

264
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,833
[CREWMAN A]
Yes, sir!

265
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,125
Are you really the same
cocky little fire wizard

266
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,500
I fought back in Alvarez?

267
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,041
Because you and
your queasy crew

268
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:18,125
look like a freaki' joke
on your home turf.

269
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:20,750
Whoa!

270
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:24,000
[NATSU, GAJEEL, WENDY screaming]

271
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,250
[CREWMAN F]
The bow has been sliced off!

272
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,291
Listen up!

273
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,375
Happy! Carla! Lily!
Help them out!

274
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,625
[HAPPY laughs]

275
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,875
[CREWMAN yelling]

276
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:41,708
Who do you think you are?

277
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,791
I'm the woman who'll
strike you down.

278
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,458
You'd better beg for mercy.

279
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,083
You're dealing with Titania.

280
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,583
Kneel before the Fairy Queen!

281
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,750
Thanks, Erza.

282
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,833
[CARLA] Several in their
fleet are landing.

283
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,583
We need to deal
with them at once!

284
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,166
You're right.

285
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,750
She's got a way better chance
fighting on a ship than we do.

286
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,833
Yes, she's more equipped
to handle the situation.

287
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:12,833
How am I ever gonna protect her
if she's always protecting me?

288
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,375
Defeating one of the Twelve
will be nearly impossible,

289
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,541
even for a warrior like Erza.

290
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,833
Yet I have faith
in her abilities.

291
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,791
If we can actually drive
back their vanguard,

292
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,625
it'll be a real shot
in the arm for morale!

293
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,666
[EVERGREEN]
What's the problem?

294
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,916
I thought your enchantment
was a perfect defense!

295
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,625
You should realize nothing
in this world is perfect.

296
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,666
He's doin' the best
he possibly can here,

297
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,666
but their firepower
is too brutal!

298
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,666
Thanks to our friends in the
Flying Dragon and Osprey squads,

299
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,916
the enemy forces have
been cut in half.

300
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,166
Gives me a better chance of
maintaining the enchantment.

301
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,916
Mommy, you gotta
hurry up and shoot 'em

302
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,916
before they destroy the town!

303
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,708
She knows, sweetheart, but it
takes a while to get it ready.

304
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,625
[grunts]

305
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,333
I'm gonna blast that
sucker this time.

306
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:12,166
All right, men! Magnolia's
right in front of ya!

307
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,041
Go wipe it off the map for good!

308
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,250
[SOLDIERS yelling]

309
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,583
[SOLDIER A]
But, Captain!

310
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,000
How are we gonna get past
the enemy's enchantment?

311
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:19,833
No clue.

312
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:20,750
[SOLDIER A]
Huh?

313
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,791
[BAKEL laughs]

314
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,166
[KAREEM]
Not a problem.

315
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,416
We have someone to dispel it.

316
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,083
He's arrived, so the
barrier will fall shortly.

317
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,500
To be honest, I feel this
overwhelming show of force


318
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,583
is a tad bit excessive for
such a weak adversary.


319
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,958
But still, I'm duty-bound
to execute the orders


320
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,250
given by my commander.


321
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,583
[laughing]

322
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,166
[sneezes]

323
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,666
Ya know, you've done us a real
favor by landin' on the ground!

324
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,083
So thanks!

325
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,416
Take this!

326
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,791
[SOLDIERS scream]

327
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:56,208
[NATSU]
Fire Dragon Talon!

328
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,750
Ha!

329
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,583
[yells]

330
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,500
[chuckles]

331
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,000
[ERZA]
Heaven's Wheel: Circle Sword!

332
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,875
You think that lame
attack is gonna beat me?

333
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,125
[AJEEL]
Huh?

334
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:28,375
[ERZA]
Black Wing: Moon Flash!

335
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,208
[AJEEL] If you're one of the
strongest in your guild,

336
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:33,000
the rest of 'em must be pitiful!

337
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,875
This has to be a joke,
right? Come on!

338
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:39,791
No one mocks Fairy Tail!
You'll pay for that!

339
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,083
More sand?

340
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,416
Your weakness is
what's mocking it.

341
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,916
[grunting]

342
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,750
[ERZA]
What's happening?

343
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,500
[AJEEL]
You're decaying into dust.

344
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,583
[ERZA] My Requip magic
isn't working! But why?

345
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,958
[ERZA screams]

346
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,458
[gasps]

347
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,833
[EVERGREEN] Fried!
Is there something wrong?

348
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:10,750
There is. A hole's been
opened in the enchantment.

349
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,208
[ALL gasp]

350
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,833
It looks like there's some
kind of breach in the barrier.

351
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,416
And it's a big one!

352
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,500
Does that mean they have someone
who nullifies enchantments?

353
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:28,125
This will prove to be
an easy victory, indeed.

354
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,583
[MAN A]
Impressive work, Wall, sir.

355
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,666
[MAN B]
We'll be done here in no time!

356
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,458
They'll learn the strength
of the Alvarez empire.

357
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,666
One last lesson before dying.

358
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,583
I sense more magic power.

359
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:41,041
Could another member of
the Twelve have arrived?

360
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:45,041
The enemy has entered Magnolia!
Hold them back at all costs!

361
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,666
They broke through
Fried's barrier?

362
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,333
They're near the
girls' dormitory!

363
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,250
[WARREN] Someone needs
to head to the breach

364
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,791
in the enchantment!

365
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,083
Crap. Who's closest?

366
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,416
Uhh, let me see.

367
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,541
Elfman! Lisanna! Mirajane!
Get there, quickly!

368
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,875
I need to go and back them up.

369
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:14,333
[LUCY] Aquarius, please.
Lend me your strength,

370
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,500
[banging]

371
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:16,833
[gasps]

372
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,750
[LUCY]
What was that sound?

373
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,166
Something's in here.

374
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,250
[splashing]

375
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,708
[LUCY]
Is it coming from the bathroom?

376
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,666
Looks like I was
right after all.

377
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,083
I knew this was your place.

378
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,208
[MARIN]
Gets an A-plus from me!

379
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,500
[LUCY]
What in the world?

380
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,291
I knew the Spriggan Twelve
were coming to Ishgar,

381
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,666
but I wasn't expecting one
of them in my bathtub!

382
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,291
I don't know why,

383
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,833
but you have been
running through my mind

384
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,791
ever since we met.

385
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,625
[alarm blaring]

386
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:01,708
[WARREN gasps]

387
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,125
More bad news!

388
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,666
Now there's another member
of the Twelve in Magnolia!

389
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,875
Another one?

390
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,458
Three of those
monsters in one group?

391
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,541
How are we gonna fight
back against that?

392
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,958
[WARREN]
No! This can't be happening!

393
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,750
[DROY]
Uh-oh. What is it now?

394
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,875
[WARREN] A massive force
of over 300 ships

395
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,375
is coming in from the north!

396
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,250
And judging from the
magic power signature,

397
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,500
it has another three
of the Twelve!

398
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,583
[gasps]

399
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,125
[WARREN]
But it's worse than that!

400
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:30,000
There's an identical group
coming from the south as well!

401
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,458
And this one has
another three of them!

402
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,750
They're making an
approach on three sides?

403
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,500
[WARREN]
No.

404
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:39,791
There's also a million soldiers
that are marching from the east,

405
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,208
with three more of the Twelve.

406
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,833
We're completely surrounded.

407
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,833
The enemy has left us
with nowhere to run.

408
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,708
[gasps]

409
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,750
How are they coming
from the east?

410
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,500
They musta cut through
Bosco to pull that off!

411
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,041
It's like they're throwing
everything they have

412
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,458
at us all at once!

413
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:00,416
This is the worst thing
that could happen!

414
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,500
[MAVIS]
No matter how I calculate it...

415
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,041
...we have no chance of winning.

416
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,666
[LUCY] Fairy Tail is surrounded
by the enemy on all sides

417
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,166
as the Spriggan Twelve
enter Magnolia.

418
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,958
Brandish is especially close,
and seems personally intrigued,

419
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:49,416
until a certain name
sours the mood.

420
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,500
Meanwhile, out in
the western skies,

421
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:55,041
Erza struggles in the fight
against Ajeel, the Desert King.

422
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:56,708
His deadly sandstorm
envelops her,

423
00:23:56,791 --> 00:24:00,000
threatening to grind her down
into whirling grains herself.

424
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:02,375
Next Time: "Morning Star."

425
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,333
Our perseverance
will be our light

426
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:06,833
that pierces through
the darkness.
