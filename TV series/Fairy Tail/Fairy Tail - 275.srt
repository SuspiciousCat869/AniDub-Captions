00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:25,583
That can't be.

2
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:28,625
You're saying Zera's
just an illusion?

3
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:34,291
No. You're just trying to
play some kinda joke on me!

00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:37,333
She's here! Zera's standing
right in front of us!

00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:41,208
See? Right here.
Holding my hand.

6
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,375
It's only you and I here, Mavis.

7
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:44,791
What?

8
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,916
If you're in on this joke,
Zera, it's not very funny.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You've needed to know.

12
00:00:56,083 --> 00:01:00,708
Seven years ago,
on Tenrou Island... I died.

13
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,791
I know you tried to save me,

14
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,041
but you were the only survivor.

15
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,041
Your feelings were so strong.

16
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,166
The magic energy inside
of you took on the form

17
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,208
of what you needed
most right then.

18
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:49,166
You needed a friend, so you
subconsciously created one.

19
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,541
Zera.

20
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,000
[ZERA]
Now when you create an illusion,

21
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,541
you're conscious of it.

22
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:56,750
You want others to see it and
react to whatever it may be,

23
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,750
but that wasn't the
case that night.

24
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:01,166
That's why no one
else can see me.

25
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,750
But look.

26
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,666
Since you're finally beginning
to think of me as an illusion,

27
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,708
I'm becoming more like one.

28
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,291
That's not true!

29
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,833
I would never think of you as
an illusion 'cause you're real!

30

31

move on with your life.

[ZERA] Keeping this

I don't know.

Didn't your mom and dad tell
you something about them?

58
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,333
They said if I have faith
and keep searching,

I'll be sure to
find one someday.

Well then, that's what
I believe, too.

And I know you're not the kind
of person to give up her dream.

You really think I'll find one?

63

You will. Someday.

That's great! And I know
you'll be right there with me.

Yeah, sure.

No. I don't want this.

But it only worked
the first time

because you weren't aware of it.

He told me only Mavis could
perceive her,

124
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,166
because she came from
her subconscious mind.

Do you think that voice
we just heard was Zera?

Maybe if Mavis finally
realized what she was,

But now, I have Zera.

everything she's done for me.

What?

140
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,333
Zera asked you to look after her

141
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,375
and you're already
slackin' on the job?

142
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,916
That whole thing was
pretty heavy emotionally,

143
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,500
so I figured she'd
need some time alone

Guess that makes sense.

It's gotta be painful.
She was real to Mavis.

They spent all those
years alone together,

and then all of a sudden
she had to say goodbye.

Mavis told me that she wants
to go and look for fairies.

00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:05,375
It sounds crazy. And I have
no clue where to look.

00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,666
[MAN D] Magnolia will be even
better than it was before!

161
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,166
It'll be awesome!

162
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,625
[MAN E] Everyone that that had
to run can come back home!

163
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,333
[BOY A]
I'm sorry!

164
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,250
[BOY B]
Thanks, Mom and Dad!

165
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,541
[GIRL A]
Yummy!

166
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,416
Well, Zera. What now?

167
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,625
What kind of adventure will I go
on in my next chapter of life?

168
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,916
Maybe I should try being a
treasure hunter with the boys

169
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
for a little while.

170
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,541
That could be exciting.

171
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:17,916
Or should I go home?

172
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,916
I could spend some more time
back on Tenrou Island

173
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,833
and see where I go from there.

174
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,750
I guess.... I just
gotta think about it.

175
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,541
I'm not exactly sure
that treasure hunting

176
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,875
is the perfect life for me.

177
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,333
[MAKO]
Miss Mavis!

178
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,291
Here's to the free
city of Magnolia!

179
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,625
[TOWNSPEOPLE]
Hear, hear!

180
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,458
[TOWNSPEOPLE laughing]

181
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,666
Do you want some bread?
We made it just for you!

182
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,291
You've done so
much for our city,

183
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,750
the least we can do
is make you dinner.

184
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,000
I just saw an opportunity
to help the people here

185
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,583
get things started is all.

186
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,750
And then you guys
took over from there.

187
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,083
You drove Blue
Skull out of town.

188
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,250
Come on!

189
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,666
If it wasn't for you
and your friends,

190
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,750
we'd still be under
Blue Skull's thumb.

191
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,375
You brought life
back to the city

192
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,250
and we're eternally
grateful for it!

193
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,791
I wish your friends
were here now,

194
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,166
so we could thank
them personally.

195
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,791
But still,

196
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,666
you can't help but wonder
what's next for Magnolia.

197
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,083
Aw, shut up!

198
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,708
Ya think this is really the time
for more doom and gloom?

199
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,791
Are you worried about
something in particular?

200
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,291
No, no. It's nothing, really.

201
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,750
Don't worry about it.

202
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:30,083
Yeah, we came here to celebrate
our new freedom, right?

203
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,750
Don't get the wrong idea.

204
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,125
Blue Skull being gone is the
best thing that's happened here.

205
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,833
That was long overdue.

206
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,041
I suppose in some way

207
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,625
they had just become
like the devil you know.

208
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:43,833
Now that they're gone,

209
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,833
nobody really knows
what will happen next.

210
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:47,875
We'll be fine.

211
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,708
We'll figure things
out, I'm sure!

212
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,541
Tonight, let's forget
about all our worries!

213
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,083
[MAVIS]
Please excuse me.

214
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,583
I appreciate your hospitality,

215
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:00,291
but there's something
urgent that I need to do!

216
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,208
Don't go. Stay
and finish dinner!

217
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,750
Sorry. Some other time, promise!

218
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,791
Oh, but can I take
the bread with me?

219
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,000
I know it'll be yummy!

220
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,708
[KERSEY]
Uhh...

221
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,041
[MAVIS] I figured it out, Zera!
I know what I'm gonna do next!

222
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,666
Hey, there. It's good
to see ya, Mavis!

223
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,083
[PRECHT, WARROD]
Uhh...

224
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,625
[YURI clears throat]

225
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,000
So I think that's the way we
should greet her. With smiles.

226
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,708
We just wanna be super
cheerful, ya know?

227
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:48,750
Like this?

228
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,750
I'm so happy you're back, Mavis!

229
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:51,875
That's it!

230
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,041
Now hit me with a
million-Jewel smile!

231
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:54,791
[grunts]

232
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,750
[PRECHT]
Okay. Got it.

233
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,625
Hey there, Mavis!
Good to see you!

234
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,458
[YURI] You'll scare the
crap outta her with that!

235
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,583
Here she is! Are you guys ready?

236
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,125
Course I am!

237
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,375
[giggles]

238
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,208
[ALL]
Hey, there! Good to see you!

239
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:20,291
I've got a great idea!
So listen up!

240
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,666
[ALL] You think we should
start our own wizard guild?

241
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,000
Yep!

242
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,625
But, uh, we're already in
a treasure hunter guild.

243
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,000
[PRECHT]
We've dabbled a bit in magic,

244
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,666
but that doesn't quite make
us full-fledged wizards.

245
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,583
I thought you were going off
on an adventure to find fairies.

246
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:39,291
I plan on going on lots
of adventures, but still,

247
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,458
everybody needs a place
they can call home, right?

248
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,041
[MAVIS] That's why I'm
gonna start the guild

249
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,458
right here in Magnolia!

250
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,083
You don't wanna start
it on Tenrou Island?

251
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,583
Well, I did consider
that for a little while.

252
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,375
But then I thought about
all the people here

253
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,166
who'd lived under
Blue Skull for so long.

254
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,958
Their freedom is certainly
cause for celebration,

255
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:06,875
but everyone's anxious about
what will happen next.

256
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:07,958
[PRECHT]
Good point.

257
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,666
Blue Skull was oppressive,

258
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,791
but they did create
some kind of order,

259
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,416
and a certain fragile stability.

260
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,833
They're gone now, but they
left a big power vacuum.

261
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,791
What's gonna take their place
in the future, ya know?

262
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:24,541
Yes, exactly. Guilds are the
heart of cities like this one.

263
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:27,875
They need them to
grow and prosper.

264
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,291
Zera dreamed of
saving this city.

265
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,375
But it doesn't end with
kicking out Blue Skull,

266
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,208
and then going on our merry way.

267
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,416
We want the people here
to love life again.

268
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,291
To smile. To actually feel free.

269
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:43,708
To give them hope that tomorrow
will be better than yesterday.

270
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:47,541
If we put our heads together, we
can make that dream come true.

271
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,625
Since I'm from Tenrou,

272
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:54,458
we can declare the island as
the guild's "sacred ground."

273
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:59,250
Umm. Do you guys wanna join me?

274
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,583
[YURI]
Sounds like an adventure.

275
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,166
[WARROD]
Our own wizard guild.

276
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,333
[PRECHT] Might I suggest we call
ourselves the "Precht Brothers"?

277
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,583
[YURI] Can't believe you said
that with a straight face.

278
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,208
[PRECHT]
I'm being completely serious.

279
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,791
[YURI] Well, that name
seriously sucks.

280
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,000
[MAVIS]
I have a name.

281
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,875
We're going to call ourselves:

282
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,250
The Fairy Tail guild.

283
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,041
[GUYS]
Uh...

284
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,583
Are you sure about that?

285
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,291
That's kinda quirky.

286
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,625
Do you mean like
the tail of a fairy?

287
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:27,875
[PRECHT]
I don't get it.

288
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:31,166
What do Fairies have to
do with the three of us?

289
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,750
Do fairies have tails?
Or not? I don't really know.

290
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,125
More than that,
are fairies even real?

291
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,708
It's an eternal mystery,

292
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:42,583
and trying to find out sounds
like an eternal adventure to me.

293
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,791
Anyway, that's how
I came up with it.

294
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,125
Fairy Tail.

295
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,500
Starting a guild from
zero will be tough.

296
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,291
We have a lotta
work ahead of us.

297
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,791
I know we do.

298
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,166
That's why we need the people
of Magnolia behind us

299
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,708
every step of the way.

300
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,875
We can't do it without them.

301
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,541
So you wanna start a new
wizard guild in Magnolia?

302
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,875
The idea seems okay
in theory, but--

303
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,541
I don't know about all of this.

304
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,041
Word on the street
is that you people

305
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,625
haven't even been
wizards for very long.

306
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,250
Yes, that is true.

307
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,791
But we want to grow
in our abilities

308
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,291
and have the city grow
right along with us.

309
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,083
We don't wanna cause trouble.

310
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,458
All we really want is for
our guild to spread joy

311
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,583
to everybody that lives here.

312
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,583
I truly believe that
if we work together

313
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:28,833
with the people of Magnolia,

314
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,791
there's nothing
we can't achieve.

315
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,125
We can be a beacon of hope
for the whole kingdom.

316
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,625
You can count me in!

317
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,666
If there's anybody that
can make an amazing guild,

318
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,041
it's gotta be you guys!

319
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,125
You're gonna be the
best guild ever!

320
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,833
You have my blessing, Mavis!

321
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,458
I'd be proud to have you here!

322
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,708
This might be good.

323
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,625
And we definitely can't
afford another situation

324
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:47,958
like what happened
with Blue Skull.

325
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,500
We've all seen that you care.

326
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,125
You've already saved
Magnolia once

327
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,666
from the brink of destruction.

328
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,375
Yeah, but if they go overboard
with their magic spells,

329
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,500
they could break a whole
lotta buildings and stuff

330
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,708
all over again.

331
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,083
You'll be careful

332
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,041
and not let things get too
outta hand, won't ya?!

333
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,541
Don't you worry!

334
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,875
We'll make sure that nothing
like that will ever happen!

335
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,458
[KERSEY] Okay. If you
promise, I believe ya.

336
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,791
[CROWD laughing]

337
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,250
[MAVIS] After that, we
petitioned the Magic Council

338
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:16,666
to allow us to establish
a new guild in Magnolia.

339
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,958
We also joined the community
of neighboring guilds

340
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,250
and the regional
guild federation.

341
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,208
The next step was for
Yuri and the others

342
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,083
to officially leave
Sylph Labyrinth

343
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,416
so they could found
Fairy Tail with me.

344
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,500
So if you ever find
yourself in Magnolia,

345
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,250
feel free to drop in and see us.

346
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:34,791
Hey, Sword, Hammer, and
Sniper. See ya later!

347
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,541
Yeah! I totally wish
you guys good luck!

348
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:41,666
Maybe we'll get a chance to work
together some day. Ya dig?

349
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,875
Don't get too far outta range!

350
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:44,750
[SWORD sighs]

351
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,166
[SWORD]
Well, there they go.

352
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,208
And I totally couldn't be
happier to see them leave.

353
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,625
[HAMMER]
Mh-hm.

354
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,166
No matter what those
guys are doing,

355
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,416
they just can't seem
to stay outta trouble.

356
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,375
When I heard they were
takin' on Blue Skull,

357
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,375
I really thought it was
game over for 'em.

358
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,041
[HAMMER]
Mh-hm!

359
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,291
[SWORD]
Hm.

360
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,875
All right, fellas,
if you think those losers

361
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,375
are gonna start an awesome guild
and totally not regret the day

362
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,166
they left Sylph Labyrinth,
raise your hand!

363
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,833
[SYLPH LABYRINTH chattering]

364
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,041
If you think they're gonna
totally screw it up,

365
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,125
raise your hand!

366
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:15,291
[SYLPH LABYRINTH cheers]

367
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,458
Still, if I know
those three guys,

368
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,000
no matter what might
happen to 'em,

369
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:22,541
they'll totally have
fun wherever they go.

370
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,333
[MAVIS] Time went on,
then one day...

371
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:29,708
[MAVIS] Hey, Warrod!
Get over here, will ya? Hurry!

372
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,333
Hey. There he is!

373
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,333
[PRECHT]
He does like to take his time.

374
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,708
You were off
day-dreamin,' weren'tcha?

375
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,958
Take a look. There's
one dream come true.

376
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,875
Whoa. Amazing.

377
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,625
It's our very own guild.

378
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,000
[YURI]
Sure is.

379
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:53,000
[MAVIS] Let's take a picture
so we never forget this!

380
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,541
The day that Fairy
Tail was born!

381
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,208
So, Master, somethin'
you'd like to say?

382
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,333
Uh, did you say "Master"?

383
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,958
Well, startin' the guild
was your idea, wasn't it?

384
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,833
I don't really have much
to say about fairies.

385
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:06,916
Okay.

386
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,166
[clears throat]

387
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,583
My wish is for this
guild to be a family

388
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,708
that loves and cherishes
each one of our members.

389
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:17,750
And I believe that "comrade"
is more than just a word.

390
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,958
A comrade lives in your heart.

391
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,958
Is someone you can
trust unconditionally.

392
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,666
I want you to feel like
you can rely on me.

393
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,125
Because one day, I'll need you.

394
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,750
And our trust in each
other will see us through.

395
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:33,541
Whenever you're suffering,
whenever you're sad,

396
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,250
I'll be there to make
sure you remember

397
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,250
that you never have
to face it alone.

398
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:41,833
We have as many hopes and dreams
as there are stars in the sky.

399
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,583
If we walk toward
the future together,

400
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,291
I know we'll reach them.

401
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,291
Now, let us move forward.

402
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,750
Forever in tune with
the song of the fairies.

403
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,250
[GEOFFREY]
Fairy Tail, hmm?

404
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,125
In that case, I'll have to
start a new guild of my own

405
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,833
to exact my revenge.

406
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:07,458
A guild of dark souls.
And I will be the Phantom Lord.

407
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:08,875
[MAVIS]
Zera.

408
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,583
When I look into the future,

409
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,291
I see many people gathering
around this guild.

410
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,958
Together, as a family.

411
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,833
And they all have
a place to return to

412
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,458
on this eternal adventure.

413
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,625
I know in my heart that someday,

414
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,375
my dream for Fairy
Tail will come true.

415
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:27,125
[NARRATOR] On that bright
April day in the year 686,

416
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,833
the Fairy Tail guild
is officially founded.

417
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,500
Its first master
is Mavis Vermillion.

418
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:36,583
In July of that same year, the
bloody Second Trade War begins.

419
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:40,875
In February, 688, Fairy Tail
and Fiore's other Wizard guilds

420
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,208
intervene in the war.

421
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,875
Mavis's expertise in strategy
earns her the name

422
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,333
"Fairy Tactician"
throughout the kingdom.

423
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,625
Two years later, in May of 690,

424
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,166
Yuri Dreyar finds
a girl he treasures

425
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,833
and the pair is soon married.

426
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,041
Shortly after that,

427
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,625
the Second Trade War
finally comes to an end

428
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,916
and the Inter-Guild Conflict
Ban Treaty is established.

429
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,708
In March of 696,
Yuri's son, Makarov, is born.

430
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,958
The next year,
Mavis passes away,

431
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:11,208
and her grave is built on the
sacred ground of Tenrou Island.

432
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,750
Per Mavis' wishes,

433
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:16,666
Precht becomes her successor
and Fairy Tail's second master.

434
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:20,500
Then, in 700, Yuri Dreyar
joins Mavis in the afterlife.

435
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:24,166
731, Precht becomes involved
with black sorcery.

436
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,375
Shortly thereafter, Warrod
Sequen leaves the guild.

437
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:30,625
In 736, Precht leaves
the guild as well

438
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:34,291
and appoints Makarov Dreyar
to be the guild's third master.

439
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:37,666
Much later, in 784, primary
guild members go missing

440
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,458
after Acnologia attacks
Tenrou Island.

441
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,625
Following that loss, in 785,

442
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:45,333
Macao Conbolt becomes
the fourth master.

443
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:49,666
In 791, the Tenrou Team
returns after seven years.

444
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,291
Gildarts Clive becomes
the fifth master.

445
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:55,708
Once again, Makarov Dreyar
becomes the sixth master.

446
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:59,916
He leads the guild to victory
in the Grand Magic Games.

447
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:03,791
Okay! Let our eternal
adventure begin!

448
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,916
[GUYS]
Yeah!

449
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,375
[ZERA chuckles]

450
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:10,708
[ZERA]
Good luck, Fairy Tail!

451
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:18,375
[MAVIS] So this is the story
of Fairy Tail's creation.

452
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:20,791
My dream really did come true.

453
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:23,750
And Fairy Tail became a guild
that's more like a family,

454
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:26,500
where each member is
loved and cherished.

455
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:30,083
Unfortunately, I was wrong about
the guild never causing trouble.

456
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:32,583
They seem to have a hard
time staying out of it.

457
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:35,958
The property damage bills have
been too numerous to count.

458
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:39,375
Sadly, Fairy Tail is
currently disbanded.

459
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,416
But as long as everyone
still has the spirit

460
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,875
that we founded the guild upon,
love, trust, and friendship,

461
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:47,000
and they keep the guild
in their hearts,

462
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:49,041
I have faith that they'll
all find each other

463
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,875
and re-form stronger
than ever before.

464
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:54,166
I believe in you, Fairy Tail!

465
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:57,208
[CROWD cheering]

466
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:58,416
[CHAPATI]
Ladies and gentlemen,

467
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,666
it's going to be a
thrilling day four

468
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,750
of the 792 Grand Magic Games!

469
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:05,875
The first match up of the day
is about to get started,

470
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:09,083
and you do not wanna miss it!

471
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:10,583
[chuckles]

472
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:16,500
[LUCY] It's been a full year
since Fairy Tail was disbanded.

473
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,625
All of our members have
gone our separate ways,

474
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,333
seeking new adventures.

475
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:22,125
I've been working as
an apprentice reporter

476
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,625
for Sorcerer Weekly,

477
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:25,333
and my job is to cover
all the action

478
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,541
in this year's
Grand Magic Games.

479
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,250
Little did I know that
I was about to have

480
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:30,750
a fateful encounter.

481
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:34,000
In 792, the newly rebuilt
royal capital of Crocus

482
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:35,500
burns once again.

483
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,708
Next Time: "Challenger."

484
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:40,958
Unbroken, the emblem
burns even brighter.
