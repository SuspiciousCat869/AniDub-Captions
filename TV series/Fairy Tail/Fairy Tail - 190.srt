1
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,791
[CHAPATI] It's over!

2
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:25,083
The winner of the Grand
Magic Games is Fairy Tail!

3
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:35,958
[ALL cheering]

4
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,916
Man, that sound
is incredible.

5
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,791
We can hear it
all the way from here.

6
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:15,958
This is awesome.

7
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,708
If they start cheering
any louder for us

8
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,666
I think the ground'll
start shaking.

9
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,791
Geez, would somebody
shut 'em up?

10
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,625
This noise is makin'
my wounds itch.

11
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,041
Now don't be like that.

12
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,875
They're cheers of celebration.

13
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:29,708
I'll bet you the master's
beside himself with excitement.

14
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:30,750
Auh.

15
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,541
Puttin' the old geezer aside.

16
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,583
This makes up for
seven years of humiliation

17
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,416
our guild mates endured.

18
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,625
My darling Gray.
We just have to go

19
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:41,166
on a victory date, okay?
Take me out!

20
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,250
You mean right now?

21
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,708
[LECTOR sobbing]

22
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,625
[CROWD cheering]

23
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,208
Just listen to this
crowd roaring its approval!

24
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,541
The mightiest guild
in Fiore, Fairy Tail,

25
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,375
is back with a vengeance!

26
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,500
Congratulations Maky.

27
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:01,208
[MATO] Oh wow!
They finished the final battle

28
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:04,791
without losing anyone! Huh?

29
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,500
[CHAPATI] Fairy Tail
has clawed its way from

30
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:09,500
a last-place start
to a first place upset!

31
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,500
[CHAPATI] And don't forget,
the upstart guild was

32
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,708
originally split into
two separate competing teams!

33
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:17,916
[YAJIMA] Even without the
participation of Natsu Dragneel,

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,250
an amazing sense of
solidarity allowed Fairy Tail

35
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,916
to triumph in the end.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,458
[CHAPATI] I certainly agree!

37
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,708
Tell us, Mato,
what are your thoughts?

38
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:30,333
[MATO] Me? Well, yeah,
they really put on a show!

39
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,875
[FROSCH] Fairy Tail
is super cool, huh?

40
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,083
[ROGUE] Yeah. Heh.

41
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,291
I know we just lost,
but I feel happier now

42
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,125
than I ever have before.

43
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,083
That's good, Rogue.

44
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,250
Hey, Frosch. Listen.

45
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,416
[FROSCH] Yeah?

46
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,000
I want to change
and become the kind of man

47
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,125
who treasures his friends.

48
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,166
[FROSCH]
That's how I feel, too!

49
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,541
[HAPPY] The One
Who Closes the Gate!

50
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,458
[YAJIMA] This year's
games had too many

51
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,083
impressive battles to count!

52
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:08,291
[CHAPATI] Which fight did you
find most memorable, Mato?

53
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,750
Uh...

54
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,666
[YAJIMA] He's gone. Well,
maybe he had to take a leak.

55
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,208
[CHAPATI] Oh. Uh.
Well in that case,

56
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,375
what was your favorite
bout, Mr. Yajima?

57
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,625
[YAJIMA] Mirajane and
Jenny's sexy pose-off!

58
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,416
I haven't felt
that young in years.

59
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,875
[CHAPATI]
Well, this is awkward.

60
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,291
[GAJEEL] Guess it's over.

61
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,083
All that's left
is the celebration!

62
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,958
Hey Erza,
how's that leg?

63
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,416
It should be good as
new in a few days.

64
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,916
[LAXUS] Can't believe I'm sayin'
this, but, it's kinda strange

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,291
not havin'
"you-know-who" around,

66
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,333
hollerin', and makin' noise.

67
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:36,583
[GRAY] Yeah, I don't mind it.

68
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,625
[GAJEEL] He'd be extra
annoying after all that.

69
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,708
[ERZA chuckles]
Sounds about right.

70
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,208
By the way, did anyone see
their signal flare?

71
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,125
Nope. And I've been
keeping an eye out for it

72
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,041
this entire time,
well, except for when

73
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,791
Jura knocked me flat.

74
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,166
I didn't see one either.

75
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,666
I ain't worried.
Knowin' our Salamander,

76
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,166
he probably just
forgot to shoot the thing.

77
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,541
Signal flare?

78
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,208
[LECTOR] Whadaya think
they're talkin' about?

79
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,125
Tell me somethin'.

80
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,458
[GAJEEL grunts]

81
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:05,125
Oh, I know you ain't
talkin' to me, punk. Scram!

82
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,583
Calm down!

83
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:07,583
[STING] Sorry, but--

84
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,458
[GAJEEL and JUVIA] Huh?

85
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:12,875
Where's Natsu? Why wasn't
he in the fight today?

86
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,833
What's the deal?
Is Natsu hurt?

87
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,791
Is he gonna be okay?

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,583
[GRAY]
We're countin' on you guys.

89
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,916
You'd better
make it out of there.

90
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:30,625
Fire Dragon Roar!

91
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,583
Gravity zone!

92
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,833
It'll take a lot more than that

93
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,875
if you wanna
haul in this catch!

94
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,333
--Aah!
--Ya ok?

95
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,458
I am way too
hungry for this!

96
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:42,083
Paper Blizzard.
Purple Dance!

97
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,750
[LUCY] This again?
C'mon I'm getting bored here!

98
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,916
Okay then,
let's spice things up.

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,625
How about I start
by shredding your clothes?

100
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,333
Hey, wait a sec.
Let's not get crazy!

101
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,750
[yells]

102
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,083
I'm very sorry
about that, Princess,

103
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,625
but I felt I had to intervene
to preserve your dignity.

104
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,375
That was way too close.

105
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,750
Now die! Ugly brute!

106
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:09,750
Wow, the rage in your eyes
is utterly intoxicating.

107
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,541
Whaddya say we ditch
this fight and go get

108
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,375
a bite to eat
somewhere romantic?

109
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,125
Ugh. I asked you to die.

110
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:19,041
Why don't you
dissolve? Sploosh!

111
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,500
Please let us pass.
We've gotta find our friends!

112
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,750
[laughs] Sorry, no can do!

113
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,291
You and me are
gonna be hangin' out

114
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,458
for the rest
of your short life.

115
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,958
Your time is up!
Surrender now!

116
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,791
Just let us pass through!

117
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,125
[KAMA] Never! Not a single
one of you will escape.

118
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,000
Can you at least hear us out?

119
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,041
I am a peacekeeper of Fiore.

120
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,375
Those who threaten
the peace must die!

121
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,833
We aren't
threatening anything!

122
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,041
We're trying to help
Fiore and time is short.

123
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,416
[PANTHERLILY] Why do you
refuse to understand that?

124
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,958
A criminal will say
anything to escape justice.

125
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,750
[KAMA]
Your words are meaningless!

126
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,041
Oh, no. This is bad!

127
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,500
We can't let them
trap us in here like this.

128
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,041
If we don't do something
soon it'll be too late.

129
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,541
It'll happen again!

130
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,750
Oh Lucy,
are you feeling okay?

131
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,541
[FUTURE LUCY]
We're running out of time.

132
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,666
[CARLA] This future Lucy
said that in her time,

133
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,250
we were in the castle
when the disaster happened.

134
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,875
We've escaped
our prison, but...

135
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,500
...even if we
aren't behind bars,

136
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,625
we're still
trapped in the castle.

137
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,041
So we're in
just as much danger.

138
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,000
[MALE SOLDIER 190A]
Go men! Show them no mercy!

139
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,083
[MALE SOLDIER 190B]
Surround them!

140
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,833
[LOKE] More reinforcements?

141
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,583
We need to wrap this thing up!

142
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,083
Stay still for a sec.

143
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,083
And I will end
your miserable life.

144
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,041
A group of men are here
to punish us, Princess.

145
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,583
[LUCY] Yeah, I can see that!

146
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,625
Oh, no. My battle form!

147
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:44,416
Look at that. Now it'll be
easier to execute you!

148
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,791
[PANTHERLILY laughs nervously]

149
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,416
Err! You want an execution?
Well I'll give ya one!

150
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,583
[NATSU] I'll burn every
single one'a'ya to a crisp!

151
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,166
[MALE SOLDIER 190A] Steady men!

152
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,208
Hm?

153
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,166
What is it?
Did you see something?

154
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,291
 Thought so.
Must've been my imagination.

155
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,625
Happy! Carla!

156
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,583
Get outta here and
find the rest of the guild!

157
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,083
[PANTHERLILY] Tell them
what's happened to us!

158
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,583
Aye, Sir!

159
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:09,541
We're on it!

160
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,041
[BOTH yell]

161
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,333
[UOSUKE] Nuh-uh!
Y'all gotta stay put, ya hear?

162
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,083
[HAPPY]
It's that weird guy again!

163
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,916
Nobody's gettin' outta
this castle, understand?

164
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,583
Huh?

165
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,583
Hey. Y'all? I'm caught
in someone's net!

166
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:23,958
[MALE SOLDIER 190E]
I can't move a muscle!

167
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,708
[MALE SOLDIER 190F]
Me neither! What's happening?

168
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,208
It's holdin' 'em down!

169
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,666
Is that some
kind of shadow magic?

170
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,041
[MALE SOLDIER 190G yells]

171
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,333
[MALE SOLDIER 190H]
What in the hell is going on?

172
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,750
[MALE SOLDIER 190I]
I dunno but it's bad!

173
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,541
What the heck?

174
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,625
[SOLDIERS yelling]

175
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,083
What's happening?

176
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,083
That shadow is
swallowing our men!

177
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,416
Yeah. Is it a spell?

178
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,166
[gasps]

179
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,125
[SOLDIERS scream]

180
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,958
Neppa? This shadow is
haulin' me in!

181
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,833
We'll pull through,
just hang on!

182
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,833
[UOSUKE yells]

183
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,666
Why is this happening to us?

184
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,541
Please! Help!

185
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,791
Hold on! I'll save you!

186
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,041
No! This cannot be!

187
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,583
We, the Hungry Wolf Knights,
bested by a shadow?

188
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:17,500
How? Princess, I've failed you!

189
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,333
That... shadow.

190
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,875
[FUTURE LUCY] I've never
seen anything like it.

191
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,750
It didn't happen like this!

192
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,208
What's the heck's
goin' on here?

193
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:32,250
[JELLAL] I've got it!
Everything makes sense now.

194
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,416
[ULTEAR] What do you mean?

195
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,083
All of this time,
and the truth has been

196
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,541
right under our noses.

197
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,083
What is it, Jellal?

198
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:42,083
This Lucy from the future said
she arrived on July fourth.

199
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:45,416
But it was actually just
before midnight on the third.

200
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,083
Then she can't be
the source of the power

201
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,666
we've been sensing for years.

202
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,958
She only got here
a few days ago.

203
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,833
[JELLAL] Agreed. The taint
of Zeref we've sensed

204
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,541
for the past seven years
came from the Eclipse.

205
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,708
There's no doubt in my mind.

206
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,791
But this is different.
It's a person.

207
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,375
Because the Eclipse is a
product of the Book of Zeref,

208
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,625
its use comes with a price.

209
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:10,375
[JELLAL] All those who use it
bear the trace of his power.

210
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,625
Zeref.

211
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:16,000
[ULTEAR] The indomitable
wizard of darkness.

212
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,666
You guys are freaking me out.

213
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,375
I'm just as uneasy.
But right now we have to

214
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,833
put our focus elsewhere.

215
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,708
There's simply
too much at stake.

216
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,416
[MELDY] Right.

217
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,541
[JELLAL] If we assume that
this future Lucy has been

218
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,541
completely honest with us,

219
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,708
then she came into
our time on the third,

220
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,000
just before midnight.

221
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,708
If that's true,

222
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,875
then who did I see
earlier that evening?

223
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,666
Uh.

224
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,125
[DARTON] Hm?

225
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,208
Princess.

226
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,583
[HISUI gasps]

227
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,833
Arcadios, it's you!
I'm so glad you're all right!

228
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,916
[grunts] Colonel.

229
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,458
[DARTON] Please forgive
me for throwing you

230
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,166
into the Palace of Perdition.

231
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,541
It was a misunderstanding
on my part.

232
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,916
[ARCADIOS] You did
as you thought right,

233
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,125
I hold no grudge. The men
you have assembled here.

234
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,708
Have you already
informed them of

235
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,041
the Eclipse's
secondary purpose?

236
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,166
[HISUI] I have.
The rest of the garrison

237
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,833
is being informed of
the plan as we speak.

238
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,833
Hopefully that means
word will soon reach

239
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,208
the Hungry Wolf Knights as well.

240
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,000
The time traveler's
prediction about

241
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,416
the end of the games.
It came true.

242
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,791
We've no choice.
We'll switch to Eclipse Two.

243
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,416
It's our only chance
against what's coming.

244
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,958
Princess, am I to
understand that

245
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,375
you've abandoned our original
plan to go back in time

246
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,833
and defeat Zeref?

247
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,375
No, but right now
we have to focus on

248
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,458
the more imminent threat.

249
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,833
[HISUI gasps]

250
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,958
Colonel!

251
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,375
Huh?

252
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,541
A true knight must always
trust his master's words.

253
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,291
This is part of the code
I've sworn to live by.

254
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,625
I am duty-bound
to put my faith in you.

255
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:03,583
Which is why, I ask you
to slay me, Princess.

256
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,041
Huh?

257
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,875
[ARCADIOS] Since I cannot
repress the doubt within me,

258
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,291
there is but one recourse.

259
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:13,041
I must die.
For I've dishonored you.

260
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,750
[DARTON]
Arcadios! Have you gone mad?

261
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:16,791
[ARCADIOS grunts]

262
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,750
[DARTON gasps]

263
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,541
[ARCADIOS] Princess. There is
something I must ask you.

264
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:25,083
What is it, Arcadios?
What happened?

265
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,833
[HISUI]
What are you talking about?

266
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,416
[ARCADIOS] I have spoken
with your contact

267
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,041
that came from the future.

268
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,375
That person clearly has
no knowledge of Eclipse Two!

269
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:34,708
[HISUI gasps]

270
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,333
[ARCADIOS] They knew about
the impending apocalypse

271
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,250
but they shed tears
because they did not

272
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,875
know how to stop it!

273
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,750
That can't be.
They're the one who gave me

274
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,666
explicit instructions
on how to activate it.

275
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,541
So, you're claiming that this
person was feigning ignorance?

276
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,041
[ARCADIOS] I don't see
how that's possible.

277
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,416
I cannot think of a single
thing she'd have to gain

278
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,125
by lying to her friends!

279
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,791
[HISUI]
What? Did you say "she"?

280
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,208
The traveler from
the future who advised me.

281
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,291
That person was a man.

282
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,875
[ARCADIOS] Uh!

283
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,375
Whoever I saw on the evening
of the third wasn't her!

284
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,708
She didn't arrive until later!

285
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,708
[JELLAL] Which can
only mean that someone else

286
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,750
has used the Eclipse!

287
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,458
[HAPPY] All of
those royal soldiers.

288
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:20,958
[CARLA] They were
pulled into that shadow!

289
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,958
[PANTHERLILY] But why
didn't it target us?

290
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,625
Someone's inside.

291
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,166
Keep your guard up.

292
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,083
[MAN chuckles]

293
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,583
[MAN chuckles]

294
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:44,250
Okay, and who are you?

295
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,791
[MELDY] You seriously think
there's another person

296
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,208
from the future here?

297
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,208
[JELLAL] Yes, and they should
be easy to find because

298
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:53,916
they'll be swathed in that evil
power from using the Eclipse.

299
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,916
We know Lucy came back
to try and save us.

300
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:02,041
Question is...
why's the other person here?

301
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
[MAN] Shadows can
reach beyond the present

302
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:10,000
to both the past
and the future.

303
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,583
And into the hearts of men.

304
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:15,750
[MAN] It seems we meet again,
Natsu Dragneel.

305
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,416
[NATSU gasps]

306
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,583
I've traveled quite a ways
from the distant future.

307
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,375
I'm Rogue.

308
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:25,083
No way. How can you be Rogue?

309
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,541
The same one from Sabertooth?

310
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,916
[scoffs]

311
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,375
You came from the future too?

312
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,541
So I'm not the only one.

313
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,208
Why're you here?

314
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,958
[ARCADIOS] There are two who
have come from the future.

315
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,958
One of them is Lucy.

316
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,958
She came back in time
to warn her friends

317
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,791
of the impending doom.

318
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,000
And then there's another,
who came to tell the Princess

319
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,166
how to avert that disaster.

320
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,416
Both had the same
objective at heart.

321
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,041
They did what they could
to try and save the kingdom.

322
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,458
It's their only chance.

323
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,166
And if the future's
as bad as they say,

324
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,750
there could still be more.

[ARCADIOS gasps]

326
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,083
[HISUI] Take back your sword.

327
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,416
You'll need it
for the battle ahead.

328
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,833
I'm going to open the Eclipse.

329
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,000
I intend to save this kingdom.

330
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,458
That means drawing
a blade of my own.

331
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,375
The second time traveler.

332
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,500
What could be their goal?

333
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,000
[JELLAL] We have to hurry!

334
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,916
[LOKE] You took out
all of the royal soldiers.

335
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,333
Are you tryin' to help us?

336
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,833
[NATSU] You seem pretty
different than you were before.

337
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,166
[FUTURE LUCY huffs]

338
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,208
So why did you come back?
Just what do you want?

339
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:48,291
All I want...
is to use the Eclipse.

340
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,125
But what's that gonna do?

341
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,458
It can save us all,

342
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:54,250
if we tap into
its hidden power.

343
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,666
[FUTURE ROGUE] As you know,
it can be used for time travel.

344
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,541
But it can also
serve as an offensive weapon

345
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,541
known as the Eclipse Cannon.

346
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,666
That is the only chance
you have of defeating

347
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,916
the ten thousand dragons.

348
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,041
So then it's really possible.

349
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,500
We can win.

350
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,750
Well that sure makes
things nice and simple!

351
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,333
Glad we gotcha on our side.

352
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,250
Aw yeah! Let's go and
kill ourselves some dragons!

353
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,500
Does this mean
everything's gonna be okay?

354
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,041
'Fraid not. You see,
I've come from seven years

355
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,375
in the future.

356
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,583
A time when the
world as you know it

357
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,041
will have ceased to exist.

358
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,125
[FUTURE ROGUE] The dragons
will have destroyed everything

359
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,750
and rule over the ashes.

360
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,416
They're gonna take over?

361
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,833
But, what happened to the
people who survived the attack?

362
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:40,583
In my time not even ten percent
of the human race remains.

363
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,125
Furthermore...

364
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,958
[FUTURE ROGUE] Our Eclipse has
but a fraction of the power

365
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,000
that yours can wield.

366
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,416
Which means that this is
humanity's last chance.

367
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
We stop them now or die.

368
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,166
Seems pretty simple,
all we gotta do is

369
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,375
open the gate, and blow 'em up!

370
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,916
[NATSU] Let's get to it!

371
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,958
[FUTURE ROGUE] Seven years in
my past something happened.

372
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,791
Someone prevented
Eclipse Two from activating.

373
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,458
But how come?
Why would they do that?

374
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,500
[FUTURE ROGUE] Because of
that one person's actions,

375
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,458
the gate remained shut.

376
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,583
And humanity was left
defenseless against

377
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,125
ten thousand raging dragons.

378
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:18,416
[FUTURE ROGUE] This person let
ninety percent of humanity die.

379
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,583
So I've come back
to save those lives,

380
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,541
by eradicating theirs.

381
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,166
[CARLA] How barbaric!
Why don't you try explaining

382
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,125
the situation to them
before you resort to violence?

383
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,583
[PANTHERLILY] She's right.
There's no need for bloodshed.

384
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,041
A person's destiny is immutable.

385
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:36,291
Even if I did
persuade them somehow,

386
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,916
[FUTURE ROGUE] they would
still end up stopping Eclipse.

387
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,833
Fate has stolen
that choice from them.

388
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,041
Their future is set in stone.

389
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,958
They don't have a choice?

390
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,083
[FUTURE ROGUE] None of us
are stronger than fate.

391
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:52,000
The living remain,
and the dead are gone.

392
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,750
The one who
closed the gate before,

393
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,541
will always do the same.

394
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:59,333
As long as they're alive,
it's bound to happen again.

[NATSU] I don't have a clue what
you're talkin' about, buddy.

you're after anyway?

I didn't do it.
I didn't close the gate.

00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,333
I would never do that!

you protect yourself?

[FUTURE LUCY]
You're part of my past.

416
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:38,291
If you were to die,
then I would die too.

417
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:42,375
In a way, dying is
the only way I can live.

418
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,166
It's so strange.
I never thought that

419
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,625
I'd die in my
own arms, you know?

420
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,708
It's kind of comforting.

421
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,625
No, don't talk like that.
You're gonna make it.

422
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,833
We won't let you die!

423
00:19:56,916 --> 00:20:00,041
Can't we help? We could
use healing magic.

424
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,291
I'm afraid that
wound's too severe.

425
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,208
[CARLA]
There's nothing we can do.

426

[FUTURE LUCY]
Don't cry. It's okay.

427
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:08,791
I thought that
I'd never get to see

428
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:12,750
my friends again.
But I did, one last time.

429
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,125
And that's enough...

430
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,708
to make up for the hell
that I've been through.

431
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,583
Oh, Lucy. Please,
just try to hang in there,

I'm from a different time.

There's no reason
for you to cry.

Please. Protect the future.

How could she have forgotten
that she closed the gate?

457
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,500
I don't care about your gate!

458

I would never shut it
but you still--

How could you?

that now, but you will.

I know you will do it again.

shut the damn gate!

Cut it out! I haven't
done anything to you!

465
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,291
The gate will be closed.

466
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,250
There's no way to prevent it.

[FUTURE ROGUE]
Not while you're still alive.

that she did no such thing.

473
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:33,916
[NATSU] I ain't lettin'
anybody steal Lucy's future.

474
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,333
Not while I'm alive!

475
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:39,833
[FUTURE LUCY]
Please. Protect the future.

476
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:41,875
I will, I promise!

477
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,208
[HAPPY] Hey Natsu,
are you seein' this?

478
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:15,625
It looks like
there's a ton of wizards

479
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:17,166
grouped up in the city square!

480
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,250
[NATSU] Oh yeah. Apparently
a bunch of the guilds

481
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,666
decided to hook up and
go kick some dragon butt!

482
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,125
[HAPPY] Good luck, everybody!

483
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:25,000
[NATSU] Whaddya say we leave
'em to those guys for now,

484
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:27,250
'lil buddy? We've got
other butts to kick!

485
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:28,541
Like this guy's!

486
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,291
[HAPPY] Let's do it!
We made a promise to Lucy

487
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:31,875
and we're not gonna break it!

488
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:34,833
[NATSU and HAPPY] Next time:
Natsu versus Rogue!

489
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:36,458
[NATSU] We will
protect the future!

490
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,000
You just watch us, Lucy.

491
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:41,166
[HAPPY] Yeah, there's no way
future Rogue gettin' past us!
