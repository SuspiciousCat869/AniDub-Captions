00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,708
- WE MAY SHARE A FACE
AND SHARE A VOICE,

2
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:28,291
BUT DO WE SHARE THE
SAME SKILLS IN BATTLE?

3
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:31,250
- I WAS WONDERING THAT MYSELF.
DO WE MEASURE UP?

4
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:34,916
- THEN WE SHOULD FIND OUT.
I THINK I KNOW THE ANSWER.

- Happy: PROFESSOR HAPPY'S
CLASS ABOUT FAIRY TAIL.

29
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:19,000
SO TODAY'S LECTURE
IS ABOUT EDOLAS,

30
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,625
WHICH HAPPENS TO BE
WHERE CARLA AND I COME FROM.

31
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,041
WE'VE LIVED OUR WHOLE LIVES
IN EARTH LAND,

32
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,833
WHICH IS FULL OF MAGIC, WIZARDS
AND COOL STUFF LIKE THAT.

33
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:29,333
BUT IN EDOLAS, EVERYBODY IS
SUPER SCARED OF RUNNING OUT

34
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,208
OF MAGIC POWER FOREVER.

35
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,875
IT'S SO BAD THAT THEIR KING
FAUST HAS CREATED A SPELL

36
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,666
CALLED ANIMA THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO SUCK MAGIC OUT OF OUR WORLD

37
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,625
INTO THEIRS,
BUT WHEN HE USED IT,

38
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:41,666
IT TURNED ALMOST EVERYONE
IN FAIRY TAIL INTO A LACRIMA,

39
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,416
AND NOW THE REST OF US HAVE TO
GO INTO EDOLAS TO SOMEHOW TRY

40
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,125
AND TURN THEM BACK TO NORMAL.

41
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,000
ANOTHER THING IS THERE'S
A WEIRD VERSION OF EVERYONE

42
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,708
FROM EARTH LAND LIVING THERE.

43
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:53,208
A WEIRD NATSU, GRAY, LUCY
AND THE ERZA HERE IS REALLY MEAN

44
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,958
AND CRAZY STRONG.

45
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,958
WELL, THAT'S REALLY ABOUT
AS MUCH AS I KNOW FOR NOW,

46
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,041
SO LET'S GET BACK TO THE SHOW.

47
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,583
STAND.  BOW.  AYE!

48
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:24,125
- WHOA, IT'S HER AGAIN.
- THAT NO-GOOD FALLEN.

49
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:27,000
- AND SHE'S WITH A HUMAN.
- SO GROSS.

50
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,375
THAT THING'S HORRIBLE.
- IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

51
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,791
- OH, THERE'S NO WAY THAT THIS
IS GONNA BE A GOOD THING.

52
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:35,583
- HEY, HUMAN, GO HOME.
- THIS IS WRONG.

53
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,500
- HUMANS DON'T BELONG UP HERE.

54
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,833
- ( clamoring )

55
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,333
- EXTALIA'S IN SERIOUS DANGER.

56
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:46,458
YOU HAVE TO LET US TALK
TO YOUR QUEEN RIGHT AWAY.

57
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,041
- ( Happy speaking )

58
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:03,958
- PLEASE, CLEAR A PATH.
- HEY, IT'S SIR NADI.

59
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,791
- AND JUST IN TIME, TOO.

60
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:09,000
- YOU TWO CANNOT BE HERE.
FALLENS AND HUMANS ARE FORBIDDEN

61
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:12,250
FROM ENTERING EXTALIA
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

62
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,416
- YOU'D BE WISE
TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION.

63
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,708
THE LIVES OF YOUR CITIZENS
ARE HANGING IN THE BALANCE.

64
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,500
- BUT HOW IN THE QUEEN'S NAME
DID YOU ESCAPE 

65
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,375
CAPTAIN NICHIYA AND
THE ROYAL GUARDS?

66
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:24,333
- THEY WERE TURNED INTO
A LACRIMA BY KING FAUST HIMSELF.

67
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,416
- ( gasping )

68
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:32,166
- ( laughing )

69
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,791
- THERE'S NO WAY THAT THOSE
STUPID HUMANS COULD EVER BEAT

70
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,166
THE EXTALIAN ROYAL GUARD.
- RIGHT?

71
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,291
WHAT A LOAD OF KITTY LITTER.
- I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.

72
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:50,541
THE EDOLAS ROYAL ARMY IS
PLANNING TO ATTACK YOU.

73
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,500
- SURE, WHATEVER YOU SAY.

74
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:56,166
- THE QUEEN WILL JUST ZAP
THOSE PESTS AWAY WITH HER MAGIC.

75
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,333
- AHHHH!
- I'M NOT KIDDING.

76
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,666
YOU'RE GONNA GET HURT IF YOU
DON'T EVACUATE RIGHT NOW.

77
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,416
- YOU'RE GONNA GET HURT.  HA!
- WENDY, NO!

78
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,041
- THE QUEEN'S MAGIC
IS SUPER STRONG.

79
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,916
- EXCEEDS NEVER RUN AWAY
FROM A FIGHT.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,791
- ESPECIALLY AGAINST
A STUPID HUMAN.

81
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:15,250
- PLEASE, STOP.

82
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:23,291
- THIS IS WHAT YOU GET, FALLEN!

83
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:26,083
- SHOULD HAVE RUN
WHEN YOU HAD THE CHANCE.

84
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:29,416
- THE QUEEN OF EXTALIA
AIN'T SCARED OF NOBODY.

85
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,291
- HUMANS WILL NEVER BEAT US.

86
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,666
- THE QUEEN WON'T
LET THAT HAPPEN.

87
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,541
- PLEASE!

88
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,541
IF YOU HATE HUMANS SO MUCH, THEN
JUST DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO ME,

89
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,583
BUT PLEASE DON'T HURT CARLA.

90
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:46,083
SHE'S ONE OF YOUR OWN.

91
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,333
JUST LISTEN
TO WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY.

92
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,958
I'M BEGGING YOU.

93
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,583
- SAVE YOURSELF.

94
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:56,583
- ( chanting )
GO AWAY!  GO AWAY...

95
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,291
GO AWAY!  GO AWAY...

96
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:13,708
- WENDY, PLEASE!
JUST LET THEM TAKE ME.

97
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,666
- GAJEEL!

98
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,333
- NORMALLY, THIS SWORD CAN SLICE
THROUGH IRON AS EASILY

99
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,083
AS IT WOULD THROUGH BUTTER.

100
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:38,541
HOW WERE YOU ABLE TO STOP IT
USING ONLY YOUR BARE HANDS?

101
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,583
- THAT'S BECAUSE IRON DRAGON
SCALES AIN'T MADE OUT

102
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,250
OF YOUR EVERYDAY METAL.

103
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,375
NOW YOU TELL ME,
IF YOU'RE ONE OF THEM SUPER CATS

104
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,333
WHY THE HECK ARE YOU FIGHTING
FOR THE OTHER SIDE?

105
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:51,791
- Happy: YEAH, ABOUT THAT.

106
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,416
IF YOU'RE AN EXCEED LIKE I AM,

107
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,708
I BET YOU LOVE FISH.

108
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:00,041
I'LL EVEN GIVE YOU ONE OF MINE.

109
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:05,125
- THAT CHOICE WAS MADE LONG AGO.
- HUH?

110
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,083
- I PUT THAT PLACE BEHIND ME.

111
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:10,625
THAT FOUL KINGDOM OF LIES!

112
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,541
- WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY THAT?

113
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:22,833
- ( laughs ) I'M GUESSING YOU
DIDN'T FIT IN THERE, DID YOU?

114
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,500
I KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT, BROTHER.

115
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,541
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT BY ME.
- HUH?

116
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:47,208
- I'M STILL MAKING YOU MY CAT.
- WHAT?!

117
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,583
- HE SHATTERED
MY BUSTERMARM SWORD.

118
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,375
- ( screaming )

119
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,875
I'M GONNA HAVE TO TEACH YOU I'M
WAY STRONGER THAN YOU, KITTY.

120
00:07:56,958 --> 00:08:00,541
- WHOA!  IT'S LIKE HE GOT HIS
BUTT-KICKIN' SWITCH TURNED ON

121
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,500
OR SOMETHING.

122
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,000
- SALAMANDER
AND THAT LITTLE GIRL

123
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,958
ARE GONNA BE SO JEALOUS OF ME.

124
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,625
- NO.

125
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,208
- IRON DRAGON ROAR!

126
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,500
- ( screaming )

127
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,458
- ( laughing )

128
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,875
- SUPER SCARY METAL
MONSTER FACE.

129
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,666
- YEAH.
NOW THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

130
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,500
- YOU'RE GOOD.

131
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,750
- OKAY, IS IT JUST ME
OR IS GAJEEL GETTING

132
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,250
A LITTLE DISTRACTED HERE?

133
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,416
- ( laughing )

134
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,583
- I TOLD YOU I'M AN ICE MAKER
WIZARD, CHIN BOY.

135
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,916
I CAN MAKE ANYTHING.

136
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,041
- HEY, GRAY.
- WHAT?

137
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:16,291
- YOU CAN'T RUN FROM ME
FOREVER, CAN YOU, JERK?

138
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,958
- I WAS BUSY
TAKING OUT THIS CLOWN.

139
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,750
- ALL RIGHT, YOU CREEP.
GIMME THAT STUPID KEY.

140
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,166
I'M DONE PLAYING WITH YOU.
- THIS WOULD BE A LOT EASIER

141
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,875
IF YOU'D JUST LOOK OVER HERE
FOR A SECOND.

142
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,625
THINGS ARE STARTING
TO GO OUR WAY,

143
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,000
BUT WE'RE NOT TOTALLY OUT
OF THE WOODS JUST YET.

144
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,583
HEY, WHERE'S LUCY?

145
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,791
- OH, HER?
SHE'S KIND OF STUCK RIGHT NOW.

146
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,041
- ( Lucy grunting )
- Gray: WHAT DO YOU MEAN STUCK?

147
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,500
- KEEP TUGGING,
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

148
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,875
- I'M TUGGING AS HARD AS I CAN.

149
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:45,250
- WE GOT IT, MAN.
I KNOW THIS KEY IS GONNA WORK.

150
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:48,541
YOU HEAR ME?  WE CAN SAVE
OUR FRIENDS WITH THIS.

151
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,583
THE KING OF EDOLAS WANTS
TO FIRE THE DRAGON CHAIN CANNON

152
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,625
AT THE FLOATING ISLAND
THE LACRIMA'S ON

153
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,583
SO IT'LL CRASH INTO EXTALIA.

154
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,583
NO GOOD.

155
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,833
BUT IF WE CAN HIT
THE LACRIMA DIRECTLY

156
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:06,458
WITH THE DRAGON SLAYER MAGIC
THAT THE CANNON FIRES,

157
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,708
WE CAN TURN EVERYONE BACK
TO NORMAL.

158
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:12,000
- I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND,
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN TO ME.

159
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,291
- I THINK THE CANNON IS
JUST UP AHEAD OF US.

160
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,291
- ALL RIGHT!  LET'S GET TO IT.

161
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:20,000
- HOLD ON, THERE'S ONE PROBLEM.
- WHAT'S THAT?

162
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,625
- WE CAN'T GET INSIDE
THE CHAMBER

163
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:22,875
WHERE THEY'RE KEEPING IT.

164
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:23,958
- SURE WE CAN.

165
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,125
WE'LL JUST USE OUR MAGIC

166
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,250
TO BLOW OPEN THE DOOR

167
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,250
AND BARGE RIGHT IN.

168
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,125
- THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

169
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,958
SUPPOSEDLY, IT'S MADE FROM SOME
KIND OF WIZARD CANCELLER

170
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,625
ANTI-MAGIC LACRIMA,

171
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:37,250
SO IT'S NOT GONNA BE THAT EASY.

172
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,791
- WELL, I THINK WE SHOULD
GIVE IT A TRY ANYWAY.

173
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,875
- AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK,
THEN WHAT?

174
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,791
- SO I FOUND YOU

175
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,708
AND IT SEEMS THAT
YOU HAVE THE KEY.

176
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,166
- WHOA, IT'S ERZA.

177
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,166
- HANG ON,
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

178
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,916
SHE'S FROM EDOLAS.

179
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,541
NO.

180
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,458
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

181
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,416
OUR ERZA LOST?

182
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,541
- GLAD TO SEE YOU'RE UNHARMED,
CAPTAIN KNIGHTWALKER.

183
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,625
- YOU IDIOT.
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY HARMED.

184
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,791
DO YOU NEED ASSISTANCE,
CAPTAIN?

185
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:28,666
- DON'T TROUBLE YOURSELF.
- MAY I ASK WHO THESE MEN ARE?

186
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,750
- KEYS TO THE DRAGON
CHAIN CANNON.

187
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,750
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

188
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:37,041
- HIS MAJESTY'S INSIDE?
- OF COURSE, CAPTAIN.

189
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,583
- WE'RE VERY CLOSE, MEN.

190
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:49,000
EVERLASTING POWER
IS WITHIN REACH.

191
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,708
- JEEZ, WHAT'S
WITH THE HOLDUP?  COME ON.

192
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,541
- Gray: YOU DO IT, MAN.
SHE LIKES YOU BETTER.

193
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,833
- Natsu: YEAH, I GUESS.
- HMM?

194
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,416
- SO WHAT EXACTLY
ARE WE DOING OUT IN

195
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,041
THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE LIKE THIS?

196
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:17,125
I'M JUST CURIOUS.
- WAITING FOR SOMEONE.

197
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,875
- WAITING FOR WHO?

198
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,500
- SO DO YOU HAVE SOME KIND
OF PLAN IN THE WORKS?

199
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:23,625
- MAYBE, BUT IF I WANNA
CONVINCE THE OTHERS,

200
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,625
I GOTTA GET ALL
THE CREDIBLE INFO I CAN.

201
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,666
- CONVINCE THEM OF WHAT?

202
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,166
- THIS IS NOT GONNA BE GOOD,
IS IT?

203
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,666
- SO WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH EVERYBODY ELSE?

204
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,458
- WELL, AFTER HEARING YOU GOT
SOME KIND OF PLAN YOU WANNA TALK

205
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,833
TO 'EM ABOUT,
THEY'RE PRETTY ANTSY.

206
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,541
- NO DUH.
I MEAN, EVER SINCE

207
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,125
- YOU MET THOSE PEOPLE
FROM THE OTHER WORLD,

208
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,208
YOU'VE BEEN EVEN MORE
IRRITABLE THAN NORMAL.

209
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,916
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.
IT'S TOTALLY SCARYVILLE.

210
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,291
- YOU BETTER TAKE BACK
THOSE COMMENTS

211
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,000
IF YOU WANNA STAY ALIVE!

212
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:50,416
- Both: WE'RE REALLY SORRY.
- DON'T HARMONIZE.

213
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,500
- I'VE HEARD YOU'VE SUCCESSFULLY
RETRIEVED THE KEY.

214
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,833
IS THIS TRUE?
- NOT ENTIRELY YOUR MAJESTY.

215
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:17,375
IT WAS DESTROYED.
- EXPLAIN YOURSELF.

216
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,333
THIS ONE CAN FABRICATE
A WORKING COPY.

217
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,333
- NO WAY.
- AND WHO IS THIS?

218
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,916
- HE'S AN EARTH LAND WIZARD,
SIR,

219
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,500
AND A COMRADE
OF THE DRAGON SLAYERS.

220
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,333
- IS THAT SO?

221
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:32,250
IS HE CONNECTED TO THE LACRIMA
THAT VANISHED FROM THE PLAZA?

222
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,541
- HE IS INDEED.

223
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,875
- FREE HIM NOW

224
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,583
AND HAVE HIM PRODUCE
THIS KEY IMMEDIATELY.

225
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,000
- GET UP, EARTH LAND WIZARD,

226
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,000
AND DON'T DO ANYTHING RASH.

227
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:52,500
YOU WILL ACTIVATE
THE DRAGON CHAIN CANNON.

228
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,791
- SO THIS IS IT, HUH?

229
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,750
IT'S NOT QUITE WHAT I IMAGINED
IT WOULD LOOK LIKE.

230
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:06,458
THIS IS GONNA BE WAY MORE
COMPLICATED THAN I THOUGHT.

231
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,625
- QUIT STALLING.

232
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,000
- I GOT NO OTHER CHOICE.

233
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,708
- THAT'S CRAZY.

234
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:25,291
- IS THAT EARTH LAND POWER?
- DOES HE HAVE TO BE SHIRTLESS?

235
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:28,458
- BACK OFF.  I'M NOT SOME
KIND OF CIRCUS FREAK.

236
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,000
THIS IS GONNA BE
MY ONLY CHANCE.

237
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:52,791
I'VE GOTTA SCORE A DIRECT HIT
ON THE LACRIMA WITH THIS THING.

238
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:57,375
'CAUSE IF I DON'T, IT'S OVER
FOR MY FAIRY TAIL PALS,

239
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,250
NOT TO MENTION ALL
THOSE OTHER FOLKS.

240
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:09,708
- YES, THIS IS A GLORIOUS DAY
FOR OUR KINGDOM.

241
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:12,208
( laughing )

242
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,375
- ( loud rumbling )

243
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,958
- ( clamoring )

244
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,625
- WHOA!
EVERYTHING'S MOVING.

245
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,041
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
- THIS IS NOT GOOD.

246
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,791
THEY'RE FIRING UP
THE DRAGON CHAIN CANNON.

247
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,416
- YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF
LIKE THE GILDARTS SHIFT.

248
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,666
IS THIS BECAUSE OF SOME
DESTRUCTIVE MORON, TOO?

249
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,291
- THE KING DESIGNED IT.

250
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:04,208
- HOW DO I AIM THIS THING?

251
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:09,750
- ( laughing )
- WHERE'S THE CONTROLS?

252
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,458
- HAVE THEY STARTED UP
THE CANNON ALREADY?

253
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,708
I WAS FOOLISHLY HOPING
THAT I WAS GONNA HAVE

254
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,458
A LITTLE MORE TIME THAN THIS.

255
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:33,875
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE I DON'T,
SO I'D BETTER HURRY.

256
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,875
- PREPARE TO FIRE!

257
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,041
- NO!

258
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,750
- NOW'S OUR TIME.  NATSU!

259
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,250
- I'M HERE.

260
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,458
- WHAT?

261
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:53,250
- FIRE DRAGON WING ATTACK.

262
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,750
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

263
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:01,125
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?

264
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,958
- ( laughs )

265
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:08,000
- I'M CALLING OFF THE LAUNCH.
- YOU TRAITOR!  HOW DARE YOU?

266
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,958
- THIS IS TREASON.
- IS SHE CRAZY?

267
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:17,291
- YOU ARE PLAYING
WITH FIRE, ERZA.

268
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,583
- MY NAME IS ERZA SCARLET.

269
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,000
I'M AN EARTH LAND WIZARD.

270
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,125
- NICE JOB.
IT GOT PRETTY HAIRY THERE,

271
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,625
BUT THANKS TO YOU, WE'RE GONNA
BE ABLE TO SAVE 'EM AFTER ALL.

272
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,500
- THEY ACTUALLY FELL FOR IT.
GOOD OLD PLAN "D."

273
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,583
DECEIVE THE ROYAL ARMY DUMMIES.

274
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:44,083
- I WANT YOU TO AIM THE CANNON
DIRECTLY AT THE LACRIMA.

275
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:47,208
- AND I WANT YOU TO FIRE IT NOW
AT THE ORIGINAL TARGET.

276
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,583
- NOW WHAT?
- WHAT DO WE DO?

277
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,750
- THAT'S A LOW MOVE,
TAKING HOSTAGES LIKE THIS.

278
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,416
- WE DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK.

279
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,291
- BECAUSE WE'LL DO WHATEVER
WE HAVE TO

280
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,125
IF IT'LL TURN
OUR FRIENDS BACK TO NORMAL.

281
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,500
- WE'RE WASTING TOO MUCH TIME.
- WHAT'S OUR ORDER?

282
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,625
- WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR KING.
- FIRE IT NOW.

283
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,750
FORGET ABOUT SAVING ME
AND ELIMINATE THE EXCEEDS.

284
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:12,125
- Soldier: CHANGE THE TARGET.
AIM FOR THE GIANT LACRIMA.

285
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,916
- Faust: YOU COWARDS.

286
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,666
YOU'RE THROWING AWAY OUR CHANCES
FOR EVERLASTING MAGIC POWER.

287
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,916
- SCARLET!

288
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,000
- IT'S CAPTAIN KNIGHTWALKER.

289
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,125
- Soldier:
HIS MAJESTY IS FREE.

290
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:41,666
- Soldier #2: NOW RESET
TO THE ORIGINAL TARGET.

291
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,416
- AW, CRAP.

292
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,625
- I THOUGHT I WAS THROUGH
WITH YOU, KNIGHTWALKER.

293
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:56,625
- I DON'T GIVE UP SO EASILY.
NOW PREPARE TO FALL.

294
00:18:56,708 --> 00:19:00,250
- FIRE! ( laughing )

295
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,541
- WHAT WAS THAT?

296
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,916
- THE DRAGON CHAIN CANNON
ATTACHING.

297
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
- THEY DIDN'T MAKE IT IN TIME.

298
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:16,125
- HE'S RIGHT.

299
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,750
THERE'S SOMETHING BIG STUCK
TO IT.

300
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:23,875
I DON'T LIKE THE LOOKS OF THIS.

301
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,375
- ATTACHMENT COMPLETE.

302
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,125
- NOW SMASH IT INTO
THE EXCEEDS' KINGDOM AT ONCE.

303
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,833
- WE CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN.

304
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,333
- HEY, YOU GUYS!

305
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,500
GET ON ITS BACK.
- Erza: LUCY!

306
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,083
- Gray: IS THAT YOU?
- Natsu: HOLY COW!

307
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,375
THEY TURNED YOU INTO A MONSTER?

308
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,333
- QUIT BEING RIDICULOUS
AND GET ON RIGHT NOW.

309
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:55,041
- IT'S A LEGION.
- WHAT'S IT DOING HERE?

310
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:58,208
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?  HOW IS
SHE IN CONTROL OF A LEGION?

311
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:02,041
- IT'S BECAUSE THIS ONE IS MINE.
- COCO.

312
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,791
- ARE WE GONNA BE ABLE TO STOP
IT WITH THIS THING?

313
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,291
- WE'LL NEVER KNOW UNTIL WE TRY.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

314
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:10,250
- ( soldiers screaming )

315
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:16,250
- DON'T LET 'EM GET AWAY.

316
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,666
- SCARLET!

317
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,916
DON'T JUST STAND THERE.

318
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,958
PREPARE THE SECOND MAGIC
WARFARE UNIT LEGION PLATOON.

319
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:39,375
- Soldiers: YES, MA'AM.
- I WILL BE GOING AS WELL.

320
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:43,125
PREPARE TO DEPLOY
THE DORMA ANIM.

321
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,208
- Soldier:
BUT THAT'S A FORBIDDEN SPELL.

322
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,333
- Soldier #2: ARTICLE 23 OF
THE ROYAL CHARTER SAYS IT'S NOT

323
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,666
TO BE USED
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

324
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,125
- THAT IS AN ORDER!

325
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,375
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
IS THIS THING MOVING?

326
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,916
- IT IS.  ACCORDING
TO OUR MILITARY'S PLAN.

327
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,541
WE'LL SMASH IT INTO EXTALIA,
ELIMINATE THAT KINGDOM,

328
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:20,416
AND HARVEST UNLIMITED
MAGIC POWER. ( laughs )

329
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,500
- YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME
THAT'S COMPLETELY INSANE.

330
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:25,916
- BUT WHY?

331
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,583
WHY WOULD YOUR PEOPLE EVER WANNA

332
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:31,916
DO SOMETHING SO HORRIBLE?

333
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,875
- ( shouts ) LET'S GO.

334
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,416

335
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,875
- ( singing in Japanese )

336
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:14,291
- Natsu:
WE GOTTA STOP THAT THING.

337
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,916
WHETHER THEY'RE FAIRY TAIL
MEMBERS, EXCEEDS OR WHATEVER,

338
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,708
WE CAN'T LET ANYBODY ELSE DIE.
- Happy: AYE, SIR.

339
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,291
- SO LET'S ROCK!

340
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,041
- HEY DID I TELL YOU ABOUT
THAT SUPER YUMMY FISH

341
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,583
I FOUND THAT ONE TIME? 

342
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:25,916
WE SHOULD GO AND CATCH
ANOTHER ONE SOON.

343
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,708
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

344
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:30,500
- IT WAS ON THAT TRIP WE TOOK
TO THE MOUNTAINS, REMEMBER?

345
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:33,625
- ( Natsu and Happy speaking )

346
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,958
- YOU THINK WE REALLY NEED TO BE
TALKING ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW?

347
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,958
NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT, RIGHT?

348
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:40,791
- WRONG.  THIS IS A HORRIBLE
TIME TO BRING IT UP.
