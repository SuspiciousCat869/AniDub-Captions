160
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,833
I dunno, but she's
got a big syringe!

161
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,375
Identify yourself at once.

162
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:30,083
There are twelve zodiac spirits
and you aren't one of them.

163
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,750
If you can't be quiet
in your ignorance,

164
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,375
I'll give you a hemiglossectomy.

165
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,291
I am Ophiuchus
the snake charmer:

166
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,000
thirteenth spirit of the zodiac.

167
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,125
Welcome to Ophiuchus'
Study Corner:

168
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,958
the cure to your confusion!

169
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,750
Here we have
the celestial plane

170
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,125
as it's viewed from Earthland.

171
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,583
The sun is centered of course,
and all around it,

172
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:55,541
we see the twelve primary
constellations of the zodiac.

173
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,791
But, upon
closer inspection...

174
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,666
Right here, between
the constellation

175
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,291
of the Scorpion and the Archer,

176
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,500
we find the sign of
the Snake Charmer.

177
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,750
It's a fairly tight fit between
those two, but I make it work.

178
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,083
Incidentally, the sign
of the snake charmer has

179
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,125
a distinctly medical focus.

180
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,291
Between the nurse
outfit and the syringes,

181
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,000
I feel like I could've guessed.

182
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,625
So that's how it works.
I thought you celestial spirits

183
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,375
had something to
do with sky stuff!

184
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,375
But you didn't know
for sure until now?

185
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,375
[NATSU] Hey.

186
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,416
If you're a member
of the zodiac,

187
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,125
then I bet you work with Loke.

188
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,500
Correct. I didn't plan
to confront you yet,

189
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,000
but in light of
recent events,

190
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,625
we thought it best to make
some last minute change-ups.

191
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,000
Enough chat. It's time
for me to give each of you

192
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:37,500
an incredibly
thorough examination.

193
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,250
Like, you'll check
our heart-rates?

194
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,916
I'll cut your
hearts to pieces!

195
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,958
[GROUP screams]

196
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,708
Now then, If you could all
just turn your heads and cough.

197
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,125
These things feel super
weird. I don't like it!

198
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,750
[CARLA] Just what kind of
demented examination is this?!

199
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,791
[HAPPY] I think that she's
been breeding stethoscopes

200
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,333
with boa constrictors!

201
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,791
My position as caretaker
of Astral Spiritus

202
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,291
comes with some perks.

203
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,833
One being I can manipulate
every single thing around us.

204
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,000
Forget bedside manner.

205
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,875
I've got stethoscopic
straight-jackets!

206
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,833
I can barely even wiggle!

207
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,000
You got nothing!

208
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,375
I'll burn straight
through these things!

209
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,333
As if I'd allow you to
do something like that.

What a terrible sound!

216
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,750
I'm no nurse,

217
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,041
but I think you might
be doing this wrong!

218
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,208
Nonsense, this is exactly
how you're meant

219
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,625
to use magic stethoscopes.

220
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,500
Trust me.
I'm a nurse.

like to volunteer.

There's no way that thing
will fit in our mouths!

just about anywhere

Shouldn't you be struggling,
or begging for me to stop?

Yeah, but I've never been
to see a dentist before,

00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,291
and I always wanted to
know what it was like.

I never had to go and see one.

A nurse is supposed
to heal people,

are still unknown.

477
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:07,666
I fear that he may be planning
something we've not foreseen.

478
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,458
What do you make
of all this?

479
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:13,208
The last we saw of Leo,
he was fighting Natsu.

480
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,000
Something seemed off, though.

481
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,625
Leo didn't bring
the celestial globe.

482
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,375
So, where did he leave it?

483
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,625
Good question.

484
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,250
He can't have
left it unprotected.

485
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,500
We can only guess.

486
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,500
Wherever Leo's gone,
I bet the globe is near.

487
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,000
I think you're right, Arcadios.

488
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,541
He may be planning
something new.

489
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,291
It's quite possible.

490
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,833
[HISUI] Hmm...

491
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,458
The first to win two out of
a total of three matches

492
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:43,833
shall be declared the victor.

493
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,458
Is this agreeable to you?

494
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,208
[ERZA] Yes, It is.

495
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,833
But before we begin in earnest,

496
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,125
allow me to compliment
your stagecraft.

497
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:56,041
The extra context makes me all
the more determined to win.

498
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,125
[SAGITTARIUS] We are
warriors, the both of us.

499
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:01,333
It's been my experience that a
warrior only fights at his best

500
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:04,416
when taken by
the mood of battle.

501
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,583
[ERZA] Intriguing.

502
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,541
My experience has been the same.

503
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:08,666
Well then.

504
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,708
It seems we're more
alike than I knew.

505
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:11,791
[SAGITTARIUS]
I appreciate that.

506
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,625
If all else is settled,
then tell me:

507
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,500
are you prepared for battle?

508
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,791
[ERZA] A good warrior is
always ready for battle.

509
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,375
A small part of me does wish
we had an audience, though.

510
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:21,833
I considered
bringing one in,

511
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,750
but I don't have the heart
to destroy you so publicly.

512
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:27,125
This is my way of
showing you mercy.

513
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:30,000
Ooh, I hope your sword's
as sharp as your tongue.

514
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,000
Erza Scarlet,
I challenge you!

515
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,750
I accept!

516
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,208
[HAPPY] Hmm.

517
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,583
If we could see his
halves separately...

518
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,083
[NATSU]
What's up, Happy?

519
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:17,541
[HAPPY] I'm trying to figure
out if this Sagittarius guy

520
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:18,916
is a human or a horse.

521
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,291
[NATSU]
He's a human, no doubt!

522
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,916
Horses can't talk, dummy.

523
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,333
[HAPPY] Remember those yucky
winged fish? They talked!

524
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:26,416
They kept on shouting
"I can fly."

525
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,583
[NATSU] Good point.

526
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,208
[HAPPY] And besides,
I am a talking cat.

527
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:30,458
[NATSU] Oh yeah!

528
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:32,416
Crap, now I don't know
which one he is either!

529
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,125
[NATSU and HAPPY]
Next time: Erza vs. Sagittarius!

530
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:36,750
Horseback Showdown!

531
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,416
[HAPPY]
Know what? I say human.

532
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,750
Pretty sure the head decides.

533
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,791
[NATSU] Wait a second.
Why does it matter?
