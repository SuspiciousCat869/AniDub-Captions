1
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:19,375
[WARROD]
There it is!

2
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:21,041
[MAVIS]
This story takes place in a time

3
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,208
before Fairy Tail's existence.

4
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:25,250
A harsher time.

5
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,125
It's about a girl
with a silly dream,

6
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,041
fighting despair and anguish

7
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,708
with nothing but the
heart they stab at.

8
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:34,666
It's a tale of overcoming.
Of chasing hope.

9
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,250
Of friends who formed a guild.

10
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:39,458
Is that the enormous old church
you were telling me about?

11
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,583
[PRECHT] Kardia Cathedral
is one of Fiore's

12
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,625
three largest churches.

13
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,333
The legends say that long ago,

14
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:46,875
the angel known
as St. Mikardia--

15
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:48,791
Hey, look! See that?

16
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:50,625
What the heck?

17
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,416
[PRECHT]
What is that?

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,083
[YURI] It's gotta be
Kardia cathedral, but--

19
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,708
Why's there a
blue-skulled dragon?

20
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,958
What the hell's going on?

21
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,958
[PRECHT] That dragon
skeleton is definitely

22
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,541
not supposed to be there.

23
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:53,166
The town looks
pretty torn up, too.

24
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,500
[YURI]
Yeah, that's an understatement.

25
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,958
[WARROD]
And there's not a soul in sight.

26
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:06,625
I know who is here.
The Blue Skull guild.

27
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,750
You okay?

28
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:50,166
So do we really have to sneak
around like a bunch of thieves?

29
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,125
Well, we did come here to steal.

30
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:55,458
Blue Skull has the Tenrou Orb,
and we're taking it from them.

31
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,708
We can't risk being
seen by anyone.

32
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,583
It could blow the
entire mission.

33
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,958
So we gotta stay hidden
for a just little while.

34
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,875
At least until we
find their base.

35
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,083
Okay, fine.

36
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,750
But we all saw that blue
skeleton on top of the church.

37
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,416
Don't ya think that means
they're probably inside of it?

38
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,916
[PRECHT] That's not enough
information to act upon.

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,500
They might have other
hideouts around here.

40
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:20,500
The Tenrou Orb could be
somewhere else.

41
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,458
We have to be sure.

42
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,083
What do you think, Mavis?

43
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,291
Uh. Where did she go?

44
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,958
[PRECHT]
Despite her history,

45
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,416
it seems she's not
the kind to wait.

46
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:40,625
[rustling]

47
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,041
[BOTH gasp]

48
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:53,458
Oh. Ha. They nearly
scared me to death.

49
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:59,625
The natural energy of
this place feels good.

50
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:00,791
[ZERA]
Mhm.

51
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,458
But still, the city gives
off a really bad vibe.

52
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,583
Like something evil is there.

53
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:10,916
[BOTH gasp]

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,750
Wait! What's wrong?

55
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,916
Hey, guys.

56
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,166
Do you think that she's found
Blue Skull's hideout already?

57
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,250
Come on, you've gotta
check this out!

58
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,875
Hush! We're trying to
be sneaky, remember?

59
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,375
Isn't it amazing?

60
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:38,916
What?

61
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,291
I must be missing something here

62
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:43,125
because all I see is a
giant puddle of water.

63
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,541
You don't see how
beautiful it is?

64
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,416
There is something
about this place.

65
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,458
The way the trees and the water
feel, it's kinda magical.

66
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:06,166
Definitely a peaceful spot,
that's for sure.

67
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,375
Can the rest of you feel
the incredible energy

68
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,500
filling the place?

69
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,958
Huh.

70
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,208
Now that you mention it,

71
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,666
just standing here and
enjoying the scenery

72
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,000
is invigorating
in some weird way.

73
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,416
Yeah!

74
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,000
All right then.

75
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,583
What do you say we set up our
home base right in this spot?

76
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,166
That sounds wonderful!

77
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,000
[ZERA]
Let's do it!

78
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,458

And there she goes again.

Aw, man, why does she
have to be such a pain?

00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,791
What's going on?

00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,791
You see that emblem?

93
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,375
They're from Blue Skull.

94
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,916
Really?

95
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,916
It ain't as much fun if ya just
stand there, so get movin'!

[MAKO]
Please, listen to me.

97
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,000
If killing is the only
thing that'll satisfy you,

98
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,500
then you can kill me.

99
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:57,916
But I beg you, please
spare my daughter's life!

[MIKO]

101
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,625
Okay, that sounds like
a fair deal to me.

102
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,708
We'll kill you before we
take out the little brat.

00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,208
We've gotta get
out of here, okay?

110
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,791
[MAVIS]
Don't worry. It's safe now.

[BOTH gasp]

[MIKO]
Mommy?

113
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,958
[MAKO]
Wait, how can you say that?

114
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,291
You saw that giant
beast, didn't you?

115
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,541
As a matter of fact,

116
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,541
that "giant beast" was
my very own guardian.

117
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:53,250
Actually, it's just an illusion
I created to scare them.

118
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:57,833
[MIKO]
It's gone.

119
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,791
So are those Blue Skull punks.

120
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,583
And once again, I'm impressed.

121
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:05,083
Her illusions are
extremely life-like.

122
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,625
Here ya go.

123
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,833
My name is Mavis. Are you okay?

124
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,000
Yeah. Thank you.

125
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,000
You saved our lives just now.

126
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,125
I don't know how to repay you.

127
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,916
[YURI] Well, you can start by
sharing some info with us.

128
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,375
About what?

129
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,166
[PRECHT]
The Blue Skull guild.

130
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,333
I'll tell you everything
I know about them.

131
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,000
But they're gonna be back soon.

132
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,291
We need to go somewhere to talk.

133
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,541
Is this your place?

134
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,791
Doesn't look like you're
still in business.

135
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,041
Not anymore.

136
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,583
I know this is probably
hard for you to believe,

137
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,166
but Magnolia was once
a thriving city.

138
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,541
There were always lots
of people out and about.

139
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:08,833
And the streets were lined
with shops and cafes.

140
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,916
Folks from all over
the area would come here

141
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,666
to take in the sights.

142
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,041
During the harvest festival,

143
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,583
there would be thousands
of them here to celebrate.

144
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:20,291
But that Magnolia seems like
a distant memory these days.

145
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,250
The few people that
remain live in fear.

146
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,166
Blue Skull. They caused
all of this, didn't they?

147
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,166
Yeah.

148
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,375
It was so peaceful,

149
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,083
until the day they came
from out of nowhere.

150
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,500
[MAKO]
I'll never forget it.

151
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:40,250
So many people lost
their lives that day.

152
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,958
We were just ordinary folk

153
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,375
with no way to defend
ourselves against them.

154
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:48,416
In a matter of hours, the city
was under their control.

155
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,500
They seized all of the supplies
of food and medicine.

156
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,083
We had nothing after that.

157
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:55,416
And then they levied heavy taxes
that were impossible to pay.

158
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,208
The price for non-payment
was very steep.

159
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,875
If you were lucky,
they might let you live.

160
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,250
But they were ruthless.

161
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,000
Anyone that showed
any sign of resisting

162
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:07,333
was killed as an example,
right before our eyes.

163
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,750
No.

164
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:15,041
Does that mean that they
murdered your husband as well?

165
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,833
[MAKO]
They did.

166
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,458
That's just like us.

167
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,875
I'm so sorry for your loss.

168
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,416
[MIKO] You see?
Daddy made me that bread.

169
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,333
It was special for my birthday!

170
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,041
What? Is that really bread?

171
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,333
Quiet.

172
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,166
That's a super cute present.

173
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,916
Yeah, and it was
super yummy too!

174
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,583
He was really good at
makin' stuff like that!

175
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,041
He would always make
me special bread

176
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:46,000
to give me on my birthdays
in all kinds'a shapes.

177
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,500
He'd make 'em into animals,

178
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,708
and sometimes he'd make 'em
look like trees and flowers.

179
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:55,291
Yum. Hearing about it
is makin' me kinda hungry.

180
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,708
This year, I was gonna
make one for my daddy.

181
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,041
I wanted to give him a really
good one for his birthday,

182
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,875
but he was gone
before I could do it.

183
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,791
[MIKO crying]

184
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:12,166
Blue Skull is even bigger than
they were when they attacked us.

185
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,333
They were a small
force, but strong.

186
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,416
And now there must be
hundreds upon hundreds

187
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,250
of members in the guild.

188
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:21,041
That is quite troubling.

[MAKO]
You're travelers, aren't you?

190
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,458
My advice is to leave

191
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,375
and get as far away from
Magnolia as you can.

192
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,625
[MIKO]

[gasps]

194
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,750
What is it, Miko?

195
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,583
Thank you.

196
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,125
For saving me and Mommy earlier.

197
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,708
So here! I want you
to have this!

198
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:52,708
That's such a cute and
thoughtful thing to do.

199
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,041
Thank you.

200

[giggles]

201
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,375
What do we do?

202
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,083
[PRECHT]
About what?

203
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,666
Don't play dumb with me.

204
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,208
What're we gonna do
about Blue Skull?

205
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:13,708
I don't know. With that many
members, what can we do?

206
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,166
You okay?

207
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,250
[PRECHT] Don't forget,
we're only here to get the orb.

208
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,208
Nothing more.

209
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,958
Yeah, I know.

210
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,916
Well, although I feel bad
for Miko and her mom,

211
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,750
you hit the nail
right on the head.

212
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,708
We just came here to nab
an S-class treasure.

213
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:34,125
Taking down Blue Skull is
definitely not on the agenda.

214
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,083
Yep, you're right about that.

215
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,166
Wait, Seriously?

216
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,041
You're just gonna let all of
these people keep suffering?

217
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,250
We can't do anything
to help them!

218
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,583
I don't understand how anyone

219
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,916
can see what's happening
here and just walk away!

220
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,541
So you're just a bunch of
heartless cowards after all.

221
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,625
We can't just take
on a wizard guild.

222
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,375
Especially not such
a massive one.

223
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,750
Your illusions just
aren't gonna cut it.

224
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,791
We don't have any real way to
fight against magic users.

225
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:04,041
But they need us.

226
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:07,500
[OLD MAN A]
Excuse me, are you travelers?

227
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,500
There's nothing left in
this place but heartache.

228
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,833
Leave if you value your lives.

229
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,375
That's not an option.

230
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,250
We have some things to
do before we can go.

231
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,083
[PRECHT]
Sir, if you don't mind,

232
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,208
we'd like to ask
you some questions.

There're no answers here, sorry.

234
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:29,208
But this once
great city is dying.

235

Is there no hope for it?

236
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:36,125
No, none. Death has
taken hold of this city.

The day Blue Skull arrived
here, we were doomed.

Is there no hope for it?

No, none. Death has
taken hold of this city.

Whoa! What just happened?

It was a magic bullet!

Who would do such a thing?

250

Based on the
attack's trajectory,

it came from up there!

we toasted him, right?

00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,791
[PRECHT]
Quiet, Yuri.

325
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,375
So he's the one in charge.

326
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,125
We're here to take
back what you stole

327
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,333
from Tenrou Island
seven years ago.

328
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:34,666
My people's sacred artifact,
called the Tenrou Orb.

329
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,458
[GEOFFREY]
Hmph.

330
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,208
But if you refuse
to return it...

331
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,875
[GEOFFREY] Please. Tell me
what happens if I refuse.

332
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,916
Then they will attack.

333
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,416
Oh, is that so. Hmm...

334
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,166
[GEOFFREY]
Kill them all.

335
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,666
[WIZARD G]
What? But, Master--

336
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,750
[WIZARD H]
We're completely outnumbered!

337
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,125
Surely we can defeat illusions.

338
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,458
[gasps]

339
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,458
This is bad.

340
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:14,666
She was tryin' to fool us!

341
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,750
All right! Crush 'em, men!

342
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,291
[WIZARDS yelling]

343
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,416
Aw, crap!

344
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,291
[PRECHT]
Fall back!

345
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,125
[WARROD, YURI]
Let's go!

346
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,083
They've got us surrounded!

347
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,083
We're just gonna have
to bust through 'em!

348
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,916
[BOTH yelling]

349
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,000
Hey! Come on!

350
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,083
Zera.

351
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,166
We have to get out
of here. Let's go!

352
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,333
Yeah.

353
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,375
[WIZARDS snickering]

354
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,375
Got a special delivery
just for you!

355
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,166
[gasps]

356
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,000
[screams]

357
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,041
[WIZARDS lauging]

358
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,875
You shouldn't tangle
with wizards.

359
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:09,833
[PRECHT]
Yuri!

360
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:10,958
He got hit!

361
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,750
No.

362
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,041
Let's light this joker up, boys!

363
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,333
Oh, no, Precht!

364
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,666
[WARROD]
Precht! Yuri!

365
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,833
[WARROD]
Damn it!

366
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,666
Blast 'em!

367
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:46,708
You're not killin' anyone else!
Especially not my friends!

368
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,083
Mavis!

369
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,291
Right!

370
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,375
They're gettin' away!

371
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:57,666
What are ya standin'
around for? After 'em!

372
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,083
That's enough.

373
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:05,541
The terror they just experienced
will keep them away for good.

374
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:20,291
[MAVIS] We may've had to turn
tail and run that day,

375
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:24,458
but we were heading straight
towards a new beginning.

376
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:28,250
Little did we know; he was
waiting in that forest.

377
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:31,208
And he would change
our lives forever.

378
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,791
[MAVIS] After a humbling defeat
at the hands of Blue Skull,

379
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:18,833
we sought shelter in the
forest west of Magnolia.

380
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,875
My overconfidence put my
friends' lives at risk.

381
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:25,750
As I reflected on my failure,
I encountered a lone wizard

382
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:28,750
trying to escape
civilization in the woods.

383
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:31,833
This fateful meeting would
change my life forever,

384
00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:35,375
and directly lead to the
founding of Fairy Tail.

385
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:38,541
Next Time: "Conveyer of Magic."

386
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:41,583
Light and darkness
gently intertwine.
