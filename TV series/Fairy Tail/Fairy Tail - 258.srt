1
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:27,375
Hey, Dad.

2
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,958
[NATSU]
Where are you?

3
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,000
Come back! I need you!

4
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:37,041
[LUCY]
On July 7th, in the year 777,

5
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:40,250
Natsu's foster father,
the Fire Dragon King Igneel,

6
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,458
mysteriously disappeared,

7
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:45,666
and Natsu was left all alone.

8
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,500
The young Dragon Slayer
searched everywhere.

9
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,791
Even after he joined
the Fairy Tail guild,

10
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,708
Natsu never gave up
hope that one day,

11
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:56,250
he would reunite with the only
father he had ever known.

12
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,000
But when that time came,

13
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,541
it wasn't the reunion
he had expected.

14
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:34,541
[ZIRCONIS] They granted humans
what would come to be known

15
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,708
as Dragon Slaying magic.

16
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:41,208
And with this new power in hand,
mankind joined the war.

17
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,208
The Dragon Slayers'
immeasurable power

18
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,541
quickly turned the
tide of the war.

19
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,208
We were so overwhelmed
that victory seemed certain

20
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:51,125
for the dragons
on the other side.

21
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,041
But no one predicted
the travesty

22
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,666
that would come to pass.

23
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,791
The Dragon Slayers
became so powerful,

24
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:01,208
they eventually turned
on the very dragons

25
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,250
that had given them
their strength.

26
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,875
It was a massacre.

27
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:09,458
There was one man whose
power was so terrible,

28
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:14,125
he bathed the countryside
in the blood of my kin.

29
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:18,458
The very mention of his
name still scares me.

30
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:21,166
This man slayed
countless dragons

31
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,375
and soaked in their blood.

32
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:28,125
He used his power so often
that his skin turned to scales,

33
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,750
his teeth sharpened into fangs,

34
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:34,583
and he stopped being
human altogether.

35
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,125
That is the fate

36
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:39,833
that awaits all who practice
Dragon Slayer magic.

37
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,208
All the bones you see here

38
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,875
belong to the victims
of that monster.

39
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,000
Despite his human origins,

40
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:51,000
he became the king
of all dragonkind.

41
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,541
And the war that he gave rise to

42
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:58,541
came to be known as
the Dragon King Festival.

43
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,791
His name, was Acnologia.

44
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,416
Once a human being,

45
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,875
now a dragon, cloaked
in wings of darkness.

46
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:16,416
Was he attracted by the
concentration of power?

47
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,625
Or does he know?

48
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,000
Perhaps he comes to find Zeref.

49
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,375
That sound! There's
no mistaking it!

50
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,208
It's Acnologia!

51
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,083

[IGNEEL] I'm sorry, son,
but I never did leave you.

54
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,083
[IGNEEL]
In fact,

55
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:29,583
I've been closer than
you ever could've guessed.

That's him. The King
of the Dragons.

[IGNEEL roaring]

61
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,083
I can't believe it.

62
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,250
Igneel was inside him?

63
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,166
How? Is that possible?

64
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,333
Maybe. Do you have one, Gajeel?

65
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:21,500
Don't really know,
but the pain's gone.

66
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,791
Mine's calming down.
How's yours?

67
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,333
I'm fine. Let's get moving.

68
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:39,166
Where's that guy with
the book? He was right here.

69
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,041
[STING]
He can't be too far.

70
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,333
Wendy. Gracious,
are you all right?

71
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,625
Yeah.

72
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,250
You had us really worried there.

73
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,750
Sorry

74
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,666
Carla, what's happening?

75
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:27,291
[roaring]

76
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:30,041
[CANA] Where did they come
from? Whose side are they on?

77
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:33,041
[VIJEETER] I know the
black one is Acnologia.

78
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,416
But what about the red dragon?

79
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,666
What am I a dragon expert now?

80
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,791
Guys, I'm not sure, but if
I didn't know any better,

81
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,583
I'd think that other dragon
was fighting Acnologia.

82
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,250
Well, Acnologia's
obviously our enemy.

83
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,333
But maybe he's on our side.

84
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,833
And if he wins,
will he turn on us?

85
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,250
We sure could use his help.

86
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,416
Why are they here?

87
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
I can't answer that.

88
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:07,958
Wait a minute.

89
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,583
Do you guys think he's back
to finish what he started?

90
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,333
I highly doubt that's the case.

91
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,500
But if they keep this up,

92
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,375
there won't be any
trace of Magnolia left.

93
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,625
So, why'd they come back now?

94
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,791
And why are there two of them?

95
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:21,916
We're doomed.

96
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,375
Humans don't stand a chance

97
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,958
when faced with the
strength of a dragon.

98
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,541
Who's the dragon
fighting Acnologia?

99
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,875
Where'd he come from?

100
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,708
Flames?

101
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,875
So he's a fire dragon.

102
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,458
Wait, is he?

103
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,875
They must be stopped.

104
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,750
I won't let them get
in the way of our plans.

Tell me what to do,

Your existence is nothing more

than an obstacle I shan't
tolerate any longer.

110

So I've made a slight
change of strategy.

could destroy Magnolia.

165
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,875
It's hard to believe.

166
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,208
So, you killed him?

167
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:35,333
Not at all. Just wait and see.

168
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,833
[ACNOLOGIA roaring]

169
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:41,750
[NATSU]
Uh!

170
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,208
Wait! That fireball did nothing?

171
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,250
Seriously?

172
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,250
How could he've
survived those flames?

173
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,416
He doesn't even have a scratch.

174
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,500
That attack should've
destroyed him.

175
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,375
I'm not sure he can die.

176
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,291
Is he immortal?

177
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,583
So, how do we get rid of
somebody who's immortal?

178
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:04,000
Great question, but
I'm not really sure.

179
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:07,583
Hope for the best. That's
all we can do right now.

180
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,083
I'm fired up now.

00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:21,833
[IGNEEL]
Son...

182
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:22,708
[NATSU]
Huh?

183
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,291
You're a pest.

184
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,000
What do you mean by that?!

185
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,583
You sure have a weird way of
showin' that you missed me!

186
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,041
[IGNEEL]
I've already told you,

187
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:34,083
we'll talk about
everything later.

188
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,541
I've got a job I need you to do.

189
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,750
[NATSU]
What kinda job?

190
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,958
You are in one of those
guilds, aren't you?

191
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:45,291
Well, I'd like to
officially hire you.

192
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,416
[NATSU]
Huh?

193
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,250
[IGNEEL]
Over there.

194
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:57,125
[IGNEEL] Make sure you get
a good look at that guy.

195
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,458
See that book?

196
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,083
That's the Book of E.N.D.

197
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,666
So, what do I do?

198
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,625
I want you to steal that book.

199
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,458
Why do I have to be
the one to do it?

200
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:16,291
[IGNEEL] Because you're
the only one who can, Natsu.

201
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,541
Plus, he's the one
responsible for all of this.

202
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,000
I assumed you wouldn't
need a better reason

203
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:25,041
than that to want to fight him.

204
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,291
He did this?

205
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,625
[IGNEEL]
Now listen,

206
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,375
you are not to open
or destroy that book

under any circumstances.

208
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,041
Just take it, you understand?

209
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,166
How much does it pay?

210
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,458
What?

211
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,958
I work for a guild now!

212
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,583
I don't do these kinda
things for free!

213
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:44,541
[IGNEEL growls]

214
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,166
Very well.

215
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,625
For payment, I will tell you
everything you wish to know.

216
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,500
[chuckles] Sounds
like a deal to me!

217
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,333
[IGNEEL]
Heh. Now get that book.

218
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,250
[NATSU]
You better keep your promise!

219
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,708
Don't even think
about going anywhere.

220
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:06,875
[IGNEEL]
I won't.

221
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,166
You know, I'm gonna
hold you to that.

222
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,583
Now I'm all fired up!

223
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:36,666
Make sure you get a
good look at that guy.

224
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,000
See that book?

225
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,583
That's the Book of E.N.D.

226
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,250
So, what do I do?

227
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:48,083
I want you to steal that book.

228
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,583
Why do I have to be
the one to do it?

229
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:54,625
Now listen, you are not to
open or destroy that book

230

under any circumstances.

231
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,125
Just take it, you understand?

232
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:02,041
[chuckles] Sounds
like a deal to me.

233
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,833
[IGNEEL]
Heh. Now, get that book.

234
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,541

Now I'm all fired up!

Who might you be?

00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,916
[NATSU]
Me? I'm Igneel's son!

The son of a dragon, eh?

239
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,291
[NATSU]
I'm taking that book!

240
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,416
And stopping the Faces!

00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Oh?

242

It's over. You're about
to get thrashed.

[MARD GEER]
Curse of Thorns!

244
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,375
[MARD GEER]
How could he dodge a curse

245
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,208
that he's never seen before?

246
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,166
[NATSU]
Fire Dragon...

247
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,375
[NATSU]
...Iron Fist!

[yelling]

249
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:47,875
[MARD GEER]
Kyoka, can you hear me?

250
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,000
[gasps]

251
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,291
[KYOKA]
Lord Mard Geer?

252
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,541
[MARD GEER] These dragons are
more trouble than I thought.

253
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,916
So, I've decided to
detonate the Faces sooner.

254
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:06,041
[MARD GEER] You're in the
control room, aren't you?

255
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,291
[KYOKA]
Yes.

256
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,125
But you should know, my Lord,

257
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,791
Keyes and Seilah
have been defeated,

258
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:15,250
which leaves us with no way
of controlling the Chairman.

259
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,666
[MARD GEER]
No need to worry.

260
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,750
Once the Faces
have been activated,

261
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,125
anyone can trigger
the detonation.

262
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,458
Even you.

263
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,125
[gasps]

264
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,416
[MARD GEER]
The main Lacrima should be

265
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
in the center of
the control room.

266
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,375
Now all you must
do is use Body Link

267
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,833
to connect yourself with it.

268
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,208
[KYOKA]
Body Link?

269
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,625
[MARD GEER]
By doing so,

270
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,375
you will make yourself
the detonator key,

271
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:41,375
which will allow us
to expedite our plan.

272
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,041
[MARD GEER]
If we can detonate the Faces,

273
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,708
we can nullify these
wizards for good.

274
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,041
And if we're lucky,
we may be able

275
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,958
to drain the dragons'
life force.

276
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:59,875
Then, our Master E.N.D.
will finally be revived.

277
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,541
[MARD GEER]
Victory will be ours.

278
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:08,791
[MARD GEER]
Now, Kyoka, do it.

279
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:12,416
[KYOKA] With all due
respect, Lord Mard Geer,

280
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
if I were to link
my own curse power

281
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:18,625
with the power
of the Faces...

282
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,208
...then I would die.

283
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:25,750
[MARD GEER]
So what? Are you afraid to die?

284
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,041
[gasps]

285
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,666
[KYOKA]
Not at all.

286
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,500
If it means Tartaros
completes its mission,

287
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,208
I will gladly give my life.

288
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,416
[BOTH]
Everything we do...

289
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,208
[MARD GEER, KYOKA]
We do for our Lord Zeref!

290
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:59,333
[KYOKA groaning]

291
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:02,541
[screaming]

292
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,291
What are those things?

293
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,791
I think they're some
kind of markers.

294
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,458
Um, guys, I have a really
bad feeling about this.

295
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,708
Yeah, I'm right there with ya.

296
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,375
[KYOKA] These are all the
locations of the Faces

297
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,833
throughout the continent.

298
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,250
And now the Body
Link is complete,

299
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,625
which means,

300
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:51,500
you're now looking at
the official new detonator.

301
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:52,750
You're what?

302
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,000
Did she say she's
using Body Link?

303
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,750
So that means,
she's a part of it?

304
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,625
Why would she do that?

305
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:03,416
They must've wanted the
Faces' detonation accelerated.

306
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,666
[chuckles]

307
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,000
I've just made things
very easy for you.

308
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:10,916
If you kill me, then
you will stop the Faces.

309
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,500
[KYOKA]
Though it really doesn't matter,

310
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,833
because I'll die either way.

311
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,375
[ERZA] Well, you certainly
are sure of yourself.

312
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,708
But have you ever even
considered the possibility

313
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,000
that you could lose?

314
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,125
[KYOKA]
No need.

315
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:27,791
For I have something you don't.

316
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:31,958
I am Kyoka, Goddess
of the Slave Planet!

317
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:33,125
[gasps]

318
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:39,875
And now I embrace my
true Etherious Form.

319
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,083
What?

320
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:14,833
[LUCY]
While Igneel and Acnologia

321
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,708
continue their intense battle,

322
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:20,416
Kyoka uses body link magic to
become the Faces' detonator.

323
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,916
Now it's up to one of Fairy
Tail's strongest warriors

324
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,541
to defeat her and stop
the accelerating countdown.

325
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:29,708
But even Erza is beginning
to feel helpless at the sight

326
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:33,375
of the Goddess of the slave
planet in her Etherious Form.

327
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:37,416
Next Time:
"Tartaros Chapter 00:00."

328
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,125
Even when all seems lost,
there's still something left.
