1
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,333
- Natsu: PREVIOUSLY,
ON FAIRY TAIL.

2
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:20,583
- Happy: IS IT JUST ME?

3
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:22,458
OR DOES OUR GUILD THROW
A WHOLE LOT OF EVENTS?

4
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:23,666
- Natsu: NOT THAT MANY!

5
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,541
I MEAN, THERE'S THE
BIG FANTASIA PARADE

6
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,333
AND THE FLOWER VIEWING
BINGO TOURNAMENT.

7
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:28,500
- Lucy: HEY FIRE-BREATH!
YOU'RE FORGETTING

8
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,083
THE MISS FAIRY TAIL CONTEST!

9
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:33,000
- Happy: OH, YEAH! DIDN'T YOU
TAKE THE TITLE LAST YEAR, LUCY?

10
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,708
- ( Lucy chuckles nervously )
HOW ABOUT WE PRETEND

11
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,500
I NEVER BROUGHT
THIS UP? FOR REAL

12
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:38,791
- ( theme song playing )

13
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,041
- ( singing in Japanese )

14
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:10,375
- ( bagpipes playing )

15
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:24,000
- Jason: SO COOL! GOOD MORNING

ANTICIPATED EVENT!

17
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,833
- FAIRY TAIL'S
MANDATORY-FOR-ALL-WIZARDS

18
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,416
24-HOUR ENDURANCE ROAD RACE

19
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,666
HAS ARRIVED AND WE'RE BRINGING

20
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,583

00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:44,500
THE COOLEST RACE IN
FAIRY TAIL HISTORY!

25
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:47,041
- ( Happy reading )

26
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,125
- ( Jason gasps )
THERE HE IS, FOLKS!

27
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:54,583
THE REIGNING AND UNDEFEATED
CHAMPION! LIGHTNING FAST JET!

28
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,958
RUMOR HAS IT HE DOES THIS TO
COMPENSATE FOR BEING

29
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,750
LACKLUSTER ON QUESTS!
SCANDALOUS!

30
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:01,375
- HEY! - COOL IT, SPEED DEMON
IT'S ONLY A RUMOR!

31
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,166
- JET'S STILL THE FAN-FAVORITE

32
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,000
EVERYBODY PUT THEIR
MONEY ON HIM AGAIN.

33
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,583
- HA! WELL I HOPE THEY'RE
READY TO LOSE IT.

34
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,625
THIS YEAR'S CHAMPION IS
GOING TO BE SALAMANDER!

35
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:12,250
- BIG TALKING MORONS ARE
SURE TO END UP IN A DITCH

36
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,041
BEFORE THEY GET CLOSE
TO THE FINISH LINE

37
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,666
- BUT THOSE MORONS DON'T HAVE
A SECRET WEAPON LIKE I DO!

38
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,625
- THE FIRE-BREATHER'S BLOWING
SMOKE. GEEZ, YOU'RE SUCH A CHILD

39
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:26,083
- ( exclaims )
YEAH! NOW I'M READY!

40
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,750
- YOU DOWNED IT? HOW THE HECK
ARE YOU GOING TO COMPETE?

41
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,250
- YOU DON'T HONESTLY
EXPECT ME TO RUN

42
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,458
ON AN EMPTY STOMACH, DO YOU?

43
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:32,958
- NO. JUST DO YOUR THING.

44
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,458
I'VE NEVER SEEN HER GET SO
RILED UP ABOUT AN EVENT!

45
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,166
- THAT'S BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO HAVE TO

46
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,416
PLAY THE PUNISHMENT GAME!

47
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,708
THE ONE LAST YEAR GAVE
ME NIGHTMARES!

48
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,916
- ( exclaims ) I DIDN'T
SIGN UP FOR A PUNISHMENT GAME!

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,458
- Makarov: EVERYONE QUIET DOWN!

50
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,000
FAIRY TAIL WIZARDS KNOW,
WITHOUT THE PROPER BALANCE

51
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,458
OF INTELLIGENCE
AND PHYSICAL ENDURANCE,

52
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,000
THEY ARE DOOMED TO FAILURE!

53
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,708
OVER THE NEXT TWENTY-FOUR HOURS,
YOU'LL USE THOSE ATTRIBUTES

54
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:55,791
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

55
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,833
- A REAL MAN NEVER
USES HIS BRAIN!

56
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,583
- YEAH, PHYSICAL STRENGTH
IS ALL THAT MATTERS

57
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:00,875
IN A RACE LIKE THIS!

58
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,666
- THE RULES ARE VERY SIMPLE.

59
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,250
FROM THE STARTING LINE,
EACH OF YOU WILL MAKE

60
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:08,333
YOUR WAY ALONG A PREDETERMINED
COURSE, ENDING AT MOUNT IBOR.

61
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,625
THE SUMMIT'S BEEN PEPPERED
WITH HEAVY WYVERN SCALES

62
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,541
YOU ARE TO GRAB ONE
AND BRING IT BACK!

63
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,791
ONCE IT'S ACROSS THE FINISH
LINE, YOU'VE COMPLETED

64
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:19,375
THE RACE AND PROVEN YOURSELF
A WORTHY MEMBER OF FAIRY TAIL!

65
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,541
NEVER FORGET, FORFEITING IS
NOT AN OPTION FOR ANY OF YOU.

66
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,458
FAIRY TAIL WIZARDS PRIDE
THEMSELVES ON OUR WILLINGNESS

67
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:26,958
TO GO THAT EXTRA MILE.

68
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,541
I'VE DECIDED TO PUT A NEW
RESTRICTION IN PLACE

69
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:30,708
FOR THIS YEAR'S EVENT.

70
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,708
AFTER NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS,
I'VE DECIDED,

71
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,500
THE USE OF FLYING MAGIC
IS NOW FORBIDDEN!

72
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,583
- ( all groaning )

73
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,750
- Makarov: ALL OTHER FORMS
OF MAGIC ARE STILL PERMITTED.

74
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,125
- GUESS I WON'T BE DRAWING
ANY HOT AIR BALLOONS.

75
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,833
- THE OLD MAN'S NOT PULLING
ANY PUNCHES THIS YEAR.

76
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,916
- AND WHOEVER'S UNFORTUNATE
ENOUGH TO COME IN LAST,

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,458
WILL FACE THE MOST
HORRIFIC PUNISHMENT GAME

78
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,875
I'VE EVER DEVISED!

79
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,875
- ( all gasping )

80
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,458
- IS IT JUST ME? OR DOES HE
ONLY PUT ON THIS EVENT

81
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,583
FOR THE PUNISHMENT GAME?

82
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,500
- LAST YEAR'S
WAS BEYOND SADISTIC!

83
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,375
- QUIT COMPLAINING, YA SISSIES,
IT'S EMBARRASSING!

84
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:05,166
IF ONLY ONE PERSON'S PUNISHED,
DON'T COME IN DEAD LAST!

85
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,250
- ALTHOUGH THERE IS A KERNEL OF
WISDOM IN YOUR WORDS, GAJEEL

86
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,291
YOUR PHRASING COULD USE
A LITTLE BIT OF WORK.

87
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,875
- YOU MAKING FUN OF ME?

88
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:16,625
- I'D SAY IF YOU'RE COMPETING,
DO IT WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH

89
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,875
THIS IS CUSTOM-MADE EQUIPMENT.

90
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:22,083
IT KEEPS MUSCLE FATIGUE AT BAY,
THUS INCREASING MY ENDURANCE.

91
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:25,250
- IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,
I'D SAY SHE WAS SHOWING OFF.

92
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,208
- IT'S ON! I'M NOT
HOLDING BACK THIS TIME.

93
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,833
TODAY YOU AND ME ARE RIVALS!

94
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,250
- I WON'T HOLD BACK
EITHER, OKAY.

95
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,750
BUT THIS NEW 'NO FLYING' RULE
SUCKS KITTY LITTER.

96
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,666
- WOW! POOR HAPPY!

97
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,250
- WITH THE OPENING
SPEECH NOW CONCLUDED,

98
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,666
IT'S TIME FOR THE MAIN EVENT!

99
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,916
LET'S HAVE ALL THE CONTESTANTS
ON THE STARTING LINE!

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,416
- WATCH MY START, LEVY!
IT'S GOING TO BLOW YOUR MIND!

101
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,208
- AND I CAN'T PROMISE ANYTHING.

102
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,625
- ( chuckles ) COME ON, HE JUST
WANTS TO SHOW OFF FOR YOU!

103
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,000
- OH, I'M NOT PLAYING HARD TO
GET OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

104
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,750
IT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO
WATCH HIM WHEN HE GOES ALL OUT.

105
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,750
- READY. BANG!

106
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,416
- ( gun fires )

107
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,875
- ALRIGHT LET'S START
THIS OFF BIG. HIGH SPEED!

108
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,958
- Jason: ONCE AGAIN,
JET STARTS THE RACE OFF

109
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:14,625
WITH AN OVERWHELMING
LEAD! SO COOL!

110
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,375
- SEE? NOW YOU KNOW WHAT
I WAS TALKING ABOUT.

111
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,625
- YEAH, I SURE DO

112
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:19,833
- ( explosion )

113
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:20,875
- ( both gasp )

114
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,625
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.

115
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,500
- TOLD YOU GUYS I HAD A
SECRET WEAPON THIS YEAR!

116
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,250
THIS IS MY FIRE DRAGON
IRON FIST BOOSTER!

117
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,541
- YOU BETTER HOPE I DON'T
CATCH UP TO YOU, CHEATER!

118
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,083
DO YOU HEAR ME?

119
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:36,000
- GOOD LUCK, LUCY AND LEVY!
DO YOUR BEST.

120
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,291
- THERE'S NO NEED TO BE NICE
TO THEM, WENDY.

121
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,750
EVERY PERSON IN THIS RACE
TODAY IS AN ENEMY!

122
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,125
- THIS IS BAD!

123
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,125
- IT JUST STARTED AND WE'RE
ALREADY DEAD LAST!

124
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,666
- NOW, I WONDER WHO'LL PLAY
THIS YEAR'S PUNISHMENT GAME!

125
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,916
I CAN HARDLY CONTAIN MYSELF!

126
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,041
- SORRY, HAPPY!
- SEE YOU LATER!

127
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,208
- ( panting )

128
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,166
- Jason: JET, THE
REIGNING CHAMPION,

129
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,333
MAINTAINS
AN IMPRESSIVE LEAD!

130
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,583
BUT NATSU ISN'T VERY
FAR BEHIND HIM!

131
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,000
ROCKETING INTO SECOND PLACE

132
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,541
WITH HIS FIRE DRAGON
IRON FIST BOOSTER!

133
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:13,666
BEHIND THEM, ERZA, GAJEEL, GRAY,
AND MANY MORE ARE COMPETING

134
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,708
FOR THIRD IN A HEART
POUNDING FREE-FOR-ALL.

135
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,375
WHICH ONE OF THEM WILL BREAK
OUT OF THE PACK AND CLAIM IT?

136
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,375
AND NOW JOINING ME LIVE TO
SHARE HER THOUGHTS

137
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,208
ON THIS EXCITING RACE
IS THE RAVISHING MISS MIRA JANE!

138
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:27,208
- WELL, JET IS APPARENTLY
SO FAST WE CAN'T SEE HIM.

139
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,375
- ( Jet laughing )

140
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,041
- PICTO MAGIC!

141
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,916
- ( screaming )

142
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,416
- THIS'LL BE EASY! I'LL DROP
EVERY ONE OF THEM!

143
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,125
- OH, NO!

144
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:49,125
- ( scoffs ) NOT EVERYDAY YOU
SEE HUMPTY-DUMPTY TAKE HIS FALL.

145
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,500
- ICE MAKE. FLOOR!

146
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,250
- ( exclaiming )

147
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,916
- SORRY, EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF.

148
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,791
- BETTER HOPE I DON'T CATCH
UP WITH YOU, GRAY!

149
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,791
- EYES IN FRONT, ICE BOY!

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,208
- ( grunting )

151
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:10,833
- WRONG WAY, MY DARLING!

152
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,000
- I NEED A DRINK!

153
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,125
- THAT'S THE LAST THING YOU
NEED RIGHT NOW!

154
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,416
- FUNNY, COMING FROM THE GUY
WHO CAN'T PUT DOWN HIS PIPE!

155
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,708
- I'M NOT KNOCKING YOUR VICE,

156
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,250
I'M SAYING IT'S NOT
GOING TO HELP YOU!

157
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,000
- IT'S NOT ABOUT NEEDING HELP,
IT'S ABOUT EASING MY STRESS!

158
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:28,291
- YOU GUYS ARE OUT OF SHAPE.
IF YOU TWO WORKED OUT INSTEAD

159
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,958
OF DRINKING AND SMOKING YOU
MIGHT HAVE HAD A CHANCE.

160
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,000
- ( grunts )

161
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,916
- ( gasps ) WHAT THE HECK
IS THIS? AN ENCHANTMENT?

162
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,500
- IT'S FRIED'S.

163
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,625
- HAS HE BOOBY-TRAPPED
THE COURSE?

164
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,208
- THAT'S CORRECT

165
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,708
- YOU WEREN'T GOING
TO LEAVE US HERE, ARE YOU?

166
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,250
I KNOW MASTER MAKAROV SAID
EVERYTHING BUT FLYING GOES,

167
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,500
BUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

168
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,750
- I DON'T PLAN TO KEEP
YOU TRAPPED FOR GOOD.

169
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,583
- WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?

170
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:02,125
"THE MAGIC-MOBILE DRIVING
LICENSE EXAM QUESTION BOOKLET?"

171
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,875
- "THE ELEMENTAL MAGIC
WORKBOOK.

172
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,875
LEVEL THREE, FOR ADVANCED
PRACTITIONERS"?

173
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,125
- WHEN I GET OUT OF HERE,
YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS!

174
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,625
- BEFORE YOU CAN DO THAT,

175
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,625
YOU MUST FIRST COMPLETE EVERY
WORKBOOK IN FRONT OF YOU.

176
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,958
IF YOU ANSWER THEM ALL
CORRECTLY, YOU'LL BE SET FREE.

177
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,041
- All: WE'RE SCREWED!

178
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,583
- WHY ARE YOU SURPRISED?

179
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,083
THE MASTER CHALLENGED US TO USE
OUR STRENGTH AND INTELLECT.

180
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,166
ALL FAIRY TAIL
MEMBERS SHOULD POSSES

181
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,958
BOTH OF THESE
ATTRIBUTES IN ABUNDANCE.

182
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:27,250
IF YOU MUST CAST BLAME,
LOOK TO THE ONE WHO LEADS.

183
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,083
- GET BACK HERE, YOU CAD!

184
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,833
- WHAT DID HE MEAN
BY THAT LAST PART?

185
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,541
- HE'S SAYING THE PERSON IN
FRONT OF US TRIPPED THE TRAP.

186
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,708
YOU AND I GOT DRAGGED
INTO THIS MESS.

187
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,291
- SO, DO EITHER OF YOU KNOW
THE ANSWER TO QUESTION ONE?

188
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,375
- Both: YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN,
YOU OLD HAG!

189
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,708
- I HOPE THAT YOU'LL FORGIVE ME.
- WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?

190
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,166
- SEEMS ERZA ISN'T RELYING
ON HER MAGIC AT ALL.

191
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:52,541
- SOMEBODY'S PLAYING DIRTY.

192
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,500
- IMPRESSIVE. YOUR INTUITION
HAS SERVED YOU WELL.

193
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,541
YOU MAY HAVE AVOIDED THAT TRAP.
BUT NOW, I...

194
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,958
- I DOUBT THAT YOU'LL BREAK MY
CONCENTRATION AGAIN AFTER THIS.

195
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,208
NOW, I HAVE TO GET MY
RUNNING RHYTHM BACK.

196
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:10,416
- WAIT. DON'T LEAVE! ERZA!

197
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,000
- IT'S AN ALL MAGIC BATTLE AND
ERZA SCARLET

198
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,458
IS MAKING IT LOOK SO COOL!

199
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,041
FAIRY TAIL'S WIZARDS ARE
PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS

200
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,250
FOR THIS YEAR'S RACE!

201
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,125
- NO ONE WANTS TO PLAY
THE PUNISHMENT GAME!

202
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:24,500
- OH! THERE'S MOVEMENT ON THE
SUMMIT OF MOUNT IBOR!

203
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,750
- ( gasping ) IS THAT HIM?

204
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:32,416
IT'S JET! LOOKS LIKE THE
OVER-UNDER WAS ON THE MONEY!

205
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,083
HE'S THE FIRST TO THE SUMMIT!
SO COOL!

206
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,708
THE FIRST WYVERN SCALE
HAS BEEN RETRIEVED!

207
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,166
NOW HE JUST HAS
TO BRING IT BACK.

208
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,791
JET'S SPEED IS OUT
OF THIS WORLD!

209
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,458
THINGS ARE HEATING UP
AND THAT'S SO COOL!

210
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:50,375
- ( sighing ) I'M EXHAUSTED.
GO ON WITHOUT ME, LEVY.

211
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,708
I'M ONLY GOING TO SLOW YOU DOWN.

212
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,625
- ON YOUR FEET, LU!
YOU CAN DO THIS!

213
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,333
- I'M NOT GETTING VERY FAR
WHEN MY LEGS FEEL LIKE JELLY.

214
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:59,083
I JUST NEED TO REST A BIT, OKAY?
DON'T WORRY, I'LL CATCH UP.

215
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:03,583
- ALRIGHT, IF YOU'RE SURE.
DON'T STAY HERE TOO LONG, OKAY?

216
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:07,458
- THIS SUCKS! I WAS SURE THAT
I'D LAST WAY LONGER THAN THIS.

217
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,916
WELL, I GUESS IT'S TIME TO
BRING OUT THE BIG GUNS.

218
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:14,375
OPEN! GATE OF THE MAIDEN! VIRGO!

219
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,625
- HOW MAY I SERVE YOU
TODAY, PRINCESS?

220
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,875
- CARRY ME TO THE TOP
OF THIS MOUNTAIN, ASAP!

221
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:25,083
- SUPER-EXPRESS-SPEED!
- IT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE!

222
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:29,000
- OH, YEAH. MUCH BETTER.
NOW LET'S GET BACK IN THE RACE!

223
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,333
- HOLD ON TIGHTLY.

224
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,666
- ( screaming )

225
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,541
- WHOA! WAS THAT LUCY?

226
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,125
- STOP! VIRGO, HIT THE BRAKES.

227
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,916
IF YOU DON'T, I'M GOING
TO SOIL MYSELF!

228
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,166
- SUCH A LOVELY SPRING.

229
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,500
THANKS FOR SHARING,
I NEEDED THE REFRESHMENT.

230
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,916
( sighing )
OH, MY DARLING GRAY.

231
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,166
WILL YOU EVER FORGIVE ME
FOR WHAT I DID?

232
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,833
I WAS SO AFRAID OF THIS
PUNISHMENT GAME

233
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,166
EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT,

234
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,333
THAT I ABANDONED YOU WHEN
YOU NEEDED ME THE MOST.

235
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,333
IF ONLY I COULD GO BACK IN TIME,

236
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,041
I WOULD HAVE DONE THINGS
DIFFERENTLY, MY LOVE.

237
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:07,125
I WILL WAIT FOR YOU BESIDE
THIS GENTLE SPRING, MY DEAR.

238
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,583
AND WHEN YOU ARRIVE,

239
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,708
I WILL SOOTHE YOUR TROUBLES
WITH ITS PRISTINE WATERS.

240
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,416
JUST LIKE THIS.

241
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,208
OH, NO!
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?

242
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,000
- HEY, CARLA, LOOK.
ISN'T THAT JUVIA?

243
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,125
- IT APPEARS SHE'S
MERGED WITH THE RIVER.

244
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,125
SHE MUST HAVE BECOME OVERLY
STIMULATED BY THE STRESS

245
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,833
OF THE RACE AND
FELL INTO THE WATER,

246
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,875
WHICH WAS A CARELESS
MISTAKE ON HER PART.

247
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,666
- HEY, EITHER OF YOU SEEN
JUVIA AROUND? - MMM-HMM.

248
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:43,791
- WHAT THE?
- HELP ME, GRAY!

249
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:48,541
- ( laughing ) AH! COME ON,
BURN. KEEP IT HOT!

250
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,875
MAN, DON'T GO OUT ON ME NOW!

251
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,583
WELL, YOU DID LAST
OVER HALF A DAY.

252
00:12:56,666 --> 00:13:00,041
- GUESS I OVERDID IT A LITTLE
BIT BACK THERE.

253
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,708
- GAJEEL?
- ( growling ) OUT OF THE WAY!

254
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,166
- THAT WAS A CHEAP SHOT!

255
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,500
EXCUSE ME, CAN I HAVE
A BITE OF YOUR FIRE?

256
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,333
- Jason: THE TWELVE-HOUR
MARK HAS COME AND GONE

257
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:30,041
AND THE COOL NIGHT ATMOSPHERE
HAS FALLEN OVER THE TRACK!

258
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,000
MANY OF THE RUNNERS HAVE
ALREADY REACHED THE SUMMIT

259
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,541
AND ARE SNATCHING
UP WYVERN SCALES

260
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,750
AS FAST AS THEY CAN
BEFORE HEADING BACK!

261
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,708
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
IS ANYONE'S GUESS!

262
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,541
- ( panting )

263
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,416
- ( sighs ) FINALLY.

264
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,166
HUH!

265
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,416
( grunting )

266
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,291
( exclaims )

267
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,333
( sighs )

268
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,333
( grunting )

269
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,750
- WHOA! YOU OKAY, BUDDY?
- BEEN BETTER.

270
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:24,875
- THANKS FOR HELPING ME,
OLD PAL.

271
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,958
- ( chuckles ) WELL,
SEE YOU AROUND.

272
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,791
- BE SURE NOT TO PUSH
YOURSELF TOO HARD.

273
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:32,041
- YEAH, I KNOW. FIRE DRAGON
IRON FIST BOOSTER.

274
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,875
- ( exhales )

275
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,875
- ONLY TWELVE HOURS LEFT IN
THIS CRAZY RACE OF ENDURANCE!

276
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:41,125
IF YOU'RE JUST JOINING US, YOU
ARE IN FOR ONE SUPER COOL SHOW!

277
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,458
THE WIZARDS AND THEIR WYVERN
SCALES ARE SPEEDING

278
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,916
TOWARD MAGNOLIA SOUTH GATE PARK

279
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,791
WHERE A CROWD IS WAITING
IN SWEET ANTICIPATION!

280
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,833
IT'S SO COOL I CAN'T TAKE IT!

281
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,708
JET'S STILL
MAINTAINING HIS LEAD

282
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,833
BUT NOT FAR BEHIND HIM IS
THE LOVELY ERZA,

283
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,541
WHO'S JUST AS CALM AS SHE WAS
AT THE START OF THE RACE!

284
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,500
AND BATTLING FOR THIRD ARE
GAJEEL, LUCY, AND GRAY.

285
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,250
THEY'VE FOUGHT HARD FOR THEIR
SPOT ON THE TRACK,

286
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,791
BUT CAN THEY PULL AHEAD?

287
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,000
THE REST OF THE GUILD IS
BRINGING UP THE REAR

288
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,708
IN A TENSE, DOG-EAT-DOG
SHOWDOWN THAT WON'T LET UP!

289
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,666
EVERYONE'S GIVING
IT ALL THEY CAN!

290
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,125
HOPING TO AVOID
THE HORRIFIC PUNISHMENT

291
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,583
THE MASTER HAS IN STORE.

292
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,666
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT
LOOKING AWAY!

293
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,541
- LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER
CLEAN VICTORY.

294
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,083
I THINK I'VE EARNED MYSELF
A LITTLE BIT OF A BREATHER.

295
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:37,875
- Jason: COOL-A-DOODLE-DOO! THE
RACE IS NOW IN ITS FINAL STAGE,

296
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,333
AND THE SUPER-SPEEDY JET HAS
COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED

297
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,458
FROM THE TRACK! WHAT AN UPSET!

298
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,500
- ( grunting )

299
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,625
- Jason: ERZA'S IN THE LEAD!
FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY NATSU,

300
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,250
GAJEEL, GRAY AND LUCY!

301
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,666
THIS IS GOING TO BE A CLOSE ONE!

302
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,291
- AW! I'M SO PROUD
OF EVERYBODY.

303
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,583
- AND YOU SHOULD BE. WHAT DO YOU
SAY WE MOVE THIS THING OUTSIDE?

304
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,250
I WANT TO BE THERE
FOR THE BIG FINISH.

305
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,250
WE'RE WITNESSING HISTORY
IN THE MAKING, FOLKS!

306
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,833
THIS IS THE VERY
DEFINITION OF "COOL"!

307
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,833
- WHAT'S THAT?

308
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:09,583
IT'S JET! HEY, YOU NEED TO
WAKEUP! RISE AND SHINE.

309
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,333
JET IT'S MORNING ALREADY.
COME ON

310
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,791
- HUH?
- UH. HEY HAPPY, WHAT'S UP?

311
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,083
- ARE YOU SURE THIS IS THE
BEST TIME TO TAKE A NAP?

312
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:22,208
- ( screaming ) IS IT OVER?

313
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,500
- NOT YET, BUT EVERYONE'S
AHEAD OF YOU!

314
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,041
- THAT MEANS
THERE'S STILL TIME LEFT.

315
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,208
THANKS MAN, I OWE YOU BIG
TIME FOR THIS ONE!

316
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,375
- ( screams )

317
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,208
- Jason: WE'RE MINUTES AWAY FROM
THE FINISH LINE,

318
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,208
WITH FOUR RUNNERS TIED
FOR FIRST PLACE!

319
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,458
- COOL!

320
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,916
- Natsu: ALRIGHT! I CAN
FINALLY SEE MAGNOLIA!

321
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,375
- WHOA! WHAT IS THAT?
- IT'S JET!

322
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:46,291
- THAT'S A SURPRISE.
HE'S NOT IN THE LEAD?

323
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,958
- WHAT THE HECK? I THOUGHT
JET WOULD HAVE MADE IT

324
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,166
OVER THE FINISH LINE BY NOW.

325
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,916
- IF HE'S BEHIND US,
THAT MEANS WE'VE BEEN

326
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,083
COMPETING FOR FIRST
PLACE THIS ENTIRE TIME!

327
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,208
- IT LOOKS LIKE JET
IS PLAYING CATCH-UP

328
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,125
AFTER HIS LITTLE VANISHING ACT!

329
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:04,541
TOO COOL! HE LEFT HIS GUILD
MATES IN THE DUST!

330
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:07,833
- YOU'RE NOT PULLING
AHEAD OF ME. REQUIP!

331
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:11,041
- WOW! - WHY IS SHE
DRESSED LIKE A BUNNY?

332
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,500
- WHO CARES ABOUT THAT?
SHE'S ABOUT TO BEAT US!

333
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:14,958
- NOT WHILE I'M HERE!

334
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,541
- SOMETHING'S OFF!
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

335
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,708
- DOESN'T SHE SEEM A
LITTLE SLOW FOR A BUNNY?

336
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,875
- MAYBE SHE JUST LIKES
THE WAY IT LOOKS.

337
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,625
- THAT'S FUNNY, SHE CERTAINLY
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE SOMEONE

338
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:25,791
WHO CARES ABOUT HER APPEARANCE.

339
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,000
- IF YOU THINK
YOU'RE BEATING ME

340
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,166
YOU'RE IN FOR A WORLD
OF DISAPPOINTMENT!

341
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,583
- Jason: JET CLOSES
THE DISTANCE JUST IN TIME

342
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,166
FOR THE HOME STRETCH.

343
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,500
A FIVE WAY TIE FOR FIRST PLACE!
THIS IS SO COOL I MIGHT EXPLODE!

344
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,333
- FIRE DRAGON IRON FIST!

345
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,583
- REQUIP!

346
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,833
- Jason: UH-OH!

347
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,333
NATSU'S IRON FIST BOOSTER
IS OUT OF FUEL ONCE AGAIN!

348
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,416
HE'S OUT OF THE RUNNING
FOR FIRST PLACE.

349
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,958
- IF YOU THINK I'M
LETTING IT END LIKE THIS,

350
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,916
YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER THING COMING!

351
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,291
- Jason: INCREDIBLE! HE'S STILL
WITH THE PACK!

352
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,125
EVEN WHEN HE'S FIRED UP,
HE'S STILL SO COOL!

353
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,208
- COME ON, COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON!

354
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,250
- ( grunting )

355
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,500
- ( panting )

356
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,625
- ( roaring )

357
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:23,000
- All: THIS YEAR'S TITLE IS
GOING TO BE MINE!

358
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,375
- ALL OF THEM WIPE OUT A
MERE FEET FROM THE GOAL!

359
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,458
- WHAT'S THIS? I THINK I SEE
AN UNDERDOG APPROACHING!

360
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:41,291
OR AN UNDER-CAT! IT'S
HAPPY! HE'S CLOSING IN!

361
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:42,875
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME!

362
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:49,208
- COOL! WE MAY HAVE
A NEW CHAMPION!

363
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,333
- ( exclaims excitedly )

364
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,750
I DID IT! I ACTUALLY WON!

365
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,916
- CONGRATULATIONS!
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU!

366
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,833
- YEP. YOU RAN A HECK
OF A RACE, MY BOY!

367
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,416
- AYE, SIR!

368
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,875
- Jason: GOAL! THE WINNER OF
THIS YEAR'S 24-HOUR ENDURANCE

369
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,833
ROAD RACE IS HAPPY!

370
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,958
I TOLD YOU THIS WOULD BE A
HISTORIC EVENT

371
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,041
BUT NOBODY COULD HAVE
PREDICTED THIS.

372
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,166
DON'T FORGET THAT SORCERER
WEEKLY WAS HERE,

373
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,916
BRINGING YOU ALL OF THE
SUPER COOL ACTION.

374
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,541
- I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER
FELT SO ALIVE!

375
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,458
- HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
- WE LOST THIS RACE TO...

376
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,458
- THAT FREAKING CAT?

377
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,500
- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT
TAKING THIS AS HARD

378
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,000
AS I THOUGHT YOU WOULD, CHAMP.

379
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,458
- WELL, THE LITTLE GUY DID WAKE
ME UP FROM MY NAP EARLIER.

380
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:31,875
I'LL LET HIM WIN THIS YEAR.

381
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,625
BUT NEXT TIME, I WON'T
BE AS CARELESS.

382
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,125
- ( panting )

383
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:39,041
- WHAT ARE WE DOING?
- THEY'RE GOING TO CROSS!

384
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,583
- NEWCOMERS WENDY AND CARLA
TAKE SECOND AND THIRD!

385
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,125
IT'S THE YEAR OF THE UNDERDOGS!

386
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,666
LET'S HEAR IT FOR OUR
TRIO OF ADORABLE WINNERS.

387
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,666
THEY'VE DONE THE
FAIRY TAIL GUILD PROUD!

388
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,333
- OH!
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

389
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,541
- ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

390
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,041
- IF WE DON'T CROSS THE FINISH
LINE BEFORE THEY DO,

391
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,833
WE'LL HAVE TO PLAY THE
PUNISHMENT GAME.

392
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,583
- OH!

393
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,583
- GET YOUR BOOTS OFF OF MY BACK!

394
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,208
- THE BULK OF FAIRY TAIL
JUST STEAMROLLED OVER

395
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,125
THE FINISH LINE LIKE
AN UNSTOPPABLE ARMY,

396
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,166
LEAVING ONLY FIVE CONTESTANTS
LEFT IN THE RACE!

397
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,833
MAKE THAT FOUR! ERZA
SNUCK ACROSS THE LINE

398
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,125
WITH THE REST OF THEM!

399
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,791
- HURRY, MY LOVE! GET UP!

400
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,625
- COME ON, NATSU!
- YOU'RE THE LAST ONES LEFT.

401
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,416
- THIS IS BAD.
- YOU THINK?

402
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,166
- I CAN BARELY STAND,
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO

403
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,541
CROSS THE FINISH LINE?

404
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,208
- ENJOY YOUR PUNISHMENT GAME,
LOSERS! HIGH SPEED!

405
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,083
- WOW, YOU GUYS ARE
SO PETTY!

406
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,416
- All: SHUT UP!
- LET GO OF ME!

407
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,208
- AND THE RACE COMES TO
A SHOCKING CONCLUSION.

408
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,958
WE HAVE OUR FIRST FOUR-WAY-TIE
FOR LAST PLACE!

409
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,000
- All: SAY WHAT?

410
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,625
- NO ONE IN A MILLION YEARS
WOULD'VE EVER PREDICTED

411
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,208
SUCH A DRAMATIC OUTCOME LIKE
THE ONE WE SAW HERE TODAY.

412
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,458
TIED IN LAST PLACE ARE NATSU,
GAJEEL, GRAY AND THE

413
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,333
PREVIOUS CHAMPION, JET.
BUT IT'S NOT OVER FOR THEM.

414
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:46,666
NOW IT'S TIME FOR
THE PUNISHMENT GAME.

415
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,916
- ( evil chuckle ) THIS TURNED
OUT BETTER THAN I'D HOPED!

416
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,875
- WE ALL GET PUNISHED?
- AW, COME ON!

417
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,375
WHY CAN'T WE JUST RUN
ANOTHER RACE AS A TIE-BREAKER?

418
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:58,416
- QUIT COMPLAINING!
I EXPECTED BETTER FROM YOU!

419
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,166
JUST LIKE REAL WORK, WIZARDS

420
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,375
DON'T GET ANY DO-OVERS
WHEN THEY MUCK UP.

421
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,291
YOU GOTTA LEARN TO DEAL
WITH THE CONSEQUENCES!

422
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,708
PAINFUL CONSEQUENCES FOR
YOU AND FUN FOR ME!

423
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,000
YEAH. FOUR TIMES THE FUN!

424
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,541
- FINE. BRING IT ON. I'M NOT
AFRAID OF YOUR PUNISHMENT GAME.

425
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,541
I CAN TAKE WHATEVER
YOU DISH OUT.

426
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,625
- THAT'S IT. KEEP THAT RESOLVE,
LAD. BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY

427
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,000
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED IT FOR
WHAT I'VE GOT IN STORE!

428
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,916
BEHOLD! YOUR PUNISHMENT.

429
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,416
- I CAN'T BE THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S CONFUSED RIGHT NOW.

430
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,375
- ARE WE SUPPOSED TO
READ THE THING?

431
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,041
- NO, IT'S SOMETHING MUCH WORSE.

432
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,666
SORCERER WEEKLY WILL
PRINT AN ISSUE OF

433
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,208
NOTHING BUT GLAMOUR SHOTS.

434
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,625
AND THE MODELS FOR THESE PIN
UPS WILL BE YOU BONEHEADS!

435
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,666
- All: WHOA!

436
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,750
- A DELUXE TWENTY-PAGE SPREAD,
COMPLETE WITH UP-CLOSE

437
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:40,916
AND PERSONAL
INTERVIEWS!

438
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,375
- All: WHAT?

439
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:46,125
- IF I'D COME IN LAST,
I'D BE IN SORCERER WEEKLY?

440
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:49,333
- OH, MY DARLING. I CAN'T WAIT
TO READ YOUR INTERVIEWS

441
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:50,833
AND HANG YOUR PIN-UPS
OVER MY BED.

442
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,875
- I'LL DESTROY EVERY COPY!

443
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,500
- OH, THIS IS THE COOLEST
OUTCOME EVER.

444
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:55,541
NOW, THEN, IF YOU
GENTLEMEN WILL FOLLOW ME,

445
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,166
WE'LL GET YOUR
OUTFITS PICKED OUT.

446
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,041
( exclaims )

447
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,958
WAIT. I STILL NEED
TO MEASURE YOU.

448
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:04,750
- NOT HAPPENING!
- YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK SO COOL.

449
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,958
- I'M SURPRISED THEY CAN
STILL RUN AFTER THE RACE.

450
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,708
- IT APPEARS THEY WEREN'T
GIVING IT THEIR ALL, EITHER.

451
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:10,875
COLOR ME IMPRESSED.

452
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,583
- WAIT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY "EITHER"?

453
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,166
- DOES THIS MEAN NO
GRAY CENTERFOLD?

454
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,000
- MASTER, NOW THAT THAT'S OVER
- HMM?

455
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,291
- BEING CHAMP IS GREAT AND ALL
BUT I WAS HOPING TO TAKE HOME

456
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:21,666
A BUNCH OF FISH AS A PRIZE.

457
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,458
- YOU'VE ALREADY GOT A PRIZE.
- HUH?

458
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:27,708
- ( chuckles )
YOU'VE GOTTEN ACCOLADES

459
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:29,125
AND THE HONOR OF WINNING.

460
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:32,083
THAT'S FAR GREATER THAN
ANY MATERIAL PRIZE.

461
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:36,208
- YOU'RE SAYING I GET DIDDLY
SQUAT. THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

462
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:39,791
NO FAIR! WHAT A RIP-OFF!

463
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,416
- ( theme song playing )

464
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,791

465
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:15,625
- Natsu: WHOA, NO KIDDING?
GILDARTS IS FINALLY BACK?

466
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:17,750
- Happy: IT TOOK HIM FOREVER
TO FINISH THAT JOB,

467
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,208
BUT HE SHOULD BE HERE REAL SOON.

468
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,333
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HIM AGAIN!

469
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:22,708
- Natsu: YEAH, NEITHER CAN I.

470
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:24,208
I'M GOING TO CHALLENGE HIM THE
MINUTE HE GETS BACK.

471
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:25,875
- Happy: EVEN THOUGH YOU'LL
OBVIOUSLY LOSE?

472
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:28,375
- Natsu: NUH-UH. HE'S GOING DOWN
THIS TIME. JUST YOU WATCH.

473
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:31,250
- Happy: YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT
BUT YOU NEVER WIN.

474
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:33,166
- ( Natsu and Happy reading )

475
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,375
