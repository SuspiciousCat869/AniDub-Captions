1
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,833
- Makarov:
PREVIOUSLY ON "FAIRY TAIL--"

2
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:21,291
- Mirajane:
MY LITTLE SISTER LISANNA

3
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,541
AND NATSU HAVE BEEN CLOSE
EVER SINCE THEY WERE YOUNG.

4
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,125
ONE TRAGIC DAY THERE
WAS AN ACCIDENT

5
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,416
AND WE ALL THOUGHT
SHE WAS DEAD.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,041
IT WAS TOUGH, BUT WE
MANAGED TO COPE

7
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,583
WITH THE PAIN
AND GET ON WITH OUR LIVES.

8
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,041
- Natsu:
WHEN WE WENT TO EDOLAS, WE MET

9
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,666
WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS
HER WEIRD TWIN.

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,375
BUT IT TURNED OUT
TO ACTUALLY BE HER!

11
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,041
THE REAL LISANNA!

12
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,083
- ( theme music playing )

13
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,041
- ( singing in Japanese )

14
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:10,000
- Narrator: FAIRY TAIL'S S-CLASS
WIZARD PROMOTION TRIAL

15
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:13,041
WAS WELL UNDERWAY
WHEN THE FEARSOME GRIMOIRE HEART

16
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,208
APPEARED AND LAUNCHED AN ATTACK.

17
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:15,708
OUR FRIENDS STRUGGLED

18
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:18,166
AGAINST THE LOST MAGIC USERS

19
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,541
KNOWN AS THE SEVEN KIN.

20
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,083
EVEN MAKAROV FELL IN BATTLE

21
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,333
TO THEIR FIENDISH LEADER.

22
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,375
- I'LL TAKE DOWN MASTER HADES!

23
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,875
AND I'LL DO IT
WITH MY OWN TWO HANDS!

24
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,791
- I PITY YOU, YOUNG MAN.

25
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,166
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW

26
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,125
THE POWER OF FAMILY!

27
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:38,500
- Narrator: NATSU WAS ABLE
TO DIG DEEP INSIDE

28
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,416
AND DEFEAT THE GOD SLAYER
ZANCROW.

29
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,666
HOWEVER...

30
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:48,625
- Happy: ...

31
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:58,250
- ( laughing )

32
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:01,500
- NO WAY.
THAT WEAK LITTLE DRAGON HUNTER

33
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:04,083
ACTUALLY BEAT ME?

34
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:07,375
- Makarov: HE EMPTIED OUT
ALL OF HIS OWN MAGIC POWER

35
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,708
IN ORDER TO CREATE A VESSEL FOR
CAPTURING HIS OPPONENT'S FLAMES.

36
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,125
THAT STRATEGY SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE.

37
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:18,208
BUT, HE DOESN'T KNOW
THE MEANING OF THAT WORD.

38
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:21,958
THOUGH I STILL NEED TO SCOLD HIM
FOR BEING SO RECKLESS.

39
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,208
- Natsu:
GRAMPS.

40
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,416
LET'S KEEP FIGHTING.

41
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,083
I LEARNED A VALUABLE LESSON
FROM GILDARTS.

42
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:36,125
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO KNOW
YOUR LIMITS, AND FALL BACK.

43
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:40,291
BUT NOW, NOW IS NOT
ONE OF THOSE TIMES.

44
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,500
THESE PEOPLE MADE AN ENEMY
OUT OF FAIRY TAIL.

45
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,250
WE'VE GOT TO SHOW THEM
NOBODY CAN DO THAT.

46
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:50,000
YOU CAN NEVER DEFEAT A GUILD
THAT HAS AS MUCH HEART AS WE DO.

47
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,000
NOT WITHOUT A FIGHT.

48
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,250
RIGHT, GRAMPS?

49
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,666
- NATSU!

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,208
- IF YOU'RE INDEED
ALL ONE BIG FAMILY,

51
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,291
I SUPPOSE IT'S FITTING
THAT YOU SHOULD FALL TOGETHER.

52
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:22,000
- MIRA, YOU'VE GOT TO USE
SATAN'S SOUL.

53
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,958
- Azuma:
SOUNDS INTRIGUING.

54
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:28,791
- I CAN'T, I'M STILL RECOVERING
FROM THE LAST TIME I USED IT.

55
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,541
- I KNOW YOU, YOU'RE SISTERS.

56
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,125
FROM FAIRY TAIL'S
LEGENDARY STRAUSS FAMILY.

57
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,166
AND IF THAT'S TRULY THE CASE,
THEN YOU--

58
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,666
YOU MUST BE THE ONE
KNOWN AS THE SHE-DEVIL.

59
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,166
- Mirajane:
THAT'S WHO I USED TO BE.

60
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,333
- Lisanna:
BUT SHE'S STILL JUST AS STRONG

61
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,541
AS SHE EVER WAS BACK THEN.

62
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,666
- IS THAT SO?

63
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,958
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO BATTLE
WITH A WARRIOR

64
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,500
WHO POSSESSES THE POWER
OF A TRUE DEMON.

65
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,666
ARE YOU NOW TOO WEAK
TO FULFILL MY WISH?

66
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,333
- WELL, I'M READY
TO TAKE YOU ON.

67
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,000
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, LISANNA?

68
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,375
YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.

69
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,500
HE'S TOO STRONG.

70
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,208
YOU CAN'T BEAT HIM.

71
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,583
- I WOULD PREFER
NOT TO DO THIS,

72
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:15,625
BUT YOU HAVE FORCED MY HAND.

73
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,875
- NO!
- LISANNA!

74
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,041
- IN THREE MINUTES,

75
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,125
THE ROOTS HOLDING HER
WILL DETONATE.

76
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,000
THAT WON'T WORK.

77
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,500
TRYING TO PULL IT APART
IS A WASTE OF TIME AND ENERGY.

78
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,500
YOUR ONLY HOPE OF STOPPING IT
IS BY DEFEATING ME.

79
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:46,541
- I CAN'T...MOVE!
- YOU COWARD!

80
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:52,000
- YOU SAY THAT, AND YET I AM THE
ONE WHO IS NOT AFRAID TO FIGHT.

81
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,458
- BE CAREFUL.

82
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:04,250
- I DON'T HAVE
MUCH MAGIC POWER LEFT.

83
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,458
BUT THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE HER

84
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,791
IS TO FIGHT!

85
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,791
- AT LAST, A WORTHY FOE.

86
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:15,291
IT FEELS AMAZING!

87
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:22,625
- NO, MIRA!

88
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:24,833
KEEP YOUR MIND ON THE BATTLE.

89
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:25,833
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

90
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,708
CHAIN BURST, NOW.

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,416
HER STRENGTH...

92
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,958
- LET MY SISTER GO!

93
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,500
- Azuma:
HER INTENSITY...

94
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,833
Azuma:
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME

95
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,041
SINCE I'VE FELT SO ALIVE.

96
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:37,083
Azuma: YOU SHOULD KNOW
BETTER THAN TO LOOK AWAY.

97
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,583
NOW, BURST CLAW.

98
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,708
- MIRA!

99
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,083
NO-OO!

100
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,125
- EVIL EXPLOSION!

101
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,458
- VERY IMPRESSIVE.

102
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:27,625
THIS IS SO MUCH FUN.
LET'S KEEP GOING.

103
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:31,083
- IT'S POINTLESS,
HE'S WAY TOO STRONG FOR ME.

104
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:38,416
I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MAGIC POWER
TO KEEP THIS UP.

105
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:47,541
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

106
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,250
- ARE YOU RUNNING AWAY FROM ME?

107
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,041
STAND AND FIGHT.

108
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,500
IT'S THE ONLY HOPE YOU HAVE
OF SAVING YOUR SISTER.

109
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,041
NOW, COME HERE AND FACE ME.

110
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,458
DO IT WHILE THERE'S
STILL TIME.

111
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:09,250
- I'M SORRY.

112
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:12,416
I DIDN'T WANT IT
TO END THIS WAY.

113
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,125
BUT I JUST DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH POWER LEFT TO BEAT HIM.

114
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:20,708
THE WAY I AM RIGHT NOW,
I'M JUST TOO WEAK.

115
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,541
- YOU'RE GIVING UP?

116
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:31,500
- LISTEN, I'M NOT
GIVING UP HOPE.

117
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,375
I HAVE FAITH SOMEBODY IN
OUR GUILD WILL HAVE THE STRENGTH

118
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,250
TO TAKE THIS GUY DOWN.

119
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,875
I KNOW THEY WILL.

120
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,083
- BUT, WHY?

121
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:43,875
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, WHY NOW?

122
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:48,458
- SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO KNOW

123
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:51,083
WHEN YOU'VE BEEN BEATEN.

124
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:58,375
THERE'S NO NEED
TO WORRY, LISANNA.

125
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,458
I PROMISE YOU,

126
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,916
I WON'T LET YOU DIE AGAIN.

127
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,541
- ( alarm sounds )

128
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,125
- HEY, ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

129
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:58,750
MIRA?

130
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,541
BIG SIS,

131
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:01,916
WAKE UP.

132
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,708
PLEASE, WAKE UP.

133
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,416
MIRA, NO!

134
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:16,750
NO-OO!

135
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:39,791
- THIS PATH I'VE TRAVELED,
SUCH AN EXHAUSTING JOURNEY.

136
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:43,791
LONG, AND FULL OF TURMOIL.

137
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:49,208
BUT TODAY, IT APPEARS
I'VE FINALLY REACHED IT'S END.

138
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:55,166
AND ONCE I'VE FOUND LORD ZEREF,
MY SOUL CAN BE AT PEACE.

139
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,875
WHO ARE YOU?

140
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,291
- YOU'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR ME?

141
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,833
I SEE.  YOU MUST BE
ONE OF THOSE

142
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:10,083
SOWING THE SEEDS
OF CONFLICT AND DEATH.

143
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:13,500
IT'S TRAGIC,

144
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,041
FOR YOU HAVE MADE ME
QUITE ANGRY.

145
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,958
- Pantherlily:
WENDY, ARE YOU OKAY?

146
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,666
- Wendy:
YEAH, I'M FINE.

147
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,083
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY I CAN'T HEAL THEM.

148
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,500
HOW COME IT ISN'T WORKING?

149
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,458
- MASTER'S WOUNDS MAY BE
TOO SEVERE

150
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,208
TO BE HEALED BY SKY MAGIC.

151
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,458
I'M AFRAID THERE MAY BE NOTHING

152
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:58,875
WE CAN DO FOR HIM
AT THE MOMENT.

153
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,500
- AND NATSU?

154
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,166
- I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE
WHY HE'S NOT RESPONDING.

155
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,291
BUT IT FEELS AS IF THERE'S
SOMETHING GETTING IN THE WAY.

156
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,250
- OH, NO.

157
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,833
POOR GUYS.

158
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:20,750
- Makarov: WENDY...

159
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,041
- MASTER!

160
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:25,416
- I HAD FAITH THAT YOU WOULD
FIND US.

161
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,375
WHAT A BLESSING.
ARE YOU WELL, MY CHILD?

162
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,541
- YES, SIR.

163
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:35,291
- I'M AN OLD MAN, BUT NATSU--

164
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:38,291
HE IS OUR GUILD'S FUTURE.
SAVE HIM.

165
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,166
- BUT MASTER, YOU'RE HURT.

166
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,708
I CAN'T JUST LEAVE YOU HERE
IN PAIN LIKE THAT.

167
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,916
IF YOU HANG ON, I'M SURE I CAN
FIGURE OUT A WAY

168
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,125
TO HELP BOTH OF YOU.

169
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:50,791
- HIS SCARF, IT'S BEEN TAINTED.

170
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:55,791
PLEASE, YOU MUST TRY
TO RETURN IT TO NORMAL.

171
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,500
- I NEED TO FIX HIS SCARF?

172
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,833
- THE MALEVOLENT FORCE
THAT HAS TAINTED IT

173
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:05,083
IS WHAT'S PREVENTING HIM
FROM BEING HEALED.

174
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,916
- OKAY, I'LL TRY.

175
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,833
- DOES ANYBODY KNOW
WHAT COULD HAVE MADE HIS SCARF

176
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,333
TURN BLACK IN THE FIRST PLACE?

177
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,916
- THIS CREEPY GUY
WHO WOULDN'T STOP CRYING

178
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,458
THAT WE RAN INTO EARLIER
WAS THE ONE THAT DID IT.

179
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,708
- GRIMOIRE HEART
IS HERE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.

180
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:23,625
DO YOU THINK THIS CRYING MAN
YOU MET-- COULD HE BE ZEREF?

181
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,375
- IT'S HIM.

182
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:34,666
AFTER YEARS OF SEARCHING,
LORD ZEREF IS STANDING

183
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,833
RIGHT BEFORE MY VERY EYES.

184
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,666
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

185
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,541
- YOU PEOPLE HAVE COME HERE

186
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,166
BECAUSE YOU DESPERATELY SEEK
MY POWER.

187
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:52,375
- IT IS YOUR ENTIRE EXISTENCE
WE SEEK, LORD ZEREF.

188
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,833
- I WON'T INVOLVE MYSELF
IN MANKIND'S AFFAIRS.

189
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,583
NOT FOR THE REMAINDER
OF THIS CURRENT ERA.

190
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:09,375
I HAVE NO DESIRE TO SEE PEOPLE
WAGE WAR AND DIE.

191
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:14,208
I ORDER YOU TO STOP
YOUR ATTACK ON THIS ISLAND

192
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:17,583
AND LEAVE AT ONCE!

193
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,125
- THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT.

194
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:23,375
WAR AND DEATH
DO NOT INTEREST HIM?

195
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,625
HE SEEMS CONSCIOUS,

196
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:25,833
BUT PERHAPS,

197
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,250
HE'S NOT YET AWARE.

198
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:30,625
IS THIS TRULY HIM?

199
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:34,875
IS THIS WHAT THEY CALL
HIS STATE OF REST?

200
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,583
- YOUR PRESENCE HAS
MADE ME ANGRY.

201
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,583
- WHAT THE--
WATCH IT, YOU BIG BRUTE!

202
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:01,708
- YOU'RE ONE TO TALK!

203
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,416
- MY GUARDIAN SAINT BEAST,

204
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,625
DEAR BELCUSAS, THE THUNDERCLAP.

205
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:12,416
- DID HE SAY,
"BELCUSAS THE THUNDERCLAP?"

206
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,333
- THAT'S A PRETTY
MANLY NICKNAME.

207
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,416
- ANGELS QUICKLY FLY FROM FATE,

208
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,916
ALAS, A DEVIL ALWAYS
LIES IN WAIT.

209
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,375
- I'M SICK OF YOUR ANGEL
AND DEVIL CRAP.

210
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,750
SO QUIT TALKING GARBAGE

211
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,291
AND COME FIGHT ME
LIKE A REAL MAN!

212
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,625
- BELCUSAS, GO GIVE THAT MAN

213
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,875
THE FIGHT HE SO DESIRES.

214
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,750
- I WAS TALKING TO YOU,
PRETTY BOY!

215
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:34,583
- FAIRY MACHINE GUN LEPRECHAUN!

216
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,041
NOT EVEN A SCRATCH?

217
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,583
- SO YOU LIKE MONSTERS, HUH?

218
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,083
TAKE OVER, BEAST SOUL!

219
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,125
HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

220
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,500
WOULD YOU HURRY UP AND JUST TURN
HIM TO STONE ALREADY?

221
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,333
- THAT ONLY WORKS
ON HUMANS, MEATHEAD!

222
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,916
- NOT HIM, YOU IDIOT.
I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE MAN.

223
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,958
DO YOUR WEIRD STATUE SPELL
ON HIM.

224
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,291
- IT WON'T WORK ON HIM

225
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,500
BECAUSE HE'S WEARING GLASSES.

226
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:02,958
- WHAT?
THAT'S THE LAMEST EXCUSE

227
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,500
I'VE EVER HEARD.
- I SHOULD USE IT ON YOU--

228
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,333
- SPARKS OF PASSION ERUPT
INTO FLAMES

229
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,833
BETWEEN THOSE IN LOVE.

230
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,875
- Both:
WE ARE NOT IN LOVE, OKAY?

231
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:14,125
- Evergreen: KEEP
THAT ONE BUSY FOR NOW.

232
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,458
- HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

233
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,500
- I'VE FIGURED OUT
HOW HIS MAGIC WORKS.

234
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,708
HE USE SUMMONING SPELLS
JUST LIKE LUCY.

235
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:24,375
AND ALL SUMMONING WIZARDS
HAVE ONE GLARING FLAW--

236
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,458
THEIR BODIES ARE WEAK!

237
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,416
- ( sneezes )

238
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,208
GOT YOU NOW...

239
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,875
- I AM LORD OF THE UNDERWORLD.

240
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:39,125
AND MY ARM IS A JET-BLACK SWORD
THAT CLEAVES THROUGH ALL.

241
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,333
AND YOU...

242
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,958
WILL FADE BEYOND THE DARKNESS!

243
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,250
- OH, NO.  EVERGREEN!

244
00:17:56,458 --> 00:18:01,166
THIS GUY'S MAGIC--
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

245
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,750
- I SUPPOSE THAT I COULD EXPLAIN
HOW IT WORKS,

246
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,083
BUT IT WOULD PROVE
FAR TOO DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND

247
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,791
FOR SCUM LIKE YOU.

248
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,208
- SAY WHAT?

249
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,625
- IT SPRINGS FROM A PLACE

250
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,958
VERY CLOSE TO THE DARKEST DEPTHS
OF MAGIC.

251
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,125
AND AS A RESULT, THE SIDE
EFFECTS IT BURDENS ME WITH

252
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,583
ARE EXTREMELY HEAVY
AND POWERFUL.

253
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,791
OH, I WALK THE PATH OF LIFE

254
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,166
LADEN WITH THE WEIGHT
OF TRAGEDY.

255
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,666
- UH...

256
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,333
- BUT NOW, WE'VE LEARNED
THE GREAT WIZARD ZEREF

257
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:28,791
IS ALMOST WITHIN OUR REACH.

258
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,916
HE WILL LIFT THIS TRAGIC BURDEN

259
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,125
FROM OUR SHOULDERS AND USHER IN
A NEW AND WONDROUS AGE.

260
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,666
- WAIT, THAT'S THE GUY
FROM EARLIER.

261
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,125
- ZEREF?

262
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:52,166
THE LEGENDARY BLACK WIZARD?

263
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,750
THAT WAS HIM?

264
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,916
BUT, HE SHOULDN'T BE ALIVE.

265
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,166
MUCH LESS ON THIS ISLAND.

266
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,916
- WE'LL ENTER
THE GRAND MAGIC WORLD.

267
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,875
- THE GRAND MAGIC WORLD?
BUT WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

268
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,625
- A TRUE AND PRIMAL REALM
RULED BY FEAR AND DARKNESS,

269
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,333
AS IT SHOULD RIGHTLY BE.

270
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,000
- RULED BY DARKNESS?

271
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:19,458
- A WIZARD'S PROVINCE,

272
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,958
WHERE THOSE WHO DO NOT SHARE
OUR ABILITIES PERISH

273
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:26,791
OR TREMBLE AS THEY PRAY
FOR DEATH.

274
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,500
ISN'T IT MARVELOUS?

275
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,083
A WORLD MADE
ENTIRELY FOR OUR KIND ALONE.

276
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,416
COMPLETELY FREE FROM THOSE
IGNORANT OR FRIGHTENED

277
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,875
OF THE BLACK ARTS.

278
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,333
- WHEN AT LAST ZEREF TAKES
HIS DESTINED PLACE AS RULER,

279
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:41,291
- THE GRAND MAGIC WORLD
WILL BE UPON US.

280
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,958
- THOSE WITHOUT MAGIC POWER
WILL BE ANNIHILATED.

281
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,166
AND WE SHALL INHERIT
THIS MAGICAL UTOPIA.

282
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,416
I'VE WAITED SO LONG
FOR THIS GLORIOUS DAY.

283
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,083
AND AT LAST,
IT'S DAWN IS SOON TO BREAK.

284
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,000
- NO WAY.

285
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,041
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

286
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,166
WHAT HE'S SAYING,

287
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,500
IT'S PURE MADNESS!

288
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,041
- WHAT IS THAT?

289
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:15,208
IF I TOUCH IT, IT WILL BORE
THROUGH ME, AS WELL.

290
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:19,375
OBTAINING LORD ZEREF
IS AT STAKE.

291
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,333
I HAVE TO TAKE THE RISK.

292
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,083
LOST MAGIC

293
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,500
FORWARD ARC OF TIME!

294
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:42,500
SPEEDING FORTH THE FLOW OF TIME,
I WILL TRAP YOU IN ITS COURSE!

295
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,291
I'VE GOT YOU.

296
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,750
- IT COMES.

297
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:54,500
THE PREDATORY DEATH.

298
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,000
- ARC OF TIME!

299
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,625
- PLEASE TELL ME
WHO YOU ARE.

300
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:43,833
- ( screaming )

301
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:47,500
LUMINOUS MINUTES!

302
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:03,833
ALTHOUGH YOUR FULL POWER
MAY BE THE STUFF OF LEGENDS,

303
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:07,333
NOW, THIS PITIFUL STATE YOU'RE
IN IS SIMPLY NO MATCH FOR ME.

304
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:13,791
DON'T YOU DARE TO UNDERESTIMATE
THE LEADER OF THE SEVEN KIN!

305
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:19,041
BUT LORD ZEREF, DO NOT WORRY.

306
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,708
FOR NOW WE POSSESS
ALL THE KEYS NECESSARY

307
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,291
TO AWAKEN YOU.

308
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:26,750
- PLEASE STOP.

309
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:35,208
- AT LONG LAST,

310
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:40,166
I HAVE HIM!  LORD ZEREF
IS IN MY HANDS!

311
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,291
- ( theme music playing )

312
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,250
- ( singing in Japanese )

313
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:14,000
- Happy:
WE ALL GOT SPLIT UP.

314
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:16,000
I REALLY HOPE EVERYONE
ELSE IS OKAY.

315
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:17,416
- Natsu:
I'M SURE ERZA AND GRAY ARE COOL.

316
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,458
AND LUCY ALWAYS SEEMS
TO GET BY SOMEHOW.

317
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,208
- Happy: ACTUALLY, ELFMAN IS THE
ONE I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT.

318
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:23,666
- Natsu:
I'D NEVER SAY IT TO HIS FACE

319
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,250
BUT HE KIND OF CRACKS
UNDER PRESSURE, HUH?

320
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,833
- Happy: YEAH, AND THE FACT THAT
HE'S OUT THERE WITH EVERGREEN

321
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:29,250
WORRIES ME TOO.  I MEAN,
THOSE THUNDER LEGION GUYS

322
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:30,458
CAN BE PRETTY WEIRD.

323
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:33,416
- Happy and Natsu: ...

324
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,750
- Natsu: MAYBE THEIR WEIRDNESS
WILL CANCEL EACH OTHER'S OUT

325
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:36,416
AND THEY WILL BE
AWESOME TOGETHER.

326
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,250
- Happy:
THEY'RE IN LOVE!

327
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:41,291
- Natsu: OH MAN, HAVEN'T
HEARD THAT ONE IN A WHILE!
