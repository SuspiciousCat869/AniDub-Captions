1
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:19,958
- Gray:
PREVIOUSLY, ON "FAIRY TAIL"...

2
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,833
- Happy: WE'RE IN
SERIOUS TROUBLE AGAIN.

3
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:23,541
NATSU'S TRAPPED
INSIDE OF A GIANT, FAKE DRAGON

4
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,333
AND IT'S USING HIM
LIKE A BATTERY.

5
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:26,875
- Lucy: WE'VE GOTTA GET HIM
OUTTA THAT THING,

6
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:29,000
BUT WE NEED
TO SAVE MAGNOLIA TOO.

7
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:31,041
I DON'T KNOW
IF WE CAN DO BOTH.

8
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,208
- Daphne: YES YES YES YES
YES YES YES YES!

9
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,791
THIS IS GONNA BE A REAL HOOT,
BOYS AND GIRLS.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,625
- ( theme music playing )

11
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,416
- ( singing in Japanese )

12
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,708
- Natsu: YOU GOTTA DESTROY
THIS THING WITH ME INSIDE!

13
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,291
- I DON'T THINK
THAT'S GOOD IDEA.

14
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,166
IF WE DO THAT,
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU?

15
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,583
- JUST DO IT, WOULD YA?

16
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:20,333
IF MAGNOLIA WERE TO END UP
GETTIN' FLATTENED BECAUSE OF ME,

17
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,250
I WON'T BE ABLE
TO LIVE WITH MYSELF!

18
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:25,958
- Alzack: NOTHING'S WORKING
ON THIS THING.

19
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,458
- Bisca: WHAT THE HECK
ARE WE GONNA DO?

20
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,541
- Levy: IT'S GONNA DESTROY
THE WHOLE CITY!

21
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:33,041
- PLEASE TELL ME YOU'VE GOT
SOME SORT OF STRATEGY IN MIND.

22
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,041
HEY, ERZA!

23
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:42,250
- ( Happy speaking )

24
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:46,541
- Gray: I WAS WORKING A JOB WHEN
I STARTED TO HEAR THE RUMORS

25
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,583
THAT THERE WAS SOMEONE TRYING TO
BUILD AN ARTIFICIAL DRAGON.

26
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,125
SO I DECIDED
TO LOOK INTO IT.

27
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,208
- AND THAT'S WHEN HAD YOUR
SECRET RENDEZVOUS

28
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,458
WITH THIS
RECKLESS FOOL?

29
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,958
- HER PLAN CENTERED ON SOMEHOW
CAPTURING NATSU

30
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,750
AND THEN USING HIM
TO POWER THIS FAKE DRAGON.

31
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,791
I DON'T THINK
SHE REALIZED IT THEN,

32
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,958
BUT SHE TOLD ME SOMETHING
THAT I THOUGHT WAS IMPORTANT.

33
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,416
ONCE IT STARTS,

34
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,333
THE ONLY WAY
TO STOP THE DRAGONOID

35
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,833
IS FOR A DRAGON SLAYER
TO ATTACK IT FROM THE INSIDE.

36
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,541
- Makarov: YES, THAT MIGHT
BE HELPFUL AT THIS POINT.

37
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:17,250
BUT YOU COULD HAVE PREVENTED IT
FROM EVER STARTING UP

38
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,791
IN THE FIRST PLACE IF YOU'D
NEVER HANDED OVER NATSU.

39
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,000
- Gray: I HAD TO.

40
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,791
YOU'RE MISSING PART
OF THE STORY, GRAMPS.

41
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,291
THERE'S ANOTHER CITY
COUNTING ON US.

42
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,291
IT WAS FOR THEIR SAKE.

43
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,250
- GO ON, MY BOY.

44
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,250
- HE MADE A PROMISE TO THE
PEOPLE IN THE CITY

45
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,500
WITHOUT SOUND,

46
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:33,916
BUT HE FORGOT ABOUT IT
'CAUSE HE'S AN IDIOT.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,750
SELF-CONTROL ISN'T EXACTLY
HIS STRONG SUIT, YA KNOW.

48
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,250
SO I USED TO CHECK UP
AFTER HE FINISHED A JOB

49
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,500
TO MAKE SURE
EVERYTHING WAS COOL.

50
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,666
WHENEVER ANYONE
MENTIONED IGNEEL,

51
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,333
HE'D GET DISTRACTED

52
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,041
AND COMPLETELY FORGET
ABOUT THE TASK AT HAND.

53
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,625
- SO YOU FEEL THE NEED
TO TELL HIM

54
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,541
WHILE FINDING IGNEEL
IS IMPORTANT,

55
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,833
FULFILLING HIS OBLIGATION
TO THE GUILD

56
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,125
IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT, HUH?

57
00:03:56,208 --> 00:04:01,041
- I NEVER HAD THE CHANCE
TO PROVE MYSELF TO UR.

58
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,958
BUT THERE'S NO LIMIT FOR HIM.

59
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:07,208
EVERY CHALLENGE THAT'S PUT
BEFORE HIM, HE OVERCOMES.

60
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:10,708
I KNOW IF HE EVER FOUND HIM,
HE WOULD BEAT IGNEEL.

61
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,416
HE ALWAYS HAS THAT.

62
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,208
HE CAN ALWAYS BE READY
FOR THAT DAY.

63
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,166
HE NEEDS
TO GET STRONGER AND STRONGER.

64
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,250
HE'S THE ONE PERSON
I NEED TO PROVE MYSELF TO!

65
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,708
BUT I MESSED UP.

66
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,291
I THOUGHT HE'D HAVE NO PROBLEM
BEATING THIS CHICK

67
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,666
AND HER FAKE DRAGON.

68
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,583
LET ME CLEAN THIS UP.
PLEASE.

69
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:35,416
- ( sighs )
VERY WELL THEN.

70
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,125
BUT YOU MUST PROMISE
TO DO EXACTLY AS I TELL YOU.

71
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,583
- AH!
THIS IS SUCH A RUSH!

72
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,375
THIS POWER ROCKS.

73
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,166
IT REALLY TAKES ME BACK!

74
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,791
MEMORIES.

75
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:59,125
I'LL NEVER FORGET
WHAT I SAW THAT DAY.

76
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,375
HOW IT MADE ME FEEL.

77
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,875
IT WAS AMAZING.

78
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:08,625
SO MAJESTIC AND POWERFUL.

79
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,125
SO FEROCIOUS.

80
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:15,916
IT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING
I HAD EVER SEEN.

81
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:21,791
I KEPT WAITING FOR IT
TO COME BACK, BUT IT NEVER DID.

82
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,791
SO I THOUGHT IF I EVER WANTED
TO SEE ONE AGAIN,

83
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,750
I'D HAVE TO MAKE IT MYSELF.

84
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,875
( laughing )

85
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,125
- ALL RIGHT LADY, I'VE HAD
ABOUT ENOUGH OF THIS CRAP!

86
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,625
YOU THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WAITIN' AROUND FOR A DRAGON?

87
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,208
I AM TOO.

88
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,666
NOT TO MENTION
GAJEEL AND WENDY!

89
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,458
WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT!

90
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,416
- EVERYONE SAID
I JUST MADE IT UP.

91
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,125
"THERE'S NO SUCH THING,"
THEY SAID.

92
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,875
"YOU'RE CRAZY,"
THEY SAID.

93
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,250
WHAT I SAW WAS REAL!

94
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,666
NO MATTER WHAT I SAID,
NO ONE EVER BELIEVED ME.

95
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,250
FIRST THEY LAUGHED AT ME,

96
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,833
THEN THEY
JUST TURNED THEIR BACKS.

97
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,166
THEY TRIED TO TELL ME
DRAGONS NEVER EXISTED.

98
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,208
BUT I KNEW
THAT ALL OF THEM WERE WRONG.

99
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,791
IT WAS SO FRUSTRATING.

100
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,250
I'M SURE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND.

101
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,791
YES YES.  BUT NOW
I CAN FINALLY SHOW THEM!

102
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,916
I HAVE A DRAGON
THAT EVERYONE CAN SEE.

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,125
- WELL, IT'S OFFICIAL,
THIS GIRL'S GOT MAJOR PROBLEMS.

104
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,625
- THE WHOLE THING'S CRAZY.

105
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,125
- THE FIRST THING I'LL SHOW THEM
IS HOW MY DRAGONOID

106
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,333
CAN WIPE OUT A CITY,

107
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:22,166
AND THEN AN ENTIRE COUNTRY!

108
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,375
- GRAY!

109
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:30,000
- OKAY, I'LL BE THE FIRST
TO ADMIT I SCREWED UP.

110
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,416
BUT I NEED ALL YOU GUYS
TO LISTEN TO ME.

111
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,666
EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY NOT
BELIEVE WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.

112
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,458
- NO, COME ON!

113
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,291
WHATEVER HAPPENS,
I CAN'T LET MYSELF PASS OUT!

114
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:44,416
- Natsu's voice: NAW,
IT'S POINTLESS, MAN.

115
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,458
YOU SHOULD JUST GIVE UP NOW.

116
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:46,708
- Natsu's voice:
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.

117
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,291
YOU'RE STILL IN THIS.
DON'T GIVE UP.

118
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,416
- WHO'S THERE?

119
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,041
- GIVE ME A BREAK. LIKE YOU KNOW
WHAT DAPHNE'S TALKING ABOUT.

120
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,833
- HEY, I'M NOT
THE BAD GUY HERE.

121
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,791
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO FORGOT
THE PROMISE WE MADE.

122
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,750
- NO WAY!

123
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,541
- JUST 6% TO GO.

124
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,500
THAT MEANS
WE'RE ALMOST AT FULL POWER!

125
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,833
YES YES YES YES!

126
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,833
- HUH?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

127
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,083
HOW COULD HE
FORGET SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

128
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,708
- I SWEAR.

129
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,791
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,
HE JUST NEVER LEARNS.

130
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,375
- I'M SO RELIEVED!

131
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,916
I KNEW MY BELOVED GRAY
WOULD ALWAYS BE TRUE!

132
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,625
- Gray: THIS WAS THE ONLY WAY
I COULD THINK OF

133
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,458
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.
BUT BEFORE WE CAN DO THAT,

134
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,875
WE'VE GOTTA DEAL WITH DAPHNE
AND HER MONSTER.

135
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,791
- AND WHAT DO YOU
PROPOSE WE DO?

136
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,708
- Wendy: THERE'S SOMEONE HURT
OVER THERE!

137
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,208
- Erza:
THE MAN FROM THE CAKE SHOP.

138
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,125
- WE CAN'T
JUST LEAVE HIM LIKE THAT.

139
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,958
- COVER US!
- WE GOT HIM!

140
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:40,000
- Daphne: YES YES!
LIZARDMEN 3.1, GO!

141
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,541
- AW, MAN, SHE'S GOT A TON
OF THESE BABIES.

142
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,125
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING,
BEING OUT LIKE THIS?

143
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,666
- MY SHOP,
IT'S AS FLAT AS A PANCAKE.

144
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,833
BUT I WAS ABLE
TO SAVE THIS FOR YOU.

145
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,916
- SO YOU
PUT YOUR LIFE IN DANGER.

146
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,416
- THIS WAS A GIFT
FOR YOUR NEW FRIENDS, RIGHT?

147
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,708
WE CAN'T LET THIS MONSTER
MAKE US FORGET

148
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,791
WHAT IS TRULY IMPORTANT.

149
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,708
- DON'T WORRY,
I CAN HEAL HIM.

150
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,541
- DON'T BE FOOLISH, WENDY.
YOU DON'T HAVE THE POWER.

151
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,666
- I'LL BE FINE.
I TOOK A LITTLE BREAK EARLIER.

152
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,250
- ARE YOU SURE
THAT YOU'RE UP FOR IT?

153
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,166
- POSITIVE.

154
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,583
UM, I CAN'T STAND
THE TASTE OF PICKLED PLUMS.

155
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:20,125
- PICKLED PLUMS? - I MEAN,
I KNOW THEY'RE GOOD FOR YOU.

156
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,041
BUT I WON'T EAT 'EM.
IT'S KINDA LIKE MY WEAKNESS.

157
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,125
EVERYONE'S GOT ONE,
YA KNOW?

158
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:28,750
I'M STILL NEW TO FAIRY TAIL,
AND I'VE GOT A LOT TO LEARN.

159
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,541
THERE'S A BUNCH OF THINGS
I NEED TO DO

160
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,125
TO BE PART OF THE GUILD.

161
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,000
I WANNA GO THROUGH MORE STUFF
WITH YOU GUYS,

162
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:38,208
TO LAUGH AND CRY,
GET MAD TOGETHER,

163
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,666
TO GO ON MORE ADVENTURES.

164
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,458
AND I REALLY WANNA GET BETTER
AT HIGH FIVING WITH NATSU.

165
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,875
SO YOU GOTTA SAVE HIM
FOR ME.

166
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,291
- HEY.
- WENDY!  I KNEW IT.

167
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:56,208
YOU SHOULD'VE LISTENED
TO ME, CHILD.

168
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:01,583
- IT'S OKAY. SHE JUST NEEDS
TO REST FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

169
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:05,708
BUT SHE'S AWFULLY LOW
ON MAGIC POWER.

170
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,625
- SURELY MASTER KNOWS NATSU'S
THE ONLY ONE

171
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,500
WHO CAN DEFEAT THAT ATROCITY.

172
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,208
WHY DOES HE STILL WANT US
TO ATTACK IT?

173
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,666
OF COURSE.

174
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,541
- GRAMPS TOLD ME
WHAT WE NEED TO DO.

175
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,791
- I ALREADY KNOW.
I'VE FIGURED IT OUT.

176
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,583
I NEED ALL OF YOU
TO GO AT THE LIZARDMEN

177
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,041
WITH EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT.

178
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,375
I SHALL TAKE CARE
OF THE DRAGONOID.

179
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,666
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

180
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,833
- NATSU'S STILL
INSIDE THAT THING.

181
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,416
- THIS IS OUR MASTER'S WILL,

182
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,000
THEREFORE IT IS THE WILL
OF THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD.

183
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,708
LISTEN.

184
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,916
WE MUST PROTECT THE CITY
NO MATTER THE COST.

185
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,750
IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY PRIDE,

186
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,875
WE MUST BE PREPARED
TO DEFEND IT WITH OUR LIVES.

187
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,041
- ERZA.
- SHE'S GOT A POINT.

188
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:49,333
AND I'M A FAIRY TAIL WIZARD
JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

189
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,791
SO...
- BRAVE TOM CAT.

190
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,041
- All: LET'S DO THIS!

191
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,041
- I NEED YOU TO COME WITH ME,
JUVIA.

192
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,833
- HEAVEN'S WHEEL!

193
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,291
SCATTERED PETALS!

194
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,666
- YES YES, THROW
ALL YOUR PUNY ATTACKS AT ME.

195
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,458
YOU'LL JUST WEAR YOURSELF OUT.

196
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,500
ONLY 3% MORE TO GO

197
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,833
UNTIL IT'S FULLY CHARGED!

198
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,291
- WHERE IS IT?

199
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,291
THERE HAS TO BE A WEAK POINT.
BUT WHERE?

200
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,916
- Happy: NATSU.

201
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,958
YOU KNOW
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND,

202
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:25,625
BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT I'M
GONNA BE ABLE TO SAVE YOU.

203
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,041
- Juvia: NOW WHAT, MY LOVE?

204
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,666
- WE SHOULD BE IN THAT THING'S
BLIND SPOT OVER HERE.

205
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,291
SHE WON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HIT HER.

206
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,541
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

207
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:40,291
- JUVIA, I NEED THE KINDA HELP
ONLY YOU CAN GIVE ME.

208
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,000
IF WE CAN PULL THIS OFF,

209
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,166
NATSU MAY JUST MAKE IT
OUTTA THERE ALIVE.

210
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,333
I CAN'T IMAGINE IT
ANY OTHER WAY.

211
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:50,000
YOU CAN'T HAVE FAIRY TAIL
WITHOUT NATSU.

212
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,041
THAT'S NOT
EVEN A POSSIBILITY.

213
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,541
- YOU'RE SO PASSIONATE!

214
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:58,625
- WE'RE DOING A UNISON RAID.

215
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,625
- YEEHAW!

216
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,083
- EAT THIS!

217
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,833
- MOOOOOO!

218
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,541
- YOU CAN'T
RUN OUTTA POWER, LUCY.

219
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,000
NOT NOW!

220
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,750
- Carla: THERE'S SOMETHING

221
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,458
THAT'S BEEN BOTHERING ME
FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW.

222
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,000
I FEEL LIKE
I'VE SEEN THIS THING BEFORE.

223
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,750
IN FACT, I'M SURE OF IT.

224
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,875
- AHHH!

225
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,625
- THAT'S SO LOUD!
- Natsu: ARGGH!

226
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:35,125
HELP, YOU GUYS.
YOU GOTTA STOP ME!

227
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:39,000
I MEAN, YOU'LL NEVER STOP ME.
I'M GONNA DESTROY EVERYTHING!

228
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,083
- I THINK HE'S STARTING
TO CRACK UP.

229
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,125
- Bixlow:
I SEE WHAT'S GOIN' ON.

230
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,625
HE'S AT THE BREAKING POINT.

231
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,541
I CAN TELL
THAT DRAGONOID MONSTER

232
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,125
IS DANGEROUSLY CLOSE
TO COMPLETELY

233
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,125
ABSORBING
NATSU'S SPIRIT.

234
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,625
- Natsu: DESTROY!

235
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,791
WAIT, I MEAN DESTROY ME!

236
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,083
AW, MAN, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M THINKIN' ANYMORE.

237
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,541
- NATSU!

238
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,750
GET OUT OF MY WAY!

239
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,041
- WOW, LOOK AT THAT.

240
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,875
ERZA'S PRETTY FIRED UP
RIGHT NOW.

241
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,416
- YOU COULD SAY THAT AGAIN,

242
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,250
I GUESS WE'LL JUST
HAVE TO DESTROY HER TOO.

243
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,041
- YOU'RE CRAZY, MAN.
SHE'S A GOOD FRIEND OF OURS.

244
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,375
- DON'T BE SO SOFT.
LET'S PUT HER ON THE GROUND.

245
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,708
- WOULD YOU TWO SHUT UP?!

246
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,833
IF YOU'RE GONNA ARGUE, AT LEAST
GET OUT OF MY HEAD FIRST!

247
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,375
- Mirajane: OH, DEAR.
SOUNDS LIKE HE MIGHT

248
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,625
HAVE A SCREW LOOSE.

249
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,666
- Happy: I WAS AFRAID
THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

250
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,125
NATSU'S FINALLY STARTING TO FEEL
THE EFFECTS OF NIRVANA'S MAGIC.

251
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,750
- THAT'S NOT WHAT'S GOING ON.

252
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,000
- Gray: WE'VE GOTTA HELP ERZA.

253
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,750
SO LET'S TAKE OUT
ALL THOSE LIZARDS IN ONE SHOT.

254
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,750
- CAN WE DO THAT?
- YEAH, WE'RE ICE AND WATER.

255
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,958
THE FIRST TIME
YOU AND I FOUGHT,

256
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,916
I REMEMBER THINKING OUR
STYLES OF MAGIC WOULD

257
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,166
COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER.

258
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,666
- REALLY? - I KNOW WE
CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN,

259
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,958
BUT IT MEANS WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER.

260
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,916
SO WILL YOU HELP ME OUT?
PLEASE?

261
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,916
- I WILL.

262
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,541
- Both: MAGIC FUSION!

263
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,250
- UNISON RAID!

264
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,583
- All: WHAT'S HAPPENING?!

265
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,375
- IT'S LIKE A HUGE CURTAIN
OF ICE.

266
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,541
- THEY'RE STARTIN' TO VANISH.
- IS IT 'CAUSE OF THE ICICLES?

267
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,125
- Natsu: WHOA!
THAT'S COLD.

268
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,916
- THIS MAGIC POWER FEELS KIND
OF FAMILIAR FOR SOME REASON.

269
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,791
- I THINK IT'S AN ICE-AND-WATER
UNISON RAID.

270
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,500
- DID GRAY AND JUVIA
DO THIS TOGETHER?

271
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,416
- THOSE TWO MUST BE IN LOOOVE!

272
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,541
- THIS IS AMAZING.

273
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,083
- Gray: THANKS A LOT, JUVIA.

274
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:51,416
- IT MAKES ME SO HAPPY

275
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,458
TO KNOW THAT YOU'D PUT
EVERYTHING ON THE LINE

276
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,833
TO SAVE YOUR FRIENDS.

277
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:59,000
OH, GRAY, I LOVE--

278
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,791
WHAT?
DON'T RUN AWAY FROM ME!

279
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,750
- THERE HE GOES AGAIN.

280
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,458
HE'S ALWAYS TRYING TO STEAL
THE SPOTLIGHT FROM ME.

281
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,041
- HE CAN'T HELP
THAT HE'S AWESOME.

282
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,916
- WE SHOULD GIVE THAT LOSER
A STOMPIN'.

283
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,708
- SHUT UP!

284
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,208
THIS IS MAKING ME SO MAD.

285
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,916
I SHOULD
JUST CRUSH EVERYTHING!

286
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,750
NO, I SHOULDN'T.
YES, I SHOULD.

287
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,625
WHAT THE HECK'S WRONG
WITH ME?

288
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,833
- I THINK
HE'S FINALLY GONE NUTS.

289
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,500
- SHORT TRIP,
IF YOU ASK ME.

290
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,750
- LISTEN UP,
YA PINK-HAIRED FREAK!

291
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,291
- All: WHAT'D YOU SAY?

292
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,250
- ARE YOU SERIOUSLY
THAT HELPLESS, MAN?

293
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,500
IT'S PATHETIC.
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN

294
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,083
YOU WERE NOTHIN' BUT A BUNCH
OF HOT AIR!

295
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,125
WE'RE GETTIN' REAL TIRED OF
THIS LAME COMEDY ROUTINE

296
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,291
YOU'RE DOING IN THERE,

297
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,500
SO MAN UP ALREADY.
- COOL IT, FREEZER BURN!

298
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,208
- THIS ISN'T THE TIME
TO BE MEAN TO EACH OTHER.

299
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:46,208
- YOU KNOW A REAL FAIRY TAIL
WIZARD NEVER FORGETS A PROMISE.

300
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,750
YOU'RE MAKING THE GUILD LOOK
LIKE WE'RE A BUNCH OF LIARS.

301
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,791
YOU SHOULD SHOW 'EM
HOW WE REALLY DO IT.

302
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,208
SMASH THAT THING
TO SMITHEREENS.

303
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,333
- YES YES!

304
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,625
SO YOU FINALLY REVEAL
YOUR TRUE PLAN, GRAY FULLBUSTER.

305
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,875
BUT YOU'RE WAY TOO LATE
TO THE PARTY.

306
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,625
YOUR FRIEND SALAMANDER
IS ALMOST COMPLETELY

307
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:03,958
ABSORBED INTO MY CREATION.

308
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:07,625
HIS SPIRIT AND MAGIC POWER
WILL SOON BE ALL MINE!

309
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,291
- I'D ALREADY HAVE SMASHED
THIS THING IF I COULD.

310
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,833
- WE SHOULD BE SMASHING
THAT STUPID, SHIRTLESS JERK.

311
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:16,875
- I AM SUPER DISAPPOINTED
IN YOU, NATSU! - WHAT?

312
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,250
- I MEAN, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
I THOUGHT YOU'RE THE KINDA GUY

313
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:22,125
THAT CRUSHED WHATEVER TROUBLE
YOU RAN INTO, NO MATTER WHAT!

314
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:25,083
BUT NOW YOU'RE JUST GONNA
LET THIS FAKE DRAGON BEAT YOU?

315
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,875
- COME ON.
HELP US OUT!

316
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,750
EVERYONE IN FAIRY TAIL
NEEDS YOU RIGHT NOW,

317
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,208
AND YOU'RE JUST GONNA GIVE UP?

318
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,916
WE ALL EXPECTED
A WHOLE LOT MORE OUTTA YOU.

319
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,458
BUT I GUESS YOU JUST DECIDED
TO TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT

320
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,291
AND LET THIS THING WIN!
- WHAT?

321
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,666
OH!
GIVE ME A BREAK, LUCY.

322
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,708
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GET SO PERSONAL.

323
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,916
- THAT'S TOTALLY UNCALLED FOR.
- ADD HER TO THE STOMPIN' LIST.

324
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,500
- THEY'RE RIGHT, NATSU.

325
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,291
I KNOW YOU GOT CAUGHT OFF GUARD
AT FIRST,

326
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:49,416
BUT YOU LOST HEART SO QUICKLY.
- NO, I DIDN'T.

327
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,833
- Natsu's voices: YEAH, I GIVE
UP. - NO, NEVER!

328
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,750
- YOU SAID TO DESTROY IT
WITH YOU INSIDE.

329
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,041
THAT'S THE VERY DEFINITION
OF LOSING HEART.

330
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,291
IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN A
PITIFULLY EMBARRASSING

331
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,500
DISPLAY OF WEAKNESS.

332
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,791
ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU
WHAT YOU'VE ASKED FOR--

333
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,000
I'LL PUT YOU
OUT OF YOUR MISERY MYSELF.

334
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,208
- I GOTTA ADMIT,
I DIDN'T SEE THAT ONE COMING.

335
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,875
- OH, MAN.
THERE'S NOT MUCH TIME LEFT.

336
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:13,375
THE DRAGONOID IS ABOUT TO
ABSORB ALL OF NATSU'S SPIRIT.

337
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,541
- GIVE ME YOUR BEST SHOT!

338
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,291
- AHHH!

339
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,875
- Daphne: YES YES YES!

340
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,291
I LOST ALL MY LIZARDMEN,

341
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,458
BUT THIS GLORIOUS POWER
MAKES UP FOR IT.

342
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,166
- Natsu: WHOA! ( laughs )

343
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,291
- IF YOU CAN'T MUSTER
THE CONFIDENCE

344
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,541
TO VALUE YOUR OWN LIFE,

345
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,875
FAIRY TAIL HAS NO NEED FOR
YOU. - SAY WHAT?!

346
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,791
- I'M SURE IF YOUR PRECIOUS
DRAGON EVER SAW YOU AGAIN,

347
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,875
HE'D BE ASHAMED
OF WHAT YOU'VE BECOME.

348
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,583
IF HE HAD ANY KIND OF PRIDE,

349
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,833
HE'D BEAT YOU SENSELESS
FOR DISGRACING HIS LEGACY.

350
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,958
- THIS ENDS NOW!

351
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,041
- Both: OOH, I BET
WITH THIS KIND OF POWER,

352
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,708
WE CAN FINALLY BEAT ERZA!

353
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,916
- YOU AND ME, RED!
IT'S TIME TO PARTY.

354
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,750
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS DAY FOR A LONG TIME!

355
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,708
- GOOD OL' NATSU. IT'S JUST
TOO EASY TO FIGURE HIM OUT.

356
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,583
- YEAH.
THAT'S IT, BUDDY,

357
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,958
YOU'RE STARTING TO SOUND
MORE LIKE YOURSELF AGAIN.

358
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,375
- OH, YEAH.

359
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:09,958
- I FAIL TO SEE
WHY THIS IS A GOOD THING.

360
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,458
- DOG MY CATS!

361
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,375
KEEP IT UNDER CONTROL,
YA HEAR.

362
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,000
- Natsu: YEAH!  HA HA!

363
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,666
YOU KNOW YOU'RE AFRAID
OF ME NOW, ERZA!

364
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,250
- DON'T EVER PRESUME
TO BE BETTER THAN ME!

365
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,708
- Both: WHOA!
SHE'S SUPER SCARY.

366
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,291
- Erza: IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH.

367
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,708
- Gray: DON'T TELL ME
THAT'S ALL SHE'S GOT.

368
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,541
- AHHH!

369
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:35,375
I AIN'T DONE PLAYIN' AROUND
WITH YOU!

370
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:38,916
- NO NO NO! THERE IS WAY TOO
MUCH POWER BEING ABSORBED.

371
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
JEEZ.
WHAT IS GOING ON?

372
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:44,416
- ALL OF YOUR TRASH TALKIN' HAS
GOT ME MORE FIRED UP THAN EVER!

373
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,333
- HE'S CONJURED THE FLAMES
OF EMOTION.

374
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,041
- All: NO WAY.

375
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,666
- POOR GUY.

376
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,208
- Gajeel:
MAN, THAT KID'S AN IDIOT.

377
00:17:56,291 --> 00:18:00,083
I TRIED TO WARN HIM THIS
KIND OF THING MIGHT HAPPEN.

378
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,916
I MEAN, I EXPECT HIM
TO BE A HOTHEADED LOUDMOUTH,

379
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,250
BUT THIS IS TAKIN' IT
WAY TOO FAR.

380
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,500
- GAJEEL!

381
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,125
- IT'S TIME
TO MAKE HIM SHUT UP.

382
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,916
- OH YEAH?!
- QUIT BEING A NUISANCE!

383
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,291
DRAGON SLAYER SECRET ART!

384
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,458
KARMIC DEMON-- IRON SPIRAL!

385
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:31,166
- GAJEEL.
- YOU'RE LUCKY.

386
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,208
THIS DIDN'T WORK OUT
THE WAY I'D PLANNED.

387
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,083
I WAS HOPIN' TO SNEAK UP IN
THE MIDDLE OF ALL THE CONFUSION

388
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,458
AND BEAT THE EVER-LOVIN' SNOT
OUT OF YA.

389
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,291
- IS THAT SO?

390
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:45,041
- HEY, LUCY!
CALL UP YOUR WEIRD HORSE GUY.

391
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,375
WE NEED TO GET SOME FLAMING
ARROWS OVER HERE A.S.A.P.

392
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,958
- GOOD THINKING!

393
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,958
OPEN--
GATE OF THE ARCHER!

394
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,958
- HOWDY DO, MY GOOD LADY?

395
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,541
- ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS,

396
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,583
WE NEED TO COME UP
WITH AS MUCH FIRE AS WE CAN.

397
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,541
- YEAH, YOU BET.
- <i>OUI.</i>

398
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,916
- AND THEN WE'RE GONNA
GIVE ALL OF IT TO NATSU.

399
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,666
- FIRE IT UP.
- YEP.

400
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,708
- COUNT ME IN.

401
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:10,125
- THE PERFECT OCCASION
FOR MY FLAME EMPRESS ARMOR.

402
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:14,083
- IT'S ALL YOU, SAGITTARIUS!
- OKEY-DOKE.

403
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,000
- HOLD ON!
I CALL TIME OUT.

404
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,250
IF I GET ANY MORE POWER,
THIS THING'LL BLOW SKY HIGH.

405
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,375
- THAT BONE-HEADED CHICK
HAS TARNISHED

406
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,041
THE DRAGON'S REPUTATION
FOR NOBILITY AND GRACE.

407
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,166
SO TEACH HER A LESSON
SHE WON'T FORGET.

408
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,166
- THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

409
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,375
- ALL RIGHT NOW, FIRE AWAY!
- YES INDEEDY.

410
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,000
HEADS UP.

411
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:35,333
- SOLID SCRIPT MAGIC,
HEAT SPELL!

412
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:38,750
- REQUIP!
- GUNS MAGIC BLAST SHOT!

413
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,000
- <i>OUI!</i>

414
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,416
- EXPLOSIVE FLAME!
- HEY, NATSU!

415
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,625
I TOLD YOU I OWED YA ONE!
- AHHH!

416
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,125
- THERE YA GO, NATSU!
EAT UP.

417
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:57,541
- AHHH!
- AHHH!

418
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,833
NOW I'VE GOT A MAJOR FIRE
IN MY BELLY.

419
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,291
I'M ALL FIRED UP!

420
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,166
- Makarov:
HIS MOST POWERFUL DRIVING FORCE

421
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,083
WILL ALWAYS BE
HIS RIGHTEOUS ANGER.

422
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,625
- OH HI, MASTER.

423
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:25,125
- IF YOU WANT NATSU
TO PUSH THROUGH,

424
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,791
TO TRIUMPH OVER ADVERSITY,

425
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:30,958
TO OVERCOME ANY OBSTACLE
HE MAY FACE, MAKE HIM MAD.

426
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:34,458
IT'S A SURE-FIRE WAY TO
GIVE HIM THE PROPER MOTIVATION.

427
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,375
- Lucy:
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

428
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,458
- Happy: THAT'S WHAT
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO.

429
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:41,875
- Makarov: I TOLD GRAY TO
MAKE NATSU EXTREMELY ANGRY,

430
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:45,250
AND IT SEEMS THAT ERZA
FIGURED IT OUT ON HER OWN.

431
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:48,333
YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE
A FAIRY TAIL WIZARD IN ACTION,

432
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:51,375
CARRYING OUT OUR MOST
SACRED DUTY AS A GUILD--

433
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,416
ERADICATING EVIL.

434
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,541
- Natsu: YOU SAY YOU WANT TO
SEE A DRAGON, HUH?

435
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,583
I'M GONNA SHOW YA
WHAT AN ANGRY ONE LOOKS LIKE!

436
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,958
- AHH!
- LET'S SEE YOU TRY TO PULL

437
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,666
THAT LITTLE VANISHING ACT AGAIN,
FOUR EYES.

438
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,291
MY SENSES ARE SHARPER NOW
THAN THEY'VE EVER BEEN.

439
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,333
AND I GOT SO MUCH POWER
RUNNIN' THROUGH ME,

440
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,458
I JUST MIGHT EXPLODE.

441
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:17,708
- AT LAST
I GET TO SEE IT AGAIN.

442
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:20,416
- YOU OWE IGNEEL
A BIG APOLOGY,

443
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,041
YOU STUPID DRAGON WANNABE!

444
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,666
- FINALLY,
DAPHNE'S CURSE IS BROKEN!

445
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,000
- I HAD FAITH
THIS WOULD HAPPEN SOMEDAY.

446
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,583
WE HAD THE WORD
OF A FAIRY TAIL WIZARD.

447
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:41,500
- WHEREVER YOU ARE, IGNEEL,
I HOPE YOU SAW THAT.

448
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,208
- WELL, GUYS, LOOKS LIKE
THE DRAGONOID'S WEAKNESS...

449
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:47,125
- ...WAS AN UNSTABLE POWER
SOURCE KNOWN AS NATSU.

450
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,625
- FUNNY HOW THAT WORKED OUT,
ISN'T IT?

451
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,500
- WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA
WITH YOU PUTTING ME

452
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,000
THROUGH ALL THAT, GRAY?!

453
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,833
- IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT FOR
GOING AROUND BREAKIN' PROMISES!

454
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,625
- ( all laughing )

455
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,833
- Lucy: WE MAY FIGHT
AND DISAGREE SOMETIMES,

456

EVERY SINGLE MEMBER
HAS THEIR OWN ROLE TO PLAY.

AND IF YOU'RE
EVER IN NEED OF HELP,

SHE NEEDS TO KNOW
HOW YOU DO THINGS.
