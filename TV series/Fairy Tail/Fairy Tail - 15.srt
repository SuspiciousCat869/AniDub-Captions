1
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:19,958
- HEY, GUYS, READY FOR 
SOME MORE "FAIRY TAIL"?

2
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,666
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING,

3
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,333
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE ROOM.

4
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:26,333
AND DON'T SIT TOO CLOSE
TO THE TV.

5
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:29,041
- Happy:
PREVIOUSLY ON "FAIRY TAIL"...

6
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,000
- YOU THREE HAVE BETRAYED
MASTER MAKAROV.

7
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,708
- Happy:
WE MET LYON AND HIS LACKEYS,

8
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,791
WHO WERE TRYING TO
REVIVE DELIORA.

9
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,375
BUT BEFORE WE COULD STOP THEM,

10
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,416
THE GREAT ERZA CAME TO
TAKE US BACK TO THE GUILD.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,291
- Lucy: THE GREAT?
- Happy: THEN NATSU STORMED

12
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:41,916
THE OLD TEMPLE TO STOP LYON
FROM FINISHING

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,375
THE MOON DRIP CEREMONY.

14
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:46,500
- Lucy:
I HOPE HE'S GONNA BE OKAY.

15
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,916
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

16
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,708
- HUH?

17
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:22,125
- THE TRUTH IS
UR'S STILL ALIVE.

18
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,458
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:26,458
- IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS.

20
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,000
DELIORA ATTACKED MY HOMETOWN.

21
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,833
I'VE NEVER SEEN
SUCH DESTRUCTION.

22
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,625
THE WHOLE PLACE WAS WIPED OUT
IN LESS THAN A DAY.

23
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:56,541
- I'VE HEARD OF DELIORA'S
DESTRUCTIVE POWER,

24
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,416
BUT I NEVER
EXPECTED THIS.

25
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,416
- ( groans )

26
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,791
- LYON!

27
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,791
GET OVER HERE!
WE'VE GOT A SURVIVOR!

28
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,125
- ( gasps )

29
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,291
HEY!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

30
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,625
- ( exhales )

31
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,625
( breathes deeply )

32
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,000
- UR AND LYON FOUND ME.

33
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,000
THEY PULLED ME FROM THE RUBBLE.

34
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,750
- DELIORA, YOU'RE GONNA
PAY FOR THIS.

35
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:34,666
I'LL STOP YOU, I SWEAR IT.

36
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,083
( cries )

37
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,125
- THAT VOW...

38
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,000
IS HOW IT ALL BEGAN.

39
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,250
- ( Happy speaking )

40
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,500
- ( panting )

41
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,916
- ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE
TO KEEP UP, GRAY?

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,958
I WARNED YOU,
TRAINING WITH ME CAN BE TOUGH.

43
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,583
- YEAH, BUT I'LL DO 
WHATEVER IT TAKES!

44
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,250
I HAVE TO BECOME STRONGER
THAN DELIORA,

45
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,666
'CAUSE SOME DAY,
I'M GONNA BEAT HIM!

46
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,250
- YEAH, RIGHT.

47
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,583
- OKAY.
LET'S GET STARTED.

48
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,791
- FINE!
READY WHEN YOU ARE.

49
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,416
AAH!  WHOA!

50
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,208
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

51
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,083
- THE FIRST STEP IS TO STRIP.
- ARE YOU KIDDIN' ME?!

52
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,708
YOU'RE CRAZY IF YOU THINK 
I'M STRIPPING IN THE SNOW!

53
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:34,958
BACK ME UP, LYON!

54
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,208
NOW YOU'RE NAKED TOO?!

55
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,666
- JUST HURRY UP AND DO IT, KID.

56
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,208
COME ON.
YOU WANNA LEARN MAGIC, RIGHT?

57
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,833
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE MAKING ME DO THIS!

58
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,416
IT BETTER NOT BE
SOME KINDA JOKE!

59
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,541
- ATTABOY, GRAY.

60
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,208
IF YOU REALLY WANNA
CONTROL THE COLD,

61
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,791
THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO
BECOME ONE WITH IT.

62
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,250
YOU'LL GET USED TO IT SOON.

63
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,750
- I ALREADY HAVE.

64
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,625
- YOU'RE SHIVERING
JUST AS MUCH AS I AM.

65
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,208
- LET'S GO, BOYS.

66
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,333
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE 
GONNA TEACH ME MAGIC!

67
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,708
- JUST RUN!

68
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,750
I DON'T WANNA DO THIS
BEGINNER STUFF AGAIN EITHER!

69
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,333
- HMM?

70
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,291
- I PRACTICE MAKER MAGIC.

71
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,291
OUT OF ALL THE MAGICAL ARTS,

72
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,291
I FEEL THIS ONE GIVES YOU 
THE MOST CREATIVE FREEDOM.

73
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,666
- AAH!

74
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,333
- ( chuckles )

75
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:38,666
AAH!
- IN FACT...

76
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,166
EVERY WIZARD WHO
PRACTICES MAKER MAGIC

77
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,083
HAS THEIR OWN UNIQUE STYLE.

78
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,500
IF YOU TRAIN HARD...

79
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:57,666
...THEN SOMEDAY, YOU'LL CREATE
A STYLE ALL YOUR OWN.

80
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,541
- WHO'S THE DARK-HAIRED BOY?
YOU PICK UP ANOTHER STUDENT?

81
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,291
- YEAH, HIS NAME'S GRAY.

82
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,291
HE'S A REBEL AND DOESN'T
WANNA DO WHAT HE'S TOLD.

83
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,125
- THE OTHER BOY'S NAMED LYON,
RIGHT?

84
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,625
I BET WHEN
THOSE TWO GROW UP

85
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,125
THEY'RE GONNA BE
QUITE THE LOOKERS.

86
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,958
- YOU THINK SO?

87
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,500
- YEAH, IN FACT, WOULD YOU MIND
SAVING ONE OF 'EM FOR ME?

88
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,500
- HMM, IF YOU WANT THOSE
LITTLE HEADACHES,

89
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,583
YOU'RE WELCOME TO THEM.
- YOU KNOW...

90
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,666
YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE
MUCH LUCK WITH THE MEN IN TOWN

91
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,000
IF THEY THINK YOU'VE GOT KIDS.

92
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,916
- I DON'T NEED ROMANTIC ADVICE.

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,083
- YOU'RE NOT GETTING
ANY YOUNGER, UR.

94
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,000
AND YOU DESERVE TO BE HAPPY.

95
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,875
PROMISE YOU'LL GIVE IT
A LITTLE THOUGHT?

96
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,750
- YEAH, SURE.

97
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:41,916
- TELL ME SOMETHING.

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,666
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
IT'S GONNA TAKE US

99
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,250
TO BECOME STRONGER THAN UR?

100
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,541
- HOW THE HECK SHOULD I KNOW?

101
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,541
- SHE'S THE BEST WIZARD AROUND,

102
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,458
BUT MY DREAM IS TO SOMEDAY BE
EVEN BETTER THAN SHE IS.

103
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,333
- YOU CAN'T STOP RUNNING
YOUR MOUTH, CAN YOU?

104
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,250
DO YOU THINK
I REALLY CARE ABOUT THAT?

105
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,500
- WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS SO GRUMPY?

106
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,708
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE ALL "MASTER"
THIS AND "MASTER" THAT--

107
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,125
IT'S BUGGING ME.

108
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,250
- SHE TOLD ME SHE DECIDED
TO TEACH YOU

109
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:08,083
'CAUSE SHE SEES SOME
KINDA DARKNESS INSIDE OF YOU.

110
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,833
- WELL, SHE'S PROBABLY RIGHT.

111
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:12,666
ESPECIALLY AFTER EVERYTHING
I'VE BEEN THROUGH.

112
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,250
- WELL, SHE WANTS TO HELP YOU
GET RID OF IT.

113
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:19,583
- I'LL DO THAT ON MY OWN.
JUST WATCH.

114
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:24,958
RIGHT NOW, ALL I CARE ABOUT IS
GETTING REVENGE ON DELIORA.

115
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,125
AND ONCE
I'VE LEARNED ENOUGH MAGIC,

116
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,958
I AM SO OUTTA HERE.
BYE BYE, ICE WITCH.

117
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,666
( grunts )
- KEEP TALKING THAT WAY

118
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,416
ABOUT ME, AND YOU'RE
DEAD MEAT, KID!

119
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,833
- ( chuckles )
- I'M SORRY!

120
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,833
SO WHEN ARE YOU GONNA START
TEACHING US SOME POWERFUL MAGIC?

121
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,791
- I ALREADY HAVE.

122
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,416
- I'M NOT TALKIN' ABOUT THAT
MAKER MAGIC STUFF.

123
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,041
FAR AS I CAN TELL,
THAT JUNK'S COMPLETELY USELESS.

124
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:02,375
- LOOK ME IN THE EYES.

125
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,541
GRAY.

126
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,500
I TOLD YOU.

127
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,625
MAKER MAGIC GIVES YOU
CREATIVE FREEDOM.

128
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,041
ONCE YOU'RE ABLE TO
CREATE YOUR OWN STYLE,

129
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,791
YOU CAN MAKE IT
AS POWERFUL AS YOU WANT.

130
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,583
- YOU KEEP SAYING THE SAME THING
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

131
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,791
- GRAY, WE'RE IN PUBLIC! 
PUT YOUR CLOTHES BACK ON!

132
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,291
- NOW I HAVE THIS WEIRD HABIT
'CAUSE OF YOU!

133
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,958
- DON'T YOU BLAME IT ON ME!

134
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,958
- ( laughter )

135
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,166
- LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.

136
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,625
- OKAY.

137
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,500
- WELL, THAT WAS EMBARRASSING.
- AND HILARIOUS!

138
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,291
- SHUT UP, BROWNNOSER!
- YOU SHUT UP, STREAKER!

139
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:41,125
- HAVE YOU HEARD ANY NEWS
ABOUT DELIORA'S WHEREABOUTS?

140
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:44,083
- YEAH, I HEARD IT MADE ITS WAY
TO THE NORTHERN CONTINENT.

141
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,833
IT'S SOMEWHERE AROUND BRAGO.

142
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,291
- I HOPE THEY DON'T
END UP SUFFERING

143
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,708
THE SAME FATE AS ISVAN.

144
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,583
- WHAT'S WRONG?

145
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,083
- THAT'S WHERE IT IS.

146
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:58,000
IN BRAGO.

147
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,250
- NO, GRAY!

148
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,125
DELIORA'S OUT OF
YOUR LEAGUE, GRAY.

149
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,500
IT'LL KILL YOU!
DON'T GO!

150
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,416
- BEG ALL YOU WANT,

151
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,875
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
CHANGE MY MIND! 

152
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,916
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

153
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,875
THAT DEMON TOOK MY MOM AND DAD
AWAY FROM ME!

154
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,083
I HAVE TO GET REVENGE!

155
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,500
- LEAVE AND YOU'RE NO LONGER
MY STUDENT.

156
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,791
- FINE!
I'M BETTER OFF WITHOUT YOU.

157
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,958
- DON'T GO.

158
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,791
- AND IF THAT THING KILLS ME,
IT'LL BE YOUR FAULT!

159
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,833
YOU SHOULD HAVE TAUGHT ME
REAL MAGIC!

160
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,833
- GREAT.

161
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,958
- UH...

162
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,791
HEY, GUYS?
IS IT JUST ME,

163
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:58,541
OR DOES THAT TEMPLE LOOK
A LITTLE CROOKED RIGHT NOW?

164
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,041
- Happy:
WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?

165
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,458
- Gray: I'M GUESSING NATSU.
- Erza: ME TOO.

166
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,875
- I DON'T KNOW HOW HE MANAGED
TO PULL IT OFF,

167
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,375
BUT HE'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO'D DO SOMETHING THAT CRAZY.

168
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,375
IT'S A PRETTY GREAT IDEA
IF HE DID IT ON PURPOSE.

169
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,333
SINCE THE TEMPLE'S TILTED
LIKE THAT,

170
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,250
THE MOONLIGHT WON'T HIT DELIORA.

171
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,916
- YOU MEAN HIS HABIT OF
DESTROYING STUFF

172
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,125
ACTUALLY CAME IN USEFUL
FOR ONCE?

173
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,916
- MY HEAD'S STUCK!

174
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,916
LOOKING SIDEWAYS AT THAT
CROOKED TEMPLE HURT MY NECK!

175
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,166
( grunts )
- AAH!

176
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,750
- ( Happy and Lucy scream )
- WATCH OUT!

177
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,583
WHO'S THERE?

178
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,000
- ( grunting )

179
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,791
- WE'VE TRACKED YOU DOWN,
FAIRY TAIL!

180
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,500
- WE WON'T ALLOW YOU
TO INTERFERE.

181
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,833
- NOT THESE GUYS.
- LYON'S MINIONS?

182
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,291
- THEY'RE ALL AROUND US!
- AYE...

183
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,875
- I CAN HANDLE THIS MYSELF.

184
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,916
- YOU SURE?

185
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,833
- I'LL TAKE CARE OF THEM.

186
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,500
YOU GO AND SETTLE THINGS
WITH LYON.

187
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,250
- WE'LL FIGHT WITH HER!

188
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,083
YOU JUST GO AND DO
WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

189
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,125
- AYE!

190
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,458
- THANKS, YOU GUYS.

191
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,541
I GOTTA TELL LYON
THAT UR'S STILL ALIVE.

192
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,791
THE ONLY PERSON
WHO CAN STOP HIM...

193
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,416
- ( both grunting )

194
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,791
- ...IS ME.

195
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:28,958
- ( growling )

196
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,875
- ICE MAKE...

197
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,458
ROSE GARDEN!

198
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,000
- ( growling )

199
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,875
- I CAN'T KEEP THIS UP.

200
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,541
I'M USING TOO MUCH
MAGIC ENERGY.

201
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,708
- ( groans )

202
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,000
( gasps )

203
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,291
- ( roaring )

204
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,166
- IT'S OKAY.

205
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,916
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.

206
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,541
- ( exhales )
 YOU'RE HERE.

207
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,375
UR, BUT WHY?

208
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,791
- I WANT YOU TO GRAB LYON
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

209
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:24,083
I CAN'T CONCENTRATE ON FIGHTING
IF I HAVE TO PROTECT YOU.

210
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:27,416
- OH, NO!
- HE'S FINE, JUST OUT COLD.

211
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,833
- DELIORA!

212
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,791
IT'S TOO STRONG.

213
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,458
I DIDN'T STAND A CHANCE.

214
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,666
- GET GOING.

215
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,666
- WAIT!

216
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,458
WHY'D YOU COME AFTER ME?

217
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:45,458
I THOUGHT I WASN'T
YOUR STUDENT ANYMORE.

218
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,083
- A FRIEND SAID SOMETHING
RECENTLY THAT MADE ME THINK.

219
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,500
SHE TOLD ME I DESERVE
TO BE HAPPY.

220
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,250
WHICH SHOCKED ME,

221
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,833
'CAUSE I'VE NEVER THOUGHT
OF MYSELF AS UNHAPPY.

222
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,375
SHE JUST DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.

223
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,208
I HAVE TWO ADORABLE
LITTLE STUDENTS

224
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,416
THAT I SPEND EACH DAY WITH,

225
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,083
AND WATCH THEM GROW INTO MEN.

226
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,541
WHAT MORE COULD I WANT?

227
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,125
I DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANYTHING IN THE WORLD

228
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:17,583
THAT COULD MAKE ME HAPPIER.
- UR, YOUR LEG.

229
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,125
- OH, YOU NOTICED.

230
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:22,625
I LOST THE REAL ONE,
BUT THIS WILL DO FOR NOW.

231
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:26,125
MY MAKER MAGIC...
CAME IN HANDY.

232
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,541
- ( sobbing )

233
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,958
- I VOWED I WOULD FREE YOU FROM
THE DARKNESS WITHIN YOU.

234
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,125
AND IF THAT MEANS
I HAVE TO FIGHT THIS DEMON,

235
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,166
THEN SO BE IT.

236
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,458
NOW GET OUT OF HERE,

237
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,666
AND LET ME DO THIS.

238
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,458
- NO, I'M NOT LEAVING YOU!

239
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:41,458
IT'S MY FAULT THAT
ALL OF THIS HAPPENED.

240
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,583
- NO ONE'S AT FAULT.

241
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,375
THIS IS JUST SOMETHING
WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH,

242
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,625
IN ORDER TO BE HAPPY AGAIN.

243
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,000
- WAIT, UR.

244
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,291
- I THOUGHT YOU
WERE UNCONSCIOUS.

245
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,083
I NEED YOU AND GRAY TO--
- YOU'RE GONNA DEFEAT IT, RIGHT?

246
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,875
YOU'RE TALKING LIKE
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT.

247
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,416
- LET HER GO!
- SHUT UP!

248
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,833
YOU CAN BEAT THAT THING
NO PROBLEM.

249
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,416
YOU'RE THE STRONGEST WIZARD
ALIVE.

250
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,250
THAT DEMON'S NO MATCH FOR YOU.

251
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,541
- LYON, HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE I TOLD YOU?

252
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,416
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE BETTER.

253
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,125
- BUT THAT CAN'T BE TRUE.

254
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,750
- IN THE WESTERN COUNTRIES,
THERE ARE LOTS OF WIZARDS

255
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,333
WHO ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN ME.

256
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,166
- NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
IT'S NOT!

257
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,916
'CAUSE YOU'RE THE STRONGEST.

258
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,500
IF YOU AREN'T,

259
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,583
THEN WHY HAVE I BEEN
TRAINING WITH YOU ALL THIS TIME?

260
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,000
- ONE DAY YOU'LL SURPASS ME,
AND WHEN THAT DAY COMES,

261
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,458
I HOPE YOU'LL MOVE ON
TO A LOFTIER GOAL.

262
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,041
- I STUDIED WITH YOU, BECAUSE I
THOUGHT YOU WERE

263
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,333
THE BEST THERE WAS.

264
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,208
IF YOU LET THAT MONSTER
DEFEAT YOU,

265
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,875
YOU'LL PROVE ME WRONG.

266
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,875
UR, DON'T BETRAY ME!

267
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:43,416
- LYON, I--

268
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,833
- IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GIVE IT YOUR ALL,

269
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,041
THEN I'LL HAVE TO
DO IT MYSELF!

270
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,000
- ( gasps )

271
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:54,041
LYON, THAT STANCE--
WHERE'D YOU LEARN THAT?

272
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,750
- WHERE, YOU ASK?

273
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:56,916
SINCE YOU DON'T WANNA
TEACH US

274
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,541
POWERFUL MAGIC YOURSELF,

275
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:02,541
I WENT TO THE STOREHOUSE
AND READ ALL YOUR MAGIC BOOKS!

276
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,750
YOU HID SPELLS
LIKE THE ICED SHELL FROM ME

277
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,041
'CAUSE YOU WERE SCARED.

278
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,916
THAT'S WHY, ISN'T IT?!

279
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,791
- DID YOU EVEN BOTHER
TO READ THAT BOOK

280
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,250
ALL THE WAY THROUGH?

281
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,583
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
TO THE SPELL CASTER?

282
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,166
- WILL HE BE OKAY?

283
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,125
- I ASKED YOU A QUESTION!
ANSWER ME, LYON!

284
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,833
- ( grunts )

285
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,208
- ( growls )

286
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,791
- PLEASE, YOU CAN'T DO THIS!

287
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,458
- NO, IT NOTICED US.

288
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,458
- I KNOW MAGIC'S TOO WEAK
TO KILL DELIORA...

289
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,833
BUT IF I CAST
THE ICED SHELL SPELL,

290
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,833
I CAN SEAL IT IN ICE
FOR ETERNITY!

291
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,666
- ( loud clang )

292
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,791
- SORRY, BUT I'M NOT
GONNA LET YOU DO THAT.

293
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,583
- BUT UR, WHY'S IT BAD?

294
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,250
- WHEN THAT SPELL'S USED,

295
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:47,291
THE CASTER'S BODY BECOMES
THE ICED SHELL ITSELF.

296
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,750
HE'S RIGHT, THOUGH.

297
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,375
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
DELIORA CAN BE STOPPED.

298
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,041
I NEVER WOULD HAVE IMAGINED
LYON WOULD COME UP WITH

299
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,875
THE SAME IDEA I HAD.

300
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,791
- HEY, WAIT!
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!

301
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,208
- I MUST HAVE TAUGHT HIM WELL.

302
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:05,541
- UR--
- STAY BACK.

303
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,708
I WON'T EVER LET YOU
HURT MY STUDENTS AGAIN!

304
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,333
THIS IS THE END OF
THE LINE, YOU MONSTER!

305
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,333
ABSOLUTE FREEZE...

306
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,708
ICED SHELL!

307
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,083
- UR!  NO!

308
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,625
PLEASE, DON'T DO IT!

309
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,041
- Ur: IT'S A SACRIFICE
I HAVE TO MAKE

310
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,541
IN ORDER TO SAVE
THE TWO OF YOU. 

311
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,958
MY BODY WILL BECOME THE ICE

312
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,416
THAT WILL SEAL
THE DEMON DELIORA...

313
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,875
FOR ETERNITY.

314
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,083
GRAY...

315
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,500
PROMISE ME THIS ONE THING.

316
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,916
PLEASE, TELL LYON I DIED.

317
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,750
IF HE FOUND OUT
I HAD BEEN TURNED INTO ICE,

318
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,833
HE'LL PROBABLY WASTE
HIS ENTIRE LIFE

319
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,958
TRYING TO FIND A WAY
TO UNDO THE SPELL.

320
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:12,791
AND THAT WOULD MAKE
MY SACRIFICE MEANINGLESS.

321
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,833
- STOP!

322
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:18,750
- I WANT LYON TO SEE THE WORLD
AND LIVE A FULL LIFE.

323
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,666
AND GRAY...

324
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,666
I WANT THE SAME FOR YOU.

325
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,125
- ( cries )
I'M BEGGING YOU!

326
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,375
PLEASE, DON'T DO THIS!

327
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:31,750
I PROMISE, I'LL DO WHATEVER
YOU TELL ME TO FROM NOW ON!

328
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,166
- THERE'S NO REASON TO BE SAD.

329
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,625
- I'LL LIVE ON.
PLEASE DON'T CRY.

330
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:44,291
I MAY NOT BE WITH YOU, BUT I
WILL PROTECT YOU FROM DELIORA.

331
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:48,000
BE STRONG.
MAKE ME PROUD.

332
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:55,166
- UR!

333
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,291
- I FREED YOU FROM 
THE DARKNESS, GRAY.

334
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,875
I'VE SEALED IT AWAY FOREVER.

335
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:10,291
- Gray: SUDDENLY, I FELT 
ALL THE ANGER AND SADNESS

336
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,458
I HAD WITHIN ME
JUST DISAPPEAR.

337
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:16,458
AT THAT MOMENT, I SWORE I WOULD
ALWAYS BE STRONG FOR HER.

338
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,500
I'D BECOME THE BEST WIZARD
I COULD TO MAKE HER PROUD OF ME.

339
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,416
BUT LYON WAS DIFFERENT.

340
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,708
- OW.  WHAT DID SHE DO TO ME?

341
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,041
( gasps )
HUH?

342
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:34,083
THAT'S DELIORA!

343
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:37,291
HOW DID IT HAPPEN?
DID UR CAST THE SPELL?

344
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:40,291
DID SHE?!
WHERE IS SHE NOW?

345
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:41,416
TELL ME!

346
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,833
- ( sobbing )

347
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,666
SHE--

348
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,541
SHE'S DEAD.

349
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:52,958
- NO...

350
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,958
NO!

351
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,208
- AAH.
- YOU JERK!

352
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,041
HOW WILL I SURPASS HER NOW?

353
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,250
SHE'S DEAD!
AND SO IS MY DREAM,

354
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,375
'CAUSE OF YOU!

355
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,208
- I'M SORRY.

356
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,833
- THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
 IT WON'T BRING HER BACK.

357
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,291
YOU KILLED MY DREAM!

358
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,083
- ( crying )

359
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,083
- IF YOU HADN'T
CHALLENGED DELIORA,

360
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,875
THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED!

361
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:24,208
IT'S YOUR FAULT SHE'S DEAD.

362
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,000
YOU'RE THE ONE.

363
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,458
YOU KILLED MASTER UR.

364
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,750
- THIS COULD GO ON FOREVER,

365
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,875
SO DO YOURSELF A FAVOR,
AND GIVE UP.

366
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,916
- I WOULD NEVER GIVE YOU
THAT SATISFACTION.

367
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,666
- THEN YOU'RE ASKING FOR IT.

368
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,458
- OH, AM I NOW?

369
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:44,750
- WHAT THE--?

370
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,458
WHOA, IT'S GRAY.

371
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,458
- LEAVE HIM TO ME.

372
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,791
IT'S TIME WE SETTLED THINGS
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

373
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,500
- NO WAY, MAN!
YOU ALREADY LOST TO HIM ONCE!

374
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,958
- AND IT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.

375
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,416
I'M READY TO END THIS NOW.

376
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,875
- YOU SEEM AWFULLY CONFIDENT.

377
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,666
- YOU WERE RIGHT, LYON.

378
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,708
I'M THE ONE WHO'S TO BLAME
FOR OUR MASTER'S DEATH.

379
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,166
BUT YOU'RE NO BETTER.

380
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,000
YOU'VE THREATENED MY COMRADES,

381
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,250
BROUGHT HARM TO THE VILLAGERS,

382
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,958
AND NOW YOU'RE
TRYING TO DESTROY

383
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,125
WHAT UR GAVE HER LIFE
TO CREATE.

384
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:24,500
IT'S TIME WE ACCEPT
OUR PUNISHMENT, TOGETHER.

385
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,125
- THAT STANCE!

386
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,541
NOT THE ICED SHELL?!

387
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,083
- ICED SHELL?

388
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:36,166
- MY MASTER UR CAST A SPELL
CALLED ICED SHELL ON THIS DEMON.

389
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,500
SHE GAVE EVERYTHING
TO SEAL IT AWAY FOREVER.

390
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,125
- I'D FIND HER IF I COULD,

391
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,916
BUT UR'S BEEN DEAD
FOR MANY YEARS.

392
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,333
- ARE YOU INSANE?

393
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,208
YOU WOULDN'T DARE!

394
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,625
IF YOU WANNA LIVE,
CHANGE THE VILLAGERS

395
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,291
BACK TO THEIR HUMAN FORMS.

396
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,333
AND THEN LEAVE THIS ISLAND,
AND NEVER RETURN.

397
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,000
IF YOU'LL AGREE TO THAT,
I'LL STOP.

398
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,833
OTHERWISE, THIS IS THE END.

399
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,333
- THAT SO?

400
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,333
WELL, I DON'T BELIEVE
A WORD OF IT.

401
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,500
YOU'RE BLUFFING.

402
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,583
- NO, I'M NOT.

403
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,166
- YOU'LL DIE!

404
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,000
- DON'T DO IT!

405
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:21,208
- ALL THESE YEARS
I'VE LIED TO MYSELF.

406
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:24,041
I DIDN'T WANNA ADMIT
THAT UR DIED BECAUSE OF ME.

407
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,500
BUT SHE DID.

408
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:28,958
AND IT'S TIME
I TOOK RESPONSIBILITY.

409
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:32,583
SO I WILL HERE AND NOW.

410
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,416
I'M NOT AFRAID TO DIE.

411
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,041
IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES!

412
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,625
- STOP THIS NOW!
- WHAT'S IT GONNA BE, LYON?

413
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,833
ARE WE GONNA DIE,
OR ARE WE GONNA LIVE?

414
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,791
IT'S UP TO YOU.
- YOU WOULDN'T.

415
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:49,000
YOU'RE NOT BRAVE ENOUGH
TO GIVE YOUR LIFE.

416
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,666
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A COWARD.

417
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,666
- JUST WATCH ME.

418
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,416
( grunting )

419
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,708
- DON'T DO IT!

420
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:06,416
- NATSU, ERZA,
ALL MY FRIENDS IN FAIRY TAIL...

421
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,458
THE REST IS UP TO YOU.

422
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:11,333
I DON'T WANNA LEAVE YOU,

423
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,541
BUT MY TIME IS UP.

424
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,791
- ( end theme playing )

425
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,958
- ( singing in Japanese )

426
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:50,541
- PROFESSOR HAPPY'S CLASS
ABOUT FAIRY TAIL!

427
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:53,875
TODAY, I'M GONNA TEACH YOU ABOUT
OUR RESIDENT ICE WIZARD, GRAY.

428
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:56,000
HE USES ICE-BASED MAKER MAGIC,

429
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,583
AND HE'S ALWAYS
FIGHTING WITH NATSU

430
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:59,125
'CAUSE FIRE AND ICE
DON'T MIX.

431
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,875
BUT SOMETIMES
THEY GET ALONG OKAY.

432
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:02,875
HE HAS A BAD HABIT OF TAKING
OFF HIS CLOTHES

433
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:05,333
ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE.
YAY!

434
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,166
HE'S A TOUGH GUY,
BUT HE'S GOT A SOFT SPOT

435
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,250
FOR CRYING GIRLS.

436
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:09,458
THAT'S TODAY'S CLASS!

437
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:12,041
DISMISSED!
AYE!

438
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,500
I WAS WONDERING...

439
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:18,000
HOW COME YOU AND GRAY ARE
ALWAYS AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS?

440
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,791
- SOMETHING ABOUT HIM
JUST TICKS ME OFF.

441
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:20,666
- OKAY.

442
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,291
WHO DO YOU THINK
IS STRONGER?

443
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,791
- SERIOUSLY?
OH, I'M WAY STRONGER THAN HE IS.

444
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:26,666
THAT KNUCKLEHEAD
AIN'T GOT NOTHING ON ME.

445
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:30,541
- WHOA.  GRAY SAID
THE EXACT SAME THING ABOUT YOU.

446
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:33,708
- ( Happy and Natsu speaking )

447
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:36,125
- YEAH, WELL, WHO DO YOU
THINK IS STRONGER?

448
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,666
- NEVER MIND RIGHT NOW!
DELIORA'S ABOUT TO BE REVIVED.

449
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,458
- YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO AVOID THE QUESTION!

450
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:41,625
ANSWER ME!
