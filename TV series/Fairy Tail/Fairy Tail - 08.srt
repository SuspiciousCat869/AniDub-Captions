- Narrator:
IN A LAND FAR, FAR AWAY

2
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:23,291
LIES THE KINGDOM
OF FIORE,

3
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:26,208
A SMALL, PEACEFUL NATION
OF 17 MILLION,

4
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,625
AND A PLACE FILLED
WITH MAGIC.

5
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,875
FOUND IN EVERY HOME, BOUGHT AND
SOLD IN EVERY MARKETPLACE.

6
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:34,416
FOR MOST,
MAGIC IS MERELY A TOOL,

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,041
A MUNDANE PART
OF EVERYDAY LIFE.

8
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,375
FOR SOME, HOWEVER,
MAGIC IS AN ART,

9
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:42,416
AND THEY'VE DEVOTED
THEIR LIVES TO ITS PRACTICE.

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,625
THESE ARE THE WIZARDS.

11
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,833
BANDED TOGETHER
INTO MAGICAL GUILDS,

12
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:50,666
THEY PLY THEIR SKILLS
IN SEARCH OF FAME AND FORTUNE.

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,500
MANY SUCH GUILDS
DOT THE LANDSCAPE OF FIORE.

14
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:57,333
BUT THERE IS A CERTAIN GUILD
IN A CERTAIN TOWN

15
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,541
THAT SOARS HIGH
ABOVE THE REST.

16
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:02,750
ONE FROM WHICH COUNTLESS
LEGENDS HAVE BEEN BORN. 

17
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,375
A GUILD THAT WILL
NO DOUBT

18
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:07,916
CONTINUE TO CREATE LEGENDS
WELL INTO THE FUTURE.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,500
ITS NAME IS FAIRY TAIL.

20
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:14,666
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

21
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,375
- Natsu:
PREVIOUSLY ON "FAIRY TAIL"...

22
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:48,000
- NATSU, GRAY, YOU TWO ARE 
THE STRONGEST WIZARDS HERE.

23
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,791
I COULD REALLY USE
YOUR HELP.

24
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,833
- ME AND GRAY?
- ON THE SAME TEAM?

25
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,375
- AAH!
- ( explosion )

26
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:00,166
- THIS IS BAD.
- COUNCIL WON'T LIKE THIS, HUH?

27
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,333
- ( sighs )

28
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:08,541
- Narrator: YEARS AGO,
THE EVIL WIZARD ZEREF 

29
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:13,541
CRAFTED A SKULL-SHAPED FLUTE
INFUSED WITH BLACK MAGIC.

30
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:16,958
IT IS KNOWN AS LULLABY,
FOR ITS MELODY CAUSES

31
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,375
THOSE UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH
TO HEAR IT

32
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,791
TO FALL INTO
ETERNAL SLUMBER.

33
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:25,000
THE BATTLE FOR POSSESSION
OF THIS FORBIDDEN INSTRUMENT

34
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,458
IS BEING WAGED
AT THIS VERY MOMENT.

35
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,541
- NATSU!

36
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:36,958
- ( laughs )

37
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:40,208
NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND,
LITTLE FLY?

38
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,750
YOUR FIRE CAN NEVER
DEFEAT WIND!

39
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:47,083
- THIS IS INTENSE! IT'S LIKE
STANDING INSIDE A TYPHOON!

40
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:50,291
- IT'S TIME TO BLOW
YOUR FLAME OUT FOR GOOD!

41
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,500
- AAH!

42
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:54,916
- NOW!  STORM SHRED!

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,916
- ( grunting )

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,083
AAH!
- ( laughs )

45
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,500
- I HAVE TO BREAK THROUGH!

46
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:03,500
AAH!

47
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:09,375
I CAN'T EVEN GET CLOSE ENOUGH
TO LAY PUNCH ON THIS GUY!

48
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,833
NOW WHAT?

49
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,875
- Happy:
THE STRONGEST TEAM!

50
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,750
- FEELING A LITTLE FRUSTRATED?

51
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,375
DON'T BE
TOO HARD ON YOURSELF,

52
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,333
YOU NEVER HAD
A CHANCE AGAINST ME.

53
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,458
( laughs )
BUT DON'T WORRY,

54
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,666
I'M GOING TO PUT AN END
TO THIS NOW.

55
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,875
MY SOARING PHOENIX MAGIC
RIPS EVERYTHING TO SHREDS!

56
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,500
EMERA BARAM!

57
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,125
- THAT'S A DANGEROUS SPELL,
NATSU!

58
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,333
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T LET IT TOUCH YOU, OKAY?

59
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,041
- GOOD-BYE, FAIRY TAIL FLY!

60
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:48,250
- AAH!
- ( screams )

61
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:51,250
- COME ON, NATSU!
YOU HAVE TO GET UP!

62
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,791
HURRY!
- ( laughs )

63
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,208
I'M IMPRESSED HIS BODY'S
STILL IN ONE PIECE

64
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,583
AFTER THAT ATTACK.

65
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:00,541
NOT TOO SHABBY
FOR A WIZARD SO YOUNG.

66
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:01,833
- NATSU!

67
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,458
- AFTER I PLAY A MELODY
ON THE LULLABY

68
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,250
FOR THOSE OLD GUILD FOOLS,

69
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:09,083
THEY'LL BE JOINING YOU IN
YOUR ETERNAL REST.

70
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,500
- ( grunts )

71
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,000
ALL YOU TALK ABOUT
IS THAT STUPID FLUTE!

72
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,416
- Happy: WHOA...

73
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,041
- IF YOU WANNA KILL
 THE GUILD MASTERS,

74
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,250
THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GET PAST ME!

75
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,666
- YOU TELL HIM, NATSU!

76
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,083
- IMPOSSIBLE!
HOW ARE YOU EVEN STANDING?

77
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,750
- ENOUGH TALKING, IT'S TIME
TO START FIGHTING!

78
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,250
COME ON!

79
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,083
- I TOLD YOU,
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME!

80
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,708
- ( grunts, groans )

81
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,500
- ( laughing )

82
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,666
- NO!
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

83
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,875
I CAN'T EVEN
GET CLOSE TO HIM!

84
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,916
- NATSU!

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,750
- I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!

86
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,708
I HAVE TO BEAT HIM!

87
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:53,083
AAH!

88
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,291
- WHAT IS THIS?

89
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,500
THE ANGRIER HE GETS,
THE MORE INTENSE

90
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,916
HIS FLAMES BECOME.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,083
- WOW, HE'S REALLY DOING IT.

92
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,541
HE'S CHANGING THE DIRECTION
OF THE WIND!

93
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,500
- AAH!

94
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,166
- THE FLAMES OF EMOTION?

95
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,458
BUT HOW COULD THAT BE?
IT'S AN ANCIENT MAGIC.

96
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:19,291
WHERE DID THIS KID
LEARN HOW TO USE IT?

97
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,791
WHAT THE--

98
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,791
IT'S DRAWING MY WIND
TOWARDS HIM.

99
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,666
- THAT'S IT.
- ( shouts )

100
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,708
- NATSU!

101
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,166
YOU STINK, JUST GIVE UP
AND LET GRAY HANDLE THIS,

102
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,333
'CAUSE YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA WIN.

103
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,250
( snickers )

104
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,333
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

105
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,791
- AH. HIS FLAMES ARE
BLOWING AWAY MY STORM MAIL.

106
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,666
- AAH!

107
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,666
- CURSE YOU.

108
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,291
- NATSU'S FLAMES ARE HEATING
THE AIR AROUND HIM.

109
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,333
THE HOT AIR CREATES
A VERTICAL UPDRAFT,

110
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,541
WHICH ALSO CREATES
A LOW-PRESSURE AREA.

111
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,708
AND WIND ALWAYS BLOWS
FROM HIGH-PRESSURE

112
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,250
TO LOW-PRESSURE AREAS.

113
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,666
- I'M GONNA TAKE YOU DOWN!

114
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,666
- FIRE MAGIC IS SO STRONG.

115
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,291
SURELY HE COULDN'T BE.

116
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,375
- AAH!

117
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:10,833
- ( grunts )

118
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:14,208
- FIRE DRAGON SWORD EDGE!

119
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:19,166
- THE DRAGON SLAYER--
THEY TRULY EXIST.

120
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,916
- DID YOU LIKE THAT, HAPPY?

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,416
- YOU SHOWED HIM THAT IF
YOU MESS WITH A SALAMANDER,

122
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,833
YOU'RE GONNA GET TOASTED.

123
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,666
- YOU WEREN'T TOO SURE
OF ME EARLIER.

124
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,416
- CATS HAVE A REALLY BAD
SHORT-TERM MEMORY, YOU KNOW?

125
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,000
- YOU SAID I'D NEVER
BE ABLE TO BEAT HIM,

126
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,875
SO I SHOULD LEAVE IT TO ERZA
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

127
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,875
- WHOA, YOUR MEMORY MUST BE
EVEN WORSE THAN MINE.

128
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,416
I SAID GRAY NOT ERZA!

129
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,791
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER,
'CAUSE YOU WON, NATSU!

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,875
- YOU BET I DID!

131
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,708
THOUGH I'M NOT REALLY SURE HOW
I PULLED OFF THAT LAST ATTACK.

132
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,500
- GUESS YOU'RE JUST
THAT AWESOME!

133
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,458
- I GUESS SO!
( laughs )

134
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,916
- Lucy:
 NATSU!

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,458
- HEY, YOU GUYS JUST MISSED
SEEING ME BEAT ERIGOR!

136
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,458
- Happy:
AYE!

137
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:01,875
- Erza: I'M PROUD OF YOU.

138
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,708
- YOU GONNA BE OKAY, ERZA?

139
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,125
- YES, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

140
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,541
- NO WAY.

141
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:13,000
ERIGOR NEVER LOSES.

142
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,333
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAD SUCH
A HARD TIME WITH THIS GUY.

143
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,583
- I NEVER SAID THAT!
I TOOK CARE OF HIM, DIDN'T I?

144
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,791
- I WAS KINDA WORRIED
FOR A WHILE THERE.

145
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,083
- WHATEVER.

146
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,416
- Happy: WOW...
- YOU LOOK PRETTY STUPID

147
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,625
WEARING A SCARF
WHEN YOU'RE HALF-NAKED.

148
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,375
- LIKE YOU HAVE ROOM
TO TALK.

149
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,791
HEY, LUCY, GIVE ME
YOUR CLOTHES.

150
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,791
- IN YOUR DREAMS!
- ( Erza chuckles )

151
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,208
ANYWAY, WELL DONE, NATSU.

152
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,625
THANKS TO YOU,
ALL THE GUILD MASTERS

153
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,875
WILL BE SAFE NOW.
- ( giggles softly )

154
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,708
- HEH.

155
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,333
- WELL, WE'RE HERE.
I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE SURE

156
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,083
TO STOP BY
THE GUILD MASTERS' CONFERENCE

157
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,958
TO TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENED,
AND ASK THEM HOW WE SHOULD 

158
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,041
PROPERLY DISPOSE
OF THE LULLABY FLUTE.

159
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,208
- MIGHT AS WELL,
SINCE WE'RE SO CLOSE TO CLOVER.

160
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,916
- KAGE! - WHAT DO
YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

161
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,541
- LULLABY'S MINE NOW.

162
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,041
SHOULDN'T HAVE LET
YOUR GUARD DOWN, FLIES.

163
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:02,541
( cackling )

164
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,875
- ( all exhale )

165
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,208
- THAT JERK!

166
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,166
- THIS IS HOW HE PAYS US
BACK FOR SAVING HIS LIFE?

167
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,541
- AFTER HIM!

168
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,250
- WE HAVE RECEIVED REPORTS
THAT EISENWALD IS PLOTTING

169
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,625
TO MURDER THE GUILD MASTERS
AT THEIR CONFERENCE IN CLOVER.

170
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,041
I WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN
ON MY WATCH.

171
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,875
WE HAVE TO STOP THEM.

172
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:27,958
LET'S SHOW THOSE WIZARDS
THE MIGHT OF THE FIORE ARMY!

173
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,333
- All: YES, SIR!

174
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,500
- YEAH, THIS'LL WORK.

175
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:37,833
SURELY THEY'LL BE ABLE
TO HEAR

176
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,875
THE LULLABY'S SONG
FROM HERE.

177
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,291
FINALLY THE TIME HAS COME.

178
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,500
- ( smooching sounds )

179
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:49,125
THERE ARE SOME HOT LITTLE
NUMBERS IN THIS WEEK'S ISSUE.

180
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:52,625
WOW, YOUNG WIZARDING LADIES
ARE SO MUCH MORE POWERFUL NOW

181
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:56,791
THAN THEY WERE BACK
IN MY DAY, AND SEXIER TOO!

182
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,583
AAH!  I DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR THIS!

183
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,208
I NEED TO CATCH UP
TO THOSE FOOLS

184
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,125
BEFORE THEY DESTROY
AN ENTIRE TOWN!

185
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,666
( gasps, screams )

186
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,166
IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE!

187
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,708
I WAS DOING SOME RESEARCH
ON FEMALE WIZARDS!

188
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,166
IT WAS INNOCENT AND I HAVE
NO REASON TO BE ASHAMED!

189
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,791
- I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

190
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,375
- ( sighs )
- YOU'VE BEEN HURT BADLY, BOY.

191
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,250
YOU SHOULDN'T BE WANDERING
AROUND THE WOODS

192
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,583
IN YOUR CONDITION.

193
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,083
- YES, SIR, YOU'RE RIGHT.

194
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,833
HOLD ON.
- ( sighs )

195
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,958
- THAT'S MAKAROV, THE MASTER
OF THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD.

196
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,833
- WHY DO I KEEP RUNNING INTO
THESE FLIES?

197
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,250
EXCUSE ME?
- HMM?

198
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,458
- I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'D CARE
TO HEAR A SONG?

199
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,291
THEY WOULDN'T LET ME
PLAY MY FLUTE

200
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,500
WHILE I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL.

201
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:39,041
IT'D MEAN A LOT TO PLAY
FOR SOMEONE AGAIN.

202
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,666
- THAT'S ONE CREEPY-LOOKIN'
FLUTE YOU GOT THERE.

203
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,791
- I KNOW, BUT IT HAS
A BEAUTIFUL SOUND.

204
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,583
- HMM...

205
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,583
WELL, I SHOULD BE GOING,

206
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:51,291
BUT I GUESS ONE SONG
COULDN'T HURT.

207
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,958
- OH, THANK YOU!

208
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,708
WE WIN.

209
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,708
BE SURE TO LISTEN CAREFULLY,
OKAY, SIR?

210
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,916
- YEAH YEAH.

211
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,333
- THIS IS IT.

212
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,708
- WHO'D WANNA JOIN
A LEGAL GUILD ANYWAY?

213
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:10,958
THEY SUCK!

214
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,625
- THOSE FAIRY TAIL GUYS
ARE TOO WEAK

215
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,375
TO BE TALKIN' SUCH BIG TALK!

216
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,791
- THE LULLABY'S SONG
 WILL BE OUR REVENGE

217
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,791
AGAINST THOSE WHO
STRIPPED US OF OUR RIGHTS

218
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,541
AND FORCED US TO LIVE
IN THE DARKNESS!

219
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,000
- Lucy: KILLING INNOCENT PEOPLE
ISN'T GONNA HELP YOU

220
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,583
GET YOUR RIGHTS BACK!

221
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,875
- YOU SHOULD TRY TO LOOK
FOR THE POSITIVE.

222
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,750
YOU AND YOUR BUDDIES.

223
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,625
- KAGE!  WE REALLY NEED
YOUR HELP RIGHT NOW!

224
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,166
- HE'S A MEMBER OF YOUR GUILD!

225
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,916
HE TRUSTED YOU,
AND YOU TRIED TO KILL HIM!

226
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,208
- THERE HE IS!
- GRAMPS!

227
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,041
- MASTER!
- SHH!

228
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,666
- ( all scream )

229
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,916
- WE'RE JUST ABOUT TO GET
TO THE GOOD PART.

230
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,750
WELL, AREN'T YOU BOYS YUMMY?

231
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,250
SO ADORABLE.
- ( both shudder )

232
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,041
- WHO THE HECK IS THAT GUY?

233
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,416
- MASTER BOB.

234
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,625
- ERZA, HONEY, YOU HAVE
REALLY FILLED OUT.

235
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,625
- YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT WEIRDO'S THE MASTER OF

236
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:03,791
THE BLUE PEGASUS GUILD?

237
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,791
- ( sighs )
WELL?

238
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,625
I CAN'T WAIT ALL NIGHT,
YOUNG MAN.

239
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,000
- OH, NO!

240
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,458
- CAN YOU GUYS KEEP IT DOWN
OVER THERE?

241
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,291
WE'RE JUST ABOUT TO GET
TO THE GOOD PART.

242
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,166
- HE'S WITH QUATRO CERBERUS!

243
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,291
- THAT'S THEIR MASTER, GOLDMINE.

244
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,375
- ( groans )
WELL?

245
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,083
- ( breathing deeply )

246
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,375
- I CAN DO THIS.

247
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,791
I JUST HAVE TO PLAY ONE SONG...

248
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,125
AND THAT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING!

249
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,416
- NOTHING'S GOING TO CHANGE.

250
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,625
- HUH?

251
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,250
- YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE FACT

252
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,875
THAT THOSE WHO ARE WEAK
WILL FOREVER REMAIN WEAK.

253
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,416
NOW MAYBE IT'S JUST ME,

254
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,666
BUT I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A BAD THING.

255
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,416
I MEAN, WE HUMANS ARE
WEAK CREATURES BY NATURE.

256
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,083
OUR INSECURITIES ARE THE REASON
THAT GUILDS EVEN EXIST.

257
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,708
AND THEY'RE WHY 
WE HAVE FRIENDS.

258
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,583
WHEN WE'RE SURROUNDED
WITH ALLIES,

259
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,708
IT'S EASIER TO STAY
POSITIVE ABOUT THE FUTURE.

260
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,708
THINK OF IT THIS WAY:
IF WE'RE CLUMSY,

261
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,125
THEN WE MAY STUMBLE
AND BUMP INTO THINGS,

262
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,458
BUT AS LONG AS WE HAVE FAITH
IN OUR FUTURE,

263
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,666
WE CONTINUE MARCHING FORWARD.

264
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,750
OUR INNER STRENGTH 
EMERGES ON ITS OWN.

265
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,458
BUT WE HAVE TO CHOOSE
THAT PATH

266
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:38,458
AND PLEDGE TO LIVE OUR LIVES
TO THE FULLEST.

267
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:42,166
DON'T LET THAT SILLY FLUTE
GET IN THE WAY.

268
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,000
- I SURRENDER.

269
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,500
- MASTER!
- YOU STOPPED HIM!

270
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,875
- GOOD JOB, GRAMPS!

271
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,708
- WHA-- HOW DID YOU KIDS
END UP IN CLOVER?

272
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,708
- MASTER MAKAROV, YOUR WORDS
TOUCHED ME SO DEEPLY

273
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,291
THAT I WAS ALMOST
MOVED TO TEARS.

274
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,166
- OW!

275
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,625
- ( overlapping chatter )

276
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,166
- WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
WE GOT HERE JUST IN TIME

277
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,750
TO SEE GRAMPS TALK HIS WAY
OUT OF ANOTHER ONE.

278
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:16,041
- ( evil laughter )

279
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:20,166
I'VE GROWN TIRED OF YOU COWARDLY
WIZARDS AND YOUR ANTICS!

280
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,750
- ( all gasp )
- SOMETHING CAME OUT!

281
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,791
- ( all gasp )

282
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,375
- WHAT IS THAT?

283
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,750
- I CAN NO LONGER HOLD BACK!

284
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:34,625
I SHALL COME FORTH
TO DEVOUR YOU MYSELF!

285
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:47,583
I SHALL FEAST UPON 
YOUR PITIFUL SOULS!

286
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,125
- Lucy: IT'S SO BIG!

287
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,208
- Happy: WAY TO
STATE THE OBVIOUS!

288
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,833
- Kage:
WHAT IS THAT THING?

289
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,041
ERIGOR NEVER SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT A MONSTER!

290
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,458
- WE'RE IN A PICKLE.

291
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,541
- IT MUST BE A DEMON
FROM THE BOOK OF ZEREF.

292
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:58,833
- ( all scream )
- THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD!

293
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,125
- DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD HELP THEM?

294
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,125
- I CAN'T!
I'VE GOT A BAD BACK!

295
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,583
- WHY DID THE FLUTE 
TURN INTO A MONSTER?

296
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,333
- THAT'S WHAT LULLABY'S TRUE
FORM LOOKS LIKE IN THE FLESH.

297
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,250
IT'S FORBIDDEN BLACK MAGIC.

298
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,958
LIVING MAGIC--
ZEREF'S SPECIALTY.

299
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:23,791
- Erza: LIVING MAGIC?
- Gray: WHO'S ZEREF? 

300
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,583
WASN'T HE
SOME ANCIENT WIZARD?

301
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,208
- Bob: HE'S THE MOST EVIL WIZARD
THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN.

302
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:31,000
HE WAS VERY POWERFUL IN HIS DAY.

303
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,833
BUT IN MY WILDEST DREAMS,
I NEVER THOUGHT HIS DARK LEGACY

304
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,291
WOULD POP UP BACK UP AGAIN.

305
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,500
- NOW THEN, WHICH OF THESE
DELECTABLE SOULS

306
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,916
SHALL I DINE ON FIRST?

307
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,541
- DELECTABLE, HUH?

308
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,416
DO YOU THINK SOULS
ARE REALLY THAT TASTY?

309
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,458
- HOW SHOULD I KNOW
WHAT THEY TASTE LIKE?

310
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,041
- ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT EATING!

311
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,875
- NATSU AND GRAY,
GET EVERYONE TO A SAFE PLACE.

312
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,416
- QUIT BARKING ORDERS!

313
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,708
- YEAH, YOU'RE NOT
THE BOSS OF US.

314
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,750
- JUST DO IT!
- Both: AYE AYE!

315
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,041
- ANOTHER BAD
HAPPY IMPRESSION?

316
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:01,041
- NO GIANT WOODEN DEMON IS GONNA
SCARE OFF THE FIORE ARMY!

317
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,125
CHARGE!
- YES, SIR!

318
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:07,125
- YOU DOUBT MY POWER?
I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU!

319
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,041
- AAH.

320
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,041
CAPTAIN!
ARE WE SCARED YET?

321
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:20,250
- NOW, MEN!  RETREAT!
RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!

322
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,083
- I HAVE NO NEED FOR THOSE
PATHETIC HUMANS.

323
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,083
I PREFER THE TASTE
OF A WIZARD'S SOUL

324
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,083
AND I WILL CONSUME
ALL OF YOURS!

325
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,916
- OH, YEAH?
I'D LIKE TO SEE YA TRY!

326
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,291
BRING IT ON, BIG GUY!

327
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,875
- All:
GOOD LUCK!

328
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,500
- CAN THOSE THREE
DEFEAT LULLABY ON THEIR OWN?

329
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,083
- YOU SHOULD HELP THEM!

330
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,333
- NORMALLY I WOULD,
BUT NONE OF MY CELESTIAL SPIRITS

331
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,666
ARE AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW,

332
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,750
AND I'D PROBABLY JUST
SLOW THEM DOWN.

333
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,875
- GOOD EXCUSE.
- DON'T JUDGE ME, CAT!

334
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,166
- ( roars )

335
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,791
( screeches )

336
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,000
- WHAT A HORRIBLE SOUND!
- IT'S HURTING MY EARS! 

337
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,625
- IT'S PREPARING TO ATTACK.
- THE LULLABY'S SONG!

338
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,500
- IT'S GOING TO
DEVOUR OUR SOULS!

339
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,791
- READY?

340
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,166
- Gray and Natsu:
OH, YEAH!

341
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,416
- REQUIP!

342
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,916
THE KNIGHT!

343
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,625
- AAH!

344
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,791
- ICE MAKE: LANCE.

345
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,000
( grunts )

346
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,791
- ( roars )

347
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,291
- NOW IT'S MY TURN!

348
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,916
FIRE DRAGON...

349
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,541
IRON FIST!

350
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,750
( grunts )

351
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,750
- HE JUST PUNCHED THE DEMON
WITH FIRE!

352
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,500
- I DIDN'T KNOW ICE MAGIC
COULD DO THAT.

353
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,208
- AND THE GIRL
COULD REQUIP HER ARMOR.

354
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:57,458
- YOU ARE MAKING ME ANGRY!

355
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,541
- ( grunting )

356
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:06,083
- I'M NOT FINISHED WITH YOU!

357
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,708
FIRE DRAGON...

358
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,916
WING ATTACK!

359
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,333
( shouts )

360
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,708
- THAT'S INCREDIBLE!

361
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,750
THEIR COMBINATION ATTACKS
ARE SO POWERFUL!

362
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,625
- AND THEY'RE IN SYNCH!
- AYE!

363
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,416
- ( roars )

364
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,500
- THIS CAN'T BE GOOD!

365
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:24,458
- HERE COMES ITS SONG!

366
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,000
- LOOK!  ALL THE PLANTS
ARE DYING!

367
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,375
- LULLABY IS SUCKING
THE LIFE OUT OF 'EM!

368
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:37,750
- JUST ONE NOTE AND YOUR SOULS
WILL BE MINE!

369
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,541
- ( all screaming )

370
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:43,541
- ( plays weak note )
HUH?

371
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,833
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- NOTHING HAPPENED.

372
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,666
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

373
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,875
WHY CAN'T I PLAY
MY MELODY OF DEATH?

374
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,708
- IT MUST BE BECAUSE OF
ALL THOSE ATTACKS.

375
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,500
- THEY PUNCHED SO MANY HOLES
IN THAT THING,

376
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,875
IT TOTALLY MESSED UP
ITS SOUND!

377
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,708
ALL THAT BUILD-UP
FOR THIS?

378
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,458
TALK ABOUT GOING OUT
WITH A WHIMPER.

379
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,291
- YEAH, FLUTES ARE
PRETTY LAME TO BEGIN WITH.

380
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,541
- YOU DARE MOCK ME?!
( grunts )

381
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:05,958
- NOW IT'S REALLY MAD!

382
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,375
- AS IF THINGS WEREN'T
BAD ENOUGH.

383
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:08,791
- ( growls )

384
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,000
- OOH...

385
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,166
- ICE MAKE...

386
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,625
SHIELD!

387
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,833
- OH, WOW!
- THAT BOY'S MAKER MAGIC

388
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,166
IS SPECTACULAR!

389
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,833
- WHAT'S MAKER MAGIC?

390
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:25,833
- ITS USERS CAN GIVE
MAGIC ENERGY A TANGIBLE FORM.

391
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:29,208
HOWEVER, THERE'S ANOTHER TYPE
OF MAGIC THAT CAN DESTROY IT.

392
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,208
- I WILL KILL YOU ALL!

393
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:38,083
- ( slurping )

394
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,541
OH, YEAH?

395
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,875
NOW I'VE GOT A FIRE
IN MY BELLY.

396
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,833
- YOU'RE NOT HUMAN!
YOU'RE A MONSTER!

397
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,041
- OH, LIKE YOU CAN TALK.

398
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,041
- STOP CLIMBING ME!

399
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,833
- REQUIP!

400
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,791
- OHH...
- HER ARMOR IS LOVELY.

401
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,416
- IT'S CALLED
BLACK WINGED ARMOR,

402
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,291
AND IT AMPLIFIES THE POWER
OF HER ATTACKS.

403
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,416
- ICE MAKE SAUCER!

404
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,458
- ( shouts )

405
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,875
- NATSU!
- NOW!

406
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,750
- I GOT THIS.

407
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,625
THE FLAMES
OF MY RIGHT HAND

408
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,541
AND THE FLAMES
OF MY LEFT.

409
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:16,416
PUT THE TWO TOGETHER...
( grunts )

410
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,791
( shouts )

411
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,000
...AND THIS IS WHAT YOU GET!

412
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,000
FIRE DRAGON...

413
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,250
BRILLIANT FLAME!

414
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,750
- ( screams )

415
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,500
- All: OHH...
- WELL DONE. 

416
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,250
- YOU'RE AMAZING.

417
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,583
- YOU KIDS MADE DEFEATING
 ZEREF'S DEMON LOOK EASY.

418
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,041
- ( giggles )

419
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,000
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW STRONG THEY ARE.

420
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,708
WOW.

421
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,583
ARE ALL OF THE
FAIRY TAIL WIZARDS

422
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,083
AS POWERFUL AS THESE THREE?

423
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,875
- THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
 THIS IS THE STRONGEST TEAM!

424
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,708
- AYE!
- WE'RE AN AWESOME GUILD,

425
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,041
AREN'T WE?!

426
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,666
- GREAT WORK OUT THERE, GUYS!

427
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,208
- THANKS, BUT IT WASN'T
A BIG DEAL.

428
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,625
- YEAH, PIECE OF CAKE.
- ( all chuckle )

429
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,708
- THEY MAY BE A BUNCH OF FOOLS,

430
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,333
BUT THEY'RE STRONGER
THAN I AM.

431
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,125
- YOUNG MAN,

432
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,791
WE'VE GOTTA GET YOU TO
A DOCTOR, YOU PRECIOUS THING.

433
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,458
- I CAN FEEL YOUR STUBBLE!

434
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,500
- I CAN'T EXACTLY SAY
I KNOW WHAT JUST HAPPENED,

435
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,500
BUT IT'S OBVIOUS WE OWE
A BIG ROUND OF THANKS

436
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,500
TO THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD.
- WE DO?

437
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,750
- EVEN SO, I MUST SAY--
- HMM?

438
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:38,458
- Masters:
...THEY WENT OVERBOARD!

439
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,291
- THE CONFERENCE HALL'S
BEEN DESTROYED!

440
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:43,708
- AYE!  THERE'S ALSO A COUPLE
OF MOUNTAIN TOPS MISSING.

441
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,791
- ( groans )
- AAH, MASTER!

442
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,583
- SOMETHING CAME OUT!
- ( laughs )

443
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,541
WE REALLY MADE A MESS
OF THE PLACE, HUH?

444
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,416
- PLEASE FORGIVE US, MASTER!
- ( Masters clamoring )

445
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,250
- I GUESS KIDS DO TAKE AFTER
THEIR PARENTS.

446
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:58,000
- THEY REMIND ME OF US
WHEN WE WERE YOUNG WIZARDS.

447
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,375
- BACK IN ANCIENT TIMES?
- YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,

448
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:01,916
I LOOKED JUST LIKE YOU,
KOGGIE.

449
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,875
- HUH?! - WE SO MUCH FUN
BACK IN THE OLD DAYS.

450
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,375
WE WERE MISCHIEVOUS KIDS,

451
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,041
SO THE COUNCIL WAS
ALWAYS ANGRY WITH US

452
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,958
FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER.

453
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,166
YOU SEE THAT STUD
IN THE AUBERGINE SUIT?

454
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,000
THAT'S ME.
- Kage: YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING!

455
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,083
- I WASN'T LYING WHEN I SAID
I LOOKED JUST LIKE YOU.

456
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,625
- I'M GONNA BE BALD AND FAT?!

457
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,458
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
NOW THAT YOU'VE SEEN

458
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,375
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE PART
OF A LEGITIMATE MAGICAL GUILD.

459
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,666
- THEY'RE MUCH MORE FUN
THAN THE DARK GUILDS.

460
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,666
- SOMETHING CAME OUT OF HIM.

461
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,000
- Natsu: YOU GUYS TRYING
TO CATCH SOMEBODY?

462
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,166
I'LL DO IT FOR YA!

463
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,708
- Masters: YOU'RE THE ONE
WE'RE AFTER!

464
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:33,125
- OH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT!
( laughs )

465
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:35,583
- ( all screaming )

466
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,000
- ( Happy shouts )

467
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,625
- ( end theme playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

468
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,958
- I'M HAVING MONEY ISSUES
AGAIN THIS MONTH.

469
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:18,291
- YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT BE
ABLE TO LIVE MORE COMFORTABLY

470
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,333
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
FOOT THE BILL

471
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,500
FOR ALL THE BUILDINGS AND TOWNS

472
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,541
YOU'VE DESTROYED.
- I COULD PAY MY RENT,

473
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:25,791
BUT IF I DO THAT,
I WON'T HAVE ANY MONEY FOR FOOD!

474
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:28,791
- OH, I KNOW. IF YOU ASK
NATSU TO TEACH YOU HIS MAGIC,

475
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:30,666
THEN YOU CAN JUST
EAT FIRE.

476
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,208
- ( Mira and Lucy speaking )

477
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,875
- GREAT THINKING, MIRA! THAT
WOULD SOLVE ALL MY PROBLEMS.

478
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,500
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SO SARCASTIC.

479
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:39,750
- I'M NOT!
SERIOUSLY, IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

480
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,541
- NOW YOU'RE JUST BEING MEAN.
