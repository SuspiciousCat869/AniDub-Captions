1
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,458
HEY, GUYS!  READY FOR
SOME MORE "FAIRY TAIL"?

2
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,208
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING,

3
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:23,541
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE ROOM,

4
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:27,166
AND DON'T SIT TOO CLOSE
TO THE TV.

5
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,958
- Erza:
PREVIOUSLY, ON FAIRY TAIL.

6
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:32,291
- Gray: JELLAL, ONE OF ERZA'S
OLD FRIENDS, IS PLANNING

7
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,916
TO RESURRECT THE EVIL WIZARD
ZEREF USING THE TOWER OF HEAVEN.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,625
WITH HELP FROM THE REST
OF HER OLD BUDDIES,

9
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,541
WE DEFEATED TRINITY RAVEN,

10
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,666
A TEAM FROM THE DARK GUILD,
DEATH'S HEAD ORDER, BUT NOW...

11
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,791
- HURRY, NATSU.
THE ETHERION IS ABOUT TO FIRE!

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,458
- ( theme music playing )

13
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:07,250
- ( singing in Japanese )

14
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:21,375
- ( thunder rumbling )

15
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:24,250
- Erza: WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOUR REAL GOAL IS, JELLAL?

16
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:28,291
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
THAT THE R-SYSTEM

17
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,458
HASN'T BEEN COMPLETED.

18
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,625
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING

19
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:35,000
SINCE I LEFT THIS PLACE
YEARS AGO?

20
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,416
RESEARCHING IT RELENTLESSLY.

21
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,500
AND I KNOW THAT EVEN THOUGH
THE TOWER ITSELF WAS CONSTRUCTED

22
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,000
EXACTLY LIKE THE BLUEPRINTS,

23
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,041
THERE'S STILL ONE THING
YOU DON'T HAVE--

24
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:47,083
A VITAL PART
TO ITS COMPLETION.

25
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:50,041
- THAT'S NOT TRUE, BECAUSE YOUR
SACRIFICE WILL COMPLETE IT.

26
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:54,500
- NO, SOMETHING EVEN
MORE BASIC THAN THAT.

27
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,000
MAGIC ENERGY.

28
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,250
I DON'T THINK YOU REALIZE
HOW MUCH MAGIC ENERGY

29
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:13,041
YOU'D HAVE TO ACCUMULATE JUST
TO ACTIVATE THE R-SYSTEM.

30
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,750
YOU COULD GATHER EVERY SINGLE
WIZARD ON THE CONTINENT

31
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,250
AND YOU STILL WOULDN'T HAVE
ENOUGH POWER TO PULL IT OFF.

32
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,583
THIS TOWER DOESN'T
HAVE THE CAPACITY

33
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,916
TO STORE THAT MUCH MAGIC ENERGY
WITHIN ITS WALLS,

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,208
AND YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T DO IT
ON YOUR OWN.

35
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:28,916
I FIND IT HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS THAT
YOU HAVEN'T TRIED TO ESCAPE,

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,083
DESPITE KNOWING THE COUNCIL'S
PREPARING TO ATTACK.

37
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,458
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

38
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:37,208
- ONLY THREE MORE MINUTES
UNTIL THE ETHERION FIRES.

39
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:41,041
- ANSWER ME.  YOU KNOW YOUR
DREAM WILL NEVER COME TRUE

40
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,458
SO WHY ARE YOU WILLING
TO RISK YOUR LIFE?

41
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,958
DO YOU WANT TO DIE?

42
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,041
IF THAT'S THE CASE,
THEN WE'LL GO TOGETHER.

43
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,916
I'LL STAY HERE
TO HOLD YOU DOWN,

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,500
AND I WON'T LET GO
TILL THE BITTER END.

45
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:55,000
- TO BE HONEST,
THAT DOESN'T SOUND SO BAD.

46
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:59,791
I NO LONGER HAVE CONTROL OVER
MY OWN BODY AND SOUL

47
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,000
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN POSSESSED
BY ZEREF.

48
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,666
I'M MERELY A PUPPET
HE'S MANIPULATING IN ORDER

49
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,791
TO BECOME FLESH AGAIN.

50
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,291
- YOU WERE POSSESSED BY HIM?

51
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,958
- I WASN'T ABLE TO SAVE MYSELF

52
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:15,291
AND NOT EVEN MY CLOSEST FRIENDS
WERE THERE TO COME TO MY RESCUE.

53
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,791
THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED

54
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:21,625
THERE IS NO HEAVEN, NOR DOES
TRUE FREEDOM REALLY EXIST.

55
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:27,666
ALL OF CREATION WAS FINISHED
BEFORE IT EVEN BEGAN.

56
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,541
- THE FINAL ETHERION FIRING
PHASE HAS BEEN COMPLETED.

57
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,666
- NOW DEPLOYING
THE SATELLITE SQUARE.

58
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,500
- DISPLACEMENT LACRIMAE SHOW
ALL SIGNS NORMAL.

59
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,916
- COORDINATES ARE LOCKED.

60
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
- MAGIC FUSION APPEARS
TO BE STABLE.

61
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,666
- START THE COUNTDOWN.

62
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,625
- LET US PRAY.

63
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,666
- LET US PRAY.
- FOR THE INNOCENT.

64
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,500
- LET US PRAY.

65
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,416
- FOR THE END.

66
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,791
- Lucy:
WHAT'S THAT BRIGHT LIGHT?

67
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,583
- Wally:
GOTTA BE THE ETHERION.

68
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,875
- OH, NO.
COME ON YOU GUYS.

69
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,916
HURRY UP AND GET OUT
OF THERE NOW.

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,541
- Jellal: DEEP DOWN I KNEW THE
R-SYSTEM COULDN'T BE COMPLETED,

71
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,916
BUT ZEREF KEPT PUSHING ME.

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,208
HE FORCED ME TO CONTINUE
THE TOWER'S CONSTRUCTION.

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,416
I WANTED TO STOP,
BUT I COULDN'T.

74
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,916
IT'S LIKE I WAS A FREIGHT TRAIN
WITH NO BRAKES.

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,041
I SURRENDER.

76
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,916
GO AHEAD AND FINISH ME.

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,875
ISN'T THAT WHY YOU CAME
LOOKING FOR ME?

78
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,916
- ( whimpering )

79
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,708
- THERE'S NO NEED FOR ME
TO SPILL YOUR BLOOD

80
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,208
WITH MY OWN HANDS.
THE SATELLITE SQUARE IS FOCUSED,

81
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,333
AND THE ETHERION WILL FIRE
ANY MINUTE NOW.

82
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,791
THAT MEANS THIS IS THE END

83
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,458
FOR BOTH YOU

84
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,875
AND ME.

85
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:14,375
- IT IS A GRIM FATE
THAT WE SHARE.

86
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,875
- SO ALL THIS TIME YOU WERE
JUST ANOTHER OF ZEREF'S VICTIMS.

87
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:21,541
- IT'S MY OWN FAULT.  I LET
MY WEAKNESS GET THE BEST OF ME.

88
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,750
THE RIFT BETWEEN MY DREAM
AND REALITY WAS TOO DEEP

89
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,041
FOR MY MIND TO COMPREHEND.

90
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,208
- THE ONLY PEOPLE CAPABLE
OF SAVING YOU

91
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,500
FROM YOUR FLAWS
AND YOUR INNER WEAKNESS

92
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:34,458
ARE THOSE WHO YOU CALL
YOUR FRIENDS.

93
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,500
- THAT'S TRUE.

94
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:41,500
- I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING ABLE
TO SAVE YOU BACK THEN.

95
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,375
CAN YOU FORGIVE ME?

96
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,958
- ERZA.

97
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,000
YOU HAVE SAVED ME.

98
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,458
- WE PRAY TO THE SACRED LIGHT
FOR FORGIVENESS.

99
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,583
LET US FIRE THE ETHERION
AT ONCE.

100
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,208
- IT'S HEADED STRAIGHT
FOR THE TOWER.

101
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,916
- NATSU.  ERZA.

102
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,916
- THAT LIGHT.

103
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,416
WE DIDN'T MAKE IT IN TIME.

104
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,291
- ( panting ) ERZA!

105
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,708
- THIS IS THE END.

106
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,791
- ( all shouting )

107
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,333
- ETHERION HAS IMPACTED
THE TARGET.

108
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,291
- WAS THE TARGET SUCCESSFULLY
DESTROYED?  I NEED CONFIRMATION.

109
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:19,291
- THE DENSITY OF THE ETHER-NANO
FUSION IS INCREASING.

110
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,791
EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS
ARE EXPECTED.

111
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,375
- ( sighing )

112
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,958
- WHO KNOWS HOW MANY
INNOCENT PEOPLE

113
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,958
MIGHT HAVE BEEN INSIDE
THAT TOWER.

114
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,916
- BUT THEY WERE THERE FOR THE
SOLE PURPOSE

115
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,458
OF RESURRECTING ZEREF.

116
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:33,458
THEIR SACRIFICE HAD TO BE MADE
TO SAVE THE LIVES OF OTHERS.

117
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,125
- I UNDERSTAND THAT, MICHELLO,

118
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,375
BUT IT'S STILL HEARTBREAKING
ALL THE SAME.

119
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,791
I SINCERELY DOUBT THE VICTIMS'
FAMILIES WILL BE COMFORTED

120
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,416
BY THAT REASONING.

121
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,750
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?
- OH, NO.  DID WE LOSE 'EM?

122
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,333
- WE'RE STILL ALIVE?

123
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:13,291
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

124
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,416
- ( cackling )

125
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,708
- ETHER-NANO NEUTRALIZERS
DETECTED AT THE EPICENTER.

126
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,083
NO, WAIT A MINUTE,
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

127
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,500
- THERE'S BEEN A SUDDEN DROP
IN FUSION DENSITY.

128
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,541
- PICKING UP HIGH LEVELS OF
MAGIC ENERGY

129
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,583
FROM ANOTHER SOURCE.

130
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,250
- THE COUNTER CAN'T KEEP UP
WITH IT.

131
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,375
- WHAT COULD IT BE?
- RESTORING VISUAL FEED.

132
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:38,833
- A CRYSTAL?
- NO, NOT A CRYSTAL.

133
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,791
THAT'S A LACRIMA.

134
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,666
- SO YOU THINK THEY'RE OKAY?

135
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,166
MAYBE THEY SURVIVED THE BLAST
AND THEY'RE STILL INSIDE.

136
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,333
- WHAT IN THE HECK JUST HAPPENED
TO THIS PLACE?

137
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,416
- THE ETHERION WAS FIRED,

138
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,833
BUT I SHOULDN'T HAVE SURVIVED
THE BLAST.

139
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,791
- ( laughing ) IT'S HERE.

140
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,375
AT LONG LAST, MY HOUR
OF GLORY HAS ARRIVED.

141
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,541
- GLORY?

142
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,875
- THIS IS THE TRUE FORM
OF THE TOWER OF HEAVEN.

143
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,500
A GIANT,
MAGICAL LACRIMA CRYSTAL.

144
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,416
THANKS TO THE COUNCIL,
IT'S READY TO ACTIVATE.

145
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,375
THE ETHERION'S MAGIC ENERGY
PROVIDED THE MISSING PIECE

146
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,458
OF THE PUZZLE,

147
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:23,458
WHICH MEANS THE R-SYSTEM
IS NOW COMPLETE.

148
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,458
- ( gasps )

149
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,708
- THE TARGET IS STILL STANDING.
- IT'S A GIANT LACRIMA.

150
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,708
- I THINK IT ACTUALLY ABSORBED
THE MAGIC ENERGY

151
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:34,125
OF THE ETHERION BLAST.
- IMPOSSIBLE.

152
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:40,291
- SIEGRAIN, I THINK IT'S TIME
YOU START EXPLAINING YOURSELF.

153
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,875
HE DISAPPEARED.

154
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:02,125
- SO I WAS YOUR PAWN.

155
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,375
- YOUR EXPRESSION
WAS PRICELESS, ERZA.

156
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,291
- ( gasps )

157
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,541
- HE ISN'T CAPABLE OF PUTTING
FORTH HIS FULL POWER RIGHT NOW.

158
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,500
SO HE HAD TO MANIPULATE YOU
IN ORDER TO SAVE HIMSELF.

159
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,916
- SIEGRAIN.

160
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,541
I DON'T UNDERSTAND,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

161
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,916
- THIS REMINDS ME
OF WHEN WE FIRST MET YEARS AGO.

162
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,500
DO YOU REMEMBER?

163
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,083
YOU ACCOMPANIED MAKAROV
TO THE MAGIC COUNCIL

164
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:44,416
TO SUBMIT A WRITTEN APOLOGY
FOR DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY.

165
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,708
- SHE ATTACKED ME
OUT OF NOWHERE.

166
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,541
SHE MUST'VE MISTAKEN ME
FOR YOU.

167
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:52,416
- I CAN'T SAY I BLAME HER,
AFTER ALL WE DO LOOK ALIKE.

168
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,250
YOU REFUSED TO LET UP UNTIL
I CONFESSED TO YOU

169
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,791
THAT I WAS HIS TWIN,
BUT STILL, YOU WERE HOSTILE

170
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,916
TOWARDS ME
FROM THAT DAY FORWARD.

171
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,541
- WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?  IF YOU
TRULY CARED ABOUT YOUR BROTHER,

172
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,541
YOU WOULD'VE TRIED TO STOP HIM
INSTEAD OF HELPING HIM

173
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,291
COVER HIS TRACKS, AND I KNOW
YOU'VE BEEN SPYING ON ME

174
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,666
AND REPORTING BACK TO HIM.

175
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,833
- IS THAT SO?
- A MISTAKE ON MY PART.

176
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,333
IN RETROSPECT, PERHAPS I
SHOULD'VE SAID SOMETHING

177
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,541
THAT WOULD'VE CONVINCED YOU
I WAS GOING TO FIND JELLAL

178
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,791
AND KILL HIM, BUT MY BIGGEST
MISTAKE WAS RUNNING INTO YOU

179
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,750
IN THE FIRST PLACE, ESPECIALLY
AFTER THE TROUBLE I WENT THROUGH

180
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,625
TO BECOME A COUNCIL MEMBER.

181
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:27,041
- THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN
HAVING TO COME UP WITH EXCUSES

182
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,583
ON THE SPOT.
- I GET IT.

183
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,458
SO THE TWO OF YOU HAVE BEEN
CONSPIRING THIS WHOLE TIME.

184
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:35,750
- CONSPIRING?
- NOT EXACTLY.

185
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:39,416
- I'M AFRAID IT'S MORE
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

186
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,916
- ( gasps )
- WE'RE NOT TWINS,

187
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,750
BUT TWO FACES OF ONE PERSON,

188
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,291
AND WE HAVE BEEN
FROM THE START.

189
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,958
- BUT HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
WAS HE JUST A PROJECTION?

190
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:02,416
- YOU NEVER SUSPECTED FOR A
MOMENT WE WERE ONE AND THE SAME.

191
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,375
- THEN YOU'RE THE
ONE RESPONSIBLE

192
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,250
FOR FIRING THE ETHERION.

193
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,833
DID YOU WORM YOUR WAY
ONTO THE COUNCIL JUST FOR THAT?

194
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,291
- I HOPE YOU ENJOYED
THE FREEDOM I GRANTED YOU

195
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,208
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO.  YOUR
RELEASE AND EVERYTHING AFTER

196
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,791
WAS ALL PART OF MY PLAN
TO RESURRECT ZEREF.

197
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,500
- HOW CAN YOU LIVE
WITH YOURSELF

198
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,625
KNOWING THAT YOUR ENTIRE LIFE
HAS BEEN ONE BIG LIE?

199
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,125
- MAGIC ENERGY.

200
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:28,083
I CAN FEEL IT SURGING
THROUGH MY BODY.

201
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,208
- A HUGE AMOUNT OF MAGIC ENERGY
IS BUILDING UP

202
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,708
IN THE TOWER OF HEAVEN.

203
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,250
- IF TOO MUCH POWER IS CONTAINED
IN ONE PLACE,

204
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,083
IT'S SURE TO EXPLODE.

205
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:38,500
- WE'VE BEEN HAD.

206
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:41,375
- WHAT'S HAPPENING
TO THE BUILDING?

207
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,375
- IT'S LIKE IT'S STARTING
TO AGE AND COLLAPSE.

208
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,208
- THIS HAS TO BE
THE ARC OF TIME,

209
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,583
BUT THAT'S ONE
OF THE LOST MAGICS.

210
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,916
- ( shouting )

211
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,333
- NO, ULTEAR!

212
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,750
- THIS IS ALL
FOR MASTER SIEGRAIN.

213
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:07,375
I SUPPOSE I SHOULD SAY
MASTER JELLAL.

214
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:10,125
ALL OF HIS HARD WORK
HAS PAID OFF

215
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,791
AND NOW HIS LIFELONG DREAM
WILL BECOME A REALITY.

216
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:16,500
- Gray: THAT GIANT LACRIMA
IS THE R-SYSTEM?

217
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,541
YEAH, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I SEEN IT IN ACTION,

218
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,458
BUT I THINK THAT'S WHAT JELLAL
WAS TALKING ABOUT.

219
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,833
- OH, NO,
IT'S BEEN ACTIVATED.

220
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,500
- AND WHAT THE HECK
DOES THAT MEAN?

221
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,666
ARE YOU SAYING ZEREF'S ABOUT
TO BE RESURRECTED?

222
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,500
- WE DON'T KNOW.  WE MAY HAVE
HELPED JELLAL BUILD IT,

223
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,791
BUT WE'VE NEVER SEEN IT
ACTIVATED BEFORE.

224
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,541
- AND NOW NATSU AND ERZA ARE
TRAPPED INSIDE THAT THING.

225
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,208
- Sho: THAT'S RIGHT.

226
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:40,041
ALONG WITH SIMON AND JELLAL.

227
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,125
- ( grunting )

228
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:46,625
- LOOKS AS THOUGH SOMEONE'S
A LITTLE WORSE FOR WEAR.

229
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,083
DON'T TELL ME YOU USED UP ALL
YOUR MAGIC ENERGY

230
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,041
FIGHTING AGAINST IKARUGA.

231
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,708
- JELLAL, YOU'RE THROUGH!

232
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,625
- ( laughs ) THE MAGIC
COUNCIL'S HEADQUARTERS

233
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,916
IS LITTLE MORE THAN A PILE
OF RUBBLE BY NOW.

234
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,875
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT
A BLESSING ULTEAR HAS BEEN.

235
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,166
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT HER.

236
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,250
SHE HAS NO FEAR OF DEATH BECAUSE
SHE BELIEVES THAT ALL OF MANKIND

237
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,125
WILL BECOME ONE IN HEAVEN.

238
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,708
IN FACT, SHE TOLD ME SHE'D BE
MORE THAN HAPPY TO GIVE HER LIFE

239
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,791
IF IT MEANT MY DREAM WOULD COME
TO FRUITION.

240
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,375
THAT REMINDS ME.

241
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,875
I SHOULD THANK HER FOR BEING
AN IGNORANT FOOL

242
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,250
WHO'S EASY TO MANIPULATE.
- CURSE YOU!

243
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:38,625
I'M TAKING REVENGE FOR ALL
THE PEOPLE YOU'VE ABUSED.

244
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:41,583
THIS IS THE END, JELLAL.
I'LL KILL YOU!  AGH!

245
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,375
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO MY ARM?

246
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,625
- IT'S JUST A BIND SNAKE.

247
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,458
I SLIPPED IT ONTO YOU DURING OUR
HEARTWARMING EMBRACE EARLIER.

248
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,916
- ( screaming )

249
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,125
- NOW THAT I'VE COLLECTED
THE PRECISE AMOUNT

250
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,666
OF MAGIC ENERGY NEEDED

251
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,625
FOR THE R-SYSTEM, THERE'S ONE
MORE THING THAT MUST BE DONE

252
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,375
BEFORE ZEREF
CAN BE RESURRECTED.

253
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,666
THIS IS WHERE YOU
TAKE CENTER STAGE

254
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,833
FOR YOUR MOMENT
IN THE SPOTLIGHT, MY DEAR.

255
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:11,791
THE MAGIC ENERGY HELD WITHIN
THIS LACRIMA MUST BE FUSED

256
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,333
WITH THE BODY OF MY SACRIFICE.

257
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,750
ONCE THAT HAPPENS,
YOUR FLESH WILL BREAK DOWN

258
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:20,250
AND RECONSTRUCT ITSELF
TO CREATE ZEREF'S BODY.

259
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,708
- ( screaming )

260
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:32,208
- YOU KNOW,
I REALLY DID LOVE YOU, ERZA.

261
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,208
- NO.  STOP!

262
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,541
- OH GREAT AND POWERFUL ZEREF,

263
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,708
I CALL UPON YOU

264
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:47,500
TO OFFER YOU THIS WOMAN'S FLESH.

265
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,125
- DON'T DO THIS.

266
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,125
PLEASE, JELLAL!

267
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,833
- I GOT YOU.

268
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,500
ERZA'S AN IMPORTANT PART
OF OUR FAIRY TAIL FAMILY.

269
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,041
I WON'T LET YOU TOUCH HER.

270
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,583
- NATSU.

271
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:21,625
- JEEZ, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HANGING AROUND WITH THIS LOSER?

272
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,250
IF WE DON'T HURRY
AND GET BACK TO WORK,

273
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,416
LUCY'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO PAY HER RENT.

274
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,333
TRUST ME, YOU DON'T WANNA
MAKE HER ANGRY.

275
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,750
- SORRY, BUT I CAN'T MOVE.

276
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,416
- NO WAY. ( cackles )

277
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,791
TIME FOR SOME SERIOUS PAYBACK.
- ( laughing )

278
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,416
- THIS IS WHAT YOU GET
FOR ALWAYS TICKLING ME.

279
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,833
- THIS IS SERIOUS,
SO QUIT GOOFING OFF.  STOP IT!

280
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:41,000
NATSU, YOU'VE GOTTA GET OUT
OF HERE AS FAST AS YOU CAN.

281
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,833
- I AIN'T LEAVING.  IF YOU
CAN'T DO THE FIGHTING YOURSELF,

282
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,333
THEN I'LL JUST HAVE TO
DO IT FOR YOU.

283
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,541
- YOU CAN'T.
HE'S TOO POWERFUL.

284
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,916
BESIDES, YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HIM.

285
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,875
- WHO SAYS I NEED TO KNOW
THE GUY TO BEAT HIM UP?

286
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,375
- PLEASE.

287
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:57,291
JUST THIS ONCE,
DO AS I ASK YOU.

288
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:03,000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- HONESTLY, I DON'T REALLY KNOW

289
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,583
YOU ALL THAT WELL, EITHER,

290
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,625
BUT I CAN STILL TAKE YOU DOWN.
- ( grunts )

291
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:17,208
- YOU'RE EVEN FOOLHARDIER THAN
THE RUMORS MAKE YOU OUT TO BE.

292
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,166
WHAT KIND OF SICK SATISFACTION
DO YOU GET

293
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,833
FROM STRIKING
A DEFENSELESS FRIEND?

294
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,791
- I HAD TO DO IT.

295
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,750
'CAUSE SHE WAS CRYING.

296
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,916
SHE LOOKED SO WEAK
AND FRAGILE.

297
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,708
HER VOICE WAS TREMBLING
WITH FEAR.

298
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,833
I DON'T WANNA SEE ERZA
LIKE THAT.

299
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:43,083
I'VE ALWAYS LOOKED UP
TO HER AS A STRONG WARRIOR.

300
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,750
AND WHEN SHE WAKES UP
FROM THIS NIGHTMARE,

301
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,041
I WANT HER TO FEEL LIKE
HER OLD SELF AGAIN.

302
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,583
IF YOU WANNA GET TO HER,
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO THROUGH ME.

303
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:57,208
- IS THAT A CHALLENGE?
CONSIDER MY INTEREST PIQUED.

304
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:00,500
I WOULD LOVE TO WITNESS
THE POWER OF A DRAGON SLAYER.

305
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,291
- ( screaming )

306
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,291
FIRE DRAGON WING ATTACK!

307
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,875
FIRE DRAGON TALON!

308
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,541
FIRE DRAGON ROAR!

309
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:44,708
- IS THAT THE BEST YOU CAN DO?
( laughs )

310
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,958
I EXPECTED MORE FROM YOU,

311
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:51,416
NATSU DRAGNEEL,
SON OF IGNEEL.

312
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,708
I WAS HOPING TO GET A TASTE
OF THE DESTRUCTIVE MIGHT

313
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,083
OF A DRAGON SLAYER BEFORE
I STARTED RIPPING YOU TO SHREDS

314
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,708
WITH MY BARE HANDS,
BUT IF THAT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT,

315
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:04,208
I WON'T WASTE MY TIME.
- I'LL SHOW YOU!

316
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,750
- YOU MUST BE PUNISHED
FOR DISRUPTING MY CEREMONY.

317
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,958
PREPARE TO BE DESTROYED
BY MY HEAVENLY BODY MAGIC.

318
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,166
METEOR!

319
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,333
- ( grunts )
MAN, THIS GUY IS FAST.

320
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,750
I'LL HAVE TO RELY
ON ALL MY SENSES TO FIGHT HIM.

321
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,916
SOUND, FEELING, HIS SCENT.

322
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,541
IF I CONCENTRATE I CAN PREDICT
HIS NEXT MOVE.  STAY FOCUSED.

323
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,458
GOT YA!

324
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:42,250
( grunting ) WHY DOES IT SEEM
LIKE HE'S GETTING FASTER?

325
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:46,291
- BE GLAD YOU GOT YOUR HITS IN
'CAUSE IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

326
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,041
AND NOW I'LL SHOW YOU
THE TRUE DESTRUCTIVE POWER

327
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,000
OF DARKNESS MAGIC.

328
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:05,833
MAY THE SEVEN STARS
BRING JUDGMENT UPON YOU.

329
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:09,125
SEVEN STAR SWORD,
GRAND CHARIOT!

330
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,333
- ( groaning )

331
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,541
- THAT SPELL PACKS AS MUCH
OF A PUNCH AS BEING HIT

332
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,375
BY A FALLING METEOR.

333
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,375
I'M SURPRISED HIS BODY'S STILL
IN ONE PIECE

334
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:30,791
AFTER BEING HIT WITH IT.
PERHAPS THAT WAS A LITTLE MUCH.

335
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,500
THE R-SYSTEM CAN'T AFFORD
TO SUFFER ANY MORE DAMAGE

336
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,958
OR IT'LL BE RENDERED USELESS.

337
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:38,958
I CAN FEEL THE MAGIC ENERGY
BEGINNING TO LEAK OUT.

338
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:42,083
I'LL HAVE TO HURRY.

339
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,208
IT'S TIME, ERZA.

340
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,958
- ( grunting )

341
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,750
YOU FEEL THAT?

342
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,333
IT WAS MY SNEAK ATTACK.

343
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:12,625
SO NOW THAT THE TOWER'S
A GIANT CRYSTAL,

344
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:16,083
I GUESS SHATTERING IT
WOULD SCREW UP YOUR PLANS.

345
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,458
THIS IS NOT YOUR DAY, BUDDY.

346
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:23,416
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

347
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,416
- COME ON, DIDN'T YOU KNOW
THAT DESTROYING STUFF

348
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,791
IS WHAT US FAIRY TAIL
WIZARDS ARE BEST AT?

349
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:30,875
NOW I'M ALL FIRED UP.

350
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,750
MORE THAN I'VE EVER BEEN BEFORE.

351
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:37,250
- YOU WON'T GET IN MY WAY!

352
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,833
- ( end theme playing )

353
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

354
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:15,750
- Happy: THE MAGIC ENERGY INSIDE
THE TOWER IS OUT OF CONTROL.

355
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:18,208
IF WE DON'T STOP IT,
IT'S GONNA EXPLODE.

356
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,125
- Natsu:
I'M NOT GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN.

357
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,125
THERE'S GOTTA BE A WAY TO STOP
IT.  WHAT ARE YOU DOING, ERZA?

358
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:25,458
IF YOU GO BACK INSIDE THAT THING
I'LL HAVE TO PULL YOU OUT AGAIN.

359
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:27,583
- Happy: ARE YOU TRYING TO FUSE
YOUR BODY WITH THE LACRIMA

360
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,041
TO ABSORB THE MAGIC ENERGY

361
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:31,166
AND KEEP IT FROM BLOWING UP?
- Natsu: NO, DON'T DO IT!

362
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:33,333
( - Happy and Natsu speaking )

363
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:36,208
- Happy: THE TOWER JUST VANISHED
INTO THIN AIR.

364
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:39,208
- Natsu: THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

365
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:41,416
ERZA!
