1
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,208
HEY GUYS!  READY FOR
SOME MORE "FAIRY TAIL"?

2
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:22,000
JUST MAKE SURE
THAT WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING,

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:23,791
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE ROOM,

4
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,875
AND DON'T SIT TOO CLOSE
TO THE TV!

5
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:30,333
- Makarov:
PREVIOUSLY, ON "FAIRY TAIL"...

6
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:31,916
- Lucy: OH, NO!

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,375
LAXUS AND THE THUNDER LEGION
SHOWED UP

8
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,000
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE HARVEST FESTIVAL

9
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,208
AND STORMED
THE MISS FAIRY TAIL CONTEST!

10
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,500
NOW THEY'VE TAKEN ALL THE GIRLS
FROM THE GUILD HOSTAGE

11
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,291
AND THEY'RE FORCING THE GUYS 
TO FIGHT EACH OTHER!

12
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,375
I GOTTA DO SOMETHING!

13
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:46,000
ONLY I CAN'T
'CAUSE THEY TURNED ME TO STONE!

14
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,416
- ( theme music playing )

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,875
- ( singing in Japanese )

16
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,208
- I HEARD THERE'S BEEN
SOME TROUBLE WITH FAIRY TAIL.

17
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,791
DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON?
- NOPE, I DON'T HAVE A CLUE.

18
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,375
I DID HEAR SOMEONE SAY
THE MEMBERS

19
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,000
WEREN'T GETTING ALONG
TOO WELL.

20
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,833
- WELL, IT SEEMS THINGS
HAVE GOTTEN WORSE

21
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,541
'CAUSE I JUST SAW
A COUPLE OF THOSE BOYS

22
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,291
FIGHTING EACH OTHER
OUT IN THE STREET!

23
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,125
- YOU DON'T THINK
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO CANCEL

24
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,666
THE FANTASIA PARADE, DO YA?
- WHO KNOWS?

25
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,583
- WHAT A SHAME.
- All: AH!

26
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,250
- HEY, LOOK,
THERE'S ONE OF 'EM NOW!

27
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,916
- YOU PUNKS BETTER QUIT
TEARIN' UP OUR TOWN!

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,541
- Vijeeter: TOWNSPEOPLE?

29
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,041
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

30
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,875
WHY DOESN'T
THE ENCHANTMENT AFFECT THEM?

31
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,375
I GUESS FRIED MADE IT
SO THE BARRIER'S RULES

32
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,458
ONLY APPLY TO WIZARDS
FROM THE GUILD.

33
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,416
- Nab: VIJEETER! 
- NAB!

34
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,416
- SIT STILL
SO I CAN FINISH YOU OFF!

35
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,708
I HATE TO DO THIS TO YA, PAL,
BUT RULES ARE RULES

36
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:00,333
AND I CAN'T FIGHT LAXUS
TILL I BEAT YOU!

37
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:03,125
- I WAS HOPING I WOULDN'T
HAVE TO HURT ONE OF MY FRIENDS.

38
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:04,958
PITY.
BUT YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE!

39
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,166
- AH!

40
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,000
- YAAH!

41
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,416
- JUST GIVE UP!

42
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,875
YOU KNOW I CAN SEE
THROUGH YOUR PLANS, MAX!

43
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,458
IF YOU THINK
YOU CAN SURPRISE ME

44
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,000
WITH YOUR SAND MAGIC,
YOU'RE WRONG!

45
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,666
- YOUR FAMOUS TELEPATHY, HUH?

46
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,583
JUST 'CAUSE YOU
CAN READ MY ATTACKS

47
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,750
DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE FAST ENOUGH
TO DODGE, WISE GUY!

48
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,250
- AHH!
- BETTER NOT BLINK!

49
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,291
- SAW THAT COMING A MILE AWAY!

50
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,958
- HEY, IS THIS PART
OF THE FESTIVAL?

51
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,541
- WITH THEM,
YOU NEVER KNOW.

52
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,375
- I JUST HOPE THEY CLEAN UP
AFTER THEMSELVES.

53
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,291
- ( Happy speaking ) 

54
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,166
- I'M GONNA SAVE MIRA,

55
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,708
EVEN IF IT MEANS
I GOTTA FIGHT YOU.

56
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,333
- I TAKE IT YOUR WIFE
DOESN'T KNOW

57
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,208
ABOUT YOUR LITTLE CRUSH, HUH?

58
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,750
- YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS
'CAUSE YOUR WIFE LEFT YOU.

59
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,625
- YOU CROSSED THE LINE, BUD.

60
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,291
- LAKI, ARE YOU TRYING
TO ONE-UP US WITH YOUR NEW LOOK?

61
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,791
- HOPING MORE PEOPLE
WILL NOTICE YOU?

62
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,458
- WELL, I THINK
YOU LOOK LIKE TRASH!

63
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,500
- YOU WEREN'T GONNA ENTER
THE PAGEANT, WERE YOU?

64
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,083
- WHO KNEW I COULD CAUSE SUCH A
FUSS OVER A LITTLE HAIR CHOP?

65
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,791
I FEEL LIKE A SUPERSTAR!
- OH, SHUT UP!

66
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,041
WE'RE GONNA TEACH YOU
A LESSON!

67
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,458
- MUD SHOT!

68
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,375
- HMM.
- AHH!

69
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,458
- "MAX VERSUS WARREN. THE WINNER
IS WARREN."

70
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:16,833
"VIJEETER VERSUS NAB.
THE WINNER IS NAB."

71
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:21,375
"LAKI DEFEATS FOUR OTHERS. MACAO
VERSUS WAKABA, IN PROGRESS."

72
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,416
- FOOLISH CHILDREN!

73
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,250
WHAT DO THEY THINK
THEY'RE DOING?

74
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:27,125
- THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY
CHOICE BUT TO FIGHT EACH OTHER.

75
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,000
THOSE ENCHANTMENTS
ARE HIDDEN ALL OVER TOWN

76
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,666
SO THEY'RE IMPOSSIBLE
TO AVOID.

77
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,500
IT'S JUST LIKE LAXUS SAID--

78
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,000
THIS IS
THE BATTLE OF FAIRY TAIL.

79
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:38,375
- BUT WHY?
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE!

80
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,208
( grunts )

81
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,333
- NATSU.

82
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,458
- I WANNA FIGHT TOO!

83
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,375
- Both: IS THAT ALL?
- OH MAN, YOU SUCK!

84
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,333
GO AWAY, INVISIBLE WALL!

85
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,375
- WHY DO YOU WANT TO FIGHT
YOUR FRIENDS?

86
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,583
'CAUSE IT'S A TOURNAMENT
TO SEE WHO'S THE STRONGEST!

87
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,625
- THIS IS NOT A TOURNAMENT!

88
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,791
IT'S NOTHING BUT A TRAP.

89
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:02,583
LAXUS IS PLAYING YOU
LIKE A BUNCH OF PAWNS.

90
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,333
IF WE CAN'T BEAT
THE THUNDER LEGION IN TIME,

91
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,583
THE GIRLS ARE GOING
TO BE SMASHED TO PIECES.

92
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,583
I KNOW THAT EVERYONE'S TRYING
TO KEEP THAT FROM HAPPENING,

93
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:15,208
BUT THEY'RE GOING ABOUT IT
IN THE WRONG WAY.

94
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,416
IF WE KEEP
FIGHTING AMONGST OURSELVES

95
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,291
THEN THE GIRLS ARE AS GOOD
AS FINISHED.

96
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:22,000
WE CAN'T LET LAXUS WIN.
- Natsu: C'MON, GRAMPS,

97
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,625
YOU DON'T SERIOUSLY THINK
HE'D HURT EM, DO YOU?

98
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,750
I KNOW HE CAN BE A REAL PAIN
SOMETIMES,

99
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:30,083
BUT HE'S STILL ONE OF US.
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A BLUFF.

100
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,875
- YOU THINK SO?

101
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,083
- THERE'S A FIGHTING FESTIVAL
GOIN' ON OUT THERE!

102
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,000
WHY DO I GOTTA BE STUCK
IN THIS DUMP?

103
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,708
- BEATS ME.
I CAN GO THROUGH JUST FINE.

104
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,791
- DOES THIS MEAN I'M OVER 80
AND NO ONE EVER TOLD ME?

105
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,208
'CAUSE I'D KNOW
IF I WAS A STONE STATUE, RIGHT?

106
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,666
- AND HERE I THOUGHT
WE KNEW EACH OTHER, NATSU.

107
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,666
- YOU STILL THINK OF LAXUS
AS PART OF THE GUILD?

108
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,208
EVEN AFTER ALL THIS,
YOU DON'T BELIEVE

109
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,666
HE'D HARM HIS FELLOW MEMBERS?

110
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,958
"TIME REMAINING:
TWO HOURS AND 18 MINUTES.

111
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:02,208
PARTICIPANTS REMAINING: 42."

112
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,833
- THAT CAN'T BE
ALL THAT'S LEFT.

113
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,583
THAT MEANS
MORE THAN HALF THE GUILD

114
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,625
HAS WIPED ITSELF OUT
IN LESS THAN AN HOUR.

115
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:11,666
- HERE GOES!
PURPLE RAIN!

116
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,625
- AHHH!

117
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,375
- OH, CRAP!
THAT WAS MY SMOKE FAKE.

118
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,500
YOU'RE LOSING
YOUR EDGE, MAN.

119
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:23,458
BUT YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN TOO SOFT
FOR YOU OWN GOOD, RIGHT, BUDDY?

120
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,291
- ( men screaming )

121
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,875
- Reedus: I'M TIRED
BUT I CAN'T GIVE UP.

122
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,958
I GOTTA MAKE IT
TO THE EAST FOREST.

123
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:32,000
THE MASTER'S COUNTING ON ME TO
GET THAT REMEDY FROM PORLYUSICA!

124
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,833
I GOTTA DO IT
FOR THE GIRLS!

125
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,791
NO, IT CAN'T BE!

126
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,791
DON'T TELL ME FRIED SET UP
AN ENCHANTMENT

127
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,333
AROUND THE ENTIRE TOWN!

128
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,500
- YOU'RE NOT ATTEMPTING TO
BREAK THE RULES OF THE GAME,

129
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:49,541
ARE YOU?

130
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,541
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

131
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,041
- AS LAXUS SAID,
THE ENTIRE TOWN OF MAGNOLIA

132
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,083
IS YOUR BATTLEFIELD
AND YOUR GUILD ALLIES

133
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,291
ARE NOW YOUR OPPONENTS.

134
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,958
IF YOU ARE A WIZARD,
THEN YOU MUST FIGHT!

135
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,875
SORRY, THAT'S THE RULE.

136
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:08,000
- LET'S CHECK ON GRAY.

137
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,166
- THIS SUCKS! WHERE'S THE
THUNDER LEGION HIDING?

138
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,583
- IT'S GRAY!
- 'SUP, GRAY?

139
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,625
- THOSE ARE
BIXLOW'S SIDEKICKS!

140
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,125
- YO!

141
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,541
WHAT D'YA SAY
WE HAVE SOME FUN, HUH?

142
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,500
- Elfman: EVERGREEN!

143
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,208
A REAL MAN WOULD NEVER NEED
TO TAKE HOSTAGES!

144
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:32,375
IF YOU HAVE ANY PRIDE,
YOU'LL TURN MY SISTER BACK!

145
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:36,208
WELL, I'M NOT A MAN,
YOU KNOW.

146
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,458
OH, ARE THOSE BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS
FOR ME?

147
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,166
HOW KIND OF YOU.

148
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,416
THEY SUIT ME SO WELL.

149
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,708
- ( townspeople reacting )

150
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:51,750
- IT'S A SHAME THE ONLY THING
THAT'S CUTE ABOUT YOU

151
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,208
IS YOUR NAME, ELFMAN.

152
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,208
- YOU'D BETTER
TURN MY SISTER BACK OR ELSE.

153
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:03,208
- DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN
DEFEAT ME WHILE BLINDFOLDED?

154
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,250
- AHH!

155
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,250
THERE YOU ARE!

156
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,875
- HOW RESOURCEFUL.

157
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:16,250
SO YOU CAN TELL WHERE I AM
BY FOLLOWING MY SCENT!

158
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,208
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S TOO LATE.

159
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:21,250
YOU'RE ALREADY COVERED
IN MY FAIRY DUST!

160
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,625
FAIRY BOMB ATTACK!

161
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,500
GREMLIN!

162
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,083
- AHHH!

163
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,375
- STATUES ARE WONDERFUL,
AREN'T THEY?

164
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,791
NO MATTER HOW UGLY A BEAST
MAY BE,

165
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,541
ONCE HE IS CAPTURED IN STONE,

166
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,500
HE BECOMES A BEAUTIFUL WORK
OF ART.

167
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:43,875
NOW GAZE INTO MY EYES

168
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,750
AND SUBMIT TO THE ETERNAL BEAUTY
OF STONE.

169
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:54,041
- "EVERGREEN VERSUS ELFMAN.
THE WINNER IS EVERGREEN."

170
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,166
- "ELFMAN K.O.-ED."

171
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,333
- I THOUGHT HE'D HAVE
NO PROBLEM BEATING HER.

172
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:02,708
- AH!  NOW IT SAYS THAT GRAY'S
FIGHTING AGAINST BIXLOW?

173
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,500
WHY'S HE GOTTA HOG
ALL THE FUN?

174
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,125
- IT ALSO SAYS FRIED
IS FIGHTING AGAINST REEDUS.

175
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,416
THE THUNDER LEGION
IS REALLY MAKING THEIR MOVE.

176
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,333
- THIS IS THE END OF THE LINE.

177
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,416
- Lucy: HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

178
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,000
WE'RE GONNA SETTLE
THIS FIGHT MAN TO MAN!

179
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,250
UH, MAN TO GIRL!

180
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,958
- I THOUGHT YOU HAD BEEN TURNED
TO STONE?

181
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,333
- THE MAGIC WORE OFF
SO I CAME AFTER YOU.

182
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,458
HMM! YOU CAN'T KEEP A
GOOD MAN-- I MEAN, WOMAN--

183
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,875
YOU SHOULD KNOW YOU CAN'T KEEP
A GOOD WOMAN DOWN!

184
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:37,041
THIS MAN-- I MEAN, THIS GIRL IS
A LOT STRONGER THAN YOU THINK!

185
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,916
- AHA HA HA HA HA!
- UH-OH!

186
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,750
AHHH!
- ( Lucy laughing )

187
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,166
- THOUGHT YOU COULD TRICK ME

188
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,916
WITH ONE OF YOUR
CREATIONS, DID YOU?

189
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,416
I KNOW THAT YOUR MAGIC
GIVES YOU THE ABILITY

190
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,416
TO BRING YOUR DRAWINGS
TO LIFE.

191
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
IT'S RATHER UNFORTUNATE
REALLY.

192
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,083
THINGS COULD'VE
GOTTEN INTERESTING

193
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,583
IF I'D BEEN SURPRISED.

194
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,458
- FRIED, STOP.
I'M BEGGING YOU,

195
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,458
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS
TO YOUR FRIENDS.

196
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,500
YOU'RE HURTING THEM.

197
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,875
I KNOW DEEP DOWN YOU'RE NOT THE
KIND OF GUY WHO'D DO THIS.

198
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,458
- NOW ONLY 40 WIZARDS REMAIN.
VICTORY WILL SOON BE OURS.

199
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,166
- OH NO. THEY TOOK OUT REEDUS.

200
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,500
- I KNEW IT! HE NEVER
COULDA BEAT FRIED.

201
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,916
THAT GUY IS GOOD.
- I KNOW HE'S COOL AND ALL,

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,833
BUT YOU'RE CHEERING
FOR THE WRONG SIDE!

203
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,333
NOW WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO GET PORLYUSICA'S HELP!

204
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,125
- WE DON'T NEED IT.

205
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,375
LAXUS IS JUST BLUFFING
ABOUT TURNIN' THE GIRLS TO DUST.

206
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:38,083
- I'M JUST BLUFFING, AM I?
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

207
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:41,083
- WHERE'D YOU COME FROM? 
- IT'S A THOUGHT PROJECTION!

208
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:44,250
- NATSU, WHAT'RE YOU DOING
HOLED UP IN THIS DUMP?

209
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,583
ARE YOU SCARED?
- I'M NOT SCARED, I'M STUCK!

210
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,791
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

211
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,583
- HOW'S IT FEEL, HUH?

212
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,750
YOU THINK OF THE GUILD MEMBERS
AS YOUR CHILDREN, RIGHT?

213
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,875
MUST BE TOUGH WATCHING
YOUR LITTLE KIDDIES

214
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,250
TEAR EACH OTHER APART.

215
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,250
IT'S TOO BAD NATSU AND ERZA
CAN'T JOIN THE GAME

216
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,291
'CAUSE YOU
DON'T HAVE ANYONE LEFT

217
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,541
WHO'S STRONG ENOUGH
TO TAKE ON THE THUNDER LEGION.

218
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:08,791
YOU READY
TO THROW IN THE TOWEL?

219
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,500
- NO, IT'S NOT OVER YET.

220
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,625
DON'T FORGET THAT GRAY'S
STILL IN THE GAME!

221
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:15,000
AND HE'S JUST AS STRONG
OF A WIZARD AS NATSU!

222
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,958
- HE'S AS STRONG AS ME?
NO WAY, MAN!

223
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,708
- SORRY, BUT YOU'RE IN DENIAL!
- GRAY, HUH?

224
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:25,125
YOU'RE GONNA PUT
ALL OF YOUR HOPES ON THAT LOSER?

225
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:28,208
- I WOULDN'T UNDERESTIMATE
THE BOY'S POWER IF I WERE YOU!

226
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,375
- LINE FORMATION, BABIES!

227
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,791
- All: AW, YEAH!

228
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,875
- AW, YEAH.
YOU'RE NOT TOO SHABBY.

229
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,166
NOW GIMME A VICTORY FORMATION,
BABIES!

230
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,416
HEY!
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

231
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,541
CRAP!
THEY'RE FROZEN SOLID!

232
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,583
- ICE MAKE HAMMER!

233
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,625
- X-FORMATION, BABIES!

234
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,541
- WHAT THE--

235
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,125
- I GUESS YOU'VE NEVER HEARD
ABOUT MY SEIDHR MAGIC, HUH?

236
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,375
I CONTROL MY BABIES' SOULS.

237
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,666
FREEZE 'EM AND I'LL JUST MOVE
THEIR SOULS TO ANOTHER DOLL.

238
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,041
I GOT AN IMMORTAL ARMY
ON MY SIDE!

239
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,625
- All ( echoing ): ON HIS SIDE.

240
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:25,041
- MAN, THIS IS GONNA BE
A REAL PAIN, ISN'T IT?

241
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,625
- DO YOU GET IT NOW?

242
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,500
YOU CAN ATTACK MY BABIES
ALL DAY

243
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,000
AND IT WON'T DO YOU
A LICK OF GOOD!

244
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,666
- WELL, SINCE IT WON'T WORK
ON THEM,

245
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,750
I'LL JUST FREEZE YOU INSTEAD.

246
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:46,125
- GO AHEAD AND TRY,
IF YOU CAN CATCH ME!

247
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,041
- DON'T RUN AWAY!
COME BACK HERE!

248
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:51,708
- ( laughing )
- FIGHT ME LIKE A MAN!

249
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,708
CRAZY FREAK.

250
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,583
WHERE'D HE RUN OFF TO NOW?

251
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,166
- GETTING WARMER.
PEEK-A-BOO.

252
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,125
- REAL FUNNY. WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO PULL HERE, ANYWAY?

253
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,958
- I JUST WANNA FIGHT SOMEONE
ON MY LEVEL.

254
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,625
A SHAME
YOU DON'T MAKE THE CUT.

255
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,333
MY BABIES ARE GETTIN' BORED.

256
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,833
IT'S TIME TO SPICE THINGS UP
A BIT.

257
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:15,958
- ANOTHER ENCHANTMENT?

258
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,750
- GUESS YOU'RE OUTTA LUCK.

259
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,291
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO USE MAGIC

260
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,250
AS LONG AS YOU'RE INSIDE
THAT BARRIER.

261
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,458
- ONE OF FRIED'S TRAPS, HUH?

262
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:24,916
- SUCKS TO BE YOU.

263
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,750
YOU'RE STUCK IN THERE
ALL BY YOURSELF,

264
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,750
BUT IT'S A PARTY OUT HERE.
BABIES!

265
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,250
- All: TIME TO PARTY?

266
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,625
- AHA HA HA HA!

267
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,416
I DON'T THINK I'D BOTHER
GETTING UP AGAIN IF I WERE YOU.

268
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,291
YOU CAN'T WIN
WITHOUT YOUR MAGIC.

269
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,250
- OH, YA THINK SO?

270
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,333
YOU WANT SOME?

271
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,750
AHHH!

272
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,875
- AHA HA HA HA!  DON'T TELL ME
THAT'S ALL YA GOT?

273
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,416
- AHH!

274
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,583
- Mother:
C'MON, SWEETIE, LET'S GO.

275
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,250
IT'S TIME TO EAT LUNCH. 
- BUT--

276
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,750
- LISTEN, YA JERK!

277
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,625
WHEN MY BABIES
HIT YA LIKE THAT,

278
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,750
YOU'RE S'POSED TO STAY DOWN!

279
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,916
I'M GLAD
I WORE MY HELMET TODAY.

280
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,916
THAT PUNCH
COULD'VE CAUSED MAJOR DAMAGE

281
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,583
TO MY HANDSOME FACE,
AND NOBODY WANTS THAT.

282
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,958
'COURSE WE'RE JUST LUCKY IF GRAY
HERE DECIDES TO WEAR ANYTHING.

283
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:36,958
( chuckling )

284
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,541
- Laxus: "ONE MORE DOWN,
ONLY 28 CONTENDERS REMAIN."

285
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,791
- ( laughs )

286
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,666
AND THAT CHUMP
WAS GONNA SAVE YA?

287
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,708
- YOU CHEATER!
I KNOW YOU AND YOUR PALS

288
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,791
USED SOME DIRTY TRICK
TO BEAT HIM!

289
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:59,166
- ALL RIGHT, WHO'S GONNA BEAT
THE THUNDER LEGION NOW, OLD MAN?

290
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,833
- GAJEEL WILL!
- I DON'T THINK SO.

291
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,541
HE'S MADE IT CLEAR
THAT HE DOESN'T WANNA PLAY.

292
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,500
WHICH DOESN'T SURPRISE ME.

293
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,541
THAT GUY COULDN'T CARE LESS
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE GUILD.

294
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,625
- WHAT?
AM I INVISIBLE?

295
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,791
- YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE IF YOU
CAN'T GET PAST THE BARRIER.

296
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:17,166
- ENOUGH.
IT ISN'T WORTH IT.

297
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,791
I SURRENDER, ALL RIGHT?

298
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,583
- WAIT A SEC!
- YOU'VE HAD YOUR FUN.

299
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,875
NOW STOP THIS.

300
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,958
- WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?

301
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:30,333
I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE MASTER OF
THE ALMIGHTY FAIRY TAIL GUILD?

302
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,916
YOU CAN'T JUST GIVE UP
AT THE DROP OF A HAT.

303
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,291
BUT IF YOU INSIST ON QUITTING,
THEN BY ALL MEANS,

304
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:39,541
HAND THE GUILD OVER TO ME
AND TAKE AN EARLY RETIREMENT.

305
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,541
- WHY YOU GOTTA PLAY DIRTY?

306
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,291
WHY DON'TCHA COME HERE
AND FACE US?  HUH?

307
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,958
- I SHOULD'VE KNOWN.

308
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,958
THIS WAS YOUR GOAL ALL ALONG,
WASN'T IT?

309
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,916
- YOU'VE ONLY GOT AN HOUR
AND A HALF

310
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,500
UNTIL THE STATUES CRUMBLE.

311
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,541
IF YOU REALLY WANNA PUT AN END
TO THIS,

312
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,083
THEN ANNOUNCE YOUR RETIREMENT
TO THE WHOLE TOWN

313
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,000
OVER THE GUILD'S LOUDSPEAKER.

314
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,916
I WANT YOU TO TELL EVERYONE

315
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,791
YOU'RE RELINQUISHING FAIRY TAIL
OVER TO ME!

316
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,458
- WHAT MEANS MORE TO YOU?

317
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:09,625
YOUR CHILDREN OR YOUR TITLE?
CHOOSE CAREFULLY.

318
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,250
- YOU'RE ASKIN' FOR IT!

319
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,500
AHHH!

320
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,083
- IF HE WANTS TO BE MASTER,
HE SHOULD HAVE THE GUTS

321
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,500
TO FACE ME IN PERSON!

322
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,083
HOW COME HE WON'T FIGHT ME?

323
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,583
- IT WAS NEVER
THE TITLE I VALUED.

324
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,416
- THEN YOU'RE
JUST GONNA GIVE UP?

325
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,875
- NO, HE MAY BE STRONG,
BUT HE'S NOT TRUSTWORTHY.

326
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,916
I'D NEVER LEAVE HIM
IN CHARGE.

327
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,208
IT TAKES MORE THAN JUST
MAGICAL STRENGTH TO RUN A GUILD.

328
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,875
HE HAS NEITHER THE CONVICTION
NOR THE HEART.

329
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,625
- Happy: WE GOTTA HURRY
AND DO SOMETHING

330
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,125
BEFORE HE TURNS THE GIRLS
INTO DUST!

331
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,416
THERE MUST BE SOMEONE
WHO CAN BEAT LAXUS AND HIS PALS.

332
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,208
- NO WAY! YOU WERE HERE
THIS WHOLE TIME?

333
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,708
- HE'S EATING THE DISHES TOO!
- GAJEEL!

334
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,125
WILL YOU FIGHT FOR THE GUILD?
- MIGHT AS WELL.

335
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:55,916
I GOT A SCORE TO SETTLE
WITH THAT GUY.

336
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,666
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL HANDLE HIM.

337
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,125
- AH!
- AHHHH!

338
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,958
- DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE OVER 80 TOO?

339
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,875
- DO I LOOK 80 TO YOU?

340
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:11,041
- LET'S SEE HOW THE
GUILD'S DOING.

341
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,500
- GREMLIN!

342
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,125
- AHH!

343
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:21,708
- MY, WHAT A SHAME.

344
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,333
- STOP IT, BIXLOW!
WE'RE ALL FRIENDS HERE, RIGHT?

345
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:27,541
- FRIENDS?  YOU WEAKLINGS
AIN'T NO FRIENDS OF MINE!

346
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,916
RIGHT, BABIES?
AHA HA HA!

347
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,000
- FRIED.

348
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:39,000
- HELLO, ALZACK.

349
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,958
- THANKS TO THOSE ENCHANTMENTS
OF YOURS,

350
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,583
I'VE HAD TO FIGHT
AGAINST ALL MY FRIENDS.

351
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,000
I TOLD MYSELF
I HAD TO FOR BISCA,

352
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,916
BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT OKAY.

353
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:58,000
GUNS MAGIC TORNADO SHOT!

354
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,708
HE SLICED
THROUGH MY WIND MAGIC?

355
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,750
( grunts )

356
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,166
WHAT'S GOING ON?
CAN'T BREATHE.

357
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,291
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

358
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,958
WHAT KINDA WEIRD MAGIC
IS THIS? BISCA.

359
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:23,208
- THOSE WHO USE MAGIC
WITHIN THIS BARRIER

360
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,125
WILL BE ROBBED OF OXYGEN.

361
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,208
OF COURSE, IF YOU HAD BOTHERED
TO READ THE ENCHANTMENT

362
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:31,083
YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT.

363
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:34,375
- HOW DO THEY EXPECT
TO DEFEAT ME

364
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,625
WHEN I'M THE ONE WHO WRITES
THE RULES?

365
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:41,791
NOW ONLY TWO REMAIN
IN THE BATTLE OF FAIRY TAIL.

366
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,541
SUCH A PITIFUL DISPLAY.

367
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,708
- ONLY TWO LEFT IN THE GUILD?

368
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,708
- ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT
FAKIN' BEING STUCK IN HERE?

369
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,083
YOU TRYIN' TO COPY ME?
- IN YOUR DREAMS!

370
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,000
- NOW I'M HUNGRY
AND IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT, JERK!

371
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,125
- QUIT BLAMIN' EVERYTHING
ON ME!

372
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,416
- IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIGHT,

373
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,958
THEN AT LEAST GO
GET ME SOME FOOD!

374
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,750
- NO WAY.
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONES LEFT?

375
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:03,000
- BUT WHAT ABOUT ME, MASTER?
I'M A MEMBER TOO, AREN'T I?

376
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:06,125
- THERE'S NOBODY LEFT
WHO COULD TAKE DOWN LAXUS.

377
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,041
IT'S ALL OVER.

378
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,500
- I'VE GOT NO CHOICE.
GUESS I'LL BRING ERZA BACK.

379
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,625
- DO WHAT?
- AW, THIS SUCKS.

380
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:15,666
I THOUGHT I WAS FINALLY GONNA
HAVE A CHANCE TO SHOW HER UP.

381
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,333
- NOW HOLD ON A SECOND!
WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT TO DO?

382
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:21,166
- I'M GONNA USE MY FIRE ON HER.

383
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,833
YA KNOW,
TO MELT THE STONE OFF.

384
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,583
- SAY WHAT?

385
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,375
- SHE'S NOT COVERED IN STONE,
SHE IS STONE,

386
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,916
SO IT'S NOT GONNA MELT
OFF OF HER!

387
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,958
- WON'T KNOW 'TIL WE TRY,
RIGHT GUYS?

388
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,291
- THIS IS MADNESS!

389
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,708
YOU'RE GOING
TO ROAST HER ALIVE!

390
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,833
- HA HA!
IT'S TOASTY TIME!

391
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,125
- PLEASE BE CAREFUL!
- NO JOKE.

392
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,083
WATCH WHERE YOU PUT
THOSE FIRE HANDS, BRO.

393
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,833
- ( all screaming )

394
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,416
- I DIDN'T MEAN TO BREAK HER,
SOMEONE GET ME THE GLUE!

395
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,375
QUICK!  HAPPY!  GLUE!
- DO WE HAVE GLUE?

396
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:49,000
- THAT'S NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING,
YOU IDIOT!

397
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:52,166
WE GOTTA USE YOUR FIRE AND MY
IRON TO WELD HER BACK TOGETHER!

398
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,791
- ERZA, NO!

399
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,875
- I'M SORRY!
I'M SORRY!

400
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,833
I'M SORRY!  I'M SORRY!
I SO SORRY!  I'M SORRY!

401
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,250
- I FEEL HOT.

402
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,666
IT WAS YOU, WASN'T IT?

403
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,375
WERE YOU TRYING TO COOK ME?

404
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,041
- ERZA'S BACK IN BUSINESS,
GUYS!

405
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,166
- THANK GOODNESS.

406
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,916
BUT HOW
WAS THE SPELL BROKEN?

407
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,541
- HONESTLY, I'M NOT QUITE SURE.
BUT IF I HAD TO GUESS,

408
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,208
I'D SAY IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH MY RIGHT EYE.

409
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,916
- THAT'S IT!

410
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,250
HER ARTIFICIAL EYE MUST'VE
WEAKENED THE EFFECTS

411
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,541
OF THE SPELL.

412
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,708
- ERZA, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW?

413
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,833
- I THINK SO.
EVEN THOUGH I WAS STONE,

414
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,416
I WAS STILL ABLE TO HEAR
MOST OF WHAT WAS SAID.

415
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,083
- ALL RIGHT.
IT'S TIME TO STRIKE BACK.

416
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,833
- Happy:
LOOK, THERE'S THREE NOW!

417
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,958
- THE RUNES HAVE
ALREADY ADDED ME TO THE FRAY.

418
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,416
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
IT UPDATES AUTOMATICALLY.

419
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,666
BUT THERE'S ONLY THREE LEFT.
- ACTUALLY, IT'S JUST YOU.

420
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,458
NATSU AND GAJEEL ARE STUCK HERE
'CAUSE OF THE ENCHANTMENT.

421
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:56,458
WAIT, NOW IT SAYS THERE'S FOUR.

422
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,166
- IT WENT UP.
- WHO COULD IT BE?

423
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,791
- Makarov: THE GIRLS
ARE STILL STONE,

424
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,291
SO IT CAN'T BE ANY OF THEM.

425
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:06,208
- ( giggles ) AREN'T YOU GUYS
FORGETTING ABOUT SOMEONE?

426
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,291
A MEMBER WHO'S FREQUENTLY
OUT OF TOWN?

427
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,583
- HOLD ON.
YOU DON'T MEAN HIM?

428
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:14,625
- AND HE'S BACK
JUST WHEN WE NEED HIM THE MOST!

429
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,750
- HE'S ALWAYS BEEN ONE
TO MAKE A GRAND ENTRANCE.

430
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,250
IT LOOKS LIKE THE REAL BATTLE
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.

431
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,291
- SOMEONE WANNA FILL ME
IN OVER HERE?

432
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:24,416
- Erza: WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A
MAN WHO MAY VERY WELL BE

433
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,458
THE STRONGEST WIZARD
IN FAIRY TAIL.

434
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,625
MYSTOGAN.

435
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:36,208
- SO ERZA HAS RECOVERED AND NOW
MYSTOGAN IS JOINING US.

436
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,916
INCLUDING ME, THAT'S THREE OF
FAIRY TAIL'S ELITE

437
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,416
COMING HEAD-TO-HEAD.

438
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,666
- YOU CAN'T HAVE A PROPER
FESTIVAL WITHOUT A MAIN EVENT.

439
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,250
- THEN.
- THANKS FOR HELPIN' REEDUS!

440
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,041
- THAT WASN'T REALLY ME.

441
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,166
- HEY THERE, ERZA.

442
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,708
THAT'S A PRETTY CRAZY
GETUP YOU GOT ON.

443
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,208
- WE SAW A BUNCH OF GUYS FROM
YOUR GUILD FIGHTING EARLIER.

444
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,625
YOU THINK YOU COULD ASK THEM 
TO STOP WRECKING THE TOWN?

445
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,333
- PLEASE FORGIVE THEM.

446
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,416
THEY'RE JUST PREPARING
FOR THE BIG PARADE.

447
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,750
- I DON'T SEE WHAT THAT
HAS TO DO WITH FIGHTING.

448
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,000
- I PROMISE
IT'LL BE A GOOD SHOW.

449
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,416
- I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT
THEN.

450
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,291
- TRY TO CLEAN UP
AFTER YOURSELVES, OKAY?

451
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,250
- MY MY, NOW THAT'S ODD.

452
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,750
I SEEM TO RECALL
TURNING YOU INTO A STATUE.

453
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,458
WELL, NO MATTER.

454
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:26,625
THIS GIVES ME AN EXCUSE
TO TORMENT YOU FURTHER.

455
