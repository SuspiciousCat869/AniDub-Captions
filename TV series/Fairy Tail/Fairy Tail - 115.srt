a bite of something

166
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,625
would really help me out.

167
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,625
Cana's heavier than she looks.

168
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:30,875
[WENDY] Wow, you'd
better be glad she can't

169
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,458
hear you right now.

170
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,583
Because that's kinda rude.

171
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:35,291
[HAPPY]
See.

172
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,125
I'm not the only one.

173
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,000
[CARLA]
No, this is horrible!

174
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,416
I decided to fly up in
order to get an aerial view

175
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,625
of the island.

176
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:46,083
The great tree growing
in the middle of it.

177
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,083
Has been snapped in half!

178
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:51,041
[ALL]
What??

179
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,875
It makes more
sense to me now.

180
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,125
That tree falling must have
something to do with why we all

181
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,125
lost our magic power earlier.

182
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,791
[FRIED] It is commonly known
as the Great Tenrou Tree.

183
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,458
The legends say it blesses
our guild members.

184
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,750
[BIXLOW] Well, the rumor
I've always heard about it.

185
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,208
Is that if you have the Fairy
Tail emblem on your body,

186
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,583
the tree actually
keeps you from dying.

187
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,916
[LEVY]
Really?

188
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,041
That means all our wounded
members will survive.

189
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,291
Yeah, but.

190
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,833
If the Tenrou tree got
knocked over somehow.

191
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,500
Why did we get our
magic power back?

192
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,208
[FRIED] There are many
unanswered questions

193
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,458
at the moment.

194
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,583
[PANTHERLILY] We need to
stay alert and make sure

195
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,458
we completely recover.

196
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,625
[GRAY]
Okay, I'll do it.

197
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,708
You will?

198
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,875
[GRAY]
That's right.

199
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,791
I'll beat Hades.

200
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,458
You know
that Iced Shell is fatal

201
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,541
to whoever casts it.

202
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,541
I'm well aware of that.

203
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,291
I know exactly what
I'll be getting myself into

204
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,333
by doing this.

205
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,541
Thank you.

206
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,541
[GRAY]
Don't.

207
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:10,666
'Cause I ain't doin' this for
you or for your mother either.

208
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,583
It's for Fairy Tail.

209
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,083
Whoa.

210
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,541
It's a whole lot worse
than I thought it'd be.

211
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,333
Yeah this is awful.

212
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,083
[LUCY] Even Gajeel
and Mira went down.

213
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:48,333
Don't worry guys, I'll
use my Sky Magic heal them.

214
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,333
[LISANNA]
Hey, Natsu.

215
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,041
Oh, I'm glad
you're okay Lisanna.

216
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,583
Me too, I was
so worried about you.

217
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,958
I appreciate what
you're trying to do, Wendy.

218
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,000
But I'm not sure
you can right now.

219
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:01,333
Your magic power has
been seriously overtaxed today.

220
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,250
You need to rest
for a little while.

221
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,500
You know
Carla's right, Wendy.

222
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,291
What happened here?

223
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,333
Tell me.

224
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:12,166
That man over there
attacked us.

225
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,875
And then all of a sudden
we lost our magic power.

226
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,208
Like we were all drained
at the same time.

227
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,666
It was strange.

228
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,416
Fried and Bixlow fought
as hard as they could.

229
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,791
But with everyone
injured, we were already at

230
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,125
such a major disadvantage.

231
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,875
This is bad.

232
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,875
I don't know what
we're gonna do.

233
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,416
Aw, please
don't cry Lisanna.

234
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,875
We are gonna figure
this out, I promise you.

235
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,666
You're right.

236
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,666
I know, I'm sorry, you guys.

237
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,583
[NATSU]
They're gonna pay.

238
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:48,291
I'll make damn sure of that.

239
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:49,458
Natsu.

240
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,125
We have to try at least.

241
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,375
And now we can
count Master and Cana among

242
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,583
the injured.

243
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,750
How'd they get
the upper hand like this?

244
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,375
Grimoire Heart's
ship is stationed right off

245
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,416
the shoreline,
just east of here.

246
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,208
I propose this strategy.

247
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:05,291
That we split our group
into two separate teams.

248
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,958
One team will be offense.

249
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,791
and one defense.

250
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:27,291
[ULTEAR]
Meldy!

251
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,750
[MELDY]
Oh.

252
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,250
Did you find him?

253
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,916
That man with you.

254
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,833
Is that Zeref?

255
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,916
It is indeed.

256
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,541
It's Lord Zeref.

257
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,708
There's been
a change of plan.

258
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,125
We're leaving the island.

259
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,041
Are you sure that
we should leave so soon?

260
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,416
I still haven't been able
to locate Gray Fullbuster.

261
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,333
[ULTEAR] He is no longer of
your concern now, Meldy.

262
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,458
He's not our enemy.

263
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,500
[GRAY]
I don't get it.

264
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,166
What the hell does Zeref
have to do with Ur's will?

265
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,791
[ULTEAR]
Just hear me out, Gray.

266
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,666
When I was
a little girl my father

267
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,458
was killed by Hades.

268
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,625
My mother kept tabs on
Grimoire Heart, biding her time

269
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:15,458
until the day came when
she could avenge his death.

270
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,041
After she died.

271
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:23,541
I found her journal and That's
when I discovered the truth.

272
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,041
That day,

273
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:28,041
I made a decision that I would
infiltrate Grimoire Heart.

274
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,500
However.

275
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,125
Hades was more powerful
than I'd ever imagined.

276
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,583
My mother perfected the
Iced Shell, because that was

277
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,583
the only way to take him down.

278
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,375
That's why
she learned it?

279
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,875
But Even though her
blood runs through my veins.

280
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,458
I was never able
to master it myself.

281
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,541
As far as I can tell.

282
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:56,041
that is only spell capable
of defeating Hades.

283
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,833
And I have failed at it.

284
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,375
You needn't trouble
yourself with Zeref.

285
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,708
I will seal him
away, off the island.

286
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,708
Somewhere, that he will
never be found again.

287
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,583
I will keep him
out of Hades' reach.

288
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,791
Please Gray.

289
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:23,166
My mother and I both dreamed
this would one day come to pass.

290
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,250
Please make it happen for us.

291
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,416
He's not our
enemy in the slightest.

292
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,750
He's our pawn.

293
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,083
I just can't believe
that he actually fell for that

294
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,500
ridiculous story I told him.

295
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,958
What a fool.

296
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,916
If this goes as
planned, I'll get rid of both

297
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,208
Hades and Gray
in one fell swoop.

298
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,375
It almost couldn't have
come together more perfectly!

299
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,041
Get rid of Master Hades?

300
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,833
But why?

301
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,125
[ULTEAR]
With him gone.

302
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:04,791
We can keep Lord Zeref
entirely to ourselves!

303
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:08,166
[MELDY] You'd really betray
our master like this?

304
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,750
[ULTEAR] Hades, Gray,
and anyone else I please.

305
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,500
I will have all of them right
in the palm of my hand.

306
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,000
I will crush anyone who
wants to get near Zeref.

307
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,625
He's entirely
in my possession.

308
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,083
Oh, silly me.

309
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,666
I'm getting carried away.

310
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,750
I'm almost certain
that Gray isn't anywhere near

311
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,916
up to the task at hand.

312
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,166
But at least
he can distract Hades'

313
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,916
ever-watchful eye while
we leave with Zeref.

314
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,333
Let's depart before
his eye falls back to us.

315
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:44,958
Who might this be?

316
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,791
That's Juvia.

317
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,583
Gray's close friend.

318
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,000
What are you doing?

319
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,416
Preparing
to kill her, obviously.

320
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,041
[MELDY]
But she's not a threat!

321
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,958
She's unconscious!

322
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,416
[ULTEAR]
Be quiet.

323
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,666
This will limit Gray's
options for the future.

324
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,666
He can be killed by Hades.

325
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,875
Or die performing
the Iced Shell.

326
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,250
Seeing his dear friend lying
dead on the ground like this

327
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,583
will only drive him
towards the inevitable.

328
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,750
He found us!

329
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,958
[GRAY] I knew somethin'
was rotten with you.

330
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:48,916
Well well.

331
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,291
Did you?

332
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,583
And when did you
finally catch on?

333
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,041
From the second
you opened your mouth,

334
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,416
I knew everything that came
out of it would be crap.

335
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,958
Is that so?

336
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,666
You were just playing
along the whole time,

337
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,833
trying to figure out what
my true motives were?

338
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:03,833
Bad boy.

339
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,416
I made a promise.

340
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,875
I swore that I would never try
to use Iced Shell ever again.

341
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,291
[NATSU] If I didn't let you do
it before why would I let you

342
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,000
do it now?

343
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:17,375
I'm not gonna let you
go out like that.

344
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,666
[GRAY] I don't care if
this is Ur's will or not.

345
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,333
Because I've got
a will all of my own.

346
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:28,541
And it says my friends and I are
gonna walk the path of life!

347
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,541
[MELDY]
Life?

348

[ULTEAR]
My my.

349
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:37,250
I guess you're not so loyal
to your master after all.

350
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,500
I thought I could
count on you to eliminate Hades

351
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,041
for her sake.

352
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,791
It's such a shame.

353
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,416
Here I was, hoping that
I wouldn't have to

354
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,125
fight you myself.

355
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:50,750
I'm surprised.

356
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,500
That witch loved you even
more than her own daughter.

357
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,916
I'm afraid I might
enjoy killing you so much

358
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,250
my heart will explode with joy!

359
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,958
You need to show some
respect for your mother.

360
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,166
And since she's not around,

361
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,250
I'll have to teach you
that lesson for her!

362
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,833
You're such a fool.

363
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:13,208
You've made an extremely grave
mistake in threatening me

364
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,583
like that.

365
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:20,041
For I am the leader
of the Seven Kin of Purgatory!

It looks like we took down
