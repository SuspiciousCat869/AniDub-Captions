1
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:22,208
[STING] Sounds like
they're finally back.

2
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:23,750
[ROGUE] Who's "they"?

3
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,500
The Fairy Tail
members who went missing

4
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,958
on Tenrow Island
seven years ago.

5
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,750
I couldn't care less.

6
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:31,791
Don't try to play
it cool with me.

7
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:34,500
You used to look up
to Natsu like crazy.

8
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:36,750
You're right.

9
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:39,166
I used to.

10
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,541
[church bells chiming]

11
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,916
[ARCHBISHOP] May all our recent
transgressions be forgiven.

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,541
We, the humble
followers of Zentopia,

13
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:23,625
hereby repent for every
sin we've committed.

14
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,750
And now, to cleanse
us of those sins,

15
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:29,833
we set forth on a new
path of righteousness.

16
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,208
Somebody shoot me.

17
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,916
Just hang in
there, buddy.

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,041
We're stuck

19
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,708
'cause the Big-Hat
himself invited us.

20
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:38,083
[MACAO] He invited
the whole guild!

21
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,583
Where's everybody else?

22
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:40,750
[WAKABA] Let 'em
rest and leave

23
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:45,125
the formal stuff
to us old-timers.

24
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,666
[BYRO] As leader
of the Legion Platoon,

25
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,291
I offer my deepest
and sincerest apologies

26
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,458
to the members
of Fairy Tail.

27
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,083
[MAKAROV] There's no room
for remorse, just progress.

28
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,750
Let's move
beyond this crisis.

29
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,458
[MAKAROV] We may
have fought before,

30
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,416
but that doesn't mean
we have to be enemies now.

31
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,125
What do you say
we start anew?

32
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:07,708
[BYRO] You're as gracious
as you are wise.

33
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,625
[MAKAROV] Now that
that's settled.

34
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,958
Let's party!

35
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,000
[cheering]

36
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,375
[HAPPY] Sabertooth!

37
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:21,833
[NARRATOR] The battle
over the Infinity Clock

38
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,166
has come to an end.

39
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,833
And the fugitive members
of the Neo-Oración Seis

40
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,625
have been returned
to the confines

41
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,083
of their prison
cells once again.

42
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,416
[NARRATOR] As for
Fairy Tail...

43
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,458
[FEMALE 124A]
So, like...

44
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,333
All that crazy
clock voodoo

45
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:35,583
was totally
caused by

46
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,333
that super weak guild
from here in Magnolia.

47
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,291
[FEMALE 124B]
For real?

48
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,583
Like, who gave
them the right

49
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:40,833
to be so annoying?

50
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:41,916
[FEMALE 124A] Y'know,
I can't even remember

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,750
the name of their
lame little guild.

52
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:44,916
[FEMALE 124B]
Ugh, It's Fairy Tail

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,666
and they are, like,
so yesterday's news.

54
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,708
[NARRATOR] Unfortunately, the
guild's recent accomplishments

55
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,333
have done little
to improve their reputation.

56
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,166
In fact, their popularity
seems to have plummeted.

57
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,625
[LAHAR]
Understood. Carry on.

58
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,333
I've got news on
Neville's wizards.

59
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,625
Apparently
they've been freed

60
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,625
from the century-long
sleeping curse.

61
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,125
[LAHAR] However, they seem 

62
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,083
to have lost all
their magic power.

63
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,208
They're no longer
celestial wizards.

64
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:10,041
It's just like what
happened to Katja.

65
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,458
[DORANBOLT]
Hey, uh...

66
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:12,708
This report
you gave me...

67
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,541
I knew that it
would pique your interest.

68
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:15,958
They've returned alive

69
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,208
and well, as if
nothing happened.

70
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,041
They even had
the same clothes on.

71
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,041
Well.

72
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,666
As you can imagine,
the chairman

73
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,041
wasn't too happy about it.

74
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,000
You knew.

75
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,958
Why didn't
you tell me?

76
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,958
I could have,
but why spoil the chance

77
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,208
to see that
look on your face?

78
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,250
That so?

79
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,666
I see.

80
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:37,791
She's alive.

81
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,416
Thank goodness.

82
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:40,791
[HAPPY] Okay!

83
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,375
Let's start this off right!

84
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,875
It's Natsu versus Dan

85
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,625
in a Winner-Eats-All
food race-a-thon!

86
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,083
Time to get
in my belly, meat!

87
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,541
I'm winning
this one for sure!

88
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:49,791
Oh my.

89
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,416
It looks like
everything is back to normal.

90
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,958
That Infinity
Clock mess

91
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,916
almost feels like a
distant memory to me now.

92
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,333
[DAN] Poke!

93
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,666
[NATSU] What the?

94
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,250
Good luck catchin' up
with me, Fire-breath!

95
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,541
[ROMEO] Is he gonna let
him get away with that?

96
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:03,375
[HAPPY] 
I don't think

97
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,416
that's against
the rules.

98
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,333
I would hate
to be Wakaba right now.

99
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,750
I bet he and Master Macao 

100
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,166
are gettin' an earful
from the church.

101
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,458
Being master
means getting

102
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,041
the short end of
the stick from time to time.

103
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,500
[GRAY] Hey, the ceremony
they're attending

104
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,583
is supposed to be
a big deal, right?

105
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:16,666
If that's the case,

106
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,083
why's the Legion Platoon
here with us?

107
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,875
[SUGARBOY] We're in the
same boat as you, Ice Boy!

108
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,083
[SUGARBOY] Playin' hooky!

109
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,625
We need a break too!

110
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:27,125
And I'd rather be
here cuddlin' with you!

111
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,208
[WARREN] Shut up,
maybe he'll go away.

112
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,875
[JUVIA] If anyone is cuddling 

113
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,250
with my beloved Gray,
it's gonna be me!

114
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,416
[SUGARBOY] Woah,
there's no need

115
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,791
for you to go and
get spicy, Water Girl!

116
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:37,833
I'm sure you both have
more than cuddling in mind.

117
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:42,125
[PANTHERLILY] Coco.

118
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,375
Is there something wrong?

119
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,250
You've been quiet.

120
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,541
[COCO] Well...
It's just...

121
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,166
[COCO] I said some
pretty horrible things

122
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,916
to you and
I regret every one.

123
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,666
Like saying
I hated cats.

124
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,208
I don't.

125
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,125
[PANTHERLILY] It's fine.

126
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,333
You don't need
to apologize.

127
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,458
I'm just glad I got
to see you again.

128
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,875
Even if you're
not the same Coco.

129
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,458
[PANTHERLILY] It's all
water under the bridge.

130
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,458
[COCO] I appreciate
you saying that.

131
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,416
[PANTHERLILY] So, how
long before you all

132
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,000
go back to Zentopia?

133
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,500
[COCO] I hate
to tell you this.

134
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,541
[SAMUEL] Aha!

135
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:11,791
There you are.

136
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,500
I was promised a rematch.

137
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,416
I believe your exact words
were "anytime, anywhere."

138
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,500
[PANTHERLILY ]
Very well then.

139
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:20,166
Ready?

140
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,166
[COCO] You're gonna
fight right now?

141
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,541
[ERZA] Something
wrong, Master?

142
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,708
[MAKAROV] No, no.

143
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:28,916
Not at all.

144
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,458
Just finally peaceful.

145
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,833
[LEVY] Where's your drink?

146
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,916
Do you not feel like
celebrating with us?

147
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,416
[BISCA] I'm not
goin' near the bar

148
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,708
as long as the
"brothers gloom"

149
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,125
are sulkin' in their cups.

150
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,791
[CANA] Gotcha covered.

151
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,166
No booze goes
wasted while I'm around.

152
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,458
[COCO] How crazy.

153
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,958
They're going at
each other full force,

154
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,750
yet they're smiling!

155
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,833
[GILDARTS] That fight
was somethin' else.

156
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,791
And I'm still feelin' it.

157
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,250
[BYRO] To think
someone like you exists.

158
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:17,500
The world is full of more
surprises than I'd thought.

159
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,541
[GILDARTS] A fight's organic,
you can't predict it.

160
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:22,750
Strength and training
are just a part of it.

161
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:23,916
[GILDARTS] All it
would have taken

162
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,416
was one wrong move
at the wrong time

163
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,041
and I would have been
the one eating the floor.

164
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,125
[BYRO] You certainly
have a broad outlook.

165
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,791
[GILDARTS] I just live life
by a different set of rules.

166
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,541
[LEVY] What do you think
they're mumbling about?

167
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:36,958
[CANA] Do I look
like I care?

168
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,875
Probably just dirty,
old-man talk.

169
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:39,875
[DAN] So, uh.

170
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,833
Where did my
Lucy-pie run off to?

171
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,500
I thought Angel was
your main squeeze these days.

172
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,666
Life's too short to
be tied down to one person.

173
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,791
You've gotta have
some variety in love!

174
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah, sure.

175
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,666
Then it's
not true love!

176
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,333
Just vulgar
infatuation!

177
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,583
Uh-oh, she's
in for it now.

178
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,916
[DAN] Erzy-baby,
she's so scary!

179
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,166
Okay.

180
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,125
Please stop.

181
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,500
Who me?

182
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,541
I should have seen that
one comin' from a mile away.

183
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,250
[DAN] The moment our eyes
met I knew it was destiny!

184
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,375
Now, then.

185
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:10,000
How's about we ditch
the armor and go--

186
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:13,666
[DAN] Rain check?

187
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,833
[ERZA] You should search
for honor instead of a girl!

188
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,791
Love can be
painful, man.

189
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:19,666
[HAPPY] Winner!

190
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,833
First round KO by Erza!

191
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:21,958
Apparently that
weapon works to ward away

192
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,541
evil and men
who get too handsy.

193
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,458
Come on,
it's more fun inside.

194
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:30,375
I know.

195
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,791
It's just.

196
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,750
I don't get it.

197
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,041
I mean, after
everything I did.

198
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,958
How can you
be so friendly to me?

199
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,625
We were all fighting
for what we believed in.

200
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,333
Besides you were
being manipulated

201
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,708
like the rest
of us, right?

202
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:46,833
It was out
of your control,

203
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,958
so don't beat
yourself up.

204
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,041
[MARY] Listen.

205
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,000
Before I was taken
in by Zentopia.

206
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,500
a day didn't go by
that I wasn't tricked

207
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,666
or used by the
people around me.

208
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,916
But, like, that
totally changed

209
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,791
once I had power.

210
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,833
And since Zentopia
had raised me up

211
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,458
from nobody to a
total badass wizard,

212
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:08,375
I was willing to do
anything for them.

213
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,708
Finally it was
my turn to control people.

214
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,583
As soon as I did I
felt like I was getting

215
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,041
back at the guys
who'd used me.

216
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,125
But it turns out

217
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,625
that I was being
used all over again.

218
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,375
And not just me,
but people I thought

219
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,000
of as my friends and family.

220
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,750
Even you.

221
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,750
You were tricked by Michelle,
who was also being used.

222
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:31,125
[PANTHERLILY] You've improved
a great deal, Samuel.

223
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,458
It's because you've managed
to rid yourself of doubt.

224
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,458
[SAMUEL] And yet.

225
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,541
I'm still no match
for you, am I?

226
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,666
I had hoped
I could defeat you

227
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,541
one final time
but that won't happen.

228
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:46,958
[PANTHERLILY] Final?

229
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,208
[GILDARTS] What
do you got there?

230
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,708
[BYRO] Something
that is far too heavy

231
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,958
for someone
like me to carry.

232
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,750
However...

233
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:54,916
[ARCHBISHOP]
My mind's made up.

234
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,875
The gold seal will
pass to you, Byro.

235
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:58,750
[BYRO] Your Imminence.

236
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,125
I am not worthy.

237
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,541
[ARCHBISHOP] Take it,
my friend.

238
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,375
Although I was
being manipulated.

239
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,333
it was my own
weakness of heart

240
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:09,041
that allowed such a calamity
to befall Zentopia.

241
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,916
I'm afraid
that your next mission

242
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,083
will be a long,
perilous one.

243
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:16,208
So please make use of
the seal on your journey.

244
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,083
Let it bring light
into your hearts

245
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,500
when only darkness
can be found.

246
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,583
[BYRO] You're far too kind,
Your Grace.

247
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:23,916
[GUTMAN] Does
little ol' Gutman

248
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
get a tasky-wasky too,
Mr. Archbishop?

249
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,541
[ARCHBISHOP] Ultimately
it was our fault

250
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,541
that you were placed
in the Forbidden Cell.

251
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,250
But now that you are
free I ask for your help.

252
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,416
As you know,

253
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,250
many of our local
parishes lie in ruin.

254
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,250
Would you be
willing to use

255
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,458
your great powers
to rebuild them?

256
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,916
[GUTMAN] I'll make
'em better than ever!

257
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,166
[ARCHBISHOP]
Before you go,

258
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,916
there's something I've
been meaning to ask you.

259
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,333
Something wrong?

260
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,083
You remember how
Lapointe, like, sent

261
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,833
those puppets out
all over creation?

262
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:54,416
Well, I did some digging
and I found something.

263
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,083
I've got info on
the real Michelle Lobster.

264
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,166
From what I
could gather,

265
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,500
Lapointe kept her close

266
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,875
'cause he was, like,
hoping to get his

267
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,500
hands on her
family's fortune.

268
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,750
[MARY] Oh, and those
documents saying the Lobsters

269
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:09,541
were distant relatives
of the Heartfilias.

270
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,458
They were
fakes right?

271
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,666
It's okay, I can take it.

272
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,666
I'm sorry.

273
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,875
I just can't do
anything right.

274
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,000
I wanted to find some
good news to bring you

275
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,166
as a way of apologizing
for what I'd done.

276
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,000
But I failed.

277
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,625
[LUCY] 
Thank you.

278
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,958
I actually had a
feeling that was the case

279
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,416
and now I know for certain.

280
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,125
I can put it behind me.

281
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,250
For real?

282
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,750
Seriously, I'll be fine!

283
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,375
Sure, I feel a little sad.

284
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:42,125
But I still
have all my friends.

285
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,875
Guess that's true.

286
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,291
Now then.

287
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,166
Since we've shed
some tears together.

288
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,458
C'mon!

289
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,333
Let's start over.

290
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,416
Put her there.

291
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:57,625
We can start as friends
and see where that takes us!

292
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:58,958
I appreciate
the sentiment,

293
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,000
but not sure I'm ready
for what you're implying.

294
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,916
[BYRO] The true purpose of
our visit is not a happy one.

295
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,708
[MAKAROV] Yes, I figured
as much.

296
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:12,958
This is the last
we'll be seeing of you.

297
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,250
You came
to say goodbye?

298
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,083
[BYRO] Yes, I'm afraid
that is the case.

299
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,166
Our duty pulls
us elsewhere.

300
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,708
We've been
charged with locating

301
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,125
the scattered Infinity
Clock pieces.

302
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,416
Once we return them,

303
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,583
they'll be sealed and hidden
away for eternity.

304
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:26,875
Unfortunately,
it will take some time

305
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,416
for the clock pieces

306
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,958
to regain any real
measure of magic power,

307
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:35,083
so it will be impossible
to detect them magically.

308
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,708
[BYRO] The truth is
we will likely spend

309
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,416
the rest of our lives
completing this task.

310
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,708
Farewell my friends.  I--

311
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:43,583
[GRAY] I'm just gonna go ahead
and stop you right there.

312
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,333
[NATSU] Don't worry you guys,

313
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,416
I'm sure you'll, like,
totes see us again.

314
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,541
[ERZA]
Stop talking

315
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:50,541
Coco.

316
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:51,791
Thanks again for
all of your help.

317
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,791
And Mary, I hope you'll
hang out more next time.

318
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,541
[COCO] My pleasure!

319
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,291
Take care of yourselves and
hopefully we'll see you soon!

320
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,916
[MARY] And I will
totes hang out with you.

321
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,250
I promise!

322
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,708
[SAMUEL] My calculations
say I'll win next, bro.

323
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,166
[PANTHERLILY] Challenge
me anytime, Sam.

324
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,333
Good luck.

325
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,666
[HAPPY] Aw, how cute.

326
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,375
[CARLA] They even have
new names for each other.

327
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,541
[GRAY] If we're lucky
we'll run into each other.

328
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,666
Let us know if we
can help out somehow.

329
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,916
[ERZA] Now Dan.

330
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,916
This journey will
test your integrity

331
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,250
so focus on honing
it while you can.

332
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:22,000
[SUGARBOY] Oh you can always
help me out, spicy Icy Boy.

333
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,416
[DAN] I'll see ya
next time, Erzy.

334
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,375
Lookin' forward to it.

335
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,625
[NATSU] Octo-geezer!

336
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:28,541
Hold up!

337
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,125
I got somethin' to ask ya!

338
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,375
[MARY] He's still
calling you that?

339
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,916
[BYRO] What is it, Natsu?

340
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,416
[NATSU] Don't you get tired of
lookin' grumpy all the time?

341
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,333
Try crackin'
a smile now and then!

342
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,125
[MAKAROV] Zip it!

343
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,250
[SUGARBOY] Oh.

344
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,083
[MARY] Well, s'true.

345
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,125
[DAN] Yeah, the ladies love
a man who rocks a smile.

346
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,208
[SAMUEL] It certainly
wouldn't hurt you

347
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,416
to give it a try.

348
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,083
[BYRO] You once suggested
I open my heart to them.

349
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:54,166
Didn't you, Coco?

350
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,375
[BYRO] It took a while
for me to realize it,

351
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,833
but I finally
understand what you

352
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,375
were trying to tell me then.

353
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:08,416
[MARY] I'm sorry
but that's, like,

354
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,916
uber creeps-ville.

355
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,416
[COCO] That was scary,
Lord Byro!

356
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,000
Please don't
ever do that again!

357
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:18,708
[BYRO] You're the
ones who asked for it!

358
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,541
[LUCY] Our new friends
set out on their journey

359
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,416
with laughter and
friendship in their hearts.

360
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,875
[LUCY] We'll see
them again soon.

361
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,541
I'm sure of it.

362
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,458
[DORANBOLT] Welcome back,
Master Org.

363
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,125
How was the
Council meeting?

364
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,250
Did it go well?

365
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,666
[LAHAR] Has a
decision been reached

366
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,583
in regards to the Inter-Guild
Commerce Treaty Revision?

367
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:48,916
[ORG] Yes, it has.

368
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,625
But we all know
that's not the reason

369
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,750
you've come here today.

370
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,083
[LAHAR] The chief members
of Fairy Tail have returned.

371
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,791
[ORG] For political reasons,
the chairman seems intent

372
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,666
on blaming the
Infinity Clock

373
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,083
and Neo-Oración Seis
incidents on their return.

374
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,625
[ORG] It's as if we're
treating Zentopia

375
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,666
as the victims instead
of an involved party.

376
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,291
[ORG] Ah, well.

377
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:13,791
At least both matters
have finally been resolved.

378
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:14,958
[ORG] The magic
world is free to

379
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,416
be as unbound by
worry as before.

380
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,375
Still I can't
shake the feeling

381
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:22,833
this is an omen
for something worse.

382
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:25,458
[ORG] It's been seven years
since Acnologia and Zeref

383
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,625
were last seen
on Tenrow Island.

384
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:28,833
[LAHAR] I apologize, sir.

385
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,333
The lack of progress
falls on my shoulders.

386
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:34,791
[ORG] Perhaps we should
bolster the Observation Unit.

387
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:38,958
[ORG] These past seven years
have been far too quiet.

388
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:42,875
We've managed to keep tabs on
Sabertooth's rise to power.

389
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,166
But Tartaros and Grimoire
Heart have remained silent.

390
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,375
[ORG] And there's
been no news

391
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,500
of Zeref or Acnologia.

392
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:50,708
We know they're out there,

393
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,208
and there's nothing
we can do but sit here.

394
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,041
[ORG] I don't
care for waiting

395
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,708
around helplessly,
it's unnerving.

396
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:58,833
Like being trapped in

397
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,208
a world of
perpetual darkness.

398
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:05,875
[ORG] But the sun
may be on the horizon.

399
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:09,166
I wonder, will it
usher in a great dawn

400
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,916
for the magic world?

401
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,625
[DORANBOLT] You think
it's Fairy Tail.

402
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,833
That they'll save us.

403
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,250
[Org laughing]

404
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,500
[ORG] Ironic, isn't it?

405
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,875
After all the disdain
I've held for them,

406
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:23,541
I'm placing my hopes on
that group of miscreants.

407
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:28,750
I must be getting old.

408
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:31,750
[NATSU] Who's
Sabertooth again?

409
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,166
[ROMEO] They're
incredibly strong.

410
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,458
Like, majorly!

411
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,208
[ROMEO] They
surpassed Blue Pegasus

412
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,875
and Lamia Scale
a while back,

413
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,875
so now they're the strongest
wizard guild around.

414
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,333
[GRAY] I've never
heard of them 'til today.

415
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,791
[ALZACK] That's because
seven years ago,

416
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,166
nobody had heard of 'em.

417
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,625
[GRAY] Then, what?

418
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,166
They just started growing
like crazy all of a sudden?

419
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,416
[MAX] It started once
they got a new master.

420
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,833
After he took over,

421
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,791
five incredibly strong
wizards joined,

422
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,166
and that was all she wrote.

423
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,375
[LUCY] Wow,
five new members

424
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,833
made that much
of a difference?

425
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,541
[NATSU] Sounds like these
guys have some serious guts.

426
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,375
[WENDY] If they're the
number one guild in Fiore

427
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,416
does that mean Fairy
Tail's number two?

428
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,500
[HAPPY] Are you serious?

429
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,666
[CARLA] Wendy.

430
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,250
Would you take a look
around you, child?

431
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,000
[WENDY] Huh?

432
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,250
[ROMEO] We're dead last.

433
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,458
[ALZACK] They call
us "Wimpy Fail".

434
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:12,041
[BISCA] You just had
to ask, didn't you?

435
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:13,708
[WENDY] Aw, I'm sorry!

436
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,125
[NATSU] Wow,
we're in last place?

437
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,000
That's perfect!

438
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,083
This is gonna be fun!

439
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,125
[GRAY] For who?

440
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,333
[NATSU] Just think
about it, Gray!

441
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,000
It's gonna be
awesome clawin'

442
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,875
our way back up to
the top all over again!

443
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,333
I can't wait!

444
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:25,708
[GRAY]
'Course you can't.

445
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,458
[ROMEO] There's just no
keepin' you down, is there?

446
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:28,791
I'm fired up now.

447
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,375
[WENDY] I am, too!

448
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:33,083
I can't wait to
show 'em what we've got!

449
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,166
[CANA] Sorry to interrupt, 

450
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,166
but have you seen
Gildarts anywhere?

451
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,208
[GRAY] What's the matter?

452
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,875
Does widdle Cana
start to get lonely

453
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,666
whenever Daddy's
not around?

454
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,000
[CANA] Gray!

455
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,375
[GRAY] My bad!

456
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,416
[LUCY] It's okay!

457
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,791
Seriously,
don't worry about it.

458
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,500
[JUVIA] Gray never considers
my feelings like that!

459
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,458
[ERZA] Gildarts and
Master Makarov just left.

460
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,166
They're going to visit
the old guild hall.

461
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,458
[CANA]
Halle-freakin'-lujah!

462
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,708
I'm going on a job
before he realizes I'm gone!

463
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,541
[HAPPY] Gildarts
does go overboard

464
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,416
with the mushy feelings
when it comes to Cana!

465
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,291
[PANTHERLILY] And you're
the same when it comes to Carla.

466
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,458
[CARLA] And yet he's
the most powerful wizard

467
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,416
we have at our disposal.

468
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,250
What a strange,
little guild we are.

469
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,208
[GILDARTS] Hey Master.

470
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,958
Are you sure it's
okay to be in here?

471
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,958
I mean, the property's
been seized.

472
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,458
Aren't we trespassing?

473
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,250
[MAKAROV] It'll be
ours again soon enough.

474
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,458
[GILDARTS] How long
is this staircase?

475
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,625
And how did I not
know the guild hall

476
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,583
had an underground
passageway?

477
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,250
[MAKAROV] I never
told anyone about it.

478
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,125
[GILDARTS] Why
all the secrecy?

479
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,000
[MAKAROV] Patience.

480
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,791
You're about to find out.

481
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,333
[GILDARTS] Okay.

482
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:39,291
[MAKAROV] Here we go.

483
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:52,000
[GILDARTS] What kinda
place is this?

484
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:59,666
[GILDARTS] What kinda
place is this?

485
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,833
[MAKAROV] Before you is
Fairy Tail's greatest secret.

486
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:13,208
[MAKAROV] And that
is the Lumen Histoire.

487
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:18,291
[GILDARTS] What
is this feeling?

488
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,041
It's overwhelming.

489
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,958
[MAKAROV] This is the
essence of Fairy Tail.

490
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,125
The "true essence"
Mavis spoke of.

491
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:29,708
[GILDARTS] I'm at a
complete loss for words here.

492
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,166
[MAKAROV] I don't blame you.

493
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,166
The first time Master Precht
brought me to this place,

494
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,958
I almost forgot to breathe.

495
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,791
[GILDARTS] This has been
under our feet the whole time?

496
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,166
[GILDARTS] Hold on, why
are you showing this to me?

497
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:45,416
[MAKAROV] Because
like Precht before me,

498
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,666
it's my job to choose
the next guild master.

499
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,916
And that's you.

500
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:05,416
[NATSU] Yo, Gildarts!

501
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,083
It's go time!

502
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:11,791
I ain't leavin'
till you're eatin' dirt!

503
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,375
[HAPPY] Is it me,
or does Natsu remind you

504
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,375
of a bug lookin'
to bite somebody?

505
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:22,333
[NATSU] Hey, what's
the deal, old man?

506
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,500
Quit bein' a buzz-kill!

507
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:25,583
[GILDARTS] What do you mean?

508
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,916
This is how I always act.

509
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,875
[NATSU] Sure about that?

510
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:34,000
[GILDARTS] I never change, kid.

511
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,458
[STING] It sure
takes ya back, doesn't it?

512
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,333
Last time we saw them,

513
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:42,666
you came up to
about here on Gajeel.

514
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,708
[STING] You were a pretty
big fan of his back then.

515
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:47,875
I didn't care for him.

516
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,500
He was scary.

517
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,958
[ROGUE] Stop bringing
up the past, Sting.

518
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:55,833
We chose to follow a
different path than them.

519
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,791
[MALE WIZARD 151A]
I've found you!

520
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,458
[MALE WIZARD 151A]
Take this!

521
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,291
[MALE WIZARD 151A]
He's eating the arrow.

522
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,875
[MALE WIZARD 151A]
Don't tell me it's him!

523
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:26,458
[STING] Aw Damn it.

524
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,041
Guess I'm out of practice.

525
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,916
[STING] His head's still there.

526
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,375
[MALE WIZARD 151A]
I knew it!

527
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,875
It really is you!

528
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,291
The Twin Dragons
of the Sabertooth guild,

529
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,500
in the flesh!

530
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:38,750
[MALE WIZARD 151A]
White Dragon Sting

531
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,416
and Shadow Dragon Rogue!

532
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,250
The Dragon Slayer duo!

533
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,625
[STING] Hold up!

534
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,875
Are you just gonna
ditch your pals?

535
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,916
That's harsh, man!

536
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,458
[ROGUE] He's part
of a dark guild.

537
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:57,125
What did you
expect him to do?

538
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:58,625
[LECTOR] Geez, Sting!

539
00:21:58,708 --> 00:21:59,708
You don't know when
to hold back, do ya?

540
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:00,791
[FROSCH] Ribbit!

541
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,625
[STING] Hey, it's
Lector and Frosch.

542
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,458
I was wonderin'
where you guys went.

543
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,458
[LECTOR] Oh, you know,
just doing some recon stuff.

544
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,041
[LECTOR] We thought
we'd find the enemy

545
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:09,500
before they ambushed us,

546
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:10,583
but it looks like
the two of you

547
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,458
have already taken
care of them, huh?

548
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,208
[LECTOR] Those guys got
what they deserved

549
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,916
for messin' with
awesome dragon slayers.

550
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
[FROSCH] Yeah you're
the best-est ever!

551
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:17,916
[STING] Damn straight.

552
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,958
[LECTOR] You're
the man to beat!

553
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,875
The strongest
Dragon Slayer of all time!

554
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:23,833
Look out!

555
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:26,000
[STING] Thanks, man.

556
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,208
I'm feelin' pretty good.

557
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:28,041
Bet I could beat Natsu
if I had the chance.

558
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:28,958
[LECTOR] For sure!

559
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,458
He couldn't hold
a candle to ya!

560
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:32,916
[STING] Why don't we
find out for ourselves?

561
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,250
What do ya say?

562
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:35,958
[ROGUE] I think
I'll pass, thanks.

563
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,125
[FROSCH] Me too!

564
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,083
[HAPPY] Big news!

565
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:15,375
There's gonna
be a huge tournament

566
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:17,958
to decide which guild is
the strongest in Fiore!

567
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,375
[NATSU] You mean
the Grand Magic Games?

568
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,541
I am so there

569
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,250
and I'm gonna bring
home the gold, baby!

570
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:23,000
[HAPPY] You sure?

571
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:24,166
Max is pretty weak

572
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,833
and you're havin'
a hard time beatin' him.

573
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:26,833
[NATSU] No biggie!

574
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:27,958
I've got plenty
of time to train!

575
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:29,833
I'm gettin'
all fired up now!

576
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,625
Next time: And So
We Aim for the Top!

577
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,125
[HAPPY] What're you
gonna do if the competition

578
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:38,083
ends up bein' trivia
contests instead of fighting?

579
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:38,916
[NATSU] Uh.

580
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,166
What I always do.

581
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,208
Roast the competition!
