Hey, Lucy. Is that a building?

475
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:28,875
I think it might be.

476
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:32,250
So, we got this message
from the Magic Council.

477
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,750
[LAHAR] In it, we ask you
to survey this island.

478
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,250
[GRAY, NATSU, LUCY gasp]

479
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:42,208
And do it together. Sabertooth
and Fairy Tail, as one.

480
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:45,250
Came a long way to check
if they got your mail.

481
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,500
About that.
They kinda rode with us.

482
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,791
The Master sent us
to check on you.

483
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,375
Everywhere you've been,
mysterious stories of arson,

484
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,875
vandalism, and restaurant
terrorism have followed.

485
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,875
Mr. Lahar stopped by
the guild for a visit

486
00:21:56,958 --> 00:22:00,250
just before we left. So we
decided to come here together.

487
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,375
If we're to form
the first expedition.

488
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,916
Then you need tell us everything
you know about this island.

489
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,375
I don't plan to go in blindly.

490
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,625
The Magic Council has
ordered me to tell you this.

491
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,291
"The island is dangerous." So...

492
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,541
That's it?

493
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,916
[LUCY gasps]

494
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,750
[NATSU]
Hm. Hey! Is somethin' wrong?

495
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,250
[KEMO-KEMO] That important
thing that I've forgotten?

496
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:28,083
Sometimes I try too
hard to remember it.

497
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,416
When that happens,
my head gets dizzy

498
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,250
and my thoughts go dim.

499
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,958
This might be a bad time
for me to do this.

500
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:39,208
But I don't know what would be
better, and I can't do nothing.

501
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:15,625
[HAPPY] I like Kemo-Kemo as much
as you do, but he's weird.

502
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:17,125
[NATSU]
Seems normal to me.

503
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:18,583
[HAPPY] He hatched from an
egg that fell out of the sky!

504
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,000
Does that seem normal to you?

505
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,708
[NATSU] That's how you
were born, so yeah.

506
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:23,250
[HAPPY]
Ah, I forgot about that.

507
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:25,541
What about his fire-breath?
That's way weird!

508
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:27,041
[NATSU]
I breathe fire!

509
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:29,333
[HAPPY] Uhhh, he's growing
freakishly fast and it's weird!

510
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:30,333
[NATSU]
Puberty is hard enough

511
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:31,791
without people
callin' you weird!

512
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:33,666
[HAPPY] Oh yeah,
and he doesn't eat either!

513
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,750
[NATSU, HAPPY] Next Time:
"The Place You Came To"

514
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,958
[HAPPY] Don't you wanna
know what Kemo-Kemo is?

515
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,458
I mean what if he's an alien?

516
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:41,958
[NATSU] He's part of my family!
That's all I need to know.
