1
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:22,875
[RUFUS] What happened?
Where am I?

2
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:26,333
It's as if I've blocked
it from my memory...

3
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:28,958
Ah yes, there it is.

4
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:31,791
This is the Royal
Library in Crocus.

5
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:36,041
And today is the final day
of the Grand Magic Games...

6
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:39,791
But, this place, filled
with the wisdom of ages,

7
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:42,333
is where they ended for me.

8
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:43,791
For this is where
I was defeated

9
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,500
by the wizard from Fairy Tail.

10
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:19,791
[CHAPATI] The underdogs
from Fairy Tail have made

11
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,500
a thrilling rally and
are now leading the pack...

12
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,416
With an impressive fifty points!

13
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,333
And all five members of
their team are still in play.

14
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,625
[CHAPATI] But nipping at their
heels are both Sabertooth and

15
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:32,958
Lamia Scale, who each
have forty-nine points!

16
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,208
[YAJIMA] With forty-three
points, Mermaid Heel needs

17
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:38,000
to kick it into high gear
if they want to catch up.

18
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,041
Things are looking
a little grim, chicas.

19
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,333
We're still
in this...

20
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:42,291
but it's gonna be real tough.

21
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,083
Aw, quit yer
cryin', you two.

22
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,958
We still got Kagura
on the field,

23
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,333
and Milliana's one
tough kitty herself.

24
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,875
Never underestimate
us mermaids!

25
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,333
Yeah, I guess.

26
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,916
But I still got something
kinda stuck in my craw...

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,708
What's bothering you?

28
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,833
[BETH] Well, I've been
watchin' the screen up there,

29
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,708
and they haven't shown
Millianna in a long time.

30
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,083
Is that so?

31
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,291
[LISLIE] You worry too much.

32
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,041
I bet she's just found
a sweet hiding spot

33
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,166
and she's waiting for the
perfect time to pounce.

34
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,791
[ARAÑA] Sounds like her.

35
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:10,958
Well, I hope
you're right...

36
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,875
But I can't say
I'm sure about it...

37
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,666
I just gotta gut feeling
she's in some kinda trouble.

38
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,791
[MINERVA giggles]

39
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,541
[HAPPY] The Kingdom
'til Tomorrow!

40
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:37,083
[LUCY] No matter where we go,
it all looks exactly the same.

41
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,500
It's impossible to
know if you're going

42
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:39,833
the right way or not.

43
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,208
Well, this is just the way
we're goin' right now.

44
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,583
I'm pretty sure this is
gonna lead us outta here.

45
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,625
I can kinda sense a breeze.

46
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:49,833
Do you know, Loke?
How'd you get down here anyway?

47
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,250
I just jumped.

48
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,500
[WENDY] But you really
didn't pay attention

49
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:53,958
to how you got here?

50
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,666
[LOKE] I live by the "leap
before you look" philosophy.

51
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,125
[NATSU] Wow, you're actually
kinda cool sometimes.

52
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,041
[LOKE] Thanks.

53
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,791
What about
Colonel Arcadios?

54
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,375
Do you think he'll be okay?

55
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:04,583
He's doing great
considering what

56
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,333
he just went through.

57
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,000
[HAPPY] After jumping
into the lava like that,

58
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,125
I'm surprised he's still alive.

59
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,458
[CARLA] It's extraordinary...

60
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,416
Did he have help
from Horologium?

61
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,583
No. He jumped
in before anyone

62
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,125
had the chance to help.

63
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:20,208
What an amazing
warrior. And so noble.

64
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,625
Check out
his necklace.

65
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,000
That's no ordinary
piece of jewelry.

66
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:28,125
The jadestone is a
strong protection charm.

67
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,833
There's jade
again. Like Zirconis.

68
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,791
He called himself
the Jade Dragon.

69
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,208
[NATSU] And he was
kind of a jerk.

70
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,791
[LUCY] Well, he certainly
talked a lot, didn't he?

71
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,041
It's strange.

72
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:41,000
Princess Hisui's name
translates to 'Jade.'

73
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,708
[CARLA] And we're to talk to
her about this Eclipse project.

74
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,500
To decide whether
or not it's right.

75
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:46,708
[NATSU] She threw
Lucy down here,

76
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,250
so we definitely got
something to talk about.

77
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,875
That may be true,
but let's not lose focus.

78
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,750
First and foremost,
we need to get out of here

79
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,708
and let the rest of the
guild know we're safe.

80
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,416
You're right.

81
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,500
[PANTHERLILY] We still
may have a ways to go.

82
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:06,083
[MIRAJANE] Yeah, there's no
telling how deep this cave is.

83
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,500
[LOKE] You could probably
fit an entire city in here.

84
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,041
[LUCY] Tell me about it.

85
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,125
[NATSU] Whoa! I smell somethin'!

86
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,625
[WENDY] That probably means
we're almost to the exit.

87
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,291
[YUKINO] Perhaps the head
of the execution squad

88
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,041
was telling the truth after all.

89
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,916
Don't you think it's kinda
weird that the rest of

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,166
them told us their names.

91
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,083
but the leader never
said what his was?

92
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,875
Yeah, that's true.

93
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,583
We gotta call him
something, I guess...

94
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:30,666
How 'bout Scythe?!

95
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,416
[LUCY] That's original.

96
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,958
Hey!
Look over there!

97
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:35,875
[NATSU] It's a door!

98
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,000
[HAPPY] Heck yeah it is!

99
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,666
[LUCY] Maybe that's the way out!

100
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,250
[PANTHERLILY] It's huge.

101
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,625
[WENDY] It looks
really hard to open.

102
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,125
[YUKINO] Yes, it does.

103
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,916
[NATSU] Don't worry,
I got this...

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,375
Fire Dragon...

105
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:49,541
What the--?!

106
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,041
We're free!

107
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,500
[NATSU grunting]

108
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:58,625
But how?

109
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,083
Is it a trap?

110
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:08,125
[NATSU grunting]

111
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,000
Thanks, but...
who are you?

112
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:44,958
[SOLDIER A] Princess! Princess!
I bring terrible news!

113
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,791
[SOLDIER B] Calm down,
and tell us what it is.

114
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,291
[SOLDIER A] Okay. We
haven't received any

115
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,875
updates from the
palace of perdition.

116
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,166
so we sent a squad
to investigate.

117
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,625
They report that the
Hungry Wolf Knights

118
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:54,666
have been wiped out!

119
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,583
[SOLDIER D] What?!

120
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,750
Impossible!

121
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,625
By that tiny
group of wizards?!

122
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,416
[SOLDIER D] Any word
on the criminals?!

123
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,666
[SOLDIER A] It seems
they were able to escape.

124
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,833
[SOLDIER C] That
doesn't make sense!

125
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,000
[HISUI thinking] I knew it...

126
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:12,875
[DARTON] I wouldn't
celebrate just yet, Princess.

127
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,541
Your plan
is clear as day.

128
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:16,958
[HISUI] Darton!

129
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:20,083
I thought you were accompanying
my father to Domus Flau.

130
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,000
I couldn't shake
my suspicions.

131
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:25,958
So I decided to return... And
now they've been confirmed.

132
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:29,166
I won't stand for this
abuse! Not from you...

133
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,291
After all, you're the
one who sent Arcadios

134
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,875
to the Palace of Perdition
without a trial.

135
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,041
[DARTON] Which is precisely
why you decided to use the

136
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:39,666
Fairy Tail guild in order
to rescue him. Correct?

137
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,541
[SOLDIERS gasp]

138
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,500
[DARTON] The truth of the
matter is, you're the one

139
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,833
who's really in charge
of the Eclipse Project.

140
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,291
Arcadios was
willing to play

141
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:51,541
the role of villain
to deflect suspicion...

142
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:55,250
He wanted to conceal the fact
that you're running the show.

143
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,833
Please. correct me
if I'm wrong, Princess.

144
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,583
No, you saw right
through our charade...

145
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,500
Impressive.

146
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:08,958
[DARTON] I implore you. You must
understand what is at risk here!

147
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,166
That device
is dangerous!

148
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,583
Changing history
could spell our doom!

149
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:35,208
[HISUI] Perhaps... But it
may be our only salvation.

150
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,916
[DARTON] It may be?

151
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,916
Listen... I swore
that I'd tell no one...

152
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,500
but I'm afraid that I
have no other options.

153
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,500
There's another
plan in the works.

154
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,916
Another way the
device can be used...

155
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,958
The Eclipse Two.

156
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,041
Two?

157
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:57,875
[HISUI] It is the true
purpose of the Eclipse.

158
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:03,000
[HISUI] And if this plan
should fail. tomorrow.

159
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:06,333
our kingdom will
be wiped off the map.

160
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,291
[CHAPATI] With all five
members still in the game,

161
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,791
team Fairy Tail is looking
like an unstoppable force.

162
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,500
No surprise there.
After all, my dear friend

163
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:22,958
Laxus is among their ranks.

164
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,416
We're all called
the Thunder Legion

165
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,916
for a reason, ya know?

166
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,416
Well, I just wish
he'd stop holding back

167
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,041
and put the hurt on
those other guilds!

168
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,083
Savoring the
moment before victory.

169
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,666
That's my Laxus!

170
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,125
[EVERGREEN] We're a team!

171
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,000
Laxus! Time to show
the world your power!

172
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,791
[BIXLOW, EVERGREEN, &amp; FRIED]
Go, Laxus! Go, Laxus!

173
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,000
Put a sock in it!

174
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,750
So Master Mavis...
what's next in your plan?

175
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,500
Although Laxus
is hanging back,

176
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,666
the others seem
to be on the move.

177
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,708
Don't worry, everything
is falling into place.

178
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:59,708
[JUVIA thinking] I've hit my
mark, precisely when I was told.

179
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,250
[SHELIA] Sky God... Boreas!

180
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,791
[JUVIA thinking] It's just as
Master Mavis predicted!

181
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,250
[MAVIS] Juvia and
Shelia will collide.

182
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,166
Widdle Shelly-welly!

183
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,500
Yeah, yeah...

184
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,750
You're the girl Lyon's
in love with, right?

185
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,916
Yes, and it's
definitely NOT MUTUAL!

186
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,875
[SHELIA] Oh yeah? Then get lost!

187
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,041
[EVERGREEN] That's Shelia,
the God Slayer...

188
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,833
She doesn't look
like a huge threat,

189
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,375
but she can heal herself.

190
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:34,833
Then how in the heck is
Juvia supposed to beat her?!

191
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,750
She just needs
to keep her busy.

192
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:40,000
That'll give Erza the
opportunity to take on Minerva.

193
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,458
[BIXLOW, EVERGREEN, &amp; FRIED]
You seem pretty darn confident!

194
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,833
[FRIED] Master Mavis,
this Minerva...

195
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,083
she's the one
from Sabertooth

196
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:50,750
who brutally attacked
Lucy in the water round.

197
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,625
[BIXLOW] She's serious trouble.

198
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:56,041
[EVERGREEN] I'm sure she's
nothing "Titania" can't handle.

199
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,166
[ERZA] There it is...

200
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,625
According to the plan, I'll
encounter Minerva here soon.

201
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,125
[CHAPATI] Here comes Kagura!

202
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,375
What?

203
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,041
[ERZA thinking] The First
Master was wrong?!

204
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,833
[ERZA thinking] Her skill!

205
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,250
[KAGURA thinking] Let's
see if she's deserving

206
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,291
of her reputation as a warrior!

207
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,958
[MAKAROV] Kagura?!
That's not in the plan!

208
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,583
I thought Erza was scheduled
to go up against Minerva,

209
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:52,833
was she not?

210
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,541
It would seem the
renowned Fairy Tactician.

211
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,875
has made an error
in her calculations.

212
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:57,791
[BIXLOW &amp; EVERGREEN] Shh!

213
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,916
[FRIED] Hmm?

214
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,958
I made a mistake?
How could this happen?

215
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,833
I'm... so... ashamed.

216
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,541
[MAKAROV] Oh... Uh! It's okay!

217
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,625
No... I'm not
gonna cry about it.

218
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,833
These things just
happen sometimes.

219
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,041
[MAKAROV] Aw, damnit!
Quick! Somebody!

220
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,958
[EVERGREEN] This is
all your fault, Fried!

221
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:17,666
[FRIED] What?!

222
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,916
[MAKAROV] Calm her down!

223
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,083
[CROWD cheering]

224
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,458
[CHAPATI] Now this is
one heck of a matchup!

225
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:30,541
It's the ultimate
swordswoman showdown!

226
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,500
This should prove to be
one of the better fights.

227
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,666
[ERZA thinking] Even her
sheathed sword is deadly.

228
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:39,708
[CHAPATI] Wow!

229
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,416
These two blade-wielding
beauties are literally

230
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,333
locked in combat!

231
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,208
[BOTH gasp]

232
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,583
[ERZA &amp; KAGURA grunting]

233
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,041
[MINERVA] Ha...

234
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,791
[ERZA &amp; KAGURA grunt]

235
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,708
[MAKAROV &amp; MAVIS gasp]

236
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,250
[CHAPATI] Holy cow!

237
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,708
If you don't mind,
I'd love to join you.

238
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,750
[CHAPATI] What an entrance,
Minerva jumps in

239
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,541
from seemingly out of nowhere!

240
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:08,000
Oh no... I never
saw this coming!

241
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,375
[CHAPATI] Amazing!

242
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,750
This one-on-one battle has
turned into a three-way brawl!

243
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,166
The tournament's trio
of feminine power is now

244
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:27,375
facing off in what will
surely be an epic showdown!

245
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:37,041
[FRIED] They are all
immensely powerful...

246
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,500
How could anyone
predict this outcome?

247
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,500
Erza should make
easy work of them!

248
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,166
Yeah, well...
I wouldn't say "easy".

249
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,125
Kagura. You've
got this one!

250
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,666
She's prolly
gonna win, right?

251
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,916
I told you not
to worry, didn't I?

252
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,875
[BETH] I know, but. I'm scared.

253
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,625
As long as I've known
her, she's never let me down.

254
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,583
You know how much
strength she has inside.

255
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,166
Don't lose faith in her.

256
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,625
[RUFUS] Erza... and Kagura.

257
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:06,166
Their strength has been
burned into my memory.

258
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,500
But still...
M'lady will claim victory.

259
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,541
Not only is she the most
powerful fighter in our guild,

260
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:15,625
she has our master's
blood in her veins.

261
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,833
Sting and Rogue are
more widely known,

262
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:21,541
but in reality can't
hold a candle to her.

263
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,625
No matter
whom I'm up against.

264
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,500
I will win.

265
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,250
[KAGURA thinking] I can't seem
to understand how she thinks.

266
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,291
From what Millianna has told me
she underwent unimaginable pain

267
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,416
at the hands of Jellal.

268
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,333
So, why does she protect him?

269
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,958
[MINERVA] My guild's
image is tarnished...

270
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,875
These last few matches
have been, problematic...

271
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:42,916
But ...

272
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,541
I have an opportunity.

273
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,750
Your guilds have inflicted
the most damage...

274
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,916
Fairy Tail and Mermaid Heel.

275
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,041
It's up to me
to reclaim

276
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,750
Sabertooth's rightful
place on top...

277
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,875
I think eliminating
both of you at the same time

278
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,666
should make that
abundantly clear.

279
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,583
Right?

280
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,791
How very
ambitious of you.

281
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,333
Enough talk
for now... Fight!

282
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,375
[CHAPATI] Uh-oh! You feel that?

283
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,166
The surge of power emanating
from our competitors

284
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,791
is totally off the charts!

285
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,375
Yes.

286
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,791
Even from this far away, I can
feel the waves of intensity.

287
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,916
And this is only the beginning.

288
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,583
They have strength!

289
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,416
But they'll never
match your spirit!

290
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,708
Take 'em down!

291

[grunting]

294
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,625
Victory is mine!

296
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,125

297
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:21,833
[KAGURA] No!

298
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,041
[ERZA] What is this?!

Derus erkantia!

What kinda
crazy talk is that?

302
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,333
Some kind
of incantation.

303
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,416
But I don't know it.

304
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,333
Erza! Run away!

305
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,500
That magic!

306
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,000
What is it?

307
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,833
It's the Eighteen
Battle Gods of Yakuma?!

308

and unforgettable.

00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:19,458
Whoa...

316
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,083
Crazy!

317
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,916
[BOTH] Take this! And this!
And that! And that!

318
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,375
[CHAPATI] How can
they still be standing?!

319
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,750
[MALE A] They're incredible!

320
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,375
[MALE B] That's the
understatement of the year, man!

321
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,333
[FEMALE A] They're so cool!

322
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,333
Wow...

323
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,125
That one made my
heart skip a beat!

324
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,708
I can't believe she's
mastered that magic!

325
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,625
Those are three chicks
ya don't wanna mess with.

326
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,833
You think this means
their magic power is equal?

327
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,458
I honestly can't say.

328
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,250
[MINERVA] How fascinating...

329
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,416
I'm afraid I may have
underestimated your strength.

330
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,208
Engaging
you two personally

331
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,250
has taught me many things...

332
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:03,125
You both have so much power
raging beneath the surface.

333
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,625
Continuing on like
this will take us nowhere...

334
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,291
So let's change up
the game just a bit.

335
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,041
Do you see that?
It's her!

336
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,500
Yes...

337
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,583
[MILLIANNA groaning]

338
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,125
[ERZA &amp; KAGURA gasp]

339
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,041
I found
a stray kitten.

340
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,208
[ERZA &amp; KAGURA] Millianna!

341
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,125
[MILLIANNA groaning]

342
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,875
[ERZA] What is the
meaning of this?!

343
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,125
[MINERVA chuckles]

344
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,500
[MINERVA] Look at that
face, twisted with pain.

345
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:40,291
The sphere she's in constantly
drains her magic power...

346
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,250
It's excruciating.

347
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,708
Erzy!

348
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,666
Oh, a kitty
of my very own!

349
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,458
It's been a while,
Erzy-Werzy!

350
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,541
She's taken her hostage.

351
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,166
How could
she stoop so low?!

352
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,333
I told y'all.
She's in trouble!

353
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,375
But why?

354
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,791
Why would she
wanna kidnap Millia?

355
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,583
Surrendering
won't save her...

356
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:06,041
Rest assured, I have a much
more entertaining plan in mind.

357
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,916
I told you that I wanted
to change the game.

358
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,625
[KAGURA growls]

359
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,166
[ERZA growls]

360
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,500
Oh yes... Those scornful
looks speak volumes.

361
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,250
[DARTON] Are you sure of this?!

362
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,791
If what you say is true,
then we must act at once!

363
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,125
That means calling off
the games this instant!

364
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,458
Not just yet...
It's too soon.

365
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,583
First, we must verify that this
person's claims are accurate.

366
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,083
Princess. We may not
have that kind of time.

367
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:43,500
We're putting the lives of
countless citizens at risk!

368
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,666
[HISUI] This person claims
to know the future...

369
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,875
which includes the outcome
of the Grand Magic Games.

370
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,041
They told me that a
certain guild would win

371
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,500
in a way that no one imagined.

372
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,500
But what does
that mean?

373
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,375
[HISUI] It's unexpected
enough that no one could

374
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,125
ever see it coming...

375
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:05,416
So, if this outcome does indeed
come to pass, it's proof...

376
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,500
I will believe their
other dire predictions.

377
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,666
This is the future
of our kingdom...

378
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,416
You'd bet it solely
on the final results

379
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,625
of the Grand Magic Games?!

380
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:18,125
I have a hard
time believing it.

381
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,750
That's why we must wait.

382
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:23,041
We must be absolutely
certain in their words.

383
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,541
What then?

384
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,416
What if the games end exactly
as this mysterious advisor

385
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,083
claims they will?

386
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,041
Then we can put
our trust in them.

387
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:33,375
We can heed their warning
and act accordingly.

388
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,000
And that means...

389
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,916
I'll have no choice
but to activate Eclipse.

390
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,625
But how?

391
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,500
Is it a trap?

392
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:56,958
[NATSU grunting]

393
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,208
Thanks, but...
Who are you?

394
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:28,958
[NATSU sniffing]

395
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,458
Hey, wait!
I recognize that smell!

396
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,041
No doubt about it.

397
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,500
Natsu...

398
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,416
[quietly sobbing]

399
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,166
[NATSU gasps]

400
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,208
[sobbing continues]

401
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,416
[NATSU] What the hell?

402
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,500
[GIRL] Please...
You have to help me.

403
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,250
What? It's her voice...

404
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,791
I don't understand.

405
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,333
Neither do I.
What's happening?

406
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:54,833
Don't know.

407
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,500
Show us who you are!

408
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,958
[LUCY gasps]

409
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,208
They told me...

410
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,791
No!

411
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,333
[HISUI] That they
came from the future.

412
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:16,833
Lucy?!

413
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:18,291
It's me?!

414
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,958
Two Lucys again?
Is she the Edolas one?

415
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,208
She's not.

416
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:26,625
And I'm afraid it's not
gonna be simple as that.

417
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,166
[thinking] Oh no...

418
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:31,583
[CARLA] That means
my premonition...

419
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:34,166
Could it be coming true?

420
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:38,958
[FUTURE LUCY] I'm
begging you. Please help...

421
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:41,458
The whole kingdom...
is doomed...

422
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,916
[HAPPY] What?! How
could there be two Lucys?!

423
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,083
[NATSU] Aw, calm
down. It's no big deal!

424
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:19,208
People get copies of
themselves all the time.

425
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,708
[HAPPY] Nuh-uh, liar! You're
just making that up!

426
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:23,458
[NATSU] No, I'm not! Trust me!

427
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:25,416
It's, like, the hot
new thing to do!

428
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,875
[HAPPY] How would you know?

429
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,958
[NATSU] Cuz. Uhh... Oooh!

430
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:31,208
Erza's got a big fight,
let's cheer her on!

431
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:33,958
[HAPPY] You're just trying
to change the subject.

432
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,541
[HAPPY &amp; NATSU] Next time:
Erza vs. Kagura

433
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:39,291
[HAPPY] Come on, tell me!
Where did you hear about it?

434
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:41,291
[NATSU] None of
your business, dude.
