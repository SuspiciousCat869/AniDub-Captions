1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,791
Listen up, it's Code Blue.

2
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,416
I just hit a snag here.

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,916
[ALL]
Huh?

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,041
[GRAY]
No, no. Not that kind.

5
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,750
Mm-hmm.

6
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,041
Hell if I know.

7
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:30,375
You should probably
ask him yourself.

8
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:31,458
Yeah.

9
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:34,125
All that stuff on him
just faded away.

10
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:35,208
Uh.

11
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:36,958
Hold it up to your ear, man.

12
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,250
What's it supposed to do?

13
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,416
[ERZA]
Natsu. This is you, right?

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,958
[NATSU gasps]

15
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:45,000
[GRAY]
Mh-hm.

16
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:49,958
Congratulations. Your antics
blew Gray's covert operation.

17
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,208
What're you tryin'
to say, Erza?

18
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,708
I'm a spy. Give me some credit.

19
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:31,583
You really think I would join
some creepy Zeref cult?

20
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,541
It's time to get moving.

21
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,375
We'll explain everything
on the way.

22
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:36,916
[BOTH gasp]

23
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,375
[ERZA]
Several months ago,

24
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:48,666
Jellal asked me to do a
favor for Crime Sorcière.

25
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,458
I was to investigate Avatar.

26
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,125
Discover their
connection to Zeref.

27
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,416
[ERZA]
The trail grew cold,

28
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,791
but I'd just happened
to reconnect with Gray.

29
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,541
It ended up being a lucky break.

30
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,208
How are we still hearing her?

31
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,833
We've got a portable
communication lacrima.

32
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,208
Anyway, after our last fight,

33
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:10,916
this pattern broke
out all over me,

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,041
so I went to Porlyusica
to see if she could help.

35
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:17,041
As you saw, now I'm able to
make it appear and disappear

36
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,791
whenever I want.

37
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,166
So, after we had discussed
our current situations,

38
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,666
it was obvious we needed to come
up with a plan to work together.

39
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,083
It was fate.

40
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,666
Of course, I would
do anything for Erza.

41
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,916
Not only that,

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,458
I wanted to get my hands
on the Book of E.N.D.

43
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,208
My dad's last wish was
for me to destroy it.

44
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:38,291
Yeah, okay. But why didn't
you tell Juvia about this?

45
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,125
She's literally worried sick!

46
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,916
[ERZA]
I know.

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,750
It's because I asked him
to keep it a secret.

48
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:50,583
A covert mission such as this
needs to be kept confidential.

49
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,416
The more people that
are made aware of it,

50
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,625
the more likely it is to fail.

51
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,041
And also, mere
knowledge of the plan

52
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,750
can put someone in danger.

53
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,916
So you kept her in the dark
for her protection, huh?

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,125
Still a crappy thing to do!

55
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,916
I feel bad for what Juvia's
had to go through.

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,416
And unfortunately for all of us,

57
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,958
the mission has
lasted much longer

58
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,375
than I'd first anticipated.

59
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,541
The situation has
changed dramatically.

60
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,958
It started out as a
routine investigation.

61
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:21,291
But then, we learned of their
diabolical "purification plan."

62
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,208
[GRAY] Avatar's gonna try
to wipe out an entire city

63
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,541
because they think
it'll summon Zeref.

64
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:29,500
They actually believe the site
of concentrated death like that

65
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,333
will attract their "Dark Lord."

66
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,583
[gasps]

67
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,625
It's up to us to stop
that from happening,

68
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,208
no matter what it takes.

69
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,750
Why didn't you guys just wipe
'em out in the very beginning?

70
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,666
Somethin' like that would
be easy for you and Erza!

71
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,041
You'd think, but you'd be wrong.

72
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,708
After a little digging,
we found out

73
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:49,666
Avatar is a way bigger
organization than we'd thought.

74
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,666
I was able to infiltrate
to some degree,

75
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,666
but only inside a single branch.

76
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,083
Each one is kept separate

77
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:58,708
and has limited contact
with the main headquarters.

78
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,250
That left no room for error.

79
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,875
But we still couldn't let
their plan come to fruition.

80
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,583
Our only hope to stop
it from happening

81
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,500
was to wait until today.

82
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,000
That's right.

83
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,958
The day all the branches will
be gathered in one place.

84
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:16,166
Before they kill anyone,
we'll destroy them.

85
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,833
Hey, Lucy. Sorry about all
that stuff I said earlier.

86
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,166
But I knew they were watching me

87
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,041
and I couldn't risk blowing
my cover right then.

88
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,500
It's fine.

89
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:28,125
I guess I should apologize
for slapping you like that.

90
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:31,541
Well, the maid outfit made it
a little better, to be honest.

91
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,333
I'm not so sure I needed
to know that part.

92
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,291
[GRAY] You guys are
my friends for life,

93
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,291
and nothin's ever
gonna change that.

94
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,583
I feel the same way!

95
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,875
That makes things
a whole lot easier!

96
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,958
We can wreck their
stupid plan in no time

97
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,375
if all of us work together!

98
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:50,750
Right!

99
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,333
I'm totally in it to win it!

100
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,916
You sure about that?

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,083
It wasn't our intention to drag
you into the fight with us.

102
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,666
If you weren't gonna
drag us into it,

103
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,541
then we just have to drag you!

104
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:03,916
It's been way too long

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,666
since Fairy Tail's strongest
team kicked some butts!

106
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,666
There's only one thing to say
at a time like this, right?

107
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,208
[ALL]
I'm fired up now!

108
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:33,375
Gray and Gomon aren't here
with us. Why is that?

109
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,541
They're dealing with
the prisoners?

110
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:39,500
That makes sense for Gomon.
But what about Gray?

111
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,500
It's fishy.

112
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,708
[BRIAR]
Calm down, Bottom Lashes.

113
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,083
Because at this point,
none of it matters.

114
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,375

"Bottom Lashes"?

115
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,791
[BRIAR] Look, do you see
what's happening here?

116
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,375
Every member of every
secret branch in Fiore

117
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,625
has gathered together for
the Purification Plan.

118
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,958
So even if the stripping
iceman or the council

119
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,375
decides to try to stop us,

120
00:06:58,458 --> 00:06:59,958
they wouldn't have
a snowball's chance

true believers.

Yes. Very good point.

123

[JEROME] I could live
with "Bottom Lashes."

The purity of the

will prove to be irresistible
for our Dark Lord Zeref!

Fullbuster! I knew it!

163
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,333
These infidels will not hinder
our plan for purification!

164
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,416
Let us dispose of them!

165
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,750
I'm sorry, sir,

166
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,583
but the enemy is attacking
from the rear as well!

167
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,458
We're losing soldiers
as we speak!

168
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:41,166
Say what? The Council's
army is already here?

Uh, not exactly, sir.

Aw, yeah!

173
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,083
Been a while since we've
had this kinda party!

174
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:55,333
We're gonna have
to do it up right.

175
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,708
This really brings back
some memories, huh?

176
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,458
Aye!

177
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:03,375
You want purification?
We'll start with you!

You don't have to worry
about little ol' me!

'Cause in this outfit....

WTF? They're animals!

198
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:42,375
They're super scary
creatures! Like monsters!

199
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,625
No offense, but you need
to do some serious work

200
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,166
to strengthen your vocabulary.

201
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,333
I suppose this means we'll have
to purify them ourselves.

202
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:53,041
[JEROME] Allow me to handle the
enemy attacking from the rear.

203
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:56,000
The traitor and his
friends are all yours.

204
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,625
[BRIAR] Yes, that sounds
like a perfect plan to me.

205
00:11:58,708 --> 00:11:59,875
It's time these sewer rats

206
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,958
learned the true
horrors of black magic.

207
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,791
This lone fighter is fearsome.

208
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,416
A worthy opponent.

209
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,250
However, this dark sword I wield
was forged in forbidden magic.

210
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,750
And with this blade,
I shall end them.

211

a taste of our magic power!

[AVATAR C]
Her swords can fly!

It's like they have a
mind of their own!

Do you still intend to fight me?

Yeah, Jerome is here!

No wizard stands a chance
against the Dark Sword!

My Dark Sword's magic energy
corrodes everything it strikes.

Be it steel or flesh.

You... You played us for fools!

00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,666
All this time you spent with
us was a lie, wasn't it?

00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,166
Yeah, of course
it was, you idiot!

236
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,083
I'm not the kinda guy
who would associate

237

with a bunch of
murderers like you!

238

It's purification! Not murder!

And once it's been completed,
Zeref will be among us again!

about the Book of E.N.D.,

I hate to disappoint ya,
but that stuff was mostly true!

Someday, I will destroy E.N.D.

And when I do, it's
gonna be on my terms.

You should probably know
that my Virus magic

can target any part of your
body I feel like messing with.

Like, if I wanted to,

I could scramble your

"Lucy Gut Punch." Heh.

305
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,625
I think the most amazing
part about all of that

306
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,416
was your timing, Wendy.

307
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,125
Yeah, how come you two
just showed up here, anyway?

If there's one thing
I can't stand, it's a rat!

Hear me?

There's your split-image magic.
I was waitin' for that trick.

312
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,250
I am "Angry Briar!"

And I am "Smiling Briar."

I'm "Sorrowful Briar."

315

And I'm simply "Loving Briar."

00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,208
I've never been so
furious in my life!

317
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,125
I find it so funny.

318
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,208
If you think you can beat
us with such weak power,

319
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,208
you must be joking.

It makes me sad. You're so cold.

321
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,416
You've left me with no
other choice but to kill you.

322
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,750
Too bad.

323
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,125
You know, Gray,
I actually let myself

324
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,958
fall a teensy little
bit in love with you.

325
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,791
Say wha--?

326
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,416
[JUVIA] I knew I sensed
the familiar threat

327
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,875
of another woman
trying to steal my man.

328
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,250
[GRAY yelps]

329
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:56,875
What the heck are you
doing all the way out here?

330
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:00,083
I'm giving this floozy the
Water Claw that she deserves!

331
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,208
Owie!

332
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,625
You'll wish you never
hurt Loving Briar!

333
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,833
[laughs]

334
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,666
So cruel, it's
breaking my heart!

335
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,666
[growls]

336
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,750
You're all pissing me off!

337
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,250
I think you need to chill out!

338
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,583
No way!

339
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:19,875
I can't believe that ice
wizard took out Briar

340
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,500
like it was nothing!

341
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,541
I've been dreaming of you, Gray!

342
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,208
[giggles]

343
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:31,250
It's been so lonely!

344
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,041
My intuition told me you were
in some serious trouble,

345
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,500
so I rushed here as quickly
as I possibly could!

346
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:40,375
[GRAY] I wouldn't consider
this trouble, exactly.

347
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,375
How did you know where I was?

348
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,458
Because of Wendy and her
strong sense of smell.

349
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,583
[GRAY]
Look, I'm sorry.

350
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,875
I promise I'll explain
everything later, but now...

351
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,625
[JUVIA]
I know.

352
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,500
...we gotta deal
with these losers.

353
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,875
Of course. Anything for you!

354
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:05,500
Well, sure seems like Juvia's
back to her old self again.

355
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,375
All thanks to Wendy, that is.

356
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,958
Oh, stop.

357
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,625
Thank you, Wendy!

358
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:12,958
[TAURUS]
Sorry, ladies,

359
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,916
but there's a stampede of
bad guys comin' our way!

360
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,875
So we all gotta moo-ve!

361
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:17,875
I'm on it!

362
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,541
Let's go!

363
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,708
[WENDY]
Sky Dragon Wave Wind!

364
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:29,250
[AVATAR screaming]

365
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,291
Is that Dragon Force?

366
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:34,666
We did a little
training of our own!

367
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,500
She's the coolest ever!

368
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:41,541
[AVATAR yelling]

369
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,208
The rear forces have been

370
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,416
completely eradicated,
Your Eminence.

371
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,000
And the vanguard can't
advance any farther!

372
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:12,458
These foes... the magic they
use... it's just too strong.

373
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,541
We'll never defeat them!

374
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,500
The enemy's come
to finish us off!

375
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,625
Ah! This can't be real!

376
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,166
We have over 2,000
fighters on our side!

377
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,833
Yeah, that's true. And there's
only a handful of them!

378
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,958
[NATSU]
Doesn't matter how many you got.

379
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,166
The odds are against you.

380
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:48,291
'Cause chumps like you'll never
beat Fairy Tail wizards.

381
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:53,500
[ARLOCK] This is all within
the realm of expectations.

382
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:56,375
And when Iksatsunagi
begins to tremble

383
00:21:56,458 --> 00:22:00,208
the ground beneath us,
the purification will begin.

384
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,958
Oh, yeah?

385
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:05,166
How about I make you
tremble instead?

386
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,291
[LUCY] Arlock, the high
priest of Avatar,

387
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,333
summons the
fearsome Iksatsunagi,

388
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,750
god of war and calamity,
to the battlefield.

389
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,083
And once he's arrived,

390
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:47,916
the real Purification Plan
will come to fruition.

391
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,708
The people flee in
terror at the sight

392
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,833
of the war god's
overwhelming power.

393
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:55,250
Enraged by Arlock's complete
disregard for human life,

394
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,500
Natsu thinks of his friends

395
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:59,750
and summons a fiery
attack like only he can!

396
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:02,083
Next Time: "Ikusatsunagi."

397
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:05,500
The strength of those bonds
will set evil ablaze!
