when she decided to go up
against a legit demon.

Don't mind her. She's
just the grumpy type.

in with everyone else, though.

be a monster or a demon,
then so be it!

161
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,791
[MIRAJANE yells]

162
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,041
[MIRAJANE]
If I could just take one part!

163
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:35,041
What is this? Let go!

164
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,208
[SEILAH]
That weakness I just felt...

165
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,125
[SEILAH] Was her take over
spell working on me?

166
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,166
Impossible, I'm an Etherious!

167
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,041
[SEILAH] I'm done playing
around with her.

168
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:55,291
It's too dangerous
to let her live!

169
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,125
[SEILAH growls]

170
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,125
Mira, no!

171
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:04,208
[MIRAJANE] I still believe in
my power, no matter the odds.

172
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:07,833
I know I can protect
the ones I love.

173
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:14,416
[SEILAH]
Ah! Demon Eye. Release!

174
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,625
Mira!

175
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,791
This is the good part!

176
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,916
Now die!

177
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,458
[MIRAJANE]
This Macro curse....

178
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,416
Once you've controlled
someone with it,

179
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,208
you can do it anytime you want.

180
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,333
That's what you told me.

181
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:34,250
[SEILAH] Is this why I felt
that weakness before?

182
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:38,416
Was she able to take control
of just my curse power?

183
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,083
I gave an order.
Let's see if it works.

184
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,583
[SEILAH]
It's pointless, you fool!

185
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,416
I'm the only one who
can give myself orders!

186
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,083
[MIRAJANE] I never said
that I gave it to you...

187
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,833
Elfman...

188
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,208
[MIRAJANE]
Come here. I need your help.

189

--[ELFMAN growls]

190
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,791
[SEILAH groaning]

191
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,875
He's really here!

192
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,583
[SEILAH gasping]

193
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,125
[LUMMY]
Wasted.

194
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:15,708
A real man protects his family!

195
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,416
[KYOKA] Lord Mard Geer,
I come bearing bad news.

196
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,958
It seems we underestimated
our enemy.

197
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,875
The Face plan has failed,

198
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:41,875
and Ezel and Franmalth
have been wiped out.

199
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,791
Add Seilah and Hell's Core
to that list.

200
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,916
Really?

201
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,041
We must summon our master, now.

202
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,083
I'm afraid that we cannot.

203
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,333
[KYOKA gasps]

204
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,958
[MARD GEER] There is a
considerable obstruction

205
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:57,166
to that goal currently
existing in this world.

206
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,666
I'm talking about magic power.

207
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,416
In order to revive him,
it must be eradicated.

208
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,375
That's what we were
trying to achieve

209
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,000
with our plan to detonate
Face, but it failed.

210
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,958
How I pity you, Kyoka.

211
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,708
[KYOKA]
Mm?

212
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:11,791
[MARD GEER]
You've never been able

213
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,958
to see the big
picture, have you?

214
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,750
Face was just a speck.

215
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,250
Was what?

216
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,958
[MARD GEER] A miniscule point
in a much larger tapestry.

217
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:24,375
The range of which a strategist
such as I can see clearly.

218
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,958
In the grand scheme of things,

219
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:29,416
Face's failure is another
small point among many.

220
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,458
It's nothing worth our worry.

221
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:32,791
I'm confident in time,

222
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,208
the world's magic power
shall cease to exist.

223
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,083
But how can you be so sure?

224
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:40,583
Kyoka, tell me what we are.

225
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,958
We are Zeref's demons.
Etherious.

226
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,583
What is our goal?

227
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:48,291
[KYOKA] Our primary goals
are to revive master E.N.D.

228
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,291
and return to Zeref.

229
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,958
[MARD GEER]
And what are humans?

230
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,208
[KYOKA]
Vile and disgusting creatures.

231
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:03,041
[KYOKA screams, gasping]

232
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,083
Lord Mard Geer! Why are you...?

233
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,583
[gasping]

234
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,833
[MARD GEER] You brought
humans to our fortress,

235
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,791
and made them your playthings.

236
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,250
[KYOKA]
I tortured them...

237
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:18,208
To extract information
about Face. [groans]

238
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,125
This fondness you
have for humans.

239
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,833
It will be your undoing.

240
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,916
[KYOKA]
No, that's not true.

241
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,666
[MARD GEER]
This behavior displeases me.

242
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,875
I simply cannot abide
my subordinate

243
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,458
playing with such
lowly creatures.

244
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:38,666
And thus, you must be
punished for your crime.

245
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,916
Which is not playing
with humans.

246
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,125
But displeasing me, the
Lord of the Underworld.

247
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:48,958
I understand my lord.
Thank you for the lesson.

248
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,666
Those detestable humans.

249
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,208
[KYOKA screams]

250
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:56,166
Their ineffective actions do not
concern me in the slightest.

251
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,750
But the thought of them
in my home disgusts me.

252
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:04,416
Perhaps this calls for Alegria.

253
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:09,500
[LUCY]
Hold on a sec.

254
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,291
I think Gray is getting into it

255
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,000
with one of the
enemies back there.

256
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,333
I'm pretty sure that I can smell
Mirajane somewhere nearby.

You startled me!

[ERZA] I hear you!
Has something happened?

263
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,916
We've found Mira!
She's safe and sound!

I'm sorry to worry
you. I'm fine now.

Lisanna are with us, too!

That's a relief!
Oh, Warren, hey!

268
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,666
Can you make it so everybody can
hear me through your telepathy?

Yeah, sure. Just
hang on a second.

Wendy and Carla pulled it off!

it, but they stopped Face!

[LUCY] There's something else
we need to tell you about.

00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,458
Can Master hear me?
I have a message.

Sure Happy. I'll put
you right through.

278

[HAPPY] We talked to
the soul of Master Hades!

What?!

280

His soul? That's weird.

281
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:10,833
What did he tell you?

282
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,875
He said that even though
we stopped Face,

283
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,708
it's not over. He gave
us a message for master.

284
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,666
I don't understand what
it all means, but he told us

285
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,041
that Master has to
"unleash the light".

286
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,541
To do what?

287
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:26,708
[gasps] He's talking about
The Lumen Histoire!

288

He can't be serious!

Ah! Please don't
shout like that!

290
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,666
Well, he seemed pretty
dang serious to me.

00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:57,750
[BOTH grunting]

318
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,833
[LUCY] Help, Natsu!
I'm being pulled in!

319
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:00,750
[NATSU]
Grab my hand!

320
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,541
[LUCY]
I'm trying!

321
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,875
[BOTH grunting]

322
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,166
[LUCY]
Come on!

323
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,916
[BOTH scream]

324
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,416
[GRAY screams]

325
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,833
[ERZA grunts]
What is all of this?

326
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,708
[MINERVA (NEO)]
Perfect! Now I've got you!

327
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,250
No! Never!

328
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,250
[ELFMAN]
Hold on to me!

329
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,333
[LISANNA]
I am!

330
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,000
[JET]
This stuff is pullin' me down!

331
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,791
[HAPPY]
Someone, help me!

332
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:28,458
Lord Mard Geer...
The... Alegria.

333
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,666
It will kill our own soldiers!

334
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,041
Consume everything.

335
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,083
[SOLDIERS groaning]

336
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,041
[MARD GEER]
Sacrifice.

337
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:41,791
[SOLDIERS groaning]

338
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,625
[ALL groaning]

339
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,625
[GAJEEL, PANTHERLILY grunting]

340
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,875
Stop this! She's mine!

341
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,708
Damn you, Tartaros!

342
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,875
You promised me
that I could kill her!

343
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,875
Lucy!

344
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,583
[MARD GEER]
We are bearing witness

345
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,625
to the endless cycle
of death and rebirth.

346
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:06,625
Those foolish humans were doomed
once they set foot in here.

347
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:14,041
This cube is a prison, from
which escape is impossible.

348
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:17,541
They're forever sealed
inside the Plutogrim!

349
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,083
[KEYES chuckles]

350
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:41,208
[SILVER] Alegria, the word may
mean happiness to some people,

351
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:44,333
but to me it's something
different entirely.

352
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:48,250
It just means that our
paths will never cross.

353
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,166
Magic power?

354
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,833
[gasps]

355
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,708
[gasps]

356
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:08,625
The Alegria swallowed
up many lives just now.

357
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:12,125
But one seems to've
avoided its grasp.

358
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,166
[LUCY grunts]
Ow!

359
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,666
[LUCY]
What is all this?

360
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,916
It looks like some
kind of tissue.

361
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,750
The chance of surviving
that curse is less than one

362
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:30,250
in a billion. What fortune.

363
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:31,958
Tragic.

364
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:36,291
One solitary human soul left
to suffer in the underworld.

365
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,583
[LUCY]
So I'm the only one left

366
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,666
after the Underworld
King's curse.

367
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,541
But I'm not gonna
give up on my friends!

368
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:21,541
No matter how many of these
demons I've gotta fight off!

369
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:23,125
My celestial spirits and I

370
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:25,041
will do whatever it takes
to get everyone back

371
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:27,708
and to save the world from
losing its magic power.

372
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:29,125
My back is to the wall,

373
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:31,166
and I might have to
make some hard choices,

374
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,125
but nothing is
gonna stop me!

375
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:38,166
Next Time: "Tartaros Chapter
A Strike from the Stars"

376
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,458
The celestial light will
shine though the darkness!
