1
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,500
- ( all whimpering )

2
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,875
- WHAT IS THIS?

3
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,958
IF YOU'VE BETRAYED FAIRY TAIL,

4
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,541
THERE'D BETTER
BE A GOOD REASON FOR IT.

5
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,083
- I'M SORRY.

6
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,458
I DON'T HAVE ANY REASON.

7
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,125
- BUT, GRAY--
- WHAT NOW?

8
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:49,708
- ( theme music playing )

9
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:06,083
- ( singing in Japanese )

10
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,250
- Daphne: YES YES YES.

11
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,458
AFTER COUNTLESS HOURS OF BLOOD,
SWEAT, AND TEARS,

12
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,333
I'VE PRODUCED THIS WONDER
OF SCIENCE-- THE DRAGONOID!

13
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,083
IF YOU HAD ANY KIND OF MANNERS,

14
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,708
YOU'D AT LEAST CONGRATULATE ME
ON A JOB WELL DONE.

15
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:30,041
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MADNESS?

16
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:32,458
RELEASE NATSU NOW OR ELSE!

17
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,250
- SORRY, BUT FIRE BOY
STAYS RIGHT WHERE HE IS.

18
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,333
THE DRAGONOID IS USING HIM
AS A BATTERY, AFTER ALL,

19
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:41,291
SO I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF LETTING HIM GO.

20
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,333
- ( grunting )

21
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:46,041
THIS THING'S GONNA SUCK UP
EVERY LAST DROP OF MY POWER.

22
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:52,125
- ( Happy speaking )

23
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,500
- HMM. YOU MIGHT AS WELL
SAY YOUR GOODBYES

24
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,041
WHILE YOU HAVE THE CHANCE.

25
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,458
NATSU DRAGNEEL
WON'T BE AROUND MUCH LONGER.

26
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,333
- MAGIC POWER'S LIFE
TO A WIZARD.

27
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,416
WE HAVE TO STOP HER
BEFORE SHE DRAINS HIM.

28
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,416
- YOU MESSED
WITH THE WRONG GUILD, LADY.

29
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,916
- WHAT DO WE DO?

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,083
IF THIS KEEPS UP,
NATSU'S DONE FOR.

31
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,625
- AHHH!
SCREW THIS!

32
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,208
AHHHH!

33
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,125
- YES YES, GOOD WORK, BOY.

34
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:21,500
USE THAT ENERGY OF YOURS
FOR SOMETHING WORTHWHILE.

35
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:24,000
THINGS ARE GOING
JUST AS PLANNED.

36
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,875
MY DRAGONOID
WILL SOON BE CHARGED

37
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,125
AND THEN I'LL SHOW THE WORLD
WHAT TRUE POWER IS.

38
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,000
- AHHHH!

39
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:33,083
- Gray: IF YOU WANT TO TRY
AND STOP US, BE MY GUEST.

40
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:36,125
THEN AGAIN, CONSIDERING HOW
PATHETICALLY WEAK YOU ALL ARE,

41
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:39,250
I DOUBT YOU'LL SURVIVE TO SEE
THE DRAGONOID'S FULL GLORY.

42
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,416
- HOW COULD YOU?

43
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,291
- I SEEM TO RECALL HEARING
ABOUT A DERANGED FEMALE WIZARD

44
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,791
WHO WAS OBSESSED WITH DRAGONS

45
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,708
AND EVEN TRIED
CREATING ARTIFICIAL ONES.

46
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,416
BUT I THOUGHT
IT WAS JUST A RUMOR.

47
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,333
- THAT SURE SOUNDS LIKE HER.

48
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,333
- OH, NOW THAT'S JUST INSULTING.
I'M FAR FROM DERANGED.

49
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,708
BY THIS TIME TOMORROW,

50
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,625
THE ACADEMIC WORLD
WILL SPEAK MY NAME

51
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,583
WITH EXALTED PRAISE
AND UTTER FEAR,

52
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,833
THANKS TO MY GLORIOUS DRAGON.

53
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,833
- WAIT, IF THIS COPY CAT
IS FULLY ARTIFICIAL,

54
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,125
THEN IT MIGHT EXPLAIN
THOSE WEIRD DRAGON EGGS

55
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,875
I FOUND WHEN I WAS A KID.

56
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,041
- HA! THE ROAD'S BEEN LONG
AND FILLED WITH OBSTACLES,

57
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:16,291
BUT I OVERCAME
EACH ONE BRILLIANTLY.

58
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:19,750
THE FIRST STEP
WAS NO SMALL FEAT.

59
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,583
I HAD TO SUCCESSFULLY
INCUBATE ARTIFICIAL DRAGON EGGS

60
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,166
AND HAVE THE YOUNG SURVIVE. 
- ( growling )

61
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,041
- THEN I NEEDED TEST SUBJECTS.

62
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,666
LUCKILY, MY HOME TOWN
HAD PLENTY TO SPARE.

63
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,833
BUT, LIKE ME, EVERYONE THERE
USED HIDDEN MAGIC.

64
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:37,000
SO THEY ALL ESCAPED BEFORE MY
DRAGONS COULD REACH THEM.

65
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,208
SINCE I NO LONGER
HAD ANY TEST SUBJECTS,

66
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,791
I COULDN'T COLLECT ANY DATA
AND THE EXPERIMENT WAS RUINED.

67
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:45,125
WHERE'D EVERYONE GO?

68
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,750
SINCE YOU ALL LOVE
PLAYING HIDE AND SEEK SO MUCH,

69
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:51,583
YOU CAN PLAY IT
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIVES.

70
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,708
- ( all screaming )

71
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,041
- I SEALED THEM
WITHIN THEIR OWN SPELLS,

72
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,583
TRAPPING THEM FOREVER.

73
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:03,083
THE DRAGONOIDS
SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SENSE

74
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,625
THE HIDDEN TOWNSFOLK,
BUT THEY WERE DEFECTIVE.

75
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:09,000
SO I IMMEDIATELY DISPOSED OF
THEM AND STARTED FROM SCRATCH.

76
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,250
- ( all growling )

77
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:21,708
- Natsu: I GUESS THAT MEANS I
CAME INTO TOWN RIGHT BEHIND HER.

78
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,625
- DON'T LEAVE!
I WANNA COME WITH YOU.

79
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,666
IGNEEL, PLEASE WAIT.

80
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,208
DON'T GO!

81
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:35,125
- Daphne: THEN I TURNED MY BACK
ON THAT MISERABLE PLACE.

82
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,333
- IGNEEL!

83
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:41,750
WHY WON'T YOU ANSWER ME?
IGNEEL!

84
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,833
- Daphne: EVENTUALLY, THE TOWN
CAME TO BE KNOWN

85
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,666
AS THE CITY WITHOUT SOUND.

86
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,708
AFTER YEARS
OF CONTINUOUS RESEARCH,

87
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,833
I FOUND THE SOLUTION
TO MY PROBLEM.

88
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,791
IN ORDER FOR THE DRAGONOID
TO WORK PROPERLY,

89
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,541
I NEEDED THE POWER
OF A DRAGON SLAYER.

90
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,125
YES YES YES. NOW THAT
YOU'RE HERE, SALAMANDER,

91
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,958
I HAVE A TASK FOR YOU.

92
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,166
SURRENDER YOUR POWER
SO THAT MY DRAGONOID CAN LIVE!

93
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,208
DO MY BIDDING,
AND BURN, BABY, BURN!

94
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:17,125
- AHHHH!

95
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,083
- BY ALL THAT IS SACRED,

96
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,375
I SWEAR THAT DREADFUL WOMAN
WILL FEEL MY CLAWS.

97
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:25,000
- Lucy: THIS CHICK IS TOTALLY
INSANE. - Happy: AYE.

98
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:28,000
- TELL ME, DAPHNE,
WHY'D YOU CREATE THIS MONSTER?

99
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,500
SURELY NOT JUST FOR SHOW.
- MY MY MY.

100
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,833
YOU'VE GOT A KEEN MIND,
ERZA SCARLET.

101
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,500
MY AMBITION IS TO COMPLETE
THE ULTIMATE DRAGONOID.

102
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:38,458
BUT THIS BEAUTY
IS STILL JUST A PROTOTYPE.

103
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,666
AND FIELD TESTING IT
IS A REAL BLAST.

104
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,291
TESTING!  TESTING!

105
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,333
- ( all screaming )

106
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,666
- HMM, LEG CONTROLS
ARE LAGGING A BIT.

107
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,625
YES YES YES. I'LL DEFINITELY
HAVE TO FIX THAT

108
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:49,958
FOR THE NEXT UNIT.

109
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,541
- WHAT A PSYCHO.

110
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,583
IS SHE TRYING TO MAKE US
A PART OF HER EXPERIMENT?

111
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,208
- GIVE ME A MINUTE
AND I'LL WHIP UP

112
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,375
A NICE THICK HAIRBALL
WE CAN PUT IN HER SHOES.

113
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,000
- WE HAVE TO STOP HER
AT ANY COST.  UNDERSTOOD?

114
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,541
- BUT WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
TO NATSU

115
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,250
IF WE JUST START ATTACKING
THAT THING?

116
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,416
- IT'S UNFORTUNATE,

117
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,625
BUT SOMETIMES YOU
HAVE TO SACRIFICE.

118
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,500
- Wendy: DON'T SAY THAT!

119
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,958
- Erza: GRAY.

120
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,416
IS THIS TRULY WHAT YOU WANTED?

121
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,000
- ( crashing )

122
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:18,583
- YOU'VE GOT SOME EXPLAINING
TO DO!

123
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,291
- Wakaba: AND YOU BETTER HOPE
EVERYONE AT THE GUILD

124
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,875
LIKES YOUR ANSWERS!

125
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,875
- IF YOU WERE A REAL MAN, YOU'D
NEVER DOUBLE CROSS YOUR FRIENDS!

126
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,500
SORRY I HAD TO DO THIS,

127
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,958
BUT GRAMPS WANTS YOU
BACK AT THE GUILD.

128
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,416
- Erza: MASTER SENT YOU?
- YEAH.

129
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,458
WHEN HE GOT WORD OF
WHAT DAPHNE WAS UP TO,

130
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,041
HE TOLD US TO COME OUT HERE.

131
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,083
- HE SAID HE'LL DECIDE WHAT TO
DO ABOUT HER OVERSIZED LIZARD

132
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,916
ONCE HE GETS TO TALK
TO GRAY ONE ON ONE.

133
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,791
- ERZA!
THIS IS BAD.

134
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,291
I THINK BIG BOY OVER THERE
IS ABOUT TO--

135
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,125
- Lucy and Happy: FLY!

136
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,958
- NO ONE SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT IT FLYING!

137
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,125
- WHAT DID YOU THINK
THE WINGS WERE FOR?

138
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,083
- OH NO.

139
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:08,208
IF IT KEEPS GOING THAT WAY,
IT'LL HIT MAGNOLIA IN NO TIME.

140
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:11,458
- Erza: CURSE YOU.
- TRY TO STOP MY DRAGONOID

141
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,958
AND YOU'LL JUST END UP AS
ANOTHER STATISTIC

142
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,166
IN MY RESEARCH.

143
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,250
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,

144
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,000
I NEED YOU ALL TO RETURN
TO THE GUILD

145
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,541
AND GET READY FOR ACTION.

146
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,208
WE HAVE TO PROTECT MAGNOLIA,
NO MATTER WHAT.

147
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,625
- OKAY.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

148
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:30,625
- I'M GOING DRAGON HUNTING.
NOW QUIT WASTING TIME.

149
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,458
- THEN HAPPY HUNTING.

150
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,125
LET'S HEAD BACK TO THE GUILD.
- AYE, AYE, SIR!

151
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:39,541
- Erza: GRAY.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,166
I CAN'T WORRY
ABOUT THAT NOW.

153
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,333
I HAVE TO FOCUS
ON THE TASK AHEAD OF ME.

154
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:52,291
I'M GOING. THANKS FOR
THE RIDE. - SURE.

155
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,541
- WE'LL TAKE CARE OF GRAY
WHILE YOU GET NATSU BACK.

156
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:58,458
- FIGHT 'EM LIKE A REAL MAN.
- YOU CAN COUNT ON ME.

157
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,041
I'VE GOT YOU NOW!

158
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,583
WHERE'D HE COME FROM?

159
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,458
- YOU'VE MET
MY LIZARDMEN BEFORE, RIGHT?

160
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,458
- REQUIP!

161
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,583
IT COULDN'T BEAT ME BEFORE.

162
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,125
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
IT CAN THIS TIME?

163
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,250
YOU MAY COPY MY ABILITIES,

164
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,708
BUT WHAT YOU LACK
IS A WARRIOR'S SPIRIT!

165
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,625
 - Daphne: YES YES.

166
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,333
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

167
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,583
LET'S RUN A DIFFERENT TEST,
SHALL WE?

168
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,708
THANKS TO THE DATA COLLECTED
FROM YOUR PREVIOUS FIGHTS,

169
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,708
I WAS ABLE
TO IMPROVE THEIR DESIGN.

170
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:42,083
I WONDER HOW YOU'LL FARE
AGAINST THE LIZARDMEN 2.5?

171
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:46,416
SHOW ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT,
TITANIA!

172
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,250
- I TAKE IT WE GOT COMPANY?

173
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,541
- NEXT TIME I GET TO DRIVE.
- THIS IS A NEW ONE.

174
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,875
- Elfman:
THAT'S ONE UGLY ROAD BLOCK.

175
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,083
IT MUST BE ONE OF THOSE
LIZARDS ERZA MENTIONED.

176
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,875
- Macao: I BET YA THEY'RE HERE
TO TAKE GRAY BACK TO DAPHNE.

177
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,750
- Wakaba: EITHER THAT OR THEY'RE
GONNA BEAT THE CRAP OUTTA US.

178
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,750
- NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
LET'S FIGHT 'EM MAN-STYLE.

179
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,208
- YEAH, I'M DOWN.
- WE GOTTA MAKE IT QUICK.

180
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,250
- HERE THEY COME.
- LET'S DO THIS.

181
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,458
- COME GET POUNDED!

182
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:23,125
- GET TO FAIRY TAIL AS
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE!

183
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,666
- Wendy: THERE'S SHELTER
AT THE GUILD HALL.  THIS WAY!

184
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,458
- LOOK ALIVE, PEOPLE. FAKE
DRAGON DEAD AHEAD.

185
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,625
MAN, IT'S HUGE.

186
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,291
- I DON'T SUPPOSE
ANYONE'S FIGURED OUT

187
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,083
HOW WE'RE
GONNA BEAT THAT THING?

188
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,958
- CAN WE PROTECT THE GUILD HALL
AND TOWN AT THE SAME TIME?

189
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,750
- MASTER HAS
SOME KIND OF STRATEGY, RIGHT?

190
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,291
- HE WANTS TO WAIT TILL HE'S HAD
THE CHANCE TO TALK TO GRAY.

191
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,500
- WHAT GOOD'S THAT GONNA DO
WHEN WE DON'T EVEN KNOW

192
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,416
IF THE GUYS
WERE ABLE TO CAPTURE HIM?

193
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
WE CAN'T JUST SIT HERE
TWIDDLING OUR THUMBS.

194
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,458
- HURRY, BROTHER.

195
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:56,333
- AHHH!
THIS IS GOING NOWHERE FAST.

196
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,875
BEAST ARM IRON BULL!

197
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,208
- SMOKE CRUSH!

198
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,291
IT'S LIKE ERZA SAID,
THEY COPY OUR MAGIC.

199
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:12,416
I MIGHT BE
IN A LITTLE TROUBLE HERE.  AHH!

200
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,083
SORRY, GUYS.

201
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,708
GUESS I MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A BIT CARELESS.  LITTLE HELP?

202
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,666
- HANG ON, BUDDY!

203
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,083
- NICE TRY, BUT IT'S
NOT GONNA BE THAT EASY FOR YA.

204
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:39,208
- 'KAY.
THERE GOES MY BACK.

205
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:47,000
LISTEN, KID,
IF WE MAKE IT OUTTA THIS ALIVE,

206
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,750
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO HAVE A 'LIL
HEART TO HEART. YA GOT IT?

207
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,791
THINKIN' BACK, I CAN'T COUNT THE
NUMBER OF TIMES

208
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,500
NATSU'S SAVED MY SORRY HIDE,

209
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,291
EVEN WHEN I SCREWED UP A JOB.

210
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,875
I KNOW THE TWO OF YOU
BUTT HEADS A LOT,

211
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,708
BUT YOU GOTTA ADMIT HE'S ALWAYS
THERE WHEN YOU NEED HIM.

212
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,750
I JUST DON'T GET IT.

213
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,458
HOW COULD YOU
BETRAY HIM LIKE THIS?

214
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,791
ALL OF US!
AHHH!

215
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,333
- IF HE'S A REAL MAN,
THEN HE'LL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

216
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,583
FOR THE DISASTER
HE'S CAUSED HERE.

217
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,458
AND IF HE'S NOT,
WE'LL MAKE HIM.

218
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,333
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

219
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,666
I'M ENDING THIS NOW!

220
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,166
TIME FOR A TAKEOVER--
BEAST SOUL!

221
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,666
AHHHH!

222
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,125
- Daphne: YES YES YES!

223
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,333
MAGNOLIA IS QUITE BEAUTIFUL.

224
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,416
JUST THE THOUGHT OF RAZING IT
TO THE GROUND

225
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,083
IS ENOUGH TO SEND CHILLS
DOWN MY SPINE.

226
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,333
AND IF YOU CAN SURVIVE
MY LIZARDMEN,

227
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,416
YOU'LL HAVE A V.I.P. SEAT
FOR THE FIREWORKS.

228
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,375
BUT TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST,

229
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,500
I'M NOT EXPECTING YOU
TO BE AROUND FOR THE FINALE.

230
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:07,833
- Natsu: AW, COME ON.
WHY WON'T MY MUSCLES WORK?

231
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,916
- Man: NATSU!

232
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,666
NATSU, THE DRAGON SLAYER.

233
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,750
- THAT VOICE.

234
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,833
I FEEL
LIKE I'VE HEARD IT BEFORE.

235
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:20,458
- EXCUSE ME, LAD.

236
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,125
- HEY, JAR.

237
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,958
DID YOU
JUST SAY SOMETHING TO ME?

238
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,958
- ACTUALLY, THAT WAS ME.

239
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,333
I'M ONE OF THE DENIZENS
OF THIS FAIR CITY.  CHEERIO.

240
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,500
- BUT YOU'RE JUST A SHADOW,
AREN'T YOU?

241
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,333
- I ASSURE YOU,
I AM QUITE HUMAN,

242
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,250
AS ARE THE REST
OF MY FELLOW CITIZENS.

243
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,291
WE'VE BEEN OBSCURED
THROUGH HIDDEN MAGIC.

244
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,500
- 'KAY, THAT'S WEIRD.
WHAT, DO YOU GUYS

245
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,750
LIKE TO PLAY HIDE AND SEEK
ALL THE TIME OR SOMETHIN'?

246
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,791
- FAR FROM IT.
WE'RE STUCK THIS WAY.

247
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,833
THAT'S WHY
I'M REACHING OUT TO YOU.

248
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,958
ON THAT SUBJECT,
MAY I ASK WHO YOU ARE?

249
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,333
- WHO, ME?  I'M A WIZARD
FROM THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD.

250
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,875
AND MY NAME IS NATSU
THE DRAGON SLAYER.

251
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,791
- YOU'RE A DRAGON SLAYER?
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

252
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,083
- YOU THINK I'M LYING TO YOU,
OLD MAN?

253
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,083
THE GREAT NATSU
NEVER TELLS A LIE.

254
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,791
- NATSU.
NATSU THE DRAGON SLAYER,

255
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,916
I IMPLORE YOU, FREE US
FROM THIS TERRIBLE CURSE.

256
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,583
- WELL, I DON'T
HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DO.

257
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,333
I GUESS I'LL HELP YOU GUYS.

258
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,458
WHAT EXACTLY DO I HAVE TO DO
TO BREAK THE SPELL?

259
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,500
- DO AS YOUR TITLE SUGGESTS.

260
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,583
DEFEAT THE ONE
WHO CONTROLS DRAGONS.

261
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,791
- NOW I KNOW
YOU'RE A CRAZY OLD SHADOW.

262
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,916
DRAGONS CAN'T BE CONTROLLED
BY ANYONE.

263
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
THIS GUY'S ALL TALK.

264
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,000
BUT IF IT'LL FREE YOU, I GUESS
I CAN BEAT HIM UP AT LEAST.

265
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,416
- IS THAT A PROMISE
FROM THE GREAT NATSU?

266
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,958
- YEAH.
YOU BET IT IS.

267
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,500
- I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH.

268
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,291
ALL OUR HOPES GO WITH YOU,
YOUNG MAN.

269
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,833
WE'LL BE HERE WAITING.

270
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,750
WE WILL ALWAYS BE WAITING.

271
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,708
- WHAT THE-- HEY!

272
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:53,041
WHERE AM I SUPPOSED
TO FIND THIS GUY?

273
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,291
I'D ALWAYS THOUGHT I HAD
JUST DREAMT IT OR SOMETHING,

274
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,458
I COMPLETELY FORGOT
ABOUT IT TILL NOW.

275
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:02,166
GUESS I KNOW WHO "THE ONE
WHO CONTROLS DRAGONS" IS.

276
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,083
ALL RIGHT THEN.

277
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,708
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME KIND OF
WAY OUT OF THIS FREAKY PLACE.

278
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,875
AH, SCREW IT!
I'LL JUST FORCE MY WAY OUT!

279
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,541
- ( siren wailing )
- WHAT?  

280
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,833
HOW COULD HE POSSIBLY
BE PUTTING OUT THAT MUCH JUICE?

281
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,666
IT'S GONNA OVERLOAD.
- AHHH!

282
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,750
- I HAVE TO STOP HIM BEFORE

283
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,000
THE DRAGONOID'S STRUCTURAL
INTEGRITY FAILS.

284
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,833
- IS IT BREAKING DOWN?

285
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,916
- NATSU.

286
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,125
- AHHH!

287
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,916
YOU WON'T BEAT ME!

288
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,291
- I SEE, I SEE, YOU'RE TRYING
TO OVERWHELM THE SYSTEM

289
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,833
BY PUMPING THE POWER OUTPUT
TO 11.

290
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,291
AND WHILE
THAT'S VERY CLEVER, DRAGON-BOY,

291
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,375
IT WON'T BE ENOUGH
TO ESCAPE ME.

292
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,833
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS INCREASE
THE INPUT RATIO AND BAM!

293
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,583
THANKS FOR
YOUR CHARITABLE DONATION.

294
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:47,916
- OKAY, THAT DIDN'T WORK.

295
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,291
THIS IS GONNA BE HARDER
THAN I THOUGHT.

296
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:57,041
- MIRAJANE, ELFMAN AND
THE OTHERS ARE BACK,

297
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,625
BUT THEY GOT ROUGHED UP
PRETTY BAD.

298
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,666
- ELFMAN!

299
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,625
- THE OTHER GUYS
NEED IMMEDIATE ATTENTION.

300
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,083
GET THEM INSIDE, QUICK.

301
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,875
- PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT I CAN DO TO HELP YOU.

302
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,958
- MIRA,
YOU HAVE TO SAVE NATSU.

303
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,541
I OWE IT TO HIM
AFTER EVERYTHING HE'S DONE.

304
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:16,000
BRING HIM HOME.

305
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:20,583
( crying )
I'M SO SORRY, LISANNA.

306
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:23,875
IT'S ALL MY FAULT
YOU'RE GONE.

307
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,916
MY LITTLE SISTER.

308
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,125
IF ONLY WE'D TAKEN YOU
WITH US, NATSU,

309
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,458
THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.
SHE'D STILL BE ALIVE!

310
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:32,750
- WOULD YOU SHUT UP?

311
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,000
ENOUGH WITH
THE BLUBBERING ALREADY.

312
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,625
DO YOU REALLY THINK LISANNA
WOULD WANT YOU

313
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,166
TO CARRY AROUND THAT GUILT?

314
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,416
HOW'S SHE SUPPOSED TO SMILE
IF HER BROTHER'S FEELING SAD?

315
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,625
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

316
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,500
- NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED,

317
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:49,958
SHE ALWAYS HAD A SMILE
ON HER FACE, REMEMBER?

318
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:54,125
EVEN AT THE VERY END,
SHE NEVER LOST HER SMILE.

319
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,791
IF SHE WERE HERE NOW,
I'M SURE SHE'D SAY,

320
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,833
"WHENEVER
YOU'RE FEELING DOWN,

321
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:04,708
THAT'S WHEN YOU NEED
TO SMILE THE MOST."

322
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:08,625
SO BUCK UP. SHOW HER
A SMILE, LIKE A REAL MAN.

323
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,208
- A REAL MAN.

324
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:21,750
- IT'LL BE OKAY.
NATSU IS AS GOOD AS SAVED.

325
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,791
- ( gasps )

326
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,125
- ELFMAN!

327
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,500
- DON'T WORRY.

328
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,375
I'LL HEAL HIM
WITH MY SKY MAGIC.

329
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,791
- THANK YOU, WENDY.

330
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,916
- WAKE UP! YOU DON'T GET
TO SLEEP THROUGH THIS.

331
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,291
WHY DON'T YOU ADMIRE
YOUR HANDIWORK, YOU TRAITOR?

332
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,333
YOU'RE PATHETIC!

333
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:43,000
- LEAVE HIM ALONE!
DON'T YOU DARE CALL HIM THAT.

334
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,750
MY BELOVED GRAY WOULD NEVER
TURN HIS BACK ON FAIRY TAIL.

335
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,583
WHAT HAPPENED TO HEARING
BOTH SIDES OF THE STORY

336
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,375
BEFORE YOU START
ACCUSING SOMEONE?

337
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,708
I HAVE FAITH IN HIM,
EVEN IF THE REST OF YOU DON'T.

338
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:55,000
I ALWAYS WILL.
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

339
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,708
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

340
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,208
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE ME
TO SEE GRAMPS, RIGHT?

341
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,666
I'M READY, UNLESS YOU WANNA
SIT AROUND AND CHAT SOME MORE.

342
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,416
- FINE.
START WALKING.

343
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,750
- MY TRIGGER
FINGER'S ITCHY,

344
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,625
SO DON'T GIVE ME A REASON
TO SCRATCH IT.

345
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,250
- ARE YOU OKAY?

346
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,750
- OH, GRAY.

347
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,125
- HOW IS HE?
- HE'S GONNA BE FINE NOW.

348
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:20,791
- ( sighs )
- WENDY!

349
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,875
- I'M OKAY.

350
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,583
BUT I MIGHT NEED HELP
GETTING TO OTHER PEOPLE

351
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,166
SO I CAN TREAT THEM TOO.

352
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,750
- DEFINITELY NOT. IF YOU KEEP
USING YOUR MAGIC TO HEAL OTHERS,

353
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,625
YOU RISK LOSING
YOUR OWN LIFE, CHILD.

354
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,250
- IF THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS,
SO BE IT.

355
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,083
- NO, I FORBID YOU!
- I'M NOT A BABY ANYMORE, CARLA.

356
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,708
I'M A FAIRY TAIL WIZARD,
SO I'LL ACT LIKE ONE,

357
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,333
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

358
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,875
- SUCH STUBBORNNESS.

359
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,791
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHERE YOU
GET IT. - ( both chuckle )

360
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,958
- WE'RE ALL FAIRY TAIL WIZARDS,

361
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,583
SO LET'S TAKE DOWN
THAT DRAGON AND RESCUE NATSU!

362
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,791
- IF WE WERE TRAPPED,

363
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,083
HE WOULDN'T WASTE ANY
TIME GETTING US OUT

364
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,125
AND CRUSHING
WHATEVER GOT IN THE WAY.

365
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,083
- HE'S HELPED EVERY SINGLE ONE
OF US OUT AT SOME POINT,

366
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,666
SO IT'S TIME TO PONY UP.

367
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,333
- YEAH, HE WAS THERE FOR US
WHEN PHANTOM STRUCK

368
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,000
AND HE'S ALWAYS FIGHTING
FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE IN.

369
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,166
- HE TAUGHT ME
I CAN DO ANYTHING IF I TRY.

370
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,166
I'VE GOT COURAGE
'CAUSE OF HIM.

371
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,750
- WE ALL DO.

372
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,000
THIS IS OUR CHANCE
TO PAY HIM BACK.

373
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,750
OKAY, GUYS,

374
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,625
LET'S WORK TOGETHER
AND BUST HIM OUTTA THERE.

375
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,958
- All: AYE!

376
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,458
- WHAT A TEAM!

377
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,916
- Makarov: NOT SO FAST!

378
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,250
- Lucy: MASTER.

379
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,916
- THE WELL-BEING OF BOTH
THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD

380
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,166
AND THE TOWN OF MAGNOLIA
ARE TIED TOGETHER.

381
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,375
PREVENTING MAGNOLIA'S
DESTRUCTION

382
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,958
TAKES PRIORITY
OVER EVERYTHING ELSE!

383
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,000
- BUT IF WE DO THAT,
WHAT'LL HAPPEN TO NATSU?

384
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,291
- WE CAN'T DESTROY IT
WHILE HE'S STILL INSIDE.

385
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,958
- I'LL MAKE THIS AS CLEAR
AS I POSSIBLY CAN.

386
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,000
AS FAIRY TAIL'S MASTER,

387
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,625
I ORDER YOU TO STOP
THE DRAGONOID

388
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,750
BEFORE IT CAN DESTROY THE TOWN.

389
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,750
THERE'S NO NEED TO
WORRY ABOUT NATSU.

390
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:51,875
HE'S AS TOUGH AS THEY COME.

391
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,625
IF ANYONE CAN SURVIVE THIS,
IT'S HIM.

392
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,708
- NATSU.

393
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,625
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE LYING DOWN ON THE JOB.

394
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,625
I'VE KNOWN YOU FAR TOO LONG
TO BELIEVE

395
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,583
THIS THING'S
ALREADY DONE YOU IN.

396
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,958
- THAT'S ERZA.

397
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,875
- WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN FIGHTERS.

398
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:18,291
WE NEVER WALKED AWAY
FROM OUR PROBLEMS.

399
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,958
WE CLENCHED OUR FISTS
AND FACED THEM HEAD ON.

400
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,166
IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR YOU,

401
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,791
I WOULD HAVE GIVEN UP
A LONG TIME AGO.

402
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:32,750
I REFUSE TO STAND BY
AND WATCH YOU GIVE UP.

403
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,125
I WON'T LOSE YOU.
I CAN'T.

404
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:38,166
WE'LL WALK AWAY
FROM THIS BATTLE TOGETHER.

405
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,833
( panting )
LET'S END THIS!

406
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,833
- AFRAID I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS.

407
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,125
YOU'VE RUN OUT OF TIME!

408
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,375
( Daphne laughing )

409
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:25,208
PREPARE TO BE CRUSHED,
ERZA SCARLET!

410
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,750
- Alzack: BLAST BULLET!
- Bisca: STINGER SHOT!

411
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:32,291
- Cana: CARD MAGIC--
EXPLOSIVE FLAME!

412
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,291
- Juvia: WATER SLICER!
- Max: SAND SPEAR!

413
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,250
- IT APPEARS
THE BATTLE HAS BEGUN.

414
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:42,875
NOW'S A GOOD TIME
TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF.

415
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:46,041
- I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY,

416
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,375
BUT I DIDN'T EXPECT THIS.

417
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,250
- WHAT DID YOU THINK
WAS GONNA HAPPEN?

418
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,750
ANSWER ME!

419
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,708
- LOOK, GRAMPS,

420
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,125
ONLY NATSU
CAN DEFEAT THAT THING.

421
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:59,500
AND HE'S RIGHT WHERE HE NEEDS TO
BE IF WE WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.

422
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,500
- Erza:
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT--

423
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,625
MASTER TOLD YOU
THAT DESTROYING THE DRAGONOID

424
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:06,916
SHOULD BE OUR TOP PRIORITY?
BUT WHAT ABOUT SAVING NATSU?

425
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,458
- Lucy: HE SAID HE'S TOUGH
ENOUGH TO SURVIVE THIS.

426
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,333
- I SEE.

427
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:14,291
NATSU, WE'VE BEEN ORDERED
BY MASTER MAKAROV

428
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,250
TO DESTROY THE DRAGONOID
BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY.

429
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,541
BUT BEFORE THAT, I NEED TO
KNOW WHAT YOU WANT US TO DO.

430
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,375
ANSWER ME.

431
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:25,625
- HA HA.
SURE.

432
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,250
IT'S ABOUT TIME
SOMEONE ASKED THAT.

433
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:30,875
- NATSU.
- NOW LISTEN UP.

434
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,375
I'M ONLY GONNA SAY THIS ONCE,

435
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:35,000
SO CLEAR THE GUNK
OUT OF YOUR EARS.

436
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:36,583
FORGET ABOUT ME!

437
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:39,958
DESTROY THIS THING,
NO MATTER WHAT!

438
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:43,916
- ( end theme playing )

439
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

440
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,958
- Happy: IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHERE YOU MAY BE.


441
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:18,208
WHENEVER THERE'S TROUBLE,
CALL US AND SEE.


442
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:21,000
- Natsu: FROM MONSTERS TO
LOVER'S SPATS, WE GUARANTEE--


443
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:23,583
- Happy: WE'LL SOLVE ALL YOUR
PROBLEMS MOST DEFINITELY.


444
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:26,416
- Natsu: LET US KNOW WHEN THE
TIMES GET TOUGH, AND I SWEAR IT.


445
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,250
- Happy: WE'LL ALL USE OUR
FISTS, ON EACH JOB WE INHERIT--


446
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,791
- Both: 'CAUSE THAT IS THE FAIRY
TAIL TRUE FIGHTING SPIRIT.


447
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:34,708
- ( Happy and Natsu speaking )

448
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:37,041
- Natsu: HEY, THAT WAS
PRETTY GOOD. - I DUNNO.

449
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:38,916
I'M NO POET, BUT YOUR
LINES GOT PRETTY WONKY

450
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,916
TOWARDS THE END THERE.

451
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,708
- WHAT?
THEY RHYMED, DIDN'T THEY?
