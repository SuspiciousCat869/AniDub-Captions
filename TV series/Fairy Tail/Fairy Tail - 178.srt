Very clever, Sixth Master.

3
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,500
[MAKAROV]
To be perfectly honest with you,

4
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:29,000
it was the only real choice
that I had...

5
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:31,750
There is a chance that winning
the games would get

6
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:35,208
our poor Lucy back through
more 'official' channels.

7
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:36,708
However...

8
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,625
In a situation like this,
we must explore every option...

9
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,291
We can't put all our eggs
in one basket.

10
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,625
Everybody is focused
on the games,

11
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:48,583
and we will cheer our fighters
on with gusto!

12
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:52,541
That's what the public
will be seeing.

13
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,291
But some of our most
capable wizards

14
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:57,625
will set out on a secret
rescue mission.

15
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:59,250
[MAVIS]
A two-pronged strategy...

16
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:00,916
Nicely done.

17
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:11,125

Godspeed my children!

They locked Lucy in a dungeon?!

21
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,125
[PANTHERLILY]
How many times has she

22
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,666
been roped in to something
like this?

23
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,250
[CARLA]
If we win the Grand Magic Games

24
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,083
we could ask the king
to free her.

25

[HAPPY] But leaving things
to chance isn't our style...!

strategy of storming

the pungent parfum our guild
is really made of!

tied for fourth place!

[PANTHERLILY] Rushing
in while everyone's distracted

69
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,708
by the games is smart,

covers all of the bases.

[CARLA] It may not
be iron clad

do on such short notice.

This plan will work.

84

get to see which guild

106
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,458
comes out on top.

'cause there's a special arena
for our final fight!

109
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,291
The entire city
of Crocus itself!

110
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,000
[YAJIMA] The teams
have already spread

111
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,958
throughout the battlefield
and are waiting on standby.

112

will rush through the city

battling any opposing guild
members they encounter!

114

Knocking out
or incapacitating

115
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,583
an opposing wizard will net
the victorious wizard's guild

116
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,375
one point on the board!

117
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,666
[YAJIMA] First, each
guild must elect one member

118
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,166
as its leader but there
is a catch to this rule...

119
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,041
[MATO] None of the other
guilds will know

120
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,208
who the opposing
team's leaders are!

121
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,166
[CHAPATI] Defeating a leader
is worth five points!

122
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,000
This means
it's theoretically possible

123
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,750
for each team to score
45 points!

124
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,583
Meaning that every guild
has a shot at winning the title!

125
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:44,833
[YAJIMA] Should
the teams work together,

126
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,750
or should they split up
to take the gold?

127
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:50,041
[MATO] Strategy
will be a key factor this round!

128
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,458
Listen...

129
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:55,208
We have to win this just in case
the rescue plan fails.

130

[ERZA]
Lucy is counting on all of us.

others can get her out of there.

reason we're fightin'.

Gajeel's right...

134

We're winnin' this thing for all
of our friends in Fairy Tail.

[LAXUS] It's the very least we
can do to thank them.

136

After seven years of heartache,

137
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,208
they deserve nothing
short of victory.

Wouldn't
you agree?

148
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,083
[YAJIMA]
Quite...

149
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,625
And most of our teams
have decided

150
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,833
to split up which should make
things interesting.

151

[MATO] Good luck
out there, punkins!

152

[CHAPATI]
Uh, oh!

153
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,250
It looks like even the
individually powerful members

154
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,333
of Sabertooth
have opted to split up!

155
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,500
Some of the other teams
have broken up

156
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,375
into groups of two or three...

157
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:57,291
Whose strategy will
carry them to the gold?!

159
00:07:59,208 --> 00:07:59,791
[OLGA]
What is it?

160
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,416
You sense something?

161
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,000
[RUFUS]
They're not moving.

162
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,541
Huh?

163
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,416
Uh... Huh?

164
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,916
What is going on?!

165
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,166
Hm?

166
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,333
[MAN B]
What gives?!

167
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,000
Move!

168
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,750
[CHAPATI]
I have no idea why, but...

169
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,708
the members of Fairy Tail
are just standing there

170
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,375
as if they're in a trance!

171
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,041
Get out there
and fight!

172
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,333
Ya Numbskulls!

173
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,791
[LISANNA] Do you know
what they're doing?

174
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,208
[CANA]
Why are you asking me?

175
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,583
They're not just gonna
come to you, ya know?!

176
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,875
Get the lead out, people!

177
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,458
[CROWD murmuring]

178
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,000
[CHAPATI] Well, while
Fairy Tail's sticking

179
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,833
to their bizarre strategy...

180

[NOVALI gasps]

181
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:37,958
[NOVALI]
Crap! Two of ya?

182
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,541
Just my luck!

183
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,333
[CHAPATI] The other combatants
have already found some targets!

184
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,416
[YUKA]
You attack...

185
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,791
and I will keep
his magic at bay...

186
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,083
Deal?

187
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,083
[TOBY growls]

188
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,625
You're leaving
him to me?!

189
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,375
Stop whining...

Wave Boost!

191
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,875
[YAJIMA]
Oh, he's blocked his magic!

192
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:54,875
[NOVALI]
What happened?!

193
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,000
My spells!

194
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:57,833
[NOVALI gasps]

[NOVALI]
Get Wild...

198
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,208
[CHAPATI]
The pain just keeps on coming

199
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,958
for the Quatro Puppy guild.

200
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,500
Lamia Scale scores one point

201
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,750
and takes sole control
of third place!

202
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,958
[HIBIKI] Ah... Just our luck,
running into some ladies.

203
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,500
[ARAÑA] That mean you'll be
chivalrous and lay down for us?

204
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,875
[REN] As gentlemen, we'll
kindly give you our all.

205
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,375
[EVE] No hard
feelings, okay?

206
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,125
Don't be so cocky!

[CROWD cheering]

210

[CHAPATI]
That hurt!

211
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,750
Araña and Beth of Mermaid Heel
were no match

212
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,041
for the boys from Blue Pegasus.

213
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,041
That little bout gave
them another two points,

214
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:37,083
bringing their total
to a whopping' 32!

215
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,291
The scores are dancing
up and down the board!

216
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:43,541
But the team from Fairy Tail
has yet to budge an inch!

217

[MACAO]
Are they takin' a nap?!

statues and throw a spell!

This is getting stupid...!

220
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,416
Move!

221
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,666
[CHAPATI]
Meanwhile, the carnage continues

222
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,250
as the Lamias hunt down
the Puppies one by one!

223
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,208
[JURA] What's the matter?
Done already?

224
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,625
[YEAGER]
So... Not wild.

225
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,041
[YAJIMA] If Laymia Scale
keeps this up

226
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,166
they'll be first place
in no time.

227
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,375
[MATO] They're up to 43 points!

Yowza!

229
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,416
They've got a Wizard Saint
on their side...

230
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,625
How's anyone supposed
to compete with that?

231
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,250
Yeah, the odds are
definitely stacked against us.

232
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,291
[YUKA] Jura and Lyon are making
this a breeze for us;

233
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,708
they should just give us
the win at this rate.

sure of yourselves.

[CHAPATI]
Uh-oh!

239
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,000
Toby and Yuka just ran straight

240
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,500
into a human wall
of drunken fury!

We can beat him!

Two-on-one, huh?

244
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,250
Hardly seems fair...

245
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:39,875
But that sort of thing
really gets my soul stirrin'!

246

[YUKA] Guess we'll
have to fight.

to go beddy-bye!

[CHAPATI]
It's Sting!

253
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,791
Sabertooth's Sting appears
out of the blue

254
00:10:55,875 --> 00:11:00,750
and trounces Quatro Puppy's
leader with overwhelming force!

255
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:04,291
That's another five
points for our reigning champs!

256
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,916
[MINERVA] This means
we're in the lead again;

257
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,750
just as it should be.

258
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,000
[CHAPATI]
What a comeback!

259
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,583
With one blow, Sabertooth

260
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:14,416
jumps to first place
with 49 points!

[MAKAROV groaning]

[YUKA]
You thief!

263
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,666
He was ours!

264
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,291
[TOBY] Let's take him out,
get a point,

265
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,000
and steal his socks
while we're at it!

266
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,208
I need a new chew-toy!

267
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,500
[TOBY]
Something bit me!

268
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,916
[BOTH grunting]

269
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,541
[CHAPATI] And the lovely
Kagura strikes like a viper...!

270
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,125
With Yuka and Toby
out of the way,

271
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:35,250
what sort of epic one-on-one
battle do we have in sto-ore...?

272
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,416
[MATO]
He vanished... Rats.

273
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,708
A wise choice...

274
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,625
Fighting her would
be pointless...

275
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,583
He would only waste
his magic power.

276
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,625
[MATO] Mermaid Heel
scores two points,

277
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,166
for a new total of 42!

278
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,708
[YAJIMA] Quatro Puppy's Rocker
is in quite a bind...

279
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:50,916
Like a true cat,

280
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,375
Millianna's grappled
her foe into submission.

281
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,375
[CHAPATI] That kitty
is truly top-dog!

282
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,750
Quatro is out!

283
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,291
Wow...!

284
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,541
I didn't expect Lamia and
Mermaid to catch up so quickly!

285
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:01,750
[YAJIMA]
Funny...

286
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,125
I'm sure Goldmine's thinking
the same thing.

287
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,833
[MATO]
That's Wild!

288
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,166
[CHAPATI] The scores keep
changing with dizzying speed!

289
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,916
Yet, Fairy Tail
still hasn't moved

290
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,916
from their starting point!

291
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,083
I don't get it!

292
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,958
What kinda messed up
strategy is this?!

293
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,583
[MAKAROV]
Are they mad?!

294
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:19,583
Or did they suddenly forget
Lucy's freedom is at stake?!

295
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,291
[MAVIS]
They didn't forget...

296
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,625
In fact, it's the very reason

297
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,375
that we must remain
calm and focused.

298
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,708
What?

299
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,333
[MAVIS] Over the course
of the tournament,

300
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,708
I've watched
our opponents closely.

301
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:35,375
I saw their strengths, spells,
and behavioral patterns,

302
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,125
and I committed them to memory.

303
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,625
With these factors in mind,

304
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,541
I ran through millions
of calculations

305
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,416
to find our strategy.

306
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,375
How many?

307
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,083
Millions...?
Crazy!

308
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,333
[MAVIS]
And so far...

309
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,291
all of my predictions
concerning the enemy's

310
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:51,041
strategies and casualties...

311
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,166
played out exactly
as I thought.

312
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,791
[MAKAROV grunts]

313
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,458
[MAVIS] I then gave
my battle plan to our team.

314
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:10,500
Leading my comrades
to guaranteed victory...

315
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,625
That's how a tactician
wages war.

316
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,333
[MAKAROV]
Wage war... you say?

317
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,583
Operation Fairy Stars...

318
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,291
Begin!

319
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,083
[ALL]
Roger!

320
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,333
[CHAPATI]
Finally!

321
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:26,125
The team from Fairy Tail
has sprung into action!

322
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,541
[CROWD cheering]

323
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,291
[MALE SOLDIER C]
Man, this is the pits...

324
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,916
I wasn't supposed
to be here today.

325
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,333
[MALE SOLDIER D]
Uh-- Halt!

326
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,583
What's your business here?

327
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,333
And... who are they?

328
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,875
[MALE SOLDIER E]
Intruders...

329
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,458
Probably here to spring the
Fairy Tail girl from her cell.

330
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,416
[MALE SOLDIER D]
A couple kids like them?

331
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,000
[MALE SOLDIER C] His Majesty
and the Defense Minister

332
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,291
are out on business.

333
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,541
[MALE SOLDIER D]
Eh, just lock 'em up

334
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,833
and we'll sort it out later.

335
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:51,708
Alright?

336
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,041
[MALE SOLDIER E]
Understood.

337
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:53,916
[MALE SOLDIER C]
Hey, buddy...

338
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,166
The prison cells are that way.

339
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,416
[MALE SOLDIER E]
Huh? Oh-- uh, right! Sorry!

340
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,916
All of these courtyards
are starting to look the same.

341
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,583
[MALE SOLDIER E laughing]

342
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:06,750
Great job, Mira!

343
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,083
[NATSU laughs]

344
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,208
[MIRAJANE giggles]

345
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,458
Aye!

346
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,625
[CARLA]
It's so stuffy...

347
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,875
[PANTHERLILY]
Let us out before we die!

348
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:15,875
[MALE SOLDIER A]
You won't find

349
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,333
a better chance
than this, Princess.

350
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,375
[HISUI]
Yes, I agree...

351
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,250
Make ready, Soldier...

352
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,500
And begin the
Eclipse Two project.

353
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,250
[CROWD cheering]

354
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,625
[MAVIS]
Everyone split up...

355
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,500
And proceed to your
designated coordinates.

356
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:37,000
Uh...

357
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,166
say what?

358
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,958
[JET] I was hoping
you could tell us that.

359
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,625
[DROY]
I'm lost.

360
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,250
[CHAPATI] Fairy Tail has hit
the streets of Crocus!

361
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,208
[YAJIMA] What crazy play
are these kids tryin' to pull?

362
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,750
[MATO]
I don't know...

363
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,541
But it'll be hard to rack up
points this late in the game!

364
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,791
They'll have to step it up!

365
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,166
[MAVIS]
Phase one...

366
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,666
There is a 97 percent chance

367
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,333
that Rufus will take
action at this time.

368
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,208
[RUFUS chuckling]
I see you...

369
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,458
You aren't the first to
underestimate my talent

370
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,208
for detection, and you
won't be the last.

371
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:14,541
I'll spare us a headache
and take you all out now.

372
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,541
Memory Make...

373
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,791
Night of Shooting Stars!

374
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,083
[light humming]

375
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,208
I know
that spell!

376
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,625
It's the same
one he used

377
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,583
to decimate his opponents
the first day!

378
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,583
[MATO]
Oh! Look at 'em sparkle!

379
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,041
You have a two-second
window of opportunity...

380
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:34,833
Evade them the moment
their light is overhead!

381
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:35,833
[ERZA grunts]

382
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:36,833
[JUVIA grunts]

383
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:37,625
[GAJEEL grunts]

384
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:38,958
[GRAY grunts]

385
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,250
Like we'd fall for
the same trick twice.

386
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,916
Laxus, on the other
hand, can block the move.

387
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,250
[MAVIS] They share
the same element.

388
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,375
[LAXUS grunts]

389
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,500
[thunder booming]

390
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,750
[LAXUS] Hey, that
actually feels kinda nice!

391
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:52,416
No!

392
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
He took it head-on!

393
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,958
He'll then become agitated

394
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,875
and unable to think straight.

395
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,041
[RUFUS grunts]

396
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,458
[MAVIS]
In this state of confusion,

397
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:03,250
there is a 68 percent
chance that he'll close in...

398
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:06,583
and engage one of our
team members...

399
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,000
And a 32 percent chance

400
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:11,000
he'll standby
at his current position.

401
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,541
Obviously, the latter
outcome will pose little threat

402
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,791
to our overall strategy.

403
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,000
What's gotten
into her...?

404
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,125
It's creepy!

405
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,291
No idea...

406
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,916
[LISANNA]
What's Operation Fairy Stars?

407
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,250
[CANA] All I got out
of it was that the first Master

408
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,916
is a serious
egg-head.

409
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,083
[MAVIS] As she heads
northwest, Erza will encounter

410
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,875
an opposing wizard
when she rounds a corner...

411

[JENNY gasps]

412
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,500
No, not her...

413
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,875
[ERZA] Looks like
the First Master was spot on.

414
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,333
[JENNY gasps]
Erza!

415
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,250
She's quite
formidable.

416
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,541
Strategic withdrawal!

417
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:43,458
[JENNY shrieks]

418
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,458
[MAVIS]
She'll eliminate her.

419
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,708
Owwwwwiiiieee!

420
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:50,458
[MAVIS] Gajeel will take out
an opponent to the south.

421
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,625
[EVE groans]

422
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,000
No one said anything
about an ambush...

423
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,708
Them's the breaks,
kid...

424
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,083
Now then...

425
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,541
[GAJEEL] We doin' this solo
or two-on-one?

426
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,375
Either way
suits me fine.

427
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,250
[REN]
Hibiki!

428
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,875
Get outta here.
I got this.

429
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:04,875
[HIBIKI]
YA Sure?!

430
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:05,666
I'm positive!

431
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,916
Just go!

432
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,875
[REN groans]

433
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,625
[GAJEEL chuckling]
You were sayin'?

434
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:10,708
[HIBIKI]
I don't understand!

435
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:11,916
Does Fairy Tail have a member

436
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,625
that can out-calculate
my Archive magic?!

437
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,583
[GRAY chuckles]
How did you guess?

438
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,500
No! Not the face!

439
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,166
[HIBIKI groans]

440
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,250
[MAVIS] Once Gray defeats
the opponent

441
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,666
who retreats toward
the fountain square...

442
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,500
His next destination
will be Point B-4.

443
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:28,375
[CHAPATI]
Incredible...!

444
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,041
Even though they lagged behind,

445
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:33,041
Fairy Tail is once again
in the running for first place!

446
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,958
[MATO] They're tearing
it up down there!

447
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,625
[CROWD cheering]

448
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:37,708
[JET] I don't know
how she did it,

449
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,166
but her strategy
is actually working!

450
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,541
[DROY laughing]
Never doubted her!

451
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,083
[MAVIS] Juvia will provide cover
and support from the rear...

452
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,625
Laxus should continue
toward F-8.

453
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,375
Erza will go to S-5...

454
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,916
There should be plenty
of targets to choose from.

455
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,833
Wow... So the rumors
are true...

456
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,500
She's
incredible...

457
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,083
[MAKAROV] Her deep understanding
of psychology and strategy

458
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,791
in battle earned her
countless victories.

459
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:07,583
That's why she was known
as The Fairy Tactician.

460
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:08,708
We're saved!

461
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,958
Not bad for a famous
healing wizard.

462
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,583
[LISANNA] I guess
it's easy to forget

463
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,125
that she founded Fairy Tail
when she looks like a child.

464
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,500
[CANA]
Don't forget that 'child'

465
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,458
has been six feet
under for a while.

466
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:20,791
[HIBIKI] We failed you,
Teacher...

467
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,708
Please,
forgive us...

468
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:23,583
[ICHIYA]
Man...

469
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,958
Leave it to me!

470
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,000
With one stroke,
I shall--

471
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,166
[ICHIYA groaning]

472
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,333
You were careless.

473
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,375
[CHAPATI]
The Wizard Saint strikes again!

474
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,458
He effortlessly defeats
the Pegasus leader

475
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:35,875
and scores five points!

476
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,458
[MATO]
Keep your eyes on Jura!

477
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:41,583
He's easily one of the strongest
fighters in the competition!

478
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:42,708
[LISLIE groaning]

479
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,125
[CHAPATI] So cute!
[SHELIA] Yes!

480
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,750
[CHAPATI] The adorable Shelia
sends Lislie packing,

481
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:50,166
netting Lamia Scale
a total of 45 points!

482
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,166
It's a three-way tie
for first, folks!

483
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,416
Now let's hear
it for sweet Shelly!

484
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,083
[YAJIMA]
Knock it off, would ya?

485
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,333
[CROWD laughing]

486
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,916
[CHAPATI]
Anyway... back to the action!

487
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,833
We currently have three teams
battling for the top spot.

488
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,708
Any thoughts on who's
gonna take the gold?

489
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:05,708
[YAJIMA]
Well...

490
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,416
not Blue Pegasus,
that's for sure.

491
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,000
[MATO] The numbers are getting
smaller by the second!

492
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,250
[MAVIS]
From this point

493
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,750
I expect the conflict
to be even more intense.

494
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:15,916
[CANA]
I got a question...

495
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,208
Jura...

496
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,416
You have a plan for taking
down that walking fort?

497
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,750
Honestly, I was wondering
the same thing.

498
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,541
I've put much thought into it...

499
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,166
but the solution
still evades me...

500
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,708
[MAVIS] That's how powerful
this Jura fellow is...

501
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,583
He's quite extraordinary.

502
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,333
[JURA] I took part in this
because the hag ordered me...

503
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,583
But I didn't expect
it to be so much fun.

504
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:48,625
[fire crackling]

505
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,125
[NATSU whispering]
Lucy.

506
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,791
[LUCY]
Huh?

507
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,000
[NATSU whispering]
Wake up!

508
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,083

[LUCY]
You're here...!

512
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,875
Boy am I glad
to see you three!

513
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,666
Now Let me out!

514
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,000
[NATSU]
Shh!

515
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,875
[LUCY muffled]
Oh, sorry...

516
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,625
[HAPPY] You slept
on this thing?!

517
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:07,875
Hey guys!

518
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,708
[CARLA] I'm glad to see
you're in good spirits!

519
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:10,916
[PANTHERLILY groans]

520
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,916
[YUKINO] But how did you
get past the guards?

521
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,083
My natural charisma!

522
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:20,708
[NATSU grunting]

523
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:21,458
[HAPPY] Awesome!
[PANTHERLILY] Nice!

524
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,125
[CARLA]
Good one!

525
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,666
[HAPPY groaning]

526
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,125
Typical.

527
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,250
[MIRAJANE]
Here!

528
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,416
I brought a change
of clothes for you.

529
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,916
[LUCY]
Now all I need's a bath.

530
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,375
[HAPPY]
Yuck! Yeah you do!

531
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,083
[WENDY] We brought extra food
if you're hungry.

532
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,291
[HAPPY]
You want some, Yukino?

533
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,958
[YUKINO]
I'm fine, thank you.

534
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:37,041
[MIRAJANE] No peeking!

535
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:37,958
Understood, Lily?

536
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,250
[PANTHERLILY]
I wasn't gonna!

537
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,375
Now we just
need to figure

538
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,125
a way out of this
hell hole.

539
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,625
If possible we should
find a route

540
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,583
that will keep us hidden
from the castle's sentry.

541
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:46,958
Hold your horses.

542
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,791
Those royal goons
still have all of my keys...!

543
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:49,708
It was Scar-nose!

544
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,375
I swear, as soon
as I find him,

545
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,625
he'll get a grand tour
of the celestial--

[NATSU]
What gives?!

[HAPPY]
The floor, dummy!

551
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,500
[WENDY]
Not again!

552
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,333
[LUCY] Can't a girl
change in peace?!

[NATSU]
Get... off...!

556
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,166
Heavy!

557
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,166
[WENDY]
Sorry...

558
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,375
I've been eating
more sweets lately.

559
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,500
That hurt...

560
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,041
[NATSU] Well this
place is creepy.

561
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,500
[HISUI] Welcome to your
permanent holding cell.

562
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,250
[NATSU]
Huh?

563
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,500
[LUCY]
Who's there?!

564
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,125
[HISUI] I hope you enjoyed
our special trap.

565
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:27,916
No!

566
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,500
Who'd enjoy
that?!

567
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:30,916
[HISUI]
Take a good look around...

568
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,750
This is the Palace of Perdition,
the city of death...

569
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:37,291
It's the last taste of
freedom for criminals.

570
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:41,625
To this day not a single
inmate has escaped from it.

571
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:45,458
I seriously doubt you'll fare
any better, you thieves.

572
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,916
[NATSU]
Who the hell are you?!

573
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,416
[HISUI] You are speaking
to Hisui E. Fiore,

574
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,458
Princess of the Fiore Kingdom!

575
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,458
[MIRAJANE] Then you're the
one who trapped us in here?

576
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,000
Why?

577
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,208
[NATSU]
I want a fair fight!

578
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,875
Where's the exit to this place?!

579
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:01,583
[PANTHERLILY]
Never mind the exit;

580
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,083
I don't even see the entrance.

581
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,083
[WENDY]
So... we're stuck here?!

582
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,250
[MALE SOLDIER A] You sure showed
those low-lives, Princess.

583
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,500
[MALE SOLDIER B]
Even with His Majesty's absence

584
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,250
you protected
the castle with ease!

585
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,541
[MALE SOLDIERS]
Hurrah!

586
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:12,833
Hurrah!

587
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,916
Long live Princess Hisui!

588
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,541
[CHAPATI] It's been one
breathtaking bout after another!

589
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:20,833
But I've got a feeling
that the best is yet to come!

[footsteps clacking]

591
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:26,166
The First Master told me that
you'd be hiding out in here...

592
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,083
[GRAY]
seems she was right.

593
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,250
[RUFUS]
How interesting. 

594
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,666
You had practically vanished
from my memory. 

595
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:35,708
Perhaps you'd care
to remind me who you are?

596
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:38,416
You're gonna have a hard
time forgetting me after this,

597
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,083
'cause I'm the guy
who's gonna knock you out.

598
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:14,458
[HAPPY] The last match
of the Grand Magic Games

599
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:16,375
is finally underway!

600
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:17,666
[NATSU]
Gray's up against the poet

601
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,083
with the silly hat again, right?

602
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,625
[HAPPY]
I hope he'll be okay...

603
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:22,875
Last time they fought,
it didn't end very well.

604
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:24,375
[NATSU]
Keep your chin up, pal!

605
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:26,833
Fairy Tail wizards never lose
to the same guy twice...!

606
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:27,916
Gray's got this.

607
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,291
[HAPPY]
Yeah, you're right...!

608
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:31,875
We gotta believe in our friends!

609
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:34,583
[BOTH]
Next time: Gray vs. Rufus!

610
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:35,458
[NATSU]
Yo, Gray!

611
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:36,833
If you lose to this guy again...

612
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:39,166
you buy all my lunches
for a month!

613
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,041
[HAPPY]
How's that even fair?!
