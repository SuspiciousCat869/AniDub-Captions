we can trust the words

I have my doubts.

Me too. But.

44

He did make an extremely
convincing argument.

45
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:07,208
Given his tarnished history,
we must proceed with caution.

Is this just another scheme?

There's simply no other choice.

Trusting him is
our only option now.

Yeah. Just about done.

They're safe. The Royal
Army is protecting them.

Aw, yeah! And that
means we can start to

55

let loose on
these stupid lizards!

we do first, master?

I'm not sure.
But it's clear...

60
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,250
we must do whatever
we can to neutralize them.

overwhelmed by fascination.

68

Laying eyes on a dragon
is a unique experience.

69

One that she will never
forget and will have

a profound impact
on her growth as a wizard.

I'll protect her. But she
should stay here for now.

I'll help you!
Miss Kagura! Join with us!

164
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,125
Let's go!

165
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,666
If we work together,
we can take this beast down!

166
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,791
[roars]

167
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,833
I shall draw
my Archenemy Blade.

168
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,333
And even though it may shatter,

169
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,791
my fighting spirit
will never be broken!

170
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,458
I am prepared
to use my full power!

171
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,541
In the sacred name
of my master Ur,

172
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,083
I will not give up!

173
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,041
[ALL grunt]

174
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,916
We're all counting
on you! Fight!

175
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,125
Give him every ounce
of strength you have!

176
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,416
We can't let that monster win!

177
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,500
[JURA, LYON, and KAGURA yell]

178

--[JURA and KAGURA groan]
--[LYON yells]

179
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,625
[ALL grunt]

180
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,500
[MILLIANNA] Meow!
That didn't hurt him at all!

181
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,375
What do we do?

182
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,375
Keep fighting! We cannot
afford to give up any ground!

183
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,791
It's up to us
to protect the city!

184
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,458
I would never dream
of surrendering!

185
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:44,666
[ZIRCONIS] Ooh. They are
really goin' at it aren't they?

186
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,458
You humans have
always been entertaining!

187
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,125
[laughs]

188
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,000
It's Zirconis.

189
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,000
This is crazy.
I could swear that he was

190
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,708
a ghost the last time that
we ran into him, wasn't he?

191
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,333
Yeah, and it seems
like he's just as much

192
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,208
of a loudmouth
in the flesh.

193
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,041
[ZIRCONIS]
Why are you so surprised?

194
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:05,416
I'm not the type to just
mindlessly destroy everything,

195
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,458
like some of
these other dragons.

196
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,041
I'm a great conversationalist.

197
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,083
Not to brag too much, but

198
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:15,166
I've always been a bit more
intellectual and sophisticated

199
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,875
than most of my brethren.

200
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,916
But you're all trembling,
completely frozen with fear.

201
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,666
I do strike terror
into your hearts, don't I?

202
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,083
If ya wanna run,
I reckon now's your chance.

203
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:29,250
That just means I'll have to
chase you down to eat ya!

204
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,458
Please, tell me something!

205
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,833
[ZIRCONIS] Ah. What is this?

206
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,958
You wanna have a chat
with me, little girl?

207
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,958
Why did you all come here?

208
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,291
Why are you destroying
our home like this?

209
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,916
[ZIRCONIS] Ya wanna know why?

210
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,583
To tell ya the truth,
that's who ya should be askin'.

211
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,333
Ya see Mother Glare
flyin' around up there?

212
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,375
Well, that guy
perched on top is the one

213
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,458
who's callin' all
the shots on this thing.

214
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,333
[WENDY] That's the Rogue who
came from the future, isn't it?

215
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,875
[ZIRCONIS]
Oh, don't get me wrong,

216
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,250
no human's gonna boss me around.

217
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:05,000
But this was a pretty fun idea,
so I went along with it.

218
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,500
[LUCY] I don't get it.
Why would he want these dragons

219
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,541
to destroy the world like this?

220
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,916
I mean, if they're
really able to do it,

221
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,666
then he won't have
anywhere to call home either.

222
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,125
[SERENA] Oh, Mister Doranbolt.

223
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,791
I've been expecting you, sir.

224
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,500
[DORANBOLT] You've told
no one about this, right?

225
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,750
[SERENA] Of course not.

226
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,250
[DORANBOLT] One-zero-zero-
nine-seven-seven is this way?

227
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,375
[SERENA] Yes sir.
But, we really don't have

228
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,250
the proper authorization
to be here right now.

229
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,500
This is a dire situation.

230
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,083
We don't have the time to
go through all the red tape.

231
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,750
I'll take full responsibility.

232
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,625
But sir. There are certain
rules that need to be--

233
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:43,833
[SERENA]
What are you doing?

234
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,458
[groans]

235
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,625
I'm sorry. But time
is of the essence.

236
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,208
[footsteps]

237
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:58,833
Attention.

238
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:02,250
One-zero-zero-nine-seven-seven.

239
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,916
[MAN scoffs] So it is you.

240
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,583
I thought I could
hear you comin' for me.

241
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:22,125
[roars]

242
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,083
[roars]

243
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,291
So this is the power
a dragon possesses.

244
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,666
A sight I'm certain
I shall never forget.

245
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,583
This is perfect. I got
knocked outta that last round

246
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,958
way quicker than I thought.

247
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,583
I'm ready to throw down!

248
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,500
I'll blow this critter away!

249
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:43,625
Lightning God
Charged Particle Cannon!

250
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,208
As tribute to Gray Fullbuster,

251
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,291
and his decisive
victory over me,

252
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,958
I'll fight this foul
creature using Ice Magic.

253
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,500
[RUFUS] Memory Make.

254
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,250
Sword of Frozen Black Lightning!

255
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,375
[bellows]

256
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,458
I never thought I'd see
those two work together.

257
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,791
I mean we were
in the same guild,

258
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,666
but things definitely
weren't like this!

259
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,416
Perhaps their
experiences in the games

260
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,750
have taught them something.

261
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,708
Sabertooth is finally
fightin' like a real team!

262
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,041
Everybody was just goin' out
for themselves before.

263
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,416
This is awesome!

264
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,416
Yeah, it's totally awesome!

265
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,458
Yep, watching those
Fairy Tail guys in action

266
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,291
was a real eye opener.

267
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:30,375
There's a good reason they
came in first place this year!

268
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,750
Memorizing is
a form of learning.

269
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:36,208
And if you can't learn from
your enemy, you will never win.

270
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,500
I think that
they're gonna beat it!

271
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:42,958
Yeah they are!

272
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:49,166
[roars]

273
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,708
But we hit that thing full on!

274
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,791
[roars]

275
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,666
That's impossible!
How is it still standing?

276
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,291
Get back, Frosch
and Lector. Do it now!

277
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,666
[LECTOR] Okay!

278
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,416
[FROSCH] Wait for me!

279
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,416
Just where in the hell
did Milady go?

280
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,208
We could use
her help right now!

281
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:11,333
I don't know. I haven't
seen her in a while.

282
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,875
But I assume she's
fighting somewhere else.

283
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,500
Can we even beat this monster?

284
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,375
I think it should be possible.

285
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,958
If memory serves me,
Sting and Rogue both

286
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,125
killed dragons
when they were young.

287
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,791
Well, you're half right.

288
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:40,958
[WEISSLOGIA]
Sting. Please, end my life.

289
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,583
I can't do that!
Please don't make me.

290
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,833
[WEISSLOGIA] Those who
wield Dragon Slaying magic

291
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,833
grow stronger once they've
bathed in dragon's blood.

292
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,083
[YOUNG STING]
No. I'm not gonna do it!

293
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,500
[WEISSLOGIA] You must!

294
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:55,708
Prove you've mastered
the skills I've taught you!

295
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,333
[YOUNG STING crying]

296
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:03,791
[STING scoffs]

297
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:08,166
Skiadrum had been suffering
from a serious illness,

298
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,208
so all I did, was just
put him out of his misery.

299
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,500
I didn't realize
that's what happened.

300
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,333
It must be a memory filled
with great sorrow for you.

301
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,750
But if you can kill dragons,

302
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:21,166
now is definitely
the time to do it!

303
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,791
These guys are
way more powerful!

304
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,958
I don't even know
if we can kill 'em!

305
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,541
But we still have to try!

306
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,791
We have to protect our friends!

307
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,916
[FUTURE ROGUE] I told you
earlier that in seven years,

308
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,291
dragons would reign
supreme over this world,

309
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,083
obliterating everything!

310
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,625
[FUTURE ROGUE] However,
it won't be ruled by these

311
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,458
that you see before you today!

312
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,125
[NATSU] So the ones
that're tearin' stuff up

313
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,958
ain't gonna be in charge?

314
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,250
[FUTURE ROGUE] That's right.
Seven years from now,

315
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,916
there will be
only one creature that

316
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,666
sits on top of the food chain.

317
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,416
You've encountered him before.

318
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,791
The black dragon, Acnologia!

319
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,958
There's no way in hell.

320
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,750
Many wizards tried
to take him down,

321
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,583
but all were slain.

322
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,958
And there are no more
guilds to speak of.

323
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,875
They've been eradicated.

324
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,666
[FUTURE ROGUE] I created a
spell for controlling dragons,

325
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,541
but it had no effect
on Acnologia.

326
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:19,666
[gasps]

327
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,541
[ZIRCONIS]
Despite his human origins,

328
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,375
he became the King
of all dragon kind.

329
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,000
His name was Acnologia.

330
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,625
Once a human being,
now a dragon,

331
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,208
cloaked in wings of darkness.

332
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:37,166
And now he can only be defeated
by dragons led by me!

333
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,333
That's the reason you
summoned all these dragons?

334
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,166
You're right again!

335
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,958
[FUTURE ROGUE] I traveled
seven years across time.

336
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,125
My plan was to
convince Princess Hisui

337
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,583
to open the Eclipse and
summon countless dragons

338
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,125
through that portal.

339
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,333
I only managed to get
a few dragons across

340
00:18:57,416 --> 00:19:00,708
before that meddlesome
Lucy Heartfilia got in my way!

341
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,416
[FUTURE ROGUE] But because
of my skill in using

342
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,625
Dragon Tamer Magic,
I have total control

343
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,708
of all who did pass through.

344
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,208
[FUTURE ROGUE] Acnologia
doesn't stand a chance

345
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,250
against me now.

346
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,791
And once I slay
that black-winged tyrant,

347
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,166
I will be the true Dragon King!

348
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,708
[NATSU] No you won't!

349
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,791
How I've been dreaming
for such power!

350
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,500
It's within my grasp!

351
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,583
I only smell seven dragons.

352
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,958
So that's it, huh?

353
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,416
Seven dragons
are all that I need!

354
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,208
The world will
soon belong to me!

355
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,958
You gotta have some
seriously rotten luck, pal.

356
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,500
Say what?

357
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,708
[KAGURA grunts]

358
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,041
Kagura! Are you all right?

359
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,916
I will be just fine.
Don't worry about me!

360
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,583
[OHBA] I'm just gonna
go right ahead and keep on

361
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,208
spinning and spinning
and spinning and spinning

362
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,791
and spinning
and spinning and--!

363
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,750
Would those who have been
injured please step forward?

364
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,708
[JURA] Shelia will help you!

365
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,250
Find anything? Does that
tell you what we can do

366
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,666
to stop the dragons?

367
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,458
I'm still working on it!

368
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,708
I think the only way
is attacking them

369
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,375
with the full force
of Dragon Slayer magic.

370
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,791
[roars]

371
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,708
[STING] You're right,
it's the only hope we have left!

372
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,958
We can't just
go down without a fight!

373
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,625
Let's do it! It's up to us!

374
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:22,083
We're Dragon Slayers, so let's
show the world what that means.

375
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,125
[MACAO and WAKABA] Master!

376
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,208
Are you okay?

377
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,375
Did it hurt you?

378
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,041
No need to worry.

379
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,583
I just got a little
burned is all.

380
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,708
If not even
the master could stop it,

381
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,833
then the rest of us
don't stand a chance.

382
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,041
Vile creature!

383
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,875
There has got to be
some other way!

384
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:44,125
[GRAY] Master Mavis! You're a
wiz with strategy, aren't ya?

385
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,041
So what do you
think we should do?

386
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:50,958
Listen up!
There are seven dragons.

387
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,291
[MAVIS] The plan
of action should be

388
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,708
completely obvious
at this point!

389
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,000
Huh?

390
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,875
What are you
trying to say?

391
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,000
[growls]

392
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,125
Where does luck play into this?

393
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,208
This is about skill!

394
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:13,916
[FUTURE ROGUE gasps]

What are you doing?!

398
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,000
Can you hear me?

399
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,291
[NATSU]
Let's quit playin' around

400
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:34,041
and use our Dragon Slayer magic!

401
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,333
Is that Natsu?

402
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:36,666
Oh yeah!

403
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,625
I hear ya.

404
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,875
There are seven dragons!

405
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,833
[NATSU] And we got
seven Dragon Slayers!

406
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,333
We can do this!

407
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,333
It's what we were born for!

408
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,583
Our whole lives
have led to this day!

Let's use our powers and
slay some freakin' dragons!

Damn you!

00:21:56,833 --> 00:22:00,333
Who's with me?

00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:04,291

goin' dragon hunting!

[FUTURE ROGUE]
Seven Dragon Slayers?

I'm afraid you're short by one!

I appreciate you
going through the trouble.

418

[DORANBOLT] It's okay.
He's here with us now.

419
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,625
Dragons are
attacking the city.

420
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:31,208
Ya don't say?
I already heard.

421
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:34,500
We need your power.
So will you help us?

425
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:16,250
That dragon ghost
that we talked to?

426
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:19,166
[NATSU] Oh yeah, all he wanted
to talk about was food, right?

427
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,875
[HAPPY] That's not all
he talked about!

428
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:22,458
Anyway, apparently
he's got some kinda

429
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:25,083
super scary magic that strips
humans of their dignity!

430
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:26,666
[NATSU] Really?
Then you're probably cool

431
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,166
if he didn't mention cats.

432
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,750
[HAPPY] Well, I'm not
so sure about that.

433
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,541
[NATSU] Ooh! Why don't
we test it and see?

wouldn't work on you either

gonna test it either!
