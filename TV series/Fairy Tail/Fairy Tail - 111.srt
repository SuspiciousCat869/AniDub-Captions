If it's up for a vote,

157
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,208
then I'm with Lucy,
we should check the camp.

158
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,958
All right... Let's go.

159
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,291
[NATSU]
I'll carry Gramps.

160
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,708
What about me?

161
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,708
Keep the council
from blowin' us up.

162
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,125
Listen we don't want their help;

163
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,791
we can take down Grimoire Heart
and that Zeref creep ourselves!

164
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,791
Tell 'em there's no need
to fire an Etherion blast!

165
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,958
You think they'll listen?

166
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:33,166
In that case, just try to find
a way to buy us some time.

167
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,833
[NATSU]
We're countin' on you.

168
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,416
Come back...!
You can't beat them!

169
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,166
[DORABOLT] No guild that's
faced Grimoire Heart

170
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,958
has lived to talk about it!
Do you even have a plan?!

171
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,625
Give 'em everything we got.

172
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,041
[NATSU]
That's all!

173
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,666
You're on my side?

174
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,458
[ULTEAR]
That's right.

175
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,666
About, Ur...

176
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,375
I know... You don't
need to say anything.

177
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:16,916
Her death wasn't your fault...
I don't blame anyone.

178
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:31,000
[ULTEAR] My mother was simply
protecting her pupils.

179
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,166
I'm very proud of her.

180
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,416
Sure, whatever you say.

181
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,750
This might sound harsh

182
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,250
but I honestly don't care
what you think of me...

183
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,583
And if you're as proud of
her as you say you are...

184
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,958
you've got a funny way
of showin' it!

185
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,458
[ULTEAR]
Are you referring to Zeref?

186
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,416
Damn straight...! If anyone's
responsible for Ur's death,

187
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,125
it's that bastard!

188
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:06,541
She was killed by Deliora!
A monster that he created!

189
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,916
But instead of getting rid of
him, you're gonna use his power

190
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
to kill more people than
any of his creations did!

191
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,166
You have it all wrong, Gray.

192
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,583
[GRAY]
Do I?

193
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:22,291
Like I said, I'm going
to set it right... Trust me.

194
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,166
This is Ur's will.

195
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:42,333
Wendy! Can you hear me?!

196
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,208
[AZUMA]
The famous Erza.

197
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,583
Show yourself!

198
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,000
[AZUMA] Finally... I've
found a true warrior...

199
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,375
Titania.

200
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,791
Wendy's gone... I saw to that.

201
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,000
Then you'll die.

202
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:23,208
To think that even Meldy
would be bested in combat...

203
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,916
I never imagined more than
half of the deadly Seven Kin

204
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,541
would fall to such weak rabble.

205
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,791
I've no choice now.

206
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,666
It would appear
he's already left.

207
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:48,416
Forgive me, Makarov...
He's the one wizard I hoped

208
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,083
I'd never have to
send into the fray.

209
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,333
The end is near.

210
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,208
Natsu and the others
are headed this way?!

211
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,875
It'll be so good
to see everybody again!

212
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,750
Well... they
should be here soon...

213
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,750
In fact, they're following
Carla to camp as we speak.

214
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,250
[LISANNA]
Oh, thank goodness!

215
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,541
With so many wizards down,

216
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,541
we're gonna need
all the help we can get.

217
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:18,750
[PANTHERLILY]
We'll be adding one more

218
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,666
to the wounded when
they arrive with Master.

219
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,958
I can't believe those
jerks beat him like that.

220
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,250
I know...

221
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,583
Well they're gonna pay...!

222
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,375
We'll send Grimoire Heart
running for the hills...

223
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:31,875
If we work together we can
pull it off...! I know it.

224
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,166
[RUSTYROSE] Here's an idea:
why don't you surrender?

225
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,750
Nothing wrong with that,
differences in power abound

226
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,083
in this unbalanced
world of ours.

227
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:50,291
Feel your drums pound
faster against their cages,

228
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,958
And prepare yourselves...

229
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:55,916
For oblivion. Because
that's where you're headed.

230
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,541
Oh yeah...? That's what
you think, scoundrel!

231
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,458
I'm worried, Carla...
What if Doranbolt fails?

232
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,958
Just forget about that
creep... We don't need him.

233
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,958
I'm really worried
about Cana, too...

234
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,875
I hope she's made it
back to base camp.

235
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,916
Maybe Erza will be there!

236
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,666
We've got company.

237
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,166
He's strong...
I feel his power!

238
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,041
The rain's pouring down on him

239
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,291
as if there's
a storm cloud over his head!

240
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,708
My "Happy sense"
is startin' to tingle...

Who are you...?!

[BLUENOTE] Tell me,
have you learned to fly?

243
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,291
No...? Pity.

244
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,208
Then you'll fall.

00:20:58,875 --> 00:20:59,666
Do you feel that?!

00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,166
It's overwhelming!

249
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,125
This presence... it's stronger
than the others combined!

250
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,791
It seems an annoyance
has reared its ugly head...

disturb my glorious feast?

Your death knell...
This war is over.

You know, personally...

Neither the Fairy Tail guild...
nor our plans for Zeref...

mean much of anything to me.

But, there is one thing...

260
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,416
I have been longing
to do on this island.

Where is the grave
of Mavis Vermilion...?

And then...
I can face my father.
