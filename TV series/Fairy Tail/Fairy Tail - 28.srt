1
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:20,083
- HEY GUYS! READY FOR
SOME MORE FAIRY TAIL?

2
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:21,791
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING

3
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,541
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS
ON IN THE ROOM,

4
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:26,000
AND DON'T SIT TOO
CLOSE TO THE TV!

5
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,583
- PREVIOUSLY ON FAIRY TAIL!

6
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,708
WE WERE ABLE TO STOP
PHANTOM'S MAGIC GIANT

7
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,291
FROM CASTING THE
ABYSS BREAK SPELL

8
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:35,291
BUT OUR GUILD HALL
WAS DESTROYED!

9
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,250
ERZA IS BUSY FIGHTING
PHANTOM'S MASTER,

10
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,708
WHO'S REALLY CREEPY
AND REALLY STRONG.

11
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,125
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE NATSU

12
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,625
IS ABOUT TO FINISH OFF GAJEEL,
THE IRON DRAGON SLAYER.

13
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,416
AT LEAST I HOPE SO!

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:57,708
- ( theme song playing )

15
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,083
- THOSE SHADES AIN'T
SLOWIN DOWN!

16
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:30,041
- SO BE IT. THEY MAY HAVE
DESTROYED OUR GUILD HALL

17
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:32,250
BUT THIS FIGHT
AIN'T OVER YET!

18
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,500
- YEAH!

19
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,208
- Happy: FAIRY LAW!

20
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:45,541
- I'M GONNA MAKE YOU PAY FOR
WHAT YOU DID TO MY FRIENDS.

21
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,875
MESSIN' WITH FAIRY TAIL

22
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:50,208
IS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE
YOU'VE EVER MADE.

23
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:53,958
- THE ONLY MISTAKE I MADE
WAS NOT KILLIN' YOU SOONER!

24
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:58,333
IRON DRAGON HARD FIST!

25
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:08,541
NO, IT CAN'T BE!
I'M THE STRONGEST!

26
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,791
- YOU'RE THROUGH, BLACK STEEL!

27
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:15,375
FLAME LOTUS FIRE DRAGON FIST!

28
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,958
LEVY! JET! DROY! NAB!

29
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,625
MACAO! GRAMPS! ERZA!

30
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,291
AND LUCY!

31
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:35,041
THIS IS FOR ATTACKING THEM AND
DESTROYING OUR GUILD HALL!

32
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,000
- AL! YOU SEE THAT LIGHT?

33
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,583
- IT'S NATSU!

34
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,375
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENIN'!

35
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,416
- GAJEEL'S NEVER LOST A FIGHT!

36
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,333
- Lucy: WHERE IS HE?

37
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,166
- NATSU?

38
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,750
- NATSU! HEY!

39
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,958
- ALRIGHT! IT LOOKS LIKE HE WON!

40
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:08,416
- YOU CAN'T DEFEAT ME.

41
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,750
- OH YEAH? I THINK I JUST DID.

42
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,083
- HE'S DOWN!

43
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:25,208
- WELL, THAT WAS FUN, BUT I
THINK I'M GONNA REST A BIT.

44
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:34,458
- WHAT A MESS. AW, MAN.
TALK ABOUT OVERDOIN' IT.

45
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,500
- AYE! THAT'S NATSU FOR YA!

46
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,500
- DESTRUCTIVE AS ALWAYS.
BUT IT'S STILL PRETTY COOL.

47
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:50,958
- THAT GUY'S INSANE. HE TORE
THE WHOLE PLACE DOWN!

48
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,375
MAN, I HAD NO IDEA
THAT FAIRY TAIL WIZARDS

49
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,875
COULD BE SO POWERFUL!

50
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,875
- YEAH, THEY'RE AWESOME.

51
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,833
UH, NEVERMIND.

52
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,958
- MY, WHAT AN UNRULY
DRAGON YOU HAVE.

53
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,291
- HE MAY BE UNRULY

54
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:16,250
BUT HE'S ALSO AN EXTREMELY
POWERFUL WIZARD.

55
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,500
IN FACT, I'D SAY THAT HE'S
JUST AS STRONG AS I AM

56
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,958
IF NOT STRONGER.

57
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:25,250
- HEH. THERE'S NO NEED TO
BE SO MODEST, TITANIA ERZA.

58
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,875
YOUR MAGIC IS JUST AS
SPECTACULAR AS SALAMANDER'S.

59
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,666
YOU'RE THE FIRST WIZARD WHO'S
EVER BEEN ABLE TO LAST THIS LONG

60
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,416
AGAINST ME IN BATTLE.

61
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,833
TRUTH BE TOLD, WE'D BE MORE
EQUALLY MATCHED IN POWER

62
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,833
IF YOU HADN'T TAKEN A DIRECT HIT

63
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,791
FROM THE JUPITER CANNON
EARLIER TODAY.

64
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:46,000
YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY IRKS ME
ABOUT FAIRY TAIL?

65
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:50,416
THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SO MANY
POWERFUL WIZARDS LIKE YOURSELF

66
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,083
WHO ARE ALIGNED
WITH MAKAROV.

67
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,416
SINCE YOU CAN'T BE
TEMPTED TO JOIN PHANTOM

68
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,625
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO CHANGE THAT--

69
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,708
KILL YOU!

70
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:19,041
THAT'LL SEND THE OLD
COOT INTO A DEEP DESPAIR.

71
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,833
IMAGINE HOW HE'LL FEEL

72
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,833
WHEN HE AWAKENS TO FIND HIS
DEAR GUILD HALL DESTROYED

73
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,166
AND HIS "CHILDREN"
DEAD AND GONE.

74
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,583
HE'D BE LOST; COMPLETELY
CONSUMED BY SORROW.

75
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,958
ONCE HE'S BEEN REDUCED
TO THAT MISERABLE STATE,

76
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:46,875
I CAN SWOOP IN AND KILL HIM,
BUT FIRST I'LL MAKE HIM SUFFER.

77
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:51,708
I'LL TORTURE HIM UNTIL HE HAS NO
CHOICE BUT TO WITHER AND DIE!

78
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,666
AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER,

79
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,500
PHANTOM LORD HAS
ALWAYS BEEN AT THE TOP.

80
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,125
WE HAVE THE MOST
POWERFUL WIZARDS

81
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:04,000
WITH THE STRONGEST SPELLS;
WE ALSO HAVE MORE CAPITAL

82
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,625
AND MORE MEMBERS
THAN ANY OTHER GUILD.

83
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,625
HOWEVER, RECENTLY FAIRY
TAIL HAS BEGUN TO CATCH UP

84
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,833
AND OUR POSITION AS
LEADER IS IN JEOPARDY.

85
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:17,041
THE NAMES ERZA, LAXUS, AND
MYSTOGAN BECAME WIDELY KNOWN,

86
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:22,166
AND STORIES OF SALAMANDER SPREAD
ACROSS THE LAND LIKE WILDFIRE.

87
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,500
NOW PHANTOM LORD AND FAIRY
TAIL ARE CONSIDERED EQUALS!

88
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:29,458
THE TOP TWO GUILDS
REPRESENTING THIS KINGDOM.

89
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,708
THE THOUGHT DISGUSTS ME.

90
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:36,208
I REFUSE TO BE EQUATED
TO SUCH A FEEBLE GUILD!

91
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,666
- Erza: SILENCE!

92
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,541
SO, WE'RE FIGHTING
FOR OUR LIVES,

93
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,041
JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE HAD
A FIT OF JEALOUSY?

94
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,541
- JEALOUSY? THAT'S ABSURD!

95
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,416
WE SIMPLY WANTED TO
PROVE TO THE KINGDOM

96
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,708
THAT WE ARE
THE DOMINANT GUILD.

97
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:55,291
- HOW COULD YOU? AND FOR
SUCH A PETTY REASON?

98
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,791
- WHILE I'VE NEVER BEEN
PARTICULARLY FOND OF YOUR GUILD,

99
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:21,583
MY DISTASTE FOR YOU WAS NOT
WHAT TRIGGERED THIS WAR.

100
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:24,833
WE WERE HIRED BY THE PATRIARCH
OF THE HEARTFILIA FAMILY

101
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,875
TO FIND HIS MISSING DAUGHTER.

102
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,541
- Erza: LUCY.

103
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,250
- THE CHILD OF ONE OF THE
KINGDOM'S WEALTHIEST MEN

104
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,541
IS NOW IN FAIRY TAIL.

105
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:38,291
SO MAKAROV'S TRYING TO BUY
HIS WAY TO THE TOP, ISN'T HE?

106
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,125
NOW THAT YOUR GUILD
HAS UNFETTERED ACCESS

107
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,291
TO THE HEARTFILIA
FAMILY FORTUNE,

108
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,083
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF
TIME BEFORE THAT HAPPENS.

109
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,916
THAT IS, IF WE DON'T
COMPLETELY WIPE YOU OUT FIRST.

110
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,500
- IT'S LAUGHABLE HOW
CONCERNED YOU ARE

111
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,291
ABOUT SOMETHING AS SILLY
AS YOUR GUILD'S RANKING.

112
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,916
BUT, I'M EVEN MORE AMUSED

113
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,958
BY HOW INCREDIBLY MISINFORMED
YOU ARE ABOUT LUCY.

114
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,041
- WHAT?

115
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,875
- SHE CAME TO US AS A RUNAWAY!

116
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,333
SHE DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS
TO HER FAMILY'S FORTUNE!

117
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,083
Erza: SHE RENTS A PLACE FOR
70,000 JEWEL A MONTH!

118
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,958
SHE WORKS HARD TO MAKE A LIVING.

119
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,375
SHE FIGHTS ALONGSIDE US.

120
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,708
SHE LAUGHS WITH US AND
SHE CRIES WITH US.

121
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,916
SHE'S NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY
OTHER MEMBER OF OUR GUILD!

122
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,833
- I WANNA STAY WITH YOU GUYS

123
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:28,250
'CAUSE I LOVE BEIN'
IN FAIRY TAIL!

124
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,583
- AND SHE'S WHY WE'RE AT WAR?

125
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,833
WE WOULD NEVER
BETRAY HER LIKE THAT!

126
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,666
YOU'D HAVE TO KILL US FIRST!

127
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,458
SHE MAY BE THE DAUGHTER
OF THE HEARTFILIA FAMILY,

128
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:41,250
BUT JUST AS FLOWERS DON'T GET
TO CHOOSE WHERE THEY BLOOM,

129
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:44,333
CHILDREN DON'T GET TO
CHOOSE THEIR PARENTS!

130
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:56,000
( Lucy sobs )

131
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,041
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT LUCY

132
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,875
OR THE TEARS THAT SHE HAS SHED!

133
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,458
- WELL, I'LL FIND OUT
SOON ENOUGH!

134
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,625
I'M NOT GOING TO HAND HER
OVER TO HER FATHER

135
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,500
WITHOUT REAPING A
BENEFIT OF SOME SORT.

136
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:12,250
I'LL MAKE HER MY PRISONER UNTIL
HER FATHER MEETS MY DEMANDS.

137
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,666
I'M GOING TO BLEED THE
HEARTFILIA FAMILY

138
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,833
OF THEIR FORTUNE

139
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,583
AND THEIR PRECIOUS
MONEY-MAKING BUSINESSES!

140
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,958
- CURSE YOU!

141
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,458
- I WOULDN'T KEEP STRUGGLING
LIKE THAT IF I WERE YOU.

142
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,125
IT'S GOING TO MAKE
THIS MORE PAINFUL!

143
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:32,625
( Erza screams )

144
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:35,916
YOU'RE NOT FEELING VERY
WELL, ARE YOU DEAR?

145
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,958
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BUCK UP
BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST TIME.

146
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:42,625
I WANT YOU TO MAKE AN
APPEARANCE BEFORE YOUR PEERS.

147
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,875
ONCE THEY SEE THEIR BELOVED
ERZA IN SUCH A PITIFUL STATE,

148
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,083
THEY'RE SURE TO SURRENDER TO US!

149
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,916
- YOU'RE A DESPICABLE MAN!

150
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,291
- NOW, NOW, INSULTING
ME LIKE THAT

151
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,875
ISN'T GOING TO HELP
YOUR SITUATION.

152
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,541
(sinister laugh)

153
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,833
- I'D RATHER DIE THAN CAUSE MY
GUILD MATES TO SURRENDER.

154
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,708
I LEAVE THE REST
UP TO YOU, NATSU.

155
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:22,833
( thunder rumbles )

156
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,458
BUT HOW?

157
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:58,333
- YOU HAVE SHED THE
BLOOD OF OUR CHILDREN.

158
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,750
AND THAT IS UNFORGIVABLE.

159
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,166
THEY HAVE BEEN MADE TO SUFFER

160
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,958
BECAUSE OF THE INCOMPETENCE
OF THEIR PARENTS.

161
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,166
WE ARE BOTH TO BLAME, JOSE.

162
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:13,833
THIS WAR BETWEEN US
HAS GONE ON LONG ENOUGH.

163
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:19,083
LET'S END THIS HERE AND NOW!

164
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:23,958
- Erza: MASTER!

165
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:35,666
- IF WE FIGHT IT COULD
CREATE A CATASTROPHE.

166
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:46,416
- IN ORDER TO SAVE MY GUILD,
I WILL GLADLY TAKE THAT RISK!

167
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:53,541
( he laughs )

168
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,375
- I CAN FEEL THEIR FEAR;

169
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:21,833
THE TREES, THE EARTH, THE AIR.

170
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,958
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY--

171
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,625
I HATE HUMANS!

172
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,333
THEY'RE SO DIM-WITTED THEY HAVE
NO IDEA HOW TO SOLVE A PROBLEM

173
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,291
WITHOUT RAISING THEIR FISTS!

174
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,916
YOU'RE A NIT-WIT, MAKAROV!

175
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,458
I TRIED TO WARN YOU, BUT OF
COURSE YOU NEVER LISTEN TO ME!

176
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,291
MYSTOGAN.

177
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,416
- MIND IF I HAVE THIS?

178
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,291
- HA, I WONDERED
HOW THE OLD GEEZER

179
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:56,208
WAS ABLE TO RECOVER SO QUICKLY.
NOW IT ALL MAKES SENSE.

180
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,250
WHEN MAKAROV WAS HIT
WITH THE DRAIN SPELL

181
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,416
YOU GATHERED HIS LOST MAGIC.

182
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,416
- I NEVER SAID
YOU COULD EAT THAT!

183
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:07,000
- THIS WAR WILL BE OVER SOON.

184
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:11,083
- I'M NOT A PROPONENT OF
ANY SORT OF VIOLENCE,

185
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,208
EVEN BETWEEN LOATHSOME HUMANS.

186
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:16,208
THAT BEING SAID, AREN'T
YOU ONE OF MAKAROV'S MEN?

187
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:19,583
DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME HERE.
YOUR ALLIES NEED YOUR HELP.

188
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,125
PHANTOM'S FLAGS.
THERE'S SO MANY.

189
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,041
HE MUST'VE OVERTHROWN
EVERY SINGLE ONE

190
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,375
OF THEIR BRANCHES
IN THE KINGDOM.

191
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,833
- MAY I TAKE ANOTHER
APPLE FOR THE ROAD?

192
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,500
- YOU ARE GOING TO
PICK UP THIS MESS

193
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,791
YOU MADE BEFORE YOU GO, RIGHT?

194
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:53,333
HONESTLY. I'LL NEVER
UNDERSTAND HUMANS.

195
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:57,000
THEY THIRST FOR POWER
AND FIND THEMSELVES AT WAR.

196
00:14:57,083 --> 00:15:00,500
THEY FORGET HOW MUCH PAIN
AND SORROW IT CAN BRING.

197
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,208
ALL THAT MATTERS
IS THEIR VICTORY.

198
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,250
- I BELIEVE THERE IS A
WAY TO SAVE THEM

199
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,541
FROM THAT PAIN AND SORROW.

200
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:17,125
IT'S A SACRED LIGHT,
WHICH GUIDES US ALL.

201
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,500
- WHAT THE--? FOR
SOME STRANGE REASON

202
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,291
THIS WARM LIGHT REMINDS
ME OF THE MASTER.

203
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,916
- YOU KIDS NEED TO GET
OUT WHILE YOU CAN!

204
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:53,583
- GRAMPS!

205
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,000
- WE'LL STAY WITH YOU!

206
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,666
- NO, WE HAVE TO DO AS HE SAYS!

207
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,291
LET'S GO!

208
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,666
- BUT ERZA!

209
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,250
- SIS, YOU THINK YOU CAN STAND?

210
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,416
- WELL, WELL, NOW
THAT YOU'RE HERE,

211
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,916
I'VE NO INTEREST IN THOSE
"CHILDREN" OF YOURS.

212
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,583
I'LL EXTERMINATE THOSE PESTS
AFTER I'VE FINISHED YOU OFF.

213
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:15,916
- IF WE STAY HERE WE'RE ONLY
GOING TO GET IN HIS WAY.

214
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,458
HE CAN HANDLE THIS,
I HAVE FAITH.

215
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,791
- IT'S BEEN SIX YEARS SINCE
WE LAST CAME FACE TO FACE.

216
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,416
THEN, PHANTOM WAS NUMBER ONE

217
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,833
AND NO ONE KNEW HOW LARGE
YOUR FAIRY TAIL WOULD BECOME.

218
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,750
- BUT NOW IT'S BEEN
REDUCED TO RUBBLE.

219
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,541
- OUR GUILD HALL MAY
HAVE BEEN DESTROYED

220
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,666
BUT WE'RE STRONG AS EVER!

221
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,333
- I MUST ADMIT I'M LOOKING
FORWARD TO THIS.

222
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,125
ALTHOUGH IT'S FROWNED UPON
BY THE COUNCIL--

223
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:47,583
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHO'S
THE SUPERIOR WIZARD SAINT.

224
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,375
- I COULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS
WITHOUT YOU, MY CHILDREN.

225
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,166
BLESS YOU ALL.

226
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,000
BE PROUD THAT YOU
ARE MEMBERS OF FAIRY TAIL!

227
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,708
- WHAT'S GOIN' ON?
- THE SKY.

228
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:04,791
- WATCH OUT!

229
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:06,541
- WE'RE SHAKIN'!

230
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,291
- WHAT THE--?

231
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,125
- IT'S AN EARTHQUAKE!

232
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,458
- DEAD WAVE!

233
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,750
- NATSU!
- ARE YOU OKAY?

234
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:48,833
- OH YEAH.

235
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,958
- WHAT THE HECK IS
GOIN' ON IN THERE?

236
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,958
- PRETTY SURE THAT'S GRAMPS
IN THERE SETTLING THE SCORE.

237
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:07,583
- I'M IMPRESSED. YOU'VE SO MUCH
POWER AT YOUR COMMAND.

238
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,166
I CAN SEE WHY THE
COUNCIL NAMED YOU

239
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,375
ONE OF THE TEN WIZARD SAINTS.

240
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,416
HOWEVER, YOU'RE
MISUSING THAT POWER

241
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,625
FOR YOUR OWN PERSONAL GAIN.

242
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,041
YOU COULD'VE
BECOME A ROLE MODEL

243
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,250
FOR THE YOUNGER GENERATION.

244
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,541
INSTEAD YOU'VE BECOME A
LESSON IN WHAT NOT TO DO.

245
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,666
- WHAT IS THIS? A LECTURE?

246
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,458
- I'VE A RULE THAT SEEMS TO WORK
WELL WITH MY FAIRY TAIL KIDS.

247
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:34,750
I'LL GIVE YOU TO THE COUNT OF
THREE TO DO EXACTLY AS I SAY.

248
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,458
KNEEL TO ME.

249
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,333
- WHAT?

250
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,791
- ONE!

251
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,958
- SO YOU WANT ME TO CONCEDE
AND KNEEL BEFORE YOU?

252
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,208
NO WAY IN HELL!

253
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,625
- TWO!

254
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,583
- WHY WOULD THE MASTER
OF THE TOP GUILD

255
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,458
IN THIS KINGDOM
EVER STOOP SO LOW

256
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,291
AS TO KNEEL BEFORE YOU?

257
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,458
TECHNICALLY WE ARE
EQUALLY POWERFUL

258
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:05,250
BUT MY ABILITY TO BE HEARTLESS
MAKES ME EVEN STRONGER!

259
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,625
- THREE!

260
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:09,416
- YOU ARE THE ONE WHO SHOULD
BE KNEELING BEFORE ME!

261
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,666
NOW, YOU AND YOUR PRECIOUS
FAIRY TAIL "CHILDREN"

262
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,125
ARE GOING TO DIE!

263
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,583
- TIME'S UP!

264
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,708
- THIS IS IT!

265
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,875
- I INVOKE FAIRY LAW!

266
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,916
- WHERE'S THAT LIGHT
COMIN' FROM?

267
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,666
- IT'S SO BRIGHT!

268
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,166
- THEY'RE DISAPPEARING!

269
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,708
- WHAT'S HAPPENIN'?

270
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:04,291
- I THINK THE LIGHT'S KILLIN'
'EM. BUT WE'RE ALL STILL OKAY!

271
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:07,333
- YOU'RE RIGHT. IT MUST BE
SOMEBODY ON OUR SIDE.

272
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,500
- THIS IS FAIRY LAW.

273
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,333
- WHAT IS THAT?

274
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:14,791
- A SPELL THAT VANQUISHES
DARKNESS WITH SACRED LIGHT.

275
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:18,458
IT ONLY AFFECTS THOSE WHO
THE CASTER SEES AS THEIR ENEMY.

276
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,125
INCREDIBLE, ISN'T IT?

277
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:24,416
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST LEGENDARY
SPELLS IN EXISTENCE.

278
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:56,500
- YOU WILL NEVER BOTHER FAIRY
TAIL AGAIN, UNDERSTAND?

279
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,791
I'M SURE THE MAGIC COUNCIL
WILL BE WATCHING US

280
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,041
AFTER ALL THE CHAOS
WE'VE CAUSED.

281
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,416
YOU'D BETTER BE ON YOUR
BEST BEHAVIOR FROM NOW ON.

282
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,958
I KNOW I WILL.

283
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:11,666
- OUR MASTER HAS
FALLEN. HOW SAD.

284
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:16,125
THE OLD MAN'S LEFT HIMSELF
OPEN AGAIN. THIS IS MY CHANCE!

285
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:29,000
- THE WAR IS OVER. THERE'S NO
REASON FOR US TO FIGHT ANYMORE.

286
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,750
BUT IF YOU PUSH ME TO
THE POINT OF ANGER,

287
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:36,375
I'LL WIPE OUT YOUR ENTIRE
GUILD WITHOUT HESITATION!

288
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:40,166
NOW YOU KIDS GET OUTTA
HERE AND TAKE JOSE!

289
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,791
- ALRIGHT! WE BEAT PHANTOM!

290
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:52,458
- YEE-HAW!

291
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:18,583
- WE ARE VICTORIOUS!

292
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:22,125
BUT I HAD VERY LITTLE
TO DO WITH IT.

293
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,750
THIS VICTORY IS YOURS,
MY CHILDREN!

294
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:36,041
WE COULDN'T HAVE DONE
IT WITHOUT YOU, BIG GUY!

295
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:52,833
( singing in Japanese )

296
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:15,291
- POOR LUCY, SHE MUST'VE
BEEN REALLY SCARED

297
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:17,250
BACK WHEN JOSE
KIDNAPPED HER, HUH?

298
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:20,916
- TELL ME ABOUT IT! DID YA
SEE HOW HE LOOKED AT HER?

299
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,708
IT WAS SERIOUSLY CREEPY.
I BET HE HAD A THING FOR HER!

300
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:25,916
- THERE ARE SOME MESSED
UP PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD.

301
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,083
WHO WOULD BE INTERESTED IN LUCY?

302
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,666
- I THINK LOKE MIGHT HAVE
A LITTLE CRUSH ON HER.

303
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,333
- NEXT TIME: MY RESOLVE!

304
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,000
- Happy: HER PROSPECTS
AREN'T LOOKIN' GOOD.

305
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:36,375
THAT MAKES ME WORRY.

306
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,666
