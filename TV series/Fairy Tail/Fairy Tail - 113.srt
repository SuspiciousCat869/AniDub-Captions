00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,625
They sure are!

166
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,541
That's our Thunder Legion.

167
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,250
Thanks, you guys.

168
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,416
[BIXLOW]
Get up!

169
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,041
[FRIED] There's nowhere
for you to run.

170
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,875
[RUSTYROSE] My very being is
wracked with erratic trembles.

171
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,500
Is this fear?

172
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,583
[NARRATOR] The Great
Tenrou Tree provides shelter

173
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,666
for this sacred island.

174
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,416
And among its twisted roots,

175
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,625
the warriors Erza and Azuma
are soon to entangle.

176
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,125
You're telling me
you've eliminated Wendy?

177
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,333
But she hasn't
fallen on her own.

178
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:32,708
Several of your comrades have
joined her and the rest are

179
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,333
all being dispensed
with as we speak.

180
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:36,750
[ERZA]
What nonsense!

181
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,166
There's no way you could
overpower Natsu, Mirajane,

182
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,666
and the others!

183
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,375
[AZUMA] I can't vouch for
this "Natsu" friend of yours.

184
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,250
But as for the She-Devil.

185
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,000
I sent her back to hell
with my own hands.

186
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,291
Do you doubt my words?

187
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,916
[ERZA]
Not entirely sure.

188
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,041
I'll have to test your abilities
myself to believe you.

189
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,541
Well, I can't
believe my luck.

190
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,791
First I faced the She-Devil.

191
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,500
And now the mighty Titania.

192
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:19,750
It's amazing.

193
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,666
What lovely trophies
for this day's hunt!

194
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,291
[NARRATOR] Elsewhere, Gray
is having a strange moment

195
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:33,000
with Grimoire Heart's Ultear,
who is revealing something

196
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,708
quite extraordinary.

197
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,666
This doesn't
make any sense.

198
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,041
You actually wanted to meet me
'cause you're really on my side?

199
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,458
[ULTEAR]
That's right.

200
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,208
I have been searching for
you for such a long time.

201
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,458
You are the beloved
pupil of the Ice Wizard, Ur.

202
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,208
And I am her
long lost daughter.

203
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,833
That means you and I are
practically siblings.

204
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,500
What, like brother and sister?

205
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,125
Give me a second
to process here.

206
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,625
I never knew I had a sister
just roaming around!

207
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,791
[ULTEAR] Well, I did
say "practically."

208
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:06,500
But, with that being the case,
I bear no grudge against you.

209
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,000
Seriously?

210
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,083
I'm having a hard time wrapping
my brain around all this.

211
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:13,375
You do realize our guilds
are sworn enemies!

212
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,541
It's true.

213
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:17,250
I've sworn allegiance
to Grimoire Heart.

214
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,166
But there's more
to life than guilds.

215
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,041
Perhaps we can get past
our differences.

216
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,291
We both share her guidance.

217
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,666
She lives on inside of us.

218
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,750
[LUCY] All of this fighting
on Tenrou Island was finally

219
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:40,083
nearing its conclusion.

220
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:43,458
We never lost faith.

221
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:46,750
We believed
wholeheartedly in our victory.

222
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,500
We still had hope.

223
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:28,208
[RUSTYROSE]
Fear pulsing through my veins.

224
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:31,833
Flooding my mind with
thoughts of impending doom.

225
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,458
Still.

226
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,791
It is I who has the advantage.

227
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,250
These racing
thoughts of fear

228
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,458
are like my fuel.

229
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,916
They serve to spur
my imagination.

230
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,375
Go forth, spirits of Brittia!

231
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,500
Dine on the souls of Fairies!

232
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,625
His summoning
power's insane.

233
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,500
Don't let those
things touch you!

234
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,583
[FRIED]
They're sticking to me!

235
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,583
[PANTHERLILY] He can make
anything in his imagination

236
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:08,791
come to life?

237
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,125
How can we fight against
someone like that?

238
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,208
This has gotta be
the most messed up magic

239
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,833
I've ever seen!

240
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,541
[RUSTYROSE]
Fried and Bixlow, was it?

241
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,000
Ah, yes.

242
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,958
Two members of the Thunder
Legion, if I'm not mistaken!

243
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,708
Or should I say two
underlings of Master Mahkarov's

244
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,791
disgraced grandson who was
ejected after a failed

245
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,083
overthrow attempt.

246
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,666
What was his name again?

247
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,791
Oh yes, Loxus, the fallen star.

248
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,250
[BIXLOW]
Shut your mouth!

249
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:43,000
[FRIED] How dare you even
speak his name, you scum.

250
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,041
You know nothing about him!

251
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,208
You bastard!

252
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,125
At last!

253
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,041
A true challenge appears!

254
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,333
[AZUMA]
Bleve!

255
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,208
[ERZA]
Morning Star!

256
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,375
Photon Slicer!

257
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,875
Does something amuse you?

258
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,583
[AZUMA]
Not quite 'amused'.

259
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,333
But I must admit I'm intrigued.

260
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,458
I've heard many tales
of your skill and valor.

261
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,666
I believe that you and I
are cut from the same cloth.

262
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,791
We seek warriors,
because fighting means

263
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,208
everything to us.

264
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,208
[ERZA] I'm afraid
that's not true.

265
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,208
I don't go looking
for warriors to fight.

266
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,583
[AZUMA]
No?

267
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:04,750
The only way you could reach
your level of strength

268
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,916
is fighting powerful foes.

269
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,166
All I have ever wanted is
the strength to protect those

270
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,500
I hold close to my heart.

271
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,833
I would give up all
of my strength if I could

272
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,208
still guarantee their safety.

273
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,208
It's strange, but true.

274
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,500
[AZUMA]
What a shame.

275
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,041
You're quite interesting.

276
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,291
I had hoped we'd
have a fair fight.

277
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,166
[ERZA] What do
you mean by that?

278
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,750
We've reached a
different stage in our battle.

279
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,750
What's happening?

280
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,875
I am connected with nature.

281
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,625
The forest.

282
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,708
My Lost magic
is the Arc of Trees.

283
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:56,291
I can take the
explosive power from the land

284
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,583
and channel it into
the heart of the wood.

285
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:05,083
But, where my magic's
true power lies is it gives me

286
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:08,375
the ability to become one
with the land and control

287
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:09,750
its magic energy.

288
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,375
You can control the
energy of the land itself?

289
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,791
[AZUMA] That is the reason I was
first to arrive on this island.

290
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:20,833
To harness the magic energy
contained in your sacred ground!

291
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,000
[ERZA]
No.

292
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,375
That's impossible!

293
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,541
This was not my choice.

294
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,791
But I must follow
the orders I was given.

295
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:32,583
[ERZA]
What?

296
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,208
What are you going to do?

297
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,708
Answer me!

298
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,125
[DORANBOLT]
No.

299
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,208
The Tenrou Tree.

300
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,791
It's falling!

301
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:52,416
Look!

302
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,291
It's coming down.

303
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,000
The whole island is collapsing!

304
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,666
It's that huge tree!

305
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,791
It's starting to topple over!

306
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,541
[DORANBOLT]
This can't be happening.

307
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,166
I should've forced them to
leave when I had the chance.

308
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,166
Wendy.

309
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,333
Natsu.

310
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,333
[DORANBOLT]
I wish you good luck.

311
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,333
[NATSU] What in
the heck is goin' on?

312
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,458
[HAPPY]
Please hurry, Carla!

313
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:32,708
[CARLA]
You're behind me!

314
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:36,166
We all gotta hurry
and get back to camp ASAP!

315
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,375
What the-?

316
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,416
[LUCY]
What's happening?

317
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,000
I feel like I just
ran outta juice.

318
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,083
My legs just quit working.

319
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,458
What's wrong with me?

320
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,541
So weak.

321
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,166
Hey.

322
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,458
What in the world is happening?

323
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,333
It's Azuma.

324
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,583
My power,
it's completely run out!

325
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,666
All at once.

326
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,083
What is it?

327
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:24,291
Oh no, Fried and Bixlow!

328
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,500
[RUSTYROSE laughing]

329
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,166
What a dramatic
reversal of fortunes.

330
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,625
The tide has turned again.

331
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,083
And The last
laugh will belong to me!

332
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:44,416
No.

333
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,750
I don't understand this.

334
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,541
What happened to our power?

335
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,541
[GILDARTS]
Damnit.

336
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,458
I'm totally out of energy.

337
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,166
What is this?

338
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,291
What the hell's going on here?

339
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,333
Old man.

340
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,750
What sort of insane mission
are you having Azuma

341
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,750
carry out for you?

342
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:24,041
[HADES] Quite the impressive
pawn Makarov has in Gildarts.

343
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,583
To think, someone other
than me could stop Bluenote

344
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,875
in his tracks.

345
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,958
if only for a moment.

346
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,916
Although it did take
a bit longer than I had

347
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,375
originally hoped.

348
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,875
Tenrou Island's magic power
is now under our control.

349
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,666
And with that, Fairy
Tail's chance of surviving

350
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,958
this battle disappears.

351
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,125
[AZUMA] Master Hades holds
a vast amount of knowledge

352
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,250
about this island.

353
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,500
Does he?

354
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,708
[AZUMA] At the center,
stands the great Tenrou Tree.

355
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,250
It blesses all who bear
the guild's emblem

356
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:12,250
with divine protection
from harm and death.

357
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,666
While at the same time, it
amplifies their magic power,

358
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,041
and gives them
extraordinary abilities.

359
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,333
[ERZA] So that's why master
chooses to hold the trial

360
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,916
on this island.

361
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,958
And you've
just felled the tree!

362
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,458
[AZUMA]
That is correct.

363
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,000
And as a result, not only has
this protective spell over

364
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:33,333
every Fairy Tail
wizard been nullified.

365
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,000
All of your magic
power will rapidly drain

366
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,750
from your bodies.

367
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,125
[RUSTYROSE] I must say this
is a vision of loveliness

368
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,916
before my very eyes.

369
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,250
If that's the case,
tell me this.

370
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,000
Why do I still stand?

371
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:04,333
[AZUMA] This may be
the end for your guild.

372
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:07,083
It will die,
along with that tree.

373
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,500
However.

374
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:18,000
Since I control all the
magic power on this island.

375
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:21,291
I've kept yours intact.

376
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,083
Now, Titania.

377
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,916
All of your friends
are at death's door.

378
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And you are the only one
who can save them.

379
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:32,416
You strive for the power
to protect those close to you.

380
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,375
Show me what that means!

381
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:50,208
♪

382
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:17,750
[NATSU] Man, that's gotta be
the biggest freakin' tree

383
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,458
I've ever seen in my life!

384
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,875
What kind is it?

385
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:22,250
[HAPPY] It's called the
Tenrou Tree and I'm pretty sure

386
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:23,791
that it's the only one.

387
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:25,750
[NATSU] I bet it's probably the
strongest tree in the world,

388
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,083
dontcha think?

389
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,666
[HAPPY] I dunno, but it
looks pretty solid to me.

390
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,166
[NATSU] Yeah, well I wonder
if it would move if

391
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,875
I punched it really hard.

392
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:33,916
[HAPPY]
Please don't do that!

393
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,791
[NATSU and HAPPY]
Next time: Erza vs. Azuma!

394
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,208
[HAPPY] Besides, if the tree
started moving and fell on you,

395
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:40,958
you'd be squashed
flat as a pancake!

396
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:42,916
[NATSU] Now why would
a tree just start movin'?

397
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,875
[HAPPY]
It was your idea, Natsu!
