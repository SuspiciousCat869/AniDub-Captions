1
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,208
- Natsu: PREVIOUSLY
ON "FAIRY TAIL..."

2
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:21,583
- Happy: I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

3
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:24,041
JELLAL'S ALIVE!
THIS IS BAD, GUYS.

4
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,375
- Lucy:
ERZA'S IN SERIOUS TROUBLE

5
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,833
IF WE DON'T GET 
WENDY HERE FAST.

6
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,500
- Racer: I'LL SHOW YOU
FAST, BLONDIE.

7
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:29,916
- Gray:
QUIT STANDING AROUND, NATSU.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,750
I'LL HOLD OFF THE SPEED FREAK.

9
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,416
GET TO ERZA! QUICKLY!

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,833
- Racer:
I'LL SHOW YOU "QUICKLY!"

11
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:37,333
- Natsu: OH! ENOUGH
WITH THE FAST TALK!

12
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:40,041
- ( theme music playing )

13
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

14
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,625
- Narrator:
THE WORTH WOODSEA...

15
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:19,083
ITS TRANQUILITY DISRUPTED
BY A LONE MAN

16
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,000
HEADING DEEP
INTO ITS HEART.

17
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,750
- ( Happy groans )

18
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:34,791
- YOU OKAY, LITTLE BUDDY?
- NATSU, WHERE ARE WE?

19
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,583
- NO TALKING.  YOU GOT TO 
TRY TO REST UP, ALL RIGHT?

20
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,500
- BUT JELLAL IS OUT
THERE SOMEWHERE.

21
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:42,250
- YEAH, I KNOW.
BUT DON'T YOU WORRY.

22
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,875
I'M GONNA MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T
STICK AROUND LONG.

23
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,500
- Male voice:
NATSU!

24
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,250
- ( gasps )
WHAT THE HECK?

25
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,833
- Happy: WHAT'S WRONG?
WHY'D YOU STOP?

26
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,083
- Male voice:
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

27
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,041
- THIS TREE
IS TALKING TO ME.

28
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,875
- ( Happy speaking ) 

29
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,208
- Hibiki:
CAN YOU HEAR ME, NATSU?

30
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:09,791
- YES, GREAT TREE.

31
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,000
- GREAT WHAT?

32
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,125
THIS IS HIBIKI FROM
BLUE PEGASUS.

33
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,833
ANYWAY, I'M GLAD
I COULD REACH YOU.

34
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,666
NO ONE ELSE HAS
RESPONDED SO FAR.

35
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,375
- Natsu: YOU'RE 
A VENTRILOQUIST?

36
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,833
 - WOULD YOU KNOCK IT OFF?
AND KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

37
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,125
THE ENEMY HAS SCOUTS
THROUGHOUT THE WOODSEA.

38
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:28,166
THERE'S NO TELLING WHO
MIGHT BE LISTENING IN ON US.

39
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,208
THAT'S WHY I'M SPEAKING 
DIRECTLY INTO YOUR HEAD.

40
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,833
PRETTY NEAT, HUH?

41
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,958
- ( groans )
- Hibiki: WHAT'S YOUR STATUS?

42
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,708
HAVE YOU FOUND WENDY
AND THE CAT?

43
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:38,000
- THEY'RE BOTH RIGHT HERE.
WENDY'S UNCONSCIOUS.

44
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:41,958
BUT HAPPY'S ALREADY WOKEN UP.
- Hibiki: THAT'S WONDERFUL.

45
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,833
NOW, HANG TIGHT.

46
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,750
I'M GONNA UPLOAD A MAP
INTO YOUR MIND.

47
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,833
IT'LL LEAD YOU STRAIGHT TO
THE TEMPORARY CAMP WE'VE SET UP.

48
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,625
I WAS GONNA SEND IT
TO THE CAT TOO,

49
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,708
BUT I CAN'T SEEM
TO MAKE A CONNECTION.

50
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,708
HE MUST BE RUNNING LOW
ON MAGIC POWER.

51
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,791
- HOLD ON, WHAT IS
THIS UPLOAD STUFF?

52
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,333
STAY OUT OF MY HEAD.

53
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,625
( gasps )
- NATSU, I THINK IT'S TIME

54
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,833
YOU SOUGHT PROFESSIONAL HELP.
- NOT NOW.

55
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,375
I HAVE TO FOLLOW THIS MAP
INSIDE MY BRAINS.

56
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,000
WOW, I CAN EVEN SEE
EXACTLY WHERE ERZA IS.

57
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,458
THIS UPLOAD STUFF IS COOL.

58
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,916
THANKS, GREAT TREE--
I MEAN, HIBIKI.

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,375
- Happy: AWW, MAN,
HE'S EVEN MORE FAR GONE

60
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,125
THAN I THOUGHT.

61
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,375
- PLEASE, HURRY.

62
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:26,125
I'M AFRAID THAT WE DON'T HAVE
THE LUXURY OF TIME RIGHT NOW.

63
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:29,041
- HEY, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND HOW NATSU

64
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,750
SUDDENLY KNEW
EXACTLY WHERE TO GO.

65
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,500
- I SENT HIM OUR LOCATION

66
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,166
USING ARCHIVE'S INFORMATION
COMPRESSION MAGIC.

67
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,083
IT PACKAGES THE INFORMATION
SO THAT IT CAN BE TRANSMITTED

68
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,541
AND SHARED WITH OTHERS
MUCH FASTER

69
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,333
THAN IT COULD BE VERBALLY.

70
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,833
- I HAD NO IDEA
THAT WAS EVEN POSSIBLE.

71
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,166
- MAGICALLY CONVERTING
AND TRANSMITTING DATA LIKE THIS

72
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,833
IS A FAIRLY NEW CONCEPT.

73
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,666
SO I WOULDN'T
EXPECT YOU TO KNOW.

74
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,708
- WOW, THAT'S REALLY IMPRESSIVE.

75
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,916
DID YOU HEAR THAT, ERZA?

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,208
WENDY'S GONNA BE HERE SOON.

77
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:01,458
JUST HOLD OUT
A LITTLE BIT LONGER, OKAY?

78
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,458
YOU CAN DO IT.

79
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,416
I MAY NOT BE
MUCH OF A FIGHTER,

80
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,291
BUT I'LL STAY HERE
TO PROTECT YOU.

81
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,958
PROMISE.

82
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,875
UM, WHAT THE HECK
ARE YOU SMILING AT?

83
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,333
DON'T YOU HAVE
SOME WORK TO DO?

84
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,208
- SORRY, I DIDN'T
MEAN ANYTHING BY IT.

85
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,833
IT'S JUST NICE TO SEE
SOME LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS.

86
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,875
- Narrator: MEANWHILE,
GRAY'S STANDOFF

87
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:36,208
WITH RACER, THE LIGHTNING-FAST
MEMBER OF THE ORACION SEIS,

88
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:39,625
IS ABOUT TO ERUPT
INTO A VIOLENT BATTLE.

89
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,291
- I'M IMPRESSED, FAIRY TAIL.

90
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,083
NOBODY'S EVER
STOPPED ME TWICE.

91
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:46,625
TO SAVE FACE,
I'LL GIVE YOURS A THRASHING.

92
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,583
- OH, IS THAT SO?
- ONCE I LEAVE YOU IN THE DUST,

93
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,916
I CAN CATCH UP WITH
THAT FIRE-BREATHING BRAT

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,166
IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE.

95
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,458
- HE'S SO FAST.

96
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:57,333
- BUT FIRST,
I GOT TO RUN YOU OVER!

97
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:00,083
I HAVE A FEELING IT WON'T
TAKE ME VERY LONG.

98
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,583
- WHAT'D YOU SAY?
YOU'RE GOING DOWN.

99
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,416
( grunts )

100
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,958
- YOU THINK
YOU CAN STOP ME?

101
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,125
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO PICK UP THE PACE.

102
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,541
- OH, MAN, HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO FIGHT THIS GUY?

103
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:13,958
( grunts )

104
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,750
- TELL YOU WHAT, ICE BOY--

105
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,166
I'LL LET YOU OFF THE HOOK
IF YOU JUST STAY ON THE GROUND.

106
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,208
THAT'S WHERE YOU BELONG, ANYWAY.

107
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,875
- OVER MY DEAD BODY.

108
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,833
- I CAN CERTAINLY
ARRANGE THAT FOR YOU.

109
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:28,291
LET'S KICK IT INTO OVERDRIVE!

110
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,708
DEAD GRAND PRIX!

111
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:33,625
- ( honking )
( engines whirr )

112
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:37,083
( motors run )

113
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,666
- WHAT IS THAT SOUND?
THIS CAN'T BE GOOD.

114
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,708
MAGI-CYCLES!

115
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,875
HOW MANY OF THEM ARE THERE?
I GOT TO PULL IT TOGETHER

116
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,875
BEFORE I GET RIPPED APART.

117
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,166
- ENJOYING MY
MOTOR SHOW FROM HELL?

118
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,916
- ( groans )

119
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,625
- HE'S PRETTY TOUGH.
- YOU'RE KIDDING?

120
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,541
YOU CAN ACTUALLY RIDE
THESE SCRAP HEAPS?

121
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:03,958
- WATCH YOUR MOUTH,
ICE BOY.

122
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,500
THESE SLEEK WONDERS ARE
ALMOST AS FAST AS I AM.

123
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:10,000
THEY'LL RUN CIRCLES
AROUND A CHUMP LIKE YOU.

124
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,958
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A CHALLENGE TO ME.

125
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,875
( growls )

126
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,750
LOOK, THIS CHUMP
JUST TAMED A CHARGER.

127
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,208
- WELL, FANCY THAT.

128
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:22,375
- I SUPPOSE I SHOULD THANK YOU
FOR INCLUDING AN S.E. PLUG.

129
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,166
- Narrator: REMEMBER THESE?

130
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,875
AS WE'VE SEEN BEFORE,

131
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,166
THERE'RE MANY HANDY VEHICLES
IN THIS WORLD

132
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,791
THAT RUN ON MAGICAL ENERGY.

133
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:34,125
WHENEVER A WIZARD WANTS TO
OPERATE ONE OF THESE VEHICLES,

134
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,833
SAY A MAGIC MOBILE
OR A MAGI-CYCLE,

135
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,375
ALL THEY HAVE TO DO
IS CONNECT TO THE S.E. PLUG

136
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,416
AND THEIR MAGICAL ENERGY
WILL BE USED

137
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,750
TO POWER THE MACHINE'S ENGINE.

138
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,166
- IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH
HAVING THIS THING

139
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,541
CONSTANTLY SAPPING
MY MAGIC AWAY.

140
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,166
YOU AND ME, LET'S GO!

141
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,291
- OH, YEAH?! DO YOU
REALLY WANT TO RACE ME?

142
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,041
YOU DON'T STAND A CHANCE.

143
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:58,500
- UNDERESTIMATE ME AND
YOU'LL BE EATING MY DUST, BUDDY.

144
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,875
- ( engines whirr )

145
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,375
- NICE.

146
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:10,375
I GOT TO SAY,
FOR A MEMBER OF

147
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,083
A PATHETICALLY WEAK GUILD,

148
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,750
YOU GOT SOME SHARP INSTINCTS.
- WHAT?! THAT'S IT!

149
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,208
NOW I'M ANGRY.

150
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,208
ICE MAKE: LANCE!

151
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,416
- MAYBE YOU'RE NOT
AS SHARP AS I THOUGHT.

152
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,333
- I'M STILL RIGHT 
ON YOUR TAIL, MAN.

153
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:33,708
- MY TURN. HAVE FUN TRYING
TO DODGE THIS, FAIRY.

154
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,166
HIGH SIDE RUSH!

155
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,833
- HE'S THROWING TIRES!

156
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:42,208
- NOT TOO BAD, CHUMP.
NICE WARM UP.

157
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,250
NOW THE DEAD GRAND PRIX
CAN REALLY START.

158
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,208
( grunts )
IT'S THE END OF THE LINE!

159
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,791
- CLOSE CALL. THIS GUY'S
GOT SOME GEARS LOOSE.

160
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,416
- WHAT'S UP?
TOO INTENSE FOR YOU?

161
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,000
- ( gasps )

162
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,750
- ( rumbling )

163
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,083
- I'VE GOT TO PROTECT ERZA.

164
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:16,416
I'M NOT GONNA
LOSE TO THIS FREAK.

165
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,958
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
CAUSED THAT EXPLOSION?

166
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:22,083
- GRAY, NATSU, PICK ONE.
- ( engine whirrs )

167
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,291
- Sherry: THAT GUY'S WITH
THE ORACION SEIS, RIGHT? 

168
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,000
- Lyon: YES,
THE ONE CALLED RACER.

169
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,708
- LYON!
- GRAY?

170
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,458
- YOU'RE TIMING COULDN'T
BE ANY BETTER, MAN.

171
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,791
HOP ABOARD.
- EXCUSE ME?

172
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,708
- YOU HEARD ME,
SO LET'S GO.

173
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,208
- ( engine revs )

174
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,583
- BUT, LYON--
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

175
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,000
YOU STAY HERE ON STANDBY.

176
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,916
- SURE, WHATEVER YOU SAY.
- ( engine runs )

177
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,625
- WHAT EXACTLY
DOES THAT ENTAIL?

178
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,833
- GRAY, DID YOU FIND WENDY?
- YEAH, AND HAPPY.

179
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:01,500
NATSU'S GOT BOTH OF THEM.
- GOOD, SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?

180
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,250
- I NEED YOU TO HELP ME
TAKE CARE OF THIS SPEED FREAK.

181
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,166
IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE
TO CAST SPELLS

182
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,291
WHILE I'M DRIVING THIS THING.
- OH?

183
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,583
SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU CAN'T DO THIS WITHOUT ME.

184
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,375
VERY WELL, I'LL SHOW YOU 
SOME REAL ICE MAKE MAGIC.

185
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,166
- JUST SHUT UP AND DO IT.

186
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,583
- HERE IT GOES!

187
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,791
HOW PATHETIC.

188
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,083
YOU STILL USE TWO HANDS

189
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:24,166
WHEN CASTING YOUR
ICE MAKE SPELLS.

190
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,750
- LYON, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

191
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,541
YOU NEVER CAST 
WITH TWO HANDS.

192
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,500
- THAT IS WHAT
UR TAUGHT US, RIGHT?

193
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,958
ICE MAKE: EAGLE!

194
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,083
- NICE, HE'S DOWN.
- NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

195
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,125
- YOU'RE GONNA PAY
FOR TRASHING MY RIDE.

196
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,416
- Both: NOW, ICE MAKE...

197
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
- APE!

198
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,958
- HAMMER!

199
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,750
- THAT'S SOME QUICK
MAKER MAGIC YOU GUYS GOT THERE.

200
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,958
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MOVE
WAY FASTER THAN THAT.

201
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,291
- ( grunts )
- JUST GIVE IT UP!

202
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,041
- ( groans )

203
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,625
- IF YOU WANT TO LAND
A HIT ON ME,

204
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,958
YOU'LL HAVE TO BE
FASTER THAN LIGHTNING.

205
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,416
- THIS IS POINTLESS.

206
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,208
- DON'T LOSE YOUR COOL, GRAY.

207
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,916
HE'S COMING IN
AT FOUR O'CLOCK.

208
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,041
TOGETHER WE CAN STOP HIM.

209
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:18,458
WE JUST NEED TO FOCUS.
- GOT TO KEEP COOL, HUH?

210
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,791
ALL RIGHT.

211
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,333
SO LET'S DO THIS!

212
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:22,916
- FIRE WHEN I GIVE THE WORD

213
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,208
AND DON'T YOU
DARE HOLD BACK.

214
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,625
- THAT'S WEIRD.

215
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,791
WHY ARE THEY
TAKING OFF THEIR CLOTHES?

216
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,333
- OH, WOW,
LYON'S STRIPPING TOO.

217
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,500
IT MUST BE OUT OF LOVE.

218
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,000
- Lyon: THERE!

219
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,000
HE'S IN FRONT OF US
AND HEADED THIS WAY!

220
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,416
- WE'VE GOT YOU NOW.

221
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,708
ICE GEYSER!

222
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,666
- SNOW DRAGON!

223
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,125
- NO WAY.
- HE'S EVEN FASTER THAN BEFORE.

224
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,666
- ( grunting )
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, PUNKS?

225
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,208
- ( grunting )
- CAN'T KEEP UP?

226
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,583
- YOU COULD ATTACK ME
FOR ETERNITY

227
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,291
AND YOU'D NEVER COME CLOSE
TO LANDING A SINGLE HIT.

228
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:18,708
REMEMBER, YOU'RE DEALING
WITH THE FASTEST MAN ALIVE.

229
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:22,416
- OH NO, ARE ALL THE REST
OF THEM THIS POWERFUL?

230
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,208
- BEEN FUN, BUT IT'S TIME

231
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,375
FOR THE FINAL
THRASHING TO BEGIN.

232
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:29,333
I'LL MAKE IT AS QUICK
AND PAINFUL AS POSSIBLE.

233
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,875
- DON'T WORRY, GRAY.
WE'VE WON.

234
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,083
I JUST FIGURED OUT HOW WE'RE
GONNA BEAT THIS GUY.

235
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,208
- Makarov: THE INVESTIGATION
REPORT HAS COME IN.

236
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,416
- REGARDING THE ORACION SEIS?

237
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,500
- YES, IT SEEMS THE FELLOW

238
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,500
CALLING HIMSELF "BRAIN"
MIGHT HAVE WORKED

239
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,708
FOR THE BUREAU OF
MAGICAL DEVELOPMENT.

240
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:03,166
- FOR THE BUREAU?
DO THEY KNOW HIS IDENTITY?

241
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,333
- THEY'RE LOOKING INTO IT
AS WE SPEAK.

242
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,291
WHAT'S EVEN MORE TROUBLING

243
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,583
IS THIS R-SYSTEM
THE REPORT MENTIONED.

244
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,500
IT APPARENTLY HAS TIES
TO THAT MONSTROSITY,

245
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,875
THE TOWER OF HEAVEN.

246
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,541
WILL WE NEVER
LEAVE ITS SHADOW?

247
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,041
- THAT MEANS IT'S CONNECTED
TO JELLAL IN SOME WAY.

248
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:22,541
IS BRAIN CONTINUING HIS WORK?
- HMM.

249
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,708
THAT'S DEFINITELY
A POSSIBILITY.

250
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,750
IF HE IS FOLLOWING 
JELLAL'S FOOTSTEPS,

251
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,375
THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT
COULD BE IN GRAVE DANGER.

252
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,875
- IT'LL BE OKAY, MASTER.
- HMM?

253
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:41,041
- FAIRY TAIL'S STRONGEST TEAM
IS OUT THERE.

254
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:44,250
THAT FACT ALONE KEEPS
ALL OF MY DOUBTS AT BAY.

255
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,208
- WELL SAID, MIRA.

256
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,416
- LET'S JUST HOPE 
THEY DON'T DESTROY

257
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,416
HALF OF THE WORLD
THEY'RE TRYING TO PROTECT.

258
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,625
- YOU KIDS ARE GONNA
DRIVE ME TO AN EARLY GRAVE.

259
00:13:56,708 --> 00:14:01,625
- I WONDER WHAT THOSE TWO 
COULD BE WHISPERING ABOUT.

260
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,916
- HUH, STRATEGIZE ALL YOU WANT.

261
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,708
IT WON'T DO YOU ANY GOOD.

262
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:11,000
- AND IF ALL GOES WELL,
WE GOT HIM.

263
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,333
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
- TOO BAD, THAT'S THE PLAN.

264
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,666
I'LL STOP HIM WITHOUT YOU.
- WAIT!

265
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,791
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
LET ME GO!

266
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,250
- WHY ARE YOU
FREEZING HIM LIKE THAT?

267
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,916
- Gray: WILL YOU QUIT
SCREWING AROUND?!

268
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,541
YOU CAN'T TAKE THIS GUY
BY YOURSELF AND YOU KNOW IT!

269
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,541
- HA, JUST SIT BACK
AND ENJOY THE SHOW.

270
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:33,666
I'LL FINISH HIM.

271
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,750
- MAN, THAT WAS
KIND OF HARSH. 

272
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,833
IS THAT HOW YOU
TREAT YOUR FRIENDS?

273
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,750
- IF YOU THINK
THE TWO OF US ARE FRIENDS,

274
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,750
THEN YOU'RE SORELY MISTAKEN.

275
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,791
WE SIMPLY STUDIED
UNDER THE SAME MASTER

276
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,750
WHEN WE WERE YOUNG.
THAT WAS ALL.

277
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,791
- OH YEAH?

278
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,041
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WE'LL NEED HIS HELP. 

279
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,541
- WE CAN HANDLE HIM
ON OUR OWN.

280
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,166
TOGETHER, WE WILL
GIVE LAMIA SCALE 

281
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,958
ITS GREATEST VICTORY EVER.

282
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:58,500
NOW LET'S GET TO WORK.
- YEAH, OF COURSE.

283
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,125
- I'D BE CAREFUL
IF I WERE YOU.

284
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,208
LET YOUR ARROGANCE
GET THE BEST OF YOU,

285
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,750
AND YOU'RE SURE TO LOSE.

286
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,291
HA, IT'S NOT LIKE YOU
EVER HAD A CHANCE

287
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,000
OF BEATING ME, ANYWAY, RIGHT?

288
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,916
- NOW WHO'S BEING ARROGANT?

289
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,958
- MARIONETTE ATTACK!

290
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:16,125
ROCK DOLL!

291
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,500
- THAT'S A NEAT TRICK, GIRLIE,

292
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,500
BUT IT'S TOO SLOW
TO CATCH ME.

293
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,208
- IT'S PRACTICALLY
STANDING STILL.

294
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,833
- I CAN'T EVEN SEE HIM.

295
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,333
HOW ABOUT THIS?
GO, WOOD DOLL!

296
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,375
- YEAH, KEEP THROWING
THEM MY WAY.

297
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,791
IT'S TOTALLY POINTLESS.

298
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,208
- I WOULDN'T BE
SO SURE IF I WERE YOU.

299
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:37,333
- ( groans )
YOU GOT ME. 

300
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,208
- THERE'S NO WAY
HE BROKE FREE.

301
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,208
( screams )

302
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,625
- TOLD YOU, SWEETHEART!

303
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,958
- OVER HERE, SLOWPOKE.

304
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,500
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GETTING AT, PAL.

305
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,541
THE ONLY SLOWPOKE
HERE IS YOU.

306
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,083
- YOUR SPEED COUNTS FOR NOTHING

307
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,250
IF YOUR ATTACKS HAVE 
NO POWER BEHIND THEM.

308
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,083
I CAN PROVE YOU 
LACK THE ABILITY

309
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,625
TO LAND A DECISIVE BLOW.

310
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:01,708
- OH YEAH?

311
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,333
- LET'S SEE HOW YOU HANDLE THIS.

312
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,416
ICE MAKE: HEDGEHOG!

313
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,083
BETTER NOT GET TOO CLOSE OR 
YOU'LL END UP A SHISH KABOB.

314
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,916
WHAT'S THE MATTER, RACER?

315
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,250
ARE YOU AFRAID THAT
BELOVED SPEED OF YOURS

316
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,000
MIGHT GET YOU SKEWERED?
- DON'T GET COCKY, KID.

317
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,791
GEAR CHANGE: RED ZONE!

318
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,625
YOU'RE SO NAIVE.

319
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,791
DID YOU HONESTLY THINK
I'D USE MY FULL SPEED 

320
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:32,250
FROM THE GET-GO AGAINST
SUCH A WEAK OPPONENT?

321
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,166
- COME GET ME!
- YOU'RE ON!

322
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,833
- WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

323
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,416
- ( grunts, pants )

324
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,083
( grunts )

325
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,791
- ( pants )
 PLEASE, HANG ON, LYON.

326
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,375
- ( grunting )

327
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,833
- WHAT HAPPENED TO
ALL THAT BRAVADO? 

328
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,166
- ( screams )

329
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:59,750
- WOW, THAT KID MUST BE
A GLUTTON FOR PUNISHMENT.

330
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,833
- WHERE IS HE
RUNNING OFF TO NOW?

331
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:12,916
- ICE MAKE: EAGLE!

332
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,958
- WHEN ARE YOU GONNA REALIZE,
YOU CAN'T HIT ME?

333
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,208
DON'T TELL ME
THAT'S ALL YOU GOT.

334
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,166
MAN, WHAT A WASTE OF SPACE.

335
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,750
WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL
THE BIG TALK FROM BEFORE?

336
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,791
YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE
I DON'T HAVE THE POWER

337
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,458
TO LAND A DECISIVE BLOW?

338
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,958
WHY DON'T I SHOW YOU?

339
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:38,208
I DON'T NEED THAT POWER
TO PUT THE BRAKES ON THIS FIGHT.

340
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,666
AS QUICK AS I AM,
I COULD EASILY

341
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,583
TAKE YOU OUT BEFORE 
YOU COULD EVEN THINK

342
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,166
ABOUT USING ANY
SORT OF FANCY MAGIC.

343
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,500
I MEAN, DON'T GET ME WRONG.

344
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,375
YOU'VE GOT SERIOUS SKILLS, KID.
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE

345
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,416
IF YOU'D NEVER
CROSSED PATHS WITH ME.

346
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,000
BUT I'M ONE OF
THE ORACION SEIS.

347
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:58,958
- ( gull squawks )
- SIX DEMONS,

348
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,666
SIX PRAYERS,

349
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,208
SIX UNWAVERING PILLARS,

350
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,666
AND ANYONE WHO
TRIES TO CUT US OFF

351
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,458
WILL PAY THE FINAL TOLL
FOR THEIR DISRESPECT.

352
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:12,041
SO SAY GOOD-BYE.
- JUST AS I THOUGHT.

353
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,791
I FIGURED OUT THE TRUTH
BEHIND YOUR MAGIC

354
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,500
WHILE GRAY AND I
WERE FIGHTING TOGETHER.

355
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,291
I LOOKED UP AND NOTICED
THE BIRDS IN THE DISTANCE,

356
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,708
WERE FLYING INCREDIBLY FAST.

357
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,000
- ( gulps )

358
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,083
- YOU WERE NEVER
AS FAST AS LIGHTNING.

359
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,125
YOU JUST ALTERED OUR
PERCEPTION OF SPEED,

360
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,916
SO IT WOULD SEEM THAT WAY.

361
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
YOU SLOWED US DOWN,
THAT'S ALL.

362
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,875
ONCE I GOT OUTSIDE
THE PERIMETER OF YOUR MAGIC,

363
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,916
I REALIZED WHAT
WAS GOING ON.

364
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,416
DESPITE YOUR NAME,

365
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,166
YOU'RE JUST AS SLOW
AS THE REST OF US. 

366
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,208
I THOUGHT IT'D BE
HARDER TO DEFEAT YOU.

367
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,500
BUT NOW THAT YOU'VE FOLLOWED ME
ALL THE WAY OUT HERE,

368
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,333
GRAY IS OUTSIDE
THE PERIMETER OF YOUR MAGIC

369
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,416
AND CAN TAKE YOU DOWN.
- ( gasps )

370
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:57,083
- Lyon: HE SHOULD HAVE
A CLEAR SHOT FROM UP THERE.

371
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:03,166
- WAIT, SO YOU TWO
WEREN'T ARGUING.

372
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,291
YOU WERE GIVING HIM
A SNIPING POST.

373
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,833
- NOW THIS IS MORE LIKE IT.

374
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,291
FRESH AIR AND
A STATIONARY TARGET.

375
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,416
- THERE'S NO WAY
HE'LL HIT ME FROM THERE.

376
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,000
HE'S OVER A MILE AWAY.
- OH, HE CAN DO IT.

377
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,875
IF THERE'S ONE THING
THAT I'VE LEARNED,

378
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,958
IT'S TO NEVER UNDERESTIMATE

379
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,333
A MEMBER OF
THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD.

380
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,375
THERE'S NO STOPPING THEM.

381
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,166
- HERE GOES
SUPER FREEZING...

382
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,291
ARROW!

383
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,916
- IT'S SO FAST!

384
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,083
MY PRAYER...

385
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:44,250
TO BE FAST.

386
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:47,666
FASTER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

387
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,583
THAT'S ALL I WANT.

388
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,916
- Gray: I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT ACTUALLY WORKED.

389
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,708
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THERE ARE FIVE MORE

390
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,416
JUST AS STRONG AS HIM.
- ON ANOTHER NOTE,

391
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,041
COULD YOU PLEASE 
TRY TO INCLUDE ME

392
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,750
IN YOUR LITTLE RUSE,
NEXT TIME?

393
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:19,208
- DON'T BLAME ME.
HE'S THE MAN WITH THE PLAN.

394
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,583
- THANKS.

395
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:22,958
- CAN YOU STAND UP?

396
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,125
- I THINK I'LL SIT
A BIT LONGER.

397
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,500
- ( giggles )

398
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,791
- I'VE GOT YOU NOW!

399
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:33,125
IN THE NAME OF
THE MIGHTY ORACION SEIS,

400
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,958
I'M TAKING YOU
TO THE BIG SLAB IN THE SKY!

401
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,000
- ( slow beeping )

402
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,666
- Lyon: IS THAT WHAT
I THINK IT IS?

403
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,875
- HE'S RIGGED HIMSELF
WITH A BOMB LACRIMA. 

404
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,083
- SERIOUSLY? IS HE INSANE?

405
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,083
- WE'LL CROSS
THE FINISH LINE TOGETHER.

406
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,583
- NO WAY.
( grunts )

407
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,375
- ( laughs )
- IT'S NO USE.

408
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,250
I'M ON EMPTY.
WE'RE TOTALLY SCREWED!

409
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,041
- ( grunts )
- ( fast beeping )

410
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,250
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
- NO, LYON.

411
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,833
- ( beeping )

412
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,916
- GRAY...

413
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,166
I ALWAYS KNEW YOU'D
BE THE DEATH OF ME.

414
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,875
- Sherry: NO!

415
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,541
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING!

416
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:38,208
THERE'S NO WAY
HE'S GONE!

417
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:41,583
- LYON!

418
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,583
- ( groans )

419
00:21:56,666 --> 00:22:00,875
RACER'S STRUCK DOWN?
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

420
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,416
HOW COULD ONE OF
THE ORACION SEIS

421
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,375
BE DEFEATED LIKE THIS?

422
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:09,666
NO, IT SEEMS I HAVE
UNDERESTIMATED OUR ADVERSARIES.

423
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,250
I NEVER IMAGINED

424
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,750
I WOULD BE FORCED
TO SEND HIM.

425
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,041
WAKE UP, MIDNIGHT.

426
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,791
YOU HAVE WORK TO DO.

427
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,791
- ( groans )

428
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:31,416
- FIND OUR FOES AND TOSS 
THEM INTO YOUR NIGHTMARE.

429
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,416
- ( end theme playing )

430
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,125
- YES, FATHER.

431
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,541
- ( singing in Japanese )

432
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,833
- Happy: MAN, I'M JEALOUS.

433
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:16,166
I WISH I COULD BREATHE FIRE
LIKE YOU, NATSU.

434
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,291
- Natsu: WHY? YOU WANT TO FRY
BADDIES TOO?

435
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,916
- NO, TO FRY FISH, DUMMY.

436
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,583
AND LIGHT UP ANY DARK PLACES
I MIGHT CRAWL INTO.

437
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:24,708
- WHY DON'T YOU TRY
EATING SOME OF MY FIRE?

438
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:27,083
I MEAN, IT WORKS FOR ME.
GO AHEAD, EAT UP.

439
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,500
- NAH, I'LL PASS.
HOT FOODS

440
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,333
TEND TO GIVE ME HEARTBURN.

441
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:33,291
- ( Happy and Natsu speaking ) 

442
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:35,458
- Natsu: COME ON, JUST TRY SOME.
WHO KNOWS,

443
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:36,750
MAYBE CARLA WILL LIKE YOU
IF YOU CAN BREATHE FIRE. 

444
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:39,125
- YOU THINK SO?
OKAY, DOWN THE HATCH.

445
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:41,083
- PLOP.
- Happy: ( screams )
