1
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,250
HEY GUYS!  READY FOR
SOME MORE "FAIRY TAIL"?

2
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,000
JUST MAKE SURE
THAT WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING,

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,041
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE ROOM,

4
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,875
AND DON'T SIT TOO CLOSE
TO THE TV!

5
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:29,000
- Mirajane:
PREVIOUSLY, ON "FAIRY TAIL"...

6
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:31,958
- Lucy: SOME BIG THINGS HAPPENED
IN THE BATTLE OF FAIRY TAIL.

7
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,958
ERZA BEAT EVERGREEN
AND ALL OF US GIRLS

8
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,625
THAT WERE TURNED INTO STATUES
ARE FINALLY BACK TO NORMAL.

9
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,791
BUT BEFORE WE HAD THE CHANCE
TO CELEBRATE,

10
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:41,000
THAT JERK LAXUS
CAST HIS THUNDER PALACE SPELL

11
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,708
AND TOOK
THE WHOLE TOWN HOSTAGE.

12
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,500
NOW IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO JOIN THE FIGHT!

13
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,375
- ( theme music playing )

14
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,500
- ( singing in Japanese )

15
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:24,791
- AHHH!

16
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,250
- WOW!

17
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,375
- HE PUNCHED HIM
WITH A LION MADE OF LIGHT!

18
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:31,208
- IT'S TOTALLY POINTLESS.
THESE ARE SOULS, MAN.

19
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,750
YOU CAN'T HURT 'EM.
YOU CAN DESTROY THEIR BODIES,

20
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:36,333
BUT I'LL JUST MOVE 'EM
ON TO SOMETHING ELSE.

21
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,083
THAT MEANS
I GET NEW BABIES!

22
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,208
- All: YEAH!

23
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,708
- YOU COULD SEND A MILLION
OF THOSE THINGS,

24
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,166
I WON'T LET
ANY OF 'EM TOUCH HER!

25
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,208
- COME ON!
- AYE, SIR!

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,875
- WHOA!

27
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:56,125
YOU'RE A FEISTY
LITTLE CHEERLEADER, AIN'T YA?

28
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,750
- I AM NOT A CHEERLEADER!

29
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,791
- LUCY,
GO ON AND TAKE HIM OUT!

30
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,458
HE'S NOTHING!
YOU'RE STRONGER THAN HIM!

31
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,166
- HEY, MAN,
TAKE THAT BACK!

32
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,958
AW, CRAP.

33
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,958
TIME FOR THE BIG GUNS.

34
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,333
- BIG GUNS?
- UH-OH!

35
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,500
- ( neck cracks )

36
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,083
- ( Happy speaking )

37
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:24,166
- FIGURE EYES.

38
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,000
- Happy: DON'T LOOK INTO 'EM.

39
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,750
EACH ONE
OF THE THUNDER LEGION MEMBERS

40
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,041
HAS SPECIAL POWERS
THEY CAN USE IN THEIR EYES.

41
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,541
EVERGREEN CAN TURN YOU
INTO STONE WITH HERS.

42
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,250
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT BIXLOW,

43
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,125
HE'LL TURN YOU INTO ONE
OF HIS CREEPY DOLLS.

44
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,333
HE'LL CONTROL YOUR SOUL. 
- REALLY?

45
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:40,875
- NO WAY!

46
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:44,250
- WELL, AREN'T YOU SMART?
- All: SO SMART!

47
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,000
- Happy: WHATEVER YOU DO,
KEEP YOUR EYES CLOSED!

48
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,083
- ( Bixlow laughing )

49
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,500
MY POSSESSION AND FIGURE
EYES COMBO IS UNBEATABLE

50
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,375
AND YOU GUYS WON'T EVEN
GIVE IT SO MUCH AS A LOOK?

51
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:59,333
COME ON!
- LUCY, CLOSE MY GATE

52
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,416
AND HIDE INSIDE OF HOROLOGIUM
FOR A WHILE!

53
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
- YEAH, GREAT IDEA,
BUT MY KEYS WERE STOLEN

54
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,416
SO I CAN'T SUMMON HIM.

55
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,250
NOW COME ON!

56
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:12,041
I KNOW YOU CAN HELP ME,
SO JUST DO IT ALREADY!

57
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,875
- ALL RIGHT,
IT'S THE MOMENT OF TRUTH.

58
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,750
WHEN I GIVE THE SIGNAL,
OPEN YOUR EYES

59
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,458
AND HIT HIM
AS HARD AS YOU CAN.

60
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,291
- BUT I THOUGHT I WAS SUPPOSED
TO KEEP 'EM CLOSED.

61
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,333
- YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO TRUST ME.

62
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,291
- I TRUST YOU.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,250
- THE ZENITH OF REGULUS!

64
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,250
LION BRILLIANCE!

65
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,000
- AH!  MY EYES.

66
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,791
- NOW, LUCY!
- OKAY!

67
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,625
( grunting )

68
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,791
- NO!  THERE'S NO WAY
I'M GONNA LET YOU BEAT ME!

69
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:46,333
- Loke: I'M NOT THE MAN
I USED TO BE.

70
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,250
WHEN I MET LUCY,

71
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:51,541
MY TRUE POWER AS A CELESTIAL
SPIRIT WAS AWAKENED.

72
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,166
I'M STRONGER
THAN I'VE EVER BEEN BEFORE

73
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,500
AND IT'S ALL THANKS TO HER.

74
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,166
WE SPIRITS ARE NOT
LIKE YOUR LITTLE DOLLS.

75
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,250
LOVE MAKES US STRONGER.

76
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,333
REGULUS IMPACT!

77
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,583
AHHH!

78
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,291
- ( screams )

79
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,833
- KAPOW!

80
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,500
- THANKS, LOKE.

81
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:24,333
- I DID IT FOR THIS.

82
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:28,958
LOVE'S DAZZLING BRILLIANCE. 
- Lucy: UH, COOL.

83
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,166
- WHEN'S THE WEDDING?

84
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,041
- YEAH,
DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH, CAT.

85
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,583
OH, MAN.
I'M SO BEAT.

86
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:40,166
- OPENING UP TWO ZODIAC GATES
WOULD TAKE A LOT OUT OF SOMEONE.

87
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,750
- I'LL BE THERE ANYTIME
THAT YOU NEED ME.

88
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:44,916
- AW, THANKS.

89
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,208
- WHOA, LUCY KICKED HIS BUTT.
- NO WAY!

90
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,458
THAT LITTLE PRINCESS
CAN ACTUALLY FIGHT?

91
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,875
- YEAH, SHE'S TOUGH AS NAILS.

92
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,000
- SHE'S JUST A CHEERLEADER!

93
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,000
- WAY TO GO, LUCY.
- WELL, THEY CAN BE TOUGH.

94
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,250
- I AM RIGHT THERE WITH YA.
- YEAH RIGHT,

95
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,000
I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE! -
REALLY? YOU'VE NEVER HEARD

96
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,041
THE STORY OF THE TORTOISE
AND THE CHEERLEADER?

97
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,833
- IT WAS A HARE, YA MORON!

98
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,833
AND THE DUMB BUNNY LOST,
REMEMBER?

99
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,541
- I STILL DON'T GET THIS PART
AT ALL.

100
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:14,250
IF ONLY I COULD
JUST REWORD IT. ( groans )

101
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,625
COME ON LEVY, THINK.

102
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,750
AH!  THAT'S IT!
- Both: WHAT'S WHAT?

103
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,416
- I NEED TO LOOK
AT THESE TWO GRAMMAR STYLES

104
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,833
LIKE THE TORTOISE
AND THE HARE

105
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,833
AND TRANSLATE THEM
AT TWO DIFFERENT RATES.

106
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,083
IF I TAKE THE INTEGRAL NUMBER
OF SYNCHRONIZED LETTERS

107
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,625
IN A SINGLE PASS AND TRANSFORM
THEM INTO GEEL GRAMMAR,

108
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:33,125
AND THEN TRANSLATE THAT
INTO LOGUE...

109
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,125
IT WORKED!

110
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,333
- Both: YEAH!

111
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,208
- JUST GIVE ME A SECOND, I NEED
TO REWRITE THE ENCHANTMENT.

112
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,083
-YOU BET.

113
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,375
- THIS IS IT, YOU GUYS.

114
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,208
WHEN I'M THROUGH HERE,

115
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,333
YOU TWO'LL JOIN
THE BATTLE OF FAIRY TAIL.

116
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,500
I HOPE YOU'RE READY.

117
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,583
- YEAH, I'M ALL FIRED UP!

118
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,833
- IT'S TIME
TO TAKE OUT THE TRASH.

119
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,833
- THANK GOODNESS.

120
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,541
- MIRA.

121
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,916
- YOU'RE HURT PRETTY BAD.

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,416
- I'LL BE FINE.

123
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,375
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE BACK
TO NORMAL.

124
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:16,208
- I'M SORRY FOR EVERYTHING.
I REALLY AM.

125
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:20,000
- WHAT THE HECK
ARE YOU APOLOGIZING FOR?

126
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:24,416
- BECAUSE I'M JUST USELESS NOW.

127
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,416
IT'S THE TRUTH.

128
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,833
I'M NEVER ABLE TO HELP YOU.

129
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,291
I'M SORRY.

130
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:35,083
- NO ONE THINKS YOU'RE USELESS.
I PROMISE.

131
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:38,041
YOUR SMILE
LIFTS EVERYONE'S SPIRITS.

132
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,250
IT MAKES US THINK
OF THE GOOD THINGS

133
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,000
AND FORGET
ABOUT THIS FIGHTING CRAP.

134
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,625
- ( whimpering )

135
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,958
- COME ON, SIS.

136
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,958
PLEASE DON'T CRY.

137
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,458
- Cana: JUVIA.

138
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,916
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG
WE HAVE

139
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,791
BEFORE THE THUNDER PALACE
ACTIVATES?

140
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,166
- AT THIS POINT, I'D SAY
IT'S ABOUT 30 MINUTES.

141
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,625
- MAN, WHAT A COWARD.

142
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,625
THE BATTLE OF FAIRY TAIL, HUH?

143
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,083
EVERYONE ELSE FIGHTS
WHILE HE HIDES IN A CORNER?

144
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,916
- THE QUESTION
IS WHICH CORNER?

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,208
- Fried: LAXUS IS SAVING
HIS MAGIC ENERGY.

146
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:21,750
IT WOULD BE FOOLISH OF HIM
TO FIGHT MASTER MAKAROV

147
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,833
AT LESS THAN FULL POWER.

148
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,708
- Cana: FRIED.

149
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,666
- Juvia: SO HE'S THE ONE
WHO'S BEHIND THE ENCHANTMENTS.

150
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,375
- GET BACK HERE!

151
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,375
WHERE'D HE GO?

152
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,833
- OH, GREAT.
ANOTHER ONE?

153
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,708
- WE'RE TRAPPED.

154
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,250
- IT SAYS, "ONLY THE WIZARD

155
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,375
WHO PROVES HERSELF
TO BE THE STRONGEST--"

156
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,166
- "--WILL BE PERMITTED TO LEAVE
THIS BARRIER."

157
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,916
- THE VICTOR WILL THEN GO ON
TO BATTLE ME.

158
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,583
YOU MAY BEGIN.
- COME ON, FRIED!

159
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,583
IF YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING
FOR A FIGHT,

160
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,458
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO
THROUGH ALL THIS TROUBLE,

161
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,458
'CAUSE I'LL TAKE YOU ON
RIGHT NOW, YOU HEAR?

162
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,458
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
ARE YOU SCARED?

163
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,250
DON'T THINK YOU'RE MAN ENOUGH
TO HANDLE THE BOTH OF US?

164
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:08,458
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN MUCH
OF A REAL MAN, HAVE YOU?

165
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,500
- THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER
IS I'D PREFER

166
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,833
NOT TO SULLY MY OWN HANDS.
- YOU'RE SUCH A RAT!

167
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,708
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D MAKE YOUR
FRIENDS FIGHT EACH OTHER

168
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:19,958
LIKE THIS.

169
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,916
- "FRIENDS", YOU SAY?
TO BE PERFECTLY CANDID,

170
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,500
I'D RATHER SEE CANA
EMERGE THE VICTOR.

171
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,875
AS FOR JUVIA,

172
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,250
YOU STILL BEAR THE STAIN
OF PHANTOM LORD.

173
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,916
YOU CAN'T BE TRUSTED.

174
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,666
THERE'S NO TELLING
WHEN YOU MAY CHOOSE

175
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,666
TO TAKE UP ARMS
AGAINST FAIRY TAIL AGAIN.

176
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,125
- WHAT, LIKE YOU ARE NOW?
- FORGIVE ME.

177
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,333
BUT I'VE NO OTHER CHOICE.

178
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,291
- HOLD ON.
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

179
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,000
- Juvia: TELL ME SOMETHING,
MR. FRIED.

180
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,583
IF ONE OF US FALLS,

181
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,833
WILL YOU KEEP YOUR WORD
AND FIGHT THE ONE THAT REMAINS?

182
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,916
- I ASSURE YOU,
I'LL STAND BY MY WORD.

183
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,833
- THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.

184
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,500
- ARE YOU NUTS?

185
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,875
YOU'RE JUST GIVING
THIS CREEP WHAT HE WANTS!

186
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,625
- Fried:
GO AS HIGH AS YOU WANT!

187
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,250
THE ONLY WAY TO ESCAPE

188
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,166
IS BY STEPPING
OVER YOUR FALLEN OPPONENT.

189
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,541
IF ONE OF US MUST FALL
FOR THIS SPELL TO BE LIFTED,

190
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,625
I WILL BE THE ONE
TO MAKE IT SO!

191
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,458
- SHE WOULDN'T.
- STAY AWAY FROM THAT THING!

192
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,833
- I'LL NEVER HARM A FRIEND!

193
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,625
- JUVIA!

194
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,625
- ( screaming )

195
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,375
- JUVIA!

196
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:46,000
- I BROKE
THE ENCHANTMENT SPELL.

197
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,625
YOU ARE FREE NOW.

198
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,208
- BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
GO AND DO THAT.

199
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:53,333
- I WANTED
TO PROVE TO THE GUILD

200
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,541
THAT THERE'S NO REASON
TO DOUBT ME.

201
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,125
I LOVE ALL OF YOU.

202
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,333
THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD

203
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,958
WILL ALWAYS BE MY HOME.

204
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,041
- I NEVER DOUBTED YOU.

205
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:09,708
YOU'RE ONE OF US NOW.
AND YOU ALWAYS WILL BE.

206
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,916
WE LOVE YOU
JUST LIKE FAMILY.

207
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,708
FAIRY TAIL'S LUCKY TO HAVE SUCH
AN AMAZING WIZARD IN ITS RANKS.

208
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,916
- DO YOU MEAN IT?

209
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,833
THAT MAKES ME SO HAPPY.

210
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:26,375
- JUVIA!

211
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,291
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

212
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,500
SHE CHOSE TO SACRIFICE
HER OWN LIFE

213
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,416
IN ORDER TO SAVE HER FRIEND?

214
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,208
- LET'S GO!

215
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:45,250
- AW, MAN.
THERE'S WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE.

216
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:48,208
I CAN'T PICK UP LAXUS' SCENT
WITH THEM AROUND.

217
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,250
- NOW, GUYS,
I WANT YOU TO LISTEN CLOSELY.

218
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,000
WE CAN'T RISK
THE TWO OF YOU

219
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,125
GETTING CAUGHT UP
IN ONE OF FRIED'S ENCHANTMENTS,

220
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,708
SO YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO SEPARATE.

221
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,833
GOT IT?

222
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:01,958
- Gajeel: I WANNA SETTLE
THE SCORE WITH SALAMANDER

223
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,583
SO BAD I CAN TASTE IT.
BUT THAT LIGHTNING IDIOT

224
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,916
HAS REALLY BEEN
WORKIN' MY LAST NERVE LATELY,

225
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,416
SO HE'S MY PRIORITY FOR NOW.

226
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,375
IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU,
MASTER IVAN?

227
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,375
- Ivan: OF COURSE, MY BOY.

228
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:20,083
EARNING THE TRUST OF MAKAROV
AND THE OTHERS IS PARAMOUNT.

229
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:23,458
WE MUST NOT LET SUSPICION
CREEP INTO THEIR MINDS.

230
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,541
REMEMBER TO ALWAYS ACT
AS THOUGH

231
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,875
YOUR HEART AND SOUL
BELONG TO FAIRY TAIL.

232
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,791
- Gajeel: AS FAR AS THEY KNOW,
I'M A TEAM PLAYER.

233
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,083
- WE HAVE AMPLE TIME
BEFORE THE HAMMER DROPS

234
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:37,833
ON THAT SORRY EXCUSE
FOR A GUILD.

235
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,958
- YES, SIR.

236
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,291
- OH, COME ON, MIRA.
I'M STILL A MAN.

237
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,250
I CAN WALK ON MY OWN,
YOU KNOW.

238
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,625
- IT'S OKAY, IF MY BABY BROTHER
NEEDS A HAND,

239
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:02,000
I DON'T MIND HELPING AT ALL.
- THANK YOU.

240
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:09,166
- YOU SEEM TO BE FORGETTING
A BASIC RULE OF COMBAT.

241
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,833
- WHAT'S THAT?

242
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,750
- EVEN THE MOST POWERFUL SPELLS
ARE ULTIMATELY WORTHLESS

243
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,541
IF THEY FAIL
TO HIT YOUR TARGET.

244
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:18,750
- CARD MAGIC!
HEAVEN!  REVERSE DEATH!

245
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:22,458
MOUNTAIN!
SUMMONED LIGHTNING!

246
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,416
- DARK ECRITURE REPEL!

247
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,375
- AHHHH!

248
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:35,375
- Elfman: WHAT IN THE--
- OH NO, CANA!

249
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,625
- YOU'RE TOUGH.

250
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,458
A TRUE TESTAMENT TO YOUR MANY
YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE GUILD.

251
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,625
- LISTEN TO ME, FRIED.

252
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:48,375
I WANT YOU TO TAKE BACK ALL THAT
GARBAGE YOU SAID ABOUT JUVIA.

253
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,625
AHHH!
- CANA!

254
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,708
- WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT DID HE DO TO HER?

255
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,125
- ( Cana moaning )

256
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,375
- THIS HAS GONE TOO FAR!
- HOW DARE YOU?

257
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,875
- I'M SORRY, ELFMAN, BUT YOU'VE
ALREADY LOST TO EVERGREEN.

258
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,166
THEREFORE, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED
TO REJOIN THE GAME.

259
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,458
- OH, YEAH?
- WE'RE IN THE SAME GUILD!

260
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,583
WE SHOULDN'T BE FIGHTING
EACH OTHER.

261
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,250
- WE WERE ONCE.

262
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,958
HOWEVER, THE ULTIMATE PURPOSE
OF THIS GAME

263
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:20,166
IS TO RESTRUCTURE THE GUILD,
TO BREAK OUR MEANINGLESS BONDS.

264
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,125
LAXUS' ENEMY
IS MINE AS WELL.

265
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,958
- I'M READY
TO TAKE ON BOTH OF YA!

266
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,625
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

267
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,833
- THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DEFEATED
ARE STRICTLY PROHIBITED

268
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,625
FROM RE-JOINING THE GAME.

269
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,625
ANYONE WHO DARES ATTEMPT
TO DO SO

270
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,916
WILL RECEIVE A PUNISHMENT
FAR WORSE THAN DEATH.

271
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,875
DARK ECRITURE PAIN!

272
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,458
THOSE RUNES REPRESENT
UNIMAGINABLE PAIN

273
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,916
WHICH WILL BECOME
THE TOTALITY OF YOUR EXISTENCE.

274
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,958
- OH! AHHHH!

275
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,458
- ELFMAN!

276
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,958
YOU HAVE TO STOP THIS!

277
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,750
HE'S NOT AS STRONG
AS HE USED TO BE, FRIED!

278
00:14:57,041 --> 00:15:00,375
- DARK ECRITURE TERROR!

279
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:05,250
SUFFERING!
- AHHHH!

280
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,375
- ( crying )

281
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,208
I'M BEGGING YOU.

282
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:12,041
I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WANT.

283
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,708
PLEASE, JUST SPARE HIM!

284
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,083
- ( screaming )

285
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:23,000
- NO!

286
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,708
- THE FINAL DARK ECRITURE.

287
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,333
DEATH.

288
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,958
- DEATH?

289
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,416
- ( growling )

290
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,958
- DON'T BE AFRAID,
BIG BROTHER.

291
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,750
WE STILL LOVE YOU.

292
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,625
- LISANNA!

293
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,833
- Lisanna: I FEEL SO STRANGE.

294
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,958
IT'S LIKE I--
I CAN'T MOVE.

295
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,500
- DON'T WASTE YOUR STRENGTH.

296
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,791
- WHERE'D YOU GO?
MIRA?

297
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,916
- I'M RIGHT HERE.

298
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,583
- MIRA-- I--

299
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,208
I JUST...

300
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,583
WANT YOU TO KNOW--

301
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,416
- LISANNA?

302
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,125
LISANNA?
LISANNA!

303
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,750
- WHAT'S THIS?
SO MUCH POWER.

304
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,875
HOW IS SHE--

305
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,875
- ( wailing )

306
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:55,750
( wailing continues )

307
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,416
- DARK ECRITURE WINGS!

308
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,750
- DIE.

309
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,791
- THIS IS HER TAKE OVER POWER.

310
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:41,791
THE SHE-DEVIL:
SATAN SOUL.

311
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,375
- DARKNESS STREAM!

312
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,250
DARK ECRI--

313
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,708
I KNOW A FEW FORBIDDEN SPELLS
OF MY OWN.

314
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,625
EVIL BATTLES EVIL!

315
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,416
DARK ECRITURE!

316
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,541
DARKNESS!

317
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,166
( growling )

318
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,375
- EVIL SPARK!

319
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:40,416
- IT'S TRUE.
HER POWER'S UNCANNY.

320
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,125
I'D HEARD TALES
OF HER ABILITIES,

321
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:47,000
BUT I NEVER WOULD'VE THOUGHT
MIRAJANE WAS CAPABLE OF THIS.

322
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,166
YOU'RE STRONG,

323
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,541
BUT I CAN'T AFFORD
TO LOSE THE GAME TO YOU.

324
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,541
AHHH!

325
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,500
DARKNESS BREATH!

326
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,500
DARKNESS FLASH BOMB!

327
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,625
IS SHE FINISHED?

328
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:10,291
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

329
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,666
SHE'S CONTROLLING THE WATER.

330
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,708
JUST HOW POWERFUL IS SHE?

331
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:23,083
- EVIL EXPLOSION!

332
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,750
SOUL EXTINCTION.

333
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:36,666
- ( screaming )

334
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,333
- FRIED!  DIE!

335
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,541
- THERE'S NO WAY.

336
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,583
I DON'T STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST SUCH A FORCE.

337
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,416
- Lisanna: WE STILL LOVE YOU.

338
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:18,208
- ( panting )

339
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:36,916
- Fried: I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHY DID YOU STOP?

340
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:43,500
- BECAUSE THIS BATTLE
IS MEANINGLESS.

341
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,666
- YOU CAN SPARE ME
YOUR FALSE PITY, MIRA.

342
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,083
JUST FINISH ME OFF.

343
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,750
- I WON'T DO THAT
BECAUSE WE'RE ALLIES.

344
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,916
WE'RE BOTH MEMBERS
OF FAIRY TAIL.

345
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
THAT MEANS WE WORK TOGETHER,

346
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,583
WE CELEBRATE TOGETHER,

347
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,666
AND WE GROW TOGETHER.
- NO, YOU'RE WRONG!

348
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,250
LAXUS IS MY ONLY TRUE ALLY!

349
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,375
- IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE THAT WAY.

350
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:12,625
LISTEN, WE'VE BEEN YOUR FRIENDS
SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING.

351
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:15,625
IT'S PERFECTLY FINE
TO HAVE THAT ONE PERSON

352
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,166
WHO YOU TRUST
MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

353
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,416
IT'S HUMAN NATURE.

354
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,291
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE
TO SHUT OUT THE REST OF US.

355
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:27,208
WE'RE ALL PART OF SOMETHING
BIGGER. WE'RE LIKE FAMILY.

356
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,250
IF YOU'LL JUST REACH OUT,

357
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,250
I PROMISE THERE'LL ALWAYS
BE SOMEONE THERE FOR YOU.

358
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:40,625
ONCE YOU'RE FINALLY ABLE
TO SEE THAT CONNECTION,

359
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:44,041
YOU'LL NEVER FORGET
THAT IT'S THERE.

360
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:48,000
YOU'RE SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE
WHO CARE FOR YOU.

361
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:04,500
- I NEVER WANTED IT
TO COME TO THIS.

362
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,583
- YEAH, I KNOW THAT.

363
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:10,166
HOW ABOUT NEXT YEAR,

364
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:14,416
WE ENJOY
THE HARVEST FESTIVAL TOGETHER?

365
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,500
- MY SIS.

366
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,250
- SHE'S AMAZING, HUH?

367
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:27,416
"FRIED VERSUS MIRAJANE.
BOTH WIZARDS FORFEIT."

368
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:32,750
- THIS GAME
JUST GOT INTERESTING.

369
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:34,916
- NOW, THERE'S JUST ONE.

370
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,708
I'M COMIN' FOR YA, LAXUS!

371
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,500
- ( end theme playing )

372
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:49,333
- ( singing in Japenese )

373
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,666
- SO IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO FIGHT LAXUS, HUH?

374
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,208
- YEAH.
AND I'M ALL FIRED UP!

375
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:21,250
- UM, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
SIT THIS ONE OUT.

376
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,208
I MEAN, ISN'T IT
USUALLY SUPPOSED TO BE

377
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:25,333
UP TO THE MAIN CHARACTER
TO BEAT THE FINAL BOSS?

378
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:28,708
- WHAT DO YA MEAN? IF I'M NOT
THE MAIN CHARACTER, THEN WHO IS?

379
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:30,875
YOU?
- I AM A NATURAL.

380
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:33,625
- ( Happy and Natsu speaking )

381
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,916
- HEY, MAN,
THIS IS MY SHOW TOO!

382
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,250
YOU CAN'T JUST GO DECIDIN'
YOU'RE THE MAIN CHARACTER.

383
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:40,125
- Happy: I'M SORRY BUT THE FANS
HAVE SPOKEN

384
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:42,250
AND EVIDENTLY I HAVE
MORE OF THEM THAN YOU DO.
