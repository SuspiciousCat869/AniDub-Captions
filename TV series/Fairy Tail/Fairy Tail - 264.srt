[IGNEEL] We'll finish
this discussion later.

168

You just worry about
getting that book.

169
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,291
Dad, come back!

170
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,291
What does he want? A book?

171
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,333
Which one?

172
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:55,250
[GRAY]
This is what he wants, isn't it?

173
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,250
The Book of E.N.D.

174
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,666
Hand it over.

175
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,708
I made a promise, too.

176
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,791
That I would do whatever
it took to defeat E.N.D.

177

This ain't about you.

178
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,541
[ACNOLOGIA]
So that was the reason you chose

179
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,333
to stay with the humans.

180
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,958
You wanted to keep them
from turning into me!

181

[IGNEEL]
What do you want?

182
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,541
It's over now.

183
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,125
E.N.D. is gone!

184
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,291
You have no reason
to fear them anymore!

185
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,666
[IGNEEL]
Why don't you leave them alone?

186
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,125
[ACNOLOGIA]
Oh, come now.

187
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,541
You don't really think I feared

188
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,125
one of Zeref's pathetic
demons, do you?

189
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,666
That's ridiculous.

For I am Acnologia.

191
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,208
[IGNEEL] But, don't forget,
you were once a human.

192
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,666
I will not stand by, and let
these other Dragon Slayers

193
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,166
meet the same fate.

194

[ACNOLOGIA] It doesn't
matter where you stand.

195
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,541
I'll still destroy you.

00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,458
Just like I'll destroy them.

[NATSU gasping]
Dad, where are you?!

265
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,750
[IGNEEL]
I owe you an explanation.

266
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,291
And I'm going to give it
to you while I still can.

267
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,625
So try not to interrupt
me this time.

268
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,125
As I mentioned before,

269
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:32,875
there were two reasons we stayed
inside the Dragon Slayers.

270
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,833
The first was to create
antibodies within you.

271
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:40,041
To keep you from ever undergoing
any physical transformation.

272
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,625
Thankfully, that process
was successful

273
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,708
and you will never experience
the dragon-ification

274
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,041
that Acnologia once did.

275
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,333
[GRAY]
Where are you going?!

276
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,750
[IGNEEL] The process of
creating these antibodies was

277
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,708
very delicate and required
all of our energy.

278
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,750
That's why we never made
our presence known to you.

279
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,416
And now the other reason.

280
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,791
We were waiting for the perfect
time to fix our mistakes.

281
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,875
It was our destructive legacy

282
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,333
that brought Acnologia
to this world,

283
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:12,541
and we wanted be the ones
to personally eliminate him.

No!

a little longer!

287
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,458
We're gonna take him
down side by side.

288
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:23,125
[IGNEEL] No! This isn't
your fight, Natsu!

than we imagined.

You must stay away.

291

That is an order!

292
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,708
[NATSU]
I don't care!

293
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:34,333
You left me once, and I'm not
gonna let you leave me again!

Whoa! That was a close one, Dad!

325
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,250
[IGNEEL]
You better brace yourself.

326
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,041
Cause we're just
getting started!

327
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,250
Ya ready son?

328
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,166
Hey! We made it
and I didn't fall.

329
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,291
Let's go again!

330
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,875
[IGNEEL laughs]
You asked for it!

331
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:42,208
[NATSU] Hah! There's no way
you can knock me off!

332
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,166
[NATSU]
Hey, Dad, watch this!

333
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,666
Here goes!

334
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:52,416
Fire Dragon... Roar!

335
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,416
Whaddya think?

336
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,333
[IGNEEL]
You call that a roar?

337
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,416
You couldn't even
cook a fish with that!

338
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,000
Then let's see you do it!

339
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,458
[IGNEEL]
All right, then.

340
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,250
Fire Dragon... Roar!

341
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,583
[NATSU gasping]

342
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,458
[NATSU]
Thought you said

343
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,916
we weren't supposed to
wreck the mountains.

344
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,875
[IGNEEL] Sometimes it's okay
to go a little overboard.

345
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,541
[IGNEEL laughs]

346
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,041
Now it's my turn!

347
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,166
Will you teach me
how to do that, too?

348
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,541
[IGNEEL]
You already know.

349
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,791
The key is to always keep
a fire in your belly.

350
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,000
[NATSU]
That's easy!

351
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:33,125
[snoring]

352
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,166
[IGNEEL]
Natsu.

353
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,416
I'm so proud of the wizard
that you've become.

354
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,291
Driven, loyal, and strong.

355
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:02,208
Those years I spent with you
were the happiest of my life.

356
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,958
[IGNEEL] You might think
I was the one who taught

357
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:13,250
you everything, but you
were my greatest teacher.

358
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:23,000
[IGNEEL] Because you
taught me how to love.

359
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,208
Never forget that.

360
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:31,958
[whimpering]

361
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:38,000
[NATSU]
Dad, no!

362
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,750
[LUCY]
The battle is finally over.

363
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:17,458
And although Fairy Tail
has emerged victorious,

364
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:20,250
it comes at a great,
irreplaceable cost.

365
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,375
As the dragons reveal
the shocking truth

366
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:24,458
in the ruins of this
barren wasteland,

367
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:27,666
Natsu sheds what seems to be
an endless stream of tears,

368
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,916
etching his father's
unforgettable words

369
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,458
into his broken heart.

370
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:33,958
Next Time:

371
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:37,791
"Tartaros Chapter, Finale
Where the Power of Life Lies."

372
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:41,833
All that remains, is the
drive to keep living.
