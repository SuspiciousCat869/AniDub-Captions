00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:28,416
[NARRATOR] The fighting between
Natsu and Mard Geer intensifies.

2
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,250
As does the bombastic battle
between Igneel and Acnologia.

3
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,125
[NARRATOR] Natsu receives
some timely reinforcement

4
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:41,666
from Sting and Rogue.

5
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,833
Together, the Dragon Slayers
launch a three pronged assault

6
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,458
against The King
of the Underworld.

7
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:56,000
Now! Lightning Flame
Dragon Firing Hammer!

[NATSU gasps]

9
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,666
[NARRATOR] Newly reunited
with Lucy and the others,

10
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,416
Wendy and company reveal
that the threat of Face

11
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,708
is far greater than they
had previously assumed.

12
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:22,291
In fact, the anti-magic pulse
bombs number in the thousands.

13
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,750
The group decides that their
best course of action

14
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:26,916
would be to tell the
wizards of other guilds

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,500
what's been happening,
and seek their assistance.

16
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:31,083
But this plan is hindered

17
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:34,041
by the short range of
Warren's telepathy.

18
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:36,208
Just as the group
begins to despair

19
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:39,666
that there is nothing they can
do to stop the Face's countdown,

20
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,500
Makarov intervenes.

21
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:45,708
[MAKAROV] We can use Fairy
Tail's ultimate weapon:

22
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:48,833
The Lumen Histoire.

23
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,041
[LUCY]
The Lumen Histoire?

24
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,875
[WENDY]
I've never heard of it.

25
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,708
We don't have time for me
to explain everything.

26
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,208
All of you should meet me
at the guild, right now.

27
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,750
[LUCY] Some of us are still
fighting. Can't we help them?

28
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:58,958
[DROY]
What guild?

29
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,625
I mean, there's
nothing left of it.

30
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:01,833
Don't mention that.

31

[ELFMAN grunts]

32
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:07,083
I'm underneath the
guild. Get moving!

33
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,500
[LUCY] Whatever he's talking
about, he sounds serious.

34
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:16,791
[WENDY]
Then let's be quick.

35
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,041
I won't be coming.

36
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,416
He wanted all of us!

37
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,833
Why would you stay?

38
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,750
What do you think you're doing?

39
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,541
[ELFMAN] Why'd you
have to come here?

40
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:32,125
Now I can't let you leave!
This is what I have to do!

41
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,375
[CANA]
Is it a bomb?

42
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,875
[ELFMAN]
This is goodbye!

43
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,791
This is the end for Fairy Tail!

[ELFMAN grunts]

46
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,500
[CANA] Is he under some
kind of spell? What do I do?

47
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,708
I do not blame you for
the guild's destruction,

48
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,000
nor should anybody else.

49
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,041
[DROY]
Right! That isn't on you, man.

00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,291
It was Tartaros!

[LISANNA]
You did it for me!

52

[JET]
Don't beat yourself up.

53
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,833
I bet I'd've done the same
thing if they'd taken Levy.

54
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,166
That's nice of you, but still.

55
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,541
[MAKAROV]
I understand.

56
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,083
Do what you think is right.

57
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,291
But master...

58
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,958
We can't just leave him
here all by himself!

59
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,083

You come, too.

[DORANBOLT]
Private telepathy?

62
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,708
Why? I'm not part of your guild.

63
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,375
[MAKAROV] No, but I'm
in need of your power.

64
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,916
[DORANBOLT]
For what?

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,875
[MAKAROV] The Lumen Histoire is
the guild's greatest secret.

66
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:39,958
Should we prevail,

67
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll need you to
erase its existence

68
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,208
from everyone's memory.

69
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,541
[DORANBOLT]
I see.

70
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,250
You're asking me to erase
my own memories, too.

71
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:52,833
[MAKAROV] I am. But I'm certain
you would do so regardless.

72
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,666
[LUCY]
Let's get moving.

73
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,958
[LISANNA] Are you sure you
won't change your mind?

74
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,125
[ELFMAN]
Yeah.

75
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,375
Uh? You're coming with
us though, right?

76
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,583
Oh, uh. Yeah, sure.

77
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,375
[DORANBOLT]
I don't get it.

78
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,208
What could this
Lumen Histoire be?

C'mon guys.

80
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,666
The sooner we can get outta
their range, the better.

Yeah man, I hear ya on that.

82

So do I.

83
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:33,041
That fight's a lot bigger
than any human could handle.

84
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,875
I remember the dragons that
came out of the Eclipse.

85
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,666
They were almost unstoppable.

86
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,125
And it looks like these
dragons are even stronger.

You won't escape from me.

[IGNEEL] I'm not fleeing.
Nor will I allow you to.

92
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,166
At this height, I don't
have to hold back.

93
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,708
Prepare to face judgment
for your crimes.

94
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,208
Brave words, but empty.

95

They come from the mouth
of one soon to be dead.

Do your worst.

97

He's just sittin' there.

98
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,833
Even against three
of us, he seems bored.

good to keep fighting.

why you're so fired up?!

requires my death, so be it!

On the left side of the ring,

00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,958
we have Kyoka, Goddess
of the Slave Planet!

114
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,250
She's got eyes like a hawk

115
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,250
and a reach as far as
those talons can grow!

We can count ourselves defeated
if that timer runs down.

countin' on you!

Right. I won't let you down.

Where's Natsu?
Sure hope he's okay.

123
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,625
How frightened you
must be to know

124
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,416
that your existence is
devoid of any purpose.

125
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,166
We do not suffer from
such existential woes.

126
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,791
Our maker made
his reasons clear.

127
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,125
And what were those?!

128
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,250
Did he create you just to die?!

129
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,375
How can you know victory when
you've thrown your life away?!

[sighs] Well, so it goes.

141
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,458
Kyoka's become so preoccupied
with slaughtering your comrades

142
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,250
that she's forgotten my voice.

143
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,625
But I suppose she's earned
this last bit of fun.

144
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,000
So tell me,

145
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,250
why do you wanna erase
all magic, anyway?

146
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,875
What do you stand
to gain from that?

147
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,041
Don't you know?

148
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,125
I'd think you could've
put it together.

149
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:14,625
That tome your friend wants
to steal contains E.N.D,

150
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,166
and its magic that seals him.

151
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,083
You wanna bust him out.

152
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,291
Now you see.

153
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,333
Despite how it may appear,

154
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:29,041
I'm not our leader.
That title belongs to E.N.D.

155
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,583
There are none among us
who can rival his strength.

156
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,375
Once E.N.D. has
finally been released,

157
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:37,916
we can fulfill our true
purpose, and return to Zeref.

158
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,833
Makes zero sense to me.

159
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,416
Why would you wait?

160
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,333
If you want to see
Zeref so badly,

161
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,375
why wouldn't you just
do it on your own?

162
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:46,833
[MARD GEER]
Hmph.

163
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,500
[MARD GEER]
Though raised by dragons,

164
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,625
sadly, you're still only human.

165
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,166
This is likely beyond
your comprehension.

166
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,666
[NATSU]
Get to the point!

167
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,208
Have you ever stopped to
consider Zeref's reason

168
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,666
for creating my kind?

169
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,916
Perhaps you merely thought
of us as his... playthings.

170
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,500
[MARD GEER] You've doubtless
heard my cohorts describe

171
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:14,791
the call of Zeref. The
urge to return to him.

172
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,875
But none among them
ever questioned it.

173
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,541
When we find Zeref,
what would he have us do?

174
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,375
Why were we endowed
with this instinct?

175
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:28,125
All we do, we do
for Our Lord Zeref!

176
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,875
[MARD GEER] It's an absolute
command, etched into our genes.

177
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,875
We must see Zeref.
We must return to Zeref.

178
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,791
We must do all for Zeref.

179
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,750
I alone have come to realize

180
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,875
that in truth he
made us to give him

181
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,416
the one thing of which
he's been deprived.

182
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,458
[NATSU growls]

183
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,458
Hmph.

184
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,375
[MARD GEER]
Over the centuries,

185
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,875
Zeref grew to revile
his immortality.

186
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,625
He yearned for death.

187
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,666
[MARD GEER] But death
would not come on its own.

188
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,291
So Zeref strove to make a being
strong enough to slay him.

189
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,916
[MARD GEER] It took him many
years to refine his work.

190
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,291
Dozens of creations.

191
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,333
Before he made one
worthy of the task.

192
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:35,166
[NATSU gasps]

193
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,416
[MARD GEER] That being:
his masterpiece is E.N.D.

194
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,541
But E.N.D. was prevented
from fulfilling his purpose.

195
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,208
Locked back inside his book.

196
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,416
[MARD GEER] He is held
there by a magic seal.

197
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:55,208
One too powerful for any curse
or spell in this world to break.

198
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,416
Or so I thought.

199
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,166
That was before I learned
about the Faces.

200
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,875
A magic seal can't exist
in a world without magic.

201
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,375
Very soon, he will be free.

202
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,166
Then, side by side,
we'll slay Zeref.

203
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,916
This is the mission we
were created to fulfill.

204
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,625
It shall be an exquisite
pleasure to carry it out.

205
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,875
All this time, you've
been wanting to kill Zeref?

206
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,791
The hell does that have to do
with the rest of us humans?

207
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:34,250
Couldn't you just
leave us out of it?

208
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:37,000
When one is on his way to
an important destination,

209
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,666
he doesn't timidly avoid
the weeds in his path:

210
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,875
he tramples them.

211
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:43,500
[STING]
Oh, yeah?

212
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:44,541
Uh!

213
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,375
[STING, ROGUE scream]

214
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,875
Sting, Rogue! Hang in there!

215
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,083
Natsu!

216
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,291
[ROGUE groaning]

217
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,125
[NATSU]
What the heck is that thing?!

218
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,916
This is a Prison Flower.

219
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,250
Fresh from the Underworld.

220
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,958
Damn! It won't budge!

221
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:17,833
[STING]
Come on, man!

222
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:18,875
Use your fire!

223
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,208
[NATSU]
Ah! Crap, I'm stuck.

224
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,250
It froze.

225
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,000
[MARD GEER gasping]

226
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,500
[STING, ROGUE]
Uh.

227
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:42,041
My scarf. I thought
I'd lost it for good.

228
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,458
[GRAY]
You're welcome.

229
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,041
[NATSU]
Uh?

230
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:50,333
If it means so much to you,
then take better care of it.

231
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,500
[NATSU]
Will do.

232
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,125
Thanks for the save!

233
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,333
He has such power.

234
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,000
When did you freeze his arm?!

235
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,666
[MARD GEER]
This magic... Who are you?

236
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,041
This face is the last thing
you're ever gonna see.

237
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,916
Because you're the thing I slay.

238
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,041
When did you freeze his arm?!

239
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,791
[MARD GEER]
This magic... Who are you?

240
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:32,083
This face is the last
thing you're ever gonna see.

241
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:35,000
Because you're the thing I slay.

242
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,041
[MARD GEER]
You're a Demon Slayer?

243
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,833
[STING]
He's a what?

244
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,125
[ROGUE] If the title's
as simple as ours,

245
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:56,041
then he's exactly what
we need right now.

246
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,750
Mard Geer's scared.

247
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,333
I've come here on
behalf of the fallen.

248
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,166
[GRAY yells]

249
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:14,166
[MARD GEER]
This magic... It's Silver's!

250
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,125
I never had a doubt that he
would betray us eventually,

251
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:30,416
but I couldn't have suspected
it would happen like this.

252
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,291
What poetic circumstance! Fate
can be quite amusing, can't it?

253
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,708
He froze every thorn.

254
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,416
Almost effortlessly!

255
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,708
[STING]
Incredible.

256
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,333
[MARD GEER yells]

257
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,250
I don't really see
how fate's to blame

258
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,125
for any of the crap
you've been pullin'.

259
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:15,208
And there ain't a damn thing
about it I find "amusing"!

260
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,125
My old man sends his regards.

261
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,625
Old man?

262
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,166
[GRAY] I've come to
finish what he started!

263
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,625
[MARD GEER screams]

264
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:24,875
[STING, ROGUE]
Uh...

265
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,416
You screwed with
the wrong family!

266
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:38,125

Ice Demon: Zero Long Sword!

270
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,750
[STING]
Gray! No!

271
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,333
Well, that was timely.

272
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:51,833
He came from that flower.

273
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,041
[sniffs] Wait a sec.

274
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,083
I know that smell.

275
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,666
There's no way.

276
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,125
[ROGUE whimpers]

277
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,500
The man who once
stood at the helm

278
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,166
of the strongest
guild in this world.

279
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,958
But now, he's shed his humanity,

280
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:13,041
and become something
more powerful.

281
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:20,416
You knew him as... Jiemma.

282
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,833
Our master.

283
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,750
[NATSU]
It's really him.

284
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,000
Those monsters...

285
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,958
they turned him into a demon.

286
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,875
Just like they
did to Minerva.

287
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,000
Though it does seem
to suit him better.

288
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,416
[JIEMMA]
Of course it does.

289
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,291
Power's always suited me.

290
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:50,458
That's why I demanded
to be transformed.

291
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,625
And look at me now.

292
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,125
The mightiest demon
that's ever existed.

293
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,500
Was it worth it?

294
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,250
Abandoning your humanity
just for power?

295
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,458
The man's lost
his friggin' mind.

296
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,416
My newest servant
is more powerful

297
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,333
than any of the
Nine Demon Gates.

298
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,833
But I suppose that you and
he are already familiar.

299
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,291
[JIEMMA]
My power stuns the heavens.

300
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:14,166
I have no master,
for I have no equal!

301
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,708
No one calls me servant!

302
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,291
Do you hear me?!

303
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,750
I'll demolish these
insects first.

304
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,791
But after that,
I'll come for you!

305
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:26,833
[MARD GEER]
Heh.

306

[JIEMMA yells]

307
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,833
You can't scare me!

[STING, ROGUE gasp]

309
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,750
[NATSU] Don't let this jerkwad
freakshow get under your skin!

310
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:41,291
Keep fighting! [yells]

311
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,250

I've no business with you.

There! You understand now?

316
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,916
Stay down like a good bug.

317
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,333
[ROGUE yelling]

318
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,875
[STING]
You're gonna pay for that!

319
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:03,750
[JIEMMA grunts]

320
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,125
[STING, ROGUE groan]

321
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,916
[JIEMMA]
You're pathetic! Feeble!

322
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,833
Unworthy to oppose me.

323
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,333
You claim to be
raised by dragons.

324
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:17,208
Are you sure they
weren't just lizards?

325
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,666
I hate this guy.

326
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,041
[JIEMMA]
Sting.

327
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,375
Rogue.

328
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,875
I've been waiting
for this moment

329
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,833
for quite a long time now.

330
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,583
For the chance
to end your lives.

331
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,625
Ah, crap! Are they okay?!

332
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,583
[STING]
We aren't scared.

333
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,333
[ROGUE]
And we won't stop!

334
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,375
[JIEMMA]
Hm?

335
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,125
[STING, ROGUE yell]

336
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,083
Leave this guy to us, Natsu!

337
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,708
You focus on Mard Geer!

338
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:48,916
[JIEMMA]
There's a difference

339
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,458
between bravery and
arrogance, lizard boys.

340
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,583
Come on! I'll show you!

341
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,708
He called us out. Are you ready?

342
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:56,750
Sure am.

343
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,500
Let's make this
quick and get home.

344
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,083
I wanna show M'lady what
we've done with the place.

345
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,333
[MARD GEER chuckles]

346
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,875
[STING, ROGUE grunting]

347
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,250
[STING, ROGUE groaning]

348
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,458
Strong, isn't he?

349
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:21,625
Though I'll have to do something
about that arrogant streak.

350
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,458
[GRAY]
This is the end of the line.

351
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:26,000
There's nobody left
to protect you.

352
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:29,166
[MARD GEER] And you think
I require protection?

353
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,875
You're a fool if you believe
that little power of yours

354
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,916
will have any effect on me.

355
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,958
Not after I've taken
on my Etherious form.

356
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,625
He's changing.

357
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,666
[MARD GEER] E.N.D. is about
to rise from a slumber

358
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,583
lasting 400 years.

359
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:51,250
The time has come for
me to rise as well.

360
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,416
[GRAY, NATSU gasp]

361
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:08,416
[MARD GEER] Behold.
I am Mard Geer Tartaros.

362
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,875
Absolute Demon, and
King of the Underworld!

363
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:23,541
[GRAY]
Natsu--

364
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,875
[NATSU]
Don't say it, I know.

365
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,458
We don't care what you
call yourself king of.

366
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,041
We're gonna take you out!

367
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:37,416
[MARD GEER]
Come. Give me your all.

368
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,666
For this battle
shall be your last.

369
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,458
[LUCY] In his blind pursuit
of greater strength,

370
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:18,666
Jiemma has renounced his
humanity and become a demon.

371
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,833
The Twin Dragons, having
rejected his cruel philosophy,

372
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:24,958
stand as comrades against
their former master.

373
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:27,541
Mard Geer Tartaros,
the Absolute Demon,

374
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,750
now bears down on
Natsu and Gray.

375
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,625
Even with Gray's new powers,

376
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:33,333
they'll be hard
pressed to defeat him

377
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,583
now that he's taken
on his true form.

378
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:39,416
Next Time: "Tartaros Chapter
Memento Mori."

379
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,750
Keep fighting. The
future's at stake.
