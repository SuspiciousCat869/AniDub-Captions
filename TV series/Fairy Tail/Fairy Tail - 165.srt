1
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:18,708
[grunts]

2
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:21,583
Get outta my way!
Come back here!

3
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:24,208
[NATSU] I won't
let you take Wendy!

4
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:26,208
[MALE BANDIT 162A]
He's catching up!

5
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,416
[MALE BANDIT 162B]
This guy is insane!

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,625
Who hired you to do this?

7
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:34,000
[BANDITS scream]

8
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,916
[MALE BANDIT 162A] We were
just doing a job! That's all!

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,125
[MALE BANDIT 162B] Yeah,
for somebody in Raven Tail!

10
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,208
[MALE BANDIT 162C]
We were supposed to bring 'em

11
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:43,958
the girl that was
in the infirmary!

12
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,500
[IRIKI] Sure you were.

13
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:48,333
They can tell us all
about it at headquarters.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,208
Raven Tail is gonna pay.

15
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:58,166
Who was there. Past tense.
That seems weird.

16
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,875
[PORLYUSICA]
There was one before you.

17
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:01,875
Natsu brought her in.

18
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:04,375
They're going after her?

19
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:06,500
Lucy?

20
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,333
[ARCADIOS] Ignorant
to the truth, I hope.

21
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:10,125
Yes, sir. They still
believe they were

22
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:12,333
hired by the Raven Tail guild.

23
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:15,166
[ARCADIOS] Luckily, we can use
the rivalry between Raven Tail

24
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,625
and Fairy Tail to our advantage.

25
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:20,250
And when the opportunity
arises, we will have

26
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:23,000
a Celestial wizard
in our possession.

27
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,958
[ARCADIOS] To use
in the Eclipse project.

28
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,208
[MATO] Hey-o, Punkins!

29
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,041
I hope you've been
enjoying the magic

30
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:05,333
and mayhem of the
Grand Magic Games!

31
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:08,833
I'm your referee
and mascot, Mato!

32
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,208
Woohoo!

33
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:13,333
Yesterday's eye-candy
was just the appetizer!

34
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,541
Day three will be
an action feast!

35
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,916
And if you'd like a side
of "plot twist" with that,

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,958
the mighty Sabertooth
has fallen--

37
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,708
Hold up, Harvest Head,
we're barely halfway

38
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,916
through this thing and
you're talkin' like it's over!

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,250
This is the day
Sabertooth gets serious

40
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,333
and shows off our true power!

41
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,958
[FROSCH] We're gonna
get all up in your face!

42
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,583
[MATO] Listen kitties, I know
you're excited, but this is

43
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,625
my segment and you're
interrupting me! Beat it!

44
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,791
That's a pretty rotten
attitude for a mascot.

45
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,333
Yeah, it's stinky.

46
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,708
Sabertooth is about
to be old news, kids.

47
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,583
Kagura'll make short
work of your sorry bunch.

48
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,541
Now don't get cocky just 'cause
you ladies beat the newbie!

49
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,291
She's nothin' compared to Sting
or anybody else on our team!

50
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,958
Every girl we've got can
hold their own, fuzz ball!

51
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,916
[MATO] Please,
calm down, you two!

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,916
We're supposed to be recapping
here, not starting a feud!

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,708
What happened to sportsmanship?

54
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,000
Sportsmanship is out the door!

55
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,666
[MATO clears throat]

56
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,708
Sorry, folks. Let's get
back on track, shall we?

57
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:12,083
[MATO] Turns out we've got quite
a few ties, as you can see.

58
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:15,250
[LECTOR] I see an embarrassing
new name for Quattro Cerberus.

59
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,333
[FROSCH] Ha-ha,
they're Puppies now!

60
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,958
Mermaid Heel is closing
in on you, short stuff.

61
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,208
And Fairy Tail is busy

62
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,416
fighting itself
for last place.

63
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,416
[MATO] Yes! But tomorrow's a
new day and there's no telling

64
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,541
what might happen
to shake up the ranks!

65
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:33,291
That's the real thrill
of the Grand Magic Games!

66
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,625
[FROSCH]
It's a gambler's dream!

67
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,208
[MATO] Day three is just
around the corner, folks!

68
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,708
So look forward
to it, and remember--

69
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,250
[ALL] If you want
magic and action,

70
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,708
the Grand Magic Games
is the place to be!

71
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,416
[HAPPY] Hatred at Nightfall!

72
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,416
Then you will throw it all away.

73
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,458
Yes, sir. If that
is what you wish.

74
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,583
Poor Yukino.

75
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,583
This isn't the time
for talking, Frosch.

76
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,333
[JIEMMA] You don't
deserve that emblem.

77
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,250
Erase it!

78
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes.

79
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,000
I haven't been here very long,

80
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:52,333
but thanks for all
you've done for me.

81
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:56,833
I don't need your
gratitude. Out of my sight!

82
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,125
[STING]
Master can be so intense.

83
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,833
I mean, that hurt to watch.

84
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,416
Well, it can't be helped.

85
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,750
There's a reason we're the most
powerful guild in all of Fiore.

86
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,041
I'm really gonna miss her.

87
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,916
Mmmm...

88
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:25,000
Is this really how guilds work?

89
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,083
Yukino was one
of us, wasn't she?

90
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,708
She screwed up, so she's out.

91
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,708
You know what they say
about the weakest link;

92
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:41,083
she would've just held us back.

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,041
[LECTOR] Oh, did you hear?
Rumor has it Minerva

94
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,125
is gonna take Yukino's
place in the lineup!

95
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,125
[STING] Right on! With our
five strongest together

96
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,375
we'll dominate this tournament.

97
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,583
[FROSCH] Hey, Rogue?

98
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:02,000
Will I have to leave
because I'm weak, too?

99
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:05,500
That won't happen,
Frosch. I promise.

100
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,916
You have me at your side.

101
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,708
I hope you're there forever!

102
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,125
I don't think I've ever
been this stuffed before!

103
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,166
You'll eat
yourself sick someday.

104
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,416
And I'll be right
there with him!

105
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,708
The inn should be somewhere
around here, right?

106
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,750
Yep! It won't be long now.

107
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,625
I probably shouldn't
get my hopes up,

108
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,416
but do we have separate rooms?

109
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,250
No way. We can
barely afford one.

110
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,291
Though I'd give just
about anything for one night

111
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,500
free of Natsu's crazy snoring.

112
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,375
Not that Gray and Erza's
is any less crazy.

113
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,750
Speaking of, do you
know where they ran off?

114
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,875
Well, I can't speak for Erza...

115
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:49,041
[CARLA] but Gray's dealing with
a little "crazy" of his own.

116
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,541
I think it's time we got
some clear-cut answers.

117
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,000
And we're not leaving
until we get them!

118
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,750
Where's Erza?

119
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,583
Don't look at me;
I'm not her keeper.

120
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,416
I know where she is!
Makin' kissies!

121
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,625
[sighs]

122
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,333
She's probably getting
in a solo work out

123
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,750
before tomorrow's games.

124
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:06,916
I don't think she's solo,

125
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,666
but she is gettin' a work out!

126
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,750
The girl in front of
the inn looks familiar.

127
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,166
Yeah, she does but where
have we seen her before?

128
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,041
Geez, how can you
tell from this far away?

129
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,916
[gasps]

130
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,000
Hey, aren't you--

131
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,583
It's that girl
from Sabertooth!

132
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,208
Yeah, she's the
Celestial Wizard!

133
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,541
[MILLIANNA]
I finally found you!

134
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:33,583
[ERZA] Who goes there?

135
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:34,875
[MILLIANNA giggles]

136
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,041
Well, aren't you all rosy?

137
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,625
It's been a while, Erzy-Werzy!

138
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,333
Millianna!

139
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,833
[BOTH laugh]

140
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,625
[MILLIANNA]
Oh, I've missed you so much!

141
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,083
[ERZA] It's so good to see you!

142
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,958
I was gonna wait
to do my big reveal

143
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,708
until after we'd won the games.

144
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:58,333
But I wanted to see you so
badly that I couldn't take it!

145
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:01,000
[MILLIANNA] Oh, Erzy-Werzy,
let's run away together

146
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,291
and be happy.

147
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,666
[laughs]

148
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,916
You're so silly. I have
to say, I was very impressed

149
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,208
by your guildmate.
Kagura, was it?

150
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,500
Yeah, she's somethin' else.

151
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,166
Now that ya mention it,
she might even be

152
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,916
stronger than you, Erzy!

153
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,291
In that case, I hope I get
the chance to fight her.

154
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,583
Well, this is
a tournament,

155
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,583
so you might get
your wish real soon.

156
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,541
But, somehow I don't
think Kagura would

157
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,416
fight very seriously. Not yet.

158
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,916
Why do you say that?

159
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,083
[MILLIANNA] You saw
how she didn't draw

160
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,375
her Archenemy sword, right?

161
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,791
[ERZA] That's a pretty
vicious-sounding name

162
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,750
for a katana.

163
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,458
It's like a reminder.

164
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,458
She'll never draw that
sword until it's time

165
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,250
to strike down the
person she named it for.

166
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,416
The man she hates so much.

167
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,083
She won't be satisfied until
he's finally deep in the ground.

168
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:59,208
She'll do whatever it takes
to put him there herself.

169
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:02,750
[MILLIANNA] She'll draw
her sword to kill Jellal.

170
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,250
[ERZA gasps]

171
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,875
I don't blame her.

172
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:09,166
You feel the same way,
too, don't you, Erzy?

173
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,750
[MILLIANNA] I know you do.

174
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,666
I have never
stopped hating Jellal.

175
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,291
[MILLIANNA]
He used us like tools.

176
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,708
He took Simon away from us.

177
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,333
[MILLIANNA]
For all of those sins...

178
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,791
He has to pay!

179
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:47,125
He will. That's the reason
I joined Kagura's guild.

180
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,208
I've got some fish
if you're hungry.

181
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,791
It tastes best when it's raw.

182
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,166
That's not the issue here.

183
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,166
Well, the truth is--

184
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,291
[ERZA] Try not to draw
any attention to yourself.

185
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,083
[JELLAL]
I've learned my lesson.

186
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:30,000
Ultear drove that point
home loud and clear.

187
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:34,458
Don't push yourself too hard.

188
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,708
[JELLAL] I won't.
Goodnight, Erza.

♪

190
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:56,375
[ERZA] Once again, fate
has a sick sense of humor.

191
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:59,333
Jellal's true feelings
are a mystery to me.

192
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:02,708
Even now.
They always have been.

193
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,000
I have never
stopped hating Jellal.

194
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:10,166
And what's worse,
there's Kagura.

195
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:14,541
[MILLIANNA] She'll draw
her sword to kill Jellal.

196
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:17,500
It may not be long
before she draws it.

To see me? But what about?

00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,166
My guild.

199
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,000
[YUKINO] I just left
there and have something

200
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,041
I'd like to discuss with you.

201
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,541
Your guild send you here to
mess with her or somethin'?

202
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,708
Let's hear her out.

203
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,791
I don't think she
wants to hurt anybody.

204
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,958
[YUKINO] I realize this
is out of the blue, but--

205
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,875
[YUKINO] Please take these.

206
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,291
[YUKINO]
The Key of the Two Fish,

207
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,375
and the Key of the Balance.

208
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,875
I want you to have them.

209
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,583
They should belong to someone
who can use them properly.

210
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,125
What?

211
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:15,541
No way. I couldn't!
Please think this through!

212
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,458
I already have;
I made up my mind

213
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,166
after watching you fight.

214
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,625
[YUKINO] I was going
to give them to you once

215
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,750
the tournament was over, anyway.

216
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,083
So why not just wait 'til then?

217
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:29,375
The games were over
for me the moment I lost.

218
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,375
Minerva will take my place.

219
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:36,583
Tomorrow you'll be up against
Sabertooth's strongest.

220
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,666
[YUKINO] The five members
who transformed the guild

221
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,250
into the powerhouse
it is today.

222
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,000
Wait, you mean...?

223
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,791
It started once
they got a new master.

224
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,916
After he took over,
five incredibly strong

225
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,041
wizards joined, and
that was all she wrote.

226
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,458
But we thought that
you were one of the five.

227
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,250
Normally, a newcomer
like me wouldn't compete,

228
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,916
but Lady Minerva was on
a job and couldn't make it.

229
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,083
So, I stepped in for her.

230
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,833
But why are you doing this?

231
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:06,125
I thought Spirits were precious
to their Celestial Wizards.

232
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,166
Yes, that's true,
and that's precisely why

233
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,416
I've decided to hand
them over to Lucy.

234
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,041
It's clear she's a
superior Celestial wizard.

235
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,791
They would be much
happier in her possession.

236
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,000
I appreciate
the compliment, but

237
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,166
I'm afraid the
answer's still no.

238
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,791
Please, you must take them.

239
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:25,500
You've already managed to gather
ten of the twelve Zodiac keys.

240
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,750
[YUKINO] All you
have to say is "yes."

241
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,833
With these in your possession,
you'll have them all.

242
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:34,708
Then the door of
world change shall open.

243
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,208
"Door of world
change shall open"?

244
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,125
What does that mean?

245
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,041
[CARLA and HAPPY] Huh?

246
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,958
Think you could look
into the future, Carla?

247
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:47,750
Sorry but precognition
doesn't work on-demand, child.

248
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,416
[YUKINO] It's just an old
legend. To tell you the truth,

249
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,125
I don't understand
what it means, either.

250
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,500
But there is one
thing I'm sure of.

251
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,291
Over the past few
years, the number of

252
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,416
Celestial wizards has plummeted.

253
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,125
[YUKINO] Given the hit
to our numbers during

254
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,416
the Zentopia incident,
it's possible that

255
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,875
you and I are
the only ones left.

256
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,125
I also know that
the spirits love you,

257
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,583
and you love them in return.

258
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,125
If anyone should have
them, it should be someone

259
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,125
who's connected to them.

260
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,458
Thanks but I can't take 'em.

261
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,041
Celestial magic is about
the bonds we've formed

262
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,583
with our Spirits.
It's not as easy to give up

263
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:39,000
ownership of them
as you might think.

264
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,458
I know.

265
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,250
[YUKINO] Trust me,
this isn't easy for me.

266
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,541
[LUCY] Huh?

267
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,583
[YUKINO] Forget about it.
I had a feeling that

268
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,833
would be your answer
from the start.

269
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,666
But, for better or for worse,
I'm sure all twelve keys

270
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,500
will find their
way together someday.

271
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,125
[YUKINO] I hope this
isn't the last time we meet.

272
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,208
You passed up a
golden opportunity!

273
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,625
I'm with Carla on this one.

274
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,875
I'm not sure I
could have said no.

275
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,416
A long time ago, I would
have jumped at the chance

276
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,583
to have all twelve Zodiac keys.

277
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,875
But I haven't wanted
that for a while now.

278
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,416
She may be a member
of Sabertooth, but

279
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,333
it's obvious she
cares for her Spirits

280
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,083
the same way that I do.

281
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,875
I'd be a pretty
poor Celestial wizard if

282
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,166
I allowed her to
sever their bond.

283
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,375
[LUCY] At least,
that's how I feel, anyway.

284
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,458
[BOTH chuckle]

285
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:38,208
[CARLA] So where did Tom Cat and
the bottomless pit run off to?

286
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,750
[WENDY] They went after Yukino.

287
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,541
They said they forgot to
tell her something important.

288
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,166
[NATSU] Hey! Wait up!

289
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,875
[HAPPY] Please! Stop!

00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,458
It's Natsu.
What could he want with me?

Good! You actually stopped!

I guess you really aren't
such a bad person, after all.

[gasps]

295
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,208
Hang on! You can't
assume someone's bad

296
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,583
just 'cause they're
in another guild.

297
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:05,000
I thought you were
bigger than that, Natsu!

298
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:08,083
Duh, that's why I came to
apologize to her, ya dummy!

299
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,625
[YUKINO] Apologize?

300
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:10,875
Yeah, my bad!

Believe it or not,
he can be mature

304

when he really wants to be.

305
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,416
[NATSU] Tch. Thanks,
I can really feel the love!

306
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,083
You followed me
all the way out here

307
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,208
just to apologize to me?

308
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,000
Well, yeah, it's the least
I can do when you look

309
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,541
so down in the dumps.
Though, I guess following you

310
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:31,250
out here might have
seemed a little creepy.

311
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,125
No. You're very kind.

312
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,958
Good, glad that's settled!

313
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:39,083
For a second I thought
things might get awkward!

314
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:44,833
[YUKINO sobbing]

315
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,250
Whoa, now what did I do?
Please stop crying!

316
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,750
Ah! Whatever he did,
I'll fix it!

317
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,250
[YUKINO sobbing]

318
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,833
I can't take it.

319
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,208
[NATSU] What?

320
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:58,000
[YUKINO] It's just--
no one's ever been this kind--

321
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:02,208
or--shown so
much concern for me.

322
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,291
I looked up to them once.
The members of--

323
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,750
Sabertooth--were my idols.

324
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,458
I finally joined them.

325
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,083
But now I'll never--

326
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,833
get to step foot
in the guild again.

327
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,666
[NATSU and HAPPY gasp]

328
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,375
[YUKINO] I was forced to leave
just because of one defeat.

329
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:22,583
[YUKINO crying]

330
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:26,583
I don't need your
gratitude. Out of my sight!

331
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,458
[YUKINO] I was humiliated
in front of everyone.

332
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:35,291
He made me--
erase my own--guild mark.

333
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:39,958
[YUKINO crying]

334
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:43,416
It was so frustrating!
And embarrassing!

335
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,625
He took my self-respect
and shattered it into pieces!

336
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:52,791
Sabertooth was my home
and I'll never see it again!

337
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,333
[growls]

338
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,041
Well, that's too bad.
But I don't worry about

339
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,916
what happens
inside other guilds.

340
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,458
[HAPPY] Natsu!

341
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:12,916
Sorry. It's not your business.

342
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,083
I just couldn't hold it back.

343
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,000
[NATSU] You're right,
it ain't my business,

344
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,958
but it pisses me off when
other wizards are mistreated.

345
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,458
Humiliating you in front of
your friends is bad enough,

346
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:26,333
but making you erase
your own emblem?

347
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,125
[NATSU] Any guild
that makes a friend cry

348
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,125
doesn't get to
call itself a guild!

349
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,083
[YUKINO] A friend?

350
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,166
[GRAY] Hey, Erza. What's
up? Somethin' the matter?

351
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,458
Hello, Gray.

352
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,500
I'm fine.

353
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:57,791
Don't worry. So, what brings
you out here all alone?

354
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,375
After dealing with Juvia and
Lyon's nonsense all night,

355
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,416
I figured I could use a little
fresh air to clear my head.

356
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,458
You think it's
"nonsense," huh? Come on.

357
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,541
I mean, I wasn't even
there and I bet I could

358
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,750
tell you exactly what they
wanted to talk with you about.

359
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,583
[ERZA] You know how
she feels about you.

360
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,125
It's not like she hides it.

361
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,833
[GRAY sighs]

362
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,291
[ERZA] She deserves
a straight answer.

363
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,750
Hrm.

364
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,208
But then again...

365
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,375
[ERZA] it's none
of my business.

366
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,375
Trust me, I'm in no
position to lecture others

367
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,333
on matters of the heart.

368
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,625
[GRAY] Are you sure
there's nothin' wrong?

369
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,375
[ERZA] Yes.

370
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,875
[ERZA] It's getting late.
We should get back to the inn.

371
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,958
[ARCADIOS] One wizard
with ten of the keys,

372
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,666
and another with two of them.

373
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,125
I couldn't ask for
a better situation!

374
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,458
[ARCADIOS] With all twelve,
the Eclipse will work

375
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,333
just as I'd imagined!

376
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:09,666
[ARCADIOS] It will be
soon, Zeref! Very soon!

377
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:16,416
[ARCADIOS laughs intensely]

378
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,666
What the hell was that?

379
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,458
A party maybe?

380
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,875
We've got an intruder, Sting!

381
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,416
Everything's going boom boom!

382
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,375
They must have a death
wish! What kind of idiot

383
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,208
would storm in here and
start messing with our guild?

384
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,750
[STING] Who is it?

385
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,250
No idea! But if they
think they're getting out

386
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,916
of here alive, they're
in for a real shock!

387
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,666
[SABERTOOTH MAN 165A] Aaahhh!

388
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:53,666
[SABERTOOTH MEN yelling]

389
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,250
[SABERTOOTH MAN 165B] Augh!

390
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,166
Where is your master?

391
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,625
Tell me!

392
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,083
[BOTH] Uh...

393
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,583
Bring 'im out, now!

394
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:15,500
If you have something to say
to me... you should say it.

395
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:18,791
You the master
of this sorry bunch?

396
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,791
So it's "one loss and you're
out on the street," huh?

397
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,958
[NATSU] Ha! Those are
some hardcore rules, pal.

398
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:29,916
[JIEMMA growls]

399
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,875
Let's see if you play by 'em.

400
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:41,916
If you lose to me,
you gotta quit the guild, too!

401
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,458
[NATSU] To celebrate
scoring our first points in

402
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:16,458
the Grand Magic Games,
we gorged ourselves

403
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:17,958
silly on food and drink.

404
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,583
[HAPPY] As we endured
our stomachaches,

405
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,708
the fair Yukino
appeared before us,

406
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:23,416
out of uniform and homeless!

407
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,291
[NATSU] After learning of the
abuse she endured at the hands

408
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:27,875
of her guild master,
I, the valiant Salamander,

409
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:30,791
launched an assault on
the Sabertooth guild itself!

410
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:33,333
[HAPPY and NATSU]
Next time: "Pandemonium!"

411
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,375
[HAPPY] What about me,
your colleague,

412
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:36,750
whom you've left behind?

413
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:37,666
[NATSU] Uh, well--

414
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,416
[HAPPY]
What is to become of me?

415
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,791
[NATSU] Sorry, I can't
keep this up, 'lil buddy!
