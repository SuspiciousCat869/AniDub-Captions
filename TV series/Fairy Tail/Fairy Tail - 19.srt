1
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:18,333
- HEY, GUYS.

2
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:19,958
READY FOR SOME
MORE "FAIRY TAIL"?

3
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,625
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING,

4
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:23,000
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE ROOM

5
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,250
AND DON'T SIT
TOO CLOSE TO THE TV.

6
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,458
THE KINGDOM OF FIORE,

7
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:34,583
A PEACEFUL NATION
OF 17 MILLION,

8
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:37,875
AND A PLACE FILLED
WITH MAGIC.

9
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,875
HOWEVER...

10
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,333
SUBMITTED FOR 
YOUR APPROVAL,

11
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,500
A TYPE OF MAGIC THAT
IS PARTICULARLY EERIE,

12
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:47,458
A SPELL THAT MAY CAUSE
THE MINDS OF YOU,

13
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:49,791
OUR DEAR VIEWERS,
TO LEAVE YOUR BODIES

14
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:53,500
AND BE TRANSPORTED
TO THAT FARAWAY MAGICAL REALM.

15
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,458
DON'T PANIC.

16
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:58,583
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

17
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:27,791
- ( door opens )

18
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,458
- Erza: IS MASTER MAKAROV HERE?

19
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:32,250
- YOU'RE FINALLY BACK
FROM YOUR ISLAND GETAWAY.

20
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,291
SO HOW WAS IT?
DID YOU HAVE FUN?

21
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,750
- IT WAS WORK, 
NOT A VACATION.

22
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:40,125
- UH, MIRAJANE, I WOULDN'T
JOKE WITH HER RIGHT NOW.

23
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,250
- WHERE IS MAKAROV?

24
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:42,708
- HE WENT OUT OF TOWN

25
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,333
FOR SOME KIND OF
LAST-MINUTE COUNCIL MEETING

26
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,458
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

27
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,125
HE'S BEEN GONE SINCE YESTERDAY.

28
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,166
- WHEW.

29
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,166
- WELL, THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

30
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,166
- YES, WE WON'T HAVE
TO DEAL WITH <i>THAT</i>

31
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,500
UNTIL GRAMPS GETS BACK.

32
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,000
- OH, THANK GOODNESS.

33
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,500
I WASN'T READY TO STARE
INTO THE FACE OF DEATH.

34
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,291
I'VE STILL GOT
EIGHT MORE LIVES.

35
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,625
- I CAN'T STAND IT ANYMORE.

36
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,166
YOU GUYS ARE REALLY
FREAKING ME OUT.

37
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,958
HOW'S HE GONNA PUNISH US?
I CAN'T DIE NOW.

38
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,083
I'M STILL YOUNG AND I HAVE
SO MUCH TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

39
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,583
- ALL OF YOU, SHUT UP!

40
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,583
- ( gasping )
- DO YOU KNOW WHEN THE MASTER

41
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:09,916
IS PLANNING TO RETURN?

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,500
- NO, BUT I WOULD IMAGINE

43
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,166
HE'LL BE COMING BACK
ANY TIME NOW.

44
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,166
- NOW, LISTEN UP, YOU FOOLS.

45
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,458
YOU'RE NOT
GETTING OFF THE HOOK.

46
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,416
YOU BROKE GUILD RULES
BY TAKING ON

47
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,958
THAT S-CLASS QUEST.

48
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,708
PREPARE TO BE PUNISHED.

49
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,166
- ( boys whimper )
- HOW DO I PREPARE MYSELF

50
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,083
WHEN I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?!

51
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,125
- WELL, IT WAS
NICE KNOWING YOU.

52
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,250
( sighs )
IT'S A CRYING SHAME.

53
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,375
THOSE TWO BOYS ARE ONE THING,

54
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,916
BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE
LUCY'S GETTING PUNISHED TOO.

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,666
OH, YOU POOR GIRL.

56
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,125
- "YOU POOR GIRL"?
- WHAT'S THE DEAL, MAN?

57
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,958
HOW COME YOU DON'T
FEEL SORRY FOR US? HUH?

58
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,208
- WHY'RE YOU LUMPING ME
IN WITH THIS LOSER?

59
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,166
- ( fighting grunts )
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

60
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,916
- IT MEANS I DON'T
EVEN WANT TO BE

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,791
IN THE SAME SENTENCE AS YOU.
DO I HAVE TO DRAW YOU A PICTURE?

62
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,750
- A BIG PART OF BEING A MAN
IS OWNING UP TO YOUR ACTIONS.

63
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,208
YOU HEAR THAT, YOU TWO?

64
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,875
IT'S HIGH TIME
FOR YOU TO MAN UP.

65
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,916
- IT'S NOT FAIR.
I'M THE CUTEST ONE HERE.

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,500
SO HOW COME NOBODY 
FEELS SORRY FOR ME?

67
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,291
- WOULD SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO US?!

68
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,541
- Natsu: THAT'S ONE
CREEPY-LOOKING JOB REQUEST.

69
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:14,875
- YEAH, IT IS.

70
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,041
- YOU GUYS ARE BACK. WHAT'S UP?

71
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,208
-  NOT MUCH, MAN.
WHAT THE HECK?

72
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,708
I CAN'T EVEN READ IT.
- READ WHAT?

73
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,000
- WHOA! YOU'RE BACK TOO, LUCY?

74
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,708
- GEEZ, IT'S REAL NICE
TO SEE YOU TOO.

75
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,458
WHAT IS YOUR
PROBLEM WITH ME?

76
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,208
- I, UH-- NOTHING.

77
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,625
- NO WAY!

78
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,916
YOU WILL NOT BE
TAKING ANY REQUESTS.

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,291
- REAL SMOOTH.

80
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,166
- DO THEY HAVE 
TO BE SO NOISY?

81
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,166
- WHO CARES?
THEY ARE LIKE THE COOLEST.

82
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,791
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME, RIGHT?

83
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,208
- "DECIPHER THIS TEXT
AND I'LL SEE THAT YOU'LL

84
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:45,000
INCREASE YOUR WEALTH
BY 500 THOUSAND JEWEL."

85
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,666
THIS ONE SOUNDS
LIKE A WINNER TO ME.

86
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,333
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- SURE DOES.

87
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,250
- SO IT'S A TRANSLATION JOB?

88
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,958
THAT'S A WEIRD REQUEST
FOR A GUILD.

89
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,416
WAIT, THAT'S SOME KIND 
OF CRAZY ANCIENT STUFF.

90
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,333
NO ONE'S GONNA
BE ABLE TO READ THAT.

91
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,625
- Happy: HOLD ON, IT'S WRITTEN
IN MODERN LETTERS TOO.

92
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,500
- I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
NO JOBS.

93
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,416
- OH, YEAH, I CAN 
TOTALLY READ THAT.

94
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,541
LET'S SEE, "UGO DERU
RASUCHI BORO KANIA."

95
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:09,125
WHAT THE-- THAT'S CRAZY.

96
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,666
- ( gasping )

97
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,958
- Macao: WHAT'S GOING ON?
- THAT'S JUST SAD.

98
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,625
THOSE KIDS ARE SO SCARED
OF THE MASTER'S PUNISHMENT,

99
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,458
THEY'RE ACTUALLY
SWEATING RAINBOWS.

100
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,625
- THAT'S ENOUGH BOOZE FOR YOU.

101
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,458
- All: UH...

102
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,583
- ( shivers )
SO COLD!

103
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,500
- WHAT?  ICE WIZARDS
DON'T GET COLD,

104
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,916
YOU BIG CRYBABY.

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,333
- ( shivers ) I'M SERIOUS,
YOU GUYS.

106
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,750
COULD SOMEBODY TURN UP
THE HEAT BEFORE

107
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,291
I FREEZE TO DEATH IN HERE,
PRETTY PLEASE?

108
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,541
- HUH?

109
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,916
- ( deep pitched )
WHAT THE--

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,333
WHAT'S GOING ON?

111
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,083
MY CHEST FEELS REALLY WEIRD
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

112
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,833
LIKE IT'S HEAVY.
MY BACK'S KILLING ME.

113
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,583
- HEY, ARE YOU FEELING
ALL RIGHT, LUCY?

114
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,375
- YOUR VOICE SEEMS
AWFULLY LOW.

115
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:54,250
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I-- WHAT THE--

116
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,250
THAT'S WEIRD.

117
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,625
I DON'T REMEMBER

118
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:57,958
LYING DOWN ON
THE FLOOR LIKE THAT.

119
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:04,791
- HOLD ON.  I THOUGHT I WAS
THE ONE WHO WAS ON THE FLOOR.

120
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,958
( screams )

121
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,416
- WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

122
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,250
YOU CAN'T FACE ME,
DRAGON BREATH?

123
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,250
WHY DO I SOUND LIKE A GIRL?
- I'M NO DOCTOR,

124
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,291
BUT I'D SAY IT'S PROBABLY
'CAUSE YOU ARE A GIRL.

125
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,958
- WHY IS EVERYONE
BEHAVING SO FOOLISHLY?

126
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,125
- OH, WOW, NATSU.
CHECK IT OUT.

127
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,208
WHERE DID HE GO?

128
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,791
- I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE.

129
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,500
WHY IS THIS PLACE SO DARK?

130
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,625
- I COULD BE WRONG,
BUT I REALLY DON'T THINK

131
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:29,708
I'VE ALWAYS HAD THESE.

132
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,083
HAVE I? HAVE I?

133
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:34,750
- WHOA!
- OH, WHY YOU!

134
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,083
- ( thunk )

135
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,541
- HEY, AND I GOT
COOL ARMOR TOO.

136
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,000
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME.

137
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,500
I'VE NEVER FELT SO
TINY AND WEAK BEFORE.

138
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,375
IT'S LIKE I'VE SOMEHOW
REQUIPPED INTO A CAT. 

139
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,750
- WHY DO THEY HAVE TO RUIN
MY QUALITY DRINKING TIME? 

140
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,875
- THEY'RE SO COOL,
THEY COULDN'T RUIN ANYTHING.

141
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,666
- KINDA THEIR THING.
- ( gasping )

142
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,250
- Gray: OKAY, I'M STARTING
TO GET REALLY FREAKED OUT.

143
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,958
FIRST, I'M TOTALLY FREEZING.

144
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,166
AND NOW, THERE'S SOME SORT OF
CREEPY LOOK-ALIKE OF ME.

145
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,791
- Lucy:
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

146
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,500
- HOW CAN YOU BE
SUCH AN IDIOT?

147
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,625
DON'T YOU REALIZE
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO US?

148
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:06,333
WE'VE ALL SWITCHED BODIES.

149
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:07,791
- WHAT?

150
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,583
- STOP FOOLING AROUND, HAPPY.

151
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,125
- I'M ERZA, YOU DIMWIT.

152
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,541
- IF YOU'RE GONNA
YELL AT ME, LOKE,

153
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,041
DO IT TO MY FACE.

154
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,041
- SILENCE.
- YOU MEAN...

155
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,750
- Happy: YES, NATSU AND LOKE.

156
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,000
GRAY AND LUCY.

157
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,958
AND WORST OF ALL,
HAPPY AND I.

158
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,000
WE HAVE ALL SWITCHED BODIES.

159
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,666
- All: HUH?

160
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,750
- WHY SWITCHING WITH ME
THE WORST OF ALL?

161
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,666
- THE ANCIENT UNPELA SPELL
HAS BEEN CAST.

162
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,666
YOU KIDS AREN'T FEELING
LIKE YOURSELVES TODAY, HUH?

163
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,625
- MASTER, YOU'RE BACK.
- GRAMPS.

164
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,166
- I HAD NOTICED THAT 
REQUEST ON THE BOARD.

165
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,000
BY READING WHAT WAS WRITTEN
ON THAT PAGE ALOUD,

166
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,375
YOU'VE CAST A POWERFUL SPELL
OF PERSONALITY TRANSFERENCE.

167
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,833
AND THAT SPELL IS CALLED
THE CHANGELING.

168
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:50,083
- THAT SOUNDS SCARY.
- SO YOU'RE REALLY NATSU, RIGHT?

169
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,958
- YEAH.
- YOU IDIOT!

170
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,666
WHAT DID YOU DO TO US?

171
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,750
- ME?  ALL I DID WAS TRY
TO READ THE STUPID JOB REQUEST!

172
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,958
WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE
TURN ON THE LIGHTS?  COME ON.

173
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,416
- Makarov: THAT'S ENOUGH, LUCY--

174
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,083
UH, GRAY. FOR WIZARDS,

175
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,875
THIS SPELL SWITCH IS MORE
THAN JUST YOUR BODIES.

176
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,583
IT SWITCHES MAGIC AS WELL.

177
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:08,875
- WHAT?!

178
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,583
- ( pants )

179
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,541
OH, MAN, IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE

180
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,041
SOMEBODY JUST POURED
LAVA DOWN MY THROAT.

181
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,333
HEY, IS IT HOT OUT HERE
OR IS IT JUST YOU?

182
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,583
- ( screams )

183
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,875
- HUH? 

184
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,041
( screams )

185
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,000
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?!

186
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,916
- THERE'S ONE THING
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

187
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,375
IF THE CHANGELING SPELL
IS NOT UNDONE

188
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:34,583
WITHIN 30 MINUTES FROM THE TIME
WHEN IT WAS INITIALLY CAST,

189
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,500
YOU WILL NEVER RETURN
TO THE WAY YOU WERE BEFORE.

190
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,708
OR SO SAYS THE LEGEND
AT LEAST.

191
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:41,875
- WHAT?!

192
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,333
- DO YOU KNOW
HOW MANY MINUTES

193
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,291
WE'VE BEEN MIXED UP FOR?
- 16.

194
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,166
SO YOU HAVE 14 LEFT.

195
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:52,291
- GRAMPS, ISN'T THERE A WAY
TO LIFT THE SPELL

196
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,875
AND CHANGE US BACK?
- HMM.

197
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,041
SINCE THIS IS SUCH
AN ANCIENT MAGIC,

198
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,000
IT WOULD ONLY STAND TO REASON

199
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,166
THAT I... DON'T KNOW.

200
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,291
- OH NO.
- I MUST SAY I'M DISAPPOINTED.

201
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,750
I WAS SO LOOKING FORWARD
TO PUNISHING YOU.

202
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,875
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE GOT
YOUR HANDS FULL FOR NOW.

203
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,708
BEST OF LUCK TO YOU KIDS.

204
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,083
- ALL RIGHT, THAT DOES IT.

205
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,083
I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE.

206
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,666
- NO!  GET AHOLD OF YOURSELF.
- LET GO!

207
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,875
- SO, EVEN THOUGH
GRAY'S IN LUCY'S BODY,

208
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,708
HE STILL LIKES TO TAKE OFF
HIS CLOTHES.

209
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,666
- THEN THAT MEANS--
- THAT MEANS WHAT?

210
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,000
- THIS'LL BE AWESOME.
- NO, HAPPY!

211
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,041
- OKAY, HERE I GO.
- HAPPY!

212
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,250
STOP THIS AT ONCE!
- REQUIP!

213
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,541
CHECK ME OUT, YOU GUYS.

214
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:34,750
YAY!

215
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,041
UPPA!

216
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,833
TA-DA.

217
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,125
- WHOA, ERZA LOOKS SMOKIN' HOT!

218
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,458
- HOW DARE YOU!

219
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,958
NO, THIS CAN'T BE.
I WAS AN S-CLASS WIZARD.

220
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,416
AND NOW I'M SO WEAK.

221
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,125
- MAN, I WAS TRYING
TO CHANGE INTO

222
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,125
ONE OF THOSE COOL
SUITS OF ARMOR SHE HAS..

223
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,916
- I SEE, WE SWITCHED OUR MAGIC
WITH EACH OTHER,

224
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,916
BUT EVERYONE
TOTALLY STINKS AT IT.

225
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,041
- HEY, LOKE--
OR WHOEVER'S INSIDE HIM.

226
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,375
- GEEZ, IT'S ME, NATSU, OKAY?

227
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,541
- HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT
WHAT MAGIC HE USES?

228
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,875
- YEAH, COME ON.
BE A MAN, KID.  SHOW US.

229
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:22,208
- I DON'T KNOW.  I DON'T FEEL 
ANYTHING HAPPENING MAGIC-WISE.

230
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,833
EVERYTHING JUST
KIND OF SEEMS FUZZY.

231
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:28,208
( groans ) I DON'T THINK I CAN
TAKE THIS PRESSURE ANYMORE.

232
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,625
- HEY, GUYS, YOU GOT TO HELP ME!

233
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,708
- WHAT'S WITH THAT FIRE?

234
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,125
- IT'S LIKE HE'S DROOLING.

235
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,625
- WELL, THAT'S CERTAINLY
NOT THREATENING.

236
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,291
- I MUST ADMIT,

237
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,791
FLYING IS WAY MORE FUN 
THAN I THOUGHT IT'D BE.

238
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,000
I SHOULDN'T BE WASTING
MY PRECIOUS TIME LIKE THIS.

239
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,750
I NEED TO BE
CHANGED BACK AT ONCE.

240
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:48,083
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

241
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:51,791
- HEY, GRAY OR, UH, LUCY,
YOU'RE DROPPING ICE, HON.

242
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,541
- I HATE THIS.
WHY ME?

243
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,333
- Levy:
NO NEED TO WORRY, LUCY.

244
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,458
- LEVY, IT'S YOU.

245
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,208
- LEVY?

246
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,500
- THE SHADOW GEAR TEAM
IS HERE TO SAVE THE DAY.

247
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,291
YOU GUYS WILL BE BACK
TO NORMAL IN NO TIME.

248
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,083
- OH YEAH, WE GOT THIS.
NO SWEAT.

249
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,208
- NOW, DO YOUR THING, LEVY.

250
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:23,583
- WHEN YOU BOYS SAY "WE,"
YOU REALLY MEAN "HER," RIGHT?

251
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,708
- ( laughing )

252
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,208
- YOU'RE SO SWEET TO HELP US.

253
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,000
- ANYTHING FOR MY GIRL.

254
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,375
BESIDES, I WANT TO
READ YOUR NOVEL.

255
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,083
AND IT'D BE KIND OF WEIRD
TALKING ABOUT IT WITH GRAY.

256
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,958
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

257
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,166
- WELL, I DO KNOW A THING OR TWO
ABOUT ANCIENT TEXTS.

258
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,583
I'LL START BY TAKING A LOOK

259
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,375
AT WHAT WAS WRITTEN 
ON THE FLYER ITSELF.

260
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,750
- SOUNDS GOOD, BUT DO IT QUICK.

261
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,333
- LISTEN UP, EVERYONE.

262
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,458
WE NEED TO LET LEVY
WORK IN PEACE.

263
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,750
WHY DID I HAVE
A FISH IN MY MOUTH?

264
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,166
- 'CAUSE THEY'RE YUMMY.

265
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,250
- OKAY.
"UGO DERU..."

266
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,875
- PLEASE HURRY.
THERE'S ONLY 10 MINUTES LEFT.

267
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,083
- HEY, YOU SURE IT'S SAFE

268
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,833
TO READ THE WORDS
OUT LOUD LIKE THAT?

269
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,625
- DON'T WORRY.
IT'S TOTALLY SAFE

270
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,291
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T READ
EVERYTHING IN THE CORRECT ORDER.

271
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,375
NOW...

272
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,958
- THERE'S NOT MUCH TIME!

273
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,625
UGH, I CAN'T TAKE IT!

274
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:21,041
I FEEL SO WEIRD.
CHANGE ME BACK. 

275
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,166
- AWW, I DON'T THINK
IT'S ALL THAT BAD.

276
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,208
ONE MORE TIME!
RE--

277
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,708
- I SWEAR YOU'LL 
LOSE A LIFE, CAT!

278
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,375
- SO HOW'S IT GOING, LEVY?

279
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:34,208
- HAVE YOU FIGURED IT OUT?

280
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,750
- NO, I'M STUMPED.

281
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,041
- ( screams )
- ( groans )

282
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,375
- OH NO, I NEVER
THOUGHT MY FATE 

283
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,875
WOULD BE TO
LIVE OUT MY DAYS

284
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,375
AS SOME STRANGE FLYING CAT.

285
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,666
- WHAT'S SO TERRIBLE
ABOUT THAT, HUH?

286
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,458
- NO!
- OOH!

287
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,875
- I TOLD YOU
NOT TO DO THAT!

288
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,833
- UH, I FEEL SO FUNKY.

289
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,041
- THE GIRLS ARE NEVER
GONNA TALK TO ME NOW.

290
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,708
- I WANT TO SWITCH
WITH SOMEONE.

291
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,125
- NOT WITH ME, KIDDO.

292
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,041
I'D DIE IF I WAS UNDERAGE.

293
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,041
- LOOK, I KNOW YOU GUYS
ARE FREAKING OUT,

294
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,625
BUT I'M STILL
WORKING ON IT, OKAY?

295
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,083
- HOW MUCH TIME
DO WE HAVE?

296
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,541
- ABOUT EIGHT MINUTES.

297
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,583
HATE TO SAY IT,
BUT YOU MIGHT START PREPARING

298
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,166
FOR THE WORST.

299
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,000
- OH NO.

300
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,541
- ( whistle blows )
- ( drum thumping )

301
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,833
- Both: GO, GO!

302
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,791
GO, LEVY!

303
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,416
- THOSE TWO GUYS ARE JUST HER
PERSONAL CHEERLEADERS?

304
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,958
- SO "DERU" IS...
OH, I SEE.

305
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,916
THAT MUST MEAN...

306
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,750
- ( all sigh )

307
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,541
- SO WHAT HAPPENS IF WE END UP
GETTING STUCK LIKE THIS?

308
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,416
- HUH?  WHAT DO
YOU MEAN BY THAT?

309
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,958
- ARE WE JUST GONNA TRY
TO ADJUST TO OUR NEW BODIES

310
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,375
AND GO BACK TO WORK?

311
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,083
- WELL, YEAH,
I GUESS WE'D HAVE TO.

312
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,958
IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAVE
A WHOLE LOT OF OPTIONS.

313
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,458
- WHATEVER HAPPENS
IS TOTALLY FINE WITH ME.

314
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,708
IF I STAY QUIET,
EVERYONE'LL BE NICE TO ME

315
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,916
BECAUSE I'M SCARY NOW.
- WHAT?

316
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,750
- WELL, NO ONE ASKED FOR
YOUR OPINION, DID THEY?

317
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,166
STUPID CAT.

318
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,250
I JUST WANT TO BE 
A CUTE GIRL AGAIN.

319
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,250
- ( both sigh )

320
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,250
- ARE THOSE FROZEN
CHUNKS OF DROOL?

321
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,791
THAT IS SO GROSS, MAN.
- I'M NOT A MAN!

322
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,166
AND I KNOW IT'S GROSS.

323
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,708
YOU THINK I'M DOING
THIS ON PURPOSE?

324
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,000
UH...
- WHAT IS IT, GRAY?

325
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,000
ER, I MEAN LUCY.

326
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,333
- I JUST REALIZED SOMETHING.

327
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,125
IF WE GET STUCK
LIKE THIS FOREVER

328
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,625
AND NONE OF US HAVE A CLUE
HOW TO USE OUR MAGIC ANYMORE,

329
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:14,041
IF WE DID TAKE A JOB,
WE'D NEVER BE ABLE TO FINISH IT.

330
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,750
- AWW, GEEZ, YOU'RE RIGHT.
- WE STINK.

331
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,458
- AND THAT MEANS...

332
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,041
- All: WE'RE THE WEAKEST TEAM
IN FAIRY TAIL NOW.

333
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,333
- LET'S DO THIS, HAPPY.
- AYE.

334
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:26,625
- ICE MAKE: SOMETHING OR OTHER.
- UH, HOLD ON.

335
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,083
STUPID KEYS.

336
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:31,041
- OH, WOW, BEING ABLE TO FLY
IS SO FUN.

337
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,416
- ( all groan )

338
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,208
- NO!
WHAT'S THE POINT OF LIVING

339
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,166
IF I CAN'T EVEN
BURN STUFF ANYMORE?

340
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,458
- I AM AN S-CLASS WIZARD
AND I REFUSE TO BE PART 

341
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,208
OF THE WEAKEST TEAM 
IN THE ENTIRE GUILD.

342
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,916
IF ONLY I WASN'T TRAPPED
IN THIS FORM...

343
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,708
- YOU'RE MEAN.

344
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,833
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU'RE COMPLAINING SO MUCH.

345
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,208
I LIKE BEING A CAT.

346
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,208
- ( groans )

347
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,458
- JUST WHAT WERE YOU TRYING
TO DO THERE, ERZA?

348
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,416
ER, I MEAN, HAPPY?

349
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,375
- EVER SINCE WE'VE SWITCHED,
SHE'S BEEN SAYING MEAN STUFF.

350
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,000
SO I GOT MAD AND
TRIED TO FLY AWAY.

351
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,000
BUT I COULDN'T FLY AWAY

352
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,958
'CAUSE I DON'T
HAVE MY WINGS ANYMORE.

353
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:10,083
- I'M SORRY I WAS MEAN.

354
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,166
I PROMISE I'LL BE--

355
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,208
- YES, THAT'S IT.
- ( gasps )

356
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,583
- REALLY?
SO YOU CAN LIFT THE SPELL?

357
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,333
- COME ON.  DO IT.

358
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,375
- THIS IS WHAT IT SAYS.

359
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,000
"MAY THIS ETERNAL EXCHANGE

360
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,791
PROVIDE YOU WITH
ETERNAL HAPPINESS."

361
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,041
KIND OF CUTE, ISN'T IT?

362
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,125
- AW, YEAH, IT IS.

363
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,833
- "MAY THIS ETERNAL EXCHANGE

364
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,500
PROVIDE YOU WITH
ETERNAL HAPPINESS."  HUH.

365
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,416
- YEAH, AND...

366
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,916
- IN OTHER WORDS, EVERYBODY

367
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,458
WHO'S BEEN SWITCHED
BY THE SPELL

368
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,000
WILL LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER.
YOU'RE SO LUCKY.

369
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:42,375
I'M SO GLAD
I FIGURED IT OUT.

370
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,625
- OH, NO WAY!
ARE YOU TELLING ME

371
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,125
WE'RE STUCK
LIKE THIS FOREVER?!

372
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,958
- WE WANTED YOU TO LIFT
THE SPELL,

373
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,500
NOT READ IT.
REMEMBER?

374
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,916
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M SORRY.

375
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,541
- YOU'VE GOT THIS.
I HAVE FAITH THAT YOU CAN DO IT.

376
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,708
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO WORK
A LITTLE FASTER, OKAY?

377
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,000
MAYBE THERE'S SOME KIND OF CODE

378
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,500
OR HIDDEN MESSAGE
IN THE WORDS,

379
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,916
YOU KNOW,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

380
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,500
- YEAH, GOOD IDEA.

381
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:06,291
- GO, GO!  GO, LEVY!

382
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:10,291
- ISN'T ALL THAT RACKET
GONNA DISTRACT HER?

383
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,166
- NO, THEY'RE JUST TRYING
TO GET HER PUMPED UP.

384
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,958
AND THEY NEED
ALL THE HELP THEY CAN GET.

385
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:15,958
- HUH?

386
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,250
- GO, GO!  GO LEVY!
( cheering )

387
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,333
- I'M STILL NOT SEEING ANY
KIND OF A PATTERN HERE.

388
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,541
IT DOESN'T SEEM
TO MAKE ANY SENSE.

389
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,875
- ( groans )
- THREE MINUTES LEFT.

390
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,125
- THREE MINUTES?!

391
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,583
- WELL, THIS IS IT.
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,

392
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,083
FISH FOR BREAKFAST,
LUNCH, AND DINNER. 

393
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,583
I'VE WORKED SO HARD.

394
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,250
AND NOW I'M GOING
TO SPEND MY DAYS 

395
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,166
CHASING MICE AND
LITTLE PIECES OF STRING.

396
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,333
- NO, WAIT! COME BACK
HERE, HAPPY. I MEAN, ERZA!

397
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,666
- SORRY I GOT UPSET.

398
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,541
I KNOW THIS IS HARD
FOR BOTH OF US.

399
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,666
- REALLY?
YOU DO?

400
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,416
- NOW'S NOT THE TIME FOR US
TO BE ARGUING LIKE THIS.

401
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,875
WILL YOU PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

402
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,125
- YES, OF COURSE.

403
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,208
I HOPE YOU'LL
FORGIVE ME TOO.

404
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,666
- AYE, HERE'S A LITTLE SOMETHING
TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

405
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,208
- A FISH, I--

406
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,583
DON'T WANT IT!

407
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,125
- COULD YOU BE ANY
MORE CLUELESS?

408
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,458
- HAVE YOU
FIGURED IT OUT YET?

409
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:08,833
- THE SITUATION IS DIRE

410
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,291
WITH JUST ONE MINUTE TO GO.

411
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,416
- I DON'T RECALL ASKING
YOU FOR THE TIME,

412
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,333
SO SHUT YOUR TRAP, 'KAY?!

413
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,125
- GEEZ, I WAS JUST
TRYING TO HELP.

414
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,333
- OKAY, I THINK
I'VE ALMOST GOT

415
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,583
THIS LAST PART OF IT
WORKED OUT.

416
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,875
- WORK IT, LEVY.  YEAH!

417
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,833
YOU'RE ON FIRE!
- HE'S TOO GOOD AT THAT.

418
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,333
- STILL TRYING TO BREAK
THE SPELL, ARE YOU?

419
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,916
- LOOK, IF YOU'RE TRYING
TO TEACH US A LESSON HERE,

420
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,375
WE'VE LEARNED IT ALREADY, OKAY?

421
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,708
- OH.
- ( gasps )

422
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,333
- YES, MASTER?

423
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:39,208
- NOPE.  NEVER MIND, KIDS.
I'M DRAWING A BLANK.

424
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,375
- ( all groan )

425
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,583
- OH! WE'RE NOT
GONNA MAKE IT!

426
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,875
- TAKING MY SHIRT OFF

427
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,625
ISN'T GONNA
CHANGE ANYTHING, GRAY!

428
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:47,916
- LET GO OF ME!

429
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,875
- YOU GUYS HAVE ABOUT
40 SECONDS LEFT,

430
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,208
MORE OR LESS,
STARTING NOW.

431
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,291
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY "MORE OR LESS"?!

432
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,708
- I JUST REMEMBERED SOMETHING
ABOUT THE SPELL.

433
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,583
- WHAT IS IT?
- WHILE IT CAN BE LIFTED,

434
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,208
I'M AFRAID THAT IT HAS
TO BE DONE ONE PAIR AT A TIME.

435
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,625
MEANING IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO
CHANGE ALL OF YOU BACK AT ONCE.

436
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,500
- WHAT?
- 30 SECONDS-ISH.

437
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,250
- WHICH PAIR'S GOING FIRST?

438
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,083
- IT SHOULD BE ME
AND OTHER ME.

439
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,541
DON'T YOU THINK?
- SOUNDS GOOD.

440
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,958
- THAT IS SO NOT FAIR.

441
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,666
I THINK IT SHOULD
BE ME AND GRAY.

442
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,500
- HOLD ON, AS FAIRY TAIL'S
STRONGEST FEMALE WIZARD,

443
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,625
I SHOULD GO FIRST.
IT'S FOR THE GOOD OF THE GUILD.

444
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,416
- WELL, I DON'T CARE
EITHER WAY.

445
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,833
- ( arguing )
- THIS IS GETTING UGLY.

446
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,416
- AT LEAST THEY CAN'T USE
THEIR MAGIC AGAINST EACH OTHER.

447
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,875
-  JUST 15 SECONDS LEFT.

448
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,791
- HOLD ON, YOU GUYS,
I GOT IT.

449
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,791
- AND 12, 11...

450
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,541
- SERIOUSLY?

451
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:38,666
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL TRY TO EXPLAIN

452
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,916
THIS TO YOU REALLY QUICK.

453
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,708
- AND NINE, EIGHT...

454
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,750
- ( thuds )
- ( groans )

455
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:43,916
- NO TIME.

456
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,541
JUST CHANGE US BACK.
HURRY!

457
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,583
- YEAH, RIGHT.
OKAY, HERE GOES.

458
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:51,166
"AINAK OROB
IHCUSAR URED OGU!

459
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,916
AINAK OROB
IHCUSAR URED OGU!

460
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,083
AINAK OROB
IHCUSAR URED OGU!

461
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:00,375
AINAK OROB
IHCUSAR URED OGU!"

462
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,791
- ( sighs )

463
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:25,916
- HEY, I'M BACK TO NORMAL, GUYS.
- ME TOO.

464
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,583
MAN, THAT WAS CLOSE.

465
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,541
- SO NOW YOU'RE DROOLING
ICE CUBES ON PURPOSE?

466
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,375
- YOU'RE AWESOME, LEVY.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

467
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,916
- OH, YEAH.
- OUR CHEERING WORKED, HUH?

468
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,500
- YOU GOT TO TELL US--
HOW'D YOU DO IT?

469
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,166
WHEN I REALIZED THE WORDS
THEMSELVES HAD NO MEANING,

470
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,916
I DECIDED TO READ
THEM BACKWARDS.

471
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,916
IT'S ACTUALLY AN OLD TRICK.

472
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,416
ANCIENT LANGUAGES LIKE THIS

473
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,166
USUALLY DIDN'T HAVE
THAT MANY LETTERS. 

474
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,375
SO SOMETIMES THEY HAD TO BE
A LITTLE BIT MORE CREATIVE 

475
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,875
WITH HOW THEY USED THEIR WORDS.

476
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,708
THAT'S WHY,
WHEN I REVERSED THE WORDS,

477
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,333
IT REVERSED THE SPELL TOO.

478
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:59,125
- HOW COOL. I NEVER WOULD
HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT.

479
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,708
- WE OWE YOU BIG TIME, LEVY.

480
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,791
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

481
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:05,750
- I'M STILL
IN THE WRONG BODY!

482
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,208
- WHAT?

483
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,916
- ME TOO.
I'M STILL A STUPID CAT.

484
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,791
- WOW, YOU MEAN I GET
TO STAY LIKE THIS?

485
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,083
- ( screams )

486
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,333
- WELL, THAT DOES IT
FOR TIME.

487
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,041
YOU DID GET ONE PAIR
SWITCHED BACK.

488
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,750
SO I GUESS THAT'S
SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF.

489
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,166
- NO, THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

490
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,750
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN
SOME KIND OF MIX UP.

491
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:22,791
PLEASE, LEVY,
THERE'S GOT TO BE

492
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:23,791
SOMETHING ELSE YOU CAN TRY.

493
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,458
- SORRY, MAYBE I DIDN'T

494
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,750
PRONOUNCE IT RIGHT.

495
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,208
- All: WHAT?!
- SO THAT'S IT?

496
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,541
WE'RE STUCK
LIKE THIS FOREVER.

497
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,208
- I CAN'T SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE

498
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,958
AS SOME PINK-HAIRED FIRE 
DROOLING FREAK OF NATURE.

499
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,416
- WAKE UP, ERZA.

500
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,875
THIS IS ALL SOME
HORRIBLE NIGHTMARE

501
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,875
AND YOU NEED TO WAKE UP.
- OH, COME ON, RELAX.

502
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,416
IT'S NOT ALL THAT BAD.

503
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,000
- Mirajane: NOW, NOW,
DON'T LOSE HEART.

504
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,583
THERE'S GOT TO 
BE ANOTHER WAY.

505
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,750
HUH?

506
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,416
- SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

507
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,166
HEY, GUYS, DID I GET SHORTER?

508
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,625
- OH NO!  MIRAJANE?!

509
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,166
- DON'T TELL ME THAT MIRA
SWITCHED BODIES WITH GRAMPS.

510
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,291
- WHOO BOY!  YOU WON'T HEAR ME
COMPLAINING ABOUT THAT!

511
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,791
- NO!  THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!

512
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,791
- WHO ELSE?

513
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,916
- ALL OF YOU NEED TO JUST
MAN UP AND GET OVER IT, OKAY?

514
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,041
WHAT'S THE DEAL? WHY DO I SMELL
LIKE A BREWERY ALL OF A SUDDEN?

515
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,083
- WHAT?  HEY, HOW DID--

516
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,291
OH MAN, I REALLY THINK

517
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:20,083
I MIGHT NEED TO TAKE
A BIT OF A NAP RIGHT NOW.

518
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:23,416
- HEY, UH, DROY?  HMM?!
- YEAH, WHAT IS IT NOW, JET?

519
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,000
- HEY, MAN, STOP
LOOKING LIKE ME!

520
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,791
- I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S
GONNA BE ABLE

521
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,666
TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE
WITH YOU TWO.

522
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,541
BUT IN MY CASE,

523
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,958
HAVING A BODY LIKE THIS
IS A DREAM COME TRUE.

524
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,958
- HE'S CREEPING ME OUT, LEVY!

525
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,208
PLEASE HELP ME.

526
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:43,083
- ( overlapping chatter )

527
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,791
- UH...

528
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,458
- SORRY, BUT I THINK I'M IN
WAY OVER MY HEAD HERE.

529
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,291
- THIS IS AWESOME.

530
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,083
EVERYONE'S SOMEONE ELSE NOW.

531
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,083
- HAVE YOU GONE 
COMPLETELY NUTS?

532
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,208
THIS IS HORRIBLE.

533

- Narrator:
MAGIC IS NOT A TOY.

534
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,625
IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE,

535
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:02,041
IT CAN TURN YOUR WORLD
ON ITS HEAD.

536
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,000
THE VERY FABRIC OF YOUR BEING

537
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,208
CAN BE PULLED FROM YOU
IN AN INSTANT.

538
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,291
SO DON'T TAKE IT LIGHTLY.
- ( theme music plays )

539
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,625
- Narrator:
UNTIL NEXT TIME...

540
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,791
- PLEASE TURN US BACK!

541
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,625
- YOU'RE SERIOUSLY
JUST GONNA END IT?

542
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,625
- AYE.

543
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,166
- ( singing in Japanese )

544
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,041
- Happy: PROFESSOR HAPPY'S CLASS
ABOUT FAIRY TAIL.

545
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:53,458
TODAY WE'RE GONNA LEARN

IN THIS EXCITING GUILD.
SO LISTEN UP.

547
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,000
WHEN SOMEONE NEEDS HELP
FROM A WIZARD,

548
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,791
A JOB IS POSTED ON
THE GUILD'S REQUEST BOARD.

549
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:02,333
THERE, WIZARDS CAN PICK ANY JOB
THEY WANT TO MAKE MONEY.

550
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:04,375
IT HELPS IF YOU'VE GOT
A FRIEND TO GO ALONG WITH YOU.

551
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:06,333
YOU CAN EVEN COME UP
WITH A COOL TEAM NAME.

552
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:08,416
YAY!  THAT'S TODAY'S CLASS.

553
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,333
DISMISSED.
- ( chairs scrape )

554
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:11,375
- AYE!

555
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:13,875
- Natsu: SORRY, BUDDY.

556
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:16,583
BUT I DON'T THINK ERZA
LIKED BEING YOU ALL THAT MUCH.

557
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:18,250
- SHE WAS PROBABLY JUST MAD

558
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,208
'CAUSE SHE COULDN'T
FIGURE OUT HOW TO FLY.

559
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:23,291
- YEAH, KIND OF REMINDED ME
OF THE DAY YOU WERE BORN.

560
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,000
- AYE, I DON'T MEAN TO BRAG,

561
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:27,500
BUT SINCE IT WAS REALLY ERZA
PRETENDING TO BE ME,

562
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:29,916
SHE COULDN'T EVEN COME CLOSE
TO BEING AS CUTE AS I AM.

563
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,750
- Natsu:
HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU.

564
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:36,041
BUT YOU WERE KIND
OF GROSS-LOOKING

565
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,500
WHEN YOU WERE BORN.
- NO WAY.

566
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:39,250
EVERYBODY TOLD ME
I WAS CUTE.

567
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,583
- WELL, YOU WERE,
BUT IN A GROSS KIND OF WAY.
