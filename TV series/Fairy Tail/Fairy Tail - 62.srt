1
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:19,875
- Natsu:
PREVIOUSLY, ON "FAIRY TAIL"...

2
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:21,750
- Lucy: NIRVANA'S
BEEN ACTIVATED

3
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,458
AND NOW IT'S HEADING
ON A DESTRUCTIVE PATH

4
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:25,000
STRAIGHT TOWARD WENDY'S GUILD,
CAIT SHELTER.

5
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,125
- Hoteye: OH YEAH.

6
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:27,750
- Happy: NATSU AND I
HAD A HUGE BATTLE

7
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,833
WITH THE POISON
DRAGON SLAYER, COBRA!

8
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:31,250
- OH YEAH.

9
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:32,750
- Natsu: HEY, HAS ANYONE
ELSE NOTICED THAT JURA'S HEAD

10
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,625
LOOKS LIKE A BIG OLD POTATO? 
- Jura: THAT IS NOT TRUE.

11
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:40,666
- ( theme music playing )

12
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:57,875
- ( singing in Japanese )

13
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,083
- Happy: OH, MAN, NATSU,

14
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,833
I'M STARTING
TO NOT FEEL SO GOOD.

15
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:17,208
- IT'S 'CAUSE OF HIS POISON.
- ( both grunt )

16
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:20,833
- AND NOW I CAN'T...

17
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,666
EVEN MOVE.

18
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,125
- ( crashing )

19
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:32,666
- AND WHAT'S WORSE,
THIS THING'S A VEHICLE.

20
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,875
- I SWEAR
I'LL PUT AN END TO YOU

21
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,458
FOR THE HONOR
OF THE SIX DEMONS.

22
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:45,708
- Happy:
"WIZARD SAINT JURA"!

23
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,208
- NO.

24
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,625
YOU'RE WRONG.
NO WAY, PAL.

25
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,500
- I HEAR IT LOUD AND CLEAR--

26
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,041
THE BELL TOLLING
ON THE OLD GENERATION.

27
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,416
IT'S OVER.
YOUR KIND IS DONE.

28
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,666
TIME FOR
THE NEW DRAGON SLAYERS!

29
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,041
- ( blast exploding )

30
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,833
- ( grunting )

31
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:14,375
- THAT'S ENOUGH, COBRA.
YOU MAY STAND DOWN.

32
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:17,250
- BRAIN.
BUT WHY?

33
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,875
ARE YOU MAD?

34
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,458
- YOU'VE PERFORMED
EXTRAORDINARILY WELL,

35
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:25,333
BUT IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO REST.

36
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:28,833
( thinking ) WHAT GOOD
IS A FALSE DRAGON SLAYER TO ME?

37
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,333
ESPECIALLY ONE WHO CAN BE
SO EASILY BEATEN

38
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,333
BY ONE OF THE OFFICIAL GUILDS.

39
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,291
YOU'RE PATHETIC.

40
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:38,791
I'M SORRY,
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

41
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:42,041
( laughs )

42
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:45,041
- HOW DARE YOU?

43
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:48,541
YOU TRAITOR!

44
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,791
ALL I EVER WANTED,

45
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,166
MY ONLY PRAYER,

46
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,875
WAS TO SOMEDAY HEAR THE VOICE
OF MY ONE TRUE FRIEND.

47
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,375
CUBELLIOS.

48
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,500
- HE'S GONE.

49
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,458
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO HIM?

50
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,750
HE WAS YOUR FRIEND.

51
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,708
- WITH THE POWER I NOW HAVE
AT MY DISPOSAL,

52
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,833
I WILL HAVE NO PROBLEM
GATHERING FRIENDS

53
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,833
THAT WILL MUCH BETTER SERVE ME.

54
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,250
NIRVANA WILL MAKE IT SO.

55
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:34,333
- YOU DON'T MAKE TRUE FRIENDS
WITH POWER AND INTIMIDATION.

56
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:37,541
ALL YOU'LL GET ARE PUPPETS.

57
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,708
- YOU SHOULDN'T
MAKE SUCH A FUSS.

58
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:44,250
AFTER ALL, YOUR POWER IS WHAT
I ADMIRE ABOUT YOU THE MOST.

59
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,083
IT WOULD DO ME GOOD
TO HAVE A FRIEND LIKE YOU.

60
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:54,375
OR TO USE YOUR TERMINOLOGY,
TO HAVE YOU AS MY PUPPET.

61
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,416
- NO.

62
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,041
I THOUGHT THERE WAS
NO WAY YOU COULD BEAT ME.

63
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,291
- HE WHO POSSESSES THE STRONGER
IDEOLOGY WILL ALWAYS WIN.

64
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:15,375
SO SAYS THE WIZARD SAINT JURA.
OH YEAH.

65
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:19,708
- I CAN'T LOSE,
'CAUSE IF I DO,

66
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:23,208
MY FATHER WILL THINK
I'M UNWORTHY AND ABANDON ME.

67
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,333
I WON'T LET HIM DOWN!

68
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,541
- FLEEING IS FUTILE.
OH YEAH.

69
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,625
WALLS MEAN NOTHING
TO MY HEAVEN'S GAZE.

70
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,500
IT SEES THROUGH
ALL IN ITS PATH.

71
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,208
AHA!

72
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,833
LIQUID GROUND!

73
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,708
- I HAVE TO PROVE TO HIM
THAT I'M WORTHY.

74
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,625
IF I DON'T,
HE'LL CAST ME OUT.

75
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,750
HE'LL LEAVE ME.

76
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:11,625
- THE DIE HAS ALREADY BEEN CAST.
OH YEAH.

77
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:14,083
- AAH!

78
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:18,291
- AS HAVE THE SCATTERED PETALS
OF THE ORACION SEIS,

79
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,166
INTO THE WIND.

80
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,166
- Gray: THERE HE IS.

81
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,583
- Lucy: NATSU!

82
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,583
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

83
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:41,041
- IT'S MOVING.
I JUST CAN'T HANDLE IT.

84
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:47,166
- HEY, GUYS, PLEASE HELP.

85
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,291
- Lucy: ARE YOU OKAY?
- SIR CAT IS STILL ALIVE.

86
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,208
- Both:
ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT HAPPY?

87
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,666
- YOU GUYS GOT TO SAVE NATSU.

88
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,500
BRAIN'S TAKING HIM AWAY.

89
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:00,416
- THE SIX DEMONS HAVE BEEN
CUT DOWN TO A MEAGER THREE.

90
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,375
WE'VE BEEN CHOPPED IN HALF.

91
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,958
SO IN ORDER TO STOP THE BLEEDING
IN OUR ONCE HEALTHY RANKS,

92
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,875
I WILL FORTIFY THEM
WITH THIS ONE.

93
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,958
- I ALWAYS KNEW
THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN SOMEDAY.

94
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,791
ONE OF THESE DARK GUILDS
WAS GONNA TRY

95
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,666
TO PULL NATSU
OVER TO THEIR SIDE.

96
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,833
- YOU MUST BE OUT OF YOUR MIND
IF YOU THINK

97
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,083
YOU'RE EVER GONNA GET THAT
HARD-HEAD TO COOPERATE WITH YOU.

98
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,541
- ONCE NIRVANA
DARKENS HIS HEART,

99
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,333
HE WILL GLADLY DO MY BIDDING.

100
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,041
HIS GOALS AND MY OWN
WILL BE INTERTWINED.

101
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,375
- IN YOUR DREAMS!

102
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,875
- YOU STILL HAVE THE STRENGTH
TO FIGHT?

103
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,916
- UGH!

104
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,416
I AM SO SICK.

105
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,291
- THE SPIRIT IS STRONG,
BUT THE STOMACH WEAK.

106
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:53,833
- YEAH, YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.
KIND OF GETS IN THE WAY.

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
- HELP ME.

108
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,708
PLEASE HELP ME.

109
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,291
I'M BEGGING YA.

110
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,708
BEAT THIS GUY

111
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,875
AND STOP THIS THING.

112
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,916
- OH, WE'RE GONNA STOP IT,
BUT NOT JUST FOR YOUR SAKE.

113
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,083
- YEAH.

114
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,458
- IS THAT SO?

115
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:15,083
YOU'LL STOP NIRVANA?

116
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:18,875
TRY YOUR BEST.

117
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:24,416
BUT YOU MUSTN'T
WASTE ANY TIME.

118
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,333
WE'RE QUICKLY APPROACHING
OUR FIRST TARGET--

119
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:33,625
THE CAIT SHELTER GUILD HALL.

120
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:37,000
- THAT'S THE ONE CARLA
AND WENDY BELONG TO.

121
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,875
WHY THEM?

122
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,875
- ( laughs )

123
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,708
- WHAT IS YOUR OBJECTIVE?

124
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,875
WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY HOPE
TO GAIN FROM THEIR LOSS?

125
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,458
- THE WORLD ON ITS HEAD.

126
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,666
IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE,

127
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,250
THIS GUILD OF LIGHT
WILL BE CONSUMED IN DARKNESS.

128
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,625
OH, THE THINGS WE SHALL SEE.

129
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,958
WHAT SPLENDID HORRORS
AWAIT US.

130
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,625
- WE WON'T LET YOU
DO THAT TO THEM.

131
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:05,958
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET AWAY
WITH THIS, SCUMBAG.

132
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:09,458
- Jura:
YOU STILL HAVEN'T TOLD ME,

133
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,000
WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO GAIN?

134
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:15,500
- ( Brain laughing )

135
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:18,166
I DON'T
HAVE TO ANSWER TO YOU!

136
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,541
I HOLD THE REINS OF LIGHT
AND DARKNESS.

137
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,750
KNEEL BEFORE ME AND ASK
FOR ONE THING ONLY--

138
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,666
FOR MERCY.

139
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,250
- WHAT A BOTHERSOME FOOL.
- POPS, WHAT'RE YOU DOIN'?

140
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:33,458
- HE'S FAR TOO DELUSIONAL
TO HOLD A CONVERSATION.

141
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,916
- YOU HEAR ME?

142
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,083
I ASKED YOU TO KNEEL.

143
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,583
- ( grunts )

144
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,875
- AAH!

145
00:09:56,791 --> 00:10:00,916
- HIS POWER,
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

146
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,708
- STAND UP.
ONCE YOU'VE EXPLAINED

147
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,958
WHY YOU'VE SET YOUR SIGHTS
ON THE CAIT SHELTER GUILD,

148
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,416
THEN I'LL LET YOU REST.

149
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:18,083
- WHOA.  I GUESS BALDY
AIN'T MESSIN' AROUND.

150
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,583
- NO, IT LOOKS
LIKE HE'S PRETTY SERIOUS.

151
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:47,000
- IRON ROCK JURA'S ANOTHER ONE
OF THE 10 WIZARD SAINTS,

152
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,875
JUST LIKE MASTER MAKAROV.

153
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,208
- ( gagging )

154
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,791
- HOW FASCINATING.

155
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,291
I MUST ADMIT,
I'M A BIT SURPRISED,

156
00:10:56,375 --> 00:11:00,125
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME YOUR
STRENGTH MERITS SUCH PRESTIGE.

157
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,833
- I KNOW FOR A FACT

158
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,625
THERE ARE NUMEROUS GUILDS
CLOSER THAN CAIT SHELTER.

159
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,583
TO GO SO FAR OUT OF YOUR WAY,

160
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:10,166
IT BETRAYS
A SPECIFIC INTENTION.

161
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,250
- HMM.

162
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,208
BY THE TIME I REACH THEM,

163
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,500
YOU'LL BE NOTHING
BUT A FADING MEMORY.

164
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:24,958
DARK RONDO!

165
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,916
- IRON ROCK WALL!

166
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,833
- HOLY--

167
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,000
- THAT MOVE WAS TOTALLY AMAZING,
AND A LITTLE SCARY.

168
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,541
- IT IS POINTLESS FOR YOU
TO CONTINUE ATTACKING ME.

169
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,541
I DEMAND AN ANSWER
TO MY QUESTION, BRAIN.

170
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,916
- WHY DO MY REASONS
CONCERN YOU?

171
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,416
- I TOLD YOU,
YOUR ATTACKS ARE POINTLESS.

172
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,250
- ARE THEY NOW?

173
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,916
GOT YOU.
- OVER THERE!

174
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,916
- WATCH OUT!
HE'S RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

175
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,833
- DARK CAPRICCIO!

176
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,250
- HE'S BENDING THE ROCK?

177
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,500
- YOUR DEFENSE IS POINTLESS!

178
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,291
THE DARK CAPRICCIO
PIERCES THROUGH

179
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,791
EVERYTHING IT ENCOUNTERS.

180
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:50,291
THAT ROCK WILL BE RENDERED
AS INEFFECTIVE AS PAPER.

181
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,958
- BUT THAT ROCK WALL
WAS LIKE A HUGE SLAB OF IRON.

182
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,125
- I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M MORE IMPRESSED

183
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,791
BY BRAIN BREAKING THROUGH IT,

184
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,208
OR JURA BEING ABLE
TO DODGE HIS ATTACK.

185
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,833
- YOU MAY NEED TO RETHINK
YOUR CLAIM.

186
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,791
- THAT'S TRUE,
IF RUNNING IS YOUR DEFENSE.

187
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:13,250
SO, WIZARD SAINT,

188
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,125
IS THAT
HOW YOU PLAN TO PROCEED?

189
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,708
DARK CAPRICCIO!

190
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,791
- IRON ROCK WALL!

191
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,625
- ( Brain laughing )

192
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:30,500
SIMPLY DOUBLING DOWN?
IT SEEMS YOU'RE OUT OF IDEAS.

193
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,708
YOU'RE JUST DELAYING
THE INEVITABLE.

194
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,625
NO MATTER HOW MANY WALLS
YOU PUT UP,

195
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:36,916
MY ATTACK WILL REACH YOU.

196
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,708
- ANOTHER FOOLISH CLAIM.
HMMM!

197
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,500
- ANOTHER EVASION?

198
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,916
THIS WILL HIT YOU HEAD ON.

199
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,916
DARK CAPRICCIO-- SCREAM!

200
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,083
- IRON ROCK WALL-- CHAIN!

201
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,916
- YOU NEED
TO GET OUT OF THERE, JURA!

202
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,583
HE TRAPPED BRAIN
UNDERNEATH ALL THOSE ROCKS.

203
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:36,125
- Jura: SUPREME KING ROCK CRUSH!

204
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,500
- THAT WAS AWESOME.

205
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,000
HE TOOK ALL THE BLASTED ROCK
FROM BRAIN'S ATTACK

206
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,458
AND MADE A WHOLE NEW WEAPON
OUT OF IT.

207
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,958
- Gray: NOW I SEE
WHY LYON RESPECTS HIM SO MUCH.

208
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,708
HE DID IT!

209
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:59,916
JURA JUST TOOK DOWN
THE LEADER OF THE ORACION SEIS!

210
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,083
- Lucy: IT'S OVER!

211
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,916
WE WON!

212
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:08,250
- NOW I STILL NEED AN ANSWER

213
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:11,583
AS TO WHY YOU'RE ATTACKING
CAIT SHELTER.

214
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,291
- UM, JURA,

215
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,583
DO YOU THINK
WE CAN STOP THIS THING NOW?

216
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,958
- THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
LIKE, RIGHT NOW!

217
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,500
- NO.

218
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,791
I NEVER IMAGINED
THAT I WOULD FALL LIKE THIS.

219
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:27,208
LOSING A BATTLE
AGAINST A LIGHT GUILD.

220
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,958
PLEASE HEAR MY WORDS,
MIDNIGHT.

221
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,583
YOU'RE OUR LAST REMAINING HOPE.

222
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:36,458
YOU MUST NOT ALLOW
THE SIX PRAYERS TO DISAPPEAR.

223
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:40,458
THEY ARE OUR ONLY HOPE

224
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:44,166
OF KEEPING HIM AT BAY.

225
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,083
- KEEPING WHO AT BAY?

226
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,875
- HOLD ON,
IS IT MY IMAGINATION,

227
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,500
OR DID ONE OF THOSE BLACK LINES
ON HIS FACE JUST DISAPPEAR?

228
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,750
- GRAY, I THINK IT'S MORE LIKE
YOU JUST TRYING TO SCARE ME,

229
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,541
AND IT'S ACTUALLY STARTING
TO WORK.

230
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,875
- Wendy: HEY, GUYS!

231
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,541
- IT'S WENDY.

232
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,125
- JUST AS I THOUGHT--

233
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,375
ONLY THOSE HOOLIGANS
WOULD CAUSE SUCH A RUCKUS.

234
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,875
- CARLA!

235
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,875
- WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

236
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,208
I THINK THIS CITY IS HEADED
STRAIGHT TOWARD

237
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,708
MY GUILD FOR SOME REASON.

238
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,041
- DON'T WORRY,
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

239
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:29,708
HIS BUDDY THE SNAKE CHARMER
IS LYING RIGHT OVER THERE.

240
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,000
- WOW.

241
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,875
- FROM WHAT WE CAN GATHER,

242
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,958
THIS CREEPY BRAIN GUY
IS ALSO THE ONE

243
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,875
WHO HAS BEEN
CONTROLLING NIRVANA.

244
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:43,333
AND NOW THAT HE'S OUT COLD,
THE CITY SHOULD STOP ANY MOMENT.

245
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:46,500
- Wendy:
IT DOESN'T SIT WELL WITH ME.

246
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:49,125
HE IS DOWN, BUT DID
YOU EVER FIND OUT

247
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,041
HIS REASON FOR
TARGETING OUR GUILD?

248
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,041
- NO, I THINK IT'S JUST
'CAUSE

249
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,875
THAT'S THE KIND OF
THING VILLAINS DO.

250
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:00,083
- THEY ARE OUR ONLY HOPE

251
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:03,750
OF KEEPING HIM AT BAY.

252
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,333
- I STILL HAVE
SOME LINGERING CONCERNS,

253
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,000
BUT THE WORST IS OVER.

254
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:14,333
- Natsu: NO.
I DON'T THINK SO.

255
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,791
GUYS, PLEASE
STOP THIS THING.

256
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:25,250
- OH, YOU POOR GUY.
HAVE YOU BEEN POISONED TOO?

257
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,416
- Lucy and Gray: MM-MM.

258
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,958
- SO WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM,
TOMCAT?

259
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,041
DON'T TELL ME THAT YOU'RE
TOO WEAK TO STAND?

260
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,541
- YES, MA'AM.

261
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,833
- ( crashing )

262
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,541
- Midnight: WHILE I SLEEP,

263
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:42,791
I HAVE MANY DREAMS.

264
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,333
I KNOW YOU DO TOO.

265
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,500
AND NIGHTMARES.

266
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,000
- AAH!

267
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:14,083
- MAGIC ATTACKS DON'T HIT ME.

268
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,125
YOU SEE?

269
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:19,458
- ALL OF HIS WOUNDS
HAVE DISAPPEARED!

270
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,750
- FATHER
IS A VERY SKILLED WIZARD.

271
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,333
BUT MY POWER OVERSHADOWS HIS.

272
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,250
- AAH!

273
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,791
( thinking ) MY DEAR BROTHER,

274
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,791
MY PRAYER

275
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,958
WAS TO GAZE UPON YOUR FACE,

276
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,625
JUST ONE MORE TIME.

277
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:55,000
- AND SO THE FIFTH PRAYER
HAS NOW DISAPPEARED.

278
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,166
HEAR ME, MIDNIGHT,

279
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,791
YOU MUST NOT FALL AS WELL.

280
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:03,791
MY PRAYER
IS FOR YOUR STRENGTH.

281
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,958
- NOW I'M TOTALLY CONFUSED.

282
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,625
- NO JOKE.  ME TOO.

283
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,291
- YOU WOULD THINK THERE'D BE
SOME KIND OF CONTROL PANEL

284
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,375
OR SOMETHING UP HERE.

285
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,916
- RIGHT?

286
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,958
SO HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO STOP THIS THING?

287
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,041
- Gray: MAN, THIS SUCKS.

288
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,875
I WAS ALMOST POSITIVE
THAT ONCE WE BEAT BRAIN,

289
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,125
THIS HUNK OF JUNK
WOULD STOP MOVING.

290
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,083
- Lucy: I WAS TOO.

291
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,500
NOW HE'S OUT COLD,
SO WE CAN'T ASK HIM ABOUT IT.

292
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,083
- WHAT'LL WE DO?

293
00:19:57,166 --> 00:20:01,041
I CAST A SPELL TO COUNTERACT
THE VENOM, BUT HE'S STILL SICK.

294
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:04,000
- NATSU AND VEHICLES
DON'T SEEM TO MIX ALL TOO WELL.

295
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,250
- THAT IS SO PATHETIC.

296
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,375
- I REALLY DON'T
THINK MY STOMACH

297
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,541
WANTS TO BE INSIDE ME ANYMORE.

298
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,166
- IT'S MOTION SICKNESS?
- ALWAYS.

299
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,333
- IN THAT CASE...

300
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:18,958
I'LL CAST A SPELL THAT RESTORES
HIS SENSE OF BALANCE.

301
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:22,583
TROIA.

302
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:25,000
- YEAH!
I'M BACK!

303
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,500
OH, I FEEL
A MILLION TIMES BETTER.

304
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:30,375
- I'M GLAD.
I THOUGHT THAT MIGHT WORK.

305
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,541
- OH, YOU'RE A LIFESAVER,
WENDY!

306
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,791
YOU GOTTA TEACH ME
THAT SPELL SOMETIME.

307
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,166
- BUT IT'S MY SKY MAGIC.

308
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,583
SORRY.
- WOW!

309
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:42,291
I DON'T FEEL
LIKE I'M RIDING ON ANYTHING NOW.

310
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,416
HEY, LUCY,

311
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,041
SUMMON ONE OF YOUR TRAIN
OR BOAT SPIRITS FOR ME.

312
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,083
- I DON'T HAVE THOSE!

313
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,833
LOOK, BUDDY,
THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO PLAY.

314
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,583
WE'RE STILL IN BIG TROUBLE!

315
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:56,166
- WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT
HOW TO STOP THIS THING.

316
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,666
AND THERE'S OBVIOUSLY NOTHING
UP HERE THAT'LL HELP US DO THAT.

317
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,541
- Lucy: I DON'T GET IT.

318
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:07,000
I THOUGHT THIS IS WHERE HOTEYE,
I MEAN RICHARD,

319
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,708
SAID BRAIN WAS CONTROLLING IT?

320
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,750
WAS HE LYING?

321
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:14,458
- NO, I BELIEVE HIM
TO BE A MAN OF HIS WORD.

322
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,208
- THERE IS A MUCH
MORE PERTINENT QUESTION AT HAND.

323
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,208
OR SHOULD I SAY,
A DIFFERENT WAY THE QUESTION

324
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:22,208
OF HOW TO STOP IT
SHOULD BE PHRASED?

325
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:25,708
THERE ARE NO VISIBLE CONTROLS,
THE ROYAL THRONE IS EMPTY,

326
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,166
AND THE ONE PRESUMED TO BE
PILOTING IT HAS BEEN DEFEATED.

327
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,291
SO PERHAPS INSTEAD
WE SHOULD ASK,

328
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:33,166
"WHY IS IT STILL FUNCTIONING
THE SAME AS IT WAS BEFORE?"

329
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,625
- DO YOU THINK HE MIGHT'VE
PUT IT ON AUTOPILOT?

330
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:39,583
IF THAT'S THE CASE, IT COULD
BE PROGRAMMED TO FIRE TOO.

331
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,208
- ( sobbing )

332
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:55,416
OUR POOR GUILD
IS IN TROUBLE.

333
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,833
- DON'T WORRY.

334
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,291
WE'LL FIND A WAY TO SAVE THEM.

335
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:04,166
I WON'T LET THIS THING HURT YOUR
FRIENDS. I OWE IT TO YOU.

336
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,375
I'LL STOP IT.

337
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,333
I PROMISE.

338
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,750
- Midnight: AS LONG
AS I'M STILL STANDING,

339
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:36,333
NIRVANA WILL NOT BE STOPPED.

340
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:50,416
- ( singing in Japanese )

341
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,958
- Happy: NATSU, YOU NEED
TO COME UP

342
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:16,708
WITH SOME REALLY DEEP STUFF
TO SAY EVERY NOW AND THEN.

343
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:17,875
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?

344
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,291
I SAY THOSE KIND OF THINGS
ALL THE TIME.

345
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,291
- LIKE WHAT?
- OH, UH, LET ME THINK.

346
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,166
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I'M ALWAYS SAYIN' COOL STUFF

347
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,708
LIKE "I GOT A FIRE
IN MY BELLY"

348
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:26,791
AND "I'M FIRED UP NOW."

349
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,458
STUFF LIKE THAT IS PRETTY
INTENSE, DON'T YA THINK?

350
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:30,416
- THOSE ARE JUST
YOUR CATCHPHRASES.

351
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,958
- Both:
NEXT TIME-- "YOUR WORDS"!

352
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:34,875
- Happy:
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

353
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:37,125
I'M TALKING ABOUT STUFF
THAT'S MORE IMPACTFUL.

354
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:38,875
- OKAY, HOW ABOUT,
"I'M GONNA KICK YOUR BUTT"?

355
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:40,916
- JEEZ,
NOT THAT KIND OF IMPACT.
