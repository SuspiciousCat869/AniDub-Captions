C'mon kiddo.

Your dad's gonna start
worrying if we don't

And this is his
lovely wife, Bisca Connell.

Your dad made it
very clear that

we're responsible for you.

It's still just as bustling

Far from the city center,
there is a place

[MACAO] Why hasn't Romeo
made it back to the guild yet?

with a horrible
assistant like you!

45
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,041
So, is it just me...

46
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,458
[MAX] ...or have we
lost a lotta members?

I guess that's to
be expected, Max.

in the mirror lately?

be your size.

he is now.

Twilight Ogre is the

00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,500
without all those guys.

159
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,625
When we found out that
Tenrou Island had been destroyed

160
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,041
we started searching
for any sign of 'em.

161
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,083
[VIJEETER] But not
a soul turned up.

162
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,000
If the Magic Council's
telling us the truth.

163
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,708
the island was wiped out
by this "Acnologia".

164
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,791
So many different
organizations donated

165
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,750
their time to help us search.

166
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:48,583
Despite our best efforts,
we didn't find a single clue.

167
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,000
[JET] It's not
surprising, though.

168
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,708
The Ether-nano levels we
recorded around Tenrou Island

169
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,375
that day were off the charts.

170
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,000
In fact, the levels were
so high that no living thing

171
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,625
would be able to survive.

172
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,750
Is Acnologia's roar really
powerful enough to do

173
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,666
such horrific damage?

174
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,916
Yes it is.

175
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,791
I just don't think
you understand.

176
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,666
It destroyed an entire
nation all by itself!

177
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,458
There's no way anyone
could face that monster

178
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,833
and live to talk about it.

179
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,625
[DROY] Why did it have
to go and kill our friends?

180
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:23,125
[MAX] Without them,
the guild was doomed.

181
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:27,250
It got weaker and weaker,
and all we could do was watch.

182
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:30,583
And while that happened,
a new guild took over Magnolia.

183
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,583
Well, Maybe it's time
for us to call it quits.

184
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,291
How could you
even suggest that?

185
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,375
Somethin' wrong, Macao?

186
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,708
[MACAO] I'm sorry.

187
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,125
But I don't think
that I can keep this up

188
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,041
for very much longer.

189
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,083
Don't worry,
you're doin' a fine job.

190
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,625
Master.

191
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,208
[MACAO] Poor Romeo.

192
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,333
I haven't seen him smile once

193
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,500
since the day they disappeared.

194
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:15,750
[thunderous engine]

195
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:16,916
What's that sound?

196
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,916
I don't think I like it!

197
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,875
Don't tell me
it's Twilight Ogre again!

198
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,458
A giant flying horse!

199
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,333
[MAX] Is that the
new Blue Pegasus ship?

200
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,125
The Cristina Advance?

201
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:38,041
[ICHIYA] SNIFF SNIFFSNIFF
SNIFF SNIFF SNIFF SNIFF SNIFF

202
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,541
Hang on, is that.

203
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:40,500
No way!

204
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:41,041
Aw.

205
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,375
Not that guy!

206
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,541
[ICHIYA] What is
that foul stench?

207
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:45,750
My, my.

208
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,791
This insipid parfum
is not a pleasant one!

209
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,125
It's A troll!

210
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:50,916
Well, sorta.

211
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,458
What's he
doin' here?

212
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:53,291
[ICHIYA] Troll!

213
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,750
[VIJEETER] He jumped!

214
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,208
[ICHIYA] Sparkle!

215
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,875
[ALL] Whoa, he crash-landed!

216
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,875
[ICHIYA] I apologize
for making you wait.

217
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,375
But Sir Ichiya...

218
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,583
...is at your service.

219
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:13,166
[NARRATOR] This bizarre man
is Ichiya Vandalay Kotobuki

220
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,583
of the Blue Pegasus guild.

221
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:16,875
You okay?

222
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,000
[HIBIKI] You know there are
much better ways of getting off

223
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,041
the ship than jumping, boss.

224
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,833
[REN] Especially when
I can use air magic.

225
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,875
[EVE] Long time,
no see, you guys!

226
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:28,916
Hey.

227
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
[MAX] Hibiki!

228
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,166
[WARREN] Ren!

229
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,416
You're lookin'
a lot older, Macao.

230
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,750
[NAB] Eve!

231
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,541
Wow, It's
Blue Pegasus!

232
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,166
They're so cool!

233
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,750
What in the heck
is this about?

234
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:43,708
Laki.

235
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:44,875
You're as
pretty as ever.

236
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,833
Yeah, you look hot
for a girl in glasses.

237
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,833
May I call
you Big Sis?

238
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,291
Well, uh.

239
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,375
Did you come here
just to pick up chicks?

240
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:55,541
Kinana,

241
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:56,916
you have
plans tonight?

242
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,416
Why do you have to look
so beautiful in that dress?

243
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Tell me.

244
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,458
Would you like to have
a little brother?

245
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,166
Well, uh.

246
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,625
Seriously, what're
you guys doin' here?

247
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,583
[ICHIYA] Cut it out, you three!

248
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,666
We've got business
to attend to.

249
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,833
[ALL THREE] Our apologies, sir!

250
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,208
[MACAO] Hey, Ichiya!

251
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,250
[WAKABA]
What's the deal?

252
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:15,791
Spill it!

253
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:16,750
Man!

254
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,625
I shall never forget
the sweet parfum of friendship

255
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:23,625
we created when we
faced our foes together.

256
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,958
[HIBIKI] We've been flying
Christina around Fiore

257
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,208
to survey Ether-nano
levels in the area.

258
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,583
And if Archive's
data analysis is correct,

259
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,125
all of our hard
work has paid off.

260
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,041
[ICHIYA] Are you
ready for this?

261
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,375
Tenrou Island still exists!

262
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,500
Are you sure we're lookin'
in the right area?

263
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,250
It does seem odd
we haven't seen a thing.

264
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,875
[WARREN] This is where the
Pegasus guys told us to go.

265
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,291
They said there's something up
with the Ether-nano levels.

266
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,166
[MAX] So what is
Ether-nano anyway?

267
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,416
Heck if I know;

268
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,958
I'm guessin' it's magic
particles or something.

269
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,416
Havin' any luck
with your telepathy?

270
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,458
I'm not picking up
anything at all.

271
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:32,750
[BISCA] Y'know hon.

272
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,083
I feel kinda bad
about leaving Romeo behind.

273
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,375
[ALZACK] Me, too.

274
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,500
Maybe we should've
brought him along after all.

275
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,708
Nah, it's better this way
'cause there's no guarantee

276
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:41,833
they're still alive.

277
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,416
That's the grim truth.

278
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,791
There's no point in getting
everyone's hopes up.

279
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,708
[BOTH] We'll see Levy!

280
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,375
[BISCA] Well, so much for
not getting our hopes up.

281
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,708
[ALZACK] I can't say
that I blame 'em, though.

282
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:56,208
Would you
please shut up?

283
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,666
It's been seven years since
we last heard from 'em.

284
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,041
We gotta consider the
worst case scenario.

285
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,583
We know

286
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,250
Sorry guys.

287
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,041
[BISCA] That's weird.

288
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,583
[ALZACK] What is it?

289
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,541
It's like the breeze
just stopped.

290
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,416
Now that you mention it,
it is strangely quiet.

291
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,250
And there's no birds.

292
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,125
Whoa, what's goin' on?

293
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,666
Anyone see that?

294
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,625
A person?

295
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,041
There's no way.

296
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,166
It's floating above the water!

297
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,666
[BISCA] You guys, that
is definitely a person!

298
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:37,875
[MAX] Whoa.

299
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,708
They're standing on the water!

300
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,041
[WARREN] Who could it be?

301
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,708
Oh my gosh,
is that it?

302
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,250
I think so.

303
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,208
It's Tenrow Island!

304
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,083
It came outta nowhere!

305
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:57,416
[WARREN] That girl!

306
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,125
She's headed
to the shore!

307
00:16:59,208 --> 00:16:59,750
[MAX] Quick!

308
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:00,791
Let's follow her!

309
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:01,791
[JET] 'Scuse me, Miss?

310
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,041
[DROY] Wait for us!

311
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,000
[MAX] Hey!

312
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,958
[WARREN] Wait up, will ya?

313
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,750
[BISCA] Any idea
who that girl is?

314
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,250
[ALZACK] Nope, I've got no clue;
all I know is that she helped us

315
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,166
find Tenrou Island!

316
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,083
Maybe she's taking
us to the others!

317
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,125
[DROY] Man! I hope so!

318
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,333
[WARREN] Don't lose her!

319
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,958
[MAX] Go, Jet!

320
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,416
[JET] Right!

321
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
[JET] That's weird.

322
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,666
I should've caught
up to her by now.

323
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:41,458
[MAX] What is it?

324
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,583
[DROY] Yeah What's the deal?

325
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:43,708
[WARREN] Where'd she go?

326
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,291
[ALZACK] Do you see something?

327
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,166
Natsu.

328
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,458
[MACAO] Hey Romeo,
I hope you're not too upset

329
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,500
about stayin' behind.

330
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,083
Nah, Even if
they're lucky enough

331
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,375
to find Tenrou Island.

332
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,291
I doubt that
anybody's still alive.

333
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,125
Don't be such a downer, boy.

334
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,625
You've gotta try to have
just a little faith!

335
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,791
But they've been gone
for seven years.

336
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,250
[TEEBO] Holy cow.

337
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,291
This dump looks even more
deserted than it was yesterday.

338
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,541
Seems less like a guild
and more like a kid's clubhouse.

339
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:37,791
[MACAO] Teebo!

340
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,000
I thought we agreed that
we'll pay ya next month?

341
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,833
Yeah, I mentioned
it to our master.

342
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,708
He said no
way in hell.

343
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,458
He said we're gonna
have a problem if you don't

344
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,083
cough up the money.

345
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,333
You better pay up 'cause
our master always gets

346
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,541
what he wants.

347
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,166
Screw your master!

348
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,750
Watch it, Romeo!

349
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,041
[ROMEO] You're not gettin'
any money from us today.

350
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,458
I suggest you drop
the attitude, brat.

351
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,291
You may be able to boss
Dad and the others

352
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,750
around 'cause they're
scared of standing up to you.

353
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,375
If they won't, I will!

354
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,083
I'm not gonna let you guys
disgrace Fairy Tail's good name!

355
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,916
--[WAKABA] Romeo!
--[MACAO] Stupid kid!

356
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Hate to tell ya.

357
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,416
but the name's
already been disgraced!

358
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,291
Leave my boy alone!

359
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,208
You could train
hard your whole life.

360
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,125
and there's still
no way you'd ever beat me!

361
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,833
[ALL] Who in the hell?

362
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,000
Look who's back!

363
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:53,166
Sorry to keep you
waiting for so long!

364
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,375
[MAKAROV] We're gonna
need a bigger guild hall than...

365
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,875
I can't believe it!

366
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:57,583
No way!

367
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,750
You look so young!

368
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,125
Yeah, it's like you guys
haven't aged a day

369
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,250
in seven years!

370
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,791
Tell us what happened!

371
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,541
Uh, well...

372
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,208
[WARREN] Hey Natsu, wake up!

373
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,291
Pull yourself together!

374
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,166
[MAX] C'mon, man!
You gotta get up!!

375
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,416
[NATSU] Let me sleep jerks!

376
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,833
[ALL] Natsu! You're alive!

377
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,958
Would ya mind
telling me what's goin' on?

378
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,083
What're you guys
doin' on the island?

379
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,041
[NATSU] And why do
you look so much older?

380
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,958
[MAX] You haven't changed
a bit in all this time!

381
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,500
[NATSU] Droy, you're so fat!

382
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,083
[HAPPY groans]

383
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,500
Aw, is it morning already?

384
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,375
Can I have some
fish for breakfast?

385
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,416
[BOTH] Happy!

386
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,000
This is hurtin' my head!

387
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:37,666
It feels like we were just hit
by Acnologia's attack, but now!

388
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,916
I'm so confused!

389
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,625
Wait!

390
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,875
Where's everybody else?

391
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,333
[VOICE] They're over here.

392
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,083
[NATSU and HAPPY] Who're you?

393
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:00,083
Don't worry,
I mean you no harm.

394
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,750
I'm the Fairy Tail
guild's first master.

395
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,708
My name's Mavis Vermilion.

396
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,875
[MAVIS] When the dragon
attacked, I was able to convert

397
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,041
the bonds of trust
and friendship between

398
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,958
your guild mates into
pure magic power.

399
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,708
Their bonds were so strong
that Fairy Sphere

400
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,166
was activated.

401
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,041
One of the Three
Grand Fairy Spells.

402
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,458
It is an absolute
defense spell capable

403
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:36,041
of protecting the guild
from all manner of evil.

404
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,416
Those inside the
impenetrable sphere were

405
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,125
in a suspended state.

406
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,458
It's been seven
long years, but the spell

407
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:47,500
has finally been lifted.

408
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,000
My word!

409
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,958
To think we were saved by
Fairy Tail's founding master!

410
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,000
No, no.

411
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,708
I am incorporeal.

412
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,250
I used what little energy
I had left to convert

413
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,666
your bonds into magic power.

414
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,583
Your unwavering
conviction and your love

415
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:06,125
for one another they are what
brought forth this miracle.

416
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,500
You should be proud
of the Guild you've built.

417
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,166
They're wonderful.

418
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,916
Well that's it.

419
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,000
Look at you, Romeo.

420
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,708
All grown up.

421
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:37,875
Everyone...

422
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:38,916
welcome back.

423
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,250
You're home!

424
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:47,458
♪

425
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:13,541
[NATSU] Holy cow!

426
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,000
Seven years have passed?

427
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,583
You gotta be kiddin' me!

428
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:18,875
[HAPPY] I know it sounds totally
crazy but apparently it's true!

429
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,416
[NATSU] Wait a minute, does that
mean we've aged seven years?

430
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,833
I don't feel like I have!

431
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:24,083
[HAPPY] Nah, I think we're
still the same age because

432
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:25,666
we were frozen in time.

433
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,458
[NATSU] But everybody else in
the guild is seven years older!

434
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:29,125
So when people ask
us how old we are,

435
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:31,000
what're we supposed to tell 'em?

436
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,875
[HAPPY and NATSU] Next
time: The Seven Year Gap!

437
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:35,166
I dunno, maybe we
should just say that

438
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,750
we're all eternal teenagers.

439
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,791
[NATSU] I don't think
that's gonna work for Gramps.

440
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:41,291
[HAPPY] Yeah, who'd mistake
that geezer for a teenager?
