- Narrator: EDOLAS.
IN THIS PARALLEL WORLD,

32
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:14,708
MAGIC IS A RESOURCE
ON THE VERGE OF VANISHING.

33
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:17,875
FEARING A LOSS OF POWER, THE
KING FORBADE THE USE OF MAGIC

34
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,291
AND OUTLAWED ALL MAGICAL GUILDS.

35
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:23,750
DESPITE THIS, A SMALL GROUP
STANDS AGAINST THE TYRANNY

36
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:27,666
OF THE KING AND WORKS TO HELP
THOSE WHO SUFFER UNDER HIS RULE.

37
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,666
ITS NAME...

38
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:34,333
THE DARK GUILD, FAIRY TAIL.

39
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:37,958
MEANWHILE, A GROUP OF WIZARDS
FROM EARTH LAND'S FAIRY TAIL

40
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:41,458
ARE ABOUT TO FACE OFF
AGAINST THE LEADERS

41
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,333
OF EDOLAS' MAGIC WARFARE UNITS.

42
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:47,833
THE LIVES OF THEIR FRIENDS
AND THE FATE OF BOTH WORLDS REST

43
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,333
IN THEIR HANDS.

44
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,250
- WILL YOU BE GOOD ANIMALS

45
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,541
AND GO BACK TO YOUR CAGES
WITHOUT A FIGHT?

46
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,041
- DUDE, YOU DON'T GIVE
THE CATTLE A CHOICE.

47
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,875
YOU JUST MAKE 'EM DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

48
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,791
- WHAT ARE THEY YAMMERING ABOUT?

49
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,416
- WE ALREADY TOOK THEIR POWER.

50
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,625
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO HANDLE
WITH CARE.

51
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,333
- IF CODE ETD PANS OUT
LIKE THE OLD MAN HOPES,

52
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:17,166
THAT JUST MEANS THESE EYESORES
BECOME A WASTE OF SPACE.

53
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,041
IF THERE'S ONE THING WE EXCEL
AT, IT'S CLEARING OUT CLUTTER.

54
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,833
HOPE YOU'RE READY
TO MEET YOUR MAKER.

55
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,125
- INCOMING!

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,875
- ( laughs )

57
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,208
- ( Happy speaking )

58
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,125
( gasps )

59
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:03,875
WHERE'D THAT ICE COME FROM?

60
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:08,791
SO THESE EARTH LAND FREAKS
USE MAGIC LIKE EXCEEDS DO?

61
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:12,333
- I THOUGHT THEIR ITEM-LESS
MAGIC WAS NOTHING BUT RUMORS.

62
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:16,041
IT'S TRULY BREATHTAKING
TO BEHOLD.

63
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,708
- THIS CHUMP'S COMBUSTING.
- AND YOU WILL, TOO.

64
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:27,166
ARE YOU READY TO GIVE
OUR FRIENDS BACK YET?

65
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,875
- SORRY, THAT'S NOT MY CALL.

66
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,666
EVEN IF IT WERE,
IT'D TAKE MORE THAN THAT

67
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,750
TO MAKE ME GIVE UP
ON UNLIMITED POWER.

68
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,625
YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO FACE THE
FACT YOUR FRIENDS ARE HISTORY.

69
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,500
IF YOU HAVEN'T LEARNED
HOW RELENTLESS WE CAN BE,

70
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,541
I'LL JUST HAVE TO
KEEP BEATING THE LESSON IN.

71
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,333
- NATSU, LOOK OUT BEHIND YOU.

72
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,625
( shouts )
WHAT ARE WE STANDING IN?

73
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,250
- I'M NOT SURE WE WANNA
KNOW THE ANSWER.

74
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,000
- YOU'LL HAVE TO DO
BETTER THAN THAT.

75
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:01,625
- I COULD SAY THE SAME TO YOU.
HELL TORNADO.

76
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,333
 HELL WHAT?

77
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:07,166
OH, THAT'S AWESOME.

78
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,250
THAT COASTER'S MAKING
ITS OWN TRACK AS IT GOES.

79
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,500
- YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE HAPPY ABOUT IT.  WHATEVER.

80
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,291
FEAST YOUR EYES ON MY COMMAND
BATON, WHICH ALLOWS ME

81
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,750
TO CONTROL EVERYTHING
IN THE AMUSEMENT PARK

82
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,958
FROM THE ROLLER COASTERS
TO THE CREEPY CLOWNS.

83
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,875
- I DON'T CARE IF YOUR WAND CAN
MAKE THE CASTLE DO THE CHA-CHA.

84
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,416
I WRECK THAT COASTER
AND YOU'RE OUT OF PUPPETS.

85
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,083
- MAY WANNA RETHINK THAT
STRATEGY, LAVA BRAINS.

86
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,708
- HOLD UP, WHAT'D YOU CALL ME?

87
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:31,375
- YOU REALLY THOUGHT I ONLY
HAD ONE?  WHAT A FOOL.

88
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,750
I'VE GOT A WHOLE SYMPHONY
OF HELL COASTERS JUST WAITING

89
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,375
FOR ME TO GUIDE THEM
TO THEIR NEXT VICTIM.

90
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,875
- WHEN I GET OUT OF THIS THING,
YOU'LL BE SORRY.

91
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:44,583
- WE TAKE SAFETY SERIOUSLY, SO
KEEP YOUR LIMBS AND HEAD INTACT

92
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,666
UNTIL YOUR LIFE COMES
TO A COMPLETE STOP.

93
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,333
SEE WHAT I DID THERE?
- ( wincing )

94
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,750
- THE HELL COASTERS
GO TEN TIMES FASTER

95
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,666
WHEN I BOOST THEIR
MAGIC POWER.

96
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,666
THEIR CRUSHING SPEED DEFEATS
EVEN THE TOUGHEST OPPONENTS

97
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,291
WITHIN FIVE MINUTES.
HUH?

98
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,750
IT HASN'T EVEN BEEN TEN SECONDS.

99
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,166
HOW THE HECK HAVE YOU
SURVIVED THIS LONG

100
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,791
WHEN A JOYRIDE CAN
MAKE YOU HURL?

101
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,166
- WE'RE GETTING DEEPER
BY THE SECOND.

102
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,416
- NATSU ISN'T LOOKING SO HOT.

103
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,333
- WE'VE GOT OUR OWN PROBLEM,
IF YOU HADN'T NOTICED.

104
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,500
- LUCY, YOU GOTTA GET HIM
OUT OF THAT COASTER.

105
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,666
- HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DO THAT?

106
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,791
- ( screaming )

107
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,291
- ( laughing )

108
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,333
- ( grunting )

109
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:28,333
- HEY! YOU'RE KIDDING.  WAIT!

110
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,125
- ( screaming )

111
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,208
- NOW GET UP THERE.

112
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,750
- OH!

113
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,916
NATSU!

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,833
GET ME OFF THIS THING.

115
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,250
- WELL, I'LL GIVE HER THIS.
SHE'S BUSTY AND GUTSY.

116
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,750
- NATSU!

117
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,791
- ALL RIGHT, NOW THAT'S DONE.

118
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,291
ICE MAKE GRAPPLING HOOK.
LET'S DO THIS.

119
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,291
- IF YOU COULD PULL OFF
SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON YOUR OWN,

120
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,583
COULDN'T YOU HAVE HELPED FREE
THE DRAGON SLAYER AS WELL?

121
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:13,291
- THEN THERE WOULDN'T BE ANYBODY
LEFT TO REARRANGE YOUR UGLY MUG.

122
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,541
- ( laughs ) YOU CERTAINLY ARE
CONFIDENT, AREN'T YOU?

123
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,458
- ICE MAKE DEATH SCYTHE.

124
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:34,041
- SO IT'S ALL ICE?
MOST IMPRESSIVE...

125
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,500
YES, EARTH LAND MAGIC
IS QUITE VERSATILE.

126
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,041
- DID HE WARP MY ATTACK?

127
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:43,250
- BEHOLD THE POWER
OF MY GLORIOUS MAGIC WEAPON,

128
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,333
THE ROSA ESPADA.

129
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,875
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT YOU THROW AT ME,

130
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,916
THIS SWORD'S MAGIC WILL MAKE IT
AS SOFT AS THE FUR

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,291
ON AN EXCEED'S BACKSIDE.

132
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,916
- COME ON, NATSU,
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER.

133
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I NEED YOUR HELP.
I CAN'T MOVE THESE ARMS.

134
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,666
- GAH, YOU'RE USELESS.
- SORRY.

135
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,541
- ( laughing )

136
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,916
- ( screaming )

137
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,208
- ( whimpering )
- ( laughing )

138
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:35,833
- AM I ALIVE?

139
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:39,291
- HEY, DON'T MISS
THE FINAL TOUCH.

140
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:46,458
- I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE
ENJOYING YOURSELF.  HUH, WATER?

141
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,833
- SO THEN,
HOW DO YOU LIKE EDOLAS' MAGIC?

142
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,208
I KNOW,
YOU THINK IT'S AWESOME.

143
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,458
IF WE HADN'T TURNED
YOUR FRIENDS INTO A LACRIMA,

144
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,041
ONE DAY IT WOULD ALL VANISH.

145
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,541
DON'T EVEN WANNA THINK
ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW?

146
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:02,500
- SO THAT'S THE REASON
YOU TOOK THEM AWAY.

147
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:09,416
YOU'RE GONNA SACRIFICE OUR
FRIENDS AND DESTROY THE EXCEEDS

148
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,208
JUST SO YOU CAN KEEP
YOUR LITTLE TOYS AROUND?

149
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,583
- THAT ABOUT SUMS IT UP.

150
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,291
THEIR DEMISE WILL BRING
OUR SALVATION

151
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,916
THROUGH EVERLASTING MAGIC POWER.

152
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,416
- ENOUGH OF YOUR CRAP.

153
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,875
ALL OF MY FRIENDS
ARE STILL ALIVE IN THERE.

154
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,333
YOU HAD NO RIGHT
TO TAKE THEM.

155
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,333
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT LOSING
YOUR MAGIC POWER

156
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:40,375
SO YOU'RE GONNA DESTROY INNOCENT
PEOPLE TO GET WHAT YOU WANT?

157
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,333
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIVES HERE.

158
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,666
- NATSU.

159
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,291
GET OUT OF THE WAY.

160
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,875
NOW OPEN GATE OF
THE WATER BEARER.

161
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,458
AQUARIUS!

162
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:08,416
DO YOUR THING.
- YEAH, I KNOW.

163
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
- WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU
STALLING FOR?

164
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:21,125
- THE WATER,
I CAN'T CONTROL IT.

165
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:25,291
- ( laughs )
HAVEN'T YOU BEEN LISTENING?

166
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,208
THERE'S NOTHING
IN THIS AMUSEMENT PARK

167
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,333
I CAN'T USE AS A WEAPON
TO UTTERLY DESTROY YOU.

168
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,291
- LUCY, YOU IDIOT,
GET OUT OF THE WAY.

169
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:44,833
- Byro: YOUR MAJESTY, I BRING
YOU THE HAPPIEST OF REPORTS.

170
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:49,083
JUST GIVE THE WORD AND CODE ETD
WILL ENTER ITS FINAL STAGE.

171
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,500
- MEET YOUR END,

172
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,791
YOU FALSE GODS.

173
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,625
- Byro: THE MAGIC
POWER I EXTRACTED

174
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,833
FROM THE DRAGON SLAYERS WAS MORE
THAN WE'D HOPED.

175
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,125
WITH IT, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE
TO LATCH ONTO AND CONTROL

176
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:22,333
ANY FLOATING ISLAND
AS YOU SEE FIT.

177
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:26,333
I DARESAY IT'S RATHER OBVIOUS
WHICH WE SHOULD CHOOSE.

178
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:29,041
THE ONE WHERE OUR GLORIOUS
LACRIMA IS PERCHED.

179
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,541
JUST IMAGINE IT CRASHING
INTO THAT WRETCHED HIVE

180
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,666
OF FELINE SCUM.  THE COLLISION
WILL VAPORIZE THEM BOTH,

181
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,291
AND THE ESSENCE OF THE EARTH
LANDERS WILL FUSE WITH THAT

182
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,041
OF THE EXCEEDS.

183
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,750
EVERLASTING MAGIC POWER
WILL RAIN DOWN UPON US.

184
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,916
( laughs )

185
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:51,833
- Narrator: EDOLAS MAGIC,
THE DRAGON CHAIN CANNON.

186
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,708
IT'S A DEVICE FOR FOCUSING

187
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,583
AND RELEASING THE MAGIC POWER
OF DRAGONS.

188
00:11:56,666 --> 00:12:00,333
HOWEVER, IN ITS CURRENT STATE,
IT IS NOT A USABLE WEAPON.

189
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,708
- HERE, MY LORD.

190
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,166
TAKE THE KEY THAT WILL
END THE FALSE GODS.

191
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,333
- YOUR MAJESTY!

192
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,791
PLEASE, WAIT.
DON'T USE IT YET.

193
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:13,500
- NOW, COCO, HOW MANY TIMES HAVE
I TOLD YOU NOT TO SCAMPER AROUND

194
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,708
LIKE A TODDLER WHEN YOU'RE
IN THE PRESENCE OF OUR KING?

195
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,583
- DON'T ACTIVATE IT.

196
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,208
LILY'S ON THE LACRIMA ISLAND
FIGHTING THE EARTH LAND WIZARDS.

197
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,666
- IMPRESSIVE
FOR A GIANT FURBALL.

198
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,875
- SO THIS IS THE TYPE OF MAGIC
EARTH LANDERS USE.  INTERESTING.

199
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:37,416
- FIGURES I'D COME TO ANOTHER
WORLD TO FIND A CHALLENGE.

200
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,375
LET'S KICK IT UP A NOTCH AND SEE
WHO CAN DRAW THE FIRST BLOOD.

201
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,750
- I DON'T THINK I'LL BE ABLE
TO CARRY YOU FOR VERY LONG.

202
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,541
- YOU'RE A LOT HEAVIER
THAN NATSU.

203
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,708
THEN AGAIN, I HAVEN'T DROPPED
BIG OLD LUCY YET.

204
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,375
- YOU SURE YOU SHOULD BE SAYING
SOMETHING LIKE THAT OUT LOUD?

205
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,541
WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE'D DO
IF SHE HEARD YA?

206
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:50,708
- SORRY, LUCY, JUST KIDDING.

207
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,458
- LET ME DOWN.
- YOU SURE?

208
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,666
DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT HAVING
SALAMANDER'S CAT

209
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,333
HAUL ME AROUND.  TILL I
CAN FIND MY OWN FLYING CAT,

210
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,750
I'LL SKIP OUT ON THE AERIAL
BRAWLING AND WORK MY MAGIC

211
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,250
ON GOOD OLD DIRT.
- WHATEVER YOU SAY.

212
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,166
- MAGIC POWER
TRANSMISSION COMPLETE.

213
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,291
BUSTERMARM REDEPLOY.

214
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,208
- GOTTA GIVE THE GUY PROPS FOR
CARRYING THAT THING EVERYWHERE.

215
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:17,416
- NO KIDDING.  IF ONE
PANTHERLILY EQUALS ONE PANTHER

216
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,333
IN LENGTH, THEN THE SWORD'S
EQUAL TO FOUR PANTHERS LONG.

217
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,833
- NO ONE CARES ABOUT THAT.
THEY JUST WANNA SEE A FIGHT.

218
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,875
- YOU MUST BE QUITE CONFIDENT
TO START PLAYING GAMES

219
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,708
IN THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLE.

220
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,500
- HE DID THAT
WITH ONE CLEAN STRIKE.

221
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,583
- SO NOT ONLY IS THE THING
FREAKISHLY HUGE,

222
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,750
BUT THE GUY BEHIND IT KNOWS
WHAT HE'S DOING WITH IT.

223
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,916
- WHEN BUSTERMARM AND I ARE
THROUGH WITH YOU,

224
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,291
YOU'LL BE NOTHING BUT A FADED
STAIN OF RUST

225
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,250
ON HIS GLEAMING CROSS GUARD.

226
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,916
- I'M COOL WITH THAT.

227
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,833
A STAIN OF RUST IS LIKE
A BADGE OF HONOR TO ME.

228
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,416
- YOU WANNA TALK METAL,
GAJEEL'S DEFINITELY YOUR MAN.

229
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,458
- READY?
- COME ON.

230
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:03,166
- ( shouts )

231
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,583
( laughs )

232
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,833
- IF YOU EXECUTE CODE ETD'S
FINAL STAGE RIGHT NOW,

233
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,875
YOU'LL EXECUTE LILY, TOO.

234
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:13,916
( gasps )

235
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,958
- WHY SHOULD THAT MATTER TO ME?

236
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:20,833
- BUT HE'S ONE OF OUR COMRADES.

237
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:24,083
- COME NOW SACRIFICES FOR THE
GREATER GOOD ARE TO BE EXPECTED

238
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,666
DURING TIMES OF WAR.
- NO FAIR.

239
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,250
I DON'T WANT LILY TO BE A
SACRIFICE 'CAUSE HE'S MY FRIEND.

240
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,041
- WE CANNOT AFFORD TO RISK
OUR KINGDOM FOR THE FATE

241
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,875
OF SOME HAS-BEEN
EXCEED WRETCH.

242
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,500
- WHY ARE YOU BEING SO MEAN?

243
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,750
I WON'T LET YOU DO THIS.

244
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:43,083
- WAIT!
COME BACK HERE NOW.

245
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:47,000
- COCO!
- OH!

246
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,791
- YOU'VE LOVED TO RUN SINCE
THE MOMENT YOU COULD STAND,

247
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:55,250
HAVEN'T YOU, CHILD?
- ( crying )

248
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:01,291
- AND MUCH LIKE A FATHER,
I'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED WATCHING YOU

249
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,583
SPRINT ABOUT
WITH CAREFREE ENTHUSIASM.

250
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,208
- ( screaming )

251
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,750
- BUT IF YOU DON'T
HAND OVER THAT KEY.

252
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,083
COCO!

253
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:25,000
BYRO, CAPTURE HER.
DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.

254
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,166
- YES, RIGHT AWAY.

255
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:30,500
- IT HURTS SO MUCH....

256
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,708
RUNNING HAS NEVER
BROUGHT ME PAIN BEFORE.

257
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,458
WHY, YOUR MAJESTY?

258
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,708
I WANT EVERLASTING MAGIC POWER
JUST LIKE YOU DO,

259
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,791
BUT I DON'T WANT LILY TO DIE
JUST SO I CAN HAVE IT.

260
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,541
WHAT DO I DO?

261
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,750
- ( coughs )

262
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,000
NOW WHERE AM I?
AND WHERE'S LUCY?

263
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,583
YOU'RE NOT DEAD, ARE YOU?
YELL IF YOU'RE DEAD....

264
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:10,041
HEY!
- Lucy: NATSU, IS THAT YOU?

265
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:13,958
I'M TRAPPED IN THIS THING.
GET ME OUT OF HERE.

266
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,583
- THIS IS NO TIME TO BE PLAYING
IN A BOX, YOU KNOW?

267
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:20,625
- WHEN I WOKE UP I WAS ALREADY
STUCK IN HERE, SO GET ME OUT.

268
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,125
WHAT'S WITH
THE CREEPY EXPRESSION?

269
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,375
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING WEARING
A GENIE OUTFIT?

270
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,375
- HMM? ( screams )

271
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,625
- "THE COMPLETE TRANSFORMATION
ACTOR'S BOX.

272
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,208
COME WITH US AND ENJOY
THE LAND OF FAIRY TALES

273
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,833
WITH SOME FUN AND EXCITING
TRANSFORMATIONS

274
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,166
THAT EVERYONE WILL ENJOY."
- FUN AND EXCITING?

275
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,666
- I THINK THIS DIAL ON THE SIDE
CONTROLS THE COSTUME CHANGES.

276
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,416
- MY REAL CLOTHES BETTER BE
IN THERE.

277
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,083
- OKAY, HERE GOES.

278
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,291
- ( laughing )

279
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:06,291
- QUIT PLAYING!
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

280
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,125
- ( laughs )

281
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,708
- WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT
NOT PLAYING AROUND ANYMORE?

282
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:17,291
- Hughes: COME OUT, COME OUT,
WHEREVER YOU ARE,

283
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:20,125
EARTH LAND TRASH.
- LOOKS LIKE HE FOUND US.

284
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,625
- YOU CAN'T SOUND COOL
WHEN YOU LOOK LIKE A PERVERT.

285
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,458
WHY AM I STILL
IN THIS STUPID SWIMSUIT?

286
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,625
NOW CHANGE ME BACK
BEFORE THAT CREEP GETS A PEEP.

287
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:30,458
HEY, WHAT'S WITH THE STARING?

288
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,500
I JUST FIGURED OUT HOW WE'RE
GONNA BEAT THIS GUY.

289
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:39,458
- THEY MUST BE WEAKER THAN I
THOUGHT IF I MADE 'EM FLY AWAY.

290
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:42,500
OR THEY'RE SETTING UP
SOME LAME AMBUSH.

291
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,958
EITHER WAY, I'M NOT WASTING
ANOTHER SECOND LOOKING FOR--

292
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:48,375
HEY.
WHAT'S UP, STUD MUFFIN?

293
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,916
- ( laughs )

294
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,875
- ( roaring )

295
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,250
- THAT IS SO NOT WHAT
I WAS GOING FOR.

296
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,208
- I THOUGHT THE MONSTERS MIGHT
THINK YOU'RE KIND OF CUTE.

297
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,375
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I LET YOU TALK ME INTO THIS.

298
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,166
HEY, WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH ALL
THE CHEESY MONSTERS IN UNIFORM?

299
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,041
( screaming )

300
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,250
- THESE ARE THE STUDENTS
OF THE MONSTER ACADEMY.

301
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,416
IN THIS ATTRACTION, YOU GET
A PEEK INTO THE SCHOOL LIFE

302
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,291
OF EVERY DEMON, GOBLIN AND
BLOODSUCKER THAT'S EVER LIVED.

303
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,875
- WHY DOES THIS ALWAYS
HAPPEN TO ME?

304
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,666
THE VERY LEAST YOU COULD DO
IS LET ME CHANGE BACK

305
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,250
INTO MY NORMAL CLOTHES.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

306
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:28,041
- RUNNING FOR MY LIFE,
SO HELP ME!

307
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:31,958
- NO, NO, THAT'S THE COMPLETE
OPPOSITE OF CUTENESS.

308
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,750
- WELL, EXCUSE ME.

309
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,666
- I THOUGHT THOSE THINGS WENT
FOR THE DAMSEL IN DISTRESS.

310
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,666
- ( laughing )

311
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,666
- GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THIS THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.

312
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,666
- YOU WANNA THROW DOWN WITH ME
INSIDE MY MONSTER ACADEMY?

313
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,500
IF YOU'RE READY
TO TAKE YOUR FINAL BREATH,

314
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,625
I'D BE HAPPY TO OBLIGE.
- HOW KIND OF YOU.

315
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,250
BUT DON'T GET COCKY.
I'M NOT READY TO CHECK OUT YET.

316
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,541
MUMMY BANDAGE!

317
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:03,416
- EVERY MONSTER INSIDE THIS
ACADEMY IS A PERFECT SOLDIER

318
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,708
THAT WILL FOLLOW ANY ORDER
I GIVE 'EM.  PRETTY SWEET, HUH?

319
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,958
- YOU'LL HAVE TO
DO BETTER THAN THAT. ( shouts )

320
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,416
- WHAT?

321
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,416
HIS ENTIRE BODY IS ON FIRE.

322
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,333
- THAT'S RIGHT, BUB.
FIRE DRAGON TALON!

323
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,500
FRANKEN KNUCKLE!

324
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,875
- ( grunting )

325
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,791
- HE'S STRONG ENOUGH
TO BEAT FRANK?

326
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,666
COME TO ME NOW,
MONSTER ARMY.

327
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,708
DEFEND YOUR MASTER
WITH YOUR LIVES.

328
00:19:56,791 --> 00:20:00,125
NO!  NO!

329
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,166
- ( laughing )

330
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,791
- LET'S SEE HOW YOU FARE

331
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:16,416
WHEN THE ENTIRE STUDENT BODY
WANTS YOU IN A COFFIN.

332
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,541
- MY TURN.

333
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,041
- WHY ARE YOU STANDING AROUND?

334
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,583
DESTROY HIM RIGHT NOW.

335
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,166
WHAT?

336
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,500
I'M FREAKING OUT HERE.

337
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,625
- ( growling )

338
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:29,875
- A REAL MONSTER.

339
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,916
- STUPID MONSTER STUDENTS
LEAVE ME ALONE AND GO BACK

340
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,916
TO YOUR AWKWARD LIFE
OF HOMEWORK AND BOYFRIENDS.

341
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:41,833
- OW!

342
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:45,416
- MAN, THAT HURT.
THE MONSTERS VANISHED.

343
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,875
BUT I THINK I KILLED HER.
- ( groaning )

344
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:51,375
- HUH?  YOUR FEET ARE
IN PRETTY ROUGH SHAPE.

345
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,625
WHAT HAPPENED?
ARE YOU OKAY?

346
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:56,625
- HELP ME, I CAN'T RUN ANYMORE.

347
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,791
- COCO, COME BACK HERE.

348
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,916
- YOU HAVE TO HELP ME, PLEASE.
- HUH?

349
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
- TAKE THIS...

350
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,125
WAIT A MINUTE.

351
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,791
SHE'S ONE OF THE EARTH LAND
WIZARDS THAT WE CAPTURED.

352
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,208
THIS IS BAD.
I CAN'T GIVE IT TO HER.

353
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,541
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

354
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,208
- I SHALL WARN YOU JUST
ONE MORE TIME.

355
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,791
HAND OVER THE KEY
OR YOU'LL REGRET IT.

356
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:23,208
- MY KEYS?  YOU WANNA STEAL 'EM
AND ENSLAVE MY SPIRITS.

357
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:26,000
- HUH?

358
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,208
- LIKE I'D LET YOU LAY
A FINGER ON 'EM.

359
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:31,750
- I DON'T THINK SHE UNDERSTANDS
WHAT'S GOING ON.

360
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,750
- DON'T YOU WORRY, KID.

361
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:41,750
RELAX.
I WON'T LET HIM HURT US.

362
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:44,250
- ( theme music playing )

363
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,708
- ( singing in Japanese )

364
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:14,708
- Natsu: WAIT A SEC.
WHERE'D LUCY RUN OFF TO?

365
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:17,916
- Happy: LAST I SAW HER, DRACULA
WAS TRYING TO GET IN A NIBBLE.

366
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,333
- IN OTHER WORDS, SHE'S GOOFING
AROUND, RIGHT?  WHATEVER.

367
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:22,916
COME TO THINK OF IT, GRAY AND
THAT CHIN DUDE ARE GONE, TOO.

368
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,333
- NO WAY!
THE CHEEKY CHIN CHAP?

369
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:26,333
THE CHEATING CHUMP WHO CHOSE
TO CHIDE OUR CHUM?

370
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:27,958
- RUN THAT BY ME AGAIN.

371
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:30,333
CHIN CHUMP IS DOING
WHAT TO OUR CHUM?

372
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:32,958
- ( Happy and Natsu speaking )

373
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:35,750
- DID YOU SEE THAT?

374
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,916
THERE WAS A "WHOOSH"
AND THE CHIN GUY WENT FLYING.

375
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,375
- HIS CHIN'S GOT WINGS?

376
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:41,958
- THAT BRINGS UP
A DISTURBING MENTAL IMAGE.
