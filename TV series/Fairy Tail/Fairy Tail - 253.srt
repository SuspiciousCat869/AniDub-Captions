1
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,791
[SILVER] It wasn't the
Dragon Slayer. It was you.

2
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,541
[GRAY]
Ice Make.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,041
[GRAY]
Vambrace!

4
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:24,500
[GRAY] You lied to me.
You aren't Deliora.

5
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,875
You're my dad. I know you are.

6
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:35,416
[SILVER] Don't leave me
hangin', kid. Finish it.

7
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,916
[GRAY]
Like hell I will!

8
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,083
I'm your son, and you
owe me some answers!

9
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:44,333
What do you want from me?
Why are you doing all this?

10
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,041
[SILVER] Because what I want
more than anything else

11
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,666
in this world, is
for you to kill me.

12
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,500
Once upon a time, I was
a very different man.

13
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,916
Back then, I was your father.

14
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,291
But now...

15
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,958
[SILVER]
Now I'm just a walking corpse.

16
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:17,750
[SILVER] A dead body
that never got buried.

17
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,333
Seventeen years.

18
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,166
My life was taken from me.

19
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,916
I've been waiting on
the grave ever since.

20
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,541
[KEYES] The apocryphal
tale comes to its end.

21
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:56,833
What follows is dark
truth, colder than stone.

22
00:03:56,916 --> 00:04:01,250
No. You're wrong! That
man can't be his father!

23
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,291
You're lying to me.

24
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:06,083
[KEYES] Truth is not
subject to what you believe.

25
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:09,208
I was there at the
story's beginning.

26
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,875
[JUVIA] Why are you so
proud? What did you do?

27
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,958
[SILVER] That old bag
of bones, the necromancer,

28
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,875
uses dead bodies like puppets.

29
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,083
But with me, he wanted
to change things up

30
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,000
and try something different.

31
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,416
What do you mean?

32
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,541
[SILVER] He was getting bored
with just making corpses

33
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,250
do his bidding.

34
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,208
He wanted to make
one live again.

35
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:35,333
There was no special reason
he chose me, just dumb luck,

36
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:38,750
and somehow I've been able
to keep living for this long.

37
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:42,166
But then again, I wouldn't
call this living.

38
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,625
Years of going crazy.

39
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,166
All I could think about
was getting revenge.

40
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,125
Killing the demons that
took my family from me.

41
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,291
[SILVER]
I was in some strange lie.

42
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,958
I was in a Guild of Demons,

43
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:59,041
but I slayed as many as I
could without them knowing.

44
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:03,291
Sorry about freezing that
village. That was a mistake.

45
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:07,250
Thing sure looked like
a demon to me. Heh.

46
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,250
Anyway, I had a plan.

47
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,375
I would get rid of all the
other demons I could find.

48
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:17,750
Then, get started on my
"partners" in Tartaros.

49
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,666
But... one day...

50
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,625
[SILVER]
I saw you.

51
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,750
I thought you had died
alongside Mika and me.

52
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:40,708
[CROWD cheering]

53
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,500
[SILVER] And I made
a realization that day.

54
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:48,708
[SILVER]
My hands were stained in blood.

55
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:53,166
After all I had done, I
wasn't fit to take revenge.

56
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,416
I didn't deserve it anymore.

57
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:03,083
[GRAY] So instead,
you just wanted to die?

58
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:06,041
[SILVER] I told ya,
I've been dead too long.

59
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,083
I just wanted it to be over.

60
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:13,708
My revenge. I needed
you to carry it out.

61
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,500
Is that what this is?

62
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,000
Why did you make me go
through all this crap?

63
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:18,916
[gasps]

64
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,916
[GRAY]
You killed my family.

65
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,625
And then, you killed
my master, too!

66
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,125
I'll do anything to stop you!

67
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,791
[SILVER]
It's gonna be okay.

68
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:41,250
Even after all this,
I know you'll be just fine.

69
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:47,583
I acted like a
monster to you, son.

70
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:50,416
I know that I hurt you.

71
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,708
I hope you'll forgive me.

72
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,916
[GRAY]
He did it all to help me.

73
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,833
I had to face the demon
haunting me and slay it.

74
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,708
Probably best if you
just put me behind you.

75
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:12,500
I mean, I died such
a long time ago.

76
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,125
[GRAY]
How could I do that?

77
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:17,333
Whatever happened,
you're still my dad!

78
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,500
[SILVER]
No.

79
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:24,583
A man who'd dream of hurting
his own child is no father.

80
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,250
[GRAY]
That's not you.

81
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:30,333
[SILVER] I'm done talking.
Just finish me off.

82
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,875
You just wanna be able
to rest in peace?

83
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:47,708
I do. And be with your mother.

84
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,291
[SILVER]
Do it!

85
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,583
I deserve to die
for what I've done!

86
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,916
For Face! For murdering
those council members!

87
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,333
I'm your enemy! So kill me!

88
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,750
[GRAY]
You're right.

89
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:18,541
Even if you're really
my father by blood,

90
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,083
you're still an
enemy of Fairy Tail.

91
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,458
Our guild is bound by
something stronger than blood.

92
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,833
And we punish those
who do us wrong.

93
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,375
You live exactly as you should.

94
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,916
[GRAY]
I know!

95
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,750
But I could never bring
myself to kill you, dad!

96
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:56,833
[GRAY]
I can't... I just can't.

97
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,333
[SILVER] That's because
you're a good person.

98
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,458
No matter what happens,

99
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,375
this body isn't gonna
last much longer.

100
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,750
I've missed you so much, Dad.

101
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,166
[SILVER]
I know.

102
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,541
[SILVER]
I missed you too, son.

103
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:39,250
I'm proud of the man that
you've grown up to be. So proud.

104
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,375
I wish your mother could
see who you've become.

105
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:46,416
[GRAY crying]

106
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,458
[SILVER]
Hey, girl, can you hear me?

107
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,375
[JUVIA]
Who is this?

108
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,833
[SILVER]
Just making sure,

109
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,333
but you're Gray's
girlfriend, right?

110
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:07,041
[JUVIA gasping]

111
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:10,333
[JUVIA] Uh, that's way
too complicated to answer.

112
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,166
Wait, is this his father?

113
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,583
[SILVER]
Yeah, listen.

114
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,166
We don't have a whole
lotta time here,

115
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,458
so let me get to the point.

116
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,208
That decrepit old skeleton
you're fightin' right now,

117
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,333
that's Keyes.

118
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,166
He's the weakest
of the Demon Gates.

119
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,125
You gotta find
a way to beat him.

120
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:30,666
He's a necromancer, and he's in
control of that old Chairman.

121
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,208
He's using the dead guy's corpse

122
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:35,666
to launch a few thousand
of those Face bombs.

123
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,083
[JUVIA] No. There are
thousands of those things?

124
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,958
[SILVER]
Yeah, and they're gonna go off

125
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:45,916
unless you can take that bag
of bones down real soon.

126
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,833
[JUVIA] But, sir, if I do that,
won't it kill you, too?

127
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,250
[SILVER]
I guess Keyes told ya that.

128
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:58,125
Oh well, you have to do it.
It's the only way to save Gray.

129
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,416
[NATSU yells]

130
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,750
[TEMPESTER]
Whoosh.

131
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,125
I'm gettin' real sick
of all this crap!

132
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,375

133
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,625
[screaming]

134
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:17,166
The more you howl, the more
you continue to prove my point.

135
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,375
So how 'bout I prove
another point?

136
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:22,125
The one at the end of my fist!

137
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,708

138
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:25,750
[TORAFUZAR]
Heh.

139
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:26,791
[GAJEEL grunts]

140
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,666
[TORAFUZAR] These techniques
are all quite fascinating.

141
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,000
I ain't puttin'
on a show for ya!

142
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,625
Scumbag.

143
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,333
I'm a demon.

144
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:39,041
But what's most fascinating
is you're still alive.

145
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,250
I had no idea humans
like you even existed.

146
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,791
[GAJEEL] And I didn't believe
in shark demons till now.

147
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:49,625
I've never seen Nastu and Gajeel
struggle so much to win a fight.

148
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,416
And Juvia too.

149
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,916
[JUVIA screaming]

150
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,333
[JUVIA]
Sir, are you still there?

151
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,958
Sir, please!

152
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,958
[JUVIA]
I can't hear him anymore.

153
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,750
But if this will
help my darling...

154
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,958
[JUVIA] I'll do whatever
it takes. I can't lose Gray.

155
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,666
[LECTOR]
Holy cow.

156
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,500
Did you guys hear
that explosion?

157
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,583
Sounds like Sting and
Rogue are wreckin' it!

158
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,541
Yeah. Boom!

159
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,583
I think everybody's
fightin' out there.

160
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,708
So we need to hurry
and do our part.

161
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,083
Let's go!

162
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,833
Hey, Toadstool!

163
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,166
Which way do we go from here?

164
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,958
Say what? Do not
insult me like that!

165
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,916
Looks can be deceiving,
ya pipsqueak.

166
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,750
I am one of the terrifying
Nine Demon Gates, ya know?

167
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:12,333
As if I'd ever take orders from
a talking kitty cat, anyway.

168
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,583
How about taking orders

169
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,666
from someone who could
crush you into putty?

170
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,333
[FRANMALTH] That's a very
convincing argument!

171
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:20,208
Okay, we need to go to
the right! To the right!

172
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,791
[HAPPY]
There's a wall over there!

173
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:26,708
Well, I suppose I was wrong.
I'm incredibly sorry.

174
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,250
Maybe it's just a little
bit farther over that way.

175
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,250
Uh, I'm just a wee
bit disoriented.

176
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,000
[yelps]

177
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,583
[FRANMALTH] It's another 50
paces up and to the left!

178
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:41,000
I don't trust this "whatever
he is" to lead us the right way.

179
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,375
[FROSCH] He's just not
good with directions.

180
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,250
Your injuries, are
they still as painful?

181
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,083
[MINERVA (NEO)]
No.

182
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,500
Well, a little better.

183
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,500
Ya know, all ya gotta
do is say the word

184
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,750
and me and Frosch here
will carry ya, m'lady.

185
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,375
We don't mind at all!

186
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,958
Using our Aera magic to
fly us wherever we gotta go

187
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,458
isn't such a bad idea.

188
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,375
If this fungal freak
would tell us the way,

189
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,875
we could fly there right now.

190
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,000
Erza's put on a couple
of pounds since the games,

191
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:09,166
but I'll bet that you and me can
probably carry her together.

192
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,750
Hey, do you want to die?

193
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:15,541
Did I hear somebody mention that
they wanted to die, just now?

194
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,583
[HAPPY, PANTHERLILY]
No, ma'am!

195
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,375
[LECTOR]
I don't wanna be a downer,

196
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,125
but this looks like a dead end.

197
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,750
[FROSCH]
That's super dead.

198
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,833
Now listen closely,
Shitake-head!

199
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,833
If you waste a nanosecond
more of my time,

200
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,000
I will dice you into
Pantherlily's chow!

201
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,458
I don't eat chow!

202
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,000
Wah! Wah! Wah!

203
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,416
This place is kinda in a mess
right now because you guys

204
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,291
started wreckin' it the
minute you got here!

205
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,583
So, just cut me a little bit of
slack for having to recalibrate

206
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,666
all of my routes to get
to the control room.

207
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,250
No one else would!

208
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,375
Last time I checked that
makes me invaluable!

209
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,250
Does it?

210
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,625
I think she's doing all she can

211
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,416
to keep from making him
into a soup right now.

212
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,875
He's less than one second away

213
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,666
from becoming cat
food, at least!

214
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,791
[FRANMALTH] Oh! Okay, okay,
I know I've said this before,

215
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,458
but I am truly sorry for taking
up your precious time, ma'am.

216
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,166
I just figured out how
to get around this!

217
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,666
Don't lie to me.

218
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,583
If you do, that's gonna be
the last thing outta your mouth

219
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:06,666
besides screams of agony!

220
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,583
I don't believe a thing he says.

221
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,000
Truthfully speaking,

222
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,833
in the presence of such
beautiful ladies as yourselves,

223
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,625
I tend to just lose
my head completely!

224
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,500
Stop stalling and
tell us the way!

225
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,166
This is exactly how we
started this whole thing!

226
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,916
It's like déjà-vu!

227
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,666
Let's go!

228
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,250
Aye aye, Sir!

229
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:36,791
[KEYES] I foresaw this entire
tale unfolding from the start.

230
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,750
Even Silver's eventual mutiny.

231
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,708
Any fool could've seen it.

232
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:45,666
He grew more powerful, mastering
Ice Demon Slaying Magic.

233
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,625
I knew he would
someday use that skill

234
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,750
to enact his vengeance upon us.

235
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,000
But, as his creator,
I relished it.

236
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,750
I wanted that cold
fire to keep burning.

237
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:58,125
That righteous fury would ensure
my most beloved experiment

238
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,958
kept going for years
into the future.

239
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,541
Ha, ha. The ultimate automaton,

240
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:07,333
a relentless drive paired
with a compelling narrative.

241
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,375
You're playing with
people's lives!

242
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,916
[KEYES]
Such a delicious ironic tragedy,

243
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,083
a dead man and a living boy

244
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,166
writing each other's
final chapter.

245
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,333
It's my master work.

246
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:21,333
And it's more than
worth every single drop

247
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:24,041
of blood shed for its ink.

248
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,875
Human beings aren't
meant to be played with

249
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,916
like your personal toys!

250
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,750
[KEYES]
No, not toys.

251
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:33,125
They are subjects
for my experiments.

252
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,791
[JUVIA]
You're disgusting.

253
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,875
Enjoying people's pain
like entertainment.

[KEYES chuckles]

256
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,833
[KEYES] But human pain
is so entertaining.

257
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,791
Yours is turning out to
be quite the spectacle.

258
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,458
Perhaps I can use your
pain of losing the boy

259
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,708
to make your corpse
do unspeakable things.

[JUVIA]
Never!

261
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,041
You will never control me!

262
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:03,875
[KEYES] Such bold words,
motivated by fear.

263
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:07,166
Don't forget that
if I'm defeated...

264
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,583
...your precious Gray
will lose his father,

right before his eyes. Again.

266

Those tormented
cries are lovely,

267

but surely you can do more
than squirm, water wielder.

nothing short of infuriating.

of your true love's
dearly departed father.

However, I'm sure it

00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,875
[KEYES] How could I
have been so careless?

315
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:05,625
I've been bested by
pathetic human magic?

316
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:10,125
[JUVIA] My darling Gray will
never truly lose his father.

317
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,833
You won't break their bond!

318
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:16,875
[KEYES screaming]

319
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,083
He'll live on forever
in his heart!

320
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:22,833
You will never erase him
from that sacred place!

321
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,416
No one can!

322
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,583
Because true love will always
outlast death, no matter what!

323
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,416
[NATSU chuckles]

324
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,833
[GAJEEL chuckles]

325
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,875
Juvia.

326
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:44,000
[JUVIA crying]

327
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:49,958
[KEYES] It's over. My tale
has finally reached its end.

328
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:55,958
Keyes is gone. She killed him.

329
00:20:56,041 --> 00:21:02,041
[JUVIA crying]

330
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,125
[JUVIA]
Please forgive me, my darling.

331
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:07,791
It was all for
your sake, I swear.

332
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:11,000
[SILVER]
You released me. Thank you.

333
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,166
[JUVIA]
Sir, I...

334
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,291
[SILVER]
That's quite a day, kiddo.

335
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,125
You ended my suffering,

336
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,916
and saved all the
magic in the world.

337
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,583
[JUVIA]
I don't know what to say.

338
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,041
[SILVER]
You don't need to say anything.

339
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,500
[SILVER]
Just take care of my boy.

340
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,375
[JUVIA]
I will.

341
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:52,333
[GRAY] Goodbye, Dad.
I hope you can rest in peace.

342
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,625
[SILVER]
You have to finish my story.

343
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:04,000
[SILVER] I mastered Ice Demon
Slayer Magic for one reason.

344
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,583
I knew that's what
it would take.

345
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:11,291
I wanted use it to kill
E.N.D. A fire demon.

346
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:19,166
[SILVER]
That is my legacy.

347
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,333
And I'm passing it on to you.

348
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:37,166
I'm an Ice Demon Slayer now.

349
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,041
I swear, I'll kill E.N.D.

350
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,208
[LUCY]
As the life or death battle

351
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:16,625
between wizards and
demons continues,

352
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:19,708
the Dragon Slayers Natsu and
Gajeel give everything they have

353
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,375
and more for a seemingly
hopeless endeavor

354
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:25,625
to strike fear into the
hearts of true demons.

355
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,166
But much like the hulking masses

356
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,041
in which their Etherious
forms manifest themselves,

357
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:33,541
a shadow of terror obscures
all light from above.

358
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:36,708
Next Time:
"Tartaros Chapter Air."

359
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:39,125
The depths of the
netherworld hold darkness,

360
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:41,750
a pitch-black terror
that never ends.
