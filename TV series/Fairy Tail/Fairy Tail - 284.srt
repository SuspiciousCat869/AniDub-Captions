1
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:30,000
It's, uh...

2
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:32,208
It's almost unthinkable.

3
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:37,291
Yes. These ideas... You wrote
this treatise yourself?

4
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:38,708
Yes.

5
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,541
[OLD TEACHER A]
I see.

6
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,416
The work is quite impressive,

7
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,625
but I cannot condone
the content.

8
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,375
It's not appropriate for a child

9
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,291
to discuss matters
such as these.

10
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:49,875
[OLD TEACHER C]
Your age notwithstanding,

11
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,416
magic pertaining
to life and death

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,625
is dangerous and
forbidden territory.

13
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:56,791
You must not delve
further into it.

14
00:00:56,875 --> 00:01:00,166
It would surely be looked
upon as an act of hubris.

15
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,333
[OLD TEACHER A]
Mh-hm.

16
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:02,958
Such thinking would
risk drawing the ire

17
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,625
of the god of life
and death, Ankhselam.

18
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:10,625
Thus, we will not allow you
to continue pursuing this magic.

19
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:13,916
[OLD TEACHER A]
Well, Zeref, is that clear?

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,416
Yes, sir.

21
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:29,041
All I want is to understand
why people live.

22
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:31,333
And why it is we die.

23
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,708
There has to be a reason.

24
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:43,541
A dream?

25
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,208
[ZEREF]
Must've been a dream.

26
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,250
[ZEREF] Can't remember
the last time I had one.

27
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,750
Natsu.

28
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:36,916
It's been ages since my
younger brother was with us.

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,166
At the time he was taken,
his life was just beginning.

30
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,958
I could never understand
why he had to die.

31
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:51,250
And so... that became
my life's mission.

32
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,500
There's still much
work to be done.

33
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:39,875
But if we find a way to amass

34
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:43,333
the 2.7 billion units
of magic power needed,

35
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,583
the Revive System
will become reality.

36
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:47,916
It's unbelievable.

37
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
[TEACHER D] The theoretical
magic is flawless.

38
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:53,125
The Revive System...
could bring back the dead?

39
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:57,041
In the academy's history, we've
never witnessed such a mind.

40
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,958
[OLD TEACHER A grumbles]

41
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:04,750
[OLD TEACHER A] How many times
must I repeat myself, Zeref?

42
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:08,041
The type of magic that you're
exploring is strictly forbidden.

43
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,291
Have you not
considered the toll?

44
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,500
The sheer number of lives
that must be sacrificed

45
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,375
for your design to work?

46
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,458
Life and death are both
bound by nature.

47
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:22,250
And they fall under the rules
of gods, not mere mortals.

48
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,875
[ZEREF]
Consider life.

49
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,541
There exists an element of
human choice in its creation,

50
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:27,958
does there not?

51
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,375
So, then, why should death
be fully exempt from that?

52
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,041
[OLD TEACHER A]
Uh!

53
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:37,250
Ankhselam! I beseech you to
have mercy on this boy's soul!

54
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,708
[grumbles]

55
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,250
[OLD TEACHER A]
Zeref.

56
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,541
Yes, sir?

57
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,458
Are you ignoring my commands?

58
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,583
I told you to stop working
on this Eclipse Project.

59
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,875
[ZEREF] But the design
is almost complete.

60
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:22,666
And I figured out how to
avoid the ethical dilemma.

61
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,375
A door that takes us
through time. Backwards.

62
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,875
But why return to the past?

63
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,333
Well, I...

64
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:33,791
It's all part of a recurring
focus of your work.

65
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,666
I can only assume
your ultimate goal

66
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,500
is to bring your late
brother back to life?

67
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,291
Despite our repeated
warnings over the years,

68
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,500
you remain obsessed with
the dangerous idea

69
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,750
of reviving the dead.

70
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:52,583
And because of this, the board
has decided to expel you.

71
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:53,916
[gasps]

72
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,166
[OLD TEACHER A]
This was not an easy decision.

73
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,250
We all had such high
hopes for you.

74
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,916
Not now! Please, sir!

75
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,916
Your brother is
never coming back!

76
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,166
And nothing you can
do will change that!

77
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,625
[gasps]

78
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,125
[OLD TEACHER A]
Huh?

79
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,041
What's happening?

80
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:29,250
Teacher... Help me.

81
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,708
[OLD TEACHER A]
Oh, no!

82
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,208
This must be the
wrath of Ankhselam!

83
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,583

[ZEREF]
Before I knew it,

87
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,250
the lives of every teacher
and student at the academy

88
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,166
had been snuffed out.

89
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,375
[gasps]

90
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,625
[ZEREF] I had indeed drawn
the wrath of Ankhselam.

91
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:23,250
This curse is one
of contradiction.

92
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:26,833
The deeper my
concern for life...

93
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,541
...the more I'm
surrounded by death.

94
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,333
[ZEREF]
Please forgive me.

95
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,291
[ZEREF]
The only way to suppress it

96
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,125
is to have no concern for life.

97
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,458
[ZEREF] This curse also
stopped my process of aging,

98
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,083
dooming me to live forever.

99
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,875
[ZEREF] After the school,
I was plagued by conflict.

100
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,041
Unfathomable guilt for
taking so many lives.

101
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,375
Yet, the fact that I could
continue my studies forever

102
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,000
pleased me greatly.

103
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:15,166
And in turn,
that joy disgusted me.

104
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,041
After wandering through that
existential labyrinth for years,

105
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,208
I came to a conclusion.

106
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,250
My death will bring
all this to an end.

107
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,541
[ZEREF] So I began to undertake
the most taboo magic of all.

108
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,833
That which creates life.

109
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:39,125
I brought into existence
demons that could kill me.

110
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,833
Known today as Demons
of the Books of Zeref.

111
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,125
Because they were made of ether,
the building blocks of magic,

112
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:49,166
I originally called
them "Etherious."

113
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,875
If only those demons
were powerful enough

114
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,791
to finish me off.

115
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,083
[ZEREF] Eventually,
I created my magnum opus

116
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,458
that could bring
all this to an end.

117
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:06,250
In fact, I called it E.N.D.

118
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,916
Etherious Natsu Dragneel.

119
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,791
[ZEREF] But this was not
some object or tool

120
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,458
to be used as a means to an end.

121
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:20,208
He was human from the
beginning, flesh and blood.

122
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:24,333
I had cared for my beloved
brother's body all those years.

123
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,458
Waiting for this day.

124
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,541
At last.

125
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:35,000
My brother's returned as
the ultimate Etherious.

126
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:41,291
[ZEREF] My deepest desires
have both been made flesh.

127
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:47,333
Nastu, do you remember me?

128
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:51,000
I am your older brother, Zeref.

129
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:01,416
[ZEREF]
Etherious Natsu Dragneel.

130
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,958
I'm sure you'd like to know how
you were paired with Igneel,

131
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,375
as well as my
connection to Mavis.

132
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,041
But those tales will
be told later.

133
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,875
At the moment, there's
a very important man

134
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,958
that I need to meet with.

135
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,208
[ZEREF]
Can I even call him a man?

136
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,375
[ZEREF] It's rather
surprising that you agreed

137
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,375
to have this discussion.

138
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:52,083
I can assume this is
how you normally look?

139
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,666
How's your arm healing up?

140
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,666
[ZEREF]
Well, Acnologia?

141

Black Wizard.
What is it you want?

142
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,750
[ZEREF]
You crave destruction.

143
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,250
Yet you hardly indulge yourself.

144
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,958
If you so desired,
you could use your power

145
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:12,291
to bring the entire
world to its knees.

146
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,833
But for some reason you haven't.

147
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,416
Whether it's a
matter of principle

148
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,958
or ambition is unclear.

149
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,708
[ACNOLOGIA]
The same could be said of you.

150
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,041
[ZEREF]
To be quite honest,

151
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:26,375
my indecision is what has
kept me out of the fray.

152
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,708
Should I side with humans
and do battle with you?

153
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:34,708
Or would the opposite
better suit my needs?

154
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,041
But I've come to the conclusion

155
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:39,500
that the question
itself is flawed.

156
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:43,583
After weighing my interests,
I am on neither side.

157
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,916
Both you and mankind
should be wiped out.

158
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,708
What do you think?

159
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:56,041
You have been waiting for a
serious challenge, correct?

160
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:59,041
I am the one who will
bring that to you.

161
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,416
The world will bear witness.

162
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,708
A human, a dragon,
and an immortal..

163
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,416
...will constitute
this final battle.

164
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,583
[chuckles]

165
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,916
[bell tolls]

166
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:24,333
[LUCY] In my opinion, Magnolia
is the jewel of eastern Fiore.

167
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,833
But it shone much brighter

168
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,833
when the Fairy Tail guild
hall was part of the skyline.

169
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,375
Strange to think
it's been a year

170
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,250
since we've walked
these streets.

171
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,125
Does this bring back
some memories or what?

172
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:40,416
Hey, look! They fixed up
Kardia Cathedral!

173
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,500
[LUCY] The members
we'd been able to find

174
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,500
were all in favor of getting
the guild back together.

175
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,333
It's so good to see
everything's back to normal.

176
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:51,416
The town's always
been resilient.

177
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,708
Yeah.

178
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,250
[LUCY]
After the fight with Avatar,

179
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,500
our group needed to
split up for a while,

180
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,583
but we agreed to reconvene
here in Magnolia.

181
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:01,791
[ERZA]
I won't be long,

182
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,541
but I need to report
back to Jellal first.

183
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,041
[GRAY]
Hey, Gajeel.

184
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,375
Could you not tell
the council about us?

185
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,708
Keep it hush-hush.

186
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,083
They wouldn't approve
of us shacking up!

187
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,166
[GRAY] Gimme a break!
I mean me and Erza's mission!

188
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,666
Shack up?

189
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,291
We need to report back as well,

190
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,416
but we'll meet you
there A.S.A.P.

191
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,333
Kinda thought workin' for the
Council was my true calling.

192
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,875
That is supposed to
be a joke, right?

193
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,708
[GAJEEL] I bet ol' wood
face'll be sad to see me go.

194
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,916
Now, that one's
definitely a joke!

195
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,666
I should arrest you for that!

196
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,708
No crime in being funny!

197
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,000
[BOTH chuckle]

198
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,833
[LUCY] It's a shame,
but I seriously doubt

199
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,875
we're gonna get any
information about Zeref

200
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,708
from those Avatar members.

201
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:49,125
They worshipped him, but they
didn't actually know him.

202
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,166
[WENDY]
Hm?

203
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,958
Is something wrong?
You look sad.

204
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,750
Aren't you glad to be back here?

205
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,833
Uh-huh, of course I am!

206
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:02,375
I just kinda got lost in my
memories for a second.

207
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,375
[LUCY]
Yeah.

208
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:12,916
So many memories were
made in this town.

209
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,500
Some are sad...
Some are happy...

210
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,541
Most of them still
make me smile.

211
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:23,666
I formed them with
my Fairy Tail family.

212
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,833
I was afraid after what
happened last year,

213
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:29,208
those memories would
be all we had left.

214
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,250
Master, are you outta your mind?

215
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,833
What's wrong with you?

216
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,458
[JET] I can't believe you
wouldn't talk to us first!

217
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,416
[DROY] How will we put
food on the table?

218
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,791
[FAIRY TAIL A]
Yeah, we need money!

219
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,291
[FAIRY TAIL B]
Tell us you're joking!

220
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,416
I am disbanding
the Fairy Tail guild.

221
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,000
Which means, from this point on,

222
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:49,000
you must forge your
own way forward.

223
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,750
That's final.

224
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,958
I just can't accept
this, Master!

225
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,791
You gotta realize that you're
messin' with our lives here!

226
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,166
[FAIRY TAIL C]
If you wanna quit so bad,

227
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,583
why don't you just
leave by yourself?

228
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,833
[FAIRY TAIL D]
Yeah!

229
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:05,000
A real man never quits!
Fairy Tail ain't goin' away!

230
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:09,708
[MAKAROV] I've made my decision,
and Fairy Tail is no more!

231
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,250
Hear me?

232
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:15,250
You are never to speak its name
again! Leave it in the past!

233
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,958
Tch.

234
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,666
[gasps]

235
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,666
[LUCY] Makarov was gone before
the shock could wear off.

236
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,500
We were all in a daze.

237
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:31,583
Eventually, everyone did have to
start forging their own paths,

238
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,125
as he'd said.

239
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:37,000
Just like that,
Fairy Tail was over.

240
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:41,416
We were left clutching
those memories we'd shared.

241
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Come on, Lucy,
we're just about there.

242
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,541
Yeah, we're practically
at the old guild hall.

243
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,791
I know.

244
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:52,666
But honestly, I'm kinda too
scared to get any closer.

245
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,666
[NATSU]
Why? 'Cause the building's gone?

246
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,583
That's the least important
part of the guild.

247
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,208
It's what's inside
us that counts.

248
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,958
We all feel the
same way about it.

249
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:08,083
But everyone else?

250
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:11,000
I mean, it was exciting when
you showed up out of nowhere

251
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,875
and talked about
reviving the guild.

252
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,791
So I let myself
get fired up too.

253
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,958
And right away, I sent
out messages to everybody

254
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:23,916
that had been in the guild.

255
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,208
At least, those I could find.

256
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:29,791
No word from me
for an entire year...

257
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,750
Then suddenly, I ask them
to drop everything,

258
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:36,916
come to Magnolia,
and rebuild Fairy Tail.

259
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,041
Maybe they've done
exactly what master said

260
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,333
and started making their
own way through life.

261
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,541
Maybe they've moved on.

262
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,791
Are we the only ones
who feel this way?

263
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,000
What if they have
put it in the past?

264
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,916
What if they've forgotten
about it altogether?

265
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,041
I...

266
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,666
I know my memory's
not that great,

267
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,625
but it's only been a year.

268
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:02,708
[NATSU]
Cana?

269
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,666
[WENDY]
You're here!

270
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,708
[CANA]
Hm?

271
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,291
What's up?

272
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,791
It's so good to see
you guys again!

273
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:12,250
Wendy, I think you've grown
a bit since last time!

274
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,916
[WENDY]
No. Not really.

275
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,791
And you're just as
bouncy as always, Lucy!

276
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,416
Cana.

277
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,416
[CANA] Not gonna lie,
with all that happened,

278
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,083
this has been an
eye-opening year for me.

279
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,500
I decided I'd try to
track down my old man,

280
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,708
so I was gonna take a trip.

281
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:32,750
Can hardly believe I got your
letter. What a lucky break!

282
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,041
I imagine everyone
else feels the same.

283
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,458
[LUCY gasps]

284
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,791
The guild's family.

285
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,708
I've been a member ever
since I was a little kid.

286
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,291
So when Makarov decided to
break it up all of a sudden,

287
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,958
I was pretty lost.

288
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,125
I had no idea how I was
gonna make a living

289
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,916
or who I could turn to.

290
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,958
In a weird way, it helped put
things into perspective.

291
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,833
[CANA] The whole situation was
such a shock to all of us.

292
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:06,208
It seemed like nobody had
the stones to reach out.

293
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:11,041
Or I should say, nobody
but you, Lucy. Good call.

294
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,666
[gasps]

295
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,541
[NATSU chuckles]

296
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,583
[CANA]
So come on!

297
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,708
Everyone's waiting!

298
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,666
Yeah?

299
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,791
[gasps]

300
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:42,583
Lookin' good, Lucy! You are
rockin' that long hair!

301
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,833
[DROY, JET] It's so
awesome to see you guys!

302
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,541
When I got your letter,
it made me really happy!

303
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:48,750
Oui.

304
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,208
Heard Natsu caused a
scene at the capital!

305
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,583
Hey, Wendy. We missed you
and Carla around here!

306
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,458
[WAKABA] Lookin' like a
scrapper there, Happy!

307
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,708
Certainly took you long enough.

308
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:05,666
Back in Magnolia.
It feels good.

309
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,125
[LUCY]
Warren.

310
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,333
You like the portable
communication lacrima I built?

311
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,708
[LUCY]
Nab.

312
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:18,291
He read your Sorcerer Weekly
articles! And so did I!

313
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,375
[LUCY]
Reedus. Max.

314
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,250
Oui, oui.

315
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,000
Here in the flesh!

316
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,833
[LUCY]
Alzack, Bisca, and lil' Asca!

317
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:29,125
[ERZA] Still such a beautiful
and happy family.

318
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,875
[LUCY]
Jet! Droy!

319
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,541
[BOTH] Team Shadow Gear
is together again!

320
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,375
I had to leave the council
for that to happen!

321
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,833
[ALL] You were working
for the Magic Council?!

322
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,458
[LUCY]
Macao, Wakaba, and Romeo!

323
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:44,541
Gonna have to lock you
guys up for bein' chumps.

324
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:45,583
[LUCY]
Laki!

325
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,875
Diggin' the new hairstyle.

326
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,125
[LUCY]
Vijeeter!

327
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,375
I'm guessing that's some
kind of reunion dance?

328
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,583
[LUCY]
Kinana!

329
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,666
She actually
learned some magic!

330
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,500
[ELFMAN] I wasn't gonna
miss this for the world!

331
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,708
[gasps]

332
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,875
[LUCY]
Lisanna! Elfman!

333
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,875
A reunion fit for a real man!

334
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,416
[MIRAJANE]
Lucy.

335
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:14,416
Mira, it's you.

336
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,791
[giggles]

337
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,000
Welcome back home.

338
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,708
I am home.

339
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,833
[LUCY] It felt so natural
for us to be together again,

340
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,166
like a real family.

341
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,916
I was so happy, but
the tears wouldn't stop.

342
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,458
I missed you all.

343
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,041
[LUCY]
Mira!

344
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,583
Guess what I found!

345
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,208
A little ragged, but who cares?

346
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,541
[NATSU]
Our guild is back in action!

347
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,291
Fairy Tail still rules!

348
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,833
[LUCY] The Fairy Tail reunion
kicks off in Magnolia.

349
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:42,625
But so does the hard work
we'll need to put in

350
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:45,333
to build the guild up
to our former glory!

351
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:47,625
Although, we're all worried that
no one has heard from master

352
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,208
since that fateful day.

353
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:50,541
The first order of business

354
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:53,166
is to rebuild our
wrecked guild hall.

355
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,208
Then one day, as we start
to get back on our feet,

356
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:57,916
a man bearing the
Fairy Tail emblem

357
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,166
shows up with a message for us.

358
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,833
Next Time: "The Seventh
Guild Master."

359
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:05,916
The secret door will
soon be opened.
