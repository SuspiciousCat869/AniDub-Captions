1
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:19,750
- Pantherlily: PREVIOUSLY
ON "FAIRY TAIL..."

2
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,125
- Mest: I MUST KNOW!

3
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,000
TELL ME OF THE MAGIC
OF PLOT SYNOPSES.

4
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:24,958
- Pantherlily: SUSPICIOUS.
- Carla: LILY AND I

5
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,125
HAD A SINKING
FEELING ABOUT MEST.

6
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:27,916
SO WE HEADED TO
TENROU ISLAND.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,708
WE HOPED TO
CATCH HIM OFF GUARD

8
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:32,125
SINCE THE S-CLASS TRIAL
WAS ALREADY UNDERWAY.

9
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,500
- Pantherlily:
VERY SUSPICIOUS.

10
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,000
- Carla: NOW THAT WE'RE HERE,
IT SEEMS

11
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,041
AN EVEN BIGGER CRISIS 
LOOMS OVER THE ISLAND.

12
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,416
- Mest: PLEASE TELL ME!

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,416
WHAT IS IT LIKE
TO BE IN CRISIS?!

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,833
- Pantherlily: SERIOUSLY!
YOU'RE WAY TOO SUSPICIOUS.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,291
- ( theme music playing )

16
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:01,833
- ( singing in Japanese )

17
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,125
- Erza: UNBELIEVABLE.

18
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,750
I NEVER IMAGINED THAT ZEREF
WOULD STILL BE ALIVE.

19
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:23,083
- AS MUCH AS THAT
TERRIFIES ME,

20
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,750
I'M MORE CONCERNED
THAT GRIMOIRE HEART'S

21
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,583
FIGHTING FORCE
IS ON THEIR WAY.

22
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:30,166
- I BELIEVE THEY'RE CALLED 
THE SEVEN KIN OF PURGATORY,

23
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,458
RIGHT?
- YES.

24
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:32,791
AND APPARENTLY ONE OF THEM

25
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,500
IS ALREADY LURKING
AROUND THE ISLAND.

26
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,500
- COME ON, JUVIA,
LET'S HURRY.

27
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,041
WE NEED TO FIND
WENDY AND MEST 

28
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,375
AND REGROUP AT THE CAMP
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

29
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:57,125
- STOP IT.  WHAT'S
GOTTEN INTO THE TWO OF YOU?

30
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,625
- STAY BACK AND
KEEP QUIET, CHILD!

31
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,583
- TELL ME WHO YOU
REALLY ARE.

32
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:04,125
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

33
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:08,041
- IT'S MY BELIEF
THE MAGIC YOU WIELD

34
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,250
ALLOWS YOU TO MANIPULATE
PEOPLE'S MEMORIES.

35
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,250
IF I'M CORRECT,

36
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,208
YOU'VE BEEN USING
THAT MAGIC TO MASQUERADE

37
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,375
AS A MEMBER OF FAIRY TAIL
SINCE BEFORE THE TRIAL.

38
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,458
TOO MANY THINGS
DON'T ADD UP

39
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,000
INCLUDING YOUR STORY
ABOUT BEING MYSTOGAN'S PUPIL.

40
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,458
FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN,

41
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,416
NO ONE HAS ANY
REAL CONNECTION WITH YOU.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,208
AND JUST NOW
YOU HAD NO IDEA

43
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,708
WHAT THE GUILD'S
EMERGENCY FLARE SIGNIFIED.

44
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,750
THERE'S NO TALKING
YOUR WAY OUT OF THAT.

45
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:43,458
( gasps )

46
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,833
- HE DISAPPEARED!

47
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:47,625
- NO! TELEPORTATION MAGIC?

48
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,250
WENDY!

49
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,000
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

50
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,583
( screams )
- WENDY, NO!

51
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,666
- ( Happy speaking )

52
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,708
- Mest: GET DOWN NOW!
- ( screams )

53
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,000
- AN ATTACK?

54
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,041
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

55
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,166
- HE PROTECTED HER?

56
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,291
BUT WHY?

57
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,208
- WHO ARE YOU?!
SHOW YOURSELF!

58
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,041
- IMPRESSIVE.
YOUR SENSES ARE QUITE SHARP.

59
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:57,250
- THE TREE ATTACKED US?
- OUT! COME AND FACE US!

60
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:00,083
- I'M FROM GRIMOIRE HEART.

61
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,041
NAME'S AZUMA.

62
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,583
I'M ONE OF
THE SEVEN KIN OF PURGATORY.

63
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,083
- GRIMOIRE HEART?
- A DARK GUILD.

64
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,041
- SO THAT'S WHAT
THE FLARE WAS.

65
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,041
SOMEONE MUST HAVE RUN INTO
MORE OF THESE FREAKS.

66
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:16,291
- ( chuckles ) A BIT LATE TO BE
WORRYING ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS.

67
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,416
- HOW DARE YOU!

68
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,833
WHAT EXACTLY
IS GOING ON HERE?!

69
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,791
- I THOUGHT IF I WAS GOING
TO FIND ANY DIRT

70
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,250
ON THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD,

71
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,833
THE MOST LOGICAL PLACE 
TO START WOULD BE HERE,

72
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:31,125
ITS SACRED BURIAL GROUND.
- ( growls )

73
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:34,583
- BUT TO FIND ZEREF
AND GRIMOIRE HEART AS WELL,

74
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,083
TALK ABOUT
HITTING THE JACKPOT.

75
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,666
MUST BE MY LUCKY DAY.

76
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,500
- ZEREF?
- JUST WHO ARE YOU?

77
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,041
- COME ON,
ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

78
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,166
I WORK FOR
THE MAGIC COUNCIL.

79
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,458
I INFILTRATED YOUR RANKS
TO GATHER INTEL

80
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,625
THAT'LL BRING YOU DOWN
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

81
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,541
- YOU'RE A SPY?!
- BUT, MEST...

82
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,750
- VERY INTERESTING.

83
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,708
- BUT I'VE CAUGHT
A MUCH BIGGER FISH NOW.

84
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,083
TO THINK THE EVER ILLUSIVE
GRIMOIRE HEART

85
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,416
WOULD JUST FALL INTO MY LAP
OUT OF NOWHERE.

86
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,041
( chuckles )

87
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,458
IF I TAKE THEM OUT,
MY CAREER IS AS GOOD AS MADE.

88
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,291
I EVEN HAVE THE COUNCIL'S

89
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:14,291
CUSTODY ENFORCEMENT UNIT'S
BATTLESHIPS ON STANDBY.

90
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,541
ONCE THE DARK GUILD
MAKES LANDFALL,

91
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,000
IT'LL BE GAME OVER
FOR THEM.

92
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,083
THIS IS A CRACKDOWN!

93
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:24,083
TODAY, THE DEVIL'S HEART
STOPS BEATING FOR GOOD. 

94
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,875
- THOSE BATTLESHIPS,

95
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,958
THEY LOOK SO FRAGILE
FROM HERE.

96
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,250
- NO.  ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE...

97
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,958
- THE SHIPS!
- BUT HOW?

98
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,000
- IF YOU'RE DONE TALKING,

99
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:48,541
I'D LIKE TO GET TO WORK
DESTROYING EVERYONE HERE,

100
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,250
RIGHT NOW.

101
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,666
- EVERYONE STAND BACK.

102
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:02,791
- Makarov: A RED FLARE,
THE SIGNAL OF AN ENEMY RAID.

103
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,000
I NEVER THOUGHT
IT WOULD HAPPEN HERE

104
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,458
AND ON MY WATCH NO LESS.

105
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,083
MAVIS,
DID YOU EVER

106
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,333
FIND YOURSELF
IN THIS SITUATION?

107
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,583
BECAUSE I WONDER
HOW YOU WOULD HAVE HANDLED IT.

108
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,583
I'LL BET YOU'RE 
SO ANGRY WITH ME

109
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,750
YOU'RE SPINNING
IN YOUR GRAVE RIGHT NOW.

110
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:24,541
I'VE ALLOWED THE ENEMY TO TREAD
UPON OUR GUILD'S SACRED GROUND.

111
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:27,583
I ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY.

112
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,666
AND I WILL PAY THE PRICE
REST ASSURED OF THAT.

113
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,916
HOWEVER...

114
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,041
I ASK THIS OF YOU.

115
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,916
KEEP THEM SAFE.

116
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,333
- IS IT JUST ME
OR DID THAT SOUND

117
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,208
LIKE SOME TROUBLE WENT DOWN
OVER THERE?

118
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,583
- YEAH.  DO YOU THINK
THE ENEMY'S ALREADY HERE?

119
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,666
- ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.
- AYE.

120
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,833
- NO, HOW COULD
YOU DO THAT?

121
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,000
- THOSE SHIPS WERE FULL
OF INNOCENT PEOPLE!

122
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,333
- HOW COULD ONE MAN
HAVE SUCH POWER?

123
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,625
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

124
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,625
- ( growls )

125
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:18,666
- LILY!

126
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,208
- BLEVE.

127
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,333
- OOH.

128
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,000
( screams )

129
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,500
- ( both screaming )

130
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,666
- IF ONLY I HAD A SWORD.

131
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,000
- DON'T WORRY.

132
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,833
YOU'RE NOT IN THIS ALONE.

133
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,333
OH, SWIFT WINDS

134
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,000
THAT SPEED THROUGH
THE HEAVENS...

135
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:54,791
- WHOA.

136
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,541
- VERNIER!

137
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,041
- MY BODY SUDDENLY
FEELS LIGHTER.

138
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,833
- I CALL UPON THEE,

139
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,875
THE STALWART MIGHT
TO CLEAVE THE HEAVENS!

140
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,416
- AMAZING.

141
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,583
SO THIS IS THE POWER
SUPPORT MAGIC HOLDS.

142
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,541
- ARMS!

143
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:10,958
- IN THIS STATE...

144
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,750
DODGING THESE
EXPLOSION SPELLS

145
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,791
IS CHILD'S PLAY.

146
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,666
- LISTEN UP, MEST.

147
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,666
I THINK I KNOW HOW
TO TAKE THIS GUY DOWN,

148
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,291
BUT I'LL NEED
YOUR HELP TO DO IT.

149
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,666
- NO, WEREN'T YOU
LISTENING BEFORE?

150
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,583
- I'M NOT YOUR ALLY. 
I'M WITH THE COUNCIL.

151
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,708
- DO YOU THINK WHO YOU
WORK FOR MATTERS TO ME?

152
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,791
ALL I CARE ABOUT
IS PROTECTING FAIRY TAIL.

153
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,666
PLEASE HELP ME DO THAT.

154
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,500
- I ONLY CAME TO THIS ISLAND 
SO I COULD DESTROY FAIRY TAIL

155
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,500
AND FURTHER MY CAREER.

156
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,166
- AND YOU'LL FAIL.

157
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,250
THERE'S NO ONE IN EXISTENCE
WHO COULD TAKE US DOWN.

158
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,291
- ( gasps )

159
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,875
- LILY, GO UP!

160
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,333
- IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHERE YOU RUN.

161
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,208
MY EXPLOSIONS
ALWAYS HIT THEIR MARK.

162
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,500
- DIRECT LINE.

163
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,250
- I'VE GOT
ONE SHOT AT THIS.

164
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,541
- ELIMINATING THIS GUY 
TAKES PRIORITY FOR NOW.

165
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,166
- GOTCHA.

166
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,375
- SKY DRAGON ROAR.

167
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,000
- YOU PATHETIC FOOLS.

168
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,166
- ( gasping )

169
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,791
- GO, TOWER BURST!

170
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,833

171
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,500
- ( screaming )

172
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,791
- ( Natsu pants )

173
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:36,875
WHAT IS THAT?

174
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,666
- IT'S A TOWER OF FIRE.

175
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,083
THERE'S NO ONE IN FAIRY TAIL
WHO USES MAGIC LIKE THAT.

176
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,625
- GUESS WE KNOW
WHERE THE ENEMY IS THEN.

177
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,333
- ( ragged breathing )

178
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,041
- TIME'S UP.

179
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,541
- I NEVER IMAGINED...

180
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,458
THE SEVEN KIN OF PURGATORY

181
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,875
WOULD POSSESS SUCH POWER.

182
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,458
- THIS GUILD,

183
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:21,333
ARE CATS AND CHILDREN
ITS ONLY DEFENSE?

184
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:24,916
- THERE ARE SIX MORE
OF THESE GUYS?

185
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,708
WE'RE ALL DOOMED.

186
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,916
FAIRY TAIL DOESN'T
STAND A CHANCE.

187
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,333
- ( Lucy pants )

188
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:42,916
COME ON, WHERE THE HECK IS
THIS STUPID MEETING PLACE?

189
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,875
- Gray: IT'S BACK
AT THE BASE CAMP.

190
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,291
DIDN'T ANYBODY TELL YOU?
- Loke: WE'LL GET THERE QUICKER

191
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,750
IF WE PASS THROUGH
THESE RUINS.

192
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,208
JUST KEEP RUNNING.
- ( Lucy pants )

193
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,416
HOW DID A SEARCH
FOR A GRAVE

194
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,750
TURN INTO AN ORDEAL
LIKE THIS?

195
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,416
- I DON'T GET IT.

196
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,625
CAN YOU THINK OF ANY REASON
THEY'D ATTACK NOW?

197
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,333
- NO.

198
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,291
- DON'T GIVE UP ON ME, OKAY?

199
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,041
WE HAVE TO FIND THE OTHERS

200
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,333
BEFORE THE ISLAND'S OVERRUN.

201
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:12,041
WE'RE AT
A MAJOR DISADVANTAGE.

202
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,291
THEY ATTACKED
WHILE WE'RE SPLIT UP.

203
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,916
I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT
WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN.

204
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,583
- NICE OUTFIT.
GETS ME FIRED UP

205
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:40,875
AND READY TO CUT LOOSE.

206
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,416
- ZANCROW,

207
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,666
YOU SHOULD BE TAKING
THIS BATTLE SERIOUSLY.

208
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,291
- TONIGHT
THE SOULS OF OUR FOES

209
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,708
DINE IN THE CITY OF WOE.

210
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,875
- POETRY AND STUFF.

211
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,833
I'M ALSO READY TO FIGHT
AND, UH--

212
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,083
FILLED WITH...
- UR, LOOK.

213
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:59,791
- NEVER REFER TO ME
BY THAT NAME.

214
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,375
- PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

215
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:05,708
- AWW, COME ON, DON'T BE
SO NERVOUS ALL THE TIME.

216
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,750
ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT'S UP?

217
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,708
- IT'S IN VIEW NOW.

218
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,250
THE FAIRY ISLAND.

219
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,250
- ( gasps )

220
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,625
- WHAT IN THE HELL
IS THAT?

221
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,666
- ( groaning )

222
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,708
- Ultear: A GIANT.
- OH, WOW.

223
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,708
- THAT SUCKS. 
- WHO IS THAT?

224
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:51,958
- MAKAROV.

225
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,458
- BE GONE.

226
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:03,083
- Narrator: LET'S GO BACK
TO THE YEAR 736,

227

48 YEARS BEFORE 
THE PRESENT DAY.

228
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,875
- WAIT.
EITHER I'M GOING SENILE

229
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,375
OR YOU JUST SAID
I'M FAIRY TAIL'S NEXT MASTER.

230
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,583
- THAT'S CORRECT.

231
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,000
- FIND SOMEONE ELSE.
I CAN'T.

232
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,666
- YOU CAN
AND YOU WILL, BOY.

233
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,458
- WHO YOU CALLING BOY?
I'M 40 YEARS OLD, YOU KNOW?

234
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:25,625
- I REALIZE YOU HAVE 
DOUBTS AT THE MOMENT.

235
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,166
BUT YOU HAVE THE ABILITY

236
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,208
TO LOVE AND TRUST
YOUR FELLOW MAN. 

237

JUST AS MAVIS,

239
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,750
OUR FIRST MASTER,

PASSED THIS HEAVY MANTLE
ONTO MY SHOULDERS,

00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:44,750
I NOW PASS FAIRY TAIL'S
SPIRIT ONTO YOU.

242
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,708
PLEASE HANDLE IT
WITH CARE.

243
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,708

266
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,291
- AS YOU WISH.

BUT THERE IS NO ESCAPE!

268
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,166
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU

00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,916
TO GET OUT OF MY SIGHT.

270
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,791
OTHERWISE,
YOU AND YOUR COMRADES

00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,375
WAS IT YOU?!

287
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,375
HEY, ANSWER ME.

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,958
( growls )

289
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,500
- THE MEMORY MANIPULATION
SPELL'S WORN OFF.

290
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,708
- Narrator:
ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN.

291
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,333
A USER OF MEMORY
MANIPULATION MAGIC

HAS THE ABILITY TO ADD
HIS OR HER PRESENCE

INTO THE MEMORY OF OTHERS.

HOWEVER, JUST LIKE
WITH CHARM MAGIC, 

295

MEMORY MANIPULATION
IS BROKEN

296
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,375
THE MOMENT THOSE AFFECTED

297
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,666
BECOME AWARE
IT'S BEEN USED ON THEM.

298
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,000
- DON'T.  MEST IS A MEMBER
OF THE MAGIC COUNCIL, NATSU.

299
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,083

LET ME FIX IT FOR YOU.
( gasps )

302
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,791

- ( whimpers )

304
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,000
- YOU'RE WRONG.

305
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,041
THE ENEMY IS GRIMOIRE HEART,

306
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:27,291
A DARK GUILD.
- FROM THE BARAM ALLIANCE?!

307
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,791
- YOU MEAN THEY'RE
ON THE ISLAND?!

308
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,000
HOW'RE WE SUPPOSED
TO FEND OFF

309
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,250
THEIR ENTIRE GUILD
ON OUR OWN?

310
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,000
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?!

311
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,750
- Natsu: WHY ARE
YOU ASKING ME?! 

312
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,583
- WHAT'S THAT UP THERE?

313
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,708
- ( Lucy screams )

314
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,166
- IT'S RAINING MASKED MEN.

315
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,958
- I'D SAY HALLELUJAH,
BUT THEY DON'T LOOK FRIENDLY.

316
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,166
- CRAP.
- THAT'S CRAZY.

317
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,458
THERE'S TONS OF THEM.

318
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,583
ALL THOSE ORBS
ARE ENEMY SOLDIERS.

319
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,833
- ( soldiers shouting )

320
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,458
- ( soldiers chattering )

321
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,375
- ( boots clinking )
- ( soldiers chattering )

322
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:38,083
- UH-OH.
WE'RE TOO LATE.

323
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,125
- ( indistinct shouting )

324
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,666
- I'LL TAKE ALL OF YOU ON!

325
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,750
WHO'S GONNA ARM WRESTLE
ME FIRST?

326
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,375
- DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S MORE ANNOYING.

327
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,541
YOU OR THE GOON SQUAD.

328
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,416
- HOW DID THEY OVERRUN US
SO QUICKLY?

329
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,458
- I'M NOT SURE AND I'M AFRAID
MORE ARE COMING.

330
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,833
- ( growls )

331
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,875
- WELL, WELL.

332
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:27,500
THE ROWDY ONES WILL FINALLY
BE JOINING ME IN BATTLE.

333
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,125
- ( cackles )

334
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,041
YAHOO!

335
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,583
- THE UNDERWORLD
WILL RUN RED

336
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,250
WITH OUR SACRIFICES TONIGHT.

337
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,416
- OPERATION IS UNDERWAY.

338
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,916
- ( groaning )

339
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,500
- AT LAST, I AM NEAR HIM.

340
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:53,791
LORD ZEREF.

341
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,750
- SO MUCH CONFLICT.

342
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,833
WILL IT EVER END?

343
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:15,250
- AND THAT'S THREE.
TIME'S UP.

344
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,875
FAIRY LAW.

345
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,833
- DON'T BE SO HASTY.

346
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,875
- OH.

347
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:37,208
- GRIMOIRE LAW.

348
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,666
- ( gasps )

349
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:42,041
- THESE SPELLS SERVE
THEIR INTENDED PURPOSE.

350
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,916
LESSER MEN WOULD
BE DETERRED BY THEM.

351
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,250
BUT UNLESS ONE OF US
BACKS DOWN FROM THIS DUEL,

352
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,125
THE DESTRUCTION THAT FOLLOWS

353
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,541
WILL LEAVE
A SCAR ON THIS WORLD

354
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,166
OF CATACLYSMIC PROPORTIONS.

355
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,583
- UH! IMPOSSIBLE!

356
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,208
NO, IT CAN'T BE!

357
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,333
- I'M GOING ON A JOURNEY, BOY.

358
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:07,125
I KNOW YOU'LL MAKE
THIS GUILD A GREAT ONE.

359
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,750
- MASTER, WAIT.
DON'T GO.

360
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,500
- MASTER?

361
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,208
I'M NO LONGER
THE GUILD'S MASTER.

362
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,958
( echoes )
IT'S YOU. 

363
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:22,250
HELLO, BOY.

364
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,041
YOU'RE LOOKING WELL.

365
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,083
- IT IS YOU.

366
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,666
MASTER PRECHT!

367
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:35,375
- ( theme music playing )

368
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:46,416
- ( singing in Japanese )

369
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:15,125
- Happy: NATSU, HAVE YOU HEARD
OF LOST MAGIC BEFORE?

370
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:17,500
- ROAST MAGIC? WHAT? YOU MEAN
LIKE A CHICKEN OR SOMETHING? 

371
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,791
- NOT ROAST, LOST.
IT'S ANCIENT MAGIC

372
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,458
THAT'S BEEN LOST AND
COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN

373
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,458
BY WIZARDS LIKE US,
YOU DOOFUS.

374
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:25,250
SERIOUSLY, HOW'D YOU GET
CHICKEN FROM THAT?

375
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:27,041
- WELL, HOW CAN YOU
JUST LOSE MAGIC?

376
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:28,958
THAT'S PRETTY IRRESPONSIBLE.
- ( frustrated groan )

377
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:30,291
I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO LOST IT.

378
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:33,416
- ( Natsu and Happy speaking )

379
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,625
UGH, MAN, NOW I'M BEAT.

380
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,208
- WHY ARE YOU TIRED?
ALL YOU'VE DONE

381
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:39,208
IS SIT HERE AND TALK WITH ME.
- EXACTLY.

382
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:41,583
THAT'S ENOUGH TO
MAKE ANYONE EXHAUSTED.
