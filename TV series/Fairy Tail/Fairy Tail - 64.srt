1
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,708
- Erza: PREVIOUSLY,
ON "FAIRY TAIL"...

2
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:21,250
- Happy: BRAIN WENT DOWN,

3
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,583
WHICH MEANS THERE'S ONLY
ONE ORACION SEIS MEMBER LEFT.

4
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,541
- Midnight:
YOU MUST BE DREAMING.

5
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,250
- Happy: A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
ON OUR TEAM FELL INTO A TRAP,

6
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,750
BUT THE BIG BALD GUY
SAVED US!

7
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,458
- YOU ARE DREAMING.

8
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,083
- Erza: I'VE SEEN THE LIGHT
INSIDE YOU

9
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,208
AND IT'S BRIGHTER
THAN EVER BEFORE.

10
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,000
- KEEP ON DREAMING.

11
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:40,666
- ( theme music playing )

12
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:57,875
- ( singing in Japanese )

13
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:13,875
- WOW, I'M SURPRISED
YOU CAN STAND.

14
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:18,416
I GET MY REAL FIGHT,
AFTER ALL.  WONDERFUL.

15
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,625
DESTROYING YOU
WILL BE A TREAT.

16
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,666
- I SWEAR ON THIS SACRED BLADE
I WIELD,

17
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,583
I WILL END THIS CHAOS

18
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:29,875
AND YOUR LIFE TOO.

19
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,958
- NIRVANA WILL NOT BE STOPPED.

20
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,625
OUR TARGET IS GETTING CLOSER--

21
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:37,041
CAIT SHELTER.

22
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,500
- COME ON, ERZA.

23
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:46,625
OR SHOULD I CALL YOU TITANIA?

24
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:51,250
I WANNA SEE YOUR STRENGTH
WITH MY OWN TWO EYES.

25
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,958
BUT I WON'T FEEL IT.

26
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,000
'CAUSE IF YOU THINK
YOU CAN LAND A SINGLE HIT ON ME,

27
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,125
YOU MUST BE DREAMING.

28
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:01,750
- YOU DON'T STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST HIS REFLECTOR MAGIC.

29
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,375
YOU SAW WHAT IT'S CAPABLE OF.

30
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:08,541
HE CAN TURN YOUR OWN ATTACK
AGAINST YOU IN AN INSTANT.

31
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:19,125
- Happy: "ZERO"!

32
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,208
- SHE MOVES SO FAST.

33
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,916
- YOU COULD BE THE FASTEST
PERSON WHO'S EVER LIVED,

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
BUT YOU'D STILL NEVER
BREAK THROUGH MY REFLECTOR.

35
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,416
IT'S USELESS.

36
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,625
NO!  YOU HIT ME.

37
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,125
- THERE ARE TWO--

38
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:54,500
TWO CRUCIAL WEAKNESSES

39
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,000
IN YOUR DEFENSE MAGIC.

40
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,041
- THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

41
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:04,041
HOW DID SHE FIND THEM
IN SUCH A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME?

42
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,875
- ALTHOUGH IT'S TRUE
YOU POSSESS THE POWER

43
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,833
TO BEND WEAPONS
AND EVEN MAGIC ATTACKS,

44
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,041
YOU CANNOT USE THAT ABILITY
TO MANIPULATE THE HUMAN BODY.

45
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,875
IF YOU COULD,

46
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,916
THEN SURELY
YOU WOULD ATTACK MY BODY

47
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,541
RATHER THAN SIMPLY TWISTING
MY ARMOR.

48
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,375
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

49
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,166
- HA! MAYBE.

50
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,791
BUT WHY WOULD IT MATTER?

51
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,041
I CAN USE ALL
THOSE LOVELY CLOTHES YOU WEAR

52
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,166
TO SQUEEZE YOU
UNTIL YOU POP,

53
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,416
AS FAST OR SLOWLY AS I WANT.

54
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,625
- SO THAT'S ONE WEAKNESS.
ONE MORE.

55
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,291
- ERZA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

56
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,375
NO MATTER HOW MANY SWORDS
YOU THROW,

57
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,875
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO HIT HIM.

58
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,500
- AAH!

59
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,583
- WHILE YOU TWISTED
MY ARMOR EARLIER,

60
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,166
YOU DODGED MY SWORD.

61
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,708
WHY DIDN'T YOU BEND
ITS TRAJECTORY INSTEAD?

62
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:27,833
IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE ONLY ABLE
TO CONTROL ONE SPACE AT A TIME--

63
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,333
EITHER THE SPACE
SURROUNDING YOUR ENEMY,

64
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:33,250
OR YOURSELF,
BUT NOT BOTH AT ONCE.

65
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,000
SO WHILE YOUR BENDING SPELL
IS ACTIVE ON ME,

66
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,958
YOU'RE PRACTICALLY
DEFENSELESS,

67
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,916
COMPLETELY UNABLE
TO DEPLOY YOUR REFLECTOR MAGIC

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,250
TO REPEL AN ATTACK
THAT'S COMING RIGHT FOR YOU.

69
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:48,125
- SHE'S FIGURED ALL THAT OUT?

70
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:54,375
- WHAT'S MORE,
THIS IS MY INFINITY ROBE ARMOR,

71
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,750
BY FAR THE MOST ELASTIC
IN MY COLLECTION,

72
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,583
AND IMMUNE TO YOUR SPELL.

73
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,083
HUH.

74
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:07,833
I SUPPOSE YOU COULD CONSIDER
THIS ARMOR A THIRD WEAKNESS.

75
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:11,708
- NO!
IT'S TOO LATE!

76
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,333
- YES,
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

77
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,375
THIS BATTLE HAS REACHED
ITS END.

78
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:22,333
- ( laughs )

79
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,583
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

80
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,166
TOO LATE FOR YOU.

81
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,875
YOU SHOULD HAVE LET ME
BEAT YOU BEFORE MIDNIGHT,

82
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,541
BEFORE YOU SAW
THE TRUE FACE OF TERROR.

83
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:35,041
YOU MISSED YOUR ONLY CHANCE
TO REST IN PEACE.

84
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,208
- ( bell tolling )

85
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,333
- WHAT IS THAT?

86
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,875
- SOUNDS LIKE A BELL.

87
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,916
- TOLLING THE MIDNIGHT HOUR.

88
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,500
- THAT'S RIGHT.

89
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,458
WHEN THE CLOCK
STRIKES MIDNIGHT,

90
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,375
MY POWERS
REACH THEIR TERRIFYING PEAK!

91
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,541
( laughs )

92
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,708
- WHAT IS HE?

93
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:14,208
- YOU COULD HAVE PREVENTED
THIS FROM HAPPENING.

94
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,791
- AAH!

95
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:26,791
( screaming )

96
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,541
- WHAT KIND OF MAGIC IS THIS?

97
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,291
IT'S NOT A TAKEOVER.
IT'S SOMETHING ELSE--

98
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,791
SOMETHING
I'VE NEVER FELT BEFORE.

99
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,208
- JELLAL.

100
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,083
- ( Jellal screaming )

101
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:49,208
- YOUR REIGN
WAS BASED ON A LIE.

102
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:52,583
THERE WAS NO FREEDOM
IN THE TOWER OF HEAVEN.

103
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,958
EVEN AFTER THE UPRISING,

104
00:07:57,041 --> 00:08:00,250
I WAS STILL TOO AFRAID
TO SLEEP AT NIGHT.

105
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:03,750
- WHAT?
YOU WERE THERE?!

106
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,333
ALL OF YOU WERE THERE,
IN THE TOWER?

107
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:10,500
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
WHAT COBRA MEANT.

108
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,375
- DON'T BE SO SMUG, TITANIA!

109
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,333
YOU'RE JUST AS GUILTY
AS HE IS!

110
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,916
WHILE EVERYONE SUFFERED,
YOU TURNED YOUR BACK,

111
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,541
FOR ALL THOSE YEARS.

112
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,625
AND NOW YOU'VE REUNITED
WITH JELLAL,

113
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,625
THE ONE WHO CAUSED
YOUR FRIENDS SO MUCH PAIN.

114
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,666
YOU'RE JUST LIKE HIM.

115
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,666
IN FACT,
YOU'RE EVEN MORE AT FAULT

116
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,458
BECAUSE YOU COULD'VE
STOPPED IT AND YOU DIDN'T.

117
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,041
JUST ASK THEM!

118
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,125
- Erza: GRANDPA ROB.

119
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,708
SIMON!

120
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,458
- ( laughing )

121
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,833
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THINGS
THROUGH THEIR EYES,

122
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,458
WHO IS THE REAL MONSTER HERE?

123
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,791
- SHUT UP!

124
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,916
- OH NO,
YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN.

125
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,625
YOU'VE KILLED
YOUR DEAREST FRIENDS.

126
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,583
- STOP!
- AAH!

127
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,083
- NO.

128
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,208
- THAT'S RIGHT.

129
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,291
MAKE HIM PAY FOR ALL HE DID.

130
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,375
FINALLY REDEEM YOURSELF.

131
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,666
- OH, I WILL!

132
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,583
( screaming )

133
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,458
- ( all laughing )

134
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,833
- ERZA!

135
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,750
- THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING.

136
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,416
THE MIDNIGHT HOUR
IS STILL YOUNG!

137
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,125
- ( bell tolling )

138
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,708
- ( panting )

139
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,666
- HOW?
 I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

140
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,708
ONLY A MOMENT AGO,
HE WAS A TOWERING MONSTER.

141
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,458
- MY ILLUSION FAILED ME.

142
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,250
SHE SAW RIGHT THROUGH IT.

143
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,833
- AN ILLUSION?

144
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,833
BUT IT WAS SO REAL,
HORRIFYING.

145
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,750
DID ALL THAT HAPPEN JUST WHILE
THE BELL WAS RINGING?

146
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,916
- ANOTHER WEAKNESS
WOULD BE NOT KNOWING

147
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,666
I'M IMMUNE TO VISUAL MAGIC.

148
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,500
- NO, I'VE LOST.

149
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,583
BUT I'M THE STRONGEST ONE.

150
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:32,291
I'M THE ULTIMATE MEMBER
OF THE ORACION SEIS,

151
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,666
EVEN STRONGER THAN MY FATHER.

152
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,083
NO ONE CAN TOUCH ME.

153
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,625
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
THE GREATEST WIZARD

154
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:42,083
THAT'S EVER LIVED.

155
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:48,625
- SOMEONE WHO CAN MOCK THE
SUFFERING OF OTHERS SO CALLOUSLY

156
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,500
HAS A VERY LONG WAY TO GO
TO ACHIEVE GREATNESS.

157
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,625
- ALL I EVER WANTED,
MY PRAYER...

158
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,125
- ( children screaming )

159
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:07,125
- MY PRAYER WAS TO ONE DAY
FIND A QUIET PLACE

160
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:11,541
AND FINALLY SLEEP IN PEACE. 
- ( gunfire echoing )

161
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,583
- FATHER.

162
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:22,333
- THIS IS WHO ERZA TRULY IS.

163
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,041
- IF YOU
TRULY DESIRE GREATNESS,

164
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:28,875
YOU MUST FIRST KNOW
WHAT MAKES YOU WEAK.

165
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,041
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,

166
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,791
LIVE WITH AN OPEN HEART.

167
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:48,208
- ( screaming )

168
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:53,583
- NATSU!  OKAY.

169
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,083
- HEY, LUCY, DO YOU SEE NATSU

170
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,083
ROLLING ON THE
GROUND OVER THERE?

171
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,875
- ACTUALLY, I'M AFRAID
THAT'S NOT

172
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,958
AN EXTREMELY RARE SIGHT
ON THESE KIND OF MISSIONS.

173
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,791
- I GOT YOU NOW!

174
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,041
- YEAH! NOW THAT WE GOT THIS
CLOWN WHERE WE WANT HIM,

175
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,291
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN--

176
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,708
KEEP THAT THING AWAY FROM ME!

177
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,666
- WELL, GET OUT OF THE WAY,
YOU DUMMY!

178
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,333
- TRY AND HOLD IT STILL,
YA FREAK!

179
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,208
- TRY AND DODGE IT, YA SLOWPOKE!

180
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:19,125
- WE ALL KNEW THIS WAS COMING.

181
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,041
- AW, I ALWAYS
GET THE CREEPY STARES.

182
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,708
- OH, NO, YOUR EGO IS SHOWING.
- SHUT UP, CAT!

183
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,791
ONCE AGAIN,
MY CUTENESS IS A BURDEN.

184
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,666
OH, POOR ME.

185
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,291
- THE STRESS
IS GETTING TO HER, GUYS!

186
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,208
SHE'S FINALLY
GONE COMPLETELY INSANE!

187
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,666
- AW, I THOUGHT
THERE WAS A REAL WOMAN HERE,

188
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,166
BUT SHE'S JUST A LITTLE GIRL.
- SAY WHAT?!

189
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,958
- LET'S GO!
- OH YEAH!

190
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,041
- A BUNCH OF ANNOYING KIDS.

191
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,500
- GRAY!  NATSU!

192
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,625
- THIS SKULL STICKMAN GUY
ISN'T PLAYIN' AROUND.

193
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,833
- HA!  POOR BABIES.
YOU MAY BE YOUNG,

194
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,875
BUT YOU'VE GOT A LOT TO LEARN
IF YOU WANT TO BEAT ME.

195
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,500
WHO CARES HOW YOUNG YOU ARE?

196
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,583
SO IF YOU WANNA GO
FLAUNTING YOUR TONED,

197
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,916
LIMBER BODIES AROUND LIKE THAT,
FINE. BUT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.

198
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,416
- IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY
HAS SOME SERIOUS

199
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,833
AGE ISSUES AROUND HERE.

200
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,666
- AYE.
- EH?

201
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,208
- NOW WHAT?

202
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,333
- Lucy: THE TRUTH HURTS,
DOESN'T IT?

203
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,833
- Happy:
I DON'T THINK THAT'S IT.

204
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,083
- Klodoa: OH NO.

205
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,750
THIS CANNOT BE.

206
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,166
THEY ALL HAVE FALLEN.

207
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,833
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

208
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,791
THE SIX DEMONS
HAVE BEEN DEFEATED.

209
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:34,000
THE HORROR!
THE HORROR!

210
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,666
IT'S IMMINENT.
THE GREAT ONE IS COMING!

211
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,083
- Gray: HUH?
- Natsu: WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

212
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,625
- Lucy: WHO'S COMING?

213
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,666
- I BET WHOEVER
THIS "GREAT ONE" IS,

214
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,958
IT'S NOT GONNA BE
SO GREAT FOR US!

215
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,666
- ( rumbling )

216
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,125
- ( teeth chattering )

217
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,250
- SO WHO ARE YOU
BABBLING ABOUT?

218
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,791
- HE'S GETTING SUPER JUICY.
- THAT'S SWEAT, YA DOPE!

219
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,125
- IT'S BRAIN.
- WHAT?

220
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:14,750
- THE OLD BALD BRUISER ALREADY
PUT THAT CREEP ON THE GROUND.

221
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,458
- I'M AWARE OF THAT.
BUT WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW

222
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,750
IS THERE'S ANOTHER PERSONALITY
LURKING INSIDE HIM.

223
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,333
YOU'VE SEEN THE OUTER ONE--

224
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,208
"BRAIN," THE NAME FOR THE CALM,

225
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,333
KNOWLEDGE-SEEKING
PERSONA AT THE SURFACE.

226
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,500
BUT THERE IS A HIDDEN FACE
THAT CRAVES ONLY DESTRUCTION.

227
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,625
THEY CALL HIM "ZERO."

228
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,666
- BRAIN WAS BAD ENOUGH
FOR ME.

229
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,583
- ZERO'S WORSE?

230
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,875
- HE POSSESSES INCREDIBLE POWER

231
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,625
PAIRED WITH AN UNQUENCHABLE
THIRST FOR DESTRUCTION.

232
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,000
BUT BRAIN WAS ABLE
TO SEAL HIM AWAY,

233
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,208
USING SIX MAGICAL KEYS.

234
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:50,000
- Gray: AND THOSE
ARE THE ORACION SEIS?

235
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,375
- CORRECT.

236
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,166
BOUND TOGETHER
USING BODY LINK MAGIC.

237
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,500
AND ONCE
THOSE SIX DEMONS FALL,

238
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,208
ZERO WILL ONCE AGAIN BE FREE
TO ROAM THE LAND,

239
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,583
ANNIHILATING EVERYTHING
WITH THE MISFORTUNE

240
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,541
TO STAND IN HIS PATH.

241
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,791
- OH?

242
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,791
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE A CHALLENGE
TO ME.

243
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,666
- ( moaning )

244
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,291
MASTER ZERO,
I HUMBLY WELCOME YOUR RETURN!

245
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,791
- "MASTER ZERO"?

246
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,166
- THINGS HAVE TAKEN
QUITE AN INTERESTING TURN,

247
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,916
HAVEN'T THEY, KLODOA?

248
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,958
EVEN MIDNIGHT
FELL IN BATTLE.

249
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:34,833
- PLEASE, SIR, I BEG YOU
TO GRANT ME FORGIVENESS!

250
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:38,291
- YOU MISUNDERSTAND ME.
I'M NOT DISPLEASED.

251
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:41,583
ON THE CONTRARY,
IT'S BEEN FAR TOO LONG.

252
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,250
THIS FEELING I HAVE--

253
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,583
THIS FLESH, THIS POWER--

254
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:48,500
I'VE LONGED FOR IT.

255
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,958
IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO BEGIN THE TASK

256
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:54,291
FOR WHICH I WAS SUMMONED.
- YES, SIR!

257
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,958
- YOU SCUM.

258
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:10,041
YOU'VE DONE AN ADMIRABLE JOB
IN DESTROYING MY GUILD.

259
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:14,083
BUT AS ITS MASTER,
I AM BOUND BY MY OBLIGATION

260
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:17,083
TO TAKE MY REVENGE.

261
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,708
- NO WAY.

262
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:22,125
HE'S THE TRUE LEADER
OF THE ORACION SEIS?

263
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,250
- 'FRAID SO.

264
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:30,250
- HIS POWER
IS MAKING THE GROUND SHAKE.

265
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,583
- SO ARE YOU FIRED UP
AND READY TO GO, NATSU?

266
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,000
- THE GUY'S GOT SOME CRAZY
MAGICAL POWER GOIN' ON.

267
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,541
I CAN'T WAIT
TO TAKE HIM DOWN.

268
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,291
- HMM. THAT'S IT.

269
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,166
I'LL BEGIN WITH THE BALD ONE
WHO HARMED THIS BODY

270
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,791
WHILE BRAIN
WAS IN CHARGE OF IT.

271
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,666
HIM FIRST!

272
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,500
- YOU'D REALLY ATTACK SOMEBODY
WHO'S NOT EVEN ABLE TO MOVE?

273
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,708
YOU'RE A COWARD.
- NONSENSE.

274
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,166
SPARE ME YOUR FOOLISH IDEALS.

275
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:07,458
- MY SHIELD--
IT'S NO MATCH FOR HIM.

276
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,625
AAH!

277
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,083
- YOU GUYS!
- OH NO!

278
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,083
- Zero: I TAKE GREAT PLEASURE

279
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:19,041
IN DESTROYING MANY THINGS
THAT DO NOT MOVE.

280
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,416
WHY SHOULD THAT MAN
BE AN EXCEPTION?

281
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,875
- NOW BURN!

282
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,666
- NOW I'M SCARED.

283
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:38,958
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
I'M SO TERRIFIED.

284
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,250
IT'S LIKE I'M STUCK
TO THE GROUND.

285
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,666
THIS IS BAD.

286
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,291
AAH!

287
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,416
- WELL DONE, MASTER ZERO!

288
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,125
VERY WELL DONE.
ONE WAVE OF YOUR HAND

289
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:19,291
AND THOSE RAPSCALLIONS
WERE SENT SIX FEET UNDER!

290
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:24,083
- NOT QUITE THE DECISIVE BLOW
THAT WAS NEEDED.

291
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,625
- WHAT?

292
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,291
- THESE VERMIN ARE ALL STILL
CLEARLY BREATHING DOWN THERE,

293
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,625
SO IT WASN'T ENOUGH.

294
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,958
I WON'T BE FINISHED
UNTIL THEY'RE RIPPED TO SHREDS!

295
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,083
- YOU THINK YOU CAN GO ON?

296
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,666
- YES, I CAN MANAGE.

297
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,291
- FORGIVE ME.

298
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,666
IT SEEMS I'VE BEEN BLINDED
BY MY DRIVE TO STOP NIRVANA.

299
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,916
YOU'RE BADLY HURT,

300
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,458
AND ALMOST ALL YOUR MAGIC POWER
HAS BEEN SPENT IN BATTLE.

301
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,000
I NEED TO BE MINDFUL
OF THE STATE YOU'RE IN NOW.

302
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,291
YOU SHOULD REST.

303
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:15,750
- ERZA, THAT'S KIND,
BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

304
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,875
I UNLEASHED NIRVANA
UPON THIS WORLD

305
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,583
AND I MUST DO EVERYTHING
IN MY POWER TO SEND IT BACK.

306
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,916
I HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE.

307
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,166
- HOW LONG?

308
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,125
I SIMPLY CAN'T HELP
BUT ASK MYSELF.

309
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,708
HOW LONG MUST I CONTINUE
TO FIGHT

310
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,583
THE UNENDING WRONGS
IN THIS WORLD?

311
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,416
- OH, JELLAL.
WHERE COULD HE BE?

312
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,791
I CAN'T FIND HIM ANYWHERE.
- ( both grunt )

313
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:02,125
- I CAN'T DO THIS MUCH LONGER.
I HAVE TO REST.

314
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,958
- OH, OKAY.

315
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,000
I'M SORRY
FOR PUSHING YOU LIKE THIS.

316
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,416
I KNOW IT MUST BE HARD
TO CARRY ME AROUND.

317
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,458
- DON'T FRET ABOUT IT.

318
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:16,291
- Wendy: THOSE MOUNTAINS LOOK
PRETTY FAMILIAR, DON'T THEY?

319
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,750
- I'M AFRAID WE'RE GETTING
DANGEROUSLY CLOSE, CHILD.

320
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,625
WHY DOES THIS ANCIENT CITY
HAVE TO BE SO SPRAWLING?

321
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,708
IT'S LIKE LOOKING
FOR A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK.

322
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,833
- WHAT DO WE DO?
I'M GETTING SCARED.

323
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,541
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IF WE'RE
NOT ABLE TO FIND HIM IN TIME?

324
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,708
- WE CANNOT ALLOW OURSELVES
TO FIND THAT OUT.

325
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,125
THE STAKES ARE FAR TOO HIGH
TO GIVE UP NOW.

326
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,083
- IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

327
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,875
IT'S THE HARDEST THING EVER,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

328
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:43,000
- YOU MUST START BY FOCUSING
YOUR GOALS, CHILD.

329
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,541
DO YOU WANT
TO CATCH UP WITH JELLAL

330
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,166
OR DO YOU WANT HIM
TO STOP THIS THING?

331
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,833
"CHASE TWO MICE AND YOU'LL
CATCH NEITHER," RIGHT?

332
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,916
- I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

333
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,833
WE CAN'T LET NIRVANA
DESTROY OUR GUILD.

334
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,583
- THEN NARROW YOUR FOCUS
ON THAT FOR NOW.

335
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:06,500
THE REST CAN WAIT.
- YEAH.

336
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,166
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS

337
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,833
IS STOPPING THIS THING
IN ITS TRACKS.

338
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:23,958
- HA HA! LOOK, MASTER,
THERE IT IS.

339
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,833
OUR NUMBER-ONE TARGET
IS IN SIGHT.

340
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,333
A GIANT SITTING DUCK!

341
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,041
THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT'S IN STORE FOR THEM.  OH!

342
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:33,166
THOSE DUMMIES IN CAIT SHELTER
ARE IN FOR A BIG SURPRISE.

343
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,458
THEY ARE THE ONES
WHO FIRST DISCOVERED

344
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:36,750
NIRVANA'S AWESOME POWER

345
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,708
AND THEY JUST SEALED IT
AWAY FROM EVERYONE ELSE.

346
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,500
BUT WE'LL SHOW THEM!

347
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,500
BY WIPING CAIT SHELTER
OFF THE MAP,

348
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,666
WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE
MAKES THAT MISTAKE AGAIN.

349
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,250
NIRVANA WILL BE OURS FOREVER.
THIS IS GOING TO BE AMAZING.

350
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,208
- WHAT UTTER NONSENSE.

351
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,625
- WHAT?

352
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,375
- YOU HEARD ME-- NONSENSE.

353
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,291
- AAH!

354
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,791
BUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT,
WISE MASTER ZERO?

355
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,250
AAH!

356
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,291
- HA HA HA!

357
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,250
IT'S JUST DESTRUCTION.

358
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:11,541
THE ONLY THING
I'M AFTER IS DESTRUCTION.

359
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:14,500
ALL THAT IS STANDING
MUST FALL BY MY HANDS.

360
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:18,708
I DON'T NEED ANY OTHER REASON.
I YEARN FOR DESTRUCTION.

361
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:22,166
EVERYTHING IN THIS WORLD
MUST BE DESTROYED!

362
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:31,875
NOW NIRVANA!  FIRE!

363
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:50,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

364
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:14,875
- Happy: HEY, NATSU, DO YOU
KNOW WHAT A PEGASUS IS?

365
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:18,583
- NAH, NOT REALLY, BUT HIBIKI'S
GUILD SEEMS REALLY INTO THEM.

366
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:21,041
- YEAH, OF COURSE, BECAUSE
IT'S A HORSE WITH WINGS.

367
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,875
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? FIRST
THERE WAS THAT SNAKE WITH WINGS

368
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:25,416
AND NOW A FLIPPIN' HORSE?

369
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,625
WHY DOES EVERYONE
KEEP COPYING ME?

370
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:30,416
- I DON'T KNOW. GUESS YOU'RE
KIND OF A TRENDSETTER.

371
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,458
- Both: NEXT TIME--
"FROM PEGASUS TO FAIRIES"!

372
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:35,583
- Happy: IF EVERYBODY
HAD A WEIRD FLYIN' ANIMAL,

373
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:37,541
IT'D BE BAD FOR BUSINESS,
YA KNOW?

374
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:39,708
- Natsu: WAIT A SEC,
WHAT'RE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?

375
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:41,666
WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS
ARE YOU IN?
