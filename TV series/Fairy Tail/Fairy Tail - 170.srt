1
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:19,416
Dragon Slayer Secret Art!

2
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,166
[PORLYUSICA] She's
mastered one of them?

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,958
And at such a young age!

4
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,208
Here it comes!

5
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,500
Yeah!

6
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,250
Wendy learned a
secret technique?

7
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:29,791
A really strong one, too!

8
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,875
She's quite resourceful.

9
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:35,375
What are you doing now?
Are you trying to trap me?

10
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,166
[SHELIA]
But you're in here, too!

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,875
Shattering Light Sky Drill!

12
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:52,541
[SHELIA screams]

13
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:56,125
Shelia!

14
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:58,708
[LUCY and NATSU] Yeah!

15
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:06,083
[WENDY] I haven't fully
mastered the Milky Way yet,

16
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:09,041
but I still gave the
Sky Drill everything I had.

17
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,625
[WENDY]
This is my full strength.

18
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:14,875
[MATO] Oh, my.

19
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:20,666
[PORLYUSICA] Well done,
child. Well done.

20
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,083
[gasps]

21
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:27,833
[WENDY] I hope I didn't
overdo it. But, this means...

22
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:30,625
[MATO] I-I-It looks
like Shelia is down!

23
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:33,708
The winner of match
four is Fairy Tail--

24
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:35,333
[SHELIA] No, wait! Don't
count me out yet! Look!

25
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:39,083
I'm up! I'm up! This fight
is just getting started!

26
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:45,291
You're really somethin' else!
That was so fun!

27
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:46,625
[SHELIA]
You're not hurt, are you?

28
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,916
I was hoping we
could play more.

29
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:22,333
Aye, Sir! Talk about action
packed. Things are really

30
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:25,083
startin' to heat up here
at the Grand Magic Games!

31
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,333
After coming in eighth
place in the prelims,

32
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,250
Natsu and the rest
of Fairy Tail Team A

33
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,750
barely qualified to
participate in the tournament.

34
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,750
And then they did
horribly on day one.

35
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:36,666
But today is a new day,
the team's turned things around

36
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,041
and they've been steadily
racking up the points!

37
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,250
But those cretins in
Raven Tail have done

38
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,666
quite a number on them.

39
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,125
I hope Team B
can bounce back;

40
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,041
they're in bad shape right now.

41
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:47,833
[PANTHERLILY]
They'll have to work harder

42
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,916
if they want to
defeat Sabertooth.

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,208
It won't be easy. They're
the most powerful guild

44
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,791
in all of Fiore.

45
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,125
[CARLA] Like us, they have some
Dragon Slayers on their team:

46
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,958
Sting and Rogue.

47
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,500
[HAPPY] Not only that,
but they've got major skills!

48
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,333
Their Celestial
Spirit wizard, Yukino,

49
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,541
didn't do so well in her
match but everyone else

50
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,375
they've got is super-tough!

51
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,041
And then there's Raven Tail.

52
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,333
It turns out that
the mysterious Alexei

53
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,083
was actually their master, Ivan!

54
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,291
In case you didn't know,

55
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,750
he's the son of our
guild's master, Makarov,

56
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,708
which means he's
also Laxus's father.

57
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,333
Gajeel once worked
as a double agent,

58
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,791
by spying on Raven Tail

59
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,333
and reporting back
to Master Makarov.

60
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,250
The battle between
father-and-son guilds

61
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,708
seemed to go on forever,
but when it was over,

62
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:33,583
it was Wendy's turn to fight and
her opponent turned out to be...

63
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,750
[HAPPY] Shelia of Laymia Scale!

64
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,708
Did you know that
she's Sherry's cousin?

65
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,083
Both of you have some experience
with their guild, don't you?

66
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,250
I was told Laymia Scale
and Blue Pegasus

67
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,666
once teamed up
with Fairy Tail

68
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,666
to defeat the Oracion Seis.

69
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,166
Aye, Sir, that's true.
This festival of magic

70
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,000
is filled with both old
friends and new faces. In fact,

71
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,666
that's what makes the Grand
Magic Games so incredible!

72
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,375
Now! I think
it's time we get back

73
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:56,833
to the battle, don't you?

74
00:04:56,916 --> 00:05:00,041
Who's gonna win this one.
Will it be Wendy or Shelia?

75
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:04,291
Go Wendy! Win it
for Fairy Tail!

76
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,875
Whoa, you're not
gonna give up are you?

77
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:22,833
C'mon Wendy!

78
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,333
She can barely stand.

79
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,541
Poor girl.

80
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,208
This is one intense battle.

81
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,625
[HAPPY] Small Fists!

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,333
[JELLAL] I'm not sure how,
but it's possible Shelia

83
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,583
could be tied in with Zeref.

84
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:53,583
[JELLAL] If that's true,
Wendy could be in real trouble!

85
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,208
[MALE CROWD 170B]
Hold up. That guy's...

86
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,875
[FEMALE CROWD 170A]
It's Mystogan!

87
00:05:56,958 --> 00:06:00,708
[JELLAL] Should I try to stop
them? Or just wait and see?

88
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,041
[DORANBOLT] He seems
focused on Wendy.

89
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,250
I know they're
in the same guild,

90
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,416
but something's not right.

91
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,208
I managed to infiltrate
Fairy Tail seven years ago.

92
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:17,333
And as a result, I know some of
the guild's inside information.

93
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,583
[DORANBOLT] Mystogan.

94
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,583
There's no way he could
be in Earth Land right now.

95
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:33,000
[WENDY]

96
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,958
Hey, listen.
I don't hate fighting,

97
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,333
but I don't love it either.

98
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,208
It's just gonna get
worse for you if ya keep

99
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:41,583
dragging this out 'cause
it's obvious I'm gonna win.

100
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:50,083
[JELLAL] He's from the Council.
That's all I need.

101
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,375
[SHELIA] You should
probably just give up.

102
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:53,875
'Kay?

103
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,041
No, I can't!

104
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,500
[gasps]

105
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,666
The fact that I'm still standing
right here in front of you

106
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,291
means that I'm not backing down.

107
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,250
I'm willing to give everything
I've got for my guild.

108
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,041
I don't need your pity.

109
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,541
I'm not giving up, so
please, come and get me!

110
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,666
Beat me until I
fall to the ground!

111
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,458
Can ya do that?

112
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,458
Wendy.

113
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,208
[chuckles]

114
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,041
Well, if that's
what you really want.

115
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,291
It is!

116
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,625
Okay. Then I guess it's
time for my big attack!

117
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,125
[chuckles]

118
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:46,041
[SHELIA] It'll all be over
once I hit you with this one!

119
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,541
[SHELIA] God Slayer Secret Art!

120
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:53,750
Don't do it, Shelia!

121
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,083
Have you gone mad?

122
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:58,875
You dimwit! Are you trying
to kill the poor girl?

123
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,458
[SHELIA] She came at me full
force so I gotta do the same.

124
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,625
Cause that's love!

125
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,166
Whoa. What kind
of magic is that?

126
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,041
[JELLAL] No.

127
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:20,958
Gathering...
Clouds of Heaven!

128
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,416
Hmph.

129
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,666
She dodged it?

130
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,875
More like it missed her!

131
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,291
Shelia's magic can
perform self-restoration

132
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,458
but it's limited.
It heals physical damage.

133
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,583
Yet it does nothing
to recover lost stamina.

134
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,791
Hm.

135
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,583
Wendy's magic is
just the opposite.

136
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,458
It can't perform
self-restoration,

137
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,791
but it can restore
a target's stamina.

138
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,541
Seriously?

139
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,708
Uh, wait, does that mean...?

140
00:08:56,791 --> 00:09:00,291
She helped her opponent,
and that's what messed her up.

141
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,625
So her attack was
thrown off course

142
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,791
because of the added power.

143
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,333
She made it miss.

144
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:16,500
[GRAY] By increasing
her enemy's energy!

145
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,166
Whoa...

146
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,083
[SHELIA] What a great tactic!

147
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,500
Way to go!

148
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:27,208
Sky Dragon Crushing Fang!

149
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,541
Wow, Wendy! You're awesome!

150
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,500
[power yell]

151
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,291
[power yell]

152
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:48,166
What an amazing turn of events,
ladies and gentlemen!

153
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,791
They're tough!
Neither one is giving up!

154
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,916
[CHAPATI] It's a small
fisted smack down!

155
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,500
Are they really dukin' it
out just for their guilds?

156
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,375
[yells]

157
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,083
[JELLAL] I can't stop them.

158
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:07,166
[JELLAL] Their

00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:38,500
They've been harboring
him all this time.

318
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,875
Fairy Tail's protecting Jellal?

319
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,666
Erzy how could you?

320
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,666
Thank you for
understanding my situation.

321
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,875
Oh, uh. No thanks needed.

322
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,416
I apologize for my ignorance.

323
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,208
Just so you know, I consider
Jellal a menace as well.

324
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:03,166
If I find him, I'll
be sure to notify you.

325
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,875
[JELLAL] Excuse me.

326
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,416
[JELLAL] I'm in
your debt, Mr. Yajima.

327
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,125
[YAJIMA] I won't do it again.

328
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,833
You should leave before you
cause any trouble for Maky.

329
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,416
[JELLAL] I will.
I assure you I'll be gone

330
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,625
by the end of the games.

331
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:24,125
That was really him.

332
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,833
I'll let Mr. Yajima save
face for the time being,

333
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,791
but just this once.

334
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:42,125
[JELLAL] The trail's gone cold.

335
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,583
That strange,
foreboding presence.

336
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,833
It can't be Zeref.

337
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,875
But who is it?

338
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,708
Hmmm.

339
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,125
[LAXUS] Hurts, huh?

340
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:16,041
After everything you've
done, the old geezer

341
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,791
still managed to have
a little faith in you.

342
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,125
'Cause you're his son.

343
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,458
Silence!

344
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,583
Every waking moment
I lived in the shadows

345
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,375
was to prepare for this day!
All so that I could finally

346
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,958
have the Lumen Histoire
within my grasp!

347
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,375
Tell me where the Lumen
Histoire is, Laxus?

348
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:37,958
Stop hiding it!

349
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,875
[IVAN]
You're my son, aren't you?

350
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:43,083
Where's your loyalty
to your family?

351
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,958
Hey geezer. Wanna tell me
about the Lumen Histoire?

352
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,916
Lemme guess, Ivan mentioned it?

353
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,625
Yeah, over and over again.

354
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,583
Seems he really wants
to get his hands on it.

355
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:05,625
That kid. Good for nothin'.

356
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:09,500
He tried to tell me that it's
Fairy Tail's "darkest secret."

357
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,125
It's not "dark" at all.

358
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,625
First Master!

359
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,541
[MAVIS] The Lumen Histoire.

360
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,625
It's actually what brings
light into our guild.

361
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,958
Remember you mustn't tell him!

362
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:30,041
Yeah, I know that.
It's top-secret information

363
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:34,708
that's only shared with...
those who serve as guild master.

364
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:38,291
Sorry. I hope you
can understand, Laxus.

365
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,041
Hey, as long as it
ain't somethin' weird,

366
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,708
I got no reason to pry.

367
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,083
Aw, thanks. You're the best!

368
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,708
I wonder...
how was Ivan able to

369
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:50,416
get hold of such
classified information?

370
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,208
Well, I assume...

371
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:55,291
[MAVIS] the second master,
Precht, told him.

372
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:56,416
Hmmm.

373
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,333
Yes, he would be
the most likely source.

374
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:02,791
I never thought that he
would fall to the dark side.

375
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,750
Choosing him was such
a terrible decision.

376
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:09,250
Now, now. You mustn't blame
yourself, First Master.

377
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,125
[MAVIS] But it's all my fault.

378
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:11,958
Ah!

379
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,833
I chose him.

380
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:18,250
[BOTH] Ahhh!

381
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,541
Please don't cry!

382
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:27,250
Uh... Hey, geezer.
What do we do?

383
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm just fine!
I'm not crying! I'm not!

384
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,583
I'm not... crying.

385
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:39,083
Go on, Laxus!
Comfort her! Hurry!

386
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:42,125
Me? Why do I have
to do it? Can't you?

387
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:15,333
[NATSU] You gotta be kiddin' me!
Another swimsuit battle?

388
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:16,708
[HAPPY] Hey, guess what, Natsu?

389
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,458
I saw a pretty skimpy
lookin' bathing suit

390
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,333
sitting in another
guild's locker room!

391
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:21,625
[NATSU] Yeah, so?

392
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:23,250
[HAPPY] It was nothin'
but the bottoms!

393
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:25,333
Somebody's gonna
be fightin' topless!

394
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,333
[NATSU] Seriously?
Man, that's wild!

395
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:30,750
[HAPPY] Ugh. That's not really
the reaction I was expecting.

396
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:33,083
[HAPPY and NATSU]
Next time: "Naval Battle!"

397
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:35,000
[NATSU] What kinda reaction
were you expecting?

398
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:36,208
[HAPPY] Somethin' more like,

399
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:37,750
"Heh heh, I'm gettin'
front row seats!" or

400
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:40,208
"I hope you're ready for
some jiggle, lil' buddy!"

401
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:41,833
[NATSU] Geez, I'm not a perv.
