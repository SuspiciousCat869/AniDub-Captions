1
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,833
- Natsu: PREVIOUSLY,
ON FAIRY TAIL!

2
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:21,041
- Lucy: WITH CARLA
LEADING THE WAY,

3
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:22,208
WE INFILTRATED THE TUNNELS

4
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,166
UNDER THE KING OF
EDOLAS' CASTLE,

5
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,541
BUT IT WASN'T LONG 'TIL WE WERE
AMBUSHED AND CAPTURED

6
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,250
BY ERZA KNIGHTWALKER.

7
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:29,958
WHY DO I GET THE FEELING
I'M NOT GONNA GET MUCH

8
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:31,333
SCREEN TIME THIS EPISODE?

9
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,041
- Happy: IT'S TIME TO LET
SOMEONE ELSE SHINE.

10
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:36,208
- Lucy: BUT I'M THE ONE WITH
THE MAGIC. SOMEBODY HELP ME.

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,375
- ( theme song playing )

12
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:56,250
( singing in Japanese )

13
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,458
- ( both grunting )

14
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,500
- Natsu: WHY, YOU...

15
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,208
HEY, WHERE ARE THE OTHERS?

16
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:27,666
- OTHERS?

17
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,541
- YEAH, WHERE'RE OUR FRIENDS
LUCY, CARLA, AND HAPPY?

18
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,708
- WHO'S LUCY?

19
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:36,208
OH, YOU MEAN
THE BLONDE BIMBO?

20
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,375
PRETTY LITTLE THING.

21
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,500
UNFORTUNATELY, WE'VE
GOT NO USE FOR HER.

22
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,291
SO SHE'S GONNA BE EXECUTED.

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,375
- IF YOU JERKS SO MUCH AS
LAY A FINGER ON LUCY,

24
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,750
I SWEAR, YOU'RE GONNA PAY.

25
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,083
I'LL BURN YOU DOWN
TO A PILE OF ASHES!

26
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,708
- Happy: EXTALIA.

27
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:08,416
- WHOA. WELL, AREN'T YOU
A SCARY ONE?

28
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,916
SO TELL ME SOMETHIN',

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,958
ARE ALL EARTH LAND WIZARDS
JUST AS FEROCIOUS AS YOU ARE?

30
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,041
- YOU'RE GONNA EXECUTE LUCY?

31
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,625
WHAT'LL HAPPEN TO
CARLA AND HAPPY?

32
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,416
- NO NEED TO WORRY
ABOUT THE EXCEEDS.

33
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,125
- HIS NAME IS HAPPY.
GET IT STRAIGHT!

34
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,250
- THE EXCEEDS ACCOMPLISHED
THEIR MISSION,

35
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,916
SO WE TOOK 'EM BACK TO
THEIR HOMELAND.

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,291
IN FACT, I BET THE LITTLE GUYS
HAVE CLAIMED THEIR REWARD

37
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,875
AND ARE HAVING A FEAST
AS WE SPEAK.

38
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,166
- WHAT?

39
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,125
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT MISSION?

40
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:38,083
- BY RETURNING TO EDOLAS,
I WILL BE ABANDONING MY MISSION.

41
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,333
ONE HANDED DOWN BY
THE KINGDOM ITSELF.

42
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,500
- NO WAY, THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

43
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,916
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF
MISSION YOU GUYS SENT HER ON,

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,541
BUT I KNOW CARLA
ABANDONED IT.

45
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,125
- ( laughing ) OH, YEAH?

46
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:56,916
SHE ACTUALLY
COMPLETED IT LIKE A PRO.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,916
- THAT CAN'T BE. WHAT ARE
YOU MAKING THEM DO FOR YOU?

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,541
- ( chuckles )

49
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,583
YOU MEAN, YOU STILL HAVEN'T
FIGURED IT OUT YET?

50
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,541
- ( people chattering )

51
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,708
- ( footsteps approaching )

52
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,125
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

53
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,750
- THANKS FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK!
- WHO ARE YOU?

54
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,625
- OH, I'M JUST YOUR
AVERAGE JOURNALIST.

55
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:46,791
I'M COVERING THE CEREMONY.

56
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,625
I'D LOVE TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS,

57
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:49,958
THAT IS, IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND.

58
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,250
- I GOT NO COMMENT.
NOW BEAT IT.

59
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,208
- I SEE THE KING HAS TROOPS
STATIONED ALONG

60
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,541
THE NORTHERN SIDE OF THE PLAZA.

61
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,291
IS IT THEREFORE
SAFE TO ASSUME

62
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,916
THERE ARE SOLDIERS STATIONED
ON THE SOUTHERN SIDE

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,375
OF IT AS WELL?

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,500
- GET OUTTA HERE!

65
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,291
- ( chuckles ) SORRY, GENTLEMEN,
I DIDN'T MEAN TO DISTURB YOU.

66
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,625
( laughs )

67
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:23,125
- JUST GREAT. CAN'T RUSH IN
WITH THOSE PEOPLE DOWN THERE.

68
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,375
THEY COULD WIND UP GETTING HURT
IN THE SOLDIERS' ATTACK.

69
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,208
WHAT AM I GONNA DO NOW?

70
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,041
- WHAT THE...

71
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,125
WHERE ARE WE?

72
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,666
HEY, CARLA, WAKE UP.

73
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,708
- TOMCAT, WHAT IS THIS?

74
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,541
- ( gasps )

75
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,708
- WHAT IN THE WORLD
HAPPENED TO US?

76
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:06,000
- ALL I KNOW IS WE WERE KNOCKED
OUT AND WOKE UP HERE.

77
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,041
THIS WEIRD PLACE,

78
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,458
I KNOW I'VE NEVER
BEEN HERE BEFORE.

79
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,000
ARE YOU OKAY?

80
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:26,833
- IT SEEMS MY INFORMATION
WAS ACTUALLY A TRAP.

81
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,208
- THAT'S NOT TRUE. I'M SURE
IT WAS JUST A COINCIDENCE

82
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,500
THEY FOUND US.

83
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,500
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT, CARLA.

84
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,583
- I'VE BETRAYED DEAR WENDY.

85
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:46,333
I SWORE THAT I WOULD
PROTECT HER NO MATTER WHAT.

86
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,791
I MUST PROTECT HER. SHE'S THE
ONLY THING THAT MATTERS TO ME.

87
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,166
( crying )

88
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,208
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

89
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,791
- ( both gasp )

90
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,375
- GLIMMEOW. GLIMMEOW.

91
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,291
I BEG YOUR PARDON...

92
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,083
ARE YOU THE ONES WHO
RECENTLY COMPLETED

93
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,875
AN EARTH LAND MISSION, GLIMMEOW?

94
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,375
- IT'S NICHIYA?

95
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,458
- MEOW. NICE PARFUM.

96
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,125
- WAIT A SECOND, YOU'RE A CAT?

97
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,083
- DON'T BE SILLY,
I'M NO MERE CAT.

98
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,250
I'M AN EXCEED,
JUST LIKE YOU.

99
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,500
- MR. NICHIYA, SIR.

100
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:23,708
I'VE BEEN TOLD THIS IS THE FIRST
TIME THEY'VE BEEN TO EDOLAS.

101
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:27,208
IN FACT, I DOUBT THEY'VE EVER
SEEN ANOTHER EXCEED BEFORE.

102
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,458
- REALLY? WELL, I HAD NO IDEA.

103
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,250
- WELCOME. I AM NICHIYA,

104
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,416
THE CAPTAIN OF EXTALIA'S
ROYAL GUARD.

105
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,291
MEOW. MEOW.

106
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,583
- AND MY NAME IS NADI.

107
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,000
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS
EXTALIA'S MINISTER OF STATE.

108
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,291
CONGRATS ON YOUR MISSION.

109
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,583
- OUR MISSION?
- ( sighs )

110
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,375
- IT'LL BE OKAY, CARLA.

111
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,041
- I KNOW THIS IS RATHER SUDDEN

112
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,541
BUT THE QUEEN WOULD
LIKE TO SEE YOU.

113
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,333
- FOLLOW ME.
- THE QUEEN? SERIOUSLY?

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,916
DON'T WORRY, JUST LEAVE
EVERYTHING TO ME.

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,666
THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO
IS GET THE LAY OF THE LAND.

116
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:09,458
I PROMISE I'M GONNA
PROTECT YOU, CARLA.

117
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,375
- EXCELLENT WORK, MEN.
- Guards: MEOW, SIR!

118
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,208
- THERE'RE CATS EVERYWHERE.

119
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,833
- I BET YOU'RE EXCITED,
AREN'T YOU?

120
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,833
- I MIGHT BE IF I KNEW
WHAT IN THE HECK WAS GOIN' ON.

121
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,208
( exclaims )

122
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,708
- HEY, BABY, WANNA GO SHARE
SOME MILK WITH ME?

123
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,875
- ( gasping )

124
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,875
- HELLO THERE, MA'AM,
MAY I INTEREST YOU IN

125
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,125
SOME FRESHLY CAUGHT FISH TODAY?

126
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,833
- YES, I'LL TAKE THOSE.

127
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,791
AND ONE OF THE MACKEREL OVER
THERE, PLEASE.

128
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,500
- SURE THING. TELL YOU WHAT,

129
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,708
SINCE YOU'VE GOT SO MANY
YOUNG'UNS AT HOME TO FEED,

130
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,416
I'LL THROW IN
SOME EXTRA FOR FREE!

131
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,375
- THANK YOU. THAT IS SO
INCREDIBLY KIND OF YOU, SIR!

132
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,333
- ( chuckles ) I FIGURE I SHOULD
SPREAD THE WEALTH

133
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,291
SINCE THE QUEEN'S GENEROSITY
IS THE ONLY REASON

134
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,666
I MAKE A LIVING EACH DAY.

135
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,250
- WELL, MY KITTENS
AND I THANK YOU.

136
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,958
- NO PROBLEM.

137
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,500
- I SWEAR I'M NOT LYIN'.

138
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,583
I WENT DOWN TO THE SURFACE
THE OTHER DAY TO GATHER

139
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,000
INFO AND THAT'S WHEN I SAW IT.

140
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,291
- YOU GONNA TELL US WHAT
YOU SAW DOWN THERE OR WHAT?

141
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:19,458
- I CAME FACE TO FACE WITH A
CATERPILLAR THAT WAS THIS BIG.

142
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,541
- QUIT PULLIN' MY LEG, KID.

143
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,458
YOU DON'T REALLY EXPECT ME TO
BELIEVE THAT CATERPILLARS

144
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,958
GROW THAT BIG, DO YOU?

145
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:28,083
- IN OTHER WORDS, WHETHER
THE KING KNOWS IT OR NOT,

146
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:31,666
HE IS UNDER THE EXCEEDS' CONTROL
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER HUMAN.

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,083
- ( laughing )

148
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,666
- LET'S GO GET SOME
TREATS, YOU GUYS.

149
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,416
- WAIT FOR ME!

150
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,625
- IT'S A LAND OF CATS.

151
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,916
- LOOK, IT'S SIR NICHIYA.
- MEOW.

152
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,375
- SIR NADI, HOW'RE YOU
DOIN' TODAY?

153
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,166
- I'M GREAT,
THANK YOU FOR ASKING.

154
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,291
- HEY, CHECK IT OUT.
IS THAT THEM?

155
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,791
- YES, THEY'RE THE
ONES WHO COMPLETED

156
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,041
THEIR EARTH LAND MISSION.

157
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,125
- YOU GUYS ROCK.
YOU'RE HEROES.

158
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,458
- THAT CHICK'S PRETTY HOT, I
WONDER IF SHE'S WITH THAT GUY?

159
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,958
- EVERYBODY'S A CAT HERE.

160
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:06,416
- I'M AFRAID THAT YOU'RE WRONG,
MY FRIEND, WE'RE EXCEEDS, HERE.

161
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,125
WE STAND ABOVE THE HUMANS.

162
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,916
IT'S OUR DUTY TO GUIDE THEM
EACH AND EVERY DAY.

163
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,791
- I'VE NEVER HEARD OF YOU.

164
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,500
- AND THAT BEAUTIFUL
SIGHT BEFORE YOU

165
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:26,708
IS THE EXCEED KINGDOM, EXTALIA.

166
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,291
- ( drums beating )

167
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,750
- LOOK, HERE THEY COME.
- IT'S ALMOST TIME.

168
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,833
- I SEE THINGS ARE
FINALLY GETTING UNDERWAY.

169
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:44,500
- MMM-HMM. THE KINGDOM WILL BE
MUCH MORE STABLE AFTER THIS.

170
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,750
- WE'RE ON THE SOUTHERN SIDE
OF THE PLAZA.

171
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,833
LET ME ASK, IS SECURITY AS TIGHT
ON THE EASTERN AND WESTERN SIDES

172
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,208
AS IT IS HERE?

173
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,833
- NO, BUT ONLY BECAUSE
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROOM

174
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,291
FOR ANYBODY TO HIDE THERE.

175
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,750
- OH REALLY, IS THAT SO?
- PLEASE DON'T WRITE THAT

176
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,250
IN THE ARTICLE.
IT'LL GET ME IN TROUBLE.

177
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:05,500
- I'D NEVER DO SUCH A THING.
I ASSURE YOU, I'M COMPLETELY

178
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,666
AWARE OF WHAT'S APPROPRIATE
TO WRITE AND WHAT ISN'T.

179
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,791
I STRIVE TO BE
A FAIR JOURNALIST.

180
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:10,916
- YEAH.

181
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,750
- THERE ARE TROOPS STATIONED
ON THE NORTH AND SOUTH SIDES.

182
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,666
HOWEVER, JUST NORTH OF
THE SOUTH SIDE IS UNDERMANNED.

183
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,041
ACCORDING TO MY SOURCES,

184
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,875
THE CEREMONY WILL BE HELD
SOUTH OF THE LACRIMA.

185
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,791
HMM.

186
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,083
- HUH?

187
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,041
I SEE. WELL, HERE GOES NOTHIN'.

188
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,833
( laughing )

189
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:18,041
- YOU SEE, IN OUR WORLD, HUMANS
ARE A FOOLISH, INFERIOR SPECIES.

190
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:21,041
SO, IT IS OUR DUTY AS EXCEEDS
TO KEEP THEM UNDER CONTROL.

191
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,625
- IN CASE YOU DIDN'T NOTICE,
THEY HAVE A NASTY PARFUM.

192
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:29,666
BY THE
WAY, PARFUM MEANS SMELL. MEOW.

193
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,166
- OUR BELOVED QUEEN
WATCHES OVER THE HUMANS

194
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,625
AND GOVERNS THEM
FROM THIS CASTLE.

195
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,125
- SHE HAS AN ABSOLUTELY
DELIGHTFUL PARFUM.

196
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,000
- IT'D BE DANGEROUS IF THE
HUMANS' NUMBERS

197
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,750
WERE TO GET OUT OF HAND, SO
THE QUEEN DETERMINES

198
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:44,416
WHICH HUMANS ARE UNNECESSARY
AND HAS THEM EXECUTED.

199
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,458
- BUT WHY WOULD SHE
WANNA DO THAT?

200
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,958
- TO HELP RESTORE THE MAGIC
POWER THAT'S DWINDLING

201
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,166
FROM OUR WORLD.

202
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,000
AT LEAST, THAT'S WHAT
THE QUEEN SAID.

203
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,750
YOU SEE, NOT ONLY DOES SHE
GOVERN THE HUMANS OF THIS WORLD,

204
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,500
BUT SHE CONTROLS THE HUMANS
OF EARTH LAND AS WELL.

205
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,958
- AND SHE DECIDES
WHICH PEOPLE LIVE OR DIE?

206
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,208
- YES, OUR BENEVOLENT QUEEN
HAS THAT AUTHORITY.

207
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:07,291
AFTER ALL, SHE IS
A GODDESS, MEOW!

208
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,916
- A GODDESS?

209
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:54,375
- THIS MISSION YOUR QUEEN
SENT US ON, I REMEMBER.

210
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,833
IT'S COMING BACK TO ME.

211
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,958
THIS MISSION HAS BEEN IMPRINTED
ON ME SINCE I WAS BORN.

212
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:10,083
THE QUEEN CHOSE ME TO HELP HER
CONTROL THE HUMAN POPULATION.

213
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:13,791
I WAS ORDERED TO ELIMINATE
THE DRAGON SLAYER WENDY.

214
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,291
- HUH? WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN, CARLA?

215
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,541
- PLEASE DON'T ASK.

216
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:22,791
- TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN
WHEN YOU SAY YOU WERE

217
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,500
ORDERED TO ELIMINATE WENDY?

218
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,541
NO WAY.

219
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,791
THEN, DOES THAT MEAN...

220
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,416
MY MISSION WAS TO...

221
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,291
NO, THAT CAN'T BE TRUE.

222
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,291
- I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT THAT
YOU WERE BETTER OFF

223
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,625
NOT KNOWING THE TRUTH.

224
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,333
- I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

225
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,291
MY MISSION WAS TO
ELIMINATE NATSU?

226
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,666
- THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

227
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,916
- NO WAY.

228
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,541
- ( cheering )

229
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,083
- ( drums beating )

230
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,541
- I'M SUPPOSED TO
ELIMINATE NATSU?

231
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,041
- WOULD YOU JUST
CALM DOWN, TOMCAT?

232
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,875
LET ME MAKE ONE THING CLEAR,

233
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,000
WE DIDN'T ACCOMPLISH
OUR MISSIONS,

234
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,750
NOR DID WE EVER INTEND TO DO SO.

235
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,750
WHY IS EVERYBODY TALKING
TO US AS IF WE HAVE?

236
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,041
- DO YOU THINK IT'S AMNESIA?

237
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,833
- PERHAPS. YOU SEE THERE ARE
COUNTLESS SIDE-EFFECTS

238
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,958
OF OVERWRITING THAT
ARE STILL WIDELY UNKNOWN.

239
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,416
- ANSWER ME!

240
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,291
- OF COURSE, PLEASE ALLOW ME
TO EXPLAIN.

241
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,958
SIX YEARS AGO, OUR BELOVED QUEEN
SENT ONE HUNDRED EXCEEDS

242
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,875
TO EARTH LAND, IN
THE HOPES OF BETTER

243
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,833
CONTROLLING THE
HUMAN POPULATION.

244
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,041
AFTER THEY HATCHED,

245
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,791
THE INFORMATION THEY
HAD BEEN GIVEN

246
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,625
WOULD LEAD THEM TO
SEEK OUT AND ELIMINATE

247
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,333
THE DRAGON SLAYERS.

248
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,833
- ( growling )

249
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:31,666
- THEN, ONE DAY,
THE SITUATION CHANGED.

250
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,375
YOU SEE, WHEN THE HUMANS
CREATED ANIMA

251
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,916
WE WERE PRESENTED WITH
A NEW AND EXCITING POSSIBILITY.

252
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,541
WITH ITS INVENTION WE REALIZED
RATHER THAN SIMPLY

253
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:43,708
KILLING EARTH LAND HUMANS,

254
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,833
WE COULD CONVERT THEM
INTO MAGIC POWER.

255
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,083
AND IT'S WELL KNOWN THAT
THE DRAGON SLAYERS

256
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,458
ARE THE MOST POWERFUL OF
THE HUMAN WIZARDS.

257
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,333
THEREFORE, INSTEAD OF
ELIMINATING THEM,

258
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,250
YOU WERE ORDERED TO
BRING THEM INTO CUSTODY.

259
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,125
- Hughes: THIS IS SO COOL.

260
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,833
WE FINALLY GOT OUR HANDS ON YOU.

261
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,625
YOU BOTH HAVE SO MUCH
OF THAT AWESOME DRAGON SLAYER

262
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,083
MAGIC INSIDE YOU.

263
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,416
ALL WE GOTTA DO NOW
IS SUCK IT OUT.

264
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,666
( laughing )

265
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,333
- ( crying )

266
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:10,000
- I GOTTA HURRY. BUT IT'S SO
CROWDED I CAN BARELY MOVE.

267
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,000
- HEY. WHAT THE HECK'S
THAT THING?

268
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:29,875
- OH THIS? WELL, UH, FIREWORKS
FOR THE MAGIC POWER EXTRACTION.

269
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,083
COOL, HUH? WATCH THIS.

270
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,500
- FIREWORKS!

271
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,291
- THAT'S AWESOME.
I HOPE THEY SHOOT SOME MORE.

272
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,500
- WHAT THE...

273
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,958
- NO ONE SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT FIREWORKS!

274
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:56,208
- GUESS ONE LETTER'S NOT ENOUGH.
LET'S GO ALL OUT!

275
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,833
- THE NORTH?

276
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,125
- AND THE REST IS
UP TO YOU, MY FRIEND.

277
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,833
- SOLDIERS, THAT MUST BE
SOME KIND OF WARNING.

278
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,791
WE MUST PROTECT THE LACRIMA.

279
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,166
I SUSPECT THAT THERE'S
SOMEONE SUSPICIOUS

280
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,541
ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE PLAZA.

281
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,125
- WHAT?

282
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,708
- WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING. THAT'S
THE REAR SIDE OF THE LACRIMA.

283
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,416
WE DON'T HAVE MANY MEN
POSITIONED THERE.

284
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,875
- KEEP YOUR FORCES HERE
AND I'LL TAKE THE OTHERS NORTH.

285
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,791
PUSH THE CROWD BACK
FOR THEIR SAFETY.

286
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,083
- YES, SIR.

287
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,291
YOU HEARD THE MAN!
EVERYONE, PLEASE MOVE BACK.

288
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,958
- ALL RIGHT. IT'S ABOUT TIME FOR
ME TO MAKE MY MOVE. HERE GOES.

289
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,458
- HEY, DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME?
I SAID MOVE BACK.

290
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,541
- THAT MYSTOGAN GUY MAY BE
ONE FREAKY WEIRDO,

291
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,750
BUT I GOT NO OTHER CHOICE BUT
TO TRUST HIM FOR RIGHT NOW.

292
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,625
- ( clamoring )
- IRON DRAGON CLUB!

293
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,541
- IT'S GOING PRECISELY
AS PLANNED.

294
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,916
- IRON DRAGON SWORD!

295
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,333
AIN'T NO STOPPIN' ME.

296
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,541
( yelling )

297
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,875
( grunting ) WHOA.
WHAT THE...

298
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,625
- JUDGING BY YOUR REACTIONS,

299
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,750
IT WOULD APPEAR OVERWRITING
YOUR ORDERS REMOTELY

300
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,458
MAY NOT HAVE BEEN
THE BEST IDEA.

301
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,791
- HOWEVER, EVERYTHING
WORKED OUT IN THE END.

302
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,166
YOU WERE STILL ABLE TO BRING
THE DRAGON SLAYERS TO US

303
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,666
DESPITE THE ERRONEOUS ORDERS.

304
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,916
- ( crying )

305
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,541
- Nichiya: THE HUMANS HAVE BEEN
TASKED WITH MAGICALIZATION,

306
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,875
WHICH IS THEIR CONVERSION
TO MAGIC POWER.

307
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,666
AFTER ALL, THEY'RE
MUCH MORE PROFICIENT

308
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,750
AT THAT SORT OF THING.

309
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,125
MEOW. MEOW.

310
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:50,541
- ( crying ) NO, IT CAN'T BE.
I CAME TO EDOLAS...

311
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,750
I CAME HERE
OF MY OWN FREE WILL.

312
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:57,166
- 'FRAID NOT. YOU WERE ACTING ON
THE WILL OF OUR FAIR QUEEN.

313
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:01,083
- BUT I LED EVERYONE TO THE
TUNNEL TO TRY AND SAVE THEM.

314
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,875
- IT MAY HAVE APPEARED
THAT WAY TO YOU

315
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,583
BUT ACTUALLY WE WERE THE ONES
WHO GUIDED YOU THERE.

316
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,625
- WHO ARE YOU,
HAPPY AND CARLA?

317
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,791
I THOUGHT THAT YOU
WERE OUR FRIENDS.

318
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:14,000
- ( crying ) NO, IT CAN'T BE.
ALL I EVER WANTED...

319
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,916
ALL I WANTED WAS TO
PROTECT WENDY.

320
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,375
SHE'S ALL THAT
MATTERS TO ME.

321
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,083
- WHAT YOU EXPERIENCED WAS
ACTUALLY A SELF-DELUSION.

322
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,708
WHEN YOUR ORDERS CHANGED
FROM ELIMINATE TO CAPTURE,

323
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,041
YOUR DUTY BECAME PROTECTING
THE DRAGON SLAYERS

324
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,375
TO ENSURE THEY WERE NOT KILLED.

325
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,208
- THAT'S NOT TRUE!

326
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,916
- WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT,
YOUR EVERY MOVE UP TO THIS POINT

327
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,333
HAS BEEN COMPLETELY
CONTROLLED BY US.

328
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,041
- ( sobbing loudly )

329
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,791
- LET'S GET ONE THING STRAIGHT,
WE'RE NOT YOUR PUPPETS.

330
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,000
- ( gasping )

331
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,916
- TOMCAT...

332
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,041
- YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG.

333
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:27,166
WE'RE FAIRY TAIL WIZARDS,
WE DON'T WORK FOR YOU.

334
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:33,958
( breathing heavily )

335
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,458
- OH, HAPPY...

336
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,041
- ( theme song playing )

337
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,166
- ( singing in Japanese )

338
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:15,333
- Natsu: ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO GET
EVERYONE AND BUST OUTTA HERE.

339
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:17,875
- Happy: AYE, SIR. WON'T TAKE
LONG WITH ME ON THE JOB.

340
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:20,000
IT'S JUST ONE QUICK FLIGHT
AND WE'RE THERE.

341
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,333
WAIT, I FORGOT I CAN'T
USE MY MAGIC.

342
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:24,291
- Natsu: GEEZ,
GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER.

343
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,541
YOU KNOW, IF YOU CAN'T
FLY, YOU'RE NOTHIN'

344
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:26,916
BUT A TALKIN' CAT, LIL' BUDDY.

345
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,375
- Happy: WOW, THAT WAS MEAN.

346
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,708
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU THREW
THAT OUT THERE SO CASUALLY.

347
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:34,000
- Both: NEXT TIME,
FLY, TO OUR FRIENDS!

348
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:36,000
ALL RIGHT, IF THAT'S THE CASE,
THEN WHAT DOES THAT MAKE YOU

349
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:37,500
WHEN YOU CAN'T BREATHE FIRE?

350
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:39,791
- Natsu: A DRAGON THAT
CAN'T BREATHE FIRE? WHOA.

351
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:41,500
- Happy: JUST A BIG,
UGLY LIZARD, HUH?
