1
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:35,541
It's you.

2
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,583
You're that Black Wizard.

3
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:40,583
Wait. What the hell are
you doing with Mavis?

4
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:41,625
What's going on?

5
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,458
Is she okay?
Where did you find her?

6
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:47,208
No one has seen or heard
from her for a year now.

7
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,000
We've all been sick with worry.

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,583
[ZEREF] Tell me, are you
the only person here?

9
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:53,208
Now? Yes.

10
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:55,958
Everyone's getting ready
for the harvest festival.

11
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,541
Due to Mavis' absence,

12
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:00,583
I've been obliged to serve as
Fairy Tail's temporary Master.

13
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,083
[ZEREF]
Master?

14
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh, right. I'd completely
forgotten this was a guild.

15
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:11,083
I have come here to
return Mavis to you.

16
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,416
Hey! What the--?!

17
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,958
You can't throw her
around like that!

18
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:20,625
She's not a doll, you know!

19
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:26,208
Don't worry. Nothing
can hurt her anymore.

20
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,458
[PRECHT]
Hey! Mavis!

21
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:04,541
Are you okay? Answer me!
What happened to you?

22
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,666
It's like she's
in a deep sleep.

23
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,333
Yes. And she will
never wake from it.

24
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:11,750
[gasps]

25

[ZEREF]
Sweet dreams. Mavis.

26
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:21,125
Who are you? What's your name?

27
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,458
[ZEREF]
Zeref.

28

[gasps]

29
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:29,791
[ZEREF] In essence, Mavis was
a fairy, but I am a spriggan.

30
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:33,083
A being most grotesque
and monstrous.

31
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,208
[ZEREF]
I'm so exhausted.

32
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,750
These feelings have
left me drained.

33
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,583
All I want is numb seclusion.

34
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,041
I know.

35
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:51,916
I'll go back to Alakitasia and
play my game some more.

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,708
There's no one I care about
on that entire continent.

37
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,750
[ZEREF] Trying to love
someone was a mistake.

38
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,041
It was wrong.

39
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:06,750
I must harden my
heart once again.

40
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:10,000
[gasps] Zeref? No.

41
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:14,041
He's the legendary Black
Wizard? That can't be.

42
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,083
[PRECHT]
Mavis, please, open your eyes.

43
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,791
What in the hell
is wrong with you?

44
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:26,166
Is it true? Is she dead?

45
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,458
[PRECHT] Strange.
I can't sense a heartbeat.

46
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:33,875
She's not alive,

47
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:37,375
but there is a residual
magic power inside her.

48
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,833
I must resuscitate her at once.

49
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,208
As I recall, there's
a revival lacrima

50
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,916
in a chamber beneath
the guild hall.

51
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,833
[MAVIS]
And so,

52
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:55,416
that's how my body ended
up inside the lacrima.

53
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,916
And why it remains there today.

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,916
Precht worked tirelessly,

55
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,958
trying every resurrection
spell he could find,

56
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:07,916
but not a single one could
bring me back to life.

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
One day, because of his
vast knowledge of magic,

58
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,916
he finally realized
what had happened.

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,375
I had been stricken by
the Curse of Ankhselam.

60
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,750
[PRECHT]
Oh, god.

61
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,708
Was this curse what
caused Rita's death?

62
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,208
[PRECHT] No. I can't let
anybody else find out.

63
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,833
The guild would not survive.

64
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,708
[MAVIS]
He kept his word.

65
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,500
No one would know
the truth about me.

66
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:43,583
[MAVIS]
In 697, Precht made up his mind.

67
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:47,625
He decided to tell the guild
that I'd passed away.

68
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:51,458
A shrine over an empty grave
was erected on Tenrou Island,

69
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:54,750
which was declared
our sacred land.

70
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,666
That is where I was born.

71
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,166
And where I met my fellow
founders of the guild:

72
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,958
Precht, Warrod, and Yuri.

73
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,166
[MAVIS]
That same year,

74
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,125
Precht became Fairy
Tail's second master.

75
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,958
He was acting in accordance
to the wish I had made known

76
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,541
in the time before
my disappearance.

77
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,375
He devoted all his time not
spent performing his duties

78
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,500
as guild master in solitude,

79
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,833
working without
rest to revive me.

80
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:25,458
In the year 700, Makarov's
father, Yuri Dreyer,

81
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,458
died prematurely,

82
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,625
never knowing the true
cause of his wife's death.

83
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,958
Precht continued his
attempts to resurrect me

84
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,958
for the next 30 years.

85
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,375
Though not successful,

86
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:39,541
the results yielded something
rather unexpected.

87
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:43,125
As I'd said, he had vast
knowledge about magic

88
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,916
and exhausted his resources
to bring me back,

89
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,458
but I remained in suspended
animation inside the lacrima,

90
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:52,416
unable to age or truly die.

91
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,166
In an unforeseen
convergence of factors,

92
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,875
an inexplicable form
of magic was created.

93
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,000
[MAVIS] It was something
that would rock

94
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,958
the wizarding world
to its very core.

95
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:13,375
Eternal magic...
called Fairy Heart.

96
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:17,291
[BOTH gasp]

97
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:21,208
I don't understand. What is it?

98
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,500
Yes, please. Elaborate.

99
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,958
An everlasting source of magic.

100
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,500
Simply put,

101
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,916
the power that springs from
Fairy Heart will never dry up.

102
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,333
Are you serious?

103
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:35,708
Like magic you can keep
using forever and ever?

104
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,208
[MAVIS]
Consider the weapon developed

105
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:41,041
by the old Magic Council,
the Etherion Cannon.

106
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,708
It was powerful enough to
wipe out an entire country

107
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,000
with one blast.

108
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,333
The Fairy Heart contains
enough magic energy

109
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:52,250
to fire an infinite number
of Etherion blasts.

110
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:55,208
Or perhaps, "contains" is
not the right word for it.

111
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:59,000
It can "generate" that
kind of magic energy.

112
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,708
Enough to wipe out
all countries.

113
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,291
I understand why we'd
wanna keep this a secret.

114
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,708
News like this would definitely
throw the wizarding world

115
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,291
into total chaos.

116
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:11,416
Ivan tried to get his hands
on it some years ago.

117
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,291
It seems word of its existence

118
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,125
has reached the shores
of Alvarez as well.

119
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,125
Which means they're
gonna launch an invasion

120
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,875
to try to take control of
the power it can generate.

121
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,875
But why would they go
through the trouble?

122
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:26,083
Aren't they already swimming
in magic power over there?

123
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,583
Well, my theory is that they
wanna use it as a weapon

124
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,916
in the fight against Acnologia.

125
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,125
Even Zeref considers him to
be too evil for this world.

126
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,958
Is he really that strong?

127
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,458
I mean, I know he's
like a force of nature,

128
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:39,833
but that's insane.

129
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,833
It's so scary.

130
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,708
[grunts]

131
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,125
Wait a sec.

132
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,625
This might seem like a stupid
question to you guys,

133
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,625
but if we have something
that's this powerful,

134
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,000
what's stopping us from
usin' it on both of them?

135
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:55,291
Boom! Yeah! Take that,
you baddies! Boom!

136
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:58,083
I suppose that question
needs to be asked.

137
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:01,333
I must admit, I did consider
using it to stop the Faces

138
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,125
in the battle with Tartaros.

139
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,958
Although we would've clinched
a short-term victory,

140
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,250
there was no telling what
the long-lasting effects

141
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,750
might've been.

142
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,041
For example,

143
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,083
what if we'd lost control
of the Etherion

144
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,416
and it rained down
limitless destruction?

145
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,708
[screams]

146
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,708
Jeez, sorry for asking.

147
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,666
Remember, you can't
counteract a poison

148
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,500
with another poison, Happy.

149
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:27,791
Be careful. I'm not sure she
enjoys being called a poison.

150
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:31,208
No matter what we're up against,
Fairy Heart must remain secret.

151
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,166
The world just
isn't ready for it.

152
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,458
[MEMBER A] Yeah! There's
no way we'd give that up!

[MEMBER C]
It's your body!

We're gonna protect you with
everything in our power!

155
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,583
[gasps]

156
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,500
I never dreamed my sin
would cause all this.

157
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,666
I dragged my beloved Fairy Tail

158
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,708
into a mess that could
end us for good.

[GAJEEL]
What "sin"?

160
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,250
Huh?

161
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,250
Because opening up your
heart to love someone

162
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,500
isn't actually a sin in my book.

163
00:09:56,583 --> 00:10:01,500
And if it was illegal...
I wouldn't arrest ya.

164
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,000
[chuckles]

165
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,583
Stop with the blank
stares, would ya?!

166
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,000
He's right.

167
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,541
And you mustn't blame
yourself for what's happened.

168

[gasps]

169
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,166
It's unfortunate,

170
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,041
but it's obviously not
what you had intended.

171
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:23,458
Because of you, Fairy Tail is
a force for good in the world.

172
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,958
And no Fairy Tail...

173
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,166
...would mean that we wouldn't
all be friends today.

174
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,291
I'd be sad!

175
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,916
You made this happen.

176
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,041
Your love for people is what
brought us all together.

177
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,125
And we're willing to
do whatever it takes

178
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,208
to protect the guild
you created,

179
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,666
because we believe in it.

180
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,583
Your guild's grown into a thing
of beauty, First Master.

181
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,000
[GRAY]
Ah!

182
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,000
It's hard to imagine something
so tragic and painful

183
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:58,208
as being forced to fight the
person you once madly loved.

184
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,125
The feelings I had for him
are long in the past.

185
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:05,416
Zeref is a threat. To Ishgar
and all of humanity.

186
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,750
He must be defeated!

187
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,583
Not gonna lie. It'll be tough.

188
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,125
Even if we took down
Alvarez's army...

189
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:15,250
Zeref himself can't age
or die, isn't that right?

190
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,625
[MEMBER B]
Wait, he's really immortal?

191
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:18,625
[MEMBER D]
You mean, like,

192
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,458
there's nothing
that can kill him?

193
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,250
How do we defeat
somebody like that?

194
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,875
[NATSU laughing]

195
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:32,875
Just leave that part
to me, you guys!

196
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,875
I'll be the one to
take down Zeref.

197
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:40,375
Because my right arm...
is a secret weapon, too.

198
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,541
Hey, have I told you lately

199
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,708
that you're the epitome
of triple A-plus beauty?

[MARIN yelps]

I'd be even better if you
finished this pedicure.

[MARIN]
Of course, my lady!

203
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:05,250
I will put all of my care into
making these nails truly divine.

204
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,625
When I'm done, they'll
be the envy of the gods!

205
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,500
So, my lady, if it's
not asking too much,

206
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:12,916
do you think you'd be
willing to turn me

207
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,208
back to my normal size,
pretty please?

Yeah, Mary?

211
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,625
I heard you let some
troublemakers escape.

212
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,458
Surely that's not true.

213
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,833
No, I did not let them "escape."

214
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,541
I wasn't in the mood to be
dealing with them is all.

215
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,250
[MARIN] Trust me,
I tried to convince her

216
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,000
that it wasn't the best idea!

217

Oh, my. You are looking
A-plus too, my lady!

Would you turn him
back to normal?

He's like a disgusting
cockroach that can talk.

Come on! I hate being tiny!

to deal with anything?

That's what he's for, right?

225
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,375
Anyway, the Spriggan Twelve
have been summoned.

226

this "secret weapon."

That's why it's a secret weapon!

Just tell us what it is,
you pink-haired punk!

it's something super special.

what the "secret
weapon" really is?

I don't know!

Well, I don't know
why you feel the need

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,208
to be so showy about it

250
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,958
when it's not even your
own secret to be hiding.

251
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:50,541
All I can say is that it's
a one-time-use technique.

252
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:55,166
With this, I'll be able to take
down ol' Zeref once and for all.

doesn't he?

Yes, indeed.

in my time there.

At the top sits
Emperor Spriggan.

279
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,583
Here in Ishgar, he's more
commonly referred to

280
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,875
as the legendary
"Black Wizard Zeref."

And beneath him are
powerful wizards.

ruthless force

During the year I was
confined there,

286
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,250
I only managed to
meet six of them.

287
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,083
And because it's such
a large region,

288
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,041
it's apparently quite
rare for all of them

289
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,083
to be in the same place
at the same time.

290

Seven of you.

And his chief administrator.

302
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,166
I'm not sure, but his
nickname leads me to believe

303
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,500
that he utilizes
ice-based magic,

304
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,791

seen him in action.

would be nicer anyway.

he's one of the Twelve's
most aggressive members.

He couldn't stop us.

315
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,583
[ZEREF] As I'm sure
you've likely surmised,

316
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:28,208
I've convened this meeting
to discuss preparations

317
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,125
for our invasion of Ishgar.

318
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,833
What a hassle.

319
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:35,166
Now, now, you really shouldn't
say such things, Brandish.

320
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,000
Don't forget, you did agree
to follow my orders.

321
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,375
Yes, of course.


322
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:42,166
I didn't actually say
I wasn't going to do it.


323
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,750
Just that it sounded like a
massive pain in the neck to me.


324
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,250
[MAKAROV] Brandish,
the Nation Destroyer.

325
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,750
Though not much of a hawk,

326
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,666
she does wield
enough magic power

327
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,333
to wipe countries off the map.

328
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,500
[ERZA] We have encountered her
before, on Caracol Island.

329
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,166
She's a force to
be reckoned with.

330
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,291
From what I could tell,

331
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,916
her magic can alter
an object's mass.

332
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,166
You know, Randi,

333
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,666
the fact that you say
whatever's on your mind

334
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,250
is why everyone hates you.

335
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,708
Yeah, so what?

336
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:10,958
I don't really give a damn

337
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,250
because the truth is,
I actually hate them.

338
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,666
I see.


339
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,333
Then I guess it's no wonder
we get along so well.


340
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,666
[MAKAROV]
Dimaria, the Warrior Queen.


341
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,750
I don't know what
magic she uses,

342
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,750
but she's an extremely
skilled knight

343
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,875
who's touted as a goddess
of the battlefield.

344
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,833
So she's a wizard and a knight?

345
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,833
Sounds kinda familiar,
doesn't it?

346
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,833
Tell us, God Serena,

347
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,791
will destroying your
homeland cause you pain?

348
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,583
Painful?

349
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,583
No!

350
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,791
Jackass.

351
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,916
But thank you.


352
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,250
[MAKAROV] God Serena,
the top-ranked ex-member


353
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,458
of the Ten Wizard Saints.

354
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,583
He's a profound disappointment
to our country,

355
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,000
and impossible to like,

356
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,583
but I've had the
chance to witness

357
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,041
his extraordinary magic
power firsthand.

358
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,208
I still can't even wrap
my head around the fact

359
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,791
that the highest-ranked
Wizard Saint

360
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,666
is working with the enemy now.

361
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,375
I wonder why he decided
to desert Ishgar.

362
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,041
Honestly, I highly doubt that
there's any way to know for sure

363
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,666
without asking him personally.

364
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,708
I'll make sure to do that...
when I arrest him.

365
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:36,375
Your Majesty, there's
no doubt in my mind


366
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,000
that we are prepared
to go to battle


367
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,958
in this final war of Ragnarok.


368
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,458
[MAKAROV]
August, the Wizard King.

369
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,625
Be especially wary of him.

370
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,500
Although I don't know much
about him personally,

371
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,083
his magic power is rumored

372
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,500
to be without equal
among the Twelve.

373
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,625
He's on a completely
different level.

374
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,625
[MAKAROV]
If what I've heard is true,

375
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,666
he's mastered all
manner of magic

376
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,833
from every corner of the world.

377
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,166
It has been said that
he might even wield

378
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:11,208
more types of magic
than Zeref himself.

379
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:17,458
[gasps]

380
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,208
That's all the information
I have on those six.

381
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:23,291
As far as the others, I only
have the names of three.

382
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,583
They're...

383
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:27,000
...Bloodman...

384
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,833
...Neinhart...

385
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,000
...and the last one is Wall.


386
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,416
As I understand it,


387
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,250
our target is the body of
your former love interest.


388
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:38,500
It's all very scandalous
and sinful indeed.

389
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,333
[ZEREF]
Then you misunderstand.

390
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:44,250
The Fairy Heart is a form
of magic, not a person.

391
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:48,166
Additionally, that is not
our mission's only goal.

392
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,166
We will also wipe out Ishgar.

393
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,541
Humanity must be
exterminated without fail.

394
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,583
Humanity? Well.

395
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:00,083
We are but pieces in this game.

396
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,208
A fascinating
interpretation indeed.

397
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,500
[BRANDISH]
Hm.

398
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,208
Yes, good.

399
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:11,000
On that note, let's
plan our strategy.

400
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,750
[AJEEL]
Hm. I got it!

401
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,416
You should let me
do it all by myself!

402
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,833
We'll need to formulate
our strategy.

403
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,500
Everybody, pay close attention.

404
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:24,416
I'm sorry. But I simply
cannot allow that.

405
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,250
This will be a
full-scale assault.

406
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,541
Zeref will invade Ishgar
with his entire army.

407
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:34,000
Come on! I can handle the
whole thing on my own!

408
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,250
If the strongest guy
there was God Serena,

409
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,208
then that means
I'll have no problem

410
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,500
taking on the whole
continent alone!

411
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:41,833
[YAJEEL]
Hmm...

412
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,791
[ZEREF] I agree with what
you're saying, Ajeel.

413
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:47,166
But still, I like the message
an all-out attack sends.

414
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,083
There's not a shred
of ambiguity.

415
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,833
[MAVIS]
I won't sugar coat it.

416
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:55,166
There's no question we are at
an overwhelming disadvantage.

417
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,166
Our enemy is greater in number

418
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,375
and far more powerful than
any we've faced before.

419
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,750
[ZEREF]
The Dragon King Festival begins.

420
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,083
Let the invasion commence.

421
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:09,958
But due to our courage and
our bond, we will prevail.

422
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,208
Let's show them what
our guild is made of!

[FAIRY TAIL cheering]

My arm is aching.

00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:31,916
The same one that was devoured
by the Flame Dragon.

427
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,083
This is my time.

428
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:40,583
The Dragon King Festival
will soon begin.

of making it through
the stressful night

435
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:44,208
before the battle for
our future begins.

436
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:47,333
And things quickly get intense
when Alvarez's massive army

comes shooting through
the sky towards Fiore!

Humanity is counting
on us to fend them off.

As the town of Magnolia
comes under attack,

our guild's strong
bonds of solidarity

Next Time: "The Magnolia

Waves of threats and
despair come crashing in,

but we won't fall!
