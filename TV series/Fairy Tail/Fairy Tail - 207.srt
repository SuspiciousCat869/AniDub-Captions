1
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,583
[HISUI] This is a bustling
little town, isn't it?

2
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:27,041
[ARCADIOS] The port brings in
trade from the sea, pumpkin.

3
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:32,125
[HISUI] Say, is it just me
or is everyone staring at us?

4
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,125
It's just as I explained before.

5
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:37,166
This headgear will conceal
you perfectly, but only if worn

6
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,333
with all the pride and dignity
befitting a pumpkin-king.

7
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,625
[HISUI] That may be true.
But until I learn to channel

8
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:45,833
my father's weirdness,
I'd like to stick with a hood.

9
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:48,041
[HISUI]
Look at this food!

10
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,791
Ice cream, Popcorn.

11
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,833
Hot dogs? They
don't have anything

12
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,708
near this tasty looking
back at the palace!

13
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:55,958
[HISUI squeals]

14
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,500
Princess!

15
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,583
[HISUI sighs]
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:02,791
I know that we have work to do,
but it all looks so good.

17
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,333
[ARCADIOS]
You must channel the pumpkin!

18
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:05,791
[HISUI]
You can't be serious.

19
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:07,625
[NATSU]
Hey! Pumpkins!

20
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,333
I thought I smelled
something familiar,

21
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:10,875
but I wasn't
expecting to see you.

22
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:12,666
[HAPPY]
Rockin' the dress, Mato!

23
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,291
That your big brother or what?

24
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,375
[LUCY] Hey Wait, isn't
Mato secretly the king?

25
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,208
[YUKINO]
Then Which one should we bow to?

26
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:19,458
[LEVY]
Don't ask that!

27
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:20,958
He brought a double
to throw off assassins.

28
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:23,625
If we bow, we might
give him away!

29
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,375
[HISUI]
No, you've got it all wrong!

30
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:27,041
[ARCADIOS]
It's only us, okay?

31
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,458
Princess Hisui?

32
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:31,333
Colonel Arcadios.
Why're you here?

33
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,375
[HISUI] Good to see you.
It's been too long.

34
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,375
[NATSU] Haven't seen you
since I stole the king's--

35
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,916
[HAPPY]
What's new?

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,333
[LUCY] You're a long way
from home right now. What's up?

37
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,875
I was about to ask
you just that.

38
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,958
We're on our way to
Fairy Tail's guildhall.

39
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,875
that is, we were until
we found you here.

40
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,708
So what brings you out this far,
some kind of guild business?

41
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,958
Honestly, it's a longer story
than we got time to tell.

42
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:27,166
Actually, I'd like to
get your take on this.

43
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,875
[LUCY] Natsu, Happy and I were
on a job when I discovered

44
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,166
my Zodiac keys had
become unusable.

45
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,416
It turned out that the
job we took was faked by

46
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,625
the same spirits I was
trying to summon.

47
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,666
But they'd all changed: they'd
forgotten their time with me

48
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,458
and said our
contracts were void.

49
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,375
We've done some
research since then,

50
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,625
and we found out they're
planning to hold an old ritual

51
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,791
called the Liberam, in a place
called the Astral Spiritus.

52
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,000
This ritual is supposed to
grant them "complete freedom."

53
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,541
What I don't think they
realize is that this

54
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,833
so-called freedom
comes with a price.

55
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:58,541
If they go through with it,
then after just 12 days.

56
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,750
All of them will die.

57
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,541
[YUKINO]
So that's why we're out here.

58
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,750
We've been searching
for Astral Spiritus.

59
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,750
And from what we've read,
it should be somewhere

60
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,666
to the south of Magnolia.

61
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,208
How tragic.

62
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,375
We're aware there have been
changes in the celestial world

63
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,750
from our own research.

64
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,916
But to think that the
spirits took action so soon.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,291
The truth is,

66
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,208
these major changes in
your spirit's personalities.

67
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,333
They're a result of my mistakes.

68
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,416
[ALL gasp]

69
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,708
[LUCY]
No way, this isn't your fault.

70
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,166
The Eclipse Project.

71
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,875
That's what warped
your spirits' minds.

72
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,625
But how could that be?

73
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,000
I Thought it was destroyed

74
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,416
It was. I threw a
frigging dragon at it.

75
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,583
Correct. It was destroyed but...

76
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,666
[HISUI]
By then, the damage was done.

77
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,791
You mean, to the spirits?

78
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,625
Yes.

79
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,666
[ARCADIOS] You wizards cleaned
up the worst of the mess

80
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,875
that our Eclipse Project
created by destroying it.

81
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,333
This sent the dragons we'd
accidentally brought forth

82
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,166
back to their own time.

83
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,416
[ARCADIOS] But activating a
dark artifact of that caliber

84
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,458
had an effect on nature itself.

85
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,875
Eclipse is the cause
of the unusual weather

86
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:16,333
that we've all borne witness to.

87
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,708
[LEVY] So are you saying that
Eclipse caused all of that

88
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:22,833
devastation as a side-effect
of being activated? Crazy.

89
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:26,125
Yes, And that only covers part
of the trouble it's caused us.

90
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,250
We believe that the
aftershock of the Eclipse's

91
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:31,916
activation has crossed over
into the celestial world.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,666
It's really that powerful?

93
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,041
So powerful, our celestial
spirits forgot all about us?

94
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,750
[HAPPY]
Hisui Rises!

95
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,125
[HISUI] The Eclipse Project
pushed the world

96
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,875
to the brink of destruction.

97
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:53,083
And I was the one
that opened the gate.

98
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:56,000
That alone, was
completely unforgivable.

99
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:59,250
But now I've harmed
the celestial world too.

100
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,416
Because of me,
your spirits could die.

101
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,291
[LUCY]
Princess Hisui...

102
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,416
[NATSU] You came all this
way to say sorry for that?

103
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,208
You were trying to help, right?

104
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,625
There's no crime in
making an honest mistake.

105
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,250
So stop feeling guilty!

106
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:19,583
Yeah! Nobody's mad at you.
it was an accident!

107
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:23,625
Thanks. After the
games, I was sad.

108
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:24,916
Depressed rather.

109
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,916
The weight of responsibility
for all the pain

110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,458
I'd caused was too much to take.

111
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,291
But then something Natsu
once said came back to me.

112
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,958
Snapped me out of it.

113
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,583
So what did he say?

114
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,833
You sure it was me?

115
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,291
Yes.

116
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,958
[NATSU] I'm gonna keep
fighting to live today!

117
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,708
Those words...

118
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,875
They gave me the strength
to keep on moving forward.

119
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,125
And what's more.

120
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,208
They were fresh in my
mind when I learned that

121
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,916
the celestial world had
been harmed as well.

122
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,583
What you said kept me strong.
I could've sulked or cried,

123
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:02,666
but instead I made special
keys to fight for today!

124
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,166
What keys?

125
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,166
How do they work?

126
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,625
[HISUI] These keys are
capable of forcibly closing

127
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,416
a Zodiac Spirit's gate.

128
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,416
You can do that with these?

129
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,291
Awesome! If we use these keys,

130
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,708
then we can send the spirits
back to the celestial world

131
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,291
without having to fight!

132
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,333
[LUCY] This way, we save their
lives without hurting them!

133
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,125
If they can't reach
Astral Spiritus,

134
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,250
then they won't be able
to do their ritual.

135
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,833
That's right. If it's
part of our world,

136
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,208
you could keep them
from it indefinitely.

137
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,500
[LUCY laughs]

138
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:36,833
Cool, we're saved!

139
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:40,125
I'm confused though.
No offense to the princess,

140
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:43,083
but this sounds like it
entails highly advanced magic.

141
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,958
How could a non-wizard
make those keys?

142
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,541
Yeah, fair question.

143
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,458
Forcing a gate to shut is
pretty difficult in itself.

144
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:52,000
But making keys
that do it for you?

145
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,083
Well you see.

146
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,666
I'm actually a
celestial wizard myself.

147
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,208
[ALL gasp]

148
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,458
[LEVY] Come to think of it,
she must've used the zodiac keys

149
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,958
to open the Eclipse Gate
in the first place.

150
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,000
[LUCY] To do something like
that, I guess she would

151
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,583
have to be a celestial
wizard, wouldn't she?

152
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,291
[YUKINO] I suppose we
should've realized sooner.

153
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,958
[HISUI] There is one
thing that prevents us

154
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,500
from using the keys just yet.

155
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,500
[HISUI]
First, we'll have to--

156
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:19,083

Would you just drop the whole

That looked painful.

315
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,541
[NATSU] Nah. I'm fine.
He just caught me off guard

316
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,333
with all that nonsense
he's been talkin'.

317
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,833
That was my best attack.
If you survived it I'm done!

318
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,833
Cool if I just toss
you these keys?

There's no telling where
she'll attack us from next.

how to use them

00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,083
I got this, guys, get back!

472
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,500
[PISCES MOM giggling]

473
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:57,250
[PISCES BOY laughs] Don't worry,
my mom's not angry at all!

474
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,958
Fire Dragon...

475
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,958
Mommy...

476
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,875
Roar!

477
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,458
Roar!

478
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,833
You stinker!

479
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,708
I think the only thing
that'll change your attitude

480
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,541
is a Shark Skin Body Press!

481
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:19,583
[ALL gasp, scream]

482
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,666
[PISCES BOY]
Got it!

483
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,708
[LEVY]
Oh no!

484
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,458
[HAPPY]
He stole 'em all over again!

485
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,250
I'm sick of that jerk!

486
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,000
Since you asked us to,
we'll take these off your hands.

487
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,000
Cool? Cool!

488
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,916
[PISCES MOM]
Take care!

489
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,958
[LUCY]
Sorry, Princess.

490
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,500
[HISUI] It's fine,
I won't let this stop us.

491
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,666
I've made those
keys once before.

492
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,541
The second time should be easy.

493
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,208
[ARCADIOS]
I admire your spirit, Princess.

494
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,708
[HISUI] You fought
bravely, sir. How are you?

495
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,833
Well, I emerged from
the fight unharmed.

496
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,625
I do, however, owe
you a sincere apology.

497
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:58,958
An apology for what?

498
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:02,625
[ARCADIOS] I realize that it was
presumptuous of me to do so.

499
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,833
But I thought that something
like this might happen,

500
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,500
so I switched out your
keys with fake ones.

501
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:08,416
Huh?

502
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,375
[ALL gasp]

503
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:14,958
[HAPPY]
Wow.

504
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,250
So they didn't swipe
the real keys after all!

505
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,291
[NATSU]
You're a wily old guy!

506
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,916
[LUCY] Since we have the closure
keys, we just need to figure out

507
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,458
where Astral Spiritus is.

508
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:25,916
Then we can stop
the Liberam ritual!

509
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,166
Which reminds me,
there was another reason why

510
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,291
we were on our way
to Fairy Tail earlier.

511
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:32,875
We know where the
Astral Spiritus is.

512
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:35,291
For real? Well that
makes thing easy, huh?

513
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:36,666
Yes.

514
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,958
Let's move!

515
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:40,208
Those spirits ain't gonna
beat themselves up!

516
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:41,833
[HAPPY]
Aye, Sir!

517
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,500
[HAPPY] Whoa! I can't
see a thing in all this fog!

518
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,375
But it seems like Astral
Spiritus is gettin' close!

519
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,250
[NATSU]
'Bout time! Let's do this!

520
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,916
[HAPPY] Right! We gotta
stop the Liberam ritual!

521
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
[NATSU] Yeah, there's no way
we're gonna let our friends

522
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,666
die in 12 frickin' days!

523
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,166
[HAPPY]
That'd be sad for everyone,

524
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,958
but it might break Lucy's heart!

525
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:33,708
[NATSU] Exactly! That's why
I say screw their stupid wish!

526
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:36,166
[NATSU, HAPPY]
Next Time: Astral Spiritus

527
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,458
[NATSU] I said I'd beat
'em to their senses, Happy.

528
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:40,041
And when at first
you don't succeed.

529
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:41,208
[HAPPY]
Punch harder!
