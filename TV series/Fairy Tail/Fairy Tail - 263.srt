1
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,625
Now it's time for you to freeze!

2
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,000
Right after you burn!

3
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,750
[NARRATOR] Natsu and
Gray fight together

4
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,291
against Mard Geer Tartaros,

5
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:37,125
who has finally taken
on his Etherious form.

6
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,791
Sting and Rogue fought
an equally intense battle

7
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:42,250
against their former
guild master, Jiemma.

8
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,416
Who had been reborn as a demon.

9
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,333
[ROGUE, STING]
White Shadow Dragon Silk!

10
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,958
[JIEMMA groaning]

11
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,125
It's impossible!

12
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:57,750
How?!

13
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:05,250
[NARRATOR] Their struggle
was great, but in the end,

14
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:08,541
Sting and Rogue did
manage to fell Jiemma.

15
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:11,500
However, that finishing blow
was the last they'd strike.

16
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,291
The twin dragons collapsed,

17
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:16,583
putting their faith in
the Fairy Tail wizards

18
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:18,916
[ROGUE]
Natsu.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,541
Gray.

20
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:23,291
[STING]
It's all... up to you now.

21
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:27,458
[NARRATOR] The team of fire and
ice redoubled their efforts,

22
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:29,291
assaulting Mard Geer Tartaros

23
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:31,541
with every ounce of
strength they had.

24
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,875
[NATSU yells]

25
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:35,458
[GRAY yells]

26
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:41,291
[NATSU yelling]

27
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,833
[GRAY yelling]

28
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,875
[MARD GEER] Prepare
yourselves for purgatory.

29
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,500
For I will invoke
the ultimate curse,

30
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:57,000
designed to destroy
Zeref himself!

31
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,916
[NATSU screams]

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,083
[GRAY groaning]

33
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,250
[MARD GEER]
The memory of death.

34
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,000
[NARRATOR]
All else having failed him,

35
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:09,541
Mard Geer resorted to
his most powerful curse.

36
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:14,375
One he'd planned to use
only on the Dark Lord Zeref.

37
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,166
[MARD GEER] Those afflicted
by the Memento Mori

38
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,541
no longer belong with the
living or with the dead.

39
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,583
They simply cease to exist.

40
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:30,625
[MARD GEER] You are now, and
forever will be... nothing.

41
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,208
The moment has arrived.

42
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:42,458
The ultimate curse has finally
been perfected and invoked.

43
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:46,375
Once E.N.D. has been revived,
I will fulfill my promise.

44
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,375
And then...

45
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:52,000
you will be destroyed,
Lord Zeref.

46
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:43,625
[MARD GEER] I've found you
worthy of my greatest curse.

47
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,000
Consider it an honor.

48
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,416
[gasps]

49
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,500
[MARD GEER gasping]

50
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,875
Your skin.

51
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:22,958
This can't be.

52
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,666
No.

53
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,250
[GRAY growling]

54
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:31,291
[MARD GEER] He's morphed
into a half-demon.

55
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,916
Is this Silver's power?

56
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,166
Did that traitorous corpse

57
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,625
somehow manage to counter
my ultimate curse?

58
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:41,166
[GRAY grunts]
Uh... Hey Natsu.

59
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,250
I know I... talk crap...

60
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,250
[NATSU gasps]

61
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,875
[GRAY]
But I've got faith in you.

62
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,958
I always have.

63
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,208
[GRAY]
If anyone can beat him,

64
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,625
it's you.

65
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,083
Hang in there.

66
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,583
[ICHIYA]
Man.

67
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:51,916
Status report.

68
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,416
There's no room for error
on a night like this.

69
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,541
Well said, boss.

70
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,458
We're on course for
the nearest Faces.

71
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,083
As for the message
from Fairy Tail,

72
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,041
I have it on a temporary file.

73
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,208
So what now?

74
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,541
We await your orders, sir.

75
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:04,833
The message.

76
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,291
Let's retransmit it.

77
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,083
Use the communication lacrima.

78
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,833
Make sure it's received
by every guild in Fiore.

79
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,041
Great idea, sir!

80
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,000
We'll need all
the help we can get.

81
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,791
[ICHIYA] At the end of
Fairy Tail's message,

82
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,166
I'd like you to
add the following:

83
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,958
"The fate of the continent
rests on this battle."

84
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,375
Gird your loins.

85
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:26,708
As Blue Pegasus' vanguard,
we must crush these Faces!

86
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,750
[GUILD MEMBERS]
Aye aye, Captain!

87
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,750
Where did those things come
from, and what are they?

88
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,000
Were they underground?

89
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,250
[MAN B]
All I know is they're creepy.

90
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,666
Can't be good.

91
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,458
I'm guessing those
big, white towers

92
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,333
are the Faces from that message.

93
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:50,416
Do you really think that they
can wipe out all magic?

94
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,333
Time is too short for us
to muse on the subject.

95
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:56,041
We must destroy them
without hesitation.

96
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,208
[MILLIANNA] Yeah, but
where do we even start?

97
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,666
There are so many of them,
and they're gigantic.

98
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,416
[KAGURA] First we put our
doubts aside, then we act!

99
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,666
[MILLIANNA]
Right.

100
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,333
Let's begin!

101
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,875
[OHBA] At least the citizens'll
be out of our way.

102
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,083
They've evacuated.

103
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,708
[LYON] A rather grotesque
sight, isn't it?

104
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,333
How the heck am I
supposed to take down

105
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,291
these ginormous
things all by myself?!

106
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,750
Now calm down and think.

107
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,333
If you're meant to do this
alone, then why are we here?

108
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,958
And stop your complaining
about how damn big they are.

109
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,458
Before I spin ya.

110
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:30,875
They aren't so big.

111
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,916
Allow me to show you.

112
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,208
[JURA]
Wait, Lyon!

113
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,250
[LYON]
Mm?

114
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,875
According to Sir
Ichiya's broadcast,

115
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,583
these things number
in the thousands.

116
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,416
We can't afford to take
them down one at a time.

117
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,833
We must act together.

118
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,083
Yes, sir.

119
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,958
Upon my name as a Wizard
Saint, I swear to you,

120
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,708
I will not allow magic to
be torn from this world.

121
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,958
Now, with our
strengths combined!

122
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,416
Hold nothing back.

123
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,791
Give it everything you've got!

124
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,500
I've got a hard
Drilling Rock For Ya!

125
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:08,083
And while we're at it,

[cries]

127
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,208
In a world without magic,

128
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,000
I won't be able to drink
half as much as I like to.

I'm really gonna need
a drink after all this.

Yes, naturally.

00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,916
Does this mean...
they're destroyed?

325
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,333
Metalicana's back.

326
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:59,333
[METALICANA roars]

327
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,083
I know Weisslogia's dead,

328
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,750
but somehow I'm picking
up on his energy.

329
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,125
And I can feel Skiadrum as well.

330
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:09,708
[IGNEEL]
My kindred are free at last.

331
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:16,875
[IGNEEL] We soar through the
skies of Ishgar once again!

332
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:22,375
[IGNEEL roars]

333
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,333
[WENDY]
It's a miracle!

334
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:25,250
[LISANNA, LUCY gasp]

335
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:26,666
[MARD GEER whimpers]

336
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:28,791
[GAJEEL]
Ha, ha.

337
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:30,458
[MAKAROV]
Mm...

338
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:31,708
[HAPPY]
Ha, ha!

339
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:36,708
[IGNEEL roars]

340
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,666
Incredible.

341
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:14,875
[LUCY]
After mysteriously reappearing,

342
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:18,333
the dragons made short work
of thousands of Faces.

343
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,583
Fairy Tail and our allies

344
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,958
rejoice in our victory
over Tartaros.

345
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:25,041
However, not every foe
has been eliminated.

346
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:26,625
Our excitement
proves short lived

347
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:29,208
when we're confronted
by the ones that remain

348
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:30,750
But as the battle wears on,

349
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:33,875
a flash of light glimmers
in the eastern sky.

350
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:37,750
Next Time: "Tartaros
Chapter Drops of Fire."

351
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:40,750
Finally, the true end arrives.
