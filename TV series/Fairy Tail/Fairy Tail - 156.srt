00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,916
[MATO] 
Let the Grand Magic Games'

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,291
preliminary round,
Sky Labyrinth begin!

3
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,833
[GRAY] Well, if it's a race
then we better get moving.

4
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:27,666
[NATSU] Let's go!

5
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,916
No, wait!

6
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:30,500
[NATSU] What's the problem?

7
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,333
[ERZA] The rules state
that all five members

8
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:33,250
must reach the goal.

9
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,541
So we can't leave without Wendy.

10
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:36,375
[LUCY] You're right!

11
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:37,958
Wendy!

12
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,041
Crap! What're we
gonna do now?

13
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,333
[ELFMAN] Why wait
for a little girl,

14
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:45,291
when you've got a
man who's ready to go?

15
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:52,000
♪

16
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:21,125
We've got a roster change!

17
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,458
He's so much stronger now!

18
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,041
What're you doing, bro?

19
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,000
[GRAY] He's doin' what
needs to be done!

20
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,583
We don't have time to wait
around for Wendy to show up!

21
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,041
[NATSU] Elfman to the rescue!

22
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,333
You guys just
leave it to me!

23
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,958
[ERZA] Lisanna!
Happy!

24
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:35,875
[HAPPY] Aye?

25
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,833
[LISANNA] Yeah?
What is it?

26
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,375
[ERZA] I need you two to go
look for Wendy and Carla!

27
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:41,958
I'm really worried
that they might've run

28
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,833
into some kind of trouble.

29
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,291
Okay!

30
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,583
We'll go ask around town and
see what we can find out!

31
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:48,416
Aye, sir!

32
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Good luck to ya!

33
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,333
[HAPPY]
Go team!

34
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,000
[ELFMAN] Manly!

35
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,500
[GRAY] We're getting
close to the entrance!

36
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:04,541
[NATSU] Our first step to
bein' number one in Fiore!

37
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,583
We're takin' that title!
Right, Team Fairy Tail?

38
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:08,958
[ALL] Oh yeah!

39
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,291
[HAPPY] Sky Labyrinth!

40
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,125
[NARRATOR] Here's a quick
reminder of the rules of the

41
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,750
preliminary round
to refresh your memory.

42
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,666
[NARRATOR] There are one
hundred and thirteen teams

43
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,750
participating in this
year's Grand Magic Games.

44
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,708
[NARRATOR] The purpose
of the preliminary round is to

45
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,500
narrow down the number
of participating teams.

46
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:34,291
Only eight will be allowed to
move on to the main competition.

47
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,958
[NARRATOR]
Each team must head into the

48
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,458
Sky Labyrinth from
their respective inn.

49
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,333
From there,
they have to find their way

50
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,041
to the tournament's
coliseum, Domus Flau.

51
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,208
The first eight teams
to reach the goal

52
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,916
qualify to participate
in the main events.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,833
Additionally, participants
are free to use magic

54
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,250
however they see
fit within the labyrinth.

55
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,416
There are no
restrictions whatsoever.

56
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,958
[MATO] Remember.

57
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,833
The Grand Magic Games' planning
committee is not responsible

58
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:04,291
for any loss of life that may
occur within the Sky Labyrinth!

59
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,625
Good luck, everyone!

60
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:10,166
[GRAY] Whoa, it's some kinda
crazy, three-dimensional maze.

61
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,291
[NATSU] I really
suck at stuff like this!

62
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,375
[LUCY] Don't give up already!

63
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,916
We have to finish
in the top eight.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,416
Otherwise,
we can kiss the title

65
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,541
of "number one in
Fiore" goodbye.

66
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:20,708
Yeah, you're right!

67
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,250
We gotta get through
this if we wanna get

68
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,333
the chance to kick
Sabertooth's butt!

69
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,958
Let's make sure we reach
the goal before they do.

70
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:30,041
Real men never settle for
anything less than first place!

71
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,916
When we were on the ground
the coliseum was to the east.

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,041
I think we should
head in that direction.

73
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,291
[LUCY] I've got just
the thing to help us out!

74
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,958
Open!
Gate of the Compass!

75
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,416
[LUCY] Pyxis!

76
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,375
[Pyxis emits gibberish]

77
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:47,666
We need your help, Pyxis!

78
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,208
Can you please show
us which way is east?

79
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,708
East is thataway!

80
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,708
Yes, I'm well aware.

81
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,333
Because I brought
along a regular compass.

82
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,416
[LUCY] Thanks for
the help anyway, Pyxis.

83
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,250
[Pyxis emits gibberish]

84
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,541
[NATSU] Alright, east!
Here we come!

85
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,500
[ELFMAN] A real man charges
straight towards the goal!

86
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:14,583
[LUCY] Not to be a downer.

87
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,541
But with the way
this place is laid out.

88
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,541
I don't think we're gonna
be able to go straight east.

89
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:20,958
[GRAY] We're gonna have
a hard enough time just

90
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,041
tryin' to figure
out which way is up!

91
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,750
Natsu. You're
not feeling sick?

92
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,875
Nuh-uh, you'd think
I'd be pukin' my guts out

93
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,708
but I feel just fine.

94
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,000
[MATO] Allow me to explain!

95
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,125
A special magic was cast on
the Sky Labyrinth allowing

96
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:38,708
participants with weaknesses
such as motion sickness and

97
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,291
fear of heights to be
able to compete on

98
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,791
equal terms in the
preliminary round!

99
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,208
[ERZA] I see.

100
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,833
[NATSU] Guess it's
like Troia magic.

101
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,666
I seriously doubt
the other wizards

102
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,083
get motion sickness
as easily as Natsu.

103
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,041
I know what ya mean.
He's kind of a baby.

104
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,916
Hey I can
hear ya, y'know!

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,541
[ERZA] Let's keep
heading eastward!

106
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:57,833
[ALL] Right!

107
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,208
[GRAY] What the--?

108
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,708
[ELFMAN] Whoa, I'm gettin'
dizzy just lookin' at it!

109
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:10,125
[LUCY] Yeah, I feel like
I'm gonna fall right in.

110
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,333
[ERZA] We're wasting time!

111
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:12,541
Let's go!

112
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:13,875
Real men don't hesitate;

113
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,125
they always keep
their eye on the prize!

114
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,166
[LUCY] Okay, I get it!

115
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,833
But how long is
this creepy tunnel?

116
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:19,875
Does it really matter?

117
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,750
Our goal's at the end of it!

118
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,333
[ELFMAN] Don't worry, I got ya!

119
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:28,958
Thanks man!
That was a close one!

120
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,750
You're lucky that
I caught ya in time.

121
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:31,916
We could have lost you.

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,333
When he was
talking about possible

123
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,500
"loss of life"
he wasn't bluffing.

124
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,541
[GRAY] Watch your step, cause
I don't think anybody would

125
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,583
survive fallin' headfirst
into the city from this thing.

126
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,291
[ELFMAN We gotta be
more careful about choosin'

127
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,458
our path from now on.

128
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:44,958
Guys, we're never
gonna reach the goal

129
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,125
if we keep lookin' down!

130
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,666
C'mon, we need to
keep headin' eastward!

131
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,458
[ERZA] I think it would
be prudent for us to

132
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,291
take notes as we move along.

133
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,333
[LUCY] On what?

134
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:55,625
We should write
down the path we've

135
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,291
taken from our
starting point.

136
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,458
And the locations we've passed.

137
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:00,791
We need to know
precisely where we

138
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,541
are in order to make progress.

139
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,916
That sure would help us
stop running around in circles.

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
No joke.

141
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,000
Guess we better
start mappin' stuff out.

142
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:08,833
Come on.

143
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,166
That ain't gonna work here.

144
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,208
How're we supposed
to make a

145
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,416
map of this
topsy-turvy place?

146
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,958
[GRAY] Quit whinin' and help.

147
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,916
Can't you sniff out
the goal or somethin'?

148
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,333
[NATSU] Doncha think
I woulda done that by now?

149
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,291
[LUCY] The magic they
cast on the labyrinth

150
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,375
must've dulled
your sense of smell.

151
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,416
[ERZA] The conditions are
the same for every team.

152
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,125
Let's keep moving!

153
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:30,625
[cheers]

154
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,583
What do you
mean Wendy's gone?

155
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:33,833
[NAB] Hang on.

156
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,250
Are you saying she's missing?

157
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,208
[HAPPY] We can't
find her or Carla!

158
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,041
Don't the rules say each
team's gotta have five members?

159
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,083
Don't tell me they've
been disqualified.

160
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,791
No, luckily
my brother stepped

161
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,458
in as a last-minute replacement.

162
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,458
Elfman's in the
preliminary round too?

163
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:48,708
That's not fair!

164
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,500
If I'd been there they
would've chosen me to

165
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,250
join the team not
that big dummy!

166
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,708
Uh, yeah sure.

167
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,875
Happy and I are gonna
start looking for them.

168
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,041
I need you two
to go and tell the others.

169
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,875
We'll have a better chance
of finding them if we

170
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,125
split into teams and use
Warren's telepathy.

171
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,666
[HAPPY] This city is
huge so we've got a

172
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,666
lot of ground to cover.

173
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,041
[ROMEO] Got it.
I'm worried.

174
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,916
I hope they haven't
run into any sorta trouble.

175
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,625
[NAB] Yeah, me too
but try not to dwell on it.

176
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,166
Let's hurry and get back to the
others so we can fill them in.

177
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,333
[ROMEO] Right.

178
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,583
[ERZA] East is that direction.

179
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,166
[LUCY] This maze is harder to
map out than I thought it'd be.

180
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,708
Well, whaddya expect
when everything

181
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,750
around you looks the same?

182
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,708
Hey, Erza.

183
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:27,666
[ERZA] Yes.

184
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,333
I heard it, too.

185
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:33,166
You're the one who told us
to go this way, ya little runt!

186
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,708
[KOZARU]
Don't try to blame this on me!

187
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,166
[NOPPO]
I don't care whose fault it is!

188
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,958
All I know is we've
been here before.

189
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,416
[REGENT] That's what I'm sayin'!

190
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,625
We're goin' around in circles!

191
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:41,833
[KOZARU] Just shut up
and keep moving!

192
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,708
We're runnin' out of time!

193
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,208
I almost forgot.

194
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,833
It's been so quiet
that it's easy to

195
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,041
forget there are
other guilds in here.

196
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,500
Man, you gotta be kiddin' me.

197
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,625
You again.

198
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,458
It's the Fairy Tail guild!

199
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,500
[REGENT] This some kinda joke?

200
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,333
[NATSU] Aw, not those clowns!

201
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:02,708
[NARRATOR] As you may
recall, this is Twilight Ogre.

202
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,166
The guild that harassed
Fairy Tail while Natsu

203
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,708
and the others were
stuck on Tenrou Island.

204
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,833
But all that changed
when our heroes returned.

205
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,500
[NARRATOR] Fairy Tail turned
the tables on Twilight Ogre

206
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,500
and gave them the
punishment they deserved.

207
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,708
Well, I see your guild
is just as shoddy as ever.

208
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,166
[KOZARU] You're lame!

209
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,458
[GRAY] I'm surprised to see
you losers in the tournament.

210
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,791
[TEEBO] You got no
right to call us losers.

211
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,375
You're the guild that
always comes in last place!

212
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,375
Fairy Tail's takin'
first place this year!

213
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:32,791
Just you watch!

214
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,708
We'll see about that.

215
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,166
[LUCY] Whoa, hold on a sec!

216
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,041
You wanna fight us right here?

217
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,166
[NOPPO] Why not?

218
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,291
We can use magic
without restrictions!

219
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,791
I don't blame
ya for bein' scared!

220
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,083
[TEEBO] You Fairy Tail
punks are goin' down!

221
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,916
These guys'll never learn.

222
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,208
I'm fired up now!

223
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,916
We're really going
through with this?

224
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,250
The fewer the rivals,
the better our chances.

225
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,250
Yeah, you've got
a good point, Erza.

226
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,958
You're gonna pay for makin' us
look bad in front of the boss!

227
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,500
[REGENT] Let's pulverize 'em!

228
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,708
You're gonna be cryin' for
mercy when we get done with ya!

229
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,291
We don't have time
to mess with you.

230
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,791
'Cause we gotta
take down Sabertooth.

231
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,541
To be number one in Fiore!

232
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:09,833
[TEEBO] No way!

233
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:15,625
[rival guild cry out]

234
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,541
[ERZA] What now?

235
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,541
[NATSU]
Aw man, I don't like this!

236
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,916
[LUCY]
What the heck's goin' on?

237
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,166
[GRAY] The ground's moving!

238
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,791
Well no, technically.

239
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,458
It seems the labyrinth
itself has started to rotate!

240
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,583
[ALL] Seriously?

241
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,166
[ERZA] It seems the labyrinth
itself has started to rotate!

242
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:56,958
[NATSU] No way!

243
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,333
For real?

244
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,333
[NATSU] Nobody
warned us about this!

245
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,125
[Natsu and Lucy cry out]

246
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,125
Whoa, what's
happening to it?

247
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,958
I dunno but
it can't be good!

248
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,208
[HAPPY] Uh-oh!
Lisanna, look!

249
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,291
[LISANNA]
They're dropping like flies!

250
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,791
Oh no. If they fall
they'll be disqualified!

251
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,083
Really?

252
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,833
I hope they're gonna
be all right up there.

253
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,583
[ERZA]
It's turning on its Z-axis!

254
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:30,666
[GRAY] Hear that?

255
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,125
We've gotta move
to its sides, you guys!

256
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,208
[LUCY] Uh, we would
but we're already falling!

257
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,583
[NATSU] If only Happy were here!

258
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,791
[ELFMAN] Who needs
a flyin' cat...?

259
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,708
When you've got a
man like me on your team.

260
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,666
[NATSU] Whoa.
Nice catch.

261
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,208
Thanks Elfman,
you're the best!

262
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,041
Nah, just lookin'
out for my pals.

263
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,041
[GRAY] Are you okay over there?

264
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,458
[ALL] We're good!

265
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,208
It's stopped moving.

266
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,458
I dunno who came
up with this contraption,

267
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,791
but they're pretty
messed up in the head.

268
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,333
[ERZA] I'm not surprised by
the intricacy of the labyrinth.

269
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,750
It's designed to narrow over one
hundred teams down to eight.

270
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,458
[GRAY] It looks like that
last move was enough

271
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,666
to get rid of a lot of 'em.

272
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,250
[crowd babbling]

273
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,375
[LUCY] What's that?
Did those jerks make a map, too?

274
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,000
It appears they have.

275
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,500
Talk about a lucky break!

276
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:28,083
If we combine our notes
with Twilight Ogre's then

277
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,875
we'll have an even
better map of this place!

278
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,250
[TEEBO] Hey! What do
you think you're doin'?

279
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,833
[ERZA]
Oh, does this belong to you?

280
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,083
Yeah!
Now give it back!

281
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:40,875
[ERZA] Not gonna happen.

282
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:45,125
[TEEBO] You're not
gonna get away with this!

283
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,333
[MATO]
Another one bites the dust.

284
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,958
How about that.
I just figured out how we're

285
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,625
going to get ahead
in the preliminaries.

286
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,458
Whoa, what's with the
creepy look in your eyes?

287
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:59,916
[distant voices]

288
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,666
[MATO] The preliminary
round is about to

289
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,916
take a very serious turn.

290
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,583
[MATO] A vast majority
of the teams will

291
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,791
soon be eliminated,
one right after the other!

292
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,625
This is so exciting
I can barely contain myself!

293
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,333
[NATSU] May not be nice but
you know what we gotta do!

294
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:17,208
We've gotta start stealin
everyone else's maps!

295
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,750
You think this is
a race but it's a battle!

296
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,750
Cause we're fightin' a manly
map war like none other!

297
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,083
[NATSU] We're experts
when it comes

298
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,291
to kickin' the butts
of our rivals!

299
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,458
[ERZA] I'll take this.

300
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,708
Oh you can take
whatever you want!

301
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,333
[NATSU] Way to go,
team! We got six maps!

302
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,625
I don't wanna sound
stupid, but I got no idea how

303
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,666
I'm supposed to
read this damn thing.

304
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,666
[GRAY] This kinda
stuff is Lucy's specialty.

305
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,666
Let's ask her.

306
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,916
Yeah! Sweet!

307
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,750
All we gotta do is
gather as many maps

308
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,875
as we can and then
let her figure 'em out.

309
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,250
[LUCY] Who, me?

310
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,708
Good luck.

311
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,166
[LUCY] Thanks.

312
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,375
Hand 'em over, chumps!

313
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,291
Give us all of your maps!

314
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,125
I've already got
three of 'em so far!

315
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,458
Not too shabby,
but I've got seven!

316
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,083
I'm so sorry.

317
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,958
No, you're not.

318
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,583
[GRAY] It's gonna move again!

319
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,666
[ELFMAN] Hurry and
grab on to somethin'!

320
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:19,916
[ELFMAN] It stopped!

321
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,500
[NATSU] Awesome!

322
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,083
Alright team, let's
get back to business!

323
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,166
[ALZACK] What's up, Max?
Y'have any luck?

324
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,583
[MAX] I'm afraid not.

325
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,916
You'd think a little girl and
her talking cat would be

326
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,916
conspicuous,
but no one's seen 'em.

327
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,541
[WARREN] Yeah It's weird.

328
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,291
It's not like Wendy and Carla
to just wander off like that.

329
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,541
[MAX] We need to
hurry and find them

330
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,375
'cause I'm sure
the team's concerned.

331
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,500
It's gotta be hard for
them to focus on the race.

332
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,500
Hey did you find
anything, Warren?

333
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,583
[WARREN]
Nope, not even a single lead.

334
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,125
We've scoured
every inch of Crocus

335
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,208
but haven't seen
hide nor hair of them.

336
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,791
I suppose we could
check Domus Flau

337
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,708
but I doubt we'll
find them there.

338
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,541
[WARREN] The only place
left is the royal palace!

339
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,541
[HAPPY] That reminds me!

340
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,083
[LISANNA] What is it?

341
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,000
Earlier today, Carla
mentioned something about

342
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,833
going on a sightseeing
tour of the city with Wendy.

343
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,208
Well, in that case...

344
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,458
Maybe they are at the palace.

345
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,458
[HAPPY] There's only
one way to find out!

346
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,875
[LISANNA] Let's go!

347
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,333
[LUCY] I feel like there's
no point in trying to head east

348
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,125
from the surface
of the labyrinth.

349
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,583
We're just gonna
end up running around in

350
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,208
circles because the
stupid thing keeps rotating.

351
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,666
Is that why you
decided to bring

352
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,375
us to the center of it instead?

353
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:23,875
Yeah, I thought
it was gonna be easier to

354
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:27,458
find east from here
but apparently I was wrong.

355
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,250
[ERZA] Who would've thought
we'd find such a peaceful

356
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,291
landscape in the center
of this monstrosity?

357
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,000
[GRAY] It'd be more peaceful
if it wasn't upside down.

358
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,958
[ERZA] As if that
wasn't strange enough.

359
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:41,041
It would appear there's
no east or west anymore.

360
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,333
[GRAY] Geez, even
our compass is dizzy.

361
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:44,666
[ELFMAN] Man, this sucks!

362
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,916
There's no tellin' which
way we're supposed to go!

363
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,625
[ERZA] True but we can't
afford to stop moving either.

364
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,000
[LUCY] Yes! I've been
waiting for this moment!

365
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,416
What's gotten into you?

366
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,041
I bet this crazy place's got
her brain all scrambled.

367
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,666
[LUCY]
Nope, my brain's just fine!

368
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,291
Open, Gate of the Compass!

369
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,791
Pyxis!

370
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,625
Not that weird
duck thing again.

371
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,333
[NATSU]
Why does it look so scared?

372
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,625
Erza's compass must've
traumatized him.

373
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,541
[ERZA] I didn't
mean to upset him.

374
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,083
Okay pal!

375
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,750
Don't be scared--this
is your time to shine!

376
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,000
Her compass is
completely useless!

377
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,166
Observe.
It keeps spinning.

378
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,375
[LUCY] See?
I told ya!

379
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,166
We could really use
your help right now.

380
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,791
[ERZA]
I apologize for upsetting you.

381
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,750
Would you please assist us?

382
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,291
That's one
simpleminded Spirit.

383
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,875
Yeah, but I bet he's
still smarter than Erza.

384
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,500
[ERZA] What did you say?

385
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,500
[NATSU AND GRAY] Nothin'!
Nothin' at all!

386
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,666
[LUCY] East is that way!

387
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,250
[GRAY] One small problem,
"that way" is "up"!

388
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,541
[NATSU] You sure
he's right about this?

389
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,750
[LUCY] I'm positive!

390
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,708
Trust me, Celestial Spirits
are way stronger

391
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,083
than regular old compasses!

392
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,958
[ELFMAN] Any ideas on how
we're gonna get up there?

393
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,500
[ERZA] Isn't it obvious?

394
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,375
Give it a sec.

395
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:11,000
[ALL] We fall?
That's so not cool!

396
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,000
[ELFMAN] Would ya
look at those birds.

397
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,000
[GRAY] This sure
is peaceful, ain't it?

398
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,333
[LUCY] C'mon, we've worked
too hard and fallen too far

399
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,208
to get knocked out
of the preliminary round.

400
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,958
We've gotta get back at it.

401
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,083
This is no time
to be relaxing.

402
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,916
We're still in the
middle of a race.

403
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,250
[ERZA] Let's go!

404
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,041
We're taking first place
in the preliminary round!

405
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,416
[ALL] Oh yeah!

406
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,708
[ELFMAN] How in the
heck were they able

407
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,250
to squeeze an ocean
into this thing?

408
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,541
[LUCY] Who cares about that,
how long is this freakin' path?

409
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,291
[GRAY] Quit whinin' and look up!

410
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,041
[ERZA] The sky
above us isn't real.

411
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,208
It's been painted on.

412
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:54,958
[NATSU] She's right!

413
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,541
Check it out!

414
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,791
If that's the case, then this
must actually lead somewhere!

415
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,708
[ELFMAN]
And that's gotta be the goal!

416
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:01,750
[NATSU] Okay.
Team!

417
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,916
It's time for one final sprint!

418
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,416
[ALL] Let's go!

419
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,333
[LISANNA] So this is
the king of Fiore's castle.

420
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:19,166
[HAPPY] The luminaria
palace, Mercurius.

421
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,166
[LISANNA] This is the
first time I've ever seen it!

422
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,750
[HAPPY] Yeah, me too.

423
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:24,958
Stop right there!

424
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,208
Where do you
think you're going?

425
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,458
The grounds are closed.

426
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,916
[LISANNA] Sorry,
we're just looking for our

427
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,708
guild members
who've gone missing.

428
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,208
One of them was
supposed to participate

429
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,750
in the Grand Magic
Games preliminary round.

430
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,333
[HAPPY] We've searched
all over Crocus,

431
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:39,333
so this is the only place
left for us to check!

432
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,375
Hey. Let's just
let 'em in.

433
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:43,250
What?

434
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,625
Well, I guess there's no harm.

435
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,583
His Majesty is looking
forward to the games

436
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,333
so we certainly don't want
anything to interfere with that.

437
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,125
But don't go any farther
than the castle courtyard.

438
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,083
[HAPPY] We won't!
Thanks, guys!

439
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,708
Are you kiddin' me?
I can't believe it was so easy!

440
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,250
So what's the story man?

441
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,375
[WARREN]
The guards let Happy and

442
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,041
Lisanna inside the palace gates!

443
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:04,041
[MAX] How come those
jerks never let me in?

444
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,833
I'm kinda surprised
they let us do this.

445
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,208
Well, the gardens
have been open to

446
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:11,250
tourists in the past,
just not this late at night.

447
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,166
[HAPPY] I think we
should split up and search.

448
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,541
[LISANNA] Good idea!

449
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,541
We'll use Warren's telepathy
to keep in touch, okay?

450
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:17,958
[HAPPY] Aye, Sir!

451
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,375
Got it!

452
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,791
We're on our way
to Mercurius right now!

453
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,125
[ALZACK] I really hope
that those two are okay!

454
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,458
[MAX] The games
haven't even started yet

455
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,791
and there's already trouble?

456
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,125
We're really gettin'
off on the wrong foot!

457
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,875
[MATO] Elfman Strauss.

458
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,833
[MATO] Erza Scarlet.

459
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,708
[MATO] Gray Fullbuster.

460
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,958
[MATO] Lucy Heartfilia.

461
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,458
[MATO] And Natsu Dragneel.

462
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,041
[MATO] Congratulations
Team Fairy Tail!

463
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,875
You've cleared
the preliminary round!

464
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,125
[NATSU] We did it!

465
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,708
Why do you sound
so surprised?

466
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,166
I knew we were gonna make it.

467
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,583
I'm dying to know, did
we come in first place?

468
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,458
[MATO]
Uh. No.

469
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,625
More like eighth place.

470
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:06,000
[MATO]
You just barely qualified.

471
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,500
[ALL] Eighth place?

472
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,541
[MATO] Attention everyone!

473
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,083
The eight teams
have been determined!

474
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:25,083
[MATO] The Grand Magic
Games' preliminary round,

475
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:28,166
Sky Labyrinth, is over!

476
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,583
[MAX]
Did Fairy Tail make the cut?

477
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,125
[WARREN] Yeah, which guilds
are moving on to the tournament?

478
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,916
[MATO] Oh, so you
wanna know who's

479
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,666
participating in
the main events?

480
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,416
Well, you'll just have
to wait until the

481
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,958
opening ceremonies to find out!

482
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,708
[ALZACK] Aw c'mon!
Why won't you just

483
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,166
tell us, ya killjoy?

484
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,958
Sounds like the
preliminary round's over.

485
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,208
I wonder if our
team made it through.

486
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,500
[LISANNA] Happy!
Is there something wrong?

487
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,458
[HAPPY] Look.
I found this.

488
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:59,291
[LISANNA] That purse!
I've seen it before.

489
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,125
Yeah, I have too.
That's Wendy's.

490
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,458
Now I'm worried!
What happened to them?

491
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:10,583
Just stay calm.

492
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,875
They're probably
not too far from here.

493
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:13,708
[HAPPY] You're right.

494
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:14,833
[LISANNA] Let's go!

495
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,333
[HAPPY] Aye!

496
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,916
Wait, you found 'em?

497
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,541
So they were at the palace.

498
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,625
Are they all right?

499
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:27,791
I think so.

500
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,208
It's hard to tell;
they're unconscious!

501
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,791
Would you please send
help as fast as possible?

502
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,125
Wake up, Carla!

503
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,291
It's me, Happy; you know,
the one you call "tomcat"?

504
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,833
She doesn't
seem to be injured.

505
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,291
That's good.

506
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:43,166
But I barely sense
any magic power from her.

507
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,833
Yeah, same with Carla!

508
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,291
Isn't there anything we can do?

509
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:52,708
She's awake!

510
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:55,291
Maybe she'll be able
to tell us what happened!

511
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:56,375
No!

512
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,083
Don't hurt me!

513
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,958
[LISANNA] It's okay.
You're safe.

514
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,041
It's Lisanna;
do you recognize me?

515
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,875
[HAPPY] I'm here with ya, too!

516
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:07,500
[WENDY] Happy.
Lisanna.

517
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:12,208
What in the world happened?

518
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,666
[HAPPY] We were gonna
ask you the same thing.

519
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,166
You don't remember?

520
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,500
[WENDY] No.

521
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,250
[NARRATOR] With Elfman filling
in for Wendy, Team Fairy Tail

522
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:24,291
managed to pass the preliminary
round to become one of the

523
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:28,000
eight teams that will compete in
the tournament's main events.

524
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:33,083
At last the stage is set for
the Grand Magic Games to begin!

525
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,958
[NARRATOR] Team Fairy Tail is
determined to defeat Sabertooth

526
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:38,708
and become the
number one guild in Fiore.

527
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:42,458
Can they rise from the
ashes and come out on top?

528
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:47,500
♪

529
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,166
[HAPPY] You did it!

530
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,000
But I can't believe
you came in last.

531
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:17,250
[NATSU] It must
be some kinda mistake!

532
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,375
[HAPPY] Nope, last place.

533
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,583
[NATSU] Shut up!

534
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,708
All that matters is
we cleared the prelims!

535
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:22,208
Now I just have
to defeat everyone

536
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:23,375
from first to seventh place!

537
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:24,916
[HAPPY] I don't follow ya.

538
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
There are eight teams and each
one has five members, right?

539
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:30,958
Then that means I gotta beat,
let's see, forty people?

540
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:33,333
[NATSU AND HAPPY]
Next time: New Guild!

541
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:35,708
[HAPPY] I gotta admit, I'm
impressed you got the math right

542
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:37,750
but that means you'd
have to fight yourself.

543
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:39,083
[NATSU]
Thirty-nine people, then!

544
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:41,083
[HAPPY] But that
includes your teammates!

545
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:41,625
Whatever.
