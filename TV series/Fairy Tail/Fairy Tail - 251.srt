1
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:05,458
I don't understand.
What made you come here?

2
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:08,166
[STING] It was that
letter you'd sent us.

3
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,500
[ERZA]
Uh...

4
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:13,083
[MAKAROV] Minerva's fallen
pretty far, hasn't she?

5
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:17,500
I plan to contact Sting, as
well, once things slow down.

6
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,000
Oh yes, I'd forgotten.

7
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:22,708
Speaking of that letter. I'm
not tryin' to be rude here.

8
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:23,875
But it was weird.

9
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:24,750
Psycho.

10
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:25,750
[ERZA]
Uh!

11
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,541
Yeah, sorry but it
did kinda look

12
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,083
like a crazy person wrote it.

13
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,750
Man. That handwriting.
It made me sick.

14
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,750
Poor Yukino. She tried to
read it and passed out.

15
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,166
Only Rufus could decipher it.

16
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,750
Even he was nearly
driven insane.

17
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,750
We would've arrived
much sooner, but...

18
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,916
Say no more.

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,333
M'lady.

20
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,791
Please, come back
to the guild with us.

21
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:57,791
[MARD GEER] Go wherever
you like. I shan't stop you.

22
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,625
But no matter where
you may flee,

23
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:02,791
you will still be in
a world without magic.

24
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,791
[ERZA] We know that face
has been destroyed.

25
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,708
It's true one was demolished.

26
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:07,625
[gasps]

27
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,166
[STING]
Hold on.

28
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,791
We did see a bunch of creepy
looking face statues

29
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,291
on our way over here.

30
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,458
[ROGUE] If those are indeed
what you're talking about,

31
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,458
there are far too many to count.

32
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,458
[ERZA]
What?

33
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:20,916
Just one hour.

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,791
That's approximately
how long we have

35
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,750
until every last one
of them detonates.

36
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:29,375
Thousands of pulse bombs will
unleash their power all at once.

37
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:34,375
And thus cleanse the scourge of
magic from this world forever.

38
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,416
[MARD GEER]
It's exactly as I envisioned.

39
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,583
You can take comfort in the
fact this isn't your failure.

40
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:46,791
There was simply nothing you
could've done to stop it.

41
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,708
Aw, man. This is gettin' old.

42
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,666
Do ya have to make
all those stupid noises

43
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,875
when you use your magic?

44
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:08,541
I don't use magic.
It's curse power.

45
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,666
Glug, glug, glug.

46
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,750
Huh?!

47
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,750
[groaning, yelps]

48
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,625
It's eatin' me!

49
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:20,583
Fire Dragon Brilliant Flame!

50
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,166
Drip, drop.

51
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,458
[NATSU]
Gah! Stop doin' that!

52
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:29,625
[NATSU grunts]

53
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,500
You should just give up.

54
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,583
Oh, I'll keep goin' till I
wipe that look off your face!

55
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,958
[yells]

56
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,250
This guy's tough. For real.
What in the hell's he made of?

57
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,750
You use Iron elemental magic.

58
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:53,166
It may be rare, but it's
extremely predictable.

59
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,791
One look at you told
me what to expect.

60
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,291
You shouldn't bash
anyone's looks, ugly!

61
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,541
Speakin' of bashing,
Iron Dragon Club!

62
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,250
Pitiful.

63
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,166
They say the weakest
dog howls the loudest.

64
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,083
That explains why you won't
stop running your mouth!

65
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,875
I'll shut you up!

66
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,791
Water Slicer!

67
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,916
[KEYES laughs]

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,583
Right through him.

69
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,333
This technique is
similar to mine.

70
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:29,208
But I've never experienced
fighting somebody like me.

71
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,708
[KEYES]
Your stories.

72
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,250
What did you just say?

73
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,625
[KEYES chuckles]
Seilah claims humans

74
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:38,458
are only capable of weaving
uninteresting and dreary tales.

75
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,500
But I find the stories of your
particular group of humans

76
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:46,583
to be quite fascinating.
And extremely amusing.

77
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,208
[LUCY] Aquarius and the
Celestial Spirit King

78
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:07,625
gave all they had. So...

79
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:12,708
I've gotta keep fighting.
I can't give up now!

80
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:21,750
My friends need me.
But I can't even stand up.

81
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,458
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,625
You mean there are still
thousands of those things left?

83
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,250
But how? That's insane!

84
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,875
You've gotta be joking, right?

85
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,500
One hour. That's all we have.

86
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:40,750
If that really happens, we
are in some serious trouble.

87
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,375
Does that mean no more
flying and stuff?

88
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,291
It's a whole lot
worse than that.

89
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:48,791
Think of how many things in this
world work by using magic power.

90
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,833
Not to mention what it would
do to everybody in our guild.

91
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,750
It's scary.

92
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,291
[MINERVA (NEO)] 
Utter nonsense.

93
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:58,208
You couldn't control
even one Face remotely.

94
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,791
So what the hell makes you think

95
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,833
you could set off thousands of
them at once? You're bluffing.

96
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,416
Au contraire.

97
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,250
The former chairman has the
ability to operate them.

98
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:10,625
I must say, although I'd rather
avoid humans altogether,

99
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,958
he's proven himself
rather useful.

100
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:13,875
[MINERVA (NEO)]
Then your underling

101
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,208
shouldn't have killed him.

102
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,416
[ERZA]
He's dead?

103
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,916
You seem to have forgotten.

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,916
Tartaros has a necromancer
amongst our ranks.

105
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,208
What's that mean?

106
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,708
It means someone who
can control the dead.

107
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,166
[MARD GEER] Through this power.

108
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,083
The late chairman is hard at
work in the control room.

109
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,875
Readying the Faces
for detonation.

110
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,666
You're using his corpse.

[MINERVA (NEO)]
Despite all of this destruction.

112

Alright, Erza! You heard him.

114
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,583
Go and shut it down!

handle things here.

Are you sure?

[STING] Yeah, just take
M'lady and the cats with you.

Keep them safe.

after we defeat him.

00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,000
[BOTH]
Well, this idiot started it!

163
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,916
They're actually quarreling
in the midst of battle?

164
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,541
I will never understand
these humans.

165
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:20,541
Nor I.

166
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,375
Ya know, that last
hit kinda hurt.

167
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,583
We probably do need to put our
focus back on these freaks.

168
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,583
I guess I'll have to settle the
score with you once we're done.

169
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,666
Sounds like a solid plan to me!

170

[NATSU, GAJEEL yell]

171
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:39,458
[KEYES] In what captivating
way will your story unfold?

172
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,833
I can't wait to find out.

173
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:45,625
[JUVIA] I need to concentrate
on winning this fight.

174
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:49,583
But I can't stop thinking about
what may be happening with Gray.

175
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,708
[GRAY] No way! There're
thousands of 'em?

176
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,958
[SILVER]
Hm.

177
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,958
I can't believe the council
built a weapon like that.

178
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,333
It's crazy.

179
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,583
Come on.

180
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,291
I know you didn't bring
me all the way out here

181
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,666
just to tell me that.

182
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,500
[SILVER]
Of course not.

183
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,625
[SILVER]
I was hopin' to see the look

184
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,250
of crushin' despair
on your face.

185
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,250
[GRAY] Well, I'm so sorry
to disappoint ya, ya creep.

186
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,875
[SILVER] It's a damn shame.

187
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:33,916
I mean just killing you outright
sounds so boring to me.

188
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,875
Tell me. And be honest.
You know me, don't ya?

189
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,666
I do. Very well, in fact.

190
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,291
[GRAY] 
Is that so?

191
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:51,000
I recognize your face and the
way you sound. But you're lying.

192
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:54,583
You're just wearing a disguise.

193
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:58,750
Who are you?
Why are you doing this?

194
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:03,666
Answer me! Tell me
who you really are!

195
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,416
Oh please. You know
exactly who I am.

196
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,041
You may not want to
believe it's true.

197
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:14,333
But you're my own
flesh and blood.

198
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,916
You're right, old man.

199
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,083
I don't believe you.
Because it's impossible.

200
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,833
My father is dead!

201
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,541
I saw it happen!

202
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:47,250
Deliora killed him
right in front of me!

203
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:12,458
[SILVER]
My name is Silver Fullbuster.

204
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,875
I am your father.

He's long gone! He was
murdered 17 years ago!

better than I thought it'd be!

[laughs]

213
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,291
I'm bein' totally
honest with ya, kid.

214
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,666
Your daddy's right here.

215
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,541
I mean, technically
speaking, he is at least.

216
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,208
[GRAY] 
The hell does that mean?

217
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,583
[SILVER] Let's just say,
I'm actually somebody

218
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,083
that had an even
bigger impact on you.

219

dying to get revenge

on for as long as
you can remember!

[JUVIA] Something's very wrong.
There's no doubt in my mind.

00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,333
Gray's in real danger!

fight!

Leave the rest of
the fight to us.

He's right. Plus, I just
caught this scent.

[MARD GEER]
I punished her for it,

248
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:28,875
but I understand why Kyoka so
loved to play with your kind.

Oh, do you?

We came here to fight. Not talk!

00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,750
[MARD GEER] You're completely
at the mercy of your emotions.

252
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:39,416
And yet, at the same time wholly
unaware of this weakness.

253
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,958
You don't realize how close you
are to your imminent demise.

254
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,708
Just like lambs
led to slaughter.

[ROGUE, STING whimper]

256

It's endearing, in a way.
But that still won't save you.

be the biggest dump

[FROSCH]
Yeah, it sure is messy.

260
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,458
[LECTOR] I understand
demons lived here,

261
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,291
but you'd think they'd
clean up sometimes.

262
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,375
[FROSCH] 
I guess not.

263
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,000
Do you know how we can find
the control room from here?

264
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,291
Are we close?

265

Everything's been damaged
beyond recognition.

266
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,208
I can't tell.

267
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,541
Mard Geer claimed it was still
intact, but where could it be?

268
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,041
We're running out of time.

269
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:26,333
You should go on. I'm only
slowing your progress.

270
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,541
I have no idea where we are.

271
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:32,000
I can't even walk on my
own. Leave me behind.

272
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:35,375
I have no interest in being
anyone's burden.

[MINERVA (NEO)]
Didn't you hear what I said?

274
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,958
Keep dragging me around,
and we're all going to die!

275
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,000
[ERZA] You may not believe
in yourself right now,

276
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,000
Minerva, but I still do!

277
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,541
Realizing how far you've strayed

278
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,666
is the first step to
getting on the right path.

279
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:59,250
It may seem impossible, but
I know you have it in you.

280
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,125
The journey ahead
will be challenging.

Face your past. Seek out
redemption for your sins.

if you want it.

00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,791
Now you have the silly hat!

319
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,666
How could you?! [cries]

320
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,666
This mushroom.

321
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,708
It's an extremely special kind.

322
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:34,208
Very rare. And quite
valuable, too.

323
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,583
Oh, yeah? How much is it worth?

324
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:37,708
[groaning]

325
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,791
That all depends on
how helpful it is.

326
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:44,208
Show us to the control room,
and it might be worth your life.

327
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,208
[FRANMALTH]
I was hoping

328
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,958
nobody'd have to
see me like this!

329
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,833
M'lady's back!

330
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:49,833
Yay!

331
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,958
Nice job catching
that one, Happy.

332
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,958
Aw. It's all in a days work!

333
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,416
[PANTHERLILY]
He's the picture of "smug."

334
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,041
[ERZA] The face bombs are set
to go in less than one hour.

335
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,583
Let's get moving!

336
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:05,208
You'd better explain
yourself, right now!

337
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,833
[GRAY groans]

338
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,541
[SILVER] Geez, where would
I even start with that?

339
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:12,958
Let's see here...

340
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:16,041
Why don't I tell you
about my appearance?

341
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,583
This body is just a vessel.

342
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,041
I happened upon
some random corpse.

343
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,166
[GRAY gasps]

344
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,041
[SILVER] You know that
every member of Tartaros

345
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,500
is a demon from Zeref's
books, don't you?

346
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,500
Myself included.

347
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:33,000
In fact, my true form
isn't even remotely human.

348
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,833
But still, you can probably
imagine how hard it is

349
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:39,250
to blend in when you go around
looking like a big, scary demon.

350
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:43,000
That's why I needed a human
"costume," if you will.

351
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,583
When the time
finally rolled around

352
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:47,375
to pick which one I wanted.
Of course, I had to choose

353
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,833
the one that still had
all his body parts intact.

354
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:53,375
Honestly, I've kind of grown
attached to this old thing.

355
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,333
Anyway, I didn't have any
ulterior motive for throwing

356
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,416
this one on, just convenience.

357
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,875
But somehow it's what brought
you and I together again.

358
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,916
This day has been a
long time coming, my boy.

359
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,666
I've been hungry for the taste
of your blood.

360
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,250
You're about one second
away from a beat down!

361
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,375
I still don't have a clue

362
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,291
what in the hell
you're talkin' about!

363
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:17,208
Why are you really using
my dad's body like this?

364
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,458
And why do you want
to use it to kill me?

365
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:20,833
[SILVER]
You wanna know?

366
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,375
Because I won't be satisfied

367
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:26,958
until I've killed everyone
that witch Ur cared about!

368
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:31,416
After all, she put me in that
prison of ice for ten years!

369
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,416
[GRAY]
What?

370
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,958
[SILVER]
I'm not Silver, I'm Deliora!

371
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:42,208
There's no way in hell
you've forgotten my name!

372
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,000
[GRAY gasps]

373
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,916
No way. Ur killed
Deliora. I saw it!

374
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,791
[SILVER] Yes, that is true.
I was dead for ten long years.

375
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:09,041
But once Tartaros built the
Hell's Core regeneration system,

376
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:12,041
it gave me another chance
to get my sweet revenge.

377
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:16,666
You're here for revenge? Really?
I know how that feels.

378
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,916
If you're having a hard
time believing me,

379
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,625
I can show you my true form...

380
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,541
You know, the one from
your nightmares?

381
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:25,791
The monster that killed
your whole family!

382
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:28,750
[NATSU grunts]

383
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,500
[GAJEEL grunts]

384
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:33,166
[JUVIA] That feeling of
dread is not going away.

385
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,333
I'm even more afraid
than before.

386
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,416
I know he needs my help!

387
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,208
Let's end this, so I can
rush to my Gray's side!

388
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,166
[KEYES]
Gray?

389
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,416
[JUVIA]
Mm?

390
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,875
[KEYES] How exciting.
It's just as I supposed.

391
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:49,458
That young man and you have an
intermingled story, do you not?

392
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,833
[JUVIA]
What?

393
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:55,041
[KEYES] But all stories that
begin, must one day end.

394
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:55,958
[JUVIA gasps]

395
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,333
[KEYES]
Gray's story truly began

396
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:01,333
when Deliora took
everything away from him.

397
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:02,875
That was his rebirth.

398
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,791
[JUVIA]
What are you talking about?

399
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,541
[KEYES]
That grisly reaper

400
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,291
harvested the lives
of his family...

401
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:13,791
Rendered his entire village
to a burning pile of embers.

402
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:18,333
That horrific event marked
the beginning of his tale.

403
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:21,083
What delicious irony.
For on this day,

404
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:25,166
we shall see that tale
come to its tragic end.

405
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:28,875
No. It can't be. He'll die?

406
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:31,208
[KEYES]
It's far richer than that.

407
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:36,666
The boy will face despair, in
a form so sweet and familiar.

408
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:42,666
Even so, his tale will conclude
the same way his master's did.

409
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,208
[LUCY] Deliora took
everything from Gray.

410
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:15,916
His family, his master,

411
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,416
all the things that gave
him love, and warmth.

412
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,500
In a way, much like the demon,

413
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:23,041
Gray was thrown into
his own icy prison.

414
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,875
Now that the demon has returned,

415
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:26,416
taking on the image
of his father,

416
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,791
the fires of rage
burn inside him.

417
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:33,083
But despite all his fury, the
young ice wizard is left cold.

418
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:37,125
Next Time: "Tartaros Chapter
Gray vs. Silver"

419
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:41,291
But in the desolate tundra of
sorrow, warmth can be found.
