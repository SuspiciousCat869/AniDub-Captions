1
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:28,583
[GRAY] What the...?

2
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,625
[GAJEEL] Looks like it's
startin' to transform.

3
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,666
I think I liked him
better how he was before.

4
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,708
Everyone, keep your guard up.

5
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:45,625
He's bound to attack soon.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,291
Why would he do this?

7
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,375
He'll destroy the
whole realm before long!

8
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:02,708
[ERZA] He well may,

9
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,458
so we can't sit back
and wait for Natsu and Happy

10
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,875
to tear their way
out of his innards.

11
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,583
I say we take him down now

12
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,541
and hope Natsu does what
he must and escapes quickly.

13
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:14,416
I'm a gambling man,
and I like those odds.

14
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,000
So what, he might get injured?

15
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,750
Yeah, sounds like a
risk I'm willing to take.

16
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,333
[HAPPY] So... Natsu?

17
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:58,541
It's cool that
we made it in here,

18
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,666
but now it's too dark
to see anything.

19
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,500
Where do we go?

20
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:02,708
[NATSU sniffing]

21
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,791
I can smell Loke
and the other spirits,

22
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,625
but I can't tell
where the scent's from.

23
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:07,625
[HAPPY] Uh oh.

24
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,666
Could that mean
they got absorbed?

25
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,083
[NATSU] Maybe, maybe not.

26
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,625
Look, this is
just a gut feeling,

27
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,458
but I think they're alive.

28
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:21,958
[HAPPY] His belly's huge!

29
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,291
It's like he's got a
whole universe inside it!

30
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,458
No wonder this guy's
so friggin' hungry.

31
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,625
[NATSU]
Hey Loke! Can you hear me?

32
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,958
Where are you?

33
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,583
[HAPPY] Believe!

34
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,375
[NATSU sniffing]

35
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:39,541
[HAPPY] Well?

36
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,250
Yeah, I still can't
tell where they are.

37
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,583
I can smell 'em,

38
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,750
but it's like the scent's
comin' from all over.

39
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,708
[HAPPY] Then how're
we supposed to find 'em?

40
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,791
[NATSU]
Same way we do everything.

41
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:52,166
We're gonna fly around breakin'
stuff until we get what we want.

42
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,375
I bet those things woulda hurt.

43
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,125
[HAPPY]
Good thing I dodged 'em!

44
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,875
[HAPPY]
They've got us surrounded!

45
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,500
[BOTH yelling]

46
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,041
[NATSU] Screw this!

47
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:11,250
Fire Dragon Wing Attack!

48
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,541
[HAPPY] Hey, something's
glowin' down there!

49
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,750
Do you see it?

50
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,916
[NATSU] Yup, and I can
hear somethin', too.

51
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah, that's
Loke's scent all right.

52
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,125
[HAPPY]
No point in waiting, then.

53
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,458
Let's move out!

54
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,166
[NATSU] Crap,
we can't catch a break!

55
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,375
I just realized...

56
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,291
This thing's immune system
is attacking us

57
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,625
like we're like some
kind of bacterial invaders!

58
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,375
[NATSU] Well, he's about
to get one hell of a fever!

59
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,458
[screams]

60
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,166
[GRAY] Damnit!
He keeps knocking us back.

61
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,833
How do we get in
close enough to hit him?

62
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,083
[ERZA] Well...

63
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:13,666
The blasts are charging
from those green spikes,

64
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,333
so target them first!

65
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,041
[LUCY]
Looks like he's in pain.

66
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,375
Then again,
he might just be annoyed.

67
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,500
It's Natsu.

68
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:28,041
Ol' Salamander's
tearin' it up in there.

69
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,208
[yelling]

70
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,500
Look! Behind us!

71
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,416
[NATSU] This is gettin' old!

72
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,791
Fire Dragon Iron Fist!

73
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,875
I think the attacks
are getting stronger.

74
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,416
[NATSU] They are.

75
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,416
As if it wasn't hard enough
to fight in the dark like this.

76
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,583
Huh? That's new.

77
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,666
[HAPPY] They're moving
like they're alive.

78
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,583
That was close!

79
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,750
[HAPPY] They're only toying with
us, man, just look at 'em go!

80
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,458
[NATSU] So we're not germs!

81
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:11,125
[NATSU] I'm tired of dodgin'!
Let's trash these stupid rocks!

82
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:14,083
Fire Dragon... Brilliant Flame!

83
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:16,875
[HAPPY] Two more!

84
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,458
[NATSU] Got 'em!

85
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,958
Fire Dragon Roar!

86
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,791
[GAJEEL] Got somethin' for ya!

87
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,041
Iron Dragon Club!

88
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,958
[GAJEEL]
Hey! Take a look at that.

89
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,208
I put a crack in it!

90
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,000
[GRAY] Let's keep
attackin' the same spots!

91
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,666
Screw weak points,
we can make our own!

92
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,250
Gajeel! Gray!

93
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,333
[ERZA] Lucy!

94
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:51,916
[LUCY grunting]

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,791
[ERZA] Just one more blow.

96
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:56,291
We did it!

97
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,583
And we can do it again.

98
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,250
There's one spike down,
now let's get the rest.

99
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,333
[ERZA] This fight
is far from over. Let's go!

100
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,541
[LUCY, GRAY, GAJEEL] Yeah!

101
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,791
[HAPPY] Hey, Natsu?

102
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,958
Might just be me, but it seems
like it's getting brighter.

103
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:11,958
[NATSU]
Yeah, we haven't been attacked

104
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,583
by any weird rocks
lately, either.

105
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,125
[HAPPY] Who knows?

106
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,125
Maybe the others found a way
to beat him up from the outside.

107
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,333
[NATSU] Could be!

108
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,666
Watch out! He's starting
to charge up again!

109
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,583
Take cover, now!

110
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,458
Yeah? Where, exactly?

111
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,083
Now you've pissed me off.

112
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,791
[yelling]

113
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,583
Iron Dragon Club!

114
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,791
His shockwave attacks
have weakened considerably

115
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,958
since the start of this fight.

116
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,500
Our hunch was correct.

117
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,958
Those spikes are key
to his attacking power.

118
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,791
Let's hit them
'til there's nothing left!

119
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,041
Right!

120
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,625
Hang in there.
We're on our way.

121
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,250
[HAPPY]
Well, that looked painful.

122
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,291
You all right?

123
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,375
Yeah. Honestly,
that kinda tickled.

124
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,500
[HAPPY] Look, it's getting
brighter even faster now!

125
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,666
[NATSU sniffing]

126
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,041
Over there!

127
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,625
Dunno what changed, but
I can follow that smell now.

128
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,041
Loke's gotta be that way.

129
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,416
[HAPPY] Cool! Let's get him!

130
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,666
[NATSU] Aye, Sir!

131
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,833
Hey, are you okay?

132
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,625
I'm fine.
I've had it way worse than this.

133
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,041
Plus Natsu's still
wreakin' havoc in there.

134
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,250
There's not a chance in hell

135
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,833
I'll let that stupid
punk have all the fun.

136
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,416
Hey, Natsu...

137
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,875
Whaddaya think
that light could be?

138
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,416
That's the spot.
Bet the whole zodiac's in there.

139
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,291
[HAPPY] It's so bright!
And my feathers are melting!

140
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,458
Just get me in as
close as you can, okay?

141
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,958
[HAPPY] Aye, Sir!

142
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,666
[GRAY] Ice Impact!

143
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,583
We've taken out
almost every spike.

144
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:22,833
Any sign of Natsu?

145
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,916
[GRAY]
Think he's still inside.

146
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,083
What the hell is he doin'
in there, takin' a nap?

147
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,458
Come on...

148
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,833
What the heck is this?

149
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,583
That isn't possible... is it?

150
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,250
[NATSU] Mustache face.

151
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,208
[HAPPY]
Well if the spirit beast

152
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,500
is as hungry as we think he is,

153
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,541
he'd try and
eat himself for sure.

154
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,000
That orb must be its stomach.

155
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,583
[NATSU] Wait, so where
d'you think we are?

156
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,875
[HAPPY] We're right above
the center of the spirit beast.

157
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:00,958
His belly.

158
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,375
[NATSU] Hey, big guy!
Stache-face!

159
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,875
Wake up, will ya?

160
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,583
[HAPPY] That can't be good.
What do we do?

161
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,500
[NATSU] Keep him from gettin'
dragged into that mess.

162
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,291
C'mon!

163
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,458
[HAPPY] Aye, Sir!

164
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:14,875
It's those chains
that're pullin' him in.

165
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,166
If we can break 'em,
we'll be good!

166
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,333
Sure thing!

167
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,375
Fire Dragon Crushing Fang!

168
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:23,583
Fire Dragon Roar!

169
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,541
[HAPPY] They didn't even budge!

170
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,041
You were just
holdin' back, right?

171
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,625
Well yeah, I can
probably burn through 'em,

172
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,041
but it'll take a minute.

173
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,583
[HAPPY]
Too bad we don't have one!

174
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,083
[NATSU]
Damn it. Gotta think fast.

175
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,166
[HAPPY] If he sinks too deep,
he'll get digested alive!

176
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,708
[NATSU] Plan B!
Fire Dragon Grip of Steel!

177
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,166
Put your back into it!

178
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,083
Flap those wings like you've
never flapped 'em before!

179
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,166
[HAPPY] Aye, Sir!

180
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,625
[straining]

181
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,833
[HAPPY]
They're electric, too?

182
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,625
[NATSU sniffing]

183
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:57,583
What the...?

184
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,125
Loke, is that you?

185
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,166
[LOKE]
This doesn't concern you, human.

186
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,083
Be gone.

187
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,458
[NATSU] It is you!

188
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,666
[HAPPY] If Loke's in that chain,
then what about--

189
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,166
Uh, Natsu?

190
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,750
There are thirteen chains around
the Celestial Spirit King.

191
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,750
[NATSU] Lemme guess. One for
every member of the Zodiac.

192
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,916
[HAPPY] If ya count
the snake lady, yeah.

193
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,833
But why would they do this?

194
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:22,333
[TAURUS]
All for the sake of the king.

195
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,291
[LIBRA]
All for the sake of the king.

196
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,791
[HAPPY] And I thought
they were weirdos before.

197
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,166
What the heck is
that thing up to now?

198
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,458
It doesn't have any
spikes left to hit us with.

199
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,291
True, but it seems to
be regaining power somehow.

200
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,500
Hey! Salamander!

201
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,833
Wake the hell up
and do somethin'!

202
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:52,166
[ERZA] Looks like the start
of a second transformation.

203
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,333
Quick!
Attack before it can finish!

204
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,625
[HAPPY] They're gonna
shove the real king

205
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,833
into that thing's stomach
unless we stop 'em.

206
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,333
But what can we do?

207
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:01,125
[NATSU] Drop me in.

208
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,166
[HAPPY] What?

209
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,916
Plans are overrated,
don't need one.

210
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,041
I'll know just what
to do once I'm in there.

211
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:10,208
[VIRGO] Do not
interfere in this, mortal.

212
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,666
[GEMI] All for
the sake of the king.

213
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,500
[MINI] All for
the sake of the king.

214
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,791
[SAGITTARIUS] You're neither
needed nor wanted here, so go.

215
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,833
[HAPPY] Do you really want me
to drop you, or is this a test?

216
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,750
[NATSU]
Course I do! Go ahead.

217
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,291
[HAPPY] Bombs away!

218
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:31,166
[NATSU] Hey. I know you
can hear me, so listen good.

219
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,125
I don't care how
sweet your dreams are.

220
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:36,916
I will tear you from them.
Then I'll make ya fix this mess.

221
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,500
'Specially the bit with Lucy.

222
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,250
You made her cry.

223
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,708
Put so much as a quiver
on her chin again,

224
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,291
and I will shave
your 'stache with fire.

225
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,166
Good talk.
But what are ya gonna do now?

226
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,541
Do you think Natsu's all right?

227
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,833
No way to be sure. But--

228
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,041
We gotta attack while
we still have a chance!

229
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,208
C'mon, Salamander,

230
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,875
you've gotta get
the hell outta there, now!

231
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,750
[NATSU yelling]

232
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,375
Are you crazy?

233
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,291
[HAPPY]
How dumb can you be?

234
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,291
I thought you learned
your lesson last time!

235
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,291
You got super sick
off of Loke's magic,

236
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,666
and that stuff could
melt right through ya!

237
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:30,375
[ERZA] Come!

238
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,375
Erza!

239
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,375
What're you doing?
He'll crush you!

240
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,833
[ERZA] I haven't heard
or seen them.

241
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,958
But I believe
they will prevail!

242
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,541
Natsu and Happy!

243
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,208
For that belief, I fight!

244
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,083
[ERZA] They're coming back,
both of them!

245
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:51,375
And when they do,
you will fall!

246
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:08,625
[HAPPY] I gotcha!

247
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,875
"Watch what you eat,"
I said, but ya didn't listen!

248
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,875
You should make "nom first
and ask questions later"

249
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,166
your new catchphrase!

250
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,208
[NATSU chuckles]

251
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,291
Now that I've eaten,
I'm all fired up.

252
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,791
No way!

253
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,708
[NATSU] Get back in there!
I'ma tear those chains apart!

254
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,208
[HAPPY] Aye, Sir!

255
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,958
[HAPPY] Hey! Check it out!

256
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,333
The light just
got a little dimmer!

257
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,041
[NATSU] That's awesome!

258
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,166
Dragon Slayer Secret Art!

259
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,625
Celestial Fire
Exploding Flame Blade!

260
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,458
[NATSU, HAPPY yelling]

261
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,000
Natsu! Hang in there!

262
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,166
[NATSU] Lucy...

263
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:38,083
[ERZA straining]

264
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,333
Come on!

265
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,791
Erza!

266
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,083
That was quite
the entrance, thanks.

267
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,708
It's the Spirit King!

268
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,041
[HAPPY] Amazing!

269
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,583
I almost forgot how pretty
the Celestial World could be!

270
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:06,583
[NATSU] Me, too.

271
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,041
[LUCY]
Thank you so much, Natsu!

272
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,458
You too, Happy!

273
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,208
No problem.
Right back at'cha.

274
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,708
I do what I can.

275
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,625
But hey,
how reckless can you get?

276
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,041
I'm just glad to
see everyone is safe.

277
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,041
Haven't felt this bad

278
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,333
since the last time
I rode a train.

279
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,666
Ya leapt into an
Eclipse spirit's stomach acid.

280
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,791
What the hell'd you expect?

281
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:29,083
Just had to hog
all the fun, didn't ya?

282
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,916
[NATSU] Some of us
were trapped in the stars.

283
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
[JUVIA] And now we're back!

284
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,333
Thanks to you!

285
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,375
Yes, thanks.

286
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,666
I wouldn't have
lasted much longer.

287
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,041
Did you miss me, Gray?

288
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,458
Strange...

289
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,291
I found life as a constellation
surprisingly pleasant.

290
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,875
I liked it, too!

291
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,166
But I couldn't live in the stars
without you, so come with me!

292
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,166
A real fighter doesn't twinkle.

293
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,750
Hey, Carla!

294
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,000
You should've seen me and Natsu
beatin' down that spirit beast.

295
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,208
It was super tough,
but I did it for you!

296
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,916
So has anyone seen
the celestial spirits?

297
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
[NATSU] Oh, yeah!

298
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,833
They gotta be
somewhere around here.

299
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,083
They would be...

300
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,166
So long as we were
swift enough to save them.

301
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,958
But if every human
was returned to normal,

302
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:07,500
then why wouldn't
that be true for spirits?

303
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,833
Are you seeing this?

304
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,208
Yes.

305
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:14,750
[YUKINO] So this is it.
The real Celestial World.

306
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,000
It's just so beautiful.

307
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,291
[LOKE] Hey, what's up?

308
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,958
[PANTHERLILY]
Look! There they are!

309
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,208
[YUKINO] Pisces! Libra!

310
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,166
[LUCY]
You're all back to normal!

311
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,125
I wasn't sure I'd ever get
to see you like this again.

312
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,708
[LUCY] Virgo!

313
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,125
I'm so glad you're okay.
I missed you.

314
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,375
Well, thank you,

315
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,916
but I must admit that
your tears perplex me.

316
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,625
Did I miss something, Princess?

317
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:47,750
Sorry...

318
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,125
Never thought
I'd be this glad

319
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,458
to hear that word.

320
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,916
Seriously, though.
Do you not remember anything?

321
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,250
At first I was confused about

322
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,916
why you'd visit our
world for no reason,

323
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,166
but then I looked ya up and down

324
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,208
and realized you came by
to show off that bod.

325
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,166
Yeah, no.

326
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,708
How strange.

327
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,291
I didn't realize that there
was an impending celebration.

328
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,750
[NATSU] What's up, Loke?

329
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,791
Not a whole lot.
Long time no see, man.

330
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,583
[NATSU] Did you forget?
I saw you earlier today, dude.

331
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:14,958
You sure 'bout that?

332
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,125
So you don't remember
talkin' all high and mighty

333
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,916
about your spiritness
and avoidin' girls

334
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,166
like they're the plague?

335
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,875
No way. That's crazy.

336
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:26,125
Come now, I love women,
they love me. Right?

337
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,333
Whelp...

338
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,541
So much for rubbin' it
in his face that we won.

339
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,416
Yup.
We'll take the high road.

340
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,625
[ALL chattering]

341
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:39,750
[CELESTIAL SPIRIT KING]
Lucy Heartfilia. My old friend.

342
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,250
[LUCY] Your Majesty!

343
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,625
I guess you've forgotten
everything that happened, too.

344
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,625
[NATSU] Good to see ya,
mustache face!

345
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,500
By the way,
you nearly ate yourself!

346
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,833
[CELESTIAL SPIRIT KING]
Shards of memory.

347
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:58,750
Tattered recollections
of a black and vile dream.

348
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:02,666
And the few bits of cogent
thought that remain

349
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,250
slipped my mind
a few minutes ago.

350
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,666
I suppose that's
part of getting older.

351
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,166
[HAPPY]
Well he almost remembered.

352
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,416
[CELESTIAL SPIRIT KING]
However,

353
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,000
I need no memories
to sense that your arrival

354
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:17,708
and the destruction of my
black dream are intertwined.

355
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:21,458
And in the place of
whatever evil you've removed,

356
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,958
the white wind of
rejuvenation now soars

357
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,916
through my world.

358
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,791
The specifics are
of little consequence.

359
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:34,250
Let it suffice to say
I am deeply in your debt.

360
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:39,041
And I intend to repay
every last one of you.

361
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,583
[ARCADIOS]
Now's your chance, princess.

362
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:41,833
[HISUI] Agreed.

363
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,125
[HISUI]
Celestial Spirit King!

364
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,833
My name is Hisui E. Fiore
from the Kingdom of that name.

365
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,500
And as the princess
of that country--

366
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,666
No. As a celestial wizard
who failed her charge,

367
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,458
I offer you my deepest apology!

368
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:03,625
I was reckless.
And that nearly got you killed!

369
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,666
[CELESTIAL SPIRIT KING] Guilt
is for the selfish and craven.

370
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,875
You acted only to save

371
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,750
my old friend's world
from catastrophe.

372
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,291
Then you faced your
failures to the last.

373
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:16,541
There is no shame in that.

374
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:19,625
And do not hunt for
culprits in the shadows.

375
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,041
The fault in this
belongs to all.

376
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,166
For each of us
were held prisoner

377
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,000
by the frailty
of our own hearts.

378
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,000
[HISUI] But still...

379
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,458
[CELESTIAL SPIRIT KING]
Remember:

380
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:32,916
Even this took place beneath
the guidance of the stars.

381
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,958
Smile!

382
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,000
Right!

383
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,166
[CELESTIAL SPIRIT KING]
If you have no other business

384
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,041
that needs to be settled here,

385
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:46,708
then I shall return you to your
own world in no time at all.

386
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,375
[VIRGO] Princess...

387
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,708
[LUCY] Your key!

388
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,166
I got it back somehow,
but it belongs to you.

389
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,416
Please accept
my service once again.

390
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,000
[VIRGO] Thanks!
I hope you call upon me soon.

391
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,166
And if I'm ever
late to work, whip me.

392
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,291
Hey! You should
take back our key, too!

393
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,916
Call us anytime, okay?

394
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,291
Every one of us is
ready to rush to your side.

395
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,250
[SAGITTARIUS]
Yes indeedy, my good lady!

396
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,750
[TAURUS] You're hot
and a rockin' boss, too!

397
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,000
Since you've begun to weep,

398
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,166
I could recite a poem
to brighten your mood.

399
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,458
[LUCY] Thanks. I'm good.

400
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,791
Is everything okay?

401
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,750
[AQUARIUS] It's just that
if I'm gonna cause you trouble,

402
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,458
I'd like to remember.

403
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,458
[LUCY laughs]

404
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:30,500
[AQUARIUS]
I don't know what I did,

405
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:34,125
but I feel guilty. It's gross.

406
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,083
I don't think it'll stick.

407
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:42,875
Thanks a lot!

408
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,166
[LUCY]
Once we got back to Magnolia,

409
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,000
we found out that
every nearby instance

410
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,916
of problem weather
had suddenly stopped

411
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,583
in its tracks.

412
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,875
And it turned out that
when the Celestial Spirit King

413
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:01,250
said he'd get us
home in no time at all,

414
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:02,500
he meant it.

415
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:05,250
He dropped us off
at the exact time we left.

416
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,375
We all appreciated that.

417
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,416
[LUCY]
It was perfect.

418
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,833
Everyone was able
to make it back

419
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:15,666
to the times and
places they belonged.

420
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:20,250
Things calm down as fast
as they start around here.

421
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:24,000
In fact, for all the chaos
the eclipse spirits caused,

422
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,625
almost nothing
in our world changed.

423
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,208
Except for one thing.

424
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,625
[whimpering]

425
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,791
[LUCY] I wouldn't have thought
it was possible before,

426
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,625
but my love for
my spirits grew stronger!

427
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,833
Well? That true?

428
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,041
[HAPPY] Hey, Natsu!

429
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:15,708
How come we barely ever
get to hang out with Asca?

430
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:17,583
[NATSU] She's a busy girl,
but you're in luck!

431
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,458
Bisca came by and
asked us to watch her!

432
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,541
[HAPPY] No way!

433
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,833
She must've been
all kinds of desperate!

434
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:23,750
[NATSU] Asca's gonna
have the time of her life!

435
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:25,000
[HAPPY] You are good with kids.

436
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,500
[NATSU] Well yeah,
they look up to me!

437
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:27,541
[HAPPY] Yeah, right.

438
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:28,791
The only reason
little kids like you

439
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:30,583
is because you're
on the same level as them.

440
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:31,750
[NATSU] Hey now!

441
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,166
What the heck is that
supposed to mean?

442
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,708
[HAPPY, NATSU] Next Time:
What a Pure Heart Weaves!

443
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:37,375
[HAPPY] It means that I'll
look after both of you,

444
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:38,916
since I'll be
the only grownup there.

445
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,375
[NATSU] Asca's gonna
be a piece of cake

446
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:41,958
compared to raising you!
