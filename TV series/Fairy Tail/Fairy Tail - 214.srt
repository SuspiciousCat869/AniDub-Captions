1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,291
The snake charmer is
an absolutely vital part

2
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:25,875
of the zodiac.

3
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:29,416
So my true form is every bit as
majestic as that would entail.

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,458
In fact, the very place
known as the Astral Spiritus

5
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:35,125
is fully contained
within my body.

6
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,500
Everything that
has transpired so far

7
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,625
has been inside my body.

8
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:44,041
You coming here was by design,
a trap to lure you in.

9
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,583
[laughing evilly]

10
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,583
[LOKE] And now we can
perform the Liberam,

11
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:50,708
which will free us from the
human world once and for all!

12
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:53,333
There is nothing
you can do to stop us!

13
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,666
[OPHIUCHUS]
Oh, Celestial Spirit King.

14
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,666
I will not fail you!

15
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,375
[GRAY]
What was with the shaking?

16
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:33,625
Any ideas?

17
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,041
[GAJEEL] Nope, No clue.

18
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,250
[PANTHERLILY]
I'd like to know how we just

19
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,916
ended up here like this.

20
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,125
[GRAY] Hey! I think that's Erza!

21
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,708
You're here?
What is this place?

22
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,625
We're still trying
to figure that one out.

23
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,916
We all just showed up here,
same as you.

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,041
Maybe it's because we were all
able to complete our missions.

25
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,041
Well, we did manage
to close the spirits' gates

26
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,041
without a hitch.

27
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,000
I wish I
could be enthusiastic.

28
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,541
But I can't shake the feeling

29
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:01,916
that I missed seeing a rare
side of my popsicle prince.

30
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,791
Keep your
fantasies to yourself.

31
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,083
Guess this means yours truly

32
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,958
was the first one to
put a spirit in the dirt!

33
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,583
How's that for manly?

34
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:11,875
So pumped!

35
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,208
Way to go, Elfman!

36
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,833
I actually beat
Erza at something!

37
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,125
This is the happiest
day of my life!

38
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,750
Might not want
to say that too loud.

39
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,791
I wasn't aware
we were racing.

40
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,791
Closing the spirit gates
is a critical matter,

41
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,208
and making it out to
be a game is juvenile.

42
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,375
However,
if you're hell bent on

43
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,958
testing your
mettle against me,

44
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,166
I'd be happy to
put you in your place.

45
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:35,750
Okay, children.

46
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,708
Let's try to focus
on the task at hand.

47
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,083
[LEVY] So, how
was your battle, Erza?

48
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,208
Sagittarius was
a real challenge.

49
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,291
It was a tough fight and a
rather vigorous workout to boot.

50
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,500
Has there been any sign
of Natsu and his group?

51
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,291
We haven't seen them
or Lucy and Yukino

52
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,791
since we got here.

53
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,958
Huh...Then the only
gates left belong

54
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,458
to the Lion, the Maiden,
and the Balance.

55
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:58,666
Wherever Arcadios and
Hisui are, I hope they're safe.

56
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,791
And there's still the matter

57
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,958
of the tremendous
shaking from before.

58
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,916
[HAPPY] Natsu vs. Leo!

59
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,333
Look! The stars!

60
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,958
I think they're
constellations.

61
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,625
Okay. Yeah.

62
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,833
[WENDY] That's the Bull...

63
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,333
[WENDY] The Twins...

64
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,541
[WENDY] The Scorpion...

65
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,500
[WENDY] The Archer...

66
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,083
It's hard
to miss a giant Crab.

67
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,083
And if you connect
that one with those,

68
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:11,041
you get a couple of tasty tuna!

69
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,541
[CARLA] Simple minds
see simple things.

70
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:17,291
[CARLA] That's definitely
the Water Bearer.

71
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,250
And the one beneath it...

72
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,041
[CARLA]
...is the Goat!

73
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,250
Cool. How many is that?

74
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,875
If you count Aries,
there are nine total.

75
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:27,916
Wow...

76
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,166
Admiring your handiwork?

77
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,708
[NATSU] Huh?

78
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,750
[LOKE] Those constellations
belong to the Eclipse spirits

79
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,500
who were defeated
by your comrades.

80
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,916
Darkness, we beseech thee.

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,291
Envelop our light and swallow us
into your infinite shadow.

82
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:55,208
And sever the bonds that
shackle us to the heavens.

83
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,000
Hear me, Lord of the Night.

84
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,500
Release us from our
perpetual enslavement.

85
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,208
We long to be free
of our mortal bonds!

86
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,791
Look, pal,
I came here to rumble,

87
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,083
not listen to you ramble!

88
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,458
Liberam!

89
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,458
Give it a rest! It's over!

90
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,791
[LOKE] O, Lord of Darkness.
O, Lord of Stars.

91
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,666
O, Lord of Eternity!

92
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,791
We beg thee
hear our solemn prayers

93
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,000
and grant us liberation.

94
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,458
Release our spirits
into the infinity

95
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,541
of time and space!

96
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,958
How did he cast
the spell all by himself?

97
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,125
[laughing]

98
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,958
I have Ophiucus
to thank for this miracle.

99
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,875
[LOKE] She told me that
I could complete the Liberam

100
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,250
by sending out power
from this globe

101
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:55,416
and then channeling it
into the constellations.

102
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,625
I suppose that I should thank
you for making them appear.

103
00:06:58,708 --> 00:06:59,958
Is that true?

104
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,666
[CARLA] We worked so hard
to close their gates,

105
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,125
but we only managed
to make everything worse!

106
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,875
I feel like this
always happens, don't you?

107
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,583
See for yourselves, humans!

108
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:11,833
[LOKE] Our craving for freedom

109
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,750
can be seen even in the
brilliance of the stars!

110
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:15,958
But after twelve days of it,

111
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,083
you and your friends
will lose your lives!

112
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,750
Are you sure that kind
of sacrifice is worth it?

113
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,291
Like I said before,

114
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,041
there's no way humans could
possibly understand our torment!

115
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,000
Just like there's
no way you can stop me

116
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,250
from finishing
this sacred ritual.

117
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,625
We'll see about that!

118
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,333
[HISUI] What's happening?

119
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,250
Power is being sent
from the celestial globe

120
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,791
to those constellations.

121
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:46,958
They appear to belong to

122
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,916
the spirits that
have already been sealed.

123
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,291
If that's the case,

124
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:53,000
does this mean they
restarted the Liberam ritual?

125
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,208
As much as I
would hate to say it,

126
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,625
I believe so.

127
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,250
This isn't good.

128
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,791
Hold on,
that doesn't make sense.

129
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,541
How? Please, explain.

130
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,541
Think about what
they've done so far.

131
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,041
If they could get
the power they need

132
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:11,250
by sending it to
the constellations,

133
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,833
why would they
bother performing

134
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:17,375
the Liberam ritual inside the
Astral Spiritus to begin with?

135
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,041
Yes, I see.

136
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,625
Once they obtained
the celestial globe,

137
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,833
they could've returned
to the spirit world.

138
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,833
Without any humans
to hinder their plans,

139
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,791
they would have been enjoying
their freedom by now.

140
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,333
[HISUI]
It just doesn't add up.

141
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:32,041
Maybe Leo's had an
ulterior motive all along?

142
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,291
[ARCADIOS]
There's also the possibility

143
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,583
another power
is at play here.

144
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,375
One we're not aware of.

145
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:40,916
But who could it be?
This "other power"?

146
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,291
[OPHIUCHUS]
Oh, Celestial Spirit King.

147
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,541
I will not fail you!

148
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,583
Whatever we're facing,

149
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,291
our primary goal is still
stopping the Liberam ritual.

150
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,625
I agree.

151
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,250
Given the position
of Ras Algethi

152
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,208
near the head star of the
snake charmer constellation,

153
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:01,333
Natsu and the others
must be in this direction!

154
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,708
[yelling]

155
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,583
That's right.
Rush to your death!

156
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,541
It makes things easy!

157
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,500
Natsu, move!

158
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,083
Fire Dragon...

159
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,208
[LOKE] Pitch-Black...

160
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,750
Their flames
are gonna collide!

161
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,333
Get ready for
one heck of a show!

162
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,291
...Iron Fist!

163
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,375
...Hammer!

164
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,708
Where's your cat?

165
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,291
You'll have a hard time keeping
up without him carrying you.

166
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,125
After you sucker punched him?
I don't think so!

167
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,500
No way I'm putting him
through that again.

168
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,416
Besides, that dirty light
of yours might leave a stain.

169
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,458
This light
is the purest of all,

170
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:51,458
for it is fueled by
our desire for liberation.

171
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,625
Any stain it might leave

172
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,583
would still be cleaner
than you mortals.

173
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,125
Sure 'bout that?

174
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,541
'Cause from where I'm standin'
it's not lookin' very pure.

175
00:09:58,625 --> 00:09:59,875
[LOKE laughs]

176
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,083
[LOKE] I'll enjoy watching
the darkness take you.

177
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,583
Keep dreamin'!

178
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:04,666
Don't just stand there!

179
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,166
Grab the globe or something!

180
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,041
Oh, right.

181
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,125
[HAPPY] On it, sir!

182
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,500
[CARLA] Leave it to us!

183
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,041
No, you don't!

184
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,041
Hold it! We've got
our own party to tend to.

185
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,833
By the time I'm done,

186
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:23,250
that darkness of yours
will be burning bright again.

187
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,000
Here we go!

188
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,791
[growling]

189
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,750
[yelling]

190
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,250
Nobody said this
thing would fight back!

191
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,833
[CARLA] Is it attacking because
it sensed our intentions?

192
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,041
We have to get closer somehow!

193
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,375
Aye, Sir!

194
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:01,750
Oh, wow!

195
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,916
It took out an entire mountain!

196
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,791
That thing could
make fishing a breeze!

197
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,000
This is not the time

198
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,125
to be thinking with
your stomach, tomcat!

199
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,416
[WENDY] Look out!

200
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,083
[LOKE] You fool.

201
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,833
The light of Regulus
has been mine to command

202
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,916
since long before you were born.

203
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,791
This pitch-black darkness
has only added to my strength!

204
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,208
Your defeat is a certainty!

205
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:26,750
So come at me with
your feeble light, if you dare!

206
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,708
I thought you'd never ask!

207
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,500
Fire Dragon...

208
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,666
...Iron Fist!

209
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:38,333
What the--

210
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,250
My flame lost all its power!

211
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,958
It had none
from the start!

212
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,583
My darkness absorbs all light

213
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,125
and transforms it
into nothingness!

214
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,083
Now do you see
how helpless you are?

215
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,708
Your measly flames
could never hope

216
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,916
to pierce my pitch-black armor!

217
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,083
S'that a fact?

218
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:56,041
Fire Dragon... Talon!

219
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,541
That cheap trick
is getting old real fast.

220
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,625
I can take my turn,
if you like.

221
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,583
Of course, there's no guarantee
you'll be still be alive

222
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,833
to take yours once
the smoke has cleared.

223
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:08,958
Care to try?

224
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,625
[NATSU] Be my guest!

225
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,000
This is your
last chance to try again.

226
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,083
Just do it!

227
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,750
Pitch-Black... Punishment!

228
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:27,125
I knew I shouldn't expect
much from human garbage.

229
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,375
[NATSU grunting]

230
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,958
That's a good one!

231
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,125
If I'm nothing but garbage,

232
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,833
why couldn't you
take me out, Mr. Darkness?

233
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:43,041
Fire Dragon. Iron Fist!

234
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,541
What happened?

235
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:52,625
Dude. Come on.

236
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:53,875
After all that bragging,

237
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,750
I was hoping you might
actually be a challenge.

238
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,291
But you're just a pushover.

239
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,750
Learn your place
before I put you in your grave.

240
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,208
Can it, house-cat!

241
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,500
We both know my flames

242
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,500
are stronger than
your darkness will ever be.

243
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:08,583
[LOKE] Silence!

244
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:15,875
You might prove
more entertaining

245
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,083
than I initially thought, human.

246
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,958
I'm glad you're fired up.

247
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,125
We're almost there!

248
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,791
Stay strong!
I believe in you!

249
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,791
A little closer...

250
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,458
Just a little more!

251
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,000
We did it!

252
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,375
[screaming]

253
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,583
Oh no! Wendy!

254
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,291
[LOKE] Are you looking at
your helpless little friends

255
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,875
because you want to
join them in their misery?

256
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,708
My goodness!
Wake up, child!

257
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,250
Quit snoozing, tomcat!
Wendy needs our help, pronto!

258
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,500
I'm up, I'm u--
Wendy! We're coming!

259
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:00,958
[CARLA] Wake up, Wendy!

260
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:07,083
Yeah! Good catch! Nice!

261
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:10,125
Release our spirits
into infinite time and space!

262
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:13,208
Let the flames of darkness
burn away our celestial prison,

263
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,708
my star-bound brethren!

264
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,583
Let the holy black light
of Liberam

265
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,500
guide us to true freedom!

266
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,375
[LOKE] The time has come!

267
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:36,083
[whistle blows]

268
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,791
If you thought the
other punishments were bad,

269
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:38,958
try this one.

270
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,208
A gymnastics ring
and a vaulting horse?

271
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,166
What kind of ridiculous
torture is this?

272
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,333
Don't worry,

273
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,916
it'll make sense
once you're spread-eagle.

274
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,208
I preferred you
as a masochist!

275
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,750
[screaming]

276
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,166
What's with that weird light?

277
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,875
Did you finally decide
to dish out some punishment?

278
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,208
That's obviously not my magic!

279
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,583
I see.

280
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,166
Leo must have managed to
restart the Liberam ritual.

281
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,333
[LUCY] What? But how?

282
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,458
The vaulting horse
will just have to wait.

283
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:10,458
Now that my absolute
freedom is on the line,

284
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,375
I can't afford to play with you.

285
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,583
Virgo, if freedom is something

286
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,541
that's truly important
to you and the others,

287
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,708
I'll do everything
I can to help!

288
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:26,791
But there might be
some sort of ritual

289
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,958
that'll give you more
than twelve days to live!

290
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,583
Let's search for it together!

291
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,750
I told you before!

292
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,416
That's more than
enough time for us!

293
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,125
Please, just let
me save all of you!

294
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,958
I don't want you to die!

295
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,833
You're starting to have
trouble with your balance.

296
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,208
How long are we
going to do this?

297
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,708
Is it becoming too much
for you to handle?

298
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:01,375
Huh?

299
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,000
[LIBRA laughs]

300
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,541
[LIBRA] Staying in balance
is exhausting, isn't it?

301
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,083
And it's about
to get even harder.

302
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,208
Where is that
magic coming from?

303
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,708
[LIBRA] Leo has re-commenced
the Liberam ritual!

304
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:26,875
No!

305
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,458
That light must be
coming from the globe!

306
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:29,958
How strange.

307
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:34,291
I never imagined that this
would throw me off my balance.

308
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,750
[NATSU] Fire Dragon...

309
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,541
[LOKE] Pitch-Black...

310
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,500
...Roar!

311
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,375
...Roar!

312
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:54,708
It would seem
you're no match

313
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,916
for the power
of darkness after all.

314
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,916
Why don't you try using
your own moves, copycat?

315
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:05,000
Flame Lotus...
Exploding Flame Blade!

316
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,375
Pitch-Black
Exploding Flame Blade!

317
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:20,791
And there it is!

318
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,916
The crippling weakness
of all humans!

319
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,125
Do you sense it?

320
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,541
Even your flames
are fading to mere cinders!

321
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,000
What a pitiful sight!

322
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,333
You've been snuffed out.

323
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,750
You should give up while
you still have the chance.

324
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,583
Yeah?

325
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:37,375
Sorry, fleabag,
I'm a stubborn human.

326
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,958
And you've gotta
run out of fuel sometime.

327
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,541
I suppose that's true.

328
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,291
The light has always posed
a challenge to the darkness.

329
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:47,708
But the light fades, and the
pitch-black void keeps growing!

330
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:51,791
Soon my power will be as
limitless as the night sky!

331
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,958
Keep dreaming, psycho.

332
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,000
Oh, it's no dream, mortal.

333
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,875
[NATSU screams]

334
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,750
[CARLA] Oh! Wendy!
Are you all right?

335
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,916
Say something!

336
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,375
The celestial globe!

337
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,125
Happy's trying,
but his approach is a little

338
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,875
on the simple side.

339
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,708
[HAPPY yelling]

340
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,083
Eat rock!

341
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,875
[WENDY] Sky Dragon Roar!

342
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,791
Thanks for the save, Wendy!

343
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,625
I'll give you a fish once
I stop seeing six of you!

344
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,375
Hurry, Carla!

345
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:38,041
Get me back up to the Celestial
Globe as fast as you can!

346
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,166
But that thing
nearly killed you!

347
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,458
Natsu is putting his life
on the line for us.

348
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,541
I should, too.

349
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,208
I have to take the risk!

350
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,583
That doesn't mean
you should be reckless, child.

351
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,333
I'm not a child!

352
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,583
Okay, Wendy.

353
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,125
I want to get
up above that thing!

354
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,166
[CARLA]
You've got it! Here we go!

355
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,541
That's high enough!

356
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:03,666
What's the plan?

357
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,708
Jump!

358
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,583
Dragon Slayer Secret Art!

359
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,333
Shattering Light: Sky Drill!

360
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:12,666
[WENDY yells]

361
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,083
[CARLA, HAPPY] Wendy!

362
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,666
[WENDY] Thank you.

363
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,916
No use.

364
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,125
The only way we're
getting close to the globe

365
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:24,125
is by beating Loke,
and he's unstoppable!

366
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,500
That's enough!

367
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,500
Fire Dragon... Ro--

368
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,875
Is something the matter?

369
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,583
You're looking
weaker by the second.

370
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,291
Maybe it's because
every blow you dealt

371
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,958
allowed me to siphon
your flame bit by bit.

372
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,250
Now you're completely powerless!

373
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,208
May these black flames
cleanse us of our fates.

374
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,291
Their light
will merge with ours!

375
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,833
And grant us
truly divine radiance!

376
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:53,833
Such glory!

377
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,208
Our luster will grow!

378
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,000
Brighter and brighter
by the day.

379
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,375
Eternally!

380
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:01,250
[NATSU]
You just don't listen, do you?

381
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,916
Why do you persist
when it's obvious

382
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,416
that nothing can
hinder our freedom?

383
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,750
You know exactly
why I won't quit.

384
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,625
If you do this, Lucy'll cry.

385
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,875
There's no way
I'm letting that happen!

386
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,875
That's not our problem!

387
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,375
The tears of a human
mean less than nothing to us.

388
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,041
All we care about is liberty!

389
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,375
You pathetic mortals will
be consumed by time and space.

390
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,916
while we illuminate its splendor

391
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,875
long after you've
faded into memory!

392
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,875
Now vanish into my
Pitch-Black Darkness!

393
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,333
Since you've been stealing
my power this whole fight,

394
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,291
I'll just have to take it back.

395
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,625
You can go on and on about

396
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,875
controlling darkness
if that's what does it for you.

397
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,041
I don't give a crap.

398
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,208
[NATSU] Because no matter
what you think,

399
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,666
you're still our friend, Loke,

400
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,000
and Lucy needs you
to snap out of it!

401
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,166
Black Fire Dragon Mode!

402
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,375
Dragon Slayer Secret Art!

403
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:03,666
Pitch-Black
Exploding Flame Blade!

404
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,500
[LOKE screaming]

405
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:21,708
He pulled it off!

406
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:22,916
Heck yeah, he did!

407
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,958
It shouldn't
surprise us anymore.

408
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:47,625
This doesn't make sense!

409
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,541
Natsu just closed Loke's gate!

410
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,916
So how is the
Liberam still going?

411
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,958
This won't end well.

412
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,291
[HISUI]
Something is definitely odd.

413
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,125
Wasn't his gate closed?

414
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:01,291
The fact that Leo's
constellation is back proves it.

415
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:04,291
I should have known this
wouldn't be done so easily.

416
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:09,458
[OPHIUCHUS] Omnia... magna...
stella... rex prae.

417
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,791
Why is the snake chick
beltin' out a tune?

418
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,291
Can you tell what she's saying?

419
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,041
"Omelet, mackerel, and
some shellfish tempura to go".

420
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,500
It's still not the time
to think with your stomach!

421
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,916
It's never the
right time with you.

422
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,583
She's saying,
"Omnia magna stella rex prae."

423
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:28,416
"All for the sake
of the King of stars."

424
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,041
It can't be!

425
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:13,875
[NATSU] Jeez!

426
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15,958
For a giant snake,
Ophiucus has got some moves!

427
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:17,291
Right, Happy?

428
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:20,041
[HAPPY] Shh! Not so loud, Natsu!
I'm concentrating!

429
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,083
[NATSU] I gotta say...

430
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,083
I've never seen you
this serious.

431
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,000
[HAPPY]
That's because I'm having

432
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:24,166
an intense
internal dialogue

433
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,791
about her at this very moment.

434
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:27,708
[NATSU]
Internal dialogue? What for?

435
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:28,875
[HAPPY] To put it simply:

436
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,166
I'm wondering whether
I should treat her

437
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,875
like a snake or a fish.

438
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:33,458
[NATSU]
You have to think about it?

439
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:36,666
[HAPPY, NATSU] Next Time:
Ophiuchus, the Snake Charmer

440
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,083
[NATSU] So, did you decide yet?

441
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:39,166
[HAPPY] Hmm...

442
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,500
A snake, because
she doesn't look tasty!
