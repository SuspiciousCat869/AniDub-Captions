- Soldier:
IT'S BEEN CONFIRMED.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,375
THE HUMANS HAVE ATTACHED THE
SO-CALLED "DRAGON CHAIN CANNON"

26
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,041
TO THE FLOATING ISLAND HOLDING
THE LACRIMA, WITH THE INTENT

27
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:18,333
OF EMPLOYING IT AS A BOMB
AGAINST EXTALIA.

28
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:21,250
REGRETFULLY, I MUST ALSO REPORT
THAT SIR NICHIYA

29
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:24,125
AND HIS BATTALION HAVE BEEN
TRANSFORMED INTO LACRIMA.

30
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:25,833
THEY ARE CURRENTLY BEING
HELD HOSTAGE.

31
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:29,916
EXTALIA IS IN GRAVE DANGER.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,708
- THIS IS AN OUTRAGE.
- BARBARISM AT ITS FINEST.

33
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:37,125
- I NEVER THOUGHT THE HUMANS
WOULD RESORT TO SUCH METHODS.

34
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,000
- Soldier: ADDITIONALLY,
A FALLEN AND A HUMAN HAVE COME

35
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,166
TO TOWN URGING EVERYONE
TO ABANDON THEIR HOMES

36
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,958
AND EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY.

37
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,833
THE CITIZENS HAVE DISSOLVED
INTO A MOB.

38
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,375
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE US DO,
MY QUEEN?

39
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,083
- I WILL DEAL WITH THIS MATTER
PERSONALLY.

40
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,625
- YOUR HIGHNESS.
- YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS.

41
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,125
- WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO,
YOUR MAJESTY?

42
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:01,958
- IT'S TIME TO END THE CHARADE.

43
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:16,041
- GAJEEL.  QUICK!
USE YOUR DRAGON SLAYER MAGIC

44
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,666
TO SHATTER THE LACRIMA
AND TURN EVERYONE BACK.

45
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,333
- CAN'T.
NO TIME FOR THAT NOW.

46
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:24,583
THIS PUPPY'S SPEEDING UP.
- OH, NO!

47
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,500
- COME ON, LET'S GO!

48
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:32,708
IF WE CAN'T STOP IT,
EVERYONE WE KNOW WILL DIE.

49
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,916
- GIVE IT EVERYTHING
YOU'VE GOT.

50
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,708
- THIS WON'T WORK.  IT'S GOT
TOO MUCH MASS AND MOMENTUM.

51
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,166
- IF WE FALL, WE'LL DO SO
WITH THE REST OF MAGNOLIA.

52
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,875
- DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL SAVE YOU GUYS.

53
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,333
- ( screaming )

54
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,500
OUT OF MY WAY!

55
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,541
- NATSU.

56
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,750
I'M SORRY.

57
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,875
I DIDN'T MEAN--

58
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,750
- HUH?

59
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,208
GIVE ME A HAND, BUDDY,
WOULD YOU?

60
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:27,458
- AYE, SIR.

61
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:31,375
- ALL RIGHT, TEMPORARY TRUCE,
FURBALL.

62
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,708
- DON'T RUN FROM ME.
- WE'LL FINISH THIS.

63
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,708
JUST LET ME STOP THIS THING
FIRST.  THEN I'LL BEAT YOU.

64
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,750
- YOU CAN'T.  IMBECILE.

65
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,583
ONCE IT'S BEGUN,
THERE'S NO WAY TO STOP IT.

66
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,375
THIS IS THE END.

67
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,333
EDOLAS IS ABOUT
TO CHANGE FOREVER

68
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,791
AND NONE OF US WILL LIVE
TO SEE THE AFTERMATH.

69
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,583
- WRONG.  WE AIN'T DYING.

70
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,250
WHEN THIS IS OVER WITH,
YOU'RE COMING TO FAIRY TAIL.

71
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:58,541
YOU'LL BE MY CAT, EVEN IF I HAVE
TO DRAG YOU THERE. ( laughs )

72
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,625
- THEY'RE STILL GONNA COLLIDE.
- NO!

73
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:13,750
- GIVE IT ALL YOU'VE GOT.
- ( screaming )

74
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,708
IT'S NOT GONNA END THIS WAY!

75
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:30,083
DON'T GIVE UP.  WE CAN
STILL PUSH THIS THING BACK.

76
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:34,541
- AYE, SIR.
- ( grunting )

77
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,583
GAJEEL, WHY ARE YOU DOWN HERE?
YOU SHOULD BE USING YOUR MAGIC

78
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,333
TO TURN THE OTHERS BACK TO
NORMAL.  GET BACK UP THERE.

79
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,625
- IF YOU WANNA DEAL WITH
THE BLACK CAT, BE MY GUEST.

80
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,958
- WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO WORRY
ABOUT THE LACRIMA OR THE CAT

81
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,041
SO JUST PUSH.
- WE HAVE TO STOP IT

82
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,916
OR EVERYONE FROM MAGNOLIA
WILL BE LOST FOREVER.

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,333
- COCO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

84
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:58,291
- LILY.  OH, YOU'RE STILL
IN ONE PIECE.  I'M GLAD.

85
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,208
WHO NEEDS ETERNAL MAGIC POWER

86
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,625
WHEN YOU CAN HAVE
ETERNAL SMILES?

87
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,500
- WHAT KIND OF NONSENSE IS THAT?

88
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,125
YOU HAVE TO GET OUT
OF HERE, COCO.

89
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:09,125
THESE PEOPLE CAN'T STOP
EXTALIA'S DESTRUCTION.

90
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,583
- DON'T BE SO SURE.

91
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,708
IF THERE'S ONE THING FAIRY
TAIL WIZARDS ALWAYS PROVE,

92
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,916
IT'S THAT NOTHING'S IMPOSSIBLE.

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,125
- ( grunting )
AYE, AYE, SIR.

94
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,250
- LUCKY, WHAT IS THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

95
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:35,291
BUT IF IT RUINS MY CROPS,
THERE'LL BE HELL TO PAY.

96
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,000
- THE ROYAL ARMY
IS ATTACKING US.

97
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,541
- THEY CAN'T REALLY BE STUPID
ENOUGH TO REVOLT.

98
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:47,041
- THEY MUST NOT KNOW
OUR QUEEN'S TRUE POWER.

99
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,625
- I BET THE QUEEN'S GONNA USE
HER MAGIC ANY MINUTE NOW.

100
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,208
THE HUMANS ARE GONNA PAY.

101
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:54,083
- SHE BETTER DO IT SOON.
- NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF.

102
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,500
THE QUEEN WILL PUNISH
OUR ENEMIES.

103
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,708
- IT LOOKS LIKE THE LACRIMA
HIT THE ISLAND.

104
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,041
- IF THAT WERE THE CASE, I DOUBT
WE'D BE AROUND TO DISCUSS IT.

105
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,916
- I'M SO SORRY, CARLA.
THERE'S NOTHING WE COULD DO.

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,833
- THIS ISN'T OVER YET.
WE'RE NOT GIVING UP THAT EASILY.

107
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,375
- PLEASE LISTEN, EVERYONE.

108
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,000
- SO YOU'RE STILL HERE?
I'LL FIX THAT.

109
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,250
- OH!

110
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,458
- SIR NADI.
- CARLA.

111
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:25,833
- SIR,
THROWING ROCKS IS DANGEROUS.

112
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,916
SOMEBODY COULD GET HURT.

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,750
- YEAH, BUT SHE'S A FALLEN,
SO IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

114
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,458
- DON'T YOU REALIZE
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

115
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,666
THEY RISKED THEIR OWN SAFETY
TO WARN US OF THE DANGER.

116
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,458
WE FIND OURSELVES IN THIS MESS
BECAUSE WE IGNORED THEM.

117
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,041
- YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND, NADI.
- WE DON'T NEED THEIR HELP.

118
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,666
THE QUEEN'S GONNA DESTROY
THAT ISLAND AND ALL THE HUMANS.

119
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,625
- PLEASE, YOUR HIGHNESS.
HURRY!  SAVE US!

120
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:54,166
- EVERYONE,
PLEASE CALM YOURSELVES.

121
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,125
- SET ASIDE YOUR FEAR, NADI.
- ( gasps )

122
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,416
- IT'S THE QUEEN!

123
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,375
- WE'RE SAVED AT LAST.

124
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,125
- PRAISE HER.

125
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,500
- ALL HAIL HER MAJESTY.

126
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,291
- THAT'S REALLY HER?

127
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:27,666
- THANK YOU, BUT THIS IS NOT
THE TIME TO LOWER YOUR HEADS.

128
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,666
NOW THAT YOU'VE CALMED DOWN,

129
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,583
PLEASE LISTEN
TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.

130
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,250
- ANY IDEA WHY THE QUEEN WOULD
COME OUT OF HER CASTLE?

131
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,250
- PROBABLY SO WE CAN WATCH HER
USE HER AWESOME POWERS.

132
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,000
- SHUT YOUR TRAPS.

133
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:42,083
- EXTALIA IS TEETERING ON
THE EDGE OF TOTAL ANNIHILATION

134
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,875
THIS FATE MAY BE INESCAPABLE
FOR THE EXCEEDS.

135
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,125
AFTER MUCH SOUL SEARCHING,

136
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,000
I HAVE COME TO A FINAL DECISION
ON THE MATTER.

137
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,583
- YOU'RE GONNA DESTROY
THE HUMANS FIRST, RIGHT?

138
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:54,791
- BE QUIET AND LISTEN.
- ( gasps )

139
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,666
- WAIT, YOUR HIGHNESS, WHY ARE
YOU TAKING OFF YOUR ROBES?

140
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:05,375
- I HAVE DECIDED THAT IT IS TIME
FOR YOU TO FINALLY BE TOLD

141
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,416
THE TRUTH ABOUT YOUR QUEEN.

142
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,875
I AM JUST AN ORDINARY EXCEED,

143
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:13,958
NOT WORTHY OF YOUR WORSHIP
AS A QUEEN OR AS A GOD.

144
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:17,333
I'M NO BETTER THAN
THE REST OF YOU.

145
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,625
- NO, IT CAN'T BE TRUE.

146
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,458
- I'M SO SORRY,

147
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:24,166
BUT I DO NOT POSSESS THE POWER
TO FIGHT THE HUMANS.

148
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,166
AS YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE,
I WAS BORN WITH ONE WING.

149
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:32,375
FOR EXCEEDS, OUR MAGIC POWER
IS SYMBOLIZED BY OUR WINGS,

150
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,666
OR AERA, AND TWO WINGS
SIGNIFY ONE'S CONTROL

151
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,666
OF TRUE MAGIC POWER.

152
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,125
I LACK THAT POWER.

153
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,708
MY MAGIC IS WEAK.

154
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:44,708
I CAN NEVER ATONE
FOR MY DECEPTION.

155
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,708
YOUR NAMES ARE MISS WENDY
AND MISS CARLA, CORRECT?

156
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,833
MY DEEPEST APOLOGIES
TO YOU, AS WELL.

157
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:54,375
THIS IS ENTIRELY MY FAULT.
SO PLEASE DO NOT HARBOR

158
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,416
ANY ILL WILL TOWARDS
THOSE GATHERED HERE.

159
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,750
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

160
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,708
- NO, THE BLAME RESTS
WITH THOSE OF US WHO DARED

161
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:05,125
TO CONCOCT THE IDEA OF
AN EXCEED QUEEN TO BEGIN WITH,

162
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,958
YOUR HIGHNESS.

163
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:10,041
WE EXCEED HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
SMALLER AND WEAKER THAN HUMANS.

164
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,083
THEY TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF THAT FACT

165
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:15,166
AND DID TERRIBLE THINGS TO US
WHENEVER THEY GOT THE CHANCE.

166
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,875
SO TO PROTECT OURSELVES, WE MADE
HUMANS BELIEVE WE WERE DIVINE

167
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,375
AND CREATED AN ALL-POWERFUL
QUEEN TO SERVE AS THE EMBODIMENT

168
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,208
OF OUR MIGHT.

169
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:27,208
- Muganto: WE HAD TO RAISE THE
FRAGILE SPIRITS OF OUR PEOPLE.

170
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:30,625
SO WE REVEALED THE QUEEN
TO EXTALIA, AND CONVINCED THEM

171
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:34,083
THAT SHE POSSESSED
THE ALMIGHTY POWER OF A GOD.

172
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,041
- BUT HER DIVINE POWER
WAS AN ELABORATE BLUFF,

173
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:40,875
MAINTAINED BY A SELECT FEW
WHO WERE PRIVY TO THE TRUTH.

174
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,291
- Martam: IT TOOK SOME TIME,
BUT EVENTUALLY THE HUMANS WERE

175
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:46,166
SO TERRIFIED OF THE QUEEN'S
FICTIONAL POWERS,

176
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,958
THEY WOULDN'T EVEN LOOK AT
AN EXCEED FOR FEAR OF HER WRATH.

177
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,250
THE MOST PREVALENT
OF THEIR FEARS WAS THE IDEA

178
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,125
THAT SHE CHOOSES
WHICH HUMANS SHOULD BE KILLED.

179
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,791
IN TRUTH, NEITHER THE QUEEN
NOR ANY OF US

180
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,708
HAVE EVER POSSESSED THE POWER
TO DECIDE WHETHER ANOTHER BEING

181
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,958
WILL LIVE OR DIE.

182
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:06,500
THE ONLY THING WE HAVE
IS CHAGOT'S ABILITY TO SEE

183
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,125
INTO AN INDIVIDUAL'S
IMMEDIATE FUTURE.

184
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,666
SHE CAN SEE WHEN
A PERSON WILL DIE.

185
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,166
WE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT POWER,
AND MADE THE HUMANS BELIEVE

186
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,625
THAT PEOPLE PERISHED
ACCORDING TO HER WILL.

187
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,375
- ( crying )
NO, THAT CAN'T BE TRUE.

188
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,791
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

189
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,208
- OUR QUEEN IS A GOD.
THERE'S NO WAY SHE'S NOT.

190
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,750
- STOP LYING AND DEFEAT
THE HUMANS BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

191
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:33,416
- DECEITFUL NONSENSE.
- CARLA!

192
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,791
- WHETHER YOU HAVE POWER
OR NOT MEANS NOTHING TO ME.

193
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,166
WHAT MATTERS IS THAT YOU ORDERED
MY FRIENDS TO BE KILLED.

194
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,000
THAT IS AN UNDENIABLE FACT.

195
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:43,708
- CHAGOT GAVE NO SUCH ORDERS.
IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE HUMANS

196
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,125
EXPLOITING THE LEGEND
OF THE QUEEN'S POWER--

197
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,583
- BE QUIET!
YOU PLANTED FALSE MEMORIES

198
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,958
AND ORDERED ME
TO SLAUGHTER MY CLOSEST FRIEND.

199
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,750
UNTIL A FEW DAYS AGO,
I'D NEVER EVEN SEEN MY HOMELAND.

200
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,708
YOU TOOK MY LIFE FROM ME.

201
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,583
- I'M SORRY.

202
00:11:56,666 --> 00:12:00,625
- WAIT, IT'S AN INCREDIBLY LONG
AND COMPLICATED STORY.

203
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,750
- YOUR EXCUSES WON'T HELP
THE DAMAGE THAT'S BEEN DONE.

204
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:07,500
- Wendy: I DON'T THINK THIS
IS THE TIME TO FOCUS ON THAT.

205
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,666
- ( gasping )

206
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,291
- Queen: YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY
CORRECT, CARLA.

207
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,375
MY SINS ARE MANY AND YOUR
SUFFERING IS AMONG THEM.

208
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,041
YOU'VE DONE NOTHING,

209
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,583
YET I'VE PUT YOU THROUGH MORE
PAIN THAN ANYONE.

210
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:27,583
- NO, YOUR HIGHNESS.

211
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,791
- TO ATONE, YOU PERSONALLY
CARRY OUT MY PUNISHMENT.

212
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,541
PLEASE,
PUNISH ME FOR MY CRIMES.

213
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,333
AS A FRIEND TO BOTH HUMANS
AND EXCEEDS,

214
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:50,541
YOU MORE THAN ANYONE HAVE
THE RIGHT TO CARRY IT OUT.

215
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,500
- CARLA.

216
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:57,208
- MY QUEEN, YOU CAN'T DIE.
- WE FORGIVE YOU, YOUR MAJESTY.

217
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,833
- NOW, PLEASE.  EVERYONE
SHOULD LEAVE IMMEDIATELY

218
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,291
I WILL JOIN EXTALIA IN ITS RUIN.

219
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:09,083
YOU MUST LIVE ON AND THRIVE.

220
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,625
- STOP!
YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH WITH THIS.

221
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:15,666
- ( crying )
- I DON'T WANNA LEAVE.

222
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,208
- YEAH.
- I'M STAYING HERE, TOO.

223
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,000
- THE EXCEED WILL VANISH
INTO HISTORY NOW.

224
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,083
- THAT'S WHY THE QUEEN DECIDED

225
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,958
TO REVEAL EVERYTHING.

226
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,666
- IF HER MAJESTY'S STAYING HERE,
THEN SO AM I.

227
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,083
- I'LL STAY WITH YOU TILL
THE END, YOUR HIGHNESS.

228
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:33,958
- SAVE YOURSELVES AND ALLOW ME
TO BEAR THIS PUNISHMENT ALONE.

229
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,625
- CARLA, NO!

230
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,750
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

231
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,166
HOW CAN YOU GIVE UP SO EASILY?

232
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:56,666
THIS IS YOUR HOMELAND,
ISN'T IT?

233
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,666
DO YOU SERIOUSLY NEED A GOD
OR QUEEN TO GET ANYTHING DONE?

234
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,333
YOU'VE HELD ON FOR DEAR LIFE
ALL THIS TIME,

235
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,500
EVEN IF IT MEANT RESORTING
TO LIES.

236
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:07,708
AFTER ALL THAT, YOU'RE JUST
GOING TO LIE DOWN AND DIE?

237
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:11,125
IT'S OKAY IF YOU'RE WEAK.
IF YOU ALL WORK TOGETHER,

238
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,750
THERE IS NO LIMIT
TO WHAT YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH.

239
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:17,416
EXTALIA CAN'T DISAPPEAR.

240
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,291
I'VE FINALLY COME HOME.

241
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,333
AFTER ALL THIS, I CAN'T
LET IT BE DESTROYED.

242
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:32,000
I'M GOING TO SAVE EXTALIA
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU.

243
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,708
- CARLA!

244
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,916
- RIGHT.  I'M GOING TO
DO EVERYTHING I CAN.

245
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,500
- NADI.

246
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:52,791
- BECAUSE I'M A CITIZEN
OF EXTALIA.

247
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,833
- ( screaming )

248
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,291
- IT'S GETTING
PRETTY TIGHT HERE.

249
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,375
- ( grunting )

250
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,000
- JUST KEEP PUSHING, GUYS.

251
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:08,875
- USE EVERY OUNCE
OF POWER YOU GOT LEFT.

252
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,416
- THEY MUST BE MAD.

253
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,958
DO THEY HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT
THEIR HUMAN STRENGTH ALONE

254
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:19,208
CAN PREVENT THIS MASSACRE?

255
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,500
- CARLA, IT'S YOU.
- I'M NOT GIVING UP.

256
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,208
I'LL PROTECT FAIRY TAIL
AND EXTALIA.

257
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:31,416
I CAN'T JUST WATCH
MY HOMES BE DESTROYED.

258
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,125
- ( screaming )
- HUH?

259
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,208
- WHY ARE YOU HERE?

260
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,875
- BECAUSE I WANT TO PROTECT
MY HOME AS WELL.

261
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,333
YOUR COURAGE INSPIRED ME.

262
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,708
- WHAT IS THIS?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

263
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,916
- THEY ALL CAME.

264
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,375
- EXCEEDS AREN'T AFRAID TO
PROTECT OUR LAND WITH OUR PAWS.

265
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,541
- THIS IS FOR OUR BELOVED QUEEN,
WHO WAS WILLING TO GIVE HER

266
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:23,375
OWN LIFE TO PROTECT EXTALIA
AND ITS CITIZENS.

267
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,083
- AND FOR WENDY AND CARLA,

268
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,916
WHO RISKED THEIR LIVES
TO SAVE US FROM OURSELVES.

269
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,333
- HERE GOES.  EVERYONE GET READY
TO PUSH WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT.

270
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:33,583
- CHAGOT,
YOUR WING IS TOO FRAGILE.

271
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,416
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

272
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,291
- NO.  MY FATE WILL BE
THE SAME AS MY PEOPLE.

273
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,166
WE SURVIVE OR FALL AS ONE.

274
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,666
- MA, I THINK I'M HALLUCINATING.

275
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,458
- EVERYONE IN EXTALIA
HAS COME TOGETHER.

276
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,666
- LILY, WHAT POSSESSED YOU
TO SAVE A HUMAN CHILD?

277
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,750
- IF I HADN'T,
HE WOULD HAVE PERISHED.

278
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:09,666
- HOW FOOLISH.  YOU BROUGHT
SUCH RABBLE INTO EXTALIA.

279
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,583
IT TURNS MY STOMACH.

280
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,916
- I CANNOT IGNORE ANY CREATURE
WHO HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY WOUNDED.

281
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,250
- HAVE THE RULES OF OUR QUEEN
COMPLETELY SLIPPED YOUR MIND?

282
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:22,333
- YOU'RE HEREBY DEEMED A FALLEN
AND EXILED FROM EXTALIA FOREVER.

283
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,958
- EXILED?
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

284
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,791
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
DON'T FEEL GUILTY.

285
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,708
YOU'RE NOT TO BLAME FOR MY
PEOPLE'S SHORTSIGHTEDNESS.

286
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,875
NOW THE FIRST THING IS GET
YOU BACK TO YOUR HOMELAND.

287
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,541
- YOUR MAJESTY!
- ( screaming )

288
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,500
- ( gasps ) PANTHERLILY.

289
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,750
- ( laughs )

290
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,250
- TELL ME YOUR MAJESTY.

291
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,500
HAVE YOU FINALLY GROWN WEARY
OF LYING?

292
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:20,041
- I'M SO SORRY I'VE HURT YOU.

293
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,291
- YOU KNOW, NO MATTER

294
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,708
HOW MUCH I TRIED TO HATE IT,

295
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,625
EXTALIA IS STILL MY HOMELAND.

296
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,125
- LILY.

297
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,958
- BUT IT'S NO USE NOW.

298
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:37,041
EVEN WITH ALL THESE EXCEEDS
WORKING TOGETHER,

299
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:40,166
THERE'S NO STOPPING IT.
FORGIVE ME, PLEASE.

300
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,000
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

301
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,625
IT DIDN'T HAVE TO HAPPEN.

302
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,958
I COULD HAVE STOPPED THE HUMANS,
BUT I DID NOTHING.

303
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,875
- DON'T WORRY.

304
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,958
I'M CERTAIN THAT
YOUR WORDS WILL REACH THEM.

305
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,916
- JUST KEEP PUSHING!

306
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,916
- ( grunting )
- GIVE IT YOUR ALL, GUYS.

307
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,708
- PUSH.
- WE CAN DO IT!

308
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:08,333
- THIS WON'T BE THE END OF US.

309
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:11,791
- QUITTING IS NOT AN OPTION,
NOT FOR FAIRY TAIL.

310
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,625
- WE WILL STOP IT,
NO MATTER THE COST.

311
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,375
- LET'S PUSH TOO, LUCKY.
- AYE, SIR.

312
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,916
- ( screaming )

313
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,250
- AYE, SIR!

314
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,625
- All: AYE, SIR!

315
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,833
- THIS IS IT.
GIVE IT YOUR ALL!

316
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,000
- THEY'VE ACTUALLY PUSHED THE
LACRIMA A SAFE DISTANCE AWAY.

317
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,000
- WHAT NOW?

318
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,500
- ( screaming )

319
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:31,083
- ( gasps )
DID WE WIN?

320
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,375
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

321
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,291
- THE LACRIMA.

322
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,916
- IT DISAPPEARED.
DOES THAT MEAN--

323
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,125
- WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL
OF OUR FRIENDS?

324
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:04,125
DO YOU THINK THEY'RE--

325
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:08,416
- Mystogan: DON'T WORRY
THEY'RE ALL SAFE AND SOUND.

326
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,125
- Erza: MYSTOGAN.

327
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:13,291
- SORRY, BUT FINDING
AN ADEQUATE ANIMA VESTIGE

328
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:16,375
TO RESTORE EVERYTHING TOOK
A BIT LONGER THAN I THOUGHT.

329
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:19,125
WITHOUT YOUR EFFORTS, I NEVER
WOULD HAVE MADE IT IN TIME.

330
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:22,125
YOU HAVE MY GRATITUDE.
- ( laughs )

331
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,750
- EVERYBODY'S BACK TO NORMAL?
- YES.

332
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,125
BY PASSING THROUGH
THE ANIMA AGAIN,

333
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:31,166
THE LACRIMA WILL RETURN TO ITS
ORIGINAL FORM IN EARTH LAND.

334
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,625
IT'S FINALLY OVER.

335
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,166
- WE REALLY DID IT?
- WELL, I'LL BE.

336
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,166
WE SAVED EXTALIA
WITH OUR VERY OWN PAWS.

337
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,625
- ( laughing )
- ( cheering )

338
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,166
- GREAT JOB, EVERYBODY.
- LILY.

339
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,250
LONG AGO, YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

340
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:57,333
I'M GLAD THAT I COULD RETURN
THE FAVOR TODAY.

341
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,000
- YES,

342
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,166
AND I COULDN'T BEGIN
TO THANK YOU,

343
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,000
MY PRINCE.

344
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,208
- OUR LONG LOST PRINCE
IS HOME AT LAST.

345
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,625
- HE'S WHAT?

346
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:22,000
- ( gasps, screaming )

347
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:24,875
- ( all gasp )
- NO, NOT MY CAT.

348
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,125
- LILY!

349
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:36,208
- WE'RE NOT DONE HERE.

350
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:39,333
DESTROY EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM.

351
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:42,875
- ( theme music playing )

352
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,875
- Natsu: HAPPY, LOOK.

353
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15,375
THERE'S SOME KIND OF
FAKE DRAGON THING HERE.

354
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:17,583
WHAT DID THAT CRAZY
DAPHNE LADY CALL IT?

355
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:20,375
A HEMORRHOID?
- Happy: "DRAGONOID," DOOFUS.

356
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:23,041
BUT THIS THING LOOKS DIFFERENT
THAN DAPHNE'S MONSTER.

357
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,750
- IT'S JUST ANOTHER DRAGON
WANNABE.

358
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:27,333
I'LL TRASH IT LIKE THE LAST ONE
AND CALL IT A DAY.

359
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:29,458
- I DON'T LIKE HOW THIS THING
JUST CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.

360
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:30,625
IT'S FISHY.

361
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:36,625
- WHAT THE HECK?  MY MAGIC ISN'T
WORKING ON THIS THING.

362
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,625
- WHOA!
IT'S CHANGING COLORS.

363
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:41,583
- THIS ISN'T A DRAGON HUNT.
IT'S A CHAMELEON HUNT.
