1
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,500
Can I get you some
water or anything?

2
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,875
I'm fine. Thanks.

3
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:39,916
[HOTEYE]
Hmm.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,083
His eyes.

5
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,750
[HOTEYE]
His eye injuries aren't severe.

6
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:46,375
He should be able to
see again before long.

7
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:50,083
That said, many of his other
injuries are far more serious.

8
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:53,208
He fought four members
of the Oración Seis alone.

9
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:56,125
He can't have expected to
come out of that unscathed.

10
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,875
Yeah, I guess not.

11
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,666
Looks like it's
headin' straight for us.

12
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,333
I don't suppose you'd want to
hole up in there with Jellal.

13
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,583
[RACER]
Don't be stupid.

14
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,125
[ANGEL] Should we find
a different house then?

15
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,708
There are plenty around.
This place is a ghost town.

16
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,291
That's not what I'm gettin' at.

17
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,500
This storm's our chance
to make some distance.

18
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:57,625
It could very well be, but
where do you think we should go?

19
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:00,791
[RACER] Long as it ain't here?
I couldn't care less.

20
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,250
[RACER]
Come on!

21
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,666
What? Is freedom
too much for you?

22
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,000
Can't handle the idea
of not havin' a boss?

23
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:20,875
[ANGEL]
No, but--

24
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,208
"No but," what?

25
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:25,541
We just got outta jail.
And we got free of Brain.

26
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,708
Finally, no one
tells us what to do.

27
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,541
You already wanna give
that up? Cobra, talk to 'em.

28
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,500
We have no boss, remember?

29
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,166
You don't choose for her.

30
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,500
Fine. What about you, Midnight?

31
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:39,833
[RACER]
Hey.

32
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,333
[RACER] Hey! Somethin'
wrong with your ears?

33
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,458
Stop runnin' your
damn mouth, Racer.

34
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:52,916
It'll force you
to think for once,

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,458
and you might actually like it.

36
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,250
[RACER]
I'll shut up when I'm finished.

37
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:56,833
Now listen--

38
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,958
I've decided.

39
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,083
I'm joining Crime Sorciere.

40
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,083
You're swapping one
master for another?

41
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:06,083
At least give freedom
a try. We don't need him.

42
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,916
We've been imprisoned in
some way our whole lives.

43
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,625
We don't owe this world jack.
Think about what it did to us.

44
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,166
[ANGEL]
I've thought this through.

45
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,250
And I'll be going with Jellal.

46
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,833
[RACER]
Nothin' to say, boys?

47
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,625
Heh, I get it.

48
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,208
Well, suit yourselves.

49
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,041
As for me--

50
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,791
[MIDNIGHT]
Never again.

51
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:35,250
I'll never be a pawn in
someone else's game again.

52
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,041
I'll live and die just
as free as I am now.

53
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,166
There we go!

54
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,458
[MIDNIGHT]
But.

55
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,916
[RACER] Ever tell ya
how much I hate that word?

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,541
[COBRA laughing]

57
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,291
[RACER]
You laughin' at me?

58
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:50,375
Naw. I just heard a voice
from old times is all.

59
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,458
Hey, there. Thought
you'd kicked the bucket.

60
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:54,375
[RACER gasps]

61
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,791
[RUSTY]
Is that so?

62
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,708
I'd accuse you of faithlessness,

63
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,208
but I thought you'd
be in prison right now,

64
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,625
and for the rest of your
lives, for that matter.

65
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:06,125
So, what brings the
Oración Seis here?

66
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,500
[RACER]
Rusty?

67
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,625
[ANGEL] You were with
Grimoire Heart's Seven Kin.

68
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,958
Rustyrose! Is that really you?

69
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,208
[RUSTY]
You're here, Meldy?

70
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,166
Where have you been?
Why are you with them?

71
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,875
It's hard to explain. You look
terrible, what happened?

72
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,166
Trust is like iron,

73
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,250
for if it's neglected,
it corrodes over time.

74
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,500
I'm leaving.

75
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:29,500
[MELDY]
No, wait! Stay a while, please!

76
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,333
I no longer have
business with you.

77
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,791
I know.

78
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,708
But could you talk to me,
for old times sake?

79
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,041
[RUSTY]
Hmph.

80
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:43,000
The past is dead. Bury it.

81
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,458
Slow it down.

82
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:48,000
Your old friend's not the only
one who's got questions.

83
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:52,083
Somethin's got ya scared,
Rusty. It's in your voice.

84
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,958
And I never took you
for a pushover, so,

85
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,166
I'd like to know what that is.

86
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,125
Now talk.

87
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,833
[MELDY] Wait. Is this
what I think it is?

88
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,583
Doesn't feel like I have
much of a choice here.

89
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:10,000
Well, you have two options.

90
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,708
One just sucks.

91
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,875
[RUSTY]
I've been to Tartaros.

92
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:19,250
[COBRA] Tartaros?
With the Nine Demon Gates?

93
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,958
[RUSTY] Well, yes, but that
guild is more than it appears.

94
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,000
[JELLAL]
Hm?

95
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:32,833
Seven years ago, after we lost
to Fairy Tail on Tenrou Island,

96
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:36,041
Hades, Kain, and
I tried to escape.

97
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:40,333
That's when Zeref appeared.
The rest followed quickly.

98
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:43,166
Master Hades was killed
before my eyes.

99
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,541
I was knocked unconscious.
Woke up drifting in the sea.

100
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,916
Obviously, I managed to survive,

101
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,958
but I couldn't find
my old guildmates.

102
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:55,250
I wandered everywhere,
searching. Trying to heal.

103
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,666
So you never found Kain?

104
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,125
[RUSTY] No, I don't know
where he is or what he's doing.

105
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:05,375
Hell, I don't even know
if he survived that mess.

106
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,833
I see.

107
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,208
[RUSTY] The Baram Alliance
was the political spine

108
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,583
of the Dark Guilds.

109
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:14,625
Between our factions and
Tartaros, there was balance.

110
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,541
But Grimoire got
its heart cut out.

111
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,791
Its body scattered to the winds.

112
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,625
And your whole guild was
tossed into some dungeon.

113
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:25,041
Which left Tartaros, and a
power vacuum the size of Fiore.

114
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,291
What exactly are
you tryin' to say?

115
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,708
Everywhere I traveled,

116
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,750
I was followed by a rumor
I didn't want to believe.

117
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,875
The Dark Guilds that had
once followed Grimoire

118
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,916
were being annihilated,
one by one.

119
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,541
The fatality rate from these
attacks made one thing clear.

120
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,125
Tartaros was responsible.

121
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,333
[SOLDIER A]
At your stations!

122
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,166
[SOLDIER B]
Who are you people?

123
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,541
[RUSTY] No one. Just a few
messengers of darkness.

124
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,125
We came here in the hopes

125
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,750
we could meet with the leaders
of Tartaros, if they're free.

126
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,750
[SOLDIER C]
Messengers of darkness?

127
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,625
Identify yourselves at once!

128
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,208
We're men who don't take
questions from cowardly dogs

129
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:12,625
that turn on their allies the
moment they sense weakness.

130
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,583
[ZANCROW] Look, we've got no
interest in you minion types.

131
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,875
But we're in a pretty crap mood,
and you're in our way.

132
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:19,916
[SOLDIER D]
Kill 'em!

133
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,250
[SOLDIER E]
No one gets through!

134
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,333
Well, I suppose that this
gate is as good a place

135
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,291
for you to die as any.

136
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,000
Bleve.

137
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,750
I was hopin' I could save
all this rage for your bosses,

138
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,291
but screw it.

139
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,541
Flame God Bellow!

140
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,583
[SOLDIERS yelling]

141
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:43,125
Ha! That was like
stompin' on maggots!

142
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,500
I can't even call
that a warm-up.

143
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,750
[SOLDIER F] You. Why are
you here? Who are you?

144
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,250
We're from Grimoire Heart.
Your former confederates.

145
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,666
Bleed quick now!

146
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,958
Forgive us, we're unaccustomed
to such churlish visits.

147
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,458
That this may be,

148
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:08,416
but it doesn't hold a candle
to the cannibalistic attacks

149
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,625
you've been launching
on the guilds beneath you.

150
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:11,708
[KYOKA]
Hm.

151
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,083
Let us introduce ourselves.

152
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:17,541
I am Kyoka, one of Nine
Demon Gates of Tartaros.

153
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,958
And I am called Rustyrose.
I am one of the Seven Kin.

154
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,541
We belong to a member guild
of the Baram Alliance.

155
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,958
Grimoire Heart.

156
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,041
My name is Azuma.

157
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,583
Mine's Zancrow.

158
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:33,125
[KYOKA] You're from Grimoire
Heart? Of the Baram Alliance?

159
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,916
Both the alliance and that guild
are long forgotten relics.

160
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,041
You having trouble
with your eyes?

161
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,541
I'll give ya the
"forgotten" bit,

162
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:44,166
but if we're a relic, then
what killed all your guards?

163
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,791
[KYOKA]
Three bitter failures.

164
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,958
The Baram Alliance is gone.

165
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:53,416
It dissolved when Tartaros
became the last guild standing.

166
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,583
What do you mean
"last guild standing"?

167
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,875
We're standin' right
in front of ya!

168
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:01,041
Tell me something. Do you
know what you've done?

169
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,666
Did you willfully violate

170
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,291
the most basic
principle of alliance?

171
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,125
Am I on trial, then?

172
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,708
The verdict is in.

173
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,583
You've assaulted our
subordinate guilds, one by one.

174
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,875
You killed most and
abducted the rest

175
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,083
for Zeref knows what purpose.

176
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,708
This treachery begs vengeance.

177
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,500
[KYOKA chuckles]

178
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,125
[KYOKA] I'm quite busy. If it's
appeasement you're after,

179
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,166
I suggest you look elsewhere.

180
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,125
I've neither the time
nor interest needed

181
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,291
to continue this little talk.

182
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,666
[chuckles]

183
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,458
We didn't come here to talk.

184
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,625
But you already knew that.

185
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,208
That takes some guts, stormin'
Tartaros just the three o' ya.

186
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,666
Guts or insanity,
I'm not sure which one.

187
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,791
I don't get it.
How could those two--?

188
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:02,166
So, could someone wake me up
once Rusty's finished bragging?

189
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,625
That sass needs an off
switch. Just ignore her.

190
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,750
Go on. What happened next?

191
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,583
I'm listening.

192
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,500
Your guild is at fault for
the broken peace between us.

193
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,291
To restore it, you must
first make reparations.

194
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,916
[KYOKA]
Really? Must I?

195
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,958
[RUSTY] Children fear no
flame till they get burned.

196
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,708
That's why you must pay
for what you've done

197
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,916
to prove you won't repeat it.

198
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,875
Hm. And what's your price?
You have me curious.

199
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:37,541
We want half of the dark guild
members you abducted returned.

200
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,833
As a show of our goodwill,
we ask nothing for the dead.

201
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:44,000
I was against offerin' your
guild a deal in the first place.

202
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:47,625
But the sooner we're out of here
the better, so just take it.

203
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,166
[KYOKA]
Hmm.

204
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,750
[RUSTY] All things considered,
this is a lenient offer.

205
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,000
Agree to our demand,

206
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,750
and the Baram Alliance
could live once more.

207
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,541
That's quite enough.

208
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,208
[KYOKA]
You pitiful fool.

209
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,250
How dare you.

210
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,041
[RUSTY groaning]

211
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,208
What did you do to him?

212
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,458
I hope you're ready
to fight a real war!

213
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,375
The art of enhancing human pain

214
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,041
grants such a sense
of exhilaration.

215
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,125
[yelps]

216
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,750
My comrades.

217
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:26,958
[yelps]

218
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,375
The Arc of Embodiment, correct?

219
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,583
What a desperate ploy.

220
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:41,666
Grimoire Heart's
a relic after all.

221
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,166
Rise from the underworld!

222
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,750
My Jet Black Sword that
cleaves through all!

223
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:56,083
[screaming]

224
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:01,958
Who is that man?

225
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,416
Disgusting. Begone.

226
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,458
[RUSTY screaming]

227
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:13,083
[KYOKA] Zeref's return
is quite close at hand.

228
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:18,500
And the beginning of his new era
shall mark the end of mankind's.

229
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,666
[KYOKA] Why so scared?
You've nothing to lose.

230
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,041
So utterly broken.
You're not worth torturing.

231
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:33,333
Scurry on home with
your imaginary friends.

232
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,500
[RUSTY] There's more in Tartaros
than the Nine Demon Gates.

233
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:45,708
I saw something there, in the
shadows. Something far worse.

234
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,625
[COBRA]
That's a strange story.

235
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,291
Wish I cared.

236
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,375
[JELLAL] She said Zeref
was coming, did she?

237
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:58,875
Said it with certainty.

238
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,708
Meaning that Tartaros is trying
to make contact with him?

239
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,500
You'll have to find
out for yourself.

240
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,833
I'd rather face the fires
of hell than that one again.

241
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,583
Good talk. Guess I'll
see you around.

242
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,500
Wish I'd known.

243
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,750
I'm heading out.
To find Tartaros.

244
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,000
No, you can't.

245
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:29,375
You're in no condition
to travel, or to fight.

246
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:34,375
That may be true.
Still, I must do this.

247
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,875
There's no choice.

248
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:40,416
[MIDNIGHT] We won't go with you.
Not to attack Tartaros.

249
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,833
[MIDNIGHT] They may have broken
their pact with Grimoire Heart,

250
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,375
but they haven't with us.

251
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,791
We gave our word that
we wouldn't attack them.

252
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,916
Even now, that word is binding.

253
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,958
[MELDY] That's where you
draw your "moral" line?

254
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,750
Our guild may
have been unlawful,

255
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,458
but for all our
many transgressions,

256
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,958
never once did we betray a pact.

257
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:05,333
We won't forsake the one
source of integrity we had.

258
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:10,791
[JELLAL] That's disappointing,
but I must go regardless.

259
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:14,083
Even if that means I go alone.

260
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:18,041
For now, I'll say farewell,
but I will come for you again.

261
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,500
I swear it.

262
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,375
Careful, there're lots
of roots to trip on.

263
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,375
Thank you.

264
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,208
[MELDY]
So, I was wondering.

265
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,666
[JELLAL]
Mm?

266
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,208
[MELDY] Why do you care so
much about the Oración Seis?

267
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:47,000
Is it because of something
Doranbolt said?

268
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:51,041
They're all prisoners.

269
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,875
They were captured as children.

270
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,083
Held against their will
in the Tower of Heaven.

271
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,625
Their circumstances are my own.

272
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,416
That's where the seeds
of our sins were planted.

273
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,166
That's where we lost
our childhoods together.

274
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:08,041
[JELLAL] No matter what,
there's some part of each of us

275
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,250
that will always be
locked in that tower.

276
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,500
That bond is irrevocable.

277
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,875
None of us who shed sweat
and blood in that place

278
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,041
would deny it.

279
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,333
No, not even Sawyer.

280
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:21,666
You share that pain,
that burden.

281
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,458
[JELLAL] Pain and prayers
were all we had there.

282
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:27,541
The Seis prayed for Nirvana to
take the darkness of their lives

283
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,083
and give them light.

284
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:32,541
Nirvana's spell has faded.
Their prayers remain.

285
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,916
[MELDY]
What prayers?

286
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,208
[JELLAL] Richard prays
to find the brother he lost

287
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:40,625
when he was first taken to
the Tower all those years ago.

288
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:45,750
Sawyer prays to be so fast
he can never be caught again.

289
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:51,208
Sorano prays to be free of this
earth, to vanish into the sky.

290
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:54,291
Erik, he prays to hear
the voice of the one friend

291
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:58,083
who might listen to his story.

292
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:01,916
And Macbeth, he prays
to sleep quietly,

293
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,958
in a world that rings
with screams and sobbing.

294
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,583
Their prayers granted
them great power.

295
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,250
Zero twisted that.

296
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,333
Turned the pain of
unrequited hope to anger.

297
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,958
He took advantage
of them. As did I.

298
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,791
[MELDY]
That wasn't you.

299
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,833
I'm done searching for excuses.

300
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,000
Regardless of what
Ultear believed,

301
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,791
darkness can only
engulf the ones

302
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:27,083
who let it inside their hearts.

303
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,750
Natsu told me something
in that Tower.

304
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,916
I still think
about it even now.

305
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,291
You'll never know what
it means to be free!

306
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,416
As long as you're
possessed by that spirit,

307
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,375
you'll always be a slave!

308
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,500
You can do it, Jellal.
Free yourself!

309
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,958
[JELLAL]
Helping them to free themselves,

310
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,083
like Natsu did for me,

311
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,041
it's part of my atonement.

312
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,083
[MELDY]
I understand.

313
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,125
Tch.

314
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,208
[MIDNIGHT] What'd you hear?
Anything to worry about?

315
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,875
[COBRA]
Naw, just Jellal.

316
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,500
I bet that I could
tune him out easy

317
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,958
if he'd stop sayin'
my real name.

318
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,666
[ANGEL]
He doesn't know how shy you are.

319
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,958
[COBRA]
Ugh. Shut it, Sorano.

320
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,166
[chuckles]

321
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,250
Look out!

322
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,333
[MELDY]
What is this?

323
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,541
How did the Tower
of Dingir get here?

324
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,708
[RUSTY]
Simply enough, my dear.

325
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:31,375
I summoned it using
my Arc of Embodiment.

326
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:34,958
[MELDY] Rusty? Were you planning
to attack us from the start?

327
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,833
[RUSTY] I'm not trying
to hurt you, Meldy,

328
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,833
I'm trying to rebuild!

329
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:42,041
Grimoire Heart can live
again through us! Together!

330
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,500
[MELDY]
What if I don't want it to?

331
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,708
[RUSTY]
Then I'll have to persuade you!

332
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,166
You'll join us if you
want him to live.

333
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,083
You'd be sparin' yourself
a lotta pain as well!

334
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,875
[screaming]

335
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,750
You aren't going to win
this, Meldy, so join us.

336
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,625
I don't want to hurt an old
friend any more than I have to.

337
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,333
What's the matter?

338
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,208
The girl I knew would've at
least tried to fight back!

339
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,666
You aren't even using
your Sensory Link!

340
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,208
[MELDY]
You're in so much pain already.

341
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:15,125
I refuse to cause you any more.

342
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,666
[RUSTY]
What do you mean?

343
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,208
You told me that the past is
dead, but you're trapped in it.

344
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,125
What does that make you?

345
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,875
Seven years I wandered!

346
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,875
Seven long years I never
gave up on finding you!

347
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,208
That hope was the only
thing I lived for.

348
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:31,375
But I've moved on, and you
can still do the same.

349
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,458
Don't let the past
constrain you.

350
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,083
Look to the future instead!

351
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,541
[growling]

352
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:37,583
[RUSTY]
Shut up!

353
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,166
[screaming]

354
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:43,541
Don't do this. Don't force me
to kill you. Join me and live.

355
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,250
There is no other path for you.

356
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,250
Come on back to us!

357
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:51,000
Just look! Everybody's waiting,
all we need is you!

358
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:55,666
I can't. That's not real,
Rusty. It's the past.

359
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,750
I haven't forgotten it.

360
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,708
[MELDY]
But I live now!

361
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:04,791
Every day, Jellal and I risk our
lives to atone for those times.

362
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,333
I found a guild that
strives to do better!

363
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,958
It's called Crime Sorciere!

364
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,958
Then that's what I must destroy.

365
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:15,041
You won't blow me off
once you have nothing else.

366
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,166
[JELLAL]
Leave her... alone.

367
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,708
[RUSTY] How're you gonna
fight me in that state?

368
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:24,333
You're holding Meldy back.
So begone from this world!

369
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,125
[thud]

370
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,583
[RUSTY yelps]

371
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,083
What's happened? Where is he?

372
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,166
[COBRA] How about you
ditch that scrap of cloth

373
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,000
and see for yourself?

374
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,250
[JELLAL]
Meldy.

375
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,750
Are your eyes back to normal?
What color's my hair?

376
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,583
I know that much blind.

377
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,250
[BOTH gasp]

378
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,250
[JELLAL]
You came.

379
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,583
Nothin' personal,

380
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,375
we just couldn't think
of anything better to do.

381
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,750
So, for now at least,

382
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,833
we've decided to tag
along with you two.

383
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,416
See how we like it.

384
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,000
To free the victim
in your heart,

385
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,000
you fight to build
a better world.

386
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,083
A world that victim can forgive.

387
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:08,541
I go my own way, but
I have respect for yours.

388
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,291
[JELLAL]
Right.

389
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:15,375
Rustyrose. You too will have
to find your own way forward.

390
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:16,625
However,

391
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:21,333
the isolation tormenting
you can finally cease.

392
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,291
When you find yourself
ready to make amends

393
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,916
for the sins of your past,

394
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,166
there's a place for you
in Crime Sorciere.

395
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,750
Until that day, farewell.

396
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,166
I gotta go fast!

397
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,833
Master Makarov needs to
know what's going on!

398
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:48,000
Hang in there, Natsu!
You too, Lucy!

399
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,750
Smell anything? Mira?

400
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,125
[NATSU sniffing]

401
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:55,166
Not yet. This place is
built like a friggin' maze.

402
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,416
Damn it!

403
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,333
Let's keep on
moving west for now.

404
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:01,416
Don't worry! We'll find
her, I can feel it!

405
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,666
Mira!

406
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,833
[LUCY]
Where are you?!

407
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:18,083
[MAN] The demons of
the Books of Zeref.

408
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,791
Also known as the "Etherious."

409
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:25,166
A human imitation doesn't stand
a chance against the real thing.

410
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,333
Isn't that right, Master?

411
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,000
This is naught
but the beginning.

412
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:35,041
So much darkness waits
to spill from our world.

413
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:37,583
Enough to smother the
waning light of this world

414
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:40,333
beneath a blanket
as black as night.

415
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:15,750
[LUCY] After casting
a Macro on herself,

416
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:18,291
Seilah unleashes the full
brunt of her power,

417
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,458
overwhelming Mirajane.

418
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:21,958
Faced with imminent death,

419
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:25,166
Mirajane recalls the most
important times of her life.

420
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,791
The times she got to
spend with her family.

421
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,625
The power of that
strong, gentle bond

422
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:33,625
summons the kind of miracle that
no demon can stand against.

423
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:36,958
Next Time:
"Tartaros Chapter Alegria."

424
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:40,083
She uses her strength
to protect her family.
