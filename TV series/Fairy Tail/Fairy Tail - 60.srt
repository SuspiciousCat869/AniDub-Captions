1
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:20,625
- Natsu:
PREVIOUSLY, ON "FAIRY TAIL"...

2
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:22,041
- Lucy: OUR SMALL GROUP OF
ALLIED GUILDS

3
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,750
TOOK ON THE ORACION SEIS.

4
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,583
AND TO MAKE THINGS
WAY MORE CONFUSING,

5
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,958
THEY RESURRECTED JELLAL! 
- Wendy: I'M SORRY.

6
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:30,666
- Happy: ERZA GOT HURT,
HAD AN AMAZING RECOVERY,

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,958
THEN DISAPPEARED!

8
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,958
AND NIRVANA'S SEAL WAS BROKEN.

9
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,666
- Wendy: I'M SO SORRY, GUYS.

10
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:40,500
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )


11
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,916
- Narrator:
DEEP WITHIN THE WORTH WOODSEA,

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,083
ERZA AND JELLAL
WERE ONCE AGAIN REUNITED.

13
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,958
HOWEVER, JELLAL'S MEMORY
HAD BEEN WIPED CLEAN.

14
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:20,375
HE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE
OF HIS OWN DARK PAST.

15
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:32,166
TO PREVENT
AN EVEN DARKER FUTURE,

16
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,083
AND TO FREE ERZA
FROM THE BURDEN SHE CARRIED,

17
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:39,458
JELLAL DREW A MAGIC CIRCLE
DESIGNED TO DESTROY NIRVANA

18
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,583
AND HIMSELF WITH IT.

19
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:45,875
BUT ERZA HAS OTHER IDEAS.

20
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,250
- DON'T DO THIS!

21
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,291
- Cobra: IF HE GOES,
HE'S TAKIN' THE ONLY WAY

22
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,875
TO SHUT DOWN THAT SELF
DESTRUCTION CIRCLE WITH HIM.

23
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:05,625
- LISTEN TO ME.
YOU CAN'T!

24
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,666
I WON'T ALLOW YOU
TO DIE LIKE THIS.

25
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,875
YOU HAVE TO ATONE
FOR YOUR SINS!

26
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:17,291
IT MEANS NOTHING IF YOU DIE NOW,
IGNORANT OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

27
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,541
( sobbing )

28
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,916
OWN YOUR GUILT AND LIVE!

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,291
JELLAL!

30
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:36,583
- ( Happy speaking )

31
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:45,416
- ERZA, DON'T CRY.

32
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,083
THERE'S NO REASON TO.

33
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:03,500
YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON.

34
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,916
- JELLAL, YOU HAVE TO
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER.

35
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,666
- WHAT COULD BE THE MEANING
OF ALL THIS FOOLISHNESS?

36
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,333
- HE'S BACK.

37
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,583
- A MAGIC CIRCLE
OF SELF-DESTRUCTION.

38
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,875
- Cobra:
THIS IS JELLAL'S DOING!

39
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,375
WE'VE GONE THROUGH ALL THIS
TROUBLE TO BRING ABOUT NIRVANA,

40
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:29,500
AND THIS IDIOT
IS TRYING TO DESTROY IT.

41
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,958
- SPARE THE HYSTERICS.

42
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:37,208
I DON'T ANSWER TO THE NAME BRAIN
BY MERE CHANCE.

43
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:40,500
DO YOU KNOW HOW
I CAME TO BE CALLED THAT?

44
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:44,250
I ONCE WORKED AT THE BUREAU
OF MAGICAL DEVELOPMENT.

45
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:48,125
DURING MY TENURE THERE,
I PRODUCED HUNDREDS OF SPELLS,

46
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,458
INCLUDING THOSE DESIGNED TO
BRING DESTRUCTION,

47
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,916
SUCH AS THIS ONE.

48
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,875
I STILL HOLD THAT KNOWLEDGE
TO THIS VERY DAY.

49
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:58,458
IN FACT, I WAS THE ONE
WHO TAUGHT YOU HOW TO USE THEM.

50
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,166
OR HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN,
JELLAL?

51
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,666
THIS SPOT SHOULD SUFFICE.

52
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,416
FOCUS YOUR MIND,
YOUR ENERGY.

53
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,250
VISUALIZE THE DESTRUCTION
YOU WISH TO SEE AS A CLEAR,

54
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,833
CRYSTALLINE PATTERN
AND THEN MAKE IT SO.

55
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,250
- YEAH, I KNOW THAT.

56
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:46,541
- AND THIS,
AFTER A SINGLE LESSON?

57
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,750
YOUR SKILL IS OUTSTANDING.

58
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,708
I'M IMPRESSED.

59
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,875
YOU'VE MASTERED THE MAGIC CIRCLE
OF SELF-DESTRUCTION

60
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,541
IN RECORD TIME.

61
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,250
- I HAVEN'T "MASTERED" IT.

62
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,666
- WHAT?

63
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,791
- I NEED TO TAKE IT FURTHER,

64
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,833
TO A LEVEL OF DESTRUCTION
THAT ELIMINATES

65
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,958
EVERY TRACE OF EXISTENCE.

66
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,041
- THIS BOY.

67
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:28,875
SO IT SEEMS HE'S PLACED
HIMSELF UNDER ONE AS WELL.

68
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,625
HE INTENDS TO TAKE THE DISARM
CODE WITH HIM TO THE GRAVE,

69
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:32,875
DOES HE?

70
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,333
- I DON'T THINK HE'S GONNA BE
TRAVELING DOWN

71
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,916
MEMORY LANE WITH YOU, BRAIN.

72
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,083
SORRY, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THAT
ETHER-NANO WIPED IT ALL OUT.

73
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,375
- ( laughs )
IS THAT SO?

74
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,791
HOW COMICAL.

75
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:51,583
WE HAVE NO FURTHER NEED
OF HIS ASSISTANCE.

76
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,500
I KNOW HOW TO NULLIFY
THIS MAGIC CIRCLE,

77
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,791
QUITE SIMPLY.

78
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,750
- NO!
- YOU CAN'T.

79
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,166
- WHOA!

80
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,208
- ( laughs )

81
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:18,166
YOU TRIED YOUR BEST, JELLAL.

82
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:23,166
BUT NOW NIRVANA
IS FINALLY UNDER MY CONTROL!

83
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,000
- WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT!

84
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:28,458
- NIRVANA, ARISE!

85
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:31,333
- ERZA!

86
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,375
- REVEAL YOUR TRUE FACE!

87
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,875
- YEAH!
I HEAR IT.

88
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,458
THE SOUND OF THE FUTURE,

89
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,458
OF LIGHT
CRASHING TO THE GROUND!

90
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,291
- NO!  JELLAL!

91
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,666
- ERZA!

92
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,125
- I THINK IT'S GETTING WORSE.
- QUICKLY, CHILD,

93
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,958
LET'S GET TO SAFETY.
- NO, IT CAN'T BE.

94
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,375
IT'S CHANGED.

95
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,208
- I'M AFRAID
THAT YOU MAY BE RIGHT.

96
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,708
IT'S ENTERING THE FINAL STAGE.

97
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,833
NIRVANA'S RESURRECTION!

98
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,041
- MAN!

99
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,458
- WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?

100
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,875
- SO OUR MISSION
WAS A FAILURE.

101
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,541
- NO WAY!

102
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,250
- HOPE THAT'S NOT AS BAD
AS IT LOOKS.

103
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,416
- YEAH, I'M PRETTY SURE IT IS.

104
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,083
- Gray: AND ONCE AGAIN,

105
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,875
ERZA IS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF IT.

106
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,833
- SERIOUSLY?

107
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,000
- Natsu: THIS IS THE MOST
DANGEROUS THING

108
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,458
I'VE EVER SMELLED.

109
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,666
- WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW?
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

110
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,166
- SOMETHING
UNBELIEVABLY MASSIVE.

111
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,791
OH YEAH.
- CAN YOU MAKE OUT WHAT EXACTLY?

112
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,208
- ( all shouting )

113
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,833
- Natsu: AW GREAT,
NOW WHAT'S GOING ON?!

114
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,708
- Gray: I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS,
BUT IT'S EVERYWHERE.

115
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,125
- Lucy:
DO YOU THINK THIS IS NIRVANA?

116
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,708
- Lyon: IT DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE MAGIC TO ME.

117
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,708
- Natsu:
WHY IS EVERYTHING SHAKING?!

118
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,875
- Gray: GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF,
MAN.

119
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,333
- Lucy: HERE COMES
THAT REALLY BAD FEELING AGAIN.

120
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,041
- Lyon: YOU SAID IT.

121
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:24,208
- Lucy: WHAT DID I TELL YOU?!

122
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,000
- ( all shouting )
- YOU COWARDS!

123
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:32,000
YOU NEVER LEAVE A MAN BEHIND!

124
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,083
- ( screaming )

125
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,958
CARLA!

126
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:44,083
- DON'T WORRY, I'VE GOT YOU.
- THANKS.

127
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,875
LOOK OVER THERE!
- WHAT IS IT?

128
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:52,416
COULD THAT BE NIRVANA?

129
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,541
- YES!

130
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,583
AT LONG LAST
I HAVE OBTAINED IT.

131
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,791
THE ULTIMATE WEAPON
WHICH EXTINGUISHES LIGHT.

132
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,958
THE LEGENDARY REVERSAL MAGIC--
NIRVANA.

133
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:37,375
THOSE NEAR-SIGHTED GUILDS
WILL CLING TO THEIR PIETY,

134
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,375
THEIR FELLOWSHIP, AND TRUST.

135
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:43,333
BUT NOW, SUCH THINGS
WILL BE STRIPPED OF MEANING.

136
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,666
- ERZA.

137
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,666
- THE MAGIC CIRCLE
YOU PLACED ON YOURSELF,

138
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,791
YOU MUST UNDO IT
THIS INSTANT.

139
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:03,750
YOU HAVE A DUTY
TO STAY ALIVE.

140
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,083
- I FAILED.

141
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:11,000
I WASN'T ABLE TO
PUT A STOP TO NIRVANA.

142
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:25,875
NOW THE WORLD IS DOOMED.

143
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,958
- NO, THERE'S ALWAYS HOPE.

144
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,458
LOOK THERE.

145
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,083
- AAH!

146
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,291
- Lyon: ALL RIGHT, FAIRY TAIL,

147
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,041
IF ANYBODY CAN DO IT,
IT'S YOU.

148
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,250
- HEY, CARLA,
WE SHOULD GO UP THERE TOO

149
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,000
AND TRY TO HELP 'EM OUT.
- AGREED.

150
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,541
- LET'S LEND THEM A HAND.

151
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,208
- YOU SHOULD START
BY TAKING MINE.

152
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,625
- THANK YOU.

153
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,416
- HELPING OUT A FELLOW MAN
IN NEED.

154
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,333
THIS IS BROTHERLY LOVE.
OH YEAH!

155
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,625
- YOU SEE, AS LONG AS WE
DRAW BREATH INTO OUR LUNGS,

156
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:07,833
WE SHALL KEEP HOPE ALIVE
INSIDE OUR HEARTS.

157
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,500
- ONCE I GET TO THE TOP,

158
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,916
I'LL PUNCH THIS THING
INTO A BILLION PIECES!

159
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,541
- SO WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH YOU GUYS MATCHING OUTFITS?

160
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,041
- NOW IS NOT THE TIME!

161
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,625
- AND THAT HOPE WILL GUIDE YOU
THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFE.

162
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,291
SO LIVE.

163
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,958
- I WILL.
NOW LET'S GO.

164
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,250
- YES.

165
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,666
- ( grunting )

166
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,625
MAN.

167
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,208
WHAT A REVOLTING DEVELOPMENT!

168
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:10,333
WHERE DID THOSE JUVENILE
SNOT-NOSED PUNKS RUN OFF TO?

169
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,708
FOR THAT MATTER, WHERE AM I?!

170
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,916
THIS IS NO WAY
TO TREAT A MAN!

171
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,291
- ( all screaming )

172
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,791
- YOU GOTTA BE KIDDIN' ME.
COME ON!

173
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,291
WHAT'S WITH YOU?

174
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,166
 YOU CAN'T START
GETTING SICK RIGHT NOW.

175
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,125
- I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T HELP IT.

176
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,833
- JUST TRY.

177
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,916
- THIS THING'S MOVING
FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER.

178
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,791
- IT MAY BE MOVING, BUT IT'S
NOT LIKE IT'S A VEHICLE.

179
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,291
DON'T THINK OF IT THAT WAY.

180
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,875
- ( growling )

181
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,166
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT!

182
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,583
( grunting )

183
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:28,916
( whimpering )
MY TUMMY HURTS.

184
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,625
- JUST THINK OF IT
LIKE A GIANT OCTOPUS.

185
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,166
BEING ON THE BACK OF AN ANIMAL
DOESN'T BOTHER YOU, DOES IT?

186
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,625
- AN OCTOPUS IN THE WOODS
IS ALL KINDS OF WRONG.

187
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,541
- DON'T SWEAT THE WEIRD DETAILS.

188
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,291
- YOU'RE RIGHT. I JUST GOTTA
GET MY MIND AT EASE.

189
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,750
- WATCH OUT!
- YOU IDIOT!  STAY ALERT, MAN.

190
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,333
- I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
THIS IS A PIECE OF CAKE.

191
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,583
( grunting )

192
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,291
( whimpering, screaming )

193
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,875
- NATSU!
- AAH!

194
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:09,000
- AAH!

195
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,416
GOOD WORK, PAL!
- AYE, SIR.

196
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,666
- GREAT TIMING.
AWESOME CATCH.

197
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,833
- THAT STUPID HOTHEAD
NEARLY GAVE ME A HEART ATTACK.

198
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,500
- WOW, HAPPY,
THAT WAS TOTALLY AWESOME!

199
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,625
YOU'RE MY HERO.

200
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,750
- NOW ISN'T THIS BETTER?

201
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,458
FEELS PRETTY AMAZING TO RIDE THE
WIND LIKE THIS, DON'T YA THINK?

202
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:50,541
- YEAH.
WAY BETTER.

203
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,958
- TAKE IT ALL THE WAY
TO THE TOP, GUYS.

204
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,625
WE'RE GONNA
HEAD THROUGH THERE

205
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,625
AND CHECK OUT WHAT THINGS
ARE LIKE ON THE INSIDE.

206
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,416
- RIGHT!
- AYE, SIR.

207
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,958
- OH WEIRD.

208
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:11,083
- Happy: YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE
SOME KIND OF CREEPY OLD CITY.

209
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,875
- Natsu: I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

210
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,166
THAT SMELL.

211
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,166
I CAN SMELL HIM.

212
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,500
- YOU ACTUALLY
PULLED THIS THING OFF.

213
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,041
YOU GOT US NIRVANA.

214
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,833
- ( chuckles )

215
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,708
- A CITY THAT'S BEEN LONG DEAD
BROUGHT BACK TO LIFE.

216
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,875
CUBELLIOS, DON'T YOU
THINK THAT'S AMAZING?

217
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,583
- ( hisses )
- BEHOLD, COBRA.

218
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,458
LOOK AT THE WORLD THAT NOW
SPREADS OUT BENEATH OUR FEET.

219
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,708
AN ENTIRE CITY,

220
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,208
UNSHACKLED FROM TIME
AND THE EARTH ITSELF.

221
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,375
THIS IS NIRVANA'S TRUE FORM.

222
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,583
AND FROM THIS SEAT OF POWER,

223
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:07,791
I CAN MOVE THIS CITY
TO ANYWHERE I SEE FIT.

224
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,333
- OH YEAH?

225
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,416
WELL, I'M SURE
YOU GOT SOMEWHERE IN MIND.

226
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,833
SO WHERE WE GOIN'?

227
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,875
- I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT OUR FIRST TARGET SHALL BE.

228
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,333
A CERTAIN GUILD HALL.

229
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:21,000
- SO WE'RE STARTING
WITH A BANG, ARE WE?

230
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:25,166
- IT SHALL BE THE FIRST OF
MANY LIGHTS TO BE EXTINGUISHED.

231
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,541
NIRVANA!
BEGIN YOUR MARCH NOW.

232
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:37,583
TRANSFORM MY DARKNESS
INTO LIGHT!

233
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,375
- AAH!

234
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,666
I'M PUTTING THE BRAKES
ON THIS THING.

235
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,916
- NO, THE FIRE DRAGON!

236
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,750
- ( Happy grunting )

237
00:17:56,833 --> 00:18:01,625
- FIRE DRAGON ROAR!

238
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,916
- STOP THIS FLAMING IDIOT
AT ONCE, COBRA.

239
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,416
- I HEAR YA.
CUBELLIOS!

240
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,458
- AAH!

241
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:20,041
THAT DOES IT!
I'M FIRED UP NOW.

242
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,333
AAH!

243
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:31,250
NICE SAVE.
THANKS, PAL.

244
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,000
- AYE.
- OKAY.

245
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,375
AAH!
- THAT ISN'T RIGHT.

246
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,000
EVERYONE KNOWS SNAKES
AREN'T SUPPOSED TO FLY.

247
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,166
- WHAT'S THE DEAL?

248
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,500
I THOUGHT VEHICLES MADE YOU
MOTION SICK OR SOMETHING?

249
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,208
SO YOU SHOULD BE PUKING
YOUR GUTS OUT RIGHT NOW.

250
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,083
- HAPPY'S NOT A VEHICLE!
HE'S MY FRIEND.

251
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,708
YOU TELL HIM, NATSU!

252
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,125
- I GET IT.

253
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,416
SO YOU GOTTA STAY UP HERE
IN THE AIR,

254
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,750
'CAUSE BEING ON NIRVANA
WHILE IT'S MOVING

255
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,583
IS GONNA MAKE YOU THROW UP.

256
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,666
THAT'S THE DUMBEST THING
I EVER HEARD.

257
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,791
- YEAH,
WELL, IT MAKES SENSE TO ME.

258
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:09,958
AND BESIDES, I'M GONNA STOP
THIS OVERSIZED PIECE OF JUNK.

259
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,166
- YOU'RE GONNA NEED
THE DEVIL'S LUCK TO DO THAT.

260
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,625
'CAUSE THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'RE GONNA GET NEAR BRAIN.

261
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,625
- BRAIN?

262
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:20,291
IS THAT GUY
THE ONE DRIVING THIS THING?

263
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:23,500
- BRING IT ON,
FIRE DRAGON SLAYER!

264
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,375
- YOU GOT IT!

265
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,000
I'M COMING RIGHT FOR YA,
BUDDY!

266
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,333
PSYCHE!
STRAIGHT FOR THE BRAIN!

267
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,708
- AYE.

268
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:37,750
- ( both screaming )

269
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,916
- WELL, THAT CERTAINLY DIDN'T
WORK OUT THE WAY I WANTED IT TO.

270
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,250
- IT'S LIKE HE KNEW
WHAT WE WERE GONNA DO.

271
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:47,500
- I CAN "HEAR" YOUR MOVEMENTS
BEFORE YOU MAKE THEM.

272
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,666
- SAY WHAT?
- OH YEAH.

273
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,750
LOUD AND CLEAR.
SO LET'S HAVE SOME FUN.

274
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,083
- ( panting )

275
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,458
- I'M SORRY THAT WAS SO HARD.

276
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,333
I WISH I COULD HELP OUT MORE.

277
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,166
- IT'S NO MATTER, CHILD.

278
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,083
WE'RE HERE,
AND IN ONE PIECE, MOSTLY.

279
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,750
BUT NOW THAT WE'VE ARRIVED,

280
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,666
EXACTLY WHAT IS IT
YOU PLAN TO DO?

281
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,000
YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND JELLAL
UP HERE, AREN'T YOU?

282
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,416
- I'M NOT!

283
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
- TRUTHFULLY.

284
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:34,166
- BUT, WELL, IN A WAY,
I GUESS I AM, SORT OF.

285
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,500
BUT THIS THING
DOES HAVE TO BE STOPPED.

286
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:42,041
SO NOW THAT I'M HERE,

287
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:45,416
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING
I CAN DO TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

288
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,541
- MAYBE.

289
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,333
- ( giggles )

290
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,791
IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?

291
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,666
- I DON'T KNOW.

292
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,458
I COULD BE WRONG.

293
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:27,166
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
IT'S GOING WHERE I THINK IT IS.

294
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,833
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

295
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,833
WHERE DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING?

296
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:35,500
- IF IT CONTINUES TO TRAVEL
ON THE SAME COURSE IT IS NOW,

297
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,875
THEN VERY SOON, IT'LL TRAMPLE
RIGHT OVER THE HOME

298
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,375
OF THE CAIT SHELTER GUILD.

299
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:02,375
- MAN, I CAN'T SEEM TO LAND
A SINGLE HIT ON THIS JOKER.

300
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:05,791
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS ON WHAT
KIND OF MAGIC HE MIGHT BE USING?

301
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,500
- ALL I KNOW IS WE BETTER
BEAT HIM REALLY QUICKLY.

302
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:12,000
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA
HAVE A CHANCE AT THE BOSS.

303
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,291
SO ARE YOU READY?

304
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,125
IT'S TIME TO GIVE THESE GUYS
A BEAT-DOWN

305
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,916
AND STOP THIS HUNK OF JUNK
IN ITS TRACKS. - AYE.

306
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,666
- THIS OUGHTA BE A RIOT.

307
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,791
A GREAT WAY
TO KEEP ME ENTERTAINED

308
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,500
WHILE WE MAKE THE TRIP
OVER TO OUR NEXT STOP.

309
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:30,333
COME ON,
LET'S GET THIS FIGHT STARTED.

310
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:34,625
- Natsu: YOU GOT IT!

311
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:38,208
I'M ALL FIRED UP NOW!

312
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:52,041
- ( singing in Japanese )

313
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,416
- Happy: HOLD ON A SECOND.

314
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,250
HOW COME THAT SNAKE
GETS TO HAVE WINGS

315
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,208
AND FLY AROUND LIKE ME?
CAN I SUE

316
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,791
FOR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT? 
 - Natsu: I DON'T KNOW.

317
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,291
DO I LOOK LIKE A LAWYER
TO YOU?

318
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,791
- OKAY, FINE.
THEN JUST BEAT IT UP.

319
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:23,250
TEACH IT A LESSON
FOR COPYING ME.

320
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:24,833
- WHAT ABOUT CARLA?

321
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:26,583
SHE'S TOTALLY
COPYING YOU TOO, MAN.

322
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:30,500
- YEAH, MAYBE,
BUT IT'S CUTE WHEN SHE DOES IT.

323
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:31,708
- Both: NEXT TIME--

324
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:33,833
"SUPER AERIAL BATTLE: NATSU
VERSUS COBRA"!

325
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:35,875
- Natsu: THAT SNAKE
IS TOTALLY COOL THOUGH.

326
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:37,958
AND IT HAS POISON. 
 - WELL, I GOT TONS OF FISH.

327
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:40,958
- SO WHAT?
HOW IS THAT COOL?
