1
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,500
This doesn't make sense!

2
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,375
Natsu just closed Loke's gate!

3
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,708
So how is the
Liberam still going?

4
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:29,750
This won't end well.

5
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:34,875
[OPHIUCHUS] Omnia...
magna... stella... rex... prae.

6
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:37,208
Why is the snake chick
beltin' out a tune?

7
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,833
Can you tell
what she's saying?

8
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:41,833
"Omelet, mackerel, and
some shellfish tempura to go".

9
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,958
It's still not the time
to think with your stomach!

10
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,208
It's never the
right time with you.

11
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:51,000
She's saying,
"Omnia magna stella rex prae."

12
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,833
"All for the sake
of the King of stars."

13
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,000
It can't be!

14
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,458
You're out of
your depth, humans.

15
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,875
Don't interfere!

16
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,083
The time is nigh.

17
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,458
I can feel it!

18
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,541
You won't be
waiting long, my king.

19
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:02,416
[NATSU groaning in pain]

20
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,000
That was hard to watch, man.

21
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,083
Wasn't easy to do, either.

22
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:12,375
Also, you kinda look
like you're dying.

23
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,916
Oh yeah?

24
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,916
Well I've been feelin' like a
train-wreck for a while now.

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,708
My goodness!
What's wrong with you?

26
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,916
You're a little
off color, Natsu.

27
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,875
What?

28
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:21,916
Whoa, man!

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,833
You're sweatin' out party fog!

30
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,166
Is that bad?

31
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,500
My paw's melting!

32
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,333
I've never seen
a fever like this!

33
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,750
So did you catch a bug, then?

34
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,458
[NATSU]
Heck no. I don't get sick!

35
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:32,500
If you ate more fish,

36
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,041
you'd have a
stronger immune system.

37
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,583
It's not like that!

38
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,750
I've been feelin' weird
ever since I beat Loke.

39
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,416
Chances are it's got
somethin' to do with him.

40
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,416
[HAPPY]
Ophiuchus, the Snake Charmer!

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,583
[GRAY] So, we got
a destination, or...?

42
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:52,625
[ERZA] Hmm...

43
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,666
[GAJEEL] I'm catchin' a faint
whiff of Salamander

44
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,041
from over there.

45
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,750
[OPHIUCHUS] There's
nothing you can do now

46
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,750
but watch and weep,
you pathetic humans!

47
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,000
Anyone else hear
that sinister voice?

48
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,833
Yeah, it was like
it came out of nowhere.

49
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,541
Didn't sound like
any spirits I know of.

50
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,375
There is one other spirit
that should be around here.

51
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,708
Isn't there a
13th zodiac member?

52
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,208
That's the rumor anyway.

53
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:21,625
[OPHIUCHUS] Omnia...
magna... stella... rex... prae.

54
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:22,541
What was that?

55
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,458
I dunno, but it was creepy.

56
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,750
It sounded like
an incantation.

57
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,000
The Liberam?

58
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,291
It shan't be long now, comrades.

59
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,000
Very soon,
the shackles that bind you

60
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,208
to this earthly plane
will be severed!

61
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,500
Your liberation
is close at hand!

62
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,250
We're right in front
of her, ready to fight,

63
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,208
and she's actin'
like she already won!

64
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,833
Aw, man.
And this headache is killing me.

65
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,458
From the amount of
heat you're putting out,

66
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,916
I don't think that this
is an ordinary sickness.

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,083
It could be a side-effect
of Loke's darkness magic.

68
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:00,958
Say what?

69
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,250
[CARLA] You ate it, remember?

70
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,458
[WENDY] In that case...

71
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,791
My guess is that

72
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,125
darkness magic and dragon
slayer magic don't mix.

73
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:11,208
They're probably fighting
it out inside you as we speak.

74
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,750
It's kinda like
ya ate a chili-dog

75
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,875
right after downin'
some mint ice cream.

76
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,125
Except my stomach
isn't the problem!

77
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,541
Whatever this is,

78
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,083
I can't fight at full
strength until I get rid of it.

79
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,916
You've obviously been
weakened by the Liberam.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,125
You can't win like this,
and I never wanted to fight you,

81
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,708
so let's stop!

82
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,750
I'm just getting started.

83
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,708
Yeah, well I'm about finished!

84
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,708
Let me go!

85
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,666
[LUCY] Not until I'm through!

86
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,250
I have something to tell you.

87
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,416
For the last time,

88
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,125
I don't care if
I die as long as I'm free!

89
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,083
That's not it!

90
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,375
This is about me and you, okay?

91
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,291
I'm not trying to
suppress a revolt here.

92
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,833
I'm just scared.
Scared of losing my friends.

93
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,875
Our bond wasn't about mastery.
We cared for each other.

94
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,291
Sure, it's a little
weird that you're always

95
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,750
asking about punishments and
calling me princess,

96
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,083
but that's okay,

97
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,791
because it's part of
what makes you who you are!

98
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,625
Pretty words
won't change my mind.

99
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,500
These are more
than just words!

100
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,958
Virgo, please look into my eyes.

101
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,083
You, Loke, Aquarius,
and all the other spirits

102
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,791
have shaped me into the
person that you're looking at.

103
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,625
The celestial spirits
I'm contracted to

104
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,166
are not my servants.
They are my life!

105
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,166
[yells]

106
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:56,125
No matter what you do,
we will complete the Liberam!

107
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:13,083
Equilibrium must be
restored at all costs.

108
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,125
This might be my only chance.

109
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,291
No!

110
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,166
The bond between
celestial wizard and spirit

111
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,166
is out of balance, and only the
Liberam can restore it!

112
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,708
Libra, think!

113
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,625
How can our bond be balanced
if it's completely destroyed?

114
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,500
Arrogant humans...

115
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:40,958
Even now you
think you have the right

116
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,708
to control our futures.

117
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,583
You won't allow us
even twelve days of freedom.

118
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,666
Some things are worth dying for!

119
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,416
This is precious to us!

120
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,708
You celestial wizards
couldn't possibly understand!

121
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:56,583
Well I don't understand,
nor do I want to!

122
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,583
There's a difference
between setting yourself free

123
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,250
and throwing your life away!

124
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,458
Freedom shouldn't
come with a death sentence.

125
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:05,541
That isn't liberation.
It's giving up!

126
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,375
[VIRGO] Enough with
this sentimental blather.

127
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:08,625
I hate it!

128
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,625
There's no point
explaining to a human.

129
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,666
We don't need your approval!
This is our choice!

130
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,166
[ALL screaming]

131
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,625
You must be terrified by now.

132
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,583
Stop gloating,
ya dumb snake!

133
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,750
Ow! What the heck!

134
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,166
Are you okay?

135
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,625
I ain't gonna feel right
until I get back in the action!

136
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,041
[OPHIUCHUS] What a very
little person you are.

137
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,500
[NATSU] I'll kick your butt
if I can find it!

138
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,291
[groaning in pain]

139
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:47,958
Natsu, no!

140
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,291
Get out of the way!

141
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,291
But how?!

142
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,666
Perfect timing, man!

143
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,000
How'd you end up
in such a dire situation?

144
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,500
Ate somethin'
that disagreed with me!

145
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:09,791
[HISUI] Natsu!

146
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:12,083
Whoa!

147
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,125
Princess, look.

148
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,791
This must be Ophiuchus.

149
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,041
The Snake Charmer spirit.

150
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:21,250
[HISUI] I didn't think
she'd be so large...

151
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,041
Greetings, Princess.

152
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,875
I'm afraid that you're too late.

153
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,375
Nobody can stop me now.

154
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:33,416
Omnia... magna...
stella... rex... prae.

155
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,208
Struggle though
you may to tie us down,

156
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,333
we will take what we desire!

157
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:41,333
That incantation.
She's saying...

158
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:45,666
"Omnia." Then
"magna stella rex prae."

159
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,083
"All for the sake
of the King of stars."

160
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,083
Well played.

161
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,000
Now tell us what
that really means.

162
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,875
The king that
you're referring to

163
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,500
must be the
Celestial Spirit King.

164
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,208
[HISUI] If all this has
been for the king's sake,

165
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,083
then the spirits haven't
been acting for themselves.

166
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,291
There's something more
at play here.

167
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,166
They're being manipulated.

168
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,083
But what could he
stand to gain from this?

169
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,583
If he's sacrificing his
own subjects then he's lost it.

170
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,708
What is that?

171
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:18,208
An old book
I borrowed from Yukino.

172
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,916
There's a section
about the Liberam.

173
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,125
If memory serves,
it also mentions a king.

174
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:26,125
Is the Celestial Spirit
King behind this, or not?

175
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,916
But of course he is.

176
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,958
Ya know, I always wanted

177
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,000
to go toe to toe
with ol' nose hairs.

178
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:50,416
But I didn't really have a
decent excuse until right now.

179
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,916
[laughing]

180
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,333
How can you defeat my king
when you're about to fall to me?

181
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,875
What's she doin'?

182
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:07,125
[OPHIUCHUS] I am Ophiuchus,
the Snake Charmer.

183
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,333
Chosen guardian of
the Celestial Spirit King!

184
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,958
I am the thirteenth
spirit of the zodiac.

185
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,541
The deadly shadow of my liege!

186
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,375
Three spirits
still stand strong,

187
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:21,000
and there is nothing
you can do to stop us!

188
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,791
Aw, man.
She's really lost it.

189
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,666
[LUCY whimpering]

190
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,500
Lucy's in trouble!

191
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,833
Yukino is, too!

192
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,875
Surely there's something
we can do to help.

193
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,416
But they're essentially
trapped in alternate dimensions!

194
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,583
Screw this!

195
00:11:58,666 --> 00:11:59,666
Natsu!

196
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,000
First I'm gonna
thrash this cocky snake

197
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,458
and then I'm gonna
burn the mustache

198
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,166
right off her
dumb king's face!

199
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,750
I warned you
not to interfere.

200
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,500
Now you'll pay the price.

201
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:19,666
Look out!

202
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:27,625
What the--

203
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,500
You can leave this to me!

204
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,208
Be careful!

205
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,916
Keep your distance!

206
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,125
This isn't fair!

207
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,458
My frickin' arm
won't do what I tell it to!

208
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,000
Hey Natsu,
I think we need to focus

209
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,958
on the belly
of Ophiuchus's snake!

210
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:46,125
That glowy spot looks
kinda suspicious, doesn't it?

211
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,250
[NATSU] Yeah.

212
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,291
The rest of the snake's body

213
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,458
is kinda dark and cold,
you know?

214
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:55,166
So if that spot's warm and
bright, there's a reason why.

215
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,166
Only one way
to find out for sure.

216
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,958
By "only one way,"
I hope you don't mean

217
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,500
"run up and punch it!"

218
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,458
For all we know, that thing
could be chock-full of poison!

219
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:03,833
This is one of those times

220
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,833
when ya gotta stop thinkin'
and and start swingin'!

221
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,333
I mean just look at that thing.

222
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,958
It's practically beggin' me
to go up there and break it.

223
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,125
[NATSU] Here's my chance!

224
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,333
[screaming]

225
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,833
Looks like you
found a weak spot.

226
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,166
I'll never doubt you again,
I swear.

227
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,791
The light you just targeted...

228
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,208
It must've come from the organ

229
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,625
that was maintaining
the zodiac realms.

230
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:46,916
Holy...

231
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,541
What did you do?

232
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,041
If you're standing
between me and true freedom,

233
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:03,375
that makes you my enemy,
no matter what!

234
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,416
No...

235
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,791
The zodiac realms...

236
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,166
They've been
thrown out of balance,

237
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,166
but how can that be possible?

238
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,041
Whoa!

239
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,875
What the heck is going on?

240
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,166
[HAPPY] This is what happens
when you punch first

241
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,375
and ask questions later.

242
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,833
Now Lucy and Yukino
are stuck in that thing!

243
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:36,750
--But I thought--
--The zodiac realms

244
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,541
are converging.

245
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,750
[OPHIUCHUS] You insect!

246
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,500
How dare you throw
my creations into chaos!

247
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,750
Don't worry, guys,
I got this!

248
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:48,875
[yelling]

249
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,250
No way...

250
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,666
Whoa!

251
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,541
Lucy! Yukino!

252
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,750
Ground support is on the way!

253
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,208
A mere human
can wield such power?

254
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,708
Oh, I'm more
than just human!

255
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,541
I'm a dragon slayer, got it?

256
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,875
[yelling]

257
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,916
I'm glad to see you,
but how're you here?

258
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,375
I couldn't tell ya.

259
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,583
However...

260
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,791
Now that we can fight together,

261
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,916
there's a certain spell
that comes to mind.

262
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,291
Right!

263
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:55,000
[BOTH] Oh stars far and wide
that embody the heavens.

264
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,125
By thy radiance,
reveal thy form to me.

265
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,583
I implore Tetrabiblios,

266
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,833
eternal ruler
of the stars above.

267
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,708
[LUCY, YUKINO]
Now that the aspect is complete,

268
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,875
I ask that you
to lend your power to me.

269
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,041
Let your unrestrained rage flow.

270
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,333
And open the raging,
tumultuous gate!

271
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,291
C'mon, before
they finish casting!

272
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,041
There is great
balance in unified action!

273
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,458
It's time for
some punishment!

274
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,875
You shall not prevail!

275
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,208
With all eighty-eight
heavenly bodies.

276
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,333
Shining!

277
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,333
Uranometria!

278
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:38,625
Let's finish it.

279
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:39,791
All right!

280
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:52,916
Is something on your mind?

281
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,416
Could we be in the wrong?

282
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,250
Saving them against their will?

283
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,625
This is right.

284
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,083
[LUCY] Please, Virgo.

285
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,458
When this is over,
turn back to normal.

286
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,500
I'm doing this for you.

287
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:07,875
I'm sorry.

288
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,041
You deserve a good, long break.

289
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,208
We need to get out of here!

290
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,875
I agree, but how?
Where can we go?

291
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,750
All I know is
that we gotta move.

292
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,958
We'll have to figure out
the rest as we go!

293
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,541
[screaming]

294
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,041
What the--

295
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,458
It looks like
they made it back!

296
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,000
Are they all right?

297
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,291
They pulled it off.

298
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,958
Steady now!

299
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,750
[WENDY] Lucy, please wake up!

300
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,791
Can you open your eyes for me?

301
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,250
We made it?

302
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,333
You can thank
Natsu for that one!

303
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,750
What did he do?

304
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,791
It was quite impressive.

305
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,208
Natsu used his flames

306
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:13,000
and fused the
zodiac realms into one!

307
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:16,708
[HISUI] That gave you and Yukino
the chance to join forces!

308
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,666
So you're feeling better?

309
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,750
You don't seem to be
putting out heat anymore.

310
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,333
Yeah, I'm good.

311
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:27,166
Must've blasted the last of that
darkness magic out of my body.

312
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,500
And hopefully
you've learned to watch

313
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:29,583
what you eat!

314
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:30,583
[NATSU] I dunno.

315
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,416
Kinda worked out
for us this time.

316
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,666
Hey snake girl!

317
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,083
Looks like you're
the last spirit standing!

318
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,125
Your assistance
has been invaluable.

319
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,625
I thank you.

320
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,083
[NATSU] Say what?

321
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,875
[OPHIUCHUS]
Shutting all those gates myself

322
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,666
would have been
quite the challenge.

323
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,833
Thank goodness I had you.

324
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,291
[HISUI] Huh?

325
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,166
You've returned all
twelve zodiac members

326
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,541
to the Celestial
Spirit King's grasp!

327
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,500
Wh-What are you talking about?

328
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,166
Are you saying that
the Celestial Spirit King

329
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,833
planned for the
zodiac to be defeated?

330
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,666
He's the one
that stands to gain.

331
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,750
But the plan itself was mine.

332
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,541
The most difficult part

333
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,708
was finding a way
to keep the zodiac spirits

334
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,833
from leaving
the celestial plane.

335
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,000
So I fabricated
a ritual, Liberam,

336
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,750
knowing they
would try to perform it,

337
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,750
but that you would stop them
by sealing their gates.

338
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,291
So the spirits never really
even had a chance at freedom,

339
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,666
and the whole reason
that they were fighting

340
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,583
was just one big lie?

341
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,833
They were tricked into
the whole thing, as were we!

342
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,791
[OPHIUCHUS] The Celestial
Globe serves as a conduit.

343
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,833
It channels power
from the constellations

344
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,166
of the zodiac to my king.

345
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,083
The ritual we set out
to perform's sole purpose

346
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,750
is to grant him
the zodiac's strength.

347
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,333
It's called the "Liberam Verus".

348
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,250
Is there any mention
of it in that book?

349
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,833
There is.

350
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,041
But it'll probably take me more
than a minute to translate it.

351
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,666
Just do it as
quickly as you can.

352
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,125
We need to know
all of the details.

353
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,750
Okay, I'll do my best!

354
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,541
[OPHIUCHUS]
The problem with Liberam Verus

355
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:08,500
is that it can only sacrifice
spirits in the celestial plane.

356
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,625
Sacrifice? But why?

357
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,083
[OPHIUCHUS]
Becoming an Eclipse spirit

358
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,291
did endow the
Celestial Spirit king,

359
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,625
who was already the
strongest being in his world,

360
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,833
with power greater
than he had ever known.

361
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,750
But it also gave
him an appetite to match.

362
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,291
Fearful of his mighty hunger,

363
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:27,791
the zodiac spirits attempted
to flee the celestial world.

364
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,750
They strove to be free of him.

365
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:33,833
But their celestial bodies
pulled them back to the stars.

366
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:37,541
To resist was to suffer,
and to give in was to die.

367
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,083
The setup was perfect.

368
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,458
With the false hope
of the Liberam,

369
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,375
I set them and you to work

370
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,458
at granting my king
the power he craves.

371
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,666
The Celestial Spirit King
was that affected?

372
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,791
So what I'm
getting out of this

373
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,583
is he's turned
into a mean old lunatic

374
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,000
who nobody
wants to hang out with

375
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,291
'cause he's got
no control of himself!

376
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,750
We thought we were
fighting to protect the spirits,

377
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,333
but we ended up putting them
right into harm's way.

378
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,875
To think we've
been banishing them

379
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,250
to the very place that they were

380
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,416
so desperately
struggling to escape.

381
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,041
A world ruled by
a power-crazed monster.

382
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,250
How awful.

383
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,208
I can't believe this crap!

384
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,166
That isn't the
worst of it, either.

385
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,708
If this demented Celestial
Spirit King goes unchecked...

386
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,791
If his rampage
can't be stopped...

387
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:25,250
Then the celestial spirit world
will collapse in on itself.

388
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,041
Ya mean the whole damn place?

389
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,458
[OPHIUCHUS] Indeed.

390
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,291
Princess Hisui's prediction
may well come to pass.

391
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,000
[HAPPY] If the
celestial spirit world goes,

392
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,750
then you'll disappear
right along with it, lady!

393
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,000
If it's what my liege
should happen to desire,

394
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,750
then I shall cease
to exist with pleasure!

395
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,708
All is at the will
of his majesty:

396
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,958
The Celestial Spirit King!

397
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:51,000
[laughing maniacally]

398
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:53,333
You're willing to die
just to give him more power?

399
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,208
That's friggin' crazy!

400
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:17,208
[growling noise]

401
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,708
Didja hear that growling?

402
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,666
It sounded
like a wild animal!

403
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,541
[laughing]

404
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:26,958
Time to move!

405
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,041
Yeah!

406
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:32,666
[OPHIUCHUS laughing]

407
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,166
Enough of your noise!

408
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,625
You and your king
seem pretty desperate

409
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:37,625
to get yourselves hurt.

410
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:39,666
Ya don't need to destroy
a whole world for that.

411
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,583
I got your pain right here!

412
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,500
[HAPPY] Natsu! The Liberam
still hasn't stopped!

413
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:16,750
[NATSU] Huh...

414
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:18,208
We'll have to fall back
on our usual strategy.

415
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,541
[HAPPY]
Worked pretty well last time!

416
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,750
[NATSU] And the time before!

417
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:21,916
In fact, there's nothin' better

418
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,458
when ya don't know
what you're up against!

419
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:24,916
[HAPPY] Hey! It looks like
Erza and the others

420
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,416
have the same idea!

421
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,583
[NATSU] 'Course they do!
They helped us master it!

422
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:29,916
[HAPPY]
Heck yeah, they did!

423
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,291
After all, it's Fairy Tail's
most famous tactic!

424
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:33,958
[NATSU] "Demolish everything!"

425
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,750
[HAPPY, NATSU] Next time:
When the Stars Fall!

426
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:37,958
[NATSU] All right then, Happy!

427
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:40,291
When life gives you lemons,
blow 'em up!

428
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:41,791
[HAPPY] Aye, Sir!
