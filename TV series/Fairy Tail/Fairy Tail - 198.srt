1
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,250
Princess. The wizards
can handle things

2
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:27,166
from this point on,
so we should leave.

3
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,666
I can escort you.

4
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,375
For now, it is my
duty to remain here.

5
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:34,250
I cannot desert my people
in a time of crisis.

6
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,750
[YUKINO]
But Princess. It's dangerous.

7
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,875
[LUCY]
Hey, I've got something!

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,583
[LUCY]
You need to look at this! Now!

9
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,416
[HISUI]
What do you want to show us?

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,583
[LUCY]
It's my future self's diary!

11
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:47,666
[YUKINO]
What does it say?

12
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,166
[LUCY huffs]
Read it!

13
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,541
[YUKINO] "Our one hope,
is that the Eclipse gate

14
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:57,750
in this time period
gets destroyed.

15
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:00,083
If that happens, the one
that exists in the future

16
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,708
will disappear, as well.

17
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:05,000
And none of the horrible
things will ever happen."

18
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,750
But can that be true?

19
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,875
Yes, it can't still
be around in the future

20
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:10,958
if we destroy
the gate in our time.

21
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,416
[LUCY] There will be an
entirely new future where

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,708
the eclipse was
destroyed in the past.

23
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:17,375
It'll be gone forever.

24
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:20,041
Just a part of ancient history.

25
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,458
And if it's not around,
Rogue won't have a way

26
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,791
to travel back in time.

27
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,333
But that's already
happened in our time,

28
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:27,416
so is it still
possible to change it?

29
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,916
[HAPPY]
Yeah, and if we're lucky,

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,541
Rogue and the dragons will
get out of our time for good.

31
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,583
Well, it's certainly
worth a try!

32
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:36,750
[ARCADIOS] You're right. But it
is a rather daunting task.

33
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:38,750
How can we destroy
that massive structure

34
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,541
when our resources
are spread so thin?

35
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:43,041
It won't be an easy
job, that's for sure.

36
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:45,500
[LUCY] Easy or not
we have to find a way!

37
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:49,458
The future of the entire
world is at stake here.

38
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:52,208
Let's take it down.
I made a promise to myself

39
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,708
and there's no way
I'm gonna break it.

40
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,750
We've gotta hit it
with all the magic power

41
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,250
we can muster!

42
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,708
Let's go.

43
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:42,958
Now open.

44
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,125
The Gates of all Twelve Signs!

45
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,708
[LUCY] Zodiac!
[YUKINO] The Zodiac!

46
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,583
Go! Take it down!

00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,166
[YUKINO, LUCY gasp]

[ARCADIOS, HISUI gasp]

49
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:36,250
Not a scratch?
I don't believe it!

50
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,875
[ARCADIOS] That's because
it was created from

51
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:41,333
an extremely magic-resistant
maginanium alloy.

52
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,500
Destroying it
will not be easy.

53
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:45,708
We can do it!

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,541

[NATSU]
Back to your own time!

63
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,791
[FUTURE ROGUE] I won't leave
until I'm finished here!

64
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,500
Oh yeah? Then what'll happen
to the Rogue from now?

65
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,375
[FUTURE ROGUE] He and I will
eventually merge into one.

66
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,541
Like two shadows
overlapping in darkness.

67
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,375
[NATSU]
That's not gonna happen!

68
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,416
I won't let you
take away his future!

[FUTURE ROGUE]
Frosch is dead!

[NATSU] Not today!
And, like everybody else,

87
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,333
I'm sure your
friend is terrified.

88
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,625
All because of
what you're doing.

Your buddy Lector's
here to protect ya.

92
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:19,000
[FUTURE ROGUE]
One year from now, Frosch dies.

93
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,666
[NATSU] And you couldn't
do anything about it?

94
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,166
[FUTURE ROGUE]
No. It was unavoidable.

95
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,750
So what? Frosch is alive now!

96
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,208
That doesn't matter to me!

97
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,208
Because the Rogue
that used to waste time

98
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,625
playing around with
his cat is dead as well.

99
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:40,250
[NATSU growls]
You can change that!

100
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,291
You don't understand that I'm
going to change everything.

101
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,500
After all the pain
and suffering I've seen

102
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:49,041
I know our only hope
is through total destruction!

103
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,125
That doesn't sound
like hope to me!

104
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,666
All you're gonna do
is cause more pain!

105
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,625
And that's the price that must
be paid to secure my future!

106
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:09,416
You want happiness for everyone,
but it will never happen!

00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,208
The gate was designed
to be indestructible.

162
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,458
[HISUI] What do you think
is going to happen now?

163
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,000
If we were correct,
the Eclipse should

164
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,458
cease to exist
in the future as well.

165
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,708
Which means Rogue can't use it
to travel back to our time.

166
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,708
And everything should
go back to normal.

167
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,083
[NATSU gasps]

168
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,708
The dragon is starting to glow!

169
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,458
[LUCY]
What's happening?

170
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,708
[ATLAS FLAME]
We're returning to our own time.

171
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:10,750
[COBRA] Hm. So you're finally
turnin' tail and runnin'.

172
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,625
Get lost.

173
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:16,625
[ZIRCONIS groans]
This can't be!

174
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,291
Well ain't that something.

175
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,791
It's disappearing.

176
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,625
[ZIRCONIS] No! You're just
a bunch of stupid humans!

177
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,250
There's no way you can beat me!

178
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,750
Please forgive me.

179
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,333
Don't get near him!

180
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,583
[ARCADIOS]
Princess!

181
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,291
[LAXUS]
Bad idea.

182
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,500
The gateway between
our times was created

183
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,500
as the result of my decree.

184
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,541
[HISUI] Which means,
I am solely to blame

185
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,916
for throwing your
time into disarray.

186
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:56,083
[HISUI] Your kind live
400 years in the past,

187
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:59,083
and humans live
in the present day.

188
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,541
Therefore, we were never fated

189
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:04,333
to have conflict
with each other.

190
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:08,875
But I foolishly interfered.
And I apologize for that.

191
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,166
[ZIRCONIS]
Who are you?

192
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,208
Hisui E. Fiore.

193
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,583
[ZIRCONIS]
Hisui?

194
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,250
[HISUI]
In the language of my ancestors,

195
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:22,333
it means "jade."
Same as your color.

196
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:26,000
[ZIRCONIS]
Same as me, eh?

197
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,708
Yes, that's right.

198
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,166
[ZIRCONIS]
Hm.

199
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,458
[HISUI] I shall call you
the Jade Dragon.

200
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:37,291
[ZIRCONIS] Jade Dragon, huh?
Does got a nice ring to it.

201
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:42,208
[ZIRCONIS gasps]
Hey! Wait! What's happening?

202
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:46,750
I got tricked by
a stupid human! No!

203
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,458
[WENDY, LAXUS gasp]

204
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,500
[ALL gasp]

205

[FRIED gasps]

206
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,791
[COBRA grunts]

207
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,958
So uh. Was that us?

208
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,041
I think they must've finally
beaten those dragons!

209
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,208
Yeah, I think they did too.

210
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,041
[BETH gasps]

211
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,125
[MILLIANNA gasps]

212
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,791
[ATLAS FLAME]
I will never forget you.

213
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,500
Natsu Dragneel.

214
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,791
Couldn't've done it without ya.

215
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,166
Thanks, Uncle.

216
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,833
[LUCY sighs]
They're all gone.

217
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,041
All the little
guys disappeared!

218
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,458
Did we beat 'em, guys?

219
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,791
I don't know what just
happened, but I like it!

220
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,916
[ROMEO]
I bet it was Natsu!

221
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,791
I just knew he could do it!

222
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,791
[GAJEEL]
Did the thing just vanish?

223
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,208
I can't believe
we pulled it off!

224
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,833
Yeah. Kinda.

225
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,375
This doesn't sit
right with me.

226
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:56,375
[MAVIS] All those Dragon Slayers
gave it their all.

227
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,625
But not a single one
could slay a dragon.

228
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,916
[STING]
Man, that was totally pathetic.

229
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,083
[ROGUE] And we call ourselves
"Dragon Slayers"? What a joke.

230
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,375
[STING]
Just goes to show ya

231
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,333
how tough those
things really are.

232
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:12,333
[STING] And Acnologia's
even more powerful than them.

233
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:16,333
[ROGUE] Honestly, I'd rather not
think about that right now.

234
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,208
[STING]
No doubt.

235
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,958
It's weird, we fought
all those dragons,

236
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,291
and now they're gone,

237
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,375
but it sure as hell
doesn't feel like a victory.

238
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:29,041
[JUVIA, MELDY laughing]

239
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,916
It is a victory.

240
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,083
We protected our
friends, didn't we?

241
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,083
I may not know
Rogue very well,

242
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,958
but he'll never become you.

243
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,583
[FUTURE ROGUE] The shadow.
[NATSU] Huh?

244
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,833
[FUTURE ROGUE] The shadow
will continue to follow me.

245
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,625
He's relentless.
And he won't be satisfied

246
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,791
until he's swallowed me whole.

247
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,750
And then on that
fateful day that

248
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,083
I lose Frosch,
it will finally happen.

249
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:12,333
I will be swallowed
by the darkness forever.

250
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:13,666
[NATSU]
That's not gonna happen.

251
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,833
[FUTURE ROGUE]
It most certainly will.

252
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,875
One year from now.

253
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,750
You must warn
the Rogue from your time,

254
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:23,125
to protect Frosch
one year from now.

[FUTURE ROGUE]
They will kill Frosch.

[FUTURE LUCY grunting]

259

[FUTURE NATSU]
Hey! Lucy!

261

[FUTURE NATSU]
Would ya get over here already?

00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,000
Come on, we still have
adventures to go on!

267
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,416
Yeah!

00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:07,166
[LUCY whimpering]

270
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,833
I'm crying.

271
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,625
[NATSU]
Hey, is something wrong?

272
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:26,208
[LUCY]
No, it's nothing. I'm okay.

273
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,000
[LUCY]
Thank you.

274
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,916
[HAPPY] Oh man, Natsu,
did you hear the news?

275
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,208
[NATSU] I hear a lot of things,
little buddy, what's up?

276
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,791
[HAPPY] Well, as a thank you
for saving everybody,

277
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,625
the king invited us to
a huge party at the castle!

278
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:23,000
[NATSU]
Whoa! Seriously?

279
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:24,166
[HAPPY] Oh yeah,
and you know the king

280
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,583
is gonna have the most
awesome food ever!

281
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:27,833
[NATSU] Ooh! I wonder
if they're gonna serve

282
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:30,250
some broiled fire,
or steamed fire?

283
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:33,666
[HAPPY] Uh, I don't know
about that, Natsu.

284
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,583
[HAPPY and NATSU]
Next Time: The Grand Banquet!

285
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:38,333
[NATSU] I would love to scarf
down some roasted fire, too!

286
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:41,041
[HAPPY] How in the heck can you
cook fire? With more fire?
