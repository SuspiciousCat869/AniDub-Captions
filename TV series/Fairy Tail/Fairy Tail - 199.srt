from the gate, you guys!

[LUCY screaming]

00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,500
Natsu totally
destroyed the gate!

Nice work!

Several days after

[YUKINO sighs]

00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,000
Is it absolutely necessary that

10
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,625
I wear this outfit
to the celebration?

11
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,625
Yeah! 'Cause it looks
amazing on you!

12
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,125
It looks great! Very Flattering!

13
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,500
Hey Mira. Can I
get some help here?

Don't worry. I'd bet you'd
look cute in about anything!

The Grand Banquet!

[MALE CITIZEN 199A]
Get a load of this.

17
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,750
Some folks are sayin'
that evacuation the other day

18
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,291
was 'cause there were
dragons attacking the city!

19
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,625
That's ridiculous! Everyone
knows those things ain't real!

20
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,958
[MALE CITIZEN 199C] I dunno.
A lot of people are sayin'

21
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,250
they saw 'em.

22
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,916
It was just those
wizards gettin' outta hand.

23
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,708
It can't be their fault
because the king

24
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,041
is throwing them a huge party
in the royal palace tonight!

25
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:12,208
[MALE CITIZEN 199C] Oh man.
I wish I could be there!

00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,791
[MALE CITIZEN 199B]
That's a first!

27

They've never ended the games
with a big blowout like that.

28
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,791
[MALE CITIZEN 199A]
I guess the king was just

29
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,208
really into it this year.

Well, let's party!

That get-up's
a little fancy for you.

[GAJEEL grunts]
At least I'm wearing somethin'.

36
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,708
Now be nice. We have to
get along with each other

37
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,625
and our former
competitors as well.

38
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,291
Yeah, well. Tell that to
Natsu when he gets here.

39
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,625
Wonder if he decided
to skip this thing.

40
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,708
This place is loaded
with real man food!

Aw, yeah!

[MACAO]
Hey! We're in the royal palace

44
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:13,791
so you'd better behave!

45
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,750
And the king is being
extremely generous.

46
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:16,875
Aye!

47
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,875
We'll see if that
lasts past tonight.

48
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,333
I'm sure these
hooligans will test

00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,666
the limits of his good nature.

50
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,208
The palace is amazing.

51
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,250
I could see myself
living here someday.

52
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,458
Truly a place of
glimmering beauty.

from the top! Key of B flat!

stunning on you.

The only way it could
look better is with a smile!

64
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,666
Never thought I'd see
the day the king

65
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,208
would invite me
to a royal shindig!

Old age definitely
has its perks.

[LEVY] We put everything
on the line that day.

July seventh.
We fought dragons,

69
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,375
and guaranteed the
future of the planet!

Hey, Gajeel!

to do a little writing, huh?

Yeah. Nerdy, right?

[GAJEEL]
Nah. You're just a rebel.

to be alive, ya know?

[GAJEEL]
Nothin's killed me so far.

77
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,916
[LEVY] But taking on a dragon
all by yourself like that

78
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,833
was such a dangerous
thing to do.

[HISUI] I'm glad that
you're enjoying the food.

[LUCY] Probably a little
too much to be honest.

[LUCY giggling] My dad made
quite a name for himself.

Not only that,
but he was actually

96

a personal friend of mine.

[LUCY gasps]
I had no idea.

98
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:55,583
[HISUI] Indeed. Which makes
me feel all the worse

99
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,125
for causing you so much trouble.

100

It's okay. That's the life of
a guild wizard, after all.

If we don't find trouble,
it always finds us.

By the way. I'm surprised
that pink haired boy

from your guild
isn't joining us tonight.

She's more insane than ever!

121

[LYON] You need to treat her
with more respect, Gray!

[GRAY]
What?

123
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,958
That includes respecting
her feelings as well.

124
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,791
And although I do love her,

125

it's clear she doesn't
feel the same.

[YUKA, TOBY]
Yeah, no duh!

This party is startin'
to get real annoying.

Why does Natsu get to skip it?

129
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,666
[JUVIA] It seems like he
should be here somewhere

Oh, I bet that's yummy.

You're here?

[SHELIA]
Is something the matter?

139

Uh. No. I'm just fine.

[SHELIA]
Hm?

141
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,458
[WENDY] I kinda forgot that
only people in Fairy Tail

142
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,291
can see Master Mavis.

143
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,958
[MAVIS whining] Can I have
a little bite of that?

144
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,708
I'm not sure that's gonna
work. Do ghosts even eat?

145
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:51,958
[SHELIA]
Hm?

146
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,416
[WENDY]
Excuse me, First Master,

147
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,833
but have you seen
Natsu tonight?

148
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:55,833
[MAVIS]
No.

149
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,541
Well, neither have I.

150
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,125
Which is weird
because he's usually

151
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,458
practically impossible to miss.

152
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,750
Wendy! I think there's
something near me

153
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:05,958
and it wants my food!

154
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,833
Natsu hasn't shown up?

155
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,833
That would explain why things
are relatively peaceful.

156
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,333
[FEMALE 199A]
Oh, you're so strong.

157
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,416
[FEMALE 199B]
Yeah. Such manly muscles.

158
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,083
[FRIED] Girls! Get your
hands off him right now!

159
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,708
That's weird, I guess nobody
has seen him at all today.

160
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,375
I'm sure he's fine.
He'll turn up sooner or later.

161
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,416
He's probably just
sleepin' through it.

162
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,666
[KAGURA gasps]

163
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,250
Ugh. I can hardly walk.

164
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,125
[ERZA] So you were
able to come after all.

165
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:37,875
On the mend?

166
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,041
[KAGURA]
Yes, thank you.

167
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,833
I have a proposition.

168
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,166
Can we let go of
our past and be friends?

169
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:44,958
[KAGURA]
No.

170
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,333
[ERZA gasps]

171
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:49,791
Because I'd rather
be your sister.

172
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:57,291
Do you mean it? You're
such a little sweetheart!

173
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,916
Hey, would you
please let go of me?

174
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,833
It's embarrassing.

175
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,958
[BETH, ARAÑA laughing]

176
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,125
Come on, I think
you need a hug!

177
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:14,625
Oh, Millianna. I really wish
that you'd cheer up a bit.

178
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,666
Luckily, I have just the thing.

179
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,541
Here!

180
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,750
Are ya feelin' pumped?

181
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,500
Kitty-kitty!

182
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,833
There's more.

183
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:31,666
[MILLIANNA squealing] Oh! So
many precious kitties! Meow!

184
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,416
[PANTHERLILY] Hey. We're not
your stuffed animals, you know.

185
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,916
[HAPPY] Aye. You're
squeezing way too hard.

186
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,166
[CARLA] Please! Let go!

187
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,208
[MILLIANNA] Aw, look at
those chubby wubby...

188
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,041
[ERZA] Happy, do you
know where Natsu is?

189
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,791
[HAPPY] No, I honestly
don't have a clue.

190
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,416
His absence is
beginning to worry me.

191
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,958
I hope nothing has happened.

192
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,083
[GAJEEL munching]

193
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,458
All right! I owe Natsu a drink!

194
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,666
It's good stuff. Top shelf.

195
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,375
Huh? Salamander ain't here, pal.

196
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,333
[STING] Aw, man!
After all this fighting,

197
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,458
I was trying to do
something nice for a change.

198
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,166
[LECTOR]
I guess the plan's a bust, then.

199
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,375
[FROSCH]
Well, better luck next time.

200
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,875
[GAJEEL]
Laios.

201
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,125
[ROGUE] If you don't mind,
I'd prefer to be called Rogue.

202
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,833
You need to watch yourself.

203
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,166
The you from the future
was a real piece of work.

204
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,666
Yes. I know.

205
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,750
And that would be putting
it extremely lightly.

206
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:22,083
I'm not him. I will never
become that man. I swear it.

207
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,500
I know he won't!

208
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,875
[GAJEEL chuckles]

209
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,000
Well, since Natsu
didn't show up.

210
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,333
I guess that
you're close enough.

211
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:31,166
That's right. Close enough
to knock your teeth in.

212
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,041
Cut him some slack, he's still
pretty new at bein' friendly.

213
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,416
[OLGA] I don't think I've
ever seen him act like this.

214
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,416
If he has, I'd
certainly remember it.

215
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:46,041
[STING] A toast.
To the Fairies and Tigers!

216
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,416
[STING laughing]

217
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,916
[ALL gasp]

218
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,125
Look who's here!

219
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,000
Sorry. I don't think
I can do this right now.

220
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,083
[STING]
Wait!

221
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,583
[YUKINO gasps]

222
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,000
[STING] Please, stick around
for a little while at least.

223
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,916
The master and milady
are gone for good.

224
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,375
They won't be here.

225
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,750
[LUCY]
Huh?

226
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,541
[STING] Look. I'm sorry
for the way we treated you.

227
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,166
But we're starting
everything over from scratch.

228
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,750
The way we were...
was wrong.

229
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,750
But the old Sabertooth
guild is history now.

230
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,833
From here on out,
we'll be the kind of guild

231
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:29,541
that treats our
members like family.

232
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,625
Well, then I wish you the best
of luck with all of that.

233
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,916
[STING] I know that
the wounds are still fresh.

234
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,083
But I'd love it if you
were part of it again.

235
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:41,791
[KAGURA] Are you kidding me?
Don't be such an idiot!

236
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,291
[YUKINO]
Kagura?

237
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,791
Did everybody just forget
that her life is in my hands?

238
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,750
So since I'm the one
making the rules here,

239
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,500
I say she's gotta
join Mermaid Heel.

240
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:50,750
[ALL]
What?

241
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,458
Huh?

242
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,083
You're completely wasted!

243
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:59,333
It doesn't matter! She belongs
with us and you can't stop it!

244
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,125
[BOTH growling]

245
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,083
[ERZA]
Stop right there!

246
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,208
We won't stand by
while you decide her fate!

247
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,541
We're manly.

248
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,625
That's right! And if she
chooses to be in any guild

249
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:09,583
it'd better be ours!

250
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah!

251
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,541
Personally, I think there
are already too many girls

252
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,458
in Fairy Tail to compete
for Gray's attention.

253
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,208
[LISANNA]
And she's too much like me.

254
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,583
Yeah. You're both
the little sister types

255
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,583
with the exact same hair!

256
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,750
I never thought about
joining Fairy Tail.

257
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:26,041
[EVE] No way. A woman that's
as beautiful as you are.

258
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,416
[HIBIKI] Deserves nothing less
than the most beautiful guild.

259
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,625
[REN]
So join us.

260
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,375
[ICHIYA] You've such
an intoxicating parfum.

261
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,125
We'd love to have you!

262
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,000
If she wants to be
with the best guild,

263
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,375
there's no question she should
become part of Lamia Scale.

264
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,875
[JURA] Let's not get
involved with this.

265
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,125
Get in our guild now!

266
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,375
Don't be rude.

267
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,958
We've always been
totally macho,

268
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,583
but I think Quattro Cerberus
could use a womanly touch!

269
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,458
I know that we lost
the Grand Magic Games,

270
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,958
but there ain't no way in hell
we're gonna lose this battle!

00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,000

Don't do this!

[MAKAROV]
Time for another Fairy Tail win!

274
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,208
[GOLDMINE]
I'd like to show everybody here

275
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,500
what a wild spirit can do!

276
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:01,791
[OHBA]
I'll spin you!

277
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,666
[BOB] All these hot-blooded
suitors remind me

278
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,125
of my younger days.

279
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,125
Now the masters
are getting involved?

280
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,125
This is crazy!

281
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,083
That's love for ya!

282
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,000
C'mon!

283
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,541
Manly battle!

284
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:13,833
Just give up!

Yank out Makarov's mustache!

Don't you dare, old hag!

[MALE SOLDIER 199A]
Whoa! They're out of control!

[YUKINO whimpering]

290
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,750
[MIRAJANE] Aw, there's
nothing to cry about.

291
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:36,833
[YUKINO] I know. But all
of you make me so happy.

292

It's wonderful to see you smile!

Whatever you choose,

00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,791
there's definitely
a place for you.

297

Thank you.

00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,916
Everyone stop! This instant!

313
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,375
Hungry Wolf Knights. Get him.

314
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,458
[KAMA] Sorry, but this
is just too much.

315
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:51,416
[MAKAROV groaning]

316
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,916
[MATO]
That's enough, okay!

317
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,208
[NATSU] Oh come on! After all,
we won your little games!

318
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,500
[MATO]
Please give it back!

319
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,416
[NATSU] For the rest
of today, I am your king!

320
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,291
Now do what I say!

321
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,791
We should've seen
this one coming.

322
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,666
Aye, sir!

323
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,500
[NARRATOR] We've seen
some fierce competition

324
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,375
over the course of
the Grand Magic Games.

325
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:24,083
We've also witnessed
an amazing show of solidarity,

326
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:27,708
as wizards from opposing
guilds banded together

327
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,583
to secure the future
of the kingdom.

328
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,625
And now, they've
gathered once more

329
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:37,083
in the spirit of
celebration. However...

330
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:49,416
[JUVIA whimpering]

331
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,875
[FRIED grunts]

332
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,208
[LAXUS gasps]

333
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,583
[FRIED whimpers]

334
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:04,041
[NATSU munching]

335
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,875
[NATSU gags]

336
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,125
[LUCY]
Here ya go!

337
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,083
[NATSU gulps]

338
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,375
Did you forget to chew?

339
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:14,416
[HISUI]
Father.

340
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,583
[NATSU, LUCY]
Huh?

341
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:20,916
[TOMA]
Hisui.

342
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,875
I beg your forgiveness.

343
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,750
My actions brought
shame to the kingdom.

344
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,916
Once the festivities are over,

345
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,208
I will accept whatever
punishment you see fit.

346
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,875
But, Princess...

347
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:39,125
[ARCADIOS]
Please wait.

348
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,666
[HISUI]
Colonel Arcadios.

349
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,916
With all due respect,
I must intercede

350
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,583
on the Princess's behalf.

351
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,500
The Eclipse began as
a means to defeat Zeref.

352
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,291
The debacle with
the Eclipse Two was

353
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:52,083
the result of that time
traveler's deception.

354
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,041
Due to his other
accurate predictions.

355
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,416
She was led to believe
it was the only way

356
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,791
to save Fiore
from total annihilation.

357
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:02,291
[DARTON] That's true.
Her intentions were pure.

358
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,125
All for the sake of the kingdom.

359
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,333
Darton...

360
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,625
[LUCY]
It was more than that!

361
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:07,875
[ALL grunt]

362
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,541
The princess did
whatever she could

363
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,875
to protect the future
of the entire world!

364
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:15,375
[ERZA] Yes. She has
done nothing wrong.

365
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,375
She had the best
intentions in mind.

366
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:20,875
I implore you to forgive
her transgressions.

367
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,583
Punish her or not, it won't
change what happened.

368
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,250
Besides, she was
able to get every wizard

369
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,208
in Fiore to work as a team.

370
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,208
Aye, sir!

371
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,083
Yeah. That's a good point.

372
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,291
If not for the
princess's actions,

373
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:36,958
Fiore may have very well
remained a kingdom divided.

374
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:40,458
[HISUI gasps]
Thank you.

375
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,375
Gray and I had drifted apart.

376
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,208
But now we're two
hearts beating as one!

377
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:47,041
Can you please contain
your insanity for a second?

378
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,833
It's true. We've all
gained so much from this.

379
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:53,083
Yes. Notably, a new
sense of purpose.

380
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,833
Yeah! I think so, too!

381
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,166
Things are awesome.

382
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,958
I mean, even the
knuckleheads in Sabertooth

383
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,791
have started gettin' along.

384
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:03,208
Listen everyone!
By the power vested in me!

385
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,583
I declare the princess
not guilty!

386
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,458
She makes the rules
far as I'm concerned.

387
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,375
[BETH, ARAÑA] That's right!
[MILLIANNA] Meow!

388
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,000
You should probably
stay out of this.

389
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,583
You're way too drunk
to be in this conversation!

390
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:14,750
What did you say?

391
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,791
Are y'all tryin' to tell
Kagura what to do?

392
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:21,000
Silence! You are in the
presence of His Majesty!

393
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:24,041
[WIZARDS gasping]

394
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,500
I have considered
all of your arguments.

395
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,208
However, she is accountable.

396
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,708
[ARCADIOS] Your majesty.
I will accept all of the blame!

397
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,875
Majesty. I am the one who
should be punished for this.

398
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,625
You should just go ahead
and punish all of us, too!

399
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,875
[TOMA]
Arcadios' loyalty to Hisui,

400
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,791
and Darton's loyalty
to the kingdom,

401
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:01,625
these both please me greatly.

402
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,125
But what pleases
me most of all...

403
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,166
...are the brave
wizards assembled here

404
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,291
that work tirelessly for peace.

405
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,666
Father...

406
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,000
In light of all this,

407
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,416
I've conceived a
suitable punishment.

408
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:28,166
[TOMA] You must wear the
pumpkin head for an entire week!

409
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,166
Huh?

410
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,416
[ARCADIOS] Your Majesty.
This is the punishment?

411
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,625
[DARTON] This is all
she's required to do?

412
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,500
A dose of humility.
Once this week is over,

413
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:40,208
the slate will be clean.
My sweet Hisui.

414
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,375
[ARCADIOS]
Hm.

415
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:42,708
[DARTON chuckles]

416
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,500
That's wonderful.
Aren't you happy?

417
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,083
Yes Punkin.

[WIZARDS laughing]

419
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,416
They've grown so strong.

[MAKAROV grunts]

421
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:03,500
The weight of the world
will be safe on their shoulders.

422
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,791
Yes.

423
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,875
Listen. I'd like to
thank you for everything

424
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,166
you've done, punkins.

425
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,166
This has gotta be just a
little embarrassing. Punkin!

426
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,208
Naw. It seems like a lot
of fun to me. Punkin!

427
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,125
Aw. Yeah, I think
so too, punkin!

428
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:21,625
[TOMA] I do have extras
if you'd like to wear one, too!

429
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:22,875
[NATSU, LUCY, HAPPY]
Huh?

430
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,708

00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:41,916
[WIZARDS laughing]

435
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,208
[HAPPY] Hey Natsu,
have you thought about

436
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:16,125
what you wanna do
when we get back home?

437
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,208
[NATSU] I wanna go on
a bunch of awesome jobs!

438
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,000
[HAPPY] I think I'd
rather go fishing!

439
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,083
[NATSU] Oh yeah, we haven't
done that in forever!

440
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,208
[HAPPY] I totally found
the world's best fishing spot

441
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:27,250
a while ago. The biggest
one there was humongous!

442
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,458
I wanna get him
in my belly so bad!

443
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:32,583
[NATSU] Sounds like fun to me!
Mind if I tag along with ya?

444
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:34,958
[NATSU and HAPPY]
Next Time: Droplets of Time!

445
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,416
[NATSU] I gotta wonder
how things are going

446
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,750
back in ol' Magnolia.

447
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:39,041
[HAPPY] I bet they'll all
be happy when the Champs

448
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:41,916
of the Grand Magic Games
are back in town!
