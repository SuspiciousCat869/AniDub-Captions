[DAN] I, Dan Straight,

31
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:04,250
was born in the glorious
seaport city of Seder.

32
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,083
Ah, good ol' Seder...

33
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,916
Home to an ancient brotherhood
of knights who protected

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,500
the town and its
church for generations.

35
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:15,750
My own family came from
a long line of these knights.

36
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,458
As a successor to this
proud family line, I lived

37
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:21,625
a happy, pampered childhood
filled with camaraderie,

38
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,541
and the finest of juices.

39
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,541
Unfortunately,
those peaceful times

40
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,041
were not fated
to last forever...

41
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,750
One day, without warning,
a civil war erupted and

42
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,291
split the city in two!

43
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,666
Wow, I never woulda
thought that you

44
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,500
had such a messed up past.

45
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,375
And your poor family
was dragged into

46
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:41,166
the fighting and had
to struggle to survive.

47
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,208
No... The fighting
ended in half a day,

48
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,625
so we made it out
relatively unscathed.

49
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,416
And everyone started
getting along again

50
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,625
pretty quickly, too!

51
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:50,666
That was quick!

52

We've had more
intense scuffles

Hang on to your skirt;
the story's just beginning!

55
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,166
A few years later,
I fell head over heels

56
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,625

57
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,541
A beautiful, young maiden
who went to school with me.

58
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,708
I was forced to go to war
and when I came back,

59
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:08,125
I searched high and low, but
I couldn't find her anywhere!

60
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,666
So this girl
went missing?

61
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,166
Don't tell me she got caught up
in the fighting somehow!

62
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,958
She must've lost
her life in battle

63
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,375
how heartbreakingly tragic!

64
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,500
Her beauty was
unlike any other.

65
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:20,208
Actually, Loopyloo
looks kinda like her.

It's so sad I
can't stand it!

67
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,166
That's why you fell
for Lucy as soon as

68
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,916
you laid eyes on her!

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,416
I feel kinda bad...

70
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,000
but I didn't think he was gonna
share everything with us.

71
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,750
So, what? Did you find
her body somewhere?

72
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,708
Actually... I found
her completely unharmed!

73
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,083
[ALL] Are you kidding me?!

74
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,208
Great, right...?
Unfortunately, our union

75
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,583
didn't end up quite like
I had hoped it would.

76
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,125
My daily marriage
proposals brought her

77
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,791
so much happiness,
they frightened her!

78
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,625
In the end, her fear
got the best of her,

79
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,375
and she decided she wasn't
worthy of my affection.

80
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,541
And, though it took time,
I realized she was right.

81
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,166
I can't help but
notice that the pictures

82
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,833
and his story don't
really seem to match up.

83
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,208
Yeah, it's obvious
she couldn't stand the guy.

84
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,875
[DAN] Ultimately,
she rejected my proposal

85
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:07,375
and I cried my eyes out for
three full days and nights.

86
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,583
I decided to set out
on a sentimental journey

87
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:12,333
to soothe my
sorrow-ridden heart.

88
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,791
During my travels,
I crossed paths with many

89
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:18,500
a lovely maiden;
each with her own charm.

90

catcallin' slime ball to me.

91

So the point of your
journey wasn't to find a girl

92

who reminded you
of your first love?

93
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,541
Nah I'll never find
true love if I limit myself!

94
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,125
The world's a buffet...
And every gal is a dish

00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,958
I'm dyin' to try!

96
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,125
This guy is really
starting to piss me off.

97
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,000
[DAN] Due to unavoidable
circumstances, no fault

98
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,833
of my own of course,
I was forced to part ways

99
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,291
with each girl I met.

100
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,666
[DAN] Because I devoted
my life to the knighthood

101
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,875
I will never know what it's
like to have love and peace.

102
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,375
Yeah, the story and
pictures still don't match up.

103
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,916
I think it's obvious
they all dumped him and ran.

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,958
It kind of makes you wonder
if someone other than

105
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,041
the storyteller drew
all of the pictures.

106
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,000
Hughes and Sugarboy
did them for me.

107
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,625
They used entries from my travel
journal and some old photos

108
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:01,916
I had as a reference.

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,625
Naturally there
was guesswork involved,

110
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,583
which means some parts might
not be entirely accurate.

111
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,458
I'm pretty sure the
pictures are more accurate

112
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,291
than your story, bub.

113
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,083
[DAN] Eventually, I joined
the Legion Platoon.

114
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:16,083
Since then, I've dedicated
my life to gathering

115

That's great... But we
really just wanted the story

Byro would dish out

some fierce punishment.

00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,041
Then what was the point
of that stupid story, jerk?!

127
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,833
Yeah, it made no sense,
and the production value sucked.

We won't get anywhere if we keep
messin' around with this wacko.

Unfortunately we
can't just pick up

and leave
this place either.

139

140
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,583
their clock pieces
and meet us here.

Get over here and help me!

Why worry about her
in the first place?

She is our enemy.

That might be the case,
but she's still a little girl,

possible...

157
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,541
What are you
saying, Coco?!

158
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,583
Don't forget, you're a
member of the Legion Platoon

159
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,166
and accomplishing your
mission always comes first!

160
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,458
Well Sammy, if you want
that clock piece, come get it.

161
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,708
I dare ya!

162
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,000
Please do refrain
from abbreviating my name.

163
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,333
Samuel will do
just fine, thank you.

164
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,416
Don't worry,
I can take him down.

165
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,416
You guys focus on digging
up that clock piece as fast

166
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,708
as you can.

167
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,458
You're Pantherlily,
correct?

168
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,750
I'm honored to meet
a senior Exceed.

169
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,208
Y'know when
you think about it,

170
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,750
that essentially makes you
like an older brother to me.

171
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,916
You are not worthy of
calling yourself my brother!

172
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,875
Now, now, don't be
so coldhearted!

173
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,791
I mean, we're both Exceeds.
We should at least try

174
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,083
to be friendly...
"Brother".

175
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,208
You'll have to
do better than

176
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,750
that to vex
me, "Sammy".

177
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,916
Come on. Let's go
dig up the clock piece

178
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,416
while Lily
keeps him busy.

179
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,166
Alright, fine...
Don't blame me if you lose!

180
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,083
I know all
about you, Lily.

181
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,125
Despite being an Exceed,
you sided with the humans.

182
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,833
How did our brethren
take that, I wonder?

183
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,083
What I did was
based on my convictions!

184
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,583
And I have never
once regretted my decision.

185
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,750
I can tell that you've
got quite a temper.

186
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,666
You'd gain much from
being craftier, like me.

187
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,125
Logic trumps brute force.

188
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,666
Sorry, pal, but
I've never been

189
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,333
the type to think in terms
of gains and losses.

190
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,208
I see. A shame
we don't have much

191
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,916
in common, "Brother".

192
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,416
[PANTHERLILY] Stop yammering
and fight me "Sammy"!

193
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,958
I'm happy to oblige.

194
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,250
En garde!

195
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,541
I'm much more than just
a bookworm with wings.

196
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,333
Allow me to demonstrate!

197
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:20,750
[digging]

198
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,916
[explosion]

199
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,708
Where in the
heck are we?!

200
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,208
[DROY] Those are some
weird lookin' statues!

201
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,375
Don't run away!

202
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,750
Come face me like
a true warrior!

203
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,291
Charging into a sword
head-on is a practice best left

204
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,291
to imbeciles and cannon fodder.

205
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,250
An intelligent fighter
considers strategy,

206
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,166
methodology, and outcomes
before they attack!

207
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,333
[SAMUEL] You have
no chance of winning...

208
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,791
The Legion Platoon has endured
training far more intense

209
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,791
than you can imagine.
Therefore, we can cope

210
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,500
with any situation!
My victory's assured!

211
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:07,375
[PANTHERLILY] Dammit!

212
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,041
Precisely as I calculated!

213
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,916
I even impress myself!

214
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,083
Now according to
my calculations,

215
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,208
he should've
landed around here.

216
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,166
[PANTHERLILY]
Behind ya, Sammy!

217
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,791
You're remarkably
stubborn. Aren't you?

218
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,291
I'm not gonna
fall for the same trick

219
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,625
twice in a row!

220
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,375
And I know Gajeel is gonna
find that clock piece

221
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:34,416
any moment now. Your victory
is far from assured!

222
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,708
[SAMUEL] Such confidence...

223
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,291
Are you not aware the ruins
are filled with traps?

224
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,833
You can't
be serious!

225
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,416
[JET] Nothin' up here!

226
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,208
[DROY] I don't see anything that
looks like a clock piece...

227
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,375
Hmmm...

228
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,875
There's something
scribbled on this one.

229
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,458
[LEVY] Lemme see... It says
"I'm hungry". Weird, huh?

230
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:56,083
[JET] Hey!
From way up here...

231
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:59,250
it kinda looks
like a clock face.

232
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,791
Wait, does that
mean... it should point

233
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,416
at "snack time" or somethin'?

234
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,250
Sounds good
to me!

235
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,291
[GAJEEL chuckles]

236
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,708
So all we gotta
do is move it, huh?

237
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,541
[SAMUEL] I told you,
there's more to me than

238
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,625
just intelligence. My combat
skills are unparalleled.

239
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,625
Statistically, you've got
no chance of winning!

240
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,125
[PANTHERLILY]
Gajeel... Please be careful!

241
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:44,916
[rumbling]

242
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,708
[crash]

243
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,750
Looks like
we found it!

244
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,666
[DROY] It's an
actual clock face.

245
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,458
Was there a
reason for that?

246
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,166
It smelled like iron; I
just wanted to make sure.

247
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,583
Well, now that you know,
you can carry it.

248
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,458
[LEVY] There's some writing...
I bet I can read it.

249
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,333
We don't got time to study
the thing, sweetheart.

250
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,916
[LEVY] No, wait!
Don't take it off!

251
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:22,166
[explosion]

252
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,666
I tried to tell you!
It says, "Warning!

253
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,750
He who takes this shall face the
wrath of the rock guardian!"

254
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,541
[piercing noise]

255
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,541
I told you not
to take it, but no,

256
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,375
you just had to go
and do it anyway!

257
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,000
Next time
talk faster!

258
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,375
Next time
listen to me!

259
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,833
[DROY and JET] Could you
save the arguing for later?!

260
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,041
[SAMUEL] It appears
that your comrades

261
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,583
have managed to
spring the trap.

262
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,500
Precisely
as I calculated!

263
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,500
I see... So that's
the reason

264
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:53,291
you drew me away from
them. You planned this!

265
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,791
You're powerful
and you can fly.

266
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,750
That made you
a prime target.

267
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,083
Taking all threats
out of the picture

268
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,833
is essential
for victory.

269
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:06,083
[piercing noise]

270
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,833
I think whatever's
emitting that red light

271
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,458
is the control
mechanism!

272
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,500
Yeah, and I bet
that's its weak spot!

273
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,208
All right, ugly!
Team Shadowgear's about

274
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,666
to chew you up
and spit you out!

275
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:21,083
[LEVY] I'll immobilize it first!
Solid Script Magic!

276
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,750
Oil!

277
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,958
Now it's my turn
to bring the pain!

278
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,958
Chain plant... Grow!

279
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:42,375
Time for me to finish it
off! High Speed!

280
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,125
See that? Does Shadow
Gear rule, or what?

281
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,583
Not too shabby but
it ain't over yet.

282
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,291
Catch him!

283
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,625
Right!

284
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,000
You okay?

285
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,833
Other than being covered
in oil I'm just fine!

286
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,666
Incoming!

287
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,416
[JET] Here goes round two!

288
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,458
[JET screams]

289
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,916
[LEVY] Oh no, Jet!

290
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,500
Sorry, you guys...

291
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,541
My high speed is useless when
I'm all slicked up like this.

292
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,458
Looks like
it's up to me!

293
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,791
[DROY yells]

294
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,583
[stops yelling and pants]

295
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,458
[pants hard]

296
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:31,625
[yells]

297
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,750
I knew I should've
gone on a diet sooner.

298
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,625
They're both down.
Guess it's up to me!

299
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,833
Don't be stupid!
Let me handle this!

300
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,291
I'm perfectly capable
of handling this myself!

301
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:48,541
[GAJEEL yells] 

302
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,625
I saw that one coming!

303
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,625
[PANTHERLILY] Taking a battle
form like this is strange

304
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,375
for an Exceed
born in Earth Land.

305
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,916
Yet it's the truth. I
was born in this world,

306
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,875
the same as your
friends Happy and Carla.

307
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,583
Then explain to me
why you chose to side

308
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,708
with the Legion Platoon!

309
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,291
Why do you refuse
to show compassion

310
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,875
for those who share
your circumstances?!

311
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,500
Zentopia took me in after
I was hatched and gave me

312
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,583
a place to call my own.

313
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,208
Lord Byro has been nothing
short of a father to me!

314
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,541
I owe everything
to Zentopia

315
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,125
and the Legion Platoon.

316
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,291
Repaying that debt is far
more important to me than

317
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,375
the Exceeds or Edolas!

318
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,708
Almost there!

319
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,541
So what now?

320
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,416
Damn! If we
don't get on top

321
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,708
of that thing,
we'll be at this forever!

322
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:51,875
Gajeel!

323
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,041
[SAMUEL] It's just as my
calculations predicted.

324
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,166
I will defeat you,
"Brother",

325
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,041
while the ancient guardian
takes care of your comrades.

326
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,208
And then, once the
dust has settled,

327
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,500
I will take the
clock piece at my leisure!

328
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,833
Fightin' on an empty
stomach ain't helpin'.

329
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,958
I need some iron and quick!

330
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,083
I guess I could bite
a chunk off of this thing.

331
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,291
We need that,
metal head!

332
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,791
Find something
else to munch on!

333
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,125
Cool it, princess, I was
just playin' around!!

334
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,458
Do you think we need
to be making jokes

335
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,916
at a time like this?

336
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,083
Run Gajeel!

337
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,416
It's trying to get the
clock piece back from us!

338
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,875
Ah, well that makes things
a lot easier. [chuckles]

339
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:28,875
You hold onto it!

340
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,000
[screams]

341
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,541
No, I don't wanna!

342
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,375
[screams]

343
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,458
[yells]

344
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,375
Go get him!

345
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,458
He can't!

346
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,833
Dragon Slayer Secret Art...

347
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:47,166
Karmic Demon...
Iron God Sword!

348
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,166
Our business
here is done!

349
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,708
Finish yours up so we
can get outta this dump.

350
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:59,458
It's inconceivable!
How can this be?!

351
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,291
I've never once
come across anybody

352
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,125
who can elude my
calculations!

353
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,333
Perhaps they
were incorrect,

354
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:05,875
but if that's the case,
all my strategizing

355
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,916
was completely meaningless!
I can't take this!

356
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,666
It makes no sense!

357
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,000
A fight's a dynamic thing...

358
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,083
Strategy helps, but you
must be able to adapt

359
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,500
when things go wrong.

360
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,333
It looks to me like
you've still got

361
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,166
a lot of learning
to do, "Sammy."

362
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,541
My name is Samuel,
you troglodyte!

363
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:25,958
You've left
yourself open!

364
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:36,875
[bone cracking]

365
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,000
[groans]

366
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,958
Still, you are not
without talent...

367
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,083
If you challenge me
again in the future,

368
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,958
I'll be happy
to oblige you.

369
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,000
I know when it's time
to admit defeat.

370
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,833
And thanks to our fight,
I now realize there are

371
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,416
people in this world
who defy calculation.

372
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,875
So you've realized
your own inexperience?

373
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,625
On the contrary!
It's quite obvious that

374
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,416
I simply failed to anticipate
all of the variables!

375
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,875
Next time I'll be
sure to incorporate

376
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,333
every possible detail
into my calculations!

377
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,958
And then I'll show you
barbarians the power of

378
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,208
the only muscle
that truly matters!

379
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,958
But right now I need
to record every single bit

380
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,291
of data from this fight while
it's still fresh in my memory!

381
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:11,625
[punch]

382
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,375
[PANTHERLILY] Who're you
calling a barbarian, huh?!

383
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:20,458
Looks like Exceeds come in
all types too, don't they?

384
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:23,375
What's wrong? Miss him
already? "Brother"?

385
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,333
We're not related
in the slightest.

386
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,708
[ELFMAN] Check it out!
The lake is shrinking!

387
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,125
Guess Lisanna must've
found something down there.

388
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,083
[BOTH gasp]

389
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,375
Good work, Sis!
You found it!

390
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,125
I'm just glad that I
was able to be useful

391
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,125
for a change. I was beginning
to feel like a third wheel.

392
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,208
Silly, huh?

393
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,333
Nah, I noticed it, too.

394
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,500
[MIRAJANE] Okay! Let's grab
the clock piece and meet up

395
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,958
with the others!

396
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,583
It's heavy!
Manly throw!

397
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,125
What'd you do that for?!

398
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,625
Aw, not her!

399
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,958
[MARY] Thanks a lot, big guy.

400
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,791
I should thank all three
of you for helping me

401
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,708
get the clock piece without,
like, having to get wet.

402
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,750
[LISANNA]
Isn't she...?

403
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:29,875
[ELFMAN] Yeah, she's
that annoying girl

404
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,375
from the
Legion Platoon.

405
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,250
[MIRAJANE] Care to explain
how you knew where to find us?

406
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,625
I followed you here.
I figured it was easier

407
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,291
to let you find it,
and then totally steal it

408
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,791
right out from under you.
I'm, like, a genius!

409
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,666
Although, technically
I guess it was Samuel's idea.

410
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,583
Ha! Three against one?
Nice strategy!

411
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,916
Crap! I forgot!

412
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,666
You can try to fight it,
but that's not gonna help ya.

413
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,375
There's, like,
nothing you can do!

414
00:19:56,458 --> 00:20:00,041
As long as I have this baton you
losers are totally my puppets!

415
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,833
[NATSU] Man, I can't believe
they're still goin' at it.

416
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:08,375
I dunno about you guys
but I'm gettin' hungry.

417
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,291
What part of "No!"
don't you get?!

418
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,500
"No!" doesn't exist in the
dictionary of love, Looeypie!

419
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,041
Creep! Perv!
Find someone else to try

420
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,166
and feel up!

421
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,541
You do realize that
she's not the only

422
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,250
girl down here, right?
Michelle is a proper young lady

423
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,833
with a body that won't quit,
if you know what I mean.

424
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,458
Hmmm...

425
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,083
Uh... hi.

426
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,750
I see what you're sayin';
she's pretty and all

427
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,583
but I like my girls to have
a little more life to 'em.

428
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,125
I don't get it; I
guess he's got a thing

429
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,708
for loud-mouthed tomboys.

430
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,250
Are you tryin' to
sneak in a jab, cat?

431
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,458
Shall I punish him
for you... Princess?

432
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,000
What the heck are you
doing here, Virgo?

433
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,458
I didn't summon you!

434
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:45,833
You know I'm always
ready, willing,

435
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,500
and able to offer my help
in your times of need.

436
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:52,791
Princess? I had no idea
Lucy was actually royalty!

437
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,000
Of course she is!
That explains why she's

438
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,000
so kind and beautiful!

439
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,541
[VIRGO] Princess... I could
put him deep in the ground

440
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,208
if that would please you.

441
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:05,333
[LUCY] Well that, uh... might...
be a... little... harsh.

442
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,333
Hello there. Are you
Loo-loo's maid?

443
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,958
In that case, I'd like
you to prepare a meal

444
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,291
for the two of us!

445
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,791
Something romantic to
kindle the fires of love!

446
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,125
I'm not ready to prepare
a meal, I'm afraid,

447
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,625
but I can entertain
you, if you'd like.

448
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,208
Not that again.
Wait a minute,

449
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:22,125
why are you listening to
him in the first place?!

450
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,416
I can't believe you
know my hometown's dance!

451
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,416
And you perform it with the
grace of a native to boot!

452
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,416
I've performed this
dance countless times before,

453
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,250
but I've never been
praised for it until now.

454
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,791
[LUCY] Hold on,
are they flirting?!

455
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,541
[HAPPY] Well, if you ask me,
they're perfect for each other.

456
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,000
It appears I've diffused
the situation, Princess.

457
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,875
If you need anything
else, let me know.

458
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,875
[LUCY] What...? I thought
you were getting rid of him!

459
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,250
[BYRO] How disappointing...
I expected you would have

460
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,958
the clock piece.

461
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,958
[DAN] That voice!
It's Lord Byro!

462
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,833
[NATSU] You mean,
the octo-jerk?!

463
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,166
[BYRO] I cannot understand
why the two of you seem

464
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,416
to be having such difficulty.

465
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,416
Our deepest apologies,
Lord Byro!

466
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,125
I'm terribly ashamed!
I allowed myself to become

467
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,958
distracted from my
objective; forgive me, sir!

468
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,125
However, I am happy to
report that this holy ground

469
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,291
is where I met the
girl of my dreams-

470
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,250
You deserved that.

471
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,416
Fall back and reflect
on your incompetence while

472
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,041
I clean up the
mess you've made.

473
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,250
Isn't that...?!

474
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,208
Mr. Jude's piece
of the clock!

475
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:29,125
Hey, Octo-geezer! That clock
hand belongs to Lucy!

476
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:31,750
[NATSU] Hand it over, or I'll
come up there and roast ya!

477
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,458
[HAPPY] And I'll scratch ya!

478
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:36,666
I warn you. You won't
live to regret it.

479
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:47,083
♪

480
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,333
[NATSU] What's with these
guys?! All we ever hear

481
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:17,708
from them is blah blah "holy
war", blah blah "clock piece."

482
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,666
[HAPPY] Well, They have
goals just like we do.

483
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,916
[NATSU] Whatever!
Just let me at 'em already!

484
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,625
[HAPPY] Let's just hope
they're all as simpleminded

485
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:24,958
as you are, huh?

486
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:26,416
[NATSU] If I didn't
know any better I'd say

487
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,750
you were insulting me.

488
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,291
[HAPPY] Whaddya mean?
It was a compliment!

489
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:32,875
[HAPPY and NATSU] Next time:
The Course of the Holy War!

490
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:35,041
Well, at least I'm not
a war monger, right?

491
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:37,708
[HAPPY] I would be if it gave
me a bigger role in the story.

492
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:39,000
[NATSU] Whoa...!
Sounds like somebody's

493
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:41,333
got their goals mixed up.
