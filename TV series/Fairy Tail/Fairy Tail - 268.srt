1
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,041
My name is Mavis Vermillion.

2
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,583
And for the past seven years,

3
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:26,500
I've been studying strategies
for taking on wizard guilds.

4
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,291
Together, we can beat them.

5
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:31,166
No, Mavis. You've got
to be kidding me!

6
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,791
I humbly ask you
take me with you.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,750
The Tenrou Orb is the
symbol of this island.

8
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:42,708
My people have protected this
sacred relic for generations.

9
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,083
I must fix this.

10
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:46,583
This treasure belongs
to the island,

11
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:49,375
and it's my duty to
see it's returned.

12
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,375
Please, don't.

13
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,791
Just to be clear,
we're treasure hunters.

14
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,291
Even if we do find the thing,

15
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:58,125
there's no guarantee we're just
gonna give it back to you.

16
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,166
Then you and I can have
another game of wits

17
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,625
whenever that time comes.

18
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:05,708
But right now, we share a
common goal of finding it.

19
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:07,416
Not to mention, you
still have to make good

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,791
on the promise you made.

21
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:10,708
I wanna meet a fairy!

22
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:11,916
[YURI]
Huh?!

23
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,916
Okay! Let our adventure begin!

24
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:58,458
[MAVIS]
Wow!

25
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,625
[MAVIS giggles]

26
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,583
[MAVIS]
It's beautiful!

27
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:06,458
I love the ocean.
There's no end to it!

28
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:10,000
And there's nothing like the
feel of salty air on my skin!

29
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,125
Hello there, seagulls!

30
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:15,500
I bet you're doing
your yearly migration.

31
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:16,708
You've lived on an island

32
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,458
in the middle of the
sea your entire life,

33
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:19,666
how is this exciting?

34
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,708
Seeing it from land
is way different.

35
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,458
Being out here on the
open water like this

36
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,541
gives me a whole
new perspective!

37
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,208
Whatever you say, Missy.

38
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,333
[MAVIS]
Really! This is incredible!

39
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,708
All right!
No stopping till Hargeon!

40
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,000
I know we'll find information
there that will lead us

41
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,583
right to Blue Skull
and the Tenrou Orb!

42
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,208
Yeah, we are definitely
gonna find that treasure,

43
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:44,583
but make no mistake,
once we do that, it's ours.

44
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,375
[MAVIS]
Interesting.

45
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:05,791
It looks like you're
adjusting the sail

46
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,958
to be at a right angle to
the wind, is that true?

47
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,416
You got it.

48
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,791
I know just how to tweak the
sail to get us there fast.

49
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,083
That's really fascinating to me.

50
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,541
I've never sailed,

51
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:19,833
but I've read a lot about it
in the library back home.

52
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:20,916
[MAVIS]
Although...

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,500
[YURI]
What?

54
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,708
[MAVIS] I think we should shift
the sail a bit farther forward.

55
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:28,041
Roughly five degrees if we wanna
maximize the power of the wind.

56
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,875
Oh, yeah?

57
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:33,250
[MAVIS] Hmm. Okay,
maybe one degree more.

58
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,500
[YURI]
Is that good?

59
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,833
[MAVIS]
Ah! Hold on!

60
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,583
The wind just started
blowing north-northwest!

61
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,083
[YURI]
Huh?

62
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,500
[MAVIS] Hurry! Bring it back
two, no, wait, four degrees!

63
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:42,750
[YURI]
Stop!

64
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,875
I'm kind of an expert at
this stuff, remember?

65
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,291
How about you stick
with what you know?

66
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,875
I'm sorry, I wasn't
trying to bother you.

67
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,708
I'll leave you be.

68
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,375
Let's go, Zera.

69
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,916
[ZERA]
But where else is there to go?

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,458
We can explore.

71
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:59,708
[ZERA] Seriously? I don't wanna
make anyone else mad at us.

72
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,750
Stop worrying!

73
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,000
Oh, great.

74
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,333
[MAVIS gasps]

75
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,875
Ugh, it's mustier
than our library.

76
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,166
I bet this is all treasure!

77
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,625
Hello, what are you
doing over there?

78
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,750
Just messin' around with
this fish-catching gun.

79
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,750
Do you mean you shoot them?

80
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,916
[WARROD] Yup. Bang!
One blast is all it takes.

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,750
Aww...

82
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,375
Ha! I was only screwin'
with you, kiddo.

83
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:40,000
It's got no bullets.
It shoots a net to catch fish.

84
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,500
Tell me more about it!

85
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,166
Are the nets really big,
or are they just little ones?

86
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,625
They're gigantic.

87
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,875
I caught an iceberg with one
of these back in the day.

88
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,708
That big? I wanna see!

89
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,958
[WARROD] Just kidding!
I'm jokin' with you again!

90
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,458
They're pretty big,

91
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,583
but not big enough to catch
an iceberg, that's for sure.

92
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,000
What's the rate of expulsion?

93
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,875
Do you have to aim it
at a specific angle?

94
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,208
Um, well, lemme think.

95
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,625
So you have to aim right
at the fish obviously--

96
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,250
Do you fire from a
standing position,

97
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,791
or kneel to brace it properly?

98
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,708
I always kneel, but I guess
you could stand, or--

99
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:12,916
[YURI] Hey, Warrod! Could you
come gimme a hand up here?

100
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,625
Be right there! Gladly.

101
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,875
Let's talk later.

102
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,833
Sure! Let me know when
you have some free time!

103
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,166
You've got to get a sense for
when you're bothering people.

104
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,833
Yeah, you're right.
I just get so excited!

105
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,750
Now what next? There's so
much on this ship to explore!

106
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:33,458
Yeah. Probably less
than you're thinking.

107
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:42,208
[MAVIS humming]

108
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,458
[gasps]

109
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,666
I can't believe the wind
died down so quickly.

110
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,958
I really hate this part.

111
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,416
[WARROD] There's no point
gripin' about things

112
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,708
you can't control.

113
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,375
Yeah, I know that.

114
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:53,583
This is one of those times

115
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,041
when it'd be best
to stay out of it.

116
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,125
That sounds like
excellent advice!

117
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,583
I don't find your
tone convincing.

118
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,208
That guy looks kind of
scary, don't you think?

119
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,166
What are you two
doing with the sail?

120
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,458
Well, the wind stopped,
so we're furling it.

121
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,750
There's no point having
it up with no breeze.

122
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,000
Supposedly the breezes
in this part of the ocean

123
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,791
come and go in two to
three-hour intervals

124
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,666
pretty consistently
this time of year.

125
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,416
It should pick up again in a
little while, if that's helpful.

126
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,958
You sure know a lot.

127
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,916
What, did ya get that
info from a book?

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,541
Yep! I read all about
ocean currents, too!

129
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,250
She's right. Let's rest
till the wind picks up.

130
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm tired of working anyway.

131
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,416
Fine by me.

132
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,916
Is there anything
you'd like me to do

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,375
to help out around the ship
while you guys are relaxing?

134
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,750
[YURI] Nope, I think
we've got it covered.

135
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,833
Well, just let me know.

136
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,750
Hey, stay away from all
that stuff. Please.

137
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:48,708
Yes, sir.

138
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,083
What did I say earlier?

139
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,541
[YURI] Why don't you go back
to staring at the ocean?

140
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,875
Think I could talk
to you for a minute?

141
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,166
I told you to
stare at the ocean!

142
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,291
Then that's what I'll do!

143
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,041
What are the odds that
she'll do what I say?

144
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,583
I finished cleaning and
organizing all the gear.

145
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:07,833
[YURI]
Oh, that's great.

146
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,000
[WARROD]
But it doesn't really matter

147
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,458
if we can't afford
to use any of it.

148
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,875
Buying the boat and making
the journey to Tenrou Island

149
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,750
has put a major dent
in the old coin purse.

150
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:17,875
[YURI]
I know.

151
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,333
We'll just have to
earn some more Jewel

152
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,166
when we get to Hargeon.

153
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,958
[DOLPHIN A crying]

154

[MAVIS gasps]

155
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,541
What do you think
that sound was?

156
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:46,250
[DOLPHIN A crying]

157

Oh! Those are dolphins!

They're beautiful!

160
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,166
Did you know they're
mammals like us?

161
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,958
They might look like fish,
but they're very different!

162
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,375
They're friendly
and intelligent,

163
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,125
maybe even more so than humans,

164
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,750
and they're extremely
playful and gentle!

165
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:12,875
All right!

[MAVIS]
I figured we'd have a chance

169
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:21,958
to do a little swimming
on this trip,

170
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,166
so I decided that
I'd wear my swimsuit!

171
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,041
Wait! Mavis!

Hi, my name is Mavis,

[MAVIS]
This is amazing.

178
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,708
I read that dolphins had
skin as opposed to scales,

179
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,666
but I never imagined
it would be this smooth

180
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,583
and silky to the touch!

You sure you're okay out there?

And you're not gonna
believe what I found!

Thank you, friend! Wait here
for me a moment, okay?

[ZERA]
What?

199
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,750
So what did you find?

'Kay, um, what is that?

205
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,583
It's magical diving gear!

206
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,500
With this, I can go
exploring underwater

207
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:34,875
for as long as I want.

208
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,666
It's perfect.

209
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,583
I heard Yuri and Warrod talking.

210
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:45,500
They said this expedition has
very nearly bankrupt them.

211

[ZERA] I don't really see how
that has anything to do

212
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,833
with this magical diving gear.

213
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,833
I found an underwater shrine
on the seafloor nearby.

214
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,458
[ZERA]
Are you kidding me?

215

[MAVIS] And shrines are
usually full of treasure,

216
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,000
so I'm going to
explore down there!

217
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,375
You're a lunatic.

218
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,666
People do that kind of thing
in fairy tales, Mavis.

219
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,833
This is real life.

220
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:02,958
If I can find any
treasure in the shrine,

221
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,375
I'll give it to them
and help relieve

222
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,291
some of their
financial difficulties.

223
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,291
[ZERA] Hey! Are you
even listening to me?

Hush!

00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,125
If they wake up,

226
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,041
just tell 'em I'm playing
with the dolphins

is a terrible--!

out how to get inside.

wanna come with me?

That's all right. Just wait
right here until I get back.

I'm gonna find down here.

[MAVIS]
This writing...

238
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:51,166

the ancient Kurill civilization.

This statue's a different color

247
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,166
than the stone around it.

Is that an altar
there in the center?

This must be a ritual chamber.

If there's any
treasure to be found,

319
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,750
The statues' heads
are facing backwards!

320
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,208
Hey! What're you doing?!

321
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,083
I think I've figured
out the solution!

322
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,666
"Turn all eyes to gaze
upon the single star"!

323
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,791
It has to mean the one
in the center! Right?

324
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,625
These statues' heads
are turned backwards,

325
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,333
away from the center!

326
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:02,291
The text says to "turn all eyes
to gaze upon the single star,"

327
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,625
and there's one in the middle!

328
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,166
That's what it means?

329
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,166
[MAVIS] Help me turn
them all to face inward!

330
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,958
It says "for only then may the
door to the heavens open"!

331
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:13,083
I don't understand,
but I trust you. I guess.

332
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,458
I'm working on a hunch here,
but their heads are turning,

333
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,875
so I think I must be
onto something!

334
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:24,166
Okay! That's all of them.
Let's hope my gut is right!

335
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,916
It doesn't seem like
anything is happening.

336
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,250
Wait. Give it a second.

337
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:34,875
[WARROD, YURI gasp]

338
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,041
[MAVIS gasps]

339
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,125
So did your gut
tell ya about this?

340
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,666
[MAVIS] Um, it looks like
the altar is sinking!

341
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,708
[WARROD]
That's just great.

342
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,833
I really don't like
the way this is going.

343
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,333
Yeah, I'm with you.

344
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,500
That's not what I imagine
when I hear "door to heaven."

345
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,750
I'm sorry.

346
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,333
I guess I led us into an
underwater booby trap!

347
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,666
[YURI, WARROD]
Are you serious?!

348
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,583
[ALL screaming]

349
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,458
[YURI] Do you realize
how crazy that was?

350
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,583
Well, lesson learned.

351
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,375
You could've gotten the
three of us killed down there.

352
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,458
That's true, but at
the end of the day,

353
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,125
we would've never made
it out of that shrine

354
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,166
without her expertise, so...

355
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,250
...I guess in a way
she saved our lives.

356
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,041
That's one way to look at it.

357
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,875
Though a big treasure
would've been nice.

358
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,291
A crown, or at
least a fat Jewel.

359
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:53,958
[YURI]
I did snag these.

360
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:56,875
[chuckles]

361
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,375
Oh, yeah.

362
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,541
Look what I found!

363
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:03,583
Holy crap!

364
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,458
You kiddin' me?

365
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:06,875
[MAVIS]
Here ya go.

366
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,625
I thought that it could
go towards funding

367
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,500
the rest of the journey.

368
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,833
Hey. The wind's back!

369
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:30,541
You feel that? Anchors up!

370
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:15,291
[MAVIS] After a long
and eventful journey,

371
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:18,625
my new friends and I finally
arrive in Hargeon.

372
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:22,083
There, I get to experience
a few thrilling firsts.

373
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:26,750
My first port city, and my first
market, with its bustling crowd.

374
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:29,958
From there, I accompany the
quiet and mysterious Precht

375
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:32,833
on a quest for information about
the Blue Skull Wizard Guild,

376
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:36,125
and the possible location
of the Tenrou Orb!

377
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,666
Next Time:
"Dancing with Blades."

378
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,500
Skilled swordplay
takes center stage!
