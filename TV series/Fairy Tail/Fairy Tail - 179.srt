1
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:45,666
[GRAY] That pompous wizard...

2
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:49,541
[GRAY] I've waited for this...

3
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,500
It's time to get payback.

4
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,458
[GRAY] The First
Master told me that

5
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,416
you'd be hiding out in here.

6
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,208
Seems she was right.

7
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,333
[RUFUS] How interesting.

8
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,833
You had practically
vanished from my memory.

9
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:35,416
Perhaps you'd care to
remind me who you are?

10
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,500
You're gonna have a hard
time forgetting me after this.

11
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,958
'Cause I'm the guy who's
gonna knock you out!

12
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,208
[CHAPATI] Here we go!

13
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,875
Gray and Rufus have
met up in the library,

14
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:48,625
and I have a feeling they
are not gonna keep quiet!

15
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,250
Two different types
of maker magic

16
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,583
going against each other...

17
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,125
Gray better watch out!

18
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,458
That guy really worked him over
the last time they fought...

19
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,000
He's tougher than he looks.

20
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,833
You knew they were gonna
fight each other, didn't you?

21
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,208
I did.

22
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,625
Then that means he's
gonna pummel that cocky jerk.

23
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,125
I suppose you gave him
a foolproof strategy, right?

24
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,416
No, not exactly...

25
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,833
I'm not even sure he'll win.

26
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,375
You seriously don't know?

27
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,833
Do you even know what kinda
odds he has of winning?

28
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,416
I honestly
have no clue...

29
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,708
But he absolutely must win.

30
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:21,958
Rufus is the key to conquering
Sabertooth once and for all.

31
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,333
[HAPPY] Gray vs. Rufus!

32
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,583
[JUVIA] Hold on a
minute, First Master.

33
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,500
Are you saying
that Rufus...

34
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:40,958
actually has the ability to
know where we are at all times?

35
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,458
[MAVIS] That's correct...

36
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,708
So it stands to reason that
he should be defeated first.

37
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,208
I would love to take
that guy down myself.

38
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,708
You're so bold...

39
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:52,208
[GRAY] Will you please
let me handle him?

40
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,875
I'm sorry, but according to
my calculations, you're at a

41
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,375
significant disadvantage
in a fight against him.

42
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,625
It's unlikely that you'll win.

43
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,333
[GRAY] I don't give
a crap about that!

44
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,750
[GRAY] I wanna save Lucy...

45
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,166
and I owe him a good thrashing.

46
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,500
You know I'm a proud
Fairy Tail wizard!

47
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,083
So let me fight him!

48
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,125
[MAVIS] Emotions
can sometimes surpass

49
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,458
what has been calculated...

50
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:29,333
Show us the power
of what you feel!

51
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,833
[RUFUS] Hmph.

52
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,250
Alright, you mask-wearin'
freak, let's rock!

53
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,208
[RUFUS] Hmph.

54
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,291
Ice Make: Freeze Lancer!

55
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,625
Memorized.

56
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,166
[GRAY] You're not getting
away from this one!

57
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,666
Ice Impact!

58
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,166
[RUFUS] Memorized.

59
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,333
[GRAY] What the hell do
you keep mumbling about?!

60
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,458
[RUFUS] Memory is
a powerful weapon.

61
00:04:58,541 --> 00:04:59,541
Huh?

62
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,958
I can commit any
spell I see to memory.

63
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,833
And then make
entirely new spells

64
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,708
that are based on
those techniques.

65
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,083
[GRAY] Is that so?

66
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,791
For example: I have
memories of your ice...

67
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:13,500
Along with several memories
of Olga's lightning.

68
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:14,625
[GRAY] Oh yeah?

69
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,375
[RUFUS] I can combine them...

70
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,958
Memory Make...

71
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,541
Sword of Frozen Black Lightning!

72
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,541
[GRAY grunts]

73
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:30,833
Oh crap!

74
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,333
His power is crazy!

75
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,500
He can perform any spell

76
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,708
that he just comes
up with on the fly?!

77
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,083
It's hard to believe,
but it seems like it's true!

78
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,250
That's one of the
manliest powers ever!

79
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,500
Shrine of the
Stormy Wind Fang!

80
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:46,833
Is that all you got?!

81
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,541
Ice Make: Shield!

82
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:50,875
I see...

83
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:51,916
Memorized...

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,375
But soon...

85
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,750
[RUFUS] Forgotten!

86
00:05:56,833 --> 00:06:00,125
[GRAY screams]

87
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,041
It just disappeared!

88
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,083
[GRAY grunts]

89
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,000
[JULIA gasps]

90
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,250
[JUVIA] Oh no!

91
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,333
[CHAPATI] What a move!

92
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,666
Rufus unleashes
an intense assault

93
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,541
that puts Gray on the floor!

94
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:13,875
I get it...

95
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,250
He can make people forget
what they know as well.

96
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,041
And combining that
kind of power with his

97
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,125
endless spell creation magic
makes him way more dangerous.

98
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,583
So that means Gray can
only use an attack one time

99
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:24,958
before the guy takes it away!

100
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,458
We're in trouble,
you guys...

101
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,416
Gray's at a major disadvantage.

102
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:30,875
[RUFUS chuckles]

103
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,458
[RUFUS] What's the matter?

104
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,083
As I recall, you were planning
to knock me out, weren't you?

105
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,875
Hmm...?
What is this?

106
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,291
[RUFUS] Ohhh...

107
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:43,041
This is the Book of Heavens
magic compendium!

108
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,625
And these look to be
"The Tome of the Abyss"

109
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,625
and "Advanced Dark Sorcery."

110
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,166
Yes.

111
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,458
"The Secrets to
Subliminal Percipience"

112
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:55,958
"Ancient Witchcraft."

113
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,083
[RUFUS laughs]

114
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,291
These are most
excellent discoveries.

115
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,208
[GRAY] We're not here
to catch up on reading,

116
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,041
we're here to fight!

117
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,666
All memorized.

118
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,125
He really just memorized
all of those books?

119
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:13,416
I can't even imagine how
many spells that must be!

120
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,000
[CHAPATI] He's unsteady,
but Gray is back on his feet!

121
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,583
[RUFUS] What a wonderful
turn of events...

122
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,583
I'm glad you haven't wilted
like a flower in the cold.

123
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:22,875
It's thrilling...

124
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,583
all these songs of
magic passed down for eons,

125
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,458
forming a symphony
inside my mind.

126
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,583
[RUFUS] But its melody will
be of my own composing...

127
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,375
The disparate
memories juxtaposed

128
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,375
in ways never
before dreamed of...

129
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,333
Taking fragments from here and
there to create something new!

130
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,000
The spells I can now create...

131
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,583
are new versions
of ancient magic.

132
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,166
That cannot be!

133
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,958
His magic would seem
to be limitless...

134
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,208
But still...

135
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,208
I can create a Column
of Ancient Ice Knights!

136
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:00,833
[RUFUS] Ancient magic possesses
such a unique splendor...

137
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,250
With proper training,
one can forge soulless

138
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,708
soldiers born of nothing
but the drifting elements...

139
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,708
However, this is a new twist.

140
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,875
You could call it a
"collaborative work"...

141
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,750
For it would not be
possible without the

142
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,625
memory of your ice magic.

143
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,583
He's gotta take this
guy down real quick.

144
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,166
At least do
something Gray...!

145
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,500
[ELFMAN roars]

146
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,583
At least do something,
Gray! Come on and man up!

147
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,500
Now, dance to the rhythm
of your destruction.

148
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:25,000
[GRAY] You may be ripping
off whoever you can,

149
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,000
but this is all me!

150
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,625
[GRAY yells]

151
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:34,875
That's brutal...

152
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,083
Man, this guy's power
is totally ridiculous!

153
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,458
He's just making everything
up as he goes along!

154
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,958
[GRAY] If this is the
best you can do...

155
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,416
you're pathetic!

156
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,000
Duly noted...

157
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,250
It would seem that I
could utilize far more

158
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,833
aggressive elements
in my creations.

159
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,375
Memorized...

160
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,500
Shining Lightning Blade!

161
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,291
[crowd gasping, murmuring]

162
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,625
[CHAPATI] Whoa, momma!

163
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,958
Gray's been hit with a
wallop of magic power!

164
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,625
Does this mean he's
down for the count?!

165
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,041
[JUVIA] Ah... My poor darling...

166
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:10,958
If only I could rush to
your side and help you!

167
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,708
But I can't...

168
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,125
I must have total
faith in you...

169
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:18,416
and in the wisdom of
Master Mavis's plan.

170
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,208
[GRAY grunting]

171
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,333
[RUFUS] Hmmm...

172
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,541
A rather fascinating
interpretation...

173
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:25,916
Memorized.

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,291
[GRAY] Didn't
anybody ever tell you

175
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,750
how you're supposed to
behave in a library?

176
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:33,083
]You need to put those books
back where you found them!

177
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,583
[GRAY] So quit looking
at 'em and let's do this!

178
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:40,666
[RUFUS] No matter...

179
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,500
If that is your wish,
then so be it.

180
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,625
I've already memorized
their contents.

181
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,041
\Vibrant Slashing Blaze!

182
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:50,208
[GRAY growling]

183
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,000
[GRAY yells]

184
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,375
[JUVIA gasps]

185
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,208
If only there was something
I could do to help...

186
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:05,083
[RUFUS] Your song in this
battle is a haunting requiem.

187
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,166
For it seems that
you've forgotten

188
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,958
that you will never
be able to defeat me.

189
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,375
[CHAPATI] This is
turning out to be

190
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,541
a completely
one-sided battle!

191
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,416
If Gray has a strategy,
I am not seeing it!

192
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,291
He has infinite
combinations...

193
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,166
Plus he can memorize
and erase an attack

194
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,125
after just seeing it one time.

195
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,250
I hate to say it, but I
don't think we're gonna

196
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,250
be winning this round.

197
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,041
It's not lookin' so good.

198
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:33,000
I made certain to
warn him about this.

199
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,583
Maker magic is
very powerful indeed,

200
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,750
but it is also
very easy to memorize,

201
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,250
so he knows what
he's up against.

202
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,291
If that's the case,
what kind of strategy

203
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,791
did you suggest he follow?

204
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,708
He's not following
any strategy.

205
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,208
[MAKAROV gasps]

206
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,000
[MAVIS] He's letting his
emotions be his sole guide.

207
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,458
His strength flows from the

208
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,708
intensity of his
feelings, Eighth Master.

209
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,166
Ya know, I'm the
Fourth Master.

210
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,583
[ELFMAN &amp; LEVY]
You're actually the sixth!

211
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:57,750
What about Natsu?

212
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,666
I hope he and the
others are doin' okay.

213
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:05,291
[LUCY] I feel like we've
been going this way forever.

214
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,083
[PANTHERLILY] Didn't
we pass this spot earlier?

215
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,583
[NATSU sniffing]

216
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,166
Can you
smell anything?

217
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,583
Not really...

218
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,416
I guess because nobody's
been down here in a long time.

219
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,666
It doesn't
seem like it...

220
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,166
[YUKINO] That's right.

221
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,291
Dragon Slayers have a strong
sense of smell, don't they?

222
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,958
[WENDY] Yeah,
but people's smells

223
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,875
don't actually last very long.

224
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,625
[LUCY] Hey, where'd Happy go?

225
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,458
[LUCY screams]

226
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,500
Why in the heck would
you scare me like that?!

227
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,708
Oh man, these things are
practically everywhere

228
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:34,875
down here.

229
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,416
You really shouldn't
be picking those up!

230
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
Yeah, why not?

231
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,958
Well, I suppose there
is a good reason

232
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,916
why it's called the
"City of Death."

233
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,708
[CARLA] Princess Hisui
did mention that this is

234
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:47,041
the final taste of freedom
that criminals get.

235
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,166
[PANTHERLILY] It doesn't
look like freedom to me.

236
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,916
More like despair.

237
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
[NATSU] She bragged about
there being no way out,

238
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,291
but I don't buy it!

239
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,333
We're gonna prove
that she's a liar

240
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,166
'cause we're gettin'
outta this dump!

241
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,791
Yeah... and if she thinks we're
just gonna give up and die,

242
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,541
she's got another think coming!

243
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,958
All we have to do is keep
on looking and we're bound

244
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,166
to find our way outta
this place eventually!

245
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,916
All of you are so incredibly
strong and optimistic.

246
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,041
[MIRAJANE] Yeah, well,
we've been able to survive

247
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,333
worse things than this.

248
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:15,750
Mirajane's right!

249
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:19,291
When we work as a team,
there is nothing we can't do!

250
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,125
Excuse me... but what happened?

251
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,291
[NATSU] I busted up everything
in sight, but all I could find

252
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,625
was more rocks and stuff...

253
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,416
[LUCY] Maybe there are
some things we can't do...

254
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,208
[WENDY] We even split up
and it didn't help at all...

255
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,375
This place is definitely
"perdition," all right.

256
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,291
And I could bet that
wretched Princess is watching

257
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,166
us from her chambers
right now for her own

258
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,833
twisted sense of amusement!

259
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,791
She's watching us?

260
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,166
I'd hate to think anyone
would get off on this.

261
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,333
Hold on just a second...

262
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,291
Ka-ching!

263
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,541
So, what's your deal?

264
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,708
[HAPPY chuckles]

265
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:55,166
I just had a stroke
of pure genius as usual!

266
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,000
[HAPPY chuckles]

267
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,833
[HAPPY] I just had a stroke
of pure genius as usual!

268
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,458
[LUCY] So tell us what it is.

269
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,333
[CARLA] I'm sure it's
completely ridiculous.

270
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,583
[PANTHERLILY] Me too.

271
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,166
Well, do you guys
remember how we were just

272
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,500
talking about us being watched
for someone's entertainment?

273
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:17,875
[LUCY &amp; NATSU] Uh-huh.

274
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,791
I'd bet that there's
probably a whole bunch of

275
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,208
royal soldiers watching
us from somewhere, too.

276
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,333
Ya think they're
keeping an eye on us?

277
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,791
That is way too creepy.

278
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,250
Yeah, but it does
seem pretty likely.

279
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,041
[HAPPY] Doesn't it, though?!

280
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,000
So all we've gotta do
is get their attention

281
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,625
and give them a reason
to come down here.

282
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:35,791
Then, we bash 'em!

283
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,458
I knew you were gonna
say that, but what

284
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:38,708
we should actually
do is go out

285
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,291
the exact same way
that they came in!

286
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,333
Check this out!

287
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:43,458
[LUCY] I hear
what you're saying,

288
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,583
but this drawing
is crazy looking.

289
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,125
[WENDY] Not to mention scary...

290
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,208
How do you suggest
we lure them in?

291
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,416
Since we have no idea
who would be watching us

292
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,125
or even where they
are, how are we going

293
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,166
to get their attention?

294
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,833
Oh! I know your plan!

295
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,750
[HAPPY] At least
you understand me!

296
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,583
[HAPPY &amp; NATSU]
We show 'em some skin!

297
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:00,666
[LUCY] No way!

298
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,375
[HAPPY] It makes
perfect sense!

299
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,625
All of those soldiers from
earlier were men, right?

300
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,916
[HAPPY &amp; NATSU] Ya see?!

301
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,750
Oh, my goodness!

302
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:14,833
[YUKINO giggles sheepishly]

303
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,750
[LUCY] That was
totally work-related!

304
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,041
And why are you
backing away like that?!

305
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,083
[NATSU] These magazines
must be super old.

306
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,916
[HAPPY] Yeah, it's a Sorcerer
Weekly from seven years ago.

307
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,375
[YUKINO] Seven years?

308
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:28,250
[WENDY] It makes more sense
than you'd think it would.

309
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,208
Wow, this really
takes me back!

310
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,541
Did you just have that
on you for some reason?!

311
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,958
Nah, there's a whole bunch
of them just lying around.

312
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,166
[LUCY] Huh?!

313
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,625
[PANTHERLILY] I found a note.

314
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,291
"I've been trapped down here
for years, and my only joy

315
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,041
in this dark and dismal place

316
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,208
is the gorgeous pictures
in these magazines.

317
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,250
Mirajane is so
freaking pretty...

318
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,000
and when she looks back at me
with her big, beautiful eyes,

319
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,041
I can feel it...

320
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,291
The special bond between us." 

321
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:56,000
[CARLA] That literally
makes my skin crawl.

322
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,666
Anybody else notice how
Lucy's name never came up?

323
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,583
[LUCY] Geez, Natsu,
you really didn't have to

324
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,583
point that out, ya know?!

325
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,333
All right, it's time we
put my plan into action!

326
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:08,250
And it will hereby be known as
"Operation Glamor Escape:

327
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,583
C'mon Male Instinct!"

328
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:12,750
I'm all fired up now!
Let's do this thing, Lucy!

329
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,166
[LUCY] Why do I have to do it?!

330
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,250
Aw, don't worry,
I can help you out!

331
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,083
You really think this
is gonna work?!

332
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,000
--Where did you get a swimsuit?!
--You're all so cheerful.

333
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,041
Is Fairy Tail always like this?

334
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,208
[WENDY] No, not
all of the time...

335
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,875
[LUCY] I'm not putting on some
random, creepy swimsuit!

336
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:32,791
Fine... If I'm gonna do this,
then I'm goin' all-out!

337
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,041
That's the spirit!

338
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,791
They're probably
listening to us too,

339
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,583
so I think we should spice
it up with a little commentary.

340
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:42,541
[PANTHERLILY] Entry number one:
Lucy Heartfilia!

341
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,500
I'm a bad kitty... And I'm
so sad and lonely with

342
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,625
no cute boys down
here to play with me.

343
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:48,791
I don't get it!

344
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,416
Makes me wish
I was young again.

345
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,250
A very interesting
approach!

346
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,041
[LUCY] What in the
world are we doing?

347
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:57,833
[PANTHERLILY] Entry number two:
Mirajane Strauss!

348
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,791
[MIRAJANE] Do you
wanna see more...?

349
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,625
You might catch a nice
peek right before you die!

350
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,625
[LUCY] We're supposed to be
enticing them, not scaring them!

351
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,250
I really do hate
to be the one

352
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,041
to ruin the moment
here, you guys, but...

353
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,583
...if it turns out that no
one is actually watching us,

354
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,041
won't this be
completely pointless?

355
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,208
It's a whole lot better
than doing nothing!

356
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,708
I suppose...

357
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,000
Mark my words, we are gonna
get outta this crappy cave!

358
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:25,083
You shoulda never messed with
a wizard from Fairy Tail!

359
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,416
Let's do another round!

360
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,958
So you're still making
us go through with this?!

361
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,250
[YUKINO giggles softly]

362
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,416
--[LUCY] It's embarrassing!
--[WENDY] Yeah...

363
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,625
I guess this is a
little bit funny, huh?

364
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,583
[YUKINO] Oh... I'm
sorry about that.

365
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,416
[CHAPATI] Holy cow!

366
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,416
And the hits just
keep on coming!

367
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,291
Gray is seemingly unable
to do anything except be

368
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,333
Rufus's personal punching bag!

369
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:48,916
[CROWD cheering]

370
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,041
[RUFUS laughs]

371
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,416
[RUFUS] You'll have
to forgive me for

372
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,666
somewhat misreading
you earlier...

373
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,125
I never imagined that
you were this stubborn.

374
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,916
I do appreciate
what you've done...

375
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,791
You've been an
excellent test subject.

376
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,291
Without you, I may not
have had the opportunity

377
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,166
to learn so many spells!

378
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,625
Downpour of Ancient Wisdom!

379
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,750
[GRAY yells]

380
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,833
[RUFUS] The ancients
possessed such beautiful

381
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,750
and frightening
forms of expression.

382
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,333
There's nothing in the
world that magic can't do.

383
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,333
It can control the elements...

384
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:20,041
One can even harness
the force of gravity...

385
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:23,291
And I will use that force to
crush you beneath my light.

386
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,125
I hope you've made your peace.

387
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,458
[CHAPATI] That's gotta hurt!

388
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:28,625
Gray has literally got the

389
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,500
weight of the world
on his shoulders!

390
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,833
It seems that the power
of memory trumps ice

391
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,250
in this Maker magic battle!

392
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:35,958
[JUVIA] My love...

393
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,125
My dear, sweet Gray...

394
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,750
I believe in you!

395
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,958
You're so passionate,
surely the force of

396
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,000
your emotions can
conquer anything.

397
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:46,250
So, I won't worry,
and I will not look back!

398
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:53,083
[GRAY] All right...
I'm through playing around!

399
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:56,375
You shouldn't be
able to move right now!

400
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,708
Don't tell me what to do!

401
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:03,541
[GRAY] Maker magic
is all about freedom.

402
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:07,458
My master Ur taught me
that a long time ago.

403
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,666
[GRAY] What's more...

404
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,625
I have my own memory!

405
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,875
I remember all
the battles I won

406
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,916
using what I learned from her.

407
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,291
Everything I gained from them...
and everything I felt from them.

408
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,000
What are you
waiting for?

409
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,500
You need a formal
invitation or something?!

410
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:33,375
Quit screwing around and
go fight the guy already!

411
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,375
There's no
reason to wait.

412
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,708
Let's do this!

413
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,166
[RUFUA] Ah!

414
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,208
[CHAPATI] Finally!

415
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,041
Gray Fullbuster
springs into action

416
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,458
with a long awaited
counterattack!

417
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:53,291
[RUFUS] You're quite the
glutton for pain, aren't you?

418
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:56,583
[GRAY] Nope, I've definitely
had my fill of that.

419
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,833
I gotta admit,
Memory Magic

420
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,166
is some pretty amazing stuff.

421
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,208
But it turns out my memory
has a huge amount of power,

422
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,583
all its own.

423
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,083
[RUFUS] That's an
amusing thought,

424
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:09,083
so tell me, what is it exactly
that you've memorized?

425
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:12,166
[GRAY] Things that someone like
you could never understand...

426
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,166
All the pain I've ever felt...
the frustration of defeat...

427
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,166
the pure joy of
winning... everything!

428
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,041
Trust me, all that
stuff has been beaten

429
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,125
into my head my entire life.

430
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:26,541
It's a feeling that I
share with my friends.

431
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:30,083
I remember every single
battle that I've had to fight!

432
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,291
And that's what
gives me my power!

433
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,291
I'm gonna wipe that smirk
off your face for good!

434
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,500
With the power
of MY memory!

435
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:41,750
Gray is so intense that even
his clothes can't contain him!

436
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,541
[JUVIA] I can't bring myself
to look or I'll explode!

437
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,333
He's taken
off his clothes?

438
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,958
It would appear
that he has indeed.

439
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,666
Attaboy, show everybody
that you mean business!

440
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,500
Now it's time to cash in
on some super sweet payback!

441
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:54,708
You got this!

442
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,958
[RUFUS] I should've
guessed you'd say that.

443
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:00,750
So painfully predictable.
And so pedestrian.

444
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,583
We all know that the
weakest dog barks the most,

445
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,291
and you're no exception.

446
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,666
[GRAY] The last thing I
need is your approval...

447
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,541
'cause I don't give a
crap what you think.

448
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,791
[RUFUS] To memorize
is to learn every detail.

449
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,666
Emotions only distort and
obscure true knowledge.

450
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,583
Since your memories seem to
consist only of "feelings",

451
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,208
I'd bet you haven't
learned a thing.

452
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,375
[GRAY] The flaws in your
memory are gonna be what

453
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,916
brings you down in the end.

454
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,500
[RUFUS] What?

455
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,250
[GRAY] You already forgot what
this emblem on my chest means.

456
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,333
That I will never lose to the
same guy more than once!

457
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,666
Oh...?

458
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,208
Do you have some feeble
minded strategy after all?

459
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:38,583
[GRAY] Ice Make...

460
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,958
I've memorized it.

461
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,000
Unlimited Magic!

462
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,208
[RUFUS] Oh!

463
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,541
But that's impossible!

464
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:56,458
[RUFUS] How can he
create so much at once?!

465
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,958
[GRAY] Did you get all that?

466
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,041
That was awesome!

467
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,583
He's throwing everything
he's got at him

468
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:03,958
all at the same time!

469
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,875
My memory...!
It can't keep up with him!

470
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,333
[GRAY yells]

471
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:12,125
[GRAY] Wild Salvo Dance!

472
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,083

473
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,083
How tragic.

474
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,541
It's a shame you can
only cast spells using ice!

475
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,125
For I've
memorized powerful

476
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:31,291
flame spells that
will destroy it all!

477
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:34,916
Memory Make:
Karma of the Scorching Earth!

478
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,291
[RUFUS chuckles]

479
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,750
Ah...!

480
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,416
[GRAY] That's nothing, pal!

481
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,250
I've felt much hotter
flames than yours!

482
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,375
Now feel my Ice Bringer!

483
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,666
[RUFUS screams]

484
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,166
[cheering]

485
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,250
[MAKAROV] He actually did it.

486
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,833
[MAVIS sighs]

487
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,916
[MAVIS] There's no denying it...

488
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,333
Today, you've shown us all...

489
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:11,291
just how powerful
emotions can be.

490
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,458
[CHAPATI] And Gray takes
a trophy from Rufus!

491
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,625
With an unbelievable,
come-from-behind victory,

492
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,708
Fairy Tail wins the match!

493
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:21,500
[CROWD cheering]

494
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:24,166
He's such a
fiery, icy hunk!

495
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,666
Ugh... What a
total waste of time!

496
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,125
It was fun, but
ultimately pointless.

497
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:34,500
[NATSU] Yeah, nobody's
gonna come down here.

498
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,416
[CARLA] Well, you have
to consider the source.

499
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,083
Back to square
one again.

500
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,625
[HAPPY groans]

501
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:42,375
[HAPPY] Man, I really believed
that was gonna work for us.

502
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,916
[WENDY] I guess this means
nobody's watching us.

503
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,500
[YUKINO] We have to try
and find another way out.

504
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,958
[NATSU] Yep, back
to looking, you guys!

505
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:51,541
[LUCY] Geez...

506
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:54,458
Trying to be sexy for that long
really takes it out of you.

507
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:30,375
[HAPPY] All right!
Way to go, Gray!

508
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:32,166
I always knew that
he was gonna win!

509
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,583
[NATSU] Come on little buddy,
we got a lotta work to do!

510
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:37,166
Let's blow this joint and give
him a high-five in person!

511
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,541
[HAPPY] Whoa! What the heck?

512
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:40,666
Where did these weirdos
come from all of a sudden?!

513
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,750
[NATSU] Ha, ha! You're not
joking, they're totally weird!

514
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:45,083
Whaddaya say we kick their butts

515
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:46,875
and make 'em tell
us the way out?!

516
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:49,500
[HAPPY &amp; NATSU] Next time:
The Hungry Wolf Knights!

517
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:51,458
[NATSU] I'm not really buying
these guys as knights.

518
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:53,333
Especially the one
in the headband.

519
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:57,541
[HAPPY] Oh my gosh!
I think he's after my fish!
