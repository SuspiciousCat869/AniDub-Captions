1
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,041
[LUCY]
I can't believe it.

2
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,666
They're all gone.

3
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:57,958
[NATSU] Sorry to
keep you waiting, Lucy.

4
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,000
Cocky lizards.

5
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,291
Listen up, ugly!

6
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,833
You just picked a fight
with the wrong guy!

7
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:07,625
I'm Natsu Dragneel
of the Fairy Tail guild.

8
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,625
I'm a Dragon Slayer!

9
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:13,041
And I'm here
to do just that.

10
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,166
Say that to my face!

11
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,708
Turn around, you coward!

12
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,250
[GRAY] All right, fine.

13
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,791
I said I'm sick and tired of
you screeching like a banshee!

14
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,625
It's seriously harshing
my mellow here.

15
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,250
You lookin'
to fight, Ice-lips?!

16
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,708
Anytime, anyplace, chump!

17
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,000
You can do it, Natsu!

18
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,125
Those two butt heads

19
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,791
more than a couple
of goats in heat...

20
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,541
It's embarrassing.

21
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,833
I understand that
they're polar opposites,

22
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,708
but I don't really get how two
friends could fight so much.

23
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,250
Wait...

24
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,666
Fire and Ice are going at it
and you find that surprising...?

25
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,208
Give me a break.

26
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,041
Oh, Gray...!

27
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,416
Even when you act like a savage,
you're the epitome of hot!

28
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,583
Hold on...

29
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,875
Shouldn't he be 'cool' as ice?

30
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,541
[LUCY] Cut it out, you two!

31
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,416
You destroyed the
place once already!

32
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,041
Isn't that enough for one week?

33
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,166
[NATSU, GRAY] Killjoy!

34
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,500
We have a day off,

35
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,458
so if they get hurt
they'll have time to heal...

36
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,208
I say let them have their fun.

37
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,541
Uh, Mira...

38
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,375
I think you might be
missing the point a little.

39
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:41,791
Hey Master...!

40
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,791
Are you just going
to ignore them?!

41
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,958
I suppose this does
call for a stern talking-to...

42
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,333
[MAKAROV]
Natsu!

43
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,625
Is that fighting
or a love squabble?!

44
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,208
Show the same spirit
you did in the arena today!

45
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,166
Seriously?!

46
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,708
Damn straight...!

47
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,333
And you call yourself a master
of Dragon-Slaying magic...?!

48
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,208
Be a man!

49
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,375
I agree!

50
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,666
You're not helping!

51
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,625
[NATSU] You heard
the old man, Gray!

52
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:05,958
Get ready to cry!

53
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,458
[GRAY] Oh yeah...?

54
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,000
Let's see if you can make
good on that little threat!

55
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,500
Down the hatch! 

56
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:12,875
--My bad.
--My bad.

57
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,583
[HAPPY] Bullies!
What did I do to deserve this?!

58
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:16,750
[NATSU] Sorry 'bout that!

59
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,000
[GRAY] Ya Shoulda dodged.

60
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,666
[HAPPY] You're so mean!

61
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,208
I'm a Fairy Tail wizard, too!

62
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,000
Show me some respect!

63
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,666
Um, I think she's gonna blow!

64
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:26,875
[WENDY] I'll fix you up, Happy.

65
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,125
Think you could
use some of that

66
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,166
to de-charcoal my fish?

67
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,416
That's not even a word.

68
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,541
[MIRAJANE]
Wendy's really something else...

69
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,500
She's kind, and gentle,
and a very skilled healer,

70
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,375
but it's crazy
because on the flip side,

71
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:42,166
she's been trained to fight
and even slay dragons!

72
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,541
No kiddin'...

73
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:44,791
But it kinda makes you wonder

74
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,500
where the dragon that
raised Natsu went wrong.

75
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:49,583
Hey!

76
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,458
That's enough!

77
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,083
[NATSU, GRAY]
Sorry, ma'am.

78
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,625
[groaning in pain]

79
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:57,833
Listen, you two.

80
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,166
We're here to prove
that Fairy Tail

81
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,041
is the best guild
in all of Fiore.

82
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,833
That's why we're competing
in the Grand Magic Games.

83
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,708
And the final matchup
is right around the corner.

84
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,750
It took all of our strength
to snag the first place spot.

85
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,708
Now all of the other guilds
will be gunning for us.

86
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,541
We should be focused
and level headed,

87
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:18,333
so what exactly was the point
of ruining my cake?!

88
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:19,083
[NATSU, GRAY, LUCY] Huh?

89
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,541
On your feet...

90
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:21,833
Die with dignity!

91
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,166
[screaming]

92
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,625
[ERZA]
Quit running like cowards!

93
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:28,833
[CARLA, HAPPY, PANTHERLILY]
Gajeel?!

94
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,833
If I ever see
another mine car,

95
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,666
it'll be too soon.

96
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,708
Where you been?!
You missed all the cake!

97
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,000
Yeah, jerk!

98
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,541
Why'd you take off
in the middle of our match?

99
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:38,791
Here we go...

100
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:39,750
For real...?!

101
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,000
I just spent half the day

102
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,583
crawling out of
a hole in the ground

103
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,208
'cause the lava-brained
tool in front of me

104
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,625
put me down there!

105
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,958
Ohh. S'that true, Gray?

106
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,500
I seriously worry about
your lack of brain cells.

107
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,958
That must've been
real rough for ya!

108
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,541
What's your deal?!

109
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,458
Ugh, just forget it.

110
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,875
Anyway...

111
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,500
You two come with me... Now.

112
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,416
Got something to show ya.

113
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,750
[HAPPY] King of the Dragons!

114
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:12,000
[CROWD chattering]

115
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,875
[MALE 176B]
Fairy Tail is kickin' tail!

116
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,333
[FEMALE 176A]
They just might win this thing!

117
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,750
[MALE 176C] In their dreams!

118
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,333
[FEMALE 176B] Was it me,
or did Sabertooth kinda suck?

119
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:19,791
[MALE 176D] Yeah, totally!

120
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,666
[MALE 176E] Sabertooth ain't
giving up without a fight.

121
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,625
Just you watch.

122
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,250
They'll own the final!

123
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,791
[JIEMMA] Well, Sting... Rogue...

124
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,166
What should I do with you two?

125
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,458
[JIEMMA] No answer, huh?

126
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:40,166
I thought you were
"true" Dragon Slayers.

127
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,208
You used to love reminding us--

128
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,416
Always telling us you're
the epitome of strength.

129
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,750
Isn't that right?

130
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,833
So imagine my surprise

131
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,583
when you shamelessly got
your asses handed to you

132
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,958
by another Dragon Slayer!

133
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,708
[JIEMMA] What do you have
to say for yourselves?!

134
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,416
You spelled it out clearly...

135
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,666
We were defeated.

136
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,333
Natsu was somehow
able to subdue us

137
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:09,041
without using the
full extent of his power.

138
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:14,208
[ROGUE] He possesses strength
far beyond what we imagined.

139
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,291
He may be unbeatable.

140
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:22,166
That sounds like the
whining of a weakling to me.

141
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,250
Is that what I'm hearing? Well?!

142
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,416
I don't recall asking

143
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,166
to hear your pitiful
excuses, Rogue,

144
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,458
and I never asked you
to embarrass me like this!

145
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:37,458
You've disgraced our name
as the mightiest guild!

146
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:40,875
[LECTOR] Sting!

147
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,125
[FROSCH] Rogue!

148
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,125
Worms like you aren't
fit to call themselves

149
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,000
members of Sabertooth!

150
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,250
Get out!

151
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,541
I don't want to see
your faces here again.

152
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,291
Our guild has
no room for losers.

153
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:57,500
That's how we remain strong.

154
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,333
Aw, come on, Master...

155
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,750
Sting and Rogue
tried their best;

156
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,166
isn't that what
matters the most?

157
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,291
I know Sting lost,
but that's okay...!

158
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,041
He still gave the fight
his all, and I'm proud of him!

159
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,250
Lector...

160
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,875
[LECTOR]
If you want my opinion,

161
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,250
you gotta lose sometimes,

162
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,375
or you'd never
grow as a person!

163
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,541
This defeat gave Sting a chance
to learn a lot about himself

164
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,208
and his opponent!

165
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,916
So why not just let it slide?

166
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,833
[JIEMMA] Who the hell are you?

167
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,041
[LECTOR]
What do you mean, Master?

168
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,708
I'm a bonafide member!

169
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,375
I've even got the
Saber crest to prove it...!

170
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:30,541
Don't ya see?

171
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,833
This is a total abomination!

172
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,750
Who defiled our
guild's sacred crest

173
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,291
by placing it on this
mangy little creature?

174
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,750
[growling]

175
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,000
Help me... Sting...

176
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:56,333
No...! Lector!

177
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,041
Lector is gone...

178
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,208
Master killed him!

179
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,208
[ROGUE] Frosch!

180
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,250
Why did he do that?!

181
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,208
[JIEMMA]
It got what it deserved.

182
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,666
If you're smart,

183
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,208
you'll remove your emblem
before you join the fleabag.

184
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:24,875
[hysterical crying]

185
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,333
Would you stop
your damn blubbering?

186
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,791
[STING] What have you done...?!

187
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,291
What the hell have you done?!

188
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,416
[JIEMMA] Silence!

189
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,833
It was just a lousy cat!

190
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,083
So be it.

191
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,666
[JELLAL] Stop right there!

192
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,666
Reveal your identity.

193
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,125
I have already revealed mine.

194
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,833
[JELLAL] A woman?

195
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,833
There's no way!

196
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,958
[ULTEAR] Are you serious?

197
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,833
I don't believe it.

198
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:24,750
If this is some joke,
then it's in very poor taste.

199
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,416
I'm afraid that
we gravely mistook

200
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,791
the gravity of the situation.

201
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,125
If there is a joke in this,

202
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,666
it's that our fate
was already sealed.

203
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,500
[JELLAL] The gate that
will change the world...

204
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:37,875
The Eclipse...

205
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,958
[JELLAL]
The Dragon King Festival...

206
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,125
[WENDY] So, um...?

207
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,833
What did you find down here?

208
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,583
[GAJEEL] Pipe down and keep up.

209
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,166
[NATSU] Why'd you only bring us?

210
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,541
I wonder if
he found something

211
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,083
that has to do
with Dragon Slayer magic.

212
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,083
Possibly.

213
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,291
So, then...

214
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,208
Why did the gawkers tag along?

215
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,083
Excuse us for being gawkers.

216
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,416
We can't help being curious!

217
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,583
[GAJEEL] This is it.

218
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:04,916
[WENDY] Look over there!

219
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,416
[GRAY] What are those things?

220
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,875
[LUCY] They look like...

221
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,583
...giant bones...

222
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,875
[NATSU]
Those aren't just any bones--

223
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,375
These are all dragon remains.

224
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,791
[HAPPY] All these
used to be dragons?!

225
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,291
[CARLA] There are so many!

226
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,583
[PANTHERLILY] If you ever
wanted proof that they existed,

227
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,000
here it is.

228
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,833
[GRAY] But what
are they doin' here?

229
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,000
[GAJEEL] Who knows?

230
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,083
[NATSU] Well I'd like to,
that's for sure.

231
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,875
Why would there be piles
and piles of them like this?

232
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,458
Something bad
must've happened here.

233
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,291
Who knows, maybe we'll
find Igneel somewhere.

234
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,583
Happy!

235
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:39,625
[HAPPY] My bad.

236
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,833
No... He ain't here.

237
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,916
[GAJEEL] Yeah, it's
only been fourteen years

238
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,458
since our dragons
up and vanished...

239
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,916
Lookin' at these bones,

240
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,708
I'd say they've been here
for a lot longer than that.

241
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,125
That might work.

242
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,833
[LUCY] What was that, Wendy?

243
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,333
[WENDY] The Milky Way spell...

244
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,458
It's one of the new
Dragon Slayer secret arts

245
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,333
that Grandeeney
had passed down to me.

246
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,416
[WENDY] "Hear the voices
of the dragon spirits

247
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,041
that lead to
the River of Heaven."

248
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,375
[WENDY]
When I was first learning it,

249
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,708
I assumed it was
some kind of attack.

250
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,500
But I just had a thought.

251
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:14,416
What if...

252
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,666
...it's something else entirely?

253
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,000
[WENDY] It's possible

254
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,916
that the spell could
allow us to hear the voices

255
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,791
of dragons who have passed on.

256
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,000
You think?

257
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:23,958
Seriously?

258
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,208
If we can somehow commune

259
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,958
with the spirits
of these dragons...

260
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:30,458
then one of them might be able
to tell us what happened here.

261
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,791
[WENDY]
And we might finally be able

262
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,333
to find out why
our dragons vanished.

263
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,125
[MALE GUARD 176A] Hey, you...!

264
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,083
This area is off-limits...!

265
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:42,875
Halt!

266
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,791
Looked like they were writing
something down in here...

267
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,125
Huh.

268
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,708
[MALE GUARD 176A]
"July seventh...

269
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,750
The Eclipse project"?

270
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,125
[MALE GUARD 176A]
"The Dragon King Festival?"...

271
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,625
What is this?!

272
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,291
[WENDY] Just as I thought.

273
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,875
I got these
characters wrong before

274
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,708
because I assumed that they
were used for an attack spell.

275
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,166
[LUCY] A magic circle?

276
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,625
Yeah, what are
you trying to do?

277
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,583
If you'd been paying
attention, you would know that.

278
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,625
She's casting the Milky Way!

279
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:19,958
There we go...

280
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,625
I need everyone to step
away from the circle.

281
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,333
[WENDY] O wandering spirits
of dragons long past--

282
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:30,166
Reveal yourself,
and share your wisdom with me.

283
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,958
Milky Way!

284
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,125
It's workin'!

285
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,000
[LUCY] Beautiful!

286
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,875
[HAPPY] Look at the stars!

287
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,041
[LUCY]
The bones!

288
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,791
Talk to us, Wendy!
What's happening?!

289
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,333
I'm trying to contact
a dragon spirit.

290
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,458
But the residual thought energy
lingering down here is weak...

291
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:59,250
It's incredibly old,
and it's fading.

292
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,958
[WENDY] I found one!

293
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,000
[PANTHERLILY] Are you sure
that's a dragon spirit?!

294
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,041
[HAPPY] Wendy?!

295
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,416
[CARLA]
Quiet! She's concentrating!

296
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,166
What the hell?!

297
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:30,000
[roaring]

298
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,750
[screaming]

299
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:35,208
[laughing sinisterly]

300
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,416
[DRAGON]
Even in death,

301
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,416
scaring the pants off
humans is hilarious!

302
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,708
[ZIRCONIS]
My name is Zirconis.

303
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:46,125
They called me the
Jade Dragon back in my day.

304
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,250
I'm impressed you were able

305
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,875
to conjure my spirit...

306
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:53,333
Seems like the handy-work
of the Sky Dragon Grandeeney.

307
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,500
[ZIRCONIS]
Which one of you was it?

308
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,875
Oh, how adorable!

309
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,750
[ZIRCONIS] So it was this tiny
Dragon Slayer who woke me, eh?

310
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:03,958
[NATSU] Back off, creep...!

311
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,833
Don't even think
of touchin' her!

312
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,166
[ZIRCONIS]
Then I'll eat her...!

313
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,125
And she's just the appetizer!

314
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,750
I won't let you!

315
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,541
[ZIRCONIS]
Geez, lighten up, dummy.

316
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,166
Did you honestly think
I could eat any of you?

317
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,041
That'd be pretty hard to pull
off when I can't even touch you.

318
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,041
[laughing]

319
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,416
What did you call me?

320
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,416
All these bones,
and we get the crazy person.

321
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,791
Dragon... It's not a person.

322
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,583
Got another word
I could call him.

323
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,833
[ZIRCONIS]
My name is Zirconis...

324
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,916
They called me the
Jade Dragon back in my day.

325
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,500
You already told us that!

326
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,500
[CARLA] Can you tell us
what happened here?

327
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,833
[HAPPY] We were wondering

328
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,458
why there are so many
dragon bones lyin' around.

329
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,791
[PANTHERLILY] Learning
their fate was the reason

330
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,000
we decided to summon you
in the first place.

331
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:46,708
[ZIRCONIS] I have no interest
in talking with you humans!

332
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,541
Okay, what about cats?

333
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:49,958
[ZIRCONIS] Let's see...

334
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,625
It must have been over
four hundred years ago...

335
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,375
[GRAY] Guess he's got
no problem talkin' to cats.

336
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:58,291
[ZIRCONIS] Dragonkind once
ruled over every corner

337
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,708
of the globe.

338
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,833
We soared through the skies,

339
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:05,541
raced over the land,
and swam the great oceans.

340
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,666
[ZIRCONIS] Everything in the
world belonged to dragonkind.

341
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,750
Including humans.

342
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,375
[ZIRCONIS]
Your race was plentiful.

343
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:15,416
And an excellent
source of protein.

344
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,791
[ZIRCONIS] But,

345
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,958
there was one dragon who
felt our reign was unjust...

346
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,666
What a fool.

347
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,916
[ZIRCONIS]
It zealously spread the idea

348
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,625
of a world in which
we coexisted with humans.

349
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,000
Well, as with any fanatic idea,

350
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,125
there were some who fully agreed

351
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,833
and some who
opposed it outright.

352
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,750
It wasn't long
before war broke out.

353
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:41,000
[ZIRCONIS] I, myself,
fought against the fanatics.

354
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:41,833
[LUCY] Huh?!

355
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:42,958
So does that mean...

356
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,208
...you're against humans?

357
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,125
[ZIRCONIS] True, I am
not fond of your kind...

358
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,166
Unless you've
been properly cooked.

359
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,416
Medium rare, of course.

360
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,375
[NATSU]
Didn't your parents tell ya

361
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,958
not to talk to your food?

362
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,500
[ZIRCONIS] Hey!
Show some respect to the dead!

363
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:56,875
Anyway...

364
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,000
you were starting to tell us
about your civil war?

365
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,041
[ZIRCONIS] Both sides were
fairly evenly-matched...

366
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,583
The fighting was so brutal

367
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:08,208
that entire continents
were left barren and scarred.

368
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,833
[ZIRCONIS] Until finally

369
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,041
the dragons
supporting coexistence

370
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:16,333
came up with a plan
that doomed us all.

371
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:22,000
[ZIRCONIS] They granted humans
what would come to be known as

372
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,125
Dragon Slaying magic.

373
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:29,541
And with this new power in hand,
mankind joined the war.

374
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,666
[HAPPY]
So the first Dragon Slayers

375
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,041
were some kind
of ancient warriors?

376
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:38,208
[ZIRCONIS] Mm-hmm. The Dragon
Slayers' immeasurable power

377
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,166
quickly turned
the tide of the war.

378
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,750
We were so overwhelmed

379
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:46,791
that victory seemed certain for
the dragons on the other side.

380
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,666
[ZIRCONIS] But no one
predicted the travesty

381
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,125
that would come to pass.

382
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:54,250
[ZIRCONIS] The Dragon Slayers
became so powerful

383
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,583
they eventually turned
on the very dragons

384
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,250
that had given
them their strength.

385
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,458
[ZIRCONIS] It was a massacre.

386
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:05,000
[ZIRCONIS] There was one man
whose power was so terrible

387
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:08,333
he bathed the countryside
in the blood of my kin.

388
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:12,583
[ZIRCONIS] The very mention
of his name still scares me.

389
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,625
[ZIRCONIS] This man
slayed countless dragons

390
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,791
and soaked in their blood.

391
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:23,416
He used his power so often that
his skin turned to scales,

392
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,125
his teeth sharpened into fangs,

393
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:29,125
and he stopped
being human altogether.

394
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,000
Are you saying...

395
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,875
...that he turned into a dragon?

396
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,375
[ZIRCONIS] That is the fate

397
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:40,958
that awaits all who
practice Dragon Slayer magic.

398
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,333
[ZIRCONIS]
All the bones you see here

399
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:46,541
belong to the
victims of that monster.

400
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,625
[ZIRCONIS]
Despite his human origins,

401
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:52,250
he became the
King of all dragonkind.

402
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,791
[ZIRCONIS] And the war
that he gave rise to

403
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:59,208
came to be known as the
"Dragon King Festival."

404
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,375
[ZIRCONIS] His name...

405
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,458
...was Acnologia.

406
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,000
Once a human being,

407
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:08,000
now a dragon, cloaked
in wings of darkness.

408
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,333
[LUCY] Acnologia...

409
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:16,750
[LUCY] That's the dragon
we fought on Tenrou Island.

410
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,291
Fairy Tail's strongest members

411
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,041
threw everything
they had at it...

412
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,000
But that monster
just kept coming...

413
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,916
We couldn't even faze it!

414
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,625
[GRAY] You're saying
it used to be human?!

415
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,208
[GAJEEL] Impossible!

416
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,083
[ZIRCONIS] Most of my race
now rots in the ground

417
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,666
thanks to Acnologia.

418
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,083
All of this happened
in the distant past.

419
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:40,666
[ZIRCONIS]
But you and I have already--

420
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,833
[NATSU] What happened?!

421
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,083
[GRAY] He's gone.

422
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,166
[GAJEEL] Hey!
We weren't done with you yet!

423
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,666
[HAPPY, CARLA] Wendy!

424
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,125
I'm sorry...

425
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,416
Any thought energy he had
left is completely gone now.

426
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,791
[WENDY] But wherever he is,

427
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,583
I'm sure he'll finally
get some long needed peace.

428
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,500
Looks like we got ourselves
into another situation.

429
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,500
Let's pretend we
didn't hear anything.

430
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,625
[NATSU] There's only
one thing I wanna know...

431
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,041
Does this mean that we're gonna
turn into dragons, too?!

432
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,458
How should I know?!

433
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,458
But I don't wanna!

434
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,416
[ARCADIOS]
That's not very likely.

435
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,791
[WENDY] Who's there?!

436
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,833
[ARCADIOS] I took the
liberty of eavesdropping...

437
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,875
It would appear our research
is in line with historical fact,

438
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,708
after all.

439
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,083
[ARCADIOS] Tell me...

440
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,583
Have you heard of the
demons of the Book of Zeref?

441
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,583
[GRAY] Deliora...

442
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,291
[ARCADIOS]
Acnologia is similar to them...

443
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:36,166
For it was Zeref himself
who turned the Dragon Slayer

444
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,625
into that creature of death.

445
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:39,583
[HAPPY] Really?

446
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:40,833
[ARCADIOS] That means...

447
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,416
If you wish to conquer
the black dragon...

448
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,583
You must first find a way

449
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,083
to subdue the
black wizard, Zeref.

450
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,458
Who are you?!

451
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,375
How do we beat Zeref?

452
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,333
Yukino...?!

453
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,500
Is that you?!

454
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:59,291
[CARLA] In my visions,
I saw a white knight...

455
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,791
The castle crumbling...

456
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,958
And... Lucy singing.

457
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,916
[roaring]

458
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,833
[NATSU]
Sorry to keep you waiting, Lucy.

459
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,333
Cocky lizards...

460
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,625
Listen up, ugly...!

461
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,791
You just picked a fight
with the wrong guy!

462
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:39,041
I'm Natsu Dragneel
of the Fairy Tail guild.

463
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,458
I'm a Dragon Slayer!

464
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:44,000
And I'm here to do just that.

465
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:52,125
[NATSU]
Fire Dragon Brilliant Flame...!

466
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,666
Roar!

467
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,041
[NATSU] Fire Dragon...

468
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,458
...Crushing Fang!

469
00:21:58,541 --> 00:21:59,541
[LUCY] Natsu...!

470
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,166
It's no use...!

471
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,333
Please stop!

472
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,416
[NATSU] I ain't givin'
up that easily!

473
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,666
[shouting]

474
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,083
[LUCY] Natsu!

475
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,208
[NATSU] I ain't quittin'...

476
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:22,750
I refuse!

477
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,416
[NATSU] I won't run.

478
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,333
And I won't turn back.

479
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:33,666
Do you hear me?!

480
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,458
You're dead meat!

481
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:38,000
Natsu!!!

482
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:16,458
[NATSU] Man, that ghost
dragon was intense, huh, Happy?

483
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,041
[HAPPY] Yeah, we got lucky...

484
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:21,125
If it was a real dragon it would
have gobbled us up in one bite!

485
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:22,250
[NATSU] So who are these chumps

486
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,125
and why are they
actin' like big shots?

487
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:25,375
[HAPPY] Natsu...

488
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:26,875
I don't think they're
acting like big shots...

489
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,750
I'm pretty sure
they are big shots.

490
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,333
[NATSU] I don't care
if they're freakin' royalty,

491
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:32,916
if they mess with my pals,
they're gonna roast!

492
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,375
[HAPPY, NATSU] Next time:
The Eclipse Project!

493
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:37,291
[NATSU] Just try
messin' with Fairy Tail!

494
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,041
You'll be eating
lava for breakfast.

495
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:41,458
[HAPPY] All right Natsu,
we get it!
