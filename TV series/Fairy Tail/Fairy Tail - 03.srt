1
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:20,708
- Narrator: IN A LAND
FAR, FAR AWAY

2
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:23,041
LIES THE KINGDOM
OF FIORE,

3
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:26,208
A SMALL, PEACEFUL NATION
OF 17 MILLION,

4
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,791
AND A PLACE FILLED
WITH MAGIC.

5
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,291
FOUND IN EVERY HOME,

6
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,041
BOUGHT AND SOLD
IN EVERY MARKETPLACE.

7
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,375
FOR MOST MAGIC IS
MERELY A TOOL,

8
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,958
A MUNDANE PART
OF EVERYDAY LIFE.

9
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,333
FOR SOME, HOWEVER,
MAGIC IS AN ART,

10
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:42,416
AND THEY'VE DEVOTED
THEIR LIVES TO ITS PRACTICE.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,666
THESE ARE THE WIZARDS.

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,833
BANDED TOGETHER INTO
MAGICAL GUILDS,

13
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:50,416
THEY PLY THEIR SKILLS
IN SEARCH OF FAME AND FORTUNE.

14
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,375
MANY SUCH GUILDS DOT
THE LANDSCAPE OF FIORE.

15
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:57,416
BUT THERE IS A CERTAIN GUILD
IN A CERTAIN TOWN

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,750
THAT SOARS HIGH
ABOVE THE REST.

17
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,583
ONE FROM WHICH COUNTLESS LEGENDS
HAVE BEEN BORN.

18
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:05,750
A GUILD THAT WILL NO DOUBT
CONTINUE TO CREATE LEGENDS

19
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,416
WELL INTO THE FUTURE.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,375
ITS NAME IS FAIRY TAIL.

21
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,958
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

22
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,583
- Natsu:
PREVIOUSLY ON FAIRY TAIL...

23
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:45,833
- Mirajane: THE REQUEST BOARD

24
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,041
IS WHERE ALL
THE JOBS ARE POSTED.

25
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,291
PICK ANY ONE YOU WANT.

26
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,250
- Lucy: IT'S THE LITTLE DOGGIE.

27
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,166
- Natsu: OH, MAN, IF WE
DON'T GET BACK TO WORK SOON,

28
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,458
I'M GONNA STARVE.

29
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,958
- HI, I'M LUCY,
A REAL-LIFE WIZARD.

30
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,333
AND THIS BEAUTIFUL CITY
IS MAGNOLIA,

31
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:07,791
A MAGNIFICENT PLACE FULL OF
MAGIC AND OPPORTUNITIES.

32
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,458
GO RIGHT THROUGH
THE CENTER OF TOWN,

33
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,333
PASS THE LOVELY
KARDIA CATHEDRAL,

34
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:14,250
AND YOU'LL FIND THE HOME OF
THE CITY'S ONLY MAGICAL GUILD,

35
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,708
FAIRY TAIL.

36
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,333
OH, THIS CUTE LITTLE PLACE
IS MY HOUSE,

37
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:21,250
A REAL STEAL AT
70,000 JEWEL A MONTH. TRUST ME.

38
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,541
I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT,
FROM THE TUB

39
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,916
TO ALL THE FLOOR SPACE 
TO THE AMAZING CLOSETS,

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,625
NOT TO MENTION THE ADORABLE
LITTLE RETRO FIREPLACE

41
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,916
AND STOVE.
ISN'T IT JUST DARLING?

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,833
BUT WHAT I LOVE MOST
ABOUT IT IS...

43
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,333
MY BEDROOM!

44
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,791
- ( grunts ) - GET THE HECK
OUT OF HERE, YOU JERKS!

45
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,458
- GEEZ, I JUST CAME OVER

46
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,416
TO CHECK OUT YOUR NEW PAD.
- AYE.

47
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,791
- OH YEAH, WELL, WHAT YOU CALL
CHECKING OUT,

48
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,833
I CALL BARGING IN.

49
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,916
AND I'M PRETTY SURE THE POLICE
WOULD CALL IT

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,375
"BREAKING AND ENTERING."

51
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,166
- COME ON, WE WERE JUST
TRYING TO BE FRIENDLY. 

52
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,625
- THIS IS A SERIOUS
INVASION OF MY PRIVACY.

53
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,250
- NICE PLACE YOU GOT HERE.

54
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,041
- LET'S TRY AND KEEP IT
THAT WAY, ALL RIGHT?!

55
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,833
- HEY, WHAT'S ALL THIS?

56
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,500
- ( gasps )
NOTHING!

57
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,250
- SO YOU JUST KICKED ME
IN THE FACE OVER NOTHING?

58
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,875
- YEAH, MAYBE I WOULD.

59
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,666
NOW WOULD YOU PLEASE
JUST GO HOME?

60
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,750
- OH, BUT YOUR PLACE 
IS WAY MORE EXCITING.

61
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,041
- I HATE BOYS.

62
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,208
- Happy: INFILTRATE 
THE EVERLUE MANSION.

63
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,875
- LOOK, I JUST MOVED IN

64
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,291
AND I'M NOT READY
FOR GUESTS.

65
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,875
SO HOW ABOUT YOU TWO
JUST DRINK YOUR TEA,

66
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,708
SAY THANKS, AND GET OUT?
YOU GOT THAT?

67
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,375
- TALK ABOUT COLDHEARTED.
- ICE COLD.

68
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,208
- WATCH IT, CAT.
- HEY, I KNOW.

69
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,541
WHY DON'T YOU SHOW
ME AND HAPPY

70
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:32,875
ALL THOSE WEIRD
LITTLE KEY GUYS

71
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,250
THAT YOU LIKE TO COLLECT.
- FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

72
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,708
THEY'RE CALLED
CELESTIAL SPIRITS.

73
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,458
- HOW MANY OF THESE
CELESTIAL SPIRITS

74
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,750
DO YOU HAVE
CONTRACTS WITH?

75
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,041
- SIX SO FAR.
NOT TO BRAG OR ANYTHING,

76
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,125
BUT I EVEN HAVE A COUPLE
DIFFERENT TYPES OF THEM.

77
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,625
THE SILVER KEYS ARE THE ONES

78
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,375
THAT YOU CAN FIND
IN THE MAGIC SHOPS.

79
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,208
I'VE GOT HOROLOGIUM THE CLOCK,

80
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,750
CRUX THE SOUTHERN CROSS,

81
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,166
AND LYRA THE HARP.

82
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,541
BUT THE GOLD ONES
ARE SUPER RARE.

83
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:57,250
THERE ARE 12 TOTAL AND THEY
OPEN THE GATES OF THE ZODIAC.

84
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,958
I'VE GOT TAURUS 
THE GOLDEN BULL,

85
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,583
AQUARIUS THE WATER BEARER.

86
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,708
THAT LAST ONE IS CANCER
THE GIANT CRAB.

87
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,375
- ( both gasp )
- GIANT CRAB?!

88
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,458
- GIANT CRAB LEGS!

89
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,000
- I'VE NEVER MET ANYONE
AS OBSESSED

90
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,375
WITH FOOD
AS THESE TWO.

91
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,500
THAT REMINDS ME.
I NEED TO MAKE A CONTRACT

92
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,125
WITH THE KEY
I BOUGHT IN HARGEON.

93
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,916
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU FELLAS
ARE INTERESTED

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,375
IN SEEING HOW A CELESTIAL WIZARD

95
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,250
MAKES A CONTRACT WITH
A CELESTIAL SPIRIT.

96
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,333
- I HOPE IT'S NOT SOME
GROTTY BLOOD PACT.

97
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,416
- WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE
A PAIN IN THE BUTT TO ME.

98
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,041
- UM, I CAN HEAR YOU,
SO LEAVE MY BUTT OUT OF THIS.

99
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,833
ALL RIGHT, PAY ATTENTION.

100
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:32,166
I CALL UPON THEE IN THE WORLD
OF THE CELESTIAL SPIRITS.

101
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,000
I BECKON YOU
TO MY SIDE AT ONCE.

102
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,208
PASS THROUGH THE GATE.

103
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,125
- ( circus music plays )

104
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,250
- OPEN,
GATE OF CANIS MINOR.

105
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,166
COME, NICHOLA.

106
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,833
- ( doorbell rings )

107
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,291
- ( gasping )

108
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,666
- NICE TRY.

109
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,041
- SHUT UP!
I MEANT TO DO THAT.

110
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:07,000
AWW, YOU ARE SUCH
A CUTIE-PATOOTIE.

111
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,500
- YOU THINK SO?

112
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:09,875
- IT DOESN'T TAKE
MUCH MAGIC POWER

113
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,708
TO GET THESE LITTLE GUYS
THROUGH THE GATE.

114
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,958
SO A LOT OF WIZARDS
ACTUALLY KEEP THEM AS PETS.

115
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,708
- YOU KNOW, THIS WHOLE PET THING
DOESN'T SIT WELL WITH ME.

116
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:19,125
- NOT WITH A WEIRD MASTER
LIKE LOONY HERE.

117
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:22,833
- MY NAME IS LUCY
AND I CAN STILL HEAR YOU.

118
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,208
WELL, LET'S START WORKING
ON OUR CONTRACT.

119
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,375
- ( warbles )
- ARE YOU FREE MONDAYS?

120
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,333
- MM-MMM.

121
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,375
- TUESDAYS?
- MM-HMM.

122
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,541
- WEDNESDAYS?

123
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,458
- THIS IS BORING.
- MM-HMM.

124
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,625
- GREAT, WELL, THAT
JUST ABOUT DOES IT.

125
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,708
- THAT WAS PRETTY EASY.
- YUP.

126
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,416
- IT MAY SEEM SILLY TO YOU,
BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

127
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,750
YOU SEE, A CELESTIAL
WIZARD'S CONTRACT

128
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,250
RELIES ON THE PROMISE
THAT'S MADE

129
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,750
BETWEEN THE WIZARD
AND THE SPIRIT,

130
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,541
WHICH IS WHY
I MAKE IT A POINT

131
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,208
TO ALWAYS KEEP MY PROMISES.

132
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,000
GOT IT?
- OH, YEAH.

133
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,791
- OKAY, NOW, I JUST
NEED TO COME UP WITH A NAME.

134
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,833
- ISN'T IT NICHOLA?
- NO, THAT'S THE SPECIES.

135
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,375
- OH, I KNOW.

136
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,750
COME HERE, PLUE.

137
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,083
- PLUE, HUH?

138
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,500
- I THINK IT'S LIKE
THE CUTEST NAME EVER.

139
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,791
RIGHT, LITTLE PLUE?

140
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,583
- ARE YOU SURE
HE'S COOL WITH THAT?

141
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,625
- WHY WOULDN'T HE BE?
- SO EVEN THOUGH HIS SIGN

142
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,583
IS THE LITTLE DOG,
HE DOESN'T BARK?

143
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,208
THAT'S KIND OF WEIRD.

144
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,416
- WELL, I DON'T HEAR YOU
MEOWING OVER THERE, BUDDY.

145
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,291
WHOA, WHAT'S HE DOING?

146
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:23,208
- OH, MAN, YOU'RE
RIGHT ABOUT THAT, PLUE.

147
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,458
- YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HIM?

148
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,750
WHAT IS YOUR DEAL?

149
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,708
- ALL RIGHT,
THEN IT'S SETTLED.

150
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,666
YOU'RE BOTH GONNA BE
A PART OF OUR TEAM. 

151
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,708
- GO TEAM!

152
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,125
- YOUR TEAM?

153
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,708
- AYE, EVEN THOUGH

154
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,041
EVERYBODY IN THE GUILD
IS ALLIED TO ONE ANOTHER,

155
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,916
SOME MEMBERS THAT
GET ALONG REALLY WELL

156
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,291
GET TOGETHER AND FORM TEAMS
WITHIN THE GUILD.

157
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,791
THAT WAY, JOBS THAT MAY BE
TOO HARD FOR ONE PERSON TO TAKE

158
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,458
CAN GET DONE BY A TEAM.

159
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,375
- AWESOME, LET'S DO IT.

160
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,125
- COOL, SO YOU'RE GONNA
WORK WITH US?

161
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,458
- YEP, YOU HAVE MY WORD.
- RIGHT ON.

162
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,458
- OKAY, TEAM, THEN
LET'S GET TO WORK.

163
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,833
I'VE GOT OUR FIRST JOB
RIGHT HERE.

164
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,958
- IT'S ALL HAPPENING SO FAST. 
LET ME SEE WHAT YOU GOT THERE.

165
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,125
SO IT'S IN SHIROTSUME, HUH?

166
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,416
NO WAY!  200,000 JEWEL

167
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,291
JUST FOR TAKING A BOOK
FROM SOME RICH GUY

168
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,750
NAMED DUKE EVERLUE.

169
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,375
- SHOULD BE A PIECE OF CAKE,
RIGHT?

170
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,541
- "PLEASE NOTE:

171
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,208
EVERLUE'S A DIRTY OLD MAN

172
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,958
WHO'S CURRENTLY LOOKING
FOR MAIDS WITH BLOND HAIR."

173
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,916
- WE KNOW A BLOND-HAIRED GIRL,
DON'T WE?

174
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,833
- YUP, AND I BET WE CAN
FIND HER A MAID'S UNIFORM.

175
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,750
- WHY YOU SNEAKY LITTLE--

176
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,500
THAT'S NOT FAIR!

177
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,208
- IT'S A GOOD THING
THAT CELESTIAL WIZARDS

178
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,583
NEVER GO BACK ON THEIR WORD

179
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,333
'CAUSE NOW YOU'RE STUCK WITH US.

180
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,791
- Lucy: BUT YOU TRICKED ME!

181
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,458
- Natsu: OH, LIGHTEN UP,
WOULD YOU?

182
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,791
NOW TRY GETTING INTO CHARACTER

183
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,291
AND ADDRESS HAPPY HERE
AS YOUR MASTER.

184
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,666
- NO WAY!

185
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,083
- UGH! DARN.

186
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,791
 DID SOMEBODY ALREADY TAKE
THAT BOOK-STEALING GIG?

187
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,541
THAT ONE PAID 200,000.

188
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,541
- SORRY, I GUESS NATSU
AND LUCY GOT TO IT FIRST.

189
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,250
- ( sighs ) I REALLY
COULD HAVE USED THAT MONEY.

190
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,166
- DON'T DESPAIR.  IT'S PROBABLY
FOR THE BEST, LEVY.

191
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,208
IT'S CHANGED.

192
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,625
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

193
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:57,958
- I WAS JUST CONTACTED
BY THE CLIENT

194
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,333
CONCERNING THAT JOB.

195
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:02,041
- OH, DID THEY CANCEL IT?
- NO.

196
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,458
QUITE THE OPPOSITE.

197
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,416
IN FACT, THE REWARD
HAS BEEN INCREASED.

198
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,958
IT'S NOW...

199
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,458
- 2 MILLION JEWEL?!

200
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,416
- THEY PAID THAT MUCH
FOR SOME STUPID BOOK?

201
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,083
- THAT'S ALMOST LIKE
FIGHTING MONSTERS KIND OF PAY.

202
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,875
- DID THEY GIVE
ANY REASON WHY?

203
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,708
Droy: MAYBE WE'RE
LUCKY WE MISSED IT.

204
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,791
Jet: LET'S FIND
SOMETHING EASIER.

205
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,375
- IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS JOB
JUST GOT INTERESTING.

206
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,958
- OH, GRAY, NICE SKIVVIES.
- HMM?

207
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,458
( screams )

208
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,375
- ( snorts )
- ARE YOU ENJOYING

209
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,958
YOUR CARRIAGE RIDE
TODAY, MASTER?

210
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,875
ANYTHING I CAN GET FOR YOU?

211
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,291
- I COULD REALLY USE
A BARF BAG RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

212
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,708
- I'M PLAYING
THE PART OF THE MASTER

213
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,333
SO I SHOULD BE
GIVING THE ORDERS.

214
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,625
- SHUT UP, YOU STUPID FELINE!

215
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:40,458
OH, HEY, NATSU?
- WHAT'S UP?

216
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,458
- I WAS JUST WONDERING
WHY YOU PICKED ME

217
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:46,083
TO JOIN YOUR TEAM. - 'CAUSE YOU
SEEM LIKE A NICE PERSON.

218
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:49,416
- WHOA, DID I ACTUALLY JUST GET
A COMPLIMENT FROM THIS GUY?

219
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,000
- BUT YOU'RE JUST SO WEIRD.

220
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,500
- THE FIRE-EATER WITH
THE TALKING CAT

221
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:53,541
THINKS I'M WEIRD?

222
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,916
ANYWAY, I'M TOTALLY STOKED

223
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,208
ABOUT MY FIRST REAL JOB.

224
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,791
I KNOW I'M GONNA ROCK IT.

225
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,416
- REALLY?  I THOUGHT
YOU WERE UPSET ABOUT IT.

226
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,791
- YEAH, I WAS MAD AT FIRST,

227
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,750
BUT IF THIS PERV
LIKES PRETTY GIRLS,

228
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,166
I'M PERFECT FOR THE JOB, RIGHT?

229
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,416
( giggling )

230
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,083
- ALL YOU HUMANS
KIND OF LOOK ALIKE TO ME.

231
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,458
- Lucy: I THINK IT'S TIME
WE WORKED OUT OUR PAY SCALE.

232
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,750
SINCE I'M DOING ALL THE WORK,

233
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:14,958
I THINK WE SHOULD
SPLIT THE REWARD

234
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,208
80, 10, AND 10.

235
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,541
- Happy: YOU ONLY WANT 10%?

236
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:18,625
- I'M THE 80!

237
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,166
- THEN...

238
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,916
- Narrator:
THE TOWN OF SHIROTSUME.

239
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,208
- THAT'S THE LAST TIME 
I'M RIDING IN ONE OF THOSE.

240
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,708
- YOU SAY THAT EVERY TIME.
- MAN, I'M STARVING.

241
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,708
- CAN'T YOU JUST
EAT YOUR OWN FIRE?

242
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,625
- OH, YEAH,
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

243
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,708
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST
EAT PLUE OR YOUR COW

244
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,083
WHILE WE'RE AT IT? - WHY WOULD
I DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

245
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,541
- IT'S KIND OF THE SAME THING.

246
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,458
- SO LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

247
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,666
YOU CAN EAT FIRE,
BUT JUST NOT YOUR OWN?

248
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,000
THAT'S KIND OF LAME.

249
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,500
- WHOA, LET'S STOP
AND GET A BITE.

250
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,541
- NAH, I'M ALL RIGHT,
BUT YOU TWO ENJOY.

251
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,375
- WHAT IS IT WITH HER?

252
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,875
WE SHOULD BE EATING
TOGETHER AS A TEAM.

253
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:53,916
- OH WELL.

254
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,041
- ( both chewing )

255
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,166
- BE SURE THAT YOU SAVE

256
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,708
ALL THE FAT STUFF FOR LUCY.

257
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:58,791
- YEAH, FROM
THE LOOKS OF HER,

258
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,041
THAT'S WHAT SHE LIKES THE MOST.

259
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,458
- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE, CAT.

260
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,166
WHAT THE HECK
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

261
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,791
- HEY.  LUCY?
- COME ON.

262
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,041
DON'T BE SHY, BOYS.

263
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,000
I KNOW I LOOK SUPER CUTE
IN THIS UNIFORM.

264
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,708
- ( gasps )

265
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,708
- HAVE YOU HAD
ENOUGH FOOD, MASTER?

266
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,208
OR SHALL I
BRING YOU SOME MORE?

267
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,416
YOUR WISH IS MY COMMAND.

268
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,875
- WHAT DO WE DO?

269
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,000
WE WERE JOKING
ABOUT THE COSTUME,

270
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,791
BUT SHE TOOK IT SERIOUSLY.

271
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,958
- I GUESS WE'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO GO ALONG WITH IT. 

272
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:25,000
DON'T SAY ANYTHING, OKAY?
- I CAN HEAR YOU!

273
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,791
- MY NAME'S KABY MELON.
PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

274
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:32,875
- HE SAID MELON. - OH, MAN,
YOU HAVE A TASTY NAME.

275
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,541
- QUIT BEING RUDE, GUYS.

276
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,833
- ( laughs ) DON'T WORRY.
I GET THAT A LOT.

277
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,250
- WHY DOES HIS NAME
SOUND FAMILIAR?

278
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,083
- WELL, FIRST THINGS FIRST.

279
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,916
ALLOW ME TO TELL
YOU ABOUT THE JOB.

280
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,458
- GO ON.
- YEAH.

281
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,583
- IT'S PRETTY
STRAIGHT FORWARD, REALLY.

282
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,083
DUKE EVERLUE HAS A BOOK

283
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,083
 CALLED "DAYBREAK"
IN HIS POSSESSION.

284
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,958
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO BURN IT
FOR ME. - NO PROB.

285
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,416
I'LL BURN THE WHOLE PLACE
DOWN IF YOU WANT.

286
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,000
- HE LIKES FIRE. - I'M NOT
GOING TO JAIL FOR ARSON

287
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,416
BECAUSE OF THE TWO OF YOU.
MAY I ASK WHY, SIR?

288
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,500
- FOR 200,000 JEWEL,
WHO THE HECK CARES? 

289
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,875
- THE REWARD HAS BEEN
RAISED TO 2 MILLION.

290
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,416
- ( all gasp )
2 MILLION?!

291
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,125
- I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE AWARE

292
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,333
THE AMOUNT HAD CHANGED.

293
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,666
- 2 MILLION SPLIT THREE WAYS?

294
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,833
WOW! I STINK AT MATH,
BUT THAT'S A LOT!

295
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,041
- WAIT, I GOT IT.

296
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,166
I GET 1 MILLION.
YOU GET 1 MILLION.

297
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,875
AND LUCY GETS ALL THE REST.

298
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,625
- THAT SURE SOUNDS
FAIR TO ME.

299
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,583
- AYE. - BUT THAT
LEAVES ME WITH NOTHING.

300
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,583
WHY'D YOU RAISE THE REWARD?

301
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:30,791
- WELL, BECAUSE IT MEANS
THAT MUCH TO ME.

302
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,666
THAT BOOK MUST BE DESTROYED,
NO MATTER THE COST.

303
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:35,708
- AH!

304
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,208
- OH YEAH!

305
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,666
I AM FIRED UP NOW.

306
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,083
LET'S DO THIS, LUCY.
- HEY, WAIT A SEC.

307
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:44,958
- "DAYBREAK..."

308
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,541
IT MUST BE BURNED.

309
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,208
IT CANNOT BE ALLOWED
TO EXIST ANY LONGER.

310
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,916
- Narrator: WELCOME
TO DUKE EVERLUE'S MANSION.

311
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,833
- EXCUSE ME, I HEARD
YOU HAD AN OPENING

312
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,500
FOR A MAID POSITION.
HELLO?

313
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,125
WOW THIS GEEZER
WITH MY LOOKS, 

314
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,125
BURN SOME STUPID BOOK,
AND COLLECT 2 MILLION JEWEL.

315
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,500
THIS'LL BE SWEET.

316
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,375
- DON'T SCREW UP, OKAY?
- BREAK A LEG.

317
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,000
- ( screams )

318
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,916
- SO YOU'RE A MAID?
- YEAH.

319
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,208
- I ASSUME YOU'RE HERE
'CAUSE YOU SAW THE AD

320
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,833
THAT THE MASTER
PLACED IN THE PAPER.

321
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:28,666
- BOYOYOYO.
DID I HEAR SOMEONE SAY "MASTER"?

322
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,833
- MORE LIKE MONSTER.

323
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,291
- LET'S SEE HERE.

324
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,250
- WELL, I SURE HOPE
YOU LIKE WHAT YOU SEE.

325
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,708
- ( grunts ) - OH, MAN,
HE IS CREEPING ME OUT.

326
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,708
STAY STRONG, LUCY.

327
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,500
- I'LL PASS.
NOW SCRAM, UGLY.

328
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:45,000
- YOU HEARD THE MAN.
GET GOING, UGLY.

329
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,166
- SORRY.

330
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,708
BUT A MAN OF MY STANDING

331
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,625
HAS CERTAIN STANDARDS
TO UPHOLD.

332
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:53,625
THAT'S WHY I ONLY HIRE
THE FAIREST OF THE FAIR.

333
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,500
- HUH?
- OH, YOU'RE THE BEST, MASTER.

334
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,500
- I'VE NEVER MET SUCH
A KIND-HEARTED MAN.

335
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,625
- I THINK YOU'RE
THE SWEETEST GUY ALIVE.

336
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,916
- WHY DON'T YOU
RUN ALONG HOME, UGLY?

337
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,625
- ( cries )

338
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,125
- JUST COULDN'T DO IT, HUH?
- I TRIED!

339
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,750
BUT THAT IDIOT
WOULDN'T KNOW BEAUTY

340
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,333
IF IT BIT HIM 
IN THE BEHIND.

341
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,041
- UH-HUH.
- ( cries )

342
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,416
THIS STINKS.

343
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,208
- OKAY, I GUESS
WE'LL HAVE TO RESORT

344
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,916
TO OLD PLAN T.

345
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,166
- YEAH, THAT BIG FAT JERK'S
GONNA PAY FOR THIS.

346
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,916
WAIT A SEC,
WHAT'S PLAN T?

347
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,583
- Happy: TAKE 'EM BY STORM.

348
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,000
- THAT'S NOT A PLAN.

349
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,083
- ( Everlue chuckles )

350
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,458
SO IT SEEMS WE HAVE
ANOTHER GROUP OF WIZARDS

351
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:33,666
AT OUR DOOR.

352
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,500
AND THESE
ARE FROM FAIRY TAIL.

353
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,500
- WHOOPSIE DAISY.
- THANKS A LOT, HAPPY.

354
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,958
- AYE.
- GEEZ.

355
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,750
THIS ISN'T REALLY TAKING
'EM BY STORM, YOU KNOW. 

356
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,000
I THINK WE SHOULD
HAVE JUST

357
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,416
BUSTED RIGHT IN THROUGH
THE FRONT DOOR.

358
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,958
- WHAT DID I TELL YOU BEFORE?

359
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,416
I'M NOT GOING TO JAIL
'CAUSE OF YOU.

360
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,750
- YEAH, BUT I THOUGHT
YOU WERE OUT

361
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,041
TO GET REVENGE ON THIS GUY.

362
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,208
- OH, I'LL GET MY REVENGE.

363
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,375
- NOT ONLY AM I
GONNA BURN HIS BOOK,

364
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,750
BUT I'M GONNA USE HIS TOOTHBRUSH
TO CLEAN THE TOILET.

365
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:05,458
- THAT IS TOTALLY GROSS.
- TOTALLY.

366
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,250
- WHOA, IS THIS SOME KIND
OF WEIRD STOREROOM?

367
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,750
- RAAWR!

368
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,166
CHECK ME OUT!
- YEAH.

369
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,458
YOU'RE LOOKING FIERCE, HAPPY.

370
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,125
- ( doorbells ring )

371
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,500
- ( toilet flushes )

372
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,375
- ARE WE GONNA HAVE TO SEARCH

373
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,500
EVERY ROOM IN THIS WHOLE
STINKING PLACE? - WELL, YEAH.

374
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,458
- I THINK WE SHOULD
TAKE A HOSTAGE

375
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,291
AND FORCE THEM TO TELL US
WHERE THE BOOK IS.

376
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,333
- AYE.
- KIND OF THE WHOLE IDEA HERE

377
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,166
IS NOT TO BE SEEN,
YOU DUMMY.

378
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,833
YOU'VE GOT TO BE STEALTHY,
LIKE A NINJA.

379
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,666
- LIKE A REAL NINJA.

380
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,083
- WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE
THAT HEAD OF YOURS?

381
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,958
- INTRUDER ALERT, VIRGO!
- LET'S CRUSH 'EM, GIRLS.

382
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,375
- Lucy: WE'RE TOAST.
- AAH!

383
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,208
- IT'S A MONSTER!
- ( whimpers )

384
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,458
- NINJA POWER!

385
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,750
- FLYING VIRGO ATTACK.

386
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,583
- WHOA!
- OH NO!

387
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,416
HEY, YOU COULD TAKE OFF
THAT MASK NOW.

388
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,833
- ( straining )

389
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,916
- ( grunts )

390
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,791
- WE MUSTN'T LET OURSELVES
BE DISCOVERED.

391
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,791
WE ARE NINJA.
- NINJA.

392
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,958
- NINJAS ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE QUIET, GUYS.

393
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,875
- WHOA, THERE ARE MANY BOOKS
IN THIS LIBRARY.

394
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,666
- AYE, THERE ARE, INDEED.

395
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,791
- WOW, WHO WOULD
HAVE THOUGHT

396
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,541
THAT EVERLUE'S
A MAJOR BOOKWORM?

397
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,750
- LET'S START LOOKING.
- AYE, SIR.

398
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,625
- ( sighs )

399
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,125
HOW ARE WE EVER GONNA FIND
ONE STUPID BOOK

400
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,958
IN THIS PLACE? - OOH, THIS ONE
HAS LOTS OF PICTURES.

401
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,375
- LOOK, IT'S A BOOK ON FISH.

402
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,750
- CHECK OUT THIS ONE.
IT'S SPARKLY.

403
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,375
- ( laughs )
- HEY, WOULD YOU GET SERIOUS

404
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,375
AND START LOOKING
FOR THE BOOK WE NEED?

405
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,541
( gasps )

406
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,166
IT'S "DAYBREAK."

407
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,750
- Happy: HAVE WE BEEN HERE
THAT LONG?

408
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,041
- YOU FOUND IT.
- NATSU FOUND IT.

409
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,333
- I DID? - 2 MILLION JEWEL,
HERE WE COME.

410
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:45,125
- LET'S SPARK IT UP.
- THAT WAS SO EASY.

411
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,125
- HOLD ON A SECOND.
I DIDN'T REALIZE

412
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,125
THIS WAS WRITTEN
BY KEMU ZALEON. 

413
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,541
- ZALE-WHAT?
- ZALEON WAS A GREAT WIZARD

414
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,208
AND AN AMAZING NOVELIST.
I'M SUCH A BIG FAN.

415
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,750
I WAS TOTALLY POSITIVE
THAT I'D READ

416
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,333
EVERY SINGLE SENTENCE
HE'D EVER WRITTEN,

417
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,333
BUT THIS MUST BE
AN UNPUBLISHED NOVEL.

418
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,416
- OH, YEAH, WHO CARES?
IT ALL BURNS THE SAME TO ME.

419
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,708
- DON'T YOU DARE TOUCH IT.

420
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,291
THIS IS A GREAT
WORK OF LITERATURE.

421
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,958
YOU BETTER STAY
AWAY FROM IT, PYRO.

422
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,458
- BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR MISSION?

423
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:08,916
- JUST FORGET ABOUT
THE STUPID MISSION.

424
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,583
- FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION.

425
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,125
- COME ON YOU GUYS,
LET'S JUST SAY WE BURNED IT.

426
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,958
I'LL KEEP IT A SECRET,
I SWEAR.

427
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,958
- I'M NOT A LIAR.
- AYE.

428
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,916
- Everlue: WELL, WELL,
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE? 

429
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,333
SO YOU THIEVES ARE LOOKING

430
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,125
TO PILFER "DAYBREAK" FROM ME,
ARE YOU?

431
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,500
BOYOYO.
- SEE, SLOWPOKE,

432
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,333
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.
- UM, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

433
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,541
- DON'T YOU THINK
IT'D BEEN WAY EASIER

434
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:31,833
JUST TO COME IN
THROUGH THE DOOR?

435
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,166
- I KNEW ALL YOU LOWLIFE
WIZARD TYPES

436
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,083
WERE COMING AROUND HERE
TO TAKE SOMETHING OF MINE.

437
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,833
I NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED
IT WAS THAT STUPID BOOK.

438
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,583
- STUPID? - THIS BOOK
MUST BE IMPORTANT

439
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:44,416
IF THE CLIENT IS WILLING
TO PAY SO MUCH TO DESTROY IT.

440
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,750
SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

441
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,625
WHY WOULD EVERLUE 
SAY THAT ABOUT IT?

442
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,166
THIS WORKS OUT GREAT.

443
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,541
IF IT'S SO STUPID,
I GUESS IT'S FINE 

444
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,208
IF I KEEP IT.
- IT'S MINE! 

445
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,291
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT.
SO GET YOUR GRUBBY HANDS OFF.

446
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:57,291
- GREEDY GUT.
- SHUT YOUR TRAP, UGLY.

447
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,041
- WOULD YOU HAND OVER THAT BOOK
AND LET ME GET THIS OVER WITH?

448
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,208
- NO WAY, I'M NOT
GIVING IT TO YOU.

449
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,708
- LUCY, THIS IS OUR JOB!

450
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,625
- WELL, AT LEAST
LET ME READ IT FIRST.

451
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:07,916
- All: READ IT NOW?!

452
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,750
- I'VE HAD ENOUGH.
HOW DARE YOU

453
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,791
PUT YOUR FILTHY HANDS
ON MY POSSESSIONS.

454
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,875
NOW, COME FORTH,
VANISH BROTHERS.

455
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,208
- YOU CALLED UPON US, SIR?

456
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,916
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT
THESE LITTLE PUNKS

457
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,500
ARE FROM THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD?

458
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,250
TALK ABOUT A BUNCH OF RUNTS.

459
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,750
- THAT SIGN MEANS THEY'RE FROM
THE SOUTHERN WOLVES.

460
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,875
IT'S A MERCENARY GUILD.

461
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,416
- SO YOU GOT BODYGUARDS,
DO YOU?

462
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,125
- OH WOW.

463
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,041
- BOYOYOYO, THE SOUTHERN WOLVES

464
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,791
ARE ALWAYS HUNGRY
FOR FRESH GAME.

465
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,250
SAY YOUR PRAYERS, THIEVES.

466
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,708
- HEY, TRY AND HOLD
THEM OFF FOR A WHILE.

467
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,166
I'M NOT SURE, BUT
I THINK THIS BOOK

468
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,416
HOLDS SOME KIND OF SECRET.
- RIGHT.

469
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,625
- A SECRET?

470
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,000
IT MUST HAVE SLIPPED BY ME
SOMEHOW.

471
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,250
IT COULD BE A TREASURE MAP
OR SOMETHING.

472
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,041
I'M GOING AFTER THE GIRL.

473
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,375
MAKE SURE PINK HAIR DOESN'T
LEAVE HERE IN ONE PIECE.

474
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,625
- Both: YES, SIR.
- HAPPY, GO ON AND HELP LUCY.

475
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,416
- ARE YOU SURE YOU 
DON'T NEED ME HERE?

476
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,875
- NO, THANKS,
BUT I'LL BE JUST FINE.

477
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,708
- WHOA, YOU SURE TALK BIG
FOR SUCH A LITTLE GUY.

478
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,958
- PERHAPS WE SHOULD
PUT HIM IN HIS PLACE.

479
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,458
SO YOU'RE A FIRE WIZARD.

480
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,458
- YEAH, BUT HOW'D
YOU KNOW THAT?

481
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,000
- WE SAW THE FIRE
AROUND YOUR LEGS

482
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,958
WHEN YOU WERE
FIGHTING VIRGO.

483
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,791
- SO IT'S OBVIOUS THAT YOU'RE
AN ABILITY-TYPE FIRE WIZARD.

484
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,541
- Narrator:
AN ABILITY-TYPE WIZARD

485
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:24,250
USES MAGIC THAT FLOWS
THROUGH THEIR BODY.

486
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,875
A WIZARD LIKE LUCY,

487
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,583
WHO USES ITEMS
THEY'VE COLLECTED,

488
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,333
IS CALLED
A HOLDER-TYPE WIZARD.

489
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:34,041
- SO I GUESS YOU KNOW WHAT
HAPPENS WHEN YOU PLAY WITH FIRE.

490
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,750
YOU GET BURNED!

491
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,500
- I'M SORRY TO
BREAK IT TO YOU, KID,

492
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,083
BUT FIGHTING FIRE WIZARDS
IS SOMETHING WE DO WELL,

493
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,791
VERY WELL.

494
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,666
- FAIRY TAIL MAY BE
A BIG-TIME GUILD AND ALL,

495
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,625
BUT YOU PATHETIC WIZARDS
ARE NO MATCH

496
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,458
FOR TRAINED
MERCENARIES LIKE US.

497
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,500
- HA, IF THAT'S YOUR BEST,
THEN YOU'RE DEAD WRONG.

498
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,083
- WHOA, THIS KID REALLY
THINKS HE CAN BEAT US.

499
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,958
- DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW WHAT
A WIZARD'S GREATEST WEAKNESS IS?

500
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,541
- ( gasps ) YOU TALKING ABOUT
MOTION SICKNESS?!

501
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,583
- UM, I THINK THAT MIGHT BE
MORE OF A PERSONAL PROBLEM.

502
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,000
- IS HE MAKING FUN OF US?

503
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:17,375
- THEIR WEAKNESS
IS THEIR BODIES.

504
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,541
SINCE WIZARDS HAVE
TO FOCUS SO INTENSELY

505
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,375
ON HONING THEIR
MENTAL ABILITIES...

506
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,791
- THEY NEGLECT TO
TRAIN THEIR BODIES,

507
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,833
WHICH LEAVES THEM
PHYSICALLY WEAK. 

508
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,250
- ON THE OTHER HAND,

509
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,416
WE FOCUS ON OUR
PHYSICAL ABILITIES.

510
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,750
- SO WE HAVE MORE POWER
AND SPEED THAN YOU.

511
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,208
- OH, I AM SO SCARED.

512
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,625
NOW STOP YOUR BLABBING
AND LET'S DANCE.

513
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,375
- HEY, BRO', COMBO ATTACK?

514
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:41,416
- SOUNDS GOOD.

515
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,750
- Both: HEAVEN AND EARTH
ANNIHILATION !

516
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,375
- BRING IT ON!

517
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,583
- Narrator: LUCY IS USING
HER WIND-READER GLASSES.

518
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,958
THEY ALLOW THE USER TO READ
AT MIND-BOGGLING SPEEDS.

519
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,416
- THAT'S AMAZING.

520
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,750
I KNEW THIS BOOK HELD
SOME SORT OF SECRET.

521
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,875
( gasps )
- WELL, THEN, PLEASE SHARE.

522
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,833
SECRETS DON'T MAKE FRIENDS,
YOU KNOW.

523
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,583
- NO WAY.
A MAN LIKE YOU

524
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,291
DOESN'T DESERVE
TO KNOW WHAT IT IS.

525
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,250
YOU'RE AN ENEMY OF LITERATURE.

526
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,708
- ( both screaming )

527
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:16,000
- LOOK TOWARDS HEAVEN
AND I STRIKE FROM THE EARTH.

528
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:24,291
- LOOK TOWARDS EARTH AND WE
STRIKE DOWN FROM HEAVEN.

529
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,291
- YOU HAVE WITNESSED
THE TRUE POWER

530
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,791
OF THE VANISH BROTHERS,

531
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,750
THE HEAVEN AND EARTH
ANNIHILATION TECHNIQUE.

532
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,791
- IT'S A FORCE THAT VERY FEW
ARE ABLE TO SURVIVE.

533
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,625
( gasps )
- GUESS I'M ONE OF THE FEW.

534
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,000
SORRY, GUYS.

535
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,500
- NO WAY.

536
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,666
- I'M GONNA BLOW YOU AWAY!

537
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,416
FIRE DRAGON ROAR!

538
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,541
- HA, FIRE MAGIC?

539
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:48,791
- WE'VE GOT HIM.

540
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,500
FLAME COOKING!

541
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:54,041
YOU SEE, MY FRYING PAN
ABSORBS YOUR FLAMES

542
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,458
AND DOUBLES THEIR STRENGTH...

543
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,083
RIGHT BACK AT YOU.

544
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:01,583
AH!

545
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,375
- NOW HE'S
A FLAME-COOKED FAIRY.

546
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,666
- GOOD-BYE, KID.

547
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,166
- ( screaming )

548
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,500
NO!
- OH, YEAH.

549
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:18,791
NOW I'VE GOT SOME
FIRE IN MY BELLY.

550
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,375
LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

551
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:29,708
FIRE DRAGON WING ATTACK!

552
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,666
- ( gasping )

553
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,333
- UH-OH.

554
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,416
DID I OVERDO IT AGAIN?

555
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:43,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

556
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,958
Mirajane: BOYOYOYO,
MIRAJANE IS AT YOUR SERVICE.

557
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:17,541
Lucy: WHAT THE HECK
DID YOU JUST SAY?

558
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,750
- I'M JUST HOPING THAT
EXPRESSION

559
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,458
WILL CATCH ON 
IN FAIRY TAIL.

560
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,666
- WELL, I REALLY HOPE
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

561
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,208
- OH, COME ON.
DON'T BE A DOWNER, LUCY.

562
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:28,250
IT'S SO CUTE AND
SO MUCH FUN TO SAY.

563
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,208
BOYOYOYOYO!

564
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:32,375
- STOP IT, MIRA,
YOU'RE FREAKING ME OUT!

565
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:33,458
Both: NEXT TIME...

566
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:36,750
Mirajane:
I BET WE'RE GONNA HEAR MORE

567
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,958
BOYOYOYOYO'S ON
THE NEXT EPISODE.

568
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:41,250
- Lucy: I DON'T KNOW IF
I CAN HANDLE MUCH MORE.
