The only way to do
that is to terminate

the Infinity Clock's ownership.

135
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,875
Basically, the seals branded

Guess the 'lil guy's
a lot smarter than he looks.

We know Grim Reaper

That means there's four left.

desperation as you try to think

155
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:56,375
up a way to overpower me,
and that strong will

156
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,000
of yours refusing
to give up the fight.

157
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,833
[ERZA] It seems your favorite
sound is that of your own voice.

158
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,541
Your magic doesn't frighten me.

159
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,458
I can hear thoughts as well.

160
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,125
[COBRA] Is that so?

161
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:13,583
I can hear the
thoughts of my friends.

162
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,375
They're saying
they refuse to lose

163
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,583
and that I shouldn't
give in either.

164
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,416
[COBRA] I hate to break it to
you but those are your thoughts.

165
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,583
You're so desperate
to win that your mind

166
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,375
is starting to play
tricks on you.

167
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:25,958
[ERZA] You wouldn't understand.

168
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,541
You're wrong.

169
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:31,250
I know they belong to my friends
because they are always with me.

170
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,625
Their love and friendship
is the source of my strength.

171
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,250
It drives me.

172
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,833
You have friends, don't you?

173
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,458
Can't you hear
them in your heart?

174
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:44,291
[COBRA] I'll warn you, the more
you talk, the angrier I get.

175
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,958
[COBRA] You're a
stubborn one, aren't you?

176
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,166
[ERZA] I know what you went
through in the Tower of Heaven,

177
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,583
I suffered the same
pain and anguish as you.

178
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,666
What I don't understand
is why you'd want

179
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,666
anybody else to
suffer the same way!

180
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,750
[COBRA] Are you referring
to Real Nightmare?

181
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,291
I honestly don't care
what happens with it.

182
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,166
Talk about making others suffer,

183
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,416
here you are yammering on
about all of your comrades.

184
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,208
When I've lost the
only friend I've had.

185
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,666
I knew you were
hiding something from me.

186
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,000
Step out of the shadows
and into the light.

187
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,125
It's the only way
to free yourself

188
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,500
from the pain you're feeling!

189
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:38,166
[COBRA] Step out of the
shadows and into the light?

190
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,666
There's no way that
you could understand.

191
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:45,000
[GRAY] So there's
only four left, huh?

192
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,291
Well, I'm about to
make it three.

193
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,291
[ANGEL] Why did
you take your shirt off?

194
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,083
You gave me a good thrashin'
before but not this time!

195
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,708
You'll be a real angel
when I'm done!

196
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,708
Oh, how I
hate stubborn men.

197
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,750
[GRAY] Beatin' up girls
'ain't really my thing,

198
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:02,000
but I gotta do this
to save my friend!

199
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,125
This one's for Lucy!

200
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:13,708
[LUCY] What is this?
What's happening to me?

201
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,375
Where am I?

202
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,625
[WARREN] Alright, thanks
for keeping us up to date!

203
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,083
It's really good to know
that Happy's theory was right!

204
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,541
And if we defeat all
of the Neo-Oración Seis

205
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,708
their seals will disappear
from the Infinity Clock.

206
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,875
[CARLA] That means they'll
completely lose ownership of it

207
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,750
and with nobody left
to control the clock,

208
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,416
the Real Nightmare is
bound to disappear as well!

209
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,333
[WENDY] But what about Lucy?

210
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:45,708
[WARREN]
Jean-Luc thinks she'll be freed

211
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,333
as soon as the all
of the seals are gone.

212
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,416
[WENDY] I don't know why,

213
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,458
but it feels like the
sky is getting restless.

214
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,208
[CARLA] I agree.
Do you think it's

215
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,333
possible that the
effects of the Real Nightmare

216
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,833
have been weakened
because two of the

217
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:04,291
six seals on the Infinity Clock
have disappeared?

218
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:07,583
I hope so, but
I'm a little afraid that

219
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,291
the clock will try
to protect the seals.

220
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:16,083
[SHAMSIEL] Hello there!
How's it goin?

221
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,166
[GRAY] Aw man,
not you again!

222
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,291
Ice Geyser!

223
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,166
[SHAMSIEL] An angel's light
is like a thousand suns.

224
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,083
See for yourself!

225
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,458
[SHAMSIEL] Huh?

226
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:35,583
[GRAY] That was just a decoy!
Ice Make: Death Scythe!

227
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,750
Curse you.

228
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,916
[GRAY] Looks like
I sent that evil chubster

229
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,708
you call an "angel"
back to Heaven.

230
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,208
[ANGEL]
That's right, back to Heaven.

231
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,416
Go on! I want
you to impale me.

232
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,041
Say what?
Have you gone insane?

233
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,833
[ANGEL] I want to vanish
into the sky like an angel.

234
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,250
I want it more than
anything in the world.

235
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,625
[GRAY] What?

236
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:11,958
[ANGEL] Please, I'm begging
you, send me into the

237
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,541
sky with Shamsiel.
It's my wish.

238
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:18,250
I want to be among the angels.

239
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,333
When you make
my wish come true,

240
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:23,000
this will truly
be a Death Scythe.

241
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,958
[GRAY] What the
hell has gotten into you?

242
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,708
What's wrong,
why can't you do it?

243
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,666
No. I could but
I don't wanna.

244
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,041
[ANGEL] If you're not
going to grant my wish,

245
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,833
then I'll have to destroy you!

246
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:44,916
[ANGEL] Cost, thirty!
I summon Baraqiel!

247
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,000
[GRAY] Geez! It's one after
another with this chick!

248
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,500
[GRAY] You're not
a freakin' angel!

249
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,666
You're a human and you know it!

250
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,333
[ANGEL] Time's up.

251
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,416
[GRAY] Oh crap!

252
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,166
[explosion]

253
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,958
[GRAY] No way!

254
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,708
[DAN] All right everyone,
let's calm down.

255
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,583
Dan Straight of the
Legion Platoon is here!

256
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:08,916
[ANGEL] Great, not you again.

257
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,041
[DAN] At long last,
I have found you, my Angie.

258
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:15,000
You can play hard to get
but I will win you over.

259
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:19,500
My love.
You can't run forever.

260
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,416
Hurry and dispose
of him, Baraqiel.

261
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,833
[DAN] Watch it, buddy!

262
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:28,416
Didn't anybody ever tell you not
to come between two lovers?

263
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:32,958
Okay, scram!

264
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,083
You've had plenty of alone
time with my Angiepoo.

265
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,291
It's only fair that I get
some too, dontcha think?

266
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,333
But you don't
even know what's

267
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,666
going on, I mean,
what about Lucy?

268
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,625
[DAN] I'm sure that
Natsu and Coco will figure

269
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,791
out a way to help my ex somehow.

270
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,875
[GRAY] So now she's your ex?

271
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,916
[DAN] I just had a chat
with Gray and he's cool with us

272
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,166
runnin' off and startin'
our new lives together!

273
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,791
[ANGEL] That's the
last thing I want.

274
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,916
This is the beginning of
our "happily ever after", Angie!

275
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,333
C'mon!
Our honeymoon awaits!

276
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,375
[ANGEL] You disgust me!

277
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,250
[GRAY] Talk about
divine intervention.

278
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:08,500
You're vulgar, distasteful,
and a complete waste of breath!

279
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:09,875
She's playin' coy.

280
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,208
Just watch, she'll come
runnin' any moment now.

281
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,916
[GRAY] You really that clueless?

282
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,666
[ANGEL] For the cost of one
hundred I ask that you come

283
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,875
forth from the light,
and obliterate in my name!

284
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,125
[ANGEL] I summon
the angel who

285
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,333
plays the sound
of the end times.

286
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,833
Raguel!

287
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:28,000
[DAN] Keep blowin'!
I won't back down!

288
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:31,000
[DAN] I'm willing to risk
my life for you, Angie!

289
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,958
[ANGEL] May you writhe
in pain and agony

290
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,833
until death seems like
a blessing from above!

291
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,041
[DAN] There's nothing
that can stop me!

292
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:43,958
I'll fight until the day
I win your heart!

293
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,000
C'mon, you've gotta
pull yourself together!

294
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,500
Wow.

295
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,333
I had no idea that you
cared so much about me.

296
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,041
How could you?]

297
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,583
[ANGEL] That man lacks
beauty and intelligence.

298
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,125
He's pathetic. 

299
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,125
He simply deserves to die.

300
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,833
You were beggin' me
to kill you a minute ago.

301
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,166
Quit acting like you're
all high and mighty.

302
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,250
You're no better than him.

303
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,625
You don't have
the right to choose

304
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,750
whether someone lives or dies!

305
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,083
Of course I do.
I'm an angel.

306
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,291
[GRAY] What?

307
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,458
[ANGEL] No...

308
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:20,833
I'm sorry, what I
meant to say is I'm a

309
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,083
maiden who longs to be an angel.

310
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,291
I have no doubt I'll
become one someday

311
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:28,208
but I want it so desperately
I can get impatient.

312
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,041
[GRAY] Huh?

313
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,250
[ANGEL] Yes.

314
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,458
I know that one day
my wish will come true.

315
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,833
[ANGEL] And when it does,
the power of my miraculous

316
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,208
Angel magic will
bathe me in its divine

317
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,958
light and wash
away all of my sin.

318
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,333
[GRAY] What sin?

319
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:46,041
[ANGEL] The worst of all.
Being born human.

320
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,458
You don't seriously
believe that, do you?

321
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,416
I chip away at
my own life whenever

322
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,666
I summon angels,
but I don't mind.

323
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,541
It's a sacrifice I'm willing to
make to become one myself.

324
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,875
[GRAY] Those coins
represent your life force?

325
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,125
And you're throwin' them away?

326
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,875
[ANGEL] What can I say?

327
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,208
I'm ready to trade in these
fake wings for real ones.

328
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,541
The more angelic
power I wield, the more

329
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:12,125
ugliness I see
in the human world.

330
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,333
[ANGEL] Yes.

331
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,333
This wretched place is
nothing more than a

332
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:18,958
disgusting cesspit
overflowing with human greed!

333
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,458
To vanish into
the sky like an angel.

334
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,041
That is my wish.

335
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:28,375
I want to bid farewell to this
rotten world and never return.

336
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,791
[ANGEL]
I will vanish beautifully.

337
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,666
[GRAY] You may be alive,
but you're dead on the inside.

338
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,083
How so?

339
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:42,083
[GRAY] You can't be happy.
All you ever do is babble

340
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:46,000
on about "sin" and how
this world is a "rotten" place.

341
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:49,250
But, you made that choice!
Just look at this guy.

342
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,541
He may be lovesick and insane
but he's honest with himself.

343
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,833
He chooses to live
life to the fullest!

344
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,250
[GRAY] If there's one
thing Fairy Tail's taught me,

345
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:01,500
it's that no matter how hard
things get you never give up.

346
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:05,500
We all laugh, yell, and even
cry as hard as we can!

347
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,000
We make the
most out of every,

348
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:10,500
single day 'cause each
one of 'em counts!

349
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,250
Goodness, you don't
have to yell at me like that.

350
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,250
[GRAY] People like
you make me sick!

351
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,333
The only reason
you wanna die so bad

352
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,625
is because you've
hardly even lived!

353
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,541
[GRAY] If you refuse
to be a part of this world

354
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,125
then you have no right
to call it a "rotten place."

355
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:28,583
'Cause the truth is, you
don't know anything about it!

356
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,750
[GRAY] The way you spout
off that nonsense, you sound

357
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:34,208
like a spoiled brat who's
pretending to be an angel!

358
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,458
[ANGEL] You think
it's "nonsense," do you?

359
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,916
[GRAY]
Why even bother vanishing?

360
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,541
There's no need.

361
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:43,125
'Cause you're pretty
much gone already.

362
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,166
How dare you mock me?
Belittle my deepest wish?

363
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,041
[GRAY] Whoa, what
the hell's happenin' to you?

364
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:53,625
[ANGEL] Raguel!
Destroy him at once!

365
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,375
[ANGEL] Yes,
that's a wonderful start!

366
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,875
Now, keep at it until
the fool's torn to pieces!

367
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,583
[GRAY] What is that?
It's disgusting.

368
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,250
[Angel chuckles]

369
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,750
[GRAY] This isn't funny!

370
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,666
Can't you see that your own
magic's about to devour you?

371
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,041
[ANGEL] Stay away!

372
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,708
[ANGEL] Prepare to meet your
destruction, you filthy human!

373
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,458
Let me go!

374
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:26,000
That ain't gonna happen!
Would ya take a look around?

375
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:29,083
Your beloved angel is about
to take over and kill you!

376
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,666
[ANGEL] But why?

377
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,208
[GRAY] Hasn't anyone
ever told you that the

378
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,708
stronger a spell is,
the more demanding it is?

379
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,500
When a weak-minded wizard
casts a powerful spell,

380
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,083
it can backfire and
engulf its caster!

381
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,625
[ANGEL] I'm not weak-minded!

382
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:44,291
I'm stronger than
you could ever imagine!

383
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm not gonna
argue with you!

384
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,041
Just look at your "angel."

385
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,125
Now tell me,
is this really what

386
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,208
you've been longing
for all of this time?

387
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,041
I guarantee, if this thing takes
you anywhere it's not gonna be

388
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:58,708
pretty blue skies, but more
like a pit of utter darkness!

389
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,333
[ANGEL] It's so ugly.

390
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,583
[GRAY] Yes, it is!

391
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,416
This is the true form
of the magic you gained!

392
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,625
It's just a parasite, feeding
off your life so it can grow!

393
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,416
This is what
you've become!

394
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,250
If you don't stop it,
there's no goin' back!

395
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,375
[ANGEL] So this is me?

396
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,416
[GRAY] C'mon, you've
gotta snap out of it!

397
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,875
You're not an angel!

398
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,208
You're human!

399
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,958
You're a living, breathing
human but not for long!

400
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,458
I know that's not true.

401
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:29,541
I'm not human.
I'm an angel!

402
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,041
Wake up, you idiot!

403
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,375
You're gonna vanish
for good when this

404
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,833
lump of flesh
swallows you whole!

405
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,291
[GRAY] This isn't what
you wished for, is it?

406
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,416
[ANGEL] This monster is me?

407
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,083
[GRAY] You've gotta
get it together!

408
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,458
You can't let your magic
get the best of you!

409
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,458
You have to live!

410
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,291
[ANGEL] No, please.
Help me!

411
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:02,583
[ANGEL] I'm scared.
Make it stop.

412
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:07,000
[ANGEL] I don't want to vanish.
I want to live.

413
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,416
I want to live!

414
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:20,166
[GRAY] Get outta here,
ya phony angel!

415

[GRAY] It's over.

418
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,666
[DAN] Ya gotta admit,
my timing was perfect.

419
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,375
[DAN] At the exact same moment
you destroyed that monster.

420
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,625
I shrunk the core of
Angie's magic to make it

421
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,625
as small as I could
possibly get it.

422
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,875
[DAN] Basically,
you got all your coins back.

423
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:00,916
[GRAY] And those years
have been added to your life.

424
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,833
I don't understand.

425
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:06,625
Why did you go to such lengths
to save the life of your enemy?

426
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:07,708
[GRAY] Huh.

427
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:10,041
Y'know, that's a
really good question.

428
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,791
I would've felt
like a total jerk

429
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,791
if I had just let you
vanish without a fight.

[ANGEL] Very well, then.
I admit defeat.
