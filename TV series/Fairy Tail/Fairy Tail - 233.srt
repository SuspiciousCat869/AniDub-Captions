00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,083
[NARRATOR]
Previously, Natsu and Gray

2
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:25,750
gave everything they had to
free the Village of the Sun.

3
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,833
At last, the frozen
Eternal Flame

4
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,708
was restored to its full glory,

5
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:34,958
and turned out to be the fiery
dragon, Atlas Flame.

6
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,125
In order to give
the weakened dragon

7
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:40,291
a tangible form, Wendy
used the Milky Way spell

8
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:44,333
that had been passed down
to her from Grandeenah.

9
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:47,375
With his strength returned,
Atlas Flame melted

10
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:49,750
the mysterious ice that
had covered the village,

11
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:52,750
and its people, for so long.

12
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:56,083
[WENDY] There's no trace
left of Atlas Flame.

13
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,208
He gave everything
to save the village.

14
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,625
[LUCY] To think that just a
fragment of his spirit could

15
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:04,000
be so powerful. He even created
a brand new Eternal Flame.

16
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:06,541
[NARRATOR] Before his passing,
the dragon told Natsu

17
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:09,750
of Igneel's failed attempt
to slay E.N.D.,

18
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:13,166
the strongest of Zeref's
demons, four hundred years ago.

19
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,500
[NATSU] So Igneel was tryin' to
take out a demon called E.N.D.?

20
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,166
Never heard of it.

21
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,250
I wonder what made
Atlas Flame think of that?

22
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,458
[HAPPY]
Who knows?

23
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,333
[NARRATOR] With this
latest job behind them,

24
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,541
the group prepares to head home.

25
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:29,666
But elsewhere, a mysterious
force begins to take action.

26
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,291
[MESSENGER 232A]
Excuse me, sir.

27
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:34,583
You've been ordered to
return to Headquarters

28
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:35,958
as soon as possible.

29
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,500
[SILVER]
You go and tell headquarters

30
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:40,208
that I'm busy paying
my respects.

31
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,333
[MESSENGER 232A]
My deepest apologies, Sir.

32
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:43,875
But each of the Nine Demon Gates

33
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:46,041
have been summoned
to this meeting.

34
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:50,083
Forgive my insubordinance,
but, Sir, I...

35
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:54,166
...I'm begging you!
Obey the order, please!

36
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,750
[SILVER] What's with
the trembling, friend?

37
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:00,291
Scared I'm gonna eat your soul?

38
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:01,791
[MESSENGER 232A stammers]

39
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,583
[SILVER]
Heh.

40
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,875
[SILVER]
You can put your fears to rest.

41
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,583
I only feast on the
souls of demons.

42
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,625

[NATSU, HAPPY, GIANTS laugh]

44
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,458
[LUCY]
They're getting along well.

45
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:07,041
[GIANT 233A] We owe you
little people big time!

46
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,833
[GRAY] We're just happy
that we could help out.

47
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,291
[WENDY]
Little people?

48
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,416
[CARLA]
I guess that would put you

49
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,958
in an even smaller
category, Wendy.

50
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:18,416
[GIANTS laughing]

51
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,333
[HAPPY, NATSU laugh]

52
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:30,750
'Scuse me.

53
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,500
But what exactly
happened to you?

54
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,916
[GIANT 233A] Honestly,
I can't really remember

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
much of anything.

56
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,208
We were told that some

57
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,625
demon slaying ice wizard
raided the village.

58
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,666
Yeah! I remember grabbing my
weapon to help fend him off.

59
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,625
Everything's a blur after that.

60
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,250
[GIANT 233F]
Mm.

61
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,875
According to Atlas Flame,
the ice wizard confused him

62
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:06,083
for a raging fire demon,
and came to take him out.

63
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,833
So the whole village
suffered because of

64
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:11,333
a case of mistaken identity?
That's far from uplifting.

65
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,500
No doubt. And I got
a feeling we've only

66
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,583
scratched the surface
of this thing.

67
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,291
The Succubus Eye creep
told me somethin'.

68
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:21,958
The netherworld gate
just busted wide open.

69
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,416
All thanks to you.

70
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,666
[GRAY]
Uh.

71
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,125
You'll realize the
consequences soon enough.

72
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,333
There's no turning back.

73
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,166
The netherworld gate?

74
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,208
That's Tartaros!

75
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,791
[LUCY whimpers]

76
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,708
I think someone from Tartaros
was behind this from the get-go.

77
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,666
The fact that Succubus Eye
came here proves that.

78
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,833
They were sent
to keep it frozen.

79
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,291
So freezing the whole village

80
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,458
wasn't about extinguishing
Atlas Flame?

81
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:49,083
It's possible, but it's all just
speculation at this point.

82
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:52,000
Who cares? We finished
the job, so let's party!

83

You're finally home.
You should be happy!

Listen. I abandoned the village.
I ran and never looked back.

95
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,708
They hate me.

96
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:38,416
[LUCY] That's not true!
Just look at those smiles!

Never mind.

Uh.

It's been a long time.

00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,625
I hardly recognize you.

You might still be tiny,

U-Uh... Uh.

Uh...

[FLARE]
I-It, was a lot of fun.

full of hardships.

Our songs and laughter
filled the village

Tartaros must know we lost

I had expected punishment
for our failure,

this kind of butchery.

00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,541
I don't know what you mean.
Your jobs are your own business.

160
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:37,166
[MINERVA] Uh?! Tartaros didn't
order us to the village?

161
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,041
Was it a private
request from Silver?

162
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,166
My only concern
is enhancement.

163
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,208
I seek out anyone
that is worthy.

164
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,416
War is coming.

165
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,875
My master needs all
the troops he can find.

166
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:52,458
That is where I come in.
I'm something of a recruiter.

167
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,250
It must be difficult
to form an army

168
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,958
when you massacre your troops.

169
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,833
You're not much of
a recruiter, are you?

170
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:02,208
I have no need for those
unfit for enhancement.

171
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,500
[MINERVA gasps]

172
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,625
Let's see if you fare
otherwise, shall we?

173
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,791
[MINERVA]
No. Stay back!

174
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,125
[MINERVA screams]

175
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,208
[glug]

176
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:01,083
[GROUP sighs]

177
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,375
Getting to the village
was a total breeze.

178
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,458
Going home is a different story.

179
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,708
Warrod's magic was much
better than walking.

180
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,083
I didn't think anything could
move that quickly.

181
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,541
Consider this training.

182
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,833
Besides, we get to
enjoy the scenery.

183
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,125
We should hurry though.
I can't wait to see

184
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,333
Warrod's face when he hears
we saved the village.

185
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:19,875
Uh-huh.

186
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,750
The thought of a huge reward
completely slipped your mind.

187
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:24,583
[LUCY laughs]

188
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:25,541
[NATSU]
Huh?

189
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,208
[GIANT 233A]
See you later!

190
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:31,000
[GIANT 232G]
Visit again anytime!

191
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,458
[LUCY]
Uh?

192
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:38,333
Thanks, Blondie. For everything.

193
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:39,833
[LUCY laughs]

194
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,958
Somethin' funny? Or are you
just going crazy over there?

195
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,208
[HAPPY]
I can't see her face,

196
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,541
but I think she finally
lost her mind.

197
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,750
[ERZA] Okay, that's
enough rest. Let's go!

198
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,291
[ALL BUT ERZA groan]

199
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,000
Hold on. Something's fishy here.

200
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,125
What do you mean?
Smell somethin'?

201
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,750
I just can't remember what
we're getting paid for this job.

202
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,125
Huh. That's weird,
neither can I.

203
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,208
Don't worry.
Warrod's a Wizard Saint,

204
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,791
he must be rollin' in Jewel,

205
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,666
and I'd be happy
to lighten the load.

206
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,625
I don't care about the money.
The sense of pride

207
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,208
in our accomplishment
is reward enough for me.

208
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,250
[NATSU] Someone's feelin'
self-righteous.

209
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,750
[HAPPY]
Holier than thou, much?

210
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,166
[ERZA] I'm sorry.
Did you say something?

211
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,333
[HAPPY]
It was Lucy!

212
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,708
[LUCY]
Don't drag me into this!

213
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,916
[WARROD laughs]

214
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,708
There wasn't a doubt in my bark

215
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,791
that you kids would
be up to the task!

216
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,916
Well done, everyone!
Well done, indeed!

217
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,541
We hardly broke a sweat.

218
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,375
It was our privilege to help the
villagers and to serve you,

219
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,416
Sir Warrod. You honor all of us.

220
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,166
Oh yeah, what happened to
the treasure hunting creeps?

221
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,708
I sent them off in grand style.

222
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,375
[WENDY]
We also found out Tartaros

223
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,083
may have frozen the village.

224
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,666
[WARROD] Is that so?
Well, we can let the Council

225
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,083
worry about investigating
that sorry lot. For now,

226
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:59,750
there are more important
matters. Like your reward.

227
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,333
We are getting paid!

228
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,833
Well, we did complete
the task. Why wouldn't we?

229
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,958
[WARROD]
Enjoy.

230
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,333
Thank you. Uh...

231
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,541
Remember, small potatoes
are better than none!

232
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:18,458
[laughs]

233
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,333
Don't worry, I wouldn't
do that to you!

234
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,458
[NATSU chuckles]
I hope not.

235
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,333
[GRAY chuckles]

236
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,333
Before I forget. The potato
set me back a few jewel,

237
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,708
so I took it out
of your pay.

238
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,083
[GRAY, NATSU growl]

239
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,625
[NATSU]
You think you're funny old man?

240
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,166
[GRAY]
I've got a joke for ya!

241
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,291
[LUCY]
This feels amazing.

242
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,833
[ERZA]
And so is the view.

243
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,250
[WENDY]
What a reward.

244
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,583
Oh, yeah. This is
everything I needed.

245
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,458
[ERZA] I have to hand
it to Sir Warrod,

246
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,791
this hidden hot
spring is top notch.

247
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,250
[CARLA]
I'll say.

248
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,958
By the time we're done here,
we should all be glowing.

249
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,500
[WENDY]
Awesome!

250
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,958
It's hard to beat a good
soak after a long journey,

251
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,125
that's for sure.

252
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:05,000
I would have to agree.
Whole-heartedly.

253
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:08,500
It's the perfect way to soothe
our bodies and focus our minds.

254
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,250
[ALL sigh]

255
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,166
[LUCY]
I'm getting hungry.

256
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,958
[WENDY]
Yeah. Should we go?

257
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,541
[CARLA]
Yes, and soon.

258
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,125
Before the tomcat
and the meathead

259
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,666
eat everything in sight.

260
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,750
[WARROD]
I don't like to brag,

261
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,541
but I know my way
around a bar-b-q.

262
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,083
[NATSU, GRAY] No kidding,
old man. This is amazing!

263
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,791
[HAPPY]
Thanks for the noms!

264
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,541
Sorry to keep you waiting.

265
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,916
I knew you were
eating without us!

266
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,541
Now that I smell the food,
I don't blame them.

267
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,958
What a delectable aroma!

268
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,041
[WARROD]
I'm happy you could join us!

269
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,500
I have some drinks here,
if you're thirsty.

270
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,875
[ERZA] My apologies, Sir!
I'm so embarrassed.

271
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,916
I should have done that for you.

272
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,625
[WARROD]
Nonsense! You're my guests.

273
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,375
I'm happy to do it myself!

274
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,541
Please, have as much
as you can drink!

275
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,041
Thank you! I bet it's delicious.

276
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,958
It smells like a forest.

277
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,333
These little trees are
actually growing out of it!

278
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,875
So, question...
Why I am the only one

279
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,666
with a mushroom
coming out of their cup?

280
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,416
Do you have something
against mushrooms, Happy?

281
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,666
[NATSU]
What's in this stuff?

282
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,958
No offense, but it smells
like dead leaves.

283
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,500
It's a special blend of
medicinal herb tea.

284
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,583
It's great for relieving stress,
and even helps you stay regular.

285
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,666
It took me a long
time to perfect,

286
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,250
and it's my great pleasure
to share it with you.

287
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,958
[ERZA]
Down the hatch.

288
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,583
[glug]

289
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,791
You kids'll believe
anything, won't you?

290
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,166
[GROUP groaning]

291
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,791
[WARROD] Well, the part
about relieving stress

292
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,625
was true, at least.

293
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:31,875
[LUCY gulp]

294
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,833
Gross. I've tasted better
brew from a sewer.

295
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,291
That's quite some tea.

296
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,250
It's delicious. Thanks.

297
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,958
You've been real
stressed out lately,

298
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,208
you can take the rest
of mine. Drink up!

299
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,708
What are you talkin' about?

300
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,791
You're the one that
needs to chill, dude.

301
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,500
Don't be shy, drink it all.

302
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:48,708
Knock it off!

303
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,875
You're being impolite!

304
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:51,875
Then you can have it.

305
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,083
[ERZA]
Mm!

306
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,041
[WARROD chuckles]

307
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,416
[GROUP]
Mm?

308
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,083
[WARROD]
Spending time with guild mates

309
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,041
can be such a
wonderful experience.

310
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:03,000
I must admit,
I'm feeling nostalgic.

311
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,250
[LUCY]
Uh.

312
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,333
That's sweet, but since
when are we guild mates?

313
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,000
--[WARROD] Ha!
--[LUCY] Uh...

314
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:12,333
So sorry about that. I was sure
Mahkarov already told you.

315
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:16,250
[GROUP]
Uh...

316
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:19,000
I was a part of Fairy Tail
from the very beginning.

317
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:22,291
Right alongside Mavis, and
the other founding members.

318
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,458
You could even say I'm
your senior's senior.

319
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,833
[LUCY]
U-Uh...

320
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,250
[WENDY]
Uh.

321
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,291
No.

322
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,541
What?

323
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:38,166
[NATSU gasps]
Really?

324
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,125
[HAPPY] That makes you
as old as the first master!

325
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,666
[CARLA]
That is what he just said.

326
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,791
I see. So that's why...

327
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:47,958
You'll go.

328
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,583
And while you're out
there, you'll behave

329
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:53,500
to the best that your feeble
little minds are able.

330
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,583
[LUCY] I was wondering why
gramps was so uptight

331
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:59,958
when he's a Wizard Saint, too.
Now it makes sense!

332
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,333
I was just--

333
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,833
No! Don't say it!

334
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,083
Telling you the truth.

335
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,833
[GRAY groans]

336
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,083
[ERZA]
I see.

337
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:10,208
That's why you asked for
Natsu and Gray by name.

338
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,708
[WARROD]
Mm-hmm. Exactly!

339
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,625
You have the smell of the
guild's old trees on you.

340
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,500
As soon as you walked
into my home,

341
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:20,708
I knew you were my companions.

342
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,833
[ERZA, GRAY, NATSU chuckle]

343
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,083
Actually, that one was a joke.

344
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,125
[LUCY]
Heh.

345
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,958
We're not making
much progress here.

346
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,083
Meeting a new generation of
fairies has been inspiring.

347
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:35,916
You truly embody the
spirit of harmony.

348
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,208
The kind of harmony
Mavis talked about.

349
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,250
[GROUP]
Hm.

350
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:43,416
[WARROD] She dreamed of a
wizard guild bound not by blood,

351
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,375
but by the souls of its members.
That is Fairy Tail.

352
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,916
The foundation she laid
for our guild is so strong,

353
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,791
her spirit lives
on in your hearts.

354
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,791
I'm not saying this because
you completed the job.

355
00:18:56,875 --> 00:19:01,125
I could feel it the moment
you walked into my home.

356
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:06,208
[WARROD chuckles]
Mavis told me something once.

357
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:09,833
"A comrade is much
more than just a word.

358
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,750
A comrade lives in your heart!

359
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:16,291
Someone you can trust
unconditionally."

360
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
[NATSU sighs]

361
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,666
I want you to feel like
you can rely on me.

362
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,750
Because, one day, I'll need you.

363
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:28,000
And our trust in each other
will see us through.

364
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:35,208
[MAVIS] Whenever you're
suffering, whenever you're sad,

365
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,208
I'll be there to make
sure you remember

366
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,000
that you never have
to face it alone.

367
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,875
[MAVIS]
We have as many hopes and dreams

368
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,750
as there are stars
in the sky. If we walk

369
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:50,875
toward the future together,
I know we'll reach them.

370
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,750
Now, let us move forward.

371
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,750
Forever in tune with
the song of the fairies.

372
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,083
[LUCY] I never thought I'd hear
Fairy Tail's founding words.

373
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,666
Mavis was truly incredible.

374
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,291
So, let me get
one thing straight.

375
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,250
You're more gramps
than gramps aren't ya?

376
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,416
Can you be polite
for two seconds?

377
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,958
Look, I'm not tryin'
to be rude here.

378
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,791
I was just thinking that,
since you're really old.

379
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,083
You might know something
about this demon.

380
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,958
It's called E.N.D.

381
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:28,958
[WARROD]
E.N.D.? Tell me more.

382
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,875
[NATSU] He's from the Book of
Zeref. Apparently, my old man,

383
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:35,291
Igneel, tried to take
him down way back when.

384
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,833
Zeref, you say?

385
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:40,291
I haven't heard that
name in a tree's age.

386
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,500
I've been trying to find Igneel
ever since he disappeared.

387
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,833
I thought if I found out
more about E.N.D.,

388
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,083
it might lead me to him.

389
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,708
Atlas Flame told us
there was history

390
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,500
between Igneel
and the demon.

391
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:54,208
[WARROD] Hmm. Sorry,
but I don't know anything.

392
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,958
However, there might
be a connection

393
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:02,166
between this E.N.D.
character and Tartaros.

394
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:06,375
They're an eerie group of
wizards, shrouded in secrecy.

395
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,666
No one knows how many
members they have,

396
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,875
or where their guild is located.

397
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,041
But I've heard
stories from people

398
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:17,750
claiming to have stumbled
upon their gatherings.

399
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:22,583
And all of them came to
the exact same conclusion.

400
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:26,375
The Tartaros rituals are
for worshipping demons.

401
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:27,875
[GRAY grunts]

402
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,875
[WARROD] Now we don't
know for certain,

403
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:36,291
but the Four Emperors of
Ishgar have a grim suspicion.

404
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,958
We believe Tartaros
may be in possession

405
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:42,625
of a demon from
the Book of Zeref.

406
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,833
You're kidding!
A guild with a demon?

407
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,000
Creepy!

408
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,125
If that's true,

409
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,291
it could be the one
we're lookin' for!

410
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:53,041
[GRAY]
So tusk face was involved.

411
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,500
I knew I was onto something.

412
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:08,666
[NATSU growls]
This sucks! Ah!

413
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,375
We can't do anything about it!

414
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:13,208
We don't even know
where they are!

415
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,041
If I get my hands on
one of those freaks,

416
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,416
I'll thrash 'em around till
they tell me everything!

417
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,458
--[HAPPY, CARLA scream]
--[NATSU] Like this! And this!

418
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:20,625
[WARROD]
Uh...

419
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:23,458
[NATSU] Tartaros won't
know what hit 'em!

420
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:26,833
Natsu. Look down.

421
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,291
Huh?

422
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,458
[ERZA growls]

423
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:32,916
[NATSU whimpers]

424
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:41,166
[NATSU screams]

425
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:16,625
[LUCY] Our group returns to the
guild after a job well done.

426
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:18,208
For the first time in awhile,

427
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,958
things are actually
pretty peaceful.

428
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,666
But the shadow of Tartaros,

429
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,916
the demon worshipping dark
guild, looms overhead.

430
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,333
And threatens to
ruin that peace.

431
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,291
Then, in a shocking
turn of events,

432
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:32,250
we find out that
Tartaros might be

433
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:35,458
even closer to home
than we realized.

434
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:36,833
Next time!

435
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:39,208
Tartaros Chapter, Prologue -
The Nine Demon Gates!

436
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:41,916
The netherworld gate has opened.
