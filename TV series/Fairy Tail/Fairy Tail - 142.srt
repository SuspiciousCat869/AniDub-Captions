160
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,125
[ELFMAN] He's doin' it again!

161
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:39,375
It's raining. That
gives me an idea!

162
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,083
Open... Gate
of the Water Bearer!

163
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,541
Aquarius!

164
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,875
[AQUARIUS] You'd better have
a good reason for this!

165
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,625
[AQUARIUS] And how many times
do I have to tell you not to

166
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,833
pull me outta some mud--
filled hole in the ground?!

167
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,625
Because I really
don't like it!

168
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,291
Yeah, I'm sorry
about that.

169
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,791
But if you're looking
to blame someone,

170
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,000
it's that creepy
robot-teddy bear's fault!

171
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,375
[AQUARIUS] Why is it
every time I'm on a date,

172
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,458
you have some crisis
you can't handle?

173
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,583
Jealous much?

174
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,166
[LUCY] Gimme
a break.

175
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,250
Well, since I'm here...

176
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,458
Let's get this over with!

177
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:14,958
Manly attack!

178
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,291
No way, ya meathead!
I'm gettin' to him first!

179
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,875
[JACKPOT] Round-and-round we go!

180
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,250
[NATSU screams]

181
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,458
Huh?!

182
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:26,125
[AQUARIUS screams]

183
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,875
[crash]

184
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,458
Don't those idiots know
that the house always wins?

185
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,250
You got in my way.

186
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,958
Nuh-uh, you
got in my way.

187
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,833
Will both of you
just shut up?!

188
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,041
Now this is just
getting embarrassing.

189
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:42,083
The two of them can't seem
to work together at all.

190
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,750
[KATJA] I'm afraid
we're getting to the end...

191
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,083
[squeak]

192
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,458
[KATJA] Hey, Nico...
How much longer do you think

193
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,291
this tree is going to live?

194
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,916
[squeak]

195
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,041
[MALE PRIEST B]
Miss Katja!

196
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,875
What in the world are
you doing out here?!

197
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,208
[KATJA] I was just
looking at this tree.

198
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,500
[squeak]

199
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:03,708
[MALE PRIEST B] It's
far too dangerous for you

200
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,833
to be outside
on your own like this!

201
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,750
Haven't you heard
about what's going on?!

202
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:11,500
[KATJA] Of course I've heard...
I know there are not many left.

203
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,333
[MALE PRIEST B]
That's true, so...

204
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,250
That's why
I came out here.

205
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:18,125
In the hopes that this
tree might remember me...

206
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,333
Just a hope.

207
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,666
[squeak]

208
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,666
[MALE PRIEST B] Miss Katja,
I'm sorry to tell you

209
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,625
that Fabrizio was
discovered and taken away.

210
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:30,708
[KATJA] He was? Then it's very
likely that I will be next.

211
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:34,875
If you get too scared,
you can always run away... Okay?

212
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,458
[sad squeak]

213
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,583
[GAJEEL] So is it really that
bad, bein' partnered up with me?

214
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,625
No, It's not
about you, Gajeel.

215
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,000
Cuz if you wanna team up
with that naked freak show,

216
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,333
be my guest.

217
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,916
It truly doesn't have
anything to do with you...

218
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,166
It's him... My love...
My darling Gray.

219
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,458
[JUVIA] I can just picture
us... Sitting in a patio café

220
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,625
by the river... The warm
sun shining down on us

221
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,958
while we drink tea and talk
into the evening hours...

222
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,000
Or maybe we'd talk forever.

223
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,666
[happy sigh]

224
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,583
Hey! Make with
the tea already!

225
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:18,916
And put some iron in it!

226
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,291
If you want
tea so badly,

227
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,541
then just go
inside and get some!

228
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:25,250
I'm staying right here
where I am, in the sunlight,

229
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,958
cuz I don't
wanna get rusty!

230
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,041
So they're just gonna
have to bring it to me!

231
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,750
[JUVIA] I'm warning you...

232
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:32,958
Hmmm?

233
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,166
[JUVIA] Don't you
dare get in my way.

234
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,750
What's the big deal?

235
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,416
We're just three friends hangin'
out, havin' some tea together.

236
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,583
That's true, but I think
three's a crowd...

237
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,250
So just get lost!

238
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:46,000
I just said I don't
wanna get rusty!

239
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,791
So do you
understand now?

240
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,416
Who, me? No, of
course I don't...

241
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,250
You sound crazy.

242
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,208
[JUVIA] No one
understands me.

243
00:11:58,916 --> 00:11:59,958
[BIXLOW] How ya doin', Wendy?

244
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,375
[WENDY] I'm hanging in there!

245
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,583
[BIXLOW] We're getting
pretty close...

246
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,666
It's just over
this mountain pass.

247
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,041
[WENDY] That's great!

248
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,541
[rolling thunder]

249
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,041
Well that's weird.

250
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,291
A thunderstorm?

251
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,416
I've always heard
mountain weather

252
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,875
is unpredictable.

253
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,250
[BIXLOW] What in the--?!

254
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,458
That storm just
came outta nowhere!

255
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,916
[ERIGOR] What was the weather
was like yesterday...?

256
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,708
I can't remember.

257
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,666
[BIXLOW] It's that guy who
calls himself Grim Reaper...

258
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,125
He's like one big,
walking black cloud.

259
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,666
[WENDY] He used
to be called Erigor.

260
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,625
He was with the
dark guild Eisenwald.

261
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:39,291
Those names mean
nothing to me now.

262
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:42,458
I don't know Erigor...
or Eisenwald...

263
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,291
[BIXLOW] C'mon,
gimme a break, man.

264
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:47,250
You have gotta have
the world's worst memory.

265
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,541
Maybe...

266
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,708
But I do know
what's coming next.

267
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,875
Cloudbursts from above!

268
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,208
[ERIGOR] And tornadoes
ripping through the air!

269
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,291
I can create weather patterns
that defy the very laws

270
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:06,791
of nature and destroy pesky
little flies like you!

271
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,000
What'd you say?

272
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,583
Don't worry, Bixlow...
I can support you.

273
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,000
[BIXLOW] Listen up, ya
windbag! We ain't no flies!

274
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,333
We're the Fairy
Tail wizards

275
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,125
who are gonna
kick your butt!

276
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,875
Powerful gusts...
from below!

277
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,416
[WENDY screams]

278
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,208
[ERIGOR] What's the matter?
Are you nothing but talk?

279
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,333
[BIXLOW] Dammit!

280
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:33,541
[WENDY] I can
heal you...

281
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,791
There's not
enough time!

282
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,750
[magic power charging up]

283
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,541
[BIXLOW] Uh-oh.

284
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,708
Fairy Tail...
I don't know it... However...

285
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,541
I do know that
dark skies are coming.

286
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,208
A violent thunderstorm!

287
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,208
Raining down from above!

288
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,208
Stand back!
I can stop it!

289
00:13:56,291 --> 00:14:00,708
Sky Dragon... Roar!

290
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,291
I don't understand
this guy...

291
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,791
It's like he's
soulless.

292
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,541
Followed by lightning
directly behind you.

293
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:13,916
Too slow, pal!

294
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,083
Huh?

295
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,458
[BIXLOW] I've already
moved their souls

296
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,083
into different dolls!

297
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,291
So now you're gonna get it!

298
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,541
Point-blank Baryon Formation!

299
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,458
No, he got away!

300
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:29,083
What the heck?! I didn't
know that he could fly!

301
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,791
[ERIGOR] Neither did I...
Seems I had forgotten.

302
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,125
Can you tell me who
you people are again?

303
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,541
Seriously?

304
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,083
Did he actually forget that
he was fighting against us?

305
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,833
Sky Dragon... Wing Attack!

306
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,125
[ERIGOR] Are you really
foolish enough to use wind magic

307
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,666
against a man who can
control the weather?

308
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,875
That's your last mistake!

309
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,750
Wendy, you gotta
get out of the way!

310
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:58,291
[COWS moo]

311
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,791
[ERIGOR] I can create
a wind so powerful,

312
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,791
nothing can withstand it!

313
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,916
[BIXLOW screams]

314
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,458
[BIXLOW] It's
raining stinky cows!

315
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:14,666
I'm so sorry... It's

[PANTHERLILY] The Infinity
Clock has been assembled

319
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,500
and taken by the Oración Seis.

320
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:25,875
Yes, they have it...

321
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,208
So what are your people
going to do about it now?

322
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,750
Do you have a plan?

323
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,791
I've made several
calculations...

324
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,666
But I'm afraid the
situation has suddenly

325
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,250
grown exponentially
more complex. Alas...

326
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,875
Even I can't seem
to comprehend it.

327
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,250
Now I get it!

328
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,750
You were following us so
you could ask us for help!

We're fellow

[SAMUEL] Yes, your
assumption is correct...

331
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,708
If things get any more out
of hand, I fear the situation

332
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,541
could become too much for
humans to sufficiently handle.

333
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,291
Oh, so that's
what you think now?

334
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,375
Funny, I thought you said
Zentopia's teachings were

335
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,125
all that mattered to you.

336
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,000
While I truly treasure
our doctrine,

337
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,666
adaptability is paramount
to one's survival.

338
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,166
Makes sense
to me.

339
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,541
Okay, then go on
and tell us what

340
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,416
we can do to help you.

341
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,875
It's not that simple...

342
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,166
The truth is, all you ever
seem to think about is fish,

343
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,250
and brother Lily is nothing more
than pure, mindless, brawn.

344

Tell me, Carla...

347
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,208
You possess the power
of clairvoyance...

348
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,208
Have you sensed anything
out of the ordinary?

349
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,458
I've had several visions,
although none have

350
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:30,625
been very clear...
They're dark and ominous.

351
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,458
Any that were
related to the book?

352
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:33,833
Think carefully.

353
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,250
A few... In fact,
they struck me

354
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,291
as some sort of warning.

355
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,083
The clock was never
meant to be assembled...

356
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,791
Apparently, the pieces were
originally guarded by Zentopia.

357
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,666
And now here we are...
facing an incomprehensible task

358
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,000
that we must
complete without fail.

359
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,666
So you wanna
know the future?

360
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,125
Is that it?

361
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:57,458
What is most
unsettling to me...

362
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,791
Is the possibility that
the teachings of Zentopia

363
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:03,750
are being twisted, and
used to commit atrocities.

364
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,250
It looks like we were
too late on this one.

365
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,166
We have failed
in our mission.

366
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:14,333
I don't get it...
This is wrong...

367

[GUTMAN] His eminence speaks
the word of the archbishop.

383
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:54,000
His words are sacred!
They are holy law!

So if he says we gotta bust up
a church, we go bust it up!

Don't forget that
we are rewarded whenever

more where that came from.

free to attack churches?

00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:53,250
I didn't kill 'em,
look closer...

472
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,500
They're not even
living creatures.

473
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,375
They're like bricks...
Pieces of earth and wood

474
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:01,041
to build some kind of puppets.

475
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,916
I've never heard of
a magic that can do that.

476
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,083
I don't trust this Zentopia...

477
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,208
Gotta wonder
what they're hiding.

478
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,458
That bunch. They've got secrets.

479
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,500
Some very dark secrets.

480
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,000
I think we've stumbled
onto something

481
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:17,333
far more sinister than
even the master suspected.

482
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:20,583
Sure did... But ol' Macao
was right on the money

483
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,416
sending us to
bust up this party.

484

[MONKS AND NUNS]
Outsiders... Outsiders...

485
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:29,750
We got a lot to do!
So let's get to work!

487

[HAPPY] Is it just me, or
does the Oración Seis seem

488
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:16,208
a heck of a lot stronger
than they were last time?

489
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:17,500
[NATSU] Who knows?
Maybe it's just because

490
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:18,750
they think they're gonna win.

491
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,166
[HAPPY] Yeah, but
that's what we think, too!

492
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,750
We can't both be right!
Somebody's gotta lose!

493
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:24,125
[NATSU] Right! So let's
go kick their butts

494
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:26,875
and put a stop to their
quest for world abomination!

495
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:30,375
[HAPPY] Thank goodness it's
not a vocabulary contest.

[HAPPY and NATSU]
Next time: Anti-Link!

497
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,625
[NATSU] Well it's not, so
we're definitely winning!

498
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,583
[HAPPY] See? That's exactly
what I'm talking about!

499
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:38,333
Both sides think
they're gonna win!

500
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:40,500
[NATSU] What's wrong with that?
Somebody's gotta be right!
