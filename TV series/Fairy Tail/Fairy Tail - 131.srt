01:10:17,333 --> 01:10:19,833
like a real good cover tune.

160
01:10:24,833 --> 01:10:26,333
Oh no!

161
01:10:28,291 --> 01:10:32,708
[Natsu cries out
as he is struck]

162
01:10:35,583 --> 01:10:37,291
I can't believe
this is happening!

163
01:10:37,375 --> 01:10:38,750
He's losing to fire!

164
01:10:38,833 --> 01:10:41,500
You surprised? You shouldn't
be 'cause the more mojo

165
01:10:41,583 --> 01:10:45,041
that goo absorbs the stronger
and stronger that it becomes.

166
01:10:45,125 --> 01:10:48,666
So tell me, do ya get it now,
ya pretty blue kitty cat?

167
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:50,875
Don't give me a weird
nickname, freakazoid!

168
01:10:50,958 --> 01:10:52,625
Run! Natsu!

169
01:10:52,708 --> 01:10:55,791
Yeah. I wish
I could 'lil buddy.

170
01:10:57,083 --> 01:11:03,125
But I don't think this slimy
fire--is gonna let me do that!

171
01:11:03,208 --> 01:11:05,750
Yeah! How you
like that, hot boy?

172
01:11:05,833 --> 01:11:08,708
The fire's burnin'!

173
01:11:08,791 --> 01:11:12,458
Natsu's the name of
my hound dog's latest flame!

174
01:11:12,541 --> 01:11:14,333
Woo hoo!!

175
01:11:14,958 --> 01:11:15,750
[Natsu cries out]

176
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:17,458
Now I'm all shook up!

177
01:11:17,541 --> 01:11:19,625
Yeah!
C'mon, baby!

178
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:21,083
Let's grow!

179
01:11:21,166 --> 01:11:22,958
[Natsu cries out]

180
01:11:28,791 --> 01:11:31,041
You're stronger than
I thought you were.

181
01:11:32,166 --> 01:11:33,916
Same goes for you.

182
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,208
Yeah, crush him!

183
01:11:42,375 --> 01:11:44,291
[JASON] He neutralized
your attack again!

184
01:11:44,375 --> 01:11:46,333
Man, this dude
is freakin' awesome!

185
01:11:46,416 --> 01:11:48,500
So cool!

186
01:11:48,583 --> 01:11:50,666
Stand down.
I won't ask again.

187
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:54,083
Go ahead and make me.
That is, if you think you can.

188
01:11:54,166 --> 01:11:56,166
[BYRO] Very well then.
I'm afraid you

189
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:58,416
leave me with
no other choice.

190
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,166
[battle sounds]

191
01:12:21,208 --> 01:12:24,541
You're really starting to
get on my last nerve, buddy.

192
01:12:24,625 --> 01:12:27,125
[BYRO] I feel the
same about you.

193
01:12:27,208 --> 01:12:30,583
Tell me, what exactly
is your goal here?

194
01:12:30,666 --> 01:12:31,958
Well?

195
01:12:32,041 --> 01:12:34,375
You wanna tell me why
you're destroying our guild?

196
01:12:34,458 --> 01:12:36,583
We're "destroying your guild"?

197
01:12:36,666 --> 01:12:38,541
What nonsense.

198
01:12:39,625 --> 01:12:42,041
[LUCY] Unlike Kain's
Witching Hour Curse magic,

199
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:45,250
hers doesn't require a
strand of the target's hair.

200
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:47,916
[LUCY THINKS] She can only
control one person at a time and

201
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,666
they have to be within a
certain distance from her.

202
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:53,708
So, I'm safe as long as I
stay away but that's easier

203
01:12:53,791 --> 01:12:56,791
said than done
in a situation like this.

204
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:03,333
[COCO] Would you just spill it?
I'm running outta patience!

205
01:13:05,041 --> 01:13:07,208
[COCO]
Tell me where I can find her!

206
01:13:07,291 --> 01:13:09,875
Stop Lily! What do
you think you're doing?

207
01:13:13,666 --> 01:13:15,458
Let me handle this!

208
01:13:16,833 --> 01:13:19,791
Sky Dragon Roar!

209
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:25,916
No! I missed!

210
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,583
She can even outrun
your sky magic?

211
01:13:30,208 --> 01:13:31,541
[SUGARBOY] I'll be
taking any requests you

212
01:13:31,625 --> 01:13:34,500
got to finish you off, hot boy.
Go on and say the word.

213
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:37,750
Natsu!

214
01:13:38,333 --> 01:13:41,833
Happy... Fly me
outta here quick.

215
01:13:42,583 --> 01:13:43,875
What are you
planing to do?

216
01:13:43,958 --> 01:13:46,250
What's it matter?
Just do it, okay?

217
01:13:47,375 --> 01:13:48,708
Aye, sir!

218
01:13:52,208 --> 01:13:53,916
There ain't no gettin'
away from me!

219
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,166
My hound dog's gonna get ya!

220
01:13:56,666 --> 01:13:57,958
Listen, Happy.

221
01:13:58,041 --> 01:13:59,833
I want you to fly
over that slime

222
01:13:59,916 --> 01:14:01,166
and drop me into
the middle of it.

223
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:04,541
Are you out of your mind?
I can't do that to you!

224
01:14:04,625 --> 01:14:07,041
That thing'll drain all
your magic power!

225
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:08,541
Just trust me on this!

226
01:14:08,625 --> 01:14:10,125
[HAPPY] Aye!

227
01:14:12,708 --> 01:14:15,000
[HAPPY] Here ya go!

228
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:18,291
I've had enough of
your stubborn sliminess!

229
01:14:20,541 --> 01:14:22,458
Wow, talk about
a dumb move, hot boy!

230
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,458
Ya know wise men
say only fools rush in!

231
01:14:26,291 --> 01:14:27,750
That's spicy!

232
01:14:28,541 --> 01:14:31,333
[HAPPY] I wish I knew
what you were trying to do.

233
01:14:31,791 --> 01:14:33,500
[HAPPY] That's it!

234
01:14:33,583 --> 01:14:38,833
[Natsu powering  up]

235
01:14:39,416 --> 01:14:41,875
Now that's my little hound dog!
Eat up!

236
01:14:41,958 --> 01:14:44,833
You know you wanna gobble
down of his tasty mojo!

237
01:14:44,916 --> 01:14:48,458
Yeah!
Yummy!

238
01:14:50,875 --> 01:14:53,166
We got double trouble!

239
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:01,458
No! My doggies ate so much

240
01:15:01,541 --> 01:15:04,208
of his witchcraft
they went kablooey!

241
01:15:07,375 --> 01:15:08,708
[SUGARBOY] Get back, jack!

242
01:15:21,291 --> 01:15:23,958
Uh-oh! Looks
like you're stuck!

243
01:15:24,791 --> 01:15:26,250
Let go my hand, man!

244
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:29,375
I'm tellin' ya, if it absorbs
any more of your crazy mojo,

245
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:31,458
it's gonna blow
both of us sky high!

246
01:15:31,541 --> 01:15:32,916
[NATSU] Ya Prob'ly
shoulda thought about that

247
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,541
before you attacked me! If
we blow up it's your fault!

248
01:15:37,541 --> 01:15:39,041
Thinkin' you're gonna
give me and my hound dog

249
01:15:39,125 --> 01:15:42,083
the blues is like dreamin'
the impossible dream, man.

250
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,666
I'm still gonna broil
your arm; watch me!

251
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:48,125
I got my
mojo workin' too!

252
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:55,583
[HAPPY] What are they doing?
This is the weirdest fight ever.

253
01:16:04,875 --> 01:16:06,500
There's no end to this.

254
01:16:06,583 --> 01:16:08,250
Cool!

255
01:16:08,333 --> 01:16:12,583
Your reporter friend just
remembered some sweet info!

256
01:16:12,666 --> 01:16:14,166
[GILDARTS] Huh?

257
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:16,750
[JASON] His name is Byro Cracy!
He's with the Legion Platoon!

258
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:20,625
"The Legion Platoon"?
What in the heck is that?

259
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:25,000
[JASON] Zentopia has followers
not just here in Fiore,

260
01:16:25,083 --> 01:16:26,333
but all over the world.

261
01:16:26,416 --> 01:16:28,791
Not much is known about
the Legion Platoon except

262
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:31,875
that it's a combat unit tied
to the church's dark past.

263
01:16:31,958 --> 01:16:33,833
I've heard it's comprised
of fierce warriors who've

264
01:16:33,916 --> 01:16:36,375
undergone training most
priests can't even endure!

265
01:16:42,583 --> 01:16:44,916
[GILDARTS] So what does
this mysterious combat unit

266
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,500
want with the Fairy Tail guild?

267
01:16:47,583 --> 01:16:50,500
[BYRO] That's none
of your business.

268
01:16:50,583 --> 01:16:52,375
[GILDARTS] Really?

269
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:58,375
[GILDARTS] When
somebody attacks my guild

270
01:16:58,458 --> 01:17:00,791
it's definitely my business!

271
01:17:02,375 --> 01:17:03,916
Honestly, I'm not
too worried because

272
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,125
Fairy Tail won't
be defeated easily.

273
01:17:07,041 --> 01:17:10,250
However....

274
01:17:10,333 --> 01:17:13,083
I'm not takin'
any chances.

275
01:17:14,666 --> 01:17:17,708
Because one of the guild's
members is my daughter.

276
01:17:18,041 --> 01:17:19,666
[BYRO] Oh?
Don't worry.

277
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:21,875
We don't mean any
harm to your daughter.

278
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:24,500
We want Lucy Heartfilia.

279
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:26,791
[GILDARTS] What do
you want with her?

280
01:17:31,916 --> 01:17:35,708
[BYRO] My, suddenly there's a
serious look in your eyes.

281
01:17:35,791 --> 01:17:38,958
[BYRO] This is very
serious to us as well.

282
01:17:39,041 --> 01:17:41,500
We have been ordered
to complete a task.

283
01:17:41,583 --> 01:17:44,833
Given to us by the
Archbishop of Zentopia.

284
01:17:44,916 --> 01:17:47,250
This is "Holy war."

285
01:17:47,333 --> 01:17:49,291
 "Holy war"?

286
01:17:49,375 --> 01:17:54,250
Yes. This war
will change everything.

287
01:17:54,333 --> 01:17:57,708
There is no stopping us.

288
01:17:59,833 --> 01:18:01,125
Run, kid!

289
01:18:02,166 --> 01:18:04,000
I suggest you
do what I say right now

290
01:18:04,083 --> 01:18:05,916
unless you wanna
die in the field!

291
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,333
So run!

292
01:18:11,625 --> 01:18:12,916
Well?

293
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:23,375
I totes found ya!

294
01:18:25,708 --> 01:18:28,375
Geez. That took longer
than I thought it would.

295
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:30,250
I guess if we had known
what you actually look like,

296
01:18:30,333 --> 01:18:32,708
it would have been totes easy.

297
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,250
Wake up!
Michelle!

298
01:18:35,333 --> 01:18:37,416
I need help!

299
01:18:39,208 --> 01:18:40,958
Got ya now!

300
01:18:41,041 --> 01:18:44,208
What're you waitin' for?
Seriously, like, get over here!

301
01:19:00,375 --> 01:19:03,708
Tell me, why are you
and your pals after Lucy?

302
01:19:04,708 --> 01:19:06,916
Strictly speaking,
we don't have any

303
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,541
business with the girl herself.

304
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:12,833
She has something
that we want.

305
01:19:18,333 --> 01:19:20,250
[NATSU] Just lemme
hit you dang it!

306
01:19:20,333 --> 01:19:21,541
C'mere!

307
01:19:21,625 --> 01:19:22,666
That's enough.

308
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:23,916
This has been fun
but you need to

309
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,125
get your hand outta mine.

310
01:19:25,208 --> 01:19:26,708
I don't mean to
be cruel or anything

311
01:19:26,791 --> 01:19:28,541
but this is kinda weird.

312
01:19:28,625 --> 01:19:29,791
Ya see I just
don't wanna be

313
01:19:29,875 --> 01:19:31,583
some other's guy's teddy bear.

314
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:33,708
I ain't holdin' your hand
'cause I want to, bonehead!

315
01:19:33,791 --> 01:19:35,583
If you're gonna be a
hard headed woman about this

316
01:19:35,666 --> 01:19:38,291
I'll just have to beat the
snot outta you til you let go!

317
01:19:40,583 --> 01:19:41,833
[SUGARBOY] Ya like that?

318
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:47,958
That should do the trick.
Now, flip, flop, and fly.

319
01:19:48,458 --> 01:19:50,708
[GRAY] Ice Cannon!

320
01:19:53,833 --> 01:19:55,791
Geez, Gray!
What's the big idea?

321
01:19:55,875 --> 01:19:57,750
You nearly broke my arm, y'know!

322
01:19:57,833 --> 01:20:00,458
[GRAY] I saved your
hide so quit complainin'.

323
01:20:00,541 --> 01:20:03,458
You should be
thankin' me, flamebrain.

324
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:07,250
No, it can't be.

325
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:17,750
[SUGARBOY] I'll call you
"ice boy". That's spicy!

326
01:20:17,833 --> 01:20:19,958
[GRAY] I'm not answerin'
to some weird nickname!

327
01:20:20,041 --> 01:20:22,333
What the heck are
you doing here anyway?

328
01:20:22,416 --> 01:20:23,791
It's not what you think, Gray!

329
01:20:23,875 --> 01:20:26,708
This isn't the guy we met;
this is Earth Land Sugarboy!

330
01:20:26,791 --> 01:20:27,958
[GRAY] Huh?

331
01:20:30,791 --> 01:20:33,291
There ya go!
Keep movin'!

332
01:20:41,208 --> 01:20:43,500
[LUCY] Don't tell me this
is what you're after?

333
01:20:44,875 --> 01:20:46,875
Yep. That's all.

334
01:20:46,958 --> 01:20:49,750
Hand it over and
I won't hurt ya.

335

[GILDARTS] Erza.

336
01:21:16,541 --> 01:21:17,666
[ERZA] It's rare to
see you struggle

337
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:19,166
in battle like this, Gildarts.

338
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:21,708
[GILDARTS] That's true,
but it's not every day

339
01:21:21,791 --> 01:21:24,375
I'm faced with
a giant octopus.

340
01:21:24,458 --> 01:21:26,333
If this man and his
pet were a part of the attack

341
01:21:26,416 --> 01:21:29,375
on our guild, justice
needs to be served.

342
01:21:30,333 --> 01:21:32,041
Don't I know it.

343
01:21:36,708 --> 01:21:39,250
Wow, you're, like, so naïve.
Did you seriously think we

344
01:21:39,333 --> 01:21:41,666
were after you 'cause
you're so totes wrong!

345
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:42,916
Please stop this!

346
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,500
It's too late now!

347
01:21:44,583 --> 01:21:47,083
This was my father's memento
and he left it to me!

348
01:21:47,166 --> 01:21:49,208
There's no way that
I'll ever let you have it!

349
01:21:49,291 --> 01:21:51,333
That just makes
it more fun for me!

350
01:21:51,416 --> 01:21:54,416
I'm totes into stealing stuff
that's important to others!

351
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:56,125
I love it!

352
01:21:56,208 --> 01:21:58,625
No don't!
Please stop!

353
01:21:58,708 --> 01:22:01,458
Michelle!
You've gotta wake up!

354
01:22:09,208 --> 01:22:12,375
Sweet!
This is so awesome!

355
01:22:12,458 --> 01:22:14,708
The Archbishop's gonna freak!

356
01:22:22,625 --> 01:22:23,791
[COCO] That's the sign!

357
01:22:26,416 --> 01:22:27,791
[ERZA] A signal flare.

358
01:22:28,375 --> 01:22:31,500
It seems we've obtained
the clock hand.

359
01:22:31,583 --> 01:22:33,416
What's that mean?

360
01:22:36,708 --> 01:22:38,208
Hot dog.

361
01:22:39,708 --> 01:22:40,833
Lucy.

[NATSU]
Those jerks better watch out!

364
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:19,958
They think they pulled
a fast one on us but

365
01:24:20,041 --> 01:24:21,583
Fairy Tail's gonna make 'em pay!

366
01:24:21,666 --> 01:24:23,291
[HAPPY] They didn't want
anything to do with Lucy!

367
01:24:23,375 --> 01:24:25,541
They were after that
clock hand the whole time!

368
01:24:25,625 --> 01:24:26,750
But why?

369
01:24:26,833 --> 01:24:28,208
[NATSU] Ha!
I think it's pretty obvious that

370
01:24:28,291 --> 01:24:29,666
they're serious
clock collectors.

371
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:32,083
I mean, who else would
go chasin' after a clock hand?

372
01:24:32,166 --> 01:24:34,500
[HAPPY] I really doubt
that's the case.

373
01:24:34,583 --> 01:24:37,041
[HAPPY AND NATSU] Next time:
Key of the Starry Heavens!

374
01:24:37,125 --> 01:24:39,958
If they're not collectors,
then maybe they're fetishists?

375
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:41,541
[HAPPY] Yeah!

376
01:24:41,625 --> 01:24:43,291
It's their burning, passion for
clocks that's driven them to--

377
01:24:43,375 --> 01:24:45,541
Just kidding, that's so stupid!
