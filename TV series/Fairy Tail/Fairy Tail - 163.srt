hired by Raven Tail to

159
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,541
[MIRAJANE] I much
prefer taking a more

160
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,666
peaceful approach
if it's possible.

161
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,875
[CHAPATI]
Two bodacious babes who are

162
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,375
both masters of
transformation magic?

163
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,708
This is truly the stuff
that dreams are made of!

164
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,166
Somebody pinch me!

165
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,625
Again I'm joined
by a real ladies'

166
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,416
man himself, Mr. Yajima!

167
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,208
And our cool guest,
Jason, has shot

168
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,125
dozens of centerfolds
for Sorcerer Weekly!

169
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,666
I'm really feeling
like a young man today!

170
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,000
This has gotta be the
coolest thing I've ever done!

171
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,833
I can't wait to see what
they'll change into next!

172
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,125
[LISLIE] Not so fast!

173
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,708
You don't expect
us to just let these

174
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,583
bubble-headed bimbos
hog all the attention?

175
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,291
[ARAÑA] We have strong
and beautiful chicas as well!

176
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,541
[ALL]
Team Mermaid Heel is

177
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,458
the ultimate in girl power!

178
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,125
[BETH] This is embarrassin'.

179
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,208
Well I definitely did
not see this one coming!

180
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,166
Mermaid Heel has
joined the party!

181
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,875
Even Lislie's ditched
the junk in the trunk

182
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,208
and brought the va-va-voom!

183
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,041
[SHERRY] Hold it!

184
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,041
All these girls are missing
the most important thing!

185
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,666
What good is skanking
around in your little

186
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,666
swimsuits if you don't
have the love to back it up!

187
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,458
If you want love,
then you gotta give love!

188
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,750
And we're both bustin'
at the seams with it!

189
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,583
And now the cute cousins
from the Lamia scale

190
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,833
guild have thrown their
bodies into the arena!

191
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:37,833
Wow.

192
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,208
That takes guts, I guess.

193
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,708
Why are you ladies just
watching from the sidelines?

194
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,125
What do you mean by that?

195
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,958
Do you think we should
go down there?

196
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,750
Are we supposed to just
always have a swimsuit handy?

197
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,791
No silly! But you
never know what

198
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,833
might happen, so you
should be ready for anything!

199
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,000
I have one for all of you!

200
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,375
[MAKAROV]
Pay close attention boys.

201
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,416
This is why we must
never, but never question

202
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,291
the infinite wisdom
of our first master.

203
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,583
Yeah, she really
seems to know

204
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,583
how to have a good
time, that's for sure.

205
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:05,750
You shouldn't
just stand here

206
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,500
like a bunch of party poopers!

207
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,583
Let's all go
down there together!

208
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:10,833
For real?

209
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,625
There's no reason that
we should stand idly by 

210
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,166
while all our competitors
are taking the spotlight.

211
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,583
[LUCY AND WENDY] Huh?

212
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,708
[JUVIA] Since my body is
made of water. I can fill out

213
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,333
a bathing suit better than
any of these other girls.

214
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,625
[GAJEEL] Oh.
You're gonna do it too?

215
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,125
A woman must
do whatever

216
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,916
she can to fight
for her true love!

217
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,583
Well good luck with that.

218
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:34,750
This situation has gotten

219
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,750
pretty out of hand
wouldn't you say?

220
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,291
Oh yeah, but
it's all in good fun,

221
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,708
and the fans are
totally eating it up.

222
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,250
If you wanted a heaping
helping of fan service.

223
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,083
Then ladies and gentlemen,
Domus Flau is most

224
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,666
definitely the place you'd
wanna find yourself today!

225
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,166
And unless we want
an actual riot on our hands,

226
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,875
we have no choice but to
let this madness continue.

227
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,416
This is amazing.
Oh man!

228
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,458
The Sorcerer Weekly cover story!

229
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:01,083
I'll call it the Big Battle of
the Busty Bathing Bombshells!

230
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,041
It's so hot and cool!

231
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,250
[CHAPATI] But remember folks.

232
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,541
this is still a strictly
one-on-one affair so

233
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,166
Mirajane and Jenny will
be the only ones scoring!

234
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,541
Then why in
the heck are we

235
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,208
all down here
demeaning ourselves?

236
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,541
[MAVIS] Come on!

237
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,375
Lighten up, this is a
nice break from fighting.

238
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,291
Don't take this the wrong
way, but I just don't really

239
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,666
understand why a
ghost would be so into this!

240
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,250
Well, it makes total
sense coming from the

241
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,125
person who started this crazy
guild in the first place.

242
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,250
Ya know?

243
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,250
Is there a reason you're
standing so close?

244
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,083
As the rightful
queen of the fairies,

245
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,083
I simply can't be upstaged.

246
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,041
Wardrobe change!
School swimsuits!

247
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,625
This is starting to get
a little too creepy for me!

248
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,041
Wendy doesn't seem to
be that out of place in hers.

249
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,666
I feel out of place!

250
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,375
And now...
Bikinis and thigh highs!

251
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,666
That's weird.

252
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,833
It covers more skin,
but it's more embarrassing.

253
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,083
Who likes girls in glasses?

254
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:53,125
This is pretty much
the look I roll with every day.

255
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,000
[CHAPATI] Cat ears!

256
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:58,166
I feel absolutely
ridiculous in these.

257
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,291
[CHAPATI] Bondage gear!

258
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,333
Sometimes love
has to hurt a bit.

259
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,041
You're scaring me!

260
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:07,125
So "Titania!", Have you accepted
your place beneath me yet?

261
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,791
[ERZA] You dare speak to me?

262
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,583
[EVERGREEN] Sorry, ma'am!

263
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:13,791
Do you suppose
they're gonna make us

264
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,166
go down there and do
this in the next round?

265
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,166
Nah...

266
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,583
No way in hell.

267
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,791
How about a blushing
bride challenge?

268
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,791
So ladies, grab a
lucky guy and squeeze

269
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,625
into some wedding dresses!

270
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,125
I appreciate the help, master.

271
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,666
Thank you!

272
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,916
I will do whatever it takes
to secure a win for my guild.

273
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,291
Well you're not such
a bad match, are you?

274
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,708
Who knows, we
might be a whole

275
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,791
lot more compatible
than you think.

276
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,291
Not so fast there, buddy!

277
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,291
Levy is never gonna marry you!

278
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,041
[JET] Ya think she
wants you instead?

279
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,750
How come you're not
pairing up with anybody?

280
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,500
[GAJEEL] This is stupid.

281
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,666
I'm just gonna
take a nap instead.

282
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,125
[ROMEO] Why are you guys hiding?

283
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,500
[MACAO] Uh. I ain't
makin' that mistake again.

284
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,083
[WAKABA] And I'm afraid
my wife will see me.

285
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:12,750
[HAPPY]
How about you let me be

286
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,958
your partner
for this one, Carla?

287
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,375
[CARLA] Well, I suppose
it makes sense,

288
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:17,958
since we're both Exceeds.

289
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,041
My darling.

290
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,250
You and I are
meant to be together.

291
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,416
[JUVIA] Sorry.

292
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
But my heart belongs to another.

293
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:25,583
[GRAY] Hands off!

294
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:26,458
[JUVIA] Oh Gray!

295
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:27,458
She's not in your guild!

296
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,083
When the heck
are you gonna get

297
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,958
that through your
stupid spiky head!

298
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,583
[JUVIA] How bold!
Let's cuddle!

299
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,250
[SHERRY] I'm glad we can
finally show the world our love!

300
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,208
[REN] You're bein'
way too clingy.

301
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:41,125
And it's making me
fall for you even more.

302
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,958
So who's with me?

303
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,041
Hi!

304
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:45,875
Hey.

305
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,166
I've got a question for you.

306
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,875
Will you marry me?

307
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,250
[LISANNA] Hey!
Natsu!

308
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,166
[NATSU] Wow.
You look really nice.

309
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:57,791
[LISANNA] So do you.

310
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,958
Wait!
What the heck?

311
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,875
Remember when
we were kids.

312
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,833
We used to play
husband and wife.

313
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,750
[NATSU] Why did you do that?

314
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,416
[LUCY] Whoops, sorry!

315
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,291
[NATSU]
Get off, you're crushing me!

316
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,791
Now that the wedding is over,

317
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,458
let's get back to
another swimsuit round!

318
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,416
[OHBA] Stop!
This is an outrage!

319
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,291
I can't take any more of this!

320
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,791
[CHAPATI] What is this?

321
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:32,083
You foolish young people!
Let Ohba teach you a lesson!

322
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,208
So pay close
attention and learn

323
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,958
what it means
to be a real woman!

324
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,416
[CHAPATI] And with that
crash course in reality.

325
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,208
The mood in the arena has
been brought down to Earthland.

326
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,625
Party's over folks.

327
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,375
The other teams on the
field have begun to clear out.

328
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,083
[JASON] Cool. Down.

329
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,833
The circus is gone, and
it's just you and me again.

330
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:11,291
Aw, that's too bad.
It was fun while it lasted.

331
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,041
[CHAPATI] We need to wrap
this thing up, so let's move

332
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:17,083
on to the final round
of this exhilarating match!

333
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,208
[JENNY] Yes!

334
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,500
Sorry, Mirajane. But no matter
what the judges want us to do,

335
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,666
I have an air-tight
strategy for victory.

336
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,750
It all comes
down to this!

337
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,541
And I'm not gonna lose!

338
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:30,541
Why don't we
make things more

339
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,583
interesting and
have our own bet.

340
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,791
After all, everybody
else is doing it.

341
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,375
I'm game, so what
do you have in mind?

342
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:41,166
The loser will pose
for Sorcerer Weekly

343
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,041
wearing absolutely
nothing but her birthday suit.

344
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:46,875
That's crazy.

345
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:47,958
Sorry.

346
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,458
But I'm a little conflicted.

347
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,875
Who do I cheer for?

348
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,958
Don't know.
It's hard.

349
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:55,541
[MIRAJANE] You're on.

350
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:56,666
[CROWD]
Wha?

351
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,041
Unbelievable!

352
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,083
This might just be a bet
where everybody is a winner!

353
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,541
[JENNY THINKS]
She took the bait!

354
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,875
Mirajane has been the
apple of the public's eye

355
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,833
for a long time now,
so she may have

356
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,000
more fans in the
crowd than I do.

357
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,416
[JENNY] But those
judges up there are

358
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,416
the ones handing
out the scores.

359
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,166
[JENNY] So I did
a little digging to find

360
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,125
out what really turns them on.

361
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,791
And it seems like
they're into younger girls.

362
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,958
Which is perfect for me!

363
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,333
Mira may have been around
before I was, but she hasn't

364
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:28,375
aged in seven years, so now
she's actually the younger one.

365
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,708
[JENNY] And as an added
bonus a hot model coming

366
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,750
out of retirement, looking
exactly the same, and finally

367
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:37,916
getting naked will sell a ton of
magazines for Sorcerer Weekly.

368
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,166
It's obvious who they'll choose.

369
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,208
[CHAPATI] Now.
Our final theme will be.

370
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,708
Combat Gear!

371
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,125
[JENNY] So sorry
for being naughty,

372
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,750
but there is no way
I'm gonna lose this one.

373
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,541
It's just too perfect!

374
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,208
You really think you can
handle my combat form?

375
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,500
Yeah, I'm not
too worried about it.

376
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,708
And since we're making a bet
like everybody before us has.

377
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,833
[MIRAJANE] Why don't
we continue another trend,

378
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,333
and finish out this round with a

379
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,833
battle of strength
like they all did, too.

380
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:10,958
[JENNY] Uh.

381
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,666
What in the heck is that?

382
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,500
It's one of Mirajane's
She-Devil forms.

383
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,500
It is known as Sitri.

384
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,541
Her ultimate Satan Soul.

385
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,500
[MIRAJANE] I agreed to
the terms that you set.

386
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,125
So I'd appreciate it
if you would be a

387
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,375
good sport and agree to mine.

388
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,333
Wait, are you serious?

389
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,666
[MIRAJANE] Yes.

390
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:53,041
[CHAPATI] And like that, this
beauty battle becomes a brawl!

391
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:56,333
[YAJIMA] I suppose this
is more keeping with tradition.

392
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,791
[JASON] What a cute brute!

393
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,666
So cool!

394
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,416
[CHAPATI]
And Mirajane takes the big W!

395
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,333
Yay!

396
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:04,541
Way to go, Mira!

397
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:05,791
I'm okay with it!

398
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,833
Definitely a win-win!

399
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,083
am so ready for
next week's issue!

400
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,750
And that's how we do
things in the Fairy Tail guild!

401
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,250
But wasn't this supposed
to be a beauty contest?

402
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,208
Most of it was, anyway.

403
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,416
And no one ever said
they couldn't fight.

404
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,958
Mirajane just found a
way to bend the rules.

405
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,458
That seems to happen
quite a bit with this guild.

406
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,083
You said it, Wendy.

407
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,625
Sorry 'bout that.

408
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,541
But if this will make
you feel any better.

409
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,791
I'll buy an issue
when it comes out.

410
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,500
[CHAPATI]
That bold move nets another

411
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,000
ten points for Fairy Tail B!

412
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,541
Didn't know she had it in her.

413
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,083
Yeah, she's brutal.

414
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,458
That's why you always wanna
stay on her good side.

415
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,458
Understood.

416
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,375
Wow, that was
amazing. Nicely done!

417
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,166
Thanks you guys,
but that whole experience

418
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,791
was more than
a little embarrassing.

419
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,125
[GAJEEL] Yeah?

420
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,208
Well, I bet that last part
felt pretty damn good.

421
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,375
And now we're sitting
at twelve points.

422
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,041
Which ties us up
with Natsu's team.

423
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,875
[MIRAJANE] Is there
something wrong, Mystogan?

424
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,625
[JELLAL] No.

425
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,916
Give him a break,
isn't he supposed

426
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,625
to be the strong
and silent type?

427
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,333
[MIRAJANE] Yeah, you're right!

428
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,666
[JELLAL THINKS] The second day
is about to come to a close.

429
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,375
But there're still no answers.

430
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,333
[DARTON] Colonel Arcadios!

431
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,833
[ARCADIOS] Defense Minister
Darton, can I be of service?

432
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,333
[DARTON] You have got
some explaining to do!

433
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,708
[ARCADIOS]
Whatever do you mean?

434
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,041
Don't play dumb!

435
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,166
I want you to tell
me why the hell

436
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,625
you're trying
to get your hands

437
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,000
on a celestial wizard right now!

438
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,916
Don't you think you're
jumping the gun?

439
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,041
We need to have a trial run to

440
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,416
ensure everything is in order.

441
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,416
[DARTON]
But now is not the time!

442
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,458
We are not ready for that!

443
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:50,833
[ARCADIOS]
With all due respect sir,

444
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,208
I think you should
keep your voice down.

445
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,750
And truth be told, it has
been ready for some time.

446
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,791
[DARTON] You kept this from me?

447
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,791
[ARCADIOS] Don't be
offended, I kept it from

448
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,208
everyone in order
to shore up funding.

449
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,541
But once we are able to
secure a celestial wizard,

450
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,958
the Eclipse project will,
in fact, be fully operational.

451
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,333
[DARTON] That's ridiculous!

452
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,208
Do you expect me
to believe you've completed

453
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,958
a project of this
magnitude in seven years?

454
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,458
Whether you believe it or not,

455
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:22,166
the project is moving
on to Phase 4, Plan B.

456
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,458
Which means I will be obtaining

457
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:26,916
a celestial wizard if
I have to do it myself.

458
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,125
[ARCADIOS] I am aware
of your position on the matter.

459
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:33,416
Your opposition to Eclipse
has been well documented.

460
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:37,541
But at this point in time
there is no turning back.

461
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,583
Are you some kind of monster?

462
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:43,083
I can become one.
If it is necessary.

463
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,958
[ARCADIOS] I will
do whatever is required

464
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,250
to serve my king and country.

465
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,000
[ARCADIOS]
What lies beyond this door

466
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,083
will change the world forever.

467
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,416
If the key to open it is the

468
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,958
life of a young girl,
then so be it.

469
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,083
[CHAPATI] After an exciting
day, the final match of

470
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,750
day two of the Grand Magic Games

471
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,500
is about to take place!

472
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:03,916
[CHAPATI]
This one will test the skills

473
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,375
of Mermaid Heel's
Kagura Mikazuchi.

474
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:09,416
Against Sabertooth's
Yukino Aguria!

475
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,166
Once more we're treated to

476
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,083
two lovely ladies
going head to head!

477
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,166
Who do you think is
gonna win this one?

478
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,875
Are you really that
big of an idiot?

479
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:21,166
Obviously, Yukino is gonna
wipe the floor with this chick!

480
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,541
Then let's cheer her on!

481
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,541
We really gotta score
some points on this one,

482
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:29,375
since somebody screwed the
pooch on the Chariot game.

483
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,583
[YUKINO] I know.

484
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,541
But Sting is not
to blame for that.

485
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,666
The fact that the game involved
vehicles was unfortunate.

486
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,583
We can't change that now.

487
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,791
I just hope you
know what you gotta do.

488
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,541
We're counting on you.

489
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:42,708
Yes.

490
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,833
I will not tarnish
the name Sabertooth.

491
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,708
And I will achieve
victory without fail.

492
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,708
Do your best
out there, Kagura!

493
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,500
Go and fetch us a win!

494
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,041
Sabertooth isn't
the top ranked guild

495
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,833
for nothin' so
it's gonna be tough.

496
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,458
She would never let us down.

497
00:20:58,541 --> 00:20:59,791
[KAGURA] Do not fear.

498
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:04,250
I see the path that
my sword must travel.

499
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:07,750
Something tells me that this
won't be another beauty contest.

500
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,375
[CHAPATI]
Well, personally, if they want

501
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,500
another one,
then I am all for it!

502
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,916
Come on you guys,
these chicks are way

503
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,291
too cool for something
that cheesy!

504
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,375
What's gonna happen?

505
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,833
Pay close attention.

506
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,333
Sabertooth is the
guild to beat this year.

507
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,500
You're right.

508
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,791
[CHAPATI] Kagura has made
quite a name for herself.

509
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,750
Not only is she considered
the strongest member

510
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,958
of Team Mermaid Heel,
she also was recently

511
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:37,333
named the top female
wizard by Sorcerer Weekly.

512
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,583
[CHAPATI] On the other hand,

513
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,458
not much is known about
her opponent, Yukino.

514
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,208
However, the simple
fact that she has been

515
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,708
chosen to represent the mighty
Sabertooth in the games,

516
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:45,875
would lead us to believe that

517
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,875
she will be a force
to be reckoned with!

518
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,666
[CHAPATI] The gong
has been struck!

519
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,458
Let the battle begin!

520
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,416
It is an honor to
cross swords with you.

521
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,000
For me as well.

522
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,500
[YUKINO]
So, shall we do as the others

523
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,666
before us and make a wager?

524
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,083
[KAGURA]
Silly bets do not interest me.

525
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,541
Is it because
you are afraid of losing?

526
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,666
[KAGURA] You're mistaken
if you believe that.

527
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,375
I fear no such thing.

528
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:12,958
But when I enter
into an agreement

529
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,666
I guarantee it will
be enacted without fail.

530
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,583
[KAGURA] Therefore, I never
gamble for entertainment.

531
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:19,750
Nor do I.

532
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,500
So let's raise the stakes.

533
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:25,125
Let's wager, our lives.

534
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:42,083
♪

535
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:13,583
[HAPPY] It looks like we've got

536
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:15,083
another girl-fight on our hands.

537
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:16,666
[NATSU] Ya think they'll
bust out the swimsuits?

538
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,291
[HAPPY] The audience
would probably love that,

539
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,666
but I really don't think
that's gonna happen.

540
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,625
[NATSU] They're not
the beauty queen types.

541
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:25,000
[HAPPY]
Yeah, they're super serious.

542
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:27,583
I get the feeling they're
both pretty into fighting.

543
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,541
[NATSU] So not so much
fan service next time, huh?

544
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:33,750
[HAPPY AND NATSU] 
Next Time: Kagura vs. Yukino!

545
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,541
They said they're
gonna bet their lives,

546
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:37,875
do you think they'll go through
with it if one of them loses?

547
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:39,791
[NATSU] Nah, they'll
probably just get nekkid!

548
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:41,458
[HAPPY] Why would
you even think that?
