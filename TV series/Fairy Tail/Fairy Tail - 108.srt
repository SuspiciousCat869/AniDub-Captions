1
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:24,875
- COME FORTH
HUNTER OF BELPARASO, SAMAGUI!

2
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:31,750
- Caprico:
ELIMINATE LAYLA'S DAUGHTER.

3
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,000
- ( theme music playing )

4
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:50,041
- ( singing in Japanese )

5
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,708
- SAMAGUI OF BELPARASO?

6
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,625
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!

7
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,125
I KNOW WHO THAT IS,

8
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,041
HE'S A REAL-LIFE,
LEGENDARY HUNTER.

9
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:14,458
THERE ARE EVEN CHILDREN'S BOOKS
ABOUT HIM.

10
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:20,458
- Happy: ...

11
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,625
- WIND, GOOD.

12
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:26,458
ANKLE, GOOD.

13
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,416
- WHAT KIND OF HUNTER
SHOOTS PEOPLE?

14
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,458
HE CAN AIM UPSIDE DOWN?

15
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:42,041
- I HUNT WHATEVER
MY MASTER ORDERS.

16
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:45,166
BE IT ANIMAL OR MAN,
MY ARROWS WILL STRIKE IT.

17
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,375
- NOT IF I STOP THEM.

18
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,458
WHAT THE HELL?

19
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,750
A CURVED SHOT?

20
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,375
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

21
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,708
- INDEED, THAT'S PRECISELY
WHY I DECIDED

22
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,375
TO ENSLAVE HIM.

23
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,166
HE'S AN EXCELLENT SNIPER.

24
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,125
I HAVE NO DOUBT THOSE ARROWS
WILL STRIKE HIS INTENDED TARGET.

25
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,958
- I DON'T THINK SO.

26
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:07,833
- DID YOU SEE THAT?

27
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,083
HE DEFLECTED MY SHOT
WITH DEBRIS.

28
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:14,333
- WHILE I WILL ADMIT
SAMAGUI IS AN EXCELLENT ARCHER,

29
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:17,125
I'M AFRAID HE'S NOTHING
COMPARED TO SAGITTARIUS.

30
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,166
- GO!  FIND THE GIRL
AND ELIMINATE HER AT ONCE!

31
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,625
- OF COURSE, SIR.  A HUNTER
NEVER LETS HIS PREY ESCAPE.

32
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,333
- HER NAME'S LUCY.

33
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:26,666
DO YOU HAVE TO KEEP CALLING HER
"GIRL" OR "PREY?"

34
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,541
I MEAN, DON'T YOU THINK
THAT'S KIND OF INSULTING?

35
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,791
- YOU WILL LET ME PASS.

36
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:34,708
- NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

37
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,125
- GET OUT OF THE WAY!

38
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,708
- I'M NOT MOVING
UNTIL YOU START TALKING.

39
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:53,125
CRUX SAID 20 YEARS AGO
YOU FORMED A CELESTIAL SPIRIT

40
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:56,000
CONTRACT WITH LAYLA.
NOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND

41
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,708
OF AGREEMENT YOU MADE
IN THE HUMAN WORLD,

42
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,750
BUT IF THAT'S TRUE THEN THERE'S
ONE THING I DO KNOW--

43
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,041
SINCE LAYLA'S NO LONGER WITH US,

44
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,416
YOU SHOULD BE FIGHTING 
FOR HER DAUGHTER, LUCY.

45
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,625
AT LEAST ACCORDING
TO YOUR CONTRACT.

46
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:10,083
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SHE
DOESN'T SEEM TO KNOW

47
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,625
ANYTHING ABOUT YOU.

48
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,958
SO, YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED, CAPRICORN?

49
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:19,291
- A TABOO.

50
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:23,500
EVERY MAGIC IN EXISTENCE
HAS ITS OWN SET OF RULES

51
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,958
THAT MUST NEVER BE BROKEN.

52
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:28,250
AND I BROKE ONE OF 
THOSE SACRED RULES.

53
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,791
- YOU DID?

54
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,708
- AS A RESULT,
I WAS GIVEN THIS FORM.

55
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,541
NOW I'M A GOAT,
ISN'T THAT FUNNY?

56
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,500
- ( laughing )

57
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,958
- Narrator: MEANWHILE,
AFTER PICKING UP THE PRESENCE,

58
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,458
OR RATHER THE SCENT,
OF AN OLD FOE

59
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:47,666
NATSU THE SNIFFING SLEUTH,
AND HIS LITTLE BUDDY HAPPY

60
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,250
ARE NOW IN HOT PURSUIT.

61
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,958
- HE MUST HAVE GONE THIS WAY.
I'M TELLING YOU, I SMELL HIM.

62
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,250
- WOULD YOU PLEASE SLOW DOWN?
YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL

63
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,083
'CAUSE THE TERRAIN HERE
IS SUPER RUGGED.

64
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,125
TOLD YOU.

65
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:02,041
NATSU!

66
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,000
- ( screaming )

67
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:07,541
- NO, THIS SUCKS!
MAKE IT STOP!

68
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:08,791
I'M GOING TO PUKE.

69
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,375
- THAT'S WEIRD,

70
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:14,250
I WONDER WHY HE WENT QUIET?

71
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,208
EVEN SLEDDING ON A LEAF
MAKES HIM SICK.

72
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,583
- THAT DIDN'T HURT ONE BIT.

73
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,583
IT'S HIM.

74
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,916
- Happy:
NATSU!

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,791
WATCH OUT BELOW YOU!

76
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:38,708
- WHAT THE--

77
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,416
- THERE WAS A SPROUTING SEED

78
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,833
HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN THE SOIL
BENEATH YOU.

79
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,833
THE ARC OF TIME GUIDED IT
INTO THE FUTURE

80
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,291
TO BECOME THIS TREE.

81
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,833
WHERE DO YOU THINK YOUR FUTURE
WILL GUIDE YOU?

82
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,833
I WONDER.
WELL, NATSU DRAGNEEL?

83
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,875
- SO YOU'RE THE CREEP
FROM BEFORE.

84
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:07,041
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT,
I NEVER FORGET A SMELL.

85
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:14,541
- THE GUY WHO USED
LYON'S GROUP ON GALUNA ISLAND?

86
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,833
- SINCE WHEN DID YOU START
DRESSING LIKE A GIRL?

87
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:19,458
- WHOA, YOU'RE A CROSS DRESSER?

88
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:22,041
- NO, ACTUALLY THIS IS
MY REAL FORM.

89
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,833
I'M A MEMBER
OF THE GRIMOIRE HEART GUILD.

90
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,625
AND LEADER OF THE SEVEN KIN.

91
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,000
YOU MAY CALL ME,
ULTEAR MILKOVICH.

92
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:32,166
- Natsu:
ULTIMATE MILK SANDWICH?

93
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,916
- Happy:
NOPE, NOT EVEN CLOSE.

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,250
- Ultear:
DON'T TELL ME YOUR GUILD

95
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,958
HAS SENT YOU AFTER ZEREF
AS WELL?

96
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,791
- Both: HUH?!

97
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,666
- Natsu:
YOU MEAN THAT CRYBABY IS ZEREF?

98
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,125
THE SAME GUY WHO CREATED
LULLABY, DELIORA,

99
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,875
AND OTHER BAD STUFF?
FOR REAL?

100
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:54,666
- HE CAN'T BE, NO WAY!
ZEREF LIVED A LONG TIME AGO.

101
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,708
- JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I WON'T LET YOU HAVE HIM.

102
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,166
THE BLACK WIZARD ZEREF
BELONGS ONLY TO ME.

103
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,916
- FINE, I DON'T WANT HIM!

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,916
I JUST WANT TO GET MY HANDS
ON YOUR GUILD!

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,083
IT'S PAYBACK TIME
FOR HURTING MY FRIENDS!

106
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,541
- OH?  WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE

107
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,333
THEN I DO BELIEVE
I OWE YOU ONE.

108
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:14,458
AND THIS TIME
I MEAN BUSINESS.

109
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:17,708
- Narrator:
ERZA AND JUVIA,

110
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,375
WHO HAD SET OUT
TO FIND THEIR COMRADES

111
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,333
UPON LEARNING
OF THE ENEMY INVASION,

112
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,000
FOUND THEMSELVES UP AGAINST
A DECEPTIVE FOE.

113
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:28,708
- JUVIA LOXAR, FORMERLY
OF PHANTOM LORD'S ELEMENT FOUR.

114
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:32,000
ALONG WITH ERZA SCARLET,
KNOWN AS TITANIA.

115
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,916
- WELL, YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY 
DONE YOUR RESEARCH ON US.

116
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,291
AND WHO MIGHT YOU BE?

117
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,000
- WHO ARE YOU
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT?

118
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,458
- ANSWER HAS BEEN
DEEMED UNNECESSARY.

119
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,583
COMMENCING COMBAT OPERATIONS.

120
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,541
- YOU READY, JUVIA?
- YES.

121
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:49,375
I KNOW I HAVE TO STAY AND FIGHT,
BUT I'M SO WORRIED ABOUT GRAY.

122
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,208
I WANT NOTHING MORE
THAN TO RUSH TO HIS SIDE.

123
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,458
FOR ALL I KNOW, MY BELOVED
COULD BE IN TERRIBLE DANGER

124
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,500
AT THIS VERY MOMENT!

125
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,958
- WHAT'S WRONG?  WHY AM I
FEELING SO SHORT OF BREATH?

126
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,041
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
BUT MY HEART HURTS.

127
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,958
IT'S AS IF THERE'S SOMETHING
HEAVY WEIGHING DOWN ON MY CHEST.

128
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,208
- Loke:
GRAY!

129
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,541
AS MUCH AS I HATE
TO ADMIT IT,

130
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,708
I REALLY DON'T THINK OUR TEAM

131
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:14,750
IS GOING TO WORK OUT.

132
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,333
I'M SORRY, MAN.

133
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,541
BUT TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU,

134
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:18,708
HERE'S SOMEBODY WHO WILL BE

135
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:19,958
A PERFECT PARTNER.

136
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,000
- WHAT?  DO YOU MEAN ME?

137
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:25,708
- ALL THIS TIME
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

138
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,875
THIS SHORTNESS OF BREATH,
THIS WEIGHT ON MY CHEST,

139
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,541
IT WAS YOU ALL ALONG.

140
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,166
- MY DARLING, GRAY.

141
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,916
- OUR LOVE KNOWS NO BOUNDS,
LITTLE DROPLET.

142
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,541
IF YOU'LL AGREE TO BE
MY PARTNER,

143
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,416
I HAVE NO DOUBT WE'LL BOTH
MAKE S-CLASS RANK.

144
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,583
SO, WILL YOU?

145
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,666
- YES, OF COURSE I WILL.

146
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,041
I WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR YOU,
MY LOVE.

147
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:51,875
- YOU NEED TO SNAP OUT OF IT,
RIGHT NOW! - I'M SORRY!

148
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,708
MAGUILTY SODOM.

149
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,250
- STAY FOCUSED.

150
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,541
- ARE THOSE WHAT 
I THINK THEY ARE?

151
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,208
BLADES OF MAGIC POWER.

152
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,125
SHE CAN SUMMON WEAPONS
JUST LIKE I DO?

153
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,208
- GO.

154
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,458
- NICE TRY, BUT YOUR ATTACKS
WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON ME.

155
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,916
MY BODY IS MADE ENTIRELY OF--

156
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,291
- Erza:
JUVIA!

157
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,208
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND,

158
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,541
HOW WAS SHE ABLE
TO INJURE ME?

159
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,083
- WHEN MY BLADES STRIKE

160
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,625
THEY STIMULATE THE ENEMY'S
PAIN RECEPTORS.

161
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,958
ONE MIGHT SAY
THEY'RE BLADES OF SENSATION.

162
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,750
- SUCH POWER.
- I SEE.

163
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,875
YOU'RE ONE OF THE SEVEN KIN
OF PURGATORY, AREN'T YOU?

164
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,875
- I WAS NOT SENT HERE
TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. 

165
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:38,083
JUST ELIMINATE THE ENEMY.
THAT IS THE MISSION I WAS GIVEN.

166
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,375
- IT'S FUNNY, I WAS THINKING
IT WAS ABOUT TIME

167
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,166
I TOOK ON A HUMANOID'S BODY.

168
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,416
THIS IS PERFECT.

169
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,625
- YOU'RE NOT EVEN
MAKING SENSE ANYMORE.

170
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,958
- I'LL USE
MY HUMAN ENSLAVEMENT MAGIC.

171
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,541
HUMA RAISE!

172
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,291
- YOU REALIZE THAT MAGIC
IS NOT GOING TO WORK ON ME.

173
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:00,000
I'M NOT A HUMAN, REMEMBER?
I'M A CELESTIAL SPIRIT.

174
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:03,541
- YES, AND THAT WOULD BE
THE TABOO.

175
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:08,166
THIS MAGIC IS ONLY SUPPOSED
TO BE USED ON HUMANS.

176
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,208
- HOW'D THIS HAPPEN?

177
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,541
WHEN DID I FALL
INTO HIS TRAP? 

178
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,708
- Caprico: WHOEVER DARES
TO BREAK THAT RULE...

179
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,625
- HOLD ON, YOU DON'T MEAN--

180
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:20,958
- ...COMPLETELY MERGES
WITH THEIR TARGET.

181
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,833
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

182
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,625
ARE YOU TELLING ME YOU'RE
ACTUALLY A HUMAN

183
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,250
WHO'S MERGED WITH CAPRICORN?

184
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,166
- ( Capricon chuckles )

185
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:36,375
I'M ABOUT TO MAKE YOUR BODY
MY NEXT CONQUEST, LEO!

186
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,291
- NO WAY!

187
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,041
- I'M AFRAID YOU'RE A TAD
TOO LATE.

188
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,291
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

189
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,333
WE DON'T HAVE TIME
TO STAND AROUND.

190
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,166
- I KNOW, I'M SORRY.
IT'S JUST--

191
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,083
I'M WONDERING IF WE SHOULD
GO BACK AND CHECK ON HIM. 

192
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,916
- I KNOW YOU'RE WORRIED, BUT
THAT'S NOT AN OPTION, NOT NOW.

193
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,625
- FROM WHAT I COULD TELL,
IT SEEMED LIKE LOKE

194
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:13,750
HAD SOME SORT OF PLAN.

195
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,666
- HE CAN HANDLE IT.

196
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,541
PLUS, WE'D PROBABLY
ONLY GET IN HIS WAY

197
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,208
CONSIDERING
THAT GOAT GUY'S MAGIC.

198
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,666
- HE'S GOT THIS IN THE BAG.

199
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,291
SO DON'T WORRY, OKAY?

200
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,708
AFTER ALL, HE IS THE LEADER
OF THE ZODIAC SPIRITS.

201
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:28,458
HAVE A LITTLE FAITH IN HIM.

202
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:29,708
- YEAH, I KNOW.

203
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,583
COME ON,
WE'VE GOT TO MEET UP

204
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,000
WITH EVERYBODY ELSE AND FIND
THE REST OF THE SEVEN KIN.

205
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,208
- Gray:
THAT'S RIGHT!

206
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,250
- Cana:
LET'S HURRY!

207
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,166
- LOKE, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS

208
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,416
YOU HAVE TO COME BACK
SAFE AND SOUND.

209
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,375
YOU PROMISED ME.

210
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,875
- ( chuckles )

211
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,333
- THAT HURTS.

212
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,958
OH, RIGHT. I FORGOT I WOUNDED
HIM IN BA-ATTLE.

213
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:08,250
I MEAN, BATTLE.

214
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,041
( laughing )

215
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:14,000
LOOKS LIKE I FINALLY HAVE
A HUMANOID BODY AGAIN.

216
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,750
I'VE GOT TO SAY, LEO REALLY
KNOCKED YOU OUT ON YOUR TAIL,

217
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,291
DIDN'T HE, GOAT MAN?

218
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,916
I'M NOT GOING TO MISS
BEING IN YOUR BODY.

219
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,416
BUT THANKS FOR
THE HELP ANYWAY.

220
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,916
LOOK AT ME.
I'VE GONE FROM GOAT

221
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,583
TO LEADER OF THE ZODIAC.

222
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:29,875
I'M LEO AND MY MASTER IS
MS. LUCY HEARTFILIA.

223
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,916
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS KILL HER

224
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,416
AND I'LL BE COMPLETELY
HUMAN AGAIN.

225
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,333
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT WILL BE EASY.

226
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:40,875
I'LL HAVE NO PROBLEM
GETTING CLOSE

227
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,416
BECAUSE SHE TRUSTS LEO.

228
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,291
HOW SHOULD I DO IT?
A SURPRISE ATTACK? 

229
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,500
OR MAYBE I SHOULD ENSLAVE HER
AND HAVE SOME FUN.

230
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:51,875
AFTER ALL, SHE'S AS BEAUTIFUL
AS LADY LAYLA.

231
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,125
NO!
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?!

232
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,583
UNHAND ME, NOW!

233
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:02,125
- I BELIEVE THAT REGULUS
HAS REACHED ITS ZENITH, 

234
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,166
ZORDIO.

235
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,125
- NO, DON'T SAY THAT NAME!

236
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,541
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT DOES TO ME!

237
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,083
- ( screaming )

238
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,250
- THANK YOU, CAPRICORN.

239
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,625
- I APOLOGIZE, SIR.  I DIDN'T
WANT TO USE EXCESSIVE FORCE. 

240
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:20,541
- NO, IT'S ALRIGHT.  YOU HAD
TO USE THAT MUCH POWER.

241
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:24,125
IT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD HAVE
POSSIBLY SEPARATED US.

242
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:28,625
- I DON'T GET IT, HOW ARE YOU
EVEN ABLE TO MOVE, CAPRICORN?

243
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:34,041
- JUST MOMENTS BEFORE YOU TOOK
CONTROL OVER SIR LEO'S BODY,

244
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,750
HE WAS ABLE TO GRANT ME
THE USE OF HIS MAGIC-- 

245
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,958
REGULUS, ALSO KNOWN AS
THE LIGHT OF THE KING.

246
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,958
- Zordio:
WHAT? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

247
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,750
NO!  THAT WAS A TRANSFERRAL
OF MAGIC POWER?!

248
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,583
CURSE YOU.

249
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:51,750
( screaming )

250
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:57,625
ALL THAT MATTERS IS
I'M FINALLY MYSELF AGAIN.

251
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:01,083
NO!

252
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,083
I FEEL LIKE MY BODY
IS DISINTEGRATING. 

253
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,416
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?

254
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,875
MAKE IT STOP, PLEASE!

255
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,333
CAPRICORN, HELP!

256
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,708
DON'T LET ME
DISAPPEAR LIKE THIS.

257
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,375
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME.

258
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,833
LADY LAYLA!

259
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,333
- SO THAT'S THE FATE
OF THOSE WHO DARE

260
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:21,833
TO BREAK A SACRED RULE
OF MAGIC.

261
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:26,333
- IT HAPPENED 20 YEARS AGO.

262
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:30,208
LADY LAYLA HAD
SUDDENLY FALLEN ILL.

263
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,833
SHE WAS FORCED TO RETIRE
FROM WIZARDRY.

264
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:36,125
SINCE SHE NO LONGER HAD
ANY USE FOR US,

265
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:40,083
SHE DECIDED HER THREE SPIRITS--
AQUARIUS, CANCER, AND MYSELF,

266
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,833
WOULD BE PASSED ON
TO THREE OF HER SERVANTS.

267
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:46,000
ONE OF THEM WAS ZORDIO.

268
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:49,250
MY KEY WAS GIVEN TO HIM.

269
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,916
HOWEVER, BEFORE I MOVED ON,

270
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,500
LADY LAYLA AND I MADE
ONE OTHER CONTRACT.

271
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:59,666
I PROMISE YOU, MY LADY.
I'LL PROTECT YOUR FAMILY

272
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,625
FOR ALL ETERNITY.

273
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,083
IN THE FUTURE,

274
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:06,208
SHOULD ONE OF YOUR DESCENDENTS
CHOOSE TO FOLLOW

275
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:09,125
THE PATH OF MAGIC--
- YES.

276
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:13,208
CAPRICORN, I ASK THAT YOU
PLEASE HELP GUIDE THEM

277
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,750
ALONG THAT PATH.

278
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:20,125
- I SEE, SO THAT'S HOW YOU
WERE CONTRACTED TO LUCY.

279
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,875
- YES, THAT'S CORRECT.

280
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,875
IN THE BEGINNING, ZORDIO
CONSENTED TO THE ARRANGEMENT.

281
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,875
HOWEVER, IT WASN'T LONG
BEFORE HE WAS FORCED

282
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,083
TO LEAVE THE MANOR.

283
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,833
HE BEGAN TRAVELING AIMLESSLY.

284
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:35,541
EVENTUALLY, HE WAS EXPOSED
TO THE DARK SIDE OF MAGIC.

285
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:39,291
- Loke: I'M GUESSING HE
THEN BROKE A SACRED RULE.

286
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,541
AND ENDED UP MERGING WITH YOU.

287
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,000
THAT KIND OF POWER

288
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,500
CAN SOMETIMES PUSH PEOPLE
TOWARD THE DARK SIDE.

289
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,250
I KNOW BECAUSE
I'VE WITNESSED IT FIRSTHAND.

290
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,875
I CAN HONESTLY SAY,
THERE'S NOTHING MORE PAINFUL.

291
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,791
SO, TELL ME SOMETHING.

292
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF LUCY
NOW THAT YOU'VE MET HER? 

293
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,291
- SHE'S DEFINITELY
LADY LAYLA'S DAUGHTER.

294
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,000
IT'S CLEAR SHE LOVES
HER SPIRITS.

295
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,416
AND I CAN TELL
THEY LOVE HER IN RETURN.

296
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,791
- DOES THAT MEAN
YOU'RE WILLING

297
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,750
TO LEND HER YOUR HELP,
CAPRICORN?

298
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,083
SHE COULD REALLY USE IT.

299
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,875
- I CAN'T.

300
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,833
I'M SORRY, SIR LEO.

301
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,750
I'M AFRAID THAT IT'S TOO LATE.

302
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,625
I CAN'T OFFER HER MY HELP NOW.

303
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:21,125
I'M ONLY SAYING THAT

304
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,375
BECAUSE SHE ALREADY HAS MY POWER
AT HER FULL DISPOSAL.

305
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:29,791
FINALLY, I CAN RETURN
TO MY RIGHTFUL OWNER.

306
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,625
- IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

307
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,375
- DON'T TELL ME
LOKE'S IN TROUBLE.

308
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,416
- UH-UH, HE WAS JUST
TELLING ME HE WON!

309
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,666
- REALLY?
- I KNEW HE COULD DO IT.

310
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,000
- HE SAYS HE DOESN'T
WANT TO GO

311
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,208
INTO ALL THE DETAILS RIGHT NOW,

312
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,541
BUT APPARENTLY CAPRICORN

313
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:46,666
SWITCHED OVER TO OUR SIDE.

314
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,166
ALSO, HE SAYS THE FIGHT

315
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,666
REALLY TOOK IT OUT OF HIM.

316
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,416
SO HE'S GOING TO TRY
TO RECOVER HIS STRENGTH

317
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,291
BY GOING BACK
TO THE CELESTIAL WORLD.

318
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,375
- WHAT?
- IT MAKES SENSE.

319
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,166
I MEAN, HE HAS BEEN USING
HIS MAGIC POWER

320
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,208
TO STAY IN THE HUMAN WORLD
ALL THIS TIME.

321
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,000
- BUT THAT AIN'T FAIR AT ALL!

322
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,875
HE PROMISED HE WOULD BE
MY PARTNER,

323
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,125
NOW HE'S BACKING OUT ON ME.

324
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,291
- HE SAYS TO TELL YOU

325
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,583
HE'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU LATER.

326
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,083
- WHAT? FORGET HIM!

327
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,000
YOU TELL THAT FOUR-EYED FINK
I DON'T NEED

328
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,208
HIS HELP TO MAKE S-CLASS.

329
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,291
- S-CLASS.

330
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,250
- Lucy:
OKAY, LET'S GET MOVING YOU GUYS.

331
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,666
- Gray:
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

332
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,041
- Cana:
HOLD ON, I HAVE AN IDEA.

333
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,750
WELL, IF WE WANT TO FIND
THE OTHER SIX CREEPS

334
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,416
IT MIGHT BE EASIER
IF WE SPLIT UP.

335
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,041
- YOU THINK?
- ARE YOU CRAZY?!

336
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,708
I DON'T WANT TO RISK
RUNNING INTO ONE OF THEM

337
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:29,666
WHEN I'M ALL BY MYSELF.

338
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,125
- OH, DON'T WORRY!

339
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,125
I'LL BE THERE
TO PROTECT YOU, LUCY.

340
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,208
- BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE--

341
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,375
- I SEE, SO WHEN YOU SAID,
"LET'S SPLIT UP,"

342
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,041
YOU REALLY MEANT,
"LET'S DITCH GRAY."

343
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,916
- YOU'RE JEALOUS.
YOU JUST WANT TO SEE US

344
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
COMPARE CUP SIZES, DON'T YOU?

345
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,125
- THAT'S NOT TRUE,
AND YOU KNOW IT, JEEZ.

346
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,333
I JUST DON'T THINK
SPLITTING UP IS A GOOD IDEA

347
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,625
'CAUSE WE'RE A LOT STRONGER
TOGETHER THAN WE ARE ON OUR OWN.

348
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,625
- LISTEN, GRAY.
THE ONLY REASON I SUGGESTED

349
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,291
WE SPLIT UP TO SEARCH
FOR THE ENEMY

350
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:56,000
IS BECAUSE I WANT TO GET BACK
TO THE S-CLASS TRIALS.

351
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,416
AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT,
WE HAVE TO WIPE THEM OUT.

352
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,333
BET I KNOW EXACTLY WHY
YOU'RE SO AGAINST IT. 

353
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,666
YOU'RE SCARED!

354
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,125
- CANA!

355
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:09,583
- HM, FINE.  HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

356
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:12,041
LET'S GO AHEAD
AND SPLIT UP HERE.

357
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,583
- BE CAREFUL OUT THERE, GRAY.

358
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,500
- RIGHT BACK AT YOU.

359
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,875
- Natsu: ALRIGHT, I'VE HAD
ENOUGH OF YOU, LADY.

360
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,250
YOU KNOW, IF YOU
AND YOUR FRIENDS

361
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,666
HADN'T INTERRUPTED
OUR TRIALS,

362
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,708
I WOULD ALREADY BE A FREAKING
S-CLASS WIZARD BY NOW!

363
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,583
- ARE YOU POSITIVE THAT'S
WHAT YOUR FUTURE HOLDS?

364
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,958
EACH ONE OF THESE CRYSTAL BALLS

365
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,291
CONTAINS A DIFFERENT
POSSIBLE FUTURE FOR YOU.

366
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,541
PARALLEL WORLDS.

367
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,666
I HAVE THE ABILITY TO CREATE

368
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,500
AN INFINITE NUMBER OF FUTURES.

369
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,958
AND THEN COMPRESS THEM
INTO A SINGLE FUTURE.

370
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,708
FLASH FORWARD!

371
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,250
WE HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN
TO THE FUN PART YET,

372
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,041
AND YOU'RE KNOCKED OUT COLD.

373
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:11,083
- NATSU!

374
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,958
- Narrator:
THIS IS ALL THAT'S LEFT

375
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,416
OF FAIRY TAIL'S BASE CAMP.

376
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,125
- DON'T WORRY,
THEY'RE BOTH BREATHING.

377
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,250
THEY'LL BE OKAY.
BUT STILL--

378
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:26,333
I CAN'T BELIEVE GAJEEL AND MIRA
WERE SO EASILY DEFEATED.

379
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:30,958
- I FEEL TERRIBLE ABOUT THIS.
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

380
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:34,875
- NO, IT'S NOT ANYBODY'S FAULT.

381
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,000
- Lisanna:
BIG BROTHER ELF.

382
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,125
- AS MUCH AS I HATE
TO ADMIT IT,

383
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:42,541
WE DON'T STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST GRIMOIRE HEART.

384
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:43,833
THEY'RE WAY TOO STRONG.

385
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,125
- I'M A SAD EXCUSE FOR A MAN.

386
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,125
I COULDN'T PROTECT MY BIG SISTER

387
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,166
OR MY PARTNER
FROM THOSE MONSTERS!

388
00:19:56,791 --> 00:20:00,541
- IT'S TIME FOR US
TO COME TOGETHER. 

389
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,083
- LEVY...

390
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,541
- Levy:
WE ALL WANTED TO BECOME

391
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,833
S-CLASS WIZARDS SO BADLY,

392
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,166
THAT WE LET THE TRIAL
DRIVE US APART.

393
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,875
I KNOW IT WAS ONLY
FOR A LITTLE BIT,

394
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,875
BUT EVERYONE WAS THINKING
ABOUT THEMSELVES

395
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,416
INSTEAD OF THE GUILD.

396
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,958
WELL, WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO DO THAT ANYMORE.

397
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:20,875
OUR ENEMY MAY BE OVERWHELMING,

398
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,166
BUT WE'RE THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD.

399
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,583
IF WE PUT ALL OF OUR STRENGTH

400
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,458
AND OUR FEELINGS TOGETHER,

401
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,000
THERE'S NO WAY
THEY CAN BEAT US.

402
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:30,916
PLEASE, EVERYBODY.

403
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,166
WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER.

404
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,583
I'M BEGGING YOU.

405
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:40,166
- Lucy:
MAVIS' GRAVE?

406
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,875
- Cana: YEAH, YOU SAID YOU
FIGURED OUT WHERE IT IS, RIGHT?

407
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,541
I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU
ABOUT IT EARLIER,

408
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,583
BUT THEN ALL THE CRAZY STUFF
STARTED HAPPENING.

409
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,541
- SURE, I'LL TELL YOU.

410
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,791
BUT I'VE GOT TO WARN YOU,
I COULD BE TOTALLY WRONG.

411
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,166
THERE WAS A LOT
OF GUESSWORK INVOLVED.

412
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,458
FIRST OF ALL,

413
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,041
I DECIDED TO THINK UP
A LIST OF WORDS

414
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:58,666
THAT MIGHT SOMEHOW BE CONNECTED
TO THE WORD "GRAVE."

415
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:03,875
DEATH, TO SLEEP, THE EARTH,
A STONE, A STAR, MAYBE END?

416
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,541
SADLY, NO SINGLE WORD
WAS SIX LETTERS LONG.

417
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,791
- WAIT, I DON'T GET IT.
WHERE DID YOU GET THE IDEA

418
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,750
THAT THERE NEEDED TO BE 
SIX LETTERS IN THE WORD.

419
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,416
- FROM THE TIME LIMIT, SILLY.

420
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,583
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO FIND
THE GRAVE IN SIX HOURS.

421
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,000
I FIGURED THAT NUMBER
HAD TO BE IMPORTANT. 

422
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,625
NOW I KNOW IT'S A BIT
OF A STRETCH,

423
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,666
BUT I THOUGHT OF A WORD
THAT NOT ONLY HAS SIX LETTERS

424
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,791
BUT ALSO RELATES TO THE WORDS
"GRAVE" AND "TIME."

425
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,041
DEMISE.

426
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,916
ESSENTIALLY, IT MEANS TO END.

427
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,375
IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH DEATH

428
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,541
AND THEREFORE GRAVES,

429
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:30,666
MEETS THE LETTER REQUIREMENT,

430
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,250
AND HAS A TIME ELEMENT TO IT.

431
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:36,250
OKAY, NOW HERE'S WHERE THINGS
GET IFFY.

432
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,458
THIS IS JUST A HUNCH, BUT WHEN
YOU LOOK AT THE WORD "DEMISE,"

433
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,833
THERE'S ONE LETTER THAT'S
DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS.

434
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,125
WANT TO GUESS?
- UM, I DON'T KNOW.

435
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,625
- THERE'S ONE LETTER
THAT'S USED TWICE--

436
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,375
"E," DOESN'T THAT SEEM
KIND OF SUSPICIOUS TO YOU?

437
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,416
- WHAT'S IT MEAN?

438
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,333
- REMEMBER HOW ALL THE PATHS

439
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,166
WE CHOSE AT THE VERY BEGINNING
OF THE TRIAL

440
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,375
WERE MARKED WITH LETTERS?

441
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,833
- Cana:
BACK IN THE FIRST ROUND.

442
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,166
- YEP, YOU GOT IT.

443
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,375
ROUTE "E."

444
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,875
I THINK THAT'S WHERE...

445
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,625
- YOU'VE BEEN A BIG HELP.

446
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,708
THANK YOU.

447
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:24,041
I'M SO SORRY, LUCY.

448
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:36,791
- ( theme music playing )

449
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,875
- ( singing in Japanese )

450
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:15,000
- Happy: MAN, I WISH
I HAD A SPECIAL ATTACK.

451
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,458
LIKE A KITTY ROAR,

452
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:17,916
A FELINE IRON FIST,

453
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,583
OR A CAT TALON!
YOU GET ALL THE FUN.

454
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,333
- Natsu: I'M NOT THE
ONLY ONE WHO HAS THEM.

455
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:24,041
HEY, I KNOW.
I JUST CAME UP WITH

456
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:25,750
A PERFECT SPECIAL ATTACK
FOR YOU, LITTLE BUDDY.

457
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,333
- Happy:
REALLY?  WHAT IS IT?

458
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:28,875
- Natsu: WELL, FIRST
YOU LIGHT LUCY ON FIRE.

459
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,500
AND THEN YOU LAUNCH HER
AT THE ENEMY!  I CALL IT--

460
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:33,291
- Happy and Natsu: ... 

461
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:34,916
- Happy:
BUT IF THAT'S WHAT YOU NAME IT,

462
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,500
WOULDN'T IT BE
LUCY'S SPECIAL ATTACK?

463
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:38,041
- Natsu: IT MINE,
