1
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,750
[LUCY sighs]

2
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,666
Aw. Don't let it
get you down, Lucy.

3
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,958
I'm sure you can find
out what it means.

4
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:27,875
Mmm. Well it
won't be easy.

5
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:29,916
We've taken a
new job request.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,750
[GRAY] There are some
bad guys stealing gold

7
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,125
that we need to catch.

8
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,583
I hope it's not the
Butt Jiggle Gang again.

9
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,250
[GRAY] Whoever it is,
we gotta put a stop to 'em.

10
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,625
Sorry, but I'm gonna
pass on this one.

11
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,625
We're having a hard
time getting very far

12
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:45,125
on figuring out what
this inscription says.

13
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,375
Where's Natsu?

14
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,041
[LUCY] No clue, I think
he took off a while ago.

15
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,958
Well, if that's the case,
then we'll be leaving.

16
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:52,875
Cool.

17
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:54,583
Wait. Hang on a sec.

18
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:56,666
When you say "we"
are you talking about

19
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,416
just the two of us going?

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,166
Do you have a
problem with that?

21
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,916
[GRAY] A-A problem?

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,166
Of course not.

23
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,666
If we hurry, we may be
back before nightfall.

24
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,583
So let's move.

25
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,208
[JUVIA] This is a
major problem, Gray!

26
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:16,083
You should have insisted
that I come along with you!

27
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:19,666
How could my
darling be so cruel?

28
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,833
This is so boring.

29
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,541
Come on, it's a matter of
'lunch or death' here Natsu.

30
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,375
How can anyone
be bored by that?

31
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:04,500
Okay, I'll snap out
of it, I promise.

32
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,541
Are you kidding me?

33
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,791
What do you want?

34
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,375
[GORIAN chuckles]

35
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,375
I was just thinking
about how much I wanna

36
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:18,291
settle the score with
those Fairy Tail losers.

37
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,291
And all of a sudden one
of 'em walks on my turf.

38
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,166
Monkey's got
a bone to pick?

39
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,916
Yeah, I gotta pick which
one I wanna break first.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,125
I think I'll start
with your face.

41
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,583
You're in for the
shock of your life.

42
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,500
[GORIAN screams]

43
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,250
No way.

44
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,208
I know what that means.

45
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,000
Huh? What're ya
talkin' about?

46
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,708
Laxus is here.

47
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:47,750
What?

48
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,083
I'm positive
it's him.

49
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,875
I was wondering where
he had run off to,

50
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,541
I guess he picked
the wrong neighborhood.

51
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:55,541
But master didn't let him get
back into the guild, did he?

52
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,541
I wonder what he's
doing around here.

53
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,250
I'm gonna find out!

54
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,625
[HAPPY] Hey, Natsu!

55
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,458
Wait for me!

56
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:09,208
[HAPPY] Turbulent Showdown!
Natsu vs. Laxus!

57
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,125
[NATSU] What's up, metal head?

58
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,625
[GAJEEL] None of your
business, flame brain!

59
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,000
Are you going somewhere?

60
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,708
Why? Are you?

61
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,291
I asked you first,
didn't I?

62
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,833
Yeah? Who cares?

63
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,291
You ain't following me!

64
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:25,125
I don't wanna,
so get lost!

65
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,416
Would you two cut
it out already?

66
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,458
We need to go
see what that

67
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,375
random lightning
strike was about!

68
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,583
What?

69
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,041
I already told you it
was Laxus, didn't I?

70
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,208
I'm gonna go put the
smack down on him!

71
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,625
Please.

72
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,333
You don't have a snowball's
chance in hell against him.

73
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,166
Remember last time?

74
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,208
Even with me giving you
a major helping hand,

75
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,000
he still beat the
ever-lovin' snot outta ya.

76
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,500
[GAJEEL chuckles]

77
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,333
Chuckle all you want, but
I didn't need your help then,

78
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,875
and I don't
need it this time!

79
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,625
I'll beat him with
my own two hands!

80
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,125
Not if I get
to him first!

81
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,750
[LAXUS]
Who's beatin' who, again?

82
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,041
[NATSU and GAJEEL] Laxus?

83
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,250
Whoa!

84
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,000
That lightning really
was him, after all.

85
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,916
[BIXLOW, EVERGREEN,
and FRIED] Laxus!

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,375
It would seem that
he's not alone, either.

87
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,625
What's going on?

88
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,958
There's nothing goin'
on here, is there?

89
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:24,250
Have you been living out in
the woods this entire time?

90
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,208
[LAXUS] Heh.

91
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,791
I traveled around
quite a bit,

92
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,125
but I've been here
for a little while.

93
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,250
If you're this close,
you should just

94
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,333
come back to
the guild already.

95
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,666
Why's that, have you
been missing me?

96
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,541
[NATSU] I don't give a crap
if you come back or not.

97
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,458
But since we're here,
I think we should

98
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,125
throw down and see
who comes out on top.

99
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,791
Sounds good to me.

100
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:48,416
Heh. You guys really want me
to take the bait, don't ya?

101
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,708
You wanna go and get me all
riled up and ready to fight.

102
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,500
Well I got better
things to do.

103
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,875
Like run away?

104
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,208
What?

105
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,583
You've never been
the type of guy

106
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,125
who backed down
from a challenge.

107
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,791
So what're
you scared of?

108
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,250
You'd be wise to mind
your tongue, Natsu.

109
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,666
[GAJEEL] Heh, heh.

110
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,166
[LAXUS sighs]

111
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,166
Okay, fine.

112
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,958
Now that's more like it!

113
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,291
Sorry, but you ain't
layin' a finger on him.

114
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,625
You'll have to go through
the Thunder Legion.

115
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:22,000
Laxus' fate and our own shall
never again be torn asunder!

116
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,791
No, I'd actually love
to teach these two clowns

117
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,166
a lesson all by myself.

118
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,541
Sounds like fun to me!

119
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:31,916
All right, Natsu.

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,041
Guess you're
first in line.

121
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:37,916
[WENDY] Wait! Hold on!

122
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,500
Huh? What for?

123
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,291
If you guys are really
gonna go through with this,

124
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,750
you gotta make sure that
it's a special occasion!

125
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,166
I don't follow you.

126
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,625
What are you
talkin' about?

127
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,958
The match will take
place tomorrow!

128
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,750
Okay, if you insist,
have it your way.

129
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,666
I can wait one more day
to kick his butt!

130
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,500
Meet me tomorrow under the big
Sola tree in South Gate Park!

131
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,666
And when he's done,
it'll be my turn.

132
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,833
Sounds like a plan to me.

133
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,416
[WENDY sighs]

134
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,833
[WAKABA] You guys hear
about the big showdown?

135
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:12,000
Add that one to the list
of Natsu's bad decisions.

136
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,708
Did you know
Laxus was around?

137
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,500
He's been living in the woods
around Magnolia for a while.

138
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,375
Big time fights
are so manly.

139
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,791
This is gonna be
the best one ever!

140
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,750
Should we be worried about
Natsu and Gajeel getting hurt?

141
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,541
Oh, they're gonna
get hurt, alright.

142
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:28,875
Yeah. Laxus is not someone
I'd ever want to go up against.

143
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,083
Those two don't stand
a chance against him.

144
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,791
Is he really that much
stronger than them?

145
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,750
He's a tough
customer for sure.

146
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,916
Back when he was still a
member, I'd say that probably

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,625
the only one more powerful
than him was Gildarts.

148
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,208
Okay!

149
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,958
As the master of the guild, I'd
better get this party started!

150
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,083
Yeah! It'll be
a fight party!

151
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,958
The manliest
kind there is!

152
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,458
That's a great idea.

153
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,791
Turn this into something
fun for everyone!

154
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,833
[GROUP] Alright!

155
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,333
[NATSU] This is crazy.

156
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,750
What's going on here?

157
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,958
Is there some kinda festival
happening or somethin'?

158
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,916
[HAPPY] Everyone's
gettin' their party on!

159

is all because of you?

[HAPPY] Seriously,
what's the festival for?

164
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:17,791
[LUCY] I'm being serious.

165
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,291
It's because people heard
about the big fight.

166
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,708
[MICHELLE] And they
decided to put together

167
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,666
a festival the night before.

168

love to party!

don't care, but we weren't

getting anywhere figuring out
that ancient language.

So this seemed like a good
way to unwind for a bit.

the real talent already!

think it'd be a good idea

196
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,416
to at least do a little
training before the big fight?

197

That won't be necessary.

I was just planning
on hitting him hard

with everything
I've already got.

Of course.
Why would I ever think

that you would have any
real strategy in mind?

202

I wonder how Gajeel's
gearing up for the showdown.

[NATSU] You know he's gotta be
really afraid he'll get beaten.

204
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,708
So he's probably somewhere
doing some kind of

205
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,250
super crazy training.

206
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,208
Instead, let me introduce a
singer who's got soul and style.

I'm sure ice will prove
to be even easier.

315
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,958
[GRAY] Ice Make Lance!

316
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,666
It will trap it,
double its strength

317
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,666
and send it right
back to you!

318
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,083
You think you can
hit me with that?

319
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,916
Impressive.

320
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,791
Let's give him
double trouble!

321
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,916
[BALD BROTHER] Heaven and Earth
Annihilation Technique!

322
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,625
Look toward heaven, and
we strike from the earth!

323
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,375
[GRAY grunts]

324
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:12,583
[HAIR BROTHER]
Look towards earth,

325
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,041
and we strike down from Heaven!

326
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,291
[GRAY yells]

327
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,750
Very few have survived.

328
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,250
Our ultimate
combination attack.

329
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,458
[GRAY yells]

330
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,583
[ERZA] Natsu may have
defeated them once,

331
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,458
but that was over
seven years ago.

332
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,458
Perhaps they truly
have improved.

333
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:36,666
[JUVIA] Don't worry, my dear.
I will save you.

334
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,875
I got this, okay!

335
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,958
[GRAY] You talk a big game.

336
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,041
But I feel just fine!

337
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,208
[BROTHERS] Nonsense!

338
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,875
Prepare to die!

339
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:53,000
You got heaven and earth but
let me show ya what I got!

340
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:56,000
Ice Bringer!

341
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,625
Not a chance!

342
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,708
[BALD BROTHER yells]

343
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,250
[JUVIA] He's just so amazing!

344
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,666
[GRAY sighs]

345
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,833
[ERZA] Gray has improved
over the years as well.

346
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,666
I'm surprised you took
that long to beat them.

347
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,166
I wanted to have
a little fun, too.

348
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,041
You will return every ounce of
gold you stole from our client!

349
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,791
Do I make myself clear?

350
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,333
[BANDITS] Yes ma'am.
Crystal clear!

351
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:28,375
[JUVIA] I can go home
knowing my love is safe!

352
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,125
[LAXUS] What's the big occasion?

353
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,958
When word got out that
you were havin' a fight,

354
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,166
the whole town decided
to throw a big party.

355
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,125
You seeing
this, Laxus?

356
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,958
You're still quite the
celebrity around here.

357
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,416
Yeah, I see they're all
still a bunch of idiots.

358
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,708
You're a true legend
of the Fairy Tail guild.

359
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,708
So why don't you
realize how much

360
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,125
we all desperately
need you...

361
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,125
Get a hold of
yourself, man.

362
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,416
[BOY 129A laughs]

363
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,916
Thanks a lot, grandpa!

364
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,083
[OLD MAN 129A] Sure, but
don't tell your mom, okay?

365
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,666
[WENDY] This is horrible.

366
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,041
The only reason I told them
to wait a day is so they could

367
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,125
calm down a little bit
and call off the fight.

368
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,666
[CARLA] It seems your plan
may have backfired, child.

369
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,416
I never thought it'd turn
into such a big deal.

370
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,916
[MAKAROV] Something
troubling you, Wendy?

371
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,791
[WENDY] Actually, there is.

372
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,083
Where have you
been hiding yourself,

373
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,916
we've been looking
everywhere for you!

374
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,791
Why, has something
happened?

375
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,833
Natsu and Gajeel
are in trouble.

376
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,500
They're about to have
fight against Laxus!

377
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,416
They're doing what?

378
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,750
[JASON] Cool!

379
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:37,791
Laxus is so calm and
collected, it's terrifying!

380
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,000
Sweet!

381
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,708
Black Steel Gajeel is
ready to throw down!

382
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,041
The two heroes stare
down their opponent.

383
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:47,708
The tension is so thick
you can cut it with a knife!

384
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,125
[GAJEEL chuckles]

385
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,583
[JASON] Natsu has arrived!

386
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:57,750
All three warriors
are in their places!

387
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,500
Now check
this out, Happy.

388
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,083
Aye, sir!

389
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,958
[JASON] Laxus stands up!

390
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,083
Looks like Natsu is
getting first crack at him!

391
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,166
Let's do this thing.

392
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,041
[NATSU] Bring it!

393
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:20,041
But I gotta warn you, that
I'm not gonna hold back!

394
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,041
I don't blame ya.

395
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,625
You understand?

396
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,583
If you don't survive this,
it ain't my fault.

397
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,500
I could say the same
for you, big guy!

398
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,291
You'd better
get back, Happy.

399
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,416
Good luck, Natsu,
I'm rooting for ya!

400
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,000
[NATSU] Thanks, pal.

gonna be intense!

strikes first will lose.

The poor kid didn't
land a single hit!

I don't know
about that,

he hit the ground
pretty dang hard.

415
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,333
Are you okay?

416
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,041
Great job as
usual, Laxus!

417
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:40,291
The little guy's still
got nothin' on ya, buddy.

418
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,291
So are you ready
for round two?

419
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,250
He's gone.

Whoa! Gajeel just ghosted!

421
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,333
Ya' mean that lousy
coward ran away?

422
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,500
[PANTHERLILY] What?

423
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,958
Alright you guys,
let's track him down!

424
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:56,500
It's a manhunt!
That sounds so manly!

425
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,958
I always thought you had
the heart of a warrior, Gajeel!

426
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:02,166
Are you even able
to stand up, Natsu?

427
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:25,958
[LEVY] Oh sweet!

428
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,500
This is written in
ancient Potamelian!

429
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,041
[MICHELLE] I've never
heard of that.

430
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,083
So, now that you've
figured that out,

431
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,958
do you know
what it says?

432
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:38,583
"Time ticks forward on
toward inevitable chaos."

433
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,958
"Time ticks forward."

434
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:44,541
"On toward inevitable chaos?"

435
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:45,875
Sounds familiar.

436
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,291
I know I've heard
it somewhere before.

437
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,583
You have?

438
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,583
Hm... yeah.

439
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,416
But where?

440
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,250
You're just gonna
take off again?

the guild lasted long enough?

444
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,000
Take him back!

445
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,958
It's not this one or this.

Here it is! I found it!

It's in here.
That spooky phrase.

448
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,083
I was sure that I had
read it somewhere before

449
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,000
and it's in this book.

450
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,625
[LEVY] What's the book about?

451

Well, lemme see.

452
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,791
Basically, it's about an
old clock that passes from

453
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:46,375
one owner to the next over
a long period of time,

454
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,750
and a lot of mysterious
things happen around it

455
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,083
throughout its history.

456
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,250
Whoa, I think
I get it, guys.

457

It's the hand of a clock.

Nah, I've had much
worse headaches.

465
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:17,041
I wonder where that scaredy-cat
Gajeel is hiding himself.

466
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,541
Macao and the others went
out looking for him.

467
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:22,333
But no one knows where he is.

I think I can hear
Gajeel outside.

00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,541
[NATSU] What the heck?

474
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,166
Who could be dumb enough to
pick a fight with Fairy Tail?

475
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,208
Wait, do these guys
seem familiar to you?

476
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,416
[HAPPY] Geez, you must
need glasses Natsu.

477
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,375
These are the same jokers that
we went up against in Edolas.

478
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:24,250
[NATSU] No way!

479
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:25,958
Did they always look like this?

480
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,583
[HAPPY] Um. Now that
you mention it,

481
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,041
they do look
pretty different.

482
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:31,000
[NATSU] Guess I'm not the
only one who needs glasses.

483
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,625
[NATSU and HAPPY]
Next Time: Target: Lucy!

484
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:36,291
[HAPPY] Hold on, are they
going after Lucy? Why?

485
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:37,541
[NATSU] Well, that's
really nothing new,

486
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:39,041
someone's always
out to get her.

487
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:41,875
[HAPPY] I bet she probably
forgot to pay her rent again.
