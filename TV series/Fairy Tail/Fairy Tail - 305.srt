[IRENE]
So you've met my little ones.

3
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:33,958
In fact, it appears you had
quite a lively introduction.

[whimpering]

5
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:40,458
[MIRAJANE] Her magic power...
It's terrifying.

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,416
[IRENE] You will not
go gently into death.

10
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,833
Let me begin by taking that
flawless, beautiful skin

11
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:14,875
and tearing it into ribbons.

12
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,291
When I'm done, you'll be no more

13
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:19,791
than a lump of shredded meat,
unbearable to behold.

14
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:56,500
[MIRAJANE screaming]

15
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,666
[AUGUST]
Irene.

16
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,666
Can't control your extreme
proclivities, can you?

17
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,333
It's been a while since
we've crossed paths.

18
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:13,833
Nice to see you.

19
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,666
And you have Brandish in tow.

20
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,833
You've certainly grown.

21
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,083
[BRANDISH]
Yes.

22
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,000
Why did you cast Universe One

23
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,250
without the approval
of His Majesty?

24
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,750
[IRENE] I had been
confronted by Acnologia.

25
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:30,250
That was a battle I could
not risk being drawn into.

26
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,750
So I chose to expel
the Black Dragon

27
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:36,000
and send our Lord to
Fairy Tail all at once.

28
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,458
I don't believe this is
the time for lectures.

29
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,291
The Twelve are to assemble--

30
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,916
confer with him about
the way forward.

31
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,708
[IRENE] Sorry, but I believe
I'll do as I see fit, thank you.

32
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:48,708
That so?

33
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,208
You'll defy my order

34
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,291
as the appointed leader
of the Spriggan Twelve?

35
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,833
[MIRAJANE]
They both have so much power.

36
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,041
Can this even be real?

37
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,125
[IRENE]
Very well.

38
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:16,416
I suppose I've no choice
but to honor your request.

39
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,541
However, this girl
hurt my little ones,

40
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,125
so I simply can't let her live.

41
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,083
[gasps]

42
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:33,791
She won't be a bother
anymore. Are you satisfied?

43
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,416
A rather unexpectedly
compassionate move

44
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,000
from one known
as the "Calamity."

45
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,916
As you wish, then. Let's go.

46
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:08,250
I've missed you, big sister.

47
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,916
Yukino, I--

48
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,125
Whoa! What the--?!

49
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,833
I'm so confused!

50
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,458
Me, too!

51
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:25,458
I'm sorry, but I don't
have a little sister.

52
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,666
No! You do!

53
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,916
You're mistaken.
Must be someone else.

54
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,125
[YUKINO]
Sorano!

55
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm not wrong.
I know it in my heart.

56
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,875
It's you! You're the one
I've been looking for!

57
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,416
They took you,

58
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,916
and I have done everything I
could think of to get you back.

59
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,833
I risked all I had.

60
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:51,500
I even went so far as trying
to turn back time for you.

61
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:55,500
Leave Yukino alone!
It's not her fault!

62
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,041
[YUKINO]
Sorano.

63
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,625
You were always there
to protect me.

64
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:00,791
You stood up for me,

65
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:04,208
and I never gave up hope
I'd see you again.

66
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,333
[ANGEL]
I told you, I'm not her.

67
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,208
How can you be so cruel now?

68
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:12,958
[ANGEL] There's no way a sinner
like me could be your sister!

69
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:17,333
My little sister is working
to make the world right.

70
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:20,916
She deserves better than someone
who's done so much wrong.

71
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,291
I pray... that maybe someday,

72
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:29,500
all of my horrible sins
can be forgiven.

73
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,666
And then, I'll
embrace my sister!

74
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,875
You'll be forgiven.
I know you will!

75
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:42,833
That's what I'm
fighting for right now!

76
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:46,500
But... I know I haven't
earned it yet.

77
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:49,666
It means so much to know
you're alive. I'm happy.

78
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,916
Oh. Ain't love a
beautiful thing?

79
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,791
She doesn't even know her.

80
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,541
It's okay if you
don't understand

81
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,625
all of the details, Frosch.

82
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah, I think so, too.

83
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:09,833
[ELFMAN] Mira. Lisanna.
Hope you're okay.

84

[LISANNA]
Mirajane!

85
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:18,000

leave you behind!

We gotta go, Lisanna!

They need us at the
guild hall, now!

That's where I was going.

Sorry. I came back.

Listen to me!

[WIZARD A]
Stop right there!

That's as far as
you're goin', lady!

100
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:26,000
Can't let a prisoner
like you get away.

101
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,541
The old hag would skin us
alive if we lost her.

[LARCADE] May your spirits
white, into heaven take flight.

I have come for you, Dimaria.

108

I'm humbled.
Larcade Dragneel.


109
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,083
It's been so long
since I've seen you.

110
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,583
Feels like a hundred years ago.

111
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,750
Ninety-five, to be exact.

112
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,541
[ZEREF]
Nevertheless, the entire time

113
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:23,000
I could hear your voice
and sense your presence.

114
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,541
[MAVIS]
Here he is.

115
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,833
I have one last-ditch
strategy for defeating him.

116
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,333
First thing I needed
was my real body.

117
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,125
And now, I have it back.

118
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:35,416
However, there's one more
step that I have to take.

119
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,166
Another contradiction.

120
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,916
Can I even get my
mind around it?

121
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,208
[gasps]

122
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,208
[MAVIS]
No! I can't move!

123
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,333
That's not necessary, Invel.

124
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:53,083
Majesty, I am aware
of the relationship

125
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,625
you and she once had.

126
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,083
However, she is the
Fairy Heart itself.

127
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:00,125
Which means, she could
weaponize that power.

128
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,916
[ZEREF] Mavis understands
more than anyone

129
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,083
that the Fairy Heart
cannot be used.

130
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,958
Even if it would ensure
my long-awaited death.

131
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:10,875
The residual effects
would be catastrophic.

132
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,291
But still.

133
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,125
[ZEREF] Mavis had been
trapped inside that crystal

134
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:18,375
for a very long time--nearly
a century--completely immobile.

135
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,875
It pains me to see her
in such a state again.

136
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,375
So if you please.

137
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,750
Lord.

138
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,666
What now?

139
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,666
[INVEL] Then I'll leave
her body unfettered,

140
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,166
but her mind restrained.

141
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,000
[MAVIS]
What's happening to me?

142
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,208
It's like my thoughts
are all jumbled.

143
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,750
No! I need to stay focused!

144
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,625
Oh, honestly, Invel.

145
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,083
You worry far too much
for your own good.

146
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,708
[INVEL]
Part of my duty to the empire

147
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:52,500
is to ensure your
safety, Your Majesty.

148
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,541
[MAVIS] I can't hold
my thoughts together.

149
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,083
Is this his magic?

[ZEREF]
Mavis. Please come with me.

151
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:07,000
[MAVIS]
My body is moving on its own.

152
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,041

Look down there.

What's going on here?

00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,958
Your friends are coming.

156
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,041
I mean, after all, you're
the heart of the guild,

157
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,833
and this hall their
beloved home.

158
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:58,083
However, will they be able to
survive the harsh journey?

159
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,208
I would love to see
the Fairies try!

160
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,875
I'll grind 'em into dust
before they ever get close.

00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,541
How'd that work last time?
Not good, right?

162
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,083
Like you did any better!

163
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,750
But they won't get by me again.

164
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,500
'Course not.

165
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,000
Randi.

166
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,541
Mary.

167
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,375
Heard they captured you.

168
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,416
But it looks like
you're all right now.

169
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,708
Yeah.

170
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,500
[DIMARIA]
They'll pay for what they did.

171
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,875
Hear me? We'll slaughter
them together!

172
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,583
Friendship is lovely.
The sight of it warms me.

173
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,166
[grunts]

174
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,833
Not to be confused with the fire
of contempt I feel from you.

175
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,083
What else is he to do?

176
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,583
Follow his orders and
that may change.

177
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:50,333
[MAVIS] That old man is August,
the most powerful wizard of all.

178
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:54,375
But the other... His energy
feels different from the rest.

179
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,958
But I can't put
my finger on how.

180
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,958
So you've noticed Larcade,
my secret weapon.

181
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,541
The potential to defeat
Acnologia exists within him.

182
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,291
[sighs]

183
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,541
I must say, producing
Historias with the might

184
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,500
of the Spriggan Twelve
was no easy feat.

185
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:17,833
The "Eight Dragon" God Serena
has been resurrected!

186
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,416
You three are still dead.

187
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,291
But as long as I'm alive, you're
free to do what you please.

188
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,208
So it would behoove
you to protect me.

189
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,791
Let go! And just let god!

190
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:32,625
[IRENE] A million soldiers
plus the twelve of us.

191
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,416
What a sight to behold.

192
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,791
[ZEREF]
Irene.

193
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:39,083
[MAVIS] She's just as powerful
as the Wizard King.

194
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,958
[ZEREF] I'll pardon your
hasty use of Universe One.

195
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,291
In fact, I found it
worked to my benefit.

196
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,333
Oh, my.

197
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,000
In all candor,
I came here prepared

198
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,125
for a spanking
from Your Majesty.

199
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,208
However, I must ask for more.

200
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,791
A separation enchantment.

201
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,166
[IRENE]
Of course.

202
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,541
You need to remove the
Fairy Heart from this girl?

203
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,625
I mean, that is why we're here.

204
00:13:58,708 --> 00:13:59,666
[gasps]

205
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,208
[MAVIS]
What? How is that possible?

206
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,708
Irene has a rare gift
for both imbuing magic

207
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,208
and taking it away.

208
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,083
[MAVIS]
No.

209
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,708
I imagine it'll be quite
a lengthy process.

210
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,166
[ZEREF]
Yes. Then proceed.

211
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,833
[MAVIS]
Is this it?

212
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,833
All our forces are gathered
and at the ready.

213
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:22,750
How far can your grit
drive you, Fairy Tail?

214
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,833
The truth is you will not
live through tomorrow.

215
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,125
Magnolia used to be
a town full of life.

216
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,375
And our guild was at its heart.

217
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,291
But those warm and
joyous days are gone.

218
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:48,291
[NATSU snoring]

219
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,833
I'll take all the fish.
So yummy.

220
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:57,000
Cherish those dreams.
And rest well.

221
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:04,750
[ERZA] Because this may be the
final dawn we face together.

222
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:09,041
We'll need our strength.
And each other.

223
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:13,041
[NATSU] The final one?
Not if I can help it.

224
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,333
It'll be tough.

225
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,750
But Fairy Tail isn't
gonna give up that easily.

226
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,375
Come on, let's go.

227
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:22,208
[NATSU] We'll bust in
and get our guild back.

228
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,708
[NATSU]
For the sake of our future.

229
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,125
For Fairy Tail.

230
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,583
We shall.

231
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,750
That's a whole lotta soldiers.

232
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,625
If we wanna get back home,
they're in the way.

233
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,250
We're gonna have to
fight our way through.

234
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,833
Sounds good to me.

235
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,916
It's obvious we're
heavily outnumbered,

236
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,875
so we can't charge in
headlong without a plan.

237
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,208
But what?

238
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:57,541
Come on! We'll have backup
before you even know it!

239
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,500
No way these jerks'll stop us!

240
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,833
Yes, you're right, Natsu.
Let's move forward.

241
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,583
When the others get here,

242
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,208
we'll push harder until
we reach the guild!

243
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,708
When we do, Master Mavis'll
be waiting for us.

244
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,208
So who's gonna beat
Zeref first, huh?

245
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,875
Let's make it a race, Natsu!

Doesn't sound like there's
much in there to me.

250
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,041
You're a demon of
the Book of Zeref.

You'll die, too.

I won't let Natsu die!

00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,250
Whoa.

321
00:20:56,333 --> 00:21:00,291
[WIZARD D]
Uhh. Did we just get saved?

322
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,541
What happened? Who did that?

323
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:13,333
My spells disappeared.
Or more like... they shattered!

324
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,583
[gasps]

325
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,000
[gasps]

326
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:27,166
[ALL gasp]

327
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,958
[chuckles]

328
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,375
Yo.

329
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,708
--It's Gildarts!
--[HAPPY laughs]

330
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,875
[BOTH chuckles]

331
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,416
I'm feelin' hungry.

332
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,125
I wanna go back to the guild
hall and have a snack.

333
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,333
[stomach growls]

334
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,416
[LUCY] Gildarts is back,
and he smashes a path

335
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,291
straight through to Fairy Tail.

336
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:43,916
But trying to follow
in his footsteps

337
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,666
is easier said than done.

338
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,958
Especially with the re-assembled
and re-animated Spriggan Twelve

339
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:51,000
vowing to stop us.

340
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,541
We're in danger of losing
the Fairy Heart for good,

341
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,333
along with Master Mavis.

342
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:59,375
Can we overcome the odds
and live to see another day?

343
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:02,041
Next Time: "The Winter Wizard."

344
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:06,083
Beneath the ice and snow
lies the promise of spring.
