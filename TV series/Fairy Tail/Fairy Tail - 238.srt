1
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:23,916
[MAKAROV] What exactly does
this "Face" of yours do?

2
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,500
I understand that
this is a secret.

3
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:31,708
But no one's left to make use
of your knowledge but us.

4
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:37,500
Face is an anti-magic
pulse bomb.

5
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:41,875
This device can clear our
continent of any trace of magic.

6
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,833
A weapon that can
erase all magic?

7
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,416
That's horrible!

8
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,875
[gasps]

9
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,416
That would give Magic Deficiency
Syndrome to every wizard alive.

10
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,833
It gets even worse.

11
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:57,791
The demon that Natsu
fought told us that

12
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:01,000
Tartaros members use
curses instead of magic.

13
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:04,458
So, Face's activation would
wipe out every guild but theirs.

14
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,041
Every wizard who
stands against them

15
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:09,541
would find themselves
helpless and in agony.

16
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:12,625
What a deplorable weapon
your council has made.

17
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:16,916
[MICHELLO whimpers]

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,125
You tell me where
it is right now.

19
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:22,125
That thing never should've
existed in the first place!

20
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:25,708
I... I really don't know.

21
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,500
Please forgive me.

22
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:28,875
[MICHELLO]
From what I heard,

23
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:31,375
it was sealed away by three
former council members.

24
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:34,250
They did this by means
of body link magic.

25
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,541
I have no idea who
those members are.

26
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:39,583
Only the former chairman
can tell you that.

27
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,333
So, what the heck
is body link magic?

28
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:45,750
It's the kind that Brain used
to keep Zero sealed away.

29
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:49,083
So, all they gotta do is knock
off a few more council members,

30
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:51,000
and then they can
eliminate all magic?

31
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:52,250
Screw that!

32
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:53,750
[MAKAROV] We need to get
those three protected

33
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:56,958
as fast as we can. You said
that the former chairman

34
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:59,000
can tell us who they are, yes?

35
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,875
Yes. I'm all but certain.

36
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,000
[MAKAROV]
Drop everything else!

37
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,666
Find out where that
chairman lives!

38
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,791
We can assume that Tartaros
is looking for him as well.

39
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,083
Beat them!

40
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,291
We're on it, sir! We've
located the addresses

41
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,666
of 16 other former
council members.

42
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,208
We've got people from our guild,
and a couple others,

43
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,958
on the way to protect them.

44
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,125
Turns out that one
of those addresses

45
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:25,750
was the former chairman's!

46
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,833
Send someone to him,
as quickly as possible!

47
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,375
[LAKI]
One step ahead of you, sir.

48
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,041
They're already en route!

49
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,791
[LAKI] The two best
wizards we could send.

50
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,375
Hey, listen...

51
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,541
You know that Jellal is
one of their targets, too.

52
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,916
If you'd rather be guarding him,
I can handle the chairman.

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,041
For one thing, Jellal is
quite tough to track down.

54
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,333
Even if he is found,
he's more than capable

55
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:05,125
of defending himself.
I'll find him.

56
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,500
But our first priority is
protecting the chairman.

57
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,083
That's true.

58
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,958
His life is tied to that of
every wizard alive right now.

59
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,416
[CRAWFORD] I've gotten
to spend a lot more time

60
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,125
on my hobbies since retiring.

61
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,500
This chamomile is
fresh from my garden.

62
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:43,791
Thanks for sharing!

63
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:47,291
A lovely parf-- [coughs]
Smells lovely.

64
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,541
[CRAWFORD]
The ancients first tried it

65
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,250
because it smells of apples.

66
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,250
Excuse me. I realize
how rude this is to ask,

67
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,833
especially of such
esteemed guests,

68
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,916
but how did you locate my home?

69
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,375
I apologize for invading
your privacy, sir.

70
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,833
But as your life was in danger,

71
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,916
our guild put every resource
it had into finding you.

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,583
And then sent two
of its members to

73
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,875
my allegedly "secret"
doorstep without warning.

74
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,458
A letter might've sufficed.

75
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:13,958
[ERZA]
Sorry for the intrusion.

76
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,416
[CRAWFORD]
There's no need for that.

77
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,458
My days of scolding young
wizards are far in the past.

78
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:22,375
[laughs] Though I believe
I have seen you in court.

79
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,416
[gasps]

80
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,041
[FROG LAWYER]
The defendant, Erza Scarlet,

81
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,916
now stands before the court.

82
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,583
Eyewitness reports
have described

83
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,875
a heavily armored
female wizard who--

84
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:34,916
[FROG LAWYER grunts]

85
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,916
I am the all-powerful Erza!

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,291
[CRAWFORD sighs]
Just take them away.

87
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,958
I... I'm sorry about
this, your honor.

88
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,000
I can scarcely
bear the shame.

89
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,041
It's all in the past now.

90
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,625
I'm glad you're well.

91
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,500
I'd heard that your
guild spent seven years

92
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,583
in suspended
animation after that.

93
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,750
If I may sir, we have
some questions.

94
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,125
[CRAWFORD]
Yes, I'm sure you do.

95
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,875
You wish to know
about Face, correct?

96
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,791
[CRAWFORD] I was deeply
saddened to hear about

97
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,625
the demise of my
former colleagues.

98
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,333
Seeing as the Council,
itself is out of commission,

99
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,125
it is truly a blessing that
such noble-minded guilds

100
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:19,416
as your own remain to defend
us from this terrible threat.

101
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Fairy Tail's first objective
is to destroy this Face

102
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,333
before Tartaros
can make use of it.

103
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,041
If you could tell us
where it's being kept,

104
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,541
that'd be a great help.

105
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:28,875
I'd like nothing more,

106
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,625
but I can't tell you
what I don't know.

107
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,500
Listen, sir...

108
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,583
[CRAWFORD] Perhaps you think
I'm unwilling to tell you

109
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,416
because this information
is classified. But truly,

110
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,916
not even I was informed
of the location of Face.

111
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,458
We've cause to think that
Tartaros already knows.

112
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,750
But if not even you were told,
then how could they?

113
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,791
[CRAWFORD]
Strange indeed. I wish I knew.

114
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,000
Yes, as do we.
But in lieu of that,

115
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,541
could you tell us the names of
the three former council members

116
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:56,916
who're connected to Face?

117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,958
We will do everything in our
power to keep them safe.

118
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,583
I wasn't given access to
that knowledge either.

119
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,708
But why not?

120
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:08,541
This weapon, it could
devastate the entire world.

121
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,750
Thus, we sought to minimize
the number of people

122
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,416
who knew of its existence.

123
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,541
And told no one whose bodies
were made to seal it.

124
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,583
Not even the councilmen who
were picked for the task.

125
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:22,208
We hoped that these precautions
would help us protect Face.

126
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,875
So there's no way to know?

127
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,750
In that case, Tartaros
really will have to

128
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,791
slaughter every council member--

129
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,750
What? Something wrong?

130
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,125
It seems you have
a few more guests.

131
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,500
They've surrounded
the residence.

132
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,000
It sounds like...

133
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,875
...around twenty men.

134
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,250
[MIRAJANE] You should
find a safer room, sir.

135
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,708
[CRAWFORD]
It's Tartaros. Come to kill me!

136
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:46,458
You ready?

137
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:47,500
[MIRAJANE]
Mm.

138
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:52,583
[TARTAROS MINIONS]
Ahh!

139
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,458
[ERZA, MIRAJANE grunt]

140
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,458
[TARTAROS MINIONS scream]

141
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,875
You shall not harm
the ex-chairman.

142
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,291
I don't think we've ever
fought on the same side before.

143
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,875
There was Twilight Ogre.

144
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,041
But that was more
of a smack down.

145
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,708
[ELFMAN groaning]

146
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:28,416
Let her go! Don't do this!
Don't make me hurt my sister!

147
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,000
Lisanna!

148
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:34,666
I'll find a way to fix this,
just stay strong!

149
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,083
Make it stop! I'll do
anything! I beg you!

150
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,875
Beg me?

151
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,958
Begging implies that you've
nothing to offer in return,

152
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:49,125
but you do have something.
Something precious.

153
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:52,708
If her life is worth so much,
then I'll let you buy it,

154
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,375
with your soul!

155
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,875
They want a weapon.

156
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,708
One that makes Etherion
look like a cap gun.

157
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:15,583
Called Face.

158
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,875
At least that's what I've heard.

159
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,833
It has the power
to remove all magic

160
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,208
from the face of this continent.

161
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:29,041
[DORANBOLT]
I can't let that happen.

162
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,666
I will crush Tartaros.

163
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,541
No matter what it takes.

164
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:42,583
[COBRA sighs] There's nothin'
quite like the sound of freedom.

165
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,000
You know?

166
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,000
Really? Way to ruin the moment.

167
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,125
Cut him some slack,
he did get us out.

168
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,416
True. Thanks to your work,

169
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,875
we can enjoy this
lovely scene together.

170
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,166
You're my hero.

171
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,125
You've done quite well.

172
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:01,708
I never would've taken you for
such a shrewd negotiator, Cobra.

173
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,458
[laughs]

174
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,416
Long live the Oración Seis!

175
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,083
We shall-- Ahh!

176
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:12,250
[ALL gasp]

177
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,166
[BRAIN groans]

178
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,500
[COBRA]
I'm sorry, Midnight.

179
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,375
But it's time you realized,

180
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,833
Brain ain't who
he pretends to be.

181
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:24,416
All that fatherly
crap is just a lie.

182
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,291
We were never more than pawns.

183
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,416
You're right.

184
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,083
He violated our trust.

185
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,916
He had to be eliminated.

186
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,208
Sleep well, "father".

187
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,083
You brought us together.

188
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,791
That's the only thing
I'll thank you for.

189
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:42,625
So, now, we can do
whatever we want.

190
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,416
I could kill for a hot bath.

191
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,916
I plan to find out what's
become of my brother.

192
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,750
Go for it. But first,
we deal with this.

193
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,875
[DORANBOLT] They're in
your hands now, Jellal.

194
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:23,916
It's my debt to pay.
I'll do it in full.

195
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,291
[NATSU]
Huh?!

196
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,375
You're still hurt,
Natsu! Calm down!

197
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,333
You really should be resting.

198
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,291
[whimpering]

199
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,750
[NATSU]
Where's the old Chairman?

200
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:34,750
Spill it!

201
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,166
[MICHELLO whimpers]

202
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,458
Full speed!

203
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:40,583
[HAPPY]
Aye, sir!

204
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,416
[LUCY]
Wait a second!

205
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,708
[WENDY]
He never does.

206
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,208
[ERZA]
That the last of them?

207
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,083
[MIRAJANE]
Yeah. Nice work.

208
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,875
Rather odd though, isn't it?

209
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,958
That they went down this easily?

210
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,458
[ERZA]
Control of the former chairman

211
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,750
should be Tartaros'
top priority.

212
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,750
But these men are
ordinary soldiers.

213
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,041
Shouldn't they
have sent a demon?

214
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,916
[HAPPY]
What's this about, Natsu?

215
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,833
Man! How did I not
realize this before now?

216
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,625
No one, not even members
of the current council,

217
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,083
should've known where those
former councilmen were.

218
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,208
Or where this "Face" thing is!

219
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,541
So how the hell did
Tartaros find out?

220
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:25,625
[MIRAJANE]
Erza, I--

221
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,083
Something the matter?

222
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:30,083
[MIRAJANE]
I don't feel so...

223
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,791
Mira! U-Uh..

224
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,250
[NATSU] They didn't figure
this stuff out on their own.

225
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,791
Someone must've told 'em!

226
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,291
[HAPPY]
But who would do that?

227
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:42,416
[NATSU] I'm not sure, but
it must be someone powerful.

228
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,875
Someone high up in the Council.

229
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,916
I hope I'm wrong, but...

230
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,541
Just hurry! We've
gotta get to Erza!

231
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,541
[CRAWFORD]
Chairman Crawford reporting.

232
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:02,000
We need to move before my cover
is blown. I have prisoners too.

233
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,375
Well done, Former Chairman.

234
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,250
Could you bring them back
to the Guild Hall for me?

235
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,208
[NATSU]
That's the place, Happy!

236
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,375
[HAPPY]
Got it!

237
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,041
[NATSU]
We might be too late.

238
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,500
[foot steps]

239
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,500
Erza!

240
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:37,750
Mira!

241
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,583
No one's here.

242
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,958
[NATSU]
Yeah.

243
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:46,541
They haven't been gone long
though, I can smell 'em.

244
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,208
What could've happened to them?

245
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,291
[HAPPY] I don't smell Erza,
but I do smell burning herbs.

246
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,333
[NATSU]
There's something else.

247
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,916
[NATSU] Smells like
it's laced with some drug.

248
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,125
[HAPPY]
Like a knock-out drug?

249
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,375
You don't think they
got kidnapped, do you?

250
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,125
[NATSU]
Cowards!

251
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,083
Calm down!
The house didn't do it!

252
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,541
Plus, it belongs to that
big-shot former chairman!

253
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,750
It's the former chairman

254
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,291
who's been workin'
with Tartaros, Happy.

255
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,333
Then, he's the whole
reason we're in this mess!

256
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,750
Mira and Erza came to help him.
They didn't have a clue!

257
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:30,708
In that case, he probably
caught 'em by surprise.

258
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,750
[NATSU] Yeah, but
we're gonna find them.

259
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,666
[HAPPY] He must've burned those
herbs to throw us off his scent.

260
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,208
Nothin' stops a
Dragon Slayer's nose!

261
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,375
[ERZA gasps]

262
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,541
[KYOKA]
You've awoken. Good.

263
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,666
What is this?

264
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,541
[KYOKA] You're a captive
of Tartaros now.

265
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,125
What'd you do with Mira?

266
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,791
And the ex-chairman!
You took them too?

267
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:13,041
Crawford is ours all right,
but no one "took" him.

268
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,541
He's our comrade, you see?

269
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,416
And a surprisingly
useful one, at that.

270
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,666
It's all thanks to him

271
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,958
that we procured such
a fine specimen as you.

272
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:25,500
You're lying! The former
chairman would never betray us!

273
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,916
[KYOKA] Oh, but he would,
and he did. Struggle away.

274
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,458
Your shackles are infused
with bane particles.

275
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,291
So, good luck using
magic right now.

276
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,708
[ERZA]
Why isn't Mira here?!

277
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,541
What have you done with her?!

278
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,833
I've kept her alive.

279
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,125
Actually, I'm about
to improve her.

280
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,041
She'll make a fine slave
with a little work.

281
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,125
No!

282
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,625
Listen closely.

283
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,916
I need you to answer
a simple question.

284
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,750
Where is Jellal?

285
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,208
[ERZA gasps]

286
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,958
Fall back. This is my fight.

287
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,916
But there are five
of them! Let me help!

288
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,666
[JELLAL]
No. I'll handle this myself.

289
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,583
We've been underestimated
before, but this is just rude.

290
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,000
Arrogant's the word.

291
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:20,375
Well, that explains it.
You're Doranbolt's backup plan.

292
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,958
Come here to beat
us all senseless

293
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,875
and throw us back in prison?

294
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:28,125
I'm an escaped convict, myself.
I know better than that.

295
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,125
Yeah, we don't care what
you think you know.

296
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,750
We aren't giving up our freedom.

297
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,708
Try to take it and you die.

298
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,291
Aww. Surely, we can
work something out.

299
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,791
I only live for love.

300
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,750
What's the point of all this
violence? Let's be friends.

301
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,208
What's wrong with you?

302
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,083
It's like you're still sick
in the head from Nirvana.

303
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,500
Au contraire!

304
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:46,833
My head's not in charge.

305
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,583
No, I follow my heart,
and my heart has spoken!

306
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,916
I couldn't hurt that fine man
to save my life. Oh yeah!

307
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,875
After all I've done for you.

308
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:55,875
[MIDNIGHT]
Let it go.

309
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,375
Why should we?

310
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,875
We fought to gain freedom
and now we have it.

311
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:04,666
Richard's no exception to that.
It's his choice to fight or not.

312
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,666
My true name is Macbeth.

313
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,041
And I'll destroy whoever
would deny me my freedom.

314
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,416
Come.

315
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,375
Thought you'd never ask!
I was getting' kinda antsy!

316
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,625
Careful, Jellal!

317
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,833
You're a swift one, Sawyer.

318
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,125
Nobody uses that stupid name!

319
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,125
Your movements are blaring.
This'll shut you up!

320
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,083
[COBRA growling]

321
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,416
You're rather noisy,
yourself. Right, Erik?

322
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,833
[COBRA]
Uh!

323
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,125
[COBRA groans]

324
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:37,791
Come, my angels! Devour Jellal!

325
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,750
Eat every bit of him!
Let nothing remain!

326
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:45,125
It would seem that you've
acquired a new spell, Sorano.

327
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,166
[gasps]

328
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,666
He took them all out
with one attack?

329
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:02,166
This should be entertaining.
Like the good old days.

330
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,125
[KYOKA]
The chairman tells me that

331
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,500
you and Jellal are very close.

332
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:09,625
[ERZA gasps]

333
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,583
And? Why do you care?

334
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,125
[ERZA gasps]

335
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,250
Because I need to find him.

336
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,875
[ERZA groans]

337
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:23,666
I have this special curse I
only use for interrogations.

338
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,791
It makes a home in 
your pain receptors.

339
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,791
Sets them to overdrive.

340
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,625
[ERZA groaning]

341
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:30,708
Speak.

342
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:33,250
[ERZA]
I wouldn't. Even if I knew.

343
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:44,250
[screams]

344
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:52,291
[gasping]

345
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,750
[KYOKA]
Our initial plan was

346
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:57,291
to hunt down every former
council member, one by one,

347
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:00,458
but now there's no need.

348
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,875
We've already found the names of

349
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:05,416
the three who've been
keeping Face sealed away.

350
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,041
Naturally, we've
disposed of the first two.

351
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,583
[ERZA gasping]

352
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,791
[KYOKA]
But the last eludes us.

353
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,416
You mean-- [gasps]

354
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,291
[JELLAL grunts]

355
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,291
[COBRA yells]

356
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,041
--[COBRA yells]
--[JELLAL groans]

357
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,625
[JELLAL groaning]

358
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,125
Don't do this!

359
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,541
[COBRA chuckles]

360
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,375
It took me a moment, but
I think I'm warmed up now.

361
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,625
[KYOKA]
The last seal is Jellal.

362
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,250
Once he dies, Face
will be unleashed.

363
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,833
That can't be.

364
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,250
[KYOKA]
Aww, did I say too much?

365
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,208
Chances are you'll never
tell me where he is now.

366
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,583
Even if you do know.

367
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,916
I don't!

368
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,875
Jellal and I haven't spoken
in a very long time!

369
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,291
[KYOKA]
Perhaps that's true.

370
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,416
But if you do know
and you tell me,

371
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,625
I'll let your comrade go free.

372
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,458
But if you don't...

373
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,875
[ERZA screams]

374
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:08,458
[ERZA panting]

375
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,833
Then, the both of you
will have to die.

376
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm telling the truth.
I really don't know!

377
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,583
Let her go.

378
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:19,791
You can kill... me instead.

379
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:20,625
Please...

380
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,375
[KYOKA]
There's no hurry.

381
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:26,458
You have liters of blood to
lose before you have to decide.

382
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,583
[CRAWFORD]
How dare they vandalize

383
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:30,625
the home of their Chairman!

384
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:31,666
[FRANMALTH]
Yes, well technically,

385
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,208
you're their former Chairman.

386
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,791
[CRAWFORD]
I got a pension from the council

387
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,958
before I helped you destroy it.
Now, that's gone with my home!

388
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,791
Pension? You're about
to have more jewel

389
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:44,458
than even you could find
a way to spend. [laughs]

390
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:47,458
I suppose I can always say
that Tartaros destroyed it.

391
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,333
Make sure the firebug's
too dead to contradict me.

392
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,666
Then, they'll really
think I've been kidnapped.

393
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,958
Speaking of, how are
my prisoners?

394
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,666
[FRANMALTH] Lady Kyoka's
begun her torture process.

395
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,916
They'll have a gruesome
end, no doubt.

396
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,291
Make sure they die!

397
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,875
If those two were to
escape somehow and

398
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,083
speak of what I've done for you,

399
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,916
I'd lose my shot at
becoming Chairman again!

400
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,625
You can rest easy.
They aren't going anywhere.

401
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:09,875
And on top of that,

402
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:12,166
no one's ever gonna
find us in this place.

403
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,250
Say, what is that thing?

404
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,333
[FRANMALTH]
Uh? Uh...

405
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:21,541
[FRANMALTH laughs]

406
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:22,833
It's headed right for us!

407
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,375
[FRANMALTH screams]

408
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,666
You just said that no
one would find us here!

409
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,833
Well, no one's found us before!

410
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,916
Where the hell are my friends?!

411
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:15,625
[LUCY] Having located
Tartaros' headquarters,

412
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:17,291
Natsu launches
a one-man assault

413
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:19,500
in the hopes of rescuing
Erza and Mira.

414
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,500
Back at the Guild Hall,
the rest of us strive to

415
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:25,083
find out everything we can
about this new enemy.

416
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:27,083
As Jellal continues
his desperate battle

417
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,458
against the Oración Seis,

418
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:32,708
he reveals to them a secret
that they won't forget.

419
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:37,166
Next time, Tartaros Chapter:
Jellal vs. Oración Seis.

420
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,875
We've all spun our webs.

421
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:41,583
And when they collide,
there will be strife.
