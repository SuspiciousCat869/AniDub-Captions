1
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:19,750
- Natsu:
PREVIOUSLY ON "FAIRY TAIL...."

2
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,791
- Lucy: THAT REPORTER
FROM "SORCERER WEEKLY"

3
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,416
WAS SOMETHING ELSE, WASN'T HE?
- Happy: HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,291
WANT ANYTHING
TO DO WITH YOU, LUCY.

5
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:27,375
- Lucy: DON'T LAUGH.
OF COURSE I'M GLAD

6
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,500
THINGS ARE FINALLY
SETTLING DOWN AROUND HERE.

7
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,208
- Natsu: YOU THINK?
EVERYTHING SEEMS THE SAME TO ME.

8
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:34,750
- Happy: ESPECIALLY ON THE
LUCY-HAVING-NO-BOYFRIEND FRONT.

9
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:35,916
- Lucy: JUST DROP IT, OKAY?!

10
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,875
- (theme song playing )

11
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:42,750
- ( singing in Japanese )

12
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,916
- ( thunder rolls )

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,208
- Narrator: DARK AND RAINY DAYS
SUCH AS TODAY

14
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,208
ARE THANKFULLY
A RARITY IN MAGNOLIA.

15
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:18,500
BUT IN A PERPETUALLY DARK
AND GLOOMY PART OF TOWN, 

16
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:21,750
THERE STANDS A DISREPUTABLE
POTION SHOP.

17
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,416
- DRIP, DRIP, DROP.

18
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,208
- OH? YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING

19
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,041
THAT'LL MAKE
A BOY NOTICE YOU?

20
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:37,833
MY CONCOCTIONS CAN'T BE TAILORED
TO SUCH SPECIFIC NEEDS.

21
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,833
- PLEASE, SIR.
IF HE WOULD GAZE AT ME

22
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,416
WITH PASSIONATE EYES JUST ONCE,

23
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,708
EVEN THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH.

24
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,833
- WELL, I DO HAVE SOMETHING
THAT MIGHT DO THE TRICK.

25
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:52,500
TRY THIS.  IT'LL DO
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'VE ASKED.

26
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:53,500
- WHAT IS IT?

27
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,375
- THIS WOULD ENSURE YOUR MAN

28
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,333
BURNS WITH A DESIRE
ONLY FOR YOU.

29
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:00,916
60,000 JEWEL.
- SEEMS RATHER PRICEY.

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,541
- I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO HAGGLE, YOUNG LADY.

31
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,500
DID I MENTION
IT'S 100% EFFECTIVE?

32
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:09,625
- 100%? BURNING WITH DESIRE?

33
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,916
I'LL TAKE
THE WHOLE BOTTLE, SIR.

34
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,083
DRIP, DRIP, DROP.

35
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,000
- Narrator:
NO ONE KNEW AT THE TIME,

36
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,166
BUT THE SUSPICIOUS POTION
JUVIA PURCHASED

37
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,750
ON THAT RARE RAINY DAY
AT FULL PRICE

38
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,375
WITHOUT ANY KIND
OF NEGOTIATION WHATSOEVER

39
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,333
WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR BRINGING FAIRY TAIL

40
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,708
TO THE VERY BRINK
OF DESTRUCTION.

41
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:35,500
- ( Happy speaking )

42
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,791
- UGH, I'M SO BORED.

43
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,000
- HOW ABOUT CHECKING
THE BOARD FOR A NEW JOB?

44
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,875
- I'D LIKE TO,
BUT NATSU KEEPS SAYING

45
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,583
THAT HE NEEDS TO TAKE
A LITTLE TIME OFF.

46
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,125
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GO ON ONE BY YOURSELF?

47
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,125
OR MAYBE TEAM UP WITH
SOMEBODY DIFFERENT?

48
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:55,125
- HMM, IT'D BE TOO WEIRD 
WORKING WITH ANYONE ELSE.

49
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,916
WE'RE A TEAM.
WE SHOULD STICK TOGETHER.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,833
- YOU TWO ARE SO LOYAL
TO ONE ANOTHER.

51
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,208
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
YOU'RE A COUPLE.

52
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,083
- UGH! IT'S SO NOT LIKE THAT!

53
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,666
- WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW.

54
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,083
DEEP DOWN, NATSU MIGHT
HAVE FEELINGS FOR YOU.

55
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,583
- UH...

56
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,166
- ( laughs )
- NA, NA, NA.

57
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,291
NA, NA, NA, NA, NA.

58
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,291
- YEAH, EVEN IF
THAT WERE THE CASE,

59
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,166
I'M AFRAID I WOULD
HAVE TO PASS.

60
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,416
- I THINK YOU TWO
WOULD BE ADORABLE TOGETHER.

61
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:24,083
- ( laughing )
- NA, NA, NA, NA...

62
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,875
- COME ON, NATSU,
QUIT GOOFING AROUND

63
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,416
AND LET'S GET
BACK TO WORK!

64
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,125
 - WOULD YOU PUT SOME
CLOTHES ON ALREADY?! 

65
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,541
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!

66
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,666
DID YOUR POWERS FINALLY 
BURN THAT BRAIN OF YOURS

67
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,250
INTO A LUMP OF CHARCOAL?

68
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,875
- HEY, DON'T BE SUCH A KILLJOY.

69
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,750
IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE A BREAK
NOW AND THEN.

70
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,791
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, HAPPY?
- ( humming )

71
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,416
AYE, SIR.  THIS SURE
FEELS GREAT.

72
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,125
- AND NOW THE FINALE.

73
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,541
- Both:
CHICKA, CHICKA, CHICKA!

74
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,291
CHICKA, CHICKA, CHICKA!
CHICKA, CHICKA, CHICKA!

75
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,250
- DEFINITELY A PASS.

76
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,583
- BUT I THINK 
THE TWO OF YOU

77
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,166
WOULD MAKE
A PERFECT COUPLE.

78
00:04:56,291 --> 00:05:00,583
- MY BELOVED GRAY, ALL I ASK 
IS FOR ONE PASSIONATE GLANCE.

79
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,458
AWW, MY HEART
IS BEATING SO FAST!

80
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,000
AH, I'M SHAKING 
FROM HEAD TO TOE

81
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,666
JUST THINKING ABOUT IT.
OH, THE ANTICIPATION!

82
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,791
- BUT I THINK THE TWO OF YOU
WOULD MAKE A PERFECT COUPLE.

83
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,083
- NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

84
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,458
I WISH MIRA WOULD KEEP
HER CRAZY SUGGESTIONS 

85
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,416
TO HERSELF FOR ONCE.

86
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,500
- I'M TELLING YOU.
BE CAREFUL.

87
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:24,500
- Lucy: AT LEAST I'M HOME.

88
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:25,750
WHAT THE--
- YO.

89
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,500
- WOULD YOU STOP
BREAKING INTO MY HOUSE?

90
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,625
- I'M SORRY, BUT THERE'S
SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT

91
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,416
I NEED TO TELL YOU.
- OH, MAN.

92
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,958
LET ME GUESS, YOU DON'T 
WANT TO GO BACK TO WORK.

93
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,041
( gasps )

94
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,791
- Narrator: "LIKE?!"

95
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,125
- WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW.

96
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,416
NATSU MIGHT HAVE 
FEELINGS FOR YOU.

97
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,708
- ( gasping )

98
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,125
( shrieks )

99
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,791
- HMM?

100
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,875
- OH, WOULD YOU 
PLEASE GET OUT?!

101
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,375
- BUT I GOT TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

102
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,166
- SOMETHING IMPORTANT?

103
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,416
GET OUT OF HERE!

104
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,958
- HUH? WHOA.

105
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,083
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

106
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,750
THERE'S NO NEED TO BE RUDE.

107
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,875
- WOULD YOU GO OUT
THROUGH THE DOOR, YOU DOPE?

108
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:12,625
- OH NO.
WHY DO I FEEL SO FUNNY?

109
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,333
- Narrator: THE NEXT DAY...

110
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,291
- ( chewing )

111
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,666
( sighs )

112
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,125
WHAT'LL I DO TODAY?

113
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,916
- HEY, YA!

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,625
- ( muffled scream )
- SO HOW'S IT GOING?

115
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,291
- HANDS OFF! PLEASE DON'T

116
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,833
JUST DRAPE YOURSELF
OVER ME LIKE THAT. 

117
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,458
- HOLD ON, WHAT?

118
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,375
- WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
THIS ISN'T GOOD.

119
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,958
I CAN'T GET THESE
STUPID THOUGHTS OUT OF MY HEAD.

120
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:37,000
- NATSU, I'M SICK OF THIS!

121
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,166
STOP ACTING LIKE AN IDIOT!

122
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,666
- WHAT DOES IT
MATTER TO YOU, HUH?

123
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,375
YOU WANT A PIECE OF ME?
- LET'S RUMBLE!

124
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:46,625
- ( grunting )
- MY BELOVED GRAY,

125
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,916
YESTERDAY, I WAS SO NERVOUS,
I COULD BARELY EVEN MOVE,

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,416
BUT, TODAY, I'VE GOT THE COURAGE
TO GO THROUGH WITH MY PLAN.

127
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,375
SO HOW EXACTLY DOES
THIS POTION WORK?

128
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,750
- ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS BLOW THE BUBBLES 

129
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,875
RIGHT TOWARDS
THE MAN YOU DESIRE

130
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,916
AND MAKE SURE
HE INHALES THEM.

131
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,125
IF YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL,
YOUR INTENDED WILL BECOME AWARE

132
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,083
OF THE FEELINGS YOU HAVE
DEEP WITHIN YOUR HEART,

133
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,875
PROVIDED THEY ARE STRONG ENOUGH.

134
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,666
- ( growling )

135
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,375
- ( cheering )
- DEAR SWEET GRAY,

136
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,333
THE LESS YOU NOTICE
MY BLAZING HEART,

137
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,583
THE BRIGHTER MY FLAMES
OF LOVE BECOME.

138
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,083
AND WHEN I'M NEAR YOU,

139
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,833
I'M CONSUMED BY
LUSTFUL TEMPTATION.

140
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,541
BUT THINGS ARE ABOUT TO CHANGE.

141
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,125
ONE TASTE OF THIS POTION
AND YOU'LL FINALLY BE MINE!

142
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,041
OUR TWO HEARTS
WILL BECOME AS ONE.

143
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,666
FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, 
WE'LL BE SWEETHEARTS...

144
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,625
FOREVER.

145
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,666
- WHA-- I TOTALLY FORGOT.

146
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,166
I GOT TO GO TAKE CARE
OF SOMETHING.

147
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,833
- WHAT KIND OF 
EXCUSE IS THAT?

148
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,375
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE THIS,

149
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,291
BUT I THINK NATSU'S GOT
A CRUSH ON SOME GIRL.

150
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:47,125
- WAIT, YOU MEAN OUR NATSU?
- THERE'S NO WAY, MAN.

151
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,625
- YOU GOT TO BE JOKING.

152
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,250
HE'S THE LAST GUY
I'D EVER IMAGINE

153
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,208
GETTING TANGLED UP
WITH SOME CHICK.

154
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,041
- I KNOW WHAT I HEARD, GUYS.

155
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,458
LATELY, HE'S BEEN 
SAYING STUFF LIKE,

156
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,166
"I WANT TO SEE HER.
I GOT TO SEE HER." 

157
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,625
- "HER" WHO?
- BEATS ME.

158
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,166
- OH CRAP!
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?!

159
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,875
I'M THE "HER!"

160
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,125
IT'S NOT LIKE I HATE HIM
OR ANYTHING.

161
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,375
I'M JUST NOT SURE
IF WE'D BE COMPATIBLE.

162
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,375
OF COURSE I'VE NEVER GONE OUT
WITH A BOY BEFORE,

163
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,458
SO HOW CAN I REALLY 
BE SURE OF ANYTHING?

164
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,000
- I WANT TO SEE YOU.

165
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,416
- LET'S STOP IMAGINING HIM

166
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,875
LOOKING ALL HUNKY
LIKE THAT, OKAY? 

167
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,333
- ( chuckles )
- ( giggles )

168
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:24,416
WHY ARE ALL THESE CRAZY THOUGHTS
RUNNING THROUGH MY BRAIN?!

169
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,333
- HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

170
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,166
- UH.  UH...

171
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,166
( weakly )
YEAH, I'M FINE.

172
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,958
- CAN YOU MEET ME TONIGHT?

173
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,583
THERE'S SOMETHING IMPORTANT
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU.

174
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,125
- ( screams )

175
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,875
- WHAT DO YOU SAY WE MEET
MY BY THE SOLA TREE

176
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,500
IN THE MIDDLE OF
SOUTH GATE PARK?

177
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,791
- I CAN DO THAT, BUT CAN
YOU TELL ME WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

178
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,583
- ALL I CAN SAY
IS IT'S IMPORTANT.

179
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,750
MAKE SURE
YOU COME ALONE TONIGHT.

180
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,458
- IS HE BLUSHING?

181
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,416
HE IS.
HE'S ACTUALLY BLUSHING.

182
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,958
- LATER.
- UH... 

183
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,541
UH, HEY, MIRA,

184
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,500
I'M JUST GONNA GO HOME
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY.

185
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,541
- COME BACK! HEY!

186
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,708
I WASN'T THROUGH WITH YOU.
- I'M HERE, MY LOVE.

187
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,750
GIVE ME YOUR PASSIONATE GAZE.

188
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:08,791
( blows )

189
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:09,958
- YOU CAN'T JUST RUN AWAY

190
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,375
IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT.

191
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,041
- ( sniffing )

192
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,541
( sneezes )

193
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,500
- OKAY, LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN.

194
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,500
( blows )

195
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,291
- ( laughter )

196
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,333
- ( blows )

197
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,500
OH, MY DARLING,
WHY MUST YOU KEEP MOVING?

198
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,916
AT THIS RATE,
EVERYONE IN THE GUILD

199
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,208
WILL BE INFATUATED 
WITH ME EXCEPT YOU.

200
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,125
WOW, THAT'S
A DISTURBING THOUGHT.

201
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,416
GRAY, MY LOVE!

202
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:40,750
( blows )

203
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:41,875
- ( yawns )

204
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,291
- I DID IT.

205
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,750
- ( swallows )

206
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,125
- ( gasps )

207
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,791
- WHOA, WHAT IS THIS
STRANGE SENSATION I'M FEELING?

208
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:58,583
- I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS MOMENT.

209
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,625
FINALLY MY BELOVED GRAY

210
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,708
WILL PASSIONATELY
GAZE INTO MY EYES

211
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,750
AND SPEAK THOSE SWEET WORDS
THAT I LONG TO HEAR.

212
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,333
( gasps )

213
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,875
- ( chewing )

214
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,083
HMM?

215
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,166
- YOU'VE GOT SOME NERVE.

216
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,208
YOU'RE ALWAYS FLYING AROUND
FREE AS A BIRD,

217
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,416
TRYING TO SHOW ME UP!
- SAY WHAT?

218
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,666
- I'M INCREDIBLY STRONG,
BUT I CAN'T FLY!

219
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,041
AND YOU'RE PATHETICALLY WEAK,
BUT YOU CAN!

220
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,166
- AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
WE'RE EVEN!

221
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,500
LISTEN UP!
- ( whimpering )

222
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,291
- AS OF TODAY,
YOU ARE MY RIVAL!

223
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,708
- ( screams )

224
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,708
- WHAT IN THE HECK
HAS GOTTEN INTO HIM?

225
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,875
- COME ON, LET ME
SEE WHAT YOU GOT, CAT!

226
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,875
- SOMEBODY HELP! GRAY'S
GONE ALL CRAZY IN THE HEAD!

227
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,083
AND HE WANTS TO FIGHT ME!

228
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,041
PLEASE DON'T
LET HIM HURT ME!

229
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,583
- BUT I DON'T GET IT.

230
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,541
HE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE NOTICING ME.

231
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,500
- ( grunts )

232
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:47,208
YOU WANT TO TELL ME HOW MUCH
MONEY YOU MADE LAST MONTH?

233
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:50,125
- HA, I BET YOU IT'S MORE
THAN YOU MAKE IN A YEAR. 

234
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,375
- YOU ONLY WISH YOU COULD
MAKE AS MUCH AS I DO.

235
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,750
- GIVE ME A BREAK, MAN.

236
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,166
EVERYONE KNOWS
I'M WORTH MORE THAN YOU.

237
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,916
- REMIND ME WHY
I WASTE MY TIME

238
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,750
HANGING OUT WITH YOU.
- IT'S CAUSE YOU WANT

239
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,083
TO KEEP TABS ON
YOUR COMPETITION, EH?

240
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,625
- ( both chuckle )

241
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,166
- I DRINK YOU, ALCOHOL,
YOU DON'T DRINK ME!

242
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,583
NOW LISTEN, YOU.

243
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,833
I'M MORE THAN STRONG ENOUGH

244
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,541
TO KICK YOUR
WELL-FERMENTED HIDE.

245
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,666
WE WERE DESTINED
BY FATE TO BE RIVALS!

246
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,333
- YOU SERIOUSLY THINK
ALCOHOL'S YOUR RIVAL, MASTER?

247
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,541
THAT'S WEIRD.

248
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,000
- ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
ALL OF IT IN GENERAL

249
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,541
OR JUST THAT BARREL
IN FRONT OF YOU?

250
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,416
- YOU THINK YOU CAN DRINK ME?!
I'LL NEVER LET THAT HAPPEN!

251
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,875
( gulping )

252
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,583
- CURSE YOU, WRETCHED PILLAR!

253
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,750
WHY MUST YOU BLOCK MY PATH,

254
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,500
SHATTERING MY DREAMS OF PASSING
THROUGH HERE UNHINDERED?

255
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,375
ANSWER ME, SCOUNDREL!

256
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,666
IS SILENCE YOUR WAY OF
CHALLENGING ME TO FIGHT YOU?

257
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,000
FROM THE MOMENT I MET YOU,
I KNEW WE WOULD BE RIVALS.

258
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,833
- I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU,
BUT I DON'T THINK

259
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,125
YOU CAN BE RIVALS WITH
AN INANIMATE OBJECT, ERZA.

260
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,875
- THE ALCOHOL THING 
KIND OF MAKES SENSE,

261
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,958
BUT AGAINST A PILLAR?
THAT'S JUST CRAZY.

262
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,375
- PUT IT WOULD MAKE
SENSE IF SHE WAS

263
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,166
TALKING ABOUT
A CATERPILLAR, RIGHT?

264
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,458
- I'LL PRETEND
YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT.

265
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,166
- BRING IT ON, RED!

266
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,125
LET'S FIGHT LIKE WE USED TO
BACK IN THE OLD DAYS.

267
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,750
BUT THIS TIME,
I'M NOT HOLDING BACK

268
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,166
'CAUSE THERE'S
NO WAY I'M GONNA LOSE

269
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,000
TO MY LIFELONG RIVAL.

270
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,500
- I'M SO CONFUSED.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON!

271
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,000
NATSU, WHERE ARE YOU?!

272
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,333
- Gray: I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU!

273
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,250
BRING IT ON, CAT!

274
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,750
JUST YOU WATCH.

275
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,333
I'M GONNA FLY FARTHER
AND FASTER

276
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,958
THAN YOU EVER COULD.
- DON'T DO THIS.

277
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,166
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

278
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,000
- SHUT YOUR TRAP.
I CAN FLY.

279
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,666
ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN DO,

280
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,958
I CAN DO
100 TIMES BETTER.

281
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,541
YOU HEAR ME, CAT?
I'LL BEAT YOU!

282
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:20,750
- THIS STINKS.

283
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,750
WHY IS EVERYONE GOING CRAZY?

284
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,583
- THE OLD MAN
DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING

285
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:27,708
ABOUT THERE BEING A TIME DELAY
BEFORE THE POTION KICKS IN.

286
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,458
- Narrator: BEFORE OUR VIEWERS
GET TOO CONFUSED,

287
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,666
I THINK AN EXPLANATION
IS IN ORDER.

288
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,458
- ( chuckles )

289
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,250
THE FLASK I SOLD
THAT NAIVE GIRL 

290
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,375
WAS FILLED WITH A MIXTURE
OF BANNED POTIONS

291
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,000
I HAPPENED TO HAVE ON HAND.

292
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,791
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IT'LL DO TO THAT POOR GUY.

293
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,375
YOU MAY BE ASKING YOURSELF

294
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,125
"HOW COULD I DO
SOMETHING SO CRUEL?"

295
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,833
I'M SKIPPING TOWN TONIGHT,
SO WHY SHOULD I CARE?

296
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,500
- Narrator:
WELL, THERE YOU HAVE IT.

297
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,833
I WONDER WHAT WILL HAPPEN 
TO OUR FAIRY TAIL FRIENDS.

298
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,500
- THIS IS GETTING WEIRD.
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

299
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,041
- Natsu: WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE MEET BY THE SOLA TREE

300
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,458
IN THE MIDDLE OF
SOUTH GATE PARK?

301
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,666
ALL I CAN SAY
IS IT'S IMPORTANT.

302
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,250
MAKE SURE
YOU COME ALONE TONIGHT.

303
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,750
- WHAT THE HECK
AM I GONNA DO?

304
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,708
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT HE'S GONNA
CONFESS HIS LOVE FOR ME.

305
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,875
I'LL HAVE TO TURN HIM DOWN,

306
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,666
EVEN THOUGH
IT'LL MAKE THINGS AWKWARD

307
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,166
SINCE WE'RE
ON THE SAME TEAM AND ALL.

308
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,625
I'M SO SORRY, NATSU.

309
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:31,000
THIS IS THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY
TO WEAR MY NEW DRESS.

310
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,500
YES, I LOOK
SMOKING HOT IN THIS.

311
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:36,541
WAIT, THAT'S A BAD THING.

312
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,791
OH, DON'T BE STUPID.
WHY AM I DOING THIS?

313
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,000
WHAT AM I THINKING?
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?

314
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,208
OH, I GOT IT.

315
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:45,416
OPEN, GATE OF THE GIANT CRAB.

316
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,041
CANCER!
- ( doorbell rings )

317
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,083
- Cancer: CANCER.

318
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,000
- I WANT A SALON-PERFECT LOOK.

319
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,541
- YOU GOT IT, BABY.

320
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,083
- I SHOULDN'T BE GETTING
ALL DOLLED UP FOR HIM!

321
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,125
BUT FOR SOME REASON,
I STILL FIXED IT UP MYSELF.

322
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,583
- HEY THERE, LADY.

323
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,125
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

324
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,458
LET'S HAVE 33 BABIES TOGETHER.

325
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,416
OKAY, LUCY?
- HMM.

326
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,083
- ( cries )

327
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:20,041
- I'M ALL FIRED UP.
- ( laughs )

328
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,375
HOW COULD I EVEN
DREAM THAT UP?! 

329
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,708
AND WHY DID OUR KIDS
LOOK LIKE HAPPY?!

330
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,083
- Cana: MASTER!

331
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,875
I'VE COME TO CHALLENGE YOU!

332
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,000
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE
WHO'D WIN AT DRINKING!

333
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,375
- YOU AREN'T WORTHY
TO CALL YOURSELF MY RIVAL!

334
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,250
MY ENEMY IS ALCOHOL ITSELF!

335
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,750
- YOU'LL NEVER WIN!
( gulping )

336
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,291
- THREE AGAINST THREE IS IT?

337
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,333
YOU MAY POSSESS
THE SAME NUMBERS AS WE DO,

338
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,583
BUT OUR SKILLS ARE
CLEARLY SUPERIOR TO YOURS.

339
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,750
- WHAT KIND OF TRASH
ARE YOU TALKING?

340
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,166
EVERYONE KNOWS WE'RE
THE STRONGEST THREE-MAN TEAM.

341
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,625
YOU GUYS WANT TO FIGHT US?

342
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:53,958
- WHY DOESN'T THIS GUILD

343
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,791
HAVE ANY REAL MEN
IN IT'S RANKS?

344
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:59,708
I CAN'T FIND A WORTHY RIVAL?
THIS SITUATION MAKES ME SAD.

345
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,083
SUCH VIOLENT SADNESS...

346
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,458
- Max: SO, IS HE LOOKING FOR
A FIGHT OR FOR A MAN?

347
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,500
- Warren: I DON'T THINK I WANT
TO STICK AROUND TO FIND OUT.

348
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,541
- OKAY, YOU FINISHED
TALLYING UP YOUR NUMBERS?

349
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,000
- YEAH, I WAS DONE
A LONG TIME AGO, YOU SLOWPOKE.

350
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,625
JUST WAITING ON YOU.

351
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,458
LOOKS LIKE I'M BETTER 
THAN YOU IN EVERY WAY.

352
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:15,833
- YEAH, RIGHT, BUDDY.

353
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,041
WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO SEE ABOUT THAT.

354
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,791
- OKAY, WHEN I SAY GO...

355
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,833
- BRING IT ON!
LAST MONTH, I EARNED EXACTLY...

356
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,583
- Both: READY GO!
150,000!

357
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:25,958
( gasps )

358
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,125
WE MADE THE SAME AMOUNT?

359
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,750
WE'LL HAVE TO GO
BY THE MONTH BEFORE!

360
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,958
- OUR THUNDER LEGION
AGAINST YOUR SHADOW GEAR.

361
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,833
LET'S FIND OUT
ONCE AND FOR ALL

362
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,291
WHO THE BEST
THREE-MAN TEAM IS

363
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,791
IN ALL OF FAIRY TAIL!

364
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,458
- I HOPE YOU WON'T BE
TOO DISAPPOINTED

365
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,958
AFTER WE WIPE
THE FLOOR WITH YOU!

366
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,125
- HOW DARE YOU!
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA

367
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,375
WHO YOU'RE MESSING WITH.

368
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,500
- Both: ARE THEY
HAVING A POSE-OFF?

369
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,208
- LET'S SEE WHAT
YOU GOT, GRAMPS!

370
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:50,375
- I'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN!
- WHERE ARE ALL THE REAL MEN?!

371
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,333
- WATCH OUT, LUCY.
THAT'S DANGEROUS. 

372
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,000
- I'LL BE OKAY.
- HEY!

373
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,958
YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD
IN THAT DRESS YOU GOT ON.

374
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,625
NOW DON'T YOU GO
FALLING INTO THE RIVER

375
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,375
BEFORE YOUR BIG DATE.

376
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,000
- WAIT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "DATE"?

377
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,791
THERE'S NO DENYING.
I AM LOOKING GOOD. 

378
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:14,833
( gasps )

379
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,333
BUT IT'S NOT A DATE!

380
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,791
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW CUTE I MAY LOOK.

381
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,333
( gasps )

382
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:22,541
( sighs )

383
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,875
( grunts )

384
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,541
NO, THIS IS BAD.

385
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,458
I CAN'T START CRUSHING 
ON SOMEONE I WORK WITH.

386
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,125
BUT MAYBE BEING ON
THE SAME TEAM IS A GOOD THING.

387
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,708
WE'LL ALWAYS BE TOGETHER.

388
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,916
- WE'LL BE
TOGETHER FOREVER, LUCY.

389
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,083
- FOREVER AND EVER.

390
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,916
WHA!

391
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,833
- REQUIP: HEAVEN'S WHEEL!

392
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,250
( shouts )

393
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,583
( grunts )

394
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,041
- COME ON, ERZA,
CUT IT OUT!

395
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,125
- IT TOOK US A LONG TIME
TO REBUILD THE PLACE.

396
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,208
DON'T GO AND WRECK IT.

397
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,791
- SILENCE!

398
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,375
THIS VILE PILLAR INSISTS
ON STANDING IN MY WAY.

399
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,041
I NEED TO GO FURTHER INSIDE
AND YET IT BLOCKS MY PATH!

400
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,583
AND THEN IT SECRETLY MOCKS ME

401
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,750
WHEN I HAVE TO TAKE TIME
TO WALK AROUND IT!

402
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,750
IT'S UNRELENTING IN
IT'S OBSTRUCTION OF MY COURSE.

403
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,375
WHY WOULD IT DO THAT UNLESS
IT WAS MY GREATEST RIVAL?

404
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:08,750
- HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT

405
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,041
TAKING A DIFFERENT ROUTE
THROUGH THE HALL?

406
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,583
- I KNOW YOU'RE
SET IN YOUR WAYS,

407
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,500
BUT THIS IS A BIT MUCH.
- I THINK ERZA'S

408
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,541
FINALLY FOUND AN OPPONENT
THAT'S JUST AS STUBBORN

409
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,333
AS SHE IS.
- THAT'S TRUE.

410
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,416
- GET YOUR BUTT OVER HERE
AND FIGHT ME, ERZA.

411
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,458
IT'S TIME WE FINISH THIS
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

412
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,708
- ARE YOU BLIND? CAN'T YOU SEE
I'M IN THE MIDST OF BATTLE

413
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,916
WITH MY LIFELONG RIVAL?
- NOT REALLY.

414
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,750
IT'S JUST A PILLAR.
IT CAN'T FIGHT BACK.

415
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,583
- ( growling )
I WON'T BE IGNORED!

416
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,958
SATAN SOUL!
- Both: MIRA, NO!

417
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,916
- THAT'S IT!
REQUIP: PURGATORY ARMOR!

418
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,958
- CAN'T WE TALK
ABOUT THIS, LADIES?

419
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:42,416
- FACE MY FIERCE LYNX PUNCH!

420
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,250
- ( screams )

421
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,458
- WHERE'S MY RIVAL?

422
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,416
I'VE GOT TO FIND A REAL MAN!

423
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,333
- MOVE IT!

424
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,250
- MAN, IT'S NO USE.

425
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,125
- GUESS THE GUILD HALL'S
GONNA GET DESTROYED AGAIN.

426
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,375
- ( fighting )

427
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,791
- THEN...

428
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,708
- PLEASE, GRAY,
YOU GOT TO LISTEN TO ME.

429
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,125
THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK.

430
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,041
- SHUT YOUR FACE.
THERE'S NO WAY

431
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,041
I'M GONNA LET YOU TALK
YOUR WAY OUT OF THIS ONE.

432
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,333
- Juvia: NO, THIS ISN'T WORKING.

433
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,666
MAYBE HE NEEDS MORE POTION.
( blows )

434
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,791
- ALL RIGHT, IT'S TIME
TO DO THIS, HAPPY.

435
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,000
FOLLOW ME IF YOU CAN.

436
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,458
( screams )

437
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,250
- WOW, WHAT'S
HAPPENING TO HIM?

438
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,416
- ( grunts )

439
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,250
NOW I'M EVEN MORE FIRED UP!

440
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,458
- WHY IS HE ACTING LIKE NATSU
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

441
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,791
WATCH ME FLY.

442
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,916
( growls )

443
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,125
- ( screams )
- ( grunting )

444
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,541
I'M GONNA FLY!
JUST WATCH ME!

445
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:45,708
BEHOLD, I AM THE WIND.

446
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,708
- Narrator: THE SOLA TREE
IN THE MIDDLE

447
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,375
OF SOUTH GATE PARK.

448
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,916
 - STAY CALM.
YOU'VE GOT THIS.

449
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,291
THERE'S NO NEED
TO GET ALL NERVOUS.

450
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,833
JUST KEEP IT TOGETHER.

451
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,166
- HEY, YOU MADE IT.

452
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,500
AH! YEAH.

453
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:03,541
HE'S HERE.
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

454
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,625
- ( laughs )

455
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,500
- OH MAN, I'M SUCH A PUSHOVER

456
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,666
WHEN IT COMES TO
THIS KIND OF STUFF.

457
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,791
- ( grunts ) IT SURE 
TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH.

458
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,541
NOW HURRY UP AND SUMMON
THAT MAID OF YOURS.

459
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,625
YOU KNOW, WHAT'S HER NAME?
COME ON.

460
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,541
OH YEAH, VIRGO.

461
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,541
YOU SEE, THE GROUND HERE IS
TOO TOUGH FOR ME TO DIG THROUGH.

462
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,541
ONLY THAT CELESTIAL MAID
YOU'VE GOT COULD GET PAST IT.

463
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:31,541
- HOLD ON, YOU SAID YOU HAD
SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO SAY?

464
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,416
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE THIS,

465
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,083
BUT THERE'S AN AMAZING
TREASURE BURIED HERE. 

466
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,916
SOMEBODY TOLD ME THAT
THERE'S A PHOTO ALBUM

467
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,250
CHOCK-FULL OF
EMBARRASSING PICTURES

468
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,083
OF ALMOST EVERY MEMBER
OF FAIRY TAIL.

469
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,541
AND THEY TOLD ME THAT GRAMPS
BURIED IT HERE TO HIDE IT.

470
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,208
SO I REALLY
WANT TO DIG IT UP.

471
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,083
- UM, I HEARD YOU--

472
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,583
THAT IS,
I OVERHEARD SOMEONE SAY

473
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,250
THAT YOU HAD
A CRUSH ON A GIRL.

474
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,791
- HUH?
- EVERYONE WAS TALKING ABOUT

475
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,041
HOW YOU KEPT SAYING
"I WANT TO SEE HER."

476
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,750
- I WAS JUST
LOOKING FOR VIRGO.

477
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,958
IT'S NOT LIKE I GOT FEELINGS
FOR HER OR NOTHING.

478
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,750
I WAS REALLY JUST HOPING
I COULD GET HER

479
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,416
TO DIG THIS HOLE FOR ME.

480
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,833
- YOU WERE, HUH?

481
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,208
THAT'S IMPORTANT?!

482
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:10,208
DIGGING A HOLE?!
( growls )

483
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:13,958
- ( slaps )
- OWW! OH.

484
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,458
OH, WHOA, WHAT THE--

485
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,958
- WHAT WAS I THINKING?

486
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,291
HOW CAN I BE
SUCH AN IDIOT?

487
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,458
- Narrator: AND SO LUCY'S
BAD LUCK WITH MEN

488
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:26,333
HAS CROSSED INTO A SECOND
CONSECUTIVE EPISODE.

489
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,166
- ( rooster crows )

490
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,583
- DOES ANYONE KNOW 
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

491
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,041
- UH...

492
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,458
- Both: IT'S FINALLY OVER.

493
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:42,708
- COME ON.

494
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,166
GEEZ, IT'S MORNING ALREADY.

495
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,791
YOU REALLY GOT TO
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER.

496
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,666
JUVIA, MAYBE YOU CAN
KNOCK SOME SENSE INTO HIM.

497
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,458
- MY DARLING GRAY,
OH, PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

498
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,625
I'M THE REASON YOU HAD
TO SUFFER THROUGH ALL OF THIS.

499
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:01,041
IT'S CLEAR NOW WHY THE POTION
DIDN'T WORK PROPERLY.

500
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,125
IT CAN ONLY BE THAT
MY FEELINGS FOR YOU

501
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,375
WEREN'T QUITE STRONG ENOUGH.

502
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,416
MY BELOVED.
- HEY, JUVIA.

503
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?

504
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,250
- THANK GOODNESS
YOU'RE WELL AGAIN.

505
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,708
- SHE LOVES YOU.

506
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,958
- I WAS WONDERING WHY
I FELT SO COLD ALL OF A SUDDEN.

507
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,500
I ALWAYS END UP SOAKING WET
WHEN YOU'RE AROUND.

508
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:29,625
YOU KNOW I HATE THAT.

509
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:32,291
- HEARTBREAKING,
HOW CAN HE BE SO COLD?

510
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,375
- HUH? IS SOMETHING WRONG?

511
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,916
- I'VE BEEN SO PATIENT,
BUT I CAN'T TAKE IT ANY MORE.

512
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,750
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

513
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,958
YOU'LL HAVE TO
DRINK DOWN EVERY DROP!

514
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,041
- ( gulping )

515
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,250
( screams )

516
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,666
- I'M RIGHT OVER HERE, MY LOVE.
- LISTEN UP,

517
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,083
ARROGANT HORIZON!

518
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:56,041
YOU ARE MY RIVAL NOW!

519
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,833
- GRAY, MY BELOVED,
PLEASE LOVE ME.

520
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,125
- I GUESS THERE
ARE SOME PEOPLE

521
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,041
WHO ARE SIMPLY NEVER
MEANT TO FLY.

522
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,916
- Narrator: AND SO IT SEEMS THAT
JUVIA'S BAD LUCK WITH MEN

523
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,916
RIVALS THAT OF LUCY.

524
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,666
JUST A FEW DAYS LATER...

525
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,791
- ( sighs )
SO BORED.

526
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:15,625
- HEY, LUCY.
- WHAT'S UP?

527
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,583
- NOTHING REALLY.
JUST A PASSING THOUGHT.

528
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:20,500
DO YOU THINK GRAY
MIGHT HAVE A THING FOR YOU?

529
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,541
YOU'D BE SO CUTE TOGETHER.

530
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,875
- OH, DON'T YOU
EVEN GO THERE. 

531
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,791
I CAN'T GO THROUGH
THAT AGAIN!

532
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:27,958
- HUH?

533
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,666
- WHAT'S THAT?

534
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,666
A SPELL TO MAKE PEOPLE
FALL IN LOVE?

535
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,708
I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

536
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,583
- WAIT A SECOND.

537
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:38,041
COULD SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN
HOW I ENDED UP HERE?

538
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:41,000
- IT COULD ONLY BE THE CURSE
OF THE MOON, YOUNG MAN.

539
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,541
- ( end theme playing )

540
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:51,416
- ( singing in Japanese )

541
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,708
- Natsu: WHAT'S THAT?

542
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:15,750
SOME GUYS FROM A DARK GUILD
ARE CAUSING PROBLEMS?

543
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:18,041
BIG SURPRISE.  DON'T WORRY.
I'LL JUST GO OVER THERE

544
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,333
AND KICK THEIR BUTTS.
- Happy: YOU CAN'T.

545
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,916
THEY'VE GOT HOSTAGES.

546
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,041
AND KNOWING YOU,
YOU'D BEAT THEM UP

547
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,708
ALONG WITH THE BAD GUYS.

548
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:25,375
- OH, YOU KNOW WHAT, JUST
FOR THAT LITTLE COMMENT, 

549
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:26,875
I'M GOING.
- I SAID YOU CAN'T.

550
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,916
AND I MEAN IT.
- WELL, HOW DO YOU SUGGEST

551
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,083
I GET MORE SCENES?

552
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,875
- ( Happy and Natsu speaking ) 

553
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:35,125
- Happy: THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
YOU WERE GONNA GO?

554
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:36,875
- DIDN'T YOU NOTICE
THE SERIOUS LACK OF NATSU

555
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:38,875
IN THIS EPISODE?
- SORRY, PAL.

556
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:41,666
BUT NOT EVERYBODY
CAN BE A STAR LIKE ME.
