You're lying!

3
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,500
[IRENE]
No, it's true.

4
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:31,541
I was known as the
"Queen of Dragons."

5
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,083
I shall tell you a story

6
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,250
about events that took
place 400 years ago

7
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:39,500
in a kingdom here on
Ishgar, called "Dragnof."

8
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,083
Hear about the
western continent?

9
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,375
There was another attack.

10
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,250
By the dragons?

11
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,791
[BOTH gasp]

12
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,000
That doesn't surprise me.

13
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,708
Dragons in the west
are uncivilized brutes.

14
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,916
[SOLDIER A]
Sage Dragon Belserion!

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,958
[SOLDIER B] Glad to see you've
returned unharmed, sir.

16
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,333
The situation there
is worse than imagined.

17
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,583
Things are dire.

18
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,208
I need to see Irene.

19
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,958
Right! Her Majesty is
here, in the courtyard.

20
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,708
[BELSERION]
Irene.

21
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:29,083
Belserion. So good to see you.

22
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,458
[IRENE]
What's the matter? Are you ill?

23
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,750
[BELSERION]
I come bearing bad news.

24
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,750
The dragons in the west
show no signs of relenting.

25
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,458
It's only a matter of time
before they've consumed

26
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,583
all the humans and
come to Ishgar.

27
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:49,000
How ghastly.
They're eating people.

28
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,833
Unbelievable.

29
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:54,125
Just the thought of it
alone... It's blasphemy.

30
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,666
In Ishgar, we see our
relationship with humans

31
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,083
as invaluable.

32
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,458
[IRENE]
Likewise.

33
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,541
I can't imagine where
our society would be

34
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,666
without the dragons' help.

35
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:09,333
Our species can peacefully
coexist, but one has to wonder:

36
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,125
If the western dragons' way of
thinking reaches our shores

37
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,958
and begins to take root,

38
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,875
would that place our
bond in jeopardy?

39
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,291
[BELSERION]
We will not allow it.

40
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:24,041
On our honor,
we'll protect humankind!

41
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,666
[IRENE] This marked the
beginning of the bloody war

42
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,083
that would later be known as
the "Dragon King Festival."

43
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,666
Yes.

44
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,416
Ironically, it was first sparked
by the kindness of dragons.

45
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,291
[ERZA]
Four hundred years ago?

46
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,166
How have you not aged?

47
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,333
[IRENE]
I'll address that eventually.

48
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:05,333
You should like this next part,
so listen well, okay?

49
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,541
In fact, I think your little
Dragon Slayer friend

50
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,625
will hang on every word.

51
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,375
[WENDY]
Huh?

52
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,791
[IRENE] My kingdom was
a place of harmony,

53
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,666
with humans and dragons
living together

54
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,125
in peace for generations.

55
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:22,708
Back then, several such
kingdoms existed in Ishgar.

[CROWD gasps]

57
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,750
She broke an iron sword
with a wooden stick!

58
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,166
Your Majesty, how'd you do it?

59
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,125
With imbuement magic.

60
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,708
I call it "enchantment."
Nice, huh?

61
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,625
To put it simply,
I enhanced the wooden stick.

62
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,625
The enchantment made it
harder than the iron.

63
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:05,958
[CIVILIAN B]
That's amazing!

64
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,083
We could use this spell to make

65
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,083
our dragons' scales
even tougher!

66
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:12,291
This is our chance
to win the war!

67
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,458
[IRENE] However, things
did not go in our favor.

68
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,541
The sheer number of
dragons from the west

69
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,583
dwarfed those on our side.

70
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,625
Plus, there were some in Ishgar
who chose to ally themselves

71
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:43,625
with those seeking to disrupt
our peaceful coexistence.

72
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,791
[BELSERION]
Irene.

73
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,375
Belserion.

74
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,375
We're losing.

75
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:12,333
[IRENE]
I see. Are you sure?

76
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:15,125
My wish for peace
remains steadfast.

77
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,500
I won't give up.

78
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:21,166
Know this, no matter how
many brethren I lose,

79
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,500
I'll still fight.

80
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,500
I don't understand.

81
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,958
Why make such a sacrifice?

82
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:32,875
Why? I've told you how
your predecessor saved me.

83
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,458
This is my debt to pay.

84
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,750
[IRENE]
I knew that,

85
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,958
but surely that debt has
been long since repaid.

86
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,333
You've devoted your life
to serving not only me,

87
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,333
but all of mankind,

88
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:47,041
yet you're willing to give more.

89
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:51,291
Listen, my debt
will not be repaid

90
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,625
till you are forever safe.

91
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,958
To that end,
I'll pledge my life.

92
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,666
[IRENE]
Belserion.

93
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:03,625
Let me join you
and fight by your side.

94
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,708
You can't be serious.

95
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,875
We're up against
dragons, not people!

96
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,916
You won't survive,
not even with an army.

97
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,666
They'll destroy you!

98
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,416
[IRENE] I've found a way we
can win, a new technique.

99
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,791
[IRENE] But it's only possible
if I can imbue myself

100
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,250
with your power.

101
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,000
Will you allow it?

102
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:33,291
The power of a dragon
within a human?

103
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,333
We can create a whole
new class of wizards...

104
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,750
...able to fight dragons.

105
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,875
Called Dragon Slayers.

00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,208
[ERZA] Are you trying to say you
created that type of magic?

108
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,916
[IRENE]
I am saying it.

109
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,625
You can consider me to be
the mother of Dragon Slayers.

110
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,791
It's not working.
He's not getting warmer.

111
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,916
Please, Natsu, wake up!

112
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,583
Come on. I know you're
still in there somewhere.

113
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,750
Natsu!

114
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,333
[NATSU]

[gasps]

116
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,208
Do you remember Anna
telling us a long time ago

117
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,583
about who created
Dragon Slayer magic?

118
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,833
It was somebody named Irene.

119
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:13,958
What's goin' on?
When'd you get here? Hm?

120
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:17,500
This is your mind, ya know,
so quit bein' so shocked.

121
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,166
You guys really piss me
off sometimes!

122
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,083
I thought you were
supposed to be tellin' me

123
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,458
why I'm on the verge
of death or somethin'!

124
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,250
Not our fault.

125
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,916
All we're supposed
to do is lead you down

126
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,083
some kinda path through
your memories.

127
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:33,583
We're almost to the
end, Natsu! Come on!

00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,708
Natsu.

129
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,583
Don't die.

130
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,916
[IRENE] After producing
numerous Dragon Slayers,

131
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,458
we were able to gain the
upper hand in the war.

132
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,750
Victory seemed to
be within reach,

133
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:59,666
and with that victory,
came our very survival.

[SLAYER A roars]

136
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,375
[IRENE]
However, the great potential

137
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,708
that had been unlocked

138
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,583
began to take its toll on
the bodies wielding it.

139
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:22,208
Those unable to suppress this
wellspring of power went mad.

140
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,666
The extraordinary sensory
perception of dragons

141
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,416
caused extreme vertigo and
motion sickness in humans.

142
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,958
[IRENE]
What's more...

143

[SOLDIER A]
Excuse me, Your Majesty?

144

Your face... What's wrong?

145
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,541
[IRENE]
Huh?

146
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,250
[IRENE] Inside those who'd
gained this new power

147
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,458
grew Dragon Seeds.

148
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,791
[IRENE] These "seeds"
would turn those people

149
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:56,291
into dragons, spelling
doom for any Dragon Slayer.

150
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:04,208
[IRENE] To complicate things
further, at that time,

00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:08,083
I was carrying a
child in my womb.

You, Erza.

153

[IRENE] I'm sure you're
curious about your father.

154
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:26,500
He was a general of a
neighboring country.

155
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,083
Our marriage was
political in nature.

156
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,083
A "solution" to a
territorial dispute.

157
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,291
Can you make it?

158
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,333
Yes!

[DRAGON A roars]

160
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,375
The Dragon Slayers'
power is incredible.

It borders on supernatural.

162
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,458
[IRENE]
No!

163
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,625
I'm done. This is the
end of my journey.

164
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,666
[IRENE]
Belserion!

165
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:10,083
Irene, I've failed my
duty to protect you.

166
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:14,375
I've failed to preserve our
peaceful coexistence.

167
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:24,916
[IRENE crying]

168
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,750
[IRENE] Your father fought by
my side on many battlefields,

169
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:34,625
and was there to comfort me
as I watched Belserion die.

170
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,750
[IRENE] When Acnologia
rose up, the war ended

171
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:44,375
with neither side coming
away as the clear victor.

172
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,750
As if ridiculing the countless
lives that were lost,

173
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:51,291
Acnologia, alone,
stood victorious.

174
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,833
[IRENE] Then, just one week
after the fighting stopped...

175
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,708
[RUNG]
You monster! I'll kill you!

176
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:10,750
Stay back!

177
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,458
[IRENE]
It's me! Irene!

178
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,375
Be patient. I know
I can fix this!

179
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,416
Please, Rung!

180
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,125
Careful. She'll end up
just like Acnologia!

181
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,916
[SOLDIERS gasp]

182
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,166
No, please! I won't!

183
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,500
I would never choose
to harm the dragons.

184
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,000
[grunts]

185
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,750
[RUNG] That means you're
an enemy of humankind.

186
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,791
[IRENE gasps]

187
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,250
Seize her, men!

188
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,208
We must lock up this dragon
woman for our own safety!

189
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,583
[IRENE]
Stop! Listen to me!

190
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,250
I'm carrying your child!

191
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,916
[RUNG gasps]

192
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,541
What did she say?

193
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,375
If that's true,
then that must mean...

194
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,875
The child is cursed.

195
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,166
[RUNG growls]

196
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,000
I would never father a child
with a monster like you!

197
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,291
[gasps]

198
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:08,041
After that, my life
became a living hell,

199
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,250
filled only with misery.

200
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:14,833
Torture, beatings,
dehumanization.

201
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,416
[IRENE]
And then...

202
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,791
[IRENE]
Don't worry.

203
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:35,458
I'll do everything in my power
to keep you safe from harm.

204
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,083
[footsteps]

205
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,958
[RUNG]
Dragon woman,

206
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:47,041
the day of your execution
has been decided.

207
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,583
That's fine.

208
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:53,166
But please!
Please spare my child!

209
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,875
I've had enough of
this foolishness!

210
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,416
No child takes three
years to be born!

211
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,583
[IRENE] That's because
I cast a spell on it.

212
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:04,375
I can't have it here,
not in this hellish place!

213
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,000
There is no child!

214
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:09,791
To prove it, I'll split
open your belly myself!

215
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:13,750
[IRENE]
No! Don't! I'm begging you!

216
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,875
No!

217
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,916
See? You're just like Acnologia.

218
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,041
A blight on humanity!

219
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:32,833
[IRENE snarls]

220
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,291
No! You monste--!

221
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,708
Wait! What was that?

222
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,500
It's coming from the dungeon!

223
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:45,291
[SOLDIER F] Let's move!
We have to save General Rung!

224
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,625
[SOLDIER G]
Hurry!

225
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,000
[ALL gasp]

226
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:54,833
[IRENE snarls]

227
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,458
[SOLDIER D]
A dragon?

228
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,333
[SOLDIER E]
It must be that dragon woman!

229
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,916
[SOLDIER C] You'll pay
for killing the general!

230
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,625
[IRENE]
This can't be happening.

231
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,500
I know I'm still a human!

232
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:27,958
I don't want this!
I wanna be a person again!

233
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:31,500
Somebody, please. Help me!

234
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,500
[IRENE]
Centuries passed,

235
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:45,958
and during all that time,
I carried you inside me, Erza.

236
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,625
My child.

237
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,416
I lived deep in the mountains,

238
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,875
far away from human
civilization,

239
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:56,083
searching for a way
to lift this curse.

240
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,208
[roars]

241
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,041
[IRENE]
Then, one day...

242
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,166
[ZEREF]
Do my eyes deceive me?

243
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,333
It's been ages since
I've last seen a dragon.

244
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,916
Who're you?

245
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,458
No. You're actually
a human, aren't you?

246
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,500
[IRENE]
On that day, I met His Majesty.

247
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:22,166
His magic ability
was unparalleled.

248
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,708
In the blink of an eye,

249
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:28,541
he cured the affliction that
had plagued me for centuries.

250
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,541
[IRENE gasping]

251
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,166
Human!

252
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,958
I can hardly believe it.

253
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,958
Oh! I'm back.

254
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,958
I'm human!

255
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,500
This is merely an appearance.

256
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,750
You'll never truly return
to who you once were.

257
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,166
[IRENE] It's okay.
I can live with that.

258
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,291
I'm so happy!

259
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:02,333
Just looking like my old
self after all this time

fills my heart with joy.

261
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,625
[IRENE] However, soon I
discovered the shortcomings

00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,625
of my new condition.

263
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,958
There's no flavor.

[IRENE]
I gorged myself sick.

265
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,333
But I couldn't taste anything.

So tired. God, all I want
is to fall asleep, please.

00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:42,041
[IRENE] This pain.
I'm so itchy. And so cold.

What's happening to me?
Why won't it stop?

270
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:49,250
I just wanna live
like a normal human.

271
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,416
[ZEREF]
This is merely an appearance.

272
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,625
You'll never be human.

273
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,541
I'm not some kind of monster!

274
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,916
I'm human! I'm human!

275
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:13,208
[IRENE] I don't want my
baby to suffer as I have.

276
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,458
I want it to be human.

277
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,416
Human.

278
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,458
Growing inside me... is a human.

279
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:32,458
[IRENE]
I'm carrying a human life.

280
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:36,875
With a human body...

281
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,916
[IRENE]
...could be a new beginning.

282
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,083
I can enchant myself
into this child.

283
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,208
Then I would have
a human body.

284
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,708
It would be just like before.

285
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,291
Oh...

286
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,458
I'd be a new being.

287
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:57,958
In a new body, I would
have a new chance at life!

288
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:01,041
I will be you,
and you will be me!

289
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:05,875
Come, my child, let us
join and become one!

290
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,000
[IRENE]
Alas, it didn't work.

291
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:22,000
Enchanting myself into the child
was an impossible dream.

292
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:25,458
Since I had no use for
you, I threw you away.

293
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,833
So you wouldn't weigh me down.

294
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,791
I simply left you in some
backwater hamlet.

295
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,583
[ERZA]
And that was Rosemary Village?

296
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:39,833
I didn't care to
remember the name.

297
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,375
Erza.

298
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,375
It's all right.

299
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,250
Guess I should thank you.

300
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:48,375
If only for giving me
the gift of life.

301
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,000
A waste of breath.

302
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,125
Your life was no
gift, I promise.

303
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:56,000
What's wrong with you?!
She's your own child!

304
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,333
[ERZA]
You may be right.

305
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,666
Leaving me behind
was the true gift.

306
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,750
If you hadn't thrown me away,

307
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,791
I may have never
met my real family!

308
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:40,708
[LUCY] Now, Erza has finally
learned the secret

309
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:43,333
behind her birth from
her biological mother.

310
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:46,500
Despite this harsh truth,
she remains unfazed.

311
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:48,166
The memories of meeting
her dear friends

312
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,000
and everything they've
shared together

313
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:53,083
make it clear where
her allegiance lies.

314
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:56,500
And so, Fairy Tail's
mightiest female wizard

315
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:59,166
will take on the
Scarlet Despair!

316
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:02,125
Next Time: "Master Enchant."

317
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,166
The power of love and
the bonds of friendship

318
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,625
will drive out this anguish.
