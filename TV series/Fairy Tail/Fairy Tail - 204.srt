1
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,416
Ah. It's so nice up here!

2
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,125
It is. But why is it
called Star Hill?

3
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:36,500
You'll see. Just wait until
after the sun goes down.

4
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,208
Looks like we made it, Happy.

5
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:44,375
Oh. Finally. My aching paws.

6
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,208
I thought it'd be a good
idea to walk here

7
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:47,500
to try and lose some weight.

8
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:50,166
But I wish I would've
flown instead.

9
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,000
That's weird. You're
worried about your figure?

10
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:54,666
[HAPPY] Well, the other day,
Carla pointed out

11
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,833
my tummy was getting big
and round, so I figured

12
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:58,375
I needed to do
something about it.

13
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,125
Huh. Hasn't it always
been like that?

14
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:02,791
Not cool, Natsu!

15
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:05,041
Stop bickering you guys!

16
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:07,833
Geez, you're like an
old married couple.

17
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:09,416
So. You ready to rock?

18
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,125
Yes, let's get started.

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,583
First thing's first.

20
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:44,583
Open!

21
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,208
Gate of the Ram!

22
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,625
[LUCY]
Aries!

23
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,833
Oh, I'm sorry!

24
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,916
Is there something that
you need help with?

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,500
Sorry, I don't feel 100%
prepared right now.

26
00:02:58,583 --> 00:02:59,833
[LUCY]
Don't worry about it.

27
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,291
Today's about giving back.
Me helping you.

28
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,750
How's that sound?

29
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,666
[HAPPY]
Full Effort Hospitality!

30
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm sorry, but,
I don't understand.

31
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,416
You're helping me?

32
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,958
It's a reward. All you
celestial spirits worked so hard

33
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,333
to close the Eclipse gate.

34
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,250
[NATSU] Yeah, and these two
won't stop talking about

35
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,333
how awesome it was!

36
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,750
[HAPPY]
Of course not!

37
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,541
Shutting that humongous door
was a pretty big deal.

38
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,125
[ARIES] You're welcome,
but I was just doing my job.

39
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,708
We appreciate it.
And to show how much,

40
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,666
we wanna do something nice
for you guys for a change.

41
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,125
And that's the reason we
brought you out here today!

42
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,750
[ARIES] Okay. That's very
considerate of you, but--

43
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,250
So tell me.

44
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,083
What's one thing you've always
wanted to do but haven't?

45
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,833
[YUKINO] Today we want to
make your dreams a reality!

46
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,666
I wanna get a tan!
I really do!

47
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,916
I apologize for
being so ridiculous.

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Uh, you want a tan?

49
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,833
I've always been so fluffy
and wooly and pale.

50
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:08,875
But sometimes.

51
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,500
I wish I were golden brown.

52
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,458
I got this! One tan
comin' right up!

53
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,083
Fire Dragon...

54
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,000
Roar!

55
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,083
[LUCY screams]

56
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,041
[YUKINO gasps]

57
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,083
[HAPPY gasps]

58
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,458
Yes! This is just perfect!

59
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,500
I absolutely love it!
Thanks so much!

60
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:32,000
Whoa. I can't believe that
worked. And she likes it?

61
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,958
I'm not surprised at all.
I know what I'm doin'!

62
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:39,208
She went golden brown
without gettin' extra crispy!

63
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:42,458
It's what I've always
wanted! I'm so happy!

64
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,041
Good. Then I'm happy too.

65
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,416
Now go show it off!

66
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,833
[ARIES]
Thanks again, Lucy!

67
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,250
If you need anything,
don't hesitate to call me.

68
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,458
See you later!

69
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,958
Cool. On to the next!

70
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,625
Open, Gate--

71
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,333
Hang on. I got a strong feeling

72
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,208
that things are about
to get kind of creepy.

73
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,875
[HAPPY]
I think I know who's up next.

74
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,458
[NATSU]
Huh? Who're you talkin' about?

75
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:06,500
Now open.

76
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,375
Gate of the Golden Bull!

77
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:09,750
Taurus!

78
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,333
Moo!

79
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,333
Are ya feeling lonely
today, Miss Lucy?

80
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,375
Don't see how that
could ever be true.

81
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,541
Not with an amazing
body like that!

82
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,166
Yeah, that's not quite it.

83
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,500
We were wondering if there
was anything nice we could do.

84
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:28,416
[TAURUS]
Moo!

85
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,000
Ooh. I can't believe my eyes!

86
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,250
Huh?

87
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,500
Uh. Hello. Can I help you?

88
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,458
[TAURUS] I had no idea I
would be seeing two udderly

89
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,875
amazing female forms
this close together.

90
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:46,458
[TAURUS]
It's really got me mooving!

91
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:49,875
Uh. I'm flattered, but--

92
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,916
It's the gift that
keeps on giving!

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,541
Go home!

94
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:57,041
[HAPPY] I guess just a look was
good enough for the muscle cow.

95
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,666
That wasn't so bad.

96
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh man.

97
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,375
We're just getting
started with these freaks.

98
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,375
Don't worry, there's only ten
more of the Golden Keys.

99
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,000
[HAPPY]
Hey, I have a request!

100
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,458
Since this is your thing,

101
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,291
Natsu and I are just
kinda hangin' out.

102
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,250
So can we go home now?

103
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,875
Good idea. I'm starvin'.

104
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,041
But you guys promised
you'd give me a hand!

105
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,500
[HAPPY] But that was before
we knew how boring it'd be.

106
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:23,250
So, see you. We're outta here!

107
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,916
Hm? What gives?

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,083
Did you decide to take some
kind of secret shortcut?

109
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,041
[HAPPY groans]

110
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,375
That was so not cool.

111
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:36,833
Good to see you, Virgo.

112
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,291
But we hadn't called
for you just yet.

113
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,083
[VIRGO] Do you remember
that punishment diary

114
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,666
I was telling you about?

115
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,416
Well I've been looking to add
to it, so as soon as I heard you

116
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,166
were gathering spirits, I rushed
over as just fast as I could.

117
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,166
Can you add to it? Princess?

118
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,083
So they're already talking
about it in the celestial world?

119
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,166
Exactly what is it that
you want us to do?

120
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,125
What I want is punishment.

121
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,833
I've been bad. And I truly
deserve your worst.

122
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:02,916
So please.

123
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,666
This couldn't possibly
be more wrong.

124
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,291
[HAPPY] Hey. You'll
probably need your whip.

125
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,541
Would you please
stop encouraging her?

126
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,625
I'm really looking
forward to this.

127
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,166
Now let's get to it!

128
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,125
[LUCY]
Uh... Okay.

129
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,125
[NATSU, HAPPY]
That's so weak!

130
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,750
When she said she
deserves your worst,

131
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:31,916
that's not what she meant!

132
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,375
Guess I'll handle this one too.

133
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:37,083
Don't you dare!
Sorry about that.

134
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,000
Is there something else
that you want instead?

135
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:39,750
Huh?

136
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,416
[VIRGO whimpering]

137
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,416
Okay...

138
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,416
[VIRGO]
Very impressive.

139
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,625
One flick of your
finger is all I need.

140
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,125
The pain is intense.

141
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:53,916
[whimpers] I feel it from my
head to the tips of my toes!

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,541
[BOTH]
Is this Lucy's secret weapon?

143
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,791
What? I didn't really
mean to hurt you!

144
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,750
It was pure bliss.
I'll never forget this feeling.

145
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,583
So call if you ever need
me to dig a hole for you.

146
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,875
[VIRGO] I can put them all
over Magnolia if you'd like.

147
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:10,625
I don't think that's
going to be necessary.

148
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,791
Well. I'll be on my
way now. Goodbye.

149
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,166
I need to remember to
stay on Lucy's good side

150
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,041
if I don't wanna
get "the finger."

151
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,458
[LUCY] So, whatever
you want, just ask.

152
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,666
[CANCER]
Very nice, baby.

153
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,916
My pinchers are twitching!

154
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,833
Uh.

155
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,625
[HAPPY] I'm a little scared,
so be careful. Please?

156
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:46,083
[CANCER] Snip! Snip! Snip! Snip!
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-da-ba!

157
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,708
Cancer!

158
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,416
What a hot look, baby.

159
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,208
[YUKINO]

and gets away with it!

318
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,166
[LUCY] No Natsu! Don't do it!
[NATSU] Fire Dragon...

319
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,125
[NATSU yelps]

320
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,708
Regulus. Impact!

321
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,833
[NATSU]
Not again!

322
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,916
[HAPPY]
I say we just call it a day.

323
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,916
Alright! You crossed the line,
bub! Back to the spirit world!

324
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,708
[LOKE] Sorry. You can
still call me anytime.

325
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,958
You always just show up
on your own anyway!

326
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,125
I'm leaving.
After this one last look.

327
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,708
[LUCY grunts]

328
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,333
Creepy much?

329
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,375
[NATSU] Hey. Where's Loke?
I owe him a beating.

330
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,291
[HAPPY]
Too late.

331
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,375
Lucy just kicked
him to the curb.

332
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,000
That lousy jerk.

333
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,208
He'll be sorry for
punkin' me like that.

334
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,375
[sighs] I guess we have
to finish what we started

335
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:21,208
with all this. I'm scared.

336
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,750
Open.

337
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,333
Is something the matter?

338
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:28,125
This one's hard to deal
with on their best day.

339
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,208
I'm not entirely sure I
can go through with it.

340
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,958
[YUKINO]
Huh?

341
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,041
Let's get this over with.

342
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,208
Open.

343
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,125
Gate of the Water Bearer!

344
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,666
Aquarius!

345
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,666
[ALL scream]

346
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,333
[ALL groan]

347
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,750
So what the hell do
you want this time?

348
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,583
You'd better have a good
reason for calling me

349
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,333
all the way out here like this.

350
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,583
Well?

351
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,166
Oh. I'm sorry, but this
shouldn't take too long.

352
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,666
We're, uh...
Just trying to be nice.

353
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,750
[AQUARIUS]
Would you just get to the point?

354
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,708
I'm in a particularly
foul mood today

355
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,208
and I've got other things to do!

356
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,541
[LUCY] Oh no, are you and
Scorpio still having problems?

357
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,291
Lucy. You should be careful.

358
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,916
I don't think she
wants to talk about it.

359
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,166
Speak up. What was
that again? Huh?

360
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,500
What? Nothing.

361
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,625
[AQUARIUS]
Because, I thought you said

362
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,541
that Scorpio has been
sneaking around

363
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,166
behind my back again.

364
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,625
That he's hanging out
with a bunch of floozies!

365
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,583
That's what you said, isn't it?

366
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:34,916
Tell me!

367
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,500
[LUCY] I didn't say
anything like that, I swear!

368
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:40,208
You know, actually, the fish
lady's the one who said it.

369
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,000
[HAPPY]
Shh!

370
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,583
[AQUARIUS growls]

371
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,083
Let's move on!

372
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:48,416
And like I said, I am in an
extremely rotten mood today,

373
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,125
so you'd better make
this worth my while.

374
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,375
You got that?

375
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,583
Yes ma'am!

376
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,291
So, what do you want?

377
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,666
Make me laugh.

378
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,625
Uh... How? I really don't--

379
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,833
Just do a funny
skit or something.

380
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,000
A skit?

381
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,583
[AQUARIUS]
Did I stutter?

382
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,291
Right! One skit comin' up!

383
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,916
Yukino. Hey.

384
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,916
A little help here?

385
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,583
Me? I'm not an actor!

386
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,416
[LUCY]
Hark, It's Sleeping Beauty!

387
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:20,708
Please, oh please,
won't you open your eyes!

388
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,583
[YUKINO whimpers]

389
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:26,375
[LUCY]
Whatever shall I do?

390
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,000
I know!

391
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,750
[LUCY grunts]

392
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,416
No, this can't be right!

393
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,083
My raw, brute strength is
way too much for this lass!

394
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:40,083
I simply cannot risk any
harm befalling the princess!

395
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:43,000
[NATSU laughing]

396
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,666
This has gotta be
the unfunniest thing

397
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,958
I've seen in my life.

398
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,625
[AQUARIUS growling]

399
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,333
Eureka! I know just what to do!

400
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,625
Ah, yes!

401
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,083
It's time to bring out
my secret weapon,

402
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:58,291
guaranteed to rouse even
the heaviest sleepers!

403
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,500
[YUKINO whimpers]

404
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:03,583
It has begun. Soon,
she will be fully awake.

405
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:07,791
[LUCY] My life is dedicated to
waking this sleeping beauty.

406
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,250
Uh, um, uh...

407
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,250
This is painful to watch.

408
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,541
[AQUARIUS growling]

409
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,666
It should've worked by now.

410
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,250
Please, wake up!

411
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,291
[YUKINO whimpers]

412
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,666
Yes, that's it! Silly me!

413
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,625
Why oh why didn't I think
of doing this before?

414
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,458
If the fair princess
will not awaken,

415
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,875
then I simply will
join her in slumber!

416
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,916
[NATSU laughing]
You're killin' me!

417
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,458
[HAPPY]
She's going to end it like that?

418
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,250
Lame.

419
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,291
Lucy!

420
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,458
[LUCY whimpers]

421
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,541
That was the worst
thing I've ever seen!

422
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:46,000
You made my mood go
from bad to worse!

423
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,666
[LUCY]
Sorry! I tried my best!

424
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,500
I never said I was any
good at improvising!

425
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,875
How could you be such an idiot?

426
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:57,000
I told you to make me laugh,
not to piss me off even more!

427
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,041
[NATSU, HAPPY yelling]

428
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:02,250
[HAPPY]
I told you we should've left!

429
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:05,250
[YUKINO screams]

430
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:09,541
[LUCY gasps, screams]

431
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,083
[AQUARIUS grunts]

432
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,041
[LUCY screams]

433
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,000
[LUCY groans]

434
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:29,208
[laughs] You look like an
old costume hung out to dry.

435
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,750
[AQUARIUS]
Geez.

436
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:33,083
There's no question why you
still don't have a boyfriend.

437
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,916
Look at you!

438
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,750
[AQUARIUS] You summoned
way too many of us in a row.

439
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,541
What a reckless idiot.

440
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,791
[AQUARIUS] But as wizards go,
you're not that bad.

441
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:08,041
[YOUNG LUCY giggling]

442
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,125
Aw, come on!

443
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,333
Bath time is a lot
of fun isn't it?

444
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,666
It's not so much fun
that you gotta call me

445
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,833
every time you get in the tub!

446
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:19,125
Whoops! I'm sorry!

447
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,333
[AQUARIUS grumbles]

448
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,625
[AQUARIUS] This better be the
last time I tell you this.

449
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,458
But don't ever dream
of summoning me

450
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,541
from your stupid little
pet prison again!

451
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,916
It's a goldfish bowl
for crying out loud!

452
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,541
[YOUNG LUCY] But he's got
a tail, just like you!

453
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,625
Are you saying me and that
simple little creature

454
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:39,958
have something in common?

455
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,666
Because that is insulting!

456
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,833
I didn't mean to make you mad.

457
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,083
[AQUARIUS]
Sheesh.

458
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,875
You seriously need
to find some other

459
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,583
rugrats to play with.

460
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,833
There aren't any.

461
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,166
That's why I'm so lonely.

462
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,750
You make me happy.

463
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,166
But I always seem
to make you mad.

464
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,375
I'm really sorry.

465
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,833
[AQUARIUS]
Tch!

466
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:15,666
Oh well. You're not
lonely anymore.

467
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,208
[LUCY]
Yeah. You're right.

468
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,208
I'm definitely not.

469
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:32,916
[LUCY]
Bye. Hope to see you soon.

470
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,000
[NATSU]
Hey, is it me?

471
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:16,166
Or has the weather
been super crazy lately?

472
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,666
[HAPPY]
No, it's totally crazy!

473
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,125
I heard it even snowed
in the desert recently!

474
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,625
[NATSU]
What? That's nuts!

475
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:23,166
[HAPPY]
You wanna know my theory?

476
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,625
It's all because you gave me

[NATSU]
What's that got to do with it?

478
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,208
[HAPPY] I've always heard, that
when somethin' rare happens,

479
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:31,291
it's gonna rain or snow, so...

480
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,791
[NATSU]
Whoa! No way! Are you serious?

481
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:36,041
[NATSU, HAPPY]
Next Time: Signal of Rebellion

482
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:38,500
[NATSU] Man, I knew I should've
just kept that thing to myself!

483
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:40,083
[HAPPY] Geez, my point
is that you should

484
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:41,875
give me fish all the time!
