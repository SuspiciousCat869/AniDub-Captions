00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:20,708
[NARRATOR] As the war
against Tartaros rages on,

2
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:22,916
our heroes find
themselves tested

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,041
by the most fearsome
foes they've seen.

4
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:29,333
These are the Etherious,
born of the books of Zeref

5
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:33,208
and led by the devious
Underworld King, Mard Geer.

6
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:37,333
They will stop at nothing in
their quest to meet their maker.

7
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:45,541
White Dragon Roar!

[STING, ROGUE screaming]

11
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:09,208
[NARRATOR] Two of the Nine
Demon Gates have fallen.

12
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:10,916
Juvia destroyed Keyes,

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,291
despite knowing that the life
of her beloved Gray's father

14
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:15,916
was linked to his.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,708
But before the necromancy
keeping Silver alive had faded,

16
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:22,583
he was able to pass two
things on to his son.

17
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,875
First, his burning
desire to kill E.N.D.

18
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:29,208
And last, the mark of
the Ice Demon Slayer.

19
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:33,833
Fairy Tail has yet to find
victory without sacrifice.

20
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:37,583
And if the past is any
indicator of the trials ahead,

21
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:41,916
then the fighting will only
get more difficult from here.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,791
[GRAY]
I'm an Ice Demon Slayer now.

23
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:47,708
I swear, I'll kill E.N.D.

24
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,791
That human killed a demon?

25
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:30,791
Way to go!

26
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,416
She pulled it off.

27
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,291
Juvia!

28
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,166
Bane Particles.

29
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,583
Keyes managed to
contaminate her at least.

30
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,625
One for one. That we can take.

31
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:44,958
[GAJEEL]
You all right?

32
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,041
I've got you. Hang in there!

33
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:57,791
I want to see Gray.
Where is he?

34
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,833
He'll be back before
you know it. Don't worry.

35
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,208
Okay.

Yo, Erza! Hey, Gray!

00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,416
[WAKABA]
It's a big guild.

40
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,666
Don't make us call
all your names, okay?

41
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,125
Call out if you can
hear us, will ya?!

42
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,083
[CANA]
Still no response.

43
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,625
[WAKABA] They're probably
just outta earshot.

44
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,875
But Tartaros hasn't
shown up either.

45
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,708
Shouldn't we have drawn some
heat with all that shouting?

46
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,833
And what the hell brought
down their base anyway?

47
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,083
Look, man, I'm about
as stupid as you are,

48
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,000
but it seems to me
like ya just listed off

49
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:53,416
a bunch'a good things,
so maybe we're winning.

50
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,625
That doesn't mean
there's time to relax.

51
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:56,833
Whoever's still fighting,

52
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,875
we need to find them
and give them support.

53
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,833
But if we leave now,
what if Levy comes back?

54
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,166
Aw, don't worry, bud.

55
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,333
Jet and Droy will definitely
be able to find her.

56
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,625
[CANA] Maybe Tartaros' grunts
went down with the ship,

57
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,916
but the Nine Gates? No way.

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,541
[WAKABA] Which means, we need
to get everyone in one place

59
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,416
as soon as we possibly can.

60
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,000
[ROMEO]
Right.

61
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,958
[DROY] Man, why did Levy have
to run off all by herself?!

62
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,583
[JET] Try not to fall behind.
We gotta find her quickly!

63
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:22,916
[DROY]
I'm with ya!

64
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,791
[LEVY]
Jet! Droy!

65
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:31,416
Gajeel? Anyone hear me?

66
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,166
How did I get here?

67
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,416
Hello? I have no idea
where I'm going.

68

[gasps]

70
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,083
Talk about a dead end.

71
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,500
Least this narrows
down my options.

72

[BOTH yelling]

00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,208
[STING yells]

74
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,000
[MARD GEER]
You've convinced me.

75
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,791
It seems some humans are
worthy of the power of dragons.

76
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,791
Yeah, well I'm about to
convince your nose to break.

77
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,291
Prepare. You won't enjoy this.

78
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,791
It's true that humans have
stood against me before,

79
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:14,625
but none have ever remained
standing for such a long time.

80
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,583
Why, this is the second
best fight I've had

81
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:17,916
since I arrived here.

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,416
I've had enough of your crap!

83
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,125
If you're so damn strong,
then stop playing and prove it!

84
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:28,708
That acrid human cocktail:
Equal parts bold and foolish.

85
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,708
I used to despise your kind,
but I'm beginning to realize

86
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,250
just how thoroughly entertaining
blind arrogance can be.

87
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,916
Wow, dude. You need a mirror.

88
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:41,625
Damnit.

89
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,625
His defense is ironclad.

90
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,000
[MARD GEER] Was that
all you boys had in you?

91
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:49,125
I was hoping you two could
put on a bit more of a show.

92
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,208
We haven't landed a single hit.

93
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,458
And he's still using one
hand to hold that book.

94
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,750
[MARD GEER] If you cannot
entertain me in battle,

95
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,500
then perhaps you could
come up with a dance

96
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,583
to celebrate my victory.

97
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,875
I might spare you if I enjoy it.

98
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:06,208
[ROGUE] And what exactly
does victory mean to you?

99
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:09,041
[STING] What's the point of
activating the Faces anyway?

100
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:12,500
We seek to pave the way
for Lord Zeref's return.

101
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,083
[ROGUE]
Zeref?

102
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,875
[MARD GEER]
I highly doubt your feeble minds

103
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,833
could comprehend
much more than that.

104
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,541
I might as well
explain my motives

105
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,500
to a pair of cockroaches.

106
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:27,000
Those hateful expressions
illustrate my point perfectly.

107
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,666
Tug at their fragile emotions

108
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,750
and humans become the most
predictable creatures alive.

109
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,208
Am I wrong?

110
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,208
Or are the two of you
about to attack me?

111
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,416
[STING]
Shut your friggin' mouth!

112
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,916
[FRANMALTH] Heh, heh. So once
again, I had to ask myself,

113
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,916
"How much is this gonna cost
us? A lot? A little?" Heh.

114
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,083
You know me.

115
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,958
Quite a bit better
than I would like to.

116
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,250
Yeah, say that to
the hole in my noggin.

117
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,833
He's obviously
trying to buy time,

118
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,750
so we might as well decide how
we're gonna cook him up now.

119
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,583
Yeah, he isn't tasty raw.

120
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,875
If he does deceive us,
I say boil him.

121
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,458
We won't have to hear his
screams once he's submerged.

122
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,666
[FRANMALTH]
Oh! I wouldn't dare lie to you

123
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,083
after hearing that threat!

124
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:09,750
Not that was planning to before,
but if I had been, phew!

125
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,458
I can't believe I left
Sting and Rogue

126
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,625
to face Mard Geer on their own.

127
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,333
I wonder how they've
fared so far.

128
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:20,750
Honestly, they'd need a miracle
to win against a foe like him.

129
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,250
[ERZA]
Miracles are nice and all,

130
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,958
but keeping faith in your
friends can do the same work.

131
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:26,791
[MINERVA (NEO)]
Yeah.

132
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,166
Aw, listen to that, Frosch.

133
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,833
Hearin' her fret for our
boys, it warms my heart.

134
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,750
We frogs are cold-blooded.

135
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,875
Despite the shenanigans that she
pulled at the Grand Magic Games,

136
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,375
I believe that deep down,
she's a good woman.

137
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,291
Aye, sir.

138
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,666
M'lady's awesome.

139
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,750
And her cooking skills
would blow you away.

140
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,166
Seriously?

141
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,541
Can she make broiled mackerel?

142
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,458
It's like my favorite
kind of not raw fish!

143
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,958
Of course she can.

144
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,083
And don't get me wrong,
she makes it real good,

145

but her smoked
salmon's to die for.

Once you try her sole meunière,
you'll never go raw again!

Wow, ya don't say.

148
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,708
Even the fishies'
names sound tasty.

Ah. When I close my eyes, I
can see the last meal she made.

[ERZA]
You seem to like it back there.

159
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,500

Holy crap.

Erza has a very commanding
presence, doesn't she?

164
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,958
Yeah, but why are we running?

165
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,000
'Cause when Erza's mad,
she gets scary,

Quiet, man. You know
she has ears like a fox.

[LECTOR]
So, while we're on the topic,

169
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,625
I was just wondering, Erza,

170
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:51,333
how highly would you rate
your culinary technique?

171
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,583
Well,

172
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm nothing extraordinary,
but I can make do.

173
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,333
You make do?

174
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,833
As in make someone else
do it for ya, am I right?

175
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,375
Sounds right to me.

I have not enslaved a chef.
Mira and Lisanna enjoy cooking.

And they have
demonstrated that they are

178
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,250
far more skilled at that than I.

179
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:10,750
I'm kinda startin' to wonder if
you've ever turned on an oven.

Yo, m'lady! We
found her weakness!

181

Next time she starts sassin' ya,
challenge her to a cook off.

182
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,166
Stick her in the stove!

Just checking,

188
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,458
if there were to be a cooking

and not involving me, right?

Why is everything a contest?

Not even a spark.

316
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,125
[LUCY] I'm running out
of breath so fast.

317
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,833
It's like this water's
draining my strength.

318
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:47,000
[LUCY]
Oh, no. I'm gonna black out.

319
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:53,250
[GAJEEL] How's this guy
so fast underwater?

320
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:57,041
And why's the other one just
watching? Cocky bastards.

321
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,666
Salamander, listen! You
can't fight in this stuff!

322
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,125
Just take the girls
and find a way out!

323
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,625
[GAJEEL]
Whoa. Salamander's down.

324
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,583
Juvia. Lucy.

325
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,958
[TORAFUZAR] That's what happens
when you swallow this water.

326
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:20,791
It's lethal to humans. They'll
be dead in five minutes.

327
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,291
Oh, wait.

328
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,125
Your kind needs air to live,
so they'll probably be gone

329
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,500
before the poison's
done its work.

330
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,750
[GAJEEL] If I can take him
out, the water goes too.

331
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,375
[TORAFUZAR] You're out
of your element, slayer.

332
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,541
[GAJEEL]
He's too fast.

333
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,125
[TORAFUZAR]
Deep Impact!

334
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:58,875
[LEVY]
There he is!

335
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,375
[GAJEEL]
C'mon, get up!

336
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,833
So not only did you
survive Deep Impact,

337
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,958
you're back on your feet.

338
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,333
Very impressive.

339
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,125
At least for a human.

340
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,666
[GAJEEL] One more hit
like that and I'm through.

341
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:15,750
But prepare to be lost
in a pitch black sea.

342
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,916
[GAJEEL] I can move faster
than him, even underwater.

343
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,166
I just have to be a shadow.

344
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,750
[GAJEEL]
Iron Dragon Sword!

345
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,541
[GAJEEL]
No way. He's too strong.

346
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,458
This is Tartaros!

347
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,458
[GAJEEL]
If I could...

348
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,166
[GAJEEL]
...just breathe.

349
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,500
[GAJEEL]
Damn it. I can't even move now.

350
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,000
[GAJEEL]
I could take this guy...

351
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,333
...if only I had some air.

352
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,416
[GAJEEL]
My vision's fading.

353
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,208
All I can see are black clouds.

354
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,833
[GAJEEL]
This is how I die.

355
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:45,458
Drowning, falling,
fading into black.

356
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,166
[GAJEEL]
Light? I don't need light.

357
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,291
Air. Give me some air!

358
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:02,958
[GAJEEL] Screw your
tunnel. I ain't goin'.

359
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:12,500
[TORAFUZAR]
Uh?

360
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,791
[GAJEEL]
I'm breathing.

361
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,958
[GAJEEL]
Levy?! How did she get here?!

362
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:28,125
I'll teach you to
meddle in my fights!

363
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:38,041
[GAJEEL]
Don't you touch her!

364
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:16,458
[LUCY] Levy's devotion may have
given Gajeel a fighting chance,

365
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:20,833
but Torafuzar has never met his
match in the Underworld's sea.

366
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:23,708
Its black, poisonous waters
slowly work their way

367
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:25,916
into the chinks
of Gajeel's armor,

368
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,291
until he succumbs
to them at last.

369
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:31,166
But then, right when
all seems to be lost,

370
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,625
Gajeel is struck by a memory
that strengthens his spirit.

371
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:38,041
Next Time:
"Tartaros Chapter Steel."

372
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:41,208
Only through our feelings
can we battle despair.
