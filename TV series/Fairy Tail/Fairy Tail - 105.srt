1
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:22,166
- Hades: I WASN'T EXPECTING
TO REUNITE WITH MY OLD FRIEND

2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,958
MAKAROV.

3
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,500
WHILE IT'S UNFORTUNATE,

4
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:28,125
IF WE WANT TO BE VICTORIOUS,
WE HAVE NO CHOICE

5
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:31,000
BUT TO ANNIHILATE
THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD.

6
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,583
FOR ONCE THEY'RE
OUT OF THE WAY, 

7
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,916
WE CAN PURSUE
OUR TRUE OBJECTIVE,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,416
FINDING ZEREF.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,458
GOD SPEED,
SEVEN KIN OF PURGATORY.

10
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,958
I AWAIT YOUR GOOD NEWS.

11
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:47,416
- ( theme music plays )

12
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

13
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:29,083
- I HOPE YOU FOOLS ARE
PREPARED TO DO BATTLE WITH ME.

14
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,791
- Lucy: A GOAT?!

15
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,875
- THERE'S SOMETHING
WEIRD ABOUT THIS GUY,

16
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:35,291
BUT I CAN'T QUITE
PUT MY FINGER ON WHAT IT IS.

17
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,625
- I CAN TELL YOU
WHAT'S WEIRD ABOUT HIM.

18
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,666
HE'S A GOAT.
- STAY BACK, LUCY.

19
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,416
I'LL PROTECT YOU.

20
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,583
- ALLOW ME
TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

21
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,458
I'M ONE OF THE SEVEN KIN,
CAPRICO.

22
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,041
- THE SEVEN WHAT NOW?
WHAT THE HECK DOES THAT MEAN?

23
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,750
- GRIMOIRE HEART'S GOT
SIX MORE WIZARDS

24
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,291
WHO ARE JUST AS STRONG
AS THIS GUY?

25
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,166
- CAPRICO.

26
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,500
- Hades: MAKAROV.

27
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,166
YOU'VE DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB
OF LEADING THE GUILD

28
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,125
FOR THE LAST
48 YEARS.

29
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:20,916
HOWEVER, I'M AFRAID
YOUR TIME IS UP, OLD FRIEND.

30
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,958
YOUR REIGN AS FAIRY TAIL'S
MASTER ENDS TODAY.

31
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:29,041
HISTORY IS COMING TO A CLOSE
FOR BOTH YOU AND YOUR GUILD.

32
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,000
- Happy:
"FIRE DRAGON VS. FLAME GOD"!

33
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,166
- ( growls )

34
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,541
- ( chuckles )

35
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,208
YOU LEFT YOURSELF
WIDE OPEN, DUMB ASS.

36
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,666
I WAS EXPECTING MORE POWER
FROM A DRAGON HUNTER LIKE YOU.

37
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,666
YOU'RE NOT
HOLDING BACK ON ME,

38
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,458
ARE YOU?
- YOU JUST WAIT.

39
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,541
NOW THAT MY BODY'S WARMED UP,
I'M READY TO FIGHT.

40
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,375
YOU'RE GONNA WISH YOU
HADN'T ASKED THAT QUESTION.

41
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,250
- CAREFUL, NATSU.
- HE'LL BE FINE

42
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,833
BECAUSE THE ENEMY
DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE

43
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,916
WHEN HE'S ALL FIRED UP
LIKE HE IS RIGHT NOW. 

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,833
- BUT HIS ATTACKS
HAVEN'T HAD ANY EFFECT.

45
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,458
WHO IS THAT FIEND?
- HE JUST REFERRED TO HIMSELF

46
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,000
AS A GOD SLAYER.

47
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,666
BUT I'M NOT SURE
IF THAT'S REALLY HIS POWER

48
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,916
OR HE'S TRYING
TO TALK TOUGH.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
- LET ME INTRODUCE MYSELF.

50
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,375
I'M ONE OF GRIMOIRE HEART'S
SEVEN KIN,

51
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,791
AND THE GUY WHO'S GONNA
KICK YOUR ASS.

52
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,791
I'M KNOWN AS THE GOD SLAYER
NAMED ZANCROW.

53
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,958
- WELL, I'M KNOWN AS
THE DRAGON SLAYER.

54
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,708
I'M NATSU OF FAIRY TAIL.

55
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,250
( laughs ) I KNOW
WHO YOU ARE, DRAGON BREATH.

56
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,375
YOU'RE FAMOUS
IN THE BARAM ALLIANCE

57
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,291
BECAUSE OF ALL THE DESTRUCTION
YOU LEAVE IN YOUR WAKE.

58
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,583
- SAY WHAT?!

59
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,125
- THE BARAM ALLIANCE?
CARE TO EXPLAIN?

60
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,708
- AYE, SIR, THEY'RE BAD GUYS
WHO BANDED TOGETHER

61
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,000
TO WREAK HAVOC.
- YES, GRIMOIRE HEART,

62
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,208
THE ORACION SEIS,
AND TARTAROS

63
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,833
JOINED FORCES TO CREATE
A COALITION OF DARK GUILDS.

64
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,375
- OUR COALITION
OF LIGHT GUILDS

65
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,166
WAS ABLE TO BEAT 
THE ORACION SEIS,

66
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,125
BUT I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT BEATING GRIMOIRE HEART.

67
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,708
I MEAN, THEY'RE
THE STRONGEST MEMBER

68
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,250
OF THE BARAM ALLIANCE.
WE DON'T STAND A CHANCE.

69
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,083
- YOU ANNIHILATED LULLABY.

70
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,291
YOU STOPPED US FROM
BEING BACK DELIORA.

71
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,083
AND THEN YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS
REALLY SCREWED UP OUR PLANS

72
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,250
WHEN YOU WIPED OUT
THE R-SYSTEM AND NIRVANA!

73
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:06,375
YOU TOOK DOWN JELLAL,
AS WELL AS MASTER ZERO.

74
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,250
IF YOU THINK THAT
MAKES YOU HOT STUFF,

75
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,000
LET ME TELL YOU, THOSE GUYS
AIN'T NOTHING COMPARED TO ME.

76
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,041
- I CAN TAKE YOU.

77
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,875
- YOU'RE JUST A LOWLY DRAGON
HUNTER. DON'T BE SO COCKY.

78
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,500
- KNOW WHAT'S COCKY?
CALLING YOURSELF A GOD SLAYER!

79
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,083
WHAT'S THAT EVEN MEAN?

80
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,333
YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE
A GOD TRAINED YOU?!

81
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:30,083
- I GUESS IF YOU CALL
MASTER HADES A GOD,

82
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,541
THEN YEAH, 'CAUSE HE'S
THE ONE WHO TRAINED ME

83
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,583
TO USE THIS AWESOME
LOST MAGIC.

84
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,208
- GIVE ME A BREAK!
YOUR MASTER AIN'T A GOD!

85
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,958
HE'S JUST
A REGULAR OLD PERSON.

86
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,791
UNLIKE YOU, EVERYTHING I KNOW
ABOUT DRAGON SLAYER MAGIC

87
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:43,000
I LEARNED FROM
AN ACTUAL DRAGON!

88
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,000
- YOU REALLY THINK
I GIVE A CRAP?

89
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,791
DRAGONS ARE JUST
FLYING LIZARDS. 

90
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,541
WANT TO ASK THIS LITTLE GUY
IF HE'S GOT ANY MAGIC?

91
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,833
- HEY, MAN, IGNEEL'S NOT
A FRICKIN' LIZARD!

92
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,250
- YEAH, YOU TELL HIM.

93
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,833
GRANDINE IS NOT A LIZARD EITHER,

94
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,083
YOU BIG MEANY.
- DON'T ENCOURAGE HIM, WENDY.

95
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,208
- I'D SHUT UP AND SIT PRETTY
IF I WERE YOU.

96
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,708
I GOT MY HANDS FULL
WITH PINKY,

97
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,083
BUT AS SOON AS
I'M THROUGH WITH HIM,

98
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,500
YOU'RE GONNA BE UP NEXT.

99
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,250
( cackles )

100
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,416
- ( whimpering )

101
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,041
HE'S NOT MESSING AROUND.

102
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,833
- I WON'T LET YOU
LAY A FINGER ON THIS CHILD.

103
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:10,916
- HEY, YOU!

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,500
DON'T GO GETTING DISTRACTED!

105
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,916
YOU BETTER GET
OUT OF HERE, GUYS.

106
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,041
- ( snickers )
BRINGING OUT THE BIG GUNS, HUH?

107
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:25,458
- THE FLAMES OF MY RIGHT HAND
AND THE FLAMES OF LEFT!

108
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:26,541
PUT THEM TOGETHER
AND YOU GET...

109
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,375
- I ASK YOU TO SCORCH ALL

110
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,166
FROM THE FAR WEST
TO THE FAR EAST,

111
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,583
OH, BREATH OF GOD.

112
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:34,833
- FIRE DRAGON...
- FLAME GOD...

113
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,250
- BRILLIANT FLAME!

114
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,458
- KAGUTSCHI!

115
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,125
- ( screams )

116
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,166
- Pantherlily:
WHAT INCREDIBLE POWER.

117
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,041
- Carla: AND SUCH
TREMENDOUS HEAT! 

118
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,708
- Wendy: THE POWERS
OF A DRAGON AND A GOD

119
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,041
ARE COLLIDING.

120
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,791
- ( growls )

121
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,750
- ( chuckles )

122
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,875
- ( strains )

123
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,125
OH, NO YOU DON'T!

124
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,375
( struggling grunts )

125
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,541
- ( gasps )

126
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,708
- ( screams )

127
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,333
- NATSU!

128
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:12,375
- NO WAY.
- THAT GUY OVERPOWERED HIM.

129
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,333
- ENOUGH WITH
THE PLAY-BY-PLAY.

130
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:15,666
GET LOST, CATS.

131
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,833
- ( all screams )

132
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,625
- ( gasps )
- ( cackles )

133
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,333
UH-OH, IT WASN'T
JUST CATS.

134
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,916
THAT PUNY LITTLE BRAT'S
A DRAGON HUNTER TOO.

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,500
OH, WELL, THAT'LL TEACH HER
NOT TO MESS WITH ME.

136
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,583
( laughs )
- WENDY,

137
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,041
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

138
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,666
- TO THINK THIS BARBARIAN

139
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,333
COULD EASILY OUTCLASS
A DRAGON SLAYER

140
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,458
WHO IS AS
STRONG AS GAJEEL.

141
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,083
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

142
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,708
THIS MUST BE THE POWER
OF LOST MAGIC.

143
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,291
- ( frustrated growl )

144
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,416
I'LL SHOW YOU!

145
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,208
FIRE DRAGON ROAR!

146
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,083
- NICE TRY, PAL.

147
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,708
BUT DON'T YOU KNOW
IT WAS THE DIVINE 

148
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,666
WHO GRANTED HUMANS
THE KNOWLEDGE OF FIRE.

149
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,000
IT WASN'T CREATED
BY MANKIND OR DRAGONS.

150
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,000
IT WAS THE GODS!

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,250
- ( sighs )
I GOT HIM. 

152
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,625
( gasps )

153
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,166
- ( slurps )

154
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:15,291
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
NO WAY!

155
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,625
- ( burps )

156
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,791
- HE HAS NO MANNERS.

157
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,833
- HE ATE ALL
OF NATSU'S FLAMES.

158
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,583
DID YOU SEE THAT, CARLA?

159
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,916
- THAT'S SOME TASTY FIRE
YOU GOT THERE.

160
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,500
NOTHING I LIKE MORE
THAN THE FLAVOR

161
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,541
OF VIOLENT,
NEVER-ENDING FLAMES.

162
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,458
EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY
HAVE ENOUGH POWER

163
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:34,541
TO SLAY A DRAGON,
YOU COULD NEVER SLAY A GOD.

164
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:39,166
PREPARE TO WITNESS THE POWER
OF GRIMOIRE HEART'S MAGIC.

165
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,833
FLAME GOD BELLOW!

166
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,541
( screams )

167
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:43,666
- ( gasps )

168
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,458
- ( screaming )

169
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:50,625
- ( screams )

170
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,416
- NATSU, NO!

171
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:58,166
NATSU!

172
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,666
- WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
THOSE TWO DRAGON HUNTERS

173
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,541
HIT ROCK BOTTOM.
( laughs )

174
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,666
( cackles )

175
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,083
( laughter echoes )

176
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,541
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

177
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,291
WHAT'S GOING ON?

178
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,708
- HOW COME WE
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE

179
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,375
TO LAND A SINGLE HIT
ON THIS GOAT FREAK? 

180
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,833
- COME ON, LOKE.
- GOTCHA!

181
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:26,583
- NOT AGAIN!

182
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,791
SOMETHING FEELS OFF.

183
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,041
I'M SENSING THIS 
STRANGE PRESENCE.

184
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,083
WHAT COULD IT BE?

185
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,458
- THIS GUY IS STRONG.

186
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,458
HE'S ABLE TO FEND OFF
ALL FOUR OF US.

187
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,791
WHO IS HE?
- I'VE HAD ENOUGH!

188
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,500
I'M NOT ABOUT
TO WASTE MY TIME

189
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,125
GETTING ALL WORKED UP
OVER A STUPID GOAT!

190
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,458
WHAT THE--?
HOW'D I MISS HIM AGAIN?

191
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,750
- WHAT'S HIS SECRET?
IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S USING

192
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,666
SOME SORT OF MAGIC
TO DODGE US.

193
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,583
AND FROM WHAT I CAN TELL,
HE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

194
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,416
READING OUR MOVES
LIKE COBRA.

195
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,666
- I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT,
BUT I GOT THIS FEELING.

196
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,041
I JUST KNOW THAT NONE OF
OUR ATTACKS ARE GONNA HIT HIM.

197
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,958
I KEEP THINKING
WHAT'S THE USE OF FIGHTING

198
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,500
IF YOU CAN'T WIN.
WE'RE SCREWED!

199
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,791
- VERY PERCEPTIVE OF YOU.

200
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,666
YOU ARE POWERLESS
AGAINST ME IN BATTLE.

201
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,666
NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES
YOU TRY TO ATTACK,

202
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,500
YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO HIT ME.

203
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:21,000
YOU MIGHT AS WELL GIVE UP. 
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO,

204
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,750
BUT REVERE AND WORSHIP ME.

205
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,500
- THERE IT IS AGAIN.

206
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,458
I KEEP FEELING
THIS STRANGE PRESSURE.

207
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,666
- MAN, I WISH I KNEW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

208
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,833
WHERE'S THIS SENSE
OF HOPELESSNESS COMING FROM?

209
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,958
- CAPRICO.

210
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,500
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

211
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:37,666
IT'S DEFINITELY HIM.

212
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,916
THIS COULD BE BAD,

213
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,583
ESPECIALLY FOR LUCY.

214
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,125
- ( Natsu groans )

215
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,208
AH, MAN.

216
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,500
THAT GUY'S HARDCORE.

217
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,958
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE FIRE'S

218
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,083
ACTUALLY FELT HOT TO ME.

219
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,625
WAIT, WHERE
IN THE HECK AM I?

220
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,541
HUH?
( sniffs )

221
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:58,916
I KNOW THAT SMELL.

222
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,125
( panting )

223
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

224
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,333
( gasps )
OH.

225
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,958
WHOA, GRAMPS.

226
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,250
NO WAY.

227
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,750
ARE YOU OKAY?

228
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,083
- NATSU, IT'S YOU.

229
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,083
- WHAT IN THE WORLD
HAPPENED TO YOU?

230
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,541
OH, CRAP, YOU'RE HURT
REAL BAD, AREN'T YOU?

231
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:26,833
I'M KIND OF SCARED
TO MOVE YOU,

232
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,416
BUT WE GOT TO
GET YOU TO WENDY.

233
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,125
OF COURSE THAT'S A LOT EASIER
SAID THAN DONE

234
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,833
BECAUSE I HAVE NO IDEA 
WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW!

235
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,166
- NATSU.

236
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,500
- HOW'D YOU GET
SO BEAT UP?

237
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,125
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHO DID THIS TO YOU?

238
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:41,125
- NATSU, LISTEN.

239
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:45,833
THE CHANCES OF US
DEFEATING GRIMOIRE HEART

240
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,583
ARE NIL.

241
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,333
- YOU MUST BE OUT OF
YOUR MIND RIGHT NOW!

242
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,916
THE GRAMPS I KNOW WOULD NEVER
SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

243
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,583
- YOU'RE INJURED, MY BOY.

244
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,583
WHO DID THAT TO YOU?

245
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,916
- THIS AIN'T NOTHING COMPARED
TO WHAT I'M GONNA DO TO HIM.

246
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,666
THE NEXT TIME I SEE 
THAT CHUMP, IT'S ON.

247
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,958
- I BEG YOU, NATSU.

248
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,208
- HUH?
- GATHER ALL THE OTHERS

249
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,125
AND LEAVE WHILE YOU CAN.

250
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,291
- WOULD YOU QUIT
TALKING LIKE THAT?

251
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,875
WE'RE NOT THROUGH
WITH THE S-CLASS TRIAL.

252
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,916
AS FAIRY TAIL'S MASTER,
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SUPPORT US.

253
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,166
NOT TELL US WE CAN'T WIN.

254
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,250
- WHILE THAT'S TRUE,

255
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,208
THERE ARE TIMES
WHEN THE BEST THING TO DO

256
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,041
IS RETREAT.

257
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,541
MASTER.

258
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,625
- ( Zancrow laughs )
WELL, WELL, WELL.

259
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,916
IT LOOKS LIKE MASTER HADES
DID A NUMBER ON YOU,

260
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,083
EH, MAKAROV?
( laughs )

261
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,875
- HE'S THE ONE
WHO DID THIS? 

262
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,625
- LET IT GO, MY BOY.

263
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,083
REMEMBER WHAT
I JUST TOLD YOU.

264
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,541
- I AIN'T BACKING DOWN.

265
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,458
( shaky breathing )
- HMM?

266
00:12:56,541 --> 00:13:00,458
NATSU.
HE'S TREMBLING IN FEAR.

267
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:14,250
- Makarov: NATSU.
HE'S TREMBLING IN FEAR.

268
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,541
- YOU HAVING A HARD TIME,
DRAGON HUNTER?

269
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,208
LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE FREAKING OUT

270
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:19,750
'CAUSE THERE'S SWEAT DRIPPING
FROM EVERY PORE.

271
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,166
- I...

272
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,541
ACCEPT DEFEAT.

273
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,250
- Gildarts:
REMEMBER, NATSU,

274
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,625
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH FEELING FEAR.

275
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,541
AFTER ALL,
HOW ELSE WOULD WE

276
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,375
COME TO KNOW
OUR OWN WEAKNESSES?

277
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:42,958
- ( shivering )

278
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,541
THIS FEELING,
THIS IS FEAR.

279
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,666
- NATSU.

280
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,208
- ( laughs )

281
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,500
YUP, YOU GOT IT.

282
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,125
I CAN'T SAY 
I BLAME YOU.

283
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,083
IT'S GOT TO BE TERRIFYING
FOR A RUNT LIKE YOU

284
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,833
TO FACE MY ULTIMATE POWER.

285
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,458
IF I WERE YOU, I'D STAND
THERE TREMBLING IN FEAR TOO.

286
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,458
- ( shivering )
- YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH.

287
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,458
GET OUT OF HERE.

288
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,916
- ( laughing )

289
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,875
- HE'S RIGHT.

290
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,583
THIS IS FEAR
I'M FEELING.

291
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,791
BU IT'S NOT THE SAME
KIND OF FEAR

292
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,250
THAT GILDARTS
WAS TALKING ABOUT.

293
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,125
- HUH?

294
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,000
- ( fire crackles )

295
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:29,541
- I AIN'T TREMBLING
BECAUSE OF YOU.

296
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,833
THE ONLY THING
I'M AFRAID OF RIGHT NOW

297
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,750
IS THAT SOMEONE ELSE'LL DO IN
THE JERK WHO BEAT UP GRAMPS

298
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,583
BEFORE I GET THE CHANCE
TO GET A FEW GOOD LICKS IN.

299
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,458
YOU'RE GONNA PAY.

300
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:45,000
I WON'T LET YOU GUYS
GET AWAY WITH THIS. 

301
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,958
I'LL TAKE DOWN
MASTER HADES. 

302
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,333
AND I'LL DO IT
WITH MY OWN TWO HANDS!

303
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,500
- UNFORTUNATELY,
IT WOULD APPEAR 

304
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:55,875
I GOT THE SHORT END
OF THE STICK

305
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,458
WHEN IT COMES TO OPPONENTS.

306
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:58,583
- Mirajane:
THE SHORT END OF THE STICK?

307
00:14:58,666 --> 00:14:59,916
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

308
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,833
- WELL, I DON'T
MEAN TO OFFEND YOU,

309
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,375
BUT AFTER BEING FORCED
TO FIGHT CATS AND CHILDREN,

310
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,125
I'D HOPED TO FACE A MORE
CHALLENGING ADVERSARY

311
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,583
THAN A COUPLE
OF YOUNG LADIES.

312
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,375
- IF HE WAS FIGHTING CATS
AND CHILDREN,

313
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,916
THEN THAT MEANS...

314
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
- HE MUST HAVE FOUGHT
HAPPY AND WENDY'S TEAMS.

315
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,708
- I DON'T SEE WHY WHO I FOUGHT
MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE TO YOU.

316
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,541
ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW
IS I DEFEATED THEM

317
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,666
AND I'LL DO THE SAME HERE.

318
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,166
- ( gasps )
- ( rumbling )

319
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,208
- HIS MAGIC IS SO STRONG.

320
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,875
- LISANNA,
YOU'RE NOT HURT, ARE YOU?

321
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:33,083
- NO, I'M OKAY.
- THIS WIZARD, HE'S POWERFUL.

322
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,750
- YEAH, NO KIDDING,
BUT I KNOW WE CAN BEAT HIM.

323
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,958
NOW TAKE OVER!
ANIMAL SOUL!

324
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:44,250
- SO TAKE OVER MAGIC, HUH?

325
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,833
I CERTAINLY WASN'T
EXPECTING THAT FROM YOU.

326
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,750
- FOLLOWED BY...
- HMM?

327
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,208
- PENGUIN!

328
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:54,416
- SHE INSTANTLY SWITCHED 
TO A DIFFERENT TAKE OVER.

329
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,875
WHEN DID SHE LEARN
SUCH AN ADVANCED MOVE?

330
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,958
- DON'T UNDERESTIMATE ME.

331
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,166
I'M YOUNG, BUT I'M AS TOUGH
AS THE OTHER FAIRY TAIL WIZARDS.

332
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,458
- BLEVE!

333
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:09,916
- GOTCHA!

334
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,166
( meows )

335
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,666
- LISANNA!

336
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,708
- JUST STAY BACK.
I GOT THIS.

337
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,375
- I'M IMPRESSED.

338
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,875
YOU'RE A MUCH BETTER
FIGHTER THAN I EXPECTED.

339
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,708
THAT'S SAID,
ALLOW ME TO SHOW YOU

340
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,583
WHY I'M CONFIDENT
YOU'LL NEVER DEFEAT ME.

341
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,875
YOU CAN'T WIN A BATTLE
WITH SPIRIT AND SENTIMENT ALONE.

342
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,291
IT TAKES SKILL.

343
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,250
AND MINE GREATLY
SURPASSES YOURS.

344
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,666
ARE YOU REALLY WILLING
TO RISK YOUR LIFE

345
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,625
IN AN ATTEMPT TO PROVE
YOUR STRENGTH TO ME?

346
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,166
- WHAT DO YOU
MEAN BY THAT?

347
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,583
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
A DIFFERENCE IN POWER.

348
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,125
YOU'RE STRONGER THAN ME.
WHO CARES?!

349
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,166
WE JUST WANT TO 
PROTECT OUR CAMP

350
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,791
SO OUR FRIENDS KNOW
WHERE TO FIND US.

351
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,916
- FRANKLY,
I COULDN'T CARE LESS.

352
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,375
I WAS SENT HERE TO FIGHT YOU,
SO THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.

353
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,166
- YOU OKAY?

354
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,041
- I WANT YOU TO GO
AND LOOK FOR THE OTHERS.

355
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,416
MEANWHILE, I'LL STAY HERE
AND KEEP THIS GUY BUSY.

356
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,250
- I CAN'T LEAVE
YOU ALONE WITH HIM.

357
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,250
- WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?

358
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,333
I BARELY SENSED ANY MAGIC POWER
FROM HER BEFORE,

359
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,375
BUT THEN SHE SUDDENLY
GAVE OFF

360
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,333
A TREMENDOUS
SENSE OF PRESSURE.

361
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,291
- I'M GONNA FIGHT WITH YOU.

362
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,708
IF WE WORK TOGETHER,
WE'VE GOT

363
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,166
A BETTER CHANCE
OF BEATING HIM.

364
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,708
- YOU'RE JUST AS
STUBBORN AS BEFORE.

365
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,416
VERY WELL THEN.

366
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,291
- TWO AGAINST ONE
MEANS I DON'T HAVE TO HOLD BACK.

367
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,583
- Mirajane:
MESS WITH OUR GUILD--

368
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,500
NO, OUR FAMILY--

369
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,916
AND YOU'RE IN
A FOR A WORLD OF HURT!

370
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,125
- Zancrow: YOU THINK
YOU CAN TAKE DOWN MASTER HADES?

371
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,083
( laughs )

372
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:47,208
THERE AIN'T NO WAY IN HELL
THAT'S EVER GONNA HAPPEN

373
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,083
IF YOU CAN'T EVEN BEAT ME,
YOU PUNK.

374
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,416
- I TOLD YOU.  YOUR FLAMES
HAVE NO EFFECT ON ME.

375
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,000
- OH, NO, IT CAN'T BE.

376
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,416
HE USES FIRE MAGIC TOO?

377
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,041
- YOUR DRAGON FIRE'S GOT
NOTHING ON MY DIVINE FLAMES.

378
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,250
THEY'RE ON A COMPLETELY...

379
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,166
- ( grunts )
- DIFFERENT LEVEL.

380
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,000
MY FLAMES DO MORE
THAN JUST BURN STUFF.

381
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,708
THEY BECOME
A WEAPON OF FIRE

382
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,500
THAT CAN DEFEAT ANY ENEMY.

383
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:20,750
( laughs )

384
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,250
( cackles )

385
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:38,666
- ( grunting )

386
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,583
- GOT YA'!

387
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:41,791
- ( gasps )

388
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,083
- MY FLAMES LOVE
TO CONSUME

389
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,708
PUNY WIZARDS LIKE YOU.

390
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,208
YOU'RE GOING DOWN!

391
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,916
FLAME GOD...

392
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,916
SUPPER!

393
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,375
- ( screams )

394
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,041
- YOU SHOULD QUIT FIGHTING

395
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,791
'CAUSE ONCE MY BLAZE
HAS GOT YOU,

396
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,333
THERE'S NO GETTING OUT!

397
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,250
NOT TILL YOU'VE BEEN
TURNED TO ASH.

398
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,625
- ( screams )

399
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:10,333
- NATSU, NO.

400
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,375
- OH, YEAH,
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

401
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,625
I CAN STILL EAT
MY WAY OF HERE, YOU KNOW?

402
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,375
- GO AHEAD AND TRY IT,

403
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,458
BUT THERE'S NO WAY A WIZARD
WITH DRAGON'S POWER

404
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,041
COULD EVER EAT 
A DIVINE FLAME.

405
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,333
- ( slurps )

406
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,416
( screams )

407
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,416
- DON'T SAY THAT
I DIDN'T WARN YOU!

408
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,541
( groans )

409
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,666
( grunting )

410
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,000
A GIANT, HUH?

411
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:37,708
- GRAMPS!
- HOW DARE YOU.

412
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,500
WHAT KIND OF
HEARTLESS MONSTER

413
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,333
WOULD HARM ONE OF MY CHILDREN
RIGHT BEFORE MY VERY EYES?!

414
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,250
STOP OR I'LL CRUSH YOU
LIKE AN INSECT.

415
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,583
- ( gags )
- AND WHEN I'M DONE,

416
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,083
THERE WON'T BE
ANY TRACE OF YOU!

417
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,625
- HOW CAN YOU BE SURE
YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH

418
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,083
STRENGTH LEFT, OLD MAN?

419
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,000
- ( strains )

420
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,250
- AWW, COME ON,
YOU BETTER LET GO OF ME SOON.

421
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,375
OTHERWISE, THE ONLY THING
THAT'S GONNA VANISH

422
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,375
WITHOUT A TRACE
IS YOUR ARM.

423
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,500
- ( strains )

424
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,333
( screams )

425
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,875
- YOU CRAZY? LET GO.

426
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,750
DO YOU REALLY WANT
TO LOSE THAT ARM? 

427
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,708
- IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES,
SO BE IT.

428
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,458
- PLEASE, JUST LET GO
OF HIM, GRAMPS.

429
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:21,875
- ( growls )
LET ME GO!

430
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,083
- Natsu:
I'M BEGGING YOU, LET GO.

431
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,458
- I PITY YOU, YOUNG MAN,

432
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:27,458
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW

433
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,208
THE POWER OF FAMILY!

434
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,041
- ( hisses )

435
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:37,375
( grunts )

436
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,458
( growls )

437
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,083
- IS IT GONNA BE
THE DRAGON HUNTER,

438
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,500
MAKAROV, OR ME?

439
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,958
WHICH ONE OF US
WILL KICK THE BUCKET FIRST?

440
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,125
- ( screams )

441
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,083
- ( power sizzles )

442
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,291
- NATSU'S MAGIC POWER,

443
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,375
IT'S GONE.

444
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,000
- ( laughs )

445
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,875
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
THE DRAGON HUNTER'S

446
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,541
THE FIRST TO GO.
( laughs )

447
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,000
- ( slurps )

448
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,791
- ( burbles )
- ( gasps )

449
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,208
- ( slurping )

450
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,750
- NO, IMPOSSIBLE!

451
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,250
A DRAGON HUNTER SHOULDN'T
BE ABLE TO EAT MY FLAMES!

452
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,416
- Makarov: AMAZING.

453
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,291
BY USING EVERY LAST DROP
OF HIS OWN MAGIC POWER, 

454
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:25,625
HE BECAME A VESSEL CAPABLE 
OF CONSUMING INEDIBLE FIRE.

455
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,458
- I GET IT NOW.

456
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,250
I HAD NO CLUE
THERE WAS SPECIAL TRICK

457
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,875
TO EATING CERTAIN
TYPES OF FIRE.

458
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,041
- Makarov: NO WAY!

459
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,541
I WOULDN'T CALL

460
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,583
THAT LEVEL OF MAGIC
"A SPECIAL TRICK."

461
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:39,791
HE EMPTIED HIS BODY
OF MAGIC POWER

462
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:43,208
WHILE THE ENEMY'S BEGAN
TO BUILD UP INSIDE.

463
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,416
HOW COULD YOU
BE SO FOOLISH, NATSU?!

464
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,208
DO YOU WANT TO DIE?!

465
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,291
- OF COURSE I DON'T, GRAMPS.

466
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:54,333
AND I WON'T LET
ANYONE ELSE, EITHER.

467
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,708
NO ONE'S DYING.

468
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,708
AT LEAST NOT ON MY WATCH,
ANYWAY.

469
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,916
WE'RE ALL GONNA MAKE IT
BACK HOME TO FAIRY TAIL.

470
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,500
( growls )

471
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,500
DRAGON AND DIVINE FLAMES,

472
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,666
COME TOGETHER 
TO BECOME ONE!

473
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,416
DRAGON GOD...

474
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,708
BRILLIANT FLAME!

475
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:20,000
- ( cackles )

476
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,000
- ( gasps )

477
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:29,000
I CAN'T BELIEVE 
HE ACTUALLY WON.

478
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,500
HE'S GROWN SO MUCH...

479
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,333
- ( pants slowly )
- INTO AN AMAZING WIZARD.

480
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:36,833
- ( theme music plays )
- ( panting )

481
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,458
I DID IT.

482
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,208
- ( singing in Japanese )

483
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:14,333
- Natsu: YOU SEE THAT?
I TOTALLY WON.

484
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:16,000
- Happy: THAT'S GREAT, BUT YOU
SHOULDN'T USE YOUR MAGIC

485
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:18,458
SO RECKLESSLY.
THAT WAS SUCH A HUGE GAMBLE.

486
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,041
I MEAN, USING UP 
ALL OF YOUR POWER

487
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,041
AND THEN ABSORBING
YOUR OPPONENT'S.

488
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,458
- Natsu: GIVE ME A BREAK.

489
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:24,000
THERE'S NO WRONG WAY
TO USE MAGIC.

490
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:25,500
BESIDES, ARE YOU 
REALLY SURPRISED?

491
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:27,458
KICKING BUTT IS WHAT I DO.
- Happy: YOU KNOW,

492
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:28,750
YOU WOULD HAVE SOUNDED
A LOT COOLER

493
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,541
IF YOU HADN'T SAID
THAT LAST PART.

494
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:33,416
- Happy and Natsu:
NEXT TIME, "GRAND MAGIC WORLD"!

495
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,833
- Happy: YOU KNOW, IT TAKES A
LOT OF GUTS TO BRAG LIKE THAT

496
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:37,375
AFTER YOU BARELY
BEAT THE GUY.

497
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:39,458
- Natsu: SAYS THE CAT WHO'S
NEVER WON A FIGHT ON HIS OWN.

498
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:41,625
- Happy: GEEZ, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO GO REMINDING ME!
