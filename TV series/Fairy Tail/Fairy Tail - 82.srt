1
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,875
- Natsu:
PREVIOUSLY ON FAIRY TAIL...

2
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:21,916
- Happy: SCARY LUCY
SAVED THE DAY!

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,708
- Natsu: DEEP DOWN,
THE REAL LUCY AND THE SCARY ONE

4
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,125
AREN'T SO DIFFERENT AFTER ALL.

5
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,750
- Lucy: QUIT CALLING US "REAL"
AND "SCARY," WOULD YOU?

6
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:29,458
- Happy: BUT THREE LUCYS
TOGETHER WAS JUST WAY TOO MUCH.

7
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:30,875
- Lucy: I HAVE TO AGREE.

8
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,416
- Natsu: THE THREE OF
YOU SHOULD COMBINE INTO

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,833
ONE GIANT MEGA LUCY!

10
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,791
- Happy: THERE'S ENOUGH MONSTERS
IN THE WORLD ALREADY.

11
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,041
- Lucys: WATCH IT, CAT!

12
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,208
- CAN WE PLEASE JUST
GET BACK TO THE STORY?

13
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,541
- ( theme song playing )

14
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,708
- ( singing in Japanese )

15
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,333
- I DON'T KNOW WHY. I'M SORRY!
PLEASE, DON'T HURT ME!

16
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:23,666
- All: HUH?

17
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,125
- Natsu: WHAT THE...

18
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,791
ARE YOU THE SAME OTHER ME
FROM JUST A MINUTE AGO?

19
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:33,000
- YES! OF COURSE
I'M THE EXACT SAME GUY!

20
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,416
BUT PEOPLE SAY I'M LIKE A
DIFFERENT PERSON

21
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,625
BEHIND THE WHEEL!

22
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:38,666
- THIS WORLD'S NATSU
IS A TOTAL SCAREDY-CAT!

23
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,916
- ( whimpers ) PLEASE,
YOU GUYS ARE FREAKING ME OUT!

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,208
DON'T SCREAM.

25
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,666
- IT'S JUST LIKE LOOKING
INTO A MIRROR, ISN'T IT, NATSU?

26
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,000
- ( Happy reading out
on screen text )

27
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,458
- I'M SORRY!
I'M REALLY, REALLY, SORRY!

28
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,583
BUT THIS IS AS FAR AS
I CAN TAKE YOU!

29
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:01,833
- HOW COME?

30
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,541
- THE ONLY REASON I CAME
IN THE FIRST PLACE IS

31
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,708
BECAUSE MY LUCY TOLD ME
I HAD TO!

32
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,916
- AWW, WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DO ANYTHING THAT SCARES YOU.

33
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,500
- WE DEFINITELY DON'T HAVE
ROOM FOR A BLUBBERING COWARD

34
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:15,583
ON OUR TEAM.

35
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,833
- DON'T BE RUDE!

36
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,041
- HMM.

37
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,916
HEY, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
I BET IT'S WENDY, RIGHT?

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,083
- RIGHT.

39
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,916
- OH, WOW.
YOU'RE SUCH A CUTE LITTLE GIRL.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,041
AND YOU'RE EARTH LAND'S VERSION
OF ME?

41
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,083
- ARE YOU JUST NOW
FIGURING THAT ONE OUT?

42
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:34,458
- WELL, MY NAME IS HAPPY.
AND THIS BEAUTY IS CARLA.

43
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:37,500
- AND I'M LUCY. BUT YOU
ALREADY KNOW MY NAME, DON'T YOU?

44
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,791
- ( exclaims ) I'M SORRY.
I'LL DO WHATEVER I CAN

45
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,333
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU!

46
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:46,583
- GEEZ, LUCY, GIVE "SCARED ME"
A BREAK, WOULD YOU?

47
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:49,416
- THE LUCY THAT
I KNOW FROM HERE

48
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,916
TOLD ME I NEEDED TO BRING YOU
THIS FAR. SO, I DID.

49
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,708
- IS THAT THE PLACE?
- I THINK IT'S THE ROYAL CITY.

50
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,958
- IT'S SO BIG!
- ( laughs )

51
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,916
YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD US
WE WERE HERE SOONER!

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,416
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M SO SORRY!

53
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,375
- THIS IS AWESOME.

54
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:18,166
WE'LL BE BUSTIN' OUT
OUR FRIENDS IN NO TIME!

55
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,375
- THEY'RE ALL DOWN THERE,

56
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,833
TRAPPED INSIDE OF
SOME GIANT LACRIMA.

57
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,416
- WE MUSTN'T WASTE TIME.

58
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,375
- HOLD ON A SECOND!

59
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,000
- THANKS A MILLION, BUDDY!

60
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,958
- Lucy: SAY HI TO ME FOR ME!

61
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,833
- HEY, WAIT!
YOU'RE REALLY DOING IT?

62
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,083
FIGHTING THE KINGDOM?

63
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:39,208
- I DON'T KNOW. WE'RE JUST GONNA
TRY TO GET OUR FRIENDS BACK.

64
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:42,541
BUT IF THE KINGDOM DECIDES
IT WANTS TO GET IN OUR WAY,

65
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,708
I GUESS WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO FIGHT 'EM.

66
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,625
- ( gasps )

67
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,208
- ( wind whooshing )

68
00:04:55,791 --> 00:05:00,000
- WELL, I HATE TO BE SAYIN'
THIS, BUT YOU CAN'T BEAT THEM.

69
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,000
- ( laughs )

70
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,791
- ( festive music playing )

71
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,083
- ( people chattering )

72
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,791
- ( men laughing )

73
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,958
- ( children laughing )

74
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:24,125
- THEY'RE SO HAPPY.
- IT'S NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.

75
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:27,125
I THOUGHT THIS PLACE
WOULD BE DARK AND SCARY.

76
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:30,375
- NOT EXACTLY MY IDEA OF A
DICTATORSHIP, THAT'S FOR SURE.

77
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,375
- AND WE GOT INTO THE CITY
WITHOUT HAVING TO FIGHT

78
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,166
A SINGLE GUARD.

79
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,083
- COMPARED TO ALL THE OTHER
TOWNS WE'VE BEEN TO,

80
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,333
IT'S LIKE A FAIR.

81
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,625
- I'M SURE IT'S BECAUSE THEY
STEAL MAGIC FROM EVERYWHERE

82
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:41,708
AND HOARD IT ALL HERE.

83
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,416
THEN THEY TRY TO
GLOSS OVER THEIR CRIMES

84
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,583
TO MAKE IT MORE PALATABLE
TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC.

85
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:49,875
- WELL, IT'S NOT WORKING FOR ME.

86
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,666
- HEY, GUYS, IT LOOKS LIKE
THERE'S SOMETHING

87
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,875
GOING ON OVER HERE!

88
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,875
- ARE THEY HAVING
A PARADE OR SOMETHING?

89
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,916
- Natsu: OOH! LIKE THEIR VERSION
OF FANTASIA?

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,458
- Happy: AYE, SIR!

91
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:02,416
- Carla: WE'RE HERE
FOR BUSINESS,

92
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,666
NOT PLEASURE, REMEMBER?

93
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,625
- Natsu: WHAT'S THE DEAL?
WHY'S EVERYONE CHEERING?

94
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,000
- Lucy: HOLD ON, NATSU!

95
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,500
- Happy: WHOA!
IT'S SUPER CROWDED OVER HERE!

96
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,541
- GEEZ.

97
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,291
HEY! IF YOU'RE GONNA STOP
IN FRONT OF ME LIKE THAT,

98
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,708
WARN ME!

99
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:19,958
( gasps )

100
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,958
- NO. THAT'S A LACRIMA.

101
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,916
- A GIANT ONE. WHICH MEANS...

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,625
- ALL OF OUR FRIENDS
ARE INSIDE OF THERE.

103
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,458
- AND IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY,

104
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,750
YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S
A MISSING PIECE.

105
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,458
- WHAT? YOU MEAN THERE'S MORE
OF THAT THING SOMEWHERE?

106
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,125
- ( crowd cheering )

107
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,833
( loud cheering )

108
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,208
- ( sobbing )

109
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:35,333
- CHILDREN OF EDOLAS,
IT BRINGS GREAT JOY TO MY HEART

110
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,666
TO TELL YOU
THAT OUR ANIMA PROGRAM

111
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,791
HAS PRODUCED ENOUGH MAGIC POWER
TO LAST ANOTHER DECADE!

112
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,625
- YOU DIDN'T PRODUCE
A DARN THING.

113
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,583
ALL YOU DID WAS BREAK INTO OUR
WORLD AND STEAL IT FROM US!

114
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,500
- PLEASE CONTROL
YOUR TEMPER, TOMCAT.

115
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:53,000
- LET US REJOICE TOGETHER!
LET US SING AND DANCE!

116
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:56,333
LET LAUGHTER ROAR
THROUGH OUR SACRED KINGDOM!

117
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:57,875
- ( cheering )

118
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:09,875
- THE POWER WITHIN THIS LACRIMA
BELONGS TO ALL LOYAL SUBJECTS

119
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,250
OF OUR FAIR HOMELAND!

120
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,250
TODAY WE HOLD OUR FUTURE
IN OUR HANDS

121
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:17,000
TO ENSURE ITS PROSPERITY
INTO TOMORROW AND BEYOND!

122
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,708
THEREFORE WE MUST SWEAR
TO PROTECT THIS GIFT FROM HEAVEN

123
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,458
WITH OUR VERY LIVES!

124
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,458
MY DEAR CHILDREN,

125
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,250
TODAY I SHALL MAKE
A MOST SOLEMN PLEDGE TO YOU

126
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,625
AS YOUR BENEVOLENT RULER.

127
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,583
I WILL BRING YOU MORE POWER.

128
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,750
SO MUCH MORE THAN
YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE.

129
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,416
- ( cracking )

130
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:55,708
- ( crowd chanting )
EDOLAS! EDOLAS!

131
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:59,291
EDOLAS! EDOLAS!

132
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,833
- MAN, WHAT A JOKE.

133
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,833
THE PEOPLE HERE
ARE A BUNCH OF SUCKERS.

134
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,583
THEY WENT FOR HIS WHOLE ACT,
HOOK, LINE, AND SINKER.

135
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,916
NOW WHAT AM I GONNA DO
ABOUT THIS?

136
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,166
- ( Natsu grunting )

137
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,041
- STAY STRONG!

138
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:28,375
- IT'S THEM, OUR FRIENDS.
WE GOTTA GET THEM OUT OF THERE!

139
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,500
- ( sobs )

140
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:34,875
WE WILL! JUST WAIT.
WE'LL GET THEM ALL BACK.

141
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,916
NATSU, PLEASE.

142
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,333
- ( laughing )

143
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,958
- I CAN'T JUST SIT AROUND
LIKE THIS FOREVER.

144
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,958
I'M STORMIN' THE CASTLE!

145
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:26,458
- Carla: THAT WON'T DO ANY GOOD!
- OH, YEAH, WHY NOT?

146
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,375
- WITHOUT A SOLID
STRATEGY IN PLACE,

147
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,250
YOU DON'T HAVE A PRAYER
OF SAVING ANYONE.

148
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,666
- ( guttural groan )

149
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,250
- BUT STILL, THEY WERE
TURNED INTO THAT CRYSTAL.

150
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,750
AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO CHANGE THEM BACK.

151
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:44,416
- HMM. THE KING WILL JUST
HAVE TO TELL US THAT HIMSELF.

152
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,000
- BUT HE'D NEVER DO THAT!

153
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,916
- HE WILL
IF WE BEAT IT OUT OF HIM!

154
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,083
- HEY, YEAH!

155
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,125
DO YOU THINK THAT THE KING
ACTUALLY DOES KNOW

156
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:55,083
HOW TO REVERSE THE SPELL?
- PROBABLY.

157
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,708
- THEN WE STILL HAVE A CHANCE!

158
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,458
IF WE GET CLOSE TO THE KING,
WE CAN PULL THIS OFF.

159
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:02,458
- FOR REAL?
- BUT HOW DO WE SAVE THEM?

160
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,541
- WITH GEMINI!

161
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,041
REMEMBER, NOT ONLY DO THEY
HAVE THE POWER

162
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,666
TO TURN INTO THE
PEOPLE THEY TOUCH,

163
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,750
THEY CAN ALSO READ THE MINDS OF
WHOEVER THEY TURN INTO.

164
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,958
WHICH MEANS IF THEY'RE ABLE
TO TRANSFORM INTO THE KING,

165
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,333
THEN THEY'LL ALSO BE ABLE
TO TELL US EVERYTHING HE KNOWS.

166
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,750
- OH!

167
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,750
- TIMING IS GONNA BE
A MAJOR ISSUE WITH USING THEM,

168
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,416
BECAUSE THEY CAN ONLY
TRANSFORM INTO SOMEONE

169
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,250
FOR NO MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES

170
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,750
AND THEY CAN ONLY REMEMBER
A COUPLE OF PEOPLE AT A TIME,

171
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:28,875
LITERALLY, JUST TWO,
SO THERE'S THAT.

172
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,125
BUT THE REAL QUESTION IS,

173
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,000
HOW ARE WE GONNA
GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO HIM?

174
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,583
THAT'S TOUGH.

175
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:37,541
- YEAH, NO JOKE. HE ALWAYS HAS
A LOT OF GUARDS SURROUNDING HIM.

176
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,083
- I'VE COME UP WITH A PLAN
FOR GETTING WITHIN RANGE.

177
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,666
- ( all gasp )

178
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,541
- AS WITH ANY HOME
OF A PARANOID RULER,

179
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,291
WHEN THE CASTLE
WAS CONSTRUCTED,

180
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,125
THERE WAS A TUNNEL BUILT
AS AN ESCAPE ROUTE,

181
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,083
WHICH LINKS UP WITH A MINE SHAFT
JUST OUTSIDE OF THE CITY WALL.

182
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,666
- THERE IS?
BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?

183
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,708
- IT'S JUST IN MY HEAD, COMING
TO ME IN LITTLE BITS AND PIECES.

184
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,750
FROM THE MOMENT
WE FIRST SET FOOT IN EDOLAS,

185
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,208
IT'S AS THOUGH
I HAVE A MENTAL MAP

186
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,416
THAT'S SLOWLY BEING FILLED IN.

187
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,750
- WELL, MY HEAD IS STILL EMPTY.

188
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,208
- IF WE CAN FIND THAT TUNNEL,
THEN WE MAY HAVE A REAL SHOT

189
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,791
AT GETTING CLOSE ENOUGH
TO THE KING.

190
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,750
- ALL RIGHT! LET'S GET INSIDE
THAT GEEZER'S HEAD!

191
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,583
- LET'S GO!
- AYE-AYE, SIR!

192
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,666
- NOT YET!
- WHY YOU ALWAYS STOPPIN' ME?

193
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,666
- WE'LL GO
UNDER THE COVER OF NIGHT.

194
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,041
UNTIL THEN, WE SHOULD TRY
TO GET SOME REST.

195
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,041
WE SHOULD BE ARRIVING AT
THE ENTRANCE

196
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,791
TO THE TUNNEL ANY MOMENT NOW!

197
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,833
- IS THIS IT?
- YES. I'M POSITIVE.

198
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,250
- IN WE GO.
- WAIT.

199
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,791
- AGAIN WITH THE STOPPIN'?

200
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,875
- I UNDERSTAND THAT TIME
IS OF THE ESSENCE, TRUST ME.

201
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,333
BUT WE WILL NEED
A SOURCE OF LIGHT IN THE TUNNEL.

202
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:27,833
- I GOT THIS!

203
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,166
ONE TORCH! COMIN' UP!

204
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,083
HUH?

205
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,833
- YOU SEEM TO HAVE
FORGOTTEN AGAIN.

206
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,583
YOUR MAGIC POWER SIMPLY
DOESN'T WORK HERE IN EDOLAS.

207
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,458
- ( groans )

208
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,791
AW, MAN!

209
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,000
- I CAN'T EXACTLY SAY THAT
LUCY BEING THE ONLY ONE OF US

210
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,291
THAT CAN STILL USE MAGIC
IS A VERY COMFORTING THOUGHT.

211
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,708
- GIVE IT A REST, HAPPY,
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS.

212
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,625
- I'M SORRY,
DID I SAY THAT OUT LOUD?

213
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,916
- WHAT ARE YOU
HOLDING THERE, LUCY?

214
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,416
- ( laughing )

215
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,916
I GOT US TORCHES!

216
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,625
I TOOK SOME WOOD
FROM OVER THERE,

217
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,666
WRAPPED 'EM WITH CLOTH
and DIPPED 'EM IN OIL.

218
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,541
ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS LIGHT THESE BABIES UP

219
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,083
AND WE'LL HAVE
NO PROBLEMS SEEING.

220
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,750
- AND HOW WILL WE DO THAT?
- GOOD QUESTION.

221
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,750
- THIS HAS GOTTA BE
THE MOST HUMILIATING THING

222
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,291
I'VE EVER DONE IN MY LIFE.

223
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,541
- WE'VE GOT NO OTHER CHOICE.

224
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,708
BUT IT REALLY DOES ILLUSTRATE
HOW CONVENIENT MAGIC CAN BE

225
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,291
FOR EVEN THE LITTLE THINGS.

226
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,541
- OLD-TIMEY PEOPLE MUST
HAVE BEEN SUPER IMPRESSIVE

227
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,083
IF THEY COULD MAKE FIRES JUST
BY RUBBING

228
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,958
A COUPLE OF STICKS
TOGETHER LIKE THAT.

229
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:37,291
- ( groaning with frustration )
MAN! I SUCK AT MAKING FIRE!

230
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,500
- ( sizzling )
- WHOA! I DID IT!

231
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,250
- YAY! LUCY MADE FIRE!
- GOOD JOB!

232
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,208
- AWESOME! I KNEW
YOU HAD IT IN YOU!

233
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,916
- I FIND IT IRONIC THAT
THE FIRE WIZARD

234
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,458
COULDN'T EVEN MAKE A SPARK.

235
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,750
- WE GOT FIRE NOW,
SO JUST DROP IT, WOULD YOU?

236
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,000
- I'M ALL FIRED UP!

237
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,250
- THIS'LL BE PERFECT!
- GO, LUCY!

238
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,291
- ( sighs )

239
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,916
NOW THAT THAT'S OVER,
CAN I REST FOR A LITTLE WHILE?

240
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:06,791
- HMM.

241
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,666
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?

242
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,250
( gasps )

243
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:15,083
YEAH, MAYBE EATING FIRE
WILL BRING YOUR MAGIC BACK.

244
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,708
- THAT'S RIGHT. SO DID IT WORK?

245
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,000
- FEEL IT YET?
- HMM.

246
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:23,833
( swallows )

247
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,791
DEFINITELY FEELING HOT
RIGHT HERE.

248
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,625
- WELL, DOES IT FEEL LIKE MAGIC?

249
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,541
- UH, I DON'T KNOW.

250
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,416
BUT I'M STARTIN' TO THINK
IT DOES!

251
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,291
- YOU GOT A FIRE IN YOUR BELLY.
GO AHEAD AND LET IT OUT

252
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,250
BY GIVING US THE OLD FIRE DRAGON
IRON FIST MOVE!

253
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:40,750
- YOU BET! COMIN' RIGHT UP!

254
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:47,833
SORRY, I GOT NOTHIN'.

255
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,458
- I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU
THAT WOULD HAPPEN.

256
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,125
- I THOUGHT
MAYBE ALL I HAD TO DO

257
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,583
WAS EAT THIS WEIRD WORLD'S FIRE!
- Lucy: DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,

258
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,583
THANKS TO MY TORCHES,
WE'RE ALL SET.

259
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:00,708
- Happy: BUT THEY'RE NOT MAGIC.

260
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,875
- LOOKS LIKE NOBODY'S BEEN HERE
IN A WHILE.

261
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,875
- PUT THE LIGHT RIGHT OUT
IN FRONT OF US.

262
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,541
THAT'S OUR LINK.

263
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,583
- IT SEEMS PRETTY THICK,

264
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,833
AND I THINK IT'S BEEN FORTIFIED
BY SOME SORT OF MAGIC.

265
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,291
- DOES THAT MEAN
THIS IS A DEAD END?

266
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,083
- WE'LL HAVE TO FIND A WAY
TO GET THROUGH IT.

267
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,916
I'M SURE THE PASSAGE LEADING TO
THE CASTLE IS ON THE OTHER SIDE.

268
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,666
- GUESS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
BREAK IT DOWN.

269
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,166
- THAT'LL BE NO PROBLEM.

270
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,625
'CAUSE I KNOW SOMEBODY THAT
CAN BUST RIGHT THROUGH IT.

271
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,500
OPEN, GATE OF THE GOLDEN BULL!

272
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,000
- ( bell tolls )
- TAURUS!

273
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,541
- ( grunting )

274
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,375
( growling )

275
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,541
- BRING ON THE MUSCLE COW.

276
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,208
- IF YOU'RE LOOKIN'
FOR BRUTE STRENGTH,

277
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,916
TAURUS IS DEFINITELY THE
CELESTIAL SPIRIT

278
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,250
YOU WANNA CALL ON.

279
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,458
NOW PLOW THROUGH THAT WALL
FOR US, WILL YOU?

280
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,000
- OF COURSE, MISS LUCY,

281
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,000
'CAUSE YOU KNOW
I'M ALWAYS IN THE PLOWIN' MOOD.

282
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,833
- KNOCK THAT THING
OUT OF OUR WAY!

283
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,208
- I'LL MAKE IT VAMOOSE!

284
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:27,500
MOO! MOO!

285
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,750
MOO!

286
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,416
- MAJOR HOOVES OF FURY!

287
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,250
- YEAH, YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN!

288
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,250
HEY, LOOK!
- THERE'S A PASSAGEWAY!

289
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,541
- LIKE I ALWAYS SAY,
CARLA'S GOT THE ONE-TWO PUNCH

290
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,416
OF BRAINS AND BEAUTY!

291
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,458
- THAT WALL WASN'T SO HARD
TO MOVE, MISS LUCY.

292
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,250
- THANKS FOR
ALL YOUR HELP, TAURUS!

293
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,750
- DON'T YOU THINK
I DESERVE TO GET A SMOOCH?

294
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:56,583
- UH, GET OVER IT ALREADY.
- AW, COME ON, MISS LUCY.

295
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,875
A KISS FROM YOU
WOULD SEND ME TO THE MOOD.

296
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,916
- HOW ABOUT I JUST SEND YOU
HOME INSTEAD?

297
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,875
- WHETHER OR NOT THIS PASSAGE
LEADS TO THE CASTLE

298
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,541
REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

299
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,666
- YOU'VE BEEN RIGHT
ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE SO FAR.

300
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,750
I'M SURE
THIS IS WHERE WE WANNA GO.

301
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,416
- ( Happy groans softly )

302
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,666
- WHAT'S WRONG, BUDDY?

303
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,791
- HEY, WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT I'M NOT GETTING

304
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,750
ANY KINDA MAP
INSIDE OF MY HEAD?

305
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,625
I MEAN, I'M FROM EDOLAS
JUST LIKE SHE IS.

306
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,166
AND SUPPOSEDLY WE BOTH GOT
SENT AWAY ON THE SAME MISSION.

307
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,333
SO HOW COME
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING?

308
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,833
- WE AGREED NOT TO TALK
ABOUT THAT, REMEMBER?

309
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,083
- AYE.

310
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,666
- I CAN'T GIVE YOU
AN EXPLANATION,

311
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,791
THAT'S JUST HOW IT SEEMS
TO BE WORKING OUT.

312
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,541
- FOR NOW,
WE GOTTA KEEP MOVING FORWARD.

313
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:45,958
- RIGHT.
- YEAH.

314
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,333
I HOPE THIS THING
DOESN'T CAVE IN ON US.

315
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,708
- SHUT UP, NATSU,
OR YOU'RE GONNA JINX US.

316
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,375
- THIS MINESHAFT IS PRETTY OLD
AND RUNDOWN, ISN'T IT?

317
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,583
- I REALLY HOPE
IT'S NOT HAUNTED.

318
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,875
- ( gasps )
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

319
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,250
PLEASE DON'T LET THERE BE
SOMETHING SCARY DOWN THERE!

320
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,041
- JUST HOLD THIS THING
FOR ME, OKAY?

321
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,666
- WHY? JUST TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON!

322
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,000
DO YOU HAVE TO
FIGHT SOMETHING?

323
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,916
- BE QUIET
AND DON'T MOVE A MUSCLE.

324
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,166
( malicious laughter )

325
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,125
WE'VE FOUND THE LAIR
OF THE SHADOW MONSTER!

326
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,666
( laughs )

327
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,708
- ( all exclaiming )

328
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:26,958
- THIS IS NOT THE TIME
FOR GOOFING AROUND!

329
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,500
- Carla: LET'S SEE.

330
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:33,250
NOW IN ABOUT FIFTY PACES
WE'LL TAKE A LEFT.

331
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,291
WE SHOULD TURN HERE.

332
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,000
- THIS IS MORE LIKE A CAVERN
THAN A TUNNEL.

333
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,750
- YES, AND I
BELIEVE THIS CAVERN

334
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,791
IS LOCATED DIRECTLY
UNDERNEATH THE CASTLE.

335
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,833
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU'RE DOING ALL THIS,

336
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,625
BUT I'M SO GLAD
THAT YOU'RE ON OUR TEAM.

337
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,541
- I'M PERPLEXED AS WELL,
BUT LIKE I SAID,

338
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:59,000
THE MAP JUST KEEPS GETTING
MORE AND MORE FILLED IN.

339
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,458
- YOU'RE AMAZING, CARLA.

340
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,250
- WELL, BEING ABLE TO FIND
OUR WAY THROUGH HERE

341
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:06,125
IS SURE TO BE THE EASY PART.
BUT WHAT WILL BE TRULY AMAZING

342
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,166
WILL BE SNEAKING IN AND OUT
OF

343
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,250
THE KING'S ROYAL
CHAMBERS UNDETECTED.

344
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,083
AS DEFENSELESS AS WE ARE NOW,

345
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,208
THIS MISSION'LL BE OVER
THE MOMENT WE'RE SPOTTED.

346
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,625
- NOW, DON'T FORGET,

347
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,583
WE CAN ALWAYS USE MY MAGIC
IF WE GET INTO A PINCH!

348
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,833
- SO YOU'RE GONNA SAVE US?
I DON'T THINK SO.

349
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,083
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
TAURUS GOT US THIS FAR,

350
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,416
AND THE WHOLE PLAN
RELIES ON USING GEMINI!

351
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,500
- YEAH, YEAH.
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY, HAPPY?

352
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:28,625
- AYE!

353
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:33,958
- ( yells )
- LUCY!

354
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,333
- WHAT IS THAT?

355
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,166
- OH, NO, I'M STUCK.

356
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,166
- ( screams )

357
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,750
- ( grunts )

358
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:47,166
- CAN'T REACH MY KEYS.

359
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,416
- ( gasps ) ROYAL TROOPS!

360
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,916
- WHY ARE THERE
SO MANY OF THEM DOWN HERE?

361
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,833
- HOW IN THE HECK
DID THEY FIND US?

362
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,458
- SO THESE ARE THE MAGIC USERS
FROM EARTH LAND?

363
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,666
- ( gasping )

364
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,250
- Lucy: ERZA!

365
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,791
- IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH
YOU RESEMBLE THE OUTLAWS,

366
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,291
NATSU DRAGYON AND LUCY ASHLEY.

367
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,666
TAKE THEM AWAY.
- Soldiers: YES, MA'AM!

368
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,291
- ( screaming )

369
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:35,833
- ERZA!

370
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,083
PLEASE LISTEN TO US! WAIT!

371
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,333
- Carla: WENDY!
- Happy: NATSU! LUCY!

372
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,541
- GREAT EXCEEDS.

373
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,541
- Both: HUH?

374
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,708
- I'M HONORED
TO WELCOME YOU HOME.

375
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,416
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

376
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,583
- WHO ARE YOU, HAPPY AND CARLA?

377
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,041
I THOUGHT THAT
YOU WERE OUR FRIENDS.

378
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:19,083
- WE'RE MOST GRATEFUL FOR YOUR
HELP IN CAPTURING THE INTRUDERS.

379
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:21,708
- ( sobbing )

380
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,958
- ( theme song playing )

381
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

382
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,333
- Happy: CHECK IT OUT, NATSU!

383
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:17,291
THERE'S AN ENTIRE LAND
THAT'S MADE UP OF CATS!

384
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:18,791
- Natsu: WHOA! THAT'S CRAZY!

385
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,750
DO YOU THINK THAT MEANS
THERE ARE PLACES OUT THERE

386
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,166
FULL OF OTHER ANIMALS LIKE THIS?

387
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,291
- OOH! IF THERE IS, I'M GONNA
GO TO THE LAND OF FISH!

388
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:27,000
THAT'S A KITTY PARADISE!

389
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:28,291
- I THINK YOU'D
BE IN BIG TROUBLE

390
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:29,250
IF YOU WENT TO THEIR LAND

391
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:30,333
AND STARTED EATING
ALL OF 'EM.

392
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:34,083
- Both: NEXT TIME, EXTALIA.

393
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:36,458
- Natsu: I GUESS IF I COULD,
I'D VISIT THE LAND OF DRAGONS!

394
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,666
- WHY? YOU DON'T THINK DRAGONS
WOULD BE SUPER TASTY

395
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,833
OR SOMETHIN', DO YOU?

396
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:41,375
- EW! NO WAY!
