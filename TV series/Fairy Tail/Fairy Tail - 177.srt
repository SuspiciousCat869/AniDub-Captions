[NATSU]
Previously, on Fairy Tail!

2
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,208
[NARRATOR] The Grand
Magic Games continue...!

3
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,208
And although they got
off to a rocky start,

4
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:29,125
the wizards of Fairy Tail
have turned it around.

5
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:32,208
They've taken the lead after
winning day four's team battle

6
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,791
against the Twin
Dragons of Sabertooth.

7
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,958
This loss greatly displeased
Master Jiemma,

8
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,833
and a dramatic clash ensued.

9
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,208
Meanwhile, in a dragon bone yard

10
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,625
far beneath the
Domus Flau coliseum,

11
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:48,833
the spirit of the
Jade Dragon, Zirconis,

12
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,458
told Natsu and
the others the truth

13
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:56,333
behind the Dragon King Festival
and Aknologia himself.

14
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,458
[ARCADIOS]
I am Colonel Arcadios,

15
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,708
leader of the
Sacred Cherry Blossom Knights...

16
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:53,250
The Crocus garrison force
of the Royal Fiore Army.

17
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,750
And I am Yukino Aguria,

18
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,208
acting-Sergeant in the
Cherry Blossom Knights.

19
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:00,666
So what business does the
military have down here anyway?

20
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,041
I don't get it...

21
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,083
You're in the army?

22
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,708
But you were with
the Sabertooth guild

23
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,166
just a couple
of days ago.

24
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,333
Did you join the army after
those guys kicked you out?

25
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,500
Yes, in a manner
of speaking.

26
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,750
Please allow
me to clarify...

27
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,291
For the past
several years

28
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,333
I have been working on a
highly classified project...

29
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,416
But its success
required the power

30
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,125
only a celestial
wizard can provide.

31
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,750
Luckily, Sargent Yukino
is able to lend her assistance

32
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,833
in this undertaking.

33

[LUCY]

[WENDY]
Excuse me...

36
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,583
So you specifically needed
that type of magic power...?

37
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:45,666
To do what, though?

38
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,041
Get to the point,
would ya...?!

39
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,291
I'm runnin'
really low on patience!

40
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,625
So skip the formal crap and tell
us what you're doing down here!

41
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,083
The one and only
Natsu Dragneel...

42
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,083
It's an honor to make
your acquaintance...

43
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,416
I applaud your recent
victory in battle.

[NATSU stomps]

46
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,458
I said skip
the formal crap

47
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:03,708
and tell me
what you're doing...!

48
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,208
While you're at it,
tell me why the hell

49
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:08,125
you were trying to get your
hands on a celestial wizard!

50
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,875
And when I ask
somebody a question...

51
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,791
I expect an answer right away!

52
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:13,875
Calm down.

53
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,125
Idiot.

54
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,666
[HAPPY] This should probably
go without saying...

55
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,666
But he's kind of
an important dude.

56
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,291
[PANTHERLILY] I don't really
think that calling him "dude"

57
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,750
is a very good idea either.

[YUKINO]
You too, Lucy.

63
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,333
You should come along with us.

If our plan is
indeed successful...

defeated as a result.

[WENDY] Do you really
think you can do that?

Holy cow!

[ARCADIOS]
This is his majesty's home.

73
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,958
It certainly is
fit for a king.

74
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,666
Are you really sure it's
okay for us to go inside?

75
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,416
[ARCADIOS]
Yes, but before we do...

76
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,208
I'd like to give Miss Lucy
my most humble apology;

77
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,291
my misguided actions put her
directly in harm's way.

78

[NATSU]
What do you mean by that?

that accidentally kidnapped
Wendy and I?!

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,625
You were the one that
was behind all of that?

83
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,166
My intention was never to
put you in any real danger...

84
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,500
But I was far too aggressive
with my orders.

85
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,875
I falsely believed that
you were our only hope

86
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,416
for the celestial wizard
we so desperately needed.

87
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,500
It was a lapse of judgment...

88
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,166
I ask your forgiveness.

[BOTH grunt]

[ARCADIOS] In truth,
the Grand Magic Games is a ruse.

91
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,750
Or rather a mechanism

92
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:58,625
for siphoning magic power
from the participants.

93
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,166

So you've been stealing power

That's messed-up.

[PANTHERLILY]
You can say that again.

entitled to your opinions

100

on the matter,

Without massive amounts
of magic power,

it never could've
been constructed.

[ARCADIOS] When the sun
and moon intersect...

112
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,875
We will then use the
Celestial Zodiac keys

113

to open this door.

[ARCADIOS gasping]

163
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,541
What is this meaning of this?!

It's you who should be
answering that question.

You are aware that revealing

167

outsiders is treason!

not outsiders...!

to the Eclipse Project!

have the authority

173

[ARCADIOS] I won't allow
your opposition

will alter history!

But if they go back
and change the past...

...the present and future
will change as well.

for treason against
the kingdom of Fiore!

into custody as well,

to this crime...!

I'm warning you!

If you want her,
you gotta go through me!

200
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:30,291
No, stop!

You can't use magic here!

[DARTON] Oh, did the Colonel
not inform you...?

210
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:50,958
The Games are just a way

211
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,708
of stealing magic power
to feed the Eclipse.

212
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:57,083
It is an extremely
effective tool... In fact,

213
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,916
if a wizard were to
activate a spell

214
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,541
this close to the device...

215
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:04,208
The Eclipse would completely
drain all of their magic power.

[NATSU collaspses]

I hope you won't cause
any more trouble...

218
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,833
After all, a wizard
incapable of using magic

219
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:15,208
is hardly a threat to a group
of royal soldiers.

Get your dirty
hands off me!

[YUKINO] If you're soldiers...

a while to recover.

Please, you must understand

that my intention was
never to harm anyone...

233

but there is simply
too much at stake.

234

However, I can offer you
somewhat of an olive branch

235
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,041
for your trouble.
I'll have you know

To think that she
would be involved

00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,416
in some sort of top-secret
plot is utterly ridiculous.

[LAXUS]
Let me get this straight...

We take the top spot
we can ask for her back.

But that's only if

and get her right now!

00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,416
We can't afford to
take reckless action

267
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,875
against the kingdom...

268
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,000
And they surely wouldn't
want word to spread

269
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,416
that they mistreat
innocent civilians.

270

consider her a hostage

There's one thing
I don't really understand...

276
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,791
If all of us know about this big
secret they're trying to hide,

why'd they let us
walk away free?

You expect them to make
any kind of sense?!

It was obvious that
Colonel Arcadios

was the primary target they were
after, so maybe they let us go

against him later.

00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,416
it can't be kept
secret much longer.

It's still weird they
didn't keep us there...

found out about it.

00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:21,541
[YUKINO] I never wanted
you to get dragged into this.

320
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,166
I'm so sorry...

321
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,083
but I've always
been a bad luck charm.

322
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,666
Don't beat
yourself up!

323
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,166
Instead of feeling
sorry for ourselves,

324
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,791
let's figure out
how to get outta here!

325
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,125
[YUKINO]
You're right, but...

326
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,208
And the first order of business
when we blow this joint

327
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,000
is getting
our keys back.

328
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,625
[YUKINO] I'm sorry
I let this happen...

329
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:41,125
Seriously, it's totally
not your fault.

330
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,791
[YUKINO sighs]

331
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,875
[LUCY] It seems to me like
we got caught up in the middle

332
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:49,250
of some kind of power
struggle in the government.

333
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,958
Aren't they just fighting
over whether or not

334
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:54,375
that Eclipse Project or
whatever should be happening?

335
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,708
To be perfectly
honest...

336
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:59,750
I don't know enough to
have a real opinion on it.

337
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,208
It should...

338
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,500
They should go
forward with it.

339
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,291
[LUCY] Ah...

340
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,250
[YUKINO] A long time ago,
I had a big sister...

341
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,125
Her name
was Sorano.

342
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,208
I was always
messing things up

343
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,875
and getting
into trouble...

344
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,791
 My parents were constantly
getting angry with me.

345
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,458
But time after time,
my sister stood up for me.

346
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:25,166
[SORANO] Leave Yukino alone;
it's not her fault!

347
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,000
She was so sweet...

348
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,458
and beautiful...

349
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:31,583
I was so lucky to
have a sister like her.

350
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:32,833
[LUCY sighs]

351
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,666
[YUKINO]
But then one night,

352
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,833
my village was invaded by a cult
that worshipped Zeref...

353
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:46,500
They killed our parents,
and took my sister away.

354
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:50,166
I wanted to help, but all
I could do was run for my life.

355
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:57,958
The Eclipse is the only hope
we have of defeating Zeref.

356
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,791
I just wanted to
have my family back...

357
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,166
That's all.

358
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,625
[YUKINO cries]

359
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:08,041
[LUCY]
So, if he was gone...

360
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:11,375
...they might never
have been taken away.

361
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,708
But there's
no guarantee

362
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,166
that the world would change
the way we want it to...

363
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,500
We don't have
that kind of control.

364
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,458
That's why it's such
a risky thing...

365
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:23,083
and why some people
are trying to stop it.

366
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,041
And nobody knows
if it's even possible.

367
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:29,083
Can you really go back
and change the past?

368
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:33,541
[birds chirping]

[NARRATOR]
July Sixth...

371
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,458
The final day of
the Grand Magic Games!

372
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,500
A day filled with jubilation!

373
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:51,833
[CHAPATI] This is what we have
all been waiting for, folks!

374
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,625
It has been an exciting week;

375
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,333
filled with incredible magic
and emotional moments

376
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,291
we may never forget!
But today,

377
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,916
one guild will be crowned
number one in Fiore

378
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,541
and the winner of
the Grand Magic Games!

379
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:04,750
[CROWD cheers]

380
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,333
Ladies and Gentlemen,
it has been an honor

381
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,875
to have spent this
time with you,

382
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,208
and with my fellow commentator,
the esteemed Mister Yajima!

383
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,000
My pleasure.

384
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,333
[CHAPATI] We have a very special
guest with us today...!

385
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,416
You all know and love
him as the official mascot

386
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,708
of the Grand Magic Games,
the always entertaining, Mato!

387
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,583
[MATO]
Heya!

388
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,833
[CHAPATI] Usually you're in
the arena acting as referee,

389
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:24,875
but not today!

390
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,291
[MATO] No sir!

391
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,625
That won't be necessary, because
today is extra special!

392
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,666
The final match!

393
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,708
[CROWD cheers]

394
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,458
[MATO] Now let's
get things started

395
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,125
and bring out
all the competitors!

396
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,500
[CHAPATI] Currently in sixth
place and hoping for an upset

397
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,833
are the hunting dogs
turned tail-chasers:

398
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,458
Quatro Puppy!

399
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,958
[CROWD cheering]

400
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,500
[YAJIMA] It's true the
"Drunken Hawk" Bacchus

401
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,375
has been on the losing side
this year,

402
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:57,333
but he's still a force
to be reckoned with.

403
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,833
Next up...

404
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,833
the guild that exudes class
and an intoxicating parfum.

405
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:06,458
With Ichiya Vandalay Kotobuki
at the helm, it's Blue Pegasus!

406
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,458
[CROWD cheering]

407
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,333
[MATO] They're currently
down in fifth place...

408
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,916
But today is their
chance to breathe in

409
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,916
the sweet smell of victory!

410
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,875
Good luck!

411
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,750
[CROWD gasping]

412
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,875
[CHAPATI] Here comes our
third place team: Lamia Scale!

413
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:26,333
Can Lyon Bastia, the ice wizard
who rivals Fairy Tail's

414
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,166
Gray Fullbuster, bring the heat
in today's battle?

415
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:34,500
Or will his team just get
frozen in their tracks?

416
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,041
[MATO] He doesn't
have to do it alone...

417
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,750
Don't forget the cute little
God Slayer, Shelia Blendi,

418
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:42,791
and the Wizard Saint Jura Neekis
are extremely powerful as well!

419
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:46,000
I agree; that team could
claim the title today!

420
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,750
[CHAPATI] Lamia Scale isn't
the only team in third place;

421
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,375
they are in very good company!

422
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,041
With Mermaid Heel!

423
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,083
[YAJIMA]
Beautiful ladies,

424
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,666
but don't fooled
by their sweet looks.

425
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,375
They are definitely not
delicate little flowers.

426
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,500
[MATO] Beneath the calm
exterior of their leader,

427
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:08,208
Kagura Meekazuchi,
burns a fire of intensity!

[CROWD cheering]

429
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,666
[CHAPATI] Let's hear it
for our second place team!

430
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,333
[CROWD cheering]

431
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,958
[CHAPATI] What a shocker
to see this guild,

432
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,708
who's usually in the top spot,
playing catch-up!

433
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,375
Is this the end of an era?

434
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,291
[CHAPATI] Their Twin Dragons,
Sting and Rogue,

435
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,333
have a major bone to pick with
Natsu and Gajeel of Fairy Tail

436
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,833
after that crushing
defeat on day four...!

437
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,333
Can they settle the score?!

438
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:34,500
Let's give it up for returning
Grand Magic Games champions!

439
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:35,500
The mighty...

440
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,041
...Sabertooth!

[CROWD cheering]

442
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,958
[CHAPATI] Those are some
serious looks they've got today.

443
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,166
Surely they realize
there's a lot on the line.

444
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,625
[MATO]
Keeping cool under pressure!

445
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:56,916
Whoa, that's weird.

446
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,166
They usually have
two cats rootin' for 'em.

447
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,750
[MAN C]
Yeah, but one of 'em's gone.

448
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,625
[MAN A]
Wonder why?

Hey, Sting!

451
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,875
You've totally got this thing
in the bag, ol' buddy...!

452
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,083
They're only one point ahead,

453
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,125
that's nothin'
for a guy like you!

454
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,250
You're right about that, pal...

455
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,708
And I won't let you down.

456
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,875
'Cause...
I'm not losing.

457
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,166
[CHAPATI] And now,
in first place...

458
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,166
the guild that is making
a historical comeback

459
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,125
after literally falling off
the map seven years ago!

[ROGUE]
Well, this is it...

464
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,333
You ready?

465
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,583
[STING]
Yeah.

466
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,625
[LYON] Heh. They're definitely
getting a different welcome

467
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,625
from all that booing during
the games' opening ceremonies.

468

[LYON gasps]

469
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:57,958
[MATO]
Wait a minute!

470
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,125
Strange.

471
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,083
[MATO]
Uhhhhhh...

472
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,875
[DARTON] Hm.

473
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:04,916
[CHAPATI]
Unbelievable!

474
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Team Fairy Tail is
keeping us on our toes

475
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,416
by this completely
unexpected roster change!

476
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,416
The man who
singlehandedly defeated

477
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,750
Sabertooth's Twin Dragons
has been replaced!

478
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,125
By Juvia?!

479
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,583
[ROGUE] Natsu is out
of the competition?!

480
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:19,958
That's alright with me...

481
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:23,375
In fact, that's the best
news I've heard all day.

482
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,875
[ROGUE]
I suppose you're right.

483
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,666
[CHAPATI] After such a strong
showing in the last round,

484
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,625
this decision is a real
head-scratcher.

485
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:29,708
What could be the reason?

486
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:30,791
[YAJIMA]
Hmmm...

487
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,750
Hopefully nothing
bad has happened.

488
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,333
[MAN E] But that
doesn't make any sense.

489
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:37,083
[MAN F] Aw man,
I wanted to see him fight again!

490
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,291
How interesting...

491
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,958
it would seem he hasn't
fully recovered yet.

492
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,250
[MAVIS]
Very clever, Sixth Master.

493
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,750
[MAKAROV] To be perfectly
honest with you,

494
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,666
it was the only real
choice that I had...

495
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,000
There is a chance that
winning the games would

496
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:59,875
get our poor Lucy back through
more "official" channels.

497
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,375
However...

498
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:04,166
In a situation like this,
we must explore every option...

499
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,666
We can't put all our
eggs in one basket.

500
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,125
[MAKAROV] Everybody is
focused on the games,

501
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,875
and we will cheer our
fighters on with gusto!

502
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,458
That's what the public
will be seeing.

503
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,125
[MAKAROV] But some of our
most capable wizards

504
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:23,083
will set out on a secret
rescue mission.

505
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,750
A two-pronged strategy...

506
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,375
Nicely done.

507
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:39,083
[MAKAROV]
Godspeed, my children!

508
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,125
We're counting on you!

509
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,500
[HAPPY]
This is horrible!

510
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:17,000
Lucy got kidnapped by
that royal army bigwig!

511
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,541
What are we gonna do?!

512
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,583
[NATSU] Relax, little guy.
It'll be fine.

513
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,708
We'll just go in and
bust her out, no prob!

514
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:24,958
[HAPPY] Yeah? But how
are we gonna do that?

515
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:26,500
[NATSU]
Come on...

516
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:28,791
Don't forget that we have a
plan-making genius on our team!

517
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:30,541
We got this!

518
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:33,125
[BOTH]
Next time: Fairy Tactician!

519
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:35,041
[HAPPY]
I know but I'm still worried...

520
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:37,625
I mean, can you actually
memorize a plan?

521
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:38,625
[NATSU]
Hmm...

522
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:41,666
I'm sure I can
wing it, at least!
