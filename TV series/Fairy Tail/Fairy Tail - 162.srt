[BACCHUS] Hey, whaddaya
say we make our own bet?

160
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,791
Like those last guys did.

161
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,291
[ELFMAN] What?

162
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:54,708
Your sisters are a couple
of smokin' hot little numbers.

163
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,416
[ELFMAN] So what's your point?

164
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,708
[BACCHUS] Come on man,
I know you can't be that dense.

165
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:04,291
If I win the match, they
keep me company tonight.

166
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,083
Both at the same time.

167
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,541
Scumbag.

168
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,750
[HAPPY] Both of them?
That is seriously messed up.

169
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,875
What nerve!

170
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,125
[BACCHUS] Now it's your turn.
If you win.

171
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,375
[ELFMAN] Listen pal.

172
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,041
A real man doesn't tolerate
that kind of disrespect.

173
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,708
So get ready.

174
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,791
To get schooled.

175
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,208
So I reckon that means you

176
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,291
accept this little wager, do ya?

177
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,833
I'm so excited I got the shakes.

178
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,500
I slept like a log!

179
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,833
[NATSU] What's the deal?
Hello?

180
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,000
That's weird.

181
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,291
Did they all take
off or something?

182
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,583
[NATSU] Somebody
else was in here.

183
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,291
I can smell 'em.

184
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,791
[NATSU] This way!

185
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,666
[NATSU] Hey, you!

186
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,583
[MALE BANDIT 162A] Oh crap!

187
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,250
It's that guy from Fairy Tail!

188
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,750
[MALE BANDIT 162C]
We must've woken him up!

189
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,416
[NATSU] Stop right there!

190
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,916
You're not taking
them anywhere, ya hear?

191
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,791
[MALE BANDIT 162A] Run!
[MALE BANDIT 162B] Hurry!

192
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,791
I told you to stop!

193
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,583
[MALE BANDIT 162B]
He's crazy fast!

194
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:24,583
[MALE BANDIT 162C] What?

195
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,625
After seeing him
in that last game,

196
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,250
I didn't think
he could run at all!

197
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,791
[MALE BANDIT 162D]
I got this!

198
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,791
Let's see if he
can outrun a bullet!

199
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,041
Get outta my way!

200
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,541
Come back here!

201
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,000
I won't let you take Wendy!

202
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,625
[MALE BANDIT 162A]
He's catching up!

203
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,750
[MALE BANDIT 162B]
This guy is insane!

204
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,541
We need to get the lead out!

205
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,875
[MALE BANDIT 162C]
What do we do?

206
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,291
[MALE BANDIT 162A]
We gotta dump these other two!

207
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,708
[MALE BANDIT 162B] You idiot!

208
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,500
We're supposed to grab
the girl in the infirmary!

209
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,791
[MALE BANDIT 162A] But this old
broad and the cat ain't girls!

210
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,541
[MALE BANDIT 162B]
Then why did we grab 'em?

211
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,791
[MALE BANDIT 162C] Well,
they're all technically females.

212
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,916
[MALE BANDIT 162B]
They ain't no girls though!

213
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,625
Who hired you to do this?

214
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,958
[MALE BANDIT 162B]
We're doomed!

215
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,916
[CHAPATI] I've seen
plenty of one-sided matches

216
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,375
in my day but this
is just embarrassing.

217
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,458
Did Elfman come to lose?

218
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,833
I am gonna have
a wild time tonight.

219
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,375
Oh yeah.

220
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,958
No.
This is horrible!

221
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,458
This guy is way
more on your level, Erza.

222
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,583
Yes.
And unfortunately,

223
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,333
he's just getting started.

224
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,416
Get up Elfman.

225
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,791
Don't worry.

226
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,333
Your brother never fails
to come through in a pinch.

227
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,291
Yeah.
You're right.

228
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,833
Woo!
Get him, big guy!

229
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,583
Beast Soul; Weretiger!

230
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,416
This take over should
increase his speed.

231
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,166
But he still hasn't
landed a single attack.

232
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,916
What are we boys?

233
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
[ALL] Wild!

234
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,708
[GRAY] Elfman may be faster.
But that speed doesn't

235
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,958
do him any good if
he can't hit his target.

236
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,583
It's all because of
the weird way that guy moves.

237
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:15,916
Surprisingly enough.

238
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,416
It's a part of an
extremely rigorous technique.

239
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,833
One that focuses
magic into his palms.

240
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,208
[ERZA] He's very methodical.
He uses this power in

241
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,791
conjunction with
a specific style of

242
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:29,500
martial art he's mastered
known as "Chop-Hanging Palm."

243
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,375
This particular
style specializes

244
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,166
in devastating palm strikes.

245
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,083
All delivered from that
unique stance he's taking.

246
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,916
[GRAY] I see what you mean.

247
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
[ERZA] But Bacchus has
taken this all a step further.

248
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,708
He's modified it to create
his own method of fighting.

249
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,500
One that he calls
"drunken chop hanging palm."

250
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:48,791
He's. Drunk?

251
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,000
This dude get hammered
when he fights?

252
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,291
[ERZA] That's right.

253
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:55,041
The "drunken hawk's"
moves are unpredictable.

254
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,833
The alcohol also
increases his destructive

255
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,583
power and dulls
his sensitivity to pain.

256
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,250
[ERZA] But that's not
the issue Elfman's facing now.

257
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,666
[ERZA] The problem.

258
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,250
Is that he hasn't had
a drop to drink yet.

259
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,416
A rare technique.

260
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,625
The chop-hanging
palm is quite obscure.

261
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:22,958
And now all our
fans watching can say

262
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,500
they've seen it with
their very own eyes!

263
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,458
What a great moment
in the history of cool!

264
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,333
I think I've already seen it!

265
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:32,291
So that explains the craziness
that went down at the bar.

266
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,500
Man.

267
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,041
Do ya think Elfman's
gonna pull this one out?

268
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,500
I think he's got it in him.

269
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,875
He's got way more than
size working in his favor.

270
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,166
Yeah, you're right.

271
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,708
All of us need to
keep on believing in him.

272
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,041
What are we boys?

273
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,875
[ALL] Wild!

274
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,000
Elfman get up!

275
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,666
Bacchus relies
on his liquor to keep

276
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,333
his moves erratic
and super powerful.

277
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,416
But he hasn't even
touched the bottle

278
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,458
that he's got down in the arena.

279
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,625
[LUCY] He's sober?

280
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,875
[GRAY] Which means
he's hardly even trying.

281
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,083
[CHAPATI] Whoa!
His takeover has worn off!

282
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,291
Looks like he's back to
being just a beast of a man.

283
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,125
That'll cost him a tremendous
amount of magic power.

284
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,958
Not a good combination with
all the damage he's taken.

285
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,250
[JASON] What an awesome fight!

286
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,750
Oh man.
I can't wait.

287
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,208
[CHAPATI] Is that it?

288
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,583
Is Elfman down for the count?

289
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,250
Sorry folks, but I forgot
to mention something earlier.

290
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,541
Mato, beloved mascot
and referee of the

291
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,708
Grand Magic Games, could
not attend today's events.

292
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,500
So I will be serving
as day two's honorary referee!

293
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,375
Oh?

294
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,666
Cool!

295
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,333
The plot twists are
totally unstoppable today!

296
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:52,375
Couldn't make it?

297
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,916
What?

298
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,250
Couldn't they've just thrown
some other schmuck in the suit?

299
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,875
It's not a suit, he's a
real-live talking pumpkin!

300
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,583
[BACCHUS] Ah.
Back on your feet.

301
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:05,166
All your howling about being
a man ain't just for show.

302
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,041
[ELFMAN] Listen up, you dog.
I never told you what I wanted.

303
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,416
[BACCHUS] Huh?

304
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,541
Our bet.

305
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,291
What I want you to do if I win.

306
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,791
[BACCHUS] This is
gonna be the only time

307
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,541
this comes up, so go ahead.

308
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,791
Tell me what happens if you win.

309
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,083
I want you.

310
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,333
And the rest of your Guild bros.

311
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,208
To go by the
name "Quatro Puppy."

312
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:26,583
[ALL] What?

313
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:27,625
Funny.

314
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,291
But do you think
he'll agree to that?

315
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,791
It is pretty silly.

316
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,166
It's hilarious!

317
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,291
And I think it suits
them way better!

318
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,791
[BACCHUS] Okay, okay.

319
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,083
You got yourself a deal!

320
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,291
[BACCHUS] Last call!

321
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,416
He's guzzling now!

322
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,708
That's right.
So he's serious.

323
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,166
No way!

324
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,291
[CHAPATI] Here we go!

325
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,458
It's happening folks.

326
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,250
Bacchus downs
some "fighting fuel!"

327
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,166
Drunken Style.
Eh?

328
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,166
Wow,
I wanna try some too!

329
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,500
Cool brew!

330
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,666
[BACCHUS] Hit me
with your best shot.

331
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,208
Should be easy to knock down

332
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,500
a wobbly ol'
drunk like me, right?

333
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,250
Take over beast soul!

334
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,166
[BACCHUS] It's pointless!

335
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:13,916
So many hits!

336
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,500
And they all happened so fast.

337
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:16,875
Oh wow.

338
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,416
It's like he turned himself
into a gigantic blur.

339
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,875
[ERZA THINKS] Seven strikes
in the blink of eye!

340
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,666
That's unreal.

341
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,458
All those hits must have
caused quite a bit of damage.

342
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,333
Yes.
But look.

343
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,666
[Bacchus laughs]

00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,125
Feel that?

345
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,708
[BACCHUS] What in the hell?
He got me?

346
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:38,708
[CHAPATI] Uh oh!

347
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,083
Bacchus may
have double vision,

348
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,375
but he didn't
see that one coming!

349
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,916
What are you?

350
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,083
Lizardman.

351
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:54,500
I can't hit you, but go
on and hit me all you want.

352
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,541
[ERZA THINKS] It's his
own version of armor.

353
00:16:56,625 --> 00:17:00,791
Hold on...
that's crazy.

354
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,166
I don't know if that
strategy is gonna work.

355
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,375
He's like a
scaly punching bag.

356
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,208
He's making a big gamble.

357
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,000
And there's nothing we can do.

358
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,916
Just sit back
and watch it happen.

359
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,791
[ELFMAN] All right, bring it on!

360
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,541
Go nuts and hit me
with everything you've got!

361
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:20,375
I wanna see you rip those puny
little arms of yours to shreds!

362
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,541
Man.
This guy is wild.

363
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,875
I sure hope Elfman
knows what he's doing.

364
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,500
It's so reckless.

365
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,791
I know that thick,
scaly, lizardman skin

366
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,208
and all those spikes

367
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,166
would be tough for a barehanded
fighter to get through.

368
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,500
But still.

369
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,250
[JUVIA] Bacchus is much stronger

370
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,166
than your everyday opponent.

371
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,625
What, are ya scared?

00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,083
I like your style, man!

You know how to
get my blood pumpin'!

00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,333
Be a man!

375
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,333
[CHAPATI] And the
blows come raining down!

376
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,958
This is more
than a simple fight,

377
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,666
but an ultimate
showdown of wills!

378
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,666
[CHAPATI] Will Bacchus
wear himself out?

379
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,708
Or will the barrage prove
too much for Elfman?

380
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,333
[CHAPATI] It's too close!

381
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,000
I just can't call it!

382
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,125
Who will be left standing!

383
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,375
[BACCHUS]
Your name's Elfman?

384
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:24,583
[Bacchus laughs]

385
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:31,958
That's right I'm wild!

[ALL] Wild!

00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,666
No.
He lost?

388
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,708
[CHAPATI] He may be shaky,

389
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,250
but Bacchus has
risen to his feet!

390
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,541
[BACCHUS] I gotta tell ya, pal.

391
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,625
You--

392
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,625
Are a real man.

393
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,583
[CHAPATI] And Bacchus is down

394
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,250
like a sack of drunken potatoes!

395
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,833
[CHAPATI] The winner is Elfman!

396
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:10,250
From this victory, Team Fairy
Tail A scores ten points.

397
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:13,750
Which brings their total into
the double digits with twelve!

398
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,208
[ALL] Aw man!

399
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,666
[Elfman roars]

400
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,791
[CHAPATI] Is this manly roar,

401
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,708
the sound of
Fairy Tail's resurrection?

402
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,916
What an upset!
Elfman beats the odds

403
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,875
and snatches victory
from the jaws of defeat!

404
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,833
Yeah!

405

It's amazing!
Yay Elfman!

00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,208
Now child.

407
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,000
Shouldn't you
get back in bed?

408
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,125
I'm fine.

409
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,083
And it's all thanks
to Grandeena.

410
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:51,041
Didn't I tell you not
to call me by that name?

411
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,000
So, Natsu.

for somebody in Raven Tail!

were supposed to bring 'em

in the infirmary!

[IRIKI] Sure you were.

They can tell us all
about it at headquarters.

There was one before you.

There are more rounds to go.

428
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:29,833
But this win may give us the

429
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,916
momentum that
we've been looking for!

430

[IRIKI] I'm afraid the
operation was a failure.

what their target looks like?

How else could they
have taken the wrong girl?

[IRIKI] My apologies, sir.

[ARCADIOS] No matter.

We do have a plan B
to fall back on.

437

What has become
of the kidnappers?

[IRIKI] We've taken
them all into custody, sir.

[ARCADIOS] Ignorant
to the truth, I hope.

[IRIKI] Yes sir.

441

They still believe
that they were

442
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,375
hired by the Raven Tail guild.

443
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,916
[ARCADIOS] Luckily, we can
use the rivalry between

444
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,916
Raven Tail and
Fairy Tail to our advantage.

445

And when the opportunity arises,

we will have a celestial
wizard in our possession.
