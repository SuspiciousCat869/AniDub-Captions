[GILDARTS] So you're
the archbishop.

158
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,291
[ARCHBISHOP] Let me assure you,
there's no reason to be afraid.

159
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,625
This is simply the only way.

160
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,416
Zentopia can rectify the world.

161
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,833
[GILDARTS] I've got
some questions for ya.

162
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,666
You think you can
give me a straight answer?

163
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,916
[ARCHBISHOP] Let me assure you,
there's no reason to be afraid.

164
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,958
This is simply the only way
Zentopia can rectify the world.

165
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,791
Hey, are you even
listenin' to me, old man?

166
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,125
[ARCHBISHOP] Let me assure you,
there's no reason to be afraid.

167
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,666
This is pointless.

168
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,875
What in the heck
is wrong with him?

169
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,291
I think it's pretty likely
that somebody could be

170
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,416
using some kind of mind
control spell on him, don't you?

171
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,541
[GILDARTS] Who's that guy?

172
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,875
[LAKI] His name is Lapointe.
He's a Zentopian cardinal.

173
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,833
[LAPOINTE]
And if I'm not mistaken,

174
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:20,166
you're Gildarts Clive
of the Fairy Tail guild.

175
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,375
[GILDARTS] Wow.

176
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,458
I must be even more
famous than I thought.

177
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,791
I never would've
imagined that a

178
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,541
Zentopian cardinal
would know my name.

179
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,541
[GILDARTS] Sorry but I can't
sign any autographs right now.

180
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,416
I'm a little busy, you see.

181
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,083
[LAPOINTE] I commend
you and your colleague

182
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,125
for making it this far.

183
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:40,250
But, you've seen too much so
I'm afraid you will have to die.

184
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,625
Go ahead and try.

185
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,583
C'mon, show me what you've got.

186
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,250
[RACER] I'm too fast.

187
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,791
You can't...
keep up... with me.

188
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,333
[RACER] Stay away!

189
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,458
Stay away!

190
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:34,625
Just give up the fight.
There's no way you'll beat me.

191
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:43,416
[RACER] Faster.
Make me even faster!

192
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,208
[MIRAJANE] What did you do?

193
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,083
He's increased
his speed somehow!

194
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,750
[Racer cackles]

195
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,791
[Racer cackles]

196
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,208
[Racer cackles]

197
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:18,000
I admit you're
fast... However.

198
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:58,666
[RACER] I don't understand.
What happened?

199
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,375
How are you faster than me?

200
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:06,041
I'm not running away.

201
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,625
[MIRAJANE] Unlike you,
I'm moving forward.

202
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,958
[MIRAJANE] I have a purpose.

203
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,083
The desire to save my
friends pushes me

204
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:20,000
to fight harder and faster.

205
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:24,833
[MIRAJANE] If I may ask,
what are you running from?

206
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,875
[RACER] I'm not sure.

207
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,583
I've spent my
entire life running.

208
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,916
It's all I know.

209
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:38,333
[RACER]
I was always running away.

210
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,666
[MIRAJANE] I know what it is,

211
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,833
you've been running
from yourself.

212
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:50,250
From... myself?

213
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:53,791
[MIRAJANE] Yes.
You're fleeing from your past.

214
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:57,708
[MIRAJANE] All the pain,
distress, and the fear.

215
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,666
[MIRAJANE] I know what
it's like to try to escape it.

216
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,125
I used to do the
same thing myself.

217
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,375
I tried to run,
but it never helped.

218
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:24,208
[MIRAJANE] Believe me when I say
I understand your heartache.

219
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:41,041
[MIRAJANE] Where are you going?
No one's chasing you.

220
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:50,791
[MIRAJANE] There's no
need to run anymore.

221
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,041
[KINANA]
Someone's calling out to me.

222
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,583
[KINANA] But I wonder who.
I have to find them.

223
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,625
[MIDNIGHT]
It seems Racer has fallen.

224
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:29,916
Cobra, Angel, you
must stop them at once.

225
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,833
[GUTMAN] We gotta stay
faithful to Zentopia's doctrine,

226
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:37,916
silly-billy.

227
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,083
In other words,
we can never doubt it.

228
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,291
Never ever.

229
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,833
[NATSU] But what'll you do
if someone does doubt it?

230
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,083
[GUTMAN] You really wanna know?

231
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,250
Heathens go boom!

232
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,208
What is that?

233
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,458
It's Rupture magic.

234
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,083
Get away from it!

235
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,750
[GUTMAN] It expands
all the magic power

236
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:58,208
inside of my target
'til they go boom boom!

237
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:03,125
[Natsu cries out]

238
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,208
[COCO] Are you all right?

239
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:10,208
[GUTMAN] I'll clean away anyone
who goes against Zentopia.

240
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,166
Starting with you!

241
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,958
That's what you think!

242
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,458
[GUTMAN] I'm not scared of you!

243
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,166
[COCO] Leave him alone!

244
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,416
[GUTMAN] Oh, do
you wanna dance, too?

245
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,041
[GUTMAN] Time to rupture!

246
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,458
[GUTMAN]
You're gonna keep dancin'

247
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,958
as long as you've
got magic power!

248
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,125
[GUTMAN] Uh-oh.

249
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:41,833
[NATSU] We don't
have the time to be

250
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,625
messin' around with this loser!

251
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,500
[GUTMAN]
Then I'll speed things up.

252
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,083
Ready for your last dance?

253
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,875
How come I can't move?

254
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,708
[MARY] 'Cause I
totally immobilized you!

255
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,708
[NATSU] No way!

256
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,708
[GUTMAN]
What are you doin' to me?

257
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:04,041
I thought everybody who opposed
the archbishop was like, evil.

258
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:07,625
But with guys like you and the
Neo-Oración Seis hangin' around.

259
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,500
I totally can't tell
who's evil anymore.

260
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,708
I'm totally confused now.

261
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,416
Me, too.

262
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,958
[GUTMAN] I don't need to
move to use Rupture magic!

263
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,458
Watch out!

264
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:29,750
[Mary cries out]

265
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:38,041
[MARY] Immobilizing
people isn't all I do!

266
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,000
[MARY] Watch this!

267
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,125
Get outta here, now!

268
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,666
But Hughes...

269
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,833
Please.

270
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,708
This might be the
only chance for one of

271
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,500
us to find out what's
really going on!

272
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,250
Don't worry
about me just go!

273
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,666
Okay!

274
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,083
C'mon!

275
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,583
[CAPTAIN 146B] It's Fairy Tail!

276
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,416
Keep them away
from the cathedral!

277
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,208
Hurry men!

278
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,750
Fire!

279
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,583
[ICHIYA] Never underestimate
the Christina Advance!

280
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,125
Man!

281
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,291
[HAPPY] Oh, wow!

282
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:33,125
[BYRO] We meet again Fairy Tail.

283
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,625
[BYRO] Though my faith
in Zentopia is wavering.

284
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,666
I still have a duty to uphold.

285
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,041
I've no choice but to stop them.

286
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,958
Go, Kanaloa!

287
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,541
You've got to be joking.

288
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,875
Your octopus is no match for us!

289
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,791
Man!

290
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,291
Didya see that?

291
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,833
It deflected all of our shots!

292
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,333
[ICHIYA] Oh, no.

293
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,041
What a perilous parfum!

294
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,500
Hurry and knock
it off of the ship!

295
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,375
[BYRO] I'll leave you
to handle this, Kanaloa.

296
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,666
[BYRO] In the meantime,
I'm going to pay a visit to the

297
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,083
archbishop and
demand some answers.

298
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,500
Now what?

299
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:24,416
We don't want a
repeat of seven years ago!

300
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,375
I have no other choice;
deploy Spiral Anchors!

301
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,375
Man!

302
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:41,750
I shall defeat it by sacrificing
the Christina Advance.

303
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,833
[ICHIYA] Save yourselves
before it's too late.

304
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,916
[WENDY] But we
can't leave you behind!

305
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
[ICHIYA] Just do as I say!

306
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,583
You heard him; let's go!

307
00:18:58,666 --> 00:18:59,916
[ALL] Right!

308
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:07,750
Good luck.
My friends... man!

309
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:17,958
[explosion]

310
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:18,875
[WENDY] Ichiya.

311
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:19,875
[GRAY] That jerk!

312
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,666
Actin' all cool
'til the very end!

313
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,291
[ELFMAN] He was
the manliest of men!

314
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,625
Surviving danger
is what Ichiya does best,

315
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,541
so I'm sure
that he'll be fine.

316
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,708
Chin up, everyone!

317
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,125
Let's go find Natsu and Lucy!

318
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,541
[ALL] Yeah!

319
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:38,291
Let me assure you,
there's no reason to be afraid.

320
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,625
This is simply the only way.

321
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,916
Zentopia can rectify the world.

322
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,916
[NATSU] Hold on a second!

323
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,750
[GILDARTS] Natsu.

324
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,958
I'm surprised to see that
you broke out as well...

325
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:52,958
...Coco.

326
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,583
Cardinal.

327
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:55,791
And you...

328
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,750
I know exactly who you are.

329
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:58,791
[NATSU] Huh?

330
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,166
You're Natsu Dragneel.

331
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,500
A Dragon Slayer wizard.

332
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,750
Hey, wait a minute,
I know that smell.

333
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:08,958
No way...

334
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,375
You smell just like
that Master Zero guy!

335
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,666
You don't really
think it's him, do you?

336
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,666
[Lapointe laughs]

337
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,541
I dunno whether this
creep's "Master Zero" or not.

338
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,625
But he is the one who's been
controlling the archbishop.

339
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,416
[ERZA] What is it?

340
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,666
I just heard Gildarts' voice.

341
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,958
Apparently Zentopia's
archbishop,

342
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,083
is being controlled
by Cardinal Lapointe!

343
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,583
[ERZA] He is?

344
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:38,125
[BYRO THINKS] His holiness is
being manipulated by Lapointe?

345
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,333
All this time,
he's been using his authority

346
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,458
to take advantage of everyone.

347
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,458
Including me!

348
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:49,541
[BYRO] I'm not going to
let him get away with this!

349
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,041
[NATSU]
I just realized somethin'.

350
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,625
If you're controlling the
archbishop then you must be the

351
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,666
one who decided to use the
phony Michelle to trick us.

352
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,166
[LAPOINTE] And what if I am?

353
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,750
Then you're goin' down!
I'm gonna burn you to a crisp!

354
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,333
[GILDARTS] Hang on, kid.

355
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,166
If anyone fights him,
it should be me.

356
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,291
[NATSU] Aw c'mon, Gildarts!

357
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,958
Let me do it!

358
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,666
You don't have a prayer.

359
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,916
[GILDARTS] Laki!

360
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,625
[LAPOINTE] Since you two
seem to enjoy fighting,

361
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,083
let's see what happens
when you exchange blows.

362
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,083
[NATSU]
We ain't fightin' each other!

363
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,416
[Lapointe laughs]

364
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,041
[LAPOINTE] Defy me
and I will kill the young lady.

365
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,541
[NATSU] No way.

366
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,583
[GILDARTS] Let her go! She's
got nothin' to do with this!

367
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,708
[LAPOINTE] What?

368
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,041
[NATSU] Octo-geezer!

369
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:40,208
[BYRO] How dare you
try to deceive me, Lapointe!

370
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,000
Byro.

371
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,666
[IMITATIA] They're coming.

372
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,166
[IMITATIA] Your beloved friends
are on their way to you.

373
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,666
[LUCY] My friends.

374
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,625
From Fairy Tail?

375
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,625
So they were able
to find a way to get inside!

376
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,166
[IMITATIA] Yes,
but I'm afraid they're

377
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,000
going to lose their lives.

378
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,166
What do you mean?

379
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,833
Why are they going
to lose their lives?

380
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:21,416
[IMITATIA]
Because of you, Big Sister.

381
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,583
[LUCY] Huh?

382
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:23,916
[IMITATIA]
They care about you too much.

383
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,250
So I'm going to
have to kill them.

384
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:28,000
[LUCY] No.
Why?

385
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:30,958
[IMITATIA] I won't
let anyone else have you.

386
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:35,416
[IMITATIA] Big Sister.
You belong to me!

387
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:40,833
[LUCY] Michelle.

388
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:46,416
♪

389
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,250
[NATSU] Everyone
keeps changin' ages!

390
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:15,500
What the heck is goin' on?

391
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:16,916
[HAPPY] Time got all messed up!

392
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,291
We gotta hurry and stop
it before things get really bad!

393
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,500
[NATSU] Would you
mind telling me what

394
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:21,541
you mean by "really bad"?

395
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:22,583
[HAPPY] Well, uh.

396
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:24,166
Are you sure you
wanna go into that?

397
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,875
[NATSU] I can't get all fired up
unless I've got a good reason.

398
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,125
[HAPPY] Gimme a break!

399
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:28,750
Okay fine, what about
Lucy bein' in danger?

400
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,791
Ain't that enough reason for ya?

401
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:33,458
[HAPPY AND NATSU] Next time:
To the Infinity Castle!

402
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:35,333
[NATSU] Guess it's not enough
to get my blood boiling.

403
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:37,833
I mean, I'm worried and all
but I'm not "fired up," y'know?

404
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:39,166
[HAPPY] Would you
quit bein' a big dummy

405
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,708
and just go save Lucy already?

406
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:41,500
[NATSU] Yeah yeah.
