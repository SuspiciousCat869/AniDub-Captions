1
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,958
- HEY, GUYS, READY FOR 
SOME MORE "FAIRY TAIL"?

2
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,666
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING,

3
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,333
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE ROOM.

4
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:26,333
AND DON'T SIT TOO CLOSE
TO THE TV.

5
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:29,166
- Happy:
PREVIOUSLY ON "FAIRY TAIL"...

6
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,666
WE WERE ATTACKED

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,500
BY A RIVAL GUILD
CALLED PHANTOM LORD.

8
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:35,166
AND THEY TOTALLY DESTROYED
OUR MEETING HALL.

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,583
WE'VE NEVER BEEN
ON GOOD TERMS WITH THEM,

10
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,416
BUT THEY WENT TOO FAR
WHEN THEY ATTACKED

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,125
LEVY'S TEAM
AND KIDNAPPED LUCY.

12
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:41,750
NOW THE MASTER'S ANGRY.

13
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,708
HE'S DECLARED WAR AGAINST
THE PHANTOM LORD GUILD.

14
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:49,125
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

15
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,625
- ( man groans )

16
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,208
- FAIRY TAIL'S COME CALLING!

17
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,041
- LET'S GET 'EM!
- ( all shouting )

18
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,958
- ( Happy speaking )

19
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,166
- ( all screaming )

20
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,583
- ( grunting )

21
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,333
- CARD MAGIC!

22
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,583
LIGHTNING!
REVERSE TOWER!

23
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,166
LOVERS!

24
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,125
FATE OF LIGHTNING!

25
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,000
- RING MAGIC!

26
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,541
TWISTER!

27
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,041
- AAH!

28
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,000
COME ON, MAN UP!

29
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:27,916
DON'T YOU WANNA BE
LIKE ME?!

30
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,875
- WHOA, THAT GUY'S A BRUTE.

31
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,166
- WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS ARM?
- IT'S TAKE OVER MAGIC.

32
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,541
- WHY WOULD ANYONE LET
A MONSTER TAKE OVER THEIR ARM?

33
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,125
- YOU GUYS, THAT'S ELFMAN!

34
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,125
- I'VE HEARD OF HIM.
HE KILLS MONSTERS,

35
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:43,208
THEN ABSORBS THEIR POWER. THEY
CALL HIM "BEAST ARM" ELFMAN.

36
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,208
- ( cackling )

37
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,708
- ( crashes )

38
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:51,708
- WHO'S THAT?
- THAT'S GOTTA BE...

39
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,041
- ( chuckles )

40
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,583
- IT'S THE IRON DRAGON SLAYER.

41
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,500
BLACK STEEL GAJEEL.

42
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,708
- YOU ATTACKED LEVY!
AAH!

43
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,291
( groans )

44
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,250
- AW, MAN.
- WHAT THE--?

45
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,458
HE JUST KNOCKED OUT HIS OWN
GUILD MATES WITH THAT ATTACK.

46
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,208
- ( chuckles )

47
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,208
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.

48
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,208
UNLESS YOU SCUM ARE
TOO SCARED

49
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,375
TO FACE THE GREAT
IRON DRAGON SLAYER.

50
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,791
- TOO SCARED?!

51
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,791
REAL MEN HAVE NO FEAR!

52
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,083
- ( laughs )

53
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,083
YOU'RE ELFMAN, RIGHT?

54
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:33,166
AHH, NOT BAD, BIG GUY.

55
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,833
- WELL, THAT'S 'CAUSE
I'M A REAL MAN.

56
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:39,958
- YEAH?  THEN LET'S SEE
HOW A REAL MAN HANDLES THIS!

57
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,375
- ( all grunting )

58
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,208
( screaming )
- THEY'RE PHANTOM!

59
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,625
YOU ATTACKED YOUR OWN MEN?

60
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,125
- 'CAUSE I KNEW
IT'D DISTRACT YOU.

61
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,833
- NATSU?
- HIYAH!

62
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,666
- WHOA, THAT KID
SENT HIM FLYING.

63
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,166
- NOBODY'S EVER
DONE THAT BEFORE.

64
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,250
- ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

65
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,000
I'M FAIRY TAIL'S DRAGON SLAYER.

66
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,583
ELFMAN, LEAVE THIS GUY TO ME.

67
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,666
- COME ON. FIRST YOU USE
ME AS A SPRINGBOARD,

68
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,208
AND NOW YOU WANNA STEAL
MY MAN-TO-MAN FIGHT?

69
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,791
- IRON DRAGON CLUB!

70
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:17,958
- ( grunts )

71
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,666
- NATSU!

72
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,083
- YOU DESTROYED
OUR GUILD HALL...

73
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,625
AND YOU ATTACKED LEVY
AND HER TEAM.

74
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:26,833
- ( gasps slightly )

75
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,875
- I'LL MAKE YOU PAY!

76
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,166
- AAH!

77
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,375
- WHOO, THE KID'S
FIRED UP NOW.

78
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,250
- YEAH, I'D HATE TO BE
THAT OTHER GUY.

79
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,583
- HMM!
- HE'S QUITE A WIZARD.

80
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:46,208
- ALL RIGHT, FINE,
YOU'RE MANLIER THAN I THOUGHT.

81
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,708
I'LL LET YOU HAVE THIS ONE,
BUT YOU GOTTA PROMISE ME

82
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:49,750
THAT YOU'RE GONNA--

83
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,208
- YOU BET. I'LL BEAT
HIM TO A PULP.

84
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,833
- NICE TRY,
BUT I'M STILL STANDING.

85
00:05:56,916 --> 00:06:00,166
- TRUE.  YOU WON'T BE
FOR MUCH LONGER, THOUGH.

86
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,666
- OH, YEAH?

87
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,666
- UH-OH.

88
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,041
AAH!

89
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,916
- THAT HURT.

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,250
- THIS IS PRETTY CRAZY.

91
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,208
- AW, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

92
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,166
YOU CAN DISH IT OUT,
BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE IT?

93
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:20,000
- ( laughs ) IT'S GONNA TAKE
MORE THAN THAT TO KEEP ME DOWN.

94
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:24,000
- YOU SERIOUSLY THINK
YOU CAN BEAT ME, YOU PYRO?

95
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,750
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN "THINK"?
I KNOW THAT I CAN.

96
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,333
- WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

97
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,791
- YOUR STEEL BEAMS
CAN'T EVEN TOUCH ME.

98
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,083
YOU BETTER START
STEPPING UP YOUR GAME!

99
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,708
- THE RUMORS ARE TRUE.

100
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:41,333
YOU'RE WAY MORE POWERFUL
THAN YOU LOOK.

101
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,333
THAT ACTUALLY BURNS A LITTLE.

102
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,833
SO, IS THAT ALL YOU GOT...

103
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,333
SALAMANDER?

104
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,041
- THAT WAS MY WARM-UP.

105
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,916
I'M JUST GETTING STARTED.

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,416
YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHING YET,
YOU METAL FREAK.

107
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,541
MAN, HE'S TOUGH.

108
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,291
- ( laughing )

109
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,666
- ( grunting )

110
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,625
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT, PUNK?

111
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,416
- DON'T GET COCKY,
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

112
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,666
- EVERYTHING'S SHAKING.

113
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,125
- I GUESS THEY'RE
GOING AT IT.

114
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,666
- I DON'T LIKE
THE SOUND OF THAT.

115
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,333
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

116
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,083
- THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
MASTER MAKAROV'S ANGRY.

117
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,125
- IT'S CALLED THE GIANT'S WRATH.

118
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,500
- NOBODY WILL BE ABLE
TO STOP HIM NOW.

119
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:45,666
- ( whimpers )

120
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,041
- HE'S GONNA MAKE
THE GUILD HALL COLLAPSE.

121
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:50,458
- WHEN HE GETS ANGRY,
THE MASTER'S EVEN MANLIER.

122
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,666
- PREPARE TO FIGHT!

123
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,791
WE CANNOT LOSE
AS LONG AS MASTER MAKAROV

124
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,416
IS WITH US.

125
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,500
- ( chuckles )

126
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,833
- JOSE!

127
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,833
- LOOK WHAT THE CAT
DRAGGED IN.

128
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,166
- WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING
FAIRY TAIL?

129
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,791
TELL ME!

130
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,500
- I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN QUITE A WHILE, MAKAROV.

131
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,458
SIX YEARS AGO AT
A GUILD MASTERS CONFERENCE.

132
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:37,208
I REMEMBER THAT DAY.
I WAS A COMPLETE MESS.

133
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:41,125
I CAN'T HOLD MY LIQUOR
AS WELL AS THE REST OF YOU.

134
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,625
- AAH!

135
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,083
I DIDN'T COME HERE
FOR SMALL TALK.

136
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:51,041
I WANT ANSWERS, JOSE.

137
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,041
- ( laughs )

138
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,541
- A PROJECTION?
YOU COWARD.

139
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,000
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU'D FLEE

140
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,708
WITH YOUR TAIL
BETWEEN YOUR LEGS.

141
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,000
- IT'S NOT COWARDICE.

142
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,916
I'M SIMPLY TRYING
TO AVOID A FIGHT

143
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,041
BETWEEN TWO OF
THE WIZARD SAINTS.

144
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:08,666
IN LIEU OF THAT MESS,
I PREFER A SENSIBLE VICTORY

145
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,833
WITHOUT ALL THE COMMOTION.

146
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:14,958
- WHY ARE YOU HIDING?
COME AND FACE ME LIKE A MAN!

147
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,458
LUCY?

148
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:24,166
BUT WHY?
- WHY, YOU ASK?

149
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,000
YOU MEAN SHE'S A MEMBER
OF YOUR GUILD,

150
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,958
AND YOU DON'T KNOW?

151
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,958
I'M SURPRISED THAT
MISS LUCY HEARTFILIA

152
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,541
NEVER TOLD YOU THE TRUTH.

153
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,916
- ( grunts )
NO, DON'T!

154
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,041
WHERE'D HE COME FROM?

155
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,750
I COULDN'T EVEN
SENSE HIS PRESENCE.

156
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,916
- IT'S SO SAD!

157
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,166
SO SAD!

158
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,625
- AAH!

159
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,666
- WHAT THE--?

160
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,708
- SOMETHING FELL 
FROM THE RAFTERS!

161
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:55,916
- ( gasps )

162
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,208
- ( all murmuring )

163
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,250
- IT'S HEARTBREAKING.

164
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,958
WHY AM I SUDDENLY
FEELING MELANCHOLY?

165
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,416
( cries softly )

166
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,833
IT MUST BE BECAUSE
THE WORLD HAS JUST LOST

167
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,583
A GREAT WIZARD.

168
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,791
- WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?

169
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,750
I FEEL WEAK.
MY MAGIC... 

170
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,041
IT'S GONE.

171
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,458
- IT'S GRAMPS!
- IS HE OKAY? 

172
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:17,916
- MASTER!

173
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,500
- Aria:
SUCH SORROW.

174
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,791
- MAKAROV IS POWERLESS NOW.

175
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,000
THANKS TO ARIA OF THE HEAVENS,

176
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,833
A MEMBER OF PHANTOM'S
ELEMENT FOUR.

177
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,833
HE HAS THE ABILITY TO MAKE
OTHER WIZARDS' POWERS

178
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,000
DISAPPEAR INTO THIN AIR.

179
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,833
I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY

180
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,416
WE'VE WON THIS ROUND,
FAIRY TAIL.

181
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,125
- ( groaning )
MY POWER IS...

182
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,250
MY MAGIC POWER IS--

183
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,041
- MASTER, CALM DOWN.
- WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

184
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,958
- I DON'T KNOW.
BUT I DON'T SENSE

185
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,958
ANY MAGIC ENERGY
COMING FROM HIM AT ALL.

186
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:59,958
- GRAY, ARE YOU SAYING HE'S
JUST AN ORDINARY OLD MAN NOW?

187
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,500
- NO, THAT CAN'T BE!

188
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,375
- COME ON, GRAMPS!
YOU CAN PULL THROUGH THIS.

189
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,625
- GUESS THE FUN'S OVER.

190
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,916
AND JUST WHEN THINGS
WERE STARTING TO GET GOOD.

191
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,333
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
GRAMPS IS SO POWERFUL.

192
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,833
HOW'D THEY BEAT HIM?

193
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,166
- ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT
IS TO GO UP THERE.

194
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,791
- THE MASTER'S BEEN DEFEATED!
- FOR REAL?

195
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,958
- WHAT?  HE'S OUT?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

196
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,958
- YOU GUYS, WE CAN BEAT 'EM.

197
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,291
- THEY'RE NOT HALF AS STRONG
WITHOUT THEIR MASTER.

198
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,166
- AND WE'VE GOT GAJEEL AND
THE ELEMENT FOUR ON OUR SIDE.

199
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,333
- ( gasps ) 
THIS IS BAD.

200
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,958
- NOW'S OUR CHANCE!
- LET'S GET 'EM!

201
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:36,166
- ( Phantom Lord Guild
shouting )

202
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,791
- DON'T YOU START
GETTING COCKY!

203
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,208
- AW, CRAP, WHAT NOW?

204
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,583
- WE'LL JUST HAVE TO
FIGHT HARDER.

205
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:45,333
- TAKE THIS!
TRI-ELEMENT COMBO ATTACK!

206
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:46,833
- AAH!  OH, NO!

207
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,750
( screams )
- CANA!

208
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,208
- ( groans )

209
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,083
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME.
YOU'RE LUCKY.

210
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,375
- MACAO...
- ( all groaning )

211
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,250
- Cana: YOU SHOULDN'T 
PUSH YOURSELF SO HARD.

212
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,333
YOU'RE TOO OLD FOR THIS.

213
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,208
- ( groaning )

214
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,583
- ( chuckles )

215
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:06,708
WELL, I CAN SEE
WHERE THIS IS GOING.

216
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,291
- WE CAN'T DO THIS.

217
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,333
WITHOUT THE MASTER
WE AREN'T STRONG ENOUGH.

218
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,125
AND OUR MORALE'S
DANGEROUSLY LOW.

219
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,125
WE MUST RETREAT!

220
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,708
EVERYONE, BACK TO 
THE GUILD AT ONCE!

221
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,041
- ERZA?
- NO WAY!

222
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,291
WE CAN'T JUST GIVE UP.

223
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,125
- REAL MEN NEVER RETREAT.

224
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,666
- I STILL GOT FIGHT IN ME.

225
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,958
- YEAH, ME TOO.
LET'S STAY.

226
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:30,041
- WE CAN'T.  WE DON'T STAND
A CHANCE AGAINST JOSE.

227
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,583
NOW RETREAT!
THAT'S AN ORDER!

228
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:35,291
- ( all clamoring )

229
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,500
- THERE THEY GO...

230
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,000
I KNEW IT WOULDN'T BE LONG

231
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,833
BEFORE THOSE GUTLESS COWARDS
GAVE UP

232
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,416
AND STARTED RUNNING
FOR THEIR LIVES.

233
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,166
- THEY'RE RETREATING
WITH SORROW IN THEIR HEARTS.

234
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,333
- HUH?  ARIA?

235
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,625
I SEE YOU'RE JUST 
AS CREEPY AS EVER.

236
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,250
I GOTTA COMMEND YOU ON TAKING
DOWN THAT FAIRY TAIL GEEZER. 

237
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,958
I JUST FOLLOWED
MASTER JOSE'S ORDERS.

238
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,958
BUT THANK YOU!

239
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,958
- WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS CRYING?
JEEZ, CUT IT OUT.

240
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,250
SO, WHAT HAPPENED
WITH THAT LUCY GIRL?

241
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,625
- ( exhales )

242
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,125
- SHE'S BEEN CAPTURED.

243
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,791
THE POOR WRETCH IS BEING HELD
IN A GLOOMY CELL

244
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,208
AT HEADQUARTERS.

245
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,416
- SO MUCH FOR GIVING HER
A WARM WELCOME, HUH?

246
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,791
- NO WAY.
- IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

247
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,875
- GAJEEL!

248
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,375
- WE'LL FINISH THIS SOMEDAY...

249
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,166
SALAMANDER.

250
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,333
- THOSE JERKS KIDNAPPED LUCY.

251
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,458
- AAH!

252
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,250
- EVERYBODY OUT!
LET'S GO!

253
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,666
- I'M NOT GOING BACK YET.

254
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,250
I WON'T LEAVE TILL
I GET REVENGE.

255
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:37,083
THEY GOTTA PAY FOR
WHAT THEY DID TO US.

256
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,708
- PLEASE...

257
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,166
- ERZA...

258
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:45,875
- I'M SORRY.

259
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,083
IT'S OUR ONLY OPTION.

260
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,958
WE NEED HIM.

261
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:53,083
WE'RE COMPLETELY HELPLESS
WITHOUT THE MASTER.

262
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,000
- ( all shouting )

263
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,291
- YEAH-- AAH!

264
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,916
NO.  THE SALAMANDER...

265
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,791
AND THAT CAT!
- YOU GOT IT, BUDDY.

266
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,791
AND WE NEED TO CHAT.

267
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,875
- PLEASE DON'T HURT ME!

268
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,333
- ( chattering )

269
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,125
- SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW?

270
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,750
- ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?
WE'RE GONNA GO SAVE LUCY.

271
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,958
- ( man groans )

272
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:29,833
- ALL RIGHT, PAL,
WHERE IS SHE?

273
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:30,875
TELL ME.

274
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,458
- HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

275
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,333
I DON'T KNOW A LUCY.

276
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,333
( screaming )

277
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,958
THIS HURTS SO BAD!
- START TALKING.

278
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,083
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU, DUDE.
I DON'T KNOW NOTHING.

279
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,875
I'M SERIOUS, DUDE.
NOW PUT OUT THE FIRE!

280
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,208
- IF YOU PHANTOM GUYS HURT
ANOTHER ONE OF MY FRIENDS...

281
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:49,708
I SWEAR I'LL BURN EVERY
ONE OF YOU INTO A PILE OF ASHES.

282
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,041
- AAH!

283
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,416
I TOLD YOU, MAN,

284
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,083
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF
THIS LUCY CHICK.

285
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,083
IF I KNEW WHO SHE WAS
I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU BY NOW!

286
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,458
- FUNNY YOU SHOULD SAY THAT,
'CAUSE I WAS JUST THINKING

287
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,166
I SHOULD HAVE BURNED YOU
TO A CRISP BY NOW.

288
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,375
- AYE!

289
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,000
- OUR HEADQUARTERS
IS UP AHEAD.

290
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,583
IF I HAD TO GUESS,
I'D SAY THEY PROBABLY

291
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,291
GOT HER LOCKED UP THERE.
OKAY?!

292
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,666
- YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT
IN THE FIRST PLACE!

293
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,041
- AYE!

294
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:22,750
- ( gasps )

295
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,458
WHAT THE--?
HOW DID I GET HERE?

296
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,458
- SO YOU'RE FINALLY AWAKE.

297
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,625
I WAS GETTING WORRIED
ABOUT YOU, LUCY.

298
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:34,291
- WHO ARE YOU?
- ( door opens, closes )

299
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:39,291
- I AM MASTER JOSE PORLA
OF THE PHANTOM LORD GUILD.

300
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,625
- YOU'RE WITH PHANTOM?!

301
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,291
THAT'S RIGHT.

302
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,250
I WAS CAPTURED BY TWO
OF THE ELEMENT FOUR. 

303
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:49,250
- I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE
FOR THIS DINGY CELL.

304
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,875
AND BEING TIED UP 
MUST BE DEGRADING.

305
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,541
BUT I'M AFRAID
I HAD NO CHOICE, MY DEAR.

306
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,000
THAT IS HOW YOU TREAT 
A PRISONER, AFTER ALL.

307
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,041
- YOU'RE THE JERKS WHO ATTACKED
MY FRIEND LEVY!

308
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,416
YOU'D BETTER LET ME GO.

309
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,791
MY FRIENDS ARE GONNA COME
LOOKING FOR ME.

310
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,208
- DEPENDING ON YOUR WILLINGNESS
TO COOPERATE,

311
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,041
I'M FULLY PREPARED
TO TREAT YOU

312
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,750
AS PHANTOM LORD'S
ESTEEMED GUEST,

313
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,666
RATHER THAN
A LOWLY PRISONER.

314
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,250
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

315
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,083
( screams )
YUCK!

316
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,291
THAT BUG CRAWLED ON ME!

317
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,833
- SEE?

318
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,791
YOU DON'T WANT TO
STAY IN HERE, DO YOU?

319
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,791
I HAVE A BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED
SUITE WAITING FOR YOU,

320
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,541
IF YOU'LL PROMISE TO BEHAVE.

321
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,916
- WHY DOES YOUR GUILD KEEP
ATTACKING US?!

322
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,583
- WHO IS "US"?

323
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,458
OH, I'M SORRY, ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT FAIRY TAIL?

324
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,291
IT WAS A MEANS TO AN END...

325
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,916
AND THAT'S ALL.
- WHAT?

326
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,125
- YOU SEE, WE WERE WORKING
TOWARDS OUR MAIN OBJECTIVE

327
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,500
OF ACQUIRING
A CERTAIN SOMEONE.

328
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,500
THEY HAPPEN TO BE A MEMBER
OF FAIRY TAIL,

329
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:47,125
SO IF WE HAVE TO DESTROY
THE GUILD TO GET A HOLD OF THEM,

330
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,750
SO BE IT.
- WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

331
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,166
- OH, MY MY.

332
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,083
YOU'RE SUCH A NAIVE
YOUNG LADY.

333
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,750
NOT AT ALL WHAT I'D EXPECT
FROM A DEBUTANTE.

334
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:56,791
- ( gasps )

335
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,375
- I'M TALKING ABOUT
YOU, OF COURSE.

336
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,000
LADY LUCY,
THE PRIVILEGED DAUGHTER

337
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,875
OF THE WEALTHY
HEARTFILIA FAMILY.

338
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,958
- BUT HOW DID YOU
FIND OUT ABOUT THAT?

339
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,458
- YOU KNOW, I'M SURPRISED
YOU NEVER TOLD

340
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,583
YOUR FELLOW GUILD MEMBERS
THE TRUTH.

341
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,666
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY THE DAUGHTER

342
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,000
OF A WEALTHY TYCOON...

343
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,250
WOULD STOOP TO SUCH CHEAP
AND DANGEROUS WORK,

344
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:20,083
AS WIZARDING FOR SUCH
A LOW CLASS GUILD, DO YOU?

345
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,083
- I'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED?

346
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,500
- NO, MY DEAR.

347
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,500
I PROMISE
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

348
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,333
WE'RE NOT LOOKING
FOR RANSOM MONEY,

349
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,333
WE'RE JUST
DOING OUR JOB.

350
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,458
WE WERE HIRED BY YOUR FATHER
TO BRING YOU HOME TO HIM.

351
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,375
- ( gasps )

352
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,000
NO.

353
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,375
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

354
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,208
WHY WOULD HE WANT ME BACK?

355
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,583
- WHY DO YOU SEEM SO CONFUSED?

356
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,208
ANY FATHER WOULD GO
LOOKING FOR A DAUGHTER

357
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:46,083
WHO RAN AWAY FROM HOME.

358
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,458
- ( exhales )
NOT HIM.

359
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,458
HONESTLY, I'M SHOCKED HE EVEN
NOTICED THAT I WAS GONE.

360
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:54,166
I'M NOT EVER GONNA GO BACK
TO THAT HOUSE!

361
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,583
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING
TO DO WITH HIM!

362
00:17:56,666 --> 00:18:00,083
- OH, DEAR.  I SHOULD HAVE
KNOWN THAT YOU'D BE PROBLEMATIC.

363
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,291
- WELL, YOU MIGHT AS WELL
JUST LET ME GO.

364
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,708
- I'M SORRY,
BUT I CAN'T DO THAT.

365
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,416
- PLEASE.

366
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,041
I NEED TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

367
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,416
- GIVE ME A BREAK.
YOU DON'T THINK I'D FALL

368
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,041
FOR THE OLDEST TRICK
IN THE BOOK, DO YOU?

369
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:17,416
- NO.  FOR REAL.

370
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,958
I'M DYING HERE.

371
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,958
- FINE THEN.
- UH--

372
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,416
- GO AHEAD.
- A BUCKET?!

373
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,083
- ( laughs )

374
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:28,208
I'M READY FOR ANY OLD TRICK
YOU MIGHT THROW MY WAY.

375
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,708
- ( sighs )

376
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:30,708
GUESS IT'LL HAVE TO WORK.

377
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,083
- YOU'RE GONNA USE IT?!

378
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,333
( groans )
WELL...

379
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:37,083
I HAVE NEVER MET
SUCH A VULGAR YOUNG LADY.

380
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:40,416
I'LL TURN AWAY
BECAUSE I'M A GENTLEMAN.

381
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,625
- ( grunts )

382
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,541
- AAH!

383
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,625
- YOU KNOW, THERE'S A REASON
OLD TRICKS ARE STILL AROUND.

384
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,166
'CAUSE THEY WORK!

385
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:53,166
BYE!  TAKE CARE, 'KAY?

386
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,916
( gasps )

387
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,625
( exhales )

388
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,458
- ( groans )

389
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:06,375
OOPS, I FORGOT TO MENTION...

390
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,083
THIS CELL IS SEVERAL
STORIES HIGH.

391
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,208
( groaning )

392
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,541
I MUST ADMIT, YOU REALLY DID
A NUMBER ON ME, YOUNG LADY.

393
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:26,666
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO GET AWAY WITH IT.

394
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,083
YOU WILL BE PUNISHED.

395
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:33,208
I'LL SHOW YOU JUST HOW
TERRIFYING PHANTOM LORD CAN BE.

396
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:40,750
( gasps )

397
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,083
( groans )

398
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,625
- I HEARD HIM
IN THE DISTANCE.

399
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,583
I KNOW HE'S HERE.

400
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,625
NATSU!

401
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,958

402
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,541
AAH!

404
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,875

405
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,458
- YEAH.  THANK YOU.

406
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,750
I KNEW YOU'D SAVE ME.

407
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,250
- ( grunts )

408
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,333
THERE YOU GO.

409
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:34,750
ARE YOU OKAY?

410
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,791
- I THINK SO.

411
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,541
- THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

412
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,375
OKAY, WE'D BETTER
HEAD BACK TO THE GUILD.

413
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,750
- WHAT?!
THAT'S THEIR HEADQUARTERS.

414
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,458
LET'S GET 'EM!

415
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,291
ERZA TOLD US TO RETREAT.

416
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,833
- 'CAUSE SHE'S A WIMP.

417
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,250
I'LL FACE THOSE GUYS
BY MYSELF IF I HAVE TO.

418
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,625
- BUT YOU SAW WHAT THEY DID
TO THE MASTER.

419
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,791
- EXACTLY.
THAT'S WHY I WANNA GET REVENGE!

420
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,708

TO FIGHT THEM ON YOUR OWN.

421
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,958
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
- I SAID YOU CAN'T! 

422
