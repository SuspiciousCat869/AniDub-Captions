something stuck to my head?

00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,750
Uh, what the heck is going on?

3
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,791
[CAPRICORN] We're
about to begin our contest.

4
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,500
What contest?

5
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:35,416
A quiz! Worthy of
a Zodiac Spirit!

6
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,458
A game show?

7
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:37,833
[CAPRICORN] I suppose.

8
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:39,500
Each contestant
will be presented

9
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:42,000
with a series of questions
they must answer.

10
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,541
There are ten in all.

11
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,333
Once the final score is tallied,

12
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,666
the winner will then be
granted complete freedom.

13
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,333
And the loser will suffer
a truly horrible fate.

14
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,833
Oh. I don't like
the sound of that.

15
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:56,500
But why are we playing
a trivia game?

16
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:59,291
Well, because I'm rather
fond of them, that's why.

17
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,833
Now then.

[AUDIENCE cheers]

21
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,791
Guess I have no choice
but to play.

22
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:46,583
Fine then.

23
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,541
Excellent, let's proceed.

[HEAVEN VOICE 208A] This doll
was a gift to Lucy Heartfilia

25
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:56,291

What'd she name it?

You're swift on the buzzer,

28
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,083
but are you accurate?

29
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,333
It seems like I was nervous
about this for no reason,

30
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,291
because this
game's super easy!

31
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,125
That doll's name was "Michelle"!

32

Mr. Capricorn!

00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,958
[CAPRICORN]
Lucy named her doll "Gonzales."

36
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,500
[HEAVEN VOICE 208A]
That is correct!

37
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,750
While the doll did eventually
come to be called Michelle,

38
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,708
this was not the name
it got from Lucy.

39
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,916
Upon receiving the doll
as a birthday present,

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,083
young Lucy could think
of no better name

41
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,000
--for it than Gonzales!

[CAPRICORN] Look at us.

51
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,291
Two perfect examples of what
to do and what not to do

52

when engaged
in a match of wits.

53

fun at all, is it?!

Piri, piri!

57
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:10,458
--Check it out.
--Her life has gone down!

58
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,708
[SCORPIO] I'm not
the only rule in this game.

59
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,333
Allow me to explain:
the lit symbols to your left

60
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,125
indicate your
current life total.

61
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,625
You've just lost one
out of four life points.

62
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,541
Now, should you lose
the remaining three,

63
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,750
you will lose this match
and pay the price.

64
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,083
What price?

65
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,500
The real fun of this game
is in devising varied,

66
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:31,166
unexpected strategies to
keep one's life points safe.

67
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,041
But, you'll agree that a game of
cards is most entertaining

68
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,583
when the stakes are high.

69
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:39,250
So... If you do lose, you'll be
added to my card collection.

70
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,708
[CANA] Fat chance, nerd!
I'll win your stupid game,

71
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:44,208
then you'll let me close your
gate like a good little spirit.

72
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,500
If you play as shrewdly
as you hand out insults

73
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,666
then I'd say the two of us are
in for a game to remember.

74
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,041
Now that our bets are placed,
I'll end my turn.

75
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,958
You may begin yours when ready.

76
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,625
I'd love to, but
where do I start?

77
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,375
I still don't get what
"I am the rules" means.

78
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,458
Plus these cards are blank.

79
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,833
Wait.

80
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:07,375
The game board we're standing on
is clearly magical.

81
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,916
When you placed your cards,

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,583
it looked like the Gemini
twins appeared in the flesh.

83
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,250
So you filled
your deck with friends.

84
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,208
then summoned them on the board.

85
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,916
Seems easy enough.

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,333
If you're going to play
with your friends,

87
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,291
then I'll stack the
deck with my own.

88
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,875
[CANA] So that's what you meant.

89
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,125
You aren't the rules
after all: I am!

90
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,750
I can make whatever
cards I want,

91
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,750
based on the people
that matter to me.

92
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,583
You catch on quickly,
don't you?

93
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,208
Card master indeed.

94
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,458
The game lets you combine
cards to form different attacks.

95
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,416
Well, that I'm
pretty much used to.

96
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,166
Let's get things moving.

97
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,375
First, my draw sequence.

98
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,125
Next up, my standby phase.

99
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,333
I summon my friends
Happy and Carla!

100
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,458
Aye, Sir!

101
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,083
Would you like us to rough
somebody up for you then?

102
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,291
Piri, piri.

103
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,000
Both of her friends
are kitty cats!

104
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,750
I think they're
called "Exceeds".

105
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,208
[CARLA] So you're the
ones we're fighting.

106
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,500
[HAPPY] Tough break for you,
cause I'm super strong!

107
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,791
[CANA] Those figures
aren't real, are they?

108
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:03,791
[SCORPIO]
They're illusions.

109
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,625
To give the game
some extra flavor.

110
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,500
Well, they're
extremely convincing.

111
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,000
I appreciate that.

112
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,791
[CANA] I deploy two Field Cards!

113
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,250
Face down!

114
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,958
[SCORPIO] You've never
even seen a field card flipped,

115
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,375
and yet you're deploying
your own! Amazing!

116
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,000
[GEMI &amp; MINI]
She's not bad.

117
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,541
[HAPPY] Uh, why's he shaking?

118
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,083
[CARLA] How would I know?

119
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,416
I love the tactics of
strategy card games

120
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,833
more than life itself.

121
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,666
So doing battle with a
player as masterful as you

122
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,250
gives me a thrill like no other.

123
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,833
[CANA] What a creeper.

124
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,416
All right! I'll start
my Battle sequence!

125
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,333
Get them, Happy!

126
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,541
[HAPPY] Aye, Sir!

127
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,875
[SCORPIO] I'll block
that attack with Gemi.

128
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,625
Sure hope he
doesn't beat me!

129
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,291
Happy Attack!

130
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,500
[GEMI grunts]

131
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,583
[CANA] Good work, Happy!
That's one down!

132
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,750
[SCORPIO] Destroyed cards
are sent to the spirit realm:

133
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,750
a trash zone, which generally
renders them unusable.

134
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,416
However...

135
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,708
Both of my Gemini
possess a special ability.

136
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,708
Whenever an allied
monster is destroyed,

137
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,958
I may replace it
with a field card!

138
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:02,750
I reveal "Celestial Punishment",
which summons Virgo the Maiden.

139
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,666
Summoning Virgo during
an opponents turn

140
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,791
triggers her ability to
resurrect a monster

141
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:07,916
from the spirit realm.

142
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,583
Are you glad to
be back, Gemi?

143
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:10,833
Of course I am!

144
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,208
No way! You can
actually do that?

145
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,791
And by the way,

146
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,416
summoning me also allows him to
draw five cards from his deck.

147
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,666
You're playing a lot of
cards on not your turn!

148
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,041
You seem flustered.

149
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,166
Which is precisely how
I like my opponents.

150
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,541
[CANA] Screw it. I end my turn.

151

[PISCES BOY screams]

[PISCES MOM]
Sweetie-pie, no!

153
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,666
You should teach him to speak
to his mother with respect.

154
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,541
Just who are you
to criticize?!

155
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,541
If I wanted parenting
advice from a demon,

156
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,083
I would've asked for it!

him, he'll treat you worse!

00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:47,041
We are the perfect picture
of what a family should be!

159
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,750
This one doubts
our bond, munchkin!

160
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,083
Let's show her what a
loving family can do!

161
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,333
[PISCES BOY]
Yeah, Whatever hag.

162
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:53,333
I guess I'll help you.

163
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,916
Why do you let him
talk like that?!

164
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,166
--[PISCES MOM] A mother.
--[PISCES BOY] And son's.

165
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,208
[BOTH] Forbidden embrace!

166
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,666
--Work it, sweet-pea!
--I love you, ma!

167
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,541
--[MIRAJANE] On second thought.
--[PISCES BOY grunts]]

168
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:05,875
[PISCES MOM gasps]

169
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,416
[MIRAJANE] It seems that
your indulgence is mutual.

170
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,041
[PISCES MOM] Unhand us!

171
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,625
[PISCES BOY screams]

172
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,458
[PISCES MOM screams]

173
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,125
That looked painful.

174
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,208
I'm sorry.

175
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,958
If I were you... I'd run.

176
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,041
[MIRAJANE] Look.

177
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,708
There's more to family
than indulgence.

178
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,708
You're meant to help
each other grow.

179
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,791
[PISCES BOY]
Take it back....

180
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,541
[PISCES MOM] Snookums...

181
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,666
[SCORPIO]
Finished already?

182
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,666
Then I'll start
my draw sequence!

183
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,541
Entering standby phase!

184
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,083
I'll send Mini to the spirit
realm in order to summon

185
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,916
Taurus, the golden bull!

186
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,541
[MINI] Bye, bye, brother.

187
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,250
[TAURUS]
Apologies, good Gemi.

188
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,583
Your partner's sacrifice
was a noble one.

189
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,166
I will strive to ensure
she did not fall in vain.

190
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,000
Aw! This bites!

191
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,958
[CANA] Sounds like there's
some dissension in the ranks!

192
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,416
I'm not too worried about it.

193
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,083
Entering battle phase!

194
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,958
Taurus! I want you to
Launch an attack!

195
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,250
[TAURUS] As you command.

196
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,750
Carla, block his attack!

197
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,000
He'll squish me!

198
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,291
Before damage resolves,
I'll flip a field card.

199
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,166
Activating, Maiden's Bond!

200
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,041
This card allows me to
special-summon a female friend

201
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,458
to give Carla some backup!

202
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,541
Look at that, I've got Carla's
best friend right here.

203
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:21,416
I summon Wendy!
The Dragon Slayer!

204
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,541
[TAURUS] Moo?

205
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:23,708
[WENDY] Sorry
that I took so long!

206
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,250
[CARLA] Glad you're here!

207
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,416
[CANA] Know what happens when a
Dragon Slayer and her Exceed

208
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,000
use Maiden's
bond together?

209
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,666
They get a bonus 100,000 attack!

210
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,375
Did you say 100,000?!

211
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,666
Oh, and I get to draw
three cards on top of that.

212
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,541
[SCORPIO growls]

213
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,250
[SCORPIO] Fine!

214
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,583
Then I'll sacrifice Gemi

215
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,333
in order to increase
Taurus' attack by 200,000!

216
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,166
[GEMI screams]

217
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,166
[TAURUS]
Now this is power!

218
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,291
How can you
sacrifice your friends?!

219
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,625
[SCORPIO]
Don't be so sentimental.

220
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,083
He was nothing but a pawn.

221
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,583
[CANA] Wendy! Carla!

222
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:52,583
[WENDY] We're on it!

223
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,791
[CARLA] We'll barbeque him!

224
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,291
[WENDY] We weep for Gemi.

225
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:59,125
He was too kind a spirit to
be sent to the spirit realm.

226
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,250
[CARLA] For every tear shed,
we'll gain 10,000 attack points.

227
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,291
Keep crying!

228
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,291
[TAURUS] What an
"offal" predicament!

229
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,000
How can I call
myself a gentleman

230
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,541
if I bring harm to a
maiden while she weeps?!

231
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,750
Wait? 500,000 attack?!

232
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,208
[WENDY] Sorry in advance.

233
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,416
[CANA] Take him out.

234
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,875
[BOTH] Tearful Maiden
Counter-blow!

235
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,125
[WENDY] Tearful Maiden
Counter-blow!

236
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,625
[CANA] Having fun yet?

237
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,541
[SCORPIO] I wouldn't pour
a victory drink if I were you!

238
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,583
Taurus' death was
a part of my plan.

239
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:22,833
[CANA] Yeah, right!

240
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,625
With him gone,
the field tilts in your favor.

241
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,541
That makes this the perfect time
for me to summon Libra,

242
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,166
the balance!

243
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,375
There must be balance
in all things.

244
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,500
[SCORPIO] Libra
makes for a fine equalizer.

245
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,333
When summoned, she
weighs her own attack

246
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,666
against that of an opponent's.

247
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,791
Whoever's weakest gets
sent to the spirit realm!

248
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,333
[LIBRA] I choose the cat!

249
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,625
[CARLA] Why's it always me?

250
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,958
[SCORPIO] When the scale
tips, the weakest one will rise.

251
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,750
[CARLA] That's just my luck!

252
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,000
--[CARLA screams]
--[LIBRA] I banish you!

253
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,333
Carla, no!

254
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,541
[CANA growls]

255
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,083
[LUCY screams]

256
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,833
[LUCY] Is that a
fricking spike pit?!

257
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:00,791
Not having it!

258
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,541
[LUCY grunts]

259
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:04,583
[LUCY] Way too close...

260
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,000
[VIRGO]
That was impressive.

261
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,041
But tell me, what'll
you do about...

262
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,166
...this.

263
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,208
--[rumbling]
--What?! Wait! Not the--!

264
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,875
[LUCY screams]

265
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:13,958
Please don't
crush me, Virgo!

266
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,833
I want to live,
can't we talk this out?

267
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,208
[WENDY sobs]

268
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,083
[CANA] Your tears
can't bring her back.

269
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,833
Nonetheless,
I'm grateful for them.

270
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,875
They give us a shot at revenge.

271
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,166
I Figured he'd
go after Carla.

272
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,791
Flipping the field card:
"Wendy's Tears!" Activate!

273
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:30,833
[SCORPIO moans]

274
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,333
To predict plays
that far in advance

275
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,083
you must've read me
like a street sign!

276
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,916
You weren't half this
good in my dreams!

277
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,666
I'm going to pretend
I didn't hear that

278
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,916
and use this card to
kick your creepy butt!

279
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,416
Activating Wendy's Tears
allows me to dual-summon

280
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,416
Gray Fullbuster
and Juvia Loxar!

281
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,583
Atta-girl.

282
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,000
I bet she summoned
the two of us together

283
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,125
because she knows that
we're an item, darling!

284
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,541
I'm going to need
you focused.

285
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,708
Sir!

286
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,375
[CANA] By the way,
it's still your turn.

287
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:54,791
Got anything else for me?

288
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,750
[SCORPIO] Nah, I think
I'll leave things as they are.

289
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,125
I end my turn.

290
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,833
[CANA] 'Bout time, too!

291
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,458
Cool, so first I draw a card.

292
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,208
And then I start
my standby phase.

293
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,666
I summon Lucy the
celestial wizard

294
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,291
and Erza Titania!

295
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,791
Just tell me
what to stab.

296
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:11,958
We're here to help!

297
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,541
Time for my
battle sequence!

298
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,750
Juvia, I need you
to take out Virgo.

299
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:16,833
[JUVIA] Right!

300
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,041
[CANA] She and
Gray're dual-summons.

301
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,666
So as long as he's on the field,

302
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,125
her attack will be
five times its usual.

303
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,375
Not good...

304
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,000
We're even more connected
than before, Gray!

305
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,500
I can feel your power
surging inside me!

306
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,166
[SCORPIO] By the way.
Virgo has one other ability.

307
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,625
She can temporarily
summon an ally at any point

308
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,541
during one of my
opponent's attacks.

309
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,208
[CANA] Sounds pretty
frigging cheap to me!

310
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,916
[SCORPIO]
I special summon Capricorn!

311
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,708
Take the hit!

312
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,750
This should be refreshing!

313
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:41,833
[JUVIA yells]

314
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,666
I've taken the hit, sir.

315
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,250
You make a fine shield
and I appreciate your efforts.

316
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,083
Let's see you
pull it off twice.

317
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,875
You're up next, Erza,
run them through!

318
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,458
As you wish.

319
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,833
[CANA] Erza's ability allows me
to take any requip field card

320
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,583
that I have in hand and
put it directly on her

321
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:56,708
when she attacks.

322
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,000
Requip!

323
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,541
Heaven's Wheel Armor!

324
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,625
[CANA] She has 60,000 Attack!

325
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,125
I'll just block with Virgo.

326
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,541
[CANA] Got something
up your sleeve,

327
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,041
or do you just suck at math?

328
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,500
Why bother stuffing my sleeves
when I have a field card?

329
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,958
I activate: "Cruel Punishment"

330
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:13,958
[ERZA] What's this?!

331
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,041
Erza, no!

332
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,958
It's my worst nightmare!

333
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,625
I wasn't any help at all!

334
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,583
[SCORPIO] Cards
sent to the spirit realm

335
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:25,041
via punishment effects,
are completely untouchable.

336
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,666
So there's no point
in trying to save her.

337
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,750
[CANA] There's some
smug on your face.

338
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,833
Don't worry though.
it wipes right off.

339
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,041
Could you help him
out with that, Lucy?

340
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,500
Leave it to me!

341
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,541
[CANA] Take a life point!
You've got this!

342
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:45,708
[LUCY] I won't let you down!

343
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,416
[SCORPIO]
I'll block with Libra!

344
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,583
[LIBRA] Where we lack
balance, there is chaos.

345
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,166
Attacking triggers
Lucy's best ability!

346
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,375
If I have a celestial spirit
card in my hand,

347
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,000
then I can play it!

348
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:59,083
Leo the Lion! I summon you!

349
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:02,000
Intriguing. You've summoned
a spirit of your own.

350
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,625
But as he was a
special summon,

351
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,666
I can weigh his strength
against Libra's.

352
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,875
You better not be making
up crap as you go!

353
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,541
[SCORPIO]
Responding to such an accusation

354
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:10,958
would be beneath me.

355
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,416
Now then, let's see if your Leo
can match the strength

356
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,875
of an Eclipse Spirit.

357
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,291
[LIBRA] Uh-oh.

358
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,875
[LOKE] Sorry, babe!
Rules of the game!

359
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,000
Symmetry lost!

360
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,416
Correct me if
I'm wrong here,

361
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,125
but it looks like
you're out of blockers.

362
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,541
You are correct, indeed.

363
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,458
I'll just have to take
the damage, then.

364
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,708
--[LUCY] This one's for Erza!
--[SCORPIO yells]

365
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,958
[SCORPIO sighs]

366
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,833
[CANA] Why do you look
so damn pleased?

367
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,583
[SCORPIO] You're amazing.
In all the time I've played,

368
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,458
you're the very first player
to take one of my life points.

369
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:41,750
[CANA] You're welcome?

370
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,000
[SCORPIO] Thank you.

371
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,750
This card can only be
played when I lose life.

372
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,208
You'll be the first to see it.

373
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,625
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

374
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,916
[SCORPIO] I flash-deploy
and activate a field card:

375
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,916
"Twelve Constellations"!

376
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,500
Don't bother asking
what it does,

377
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:56,833
you'll have to wait and see.

378
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,500
Fine, then go ahead
and show me.

379
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,166
[SCORPIO]
All in good time.

380
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,833
Entering Draw Sequence.

381
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,000
Begin standby sequence.

382
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,833
I summon Sagittarius!
The Archer!

383
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:10,958
[SCORPIO] Now
for the battle sequence.

384
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,750
[CANA] That weird
field card you played.

385
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,291
Going to use it or not?

386
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,458
[SCORPIO]
Give her the whip, Virgo.

387
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:16,958
[VIRGO]
She has been naughty.

388
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,375
[CANA] And here I thought
it was annoying

389
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,166
when you only wanted
to talk to me.

390
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,625
Lucy, block the attack!

391
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,458
[LUCY] No problem!
Uh, yeah I take that back.

392
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:25,791
[CANA] What's wrong?

393
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,458
[SCORPIO] Just another
one of Virgo's abilities.

394
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,125
When she attacks, she can
also root an opposing monster

395
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,375
to the ground.

396
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,375
Which makes it a bit
tough for them to block.

397
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,458
[CANA] Dammit!

398
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,416
[VIRGO] Spare the rod,
spoil the human!

399
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,791
He's got me
halfway down already.

400
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,083
[SCORPIO]
What's on your mind?

401
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,500
Were you thinking about

402
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,750
how suddenly I took what
small advantage you'd gained?

403
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,333
You can tell me. C'mon.

404
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,875
[CANA] Can it, weirdo!

405
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,333
Once you're in
a tough position,

406
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,875
it's quite hard
to bounce back.

407
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,958
You get stressed,
start making mistakes.

408
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,541
That tight spot will
get even tighter

409
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,833
and you'll lose your
mind to panic.

410
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,833
This has been a great
talk, but could you shut up

411
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,083
and play something?

412
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,375
Now my "Twelve Constellations"
can take effect.

413
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,291
This card will hit you with no
less than twelve blasts of magic

414
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,125
before my turn can end.

415
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,208
[CANA] Twelve?!
Did I hear that right?

416
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,291
[SCORPIO] Yeah, but...
Look, I know twelve seems

417
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,875
like more attacks
than anyone needs,

418
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,750
but if you keep in
mind they don't stop

419
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,291
even once you're beat, you can't
quite call the effort wasted.

420
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,708
[CANA] Geez! Overkill much?

421
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,833
Hey, why take a risk
if I don't have to?

422
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,708
You ready for the first one?

423
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:24,916
[CANA] Block it, Juvia!

424
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,875
[JUVIA] Sure, I'm all over it!

425
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,083
[JUVIA screams]

426
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,625
And here comes
number two.

427
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:33,833
Lucy, please!

428
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:34,958
[LUCY] I'll do my best.

429
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,583
[LUCY screams]

430
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,625
Well, that sucks.
I'm sorry, girls...

431
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,083
It's on now!

432
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,041
[CANCER] Shake me down,
I want to prance!

433
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,458
I got to move.
It's time to dance!

434
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:52,541
Oh yeah!

435
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,041
[GRAY] The heck have I done?

436
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,791
Anything but this
I could've dealt with.

437
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:57,916
[CANCER]
Don't just stand there!

438
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,708
Show me your moves, man!

439
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,958
Say what? What do
you mean by "my moves"?

440
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,208
[CANCER]
You know what I mean.

441
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,666
Your hot boogie moves!
You've got them inside!

442
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,083
So let them come play!

443
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,708
[GRAY] That isn't helpful!

444
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:11,625
Twelve Constellations.
Attack three inbound.

445
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,500
[CANA]
Just two life points left...

446
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,833
Hey, wait! I forgot about that.

447
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,583
Let it come. I don't
plan to block it.

448
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,541
You hatch some
desperate plan?

449
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,916
I'm down to my last life.
And as a result of that,

450
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,833
I can now play the Field Card:
Mavis' Patience!

451
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:33,916
[SCORPIO] Ooh.

452
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,333
After sitting through a
countless number

453
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,833
of bathroom emergencies,
the first master of Fairy Tail

454
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,916
became the poster
child for endurance.

455
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,458
Not only can
she block you,

456
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,833
she ends your turn
when summoned!

457
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,750
[SCORPIO] A much better
plan than I expected.

458
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,583
I'll pass my turn then.

459
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,708
Lucky thing that I
remembered.

460
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,541
It's not that
uncommon to lose track

461
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,208
of the effects your
deck can have.

462
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,125
But it certainly seemed
to have worked out well

463
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,583
for you this time.

464
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,833
You've turned a game of cat
and mouse into a dogfight!

465
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,708
And you did it
with a single move!

466
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,125
[CANA] I told you that
you're weird, right?

467
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,875
Beginning my
standby sequence.

468
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,875
I'll summon a pair of Happys!

469
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,166
[BOTH] Aye, Sir!

470
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,708
Why are there more of me?

471
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,166
[SCORPIO] Goodness.
Triple stacks are pretty rare.

472
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,500
[CANA] Happy's special ability
triggers.

473
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,583
If there are three Happys
on the field at once,

474
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,916
then they all get sent
to the spirit realm.

475
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,875
Wait! I want to get
to know myself!

476
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,208
[SCORPIO] What ability?
You're sacrificing them.

477
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:24,958
[HAPPYS] But I thought
we were friends!

478
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,791
[CANA] Now that I've sacrificed
all three of my Happys...

479
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,250
I can summon Natsu,
the dragon slayer!

480
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,583
I'm all fired up!

481
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,000
After that, I'll flip one
of my field cards.

482
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,291
Activating:
"Gray gets half-naked."

483
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,291
[GRAY] Hell yeah!

484
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,083
Now that's a good card!

485
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,875
[CANA] A shirtless Gray
gains 60,000 attack!

486
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,416
I place one field card
face down.

487
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,541
And then I'll start
my battle sequence.

488
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,750
Since Natsu and Gray
both have the same target,

489
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,166
they can combine their attacks!

490
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,708
--[GRAY] Sounds good.
--[NATSU] Oh yeah!

491
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,500
Break the Twelve
Constellations!

492
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,291
[GRAY &amp; NATSU yell]

493
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,916
[CANA] You know, that
card really wasn't so bad.

494
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,875
[SCORPIO] It's rather
funny you should say so.

495
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,458
Because by destroying my
"Twelve Constellations"

496
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,083
you've triggered
its final ability.

497
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,583
I need only discard two cards.

498
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,083
And then I can perform
a Golden Summons.

499
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:14,333
Leo the Lion!

500
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,166
Women are just the worst.

501
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,291
Well, damn. Never thought
I'd hear myself say that.

502
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,500
Beat him down, will you?

503
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:23,333
This "Loke" looks frail.
I'll block with Leo.

504
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,791
I'll destroy him.

505
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,458
[CANA] C'mon, Loke!
Make me proud!

506
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,208
[LOKE grunts]

507
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,041
[SCORPIO] It seems that
my Leo is the superior warrior.

508
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,250
[NATSU &amp; GRAY] Loke!

509
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,541
[LOKE] Astounding.
Was I really that weak?!

510
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:35,833
I'm sorry, Loke...

511
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,333
I'll try to give your
sacrifice some meaning.

512
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,208
Come to think of it, one of my
field cards needs a death.

513
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,708
I'll flip and activate:
"Call from the Spirit Realm"

514
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,041
as Loke passes through the gate!

515
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,291
[SCORPIO] A resurrection?

516
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,083
[CANA] One soul in
and one soul out!

517
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,458
I special summon Happy
from the spirit realm!

518
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,083
[HAPPY] Aye, Sir!
I'm back in business!

519
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:57,083
[CANA] There's more. With Happy
and Natsu on the same field,

520
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,750
I can fuse the
two fairies into one!

521
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:03,125
This brings forth my one
and only ultra-combo Wizard.

522
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,625
Winged Nappy Dragneel!

523
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,083
[NATSU] Aye, Sir!

524
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,333
[LOKE] It's so awkward.

525
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,083
[SAGITTARIUS]
It's Dragneel as a flying cat,

526
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,250
what'd you expect?

527
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,833
[SCORPIO]
Pretty much anything but that.

528
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,666
Okay, Winged Nappy Dragneel,
show them how you fight!

529
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,750
I'll block him
with Sagittarius.

530
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:17,708
[SAGITTARIUS] Targeting!

531
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,166
[NATSU] Woo-hoo!

532
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,750
Screw getting' carried,
I can fly on my own!

533
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,541
[NATSU grunts]

534
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:24,416
[NATSU] No thanks!

535
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,916
He dodged it?

536
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,208
Course he did! Why else would
I combine Natsu and Happy?

537
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,166
An unblockable pyro
hits his mark!

538
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,041
--[NATSU] Aye, Sir!
--[SCORPIO grunts]

539
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,416
[CANA] Either find
a way to stop him,

540
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,500
or enjoy your last two turns.

541
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,208
How'd I let
this happen?

542
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,166
I'll end my turn.
But the clock's ticking.

543
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:45,000
[SCORPIO] That was
good. But I can still do better.

544
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,500
I'll summon a spirit:
Aries the ram!

545
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,166
[ARIES] 'Bout time you
got me in on some action!

546
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,666
I've been bored as hell!

547
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,875
Say you're sorry!

548
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,416
[NATSU] And what if I don't?!

549
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,500
To start my battle sequence,
I'll attack with Sagittarius!

550
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:57,666
I shan't miss!

551
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,250
[CANA] Block him
with your ice, Gray!

552
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,750
[GRAY] Let's see him
shoot through this!

553
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:01,958
[GRAY grunts]

554
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,166
Gray, no!

555
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,458
Next, I'll activate
this field card.

556
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,916
Flames of Darkness.

557
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,916
[LOKE]
Such unthinkable power!

558
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,416
[SCORPIO] Put on Leo,
it grants five million attack.

559
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,041
Did you say million?!

560
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,166
Nappy Dragneel!

561
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,000
You have to try and block him!

562
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,750
[NATSU growls]

563
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,333
[NATSU grunts]

564
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,625
[HAPPY screams]

565
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,458
Look, I'm back
to four lives.

566
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:25,875
[CANA] What?! How?!

567
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,083
[SCORPIO]
It's a lesser-known effect

568
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,458
of my dark flame combo.

569
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,750
If the augmented spirit
can split a fused wizard,

570
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,416
then I get my lives back.

571
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,750
--[CANA growls]
--There, there.

572
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,333
You played the game well.
It just didn't matter.

573
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:37,916
Go on, Aries, put her down.

574
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,666
Sure thing!
I'll make her cry too!

575
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,000
I can still win this.

576
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,041
When my last life point
is attacked head on,

577
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,000
I can use an
extra-special summon!

578
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:49,208
The only catch is that
he be an S-Class wizard.

579
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,125
[CANA]
I special-summon my father,

580
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:57,750
Gildarts Clive:
the Ace of Fairy Tail!

581
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,541
Hey, darling.

582
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:02,791
Too cool! She just baited me
into rescuing her!

583
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,500
[GILDARTS] It's a rough
situation. But even so.

584
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,708
I just wanted to say how
glad I am that you called,

585
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,666
and how much I love to
hear you call me "Father".

586
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,583
I mean, "Daddy" would trump
that, but still, I'm very happy!

587
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,458
I'd call you "Daddy" if you
hadn't ditched Mom, you jerk.

588
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:18,166
Try to take this seriously.

589
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,958
[GILDARTS] Hey.
If it's serious for you,

590
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,458
then I will do
whatever it takes.

591
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:27,958
Come on, we need
to get moving!

592
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,208
Yes, but where to?

593
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,583
It's pretty clear what
we need to do next.

594
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,666
[NATSU] Yup. We've
got to stop Loke

595
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:37,208
And guess what? He's got
a whole world to himself.

596
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:39,291
First, we're going
to sneak in there.

597
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:42,125
Then we're going to find him
and beat him senseless!

598
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,666
[HAPPY] ♪ Ba-da-ba-ba, hey! ♪

599
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,291
So. What do you
think of my moves?

600
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:17,875
[NATSU] Never seen
someone flail like that.

601
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:18,583
Did it hurt?

602
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,041
[HAPPY] Of course not!

603
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,083
And that was not flailing,
it was a dance, you got it?

604
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,916
[NATSU] So... like
a seizure-dance?

605
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,625
[HAPPY] My talents
are wasted on you...

606
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:26,541
[NATSU] One more time!

607
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:28,041
[HAPPY] Fine, but focus!

608
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:30,083
Back spin! Half turn!
Double-axel!

609
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:31,083
So?

610
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:33,416
[NATSU] Still just flailing.

611
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,708
[NATSU &amp; HAPPY] Next time:
Gray vs. Cancer!

612
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:37,166
Dance Battle!

613
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,416
[NATSU] Your legs are too
stubby for dancing, come on.

614
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,291
[HAPPY] You're so rude!
