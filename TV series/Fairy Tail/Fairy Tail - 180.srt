00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:25,416
[CROWD cheering]

2
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,208
[CHAPATI] Fairy Tail's
Gray Fullbuster has won

3
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,333
the impromptu Maker
magic showdown!

4
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,375
Rufus snatched the
top spot from Gray

5
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,250
during our first game, Hidden.

6
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:36,666
I guess revenge really
is a dish best served cold!

7
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,666
[MATO stuttering]

8
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,208
[MATO] I'm too
shocked for words!

9
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,916
Yeah, it was a real
doozy of a battle!

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,875
Gray toughed it out
and came out on top.

11
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,166
That's Fairy Tail!

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,333
[CHAPATI] And, as a result,

13
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,833
Fairy Tail gains
another valuable point!

14
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,375
Beautiful! Way to
sock it to him, Gray!

15
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:54,166
It would have been quicker
if he'd gone all out first.

16
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,625
He fought wonderfully!

17
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:58,250
Looks like you were right
all along, First Master.

18
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:01,708
Sometimes emotions can
exceed all calculation.

19
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:04,750
[MAVIS] Firm belief
in certain victory.

20
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:07,000
Without that, all the
calculations in the world

21
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,250
won't help you win.

22
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,958
I simply bet everything
on his emotions.

23
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,666
When push came to shove,
I think Gray's inner strength

24
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,750
was far superior to Rufus's.

25
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,625
[MAKAROV] All of their
inner strengths will have

26
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:18,833
to be superior.

27
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:21,458
For Natsu and the rest
of his team as well.

28
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,791
This battle has
only just begun!

29
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,000
Now, let's show the
world that Fairy Tail

30
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:30,833
is the most powerful guild...
in all of Fiore!

31
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,000
[CHAPATI] Now, then!

32
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,750
Let's have a look at
the current scoreboard!

33
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,500
[CHAPATI] In first place
is the Fairy Tail guild,

34
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:09,916
with fifty points!

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,916
Five members remain: one leader
and four normal members!

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,375
[MATO] Sabertooth is in second
place with forty-nine points!

37
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:20,791
Fairy Tail only got one point
for defeating Rufus which

38
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,875
means that the
team's leader must

39
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,083
be one of their three
remaining members!

40
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,291
[YAJIMA] Interestingly
enough, Lamia Scale

41
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,666
is also in second place.

42
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,875
They have their leader
and two regular members

43
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,916
left on the field.

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,166
[CHAPATI] And in fourth
place we have Mermaid Heel,

45
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,500
with forty-three points.

46
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,625
Only their leader and
one normal member remain.

47
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,750
It's a close game,
but Fairy Tail's

48
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,500
really dominating out there.

49
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,333
[YAJIMA] They're the
only group that still has

50
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,750
all its members.

51
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,208
[MATO] Sure, Fairy Tail
has a serious advantage,

52
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,416
but can they
utilize it?

53
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,291
[HAPPY] The Hungry Wolf Knights!

54
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,500
[OLGA] So Rufus went
and got himself beat.

55
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,333
That's fine by me.

56
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:03,500
With him out
of the way,

57
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:06,458
I'll get more prey
all to myself.

58
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,666
[ROGUE] Fairy Tail
is truly formidable...

59
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,750
But I don't care.

60
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,541
Gajeel... Until I
beat you on my own,

61
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,583
I refuse to be
defeated by anyone else.

62
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,083
[CROWD cheering]

63
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,958
[FROSCH] Poor Rufus...

64
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,500
So, will Sabertooth crumble,

65
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,750
consigned to the
pages of history?

66
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,833
Or will we survive?

67
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,791
It's up to you, Sting.

68
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:36,041
Only your strength can
carry us through the day.

69
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:40,041
Whatever you choose,
I'm sure it'll be interesting.

70
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,791
[STING] Lector...

71
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,416
[MALE SABERTOOTH A] No way...

72
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,041
[MALE SABERTOOTH B]
He took down Master Jiemma!

73
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,791
[MALE SABERTOOTH A]
What are we supposed to do?!

74
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,375
Stay close to me...

75
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:58,500
Mark my words, Sting.
You will pay. I swear it!

76
00:04:58,583 --> 00:04:59,875
[MINERVA] I doubt that...

77
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,250
Your reign of terror
ends here, Father.

78
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,375
And not a moment too soon.

79
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,750
Don't worry
about your seat;

80
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,708
it will be filled
by someone worthy.

81
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,750
Since he's beaten you, I believe
Sting should have the honor.

82
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:14,458
She thinks Sting
should be our new Master?

83
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,625
--[STING] I can't!
--[JIEMMA] Minerva!

84
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,541
You insolent wench!
How dare you--!

85
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,083
What's your mantra?

86
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,416
"Sabertooth has
no room for losers."

87
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,333
Or is there suddenly an
exception to that rule?

88
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,875
[JIEMMA growls]

89
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:33,166
Look, Sting. This is your power.
The power of raging emotions!

90
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,375
It's the very advantage
Natsu had over you.

91
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,291
I'm not sure
that I understand.

92
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,291
It seems you
were influenced by

93
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:43,333
my father's dogmatic
views on power.

94
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:47,166
"Friends are unnecessary.
Strength is everything."

95
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,083
But, deep down,
you're different.

96
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:52,583
Your feelings for Lector
are what give you strength.

97
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,250
His power lies...
in his emotions?

98
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,708
What does she mean?

99
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,083
[MINERVA] Rejoice.
That strength is yours

100
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,833
to cultivate,
however you see fit.

101
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,583
You can even surpass Natsu now.

102
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,666
I'm sorry. But, I
don't think I can.

103
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,041
Don't worry, Sting.
Your Lector's alive and well.

104
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,125
[STING] What?

105
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,458
[MINERVA] It may have
looked like my father's magic

106
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,333
disintegrated him, but
he was just teleported.

107
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:24,250
He's probably shaken,
but he's safe nonetheless.

108
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,041
You mean it, M'lady?!
He's still alive?

109
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,541
Lector didn't
really go bye-bye?

110
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:30,666
That's right.

111
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,833
[STING] Thank you!.

112
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,791
Thank you for keeping
him safe, M'lady!.

113
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:37,250
You can bring him
back now. Thank you.

114
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,000
[MINERVA] Don't be naïve.

115
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,041
You'll see your
dear Lector again,

116
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,791
but only after we've won
the Grand Magic Games.

117
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,666
[STING] What are
you saying, M'lady?!

118
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,208
Please, stop! Bring
Lector back now!

119
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,958
Why are you doing this to me?!

120
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,750
You should be thankful
I'm not like my father.

121
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,416
The Sabertooth guild is
still destined for greatness,

122
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,916
and I won't let
our status as the

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,583
best in Fiore
be taken from us.

124
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,625
Yes, you and Rogue
were defeated...

125
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:05,041
However, losing Lector seems
to have given you new strength.

126
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,833
In that respect, you could
say you've been reborn.

127
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,375
Surely you can
feel the difference.

128
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:13,166
Your sense of loss
turned into power...

129
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,208
One strong enough
to leave my father in

130
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,583
a helpless heap
on the floor.

131
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,000
But If we're to survive,
you must show the world

132
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,375
your new-found strength.

133
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:24,833
Only then will our
guild's reign be secure.

134
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,041
[MINERVA] Oh, and before
you get it in your head

135
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,708
to blow a hole through me...

136
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,250
Remember that
Lector's life can still

137
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,791
come to an end if I will it.

138
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,541
[STING] M'lady...

139
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,875
If I win. you'll return
Lector unharmed?

140
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,000
[MINERVA chuckles]

141
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,500
That's right. Just
win the games.

142
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:48,708
Use those feelings to crush
our enemies for good.

143
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:52,250
[STING] All right.
I'll win this for Lector.

144
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,125
Count on it.

145
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,041
Awesome! We're
back in first place!

146
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,541
If they can keep this up,
we'll win for sure!

147
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:02,416
[MACAO] Cool it.
We're not out of the woods yet.

148
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,500
[WAKABA] Sabertooth still has
four members in peak condition.

149
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,708
Plus, Lyon and Jura
are out there.

150
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,333
[MACAO] Yup We're just
gettin' to the hard part.

151
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,041
I'm starting to
get worried about

152
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,500
Natsu and the others.

153
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:16,458
Yes, they do seem to be
taking awhile, don't they?

154
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,125
[MAVIS] Unfortunately...

155
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,083
I think it's safe to assume
that something's gone wrong...

156
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,208
[LUCY] Get up! Natsu!

157
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,833
Pull yourself together!

158
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,125
[WENDY] He's not moving!

159
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,875
[MIRAJANE] Can you do
anything for him, Wendy?

160
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,458
I've tried everything.
Whatever's wrong with him,

161
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,083
I don't think I can help.
I'm so sorry!

162
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,333
If only I knew more healing
magic he wouldn't

163
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,333
be suffering like this!

164
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,750
Aw, come on,
don't blame yourself.

165
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,166
You hear that, Natsu?
You made Wendy cry.

166
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,708
I hope you're happy!

167
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,041
[NATSU] I can't help it...

168
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,750
If I don't get some food
in me, I might keel over.

169
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,583
Somehow I doubt we'll find
anything worth munching on.

170
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,916
It won't be long before
we're part of the scenery.

171
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,291
Thanks for the
optimism, fur ball!

172
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,458
We're back!

173
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,166
[NATSU] Any luck, Happy?

174
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,833
[HAPPY] No, the ceiling's
completely blocked, too.

175
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,958
[CARLA] There doesn't seem
to be any way out of here.

176
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:10,000
[NATSU] Man, this sucks!
And after we've made it so far.

177
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,916
We came in as jail breakers
and now we're inmates.

178
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,500
[WENDY] It's kind of pathetic.

179
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,625
[LUCY] Geez, my feet are killing
me. How big is this place?

180
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,958
Well, I've only heard
rumors from the guards, but,

181
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,666
I believe it's centered
below the castle,

182
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,750
and is roughly ten times
larger than all of Crocus.

183
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,666
[LUCY] I just had to ask...

184
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,708
I wish we had the
foresight to draw a map

185
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,375
of the place while we
were looking around.

186
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:32,708
By the way, Natsu,

187
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,708
weren't you supposed to be
in the tournament today?

188
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,000
I had to come
rescue you, dummy.

189
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,125
[HAPPY] He was so gung-ho
about saving you,

190
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,416
he wouldn't listen to reason.

191
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,666
An-y-way...

192
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,916
Aw, how sweet, I didn't
know you cared so much.

193
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,416
You know,
it's kinda funny.

194
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,541
Even though we're in
a hopeless situation,

195
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,375
I feel at ease when
I'm around you all.

196
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,083
That's what happens
when you're with friends.

197
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,541
Neat, huh?

198
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,583
Yes, it is...

199
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,250
[NATSU] Oh, uh.
just so you know.

200
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,208
I totally haven't forgotten
your name or anything.

201
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,208
[YUKINO] It's Yukino.
Please, don't worry about it...

202
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,833
But, if you don't mind...

203
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,708
There is something that I've
been meaning to thank you for.

204
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,125
What's that?

205
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,666
The way you
stood up for me.

206
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,041
Lucy told me all about it.

207
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,041
[YUKINO] She said that
when you heard why

208
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,083
I was kicked out of Sabertooth.

209
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,333
You stormed Crocus
Gardens and took on

210
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,208
the guild all by yourself.

211
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,708
Oh, that? It was
nothin'! No biggie!

212
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,291
That's Natsu-ese for
"I don't remember squat!"

213
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,291
You forget way too fast.

214
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,708
[NATSU] Get off my case!

215
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:30,958
By the way, I'm
sorry for draggin'

216
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,458
your pal into this mess.

217
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,416
Have you known
Arm-crazy-ohs long?

218
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,583
His name is "Arcadios"!

219
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,500
[YUKINO] Until now, my entire
world revolved around being

220
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,500
a member of Sabertooth; I had
nothing after I was kicked out.

221
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,958
Even now, I'm only
working for the royal army

222
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,250
on a temporary basis.

223
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,708
[LUCY] She doesn't
have anywhere to go,

224
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,666
not even a place to call home.

225
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,041
Her parents are gone,
and her sister went missing

226
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,708
when she was little.

227
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:54,583
[MIRAJANE] Oh...

228
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,541
That's rough.

229
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,791
Still, when I heard
that you fought for me,

230
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,333
I felt happiness that
I can't even describe...

231
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,666
It really meant the world
to me. Thank you so much.

232
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,833
[NATSU yells]

233
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,833
There's really no
need to be so formal.

234
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,625
For real; he'll just forget
about it all over again.

235
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,083
Yukino's
a decent girl.

236
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,458
Loyalty and gratitude
are hard to come by.

237
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,958
Next thing you know,
Lily's gonna

238
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,458
be popping the que-stion!

239
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,875
Do you and I need to have
another private talk, Happy?

240
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,666
Sorry, I was just kidding!
Stop with the angry face!

241
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,000
[MIRAJANE] This is nuts!

242
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,583
Is it just me, or does she
look a lot like Lisanna?

243
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,125
[LUCY] Well, now
that you mention it...

244
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,458
Lisanna? Who's that?

245
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,833
[MIRAJANE giggles]

246
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,916
She's my little sister.

247
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,375
[YUKINO gasps]

248
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:46,041
[far-off rumbling]

249
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:46,958
[NATSU sniffs]

250
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,291
Smell that?

251
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,125
It feels like there's
a new flow of air in here.

252
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,666
It could mean
there's an exit!

253
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,125
We'll go and
take a look!

254
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,708
Do you think that shaking
caused a cave-in somewhere?

255
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,125
We can only hope.

256
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,291
Why is this scent so familiar?

257
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,000
[CARLA] Hey guys, there's
an opening over here

258
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,500
that I think we can
squeeze through!

259
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,958
[HAPPY] Good job!
Freedom, here we come!

260
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,708
[PANTHERLILY] This seems
less like a passageway

261
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,250
and more like melted rock.

262
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,708
[WENDY] It's certainly
a tight fit.

263
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:13,958
Yeah, you're not kidding.

264
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,791
Think you can
manage it, Yukino?

265
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,083
Yes, but it'll
take a second.

266
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,166
[HAPPY] You can do it, Natsu!

267
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,125
[WENDY grunting]

268
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:21,875
[NATSU yells]

269
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,791
[WENDY yells]

270
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,375
Can I get a
little help here?

271
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,833
What? Too many
late night snacks?

272
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,125
[LUCY] If you're
gonna be a jerk,

273
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,166
at least be a useful
one and help me!

274
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,125
[NATSU grunting]

275

--[LUCY stuttering]
--[YUKINO] Oh my...

276
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,125
I swear It's not
what it looks like!

277
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,708
Someone's here!
I think they might be hurt!

278
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,750
[BOTH gasp]

279
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,000
[YUKINO] Colonel Arcadios?!

280
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,250
[NATSU] Ah-ha! So
that smell was Crazy-toes!

281
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,750
[PANTHERLILY] She
just said his name.

282
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,708
[NATSU] Hey, you
alright? Helloooo?

283
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:49,958
The white knight...

284
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,541
He sure picked a strange
place to take a cat-nap.

285
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:53,625
But how'd he get here?

286
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,291
Was he tossed in
with the rest of us?

287
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,833
[YUKINO] A fall wouldn't
explain these injuries.

288
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,416
[ARCADIOS groans]

289
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,041
Run away...

290
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,958
[ALL gasp]

291
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,708
[YUKINO] Colonel Arcadios!
What happened to you?!

292
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,791
[WENDY] Hold still,
I'll heal you.

293
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:19,541
No, forget about me.
You have to get out of here!

294
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:23,166
Pop go... the crim'nals!

295
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,625
[ALL scream]

296
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:27,916
What is that?

297
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,916
It's acid!

298
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,416
It's eating the
ground away!

299
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,125
Is that what made
the opening for us?

300
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,875
[MAN 2] My first
catch of the day!

301
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,291
And she's a beaut!
What a haul!

302

[ALL screaming]

303

[HAPPY grunting]

304
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,500
[LUCY] So much ow...

305
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,375
[NATSU] Who are these guys?!

306
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,583
[MIRAJANE] What is that?

307
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,250
[YUKINO] Confetti?

308
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,375
[YUKINO] I think they
attacked Arcadios!

309
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,666
[ARCADIOS] Get out
of here! You're in danger!

310
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,166
Why, old man? Do you
know who they are?

311
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,833
[ARCADIOS] They're an
independent squad that

312
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:12,125
serves the Fiore Kingdom
from the shadows...

313
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:15,500
Ruthless, blood-thirsty
executioners

314
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,208
[LEADER] Hungry Wolf Knights.
Commence Operation

315
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,416
Fifteen-hundred.

316
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,000
They're Executioners?

317
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,958
They don't exactly
look the part.

318
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,375
Trust me, they're very
good at their jobs.

319
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,791
If the rumors are true,

320
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,041
then we're facing some
relentless hunters.

321
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,666
A group of royal
execution machines.

322
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,916
The Hungry Wolf Knights!

323
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,250
They're the reason
it's impossible

324
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,791
to leave this cursed
place... Alive, anyway.

325
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,875
[LEADER] By the authority
granted to us by the

326
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,583
Kingdom of Fiore,
we, The Hungry Wolf Knights,

327
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,208
will now carry out
your sentence.

328
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,375
[NATSU snickering]

329
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,000
Natsu?

330
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,500
[NATSU laughing]

331
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,083
This really isn't a good
time to go cuckoo.

332
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,625
[NATSU] Oh, sorry, my bad!
But, can you blame me?

333
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,041
I mean, just look at these guys!

334
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,875
[LUCY] Yeah, I get
what you're saying...

335
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,708
[WENDY] None of their outfits
really say "Knight" to me.

336
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:07,958
[NATSU] Especially, him!

337
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,291
Shucks...

338
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,208
That's a good point.
Usually you'd expect a group

339
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,500
of knights to dress in
the same uniforms.

340
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,458
Where are your helmets
and suits of armor?

341
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,291
Haulin' armor
ain't our style.

342
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,458
We're a secret squad, so we
gottta stay under cover.

343
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,458
If we gussied up in armor,
we wouldn't be secret no more.

344
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,916
Not that your fashion
lessons aren't interesting,

345
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,291
but I've got a real achin'
to punch your teeth in.

346
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:29,458
What the hell?!

347
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,541
If you're fishin'
for trouble...

348
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,458
You hooked yourself a whopper.

349
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,416
[ARCADIOS] Don't let their
appearances fool you!

350
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,000
Be very cautious
of their magic.

351
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,708
Make one wrong move
and you're as good as dead.

352
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:45,250
[NATSU] That's just the kind of
challenge I live for, old man.

353
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,291
This is awesome!

354
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,875
One epic brawl and our ticket
out of this dump is secure!

355
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,458
Lucky us.

356
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,625
Let's try to leave one conscious
so we can ask for directions.

357
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:55,833
The two of you
should get back

358
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,708
since you don't have
your keys with you.

359
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,333
We'll take care
of these guys.

360
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,791
Can't say I'm
a fan of this

361
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,625
"sitting on the
sidelines" garbage.

362
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,916
Careful, Arcadios.
Don't move too fast.

363
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,791
You two give Lucy
and Yukino a hand.

364
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,833
Aw c'mon, I can
help you fight!

365
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,583
Not such a good idea.

366
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,958
[PANTHERLILY] It's been
a while since I last fought.

367
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,375
I've sure missed it!

368
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,750
[PANTHERLILY giggles]

369
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,291
You must stop them.

370
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:22,083
Fighting the Wolf Knights isn't
just reckless, it's suicide.

371
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,833
[YUKINO] Please, everyone.
Be careful...

372
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,375
I'm all fired up now.

373
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,916
[LEADER] There are
plenty of miscreants

374
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,375
who did not fear
The Hungry Wolf Knights.

375
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,833
But they're all dead.

376
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,500
Your bones will join
theirs soon enough.

377
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,916
[GIRL 1] We'll start things
off. I hope you're ready.

378
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,375
What?! Just
the two of you?

379
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,791
In that case, I'll
take you on myself!

380
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,750
Guess they beat us
to the punch again.

381
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,291
That ain't fair!
I wanted to brawl!

382
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,000
Let's do it, Cosmos.

383
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,666
We'll dazzle them with
our beautiful dance, Kamika.

384
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,125
Now.

385
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,708
[KAMIKA] Paper Blizzard:
Red Dance!

386
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:03,208
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
Paper Magic won't work!

387
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,500
Not when I can
roast the lot of 'em!

388
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,000
[NATSU] Hey! What gives?!

389
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,583
How are they
not burning?!

390
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,208
My red paper is infused
with fire spirits.

391
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,875
Touch them if you dare!

392
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,500
Oh, I'm gonna
touch 'em alright!

393
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,041
Get in my belly, you beauti--

394
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,625
[NATSU screaming]

395
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,583
I'll make sure you
have your fill, then.

396
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:29,041
[NATSU screaming]

397
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,750
Hold on! I'm
coming to help you!

398
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,875
Sky Dragon Roar!

399
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,125
Nicely done, Wendy!

400
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,833
Way to huff and puff!

401
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,875
[NATSU] Alright then,
we'll go two-on-two.

402
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,458
I'll follow your
lead, Natsu.

403
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,291
[COSMOS] Beautiful...

404
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,583
Don't forget about us.

405
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,166
Hold on.

406
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,083
We should just keep our eyes on
the enemy's movements for now.

407
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,000
Let Wendy and Natsu handle this.

408
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,125
Pop!

409
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,541
Ready for this, Wendy?!

410
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,000
Let's go!

411
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,000
Fire Dragon Wing Attack!

412
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,916
Ohh... A couple of
Dragon Slayers?

413
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,750
Sky Dragon Crushing Fang!

414
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,750
And such lovely long hair.

415
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,458
You might wanna
pay attention!

416
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,166
You're the least
beautiful thing here!

417
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,000
Say what?

418
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,625
Shoot, this is boring.

419
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,375
They're just
toying with them.

420
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:22,333
--[NATSU] Fire Dragon... Roar!
--[WENDY] Sky Dragon... Roar!

421
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,416
Way to go!

422
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,083
Their teamwork is
truly spectacular.

423
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,708
[PANTHERLILY] I don't
sense them anymore.

424
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,125
Did we get 'em?!

425
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,875
[MIRAJANE] No. Not yet.

426
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,750
They're concealing
their magic power!

427
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,750
A plant bud with
red paper on it?

428
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,541
[NATSU &amp; WENDY grunt]

429
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,958
We are the truly
spectacular team.

430
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,500
Be good little
law-breakers

431
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,916
and take your punishment.

432
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,666
I think Miss "Poofy Pink Hat"
is using plant magic!

433
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,833
I don't get it.

434
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,750
How are they giving
us so much trouble?

435
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,625
Paper and plants
should be easy pickings

436
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,291
for wind and fire users.

437
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,583
[COSMOS giggles]

438
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,166
Think so,
pretty kitty?

439
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,791
We can put your theory
to the test, if you like.

440
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,250
What do you say, love?

441
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,458
Of course!

442
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,625
I still have plenty
of colors to show them.

443
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,791
[NATSU &amp; WENDY grunt]

444
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,000
[MIRAJANE] I can't see anything!

445
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,000
I didn't know paper
could be used like this!

446
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,041
[WENDY screams]

447
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,875
[COSMOS] I've got you now.

448
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:16,833
[WENDY screams]

449
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:17,958
Wendy!

450
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,416
[NATSU yells]

451
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,541
Take a moment and cool off
and you'll feel much better!

452
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,500
[NATSU] I've spent a
life-time fighting off

453
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,291
colder ice
attacks than this!.

454
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,833
I don't even feel it!

455
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,041
[NATSU yells]

456
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,541
[NATSU &amp; WENDY grunting]

457
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,083
[WENDY] Oh no!

458
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,708
[COSMOS] Your magic complements
mine beautifully, as always.

459
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,708
Darn it! I can't
move a muscle!

460
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,833
[WENDY] All of these
thorns are pricking me!

461
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,083
[KAMIKA] Two
lawbreakers captured.

462
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,583
I guess all that's
left is to execute them.

463
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,375
[NATSU &amp; WENDY scream]

464
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:47,875
Gross! What are
those things?!

465
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,500
Carnivorous plants?!

466
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:50,666
[WENDY screaming]

467
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,916
This is so nasty!

468
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,166
They'll be killed!

469
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,708
Don't worry, we're gonna
get you out of there!

470
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:57,125
[NATSU] The hell you will!
Things are starting to get good!

471
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,625
Wait your turn!

472
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,333
[PANTHERLILY] Get over it!
This isn't the time for that!

473
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,708
I'll pull out
your whiskers!

474
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,375
Don't test me!

475
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,916
He puts on the tough
guy act pretty thick.

476
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,833
I wonder if he'll keep
it up as he's eaten alive.

477
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,875
Let's turn these
freaks into compost!

478
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,500
[WENDY] I'm ready when you are!

479
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,000
Sky Dragon...
Wing Attack!

480
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:22,875
That's awesome!

481
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,125
Dragon Slayer teams
are unstoppable!

482
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,208
And here I thought

483
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,000
Natsu and Gajeel
worked well together.

484
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,833
It just goes to show ya
how close he and Wendy are.

485
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,416
Wait. When did Natsu
and Wendy start dating?!

486
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,458
And once again,
you don't get it.

487
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:36,833
All right. You ready?

488
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,833
Ohh yeah. I've got
a fire in my belly.

489
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:40,791
[WENDY shouts]

490
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,083
[NATSU shouts]

491
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,708
[CARLA] Must they
be so dramatic?

492
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:47,083
[HAPPY] Wow! They're
in perfect sync!

493
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,666
The Hungry Wolf Knights
are being pushed back?

494
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,333
Just how powerful are they?

495
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,583
After all the battles
they've had to fight together,

496
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,041
they're super powerful.

497
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,500
I wouldn't be
surprised if they knew

498
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,000
what each other was thinking.

499
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,333
He trusts her.
She trusts him...

500
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,875
What a powerful bond.

501
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,333
That must be why
Fairy Tail's so strong.

502
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,833
[ARCADIOS] Don't
drop your guard.

503
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,791
This fight's far from over.

504
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:12,083
The executioners' true
terror is yet to come.

505
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,083
[LEADER] Neppa. Uosuke...

506
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,375
Alright, Freshwater,
let's splash this party.

507
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,083
Let's haul'em in!

508
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,583
There's two more!
It's our turn, Lily!

509
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,000
I'm right behind you!

510
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,500
Hook, line, and sinker!

511
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:26,375
[NATSU &amp; WENDY shout]

512
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:27,750
[MIRAJANE &amp; PANTHERLILY yell]

513
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,708
Ka-pop!

514
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,166
Sploosh!

515
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,625
Cheaters!
It was two-on-two!

516
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:35,833
Where's your sense of honor?

517
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,375
We never accepted
any formal challenge.

518
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:41,250
Our only goal is to
execute you lawbreakers.

519
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,583
We was just testin'
the waters, is all.

520
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,375
[PANTHERLILY] That's
some powerful stuff!

521
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,500
[MIRAJANE] Keep your
distance around chubby.

522
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,000
[NEPPA chuckles]

523
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,416
What's the matter?
Can't take the heat, hot stuff?

524
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,000
Keep your
balance, Wendy!

525
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,583
I'm trying!

526
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,416
[COSMOS] Even if it was just for
a moment, you made a complete

527
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,708
disarray of our
beautiful handiwork.

528
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,458
And you'll suffer
the punishment.

529
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,625
I promise it won't
be pleasant...

530
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:03,708
Especially...

531
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,000
for the loud and ugly one!

532
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,208
[NATSU] Shut your fly-trap!

533
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,083
[NATSU yells]

534
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:10,083
Natsu! You okay?

535
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,250
[WENDY yells]

536
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:12,708
This isn't the
time to be worrying

537
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,166
about others, my dear.

538
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:17,625
Illusion magic!

539
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:20,000
No problem! I should be
able to break through!

540
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:24,125
Sky Dragon... Roar!

541
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:25,958
[COSMOS giggles]

542
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:28,583
Simply beautiful...

543
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:30,583
What in the
heck is this?!

544
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:35,458
Soon you'll dance
with the grim reaper...

545
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:39,125
As my Corpse Flower
blooms from your blood!

546
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:41,583
Wendy!

547
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:14,833
[NATSU] I honestly didn't think
those goofy lookin' knights

548
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:15,833
would be that strong!

549
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:17,000
[HAPPY] If looks
gave you strength,

550
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,666
I'd be the strongest
member of the guild!

551
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,041
[NATSU] You keep thinkin' that!

552
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,166
Do you realize how
frustrating it is to lose

553
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,541
to a bunch of circus freaks?!

554
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:25,333
[HAPPY] I thought their
outfits were pretty snazzy.

555
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,750
[NATSU] I'll rephrase; if
Miss "Rose and Thorns"

556
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,333
took your fish, would you still
think she dresses well?

557
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:32,000
[HAPPY] No Flower Lady's
taking this cat's supper!

558
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:35,083
[HAPPY &amp; NATSU] Next time:
Fairy Tail vs. Executioners!

559
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:37,916
[NATSU] I refuse to lose to such
a dumb lookin' group of jerks!

560
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,708
[HAPPY] Just try
and take my fish!

561
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:41,916
My claws will be
happy to meet ya!
