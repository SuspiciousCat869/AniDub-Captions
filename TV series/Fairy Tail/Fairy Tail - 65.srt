1
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:20,291
- Zero:
PREVIOUSLY, ON "FAIRY TAIL"...

2
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,000
- Lucy: IT TOOK ALL
OUR MAGIC ENERGY.

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:23,791
BUT AFTER COUNTLESS BATTLES,

4
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,791
WE FINALLY DEFEATED EVERY LAST
MEMBER OF THE ORACION SEIS.

5
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,000
- Happy: LITTLE DID WE KNOW THAT
WOULD UNLEASH BRAIN'S ALTER EGO,

6
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:31,125
MASTER ZERO.

7
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,125
WISH WE COULD REPLENISH
OUR ENERGY SOMEHOW,

8
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:36,875
'CAUSE THIS GUY'S GONNA
BE HARD TO BEAT.

9
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,958
- ( theme music playing )

10
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

11
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,875
- HOW LONG?

12
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:14,916
I SIMPLY CAN'T HELP
BUT ASK MYSELF

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,166
HOW LONG MUST I CONTINUE
TO FIGHT THE UNENDING WRONGS

14
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,875
IN THIS WORLD?

15
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,250
- IS THAT ERZA?

16
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:35,041
- I FOUND YOU.
- LOOK WHO'S HERE.

17
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,125
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
YOU OKAY?

18
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:38,166
- UH-HUH.

19
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,333
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

20
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,583
- DO I KNOW YOU?

21
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:53,333
- I KNEW IT.
HE DOESN'T REMEMBER ME.

22
00:02:56,833 --> 00:03:00,750
- IT ISN'T PERSONAL.
HE'S JUST NOT HIMSELF.

23
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,083
UNFORTUNATELY,

24
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:06,791
IT SEEMS HE'S UNABLE
TO REMEMBER EITHER OF US.

25
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,666
- HE'S LOST HIS MEMORY.

26
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,666
I SEE.

27
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,833
SO THAT'S WHY.

28
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:24,625
- ( Happy speaking )

29
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:29,083
- YOUR NAME IS WENDY MARVEL?

30
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:32,541
I'M SORRY,
BUT I DON'T KNOW YOU.

31
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:36,208
- YOU'VE LOST YOUR MEMORY?

32
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:39,000
IF THAT'S THE CASE, THEN YOU'VE
FORGOTTEN HOW TO STOP NIRVANA,

33
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,625
HAVEN'T YOU?
- NO, I TRIED.

34
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:52,416
I FAILED.  MY SELF-DESTRUCTION
MAGIC CIRCLE DIDN'T WORK.

35
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,333
THERE'S NOTHING MORE
I CAN DO NOW.

36
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,000
I'M SORRY.

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,958
- WHAT'LL WE DO?
- YOU CAN'T GIVE UP THAT EASILY.

38
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,583
OUR GUILD IS IN DANGER OF BEING
DESTROYED AT ANY MOMENT.

39
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,666
DON'T TURN YOUR BACK
ON OUR COMRADES.

40
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,166
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
WE CAN DO.

41
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,375
- ( explosion )
- WHAT WAS THAT?

42
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:52,041
- I ASK THAT YOU
PLEASE REMAIN CALM.

43
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:56,125
DON'T YOU SEE, THERE'S NO
ESCAPING THE FATE BEFORE US?

44
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,000
ON THIS DAY,

45
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:01,083
WE SHALL BE PUNISHED
FOR OUR NABURA HEAVY SINS.

46
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,041
- ( laughing )

47
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:14,125
DESTROY JUSTICE AND DECENCY.

48
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,041
- IT CAN'T BE.
- THAT'S CAIT'S SHELTER.

49
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:25,083
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
SO MUCH LIGHT AND MAGIC POWER.

50
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,875
HE'S GOING TO FIRE NIRVANA.

51
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,625
- NO.  THE GUILD.

52
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,583
- PLEASE, NO!

53
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,583
- ( Zero laughing )

54
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,208
- WHAT?
- ( clamoring )

55
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,000
- IT FLEW RIGHT BY.

56
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,083
- WHAT HAPPENED?

57
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,625
- ( shouting ) MAN!  MAN!  MAN!
MAN!  MAN!  MAN!  MAN!  MAN!

58
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,250
( winces )

59
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:30,458
- SOMETHING STRUCK NIRVANA'S
LEG, BUT WHAT WAS IT?

60
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,666
- ( gasps ) NO WAY.

61
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,666
- OH, WOW.

62
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,708
- THE MAGIC BOMBER
CHRISTINA SAVES THE DAY.

63
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:51,208
- IS IT AN ALLY?

64
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:55,000
- Hibiki: DO YOU READ ME?
SOMEONE ANYONE, RESPOND.

65
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:58,083
PLEASE LET ME KNOW
THAT YOU'RE OKAY.

66
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,375
- I KNOW THAT VOICE.

67
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,083
IT'S HIBIKI.
- YEAH.

68
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,875
- ERZA AND WENDY,

69
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,541
GOOD TO KNOW YOU'RE
ALIVE AND WELL.

70
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,833
- IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING,

71
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,000
I'M ALIVE BUT NOT QUITE WELL.

72
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,416
- MASTER ICHIYA,
GLAD TO HEAR IT.

73
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,083
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

74
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,791
I NEVER EXPECTED TO SEE
THE MAGIC BOMBER FLY AGAIN.

75
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:18,416
- Carla: NOR DID I.
CERTAINLY NOT, AFTER WE WATCHED

76
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,041
THE ORACION SEIS SHOOT
HER DOWN.

77
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,250
- Wendy: HOW'D YOU GET
HER FLYING AGAIN?

78
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,666
- HARD WORK
AND LOTS OF IT.

79
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,875
FOR A GROUP OF WIZARDS
WHO BARELY KNOW EACH OTHER,

80
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:31,375
WE'RE PRETTY GOOD AT WORKING
TOGETHER TO GET THE JOB DONE.

81
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:34,291
CHRISTINA LOST ONE OF HER
WINGS WHEN SHE WAS SHOT DOWN,

82
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:37,625
SO LYON'S USING HIS
ICE MAKE MAGIC TO REPLACE IT.

83
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,125
- ( grunts ) THIS IS HARDER THAN
I THOUGHT IT'D BE.

84
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,291
- YOU'LL SEE ON THE BOW,

85
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,125
SHERRY'S COMBINING HER
MARIONETTE MAGIC

86
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:48,708
WITH REN'S AIR MAGIC TO KEEP
THE DAMAGED HULL INTACT.

87
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,333
- I DON'T THINK
THAT I'VE EVER

88
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:53,041
WORKED WITH ANYTHING
QUITE THIS BIG.

89
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,000
- RIGHT? I'M JUST GLAD
IT'S NOT AS HEAVY AS IT LOOKS.

90
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,500
- OUR ATTACK ON NIRVANA

91
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,083
WAS THANKS TO
EVE'S SNOW MAGIC.

92
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,833
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

93
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,458
- I USED IT TO FUSE A COUPLE

94
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:09,875
OF CHRISTINA'S MAGIC BOMBS
TOGETHER.

95
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:14,250
WHEN FIRED, THEY DID VERY
LITTLE DAMAGE TO NIRVANA.

96
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:18,208
EVEN THOUGH,
THEY'RE SO POWERFUL.

97
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,958
THAT TOOK THE LAST

98
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:24,125
OF MY MAGIC ENERGY.
( groans )

99
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:27,708
- Hibiki: EVE.
- WE'VE GOTTA STAY STRONG.

100
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,250
- I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
I CAN KEEP THIS UP.

101
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,708
- DON'T CRACK.
JUST A LITTLE MORE.

102
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,875
WE OWE YOU ONE.

103
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,500
- BECAUSE OF YOU,
MY GUILD IS SAFE.

104
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,041
THANK YOU.

105
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:50,083
- I'M SURE YOU CAN TELL
THAT EVERYONE HERE

106
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:53,875
IS RUNNING LOW ON MAGIC ENERGY
RIGHT NOW.

107
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:57,000
I'M AFRAID WE CAN'T ATTACK
FROM THE SHIP ANYMORE.

108
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:01,333
POWER'S TOO LOW.  JUST FLYING
THIS FAR WAS HARD ENOUGH.

109
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,833
- DON'T WORRY,
WE'RE GONNA BE FINE.

110
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:08,125
LISTEN UP.
THERE'S ONE LAST THING.

111
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,125
A LITTLE BIT OF GOOD NEWS.

112
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,708
I FINALLY FOUND WHAT I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR IN THE ARCHIVE.

113
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:16,333
I KNOW HOW TO STOP NIRVANA.

114
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,750
- Erza:
PLEASE. TELL US.

115
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,833
- YOU KNOW THE SIX APPENDAGES
WE THOUGHT WERE LEGS?

116
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,708
WELL, THEY AREN'T.
THEY'RE PIPES.

117
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,291
APPARENTLY, THEY SUCK MAGIC
ENERGY OUT OF THE EARTH,

118
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,791
WHICH THEN IS USED
TO POWER NIRVANA.

119
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:34,166
AT THE BASE OF EACH LEG IS
A LACRIMA THAT CONTROLS

120
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,208
THE SUPPLY OF MAGIC ENERGY.

121
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,791
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,

122
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,375
IF ALL SIX LACRIMA ARE
DESTROYED SIMULTANEOUSLY,

123
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,291
IT WILL WREAK HAVOC
ON NIRVANA'S CONTROL SYSTEM

124
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:47,000
THEREFORE FORCING IT
TO SHUT DOWN.

125
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,541
THEY MUST BE DESTROYED
AT ONCE.

126
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:53,416
OR THE OTHER FIVE WILL
SIMPLY REPAIR THE DAMAGED ONE.

127
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,291
- SIMULTANEOUSLY DESTROY
SIX LACRIMA?

128
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,708
HOW DO WE DO THAT?

129
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,666
- IF I COULD,
I'D MAINTAIN TELEPATHY

130
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,083
TO TIME OUT THE STRIKE.
TRY THIS.

131
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,500
I'LL GIVE EACH OF GUYS YOU
A SYNCED TIMER.

132
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,958
I'M UPLOADING IT TO YOU NOW.

133
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,416
BUT LISTEN, GUYS,
IT HAS TO BE PRECISE.

134
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,541
- TWENTY MINUTES?

135
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,333
THAT'S WHEN NIRVANA WILL
BE FULLY CHARGED

136
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,458
AND READY
TO FIRE AGAIN.

137
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,833
- WE HAVE TO DESTROY ALL SIX
AT ONCE.

138
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:27,958
- MAN.

139
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,250
- IF ANYBODY CAN DO IT,

140
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,083
IT'S YOU GUYS.

141
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,791
I HAVE FAITH IN YOU.

142
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,916
- CARE TO WAGER A BET?

143
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,541
- WHO'S THAT?
- WHO ARE YOU?

144
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,208
- IT'S THAT CREEPY BRAIN GUY.

145
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,041
- HOW WAS HE ABLE
TO HIJACK MY TELEPATHY?

146
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,500
- I AM ZERO.

147
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:49,375
MASTER OF THE ORACION SEIS.
BRAIN IS NO MORE.

148
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,833
- I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THOSE
BONEHEADS HAD A MASTER.

149
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,666
- FIRST OF ALL,
ALLOW ME TO COMMEND YOU.

150
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,500
YOU FOOLED ME.
I NEVER SUSPECTED THERE MIGHT BE

151
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,458
OTHER WIZARDS CAPABLE
OF ARCHIVE MAGIC LIKE BRAIN.

152
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,250
- HE USED ARCHIVE?

153
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,125
THAT MUST'VE BEEN HOW HE FOUND
OUT ABOUT NIRVANA

154
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,958
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

155
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:12,208
- NOW HEED MY WORDS,
WIZARDS OF LIGHT.

156
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:16,666
I AM GOING TO OBLITERATE
EVERYTHING YOU HOLD DEAR.

157
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:21,458
I'VE ALREADY BEGUN BY DESTROYING
THREE OF YOUR LITTLE FRIENDS,

158
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,500
A DRAGON SLAYER,

159
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,208
AN ICE WIZARD

160
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,625
AND A CELESTIAL WIZARD.

161
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,958
( laughing ) AND A CAT.

162
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,500
- HE GOT NATSU AND THE OTHERS?
- WHAT'D THEY EVER DO TO YOU?

163
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,291
DID I HEAR YOU SAY SOMETHING

164
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:40,083
ABOUT DESTROYING NIRVANA'S
LACRIMA SIMULTANEOUSLY?

165
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,541
WELL, YOU CAN TRY.

166
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,500
BUT I'M STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT
OF ONE OF THEM,

167
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,541
AND I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF LEAVING.

168
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,875
( laughs )

169
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,583
AS LONG AS I'M HERE,
IT'LL BE IMPOSSIBLE

170
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,583
TO DESTROY ALL SIX AT ONCE.

171
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,000
- ( grunts )
- OW!

172
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,750
OUR TELEPATHIC CONNECTION'S
BEEN CUT OFF.

173
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:07,041
- THOUGH IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE,
WE CAN DESTROY ALL SIX AT ONCE.

174
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:10,583
WE MUST SPLIT UP
AND ATTACK INDIVIDUALLY.

175
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:14,250
AND HOPE THAT WE ALL STRIKE
AT THE SAME TIME.

176
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:18,000
EACH WIZARD HAS A ONE-IN-SIX
CHANCE OF RUNNING INTO ZERO.

177
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,750
UNFORTUNATELY,
ERZA'S THE ONLY ONE

178
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,125
WHO HAS ANY REAL CHANCE
AGAINST HIM.

179
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,166
- EXCUSE ME, I THINK YOU'RE
FORGETTING SOMETHING,

180
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,541
LIKE BASIC MATH.

181
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,666
WE DON'T HAVE SIX WIZARDS
WITH ENOUGH MAGIC ENERGY

182
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,083
TO GO THROUGH
WITH YOUR PLAN.

183
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,333
- ( gasps )
BUT THAT MEANS.

184
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,375
OH, NO!

185
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,833
I CAN'T FIGHT.

186
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,541
I'M SORRY.  I CAN'T HELP YOU.

187
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,750
- WE CAN'T DO IT ON OUR OWN.

188
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,000
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE
STRONG ENOUGH TO HELP US?

189
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,791
- Ichiya:
YES, MY HONEY.

190
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,416
I'M ABLE-BODIED
AND AT YOUR SERVICE.

191
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,875
ALTHOUGH I AM TIED UP RIGHT NOW.

192
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,458
- MASTER ICHIYA.  THAT'S THREE.

193
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,625
WHO ELSE?

194
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,458
OH, NO.
HEY, I'M ALMOST OUT OF ENERGY.

195
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:09,500
WE GOTTA HURRY, YOU GUYS.
- WE NEED THREE MORE PEOPLE.

196
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,791
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMEONE ELSE.
CAN ANYONE HELP?

197
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,166
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?
CHRISTINA'S LOSING ALTITUDE.

198
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:22,458
- ( grunts )

199
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,666
NO, I'M COMPLETELY
DRAINED OF ENERGY.

200
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,125
I'VE FAILED.

201
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:30,791
- ( grunts )
I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE.

202
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,666
I'M SORRY.
( panting )

203
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,875
- SHERRY!

204
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,916
- CHRISTINA'S LOSING ALTITUDE.

205
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,833
- GRAY, GET UP.

206
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,500
YOU MUST.

207
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,583
THINK OF UR.

208
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:10,333
DON'T LET HER DOWN.
YOU MUST KEEP FIGHTING.

209
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,500
DON'T LET THESE GUYS
GET THE BEST OF YOU.

210
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,166
- I'VE ALWAYS HATED YOU,
LUCY.

211
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,958
YOU THINK YOU'RE SO CUTE.

212
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:26,875
YOU KNOW,
YOU'LL NEVER COMPARE TO ME.

213
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,833
YOU'RE AN AIR-HEADED CRYBABY.

214
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:33,750
THERE'S ONE THING I CAN SAY.
YOU ALWAYS GIVE IT YOUR ALL.

215
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:37,500
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD REALLY
CARE WHETHER YOU DIED.

216
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:42,333
BUT I WAS WRONG, LUCY.
PLEASE, YOU HAVE TO RESPOND.

217
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,583
- ( loud bang)
- ( shudders )

218
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,375
- NATSU.

219
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,833
- RESPOND, TOMCAT.

220
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,000
- Erza: NATSU.

221
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,833
- ( grunting )

222
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:52,958
- CAN YOU HEAR OUR VOICES?
IF YOU CAN, PLEASE RESPOND.

223
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:11,166
- YEAH, WE HEAR YOU.

224
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,833
- NATSU.

225
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:19,291
- DESTROY ALL SIX

226
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,833
LACRIMA AT ONE TIME.

227
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,750
- MAN.

228
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,875
- SO WHO'S FIGHTING ZERO?

229
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:37,041
'CAUSE WE'D LIKE ANOTHER
CRACK AT HIM.  RIGHT, BOYS?

230
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:40,416
- EIGHTEEN MINUTES LEFT.
WE'VE GOTTA HURRY.

231
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,791
WE OWE IT TO CARLA AND WENDY
TO PROTECT THEIR GUILD.

232
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,125
- GUYS, MY TELEPATHY'S
ABOUT TO CUT OUT.

233
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:59,583
A WHILE AGO, I UPLOADED A MAP
TO EACH OF YOUR MINDS.

234
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,791
I NUMBERED THE LACRIMA
SO YOU COULD FIND THEM.

235
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,833
EVERYBODY CHOOSE A NUMBER,
OKAY?

236
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,750
THEN SPLIT UP--
- ( explosion )

237
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,250
- ARE YOU OKAY?  SHERRY!

238
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,041
YOU'VE PUSHED YOURSELF
TOO HARD.

239
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,208
- I'LL TAKE ONE.
- TWO.

240
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:27,250
- GUESS I'LL TAKE THREE.
PLEASE DON'T LET ZERO BE THERE.

241
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,125
- THEN I SHALL TAKE NUMBER FOUR.

242
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,625
I CAN TELL IT'S CLOSEST TO ME,

243
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,291
THANKS TO THE SMELL
OF ITS PARFUM.

244
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,666
- YOU MEAN, BECAUSE YOU
SEE IT ON THE MAP?

245
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,958
- MY HONEY, WHY DO YOU INSIST
ON MAKING A FOOL OUT OF ME?

246
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,833
- I CAN TAKE NUMBER FIVE.

247
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,208
ERZA, GUESS YOU'RE
FEELING BETTER, HUH?

248
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:46,125
YEAH, IT'S ALL THANKS
TO YOU GUYS.

249
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:49,916
- THAT LEAVES ME WITH--
- YOU'RE LEFT WITH NUMBER SIX.

250
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,375
- WHOSE VOICE DID I HEAR JUST
NOW? IS SOMEONE THERE WITH YOU?

251
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:55,291
- NATSU HASN'T BEEN MADE AWARE
OF YOUR SITUATION YET.

252
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,083
HE STILL THINKS YOU'RE
THE ENEMY.

253
00:17:57,166 --> 00:18:00,125
SO TRY TO KEEP QUIET.

254
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:07,708
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- WE LOST OUR CONNECTION. 

255
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,958
- THAT MEANS WE LOST HIBIKI.

256
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,208
- ( crying )

257
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,958
- WE'VE SIX WIZARDS NOW.
LET'S GET THE BALL ROLLING.

258
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:24,875
- OKAY GUYS, IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE
GOT THE SIX PEOPLE WE NEED.

259
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:28,416
LET'S GO AND IF YOU RUN INTO
ZERO, TAKE THAT JERK DOWN.

260
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,666
'CAUSE WE'RE ALL GONNA BE TOO
BUSY DESTROYING THOSE LACRIMA.

261
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,333
- ( grunts )

262
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:41,416
MAN!  MAN!  MAN!  MAN--

263
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,458
UGH!  OW!  COME ON, ICHIYA.
GOTTA STAY SMOOTH.

264
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,208
I HAVE TO MAKE IT
TO LACRIMA NUMBER FOUR.

265
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,125
( panting )

266
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,583
EVERYBODY'S COUNTING ON ME.

267
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,583
THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO
IS LET MY NEW COMRADES DOWN.

268
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:59,125
( panting )
I'M NOT OUT OF BREATH.

269
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:03,375
I GOT THIS.  I MAY NOT LOOK IT,
BUT I'M STILL A YOUNG MAN, MAN!

270
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:31,333
- FANCY MEETING YOU HERE,
BRAT.

271
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:38,958
YOU LOOKING FOR A FIGHT?
YOU FOUND ONE.

272
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:42,041
- I WONDER WHICH ONE OF US WILL
MAKE IT OUT OF HERE ALIVE.

273
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:45,416
ME OR YOU?

274
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,750
- I BET ZERO'S
AT LACRIMA NUMBER ONE.

275
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,375
- THAT'S WHERE NATSU'S HEADED.

276
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,166
- HE'S GOT A NOSE LIKE NO OTHER.

277
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,625
HE MUST'VE CHOSEN KNOWING ZERO
WOULD BE THERE.

278
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:57,041
- WE GOTTA GET OVER THERE
AND HELP HIM.

279
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,875
IF WE WORK TOGETHER MAYBE--
- DON'T UNDERESTIMATE NATSU.

280
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:03,541
TRY NOT TO WORRY.
HE CAN HANDLE IT ON HIS OWN.

281
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,750
- NATSU.

282
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,875
- LET'S SPLIT UP
AND GET TO OUR POSTS.

283
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,750
I'VE GOT NUMBER FIVE
AND YOU'VE GOT NUMBER SIX, OKAY?

284
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,875
- ( shudders )

285
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,458
- SOMETHING WRONG?

286
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:22,250
- NO, I-- ( grunts )

287
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,916
I'M PERFECTLY FINE.

288
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:37,666
( groans ) NATSU...

289
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,333
DRAGNEEL.

290
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:00,458
- IMPRESSIVE.  YOU'RE MUCH MORE
AGILE THAN THE LAST TIME WE MET.

291
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:06,625
DARK CAPRICCIO!

292
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,583
AS YOU CAN SEE,
I'M TWICE AS STRONG AS BRAIN.

293
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,208
- UGH!
- ( laughing )

294
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:21,083
( continues laughing )

295
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:24,583
YOU WERE WONDERING
WHO WILL MAKE IT OUT ALIVE.

296
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,416
I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS
THAT IT'LL BE ME.

297
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:36,791
- FIRE DRAGON IRON FIST!

298
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,666
( grunting )

299
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,125
NO.

300
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,625
- HMM...

301
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,125
I MUST SAY I'M SURPRISED
YOU WERE ABLE

302
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,458
TO STOP A PIERCING SPELL.

303
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:03,208
WHO'S THERE?

304
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,916
- JELLAL!

305
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,291
- WELL, HELLO.

306
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:25,916
I TAKE IT YOUR MEMORY
HAS RETURNED?

307
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,791
- ( growling )

308
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,750
- ( end theme playing )

309
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,375
- ( singing in Japanese )

310
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:14,625
- Natsu: NOW THAT WE KNOW HOW
TO STOP NIRVANA,


311
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:17,083
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME WE GO
ON A RAMPAGE, DON'T YOU?


312
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:19,375
- Happy: AYE.
THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM:


313
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,958
EVERYBODY'S USED UP
THEIR MAGIC ENERGY


314
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:23,041
AND NOW THEY'RE
ALL TOO WEAK TO RAMPAGE.


315
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,958
- Natsu: THEY'VE GOTTA HAVE SOME
FIGHTING SPIRIT LEFT IN 'EM.


316
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:27,166
AW, YEAH.
I'M ALL FIRED UP.


317
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,291
- Happy: YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES I'M JEALOUS OF


318
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:29,958
YOUR SIMPLEMINDEDNESS.


319
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,416
- ( Happy and Natsu speaking )

320
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,416
- Natsu: THIS MIGHT BE YOUR ONLY
CHANCE TO SHOW OFF FOR CARLA.

321
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,250
- Happy: OH, YEAH!
NOW I'M ALL FIRED UP.

322
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,708
- Natsu: WHAT WERE YOU SAYING
ABOUT SIMPLEMINDEDNESS, HAPPY?
