1
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,791
- HEY, GUYS.  READY FOR
SOME MORE "FAIRY TAIL"?

2
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,791
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING,

3
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,375
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE ROOM,

4
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:26,291
AND DON'T SIT TOO CLOSE
TO THE TV.

5
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:30,208
- Narrator: THIS IS THE
MYSTERIOUS EAST FOREST 

6
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,208
FOUND IN MAGNOLIA.

7
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,791
A PLACE OVERFLOWING
WITH MAGICAL POWER,

8
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,416
OF WHICH MANY TALES ARE TOLD.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,833
- OH, COME ON.  I HAVE A NOVEL
TO WRITE, YOU KNOW.

10
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,333
WHY'D YOU HAVE TO
DRAG ME ALONG

11
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:44,000
ON YOUR STUPID
FISHING TRIP? 

12
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,500
- STOP COMPLAINING.

13
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,583
BESIDES, YOU JUST SAID 
YOU HAD WRITER'S BLOCK,

14
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,166
DIDN'T YOU?
- AYE.

15
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,166
AND NOTHING CAN GET
YOUR CREATIVE JUICES FLOWING

16
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,583
LIKE A CHANGE OF PACE.

17
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,500
- YEAH, BUT WHY DOES IT
HAVE TO BE FISHING?

18
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:57,500
- 'CAUSE FISH IS MY VERY
MOST FAVORITEST FOOD, OF COURSE.

19
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:58,958
- YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT.

20
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:01,083
I'M ASKING WHY
I HAVE TO FISH

21
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:02,875
FOR YOUR FAVORITE FOOD.

22
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:04,166
- WHOA.  I GOT ONE.

23
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,875
- WATCH OUT.
LOOKS LIKE A WHOPPER!

24
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:09,041
- LEAVE IT TO ME.
( shouts )

25
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:11,041
- IT'S HUGE!
- Happy: UPPA!

26
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,000
- Lucy:
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

27
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,166
- ( chuckles )
LOOK AT THAT. 

28
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,125
JUST LIKE THE GOOD OLD DAYS.

29
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,833
- ( theme music playing )

30
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,500
- FISHY WISHY,
NUMMY YUMMY,

31
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:51,916
GET IN MY TUMMY!

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,958
UPPA!  YUM!

33
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,541
- I KNEW YOU WERE IMMATURE,

34
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:56,916
BUT THIS IS A NEW LOW.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,125
- ( screams )
- OH, YEAH.

36
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,208
THAT LOOKS TASTY.
- YOU RUINED IT! 

37
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,208
FISH TASTES BETTER
IF YOU EAT IT RAW.

38
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,375
- WHY WOULD I DO THAT
WHEN IT ONLY TAKES A SEC

39
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,541
TO GRILL IT UP?

40
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,208
- 'CAUSE THAT'S HOW I
WANTED TO EAT IT.

41
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,291
- I GOT IT,
SO I EAT IT MY WAY.

42
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,208
IF YOU'RE GONNA COMPLAIN,
GO CATCH YOUR OWN.

43
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,625
- DON'T DO IT!

44
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:16,125
- EW.  HE'S EATING IT
BONES AND ALL.

45
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,375
- EHH.
- ( sighs )

46
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,083
MAN, THAT HIT THE SPOT.

47
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,083
- HOW COULD YOU?

48
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:25,250
FINE! OUR FRIENDSHIP
IS OVER, NATSU!

49
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,083
- YOU'RE QUITE THE DRAMA QUEEN,
AREN'T YOU?

50
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,916
- HMM.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,916
- YOU GONNA FOLLOW HIM?

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,541
OH, GIVE ME A BREAK.

53
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,458
KEEP UP THAT TOUGH GUY ACT
AND YOU'LL NEVER GET

54
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,458
THE GIRLS TO LIKE YOU.

55
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:38,583
- ( gasps )

56
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,166
- ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

57
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,125
- GO APOLOGIZE--
- JUST SHUT YOUR MOUTH FOR ONCE.

58
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,416
- WHAT WAS THAT
ALL ABOUT?

59
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,750
SCARY.

60
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,583
- ( gasps )

61
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,250
- Narrator:
THE FAIRY TAIL ARCHIVES

62
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,416
WHERE THE GUILD'S
RECORDS ARE STORED.

63
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,041
- HEY, MIRA!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP THERE?

64
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,625
- JUST A BIT OF REORGANIZING,
THAT'S ALL.

65
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,500
- OH, I CAN HELP WITH THAT.

66
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,125
- ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO?

67
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,541
- YEAH.
I'M GOOD WITH BORING STUFF.

68
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:16,875
- MM-HMM!

69
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,875
- AND THEN HE JUST
STORMED OFF.

70
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,291
WHAT A JERK, RIGHT?

71
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,708
- ( giggles )
MAYBE.

72
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,791
BUT THAT'S WHAT
MAKES HIM SO CUTE.

73
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,041
- YOU REALLY THINK SO?
- OF COURSE.

74
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,541
- YOU'RE ATTRACTED TO
NATSU'S BOYISH CHARMS TOO,

75
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,208
AREN'T YOU?
- WHAT?!

76
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,458
AH-- NO!

77
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,541
- LUCY.

78
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,958
- ( laughing )

79
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,041
- YOU OKAY?
- YEAH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

80
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,416
I GUESS LADDERS
AREN'T MY STRONG POINT.

81
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,625
I FOUND AND OLD PAINTING.

82
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,250
- ( chuckles )
I REMEMBER THAT.

83
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,833
- IS THIS EVERYONE
WHEN THEY WERE KIDS?

84
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,291
- IT SURE IS.

85
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,875
- Lucy:
THIS MUST BE GRAY.

86
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,500
AND WHO'S THAT
NEXT TO HIM?

87
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,666
CANA?
WHOA, MACAO AND WAKABA?

88
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,666
THEY LOOK SO YOUNG!

89
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,250
( chuckles )

90
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,500
OH, I'D RECOGNIZE
THAT SPIKY HEAD ANYWHERE.

91
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,666
NATSU HASN'T CHANGED A BIT.

92
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,666
AND WHAT'S WITH
THE LITTLE BLUE DRAGON?

93
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,208
- THAT'S HAPPY.
- ( gasps )

94
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,791
I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU EVEN KNOW THIS,

95
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,500
BUT HOW DID NATSU AND HAPPY
FIRST MEET, ANYWAY?

96
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,250
- LET ME THINK.

97
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,750
WHEN THAT PICTURE WAS PAINTED,

98
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,166
I HADN'T BEEN A MEMBER
OF FAIRY TAIL

99
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,500
FOR VERY LONG MYSELF.

100
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,500
THE TIME SURE HAS FLOWN BY.

101
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,458
- Makarov: HEY, NATSU!

102
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,666
- HE WENT OUT.

103
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,250
- SOMETHING ABOUT A FIGHT.

104
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,666
- I'LL SHOW YOU!
- LET'S SEE YOU TRY.

105
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,666
- SHUT YOUR FACE!
- Mirajane: BACK THEN,

106
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,708
NATSU AND GRAY WERE
LITTLE BALLS OF HATE.

107
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,125
THEY'D FIGHT EVERY TIME
THEY RAN INTO EACH OTHER.

108
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,000
- Lucy: DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE MUCH HAS CHANGED.

109
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,708
- ( both grunt )
- FLAME-BRAINED LIZARD!

110
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,166
- UNDIE-FLASHING FREAK!

111
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,458
- ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ENOUGH OUT OF YOU.

112
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,708
- Mirajane: OF COURSE, THERE WAS
ALWAYS SOMEONE TO BREAK THEM UP.

113
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,291
- Lucy:
LET ME GUESS, ERZA.

114
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,125
- MIND YOUR OWN
BUSINESS FOR ONCE.

115
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,125
- YOU WANT A PIECE
OF ME TOO, YOU JERK?

116
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,625
- IF YOU INSIST.

117
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,000
- ( both shout )

118
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,416
( both grunt )

119
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,541
- NOW BEHAVE.
NO MORE POINTLESS FIGHTING

120
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:01,833
FROM YOU TWO.

121
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,375
- YOU JUST GOT LUCKY.

122
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,208
- I'LL WIN NEXT TIME.

123
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:13,000
- Mirajane: NATSU WAS ALWAYS
GETTING INTO FIGHTS LIKE THAT.

124
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,666
OF COURSE, HE ACTED LIKE
THAT'S WHAT HE WANTED,

125
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,250
BUT SOMETIMES I'D CATCH HIM 
WITH A SAD LOOK ON HIS FACE.

126
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,166
THEN ONE DAY...

127
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,791
- ( grunting )

128
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,166
AAH!

129
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,333
STUPID ERZA AND GRAY.

130
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,250
YOU STINK!
( grunts )

131
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,333
AAH!

132
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:38,458
THAT DIDN'T HURT AT ALL.

133
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,708
OH, WHAT THE HECK?

134
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,250
( chuckles )

135
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,666
HEY, YOU GUYS!

136
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,750
CHECK OUT THIS AWESOME EGG
I JUST FOUND.

137
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,083
- WHERE IN BLAZES
DID YOU PICK UP THAT THING?

138
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,750
- I FOUND IT IN 
THE EAST FOREST.

139
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,375
- THE EAST FOREST?

140
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,791
- LOOK AT THAT.
GUESS YOU'RE GOOD

141
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,625
FOR SOMETHING AFTER ALL, HUH?

142
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,958
GONNA FRY IT UP FOR US?

143
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,291
- GRAY, YOUR CLOTHES!
- ( gasps )

144
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,791
- I AIN'T GONNA FRY THIS.

145
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,458
CAN'T YOU SEE IT'S
A DRAGON'S EGG?

146
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:04,708
I'M GONNA HATCH IT.

147
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,125
- YOU SURE?
- LOOK AT THE MARKS

148
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,541
ON THE OUTSIDE OF IT.

149
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,375
THEY LOOK JUST LIKE 
DRAGON CLAWS, RIGHT?

150
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:10,416
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

151
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,916
- SO ANYWAY, GRAMPS,

152
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,041
WHY DON'T YOU HATCH
THE DRAGON WITH A SPELL?

153
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,166
- GAH.  DON'T BE A FOOL.

154
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,041
USING MAGIC
FOR SUCH A PURPOSE

155
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,166
WOULD DISHONOR
THE MIRACLE OF LIFE.

156
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,541
YOU SEE, LIFE IS
BORN FROM LOVE

157
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:23,958
AND LOVE ALONE.

158
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,708
NO SPELL CAN
TRANSCEND THAT POWER.

159
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,708
- UH...

160
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,125
SORRY, GRAMPS.
I DON'T THINK I'M FOLLOWING YOU.

161
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:34,250
- ( sighs ) YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
WHEN YOU GROW UP.

162
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,833
- HE'S SAYING THAT IF
YOU WANT IT TO HATCH,

163
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,708
YOU HAVE TO WORK HARD TO
MAKE IT HAPPEN ON YOUR OWN.

164
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,666
SINCE YOU USUALLY JUST
BURN AND BREAK THINGS ALL DAY,

165
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,416
IT MIGHT BE NICE
TO TRY SOMETHING

166
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,833
MORE PRODUCTIVE FOR ONCE.

167
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,125
- ERZA!
- I DIDN'T HEAR YOU COME IN.

168
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:50,458
- I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU,
ERZA.

169
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,416
WHY DON'T WE PICK UP
WHERE WE LEFT OFF?

170
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,833
COME AND GET SOME.

171
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,500
- YOU'RE GONNA FIGHT AGAIN?

172
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,833
- MIRA.  YOU KNOW
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,

173
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,375
WE NEVER DID
FINISH OUR MATCH,

174
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,500
DID WE?

175
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,000
- WHA--?!

176
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,500
ARE YOU FOR REAL?
- ( humming )

177
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,666
- THAT GIRL IS YOU?
- YEP.  SURPRISED? 

178
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,666
- YEAH.  THIS DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE YOU AT ALL.

179
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,250
AND WAIT...

180
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,500
YOU SAID YOU WERE
PICKING A FIGHT WITH ERZA?

181
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:14,666
- ( giggles )

182
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,583
- I'M GONNA BURY YOU ALIVE!

183
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,375
- I'LL MAKE YOU
BEG FOR MERCY! 

184
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,458
- IS THAT ARMOR
YOUR TRAINING BRA?

185
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,166
- LIKE SHOWING OFF
YOUR LOVE HANDLES?

186
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,875
- YOU UGLY PRUDE.
- YOU STUPID WENCH.

187
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,458
- THUNDER THIGHS.
- WAY TO KEEP IT CLASSY, GIRLS.

188
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,875
- OH, SURE.  SHE'S ALL MAD
WHEN WE GET IN A FIGHT,

189
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,041
BUT SHE CAN WRECK THE WHOLE
GUILD WHENEVER SHE WANTS?

190
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:36,708
- JUST WAIT.  ONE OF THESE DAYS
I'M GONNA GIVE THEM A BEATDOWN

191
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,291
THEY'RE NEVER GONNA FORGET.

192
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,750
- AW, GIVE ME A BREAK.

193
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,791
KEEP UP THAT TOUGH GUY ACT,

194
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,916
AND YOU'LL NEVER GET
THE GIRLS TO LIKE YOU.

195
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,125
- SHUT UP, LISANNA.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

196
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,291
- NOW DON'T BE MEAN.
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO ASK

197
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,125
IF YOU NEEDED A HAND
RAISING THAT EGG?

198
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,125
- ( gasps )
YOU WANT TO HELP, REALLY?

199
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:55,208
- MM-HMM. I'VE NEVER
TRIED RAISING A DRAGON.

200
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,833
I BET IT'LL BE REAL FUN.

201
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,916
- I DON'T KNOW IF
"FUN"'S THE RIGHT WORD.

202
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,750
- SO HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO MAKE IT HATCH?

203
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,125
- I THINK YOU JUST
WARM IT UP.

204
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,666
- WHAT, FOR REAL?

205
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,333
LOOKS LIKE I'M
THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB.

206
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,333
- NOT LIKE THAT, NATSU!

207
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:09,541
- ARE YOU STUPID?!

208
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,416
- JEEZ.

209
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,666
CAREFUL.  WE'RE TYING
TO HATCH THE EGG,

210
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,916
NOT POACH IT.
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

211
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,291
- SIT BACK AND LET
MY MAGIC HANDLE THIS.

212
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,333
TAKE OVER...

213
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,916
ANIMAL SOUL!

214
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,416
( giggles )

215
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,208
- WHOA, YOU'RE A BIRD!
- OH, I GET IT.

216
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,541
- WE'RE EXPERTS WHEN
IT COMES TO HATCHING EGGS.

217
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,916
- WOW, YOU'RE SO SMART.

218
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,750
- AW, ELFMAN,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

219
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,916
- MY LITTLE SISTER'S PERFECTED
THE FULL-BODY TAKE OVER,

220
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,958
BUT I'M STILL HAVING
TROUBLE WITH IT.

221
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,625
I'M A SUCKY WIZARD.

222
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,291
- OH, I FORGOT YOU GUYS
USE THE SAME MAGIC.

223
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,958
- IF I WAS
AS STRONG AS HER,

224
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,541
I COULD TURN INTO A BIRD 
AND LOOK FOR MY PARAKEET.

225
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,291
- PARAKEET?

226
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,958
- WE USED TO BE
THE BEST OF FRIENDS

227
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,541
TILL HE FLEW AWAY.

228
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,666
- THAT'S SO SAD.

229
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,125
- MAN, I WISH I HAD AN EGG
TO HATCH LIKE THEY DO.

230
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,708
- AWW.
SO THAT'S REALLY ELFMAN?

231
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:03,041
HE WAS SUCH
A CUTE LITTLE GUY.

232
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,208
- OH YEAH, HE HASN'T
CHANGED MUCH AT ALL.

233
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,750
- Narrator:
MAGNOLIA SOUTH GATE PARK.

234
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,291
- YOU'RE STARTING
TO MAKE ME NERVOUS.

235
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,291
- THE EGG WILL HATCH
IF WE SIT LIKE THIS?

236
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,541
- MM-HMM.
IT GETS KIND OF BORING THOUGH.

237
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,958
- ( rustling )
- WHOA, IT STARTED MOVING.

238
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,833
AAH!

239
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,833
WHAT'S GOING ON?

240
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,833
( gasps )

241
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,000
HUH.  LOOKS LIKE
IT CALMED DOWN. 

242
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,416
HEY, MAYBE THE EGG'S
TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING

243
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,416
LIKE IT WANTS YOU
TO WARM IT UP INSTEAD.

244
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,250
- YEAH?
YOU REALLY THINK SO?

245
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,666
- YEAH.
DOESN'T IT SEEM LIKE

246
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,000
IT'S HAPPY NOW?

247
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,750
- HEY EGG,
YOU WANT TO BE WITH ME?

248
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:41,916
- ( rustling )

249
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,166
- I THINK IT SAID YES.

250
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,375
- SEE, WHAT'D I TELL YOU?

251
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,916
- RIGHT AS ALWAYS.

252
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,750
- OOH, I HAVE AN IDEA.

253
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,666
WHY DON'T WE BUILD
THE EGG A LITTLE HOUSE?

254
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,416
- LIKE A SECRET BASE?

255
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,416
( grunts )

256
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,916
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

257
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
IS THAT THE AWESOMEST
HOUSE EVER OR WHAT?

258
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,708
- UH, YEAH.
PRETTY AWESOME.

259
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,541
- AAH!

260
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,625
I GUESS AWESOMENESS DOESN'T
COUNT FOR EVERYTHING, HUH? 

261
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,291
- MY TURN NOW.

262
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,541
LEAVE EVERYTHING TO ME.

263
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,791
- WHOA!  YOU'RE HUGE.

264
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,625
- PRETTY CUTE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

265
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:14,875
NOW HOLD ON
JUST A SEC.

266
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,958
- SO COOL.
ALL I'M GOOD FOR

267
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,291
IS BREAKING STUFF.

268
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,750
- TA-DA!

269
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,208
ALL DONE.

270
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,375
- WHOA.
NICE JOB, LISANNA.

271
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,291
- NOW LET'S CHECK OUT
THE INSIDE.

272
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,208
- I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GONNA FIT.

273
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,708
WHOA.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

274
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,458
IT'S ACTUALLY
PRETTY ROOMY IN HERE.

275
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,041
- YEAH, ISN'T IT THOUGH?

276
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,625
ANYWAY,
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A SEAT?

277
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,000
- OH, SURE.

278
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,208
- ( giggles ) IT'S ALMOST LIKE
WE'RE A FAMILY NOW, HUH?

279
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,708
- HOW DO YOU FIGURE?

280
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,250
- WELL, YOU'VE GOT
A MOMMY AND A DADDY,

281
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,083
AND THE EGG IS LIKE
OUR LITTLE BABY

282
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,500
THAT HASN'T BEEN BORN YET.

283
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,416
- I GUESS THAT
DOESN'T SOUND SO BAD.

284
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,333
- ( giggles )

285
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:57,583
HOW ABOUT WE TRY
WARMING THE EGG TOGETHER?

286
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,125
- OKAY.

287
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:04,333
- IT'S WARM, ISN'T IT?
- YEAH.

288
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,333
- WHA-- IT MOVED AGAIN.

289
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:09,208
- OH, I HOPE
IT HATCHES SOON.

290
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,791
- YOU KIDDING ME?
A DRAGON'S EGG?

291
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,208
DON'T TELL ME YOU BELIEVE
IN ALL THAT GARBAGE?

292
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,750
- I DON'T KNOW. NATSU SAID
HE WAS RAISED BY A DRAGON,

293
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,083
SO WHY NOT?

294
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,541
- YEAH, LIKE I BUY THAT.

295
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,375
- GIVE THEM A BREAK,
THEY'RE KIDS.

296
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,291
LISANNA EVEN MADE
A LITTLE BITTY HOUSE

297
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,875
TO PROTECT THE EGG.
- YOU GUYS ARE LAME.

298
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,291
- THAT'S SO CUTE.

299
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,333
- AW, PUPPY LOVE.

300
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,833
- ( groans )

301
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,583
- ( both gasp )
- ( overlapping chatter )

302
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,708
- WHAT THE HECK'S
YOUR PROBLEM ALL OF A SUDDEN?

303
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,041
- CAN'T YOU JUST SULK AROUND
LIKE A NORMAL TEENAGER?

304
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,375
- I KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG

305
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,125
WHEN SHE DIDN'T
STOP BY THE GUILD.

306
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,625
SO SHE'S BEEN HANGING OUT
WITH NATSU, HAS SHE?

307
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,375
- YEAH.
- SHE CAN'T BE FRIENDS

308
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,375
WITH SOMEONE FROM
TEAM ERZA!

309
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,208
- SHE IS SERIOUSLY
P.O.'ED.

310
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,875
- TRY TO CHILL OUT.
JEEZ!

311
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:59,541
- OH, SO THIS IS WHERE
YOU FOUND THE EGG?

312
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,791
- UH-HUH.  IT FELL DOWN
FROM THE TREE WHEN I PUNCHED IT.

313
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,583
- I SEE.

314
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,208
- ( both gasp, scream )

315
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,666
- ( chuckles )

316
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,166
- Narrator: THIS MONSTER
IS A VICIOUS GORIAN

317
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,583
ALSO KNOWN AS
A FOREST VULCAN.

318
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,750
INCIDENTALLY,
IT'S FAVORITE FOOD IS...

319
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,083
- EGG.  GIVE IT TO ME, BOY.

320
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,416
- YEAH, FAT CHANCE.

321
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,500
YOU REALLY WANT TO
EAT SOMETHING?

322
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,041
HOW ABOUT MY FIST?!

323
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,166
- OH WOW.
THAT KIND OF TICKLES.

324
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,583
- YOU ASKED FOR IT.
- ( grunts )

325
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,791
- ( screams )

326
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,583
YOU'RE HURT,
LET ME HELP YOU.

327
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:32,625
- NO, JUST STAY BACK.
- BUT WHY?

328
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,625
- 'CAUSE I'M THE DAD,
AND I GOTTA PROTECT MY FAMILY.

329
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,375
- NATSU...

330
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,583
- BESIDES, I'M JUST
GETTING WARMED UP. 

331
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,625
I'M THE SON OF A DRAGON,
YOU KNOW.

332
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,458
I WON'T LOSE TO A MONKEY!

333
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,125
- ( grunts )

334
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,750
- ( grunting )

335
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,125
- NATSU!
HIT HIM WITH YOUR MAGIC.

336
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:52,041
- IF THIS APE WANTS
TO FIGHT WITH HIS FISTS,

337
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,416
THEN THAT'S HOW
I'M GONNA BEAT HIM.

338
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,916
- I'D LOVE TO
SEE YOU TRY. 

339
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,208
- YOU BETTER STOP YAPPING
AND START FIGHTING,

340
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,791
'CAUSE I'M GONNA
PAINT YOU WHITE 

341
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,416
AND SEND YOU BACK
TO MOUNT HAKABE. 

342
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,625
- ( shouts )

343
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,750
YOU MAKE ME MAD!

344
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,541
- BE CAREFUL!

345
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:12,500
- AAH!

346
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:21,666
- ( grunts )

347
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,375
- YOU DID IT,
YOU DID IT!

348
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,458
YOU SAVED THE DAY.

349
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,458
- YEAH, I KNOW.
PRETTY COOL, HUH?

350
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,000
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR FACE?!

351
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,083
THE EGG'S GONNA GET COLD.

352
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,625
- WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

353
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,916
- HOLD ON.
WAIT HERE A SEC.

354
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,666
'KAY, COME IN.

355
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,958
- WHAT'S WITH HER?

356
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,666
- WELCOME BACK, DEAR.

357
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,916
- OH, WHAT?

358
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,958
- I SAID
"WELCOME BACK, DEAR."

359
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:52,000
- OH.  HI, HONEY.
I'M HOME?

360
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,000
- ( giggles )

361
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,041
- HM.

362
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,083
- GOOD THING
WE MADE IT HERE.

363
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,666
THE RAIN ISN'T STOPPING.

364
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,958
- ( stomach growls )

365
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,083
- UH, SORRY.

366
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,416
( groans )

367
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,666
- HEY, I WAS WONDERING.

368
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,916
YOU LIVE ALONE,
DON'T YOU?

369
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,166
- YEAH.

370
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,833
- THEN WHO COOKS
YOUR MEALS FOR YOU?

371
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,416
- I JUST EAT AT THE GUILD.

372
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,916
- SO DO YOU HAVE TO PAY?

373
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,375
- SURE.  WHY ELSE WOULD I
WORK ALL THE TIME?

374
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,666
- AW, THAT'S SAD.
- YOU THINK SO?

375
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,916
- YOU KNOW, I COULD
COOK DINNER FOR YOU

376
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,333
SOMETIME IF YOU'D LIKE?
- WHOA!

377
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,875
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD COOK.

378
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,958
- I'M NOT AS GOOD
AS MY SISTER THOUGH.

379
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,125
- WAIT, HOLD ON.
YOU'RE TELLING ME MIRA

380
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:32,125
ACTUALLY COOKS?
YOU MEAN LIKE FOOD, RIGHT?

381
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,583
NOT LITTLE CHILDREN?

382
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,541
DOES ELFMAN COOK TOO?

383
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,041
- YEAH.
OF COURSE HE DOES.

384
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,208
- ( Elfman humming )

385
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,791
COOK UP NICE FOR ME, OKAY?

386
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,041
- ACTUALLY THAT'S NOT
SO STRANGE AT ALL.

387
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,916
IT SUITS HIM PRETTY WELL.

388
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,291
NO!  I'M NOT
GIVING YOU THE EGG.

389
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,708
I BET IT'S IGNEEL'S KID.

390
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,291
I GOTTA LET IT HATCH.

391
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,291
DON'T YOU DARE TRY
TO FRY IT UP!

392
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,916
- DON'T JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS!
NOW LISTEN,

393
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,250
I BUILT THIS HOUSE
SO WE COULD

394
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,166
RAISE THE EGG TOGETHER,
DIDN'T I?

395
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,166
I WANT IT TO HATCH
AS MUCH AS YOU DO.

396
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,333
- THEN WHY'D YOU
SCARE ME LIKE THAT, JERK?

397
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,250
AW, WHO'S MY LITTLE BUDDY?

398
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,916
YOU ARE, YOU ARE.

399
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,333
- EVEN IF YOU GET MAD
AND PICK FIGHTS ALL THE TIME,

400
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,750
YOU STILL HAVE
A SWEET SIDE, DON'T YOU?

401
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,958
JUST LIKE MIRA.
- HUH?

402
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,583
- IT'S BEEN FUN
PLAYING HOUSE WITH YOU.

403
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:19,000
MAYBE SOME DAY I COULD
BE YOUR REAL WIFE?

404
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,416
- WHAT--

405
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,375
WHAT GOT YOU
THINKING ABOUT THAT?

406
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,500
- I JUST NOTICED
HOW STRONG AND BRAVE YOU ARE,

407
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,000
AND YOU'RE GOOD
WITH KIDS TOO. 

408
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,500
WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?

409
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,916
- UH... YOU THINK SO?

410
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,833
- WHAT ARE YOU GETTING
SO EMBARRASSED ABOUT? 

411
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,041
I WAS JUST
MAKING A JOKE.

412
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,875
- I KNOW THE WORD FOR YOU!
GRAMPS CALLS ME THAT:

413
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,375
NUVEJILE!

414
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:41,291
- JUVENILE?
JEEZ, YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.

415
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,625
- ( groans )
NO FAIR!

416
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,875
WHY YOU GOTTA BE
SMARTER THAN ME?

417
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,875
- ( both gasp )

418
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,166
- WOW!

419
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,375
IT'S SO PRETTY.

420
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:58,375
IT'D BE NICE IF WE COULD
STAY LIKE THIS FOREVER, 

421
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,166
DON'T YOU THINK?

422
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,083
- LOOK, IT'S MOVING AGAIN.
- UH-HUH.

423
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,166
- ( snoring )

424
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,083
- ( sighs )

425
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,500
- AAH!

426
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,583
THE EGG'S GONE!
- WHAT?!

427
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,708
- ALL RIGHT,
WHICH ONE OF YOU STOLE IT?

428
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,291
- WE DON'T WANT
YOUR DUMB EGG. 

429
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,833
- I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

430
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,083
GRAY, YOUR CLOTHES.
- ( gasps )

431
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,875
- LAXUS, WAS IT YOU?
- YEAH RIGHT.

432
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,875
- OKAY, ERZA,
OUT WITH IT ALREADY.

433
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,083
- NOW NOW, LET'S NOT
JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS.

434
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,416
IT WASN'T ME.
- WHAT ABOUT YOU, MIRA?

435
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,666
HAVE YOU SEEN THE EGG?
- NO. 'FRAID NOT.

436
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,416
YOU ATE IT,
DIDN'T YOU, PINKY?

437
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,750
JUST ADMIT IT.

438
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,666
- MIRA!
- ( gasps )

439
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,833
THAT'S IT.
YOU'RE GOING DOWN!

440
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,250
- YEAH?
WELL, BRING IT ON.

441
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,916
I'LL SKIN YOU ALIVE, TWERP.

442
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,833
- Gray: NATSU, WATCH WHERE
YOU'RE PUNCHING, STUPID.

443
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,500
- Natsu: I'LL FIGHT YOU TOO!

444
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,916
- THEY'RE AT IT AGAIN.

445
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,916
- MAN, WHAT ARE WE GONNA
DO WITH THESE KIDS?

446
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,583
HATE TO THINK WHAT THE GUILD'S
GONNA BE LIKE IN A FEW YEARS. 

447
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,791
- THEY ONLY FIGHT BECAUSE
THEY ACKNOWLEDGE

448
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,208
EACH OTHER'S STRENGTH

449
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,291
AND WHEN THEY SEE THEMSELVES
IN ONE ANOTHER,

450
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,166
IT MAKES THEM
STRIVE TO IMPROVE.

451
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,041
IN OTHER WORDS,
THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

452
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,666
- YEAH, YOU WISH.

453
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,875
- WHY ARE YOU SO MEAN?
I JUST WANT MY EGG BACK.

454
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,041
- COME ON.
- AW, LOOK AT YOU CRYING.

455
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,875
HOW CUTE.
- I'M NOT CRYING!

456
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,041
- YOU HAVE TO QUIT
TEASING HIM ABOUT IT.

457
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,750
NOW, WOULD YOU
PLEASE STOP CRYING?

458
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,166
- I'LL MAKE YOU CRY!

459
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,458
- HURRY UP AND GIVE HIM 
THE EGG BACK, ALL RIGHT?

460
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,125
- I TOLD YOU,
I AIN'T GOT IT.

461
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,208
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU ATE IT,
PORKY.

462
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,125
- Erza: WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?!
- POOR EGG.

463
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,291
- Mirajane:
I SAW YOU EYEING THAT THING.

464
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,875
- ( crying )

465
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,041
- YOU KNOW, ELFMAN TOLD ME
HOW JEALOUS HE WAS

466
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,541
OF YOUR EGG
THE OTHER DAY.

467
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,916
- WHA--?!
- HE'S THE ONE WHO ATE IT?

468
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,250
- NO, HE'D NEVER DO THAT.

469
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,166
- HEY, SORRY, GUYS.

470
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,416
- IT WAS YOU ALL ALONG,
WASN'T IT?

471
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,833
- Lisanna: THE EGG.

472
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,000
- I DIDN'T MEAN
TO STEAL IT OR ANYTHING.

473
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,500
IT'S JUST YOU TOSS AND TURN
SO MUCH IN YOUR SLEEP,

474
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,833
I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULDN'T
KEEP THE EGG WARM ENOUGH.

475
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,416
- WAIT A SEC.
- SO IT'S OKAY?

476
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,333
- I'M NOT VERY GOOD WITH MAGIC,

477
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,083
BUT I STUCK CLOSE
TO IT ALL NIGHT, 

478
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,916
AND KEPT IT WARM
WITH MY BODY HEAT.

479
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,833
- OH, I GET IT NOW.
- THANK YOU.

480
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,750
- THANKS A LOT.
YOU SURE ARE A REAL MAN.

481
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,500
- AND YOU BLAMED
EVERYTHING ON ME. TYPICAL.

482
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,833
- WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
THINGS ARE USUALLY YOUR FAULT.

483
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,791
- ( cracking )
- ( all gasp )

484
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,750
- HUH?
- NOW WHAT?

485
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,708
- IT'S HATCHING.

486
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,208
- ( meows )

487
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,041
- Both: WHOA, IT'S
A FREAKING CAT?

488
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,916
- ( both gasp )

489
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,541
- Natsu: IT HAS WINGS.
IS IT A BIRD?

490
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:30,958
- Lisanna:
NO, IT'S A CAT.

491
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,500
A BLUE CAT.

492
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,041
- ( chuckles )

493
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,875
- AYE!

494
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,375
- HE'S SO CUTE!

495
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,708
- All: I KNOW!

496
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,791
- ( chirps )
- IT'S A PARAKEET.

497
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,291
MY BEST FRIEND'S BACK!

498
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,125
OH!  HEY, BUDDY!

499
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:52,291
- YEAH RIGHT.
HIS PARAKEET WAS RED.

500
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,041
- DO YOU SEE THAT?
A MINUTE AGO,

501
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,250
EVERYONE HERE WAS ALL WORKED UP.

502
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,041
AND NOW THEY'RE HAPPY.

503
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,541
HE'S ALMOST LIKE A BLUEBIRD
OF HAPPINESS, ISN'T HE?

504
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,375
- HAPPINESS, HUH?

505
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:06,916
WELL, IN THAT CASE
I'LL NAME HIM HAPPY.

506
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,166
- AYE!

507
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,583
- HAPPY THE DRAGON!
- AYE!

508
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,416
- Mirajane: IT'S NOT A DRAGON.

509
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,541
- OH WELL.
I'LL PAINT IT AS ONE ANYWAY.

510
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,500
- I SEE.

511
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,583
THAT WAS A TOTALLY CUTE STORY.

512
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,500
I REALLY HATE TO SEE
THOSE TWO FIGHTING. 

513
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,458
- THE CLOSER TWO PEOPLE ARE,
THE MORE THEY FIGHT.  IT'S FINE.

514
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,000
- HEY, MIRA.

515
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,833
THINK YOU COULD COME
HELP ME FOR A SEC?

516
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,583
- OF COURSE.
- NOW LET'S SEE...

517
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,833
THERE'S ERZA AND GRAY
AND MIRAJANE.

518
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:37,583
THAT'S LAXUS,
AND THIS GIRL MUST BE LISANNA.

519
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,833
THAT'S WEIRD.  IF SHE'S MIRA
AND ELFMAN'S SISTER,

520
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,750
HOW COME I HAVEN'T
MET HER YET?

521
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,708
I WONDER WHERE SHE IS.

522
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,583
- Lisanna: DON'T TELL ME
YOU TWO ARE FIGHTING AGAIN.

523
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:55,625
- Natsu: OH, HEY, LISANNA.
GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

524
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,708
- ( chuckles )

525
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,541
- HE ATE MY WHOLE FISH
AND DIDN'T EVEN ASK ME FIRST.

526
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,041
- WHENEVER I EAT ANY FISH
YOU SAY IT'S YOURS.

527
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:06,166
- JEEZ.  NATSU, YOU'RE THE DAD.
- HUH?

528
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,625
- SO YOU GOTTA TAKE GOOD CARE
OF YOUR WIFE AND SON.

529
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,375
- THAT WAS LIKE
A MILLION YEARS AGO.

530
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,958
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

531
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,291
- I-- NOTHING!
- IT'S NORMAL FOR FAMILIES

532
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,208
TO HAVE A FIGHT
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

533
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,458
WHAT'S IMPORTANT
IS THAT YOU MAKE UP.

534
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:21,375
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,
HAPPY IS STILL OUR SON.

535
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,208
- I THINK LISANNA'S
GONE PSYCHO ON US. 

536
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,041
- DON'T TALK LIKE THAT, MAN.

537
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,041
- Happy: ( Southern accent ) 
THEN SHOULD I TALK LIKE THIS?

538
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,750
- Natsu: YOU KNOW THAT'S
NOT WHAT I MEANT!

539
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,166
- Lisanna:
JUVENILE AS EVER, I SEE.

540
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,083
- Natsu:
STOP PICKING ON ME!

541
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,583
- ( Happy and Lisanna laugh )

542
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,250
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.

543
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,083
I GUESS I GOT NO CHOICE.

544
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,791
- THIS IS THE LAST STRAW.

545
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,416
I'M NEVER SPEAKING
TO NATSU AGAIN.

546
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,750
- HEY.
- I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

547
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,666
- THAT'S A REAL SHAME, 'CAUSE I
CAN'T EAT ALL THIS BY MYSELF.

548
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,625
- OH?

549
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,833
WHOA.

550
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,583
- SO, YOU HAPPY NOW?

551
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,333
- OF COURSE!

552
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,916
WHO ELSE WOULD I BE?

553
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,666
- ( Natsu chuckles )

554
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,250
- Lucy: IT'S BEEN A WHILE.
I WONDER IF THOSE TWO

555
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,833
HAVE MADE UP YET.

556
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,250
WELL, THERE'S ONLY
ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

557
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,500
I'D BETTER GO 
CHECK ON THEM.

558
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,916
- ( theme music playing )

559
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,500
- ( singing in Japanese )

560
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:49,833
- Happy: PROFESSOR HAPPY'S
CLASS ABOUT "FAIRY TAIL." 

561
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:53,166
TODAY, I'M GONNA TEACH YOU
THE SECRETS OF THE MAGIC GUILDS.

562
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,666
THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS
OF GUILDS ALL OVER THE WORLD.

563
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,375
THERE ARE EVEN SOME REALLY
SCARY ONES CALLED "DARK GUILDS."

564
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:00,041
BUT NO MATTER WHAT 
GUILD THEY'RE FROM,

565
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:01,541
WIZARDS ALWAYS HAVE
THEIR GUILD'S MARK 

566
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:02,625
SOMEWHERE ON THEIR BODY.

567
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:03,791
EACH ONE'S DIFFERENT.

568
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,291
SEE IF YOU CAN
SPOT THEM ALL.

569
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,625
BET YOU FEEL PRETTY SMART NOW,
DON'T YOU?

570
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:09,791
YAY!  DISMISSED!

571
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:11,375
AYE!

572
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:13,458
- THIS IS BAD.

573
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:15,416
THE GUILD HALL'S
BEEN TOTALLY WRECKED.

574
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,750
- I BET IT'S ERZA'S FAULT.
SHE PROBABLY GOT HUNGRY

575
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,666
AND WENT ON
ONE OF HER RAMPAGES.

576
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,000
- YEAH, THAT DOES
SOUND LIKE HER, HUH?

577
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:24,083
- AYE. WITH HER POWER,
IT'S A MIRACLE

578
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,083
THE BUILDING'S STILL STANDING.

579
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:27,833
- WELL, I'M IN
NO RUSH TO GO HOME.

580
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:29,208
I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH.

581
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:35,041
- Happy: SHE'S KIND OF LIKE
THE BEHIND THE SCENES LEADER

582
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:36,291
OF FAIRY TAIL, HUH?

583
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:37,416
- Natsu: YOU DON'T THINK
SHE'S GONNA TAKE OVER

584
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,375
THE GUILD SOME DAY, DO YOU?

585
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:41,333
- ( both murmur )
