1
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,208
Have you learned your lesson,
or should I keep beating it in?

2
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:23,083
I'm fine with that.
Remember this the next time

3
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,333
[MINERVA]
you think of defying me!

4
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:26,666
Stop the match, now!

5
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,250
We can't lose the
Celestial wizard!

6
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,375
Call it off,
before it's too late!

7
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:32,833
[bell dinging]

8
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,000
[CHAPATI] The referee
has stopped the fight!

9
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,500
The Naval Battle is over!

10
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,333
Sabertooth takes
first place with

11
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:42,958
an overwhelming
show of brutal force!

12
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,375
It doesn't look
like Lucy is moving.

13
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:47,416
Can we please get the
paramedics on the field?

14
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,166
[GRAY and NATSU] Lucy!

15
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,375
[GRAY and NATSU grunt]

16
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,458
Come on, Lucy!
Please say something!

17
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,083
What in the
hell is your problem?

18
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,500
You went way too far!

19
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:38,166
Take the Celestial wizard
to the infirmary at once!

20
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,166
Hold on! I need to give her
special emergency treatment!

21
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,333
I'll help you!

22
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,458
Just hang in there, Lucy!

23
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,666
What a scornful expression.

24
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,541
Here we go!

25
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,958
She's hurt pretty bad,
so let's combine our powers.

26
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,916
You can glare at
me all you want,

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,833
if it makes you feel better.

28
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,000
But remember that I
acted in full compliance

29
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,958
with the rules
of the competition.

30
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,791
That may be true...

31
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,458
but you went way
outside the bounds

32
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,375
of basic human decency.

33
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,791
[chuckles]

34
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:20,416
I was simply trying to
entertain the crowd, that's all.

35
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,000
To be quite honest,
you should be thanking me.

36
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,375
She got second
place, didn't she?

37
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,416
[MINNERVA] She could never
have done that without my help.

38
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,916
What?

39
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,000
What is going
on down there?

40
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:49,875
Both teams are on the
ground and ready to rumble!

41
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,416
[MALE 172A]
Sweet bonus round action!

42
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,666
[MALE 172B] Sabertooth
versus Fairy Tail!

43
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,083
They're both
hot-tempered guilds,

44
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,083
but they need to
play it cool right now.

45
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,666
The dramatic tension in the
air is absolutely delicious!

46
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,166
Thank you very much!

47
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,458
Yeah. Well, I guess
we shoulda seen this one

48
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,083
comin' from a mile away.

49
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,291
It was bound to
happen, alright.

50
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,500
Since this isn't a
part of the contest.

51
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,708
We should be ready to go down
there and lend them a hand.

52
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:13,833
Aye, Sir!

53
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,916
Would you tomcats
please calm down?

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,541
That's how we like it!

55
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,916
[NOVALI, SEMUS,
and YAEGAR] Wild!

56
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,916
[MATO] This is most certainly
a thrilling turn of events!

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,166
Do we join them?

58
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,541
I don't know.

59
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,708
Man.

60
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:42,000
[CROWD chanting "fight"]

61
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,250
Although you may be considered
the strongest guild in Fiore,

62
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,625
you'd be wise to
heed this warning.

63
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,958
[ERZA] Listen carefully.

64
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,250
Making an enemy of
Fairy Tail is a decision

65
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,375
that you will regret.

66
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,583
[HAPPY] A Parfum for You!

67
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,916
She's gonna be okay,
isn't she?

68
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,125
Any word on
Lucy's condition?

69
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,125
Is she awake?

70
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,750
You guys came!

71
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:37,916
We may be on
different teams,

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
but we're all in the same guild.

73
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,583
Laxus?

74
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,333
So, how is she?

75
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,750
She's not out of the woods yet,

76
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,791
but she'll pull
through thanks to Wendy.

77
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,875
No, it wasn't just me,
we're lucky Shelia

78
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,500
was there to help out, too.

79
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,250
Thank goodness.

80
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,583
I'm glad to hear
she hasn't sustained

81
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,583
any lasting injuries.

82
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,041
They're gonna pay.

83
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,833
You can sure as
hell bet on that one.

84
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,291
She's awake!

85
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,833
You guys. I'm sorry.

86
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:21,541
Say what?
Why are you apologizing?

87
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,833
[LUCY] Because
I screwed up again.

88
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,000
Are you kidding?

89
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,166
Second place is nothing
to be sorry about.

90
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,166
We got eight
points in that round!

91
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,125
Yes. Good job!

92
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,875
But, I lost my keys.

93
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,541
[HAPPY] I've got 'em right here.

94
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:42,333
Oh that's a relief.
Thank you, Happy.

95
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,416
I think she's
gonna be okay.

96
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,875
But we still
can't let those guys

97
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,750
get away with this kinda crap.

98
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,583
I feel the exact same way.

99
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,708
Lousy buncha scumbags.

00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,583
[door opens]

101
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,166
Master!

102
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,625
Unfortunate circumstances, but
I'm glad both teams are here.

103
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,666
I have something to tell you.

104
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,416
I was just contacted
by the games' organizers,

105
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,250
though I'm not sure if we'll
be a help or hindrance to us,

106
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,333
we've been asked to consolidate
our two teams into one.

107
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,541
Say what?

108
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,625
So we gotta be like
everybody else now, huh?

109
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,458
Why are they doing that?

110
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,541
[MAKAROV] Since Raven
Tail has been disqualified,

111
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,791
there are now seven
teams remaining.

112
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,666
Having an odd number
makes it difficult

113
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,625
to match up competitors
for the battles.

114
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,416
Therefore, we've
been ordered to do away

115
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
with the A and B
groups and form a single

116
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,208
five-person team for the
rest of the tournament.

117
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,041
So, we're losing
five members.

118
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,875
But how will this
affect our scores?

119
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,083
Mm.

120
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,125
We're only allowed to
keep the lower one.

121
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:47,125
And that would be the
thirty-five points from Team A.

122
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,750
But that's totally unfair!

123
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,791
Fair or not,
the decision's been made,

124
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,333
so we'd better accept it.

125
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,250
Look on the bright side,
this just means we're gonna

126
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,958
be able to put together
an even more kick-ass team.

127
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,583
Well, I wish this woulda
happened a little bit earlier.

128
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,250
Because the only
thing we have left now

129
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,500
are two man
battles, right?

130
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,708
You're wrong.

131
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,125
Traditionally, there
is a mandatory day off.

132
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,916
Followed by a battle
involving all members.

133
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,250
It's important to
choose carefully.

134
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,500
No matter what happens,
I'm gonna get revenge for Lucy!

135
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,416
If they think they
can treat her like that,

136
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,041
I'll show 'em myself
that they're dead wrong!

137
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,750
Day four's battle round
is about to be underway.

138
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:33,083
And we'll soon find out who
made the cut on team Fairy Tail!

139
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,291
You have a long history
with the guild, Mr. Yajima.

140
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,166
Got any predictions
on the final five?

141
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,583
No comment.

142
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,541
[CHAPATI] And once again,
joining us is Mr. Lavian,

143
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,291
noted thespian and founder
of the Scheherazade theatre.

144
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:46,125
[LAVIAN] Thank you very much
for this wonderful opportunity!

145
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,833
But don't forget,
today's team matches

146
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,958
are no mere stage combat.

147
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,833
That may be true,
but they still require

148
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,458
a certain kind of choreography
in their own right!

149
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,041
Let's get down to
business and announce

150
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,125
the lineups for
today's battles!

151
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:01,541
[CHAPATI] Now. Please turn your
attention to the lacrima-trons!

152
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,666
Match one will be
Blue Pegasus versus

153
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,125
the frisky Quattro Puppy!

154
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,541
[CHAPATI] Then on to round two,
the ladies of Mermaid Heel

155
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,541
facing off against Lamia Scale!

156
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,500
And then what could
be today's highlight,

157
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:18,458
Sabertooth against
the new Fairy Tail!

158
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:19,750
[cheering]

159
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,291
[CHAPATI] So put your
hands together for a big

160
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:24,500
Domus Flau welcome, and let's

00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,375
[ICHIYA] Which means...

323
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,333
we should both share
the same abilities!

324
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,416
[groans]

325
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,083
He's completely
out of commission!

326
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,541
What a tragedy!

327
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,041
[BACCHUS and ROCKER] Wild.

328
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,750
Let's get this over with.

329
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,416
This victory couldn't
have come at a better time.

330
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,291
We gotta get some
points on the board.

331
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,458
[CHAPATI] It looks
like it's rabbit season

332
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,208
here in Domus Flau!

333
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,791
It's two against one now.

334
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,250
So tragic and yet so thrilling!

335
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,208
[LAVIAN] Thank you very much!

336
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,208
Please, hold on just one moment!

337
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,250
Drillin' Rock For Ya!

338
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:00,833
Drunken Chop-Hanging
Palm, Under Moon!

339
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,166
[ICHIYA] Man!

340
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,083
Ichiya.

341
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:09,375
Nichiya.

342
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,250
Last call, fancy boy!

343
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,708
Time to eat some dirt!

344
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:17,458
[ICHIYA] I'm sorry I dragged you
into this battle. My mistake.

345
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,875
I should've known that
you're a lover, not a fighter.

346
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,666
Drillin Rock For ya! Bam!

347
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,333
[ICHIYA] Man!

348
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,916
[ICHIYA] And yet...
you chose the noble path

349
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,416
and fought bravely.

350
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:35,958
[ICHIYA] You put your
handsome face in harm's way.

351
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,125
I've failed my most
beautiful friend!

352
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:42,166
How could I have let you fall?

353
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,291
[groans]

354
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,625
[CHAPATI] Is that it? Did
Bacchus deal the final blow?

355
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,458
Now Ichiya joins
his furry teammate

356
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:51,666
on the floor of the arena,

357
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,958
and it's not looking
good for Blue Pegasus.

358
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,791
[BOTH] What are we, boys?

359
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,791
[ALL] Wild!

360
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:01,125
[CHAPATI] Wait! It's not over
yet! Ichiya appears to be

361
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:05,208
slowly getting up!
Will he be able to stand?

362
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,166
[ICHIYA] I swear to you...

363
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,541
I won't let your
struggle be in vain!

364
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:15,166
[ICHIYA] I will reveal the
handsome face of justice!

365
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,875
[ICHIYA yells]

366
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:24,500
Muscle, muscle! Man!
Man, man, muscle, muscle!

367
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,291
Muscle, man, man!

368
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:34,708
What the hell is this?
How did he get so wild?

369
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,583
Maybe it's power potion?

370
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:43,083
To my dear friend. I dedicate
the parfum of victory!

371
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,000
[All] Go get 'em!

372
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:49,125
[grunts]

373
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,166
[MATO] This is great!
I never expected this fight

374
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,333
would be so emotional.

375
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,916
[BACCHUS AND ROCKER]
Let's get wild!

376
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,666
Here I come with some
Drillin' Rock For Ya!

377
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,875
My soul is shaken and stirred!

378
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:03,458
Drunken Chop-Hanging Palm!

379
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,583
Give it your all.
But your attacks will melt...

380
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,291
against my Beautiful Dreamer!

381
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,166
[ICHIYA] Smile!

382
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,166
[BOTH] Huh?

383
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,250
And smash!

384
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,750
[gasps and groans]

385
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,833
[ALL] Uh...!

386
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,083
[CHAPATI] And from that
devastating charm offensive,

387
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,958
Quattro Puppy is down!

388
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,375
The winner is Blue Pegasus!

389
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,708
[ICHIYA] Man!

390
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,916
[CROWD cheering]

391
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,750
He actually took down Bacchus?

392
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,916
Both him and his buddy. Man.

393
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,916
[GRAY] I guess he's
not just an idiot.

394
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,833
[NATSU] He's totally awesome!

395
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,583
Talk about a
stud-muffin. He rules.

396
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,583
Ichiya's the man, for sure.

397
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,458
What a hunk!

398
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,666
[EVE] I wanna be just like him!

399
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:01,000
Are you alright... my friend?

400
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:04,375
Man, my pride hurts.

401
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,750
[CHAPATI] That was an amazing
match, don't you think?

402
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,416
Sure. If you say so.

403
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,125
[LAVIAN] The ending was
far too sappy for my taste,

404
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,500
thank you very much.

405
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,666
[CHAPATI] And we're diving
straight into round two

406
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,708
which puts Lamia
Scale's Lyon and Yuka...

407
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:21,166
[CROWD cheers]

408
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,958
[CHAPATI] against Mermaid
Heel's top dog Kagura,

409
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,250
and top cat Millianna!

410
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:30,125
[CROWD cheers]

411
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:31,791
Lyon and Kagura are fighting?

412
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,833
This is gonna be a good one.

413
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:41,291
[growls]

414
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:15,750
[HAPPY] And joining me today
is guest commentator, Natsu.

415
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:17,791
Tell me, what are your
thoughts on this matchup?

416
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:20,416
[NATSU] Lyon doesn't like Gray,
so he can't be all that bad.

417
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,500
And Yuka is the
eyebrow dude from Galuna

418
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,000
with the wavy magic, right?

419
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:25,166
[HAPPY] Uh-huh.

420
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,083
[NATSU] Now Kagura,
naw, I got nothin'!

421
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,708
And I bet if you
dress like a cat,

422
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:30,500
Milliana will hug ya to death!

423
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,666
[HAPPY and NATSU] Next time:
"Battle of Dragon Slayers!"

424
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,333
[HAPPY] Thank you, Natsu. You
shared with our viewers at home

425
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:38,083
your total lack of insight.

426
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:40,375
[NATSU] Ha-ha! That's what I do!
