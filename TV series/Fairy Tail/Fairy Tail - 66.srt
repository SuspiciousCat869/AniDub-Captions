- Happy: JUST AS NIRVANA
WAS ABOUT TO FIRE

3
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:22,750
ON THE CAIT SHELTER GUILD,

4
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:25,458
ITS LEG WAS BLASTED
BY THE MAGIC BOMBER CHRISTINA,

5
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:26,916
CAUSING IT TO MISS ITS MARK.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,375
- Lucy: THE TRIMEN, LYON
AND SHERRY USED THE LAST

7
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,958
OF THEIR MAGIC ENERGY
TO KEEP CHRISTINA IN THE AIR

8
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,583
AS LONG AS THEY POSSIBLY COULD.

9
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,208
- Carla: BUT NOW SHE'S CRASHED
TO THE GROUND.

10
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,833
- ( theme music playing )

11
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,708
- ( singing in Japanese )

12
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,666
- Narrator:
DEEP WITHIN THE WORTH WOODSEA,

13
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,916
A POWERFUL SPELL CAPABLE
OF SWITCHING LIGHT AND DARKNESS

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,416
KNOWN AS NIRVANA
WAS SEALED AWAY,

15
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,416
UNTIL A DARK GUILD

16
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,458
CALLED THE ORACION SEIS
WENT SEARCHING FOR IT,

17
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:24,375
DETERMINED TO UNSEAL AND OBTAIN
THIS POWERFUL MAGIC.

18
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:28,000
A COALITION OF OFFICIAL GUILDS
WAS ASSEMBLED IN AN EFFORT

19
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,791
TO STOP THEM.

20
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:34,375
FROM THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD--
NATSU, LUCY, GRAY AND ERZA.

21
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:38,791
FROM BLUE PEGASUS--
HIBIKI, REN, EVE AND ICHIYA.

22
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:43,041
FROM LAYMIA SCALE--
LYON, SHERRY AND JURA.

23
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:46,041
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST,
FROM THE CAIT SHELTER GUILD,

24
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:49,458
WENDY MARVELL.
THOUGH PRESUMED DEAD AFTER

25
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:52,166
THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TOWER
OF HEAVEN, JELLAL HAS RETURNED.

26
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,458
AND HIS PRESENCE HAS THROWN
OUR HEROES INTO UTTER CONFUSION.

27
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:59,708
AFTER MANY BATTLES, THE DARK
GUILD HAS BEEN DEFEATED.

28
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,708
BUT NATSU AND HIS FRIENDS
FIND THEMSELVES

29
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,708
IN THEIR WORST PREDICAMENT YET

30
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,958
WHEN MASTER ZERO MAKES
AN APPEARANCE.

31
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,208
- I'LL TAKE ONE.
- TWO.

32
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:10,750
- I GUESS I'LL TAKE THREE.

33
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,375
PLEASE DON'T LET ZERO BE THERE.

34
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,083
- THEN I SHALL TAKE NUMBER FOUR.

35
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,500
I CAN TELL IT'S THE CLOSEST
TO ME,

36
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,083
THANKS TO THE SMELL
OF ITS PARFUM.

37
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,083
- YOU MEAN, BECAUSE YOU SEE IT
ON THE MAP?

38
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,125
- MY HONEY, WHY DO YOU INSIST
ON MAKING A FOOL OUT OF ME?

39
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:27,291
- I CAN TAKE NUMBER FIVE.
YOU'RE LEFT WITH NUMBER SIX.

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,916
- ( Narrator speaking )

41
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,166
- ( wind howling )

42
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,500
- Gray:
( panting ) JEEZ.

43
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,333
IT'S LIKE THIS HALLWAY'S
NEVER ENDING.

44
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,708
I WAS WORRIED I WASN'T
GONNA MAKE IT.

45
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,875
I GUESS THIS IS LACRIMA
NUMBER TWO.

46
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:03,041
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GONNA
BE EASY ENOUGH TO DESTROY.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,333
NO SIGN OF MASTER ZERO.

48
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,000
IT'S ABOUT TIME I CATCH A BREAK.

49
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,666
BUT THAT MEANS ONE
OF THE OTHERS

50
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,416
IS GOING HEAD-TO-HEAD
WITH THAT PSYCHO RIGHT NOW.

51
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,083
- Narrator: MEANWHILE,
BACK AT LACRIMA NUMBER ONE.

52
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,583
- ( groaning )

53
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,208
JELLAL!

54
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,333
- WELL, HELLO.

55
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:47,333
I TAKE IT YOUR MEMORY
HAS RETURNED?

56
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,375
- YES.

57
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,583
- ( growls )

58
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,708
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE COME HERE.

59
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,791
JELLAL!

60
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,625
- STOP.

61
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,625
- DID YOU FORGET FLAMES
DON'T WORK ON ME?

62
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:18,083
- YES, BRIEFLY,
BUT I REMEMBERED JUST IN TIME.

63
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:22,375
ONLY YOU CAN STOP ZERO.

64
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,666
- WHAT?

65
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,750
- CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG,
BUT AS A FIRE DRAGON SLAYER,

66
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,708
DOESN'T THE POWER
OF FLAME AMPLIFY YOUR MAGIC?

67
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,625
- YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.
BUT WHY?

68
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,125
- LIAR.
JUDGING BY YOUR ACTIONS,

69
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,208
YOUR MEMORY HAS
NOT BEEN RESTORED.

70
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,875
- I DIDN'T LIE TO YOU.

71
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,333
ONLY MY MEMORIES
OF NATSU HAVE RETURNED.

72
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:48,083
I'M DETERMINED
TO STOP NIRVANA.

73
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,208
WHETHER OR NOT THE REST
OF MY MEMORIES RETURN

74
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,458
WILL NOT AFFECT MY GOAL.

75
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,041
- I DON'T GET IT.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

76
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,750
- WHEN I AWOKE,
IT WAS AS THOUGH MY MEMORY

77
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,875
HAD BEEN COMPLETELY WIPED CLEAN.

78
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:03,583
ALTHOUGH I HAVE NO RECOLLECTION
OF BEHAVING LIKE A VILE CRETIN,

79
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,000
IT SEEMS THAT WAS THE CASE.

80
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,750
I'VE BROUGHT HARM UPON
NOT ONLY YOU AND ERZA,

81
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:11,666
BUT ALL OF FAIRY TAIL.
IT'S TIME TO MAKE AMENDS.

82
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,666
I WANT TO HELP YOU PROTECT
WENDY'S GUILD.

83
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,416
I WANT TO STOP NIRVANA.

84
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,500
I KNOW WE CAN DO IT AS LONG
AS WE WORK TOGETHER.

85
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,250
- I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

86
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:23,166
YOU'RE SAYING YOU FORGOT
EVERYTHING YOU DID TO US?

87
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,333
QUIT PRETENDING TO BE
ON OUR SIDE OR YOU'LL PAY.

88
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:29,458
- NATSU, PLEASE, JUST ACCEPT THE
FLAMES I GAVE YOU AND MOVE ON.

89
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,500
- YOU MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST,

90
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,458
BUT THE REST OF US HAVEN'T.

91
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,875
I STILL REMEMBER EVERYTHING.

92
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,583
I'LL NEVER FORGET
THAT YOU MADE ERZA CRY.

93
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,416
- HOW PATHETIC.

94
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,208
IF YOU'RE GOING TO ARGUE,
MUST YOU DO IT IN FRONT OF ME?

95
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,166
QUIT WASTING MY TIME.

96
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,208
- ( Jellal grunting )

97
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:15,875
- WHY, JELLAL?

98
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,458
- ( panting )

99
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:25,208
JUST GO AHEAD AND KILL ME,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

100
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,750
I'M ALREADY BATTERED
AND TORN TO SHREDS.

101
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,291
BUT FIRST,

102
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:32,791
LET ME GIVE YOU THE POWER
YOU NEED TO DEFEAT HIM.

103
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,375
- I'VE NEVER SEEN
SUCH A GOLDEN FLAME.

104
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,458
- Narrator: TWO OF OUR OTHER
HEROES ARE WORKING THEIR WAY

105
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:46,125
TOWARDS LACRIMA NUMBER THREE.

106
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,333
- Happy: YOU WANNA TAKE A BREAK
TO CATCH YOUR BREATH?

107
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:51,791
- I CAN'T.
WE WON'T MAKE IT IN TIME.

108
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:56,250
- GUESS NOT.  BUT YOU'RE BARELY
ABLE TO WALK RIGHT NOW.

109
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,208
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
- DON'T WORRY, I'M FINE.

110
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:02,166
I MAY BE SLOW,
BUT I WILL GET THERE.

111
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,583
PLUS, HERE'S THE THING.

112
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,625
IF I STOP, I DON'T KNOW IF I--
WELL.

113
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,416
LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT THIS NOW.

114
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,791
WE'VE GOTTA STAY FOCUSED.

115
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,750
- ( grunting ) MAN.  MAN.  MAN.

116
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:18,958
- Narrator: IN THE PASSAGEWAY
TO LACRIMA NUMBER FOUR.

117
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,458
- THIS IS EXHAUSTING,
BUT IT'S THE ONLY WAY

118
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,708
I'LL GET THERE IN TIME.

119
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:28,250
I'M ICHIYA VANDALAY KOTOBUKI
OF BLUE PEGASUS.

120
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:31,833
I WILL FULFILL MY DUTY
TO MY GUILD.

121
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:34,208
- Narrator:
AT LACRIMA NUMBER FIVE.

122
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,833
- MASTER ZERO ISN'T HERE.
I KNEW IT.

123
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:41,833
HE MUST BE AT LACRIMA
NUMBER ONE AFTER ALL.

124
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,041
NATSU.

125
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,750
- THIS IS THE FLAME OF REBUKE.

126
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:59,333
- Narrator: IN THE PASSAGEWAY
TO LACRIMA NUMBER SIX.

127
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,208
- THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS,
CARLA.

128
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:08,166
I'M WORRIED.
I HOPE JELLAL'S OKAY.

129
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,875
- PERHAPS YOU SHOULD
BE MORE CONCERNED

130
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,416
WITH YOUR OWN WELL-BEING.
THIS WON'T BE EASY.

131
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,500
- ARE YOU SURE?

132
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,458
- YEAH. I'M THE ONE
WHO CAUSED THIS

133
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:18,000
SO I'LL DO WHATEVER I CAN
TO MAKE IT RIGHT.

134
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,583
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
ARE YOU NOT FEELING WELL?

135
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,708
- I'M FINE.

136
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,625
FORGIVE ME IF I'M WRONG,
BUT DON'T YOU USE HEALING MAGIC?

137
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,750
- NATSU'S GOING TO FACE ZERO.

138
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,500
SO HE'LL NEED HIS
ENERGY REPLENISHED.

139
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:39,500
THINK YOU CAN DO THAT FOR HIM?
- I'LL TRY.

140
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,333
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW
DRAINING USING HER HEALING MAGIC

141
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,291
CAN BE AND HOW MANY TIMES THIS
POOR GIRL HAD TO USE IT TODAY?

142
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,791
SORRY,
BUT I'M PUTTING MY FOOT DOWN.

143
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,750
- I UNDERSTAND.
- YOU DO?

144
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:52,916
- IT'S FINE.  I CAN REPLENISH
HIS ENERGY MYSELF.

145
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,000
I'VE GAINED A MEMORY.

146
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,833
I REMEMBER WHAT MAKES THIS
NATSU FELLOW SO SPECIAL.

147
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,625
HE HOLDS THE POWER OF HOPE.

148
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,416
IT'S A LOT TO ASK,

149
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,916
BUT I NEED YOU TO DESTROY
LACRIMA NUMBER SIX FOR ME.

150
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,166
- ME?  BUT I CAN'T.

151
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,250
- WHY MUST YOU DOUBT YOURSELF?
YOU'RE A DRAGON SLAYER.

152
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,291
YOUR MAGIC IS SO POWERFUL,
IT WAS ONCE USED AGAINST

153
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,291
THE MOST TERRIFYING DRAGONS
IN THE LAND.

154
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:25,000
CONSUME THE AIR--
NO, THE HEAVENS.

155
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,375
UNLEASH THE POWER
OF THE DRAGON

156
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,625
THAT LIES DORMANT
WITHIN YOU.

157
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,291
- I'LL DO MY BEST.

158
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:51,125
I'M GONNA UNLEASH MY POWER.
THE DRAGON INSIDE ME.

159
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,791
I HAVE TO,
TO PROTECT MY GUILD.

160
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:57,041
IF YOU CAN HEAR ME GRANDINA,
PLEASE LEND ME YOUR POWER.

161
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,958
- WENDY.

162
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:09,000
- WHAT'S THE FLAME OF REBUKE?

163
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,541
- I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO GRANT FORGIVENESS.

164
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,833
ALL I WANT IS TO GIVE YOU
STRENGTH,

165
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:18,458
BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN YOU.

166
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,791
ERZA TRUSTS YOU MORE
THAN ANYONE,

167
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:27,666
AND SO I SHALL AS WELL.

168
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:03,458
- ( grunting )
- WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU.

169
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,875
- THANKS FOR THE CHOW.

170
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,541
THIS DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE
OFF THE HOOK, JELLAL.  NOT YET.

171
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:22,958
- YOU'VE MADE A GRAVE MISTAKE.
BY EATING THE FLAME OF REBUKE,

172
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,083
YOU NOW SHARE THE SINS
OF YOUR MORTAL ENEMY.

173
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,291
- A COUPLE OF SINS
AIN'T GONNA SCARE ME.

174
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,750
EVERYONE IN FAIRY TAIL'S
GOT THEIR SHARE.

175
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,791
BUT THE REAL SIN IS TURNING YOUR
BACK ON SOMEONE

176
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,708
WHEN THEY JUST WANNA HELP.

177
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:38,750
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'LL GIVE
YOU THE POWER TO FIGHT EVIL.

178
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,125
- ( screams )

179
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:08,958
SO MUCH POWER.
NO, IT COULDN'T BE.

180
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:15,875
DRAGON FORCE.

181
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,750
- MAN, THAT LACRIMA IS
BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT.

182
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,000
THIS IS GONNA BE TOUGH.

183
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,458
- I SENSE A STRONG MAGIC POWER,
DO YOU?

184
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:31,083
- YEAH, THE LACRIMA
MUST BE CLOSE.

185
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:34,708
- I'VE CAUGHT A WHIFF
OF ITS PERILOUS PARFUM.

186
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,916
ALMOST THERE.  MAN!

187
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:41,083
- THE TIME DRAWS NEAR.

188
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,583
NATSU, I HAVE FAITH IN YOU.

189
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,750
- Carla: REMEMBER,
YOU HAVE TO STAY FOCUSED.

190
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,666
- I CAN DO IT.

191
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,708
NATSU.

192
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,916
- ( clamoring )

193
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,708
- OH, MAN.

194
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,375
IT'S LIKE WHEN I ATE
ALL THAT ETHERION.

195
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,750
AWESOME.
ALL OF A SUDDEN

196
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,333
IT FEELS LIKE MY STRENGTH'S BEEN
DOUBLED, MAYBE EVEN TRIPLED.

197
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,250
- I NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D HAVE IT.

198
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,625
DRAGON FORCE IS THE FINAL FORM
OF DRAGON SLAYER MAGIC.

199
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,833
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,

200
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,250
IT GIVES THE SLAYER DESTRUCTIVE
POWER COMPARABLE

201
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,083
TO THAT OF THE MOST
FORMIDABLE DRAGON.

202
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:59,208
I'M INTRIGUED.

203
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,541
SO SHOW ME.

204
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,166
- YOU SURE YOU WANT ME
TO DO THAT?

205
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,625
- YES.
LET'S SEE THE DRAGON'S POWER.

206
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,291
- ALL RIGHT, BUT I WARNED YOU.

207
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,833
- ( sobbing )

208
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,541
WE DID IT.
WE MADE IT TO THE LACRIMA.

209
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:27,583
- ARE YOU OKAY?
YOU GOTTA HANG IN THERE.

210
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:30,750
- HONESTLY, I DIDN'T WANT
TO ADMIT IT EARLIER.

211
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:34,208
I'M NOT SO SURE
I CAN EVEN DO THIS.

212
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,000
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

213
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,625
- WELL, I'M COMPLETELY OUT
OF MAGIC ENERGY.

214
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:46,166
BUT I'VE GOTTA DO WHATEVER I CAN
TO HELP PROTECT WENDY'S GUILD.

215
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,083
I DON'T WANNA LET
THE OTHERS DOWN.

216
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,750
THEY CAN'T WIN.

217
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,541
THE ORACION SEIS CAN'T BEAT US.

218
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,166
- LUCY!

219
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,833
- I'VE COME THIS FAR.

220
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,791
I'M NOT READY
TO THROW IN THE TOWEL.

221
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,833
- BE CAREFUL.

222
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,500
- I HAVE TO TRY MY HARDEST.

223
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,875
FOR THE MEMBERS
OF CAIT SHELTER.

224
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,750
FOR JELLAL, WHO TAUGHT ME
TO BELIEVE IN MYSELF.

225
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:18,708
FOR NATSU
AND ALL MY NEW FRIENDS.

226
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:28,041
- YOU'RE NO MATCH
FOR DARK GRAVITY.

227
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,250
- ( screams )

228
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:37,125
- DON'T TELL ME
I'VE ALREADY DEFEATED

229
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,708
THE MIGHTY DRAGON SLAYER.

230
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,458
WELL?

231
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,708
- NATSU.

232
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,625
- YIKES.  THAT WAS CLOSE.

233
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,083
- ZERO SLASH!

234
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,208
DARK DELETE!

235
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,333
- ( laughs )

236
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:59,541
- ( grunting ) MAN.  MAN. 
MAN. MAN.  MAN!

237
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:07,041
SO CLOSE.  I CANNOT BLACKOUT
AFTER I'VE MADE IT THIS FAR.

238
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:10,041
- HIBIKI, REN,

239
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:13,000
EVE, I ASK THAT
YOU LEND ME THE STRENGTH

240
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,125
TO GET THROUGH THIS.

241
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,208
- ( grunts )

242
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,083
- THREE MINUTES LEFT.

243
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,666
- NATSU.

244
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:51,375
- ( Zero grunting )

245
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:55,125
ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT'S THE
BEST YOUR DRAGON FORCE CAN DO?

246
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,833
DRAGONS ONCE RULED
THIS WORLD

247
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,833
AND THAT'S THE EXTENT OF
THEIR POWER?  WHAT A TRAVESTY!

248
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,791
- ( panting )

249
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,458
- SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
ANY IDEA?

250
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,958
- I DON'T KNOW.

251
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:14,458
BUT I WON'T GIVE UP.
I'LL THROW MYSELF AGAINST IT.

252
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:17,333
I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.

253
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,166
I MAY BE TIRED.

254
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,625
BUT NO MATTER WHAT,
I'LL DO WHAT I SAID I'D DO.

255
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:26,125
- WE'VE ALWAYS ADMIRED YOUR
DETERMINATION, MISS LUCY.

256
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,583
- ( gasps )

257
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:31,916
- PIRI, PIRI. WE ARE INSPIRED
BY YOUR RESOLVE.

258
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,500
- AND WE ARE DEEPLY MOVED
BY YOUR EMOTION.

259
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:37,000
- GEMINI.

260
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:41,291
WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE
YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

261
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,916
- ( both scream )

262
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,833
- WHEN WE COPY YOU, WE NOT ONLY
SHARE YOUR APPEARANCE,

263
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,541
BUT YOUR ABILITIES.

264
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,416
WE'RE PERFECTLY CAPABLE
OF DOING THE JOB FOR YOU.

265
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,750
- AYE!

266
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,875
- IN THREE MINUTES, WE'RE GONNA
SMASH THAT THING TO BITS.

267
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,958
- THANK YOU, GEMINI.

268
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:03,208
- MAN! MAN!
I FINALLY MADE IT.

269
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:07,333
NOW TO TAKE A WHIFF
OF MY PARFUM OF POWER.

270
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,500
( grunts )

271
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,791
- IT'S NOT QUITE ENOUGH.

272
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,458
I NEED MORE POWER
FROM THE HEAVENS.

273
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:29,291
- YOU CANNOT DEFEAT THE MASTER
OF THE ORACION SEIS.

274
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,916
I'M MORE POWERFUL THAN
A LOWLY GUILD WIZARD LIKE YOU

275
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,875
COULD EVER HOPE TO BE.

276
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,375
IT'S A SHAME YOUR FRIENDS
AREN'T HERE TO HELP YOU,

277
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,208
BECAUSE YOU DON'T STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST ME ON YOUR OWN.

278
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,625
- ( panting )

279
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,208
I'M NOT ON MY OWN.

280
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,833
EVERYONE'S REACHING OUT TO ME.

281
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:59,416
I CAN HEAR THEM
LOUD AND CLEAR.

282
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,833
I HEAR EVERYONE'S VOICES,
AND THEY'RE TELLING ME

283
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,375
THAT NO MATTER WHAT,

284
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,625
I CAN'T GIVE UP THE FIGHT.

285
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,291
THEY'RE WHAT KEEPS ME GOING.

286
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:15,208
THEY'RE THE ONLY REASON
I'M STILL STANDING RIGHT NOW.

287
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:28,000
- WELL, ALL RIGHT.

288
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,875
IT'S ABOUT TIME
TO PUT THIS THING ON ICE.

289
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:34,541
- OKAY, LET'S DO IT.
IS IT ALL RIGHT IF I USE TAURUS?

290
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,208
- SURE, GO AHEAD.

291
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:39,083
- YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET AN
IMPORTANT LESSON IN STRENGTH

292
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:43,125
AND DETERMINATION, COURTESY
OF THE BLUE PEGASUS GUILD.

293
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,583
- REQUIP!

294
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,916
- I CAN FEEL IT.

295
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,083
THE POWER WELLING UP
INSIDE OF ME.

296
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,500
- DEAR CHILD.

297
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,166
- THEY'RE SO STRONG.

298
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,083
I CAN FEEL MY FRIENDS'
DETERMINATION AND STRENGTH

299
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,833
PULSATING THROUGH ME!

300
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,583
- IF THERE WERE SOME WAY,

301
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:11,250
IF I COULD HARNESS THE POWER
OF YOUR DRAGON FORCE FOR MYSELF.

302
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:15,333
UNFORTUNATELY,
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

303
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:18,208
SINCE I HAVE NO USE FOR YOU, I
SHALL UNLEASH MY ULTIMATE SPELL

304
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,708
AND RETURN YOU
TO THE NOTHINGNESS

305
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:21,958
FROM WHENCE YOU CAME.

306
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,875
DRAGON SLAYER SECRET ART.

307
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:27,375
FLAME LOTUS,
EXPLODING FLAME BLADE!

308
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:31,250
GENESIS ZERO!
- ( screaming )

309
