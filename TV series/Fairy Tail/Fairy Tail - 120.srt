Chill out, Gajeel.

165
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,291
Whatever, it'll be a cinch!

166
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,291
'Cause I'm a
Lightning Flame Drag--

167
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,250
Hey, you alright?

168
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,291
Natsu!

169
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,250
Don't go passin'
out on me, ya wimp!

170
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,375
Fainting must be
a side effect of consuming

171
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,708
non-flame magic.

172
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,041
Anyway,
I think it's about time

173
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,625
we go back to base camp.

174
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,416
If we don't get some
rest soon our bodies won't

175
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,666
be able to hold up.

176
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,166
[ELFMAN]
You got a good point, lady cat.

177
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,458
[LISANNA]
Then Let's head back!

178
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:50,708
[LUCY]
Hey, wait!

179
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,375
Are you guys gonna
make me carry Natsu?!

180
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:55,375
Don't you worry, Lucy,
I'll be here to cheer you on!

181
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,750
So you'll cheer but
you won't help carry him?

182
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,625
[CAPRICORN]
May I be of assistance?

183
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,500
Please Allow me to
caaarry both of you, my lady.

184
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,875
Thank you, Capricorn...

185
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,125
I really appreciate your help.

186
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,750
[HAPPY] Natsu's getting' the
short end of the stick here!

187
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,875
Excuse me, Mr. Cat,
are you a guild-mate

188
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,250
of Lady Lucy's?

189
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,500
Aye, sir...!

190
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,625
I suppose you could say
that I'm her role model.

191
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,125
[CAPRICORN] Well in that case...

192
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,291
[CANA] What are the two of them
going on about back there?

193
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,250
[GRAY] I dunno but they seem
to be getting along great.

194
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,458
[CANA thinks]]
I hope my father's all right...

195
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,166
[GRAY thinks]
Juvia...

196
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,583
Makarov...

197
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,333
[HADES]
Why don't you finish me?

198
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,000
[MAKAROV]
Over the years...

199
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,541
I've learned
many things from you...

200
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,375
As thanks, I'm willing
to overlook what you've

201
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,041
done this time...

202
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:51,583
But you must leave
this island at once!

203
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,875
How can you
be so naïve, boy...?

204
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,750
If you let me live,
I shall return and when I do,

205
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,291
I'll crush your
guild completely.

206
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:02,583
You may have
defeated me in battle...

207
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,166
But you were
proven to be no match for

208
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,458
the children I've raised.

209
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,791
[HADES]
You're wrong...

210
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,583
I was weakened because
my heart was destroyed...

211
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:14,375
while those youngsters were
empowered by the Tenrou Tree...

212
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:17,208
It was merely a coincidence...

213
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:21,291
Otherwise, I never would have
lost to your "children"...

214
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,958
Never.

215
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:26,166
Why did you
fall to the dark side?

216
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,500
[HADES]
I told you once...

217
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:31,916
[HADES] Darkness is
the true nature of magic...

218
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,333
It is comprised of miracles
that were born in the shadows

219
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,291
and subsequently
brought into the light.

220
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:41,041
[HADES] After I retired
from Fairy Tail...

221
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:44,333
I began traveling down the
path of sorcery in the hopes of

222
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:48,625
learning the underlying
principles of the world.

223
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,916
[HADES] I learned that
the one we live in,

224
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,208
with its overflowing
magic, is a lie.

225
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:59,541
[HADES] The Grand Magic World
that Lord Zeref described

226
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,625
is the true world of magic.

227
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,791
[HADES] I wanted nothing more
than to see it for myself...

228
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,791
To make that happen,
I began collecting all of

229
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:13,041
the keys I needed to resurrect
the legendary black wizard.

230
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,666
[HADES]
I was so close...!

231
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,750
So incredibly close
to my dream...!

232
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:23,458
The primordial magic was
finally within my reach!

233
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,583
[MAKAROV] Even if your
dream had been realized,

234
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:30,041
it wouldn't change anything.

235
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,625
[MAKAROV] If magic's
true nature is darkness...

236
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,375
I can accept that.

237
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,541
[MAKAROV]
And if it's light...

238
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,208
I can accept that, too...

239
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,416
Because magic is alive...

240
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,166
So Its purpose is
ever-evolving with the times.

241
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,375
It grows, along
with the wizards who use it.

242
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,750
[MAKAROV] There's no definition
of magic because everyone

243
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,375
thinks of it differently...

244
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,208
It's as limitless
as your imagination...

245
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,458
It can become
darkness or light...

246
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,583
...depending on its caster.

247
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:05,083
[MAKAROV] Fairy Tail is free to
use magic however we choose.

248
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:11,083
[MAKAROV] These are all things I
learned from you, Master Precht.

249
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:34,916
[ELFMAN] How'm I supposed
to relax with Natsu

250
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,583
sawin' logs like that?!

251
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,291
Now, now, he needs
his rest as much as you.

252
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,458
[LISANNA] Hey, I just
thought of a great idea!

253
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,125
It's pigtail Natsu!

254
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,041
Isn't he the cutest?

255
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,750
That's So un-manly...

256
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,916
[HAPPY] I had no idea
that the thing we destroyed

257
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,708
was Hades' heart, did you?

258
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,375
Nope, it was
just a lucky break,

259
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,000
but we did a good job.

260
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,416
I suppose if you
could consider that

261
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,125
the ship's power source...

262
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:01,458
then the Exceed Squad completed
our mission exactly as planned.

263
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,583
That's true!

264
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:03,750
[HAPPY]
Aye, Sir!

265
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,750
[GAJEEL] Lily!
You ain't wounded are ya?!

266
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,875
Well, Not as bad
as you appear to be.

267
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,166
We missed ya, Laxus...!

268
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,083
Welcome back!

269
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,583
[TOMMEN A]
welcome back!

270
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,875
I think you're getting'
ahead of yourself there, pal.

271
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,083
I can't hold
back my tears of joy!

272
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,291
Come on...

273
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,875
[EVERGREEN]
Laxus...

274
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,333
You wouldn't believe all of the
terrible things that Elfman

275
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,750
did to me while you were gone!

276
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:22,875
Would you please punish him?

277
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:23,833
Why, You little-!

278
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:24,833
Oh, yeah...?

279
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,041
So when did you two hook up?

280
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,791
We didn't!
I mean, not like that!

281
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,041
It's kinda hard to explain!

282
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,416
What in the hell
is that supposed to mean?!

283
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,125
Excuse me, Lady Lucy...

284
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,583
I should really be going now.

285
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,708
I can't thank you enough
for all your help today.

286
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,625
I'll be counting
on you in the future.

287
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,208
And I, you...

288
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:45,583
I endeavor to become
your most vaaaluable Spirit.

289
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:46,875
[CAPRICORN]
By the way...

290
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,541
No, never mind...

291
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,791
Aw c'mon, there's no
reason for you to hold back,

292
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,041
just tell me!

293
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,625
[CAPRICORN]
In thaat case...

294
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,458
[CAPRICORN] While carrying
you earlier, I couldn't help

295
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,333
but notice you're
on the heavy side...

296
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,666
I think it would be a good idea
for you to lose some weight

297
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,000
to improve your health
and your maaaagic power...

298
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,000
If you'd like, I can help
you regulate your diet by

299
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,041
cutting down on faaaatty
meat and sweets.

300
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,291
On second thought,

301
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,750
maybe you should hold
back a little, okay?!

302
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:10,791
That was harsh.

303
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:11,750
Oh, wow...!

304
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,833
I feel so much better!!

305
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,958
You want me to take
care of your wounds next,?

306
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,791
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine...

307
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,291
You could probably
use some down time.

308
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,875
Nah...

309
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,875
I can't tell you how
amazing I feel now that

310
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,375
the Tenrou Tree's
back to normal.

311
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,583
[FRIED] I know I'm crying like
a baby but I can't help it!

312
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:30,833
[ERZA]
It's odd...

313
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,291
I don't understand how
the tree could come back

314
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,000
after being destroyed.

315
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,166
[GRAY]
Ultear...?

316
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,750
Nah, it couldn't be...

317
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:42,583
Someone's there!

318
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:43,833
Show yourself now!

319
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,416
It's just me!
Please don't attack!

320
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,833
Wait, Juvia?!

321
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,375
Geez, What happened
to you?!

322
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:50,958
I'm so sorry!

323
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:54,458
I tried to catch Zeref but he
ended up getting away from me!

324
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,333
Someone's gonna
have to punish me...!

325
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,583
C'mon, Gray...!

326
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,416
Go ahead and spank me
as much as you want...!

327
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,125
Please!

328
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,208
Thanks but no thanks!

329
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,291
I'm not really into that stuff!

330
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,958
[JUVIA] But I've
been a bad, bad girl!

331
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,666
[PANTHERLILY]
Okay, that's enough.

332
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,458
So all we're
missing is Gildarts...

333
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,291
Guess so...

334
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,666
I wouldn't worry...

335
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,333
I'm sure he's just fine.

336
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,291
[ELFMAN] C'mon Laxus,
be a real man!

337
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,791
[CANA]
Dad...

338
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,416
[GILDARTS] So let
me get this straight...

339
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,625
You screwed up so bad you got
expelled by your grandpa...?!

340
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:24,750
Man, you're so lame!

341
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,625
Well, I ain't half
as lame as you are!

342
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:36,875
There you are, Gildarts...!

343
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:37,916
Come and fight me--

344
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,375
You need your rest, kid.

345
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,708
He's out now.

346
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:42,750
[GRAY] Hey...!
No...!

347
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,541
Stop...! Please...!

348
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,041
Quit!

349
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,208
[GRAY] I already told you
I'm not into that kinda stuff!

350
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,291
Hey Wendy, can I
get a little help here?

351
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,708
You've gotta
wait your turn, Natsu.

352
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:51,958
Yeah, man up.

353
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,708
You can go next,
Lily, 'cause I'm more worried

354
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:54,916
about you than me.

355
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,250
Well, I don't see why,
because you're

356
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,708
the one who's covered in
bandages from head to toe.

357
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,375
Uh-oh, it looks
like you've got quite a line

358
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,333
forming now.

359
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,833
Oh, I don't mind at all...!

360
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,208
I'm just happy to be able
to help out somehow!

361
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,125
That's fine but
don't overdo it child.

362
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,916
[ERZA]
I can take over for you.

363
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,166
[WENDY]
You look amazing, Erza!

364
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,041
But why are you
dressed up like a nurse?!

365
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,333
[CARLA] Wait a minute; you
don't have any healing powers!

366
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,041
That's true, but
differences in ability

367
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,791
don't matter in battle...

368
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,916
It's our hearts
that will be tested.

369
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,333
Whaddya mean "battle"?!

370
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,500
Now look
what you've done!

371
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,291
You've scared the
poor girl half to death!

372
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,791
This can't end well...

373
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,458
[ERZA] All right gentlemen,
who's up next...?

374
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,625
If you'll tell me where it
hurts, I can decide whether

375
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,041
I should take your temperature
first or just go ahead and

376
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,500
give you an injection.

377
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:38,833
Does she really
think we're gonna fall for

378
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,458
the "hot nurse" routine?

379
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,791
We ain't that hard up.

380
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,416
Hey! What do you
think you're doin'?!

381
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,708
No cutting!

382
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:45,958
I'm the one who was
knockin' on death's door,

383
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:46,500
after all.

384
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,875
Stupid boys!

385
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,791
Aw c'mon, look on the
bright side Wendy, at least

386
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,666
you get to take a break
for a little while...

387
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,958
right?

388
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,000
Is it because she
has bigger boobs than I do?

389
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,541
It would appear that
tying bandages is much more

390
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,041
difficult than one might think.

391
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:00,875
Ow...!

392
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,541
Are you tryin' to kill us?!

393
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:03,958
[JUVIA]
I'm in shock...!

394
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,208
I can't believe I've been
begging Gray to punish me

395
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,083
and he's the one who
likes to be punished...!

396
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,291
I'm such an idiot!

397
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,458
Gajeel!

398
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,416
All of a sudden it feels
as though our battle

399
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,791
against Grimoire Heart...

400
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,291
...was in the distant past.

401
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,500
I'm afraid that
it always ends this way...

402
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,208
Yup, that's just how
things work in Fairy Tail!

403
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,750
[MIRAJANE] Master,
what do you wanna do

404
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,250
about the S-Class trial?

405
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,333
[MAKAROV]
Ah, good question!

406
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,916
I think we should head back to
the guild to clear our heads

407
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,500
a little bit before
we pick back up again.

thought we'd be defeated...

I still can't
believe it's over.

right before our very eyes...

We let the Grand Magic World
slip through our fingers!
