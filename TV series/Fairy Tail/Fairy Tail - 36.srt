1
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:21,000
- HEY GUYS! READY FOR SOME MORE
FAIRY TAIL? JUST MAKE SURE THAT

2
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:23,375
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING YOU TURN
THE LIGHTS ON IN THE ROOM,

3
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:27,291
AND DON'T SIT TOO CLOSE
TO THE TV!

4
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,750
( he laughs )

5
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:32,833
- OH MAN, HAPPY'S GONNA
FREAK WHEN HE SEES ME!

6
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:36,958
MAYBE I CAN SCARE
ERZA WHILE I'M AT IT!

7
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:40,500
WAIT. I KNOW LUCY'S TOTALLY
GONNA JUMP OUT OF HER SKIN, 

8
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,458
IT'LL BE HILARIOUS!

9
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:46,166
- END OF THE ROAD FOR YOU, BOY.

10
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,291
- SOMETHING'S INTERFERING
WITH MY COMMUNICATION

11
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,791
WITH WALLY AND MILLIANA!

12
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,125
-I CAN'T EVEN TELL
WHERE THEY ARE NOW.

13
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:26,583
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

14
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:29,875
- HE'S TALKING ABOUT
TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION.

15
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,791
- IS SOMETHING THE MATTER, SHO?

16
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:41,458
- I'M FINE. EVERYTHING'S FINE
NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE.

17
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,708
- HEAVEN'S GAME!

18
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,125
- JUVIA, ARE YOU
ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN

19
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,666
THAT WE CAN TRUST THIS GUY?

20
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,541
I MEAN, I UNDERSTAND THAT
HE WASN'T ACTUALLY

21
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,500
TRYIN' TO KILL US BACK
AT THE RESORT, BUT STILL.

22
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:02,208
- I WON'T MAKE EXCUSES
FOR MY ACTIONS.

23
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,375
- I DIDN'T THINK
YOU COULD HEAR ME.

24
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:07,000
- ANY WIZARD WHO WAS INCAPABLE
OF SURVIVING THAT

25
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:10,250
WOULD NEVER HAVE
A PRAYER AGAINST JELLAL.

26
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:13,375
I NEVER DOUBTED THAT NATSU
COULD HANDLE THE ATTACK.

27
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,333
I WAS CONFIDENT
HE WOULD SURVIVE.

28
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,875
- OH YEAH, WELL WHAT ABOUT ME?

29
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,166
- NONE OF YOU CAN COMPREHEND

30
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,625
THE FULL EXTENT OF
NATSU'S ABILITY.

31
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,583
ONCE HE AWAKENS THE TRUE
DRAGON'S POWER WITHIN,

32
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,750
EVIL WILL FALL IN HIS WAKE!

33
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,375
- ( he sneezes )

34
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,250
- UGH! I CAN'T WIPE
MY FACE! GROSS!

35
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:34,166
I SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE
THIS OFF FOR A SEC.

36
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,916
COME ON YOU STUPID MASK!

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
- LET ME GIVE YA A HAND, PAL.

38
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,125
- WHAT THE--?
- NO!

39
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,208
- HEY, CUT IT OUT,
WOULD YA, MILLIANNA!

40
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,083
- IT'S THE BLOCKHEAD!

41
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,708
- WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA?

42
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,250
- YOU BIG OL MEANIE!

43
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,375
YOU WERE TRYING TO HURT
THE ITTY-BITTY-KITTY-WITTY!

44
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:54,041
- WAIT A SEC, THAT'S NOT EVEN A
REAL CAT, YOU CRAZY BROAD!

45
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,625
- MEOW!

46
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,250
- HE IS JUST THE CUTEST...
- A WISE GUY, EH?

47
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:04,041
- I'M TELLIN' YA DOLL,
THIS CAT IS A RAT, SEE?

48
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,333
- WHOA!

49
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,750
CAT MAKE BARRIER!

50
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,458
- NO, DON'T HURT
THE POOR KITTY!

51
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:16,875
- FOR CRYIN' OUT LOUD, DOLLFACE,
THIS DIRTY RAT IS OUR ENEMY.

52
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,083
MEOW!

53
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,833
- DIRTY RAT? IT LOOKS
LIKE A KITTY TO ME.

54
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,208
- IT'S A GUY IN A CAT COSTUME,
YA DIMWIT!

55
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,416
- MEOW!

56
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,750
- CAT FIRE!

57
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,958
DRAT! I GUESS JELLAL WASN'T
PULLING MY LEG WHEN HE TOLD ME

58
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:39,708
THIS CAT'S GOT SOME REAL CLAWS.
ALRIGHT, TOOTS. IT'S GO TIME!

59
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,625
- PRETENDING TO BE A CAT WHEN
YOU'RE REALLY JUST A PERSON

60
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,083
IS A LOUSY THING TO DO.

61
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,833
- OH YEAH? YOU'RE ONE TO TALK!

62
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:48,041
- BAD KITTY RESTRAINT TUBE!

63
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,916
- THAT'S GIVING HIM
THE BRACELETS THERE, DOLL!

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,375
- IT'S TIME TO PUT THE BAD
LITTLE KITTY TO SLEEP!

65
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,416
- HE'S IN THE BAG!

66
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,416
- CAT FIRE! HEY!

67
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:06,083
HOW COME I CAN'T USE MY MAGIC?
IS IT 'CAUSE OF THIS THING?

68
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,875
- FAKE KITTIES MAKE ME MAD!

69
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,333
- I HOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY,
SALAMANDER,

70
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,166
CAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT TA EAT LEAD.

71
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,375
- OH MAN, THIS IS NOT GOOD!

72
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,791
- EARS UP! I GOT A REAL DANDY

73
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,041
CATCHPHRASE I'VE BEEN
DYIN' TO TRY OUT.

74
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,458
TOO BAD THINGS
HADDA END DIS WAY.

75
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,666
BUT FROM THE MOMENT YOU MET ME--

76
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,416
- THAT YOU, HAPPY?

77
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,583
- YOU BETCHA!
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE SAFE!

78
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,500
BUT WHAT'S UP WITH
THE CAT COSTUME?

79
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,416
- JUST GET THIS THING OFFA ME!

80
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,000

- LOOK PAL, NO ONE INTERRUPTS
WALLY AND LIVES TA TELL DA TALE!

82
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,791
- NO! I WON'T LET YOU HURT
THE WITTLE KITTY WITTY!

83
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,416
- CAT'S AIN'T NO FLYERS!

84
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,666
AND THEY AIN'T NO STINKIN
GUM FLAPPERS NEITHER!

85
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,333
- C'MON LIL BUDDY, UNTIE ME!

86
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,666
- AYE, SIR!

87
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,875
- EAT THIS!
- DON'T DO IT, WALLY!

88
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,750
- LEMME GO, YOU LOONY TOON!

89
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,291
- HURRY IT UP!
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME!

90
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:05,291
- I CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW
TO GET THIS STUPID THING LOOSE!

91
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:08,625
- CRAP! WELL, THEN I GUESS
I GOT NO OTHER CHOICE!

92
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,333
SPECIAL ATTACK!

93
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:16,833
SAD KITTY FACE! MEOW!

94
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,875
MEOW.

95
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,666
- WHOA! IT REALLY WORKED?

96
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,791
- WHY IN THE HELL D'YA
LET HIM GO YA DINGBAT?

97
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,458
- THE POOR WITTLE
KITTY LOOKED SO SAD.

98
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,333
- AW, FOR CRYIN OUT LOUD!

99
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:37,375
- I'M A FREE MAN!
- YEAH! GET 'EM NATSU!

100
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:41,208
- FIRE DRAGON WING ATTACK!

101
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:48,083
YOU MESS WITH THE KITTY!
YOU GET THE CLAWS!

102
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:51,250
- SO HOW LONG ARE YOU GONNA
WEAR THAT THING?

103
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,333
- 'TIL I CAN GET IT OFF.

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,166
( he chuckles )

105
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,541
- SHO AND SIMON HAVE
CHOSEN TO BETRAY ME.

106
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,208
AND IT APPEARS THAT WALLY AND
MILLIANNA HAVE FALLEN

107
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,458
AT THE HANDS OF SALAMANDER.

108
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:23,833
THIS IS HOW THE GAME SHOULD
BE PLAYED. ONE-SIDED MATCHES

109
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,958
ARE ALWAYS SO DREADFULLY BORING.

110
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:29,250
- BUT MASTER, ERZA MUST BE
CAPTURED AT ONCE

111
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,875
SO WE CAN BEGIN THE CEREMONY.

112
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:34,000
I'M AFRAID THE TIME FOR
PLAYING GAMES IS OVER NOW.

113
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:37,875
- PRUDENT AS ALWAYS,
VIDALDUS. FETCH HER.

114
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,791
- YOU'LL ALLOW ME?

115
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:44,708
- IT IS OUR TURN, AFTER ALL.

116
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:07,291
ASSASSINS FROM
THE DEATH'S HEAD ORDER.

117
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,875
VIDALDUS TAKA.

118
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:12,291
- GO TO HELL! YEAH,
THAT'S RIGHT!

119
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,875
THEY CAN SAY THEIR PRAYERS
IF THEY WANNA,

120
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,791
BUT THEY'RE ALL GONNA BE
BURNIN' IN HELL TONIGHT!

121
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,375
- FUKURO.

122
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,666
- ( hoots )

123
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:26,041
- AND THEIR LEADER, IKARUGA.

124
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,875
- LIFE IS A FLOWER.

125
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:31,875
FATED TO BE CUT DOWN AND
SCATTERED ON THE GROUND BELOW.

126
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,541
SO TONIGHT, WE MAKE MERRY.

127
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,708
WE ARE ASSASSINS HAILING FROM
THE DEATH'S HEAD ORDER GUILD.

128
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:44,125
THE SPECIAL FORCES SQUAD,
KNOWN AS TRINITY RAVEN,

129
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,250
IS AT YOUR SERVICE, SIR.

130
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:50,875
- IT'S TIME YOU ENTERED
THE FRAY. NOW, GO!

131
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,875
- HEY, HAPPY?

132
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,250
- YEAH, WHAT?

133
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,500
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
PULL HARDER THAN THAT!

134
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:06,833
- I'M PULLIN' AS HARD AS I CAN

135
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,666
BUT I CAN'T SEEM TO GET
THE STUPID THING TO BUDGE!

136
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,833
- IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE
GONNA RIP MY HEAD OFF!

137
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,625
SWEET FREEDOM!

138
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,958
HEY LOOK, NOW IT'S STUCK
ON OL' BOXY!

139
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,791
- I'M AMAZED THAT
MASK WAS ABLE TO FIT

140
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,166
OVER HIS GIANT, SQUARE HEAD!

141
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,250
- THIS DANCE AIN'T OVER
YET, SALAMANDER!

142
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,916
- WELL, I ALREADY
GOT MY PAYBACK,

143
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,625
AND SINCE ERZA AND
HAPPY ARE SAFE,

144
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,875
THERE'S NO REASON FOR ME
TO KEEP WASTIN' MY TIME

145
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,083
WITH YOU, PAL.

146
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,083
- AYE, YOU TELL 'EM!

147
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:41,291
- TALK ALL YA WANT BUT WE'RE
STILL GONNA GET TA HEAVEN!

148
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,750
JELLAL TOLD US WE'D FINALLY
HAVE REAL FREEDOM--

149
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:49,708
--IN A WORLD WHERE PALOOKAS
LIKE US ARE CALLIN' THE SHOTS.

150
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,166
- I WELCOME YOU TO
THE TOWER OF HEAVEN.

151
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,666
AND THERE HE IS!

152
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,666
- MY NAME IS JELLAL AND I AM
THE RULER OF THIS TOWER.

153
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,958
I SEE THE PLAYERS
HAVE BEEN ARRANGED.

154
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,208
- SAY WHAT?

155
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,000
- SO HE KNOWS WE'RE HERE.

156
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:08,791
HE COULD BE LURKING ANYWHERE
IN THE TOWER, WAITING FOR US.

157
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,291
- I'M DELIGHTED YOU'VE COME
ALL THIS WAY TO SEE ME.

158
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,958
SHALL WE PLAY A ROUND
OF HEAVEN'S GAME?

159
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,541
- I DON'T WANNA
PLAY YOUR GAMES!

160
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,083
- WHADDAYA MEAN, JELLAL?

161
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,291
- THE RULES ARE
REALLY QUITE SIMPLE.

162
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,916
I WISH TO USE ERZA
AS A SACRIFICE

163
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,916
IN MY CEREMONY TO
RESURRECT LORD ZEREF.

164
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,666
- NO, I WON'T LET YOU.

165
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,500
- IF I SUCCEED, THE GATES OF
HEAVEN WILL OPEN,

166
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,166
CROWNING MY VICTORY.

167
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,250
- HOWEVER, IF YOU CAN MANAGE
TO FIND A WAY TO STOP ME,

168
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,250
YOU'LL BE THE WINNERS
OF THE GAME.

169
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,875
TO MAKE THINGS
A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING,

170
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:46,583
I'VE ENLISTED THREE KNIGHTS
TO BATTLE ON MY BEHALF.

171
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,333
- THREE KNIGHTS?
WHO COULD THEY BE?

172
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,750
- THE ONLY WAY YOU'LL
BE ABLE TO GET TO ME

173
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,708
IS IF YOU CAN DEFEAT THEM.

174
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:58,333
IN OTHER WORDS, A
THREE-ON-EIGHT BATTLE ROYALE.

175
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,791
AND THERE'S ONE MORE SURPRISE.

176
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,250
THE MAGIC COUNCIL HAS
THE SATELLITE SQUARE

177
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,083
FOCUSED DIRECTLY ON THIS TOWER

178
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,708
AND IT'S HIGHLY LIKELY
THEY WILL ATTACK.

179
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,541
AT THIS VERY MOMENT,

180
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,375
THEY'RE IN THE MIDST
OF VOTING ON WHETHER

181
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,916
THEY SHOULD FIRE
AN ETHERION BLAST.

182
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,666
- HEY, THAT WASN'T IN THE
DEAL, YOU HOODED FREAK!

183
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,166
IF THAT THING HITS US,
WE'LL ALL BE GOIN' TO HELL!

184
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,416
- NOW, NOW, VIDALDUS.

185
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,541
YOU WOULDN'T BE HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS?

186
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,666
- NOT ON YOUR LIFE, BOSS!
FINALLY. HA!

187
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,875
THIS IS THE RUSH I'VE
BEEN LOOKIN' FOR!

188
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,958
A REAL DANGEROUS THRILL RIDE
TO GET MY BLOOD PUMPIN'!

189
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,833
- THERE'S NO TELLING
HOW MUCH TIME IS LEFT.

190
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,333
SHOULD THE ETHERION STRIKE,

191
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:42,333
COMPLETE ANNIHILATION
IS IMMINENT.

192
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:45,291
NO PLAYERS LEFT TO WIN;
GAME OVER.

193
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,083
- WHAT KINDA MESSED UP GAME
IS THIS?

194
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,375
- BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY
SENSE TO ME.

195
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:53,250
WHY WOULD THE MAGIC COUNCIL
RESORT TO SUCH DRASTIC MEASURES?

196
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,875
- ERZA!

197
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,416
- WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

198
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,375
- NOW, THEN. LET THE GAME BEGIN.

199
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,833
- I WON'T LET HIM
LAY A FINGER ON HER!

200
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,958
- LET ME OUT OF HERE!

201
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:14,041
- I'LL BEAT JELLAL ALL BY
MYSELF IF I HAVE TO!

202
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,500
- NO! YOU CAN'T DO IT ALONE!

203
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,958
- ALL RIGHT,
NOW I'M ALL FIRED UP!

204
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,041
- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO TO
THE VERY TOP OF THE TOWER

205
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,166
TO FIND THIS JELLAL
GUY, AREN'T WE?

206
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,500
- BUT WHY WOULD HE
WANNA DO THIS TO US?

207
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,375
IF THEY REALLY FIRE THAT THING,

208
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,666
IT'S GONNA BE CURTAINS
FOR EVERYBODY.

209
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,125
WE WERE ALL JUST A BUNCH
OF STUPID KIDS LOOKING

210
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,958
FOR OUR OWN LITTLE
TASTE OF FREEDOM.

211
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:39,791
- I DUNNO WHAT KIND OF FREEDOM
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN LOOKIN FOR--

212
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:44,250
--BUT WHAT WE'VE GOT AT FAIRY
TAIL IS PRETTY AWESOME.

213
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:47,041
HEY HAPPY! I'M NOT FEELIN'
THIS GAME SO HOW ABOUT

214
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,541
WE BEND THE RULES?
- AYE, SIR!

215
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,041
- LET'S SKIP AHEAD
AND GO STRAIGHT

216
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:55,333
TO THE FINISH LINE, BUDDY!
- AYE SIR!

217
00:12:56,541 --> 00:13:00,041
- HE'S A STAND-UP GUY.

218
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:04,833
AND THAT'S A DANDY
LOOKIN' SCARF!

219
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,500
SOMETHIN'S COMIN' THIS WAY.

220
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,833
WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS THAT?

221
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,083
- SALAMANDER IT'S YOU!

222
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,791
- HUH? WHO THE HECK'S
YELLIN' AT ME NOW?

223
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,375
- YOU'D BETTER WATCH
OUT FOR THIS GUY!

224
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,333
HE'S ONE OF THAT
BLOCKHEAD'S BUDDIES!

225
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:47,166
- OH YEAH? THAT MEANS HE'S
WITH THAT CREEP JELLAL!

226
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,750
- I'M NOT! TRUST
ME I'M ON YOUR SIDE!

227
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,416
THIS WHOLE TIME I'VE JUST
BEEN PRETENDING TO BE UNDER

228
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
THAT LUNATIC'S SPELL!

229
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,166
IT WAS THE ONLY WAY
I'D BE ABLE TO STOP HIM!

230
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,791
- WE DON'T BELIEVE YOU!

231
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:02,083
- HOLD ON. IS THAT
REALLY THE TRUTH?

232
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,458
- YES.

233
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,875
- SO WHO IS THIS
JELLAL GUY ANYWAY?

234
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,125
AND WHY'S HE MAKIN' US PLAY

235
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,583
THIS RIDICULOUS GAME IN
THE FIRST PLACE?

236
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,666
- HE'S GOT A TWISTED
SENSE OF HUMOR.

237
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,250
HE'S THE TWIN BROTHER
OF SIEGRAIN,

238
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,916
A MEMBER OF THE
MAGIC COUNCIL.

239
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,833
I ASSUME THAT'S HOW HE
KNOWS THEY'RE PLANNING

240
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,250
TO FIRE THE ETHERION.

241
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,500
- SO THIS IS ALL JUST A FIGHT
BETWEEN TWO BROTHERS?

242
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,041
- IT'S POSSIBLE.

243
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,916
I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS
OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP

244
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,875
OR WHETHER THEY ARE AT ODDS.

245
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,666
NO, IT CAN'T BE!

246
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,125
- I WILL NOT TOLERATE
THE BREAKING OF RULES!

247
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,958
NOW PREPARE YOURSELVES
TO BE PUNISHED

248
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,916
IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE!

249
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,791
FUKURO, THE KNIGHT OF TRUE
JUSTICE, HAS ARRIVED!

250
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,083
- A BIRD?

251
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,333
- YEAH, SOME KINDA WEIRD
JUSTICE BIRD!

252
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,791
- OH NO! DARK MOMENT!

253
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,333
- OH GREAT,
NOW I CAN'T EVEN SEE!

254
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,416
- I KNEW WE NEVER SHOULD HAVE
TRUSTED THAT GUY!

255
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,666
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

256
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,166
WE DON'T STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST THE OWL!

257
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,250
- HA!

258
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,708
- EVEN IN THE DARKNESS,

259
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,458
THE LIGHT OF JUSTICE
SHINES THROUGH!

260
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,375
HOO HO HOO!

261
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,083
YOU SEE?

262
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,583
- HEY MAN, ARE YOU DOIN' OKAY?

263
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,708
- THESE GUYS MEAN BUSINESS.

264
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,000
THEY'RE ASSASSINS FROM
THE DEATH'S HEAD ORDER!

265
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,291
- ASSASSINS HAVE GUILDS, TOO?

266
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,166
- THEY BELONG TO ONE
OF THE DARK GUILDS.

267
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,666
THEY REFUSE TO TAKE
ON REGULAR JOBS.

268
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,916
THEY MAKE THEIR LIVING BY
ACCEPTING REQUESTS THAT INVOLVE

269
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,958
USING THEIR MAGIC
TO TAKE LIVES FOR MONEY.

270
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:34,875
THE WIZARDS WE'RE UP AGAINST
ARE KNOWN AS TRINITY RAVEN.

271
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,250
THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR KILLING

272
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,041
EVERY SINGLE OFFICER
IN THE WESTERN ARMY

273
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:41,083
DURING THE CABRIA WAR.
THEIR POWER IS LEGENDARY.

274
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,833
- SO YOU'RE TELLING
US THAT BIRDBRAIN HERE

275
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,916
IS ACTUALLY SOME
KIND OF SUPER KILLER?

276
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,500
- HOO HOO HOO! AND IF
YOU'RE EVIL, WE'LL KILL YOU!

277
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,708
- THEY ARE PROFESSIONAL
ASSASSINS!

278
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,416
YOU CANNOT DEFEAT THEM!

279
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,083
- NOW SALAMANDER.
WORD BACK AT OUR GUILD

280
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,583
IS THAT YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE
FOR MANY EVIL DEEDS.

281
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,666
IT'S MY DUTY AS A
KNIGHT OF JUSTICE

282
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,416
TO SEE THAT YOU ARE PUNISHED!

283
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,041
- MAGIC GUILDS ARE SUPPOSED

284
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,416
TO BRING LIKE-MINDED
PEOPLE TOGETHER

285
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,125
SO THEY CAN SHARE THEIR DREAMS.

286
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,041
THEY'RE NOT PLACES FOR
KILLERS LIKE YOU TO TEAM UP!

287
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,625
- DON'T DO IT, SALAMANDER!
I'M TELLING YOU,

288
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,708
THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN BEAT HIM!

289
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,625
- I HATE IT THAT THERE
ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE

290
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,041
WHO WILL PAY SOMEONE
TO COMMIT MURDER!

291
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:22,041
I HATE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO WILL KILL FOR MONEY.

292
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:25,208
AND I HATE THAT YOU'RE TALKING
LIKE YOU'RE IN A REAL GUILD.

293
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,833
SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO
TAKE YOU DOWN A NOTCH!

294
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,875
HEAR ME BIRDBRAIN? LET'S DANCE!

295
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,875
- OH LITTLE SALAMANDER,
YOU ARE STILL SO NAIVE.

296
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,416
I'M DOING THIS WORLD A
GREAT SERVICE BY DESTROYING

297
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,208
THOSE WHO COMMIT EVIL
DEEDS. THRUSTERS!

298
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,916
AND SINCE YOU ARE AN EVILDOER!
YOU MUST BE DESTROYED!

299
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,041
JET! HOO!

300
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,958
- NATSU!

301
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,416
- YOU THINK YOU CAN
FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE?

302
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,166
AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN,
YA DODO BIRD!

303
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:01,208
- HOO HOO!
ONCE MORE! THRUSTERS!

304
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,750
THROW!

305
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,041
- NATSU!

306
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,416
- NOW THAT HURT.

307
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,750
- IMPRESSIVE.

308
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,083
YOU'RE A LOT STRONGER
THAN I EXPECTED YOU TO BE!

309
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:21,375
THIS JOB MAY ACTUALLY PROVE
TO BE REAL CHALLENGE FOR ONCE!

310
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:25,375
- I KNEW THEY'D BE TOUGH TO
BE BEAT BUT I HAD NO IDEA.

311
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,833
AND THERE ARE STILL
TWO MORE MEMBERS.

312
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,416
- SHAME ON YOU, SIMON.

313
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,791
DEFEATED SO EASILY AT
THE START OF THE GAME.

314
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,958
OUR NEXT MATCH IS FUKURO
VERSUS NATSU DRAGNEEL.

315
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:45,875
I WAS VERY MUCH LOOKING
FORWARD TO FACING HIM MYSELF.

316
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:49,416
BUT THE ODDS DO
NOT LOOK PROMISING.

317
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,916
- NATSU?

318
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,041
- SALAMANDER!

319
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:56,458
- NATSU? AW MAN.
HE'S GOT EARS LIKE A DOG,

320
00:17:56,541 --> 00:18:01,083
SO HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HEAR US
CALLING NO MATTER WHERE HE IS.

321
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,875
- AH, THEN HE'S JUST LIKE GAJEY.

322
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,916
DOES HE HAVE A
KEEN NOSE AS WELL?

323
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,375
- GAJEY, HUH?

324
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,000
- I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY I WAS
CHOSEN TO SEARCH ALONGSIDE

325
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,875
THIS BLONDE BIMBO
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

326
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:15,291
- GIMME A BREAK. IT'S NOT LIKE
I WANNA WORK WITH YOU EITHER.

327
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,750
- I'M GONNA RESCUE
ERZA FROM SHO.

328
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,250
I'M COUNTING ON YOU
LADIES TO FIND NATSU.

329
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,875
PLEASE DON'T LET ME DOWN,
MY DEAREST JUVIA.

330
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,458
- I'LL GLADLY DO ANYTHING MY
BELOVED GRAY ASKS OF ME,

331
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:26,791
BUT DOESN'T
HE REALIZE

332
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,541
THAT LEAVING TWO ROMANTIC
RIVALS ALONE TOGETHER

333
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,541
IS A RECIPE FOR A BLOODBATH?

334
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,208
- I'VE TOLD YOU A HUNDRED TIMES,
I HAVE NO INTEREST IN HIM--

335
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,916
NOW CAN WE DROP THIS
AND START LOOKIN' FOR NATSU?

336
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,583
( loud and shrill sound )

337
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,875
WHAT IS MAKING THAT
AWFUL NOISE? IS IT A GUITAR?

338
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,500
IT'S SO LOUD!

339
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,666
- I ACTUALLY THINK IT SOUNDS
PRETTY COOL.

340
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,708
- YOU HAVE GOT SOME
MAJOR ISSUES, GIRL.

341
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,625
- YOU BABES DIG
MY DESTRUCTION SOLO?

342
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,000
CHECK OUT THE HAIR!

343
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,416
- I'M AN ASSASSIN WITH
THE DEATH'S HEAD ORDER!

344
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,083
PRETTY ROCKIN' NAME, HUH?

345
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,291
A "DEATH HEAD" IS
LIKE A SKULL, GET IT?

346
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,083
- I TAKE IT YOU'RE ONE OF THE
THREE KNIGHTS JELLAL SPOKE OF?

347
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,416
- I'M A WING OF
THE TRINITY RAVEN!

348
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,916
WHEN THEY SCREAM "VIDALDUS TAKA"

349
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,875
THEY'RE TALKIN' ABOUT ME!
ROCK YOU!

350
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:47,500
WHOA, THAT'S ONE CRAZY
BODY YOU GOT THERE! HEH.

351
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:51,875
- IT'S MADE ENTIRELY OF WATER.
DRIP, DRIP, DROP.

352
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,666
- ALRIGHT JUVIA!
IT'S UP TO YOU!

353
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,750
- YOUR ATTACKS WILL HAVE NO
EFFECT ON ME WHATSOEVER.

354
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,625
WATER LOCK!

355
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:06,291
- WHAT'S THAT? DID YOU JUST
SAY YOU WANNA ROCK?

356
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,750
- IS THAT ALL YOU'VE GOT?

357
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,833
- YOU ELEMENT FOUR
PEOPLE ARE SCARY.

358
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:16,666
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE
ON OUR SIDE NOW!

359
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,500
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND-- MY WATER
LOCK JUST DISAPPEARED!

360
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,083
- WHERE'D ALL THAT WATER GO?

361
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:47,083
- SOMETIMES IT'S BEST TO JUST
GIVE YOUR LOCKS A GOOD RINSE.

362
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:50,208
SHAMPOOING EVERYDAY CAN
REALLY DRY OUT YOUR HAIR.

363
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,291
- BUT HOW WERE YOU ABLE TO
BREAK FREE FROM MY WATER LOCK?

364
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,291
- IT WAS EASY 'CAUSE MY ROCK
STAR HAIR ABSORBS LIQUIDS.

365
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:59,083
JUST AS LONG AS IT AIN'T OIL
OR ALCOHOL, YA KNOW?

366
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,500
THAT STUFF'LL REALLY
MESS UP YOUR 'DO.

367
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:04,666
- WATER HAS NO EFFECT ON HIM?
- THAT'S NOT GOOD.

368
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:09,208
- MAN I GOTTA TELL YA, BOTH OF
YOU LADIES ARE HOTTER THAN HELL.

369
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,750
- OH HERE WE GO AGAIN!

370
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,250
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

371
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,625
- I SWEAR, BEING THIS CUTE CAN
BE A REAL CURSE SOMETIMES.

372
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:19,375
- EENY, MEENY, MINEEY, MOE,
OH NO!

373
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:25,541
I JUST GOT TO CATCH ONE OF
THESE HOT CHICKS BY THE TOE!

374
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:32,083
YOU'RE IT, BABE! I'M GONNA MAKE
YOU MY SUCCUBUS!

375
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,166
- YOUR SUCCUBUS?

376
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:42,666
- ROCK OF SUCCUBUS! OH YEAH!

377
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,375
- WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?

378
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:47,083
OH, YEAH!

379
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,166
- NO! LEAVE ME ALONE!

380
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,083
- JUVIA! WHAT'S GOING ON?

381
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:54,208
- STAY BACK! HE'S TOO DANGEROUS!

382
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:06,333
- AND SO FALLS THE RAIN WOMAN.
I WONDER WHAT'LL HAPPEN NEXT.

383
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,625
- HEY JUVIA?

384
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:14,166
- SHE'S MY SLAVE NOW, BABE.

385
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:23,000
- I'M GONNA TAKE YOU FOR A
RIDE STRAIGHT TO HELL, BLONDIE!

386
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,375
SAY YOUR PRAYERS IF YOU WANNA,

387
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,750
BUT YOU'LL STILL BURN
IN HELL TONIGHT!

388
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,416
- WHAT DID THAT GUY DO TO HER?

389
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:40,125
- LOOKS LIKE THIS IS THE END
FOR THE CELESTIAL WIZARD.

390
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:15,458
- I HEARD THAT WHEN ERZA WAS A
LITTLE KID, SHE WAS REALLY SHY,

391
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,458
AND WOULDN'T EVEN LET
ANYONE COME NEAR HER.

392
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,583
- THAT'S KINDA HARD
TO IMAGINE NOW.

393
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,166
- I BETCHA SHE JUST ACTS TOUGH

394
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,708
'CAUSE SHE'S TRYIN'
TO PROTECT HERSELF

395
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:24,708
FROM THE PAINFUL STUFF SHE WENT
THROUGH WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG.

396
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:26,875
- SHE HAS ALL THAT ARMOR
TO PROTECT HER, THOUGH.

397
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,541
- NO, I MEAN SHE KEEPS
HER HEART CLOSED

398
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,625
SO SHE DOESN'T GET HURT AGAIN.

399
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:33,291
Both together: NEXT TIME:
ARMOR OF THE HEART!

400
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:34,708
- UH, SORRY PAL,

401
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:36,541
BUT I THINK YOU'RE GETTIN'
A LITTLE TOO DEEP FOR ME.

402
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,375
- BUT YOU'RE ALWAYS
WIDE OPEN, NATSU!

403
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:41,416
- DID YOU SAY "OVEN"?
I'M STARVING RIGHT NOW!
