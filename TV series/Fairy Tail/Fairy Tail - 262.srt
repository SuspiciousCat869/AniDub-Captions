1
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,500
[NARRATOR] While Natsu and the
Dragon Slayers of Sabertooth

2
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:23,458
continue their intense battle
with the demons of Tartaros,

3
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:26,083
Erza and the others fight with
everything they have left

4
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,375
to try to keep the
Faces from detonating.

5
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:31,541
As the wizards struggle to
end this war once and for all,

6
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,625
Mard Geer shares
his ultimate plan.

7
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:34,916
[MARD GEER]
Don't you know?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,166
I'd think you could've
put it together.

9
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,750
That tome your friend wants
to steal contains E.N.D,

10
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,458
and it's magic that seals him.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,958
You wanna bust him out?

12
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:49,208
Now you see.

13
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,083
Despite how it may appear...

14
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,541
I'm not our leader.

15
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,875
That title belongs to E.N.D.

16
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:57,333
There are none among us
who can rival his strength.

17
00:00:57,416 --> 00:01:00,208
Once E.N.D. has finally
been released,

18
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:04,583
we can fulfill our true purpose,
and return to Zeref.

19
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:06,500
Damn! It won't budge!

20
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,791
Come on, Man! Use your fire!

21
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:11,833
Ah! Crap, I'm stuck.

22
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:19,166
It froze.

23
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,333
[NARRATOR]
But when all hope seemed lost,

24
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:28,791
an old friend returned
to save the day.

25
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:29,875
[NATSU]
My scarf.

26
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:31,750
I thought I'd lost it for good.

27
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,083
[GRAY]
You're welcome.

28
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,333
[NATSU]
Uh...

29
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:40,000
If it means so much to you,
then take better care of it.

30
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,625
Will do.

31
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:46,000
[GRAY]
Ice Demon: Zero Long Sword!

32
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:52,041
Don't let this jerkwad freakshow
get under your skin!

33
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:55,916
Keep fighting! Ah!

34
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:07,541
[MARD GEER] Behold, I
am Mard Geer Tartaros.

35
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:12,125
Absolute Demon, and
King of the Underworld.

36
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:17,583
[GRAY]
Natsu.

37
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,875
[NATSU]
Don't say it. I know.

38
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,458
We don't care what you
call yourself king of!

39
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:28,958
We're gonna take you out!

40
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,458
[MARD GEER]
Come. Give me your all.

41
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:35,083
For this battle
shall be your last.

42
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,875
Now it's time for you to Freeze!

43
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,333
Right After you Burn!

44
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,125
[GRAY, NATSU gasp]

45
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,458
Hey! You better let
go of me right now,

46
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,500
you weird gargoyle
lookin' freak!

47
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,291
[MARD GEER]
At last, the time has come

48
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:17,000
for you to see what lies
beyond the Netherworld Gate.

49
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,708
[NATSU groans]

50
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,208
[GRAY groans]

51
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,166
[NATSU, GRAY groaning]

52
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,666
[NATSU screams]

53
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,666
[MARD GEER]
I will savor every last moment

54
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,625
of tearing your soul to shreds
and erasing your existence.

55
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,333
[ERZA groaning]

56
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:46,083
[ERZA] There's a light
you'll never take from me.

57
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,583
[ALL gasp]

58
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:49,458
No way.

59
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,208
She's back on her feet.

60
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,583
But how does she know what
to do without any senses?

61
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,208
She's amazing!

62
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,875
Truly impressive.

63
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,541
How was she able to
sense the attacks?

64
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,750
Cause Erza can do anything.

65
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,666
Keep your guard up!

66
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,375
You're beaten.

67
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,250
Lay down.

68
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,083
[ERZA]
Sight.

69
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,125
Sound.

70
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,791
These are luxuries, both.

71
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,708
All that's needed
is the light within.

72
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:27,166
You would understand
that if you had one.

73
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,833
[ERZA] It would've led you
to protect your comrades!

74
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,291
[ERZA grunts]

75
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:38,625
[ERZA] You were created
to live in darkness!

76
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,708
With pain your only guide,

77
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,500
it's you who must be frightened!

78
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:54,000
I guess we better head to the
guild hall to meet Makarov.

79
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,083
Hey, Lucy.

80
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,333
Could you give him
a message for me?

81
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,166
Let him know I've got his back.

82
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,041
And I have faith this
secret weapon's gonna work.

83
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,958
You got it.

84
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,291
[WARREN]
Man, she is workin' that outfit.

85
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,916
Lookin' good.

86
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,250
Come on man.

87
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,916
You gotta get your
head in the game!

88
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,958
For real, we've got way
more important things

89
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,666
you could be thinking
about. Get a grip!

90
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,541
I really gotta work
on my filter...

91
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:21,875
Okay, let's get going.
We don't have time to waste.

92
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,375
[CARLA] Her looks aren't the
only thing that's changed.

93
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,791
She's so strong
and confident now.

94
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,791
Are you sure you
wanna stay behind?

95
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,500
Yeah, I'll be fine here,
but you better get moving.

96
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,875
Okay. We'll be back
before you know it.

97
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,625
[yells]

98
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:40,666
[STING, ROGUE grunt]

99
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,208
It was your fault.

100
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,166
You're the one who
dragged her into this.

101
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,791
That pitiful excuse of a girl
was completely useless.

102
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,250
I had such high hopes
of utilizing the power

103
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,791
of the demons to strengthen
the intensity of her magic.

104
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,041
But she wasn't ready

105
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,500
and that weakling chose
to remain a weakling.

106
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,583
The years I've spent teaching
you have been wasted.

107
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:10,083
But a place may do
what I could not.

108
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,750
These woods are filled
with vicious beasts.

109
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,000
Either it will strip you

110
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:17,083
of your tears, your heart,
and your weakness.

111
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:20,250
Or they will strip
you of your life.

112
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,625
Once your tears have dried
for good, you may return.

113
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,416
But she is your own child!

114
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,250
[JIEMMA]
Hm... Child, you say?

115
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,458
But how? No!

116
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,208
You should be out of power!

117
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,791
How can you still be standing?

118
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,125
[ERZA]
I told you.

119
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:42,041
I'll keep standing until
I've put you in the dirt.

120
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,125
[MINERVA]
No.

121
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,125
Stop.

122
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,541
I will have revenge!

123
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,541
Stay back! You've won this!

124
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,250
Let me go!

125
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,916

She's nothing!

[ROGUE]
Uh.

131
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,583
[STING]
Uh...

132
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,208
[JIEMMA] The only thing she
was ever going to be good for

133
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,791
was continuing my bloodline.

134
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,625
Take that back!

[JIEMMA]
You'll never beat me.

141
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,375
You need to accept the fact
that as long as I'm alive

142
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,750
you'll never have my guild.

143
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,875
[ROGUE]
We don't want your guild back,

144
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,791
we want our guild back.

145
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,916
The way it was.

146
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,333
When we were a team.

147
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,375
The way a guild
is supposed to be.

148
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,541
Only the weak believe that crap!

149
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,416
[ROGUE groans]

150
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,833
A real leader knows that the
only thing Sabertooth needs

151
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,416
is to be the strongest
guild there ever was.

152
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,291
But you ruined that.

153
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:09,708
With your "weakness"
and "teamwork."

154
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,875
I know you might
see it that way,

155
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,041
but I don't.

156
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,458
Showing compassion
isn't weakness,

157
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,708
it's strength.

158
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,625
With a power unlike
anything else.

159
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,041
[JIEMMA]
Nonsense.

160
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,125
Weakness is abandoning
your comrades

161
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,250
when they need you the most.

We're through with

There's no way you can

And that's just the way it is.

Teamwork is just
a clever fallacy.

Each of these negative feelings

gave us an incredibly
powerful energy.

[NATSU groaning]

325
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:45,791
[MARD GEER] You are now, and
forever will be... nothing.

326
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,000
The moment has arrived.

327
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:22,125
The ultimate curse has finally
been perfected and invoked.

328
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,000
Once E.N.D has been revived,
I'll fulfill my promise.

329
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,916
And then...

330
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,708
You will be destroyed,
Lord Zeref.

331
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,291
[LUCY] Even Fairy Tail's
duo of fire and ice

332
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:18,500
is decimated by Mard
Geer's ultimate curse.

333
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:19,791
Is there no other wizard

334
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,750
that can stop Tartaros
and the Memento Mori?

335
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:26,916
As the Faces' countdown reaches
zero, tensions run high.

336
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,958
Will Magic really disappear
from the world forever?

337
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:32,250
Or will humanity be saved
in the final moments

338
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,958
by an ancient and
spectacular intervention?

339
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:38,666
Next Time: "Tartaros Chapter
Soaring Above Ishgar."

340
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,541
High in the sky,
a miracle appears.
