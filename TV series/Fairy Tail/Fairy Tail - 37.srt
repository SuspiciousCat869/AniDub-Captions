1
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,375
- HEY, GUYS!  READY FOR
SOME MORE "FAIRY TAIL"?

2
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,333
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING,

3
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:23,708
YOU TURN THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE ROOM,

4
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:27,125
AND DON'T SIT TOO CLOSE
TO THE TV!

5
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:30,333
- YOU CAN SAY YOUR PRAYERS,
BUT YOU'RE STILL GONNA BURN

6
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:33,208
IN HELL TONIGHT!
OH, YEAH!

7
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:34,833
ARE YOU READY TO ROCK?

8
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:38,750
- JUVIA.
WHAT DID THAT GUY DO TO HER?

9
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,500
- ( theme music playing )
- ( singing in Japanese )

10
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:12,666
- ROCK ON!

11
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,166
- ( rock music playing )

12
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,375
- COME ON!  FEEL THE NOISE!

13
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,291
- IT'S SO LOUD!

14
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:23,166
JUVIA, IS ALL THIS NOISE MAKING
YOU ACT LIKE THIS?

15
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,958
- HA HA HA!
- DON'T WASTE YOUR BREATH!

16
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:30,250
MY SUCCUBUS SPELL MADE THIS
GLOOMY GROUPIE HERE MY SLAVE!

17
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,375
I GOT HER LIKE A DOG
ON A CHAIN. ( laughs )

18
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,958
YEAH, I THOUGHT ABOUT MAKING
BOTH OF YOU BABES MY SLAVES,

19
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,916
BUT THAT WOULDN'T BE
AS MUCH FUN.

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,916
'CAUSE THERE'S NOTHING HOTTER

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
THAN WATCHING CHICKS
IN A CATFIGHT.

22
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,958
GIVE ME SOME HAIR PULLING,

23
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,041
CLOTHES RIPPING,
DOWN AND DIRTY ACTION.

24
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,708
- YOU'RE A REAL SICKO.
- OH, YEAH?

25
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,291
YOU REALLY KNOW HOW
TO SWEET TALK ME,

26
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,708
DON'T YOU, BABY?   HA HA!

27
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:57,250
- THAT LITTLE BABY IS ABOUT
TO GET THE SPANKING OF HER LIFE.

28
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,708
- AWW, MAN.
I JUST CHANGED CLOTHES.

29
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,500
- NOW THEN.
- ( gasps )

30
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:09,125
- WE NEED TO WORK ON YOUR IMAGE
IF YOU REALLY WANNA ROCK.

31
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:12,083
YOU GOTTA START BY SHOWING
A LITTLE MORE SKIN.  LIKE THIS.

32
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,750
- ( screaming )

33
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,791
- ( Happy speaking )

34
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:23,125
- OH, YEAH! I'M BAD
TO THE BONE. ( laughing )

35
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,458
- HA HA!
- DON'T LET HIM GET TO YOU.

36
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,833
YOU'VE GOTTA SNAP OUT OF IT,
JUVIA.

37
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,541
- (grunts)

38
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,916
- AH!
( grunts )

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,125
LISTEN.

40
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,875
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO JOIN FAIRY
TAIL LIKE YOU SAID YOU DID,

41
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,375
THIS ISN'T THE BEST WAY
TO GO ABOUT GETTING IN.

42
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:52,083
- NOW WE'RE REALLY ROCKING, BUT
I NEED MORE SCREAMS IN THE MIX.

43
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,875
CRANK SOME OUT FOR ME.

44
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,791
- ( screaming )
- WATER CANE!

45
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:01,333
- YEAH, THAT'S THE SOUND THAT
SETS MY EARS ON FIRE.

46
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:04,416
REAL HARDCORE ROCK AND ROLL.
- YOU LIKE THAT?

47
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,958
- HA HA! DON'T PUT THE BRAKES
ON THE CATFIGHT, GIRLS.

48
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,791
GET NASTY LIKE YOU'RE
FIGHTING OVER A DUDE

49
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,000
THAT ROCKS YOUR WORLD.
- SHE WANTS MY MAN.

50
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,375
- HUH?
- SHE'S MY RIVAL.

51
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,708
- NO, I'M NOT!

52
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,250
THIS IS HOPELESS.

53
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:23,708
HE HAS COMPLETE CONTROL
OVER HER.

54
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,583
I'VE GOTTA DO SOMETHING.

55
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:29,000
THERE'S NO WAY I COULD BEAT
JUVIA IN A REAL FIGHT.

56
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,250
SHE'S TOO STRONG.
- ( laughing )

57
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:35,250
YOU'RE GONNA DROWN IN MY BODY
OF WATER.

58
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,666
- I CAN'T HOLD MY BREATH
MUCH LONGER.

59
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,666
- LUCY, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

60
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,958
- JUVIA?
- I'M SORRY.

61
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,625
I CAN'T CONTROL MY ACTIONS.

62
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,791
- IT'S LIKE SHE'S IN MY HEAD.

63
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:51,791
- I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU
BECAUSE I CONSIDER YOU A FRIEND.

64
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,916
AND I HOPE THAT YOU THINK
OF ME AS ONE, TOO.

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,833
I KNOW WE'VE HAD OUR FAIR SHARE
OF ARGUMENTS

66
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,958
BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH MADLY
IN LOVE WITH GRAY.

67
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:02,291
- YEAH.  NO.
- BUT I REALLY DO LIKE YOU.

68
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:06,375
I'VE GROWN TO LOVE EVERYONE
I'VE MET IN FAIRY TAIL.

69
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,250
THEY CARE ABOUT OTHERS.

70
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,666
THEY LIKE TO HAVE FUN.

71
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,833
THEY'RE SO FRIENDLY AND WARM.

72
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,416
FAIRY TAIL WIZARDS ARE LIKE RAYS
OF SUNSHINE

73
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,208
THAT CHASE AWAY THE CLOUDS
ON A GLOOMY DAY.

74
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,166
BEFORE I MET ALL OF YOU,

75
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,375
I NEVER KNEW THAT A GUILD COULD
BE SUCH A HAPPY PLACE.

76
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:26,000
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE,

77
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,750
I FELT LIKE I WAS MAKING FRIENDS
THAT I COULD HONESTLY TRUST.

78
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,916
BUT WHO'D WANT TO BE FRIENDS

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,708
WITH A GIRL WHO WILL
BRING THEM MISFORTUNE?

80
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:37,083
- SHE'S CRYING.
EVEN IN ALL THIS WATER,

81
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,875
I CAN STILL FEEL THE WARMTH
OF HER TEARS.

82
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:42,791
- NOW. JUVIA.   IT'S TIME
FOR THE BIG FINALE, BABY!

83
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:51,625
- OH, YEAH.
YOU READY TO BE ROCKED?

84
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,166
- SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

85
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,333
SOMEONE WHO'D SHED TEARS FOR
THEIR FRIENDS

86
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,916
WILL ALWAYS BE WELCOME
IN THE FAIRY TAIL GUILD.

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,750
- LUCY.

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,583
- I KNOW YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON.

89
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,375
AND THANKS TO YOU,
I JUST HAD A GREAT IDEA.

90
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:12,291
- WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP.
LET'S SEND THIS BORING PRUDE

91
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,916
TO HELL ALREADY.
HIT IT, BABY.

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,875
- OH, I WILL.  MY WATER JIGSAW
WILL CUT YOU INTO LITTLE PIECES.

93
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,125
NO ENCORE FOR YOU.

94
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,666
YOU HAVE TO GET OUT
OF THE WAY, LUCY.

95
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,125
( screaming )

96
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,250
- ( grunts )

97
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:37,625
OPEN GATE OF THE WATER BEARER.

98
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,000
AQUARIUS!

99
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,958
- WHAT THE--

100
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,541
- SHE SUMMONED ONE OF HER
SPIRITS USING MY BODY?

101
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:49,333
- IF THERE'S WATER, I CAN ALWAYS
CALL ON THE MOST VICIOUS SPIRIT

102
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:53,458
I KNOW, AND IT'S ALL THANKS TO
THAT BODY OF YOURS. - ( gasps )

103
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,500
- I GET CALLED ALL THE WAY OUT
HERE FOR YOU ANNOYING COWS?

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,791
- SORRY.
- SORRY.

105
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:04,500
- SO MUCH.
- WATER.

106
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:08,750
- WHAT DID I TELL YA? WATER'S
THE BEST THING FOR MY HAIR,

107
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:09,916
SO AS LONG AS IT'S FLOWING,
I'M GONNA KEEP SUCKING IT UP.

108
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,208
-  WHERE ARE YOU?

109
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,791
- ( gasps )
OVER HERE!

110
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:19,333
- JUVIA.
- LUCY.

111
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:30,208
- WHERE DID ALL THIS MAGIC
ENERGY COME FROM?

112
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,833
DON'T TELL ME THEY'VE
FUSED THEIR POWERS.

113
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,583
IT'S A UNISON RAID.

114
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,291
- WHOA!
THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

115
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,458
I WAS JUST KIDDING, LADIES,

116
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,875
YOU GOTTA TURN OFF THE
WATER NOW, PLEASE.

117
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,541
- ( screaming )

118
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,708
WICKED. 
( gasps )

119
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:11,083
- ( gasping )

120
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:14,250
- WE WON!
- AND I'M NOT A GROUPIE ANYMORE.

121
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:17,541
- I'M SO GLAD.
THANKS FOR ALL OF YOUR HELP.

122
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:20,583
I SHOULD BE THANKING YOU, LUCY.

123
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,000
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME ANOTHER
GIRL HAS EVER BEEN NICE TO ME.

124
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,083
IT'S ALMOST TOO GOOD
TO BE TRUE.

125
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,666
- ( grunts )
- ( all scream )

126
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,166
- LISTEN, GIRLY.

127
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,375
YOU'D BETTER WATCH WHERE YOU
SUMMON ME FROM HERE ON OUT.

128
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,958
'CAUSE IF I EVER FIND MYSELF
POPPING OUT OF A TOILET

129
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:37,291
IN A FILTHY PUBLIC RESTROOM,
YOU'RE AS GOOD AS DEAD.

130
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,041
- I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT, MA'AM.
- I'M GONNA HAVE NIGHTMARES NOW.

131
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:43,375
- SO DON'T GO GETTING
CREATIVE AGAIN, GOT IT?

132
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,000
- I WON'T.  I PROMISE.

133
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:50,583
- OH, I'LL BE GOING ON VACATION
WITH MY SEXY MAN.

134
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,666
SO DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT SUMMONING ME.

135
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,291
- YES, MA'AM.

136
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,666
- YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
WHEN YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

137
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,750
HA. LIKE THAT'LL HAPPEN.

138
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,458
- HEY, I'M SINGLE BY CHOICE.

139
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,916
- I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND
YOUR TRUE LOVE SOMEDAY.

140
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,083
- ( sighs )
YEAH, MAYBE SO.

141
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,083
- ( snoring )

142
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,000
- WE JUST TOOK DOWN A MEMBER
OF TRINITY RAVEN.

143
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:19,375
I BET YOU THAT CREEPY JELLAL GUY
NEVER EXPECTED THAT ONE.

144
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:23,083
- WELL, I DIDN'T DO MUCH OF
ANYTHING.  IT WAS ALL YOU, LUCY.

145
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,041
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

146
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,250
WE WORKED TOGETHER.

147
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,500
YOU WERE THERE TO HELP ME
WHEN I NEEDED IT THE MOST.

148
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,916
THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE SUPPOSED
TO DO FOR EACH OTHER.

149
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,791
IT MEANT A LOT TO ME.

150
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,500
SO FROM NOW ON, THAT'S HOW I'D
LIKE YOU TO THINK OF ME.

151
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,583
AS A FRIEND THAT YOU CAN COUNT
ON, IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU.

152
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,708
- ( sobbing )

153
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,500
JUST GREAT.

154
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,500
AS IF THERE'S NOT ENOUGH WATER
IN HERE ALREADY.

155
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,000
IT'S OKAY,
TEARS OF JOY ARE ALLOWED.

156
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,500
MAN, I'M TIRED.

157
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,958
HOW ABOUT WE JUST STAY HERE
AND REST FOR A BIT?

158
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,958
- THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
I COULD USE A BREAK.

159
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,250
- A UNISON RAID.

160
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,833
THEY ACTUALLY DID IT.
MONKS HAVE TRAINED

161
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,458
 FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIVES
TRYING TO ACHIEVE IT.

162
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,666
BUT EVEN THE MOST DISCIPLINED
WERE NEVER ABLE TO SUCCEED.

163
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,250
THAT WAS QUITE IMPRESSIVE,
EVEN IF IT WAS DUMB LUCK.

164
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,125
WELL, I'VE LEARNED MY LESSON.

165
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,958
I WON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER
OF ERZA'S ALLIES AGAIN.

166
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,375
- ( laughs )

167
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,958
- REGARDING OUR DEBATE OVER
WHETHER OR NOT TO ATTACK

168
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,750
THE TOWER OF HEAVEN,

169
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,083
THE FINAL VOTE STANDS AT FOUR
IN FAVOR AND FIVE AGAINST.

170
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:58,041
THEREFORE, THE COUNCIL HAS
DECIDED AGAINST FIRING

171
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,083
THE ETHERION CANNON
AT THIS TIME.

172
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,833
- YOU FOOLS.

173
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,541
EXTREME THREATS CAN ONLY BE
COUNTERED WITH EXTREME MEASURES.

174
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:08,416
- WATCH YOUR MOUTH, SIEGRAIN.
WE HAVE MADE OUR FINAL DECISION.

175
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,708
WE BELIEVE IT IS POSSIBLE
TO REACH A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION.

176
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,708
I'M TELLING YOU, YOU'RE WRONG.

177
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,000
WHILE WE'RE HERE WASTING OUR
BREATH DEBATING THE ISSUE,

178
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:20,333
JELLAL'S COMING CLOSER AND
CLOSER TO RESURRECTING THE DEAD.

179
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,541
I KNOW YOU'VE FELT IT.
THE NEGATIVE ENERGY

180
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:25,375
THAT'S BEEN SLOWLY SPREADING
ACROSS THE LAND.

181
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,541
IT'S BECAUSE OF THE MAN
HE'S ATTEMPTING TO BRING BACK

182
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,416
FROM THE GRAVE.
- AND WHO IS THAT?

183
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,916
- STOP BEATING AROUND THE BUSH
AND GET TO THE POINT.

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,250
- I DARED NOT SPEAK HIS NAME,
AFRAID ANY MENTION OF HIM

185
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,916
WOULD CAUSE WIDESPREAD PANIC
SHOULD WORD GET OUT.

186
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,416
BUT YOU'VE LEFT ME
NO OTHER CHOICE.

187
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,916
- JUST TELL US
WHO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

188
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,375
- EXPLAIN YOURSELF.
- HE'S RESURRECTING ZEREF.

189
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:46,708
- AGH!

190
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,750
- THAT'S INCONCEIVABLE.

191
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:53,208
- AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY
CERTAIN OF THIS?  YOU'RE SURE?

192
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,500
- I AM.

193
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:59,000
I KNOW JELLAL'S MOTIVATIONS
ALL TOO WELL.

194
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,666
SUCH IS THE BOND BETWEEN TWINS.

195
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,708
I CALL FOR ANOTHER VOTE.

196
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,541
- HOO-HOO!

197
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,416
- AGH!

198
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,125
- FIRE DRAGON TALON.

199
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,041
- SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU.

200
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:28,666
- THAT OWL GUY IS GOING
HIT FOR HIT WITH NATSU.

201
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,083
- OF COURSE HE IS.

202
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,875
I'D EXPECT NOTHING LESS FROM A
MEMBER OF TRINITY RAVEN.

203
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:35,166
- HOO-HOO!  AND NOW
THE MIGHTY HAMMER OF JUSTICE

204
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:40,083
WILL FINALLY FALL UPON YOU.
MISSILE! ( laughs )

205
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:46,416
- WOW!
WAY TO MISS YOUR TARGET, DODO.

206
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,000
( grunts )
- AND UP IT GOES.

207
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,708
ARM HANDS NOW!

208
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:57,541
- ( screaming )

209
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,208
- AROUND THE WORLD YOU GO.

210
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,291
- HIS ATTACKS ARE SO BIZARRE.

211
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,625
- ( grunts )
- NO, SLOW DOWN.

212
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,541
- I KNOW MY OPPONENTS'
WEAKNESSES VERY WELL,

213
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:11,625
SALAMANDER.

214
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,166
- OH, NO.
IT'S TRANSPORTATION.

215
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,416
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- NATSU GETS SUPER MOTION SICK.

216
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,916
- WEAKEN YOUR PREY BEFORE
YOU GO IN FOR THE KILL.

217
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,458
THAT'S THE FIRST RULE
OF HUNTING.

218
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,291
- ( screaming )

219
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,708
- NOW CAPTURE! HOO-HOO-HOO!

220
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,208
- HE'S EATING HIM
LIKE A SANDWICH.

221
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,375
- ERZA.

222
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,916
- DO IT AGAIN, CANA.
YOU MUST'VE READ THE CARDS WRONG

223
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,208
'CAUSE THERE'S NO WAY
TODAY'S MY LUCKY DAY.

224
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,625
- LOOK, I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING,
AND I DIDN'T READ 'EM WRONG.

225
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,250
IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY SO JUST DEAL
WITH IT, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

226
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,958
- WELL, I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

227
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,000
JEEZ!  I FELL INTO A DITCH
ON MY WAY HERE THIS MORNING.

228
00:13:56,083 --> 00:14:00,416
AND NOW I CAN'T FIND MY STUPID
WALLET.  TODAY TOTALLY SUCKS!

229
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,250
- HUH?
- ( crowd murmuring )

230
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,791
- SOMEONE'S KID COME
WANDERING IN?

231
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,583
- SHE DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE SOME REGULAR KID

232
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:12,916
OFF THE STREET TO ME.

233
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,166
- THIS IS IT.  THE GUILD
GRANDPA ROB TOLD ME ABOUT.

234
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,541
- WHAT IS THAT THING?

235
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,375
- YOU'RE HERE.
- AND WHAT IS IT DOING TO NATSU?

236
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,791
- HE SWALLOWED HIM WHOLE?
- MY PREY IS NOT ONLY TASTY,

237
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,958
BUT I GAIN THEIR MAGIC ENERGY
AS WELL.

238
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,875
- GIVE HIM BACK TO ME NOW.

239
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,375
- ( laughs )

240
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:43,041
FIRE!  HOO-HOO-HOO!

241
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,166
- IMPOSSIBLE.
- HAPPY?

242
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,166
- ( wincing )

243
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,291
- WHEN HE DEVOURED SALAMANDER,

244
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,500
HE SOMEHOW GAINED
HIS MAGIC POWERS.

245
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,916
- WEREN'T EXPECTING THAT,
WERE YOU?

246
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,458
- THEIR STRENGTH COMBINED
IS TERRIFYING.

247
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,583
- NOW FOR THE FINAL BLOW.

248
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:07,375
- YEP.  THAT FIRE IS
PRETTY HOT, ALL RIGHT.

249
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:11,125
- GRAY.
- HOO-HOO!  AND WHO ARE YOU?

250
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,875
- HEY YOU! I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA CATCH THAT SHO GUY

251
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,333
AND RESCUE ERZA.

252
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,875
- THAT'S WHERE I WAS HEADED
WHEN THIS THING SHOWED UP.

253
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,125
- WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO MESS
WITH HIM.  WE GOTTA FIND HER.

254
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,791
BECAUSE IF WE DON'T,

255
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,458
THERE'S A CHANCE THAT SHE'LL
END UP AS JELLAL'S SACRIFICE.

256
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:28,083
- ( groans ) NORMALLY I'M SURE
SHE'D HAVE NO PROBLEM

257
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,958
TAKING HIM DOWN ON HER OWN,
BUT SHE'S HELPLESS

258
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,458
AS LONG AS THAT PSYCHO FRIEND
OF YOURS

259
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:34,083
HAS HER TRAPPED
INSIDE THAT CARD.

260
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,416
- I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT SHO
COULD HANDLE THE TRUTH.

261
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,125
I NEVER WOULD'VE IMAGINED
HE'D GO BERSERK LIKE THAT.

262
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:45,625
- GRAY, SAVE HIM.
HE NEEDS YOU.

263
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,708
- WHEN ARE YOU GONNA LEARN
TO STAY OUTTA TROUBLE?

264
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,416
THIS IS THE LAST TIME
I'M PUTTING MY NECK

265
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,833
ON THE LINE FOR YOU.
YOU HEAR?

266
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,625
- ( shouts )

267
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,833
- THE DIGESTION PROCESS
HAS BEGUN.

268
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,166
IN A MERE TEN MINUTES TIME,
SALAMANDER'S BODY WILL BE FULLY

269
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,958
DISSOLVED WITHIN MY OWN.

270
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,875
ONCE THAT HAPPENS, I'LL BE ABLE
TO USE HIS MAGIC POWERS

271
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,416
TO BRING YOU TO JUSTICE.

272
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,958
- OH, YEAH?
I WOULDN'T COUNT ON IT, BUDDY.

273
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,958
YOU'LL FALL TOO.

274
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,458
- ICE MAKE LANCE!

275
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:29,208
- FIRE DRAGON ROAR!

276
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,875
- WATCH OUT!
HE'S TWICE AS STRONG NOW

277
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,833
THAT HE CAN USE
SALAMANDER'S POWERS.

278
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
- ( grunts )
- HOO HOO!

279
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,916
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT ICE
IS NO MATCH FOR FIRE.

280
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,666
- ( screaming )

281
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,666
- GRAY!
- GRAY!

282
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,291
- IT'S NO USE.

283
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,916
YOUR FRIEND WAS EVEN STRONGER
THAN YOU REALIZED.

284
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,416
YOU DON'T STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST HIS FLAMES.

285
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,708
- ( cheering )
- ( laughing )

286
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,041
- I FEEL BAD FOR HER
'CAUSE SHE'S ALWAYS ALONE.

287
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:06,291
- DON'T JUST SIT THERE FEELING
SORRY FOR HER.  GO SAY HI.

288
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,875
- I TRIED THAT,
BUT SHE TOTALLY IGNORED ME.

289
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,833
- WELL, SHE SHOULD UNDERSTAND
BY NOW

290
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,375
THAT SHE'S NOT GONNA GET
ANYWHERE IN THIS GUILD

291
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,958
IF SHE DOESN'T WANNA TALK
TO THE GRAY.

292
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,875
- YOU ARE GETTING WAY TOO BIG
FOR YOUR BRITCHES THERE,

293
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,375
STREAKER.

294
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,083
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?

295
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,916
- IS THERE A PROBLEM?

296
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,541
- YOU KNOW THIS IS A WIZARD'S
GUILD, RIGHT?

297
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,625
THAT STUPID ARMOR
WON'T PROTECT YOU HERE.

298
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,833
- MAYBE NOT BUT AT LEAST I HAVE
THE COMMON DECENCY

299
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:39,500
TO WEAR SOMETHING.  THAT'S MORE
THAN I CAN SAY FOR YOU, PERV.

300
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,958
- BE CAREFUL, GUYS.
LOOKS LIKE WE GOT A LIVE ONE.

301
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,875
- SHE SURE FIGURED YOU OUT
QUICK, GRAY.

302
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,875
- WHAT'D YOU CALL ME?

303
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,833
- IF YOU'RE SMART,
YOU'LL LEAVE ME ALONE.

304
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:55,166
- ( grunts )

305
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,833
- HE WAS ABLE
TO FREEZE THE FIRE.

306
00:17:56,916 --> 00:18:00,958
- NATSU'S FLAMES ARE WAY HOTTER,
PAL, BUT I EXPECTED THAT

307
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,458
'CAUSE YOU'RE JUST SOME
BIRD-BRAINED POSER.

308
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,125
- HOO HOO! THAT'S SOME
IMPRESSIVE POWER YOU'VE GOT.

309
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,583
MAYBE I SHOULD CAPTURE YOU, TOO.

310
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,666
- GRAY!
- GRAY!

311
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:18,166
- OH! TOO COLD!

312
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,958
- I'M NOT GONNA WASTE ANY MORE
OF MY TIME

313
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,708
PLAYING THESE STUPID GAMES
WITH YOU.

314
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:25,916
I'VE GOT MORE IMPORTANT THINGS
TO DO, LIKE RESCUE ERZA.

315
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,583
- DID YOU LET THAT LITTLE GIRL
BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF YOU AGAIN?

316
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,916
- YOU KNOW, I'M STARTING
TO THINK YOU LIKE IT.

317
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,541
OR MAYBE YOU JUST LIKE HER.
- OH, SHUT UP!

318
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:37,208
- SHE MUST BE PRETTY TOUGH IF
SHE CAN TAKE DOWN THE GRAY, HUH?

319
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,625
YEAH, IF SHE KEEPS IT UP,
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

320
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:42,500
SHE'LL BE CALLING THE SHOTS
AROUND HERE.

321
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,458
-NO, SHE WON'T.
SHE'LL NEVER BE ONE OF US.

322
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,500
ERZA, I SWEAR I'LL BRING YOU
BACK HOME.

323
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,625
- CAN'T HIDE FROM ME,
YOU RED-HEADED FREAK.

324
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,041
ALL RIGHT, ERZA, BRING IT ON.

325
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,750
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S GOING DOWN
THIS TIME.

326
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,416
- IT'S YOU AGAIN.
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU?

327
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,875
HAVEN'T YOU LEARNED YOUR LESSON?

328
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:17,083
ALL RIGHT,
GIVE ME YOUR BEST SHOT.

329
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:20,583
- OH.  WELL, UH...

330
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:23,958
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?  YOU'RE NOT
CHICKENING OUT, ARE YOU?

331
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,541
- TELL ME SOMETHING.  HOW COME
YOU'RE ALONE ALL THE TIME?

332
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,166
- I JUST PREFER TO BE ALONE

333
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,958
'CAUSE I GET NERVOUS
AROUND OTHER PEOPLE.

334
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,833
- OH, YEAH?

335
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,875
WELL, YOU'RE ALONE NOW,
SO WHY YOU CRYING?

336
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,500
- ( gasps )

337
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,208
SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
FIGHT ME TODAY?

338
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,750
- I CAN'T FIGHT A GIRL
WHO'S CRYING.

339
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,125
- ( shouting )

340
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,041
- OUT OF MY WAY.

341
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:23,250
ICE BLADE SEVEN STRIKE DANCE.
- OH!

342
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,208
- ( grunts ) 

343
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:37,083
- HE BEAT HIM!

344
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,333
- SHE KEPT HER HEART SHIELDED
IN ARMOR

345
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,291
BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT THAT WAS THE
ONLY WAY TO KEEP IT

346
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,875
FROM BREAKING AGAIN,

347
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,625
BUT IT DIDN'T STOP THE PAIN.

348
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,208
- NATSU.
- THAT WAS INCREDIBLE.

349
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,458
- I HOPE SHE KNOWS HER FRIENDS
IN FAIRY TAIL

350
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,958
ARE TEN TIMES BETTER
THAN ANY ARMOR.

351
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,666
WITH US AROUND,
SHE'LL NEVER CRY AGAIN.

352
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,708
- THERE ARE NOW EIGHT VOTES
IN FAVOR AND ONLY ONE AGAINST.

353
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:09,791
THEREFORE, AN ETHERION BLAST
WILL BE USED

354
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:13,291
TO STRIKE DOWN THE TOWER
OF HEAVEN.

355
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,500
- THE COUNCIL'S MADE A DECISION.

356
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,083
- THE ETHERION WILL BE FIRED
IN ONE HOUR.

357
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:21,250
- BEGIN THE PREPARATIONS!
- ( clamoring )

358
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,583
- ( knock on door )
- ENTER.

359
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,958
- PLEASE FORGIVE MY INTRUSION.

360
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:37,041
- YAJIMA.
- I'M SORRY, SIEG,

361
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:40,000
BUT I DON'T THINK THIS
IS A WISE MOVE.

362
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,083
SURELY AN INTELLIGENT MAN
LIKE YOURSELF

363
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,750
COULD EASILY COME UP
WITH A MORE PEACEFUL WAY

364
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,500
OF RESOLVING THIS
VOLATILE SITUATION.

365
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,250
I WISH THERE WAS ANOTHER WAY,
BUT THE CONSEQUENCES

366
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:53,041
OF ZEREF'S RESURRECTION
ARE JUST TOO DIRE.

367
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:56,500
THAT'S WHY WE MUST STOP HIM
BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY.

368
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,708
YOU UNDERSTAND,
DON'T YOU, ELDER?

369
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:02,916
- ( sighs ) YES, WE MUST
STOP JELLAL, I AGREE.

370
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,041
BUT CAN YOU LIVE WITH THE
CONSEQUENCES OF TODAY'S VOTE?

371
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,458
- OF COURSE.  THAT'S A BURDEN
I'M WILLING TO BEAR.

372
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:12,250
- THIS BLAST COULD KILL
THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT PEOPLE,

373
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:15,708
INCLUDING YOUR
OWN TWIN BROTHER!

374
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:18,208
I HOPE YOU REALIZE THE BURDEN
OF HIS DEATH

375
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:19,875
AND THE COUNTLESS OTHERS
THAT FALL ALONGSIDE HIM

376
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:22,750
WILL REST SQUARELY
ON YOUR SHOULDERS.

377
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:25,166
DO YOU?

378
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,250
- I KNOW WHAT IS
AT STAKE HERE.

379
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,916
AND I'M PREPARED
TO DO WHAT I MUST.

380
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:35,958
SO YOUR MOVE NOW,
BUT YOU'D BETTER HURRY.

381
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:38,416
SOON THE LIGHT WILL RAIN DOWN

382
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,750
UPON OUR HEADS.

383
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:44,166
- ( end theme playing )

384
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:49,083
- ( singing in Japanese )

385
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:16,083
- HEY, WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED
TO MR. HOOTY-HOO ANYWAY?

386
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:18,458
- YOU MEAN THE OWL GUY?
GRAY TOOK CARE OF HIM

387
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,750
WHILE YOU WERE OUT COLD.
- AWW, MAN, THAT STINKS.

388
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,833
I HATE THAT STUPID
BOXER-SHORTS-WEARING JERK.

389
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:25,250
HOW COME HE'S ALWAYS
HOGGING ALL THE FUN?

390
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:27,166
THAT'S IT.
I DEMAND A REMATCH RIGHT NOW.

391
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,708
- COME ON, JUST LET IT GO.

392
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:30,625
WE DON'T HAVE TIME
TO FIGHT HIM AGAIN.

393
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:33,666
- ( Happy and Natsu speaking )

394
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,541
- BESIDES,
JELLAL'S THE MAIN BADDIE.

395
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:37,500
BEATING HIM WILL BE WAY COOLER.

396
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:40,041
- YOU THINK SO?  SWEET!
THEN LET'S GO GET HIM.

397
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:42,500
CAN WE TAKE A BREAK FIRST?
