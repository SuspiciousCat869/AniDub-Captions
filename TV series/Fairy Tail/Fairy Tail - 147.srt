[KLODOA] Unfortunately, it seems
Lapointe has expired, Master.

161
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,166
[MIDNIGHT] It's no great loss.

162
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,166
He'd served his purpose.

163
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,375
[MIDNIGHT] Even if he was
made from remnants of my father,

164
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,416
he was nothing but another pawn.

165
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,791
You disgust me!

166
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,125
Whether he was made out of

167
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,541
magic power or not,
he was still a living being!

168
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,291
On the contrary.

169
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,541
"Heart" is what's
truly important.

170
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,833
Those who don't have
it might as well be dolls.

171
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,041
What happened to you?

172
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,083
[LAKI] Is he under the same
spell that was used on Cana?

173
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,125
[CARLA] Yes, I think so.

174
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,375
[HAPPY] Any luck, Wendy?

175
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,625
My Healing
magic isn't working.

176
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,416
Keep tryin'!

177
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,208
His fever's
still pretty high.

178
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,333
What's the matter?

179
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,791
I think the
spell was cast on

180
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,875
the archbishop's
brain for too long.

181
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,083
Fragments of it
are still stuck in there.

182
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,333
So, unless we can
safely remove the fragments,

183
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,458
he may not live long
enough to help us.

184
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,750
Do you think
you can save him?

185
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,583
[WENDY] If I can use
my magic delicately

186
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,916
enough to prevent brain
damage, then possibly.

187
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,750
I don't see any
other option here.

188
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,333
If he comes out of it,
he might be able to tell

189
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,375
us more about the
Infinity Clock.

190
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,375
Come on, Wendy,
you can do this!

191
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,958
[WENDY] Okay.

192
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,333
I sense a power
coming this way.

193
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,166
Please let it be Natsu!

194
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,500
It isn't.
This time.

195
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,041
I've found you!
Just as I calculated!

196
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,833
[LUCY] An Exceed.
Is that Samuel?

197
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:55,375
[IMITATIA] Lucy belongs
to me and nobody else!

198
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,000
I won't let you have her!

199
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,375
[LUCY] Huh?

200
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,625
Wait, I'm confused, I thought
he was on your side?

201
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,125
That doesn't seem
to be the case any longer.

202
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,833
I'm not sure why he switched
sides, but it's obvious

203
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,375
that he intends
to end your life now.

204
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,833
My Aera wings.

205
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,500
[IMITATIA] This is unexpected.

206
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,625
The Legion Platoon
dogs we had under

207
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,083
tight leash have
turned on their Masters.

208
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,125
If I hadn't been here
you would've been killed.

209
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,291
[SAMUEL] I may have
lost my wings but

210
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:46,041
with these claws,
I can still climb.

211
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:49,166
Lord Byro, hang on.

212
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,000
[MARY] Unless I knocked
a few more screws loose,

213
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,000
you totally heard that
telepathic message;

214
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,375
so do you wanna
keep fightin' or what?

215
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,666
[GUTMAN] I dunno what to do now.

216
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,458
[MARY] Lord Byro, was used.

217
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,208
The cardinals were used.

218
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,541
Like, even the Archbishop
was another puppet.

219
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,000
Which means, 

220
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,250
[MARY] Me 'n you?

221
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,083
Totes tools.

222
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,208
[GUTMAN] All this
time we thought we

223
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,625
were following
Zentopia's doctrine.

224
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,416
But we were really
just playthings

225
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,333
for the Neo-Oración Seis.

226
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:22,416
Pretty much.

227
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,666
Which makes us,
like, totally uncool.

228
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,708
[GUTMAN] That hurts my feelings.
And for that I'm gonna...

229
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:36,666
[GUTMAN] Take a nice
long nappy-wappy.

230
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,708
[GUTMAN] Night-night.

231
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,208
[MARY] Well that
was anti-climactic.

232
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,083
[MARY] It's up to you now, Coco.

233
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,833
Take'em down.

234
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:46,958
C'mon!
Hurry!

235
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,041
[ELFMAN] It's really hard
to keep up with ya, kid!

236
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,041
Father Fabrizio said
that the pyramid in the middle

237
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:55,000
with the giant eye can take
us up to the Infinity Castle!

238
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,083
But we still have a ways to go!

239
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,583
Hang on, Lucy!
We're comin' for ya!

240
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,500
[LAHAR] I am Chief
Marshal Lahar of

241
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,791
the Custody Enforcement Unit.

242
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:19,041
We've freed you from the
magic effects of those chains.

243
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:22,291
You'll be protected if
you remain inside the barrier.

244
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,875
You're safe, now.
Just stay in here.

245
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,583
Direct Line!

246
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,833
[GIRL 147A] Momma!

247
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,958
Don't be afraid!

248
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,750
I've come here to
take your family to safety.

249
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,791
Good! Keep moving;
you're almost there!

250
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,000
[LAKI] It's working!

251
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,000
Yes, he doesn't look
nearly as sick as before.

252
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,458
Don't try to rush it.

253
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,625
Be very gentle.

254
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,458
She looks exhausted.

255
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,416
She's never cast
her Cure spell for this

256
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,875
long before so it's only
natural that she'd get tired.

257
00:12:59,208 --> 00:12:59,875
Come on!

258
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,250
Attack!

259
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,958
Why won't you fight seriously?

260
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,250
[GILDARTS] I didn't
want to run the risk of

261
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,875
the kids seeing it, y'know?

262
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:16,208
Because I'm about to
turn you into a bloody mess.

263
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,791
You lack the skill.

264
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,833
On the contrary,
I was just warmin' up.

265
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,625
You know, you might
be onto something here.

266
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,208
A good fight every
once in a while

267
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,250
really gets the blood pumpin'.

268
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,416
Wendy, I know
you want to save him,

269
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,500
but you're using up
too much magic power.

270
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:53,375
Maybe you should take
a breather and try again later.

271
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,250
Don't need to!
I think he'll be just fine.

272
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,833
Wait, you're already done?

273
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,416
[CARLA] My goodness.

274
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,625
When were you going to tell me
that you've improved so much?

275
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,000
I got a lot of
experience recently.

276
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,208
In any case...

277
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,791
The archbishop
is out of the woods

278
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,041
and the spell won't
bother him again.

279
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,291
It's true!

280
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,000
Even his fever's come down!

281
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,500
Excellent work, Wendy.

282
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,458
Never doubted
you for a minute.

283
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,500
Now if only getting
rid of the Infinity Clock

284
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:21,000
was as easy as removing a spell.

285
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,875
But what if it is?

286
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,750
[HAPPY] I got it!

287
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,375
What is it?

288
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,291
Samuel thinks he has
to kill Lucy in order to stop

289
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,166
the Infinity Clock but
he's got it wrong,

290
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,375
there's another way!

291
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,625
The answer was
right in front of us!

292
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,000
And that answer is.?

293
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,125
Isn't it obvious?

294
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,541
We gotta defeat the
Neo-Oración Seis!

295
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,583
We have to beat
every single one?

296
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,125
You gotta
be kiddin' me!

297
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,541
I don't follow you.

298
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,833
Remember when
they all showed up

299
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,416
and took over
the Infinity Clock?

300
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,625
The very first thing they did
was brand it with their seal.

301
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,833
[CARLA] Now that I think
about it, the sixth seal,

302
00:14:56,916 --> 00:15:00,333
the one on the clock hand,
must have belonged to Michelle.

303
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,791
[HAPPY] Us cats know
all about marking things,

304
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,083
and I'm pretty
sure that's how they

305
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,541
were able to take
control of the clock.

306
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,291
So I think that if
we're able to beat them and

307
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,083
erase all of their
seals, maybe their

308
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,291
ownership of the clock
will go away, too!

309
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,166
And if they don't control it,
they can't hold Lucy anymore!

310
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,791
She'll be free!

311
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,750
I'll let Natsu and the others
know about Happy's theory!

312
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,958
I'm gonna go and
try to find Lucy as well.

313
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,083
I'll join you!

314
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,458
I'll stay with
Wendy for now

315
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,041
but we'll meet up
with you later.

316
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,083
[CARLA] Be careful, everyone!

317
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,541
[WARREN] Hey guys,
can you hear me?

318
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,541
We might've figured out another
way to stop the Infinity Clock!

319
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,583
[ELFMAN] Does anyone
else hear that?

320
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,375
It sounds like
telepathy from Warren,

321
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,958
but I can't understand him.

322
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:41,666
He says we can stop the clock
by beating the Neo-Oración Seis!

323
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,791
Then they can't
control it anymore!

324
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,541
And we might be able
to save Lucy in the process!

325
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,166
I can get
behind that plan.

326
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,541
I start to rust if I don't bash
in some heads before dinner.

327
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,541
I'm sick and tired
of this runnin' around,

328
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:54,916
I'm ready to brawl!

329
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,750
Let's show 'em
how manly we are!

330
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,416
[NATSU] I'm all fired up!

331
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,416
End of the line, kids.

332
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,958
[NATSU] Snake dude!

333
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,333
[ERZA] Cobra!

334
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:08,291
All that anxiety, the
sweet desperation, despair.

335
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,750
I hear it all.

336
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,625
Not if I char
your ears off!

337
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,875
I'm saving you
for last, Salamander.

338
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:17,208
Titania and I have
unfinished business.

339
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,500
[COBRA] Isn't that right?

340
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:23,833
[ERZA] You heard him.

341
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,666
Go on.
I've got this.

342
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,458
We can help you!

343
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,250
No, he's only interested
in fighting me.

344
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,291
It's because I heard
the cry of his heart.

345
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,041
Shut your mouth!

346
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,458
[GRAY] C'mon.
We should get goin'.

347
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,041
[NATSU] Fine.

348
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:37,958
Erza!

349
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,166
If you die I'll kill you!

350
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,750
[Erza chuckles]

351
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,000
Mind telling me
what's so amusing?

352
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,875
There's no
point telling you.

353
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,916
You can already hear it.

354
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,583
[ELFMAN] What's with
the all the plant life?

355
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,958
[GRAY] Greenhouse maybe?

356
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,125
[GAJEEL] Why grow a
garden inside a gigantic clock?

357
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,000
[NATSU] Does it really matter?

358
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:02,083
I'm sorry boys, but this
is as far as you're getting.

359
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,791
[NATSU] I recognize that chick!

360
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:08,166
[GRAY] Angel.
Keep goin', I can handle her.

361
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,125
Okay, you and Erza really
need to learn to work as a team.

362
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,416
You got no right to talk!

363
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,750
Fine, she's all yours.

364
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,291
She wouldn't be a
challenge to me anyway.

365
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,625
[ANGEL] So you're my opponent?

366
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,291
How incredibly boring.

367
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,666
Oh don't worry.

368
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,125
I'll be sure to make things
real interesting for ya.

369
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,750
[KLODOA] Oh look!

370
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,583
A merry band
of intruders to kill!

371
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:36,958
[NATSU] It's Midnight!

372
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,875
I mean, Brain the Third
or whatever he's called.

373
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,125
Did you really
think you'd make it

374
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,291
to the top completely unopposed?

375
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,375
[NATSU]
'Bout time you showed up!

376
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,333
I call dibs.

377
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,833
You guys go find Lucy.

378
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,250
[GAJEEL] What was all that crap
about teamwork, hypocrite?

379
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,125
[NATSU] Watch it!

380
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,125
You keep goin'.

381
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,333
He's mine!

382
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,583
Shoulda known you'd
want him for yourself.

383
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,916
I already called dibs,
go find your own!

384
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,041
So you're the head
of the Neo-Oración Seis?

385
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,666
You ain't scary.

386
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,250
Ya look like some angsty kid who
got into his mother's make-up.

387
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,291
I'm not concerned with
the opinions of gutter trash.

388
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,875
Come down here
and say that to my face.

389
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:09,875
[GAJEEL] Why are you still here?

390
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,291
Go!

391
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,083
[NATSU] Why are you still
trying to give me orders?

392
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,916
[ELFMAN] We don't have
time to argue about this.

393
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,041
Let Gajeel handle
him and keep moving!

394
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,458
It shouldn't
be much further!

395
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:19,333
You cheater!

396
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,416
I'm gonna get you back for this!

397
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,666
[ERZA]
I've seen that attack before.

398
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,833
Woo!
Well, Hot Dog!

399
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,125
I don't understand.

400
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,000
Why are you still intent
on fighting Fairy Tail?

401
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,416
It's none of
your business darlin',

402
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,875
but if you must know, Lord Byro
gave us strict orders to

403
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,791
keep you and your friends
away from the Infinity Clock .

404
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,250
So that's what I'm doin'!

405
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,166
But the circumstances
have changed!

406
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,125
Lord Byro and the Neo-Oración
Seis are enemies now;

407
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,625
they're your targets!

408
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,000
There's a word for that.

409
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,708
Crazy!

410
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,208
Snake Boy here
will tell ya the same thing.

411
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,708
Get lost, maggot.

412
00:18:58,791 --> 00:18:59,750
Say what?

413
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,375
May your own
voice destroy you.

414
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,541
[SUGARBOY] Crazy!

415
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:07,208
[SUGARBOY] What's happenin'?
My doggies are goin' rabid!

416
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,083
[SUGARBOY] No!

417
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,541
Get lost.

418
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,875
Unbelievable!

419
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,875
Now I'll never get to
sing my rousing love

420
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,875
song for that hunky Ice Boy!

421
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:16,833
So cruel.

422
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,583
So spicy!

423
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,041
[SUGARBOY] Goodnight
ladies and gentlemen!

424
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,625
Sugarboy has left the building!

425
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,833
Now then, shall we
continue Titania?

426
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,208
[GAJEEL] Iron Dragon Club!

427
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,291
Iron Dragon?

428
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,250
So, the gutter trash
has claws after all.

429
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,458
[GAJEEL ] That Reflector
spell you're usin' sucks.

430
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,000
You're startin' to piss me off!

431
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,875
[KLODOA] You must be the one
called Black Steel Gajeel, yes?

432
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,583
Tell me, are your brains
made of scrap metal as well?

433
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:48,875
[GAJEEL] Eat me!

434
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:52,500
Iron Dragon Spear: Demon Logs!

435
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,916
A quick snack and
then I'll finish you off!

436
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,625
[GAJEEL] Iron Dragon Roar!

437
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,500
You should realize
by now that nothing

438
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,125
you throw at me
will hit the mark.

439
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,583
[GAJEEL] Oh, yeah?

440
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,916
That's true from a distance,
but up close and personal

441
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,916
is a whole different story!

442
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,541
[GAJEEL] Iron Dragon Sword!

443
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,916
[GAJEEL] What?

444
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,416
[MIDNIGHT] My mirages
are convincing, aren't they?

445
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,833
Spiral Pain!

446
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:40,416
[GILDARTS] Aw c'mon,
I barely felt that one!

447
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,541
You can do better.

448
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,833
Hit me with
everything you've got!

449
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,500
[BYRO] I can't do it.

450
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,416
He has a much higher
level of strength than me.

451
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,166
[GILDARTS] You overcame your
frustration of being betrayed,

452
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,875
and you fought
for what you believe in.

453
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:09,000
But, in the
Fairy Tail guild

454
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,791
our friend's lives
always take priority.

455
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:15,166
Even if the only choice
is between them or the world.

456
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:23,125
As much as I'd love to
keep playing with you, I can't.

457
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,541
I just don't have the time.

458
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:30,916
[GAJEEL] You coward!

459
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,833
I'm not letting you
off that easy, ya hear?

460
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,208
[GILDARTS] Gajeel?

461
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,625
[Gajeel cries out]

462
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,166
[GILDARTS] I gotcha!

463
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
[GAJEEL] Are you kiddin' me?

464
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,541
[Gajeel and Gildarts cry out]

465
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,666
[COCO] We should be getting
close to the center of the

466
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,708
Infinity Castle's magic power.

467
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:52,833
It's here somewhere.

468
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,375
[NATSU] I don't
smell Lucy at all.

469
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:55,541
I wonder why?

470
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,041
[COCO] It's probably
because she's linked

471
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,958
to the Infinity Clock!

472
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,625
Wait! I think I've
got Michelle's scent!

473
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,125
Right on!

474
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,250
If we can follow that it should
lead us straight to Lucy!

475
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,708
Aw, yeah!

476
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,916
[NATSU] Lucy!

477
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:21,750
My friends, they
made it, they're here.

478
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:27,166
You're wasting your time
because Lucy belongs to me!

479
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,750
Turn around and go back
to that rotting guild hall.

480
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,916
Michelle!

481
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,416
If you value your lives
you'll leave her with me.

482

483
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:15,791
[NATSU] According to the script
an Angel shows up next time!

484
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,041
[HAPPY] No way!

485
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:18,708
I thought Angels were
just mythical creatures.

486
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,458
[NATSU] I dunno what to tell
ya, buddy, but it says right

487
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:22,083
here that there's gonna be one.

488
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,333
[HAPPY] Read it again, dufus!

489
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:25,208
It's obviously
a reference to me!

490
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:26,000
[NATSU] Oh yeah?

491
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,083
How?

492
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,458
[HAPPY] Would you
look at this face?

493
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:30,708
I think everyone knows
I'm the angel of Fairy Tail!

494
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:33,458
[HAPPY AND NATSU]
Next time: Angel Tears!

495
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:34,916
[NATSU] Gimme a break!

496
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,791
When has anyone in the guild
ever called you an angel?

497
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,583
[HAPPY] They never say
it out right but it's implied.

498
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:40,083
Don't be jealous.

499
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:41,916
[NATSU] I'm amazed you can
say that with a straight face.
