1
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:21,375
[NARRATOR] It's the final day
of the Grand Magic Games

2
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:25,666
and the fighting is intense, as
the most powerful wizards clash.

3
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,791
Natsu and his team have rescued
Lucy from the palace dungeon

4
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,125
with the help of a version
of her from the future.

5
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:32,625
But she brought grim news of

6
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,583
horrific events
that were to come.

7
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:37,458
Meanwhile, Princess Hisui
considered activating

8
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:40,416
the Eclipse Two project,
in the hopes it could stop

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,916
a swarm of ten thousand
dragons that were

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,291
predicted to lay waste
to the kingdom.

11
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:48,666
The future of humanity
itself is in grave danger,

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,333
and our heroes race
against time to save it!

13
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:39,500
Iron and shadow? How?

14
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,333
[GAJEEL] Heh-heh.

15
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,583
I had no idea.
Has he always been able

16
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,708
to use two
attributes like this?

17
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,416
This definitely wasn't
a part of my strategy.

18
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,916
But it will help us.

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,666
If I hadn't seen it
with my own eyes,

20
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,208
I'd never have believed it.

21
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:56,166
Oh man! That guy is like
a freakin' monster now!

22
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,083
Well, he's always
had it in him, hasn't he?

23
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,416
[HAPPY] Roaring Thunder!

24
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,375
[cheering]

25
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,666
[CHAPATI] Holy cow! I have
never seen anything like this

26
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,875
in my life!

27
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,666
Mister Yajima,
where do you think the match

28
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,833
will go from here?

29
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,500
[YAJIMA] I'm afraid
I couldn't tell you.

30
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:19,125
Dragon Slayers do
generally defy all logic

31
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,750
and common sense,
in my opinion.

32
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,833
[MATO] That's true,
and don't forget that Rogue

33
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,458
is a third generation
dragon slayer!

34
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,625
I think the little punkin
is just getting started!

35
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,375
[scoffs]
It's impressive.

36
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:36,375
[SHADOW ROGUE] But still,
I have to strike you down.

37
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:37,791
[grunts]

38
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:38,958
He's gone!

39
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,708
No. He became a shadow.

40
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,666
[SHADOW ROGUE] How dare you
use my magic against me?

41
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:50,041
[SHADOW ROGUE] Predictable.

42
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,250
[SHADOW ROGUE grunts]

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,875
[GAJEEL chuckles]

44
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,250
[CHAPATI]
Whoa! That's incredible!

45
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,500
So now we gotta
watch two shadows fight?

46
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,166
That's a bit confusing.

47
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,458
It's practically impossible
to tell them apart.

48
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,916
[MATO] Oh wow!

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,583
I have no clue of
what's going on right now.

50
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,583
How am I gonna be able
to do a play-by-play

51
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:17,333
on something I can't
even see? Sorry folks.

52
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,916
[CHAPATI] All I can say is
something crazy is going on!

53
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,708
Bixlow.
Can you see anything?

54
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,416
Well, it's kinda tough
to make out their souls

55
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,708
through the monitor. But...

56
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,375
[BIXLOW] Gajeel's the
faster one, I think. Probably.

57
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,041
[EVERGREEN] Probably?

58
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,291
[SHADOW ROGUE] Uh! No!

59
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,375
[SHADOW ROGUE] He's pulling
me out of my shadow!

60
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:43,208
[groans]

61
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,083
[chuckles]

62
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,375
[SHADOW ROGUE] I never
dreamed he was this powerful!

63
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,041
[GAJEEL] Say goodnight!

64
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,458
[groans]

65
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:20,208
[GAJEEL]
Iron Shadow Dragon Roar!

66
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,166
[SHADOW ROGUE yells]

67
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,666
[ALL gasp]

68
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,708
[CANA giggles softly]

69
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,125
[ALL chuckle softly]

70
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,416
[distant crash]

71
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:58,125
[GAJEEL panting]

72
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:01,250
[CHAPATI] Uh. Well.
I-I guess that's it.

73
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,500
The fight is over!

74
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:09,458
[CROWD cheering]

75
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:13,166
[CHAPATI] The winner is Gajeel!

76
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,291
[MATO] I can't believe
what just happened!

77
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,583
That was absolutely riveting.

78
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:21,208
So, that victory gives
Fairy Tail one more point,

79
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,875
[CHAPATI]
for a total of fifty-one!

80
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,791
[MATO] Sabertooth is still in
the lead with fifty-five points,

81
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,750
but just few more losses
and it could be over!

82
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,916
[SHADOW ROGUE laughs]

83
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,708
I suppose I expected too
much from Rogue as he is now.

84
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,208
[GAJEEL] Eh. Huh?

85
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:46,500
[SHADOW ROGUE laughs]

86
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,541
Okay.

87
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,458
[FROSCH] Please, stop!

88
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,000
It's you.

89
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:57,708
He's hurt really bad.
Please don't kill him.

90
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,166
[GAJEEL grunts]

91
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,500
[GAJEEL] Don't worry.

92
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,458
The fight's over,
and that ain't my style.

93
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:10,833
[FROSCH gasps]

94
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,000
[ROGUE] Frosch.

95
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,041
[FROSCH] Rogue! You're okay!

96
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,458
Of course I am.

97
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,125
[FROSCH] I was so scared.

98
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:22,000
Hey, pal.

99
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:25,083
Wait. Why am I in pain?

100
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,583
[ROGUE] I lost, didn't I?

101
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:34,416
[GAJEEL] He doesn't
remember the fight.

102
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,291
That shadow.
Somethin' weird's going on.

103
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,458
[CHAPATI] Another intense
Dragon Slayer battle

104
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,375
in this year's
Grand Magic Games!

105
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,958
[MATO] That was so
strange and unexpected!

106
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,666
I think the fans will be talking
about that one for a long time!

107
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,666
It was a battle for the
history books that's for sure.

108
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,041
Yes! We're definitely
on a roll now,

109
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,500
wouldn't you say First Master?

110
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,958
We are.

111
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,166
[MAVIS] It's troubling.
That evil shadow.

112
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,666
A magic I've
never witnessed before.

113
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,166
[MALE SOLDIERS yell]

114
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,541
Fire Dragon Wing Attack!

115
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,833
Regulus Impact!

116
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,750
[MALE SOLDIERS scream]

117
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,500
Sky Dragon Roar!

118
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,375
[MALE SOLDIER 188A]
We need reinforcements here!

119
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,416
[MALE SOLDIER 188B]
They're coming from Sectors

120
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,833
seven and eight!

121
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,625
[MALE SOLDIER 188A] Outnumbering
them's our only chance!

122
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,083
[MALE SOLDIER 188C]
Let's get 'em!

123
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,291
[MALE SOLDIERS] Yeah!

124
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,583
[MALE SOLDIER 188D]
For the princess!

125
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:28,958
[MALE SOLDIER 188E]
Let's teach 'em a lesson!

126
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,083
[MALE SOLDIERS yell]

127
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,791
There are so many of them!

128
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,750
[FUTURE LUCY] We shouldn't
have come this way!

129
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,166
We're going to make it, right?

130
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,833
We do have magic on our side.

131
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,125
It's super dangerous, Carla!
You should get back!

132
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,333
So should you!

133
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,416
Uh?

134
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,333
[PANTHERLILY] Get down!

135
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,125
[CARLA yells]

136
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,916
[chuckles]
Going somewhere, huh?

137
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,791
[HAPPY] Oh no!

138
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,125
[CARLA] An executioner!

139
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,333
Not you again!

140
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:53,416
[NEPPA laughs]

141
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,833
I still got a job
to do, pussycat!

142
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,208
[WENDY whimpers]

143
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,916
Hey cutie!
It's good to see you again.

144
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,666
But this will be the last time!

145
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,750
[FUTURE LUCY] No!

146
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,333
[LUCY] Horrible timing!

147
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,000
[KAMIKA] You were fools
to think you'd bested

148
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,166
the kingdom's mightiest
executioners.

149
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,708
Very foolish!

150
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,041
[KAMIKA] And the demon's
no longer with them.

151
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,583
Haul me in!

152
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:18,208
[MALE SOLDIERS]
Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave!

153
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,000
[KAMA] Guild wizards.

154
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,333
Huh?

155
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,291
[KAMA] I understand
what compels you.

156
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:27,916
But I must carry out my
obligation to the court.

157
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,750
For your crimes
against the kingdom,

158
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,916
I will be collecting your head.

159
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,333
Gimme a break. Again?

160
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,250
[MALE SOLDIER 188F]
Uh! We need to hurry!

161
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,208
[MALE SOLDIER 188G]
The Hungry Wolf Knights

162
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,500
have joined the battle!

163
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:41,958
[MALE SOLDIER 188H]
That's great news!

164
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,291
[MALE SOLDIER 188I]
Keep moving!

165
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,750
[MALE SOLDIER 188F,
188G, and 188H] Right!

166
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,833
[footsteps]

167
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,333
[BOTH gasp]

168
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,958
[MALE SOLDIER 188J]
Uh. Colonel Arcadios!

169
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,291
[MALE SOLDIER 188K]
What are you doing here?

170
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,375
[MALE SOLDIER 188L]
I thought you were thrown in

171
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,166
the dungeon for treason!
Did you escape?

172
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,083
[ARCADIOS]
Where is the princess?

173
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,416
[MALE SOLDIER gasp]

174
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,708
I'm ordering you to tell me.

175
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,208
Sir. She's on the top floor.

176
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,041
[MALE SOLDIER 188M]
Do you see what he's wearing?

177
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,625
[MALE SOLDIER 188N] Yeah.

178
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,750
[MALE SOLDIER 188L]
It's the White Lily Armor!

179
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,666
[MALE SOLDIER 188K]
It's meant for combat!

180
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,208
[HISUI] I know it sounds
insane but hear me out.

181
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,708
They said there's
another way to use the gate.

182
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,875
They called it Eclipse Two.

183
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,458
[ARCADIOS] There is?
What does it entail?

184
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,291
I don't know if
you are aware of this,

185
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,750
but for the last seven
years we've used the games

186
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:50,958
to store magic power
within this gate.

187
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,875
[HISUI] The magic we've
accumulated within that time

188
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:57,041
is now as powerful
as an Etherion blast.

189
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,583
What?

190
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:01,583
It's on par with the sacred
light of the Magic Council?

191
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,833
[ARCADIOS] But it's said
that a single Etherion blast

192
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,333
can destroy
an entire nation!

193
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,708
[HISUI] This wealth
of magic power is the core

194
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,250
of the Eclipse Two.

195
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:13,916
And we shall unleash it
onto the swarm of dragons.

196
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,208
[FUTURE LUCY] If you
make it out of the castle

197
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,000
you'll need to
rendezvous with Jellal.

198
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,583
But be careful because
there are lacrimas

199
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,833
all over the city
monitoring the games.

200
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,625
That means you'll have to
take an underground route

201
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:23,500
to meet with him.

202
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,083
[NATSU] Wait. Him?

203
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,625
[FUTURE LUCY] I've
explained everything to him

204
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,166
as best I can.

205
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,750
I'm sure that he's busy coming
up with a plan as we speak.

206
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,583
Why's he coming up
with the plan?

207
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,833
[FUTURE LUCY] It's my fault.
I'm really sorry.

208
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:40,791
I probably should've come here
with some sort of strategy.

209
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,541
But to be honest, I don't know
what we can do to prevent it.

210
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,708
That's why I needed his help.

211
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,666
[ARCADIOS] I need to clear up
something that's troubling me.

212
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,750
[ARCADIOS] What I saw...

213
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:56,541
were surely not
the tears of a liar.

214
00:11:56,625 --> 00:12:01,500
If anyone is not telling
the truth, it's the princess.

215
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,916
[CHAPATI] We are down
to the final three teams

216
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,125
in this year's
Grand Magic Games!

217
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,916
[MATO] Sabertooth is
holding on to their lead

218
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,750
with fifty-five points.
Fairy Tail is on their heels

219
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,333
with fifty-one points.

220
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:27,666
And Lamia Scale slithers into
third with forty-nine points!

221
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,000
Gajeel just scored
Fairy Tail's first point

222
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,208
in this round with
his win against Rogue.

223
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,416
[MATO] Yes that's true,
but Sabertooth still has

224
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,125
Sting and Minerva in play!

225
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,750
And they are a
couple of tough cookies!

226
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,625
[CHAPATI] Speaking of,
where is Sting, anyway?

227
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,416
[YAJIMA] Wherever he is,
I'm sure he has

228
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,791
some kind of plan in mind.

229
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,208
[ERZA] Damn you.

230
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,708
[MINERVA] You will be
next to fall, Erza.

231
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,208
And with that injury of yours,

232
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,750
it may prove
to be somewhat easy.

233
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,958
[ERZA gasps, screams]

234
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,958
[MINERVA chuckles]

235
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,916
[yells]

236
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,083
Erza!

237
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,083
How is this
even happening?

238
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,208
That injury must be
worse than we thought.

239
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,583
[ERZA grunts]

240
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,041
[CHAPATI] That's gotta hurt!

241
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,250
Titania is dropped to the
ground like a ton of bricks!

242
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,541
Minerva is just plain brutal!

243
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,041
[MINERVA] Pluck the
wings from a Fairy

244
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,458
and you will witness
a pathetic creature.

245
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,333
I suppose I should just
put you out of your misery.

246
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,375
Your life will be
ending here, Titania.

247
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,750
[growls]

248
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,250
No! You gotta get up, Erza!

249
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,041
[CHAPATI] This is the
most intense final round

250
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:36,458
I have ever seen
and it's not letting up!

251
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,750
Looks like we've got
an Ice Magic battle

252
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,708
being waged over here!

253
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:45,708
You're not as skilled as I am,
but you are persistent!

254
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,041
Ya still don't think
I've got any skills, huh?

255
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,250
Check this out!

256
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,750
[LYON grunts]

257
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,000
Juvia!

258
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,583
Ready! Water Nebula!

259
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,458
[GRAY] Ice Make: Shotgun!

260
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,250
Sky God Dance!

261
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,708
Good job, Shelia!

262
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,000
Why the heck are you
just standing there?

263
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,791
Now Gray, you'd really
stoop so low as to use

264
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,791
my love's magic against me?

265
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,250
You'll pay for that!

266
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,833
[SHELIA] Are you insane?

267
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,333
[LYON] Juvia would
never align herself

268
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,541
with a scumbag like you.

269
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,416
Huh?

270
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,875
Get your head in the game!

271
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:23,000
[LYON]
Ice Make. Water Serpent!

272
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,750
[GRAY groans]

273
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,333
Oh no, Gray!

274
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:30,125
Hey! Don't forget that
we're fighting her too!

275
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,583
[LYON]
I'm leaving that to you.

276
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,291
Careful. You're not
allowed to hurt her.

277
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,375
[SHELIA] What?

278
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,250
Lyon's powerful.
I really had no idea.

279
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,416
Yeah, but he totally
sucks at teamwork.

280
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,875
[GRAY] Let's use that
to our advantage!

281
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,333
[CHAPATI] This match has turned
in to a two-on-two battle.

282
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,041
What are your
thoughts, Mr. Yajima?

283
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,458
[YAJIMA] Gray and Lyon are
both quite handsome fellows,

284
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,916
I suppose.

285
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,875
[MATO] Uh... What does that
have to do with anything?

286
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,166
Well no matter what happens,

287
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,250
little Shelly-Welly
is gonna win this round!

288
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,458
[YAJIMA] Yeah, yeah.

289
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:02,833
[CROWD laughing]

290
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,791
[MALE SOLDIERS commotion]

291
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:09,833
Terrain Effect.
Scorching Wind Zone!

292
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,000
Oh yeah, you know
I love to feel the heat!

293
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,875
I'm all fired up!

294
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,041
Yeah?

295
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,458
[NATSU yells]

296
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:22,708
[UOSUKE] Uh-oh!
Terrain Effect: Iceberg Zone!

297
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:26,166
[NATSU] Aw man,
what a pain in the butt!

298
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,375
--[WENDY grunts]
--[NEPPA] Woo hoo!

299
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,750
Watch out! That acid's
gonna eat you alive!

300
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,125
[NEPPA laughs]

301
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,541
I hear that you're a
Dragon Slayer too, little girl!

302
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:38,375
[WENDY]
Yes I am! Why do you care?

303
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,583
[NEPPA] Pop!

304
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,291
Sky Dragon Wing Attack!

305
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:46,166
[NEPPA laughs] You're making
this extra fun for me!

306
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,791
Paper Blizzard. Red Dance!

307
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:54,875
Okay. Open Gate of
the Scorpion! Scorpio!

308
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,833
I got this! Wicked!

309
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,708
[KAMIKA] The yellow papers
hold the spirit of lightning.

310
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,541
[SCORPIO] Sand Wall!

311
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,791
I can't believe
I'm fighting a spirit!

312
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,541
This is a dream come true!

313
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,333
Your name's Cosmos, right?

314
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:12,125
You know, I'm really more
of a lover than a fighter.

315
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,541
We should
get to know each other.

316
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:14,958
--[PLANT MONSTER growls]
--[LOKE] Aah!

317
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:18,375
First off, I find men like
you completely revolting.

318
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:21,625
Your very existence
only cheapens true beauty.

319
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:22,916
[COSMOS] You should just die!

320
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,541
[LOKE]
I see. So you like to play

321
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,375
a little hard to get, do ya?

322
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,708
I understand,
and this is so sudden.

323
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,416
[COSMOS] You don't get it!

324
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,416
[LOKE] Maybe I should
sweeten the deal.

325
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,750
I have a couple of
presents for you.

326
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,208
And I've got the
perfect thing for you!

327
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,750
Spore Bomb! Rinka Renka!

328
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,125
[MALE SOLDIER 188A] Whoa!

329
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,708
[MALE SOLDIER 188B]
The Wolf Knights are awesome!

330
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,416
[MALE SOLDIER 188C] Let's get
in there and fight with them!

331
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,208
[PANTHERLILY] Not happening!

332
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:50,125
[MALE SOLDIERS yell]

333
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:53,500
[BOTH grunting]

334
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,083
I've heard about you.

335
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:59,250
The rumors say that you used to
be a soldier but you deserted.

336
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,125
[KAMA] Why did you
shirk your sacred duty?

337
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,583
[PANTHERLILY grunts]

338
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,125
Someone like you would never
understand what happened!

339
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,583
[KAMA] Let me guess.

340
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,625
You felt that your kingdom
had lost its moral compass.

341
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,000
Bite your tongue, executioner.

342
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,500
I will not tolerate you
insulting Edolas!

343
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,000
[KAMA] Come!

344
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,458
[PANTHERLILY grunts]

345
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,750
[NATSU grunts]

346
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,791
What's wrong?!
This too much for ya?

347
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,708
You look plum tuckered out!

348
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,625
Ya know, it doesn't
really matter how I'm feelin'.

349
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:32,458
And it doesn't matter how many
of you jokers there are, either.

350
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:36,041
[NATSU] We are gonna
get out of here! End of story!

351
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:39,041
You can keep gettin' in
our way and slowing us down.

352
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,166
But you are never
gonna stop Fairy Tail!

353
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,958
[CHAPATI] Hold on!
We've got another wizard

354
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,375
joining the party, folks!

355
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,916
[MATO] It's the Wizard Saint,
Jura Nekis!

356
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,541
This is gonna be a doozy!

357
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,291
[JURA] I hope you don't mind
me interrupting your fight.

358
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:57,083
It's simply
too enticing to pass up.

359
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,250
[LAXUS] So the
monster shows himself.

360
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,333
[laughs]

361
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,375
Oh, this is gonna be good.

362
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,041
Laymia Scale won this
whole stinkin' tournament

363
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,958
the moment Jura
was chosen to participate.

364
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,291
Those two little babies
he just walked up to

365
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,916
don't stand
a chance against him.

366
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,583
I wouldn't wanna be them.
That's for sure.

367
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:17,958
But it ain't fair!

368
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,541
Way to keep your cool.

369
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:22,083
You lost big time.
I'll spin you!

370
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,375
You are spinnin' me!

371
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,958
[LAXUS]
He's not foolin' around.

372
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,875
Don't be afraid, Laxus!

373
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,125
I have complete
and total faith in you!

374
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,291
The Thunder Legion's
got your back, man!

375
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,833
I've never seen him
this nervous before.

376
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,041
[grunts]

377
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,416
[OLGA] All right,
come on and join the party.

378
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,416
I'd love to
see you fight for real.

379
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,625
Let's see if you've got the
stones to try and stop this.

380
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,041
[JURA] Oh?

381
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,333
I'm gonna give you a taste
of my full power, old man.

382
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,916
[OLGA] Let's answer the question
that's on everyone's mind.

383
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,916
Who's magic is stronger,
a saint, or a god slayer?

384
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,333
Are you up for the challenge?

385
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,583
You can walk away.

386
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:18,083
Is that Wizard Saint
title just for show?

387
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,875
[JURA] I'll play.

388
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,333
[chuckles]

389
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:26,458
[LAXUS] He walked
right into his trap.

390
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,666
He's actually falling for that?

391
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,916
Don't do it!

392
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,708
Shut up! Or I'll spin you!

393
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,083
[SHERRY and TOBY]
You are spinning me!

394
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:39,875
Here goes! Lightning God.
Charged Particle Cannon!

395
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,625
[gasps]

396
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,666
[ALL yell]

397
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,291
[ALL gasp]

398
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,333
[JURA] I remember you now.

399
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:01,750
You fought on the
very first day of the games.

400
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,916
[groans]

401
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,583
[ALL gasp]

402
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:08,583
[JURA] That fight ended
with one blow as well.

403
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,625
[CROWD murmurs]

404
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,958
[CROWD cheering]

405
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,208
[CHAPATI] And with
that devastating face palm,

406
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,666
Lamia Scale trails
Fairy Tail by one point!

407
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,500
[MAKAROV] Aah!
He doesn't have a chance.

408
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,458
Master, how can you
say such a thing?

409
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,625
Have just a
little faith in Laxus!

410
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:30,041
Yeah, he can totally
take down that old guy!

411
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,875
[JURA] Now that's done.

412
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,666
[scoffs]

413
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,416
[OHBA chuckles]

414
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,583
You should just pack
it in, Makarov.

415
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:41,166
A lot happened in the seven
years that you were gone.

416
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,666
Namely, Jura rose
to be number five among

417
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,458
the ten Wizard Saints.

418
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,166
Yeah, and those four
that are above him

419
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,541
are totally
impossible to beat.

420
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,500
[OHBA] How dare you
mention them! I'll spin you!

421
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:55,708
[SHERRY] You are spinning me!

422
00:20:57,166 --> 00:21:01,250
[OHBA] The Ishgar Four.
They're not even human.

423
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:04,708
Which means Jura is the
most powerful human wizard.

424
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,666
He won't lose.

425
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,541
[MAVIS] Jura Nekis. The one
who gave me the most anxiety

426
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,666
in this final battle.

427
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,041
There's nothing
I can do now, boy.

428
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:18,625
Just watch,
and pray for the best.

429
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,333
I had been hoping I would
get the opportunity

430
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:25,500
to spar with you.
The grandson of Makarov.

431
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:28,125
[LAXUS] All right,
you can stop right there.

432
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,625
I don't need the baggage.

433
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,125
You can just forget
about your fancy title

434
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,583
and who I'm related to.

435
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,208
You and I are just two men.

436
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,250
So be it.

437
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,958
[LAXUS and JURA grunt]

438
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,833
[grunts]

439
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:59,291
[LAXUS bellows]

440
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,416
[LAXUS groans]

441
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,583
[ALL gasp]

442
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,708
[CHAPATI] Whoa!
Lightning has been struck!

443
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,291
[chuckles]

444
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:10,875
[gasps]

445
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,125
[CHAPATI]
Man. Down in a single blow.

446
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,208
I'm at a loss for words.

447
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,333
[MATO] He squashed him.

448
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:24,833
[CHAPATI] Well, uh,
that's one way to put it.

449
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:28,458
In this world, there's
always someone above you.

450
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:31,958
[LAXUS] Yeah,
you're right about that.

451
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:35,083
But what you
seem to have forgotten...

452
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:39,416
is to pay close attention
to who's right at your feet!

453
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,166
[grunts]

454
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,833
[HAPPY] Wow, we're finally
coming to the end

455
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,541
of the Grand Magic Games!

456
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:20,291
[NATSU] Oh yeah! We made it to
the finish line, little buddy!

457
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,250
[HAPPY] This has been
a crazy ride, huh?

458
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,333
[NATSU]
Ha! You can say that again!

459
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:26,291
[HAPPY] There are still
some super tough folks left

460
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:28,333
to take down,
but we can do it, right?

461
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:32,333
[NATSU] You know it! Fairy Tail
is gonna take the top spot!

462
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:34,500
[NATSU and HAPPY]
Next time: Gloria!

463
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:37,625
[HAPPY] I can practically
taste victory! Come on, guys!

464
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:41,333
[NATSU] Just one last push!
We're counting on ya!
