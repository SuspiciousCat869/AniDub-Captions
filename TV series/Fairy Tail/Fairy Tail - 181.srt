[LEADER] Hungry Wolf
Knights, Commence Operation

2
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,208
Fifteen-hundred.

3
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:27,791
They're Executioners?

4
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,750
They don't exactly
look the part.

5
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:32,166
Trust me, they're
very good at their jobs...

6
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,458
If the rumors are true,

7
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,833
then we're facing some
relentless hunters.

8
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:38,375
A group of royal
execution machines.

9
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,708
The Hungry Wolf Knights!

10
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,250
They're the reason
it's impossible to

11
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,250
leave this cursed place...
Alive, anyway.

12
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,000
[LEADER] By the
authority granted to us

13
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,791
by the Kingdom of Fiore, we,
The Hungry Wolf Knights,

14
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,333
will now carry
out your sentence.

15
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,833
[NATSU] Previously,
on Fairy Tail!

16
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,500
[NARRATOR] Behind the
spectacle and fanfare of

17
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,958
the Grand Magic Games,
a secret plan,

18
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,333
The Eclipse Project,
was set in motion.

19
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:38,958
The aim: to change
history as we know it.

20
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,416
What lies beyond
it is time itself...

21
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,208
It will allow us to travel four
hundred years into the past,

22
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:47,500
and slay Zeref before he
gains the power of immortality.

23
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:50,250
His destruction is
our ultimate goal.

24
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:53,791
But.... How's
that even possible?

25
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,666
[NARRATOR] However, there was
opposition to this radical plan,

26
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,041
spearheaded by
Defense Minister Darton.

27
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,916
Fearful of the consequences that
changing the past may bring

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,875
upon humanity, he
imprisoned Lucy and Yukino,

29
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:09,916
whose celestial magic
was vital to its success.

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,583
A two-pronged
strategy. Nicely done.

31
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:18,791
[MAKAROV] Godspeed my children!
We're counting on you!

32
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,375
[NARRATOR] But on the
last day of the tournament,

33
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,958
Natsu and his team were able to
rescue the two young ladies.

34
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:27,791
Unfortunately, as they searched
for the massive dungeon's exit,

35
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:31,208
the group found themselves
in even greater danger.

36
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,250
Beautiful...

37
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,708
What is this?!

38
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,833
Wendy!

39
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,958
[WENDY] Hey. What
happened to me?

40
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,750
Where am I?

41
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:49,875
I'm trapped in here.
Why can't I move?!

42
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,625
[COSMOS] Soon you'll
dance with the grim reaper...

43
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,875
As my Corpse Flower
blooms from your blood!

44
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,375
Just hang
in there, Wendy!

45
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,416
I'm gonna get you
outta that thing!

46
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,333
[NATSU yells]

47
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,958
[COSMOS giggles]

48
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,958
[COSMOS] How ungraceful!

49
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,875
Besides, it's
far too late...

50
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:09,666
The digestion has begun and
her sweet life is ending.

51
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,958
I cannot let you
get away with this!

52
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,541
Don't do it, Carla!
It's too dangerous!

53
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:15,833
[COSMOS] There's
no need to worry.

54
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,166
She will soon be reincarnated.

55
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,583
Her remains will turn
into dazzling blooms.

56
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,625
She's gonna
turn into flowers?

57
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:24,416
Whoa...

58
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,000
[FLOWERS giggling]

59
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,583
[CARLA] Stop daydreaming!

60
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:30,833
Oh?

61
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,625
Why are you just
standing around?

62
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,375
Your little friend
is in hot water.

63
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,791
[MIRAJANE] He's got a point.
I'll go help Wendy...

64
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,458
Can you stay behind
and fight him?

65
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,416
[PANTHERLILY] Roger.
I got big boy.

66
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,041
Sounds like a party!

67
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,500
[PANTHERLILY] Don't get cocky,
you're still small potatoes.

68
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,125
[NEPPA] Sploosh!

69
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,875
[blows landing]

70
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,208
I'm coming,
Wendy! Hold on!

71
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,416
[HAPPY]
Fairy Tail vs. Executioners!

72
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,750
[distant explosions]

73
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,208
Haa!

74
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,333
Oh my. Look at her!

75
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,583
Such a dangerous beauty.

76
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:11,250
[MIRAJANE] Wendy!

77
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,875
Ungh!

78
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,041
Thanks, Mira...

79
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,750
Whoa, that was
awesome! Way to go!

80
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:18,833
Amazing!

81
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:19,791
Are you okay?

82
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,000
I am. All thanks to you.

83
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,208
[NATSU] Nice job, Mira!

84
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,083
I don't believe it.
That's her?

85
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,083
[MIRAJANE] This is nuts!
Is it just me, or does she

86
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,041
look a lot like Lisanna?

87
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,166
[YUKINO] Huh?

88
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,666
[LUCY] Well, now
that you mention it...

89
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,291
Lisanna? Who's that?

90
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,000
She's my little sister.

91
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:39,833
Wow.

92
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,625
What strange magic.

93
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:46,375
[LEADER] Yes. Take over
spells are unusual, indeed.

94
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,083
[CARLA] That's just one of
Mirajane's many forms!

95
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,041
[HAPPY] Yeah, like Satan Soul!

96
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,166
This one's called Sitri,
and it's her most

97
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,333
butt-kicking She-Devil form!

98
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,083
I never would have
known that was her.

99
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,375
Oh yeah!

100
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,500
She's a full fledged
S-Class Fairy Tail wizard.

101
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:03,708
And once she's
in this form,

102
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,541
there's nothing to be afraid of!

103
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,541
[HAPPY] Yeah, right.
Just don't make her mad.

104
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,666
Indeed. She's
probably the most

105
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,708
frightening one
of all of us here.

106
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,125
[KAMIKA] Freeze inside
my paper blizzard!

107
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,833
Oh, I got
somethin' for that!

108
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,166
[LUCY] Let 'em
have it, Natsu!

109
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,208
[gasping]

110
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,666
[NATSU] Lucy!

111
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,250
I'll cut it down!

112
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,458
[LEADER] I see...

113
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:32,125
So the feline's sword can
change sizes as well.

114
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,250
Gosh!

115
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,541
Well, now that that's
outta the way,

116
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,458
I can focus on chubby again.

117
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:37,750
[NEPPA] Pop! Pop!

118
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:38,916
Hey, pussycat!

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,916
Just one sploosh,
and I can melt all that

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
fur right off of ya!

121
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,125
In that case, I guess
I'm just gonna have

122
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,708
to cut you off first!

123
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:50,750
Paper Blizzard:
Purple Dance!

124
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,041
What is this?

125
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,625
I feel like
I'm paralyzed!

126
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,208
It's all over me!

127
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,833
It's some kind of
status ailment spell!

128
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,708
Every single piece holds
the spirit of confinement.

129
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,166
Our harmony
is quite lovely...

130
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,625
Grow Flow!

131
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,083
That's huge!

132
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,208
Is that a plant
or a monster?

133
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,166
Is it some kind
summoning magic?!

134
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,250
Feast, my
pet... Gorge away.

135
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,291
Let their lives
nourish you!

136
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,625
It's sucking us up!

Ahh! Runnin'

141
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,291
[PANTHERLILY] Shut your mouth!

142
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:33,958
[YUKINO screams]

143
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,625
[MIRAJANE] Yukino! Wendy!

144
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:37,916
[WENDY] I got ya!

145
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,916
O sky, cleanse us
of our ailments.

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,708
Restore our bodies.
With your shining light! Rays!

I can move!

Which means
that we can fight!

be taken care of.

163
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,125
They should be able
to wipe out that scum

164
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,166
in no time.

165
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,000
Princess! The
Hungry Wolf Knights

166
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,750
have been sent down to
execute the prisoners.

167
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,416
[SOLDIER A] They're
as good as dead now.

168
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,083
[SOLDIER B] No kidding.
I'm sure the knights will make

169
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,333
easy work of them. Mm-hmm.

170
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,500
[HISUI thinking] No.

171
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,958
This isn't going at
all as I'd planned.

172
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,083
I hope you can
make it out alive...

173
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,333
Please be safe, Arcadios.

174
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,208
[NATSU gasps]

175
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,625
[NATSU] I'm gettin'
kinda sick of the fallin'.

176
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:56,125
Hey! Is everybody okay?!

177
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,541
[LEADER] It would appear
that blast of yours

178
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,541
has scattered your
comrades far and wide.

179
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,833
But my subordinates are
single-minded in their work.

180
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,541
Rest assured none of you
will ever leave this place.

181
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,041
I came down
here to get Lucy

182
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,375
and I'm not gonna
leave without her.

183
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,458
But since you're here, I guess
I gotta deal with you first

184
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,208
if I wanna get
anything else done.

185
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,291
So why don't ya tell
me who's butt I'm kickin.'

186
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:25,458
[LEADER] A criminal like you
doesn't deserve to know my name!

187
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:27,416
[WENDY] Oh no!

188
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,708
I don't see anybody
else down here!

189
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:34,708
\What am I gonna do?
I can't even sense their power.

190
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,083
[COSMOS] Exquisite.

191
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,958
Perhaps...
delicately beautiful

192
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,000
is a better description.

193
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,291
But still...
You must die.

194
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,166
[PANTHERLILY] This is bad...

195
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,750
I should've tried
to stay with them.

196
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,416
How careless of me.

197
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,625
And without their gate keys,

198
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,333
Lucy and Yukino are
completely defenseless.

199
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,458
If I'm gonna help them, I
gotta get you out of my way.

200
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:58,500
[NEPPA] Oh yeah?

201
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,750
Well, I see it a
li'l differently.

202
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,750
I think you're
in MY way...

203
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,250
But not for long!

204
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:10,291
[MIRAJANE] Lucy!
Yukino! Can you hear me?!

205
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,541
[MIRAJANE] Where did they go?

206
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,083
I need to find them
before those knights do.

207
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,500
You should be worried
about your own safety.

208
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,250
Don't you think?

209
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,125
[MIRAJANE] I'm
sure I'll be fine...

210
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,291
Tell me... do you happen to know

211
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,125
where my friends
ran off to?

212
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,125
The same place
you're going...

213
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,625
to the afterlife.

214
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,250
[HAPPY] Oweee...

215
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,541
[CARLA] I certainly
could've done without that.

216
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,375
Natsu overdid it?
Big surprise. 

217
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,333
[YUKINO] I wonder how
far down we've fallen.

218
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,416
[HAPPY] I think we're
still in creepy-land.

219
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,250
[LUCY] Wait, did we get
separated from the others?!

220
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,833
We gotta find them!

221
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,333
[CARLA] And as per usual. I
find myself in the middle

222
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:56,041
of the most defenseless
bunch imaginable.

223
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,291
And without
our gate keys,

224
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,666
we can't summon any
spirits to help us.

225
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,666
Come on, guys.

226
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,333
We need to start
looking right now.

227
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,583
Those killers are down
here somewhere...

228
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,000
We gotta find Natsu before--

229
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,583
[HAPPY screams]

230
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:09,708
[LUCY] What's the matter?

231
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,416
[CARLA] Stop this
foolishness at once!

232
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,541
I'm not doing this
on purpose, I feel like

233
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,458
I'm getting caught like
a poor, delicious fishy!

234
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,125
I got one!

235
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,125
Him again?!

236
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,541
I love fish!

237
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,375
But I'm a cat,
for cryin' out loud!

238
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,916
Oh yeah?
I smell fish!

239
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,625
Do I look like one? Notice
the fur and pointy ears?!

240
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,041
Hoo boy!

241
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,666
You got a really
nice catch, there.

242
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,333
[HAPPY] What
are you doing?!

243
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,583
Hey! I was saving
that for lunch!

244
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,166
[UOSUKE] Too bad!

245
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,333
[LUCY] He's so weird. And
he really doesn't seem to

246
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:45,208
fit in with the rest of
his scary crew, either.

247
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,791
He's about as
terrifying as Happy.

248
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,791
But still...

249
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,458
[HAPPY] You're really
gonna take it?

250
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:53,916
[UOSUKE] Give it here.

251
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,250
[HAPPY shouts]

252
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,541
No, Happy!

253
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,375
What is the matter
with this guy?!

254
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,958
[UOSUKE] My name is Uosuke!

255
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,625
That's not what
she was asking.

256
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:04,791
Even without magic,

257
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,833
I bet we could beat up
this fish-stealer.

258
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,041
Seems likely.

259
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,125
You better
hush or else...

260
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,666
You're gonna make me mad.

261
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,083
[HAPPY] Aw man...
He's not all there, is he?

262
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:18,083
[LUCY] Happy's right...
We can beat this weirdo.

263
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,583
or at least outsmart him.

264
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,500
Do you know anything
about fighting?

265
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,666
Yes! I actually
have had a little bit

266
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,166
of training in
hand-to-hand combat.

267
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,916
[ARCADIOS] No...
Please... Don't do it!

268
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,750
Run away!

269
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:29,875
Colonel Arcadios?

270
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,791
You mustn't
engage him... Uosuke.

271
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:36,666
He's too strong...
I've heard tales of his magic.

272
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,666
He annihilates his victims.

273
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,500
not even their bones
are left behind.

274
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,291
Huh?!

275
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,333
This goofball?!

276
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:46,041
You just made me mad.

277
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,250
[LEADER] Before
I take your life.

278
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,125
you should pray
forgiveness for your sins.

279
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,375
[NATSU] It's cool...

280
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,958
I don't remember doin'
much sinnin' in my life.

281
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,166
[LEADER] Reflect on
your past carefully.

282
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,875
Clear your conscience.

283
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,083
I will allow you a
moment to do this.

284
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,875
before I strike you down.

285
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,541
I don't need it.
I said I don't remember

286
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,500
doin' any bad stuff, so
let's get this over with.

287
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,958
[MAKAROV moaning]

288
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,791
Are you feelin'
okay, master?

289
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,125
I'm fine.

290
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,791
But for some reason,
all those letters of apology

291
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,375
I've had to write just
came flooding back to me.

292
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,000
We've caused
so much trouble...

293
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:34,458
so much destruction...
so many regrettable decisions...

294
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,666
Well, there's no
denyin' it...

295
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,083
But let's focus on the
positives right now, okay?

296
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,041
What's he talkin'
about, mama?

297
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,416
It's nothing you need
to worry about just yet.

298
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,791
I wonder what's goin'
on with Natsu and his team.

299
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,250
They've been in there
for kind of a long time.

300
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,458
We should've heard
something by now.

301
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,750
We have to maintain
our faith in them.

302
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,500
And never give up hope.

303
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,125
[MAVIS] We also need
to have a plan of action

304
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,791
for when they do come back.

305
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,791
If we win, there's the
chance we could meet

306
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:05,125
with the king and explain
the situation to him.

307
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:09,375
But many more letters
of apology are inevitable.

308
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,958
I know, I know!

309
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,833
I just hope a nice letter
will be all it takes.

310
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,333
To be honest with you,

311
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:18,416
I lost count of all the times
I had to beg forgiveness.

312
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,666
Sometimes the letters
would stack up so high

313
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,791
they would fill the guild's
storehouse floor to ceiling.

314
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,666
And there were all
the invoices for damages,

315
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,791
the bills for reimbursemen,
cost estimates for repairs...

316
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,958
[MAKAROV] I'm glad I'm not alone
in this feeling, First Master.

317
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:37,291
[MAVIS] It's a big part
of the guild master's job.

318
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,375
Wow, you really know

319
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,625
about a lot of stuff,
Master Mavis!

320
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,541
I think you're cool!

321
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:43,750
Aw, that's sweet.

322
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,125
but grownups like me
know a lot of stuff!

323
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,583
You're shrimpy
for a grown up.

324
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,416
but you're still cool.

325
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,375
[MAVIS] Shrimpy?!

326
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:51,875
Now, be nice, darlin'.

327
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,250
Sorry, bout that.

328
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,666
We're still working on
learning our manners, right?

329
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,375
Oh. it's fine.
I'm not that upset.

330
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,333
Kids say the
darnedest things, huh?

331
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,791
I'm a grownup after all.

332
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,083
But I thought you were
a kid just like I am.

333
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,708
As a matter of fact,
I happen to be

334
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:09,166
the oldest person here...
Everybody's a kid to me.

335
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,833
I'm so grown-up, I'm
actually an apparition.

336
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,458
[ASCA] What does that word mean?

337
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:17,541
Uh... It's another way
of saying, 'spirit' or 'ghost.'

338
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,791
I still don't
understand what she is.

339
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,583
Me either, the whole
thing pretty much

340
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,250
goes over my head too.

341
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,708
If you're not a kid,
how come you're so tiny?

342
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,333
I'm much more than that!

343
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,458
Big things can come
in small packages...

344
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,250
Take Tenrou Island, for example!

345
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,875
Although it may seem
tiny to the untrained eye...

346

Both of our masters
are so weird...

00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,125
But, back
to the games.

349
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,166
It seems like the
match stalled out.

350
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,625
[ALZACK] Well,
the capital's huge

351
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,375

many competitors left.

[BISCA] The ones that are still
in it are super powerful, too...

353
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,041
I guess everyone's
kinda playing it safe.

354

Who knows who you might run
into coming around the corner?

[MILLIANNA] Looks like
the coast is clear...

356

Awesome.

357
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,125
I mean,
that's awesome.

358
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,250
What sucks is that Kagura
and I are the only ones

359
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,916
left on our whole team.

360
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,500
We're totally outnumbered.
What should I do now?

361
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,708
Maybe I should go
and try to look for her

362
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,541
so at least we can
have each other's back.

[LEADER] I am the
hand of justice.

383

What's truly
frightening are criminals

who think they've done no wrong.

I know I can't cut through acid.

And this here is some
extra powerful stuff.

It can turn that big 'ol sword.
into a big 'ol puddle o' goo.

from whatever's in that bottle?

It's small, but it seems like
there's an endless supply of it.

The only way that I can
beat him is by getting in close.

you now, they called you

419
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,750
Mirajane the "She-Devil".
You were once

a very powerful S-class

But looking at you now, I find
that extremely hard to believe.

some kind of lecture?

coming from a criminal.

[YUKINO grunting]

00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,458
[CARLA] There they
are! Over there!

475
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:08,958
Just hang on!
We're coming!

476
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,416
[HAPPY] We'll save you!

477
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,958
Nuh-uh!

[CARLA &amp; HAPPY scream]

479
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,541
He's gone fishing again!

480
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,208
But I'm not a fish,
I'm an Exceed!

481
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:22,208
Terrain Effect:
Gravity Zone!

[CARLA &amp; HAPPY grunting]

483
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,083
Oh no, they're
in trouble!

484
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:27,916
I feel like
I weigh a ton!

485
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,916
Me too.

486
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,291
It's a gravity
controlling spell.

487

[LUCY grunting]

488
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,333
[LUCY] Stay strong,
we can get through this!

489
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,875
[YUKINO] I know.

490
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,708
But I'm just afraid that this
rock is gonna crumble away!

491
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,041
He was right!

492
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,833
There ain't gonna be no
bones left when I'm done!

493
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:49,166
[ARCADIOS] No. I have
to do something!

494
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,458

[YUKINO grunts]

496
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,708
[ARCADIOS] I can't let you die!

497
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:02,291
The fate of the world
is counting on you!

498
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,333
For the Eclipse!

499
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,541
I'm sorry, Arcadios.

500
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,791
Are you crazy?! Why are
you still talking about that?!

501
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:12,791
I already told you I wasn't
gonna be any part of it!

502
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,958
[ARCADIOS] The Eclipse
will save the world.

503
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,458
You are the keys
to its success.

504
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:19,708
My life is not as important!

505
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,166
[YUKINO gasps]

506
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,666
[ARCADIOS] I'm willing
to sacrifice myself...

507
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,000
to save you!

508
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,291
No, please!

509
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,458
[LUCY] Wait! What
in the heck are you doing?!

[screaming]

512
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,958
[HAPPY] This is horrible!
We gotta do somethin'

513
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:17,416
or else Lucy and Yukino
are gonna get burned up!

514
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,833
[NATSU] They've got all those
cosmic animal spirits and stuff

515
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,083
that can save them, right?

516
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,041
[HAPPY] It seems you've
forgotten that they need

517
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,458
their keys to summon spirits

518
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:24,916
and they don't
have 'em right now!

519
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,083
[NATSU] Well, I think
you've forgotten that

520
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:27,500
Lucy's got a special spirit

521
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:29,458
that can come and go
whenever he feels like it...

522
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:31,000
[HAPPY] Oh yeah, you're right!

523
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:32,833
I totally forgot
all about that one.

524
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:35,416
[HAPPY &amp; NATSU] Next time:
Scorching Earth!

525
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,958
[HAPPY] Yeah, he can
take care of everything.

526
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:38,541
They'll be okay.

527
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:41,250
[NATSU] Yep, and we can focus on
gettin' out and gettin' payback!
