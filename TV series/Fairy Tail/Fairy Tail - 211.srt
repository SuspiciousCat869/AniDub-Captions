You want me to dance with you?

[CANCER] Move your
feet to the disco beat!

166
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:14,000
I've got a feeling this

I'm screwed!

170
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,041
I've got such
painfully bad rhythm.

171
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,500
I couldn't win a dance
contest to save my life!

172
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,000
[CANCER] Ooh!

173
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,291
He's on his knees, begging
please, but he still looks cool!

174
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,666
So let's get it heated up!

175
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,833
Let's make this place
a disco inferno!

176
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,083

dancing shoes!

[CANCER] Oh yeah!

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

180
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,041
Here you go, man!

181
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,250
Did you just give
me some shoes?

182
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,875
They're badass
boogie boots!

183
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,500
Once you got on those
hot crimson kicks,

184
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,750
you're going to keep dancin'

185
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,500
until your heart stops
pumping out the beat!

186
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,291
Of course, I gave them just
a little more style for you!

[GRAY]
What the?!

188
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,750

That's too funky!

192
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:08,625
[GRAY] Stop now!

193
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,375
I think I'd probably rather die

194
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,000
if it means I can
keep my dignity!

195
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,500
Oh yeah!

196
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:17,708
That is such a far out
thing for you to say, man!

197
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,250
No. I can't.

198
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,875
I refuse to make
a fool out of myself!

199
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,000
It's a nightmare.
I've got to wake up, right?

200
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,500
It's real.
And it's getting realer!

201
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,541
Cause you got the feeling
deep inside you,

202
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,833
burning a hole in your soul,
it's going to make you twist,

203
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:33,916
it's going to make you shout,

204
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,500
it's going to make
you lose control!

205
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,125
Free your mind, and
your rump will follow!

Say what?

207

I'll make you shake

Tell me.
What did you do to me?

210
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,041
I just set your spirit
free, brother man.

211
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,541
I cut your heart wide open

212
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,250
so you can get rid
of all that shame!

213
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,458
You cut open my heart?

[GRAYS chatter indistinctly]

I'm feeling so funky.

00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,625
It's like all these
weird versions of me

217

are trying to bust out!

No! Stop it!

219
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,750
It's not me!
It's not me!

Oh, I've got
the dopest moves.

Can you dig it?!

222
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,250
Hey, DJ!
Pump up the jams!

Am I really doing this?

00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,583
I can't believe it!

How strange...

230
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,750
I feel like I'm missing
something amazing right now!

231
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,250
I dance like I fight!

That means I don't fool around.

If you're looking for a
dance battle, you got it!

And you ain't seen
nothing yet, buddy.

Get down, man!

Oh! Those moves are
bringing tears to my eyes!

Ah! Now I've got to
get ready to do my thing.

238
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,708
Got to pick it up
and lay it down!

239
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:49,208
I like to call this one
the crustacean hustle.

240
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,083
You feel me?

[GRAY]
Not really.

242
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,333
You're barely even moving
your feet over there.

243
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,916
That's pretty slick.

244
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,916
But I'm about to
bring it back retro

245

with some old school
go-go style.

Please. You're never
going to move forward

on to the past.

00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,958
Ice Impact!

325
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,166
Double Pincers!

326
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,125
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

327
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,416
[GRAY GROWLS]

328
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,375
[CANCER]
You're real cool, man.

329
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:12,208
But there's no way I'm going
to lose to you in my house!

330
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,750
Been waiting' for this one!

331
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,750
[GRAY grunts]

332
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,291
[CANCER gasps]

333
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,500
Hey, this kind of
dancing ain't my style!

334
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,458
You taught me to open up my
heart to new things, remember?

335
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:26,750
Now it's my turn to
teach you something.

336
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,333
[CANCER]
He's amazing!

337
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:33,708
First off, I'll show you
the Gray Death Spiral!

338
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,333
[CANCER]
My heart is open.

339
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,875
[GRAY] And now...
The Gray Rolling Jump!

340
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,125
[CANCER]
And he's coming inside!

341
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,000
[GRAY] Gotcha!

342
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,750
Gray Twist Lift, go!

343
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,958
I'm so dizzy I can
barely see straight!

344
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,125
[GRAY] We're making
a great team so far!

345
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,083
[CANCER] This is
like a dream come true!

346
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm so happy
I could just die!

347
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,458
Oh yeah?

348
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:18,958
[CANCER] Huh?

349
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,833
[GRAY] This is going
to be my last routine!

350
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,375
[CANCER]
You're really done?

351
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,291
[CANCER gasps]

352
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,500
[GRAY] Ice Blade.
Seven-Strike Dance!

353
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:33,208
[CANCER screams]

354
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,583
[CANCER] That's not
a dance, it's a tragedy!

355
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,250
[CANCER groans]

356
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:43,708
[GRAY] Huh?

357
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:47,166
[GRAYS chatter indistinctly]

358
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,833
What in the hell
just happened?

359
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,250
Wait.

360
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,500
It's kind of starting
to come back to me now.

361
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:03,583
Oh man.
Please no.

362
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:16,250
[CANCER groans]

363
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,041
[CANCER] Come on, man.

364
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,708
Don't tell me your heart
is closed back up again.

365
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:26,750
Hey.

366
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:27,791
[CANCER] Yeah?

367
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,416
You tell anyone
about what went down

368
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,833
and I will put you
in a pot and boil you.

369
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,625
You understand me, man?

370
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,166
I know you hate me.

371
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,250
But I still think you're
the coolest dude ever.

372
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,708
Ah, geez.

373
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:47,416
[CANCER] Good night.
My sweet prince.

374
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:54,708
[GRAY] I'm just glad
no one had to see that.

375
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,541
[JUVIA]
There's that feeling again.

376
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,375
Like I missed
something incredible.

377
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,625
Okay, so now we're
in a creepy old room.

378
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,000
That looks like
some kind of altar.

379
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,375
Can you still smell Loke?

380
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,791
[NATSU sniffs]

381
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,416
It's like his scent goes this
far and then evaporates.

382
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,875
But the way we came
was the only passageway.

383
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,583
This room seems like
a total dead end to me.

384
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:36,875
[WENDY] Whoa!

385
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,791
I can definitely feel
a draft coming in

386
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,958
through this crack in the wall!

387
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,750
Maybe it's a secret
door or something!

388
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,208
I'll bet you Loke
crossed through it

389
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,791
because he knew
I was coming after him.

390
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,125
I wonder if we could
get it to open somehow.

391
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,458
Perhaps with a magic word?

392
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,375
[HAPPY] I command you door,
Open sesame, please.

393
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,041
I can get it open.
Stand back everyone.

394
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,250
What?
Seriously?

395
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,500
Fire Dragon.
Iron Fist!

396
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,875
I don't think that
it worked, Natsu!

397
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,875
[HAPPY] Thanks for getting
us killed in here, pal!

398
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,666
Hey, it's not my fault!

399
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:20,375
[HISUI gasps

400
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,833
Princess!

401
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:35,875
Guess it did work.

402
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,500
Now let's go get Loke!

403
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:42,125
That jerk can run.
But he can't hide! Heh, heh.

404
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:49,125
Do you know what could've caused
that big tremor just now?

405
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,625
I'm not sure.

406
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:54,208
But it does seem like something
has changed in this room.

407
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,083
Look over there.

408
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,583
A door.
But to where?

409
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,500
Well, I'm not entirely certain,

410
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,708
but I'd be willing to bet
it's somewhere dangerous.

411
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,625
Perhaps a world completely
separate from our own.

412
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,291
What do you think?

413
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,291
We should go.

414
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,750
We still don't know what's
happened in the celestial world.

415
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:24,541
Our answer might very well
lie behind that door.

416
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:25,916
Yes.

417
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,458
No matter what perils we may
face on the other side.

418
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:30,625
I swear on my honor
to be your protector

419
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,875
whatever the cost
may be, princess.

420
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:35,083
I know you will.

421
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,125
[NATSU] This sucks.

422
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,958
This desert world
is so freaking hot!

423
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:18,458
[HAPPY] I feel like my fur
is going to melt off.

424
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,708
Hey, I have an idea,
maybe we can get cooler

425
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:22,916
with some good old
bone-chilling, scary stuff!

426
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,958
[NATSU] Well, it's worth
a shot at least! Boo!

427
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:26,125
[HAPPY]
Are you kidding me?

428
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:27,875
[NATSU] No, I'm
trying to scare you!

429
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:29,791
[HAPPY] Come on, I've fought
monsters and stuff.

430
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:32,208
It's going to take more
than that to get to me.

431
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:34,500
[NATSU and HAPPY] 
Next Time: Juvia vs. Aries!

432
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:36,083
Desert Death Match!

433
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,541
[NATSU] Maybe we can find Lucy
and she can do one of her skits.

434
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:41,791
[HAPPY] Geez, I said scare me,
not bore me to death!
