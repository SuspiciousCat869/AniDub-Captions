1
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,833
[YOUNG ULTEAR]
Unforgivable.

2
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,583
[YOUNG ULTEAR]
Unforgivable.

3
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:30,083
I'm afraid I might
enjoy killing you so much

4
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:33,375
my heart will explode with joy.

5
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,833
You need to show some
respect for your mother.

6
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,875
And since she's not around
I'll have to teach you

7
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,750
that lesson for her!!!

8
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,833
No, Ultear!

9
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,166
[ULTEAR]
Don't worry about me!

10
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,208
I want you to hurry and take
Zeref to the escape point!

11
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,333
[MELDY]
Right!

12
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:21,958
Hey Juvia!

13
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,291
Time to wake up!

14
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,291
It's my beloved Gray!

15
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:30,500
Ah, waking to the gentle
whispers of my love's voice.

16
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,916
I can't think of a better way
to start my morning.

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,333
[GRAY]
Snap out of it!

18
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,750
[HAPPY]
"Power of Life"!

19
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,000
[GRAY] You've gotta
go after her, Juvia!

20
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,791
Don't let her
get away with Zeref!

21
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:45,958
'Kay!

22
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,041
Ugggh!

23
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,083
My leg.

24
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,125
Are Yu hurt?

25
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,416
Yes, but I can handle it!

26
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,458
[JUVIA] I'll do
anything for my beloved.

27
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,541
A little pain isn't
going to stop me!

28
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,291
[GRAY]
I'm counting on you, Juvia.

29
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,000
Ice Make Lance!

30
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,583
I'll simply cast
your ice into its future!

31
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,583
[ULTEAR]
Sublimation!

32
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,208
[LUCY]
Arc of Time?

33
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,500
[HAPPY] Yeah, that's the kind of
Lost Magic she uses; apparently,

34
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,583
it can control time but
it doesn't have any effect

35
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,083
on living things.

36
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,125
In that case, I'm worried
about Gray 'cause

37
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,541
there's a good chance
he'll end up fighting her.

38
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,666
Will his Ice-Make
magic be enough?

39
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,500
I Dunno.

40
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:46,750
It'll be a tough fight;

41
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,250
she beat up Natsu without
even breakin' a sweat!

42
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,875
She didn't "beat me up."

43
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,458
Let's get one thing straight,
even if Gray does run into that

44
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:56,375
cross-dressin' geezer, there
ain't no way I'm gonna help him.

45
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,791
He'll have to
handle it on his own.

46
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,375
Don't be a jerk!

47
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,250
All I'm sayin' is I know
the guy, and he'll wanna

48
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,500
kick her butt by himself
without a buncha people getting

49
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:04,958
in the way.

50
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,583
[HAPPY] You guys have known
each other a long time and

51
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:09,416
it's pretty obvious you two
share a special connection.

52
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,208
Don't try to
make it sound dirty!

53
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,083
[LUCY] So, uh what's this
about a "cross-dressing geezer"?

54
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,208
[NATSU]
Remember that creepy,

55
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,166
old man we met back
on Galuna Island?

56
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,458
Well he can disguise
himself as a hot chick!

57
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,250
[HAPPY] What if she really is
a hot chick and the old man

58
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,708
was the disguise?

59
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,000
Nah, I'm tellin' ya,

60
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,791
he's definitely got a
Master Bob-like vibe to him.

61
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,375
That "she" is a "he."

62
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:29,375
Yikes.

63
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,666
I sure hope Gray
doesn't hit on him.

64
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,083
[LUCY] We've got
more important things

65
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,125
to worry about right
now, you guys.

66
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,958
[jackhammer drilling]

67
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,666
[LUCY] What the heck
are you doing, Virgo?

68
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,083
Well, what does it
look like, Princess?.

69
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,625
I'm making pitfalls in case
the enemy gives chase.

70
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:43,583
[LUCY]
No, I get that.

71
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,708
But why the swimsuit?

72
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,250
I thought it would be fun
to spice things up a little.

73
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,916
[LUCY]
For who?

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,458
[HAPPY]
'Scuse me, Lucy.

75
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,458
I don't mean to be rude but
we've got more important things

76
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,041
to worry about right now
than Virgo's outfit.

77
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,625
You have no right to talk, cat!

78
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,000
Offense or defense?

79
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,791
We've gotta pick one.

80
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,875
So what's our strategy, guys?

81
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,708
It'd be a lot easier to
figure out if you'd stop

82
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,791
goofing off and
get serious, Lucy.

83
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,458
Don't you dare
try to blame me!

84
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,875
Would you like
me to punish her?

85
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,125
Butt out!

86
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,125
Ice Make: Hammer!

87
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,416
[ULTEAR]
Into the future!

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,583
[GRAY]
Damn it.

89
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:26,250
My ice attacks are completely
useless against her!

90
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,375
Well, what did you expect?

91
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,250
[ULTEAR]
I mastered Arc of Time.

92
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,875
To kill a Maker magic wizard.

93
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,166
[ULTEAR]
My mother.

94
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,166
My entire life I've
wanted nothing more than

95
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,708
to do away with her.

96
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,041
You're sick.

97
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,375
You'd kill your own mother?

98
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,833
[ULTEAR] I've never
stopped hating her.

99
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:14,583
Nice try.

100
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,041
Now, Flash Forward!

101
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:30,166
But why?
I know Ur cared for you!

102
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,583
Did she?

103
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,916
She used to cry because she
couldn't tell you how she felt!

104
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,666
[ULTEAR] Resorting to
brute force now that

105
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,458
your ice is useless?

106
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,416
[GRAY] No, I'll
beat you with ice.

107
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,041
You just watch.

108
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,875
I'm gonna bring you
down with Ur's magic.

109
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,750
But that's impossible.

110
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:04,958
Arc of Time magic controls
an object's flow of time.

111
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:08,791
[ULTEAR] Ice sent to its future
sublimates and sent to its past,

112
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,000
becomes water.

113
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,000
[GRAY]
I can do it.

114
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,958
Because I believe
in Ur's Maker magic.

115
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:21,083
[ULTEAR] Very well, don't say
I didn't try to warn you.

116
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,125
You cannot defeat me, Gray.

117
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,666
Not with your
pathetic Maker Magic.

118
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:49,125
[UR and GRAY] I'll free
you from the darkness.

119
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:52,208
[UR and GRAY]
I'll seal it away...

120
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,916
...forever!

121
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,375
[ULTEAR] I told you,
your ice won't work!

122
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,291
[ULTEAR]
What happened?

123
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,708
[ULTEAR]
I can't control its time!

124
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,250
What the hell's going on?

125
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,166
It's over because you
can't control the time

126
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,375
of living things.

127
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:19,583
[ULTEAR]
No. That's not ice.

128
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,708
[ULTEAR] He's
frozen his own blood!

129
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:29,541
Ice Blade.
Seven Strike Dance!

130
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:40,875
[ULTEAR] Losing the battle
just to win the war.

131
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,791
Such tenacity.

132
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,166
[ULTEAR]
Even so.

133
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:48,958
[ULTEAR]
I swear.

134
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,208
[ULTEAR]
I won't lose this battle!

135
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,416
No way!
That stance!

136
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,708
[ULTEAR]
I can't!

137
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,750
Not before I've reached
the Grand Magic World!

138
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,333
[ULTEAR]
Ice Make.

139
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,541
[ULTEAR]
Rosenkrone!

140
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:15,291
[GRAY] She's using the exact
same maker magic as Ur!

141
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,625
[UR] Out of all the magical
arts, I feel this one gives you

142
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,625
the most creative freedom.

143
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,791
Every wizard who
practices Maker magic

144
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,166
has their own unique style.

145
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,041
If you train hard.

146
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,666
Then someday.

147
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,666
You'll create
a style all your own.

148
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,833
[GRAY]
That spell.

149
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,208
I never thought
I'd see it again.

150
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,125
[GRAY]
It was hers.

151
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,666
You used Ur's magic.

152
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:51,083
I guess it's only
natural since her blood

153
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,541
is flowing
through your veins.

154
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,458
Shut up!!

155
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,541
I'll show you!

156
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,208
Let go!

157
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,750
[GRAY] How the hell did you
become such an evil person?!

158
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,291
What's wrong with you?

159
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,041
Like you care!

160
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,750
You could never understand
what I've been through!

161
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,208
[ULTEAR]
My mother!

162
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,958
That witch abandoned me!

163
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,750
[YOUNG ULTEAR]
Momma.

164
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,833
Where are we going?

165
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,875
[YOUNG ULTEAR]
Momma.

166
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,208
[YOUNG ULTEAR]
Where'd you go?

167
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,166
[ULTEAR] My mother,
Ur abandoned me.

168
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,333
[OFFICER A]
Young lady.

169
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,666
I ask that you
please come with us.

170
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:11,750
[ULTEAR]
Suddenly.

171
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:15,291
I found myself in
this strange place.

172
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,333
[YOUNG ULTEAR]
Where'd my momma go?

173
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,541
[OFFICER A] She's gone
home but don't be afraid.

174
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,250
She brought you here
because she knew we would

175
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:26,708
take good care of you, and help
strengthen your magic power.

176
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:27,958
[YOUNG ULTEAR]
Where are we?

177
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,041
[OFFICER B] The Bureau
of Magical Development.

178
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,250
[OFFICER C] It's a marvelous
facility that devises all sorts

179
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,083
of magic spells.

180
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,958
[OFFICER A]
Please Step into your room.

181
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,333
[YOUNG ULTEAR]
But.

182
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,916
[OFFICER B] I know you
want to see your mother but

183
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,500
we cannot allow that until your
magic power has grown stronger.

184
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,208
[OFFICER C] In fact,
that was her request.

185
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,875
[OFFICER A] There's a change of
clothes waiting for you inside.

186
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,625
We'll be back shortly.

187
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,041
[YOUNG ULTEAR]
Why momma?

188
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:01,083
Why'd you leave me
with these people?

189
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,250
[YOUNG ULTEAR]
I wanna go home.

190
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,166
[OFFICER A]
Miss.

191
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,750
[ALL TOGETHER]
It's time.

192
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,416
[YOUNG ULTEAR]
I'm scared.

193
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,791
What're you gonna do?

194
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,291
Please let me go!

195
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,375
[OFFICER A] We're going to
strengthen your magic power.

196
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,416
[OFFICER B] Now this
might hurt a little,

197
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,333
but we need you to stay strong.

198
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,708
[OFFICER C] Remember,
you're doing this for

199
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,458
your mother's sake.

200
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,583
[YOUNG ULTEAR]
Momma!

201
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:47,875
[sobbing]

202
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,625
[ALL TOGETHER]
It's time.

203
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:50,500
[YOUNG ULTEAR]
No.

204
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,916
I don't wanna.

205
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,625
[ALL TOGETHER]
It's time.

206
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,541
[BRAIN]
How's she doing?

207
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,083
[OFFICER A] She's a
remarkable vessel, Sir.

208
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:06,541
All of our previous test
subjects pale in comparison.

209
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,250
That's excellent news.

210
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,208
But no surprise, she's the
daughter of Ur who's said to be

211
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,250
nearly as powerful as
the Ten Wizard Saints.

212
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,666
[BRAIN] Take it up to five
hundred percent and perform

213
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,083
magic infusion
at hourly intervals.

214
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,666
Don't ease up
even if she screams.

215
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,708
[OFFICERS]
Yes, Sir!

216
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,333
[sobbing]

217
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:36,750
I wanna go home.
Please come and get me.

218
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,541
[YOUNG ULTEAR]
Momma.

219
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,916
Momma!

220
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,375
[OFFICER B] Subject
three-three-seven-three

221
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,916
has escaped!

222
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,333
[OFFICER C] A sudden spike in
magic power's been detected!

223
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,333
[OFFICER A]
What are you orders, Sir?

224
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:03,541
[BRAIN] I suppose we can
just let her go for now.

225
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:08,916
[BRAIN] The real show is still
to come, young daughter of Ur.

226
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,333
Momma. I'm coming

227
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:18,041
[ULTEAR] The Bureau's constant
magic amplification experiments

228
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:21,750
had left my mind and my tiny
body completely battered.

229
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,166
[ULTEAR] The only thing that
kept me going was my desire

230
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,041
to see my mother again.

231
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,791
[ULTEAR]
However.

232
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,791
Nothing could've
prepared me for what I saw.

233
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:52,666
[ULTEAR] There was my mother,
with a smile on her face.

234
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,791
[ULTEAR] Not only
had she abandoned me,

235
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:01,333
but she was living
with two little boys.

236
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,916
[ULTEAR]
And she looked so happy.

237
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,625
[YOUNG ULTEAR]
Unforgivable.

238
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,666
[ULTEAR] I decided to go back
to the Bureau and continue

239
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,458
the magic
amplification experiments.

240
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,791
[ULTEAR]
I wanted to grow stronger.

241
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,916
So I could take
revenge on my mother.

242
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,333
[YOUNG ULTEAR]
Unforgivable.

243
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,375
[YOUNG ULTEAR]
Unforgivable.

244
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:37,958
[BRAIN]
Is there something wrong?

245
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,458
[OFFICER A]
Well, Sir.

246
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,000
[OFFICER B] Her magic power
has been increasing at

247
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,416
an alarming rate over
the past several days.

248
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,708
[OFFICER C] I'm afraid
it's simply too dangerous

249
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:45,875
to continue.

250
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,666
This child's full
of untapped potential.

251
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,000
I thought she might be one
of the five, brave warriors

252
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,750
I'm searching for but it
doesn't appear that way.

253
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:58,708
[BRAIN] Unfortunately, her magic
is of a different quality.

254
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,500
I doubt a body link
would be possible.

255
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:04,208
[BRAIN] I want you to increase
the power to maximum level.

256
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,416
[OFFICER B]
But Sir, if we do that

257
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,875
we risk overloading
the system.

258
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,291
[BRAIN] Do it!

259
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:12,750
This place can crumble
to the ground for all I care.

260
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,583
I already have
all the spells I need.

261
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:19,125
[BRAIN] I'll leave Ur's daughter
to him as a parting gift.

262
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:23,666
[OFFICER A]
He vanished?

263
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,291
[OFFICER C]
Hey! We've got trouble!

264
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,375
[OFFICER B] The magic
power's reversed flow!

265
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:28,875
[OFFICER A]
It's going to explode!

266
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,375
Evacuate! Evacuate!

267
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,000
[ULTEAR] Eventually,
I learned of the legendary

268
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,791
black wizard Zeref.

269
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:55,958
And the dark guild, Grimoire
Heart, who sought after him.

270
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:59,458
[HADES] The Grand Magic World
is dependent upon His revival.

271
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:04,416
It cannot become
reality without Lord Zeref.

272
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,250
What's the "Grand Magic World"?

273
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,458
A realm where wizards
are free to use any magic

274
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,666
they want, light or dark.

275
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,166
Nothing's off limits,
not even the forbidden magic

276
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,375
that can retrieve
lost happiness.

277
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,666
[YOUNG ULTEAR]
Retrieve lost happiness?.

278
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,291
You can do that with magic?

279
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,958
[HADES]
Yes, with the Arc of Time.

280
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,708
It's rather complicated
but I'm sure <i>you</i> could learn

281
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,875
to master it.

282
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:32,750
[HADES] It is one of the ancient
and forgotten Lost Magics,

283
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,916
which are now forbidden because
of their immense power.

284
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,625
In this world, it is
considered imperfect.

285
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:43,041
However, that shall change
in the Grand Magic World.

286
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:46,041
There, the Arc of Time
<i>will</i> be perfect.

287
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,875
And then the wizard who
masters it will become

288
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,000
a time traveler.

289
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:02,958
[ULTEAR]
If we succeed.

290
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,458
I can start all over again.

291
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,625
I'll have the chance
to change my cursed life

292
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,541
into one of happiness!

293
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:16,041
[ULTEAR] I will bring about
the Grand Magic World!

294
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,083
[UR]
Please help me!

295
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,166
[ULTEAR] That voice!
Where's it coming from?

296
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,291
[UR]
I need help!

297
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,208
Please, I'm begging you!

298
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,208
[ULTEAR]
There it is again.

299
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,291
[UR] My daughter's suffering
because she was born with

300
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,500
too much magic power!

301
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,041
[ULTEAR]
My mother.

302
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,291
This must be her memory.

303
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,166
[UR] There's so much of it
condensed into her tiny body

304
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,500
that her fevers won't go away!

305
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,750
[DOCTOR] Don't worry ma'am,
I know of a facility

306
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,458
that specializes in such cases.

307
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,666
[ULTEAR]
My mother's memories.

308
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,041
But why am
I seeing them now?

309
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,791
[ULTEAR]
On Galuna Island,

310
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:14,250
my mother melted and
flowed into the sea.

311
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,333
[ULTEAR]
The sea.

312
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,208
[ULTEAR]
I can feel her.

313
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,625
She's all around me.

314
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,750
[UR]
My baby.

315
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,541
What the hell did
you monsters do to her?

316
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,166
She's dead?

317
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,250
[UR]
How did this happen?

318
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:43,375
There's nothing
more for me to say.

319
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:47,791
[UR] I was told that your agency
specializes in cases like hers.

320
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,958
The only reason I brought
her here is 'cause I thought

321
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,666
you could cure her.

322
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,208
Now she's dead?!

323
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,250
[OFFICER A]
We offer our condolences.

324
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,833
Her magic power,
was simply too strong.

325
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,041
[OFFICER B] It proved
too much for even us to handle.

326
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:04,208
[BRAIN] It'd be best
for you not to see her remains.

327
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,125
[UR] That's all
you have to say?

328
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,458
No, wait!

329
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,125
Please give
my daughter back to me!

330
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,750
No, she can't be gone!

331
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,000
She can't!!

332
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,666
[ULTEAR]
It's different.

333
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,541
[ULTEAR] Her memory is
so different from mine.

334
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,833
[GRAY]
Ice Make.

335
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,625
Gungnir!

336
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,750
Ur told us about you.

337
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,375
But the memories were
way too painful for her.

338
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,750
[UR] When my daughter
was born it suddenly felt

339
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:06,291
as though there was a brilliant
light shining in my heart.

340
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:09,541
One look and I just knew
that she had a bright future

341
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:12,416
awaiting her.

342
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,541
Back then I was so happy.

343
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:20,291
Packed inside her tiny body
were limitless possibilities

344
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,541
for the future.

345
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,750
[UR]
The power of life.

346
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,000
My eyes overflowed
with tears of joy that

347
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,125
couldn't be stopped.

348
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,625
[ULTEAR] All I wanted
was to bring about

349
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,291
the Grand Magic World.

350
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:43,583
[ULTEAR] So I could go back to a
time before I hated my mother.

351
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:46,791
[UR]
My daughter.

352
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,583
She's proof of my own life.

353
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,916
She's my tears.

354
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,458
Urtear.

355
00:21:55,958 --> 00:22:00,125
[ULTEAR] All I wanted was
to see my mother again and

356
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:03,208
to tell her that
I loved her one last time.

357
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,875
[ULTEAR] I guess this
means it's over for me.

358
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,458
My battle.

359
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:21,750
[GRAY] I wish I could say the
same but mine's just startin'.

360
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:22,916
[ULTEAR]
Be careful.

361
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,250
You can't defeat
Hades on your own.

362
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,083
[GRAY]
I figured as much.

363
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,958
But I'm not alone.

364
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:14,583
[HAPPY] The weather's turned
stormy all of a sudden!

365
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:15,916
[NATSU]
Cool!

366
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,916
The rain will set the tone
for the dramatic climax!

367
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,458
I'm fired up now!

368
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,125
[HAPPY] I thought you were gonna
be bummed 'cause if it pours

369
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:22,833
your power'll be cut in half!

370
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:24,583
[NATSU] Crap, I didn't
think about that!

371
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:27,041
Well I won't let some lousy
rain put my fire out!

372
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:28,708
[HAPPY] Ah, I see
what you did there!

373
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:30,750
That was pretty clever, Natsu!

374
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:33,333
[NATSU and HAPPY]
Next time: "Rolling Thunder"!

375
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,083
[NATSU] This is gonna be
a big battle so we'd better

376
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:36,625
hold off on the comedy.

377
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:37,666
[HAPPY]
Get over yourself!

378
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,208
I said it was
clever, not comedy!

379
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:40,333
[NATSU]
Geez!

380
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:41,666
You don't have to be
so harsh, Furball!
