he's put himself in.

for the aquatic facilities.

170
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,750
We have to pay...?

171
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,166
Forget it.
We'll just look around.

172
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,541
Uh!

173
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,708
--[ELLIS] And, jump!
--[NADIE] No wait!

174
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,458
There's also a swimsuit
rental charge,

175
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,333
we'll put it
on your bill.

176
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,208
[NADIE] Heh, heh...

177
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,250
[NADIE] Cannonball!

178
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,791
I thought you said we
didn't have any money.

179
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,458
Who even cares?

180
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,750
Oh yeah...
This's the life...

181
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,041
She fell asleep.

182
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,708
[NADIE] Let's cover her up.

183
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,291
Doubt she wants her
tummy to get burned.

184
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,833
She's so cute...

185
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,083
Like a little angel.

186
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,125
[ELLIS chuckles]

187
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,250
[NADIE] U-U-Uh?

188
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,708
What's all this?!

189
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,041
Lirio ordered
us all dinner.

190
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,333
[LIRIO laughs]

191
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,083
Uhhh, yeah I can see that.

192
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,333
[STAFF MAN B clears throat]

193
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:01,000
[NADIE] Look, the point is I
don't have near enough money...

194
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:04,458
I'll explain everything
later, just do something...

195
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,500
Please... I'm beggin'!

196
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:07,333
[BLUE-EYES sighs]

197
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:08,625
[BLUE-EYES]
All right...

198
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:12,166
It'll have to be cash,
can you get out tonight?

199
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,583
A timeframe...?

200
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,791
You know I can't
be that specific...

201
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,250
Okay, do you have a pen ready?

202
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:23,041
Huh? Wait...
You guys, hold on!

203
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,416
[LIRIO and ELLIS] Huh?

204
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,541
Never mind.

205
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,416
You're leaving?

206
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,708
I won't be long.

207
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:46,208
[distant thunder]

208
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,625
Storm rollin' in...

209
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,833
Figures, that's just my luck.

210
00:16:55,458 --> 00:17:00,416
[rainfall]

211
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,708

[L.A. chuckles]

214
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,625
What is this freak?

215
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,666
[L.A.] You're lucky
it's raining...

216
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,916
You can actually
see my attacks...

217
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,375
Though ultimately, you'll find
that is to your detriment.

218
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,875
So I must know.
Who are you, sir...?

219
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,583
The silent type.

220
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,916
Well, not that it matters...

221
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,625
Anyone who gets in my way...

222
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,375
will end up dead.

223
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,500
[lightning strikes]

224
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:31,750
Uno... Dos... Tres.

225
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,458
Waiting again tonight?

226
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,333
[LIRIO] Hm.

227
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,958
You believe in 'im.

228
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,875
I think I'll wait too...

229
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,541
for Nadie.

230
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,166
This is ridiculous...

231
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,625
After I just had
that nice shower...

232
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,000
I'd love to stay and
play some more...

233
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,916
but I'll have to wrap this up...

234
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,166
I still have my rendezvous with
Ellis to get to this evening.

235
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,291
Uno... dos...

236
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,416
...tres!

[RICARDO grunts]

239
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,583
Don't underestimate me...

240
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:50,916
I can break a mere
human being with one hand.

241
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,458
Go ahead...
Try me.

242
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,125
[L.A.] H-Heh...

243
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,375
Ya think you're fast enough
to snap my neck...

244
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,041
Before I can pull
this trigger...?

245
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,166
I'll take that bet.

246
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,416
[L.A. chuckles]

247
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,875
Not bad...

248
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,833
In fact you're pretty good,
for a human...

249
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,333
Ah!

250
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:17,458
I'll buy you a drink
in hell... amigo.

Ah!

[RICARDO] Heh.

253
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,833
'Bout damn time.

254
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,291
Where did you go?

255
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,583
Nowhere...

256
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,458
Is she still waiting
for her friend?

259
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,375
Nuh-uh.

260
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,250
We meet again.

261
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,500
Coincidence...

262
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,291
...or is it?

263
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,500
Thank you for watching her.

264
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:54,333
It's obvious...
Just look at her face.

266
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,708
Bye bye.

00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:18,833
Okay?

268
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:21,333
Hm. Okay.
