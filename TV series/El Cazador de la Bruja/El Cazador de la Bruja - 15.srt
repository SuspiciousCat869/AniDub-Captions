Yeah so...
if I don't tell you this...

4
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:58,125
It wouldn't be fair...
Because, it's about you...

5
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,125
The truth is...

00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,166
...that I'm a witch...

Yeah, with you...

It's just, you keep
looking at me.

Wha... No, I don't
keep lookin' at you!

[ANCHORMAN] Our top story
tonight...

46
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:47,125
As part of their investigation
into a massive ring

47
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:50,291
of bribery and corruption
within the Defense industry...

48
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,958
the FBI has arrested
Senator Hans Ritgen.

49
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,250
It has been alleged
that the Senator

50
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:58,125
may also have ties
within the CIA...

51
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,666
And it may be necessary
for the FBI to launch

52
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,791
a full inquiry regarding
these allegations...

53
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,625
Conceivably,
the FBI could end up

54
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,958
investigating the CIA itself...

55
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,916
A situation unprecedented in
the history of both agencies...

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,833
[ROSENBERG] I'm on my way.

57
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,250
[WEBSTER] Project Leviathan...

58
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,875
Essentially, a plan
to resurrect witches,

59
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,458
who are said to have once
existed in this world...

60
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,083
monopolize their powers
for the nation's benefit,

61
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:26,416
and use them to solidify
our financial interests...

62
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,333
Looking back now...
it was a ridiculous plan.

63
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:31,833
The program was shuttered

64
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:35,625
as the result of an
unfortunate accident.

65
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,833
The project team,
"R-Three-Three-Nine,"

66
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,333
was downsized,

67
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:42,083
with its name reassigned to
a new section in the Agency,

68
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:45,666
the Department of Unsettled
Affairs and Miscellany.

69
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,916
Yes...
Your room, Rosenberg.

70
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,166
I hear you've been in personal
contact with Senator Ritgen,

71
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,458
is that correct?

72
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:54,625
Yes.

73
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:58,500
And then...
He acted as your sponsor...

74
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:01,333
Whereby you took steps
to bring Project Leviathan

75
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:05,291
back to life...
Is that correct?

76
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,375
Resurrecting witches...

77
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:12,250
Proven to be no more than
a scientist's foolish dream...

78
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,916
So, tell me...
why would you do this?

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,500
The investigators have already
started quietly pokin' around...

80
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,958
The situation requires
that we proceed

81
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,916
with the utmost of caution.

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,333
What that project
cost this country...

83
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,458
beyond just the
financial impact:

84
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,500
Like the countless
inhumane experiments

85
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,458
conducted without
public knowledge...?

86
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,791
If it comes out that
the Company was in any way

87
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:39,333
connected to such things...
it will be disastrous.

88
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:44,000
Needless to say...
We cannot allow that.

89
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:47,291
Use up some of
that vacation time.

90
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,625
You accepted bribes
from Senator Ritgen...

91
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,166
and leaked intelligence to him

92
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,000
that would further his
political ambitions.

93
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,250
The actions of
a rogue agent...

94
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,166
The Company had absolutely
nothing to do with it.

95
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,458
I'm to be made the
sole scapegoat...

96
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,833
Of course, you must
protect the Company.

97
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,916
Not just the Company...
You as well.

98
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,416
I'll appeal to the authorities,

99
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,833
see if we can
avoid prosecution...

100
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:14,625
Naturally, that's only
if you admit your guilt.

101
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:15,958
What do you say...?

102
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,833
You haven't left yourself
much of a choice here.

103
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:27,750
[BLUE-EYES] Rosenberg...
is taking a leave of absence.

104
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,041
[B-LADY A] Seriously?

105
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,458
It would appear...

106
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,375
that another party
has taken an interest.

107
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:36,416
If Rosenberg has been removed
from the front lines...

108
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,541
Then for all intents
and purposes,

109
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:42,666
Project Leviathan is pretty much
back in the ground, right?

110
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,833
Seems so...

111
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:57,500

'bout Japan?

faces with tempura.

hot spring, but...

00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,166
Huh...? Yeah but...

[NADIE grunts]

168
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,125
Man this blows...!

169
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:41,958
Why do I always get stuck
with the hard labor?!

170
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,083
Not helping!

171
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,583
I'm in trouble.

172
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,916
Ah... I'm beat.

173
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,333
Me too!

174
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,416
I'm sorry, were you out
there digging all day?

175
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,041
What?

176
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,833
The hot spring...
You want us to come?

177
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,583
[LIRIO] Mm-Hm.

178
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,625
[ELLIS and LIRIO giggle]

179
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:15,583
Ah!

180
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:16,833
That feels good!

181
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:20,041
[ELLIS and LIRIO laugh]

182
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,416
What, you're
not going in?

183
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,583
Hell no.

184
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,708

[NADIE] Coming!

189
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,625
[NADIE sighs]

190
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,458
There we go!

194
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,041
[CHAIRWOMAN] Then let's
make it official...

195
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,791
All in agreement?

196
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,208
[BLUE-EYES] I've received
word from above...

197
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,666
We're taking Ellis into
protective custody...

198
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,083
We do know where to
find them, I assume?

199
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,666
[B-LADY A] Of course.

200
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,541
[ELLIS] Engage.

201
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:01,625
[LIRIO] Aaahhhhh...

202
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:11,166
[RICARDO] Lookin' kinda blue.

203
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,375
Hey there, you.

204
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:17,375
Ricardo... Join me?

205
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,541
Yeah, thanks.

206
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,583
Looks like this may be it...

207
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,041
Last time our paths
cross with yours.

208
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,458
Wha'dya mean?

209
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,875
[RICARDO] My contract's run out.

210
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,416
Your contract...?

211
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,083
So, you were on a job...

212
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,916
I was right...!

213
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
For who?

214
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,166
I forget.

215
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,000
[RICARDO] We'll leave
after sundown, but...

216
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,416
A favor...

217
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,083
Can you play with
Lirio until then?

218
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,083
Y-You're ri-ight...!

219

Thi-is i-is so-o
much fu-u-u-un!

220
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,875
[NADIE] That girl...

221
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,250
[NADIE] You're not
family, are you?

222
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,916
[RICARDO] It's complicated.

223
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,125
[NADIE] She's way too cute
to be your daughter anyway.

224
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,541
[RICARDO laughs]

225
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,500
[NADIE] You seem to get along.

226
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:16,750
With Lirio...

227
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:24,000
Well, she trusts me...
Let's leave it at that.

228
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,583
[NADIE sighs]

229
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,125
[NADIE] Heh.

[phone rings]

231
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,500
Yeah, it's me.

232
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:11,375
I'm goin' out for a sec...
Watch Ellis for me.

233
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,291
You sure?

234
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,583
Yeah, I'm sure...

235
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,583
It's not you
I trust, it's Lirio.

236

[RICARDO gasps]

[BLUE-EYES chuckles]

238
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,208
Been a long time...

239
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:49,000
Now remind me...
How long since we last met?

240
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,041
Hell if I know.

241
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,833
Have you lost
some weight?

242
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,750
Funny, I was
gonna say...

243
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:55,958
Never mind.

244
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:56,916
No, go on.

245
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,416
No, you're
my client...

246
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,166
Shouldn't say anything
to offend you.

247
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:06,125
[BLUE-EYES] You managed anyway.

248
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,833
[NADIE] What's this?

249
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,250
[BLUE-EYES] Payment in full.

250
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:14,416
Your fee plus expenses,
as agreed upon...

251
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,875
With a fifteen percent
bonus for your efforts.

252
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,083
What the hell?

253
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,875
Your contract ends
effective today.

You're here... Ellis...

I can sense you...

257

How I love your sweet scent!

258
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,958
Hold on a minute...!

This is all comin'
outta nowhere!

[BLUE-EYES]
I'm grateful to you...

261
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,833
You've protected Ellis
well to this point.

262
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,583
What's gonna
happen to her?

263
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,375
[BLUE-EYES] I have no
reason to tell you that.

264
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:52,208
Again... The girl
no longer concerns you.

[NADIE] Keep it...

267
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,250
I don't want your money.

268
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,041
Hold on!

269
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,916
[NADIE] My mind's made up.

270
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,166
I'm stayin' here...
by Ellis' side.

Do you even hear what you
sound like right now...?

272

I'm talking business here, and
you're talking like a child...

00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,250

Up there!

You have my
sincerest gratitude...

I came dangerously close
to harming my Ellis.

are eternally bound.

00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,708
[ELLIS] We met him that one day.

302
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,250
He told me...

303
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:10,375
that I wasn't human.

[ELLIS] Yeah... I knew.

317
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,958

you tell me before?

[NADIE gasps]

324
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:26,000
That I'm not...
That I'm not human.

Queen with my Knight.

332
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,583
Of course you will...
Bishop to King Two...

333
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,000
Checkmate.

334
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,791
[CHAIRWOMAN] The Council
will now be adjourned...

335
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:33,000
We give thanks to the
spirits of our ancestors.

336
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,833
[MELISSA]
Victory is yours, Doug.

337
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:42,000
[ROSENBERG]
Yes... that's right...

338
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:52,041
Victory is mine.

339
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:59,458
Victory is mine.

340
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:02,458
[B-LADY A] Is there something
troubling you?

341
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,291
[BLUE-EYES] The girl, Nadie...

342
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,333
[B-LADY B gasps]

343
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:06,750
[BLUE-EYES]
It's nothing, really.

344
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:12,041
Oh my...!
Where is your swimsuit?

345
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:15,916
[BLUE-EYES] In Japanese spas,
this is the swimsuit.

346
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,291
[BLUE-EYES] Nadie voided
her contract...

347
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:32,416
And as a result...

348
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,833
her resolve to continue
her journey with Ellis...

349
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:38,916
...was hardened.
