1
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:49,041
[ROSENBERG] Yes, I'm here...
Today's report, please.

2
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,500
[ROSENBERG] I understand.

3
00:01:56,875 --> 00:02:01,833
A mantle of rainbow-colored
light soars through the heavens.

4
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:06,125
Gallant is the dance of flames
that rends the land asunder...

5
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:11,208
The roar of the spray in
frenzied, spastic tumult.

6
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:14,791
They are the culmination
of all deviltry...

7
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:18,291
Where the crimson essence
ultimately leads.

8
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,708
It ends soon.

9
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,875
Melissa.

10
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:31,125
That's a pretty gun...
Does it work?

11
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,916
Try shooting it... At me.

12
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:40,166
You shouldn't make
jokes like that.

13
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,083
Yes, I'm terrible.

14
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,250
"An unusual place"?

15
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,833
Yeah... Somewhere that's...

16
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:08,958
known for being mysterious...?
Ring any bells?

17
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:12,333
No idea...
Lo siento, hon.

18
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,208
Oh... damn.

19
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:18,458
But... I'll tell ya who's full
of weird stories like that...

20
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,958
Who, the old guy?

21
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,500
[STORE OWNER]
Yeah, go ask him.

22
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:26,583
But he ain't right in the head.
Don't say I didn't warn ya.

23
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,583
[OLD MAN]
 "Unusual," huh?

24
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,375
[NADIE] Yeah, know
any 'round here?

25
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:41,000
[OLD MAN] Every place
around here is unusual...

26
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:44,416
Well... compared to
the city, that is.

27
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,500
[NADIE] Uh, yeah... not quite
what I was gettin' at.

28
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,708
[OLD MAN] So,
on vacation, are ya?

29
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:54,208
Sure...

30
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,125
You are greatly
mistaken, my dear,

31
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:59,458
if you believe you will
always get what you seek...

32
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,458
You mustn't seek.

33
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,625
Yeah, thanks, Pops...
That's deep n' stuff...

34
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:09,208
You take care now... Maybe I'll
catch ya on the flipside.

35
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,708
There is a place called
the Witches' Village.

36
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,333
[NADIE] Waitaminnit...
Witches?!

37
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:20,333
That's totally what I'm after!
So, uh, where is this village?

38
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,041
[OLD MAN]
Hey... easy...

39
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,416
[NADIE] Uh... Sorry.

40
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:30,000
[NADIE] That way...?
In those mountains?

41
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,291
Three mountain peaks over...

42
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:37,041
then maybe five days
by horse and carriage.

43
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,958
Three mountains, five days
by horse and carriage...?

44
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:45,541
Seriously? That's pretty far...
What's this place like?

45
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,375
It's not there anymore.

46
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,083
What?

47
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:54,875
It fell to ruin... 'bout ten
years ago, if I recall.

48
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:02,166
Fell to ruin...?
How come?

49
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,166
[OLD MAN] There was
a terrible fire.

50
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,708
So, what about
the people there?

51
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:12,416
Ohh... Died or fled...
Don't quite know...

52
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:18,000
These witches...
They really existed?

53
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:22,416
Sure... A couple of them
even lived in this town...

54
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,208
They came from that
village in the hills.

55
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,708
No way!

56
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,208
[OLD MAN] They kept their
identities hidden...

57
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:33,458
so very few people knew
about them... That's because

58
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,833
their village did not approve
of contact with outsiders.

59
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,041
[NADIE] Where are
those people now?

60
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,625
[OLD MAN sighs]

61
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,791
[L.A. giggles]

62
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,333
Aw... 'Zat your daughter?

63
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:04,750
No, it's my wife.

64
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,208
[NADIE] Hm?

65
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,916
That's Zaida... She fell ill
when she was very young...

66
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,416
She was such a beautiful woman.

67
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,708
She sure was.

68
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,791
[OLD MAN]
She was also a witch.

69
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,333
[NADIE gasps]

70
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,208
[L.A. giggles]

71
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,541
[OLD MAN] Zaida didn't have much
in the way of magic powers...

72
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,833
Lighting candles, heating up
water and the like...

73
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:51,666
And you'd never want to go near
her with a deck of cards...

74
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,041
But the Witches of old...

75
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:59,125
Water, land... sky...
It was almost as if

76
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:02,833
they could control
anything they imagined...

77
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,458
Supposedly they
could bring about

78
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:08,416
abundant harvests with
their amazing powers.

79
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,041
They were Gods,
if you will... Goddesses.

80
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:15,458
[NADIE] Well, yeah, if they
used their powers for good...

81
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,000
Uh...?

82
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:20,291
But if they chose to use their
powers for evil purposes...

83
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:23,625
they weren't Goddesses.

84
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,541
'Cause in the Old Testament...

85
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:29,583
There are stories about a
great beast with evil powers...

86
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:33,083
It's called... Leviathan.

87
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,708
[OLD MAN] It seems the
witches who left the village

88
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,750
gradually lost their powers...

89
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,375
Perhaps this world
sullied them...

90
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:52,291
or maybe the power is
in the village itself.

91
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,625
[OLD MAN] If it's
mere curiosity,

92
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,916
I'd advise against going...

93
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,250
Life isn't always
about forging ahead...

94
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:06,333
Sometimes you need
the courage to turn back.

95
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:07,666
Did you find anything?

96
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,083
[NADIE] Huh?

97
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,625
Yeah, sorta...
Buy that?

98
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:12,833
Not yet.

99
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,541
But you like it, right?

100
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:18,208
"The incandescent flames of
love burn deep within my heart."

101
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:21,208
"However... We no
longer have enough money

102
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,333
to fill our gas tank."

103
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,125
We don't?

104
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,916
Yeah, not so much.

105
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,666
Then I won't get it...
Should we get jobs?

106
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,791
Guess so... We're real close
to Wiñay Marka, y'know.

107
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,250
[ELLIS gasps]

108
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,583
[NADIE] I found out where it is.

109
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:38,666
Really?

110
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,291
[NADIE] Mm hmm.

111
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:41,291
[ELLIS] Nadie!

112
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,833
[NADIE] Easy...
Too hot for hugs.

113
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,000
[NADIE] Thanks again, Pops...

114
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:52,083
But I have to go...
For her sake...

115
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:55,875
Because I'm sure we'll
find some answers there.

116
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,791
[MELISSA] Is there something
you're wanting to get?

117
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:04,000
You buy me more than enough of
the things I want, darling...

118
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,916
So, I thought... for once,
why don't we just go out

119
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,708
with no real
purpose in mind.

120
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:14,125
Suppose it'll
rain on us, then.

121
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,375
Did you notice? Inca rose...

122
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:21,458
Remember, Doug? The first
present you ever gave me.

123
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,833
They look great
on you, Melissa.

124
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,041
[MELISSA] You told me the
power these stones have...

125
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:29,416
They make you forget
past unpleasantries...

126
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,083
and awaken passions
left lying dormant...

127
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,958
[ROSENBERG] I'm surprised
you remember.

128
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,750
[MELISSA] Well, it's exactly
how things turned out, Doug...

129
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,083
I'm so much happier now...

130
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,250
Let's have a fabulous day.

131
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:54,875
Yes... One we
will never forget.

132
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,875
[NADIE] Man,
we're strikin' out...

133
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,583
[ELLIS] There's no work here.

134
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,750
[NADIE] Yeah, findin' day
labor in a town this small

135
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,583
is gonna be rough... Figures.

136
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:13,958
We can try this.

137
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,458
That won't even buy bread.

138
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:16,958
[NADIE's stomach rumbles]

139
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:21,500
Damn it... Even the mention
of food is makin' me hungry.

140
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:22,958
That's kinda obvious.

141
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,375
Well, excuse me.

142
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,458
[ELLIS's stomach rumbles]

143
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,458
Uh-huh... Sounds
like you are too.

144
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,166
Well, excuse me.

145
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,208
[ELLIS] Bread.

146
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,916
Lirio... What...
You're giving us that?

147
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,791
[LIRIO giggles]

148
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,458
Wow, thank you!

149
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,750
[RICARDO] Broke again, huh?

150
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,083
What can ya do, right?

151
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,416
There's always somethin'
to spend it on...

152
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,208
I hear ya, we're in
the same boat...

153
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,166
So I found a way to
make a little cash.

154
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,208
Really?
You got a bounty?

155
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,666
[RICARDO] Wanna team up on it?

156
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,166
Yeah?

157
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,625
[RICARDO] It was Lirio's idea.

158
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,583
[LIRIO giggles]

159
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,333
Hey, thanks, guys...
but right now...
