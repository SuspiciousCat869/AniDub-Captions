thought I was a weirdo.

be negative people...

That's just the way
of the world...

The way to handle it...

148
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,458
is to ignore all that negative
stuff that comes your way...

Keep the pain and heartache
from taking over...

to makin' it out alive.

practice can I do it too?

Then let's get 'em.

169
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,041
Hm. Too bad the weather
doesn't want to cooperate.

170
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:01,500
[TRANSVESTITE B] I know.
Depressing, isn't it?

171
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:11,875
[L.A.] Heh.

172
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,083
[gunshot]

173
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,458
[bullet shells clatter]

174
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,750
[LIRIO chuckles]

175
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,541
[POLICEMAN A] Thought you walked
away from the game ages ago.

176
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,208
[RICARDO] Well...
lot's happened since then.

177
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,500
[POLICEMAN A] Who's the niña?

178
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,375
Sure as hell ain't
one of yours, is she?

179
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,041
Seriously, how many bounty
hunters drag a kid around

180
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,750
with 'em everywhere...?

181
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:38,166
What, y'think you're in some
Japanese samurai show?

182
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,750
You quit, huh...?

183
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,041
What's that s'posed to be,

184
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,791
some weak attempt at
cleaning up your act?

185
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:54,500
Well, I got a family now,
gotta take care of them.

186
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,166
[RICARDO] "Champion of
justice" now, are ya?

187
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,375
Wish I could say it's
made life any easier...

188
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,166
Kinda how the world
tends to work...

189
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,000
So hey...

190
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,250
[POLICEMAN A] Oh yeah...

191
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,791
...the bounty I mentioned
to you earlier...?

192
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,083
They're headed south.

193
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,666
South where?

194
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,875
Not sure, the girl doesn't seem
to know much more than that...

195
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,833
Though I'm willing to bet the
bounty hunter who was with her

196
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,500
would prob'ly know.

197
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:22,666
Your target, it's a little
blonde girl named Ellis?

198
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,625
[RICARDO]
Don't actually know yet.

199
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,166
Some friendly
advice, Ricardo...

200
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,375
Wash your hands of this
business while you can.

201
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,833
[LIRIO giggles]

202
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:37,666
[RICARDO] Lirio.

203
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,083
[LIRIO] Huh?

204
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,791
[LIRIO giggles]

205
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:45,208
The days of putting your
life on the line are over.

206
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,666
Take it easy.

207
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,666
[NADIE] Hm. Could stand
to be a bit spicier.

208
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,333
[ELLIS] Open.

209
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,750
Did you get 'em...?

210
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,250
Ellis?!

211
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,750
I'm cut.

212
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,666
Aw damn...

213
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,041
Put pressure on it...

214
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,333
Here.

215
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,541
[NADIE] Let's see, bandage...

216
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,583
Wonder if there's a first
aid kit here somewhere.

217
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:49,500
[NADIE] Ellis!

218
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:50,833
[ELLIS gasps]

219
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:54,041
What are you doing...?
You're bleeding all over.

220
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,125
[NADIE] Has it stopped?

221
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,791
Taste good?

222
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,041
Your blood...? No...

223
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:10,916
Wait, if I say yes...
does that make me a vampire?

224
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,000
[NADIE] There.

225
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,333
That should do it.

226
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,666
Be careful...

227
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,000
You may have
superhuman powers...

228
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,083
but you are still
human, all right?

229
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,208
Human?

230
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:26,000
Yeah, human...
You bleed red don'tcha?

231
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:31,125
Guess so.

232
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,916
You are one odd bird, Ellis.

233
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,625
I'm a human-bird.

234
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,458
That's them.

235
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,250
Duh...
What am I, blind?

236
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,250
[gasps]

237
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,416
[L.A.] Heh.

238
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,333
The hell?

239
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,291
Out of the way
or we shoot!

240
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,625
[gasps]

241
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,083
Bastard!

242
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,458
Get back here
right now!

243
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:15,583
Damn it...

244
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,416
We'll never
get across now.

245
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,125
Wanna go back
to the car...?

246
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,583
We can hide and
set a trap for them.

247
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,333
Fine with me...

248
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,208
It's all we can do.

249
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:29,166
But still... who
the hell was that?

250
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,750
Sorry, this may
taste like crap...

251
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,708
but it's a whole hell of
a lot better than starvin'...

252
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,083
Cool... It's ready.

253
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,583
Ellis.

254
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:42,791
[ELLIS] Hm?

255
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,083
Put it down.

256
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,666
[ELLIS] I was just
looking at it.

257
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,208
Right now.

258
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,708
'Kay.

259
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:55,208
That is not a toy.

260
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,416
[ELLIS] Are you mad?

261
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,750
[NADIE] Huh?

262
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,541
[NADIE sighs]

263
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,458
No Ellis, I'm not mad...

264
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,250
Just don't touch it again okay?

265
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,125
Yeah, okay...

266
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,291
Time to eat.

267
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,500
What is that?

268
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,375
[ELLIS] He's pretending
to be a bounty.

269
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,750
[NADIE] Thank you
Lord for this meal.

270
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,541
[ELLIS mumbles]
Thank you for the meal.

271
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,291
[LIZARD belches]

272
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,083
Your turn to say it.

273
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,333
[NADIE] "I'm not
gonna say 'thank you'

274
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,625
if it didn't even taste good."

275
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,958
That's the
look on his face.

276
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,958
At least he was
being honest.

277
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,208
It was that bad?

278
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,250
[ELLIS] Well...
Better than not eating at all.

279
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,833
Wow, no mercy, huh...?

280
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,375
Not, that I really care...

281
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,833
'Kay Ellis...
you clean up.

282
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:56,958
Why me?

283
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,666
I cooked, so you
get to clean.

284
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,500
That's just
the way it works.

285
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:02,375
[ELLIS] Hm?

286
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,125
Go on, it won't
take long.

Yes sir.

I heard something.

Stay where you are.

[door closes]

292
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,750
[ELLIS] Find 'em?

No one there.

just taking a little nap.

Who're you?

As of now...
it doesn't quite matter...

299
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,208
But soon enough...

300
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:57,166
You'll find I will be a very
important part of your life.

Who are you...?
A bounty hunter?

I am... always watching...

305
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:14,125
I just wanted to
tell you in person.

[NADIE] Huh?

313
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,083
He said he'll
be watching me.

Okay...

I hope you don't find the nerve
to act at your own discretion...

I'd like to be able to
trust you in the coming weeks.

Yeah...

I sleep sitting up
all the time...

In fact I actually
sleep better this way.

but my dear Ellis
needs her rest.

333
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,666
Okay, time to
say goodbye.

334
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,000
Really?

335
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,333
Uh-huh.

336
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,166
O-kay.

337
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:46,208
Buh-bye...
Take care now.

338
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,000
Oh yeah...

339
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,041
Thank you, sir...
You were a big help.

340
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,708
Buh-bye...
Take care now.

341
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,125
[door squeaks closed]

342
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,666
[engine starts]

343
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,000
Cool...
Southward bound!

344
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,000
Let's go!

345
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,708
I'm watching... Ellis.

346
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,375
[BLUE-EYES] His name is L.A...

347
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:39,083
But his background...
is unknown.
