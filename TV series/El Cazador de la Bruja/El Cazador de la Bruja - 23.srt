1
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:47,041
[L.A.]
Ellis... Help me...

2
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:52,625
I was... I was tricked...
I realize that now.

3
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:59,791
I will demolish that
bastard... Oh, yes...!

4
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,833
With my own hands!!

5
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:09,083
[L.A.] So... I have to keep my
composure... remain myself...

6
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:10,916
no matter what.

7
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:16,041
[L.A.] It's...
It's this thing...

8
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,583
[L.A.] Damn you!!

9
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:20,833
[L.A. grunts]

10
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,750
[L.A.] Get out...
Get out from inside me...

11
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,500
Rosenberg...

12
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:35,458
[L.A. laughs maniacally]

13
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:39,000
[BLUE-EYES]
The heart... is frail.

14
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:00,833
Was it... me...?

15
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,208
I did... this?

16
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:13,916
[ELLIS] So I did do this...
I did this... to Nadie.

17
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,833
You did.

18
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,416
[ELLIS] I see.

19
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,833
[ELLIS] I'm sorry, Nadie...
I'm so sorry.

20
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,833
[RICARDO] Was that for the best?

21
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,625
You could have just lied to her.

22
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,083
[BLUE-EYES] Do you really
think she'd have been

23
00:03:56,166 --> 00:04:02,166
satisfied with that...?
She isn't stupid... Besides...

24
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,583
Lying won't help
the situation.

25
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:10,083
[BLUE-EYES] You see... there
was once a group of people

26
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,875
known as Witches...
But as time passed...

27
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:19,500
they lost their powers... and
became beings of mere legend.

28
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,291
Recently, science roused the
legend from its slumber...

29
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:26,500
Ellis is a witch made
by the hands of man...

30
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,208
She is not a child of God...

31
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:33,041
However, she was endowed
with amazing powers...

32
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,541
[BLUE-EYES] The same
powers the witches lost.

33
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,250
Thanks, Lirio.

34
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,083
[LIRIO giggles]

35
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,750
[BLUE-EYES] It has begun.

36
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:31,125
[NADIE] Uhh...
So I guess I'm not dead?

37
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,000
Nadie!

38
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:41,000
How 'bout...
some water?

39
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,791
Nadie...

40
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,625
[NADIE gasps]

41
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:51,500
She'll be fine...
I'm sure she's just relieved.

42
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,750
Thirsty?

43
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,458
'Preciate it.

44
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:20,083
Not to sound mean,
but why are you here?

45
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:23,833
To thank you... I mean,
you did save my life.

46
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,875
[NADIE] Hm.

47
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,333
Would you stop looking
at me like that...?

48
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,500
I promise it's not drugged.

49
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,208
[NADIE groans]

50
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,958
Ugh... Bitter.

51
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,166
It's coffee, Nadie.

52
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,041
If it's not strong,
what's the point?

53
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,791
[NADIE] I feel like
an invalid here.

54
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,875
You're fine now,
aren't you...?

55
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,625
Ellis should have healed
all your injuries.

56
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,958
A witch... huh?

57
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:58,833
Yes... The same as me.

58
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:01,250
Here I thought you had
something important to say.

59
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:05,416
I see... That's why you
told me that story before.

60
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,541
Right.

61
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,625
So what's your objective?

62
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:12,458
Which one?
Official? Or personal?

63
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:16,666
Wait... Hold on...
So you're actually a witch?

64
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,875
I told you I am, didn't I?

65
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,833
Do you believe me?

66
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:28,708
Try turning this into iced
coffee... Then maybe I will.

67
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,291
Yeah, fine.

68
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,791
Wha... For real?

69
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,083
Um... Yeah, not so much.

70
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,916
[BLUE-EYES] I'm descended
from the witches...

71
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,458
But... I don't have
their powers...

72
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:54,291
The powers known as magic...

73
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:57,708
I yearned for them...
researched them...

74
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:05,125
I tried every way imaginable...
But to no avail...

75
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:09,833
I was left with nothing...
Almost nothing...

76
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:13,916
There was the overwhelming
feeling of desolation...

77
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,291
But my sense of yearning
never subsided...

78
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:21,166
In fact, it continued to grow
stronger and stronger.

79
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,875
[RICARDO] So that's why...

80
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:27,291
[BLUE-EYES] I wanted to
see one... a real witch...

81
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:30,041
I thought if I could
touch her powers...

82
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:34,916
maybe it would spark
something in me too.

83
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,458
That was my personal mission.

84
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,000
And the official?

85
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,666
[BLUE-EYES]
To protect our people...

86
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,583
There was a government
project that tried

87
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,583
to recreate the witches
under the guise

88
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:50,583
of helping the nation...
That part you know.

89
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:08,708
[BLUE-EYES] Our people did not
look kindly upon the project...

90
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,708
The Witches were beings
who were laid to rest

91
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,916
by the passage of time...

92
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,708
Their slumber should not have
been disturbed so casually...

93
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:21,125
Nor should Man have ever been
given control over our kind.

94
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:26,208
[BLUE-EYES] That's why our
people set out to do everything

95
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:30,458
within our means... and
though it took some time...

96
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:35,708
We drove the project into
the ground... But then...

97
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,583
[BLUE-EYES] One man...

98
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:44,041
One man relit the candle that
was supposed to be extinguished.

99
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,916
[BLUE-EYES]
Rosenberg...

100
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,500
And it is my job to put a
stop to his sinister designs.

101
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:57,000
[BLUE-EYES] But I abandoned
the job before I could finish.

102
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,625
[NADIE] Abandoned?

103
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,541
[BLUE-EYES]
It's like I told you...

104
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,666
I wanted to see a
witch in person...

105
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,875
So, when I was ordered to
bring Ellis into custody...

106
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,583
[RICARDO] I had no idea
that's what you were up to.

107
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,875
[BLUE-EYES] Considering no
one's shown up to replace me...

108
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,333
I assume they must have
scrapped that plan, though...

109
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,291
Honestly, I'm just glad I
didn't follow through with it.

110
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,250
[NADIE] What was
up with Ellis...?

111
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,916
It's like she was
possessed... Or...

112
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,083
[ELLIS pants]

113
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,208
[ELLIS] A mantle of
rainbow-colored light

114
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,458
soars through the heavens.

115
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:39,166
Gallant is the dance of flames
that rends the land asunder...

116
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,833
The roar of the spray in
frenzied, spastic tumult...

117
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:47,708
They are the culmination
of all deviltry...

118
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:51,333
Where the crimson essence
ultimately leads.

119
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,916
It's a passage from the
legends of our people...

120
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,166
It celebrates
the great powers...

121
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,000
that only the true
witches possess.

122
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,541
The true... witches...

123
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,750
Earth, water, the sky...
You're sayin' they're capable

124
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,875
of manipulating all
things under the sun?

125
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,000
[BLUE-EYES] Yes.

126
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,625
They're gods.

127
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:21,583
Well... They have...
the power of gods.

128
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:26,166
And that power...
is what Rosenberg seeks...

129
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,458
There's no way to be certain how
much of the text he's read...

130
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,500
but without a doubt...

131
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:36,333
Ellis was found to have
that same capacity.

132
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,708
[ELLIS] I get it.

133
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,250
[NADIE gasps]

134
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,541
[ELLIS] Finally, the truth.

135
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,666
Ellis.

136
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,833
[gunshot]

137
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,000
[bullet shells clatter]

138
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,291
Still no luck?

139
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,791
She won't even say
one word to me...

140
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,458
I'm sure it's because
of what you said.

141
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,666
In time, she would
have found out...

142
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,166
Besides...
It's not too late for you.

143
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,500
[NADIE] What?

144
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,958
I mean, there's still time
for you to turn back...

145
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,416
I never could figure her out...

146
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,041
She's just so pure...
so innocent.

147
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,208
Yeah, same goes for me...

148
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:34,333
I spent so much time tryin'
to keep up with her...

149
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,083
I couldn't just let her go.

150
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:39,583
We have that in common.

151
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,541
Well, whaddaya know...

152
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:46,458
That's why... I want to let
Ellis choose for herself...

153
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:50,000
to discover her
own path in life.

154
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:54,166
After all... staying
true to one's own heart...

155
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,500
That's what's most
important, right?

156
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,958
Oh, my... Another hot day...

157
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:06,875
Yesterday's storm
was your doing, yes?

158
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,666
Wait a sec...
How'd you know?

159
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,583
Of course I know...

160
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,916
I know everything about
the power of the witches.

161
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,291
Well, I don't want...
any of that.

162
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,250
It's a power...

163
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:25,916
that only the noble chosen
are permitted to possess...

164
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,958
Wanting has very
little to do with it.

165
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,166
Don't want it.

166
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,625
Why not?

167
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,791
Because it hurts the
people I care about.

168
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,500
That all depends
on you, dear...

169
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:41,250
Power can be used for
good or evil... And while

170
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:44,583
it may have overwhelmed
you a bit yesterday...

171
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:48,958
in due time, you will learn
to impose your will on it...

172
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:52,625
Once you have, you'll
never hurt anyone again.

173
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,750
[ELLIS] I don't want it.

174
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,541
[OLD MAN] Hm?

175
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,333
[NADIE] Uh oh.

176
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,875
[OLD MAN sighs]

177
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,250
[NADIE] Ellis.

178
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,666
Where're you going?
Talk to me.

179
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:36,458
[ELLIS] Bye bye...
Nadie.

180
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,000
Hold on!

181
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:45,000
[BLUE-EYES] Nadie...
You can't go after her.

182
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,958
[NADIE] But...
she was crying.

183
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,416
[BLUE-EYES] I know...

184
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,041
But Ellis needs to try to
find the answers on her own.

185
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,625
[NADIE] No... you just
don't get it, do you?

186
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,666
For her sake,
let her be...

187
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,333
That is what it means
to be free, right?

188
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,666
[NADIE] Not even a little bit...

189
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,625
Ellis is lost...
and she's suffering...

190
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:10,541
How am I supposed
to leave her alone?

191
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,708
That's called
being a meddler.

192
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,125
[NADIE] I thought I was
free for a long time...

193
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,125
'cause I was alone...

194
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,583
It's not that I wouldn't
depend on anyone...

195
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,916
It's that I couldn't. Even when
I went down the wrong path,

196
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,541
I had no one to
steer me right again.

197
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,000
[NADIE] You think freedom
is such a good thing...

198
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,875
But you'll find out
soon enough...

199
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:39,125
Being free's actually harder...
and more painful.

200
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,041
Nadie...

201
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:44,083
[NADIE] Guess I
wanted someone...

202
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:47,958
who would be there
for me... Always have.

203
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:55,083
She's got a good soul...
That's why Ellis

204
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:58,791
opened her heart to Nadie
in the first place...

205
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,583
I don't think those two
should ever be apart.

206
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,500
[ELLIS] You wanna come with me?

207
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,166
Ellis...

208
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,791
[ELLIS] Do you wanna...
come with?

209
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,916
[L.A.] To Wiñay Marka?

210
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,583
[ELLIS] Not there.

211
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:50,291
How 'bout...
somewhere... far away?

212
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:08,000
Thanks, lemme know
if you happen to see her.

213
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,208
[BLUE-EYES] Nadie,
get in... I found Ellis.

214
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,000
[ELLIS] You like it?

215
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,458
[L.A.] Well, you bought it
for me, didn't you...?

216
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,750
So of course, it's
delicious... Thank you.

217
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,041
[ELLIS] Let's get
moving once we finish.

218
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,375
[L.A.] Sounds good to me...
My darling.

219
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,750
[phone rings]

220
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,916
[L.A. gasps]

221
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:49,833
[L.A. screams]

222
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,375
L.A.?

223
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,291
Hey, Blue-Eyes.

224
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,791
[BLUE-EYES] Hm?

225
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:59,166
I was out of line
earlier... Sorry...

226
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,791
You're actually a pretty
good person, aren't you?

227
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,041
Now I see.

228
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:09,916
I think I understand...
what he was saying back there.

229
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,916
"He" who?

230
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,541
[BLUE-EYES] Ricardo.

231
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:16,583
He said something...?
About me?

232
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:19,541
Well, it really
wasn't anything big.

233
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:22,875
I didn't have any particular
reason when I picked you...

234
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,416
so I guess I just got lucky.

235
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,250
Odd choice of words for
the person who betrayed you.

236
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,958
Remember, though,
I'm a traitor too.

237
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,750
Um... Oh, yeah, right.

238
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,333
[L.A. cries]

239
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:40,833
What's the matter...?
L.A. Are you okay?

240
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,375
[L.A.] But I broke it...
that bastard...

241
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,416
Damn you, Rosenberg!

242
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,875
[ELLIS gasps]

243
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:54,333
[L.A.] Damn it! Damn it!
I'm somebody...! I'm me!!

244
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,875
[L.A. yells]

245
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:04,166
Ahh... That's much better...
He's gone now... Thank goodness.

246
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:15,083
[L.A.] Everything's
okay now... Ellis.

247
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,208
[L.A.] Ellis?

248
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,750
[L.A.] Where are
you going...? Wait...

249
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:26,375
We're together now... Ellis!

250
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,666
Ellis.

251
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,541
I won't let go...
No matter what.

252
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,875
[ELLIS] Why wouldn't you...?

253
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:58,666
I don't want to
hurt you anymore...

254
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,416
That's why I said goodbye.

255
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,583
[NADIE] Dummy...

256
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:08,166
Say something
like that again...

257
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,791
and I promise I'll
never forgive you.

258
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,250
[NADIE] You're so
little, and yet...

259
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:19,708
you're thinking about such
big things all by yourself.

260
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,416
[ELLIS] Yeah, but...

261
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,416
[NADIE] Try putting
yourself in my shoes...

262
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,958
We want to get to
Wiñay Marka, right...?

263
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:31,375
Isn't that why we've
come all this way...?

264
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,708
I've made up my mind,
you know...

265
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:37,833
I'm going to protect you
with everything I've got.

266
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:40,041
So you don't
have to worry...

267
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,916
I don't care about
some witch's powers...

268
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,583
If we make it to Wiñay Marka...

269
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:50,375
we may find the answers we've
been looking for all this time.

270
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,041
It'll be fine...

271
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,625
I'll be by your side no
matter what happens...

272
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,666
and I will never
let you suffer alone.

273
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,750
Okay...? Partner?

274
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,125
Yes sir.

275
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:19,166
[BLUE-EYES] The heart
is frail... But...

276
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,791
when two hearts are
there for one another,

277
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:25,791
they are stronger... than steel.

278
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,041
Feel anything?

279
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:46,041
No, I don't feel a thing.

280
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,333
What is this place?

281
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:07,875
Ladies, I have been waiting...
for both of you.

282
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:11,416
Oh, yeah...?
Who are you?

283
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,708
[ROSENBERG chuckles]

284
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:14,833
I know him.

285
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,000
[NADIE] What?

286
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:19,833
I do... I know him.

287
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:24,041
It has been a
long time... Ellis.
