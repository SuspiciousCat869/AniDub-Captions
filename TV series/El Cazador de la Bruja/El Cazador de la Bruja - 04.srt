That's right, girlie-girl!

If the situation
demands it, yes.

This is a detailed list
of the expenses you filed...

have been clearly marked...

[BLUE-EYES] Following the murder
of a prominent physicist,

a young girl was made

and a bounty placed on her head.

Dr. Heinz Schneider...

[BLUE-EYES] According to her
traveling companion's reports...

125
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,750
Ellis is currently missing
portions of her memory

126
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,666
concerning the incident.

127

[BLUE-EYES] Why was
Dr. Schneider killed...?

128

Was Ellis truly
the perpetrator...?

If we cannot restore
her lost memory,

remain unanswered.

we will smite them.

that reassuring...

types are good at hiding.

way to handle it?

surely crumble...

00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,666
No!

335
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:03,125
No... I don't wanna
do that anymore!

336
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:03,916
I don't wanna!

337
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,291
[HEINZ sighs]

338
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,250
Ellis...

339
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,958
[KID ELLIS] Don't wanna.

340
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:20,583
All right then...
No more examinations...

341
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,500
We won't do them anymore...

342
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,208
I promise.

343
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:31,375
I cross my heart... Deal?

344
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,583
Ellis...

345
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,958
[KID ELLIS] You really promise?

346
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,666
Yeah... I promise.

347
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,666
Doctor...

348
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,833
Ready to hit the road...?

349
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,000
Aaand still asleep.

350
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,416
[NADIE chuckles]

351
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,000
Doctor...

352
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:09,708
[NADIE gasps]

353
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:38,125
[BLUE-EYES] One thing
Ellis is not...

354
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,333
...is a child of God.
