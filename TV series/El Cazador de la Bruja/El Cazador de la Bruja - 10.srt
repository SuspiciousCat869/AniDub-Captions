00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,250
No prob...!

168
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,041
I'll run home and get
things ready for them.

169
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:55,833
All right.

170
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,500
Make yourselves comfy.

171
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,500
Thanks, we will.

172
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,041
[ANTONIO] She's somethin', huh?

173
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,666
Yeah... So kind and cheerful.

174
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,958
You have a lovely wife.

175
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,083
Are you here for me?

176
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,625
Say what?

177
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,333
[ANTONIO]
Marquez hired you, right?

178
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,375
Marquez?

179
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,875
We got those.

180
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,125
Real close, Ellis.

181
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,500
You can drop the act.

182
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,750
[ELLIS] Oh...

183
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,000
[NADIE] I think you've
got the wrong idea...

184
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,125
I don't know anyone
named Marquez...

185
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,041
And we didn't come
here looking for you.

186
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,416
Then what was that when
you shook my hand before?

187
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,333
Oh, that...
That was about your hand.

188
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,583
What?

189
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,708
[NADIE] Your hand,
is used to holding a gun.

190
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,041
I can tell.

191
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,791
Just like mine is...

192
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:47,000
Your hand has become
molded to this shape.

193
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,458
[NADIE] So then...
You're a target?

194
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,833
[ANTONIO sighs]

195
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:57,916
For a real long time...
I made my life by killing.

196
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,625
But three years ago, I screwed
up and got sent to jail...

197
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,208
That's where I met Marquez...

198
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,666
He was serving a life sentence.

199
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:11,875
[ANTONIO] Margarita is...
Marquez's woman.

200
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,500
I had some friends who were
able to pull some strings...

201
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,291
so I managed to get
out after two years...

202
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,125
Before I left...

203
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,833
Marquez asked me
to do something...

204
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,750
He asked me to...

205
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,250
...kill Margarita.

206
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,625
Why would he do that?

207
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,041
[ANTONIO] Because he loved her.

208
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,250
Marquez was in for life...

209
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:43,125
He was never going to be able
to love Margarita again.

210
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,083
He would've rather
seen Margarita dead,

211
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:51,500
than find her in the
arms of... another man.

212
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,958
But... you
couldn't kill her.

213
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:03,791
[ANTONIO] Because...
when I actually saw her...

214
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:09,583
[MARGARITA giggles]

215
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,958
[ANTONIO] I saw the
face of a true angel.

216
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,125
[gunshot]

217

[bullet shells clatter]

218
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,583
[BARKEEP] Here you go.

219
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:27,666
[RICARDO] Una más.

220
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,666
[BARKEEP] Bueno.

00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,583
[LIRIO whimpers]

222
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,708
Lirio... Hey!

223
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,000
[BARKEEP] Huh?

224
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,458
Make it again...

225
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,583
I told you not too spicy.

226
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:44,250
[BARKEEP] Oh... You did?
Sorry, forgot.

227
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,458
[LIRIO sighs]

228
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:46,916
[RICARDO] You okay?

229
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:52,416
[EYE-PATCH] If it isn't Ricardo.

230
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,666
[EYE-PATCH] Long time no see.

231
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,916
Oh, you... Not as
dead as I'd hoped.

232
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,625
[EYE-PATCH] Who's the kid?

233
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,041
[RICARDO] What are
you doing here?

234
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,041
[EYE-PATCH] I believe
I asked you first.

235
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,083
[RICARDO] So you're
here chasing a bounty.

236
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,750
[EYE-PATCH] Just don't
try'n take my find.

237
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,583
[LIRIO gasps]

238

[RICARDO slurps]

239
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,291
[RICARDO] Make it again.

240
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:23,958
Now what...?
It's not spicy this time.

241
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,541
Tastes bad.

242
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,958
[ROSENBERG chuckles]

243
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,958
Like putty in my hands...

244
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,250
Go then...

245
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:48,375
With even greater
exultation in your heart...

246
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:49,416
Go...

247
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,458
And finally awaken...

248
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,791
the true Ellis.

249
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:22,875
[ANTONIO] When I met Margarita,
I put my past behind me...

250
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:27,541
I swore I would never harm
another human being again.

251
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,875
[NADIE] Have you
told Margarita this?

252
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,208
[ANTONIO] No...

253
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,875
...not yet.

254
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:39,083
I dunno, maybe
it's good for 'em...

255
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,958
A married couple can
have at least one secret.

256
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,208
[ELLIS] Nadie.

257
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,791
[NADIE] What're you
still doin' awake?

258
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,125
We're like them.

259
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,625
[NADIE] Huh?

260
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,416
[ELLIS] You came after me,
but we learned to get along...

261
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,458
And now, we're both
being targeted.

262
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,875
Oh... I guess...

263
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,875
[NADIE thinking] My true
objective is to protect Ellis...

264
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,291
But to her...

265
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:06,416
I'm still just a bounty hunter,
who came for her head.

266
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,666
I suppose...

267
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,208
in her own way...

268
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,916
she's accepted that.

269
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,791
You know...
We do smile.

270
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,166
Yeah, I know.

271
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,125
[ELLIS] It's okay
to smile, isn't it?

272
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,583
Well of course,
you bet it is.

273
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,166
Okay...

00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:35,083
Is Ellis bein' smart
about this, or stupid?!

333
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,291
I'll go.

334
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,916
She's my partner.

335
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,166
Yeah, but he doesn't
know that...

336
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,375
I'm the one he wants...

337
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,458
I'll go!

338
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,083
[MARGARITA] Antonio.

339
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,458
I overheard you
talking before...

340
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:50,125
You know Marquez, don't you?

341
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,791
Why would
Marquez want me...

342
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,458
[ANTONIO sighs]

343
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:57,916
Please, love...
Tell me everything.

344
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Margarita...

345
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,083
C'mon you bastard...

346
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,875
What the hell're you do--

347
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:10,083
Don't move! Sit back
down or you're dead!

348
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,208
[ELLIS chuckles]

349
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,208
Damn I friggin' hate kids...

350
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,250
What the hell does
Marquez see in her...?

351
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,416
He's twisted, but still...

352
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,916
I see...

353
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
So that's why Marquez...
wants to have me...

354
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,625
But there's more...

355
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,333
[MARGARITA] You were
the first person he sent.

356
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,125
Am I right?

357
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,416
You must be...

358
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,458
disappointed with me,
to say the least...

359
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,875
[MARGARITA]
Yes, I am disappointed.

360
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,833
Margarita...

361
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,291
[MARGARITA] I wish you would
have told me all this sooner.

362
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,083
[NADIE and ANTONIO] Huh?

363
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,875
Wedding ceremony or not...

364
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,416
You and I are husband
and wife, 'Tonio...

365
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,000
We should never keep
secrets from each other.

366
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,666
Margarita...

367
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,291
[MARGARITA chuckles]

368
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,791
[ANTONIO sighs in content]

369
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,375
Well,
that's that...

370
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,250
So if you two
lovebirds don't mind,

371
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,291
I'm gonna go rescue
my partner now.

372
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,750
I still can't let you...

373
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,541
I'm the one that
got her into this...

374
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,541
So I'm goin'.

375
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,416
Come on, let me
have my moment.

376
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,958
I'm sorry, I just can't.

377
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,041
Let me!

378
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:16,500
No way.

379
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,166
Yes way!

380
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,416
Nadie!

381
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,958
[MARGARITA] Why don't
you both go rescue her?

382
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,416
[NADIE and ANTONIO gasp]

383
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,000
I would think... it might
work better that way.

384
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,708
[EYE-PATCH] Damn it all...!

385
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,833
I'm done waitin'!

386
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:32,375
[EYE-PATCH] C'mere!

387
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,416
[ELLIS gasps]

388
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,500
I'll try'n provoke
him somehow...

389
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,250
And when he lowers his guard...

390
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,750
Leave it to me.

391
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,291
[ANTONIO] All right here I am!

392
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:50,333
Just like you told me!
Now let Margarita go!

393
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,000
Huh?

394
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,125
Ellis?!

395
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,208
What happened to him?

396
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,208
Oh, he's inside.

397
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,250
[EYE-PATCH groans]

398
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,333
I think they're drunk.

399
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:08,958
[ANTONIO] Uh--

400
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,500
I swear, girl...

401
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,958
[MARGARITA] Ellis!

402
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,250
I'm okay.

403
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,083
Never seen maracas
used as weapons.

404
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,958
Only for her, trust me.

405
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,125
[NADIE gasps]

406
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,541
Is somethin' wrong?

407
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,083
Nadie?

408
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,041
[NADIE sighs]

409
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,916
Let's get him outta here...

410
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's best if we keep
Ellis from seein' him.

411
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,500
Huh?

412
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,291
[ANTONIO gasps]

413
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,875
[NADIE] So long.

414
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,875
Sorry for all the
trouble I caused ya.

415
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:10,208
Forget it, we're
used to trouble.

416
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,791
Take these for the road.

417
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,000
[ELLIS singing]
Taco, taco, taco!

418
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,083
Su-uper tasty!

419
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,583
[NADIE] Thank you...

420
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:19,541
Well...

421
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:23,833
Be careful, huh?

422
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,166
Oh... that's right...

423
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,541
Hey, Margarita, real quick...

424
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,958
Before we head out, could
you tell me one last thing?

425
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,833
Oh, yeah...
Of course.

426
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,083
[NADIE] What made you
fall in love with Antonio?

427
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,750
[MARGARITA and ANTONIO]
Huh?

428
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,375
[MARGARITA laughs]

429
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:42,083
[engine starts]

430
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,250
[ELLIS] Take care...!

431
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,583
[MARGARITA and
ANTONIO chuckle]

432
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:50,041
[ELLIS] Bye-bye!

433
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,500
[MARGARITA] He reminds me of
a puppy I had a long time ago.

434
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,750
That rules!

435
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,833
[NADIE laughs]

436
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,416
Woof, woof, woof, woof!

437
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,500
[BLUE-EYES] Project Leviathan...

438
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:23,291
It surpasses anything
I had ever imagined...

439
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:27,208
If this project were to
succeed, the world would...

440
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:37,250
[ROSENBERG] You look
more gorgeous...

441
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,750
without glasses.
