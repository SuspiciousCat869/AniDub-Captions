Are you telling me he's actually
chasing after the two of you?

110
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:34,583
Yeah, we crossed his path
right after I ran out of ammo...

111

And he's been doggin'
us ever since.

You're welcome to
hang out here for awhile.

114

[IRIS] Years ago,
when the mine was active,

115
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,166
I'd guess there were probably
fifty people living down here...

But nowadays,
it's just little old me.

Here you go.

118
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,250
Okay, I get that
you live down here,

119
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,833
since you've made a nice
home for yourself...

120
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,208
And I get that you're
apparently digging for silver,

121
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,041
or you wouldn't be
here to begin with...

122
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,583
Well, I get that you two
are probably not down here

123
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:15,166
to try and steal things...
so that's a relief.

124
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,500
That's nice...

125
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,958
But here's what
I don't get.

126
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:21,208
If nobody else is here,
isn't all the silver gone?

127
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,250
That is why the mine
was closed down, right?

128
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,000
[IRIS] Yeah, that's
what I've been told.

129

Oh, I'm sorry.

00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,916
I should have
explained it better...

132
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,500
What I'm looking for
isn't just silver ore...

133
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,833
It's an artifact called
La Cruz de Plata.

134
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:39,958
La Cruz... de Plata?

135
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,708
This is a map my
father left for me.

136
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:02,833
[IRIS] I guess this all started

137
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,208
right as I was about
to graduate college...

138
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,500
One day, one of my
professors asked...

139
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,958
"What are your plans
after graduation?"

140
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,791
And to be perfectly honest...

141
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,416
I was always so
focused on school,

142
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,791
I never even thought
about the future.

143
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,375
Up to that point, every time
I graduated from one school,

144
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,041
I'd just move on to
the next level, y'know?

145
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,541
What a great story.

146
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,625
Most of my classmates were
planning to get corporate jobs,

147
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,333
but... I wasn't sure
that was right for me...

148
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:31,000
I wanted to find something
I could pour myself into,

149
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,541
on my own terms.

150
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,125
Which brings us back
to this map...

151
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,041
My father gave it
to me and said...

152
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,541
"If that's what you want,

153
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,500
why don't you try searching
for the Silver Cross?"

154
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,000
And that's how you
ended up down here.

155
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:44,958
[IRIS] Exactly.

156
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,458
That's incredible!

157
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,791
Isn't it...?

158
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:51,291
I feel like the luckiest
woman alive on this quest.

159
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,208
[IRIS] Are you two really
willing to give me a hand?

160
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,708
Sure, enough to repay
you for the gas and water.

161
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,041
Yeah, and the tea.

162
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:03,250
It kinda goes against my
nature to accept charity.

163
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,583
Besides...

164
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,708
I'm hopin' ta kill
some time down here...

165
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,583
until that guy
loses our scent.

166
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,208
[gunshot]

167
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,000
[bullet shells clatter]

168
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,916
[IRIS] The Silver Cross was
hidden within this mountain

169
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,666
approximately four
hundred years ago...

170
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,583
In the years since then, a slew
of mining operations have dug

171
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,250
numerous tunnels
throughout here.

172
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,500
Problem is,
the map's really old,

173
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,708
and most of the tunnels
aren't even on it.

174
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,541
This place is a maze.

175
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,958
Yes, I'm sorry.

176
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:03,208
Yeah, no, it's nothing
you gotta apologize for...

177
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:07,208
So anyway, you actually
dig in that outfit?

178
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,958
Yeah... Sorry, I do.

179
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,666
My sister told me since
I'm working for myself,

180
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,000
I should wear what
I'm accustomed to.

181
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,166
And since this is what
I'm most accustomed to,

182
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,375
this is how I dress.

183
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,291
I have lots more like this one!

184
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,458
Heh. Okay then.

185
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,000
[sounds of axes
hitting rocks]

186
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,916
[NADIE] Day in... day out...

187
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,375
same thing over and over...

188
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,750
Don't you get sick of it?

189
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,083
[IRIS] Huh?

190
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,791
I mean, all you do every
single day is dig holes...

191
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,458
You never
get bored?

192
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:38,875
[IRIS] Well back in school,

193
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,000
I didn't do anything but
go to lectures every day,

194
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,333
and I never thought
that was boring.

195
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,000
I enjoyed the routine.

196
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,291
You're something
else, Iris.

197
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,958
[NADIE sighs]

198
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,666
I say we've
earned a break...

199
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,375
I'll be right back
with some tea.

200
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,750
Is she that earnest...

201
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,041
or just nuts?

202
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
[NADIE chuckles]

203
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,000
The same but different...

204
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,916
And not only their names...

205
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,625
What the--?

206
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:23,791
It collapsed.

207
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,083
[NADIE gasps]

208
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,666
[NADIE] Iris!

209
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,125
[NADIE] You okay?!

210
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,333
[IRIS gasps]

211
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,666
Nadie! I'm so sorry;
did I make you worry?!

212
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,208
No time for your
stupid apologies--move!

213
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:43,458
[rumbling and crashing noises]

214
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,333
[IRIS] Why?

215
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,750
In all this time...

216
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:52,083
I've never once seen
a tunnel collapse.

217
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,000
It's collapsing
all over.

218
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,833
Is it?

219
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,083
Explosions.

220
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,541
Ah! That's not good.

221
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,583
Blowin' stuff up
in a tunnel...

222
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,541
What a maroon.

223
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,125
Sorry... We got
you involved...

224
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:19,208
Looks like he's tryin'
to bury us alive...

225
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,875
Is there some other way
to sneak out of here?

226
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,875
[IRIS sighs]

227
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:25,916
Iris?

228
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,291
That's right...

229
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,875
I still need to find
La Cruz de Plata.

230
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,416
Uh--

231
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,958
[NADIE] You think now's
the best time for that?

232
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,958
Yes, but... but I...

233
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:45,458
My father told me to find the
Silver Cross no matter what...

234
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:48,125
I should be a good girl
and do what he said.

235
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,833
[NADIE] Uh...

236
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,833
Calm down...

237
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,458
Do you know what's going on?

238
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:59,291
Yes I do...
I am calm, and I will dig.

239
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,708
"And I will dig"?

240
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,791
Do you not have
a mind of your own?

241
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,625
[IRIS grunts]

242
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,625
You are a human being...

243
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,125
And not your father's
robot, right...?

244
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,125
Now, why don't you think
for yourself for once

245
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,541
and do the right thing here?

246
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,083
This way.

247
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,833
Come on, Iris, let's go...

248
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,166
It's fine...

249
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,666
Just do as I say until
we get out of here

250
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,791
and we'll be all right.

251
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,375
Okay?

252
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,250
Okay... Sorry.

253
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,958
[ELLIS] Right here.

254
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,833
I think I know
where we are...

255
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,250
If I remember correctly,

256
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:04,125
the tunnels around here
run very close together.

257
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,750
So if we start diggin'
here, we're golden?

258
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,458
I think.

259
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,125
[NADIE] You gonna help or what?

260
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:14,333
[IRIS] Ah! Yeah!
Uh... Sorry!

261
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:18,208
[ALL THREE grunt]

262
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:32,000
Nice, we made it through.

263
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,708
Which way?

264
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,750
That way.

265
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,083
Iris... Still have
that gun on ya?

266
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,791
Uh... yeah.

267
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,250
[NADIE] Give it to me,
just in case.

268
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,458
Uh... But my older
brother gave it to me,

269
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,791
and he said I should keep it
on my person at all times,

270
00:16:58,875 --> 00:16:59,750
no matter what.

271
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,458
Stop arguing with me.

272
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:04,875

282
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,000
[NADIE] Uh...?

[IRIS screams]

284
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,666
[NADIE] Ellis,
what's the map say?

285
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,125
[ELLIS] The exit is three
more centimeters ahead.

286
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,041
[NADIE] That is so you.

287
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,458
Oh, no, this is it...!

288
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,208
I should've listened
to my father.

289
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,958
Kept my head down and just
searched for the Silver Cross.

290
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,208
[NADIE] Yeah, no...

291
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,041

00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,500
Take this!

297
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,250
Is that it?

298
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,500
Alright!

it actually exists...!

the map was a fake!

Check it out!

been lookin' for...!

309
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,500
[NADIE] What,
you're not happy...?

310
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:45,083
Come on Iris--times like this,
you should be bursting with joy!

311
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:48,000
Is that okay...?
Being happy?

312
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,583
Uh... Well, yeah...

313
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,208
Can't you even have
a simple emotion

314
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,875
without someone's permission?

316

00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,000

just found the treasure!

gonna do now?

324
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,958
Guess you won't be
able to decide...

325
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,875
till someone tells you.

326
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,875
[IRIS] I have decided...

327
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,875
...to stay here.

328
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,083
It was magnificent...

329
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,416
People have always
been fascinated,

330
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,250
even obsessed, with silver...

331
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,375
And for the first time,
I finally understand why.

332
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,041
Iris.

333
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,833
I want to stay...

334
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:22,333
I know I can excavate
that cross one more time.

335
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,916
So you're still listening
to what your father said.

336
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,416
My father has nothing
to do with it...

337
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,416
I'm making this choice.

338
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,916
All I want is to hold that cross
in my hands once before I die...

339
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,166
And when I succeed...

340
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,958
I'm gonna celebrate this time.

341
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,958
[NADIE] Heh.

342
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,083
Sounds good...

343
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,083
I wish ya luck, Iris.

344
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,916
Thanks.

345
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,083
[ELLIS] Does it
make you happy...

346
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,708
to find something you want?

347
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:00,541
Sure, if it's something
you really desire.

348
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,541
[ELLIS] I see.

349
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:14,958
[IRIS] Okay.

350
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,375
First, I need to
change my clothes.

351
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,750
Can't believe it's
really in there.

352
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:29,083
I wonder... 
Where to start...

353
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,791
[BLUE-EYES] Reports of
a giant silver cross

354
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:37,208
being excavated in the region...

355
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:39,875
...have yet to surface.
