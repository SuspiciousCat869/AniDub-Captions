00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,875
Through Blue-Eyes'
tireless efforts...

4
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:01,083
we now know the full extent
of Douglas Rosenberg's

00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:05,333
clandestine project,
code named Leviathan.

6
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:14,375
It is dangerous to let
Ellis remain at large...

7
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,750
We should dispose
of her immediately.

8
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,083
Correct...

9
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,041
but let us not forget that
they are working under

10
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:23,166
the assumption that we have
already have this information...

11
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,458
If we act too hastily
in this matter,

12
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:28,916
they could use that
to their advantage.

13
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,250
[EXTREMIST REP] The Council
is leaning towards a decision

14
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:34,000
that would be disastrous for us.

15
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:38,000
[EXTREMIST SUBORDINATE] So they
intend to allow Ellis to live?

16
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,500
[EXTREMIST REP] She was
created by the hands of man.

17
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:44,083
If this creature born out of
nothing is allowed to thrive,

18
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,625
she will sow the seeds
of our destruction.

19
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,833
[EXTREMIST SUBORDINATE] I agree.

20
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,125
Worse case
scenario...

21
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,625
we may ignore the
Council's decision outright

22
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:55,208
and invoke the Laws
of the Night.

What is going on?

34
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,333
[NADIE] I was gonna ask you...

I don't need you

to the news of

00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,375
They have since taken action.

catalogued on my computer here.

Why don't I just
fire it up for ya.

Ah, thanks.

00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,750

[ORTEGA] That there's
a government issue Colt

98
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,541
"M Nineteen-Eleven A-One."

99
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,625
Takes forty-five caliber
rounds, seven to a clip.

100
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:29,166
Adopted in 1911, it's been
the Standard-Issue sidearm

101
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,875
for the US Army for
almost a century now.

102
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:35,750
It's a highly accurate and
dependable piece of weaponry.

103
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,000
European "nine millimeters"
pack more rounds,

104
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,958
so they're the gun
of choice these days.

105
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,875
But with all the terrorist
attacks lately,

106
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,625
the Colt's gained
renewed respect

107
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,583
for its close range
stopping power. Heh.

108

I'm sorry...

109

I guess this must be pretty
boring for a girl, huh...?

110
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:55,458
Anyway... The Colt uses
Browning's short-recoil action.

111
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,916
Nadie has one.

of the Council's

Unfortunately it is

[BLUE-EYES] You don't mean...

141
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,583
they're using that
to shield themselves?

...that is our greatest

What does that mean?

162
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,458
[BLUE-EYES] It means for
the next several hours,

you'll be plagued by

tell you one thing...

166
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,958

[ROSENBERG] Yes,
that is a problem...

Well, it is certainly provided
for in the contract but...

181
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,125
this is quite urgent...

00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,208
Can't something be done?

I've finally caught up, Ellis.

[ORTEGA] Oh!

You got a map?

205
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,166
[ORTEGA] I got a
killer setup in here.

206
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,250
There's a satellite
uplink to the internet

[ORTEGA] Huh?

209
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,416
It didn't work?

Oh, my God!

We're screwed...!
What the frak do I do...?

And that's a problem?

[ORTEGA] Um... Nuh-uh.

00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,958
Now that's a problem.

So that's it then...

We're all gonna die.

219

Oh I dunno, for as much as we've
been gettin' shot up tonight...

220

Nothin's really gotten
through the armor so far...

00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,333

00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,583
It's a beast.

[ORTEGA] Huh?

00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,583
And it's reinforced
in front...

225
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:27,541
You didn't mod this puppy
all by yourself, did you?

226
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,958
Sure did...

227
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:32,083
Basically transformed a normal
RV into an armored car.

Wow, that's incredible.

Incredible.

In this thing,
we'll be fine.

00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,291
We'll be fine.

Ha! You really think so?

234
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:59,416
If we go right we'll end up
in a town that was quarantined

235
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,250
a few years ago because
of some weird epidemic.

236
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,250
Then I suppose we
better go left...

00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,833
though it'll prob'ly
mean another ambush.

Okay...

until dawn, huh...?

Well let's try
outsmarting them...

Why don't we take the route
that'll buy us some extra time.

standing there?!
