Hey, what's with the cold
shoulder treatment...?

31
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,333
It was an accident...

00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,458
the only reason I pulled
my piece on that guy

33
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,041
was cuz I thought
he was after you.

34
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,833
But I knew he didn't
have a gun on him...

35
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,541
I knew it right away.

Then you should've
said something.

00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:57,041
Well then...
You leave me no choice.

171
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,875
Honest to God truth is...

172
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,541
I'm a spirit.

173
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,625
[BLUE-EYES gasps]

174
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,208
That's ridiculous.

[OLD MAN chuckles]

176
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,458
When you feel like having
some tea, come on inside...

177
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,083
You're more than welcome here.

178
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,083
[door closes]

179
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,750
I need to get a
background check.

[bullet shells clatter]

182
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,833
I heard the stories about
Kokopelli from my mom

183
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,875
when I was
a little kid.

184
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,125
I always wanted
to meet him...

185
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:21,125
so I became obsessed
with practicing the flute.

186
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,291
I thought if I learned
how to play well...

187
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:26,000
he would visit me one day.

188
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:30,583
But... I never did
get very good at it.

189
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,500
Well, children
are innocent...

190
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,875
It's very easy to
hurt their feelings...

191
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:40,291
There are things adults can
rationalize matter-of-factly...

192
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:43,000
But children don't
have that capacity.

193
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,791
In many ways, children
see the world around them

194
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,916
in black and white,
or in other words...

195
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,291
In love... and hate.

196
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:02,000
Who'da thunk you'd ever
teach me somethin'?

You're tellin' me...

Y'get it from Lirio?

00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,041
[RICARDO] No...

200
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,833
Long before her.

201
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,125
[RICARDO] Something
from so long ago...

202
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,458
I just wish I could forget...

203
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,791
but I never will.

[NADIE] Nah, I'm good.

208
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,208
[RICARDO] All right.

209
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,333
[NADIE] Ricardo.

210
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,541
[RICARDO] Hm.

211
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,458
Thank you.

212
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,958
[RICARDO] You'll catch
your death out here.

[NADIE chuckles]

[NADIE] Yeah, it is
gettin' cold out.

215
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,916
Blue-Eyes, what--?

216
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,750
[BLUE-EYES] The man
inside's an imposter.

217
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,041
[NADIE] Huh?

218
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,708
[BLUE-EYES] I ran
a background check.

219
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:18,208
Howard Heisman, the author,
died over three years ago.

220
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,833
[OLD MAN] Ellis.

221
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,333
What's that?

222
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,333
I looked in a mirror.

223
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,833
A mirror?

224
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,000
And when I did...

225
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,916
I didn't...
like what I saw.

226
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,583
[OLD MAN] Are you sad?

227
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,041
Yeah.

228
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,166
I see...

229
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,750
Why don't you come
with me for a second.

230
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,291
Then... who is this guy?

231
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,750
[BLUE-EYES]
It's anyone's guess...

232
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,666
Probably a washed up con man...

233
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,791
or maybe...

234
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,750
A bounty hunter.

235
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,875
That is a
possibility.

236
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,291

You're not taking her.

250
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,625
[BLUE-EYES] Ellis is missing
part of her memory...

00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:58,500
the part from a very crucial
period in her life.

When you get to
your destination...

253
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,791
do you really think Ellis
will find happiness?

255
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,166
Hand Ellis over to us...

to happiness she'll ever find...

What this woman is saying
is utter nonsense...

268
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:46,291
Arriving at Wiñay Marka
is exactly what's needed...

00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:49,083
to bring happiness
to my dear Ellis.

270
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,958
[NADIE] So what's there?

00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,833
[BLUE-EYES]
Think about this Nadie...

272
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,583
If L.A. thinks going
there is a good idea...

273
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:58,458
Then no happiness
awaits Ellis...

00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,583
Only his sinister designs.

[L.A.] Sinister designs, huh?

276
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,250
Is it not true?

277
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,833
[L.A. laughs]

278
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:10,291
[L.A.] I believe the same
could be said of you.

279
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,666
[BLUE-EYES] All I am doing
is following orders.

280
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,333

282
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,166
What's there, damnit...?

283
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,708
Tell me.

284
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:25,208
Trust me, once you find out
you'll wish you never asked...

285
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,375
It will only bring
you suffering.

[NADIE gasps]

287
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,333
Well that much we
can agree upon...

288
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:35,333
The only thing you need to do
is safely deliver Ellis to me.

289
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,833
[BLUE-EYES] No.
I won't allow it.

290
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,083
You really mean that?

00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,208
Yes, I do.

It's glowing.

How do you feel... Ellis?

A bit different
than before...

When it was glowing the other
day my chest felt tight...

It really
hurt a lot.

It doesn't.

I don't really have any

00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,291
[ELLIS] Nadie. You know what?

335
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,708
[NADIE] Hm?

336
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,041
[ELLIS] I'm glad.

337
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,666
[NADIE] For what?

338
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,291
[ELLIS] You and I are friends...

339
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,541
aren't we?

340
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:13,666
[NADIE] Silly...

341
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,166
Of course we are.

342
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,041
[ELLIS] Let's go together...

343
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,166
to Wiñay Marka.

344
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:21,833
[NADIE sighs]

345
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,541
[NADIE] I'm in.

346
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:26,041
[NADIE] I don't know
what awaits us there...

347
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,500
but... if Ellis
wants to go...

348
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,375
we'll go.

349
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,291
No matter what we find...

350
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,375
I will stand by her side...

351
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,958
and protect her...

352
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,625
'til the end.

353
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,541
[MELISSA] Doug.

354
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,375
[ROSENBERG] Hmm?

355
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,916
[ROSENBERG] Hello Melissa.

356
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,250
Hello.

357
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,958
Let's head into town
and do some shopping.

358
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,875
That sounds great.

359
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,250
[ROSENBERG sighs]

360
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,416
What a gorgeous day.

361
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,291
So... We're
goin' on ahead.

362
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,250
Huh...? Already?

363
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:19,375
[LIRIO giggles]

364
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,041
Bye bye, bonita!

365
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,041
You find Gramps?

366
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,708
No, huh-uh.

367
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,875
Well shoot...

368
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:33,333
Wonder where he could've gone
so early in the morning...

369
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,458
I wanted to say goodbye.

370
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,500
He probably went home...

371
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:39,708
Ready?

372
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,750
What's that mean...?

373
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,250
Whatever...

374
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,750
We can try droppin'
by on the way back.

375
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:47,541
[NADIE] See ya!

376
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,583
[ELLIS] Bye bye, old guy!

377
00:21:56,708 --> 00:22:00,750
[L.A.] Oof.

378
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,125
Ellis!

379
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:06,541
[L.A.] Ellis...
Where are you?

380
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,458
[group gasps]

381
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,958
What does this mean?

382
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,833
[BLUE-EYES] I am not
a believer in ghosts...

383
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,666
However... It is certain

384
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,833
there are truths stranger
than fiction out there...

385
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:37,041
apparently.
