by placing a bounty
on her head...

30
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,833
it was a simple deduction that
the descendants of the witches

would assign her an escort...

[BLUE-EYES] "Maxwell's
Demon" was a theory

115
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,583
proposed during the
nineteenth century.

116
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:27,250
Rosenberg's father,
one of its key researchers,

117
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,250
put considerable effort
into making it a reality...

118
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,041
which led him to
the "witches' powers."

119
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:36,000
What's Maxwell's demon?

120
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,208
[BLUE-EYES] You don't know?

121
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,041
[NADIE] Yeah, no.

122
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,583
It's a theoretical model
created in an attempt

123
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,375
to halt the
increase of entropy,

124
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,958
breaking the Second Law
of Thermodynamics...

125
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,708
Entropy refers to the movement
of molecules exciting

126
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:52,250
surrounding molecules, causing
them to begin moving as well.

127
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,375
It assumes the existence
of an entity, or "demon,"

128
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,666
capable of preventing the
natural movement of molecules,

129
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,875
an exchange of energy
which completely negates

130
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,750
Newton's Second Law.

131
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,500
Should I continue?

132
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,958
[NADIE] Can you explain
it more simply?

133
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:11,083
[BLUE-EYES] There's a scientific
theory called Maxwell's Demon...

134
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:14,583
And if it were a reality...
whole bunches of power

135
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:18,250
could be produced with no
real limitations... Better?

139
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,541
To prove his hypothesis...

140
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,416
Rosenberg's father moved
his family from Berlin...

141
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,125
which was still behind the
Iron Curtain at the time...

142
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,916
and sought political
asylum overseas.

143
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,083
[BLUE-EYES] When the
U.S. Government obtained

144
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:42,666
samples of Witch DNA...
his research was approved

145
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,166
as an official defense
project... But soon afterward...

146
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,666
The elder Rosenberg was
cut from the team altogether.

147

and left him with nothing...

150
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:03,333
In despair,

[YOUNG ROSENBERG shudders]

153

to his death...

00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:24,916
and Rosenberg has
not forgotten that...

155
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,291
Surely he's plotting revenge.

156
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,291
And you think... he's
trying to use Ellis' power

157
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,458
to make that happen?

158
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,708
[BLUE-EYES] Most likely.

I'm lettin' him use
Ellis like that!

161
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,291
[ELLIS] I have to go.

162
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:43,666
Because he...
has the answer I need.

163
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,500
Ellis.

164
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,458
[ROSENBERG] I have to say,
it's a good look for you.

165
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,416
[ROSENBERG] Here...
I have a job.

166
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:23,000
[ROSENBERG] If you would...
dispose of this man for me.

167
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,916
[gunshot]

168
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,083
[bullet shells clatter]

169
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,583
Poor kid, she tuckered
out so early.

170
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,458
I'm getting sleepy too.

171
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,125
Guess you're
still a kid then.

172
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,958
'Kay, then I'm not tired.

173
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,500
[NADIE chuckles]

174
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,791
[BLUE-EYES] You sure
about this intel?

175
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,166
We just confirmed it.

176
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,708
L.A. is completely
under Rosenberg's control...

177
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,541
It would appear his
obsession with Ellis

178
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,958
has been wiped clean
from his memory.

179
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,875
He's an artificial life form...
Without a shred

180
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,000
of emotion left, he's become
a virtual killing machine.

181
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,958
He will do Rosenberg's
bidding, no questions asked.

182
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:13,291
Great, so now...
he's comin' after me, huh?

183
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,708
Do you have a plan?

184
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:18,375
[RICARDO] Yeah...
Look after Lirio for me.

185
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,041
[NADIE] Wait.
I'm coming with you.

186
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,250
[RICARDO] You'll be in the way.

187
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,208
Not listening.

188
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:29,166
[RICARDO] I'm the
one he's after.

189
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,125
That doesn't mean you have
to go in there all by yourself.

190
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,500
But if something were
to happen to you...

191
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,708
then who would
take care of Ellis?

192
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,208
Yeah, but...

193
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:43,500
letting you risk your life
without backup just seems...

194
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,291
[RICARDO] So pay me.

195
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,833
[NADIE] Huh?

196
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,458
Hire me and it
becomes a real job...

197
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:56,500
That way it's not for you...
it's for the reward.

198
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,458
Greedy much...?

199
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,416
[NADIE] Ooh, ouch!
This is all I got.

200
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,291
Keep the change, amigo.

201
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:25,250
You better come back...
Lirio will be waiting for you.

202
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,833
I know.

203
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:36,291
I'll be waiting... as well.

204
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,125
[L.A.] Hmm.

205
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,708
Ricardo.

206
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,000
[LIRIO gasps]

207
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,250
Out of ammo, huh?

208
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:25,083
That... is... mine.

209
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:31,041
Something... that's
precious... to me...

210
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,541
It's... disappearing.

211
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:43,541
No, wait... this is not it...
What's truly... precious is...

212
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,250
[L.A. gasps]

213
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,666
Wait, where am I...?

214
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,375
What am I doing out here in
the middle of the desert...?

215
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:23,791
I have to go...
I have to go to my Ellis.

216
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:27,708
Ellis... I'm coming
for you, Ellis.

217
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,708
[gunshot]

218
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,833
[L.A.] Mm?

219
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:48,916
You are...?

220
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,791
I'm not letting you
anywhere near her.

221
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:55,791
Anyone who gets
in my way, sir...

222
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:56,791
[L.A. giggles]

223
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,333
...will die.

224
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,458
 As it should be.

225
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,208
When we find her...
we'll call you.

226
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,458
I should... go with you.

227
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:10,083
No, I think you two
should stay here.

228
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,708
[L.A. grunts intensely]

229
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,750
Where are you...?!
Where the hell are you?!

230
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:22,791
[L.A. grunts intensely]

231
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,958
[L.A. pants]

232
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:28,875
[L.A.] Where are you...
Tell me where you are...!

233
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,333
Show yourself!

234
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:41,125
[L.A. grunts intensely]

235
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,916
[RICARDO] Nadie.

236
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,291
[L.A.] Where are you?
Where are you?!

237
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,833
[L.A.] Huh?

238
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,375
[L.A.] There you are!!

239
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:03,250
I'll buy ya a drink
in hell... amigo.

240
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:28,875
Ellis... You're here...
I'm so glad you came for me...

241
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,041
[L.A. grunts weakly]

242
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:41,916
Now I know why... I fell...
in love with you, Ellis...

243
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,625
I know.

244
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:51,125
It wasn't the man who gave
me the... capacity to feel...

245
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,125
It was you.

246
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:04,458
My dear... Ellis...

247
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:09,625
Ellis... To me... you are...

248
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,666
...everything.

249
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:23,666
Ahh... I'm starting
to feel... sleepy...

250
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:29,166
Ellis... Smile for me
one last time...

251
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:34,125
I want it to be the last
thing that... I see.

252
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:44,583
You're so wonderful...
my... Ellis.

253
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,250
Lirio.

254
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:20,291
Thank God... So they're
both doing all right?

255
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:24,208
[BLUE-EYES] Yes...
The job is finished.

256
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:27,000
So then... L.A. is...?

257
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,583
[BLUE-EYES] Dead.

258
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,833
Um... Blue-Eyes...?

259
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:38,250
Why do you suppose Lirio ran off
to go looking for Ricardo...?

260
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:41,958
She always used to
wait so patiently.

261
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:45,916
Perhaps... Lirio's no
different from me.

262
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,708
Maybe as she watched
over you two...

263
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:56,083
something...
changed inside of her.

264
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:59,083
We'll head back right away.
Wait until we--

265
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,041
Well, this journey began
with just the two of us...

266
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:08,875
What do you say we go the rest
of the way without them...?

267
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,416
You in?

268
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,041
Yessir... Partner.

269
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,458
[NADIE] Hm.

270
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:18,416
All right... Let's move.
