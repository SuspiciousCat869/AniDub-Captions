There once was a physicist,

2
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,000
who published a new theory...

3
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,333
which shattered all
previously established

4
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:10,791
notions of thermodynamics.

5
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:13,583
Assuming the existence
of an "invisible entity"

6
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,000
that observes the movement
of molecules...

7
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:19,916
he concluded that it was
possible to control molecules...

8
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,291
In other words, that entropy
could be decreased.

9
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,875
The physicist called the entity

10
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,166
that controlled
molecules a demon...

11
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,958
And the resulting theory,
"Maxwell's demon,"

12
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,625
was named after him.

00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:43,125
it was concluded that
Maxwell's demon was,

18
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,791
in all practicality,
impossible...

19

[BLUE-EYES] She's made contact.

169
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,166
[OFFICE chattering]

170
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,458
[gunshot]

171
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,958
[bullet shells clatter]

172
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,250
[NADIE] Uhh...

173
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,500
[NADIE] Never had my fortune
told with corn before.

174
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:11,916
Is it accurate?

175
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,541
[SALMA] In the old days,
they used to call me a witch.

176
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:15,625
[NADIE] Witch?

177
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,291
[SALMA] Hold out your hands.

178
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,375
[NADIE] Oh... okay.

179
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:25,666
Now spread them onto
the ground in a line.

180
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,041
Sure...

181
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,125
So, am I
gonna be rich?

182
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,875
No, huh...?

183
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,750
Well that
kinda blows...

184
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,666
And I thought Ellis
was a strange girl...

185
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:51,416
But like her, your fortune
is most unusual, as well.

186
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,541
Huh?

187
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,041
[SALMA] I see a life
of ups and downs.

188
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,291
Doubt you need the
corn to see that.

189
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:02,208
In your future... Many
difficult challenges lie ahead.

190
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,625
[NADIE] What?!
That's not what I wanna hear!

191
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,833
I just wanna find happiness!

192
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,041
It's not as though
everything that happens

193
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,625
will lead to misfortune...

194
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,375
The key is in how you handle it.

195
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,250
So just make
everything happy...

196
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,250
You are a witch, aren'tcha...?

197
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,333
Can'tcha use your
magic and go...

198
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,708
"Pres-to?!" or "Sha-zam?!"...?

199
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:23,750
[SALMA laughs]

200
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,125
Wasn't really goin'
for laughs...

201
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:31,416
I think you may be the one
I can entrust her to... Ellis.

202
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,083
[NADIE] Huh?

203
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,416
She's a good kid, that one...

204
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,125
Born under a slightly odd
star I'd say, but still...

205
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,208
Good kid.

206
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:00,208
[SALMA grunts]

207
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,208
[PASSERBY] Sorry!

208
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,541
She seems to
want to go south.

209
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,375
Go south...?
South to where?

210
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,833
Ah...

211
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,000
Truth is she doesn't even
really seem to know herself.

212
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,166
[NADIE] Mm.

213
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,875
Her fate lies
elsewhere...

214
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,666
But she couldn't abandon
this poor old bag of bones.

215
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:30,083
[birds squawk]

216
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,541
[NADIE] Hm?

217
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,458
Already?

218
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,541
[NADIE] Yeah.

219
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,541
She won't be coming
back, will she?

220
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,208
She's being hunted...

221
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,500
Protect her for me.

222
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,208
[NADIE sighs]

223
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,666
[SALMA] I'm counting on you.

224
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,750
Yeah...

225
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:03,916
[gasps]

226
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,166
[NADIE] Shh!

227
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,875
[ELLIS] Huh?

228
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,500
[whispering] Let's go.

229
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,625
[TRANSVESTITE A] Oh!

230
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,833
No need to get
rough, officer!

231
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,833
[TRANSVESTITE B] Stop!
We haven't done anything

232
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,666
to deserve this
kind of treatment!

233
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,708
[POLICÍA A] Shut up...!

234
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:23,958
[POLICÍA B] You too, princess!

235
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,041
[POLICÍA A]
C'mon. Spread your legs!

236
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,416
Hey... hey... looking
good down there.

237
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,041
Now just get
yourselves arrested.

238
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,375
[NADIE] Hm?

239
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,083
What, this?

240
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,250
Just a scratch...
It's already closing up.

241
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,041
[ELLIS] Uh-huh...

242
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,666
[NADIE] Ahh!

243
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,083
Big liar.

244
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,208
[NADIE grunts]

245
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,583
It opened back up
'cause you poked it!

246
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,708
Um... Thank you.

247
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,416
[ELLIS] Is Gran'ma... okay?

248
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,958
She will be, as long
as you don't go back.

249
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,166
But if I do go back there,
she'll be killed...

250
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,458
[NADIE] Pretty much.

251
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:06,750
[ELLIS] Then... I won't go back.

252
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,791
[NADIE] Hey, tell ya what,
I'll swing by there later

253
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,041
and pick up your things for you.

254
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,791
So everybody's
out to get me...

255
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,583
Because I'm a killer.

256
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:39,625
[ELLIS gasps]

257
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,291
So what happened...?

258
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,375
It's cool, you don't
have to say...

259
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,708
I don't know.

260
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,458
What?

261
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:58,708
I don't...
remember it.

262
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,041
I see...

263
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,750
Oh! That's right...

264
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,583
Never introduced myself...

265
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:08,041
My name's Nadie.
Pleasure to meet you.

266
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,083
Okay, not so much...

Can't be...

270
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,375
Gran'ma, no...!

271
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,083
Wait! Ellis...!

272
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,375
Come back! It's a trap!

273
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,416
[NADIE] Yeah, no.

274

[ELLIS gasps]

275
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,500
Hey, missy...
Welcome home...

276
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,666
Wasn't that a fun sound...?

277
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,208
Ka-boom!

278
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,083
Move outta my way.

279
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,666
[CARLOS] Oh I think it's
best if you don't look.

[FERNANDO] You're comin'
with us... So do as we say.

283
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,791

[CARLOS] Ah!

00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:04,875
Drop your gun... Y'know,
if you want to live.

00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,583
I'll shoot you for real.

words, say 'em.

Hang on, that's my line!

294

Ellis, get
outta here...

What are you waiting for?
Get a move on...!

Go now!

[CARLOS]
Oh, son of a bitch! Ah!

301
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,458
Someone call a doctor.

302
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:57,125
[CARLOS] Damn it...!
Oh crap, my eyes! Why?!

[ELLIS] Yes... Ellis.

I'm here Gran'ma...

You... You came back to me...
Grácias a los Dioses!

308
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,166
This is my fault.

No Ellis...
you're wrong...

310
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,041
You mustn't blame
yourself for this...

311
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,541
It isn't your fault...

[ELLIS] Gran'ma...

313
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,791
[SALMA] It could
never be your fault...

you through what is to come.

What?

316
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,750
[SALMA] You're going
south... aren't you?

318
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,500
[ELLIS] Huh?

319
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,291
It means "place of eternity."

320
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:00,625
Place of...?

321
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,500

[bells ring]

324
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,541
[NADIE] Ellis? Time to go.

325
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,041
[NADIE] There's more
bounty hunters coming.

326
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,916
[ELLIS] You're one,
too, aren't you?

327
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,208
Ellis, wait--

328
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,458
[ELLIS] Don't follow me.

me... Just get killed.

Ellis...

00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,708
You can tell me not to
follow you all you want

332
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,416
but it ain't gonna happen.

333
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,708
You care about
the money that bad?

334
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,375
Oh, I want the money...

335
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,208
But I made your
gran'ma... a promise.

336
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,375
[ELLIS] Huh?

337
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:16,958
Y'know, lookin' after
some little girl

338
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,208
you might'a heard of.

339
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,625
[doors open]

340
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,041
[TRANSVESTITE A]
She should be in here!

341
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,833
[TRANSVESTITE B] Damn it
little girl! Where are you?!

342
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,750
[engine revs]

343
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,708
Cool... So you ready
to hit the road?

344
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,416
[ELLIS] Huh?

345
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,625
You're goin'...
south, right...?

346
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,541
I'll keep you company.

347
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,166
[ELLIS] Uhh... Huh?

348
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,875
But then... once you've
done what you need to do,

349
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:45,833
you're comin' with me... Okay?

350
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,416
[TRANSVESTITE A] Wha--? Hey!

351
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,208
[TRANSVESTITE B]
That's our jeep!

352
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,208
[TRANSVESTITE A]
Come back here with that!

353
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,291
[TRANSVESTITE B] Shit!

354
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,625
[NADIE laughs]

355
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:18,041
[SALMA] Wiñay Marka.

356
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,416
Wiñay... Marka.

357
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,875
[BLUE-EYES] And that's
how it happened...

358
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:40,666
How Ellis and Nadie met.
