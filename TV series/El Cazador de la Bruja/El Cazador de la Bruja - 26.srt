'Ey... You two look nice.

00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,333
[NINA] You sure
this is okay, Nadie?

5
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:12,416
[NADIE] Yeah, course it is...
Go see a movie...

6
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,583
Do some shopping...
Take your time and have fun.

7
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,750
Gracias.

8
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,833
I'm the one who should
be thanking you...

9
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:24,500
Roberto, Nina...
I'm just glad you hired us...

10
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,416
It really means a lot.

11
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,750
Hasta luego!

12
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,458
[PEDRO] Nadie.

13
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,125
Hey... Pedro.

14
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,166
They going out?

15
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,708
Yep, off to town
for a little date...

16
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:50,625
Well... Quite the antagonistic
stare you got there.

17
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:51,958
[JOAQUIN] You're a she-man.

18
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,583
What was that?

19
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:57,416
Joaquin...
Ah, jeez... Sorry.

20
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,916
It's no big deal...
I'm used to dealing

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,458
with twisted little kids...
That reminds me...

22
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,125
Would you mind watching
the store for a bit?

23
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:23,083
[NADIE] Got any
last words... say 'em.

24
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:26,875
A meat pie and
some cold lemonade.

25
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,833
Then go and make it
your damn self...

26
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,708
It's about time you did
some work around here.

27
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,625
Yessir!

28
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,500
The sky...

29
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,708
It's so high.

30
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,250
[NADIE] Sure is.

31
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,000
I can't reach it.

32
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,375
It'd be freaky if you could.

33
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,625
[PEDRO]
Nadie... is this it?

34
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:05,458
[NADIE] That's the one...
Thanks a bunch, Pedro.

35
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,750
She-man.

36
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,291
[NADIE] Heh...

37
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,541
You brought that for us...?
Aw, thank you, Joaquin.

[JOAQUIN giggles]

39
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,000
[NADIE] Sure, he's
sweet with you...

40
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,000
[ELLIS] Doesn't he
remind you of Lirio?

41
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,291
[NADIE] Yeah, no,
not seein' it.

42
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,541
[JOAQUIN]
You she-man.

43
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,833
[NADIE] Say it again,
I'll shoot you.

44
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,000
[NADIE] So Pedro...

45
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,500
You ever gonna
get married again?

46
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,791
[PEDRO] What?

47
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,375
[NADIE] Don't get me wrong,
I think it's great

48
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,666
you're still committed
to your late wife...

49
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,666
But don't you think,
for Joaquin's sake,

50
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,000
it'd be better if
you found someone?

51
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:56,750
Yeah, maybe...
Guess you've got a point.

52
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,541
[NADIE] Hey, Ellis, maybe
you should marry him.

53

[PEDRO gasps]

54
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,291
I'm pretty sure
Joaquin would like it.

55
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,458
I'm fine with it
if you are, Nadie.

56
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,208
[PEDRO] Whoa, hold up a sec.

57
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,125
[NADIE] What?
She's too young?

58
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:15,458
No, that's not what I meant...
If you're serious... I mean...

59
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,166

60

What's your business here?
Y'passing through?

00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,041
What was that?

66

[PEDRO] Nadie.

67
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,708
[NADIE] Huh?

68
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,375
[PEDRO] If those guys show up
here again, give me a call.

69
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,458
Ooh, impressive!

70
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,250
[JOAQUIN] She-man.

71
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,791
[NADIE] Bang.

72
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,000
Thanks for dinner.

73
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,875
It was awesome.

74
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,500
So... I was thinking.

75
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:24,708
Next time we go out, you two
should come along with us...

76
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,416
They have an amusement park.

77
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,625
Cool... But really,
you should go alone...

78
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,291
Honest, we don't mind
looking after the store.

79
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,000
We'd have more fun
if you came too.

80
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,833
You girls would
have a blast...

81
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,083
Ellis, ever been to
an amusement park?

82
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,458

00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,541
Then you're in
for a surprise...

They have a gigantic
Ferris Wheel there...

85
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,458
Does next Sunday sound good?

86
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,458
Any time is fine with us.

87
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,375
Then it's settled.

88
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,916

Got no worries about tomorrow...

they call happiness.

93

All that...
seems so long ago...

94
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,875
What do you have
your gun out for?

95
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:46,791
Yeah... I, uh, didn't
want it to get rusty...

96
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,625
You said you wouldn't
take it out anymore.

97
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,625
[ELLIS] It's warm.

98
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,541
Hey, now...
Y'can't do that.

99
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:01,791
[ELLIS] Hm?

100
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:05,000
We agreed you wouldn't
use your powers anymore.

101
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,833
But no one's around to see.

102
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,708
Well, you still can't...

103
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:12,500
A female bounty hunter and a
girl with mysterious powers...?

104
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,166
If we were found out,
we'd have to leave again.

105
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,750
You think so?

106
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,125
[NADIE] People who
don't know any better

107
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,916
would look at us as
dangerous or creepy.

108
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,333
People think bounty
hunters are creepy?

109
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:26,791
Oy vey...
Yeah... No, I...

110
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,208
Let's just be careful, okay...?

111
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,916
I promise I won't take
out my gun again...

112
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,333
But you gotta promise
to lay off the powers.

113
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,958
Yessir.

114

Farewell... sweet prince.

117

I'll go take a shower too.

of this entire area.

the company a few months?

around thing really suits ya.

00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,958
Apparently she was
adamant that he teach her...

164
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:39,708
I guess, in her own way, she
just wants to help him out.

165
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:43,458
Well, they've been though
a lot... T'say the least.

166
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,625
[ELLIS] Nadie...

167
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,458
What's up?

168
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,291
Do you... wanna
travel again?

169
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,583
Jeez, what are you,
outta your gourd...?

170
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:59,166
Don't be ridiculous...
All that drama is behind us now,

171
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,083
and we're practically
living in paradise here.

172
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,625
Really?

173
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:07,458
Trust me, I've had my
fill of life on the road...

174
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:11,250
We have a home now...
You get me, don'tcha?

175
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:14,833
Yep... I love
living here too.

176
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:18,416
You see? You're just
being silly, Ellis.

177
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,458
Yeah...? Come in.

178
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,833
No way!

179
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,958
Hm.

180
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,875
[gunshot]

181
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,875
[bullet shells clatter]

182
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,791
Rosenberg!

183
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,041
Uh...?

184
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,791
--[NADIE] Huh?
--[ELLIS] Not quite.

185
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:47,833
This is my new assistant...
Let me introduce you...

186
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:51,666
My name's Steve Beckman...
Pleased to meet you.

187
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,541
[NADIE laughs weakly]

188
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,541
Did you pass out the fliers?

189
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,666
Sure did, ma'am...
I canvassed every corner.

190
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,500
[BLUE-EYES] Good...
Wait in the car for me.

191
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,000
I'll be there soon.

192
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,500
Right... Excuse me.

193
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,916
Whoa, spittin' image.

194
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,583
He's a good honest kid.

195
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,083
You're deranged.

196
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,625
If you say so.

197
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,041
Seems awful Freudian...

198
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,875
Sure you didn't have a secret
crush on Rosenberg...?

199
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,000
Just kiddin'.

200
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,000
Maybe.

201
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,166
Uh-- Huh?

202
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,583
Just kidding.

203
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,583
Yeah, you're killin'
me over here.

204
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:26,750
[knock on door]

205
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,583
[NADIE] Huh?

206
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,041
Um, hi...

207
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:33,166
Something wrong...?
Why aren't you in the car?

208
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,250
Yeah... about that...

209
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,125
Shut up and
come with me.

210
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,583
There you are.

211
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,333
--[ROBERTO] Nadie!
--[NINA] Ellis!

212
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,083
I take it we're
the ones you want.

213
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,250
[MAN A] That's right.

214
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,583
So that means
these other people

215
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,666
have nothing to do
with it... Let 'em go.

216
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,708
[MAN A] No can do.

217
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,208
And why not?

218
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,958
[MAN B] 'Cause the last time
we underestimated you girls,

219
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,041
we paid dearly for it.

220
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,583
Last time?

221
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,208
[NADIE] Mmm...

222
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,708
Have we met?

223
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,000
They're the
transvestites.

224
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,000
Don't know ya.

225
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,625
Yeah, that's right, it's us!

226
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,708
And this is all
your fault, bitches...!

227
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,500
I can't believe you
don't remember us!!

228
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,791
Got any last words, say 'em.

229
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,291
We were in the
hospital for weeks!

230
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,833
Our injuries were
pretty serious,

231
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,875
and we wanted to heal
as quickly as possible

232
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,083
so we could hunt
you down again...

233
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,666
So we took in all the
nutrients we could

234
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,416
and this is how we
ended up...! Got it?!

235
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,458
That's great!

236
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,458
[NADIE stifles a laugh]

237
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:49,708
Whoa... Sorry,
you're right, not funny.

238
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,791
Well, this time,
your head is ours.

239
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,416
And with the bounty,
we can both go on a diet.

240
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,625
Oh, with the bounty, huh?

241
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,083
Better let them in
on the bad news.

242
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,875
Good idea. Ellis?

243
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,500
I'm not a bounty anymore.
I'm worth nothing.

244
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:04,958
[BOTH] Ehh...?

245
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,041
Yeah, guys, she was
taken off the wanted list

246
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:10,125
like forever ago...
You didn't know that?

247
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,416
[BOTH groan]

248
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,125
Talk about outta touch...
But there you go, case closed.

249
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,125
[TRANSVESTITE A] Not yet!

250
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,375
[NADIE] Say what?

251
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,500
Shut up...! Look at all
this weight we put on!

252
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:26,250
We can't just walk away now,
we're too hot to be fatties!

253
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:30,500
[NADIE] But we're
ordinary citizens now.

254
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,791
Do you really wanna
become low-life murderers?

255
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,375
Shut it!

256
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,541
[BLUE-EYES] Would you calm down?

257
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,750
Boss... You're not
gonna talk to them?!

258
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,541
Don't let your
emotions rule you...

259
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,250
Believe me, you will
regret it later.

260
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,458
Nobody asked you!

261
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,958
Don't lecture us like you're
all high and mighty...

262
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,875
Jus' stay out of it,
you old hag.

263
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,416
Okay, then.

264
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,166
[TRANSVESTITE B]
W-What the--?!

265
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,166
Stay back!

266
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,333
Boss!

267
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,958
If you value your job,
Beckman, shut it.

268
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,833
Now... Go ahead, shoot.

[NADIE sneezes]

270
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,291
[TRANSVESTITE B] Huh?

271
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,500
[TRANSVESTITE B] Yah!

272
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,041
Damn it!

273
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,541
I'm in love!

274
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,166
Now give it up,
nice and quiet.

275
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:35,291
We're not gonna let you
get away this time...

276
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,500
Hands up, jerkface.

277
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,375
Damn, that hurt.

[door opening]

279
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,291
Ahh... Talk about brute force.

280
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,708
Nadie... You okay?

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,666
--[NADIE] Ellis!
--[TRANSVESTITE A] Don't move!

282
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,583
Toss away the piece.

00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,958
[TRANSVESTITE A] Do it!

284
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,750
Let go of me!

I'll turn you
into Swiss cheese.

00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,666
Move, brat!

No!

[ringing noise]

292
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,166
Ouchie!

293
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,541
Got any last words,
say 'em... Again.

294
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,708
So you used to be
a bounty hunter?

295
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,833
[NADIE] Mm hmm.

296
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,875
And I'm a witch.

297
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,541
[NINA and ROBERTO] What?

298
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:23,166
Uh, yeah... Trying to give
you a full explanation

299
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,958
about Ellis would only
make it more confusing...

300
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,541
Jus' don't ask.

301
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:30,083
At any rate,
thanks for everything...

302
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,708
Wish I had some way to
show my appreciation.

303
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,125
[NINA] Please don't go.

304
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,708
[NADIE] What?

305
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,250
Nina and I have
talked it over...

306
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,333
And neither of us saw a thing...

307
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:43,708
In fact, we didn't
even hear anything.

308
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:47,000
You've been in this situation
before, haven't you...?

309
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,083
So what, you'll just
start all over again,

310
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:52,916
trying to hide your identities?
That can't be easy.

311
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:59,416
Why don't you stay here?
Nadie... Ellis...

312
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,666
We want you to stay.

313
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,833
If you don't want
to live with us,

314
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,333
it's okay, we'll find
a house for you...

315
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,750
We'll come up with
the money somehow...

316
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:11,541
As long as you pay us back,
we'll be fine... 'Kay?

317
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:15,541
So what do you say...?
Are you in?

318
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,375
Thanks, you guys.

319
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,041
Nadie?

320
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,791
Then I guess we should
take that as a yes?

321
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:44,000
You hear that...?
Isn't it great... Ellis?

322
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:50,375
Thank you both...
It warms my heart...

323
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:53,500
But we're... going.

324

[NADIE gasps]

325
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,500
Ellis...

326
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,083
But how come?

327
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,791
How come?

328
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:12,250
Because I love that
sparkle in her eye...

329
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,791
Love.

330
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,375
Ellis...

331
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:28,375
Good point...
I have to agree.

332
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,625
[ELLIS] Let's go, Nadie.

00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,166
[NADIE] Ellis?

334
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,083
Time to hit the road.

335
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,500
All right... Let's go.

336
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:16,458
Cool. So, where're
we headin'... partner?

337
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:19,666
Lirio, duh...
Let's go an' see her.

338
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,208
Yeah?

339
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:25,916
[ELLIS chuckles]

340
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,750
[ELLIS and NADIE]
Yessir!

341
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:38,208
