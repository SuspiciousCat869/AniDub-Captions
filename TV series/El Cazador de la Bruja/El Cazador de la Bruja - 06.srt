00:10:20,485 --> 00:10:23,655
I am friggin' done with
bein' screwed over by men.

163
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:19,169
[NADIE] Like he actually
plans to pay me back...

164
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:30,388
How careless to leave my
darling Ellis all alone.

165
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,236
Oh dear...
I can't help myself.

166
00:11:50,992 --> 00:11:52,494
When falling in love...

167
00:11:52,577 --> 00:11:55,747
One tends to lose sight
of everything else.

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,474
Guess Nadie's smartened
up a bit, oh well.

171
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:19,688
Miguel.

172
00:12:23,608 --> 00:12:25,902
Glad you could make it, Nadie.

[bullet shells clatter]

00:12:45,338 --> 00:12:48,133
I can't stay...
My friend is waiting.

176
00:12:48,216 --> 00:12:50,552
If you worried why don't
you give her a call...?

177
00:12:50,635 --> 00:12:52,762
Tell her you'll be
out late tonight.

178
00:12:52,846 --> 00:12:53,930
[NADIE] Quit jerkin' me around

179
00:12:54,014 --> 00:12:55,724
and just give back
the money you owe me.

You know, 'cause of you

I was able to become
an honest man...

182
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:00,729
I could spend the whole
night thanking you

183
00:13:00,812 --> 00:13:02,522
and it wouldn't be enough.

184
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:07,068
Let us thank the good
Lord for reuniting us.

What are you doing?

Idiot...
He's playing you again...

189
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:34,012
He's a lying liar...

190
00:13:34,095 --> 00:13:36,222
and a rat...
and a cheat.

191
00:13:44,397 --> 00:13:46,858
[NADIE] Is he in
the john or something?

192
00:13:55,992 --> 00:13:57,410
Hey...

193
00:13:57,494 --> 00:13:59,746
either of you happen to see
where my friend got off to?

194
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:01,831
Can't help.

195
00:14:01,915 --> 00:14:03,249
You know the guy
I sat down with?

196
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,501
Did you see where he went?

197
00:14:04,584 --> 00:14:06,002
Sorry, no.

'Scuse me...
Anyone seen my friend...?

199

He was wearin'
a Mariachi suit...

200
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:15,053
The man who was
at your table...?

201
00:14:15,136 --> 00:14:17,013
He left earlier by himself.

202
00:14:17,097 --> 00:14:19,099
That dirty snake!

203
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,812
Awright, who's got the
crappiest Mariachi band in town?

204
00:14:25,105 --> 00:14:28,983
[MANAGER] Sure, Miguel's been
playing here for a long time.

205
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:30,819
Well, until three days ago.

206
00:14:30,902 --> 00:14:32,153
What was three days ago?

207
00:14:32,237 --> 00:14:33,697
That's when we'd
finally had enough

208
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,615
of his crappy performances...

209
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:37,909
Loser was chasin'
customers away.

210
00:14:40,036 --> 00:14:43,123
I don't know what your business
with the guy is so forgive me...

211
00:14:43,206 --> 00:14:45,834
but if I can offer
some advice...

212
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:48,962
Stay away from Miguel.
He's nothin' but trouble.

[BARTENDER] Nothin' but
a smooth talking womanizer.

Yeah, thanks buddy...
Don't need to tell me.

215
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:57,053
Can't tell you where he is now
but I'm sure it's not far...

216
00:14:57,137 --> 00:14:59,347
Think he was hatching
another scheme.

217
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,099
Thought I overheard
him say somethin' about

his cash cow comin' in...
some old friend in town.

We met this afternoon.

friend with the blond hair?

00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:52,442
She left with a man
just a minute ago.

time you showed up.

Oh it's you guys...
What's going on?

244
00:16:38,738 --> 00:16:41,574
I recall a conversation where
you promised to contact us

245
00:16:41,658 --> 00:16:43,118
as soon as they got to town.

246

her right to your hotel,

to give me my cut right now,

of a certain little town

is pissed at you...

how you "ruined his daughter."

when all of a sudden
our golden egg

came rolling in
right at our feet.

Come on man,
you gotta believe me.

I'm just a poor
struggling Mariachi...

I'd never even consider
putting my hands

talks too much."

Oh yeah, this is you.

The guy you're looking
for is a Mariachi too...

but he and I still
have some history.

two choices here...

Either walk away or fight me...
I'd go with the first one.

[NADIE] Ellis... Let's go.

321
00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:07,697
[NADIE] Ellis.

322
00:20:22,796 --> 00:20:24,673
[ROSENBERG] Good morning,
Miss Hayward.

323
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,341
Good morning,
Mister Rosenberg.

324
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:27,884
How are you today?

325
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:30,470
Could I have a brief
word with you?

326
00:20:30,553 --> 00:20:33,640
I was planning to come speak
with you about this later...

327
00:20:33,723 --> 00:20:35,266
But recently your
reports have been

328
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,102
coming in
consistently late.

329
00:20:37,185 --> 00:20:39,771
Just wanted to make
you aware of it.

330
00:20:39,854 --> 00:20:41,481
Yes, of course...

331
00:20:41,564 --> 00:20:43,983
I'll issue a stern warning
to my underlings...

332
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:45,985
Good day.

333
00:20:48,655 --> 00:20:51,908
Heh. "Underlings"... nice.

334
00:20:58,373 --> 00:21:00,041
[ROSENBERG chuckles]

335
00:21:02,544 --> 00:21:04,462
[ROSENBERG] Interesting...

336
00:21:04,546 --> 00:21:07,716
Seems a stern
warning is in order.

337
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,741
Did it not turn out
just like I said...?

338
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:36,494
Men are a breed that
simply cannot be trusted.

339
00:21:36,578 --> 00:21:38,538
That's why you never
blindly follow a man

340
00:21:38,621 --> 00:21:40,957
who says he has
feelings for you.

341
00:21:42,042 --> 00:21:44,627
But you followed
after Miguel.

342
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,258
And then that other lady
said she was planning on

343
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,969
going with him too.

344
00:21:53,053 --> 00:21:54,220
That's true...

345
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,847
And you know what...?

346
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:59,267
I'm sure the list of women he's
deceived over the years is long.

347
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,685
[ELLIS] Was he a bad man?

348
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:03,271
Yep...
Real bad man.

349
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,692
Thing is...
Even when you know it...

350
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:10,945
sometimes you just can't
bring yourself to hate 'em.

351
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:15,367
And that's especially true
between men and women.

352
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,870
So why...?

353
00:22:18,953 --> 00:22:20,830
So why what?

354
00:22:22,665 --> 00:22:24,834
[ELLIS] The incandescent
flames of love.

355
00:22:24,918 --> 00:22:27,504
It doesn't work that way--Eh!

356
00:22:35,512 --> 00:22:37,931
[NADIE tearfully] Stop it,
there's nothing to cry about!

357
00:22:38,014 --> 00:22:40,809
[ELLIS sobs]

358
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:43,353
[NADIE] What are you
crying for anyway?

359
00:22:43,436 --> 00:22:45,230
[ELLIS tearfully] What?

360
00:22:45,313 --> 00:22:46,690
[NADIE] Forget it...

361
00:22:46,773 --> 00:22:49,275
Just... stop crying.

362
00:22:52,362 --> 00:22:54,239
[ELLIS] Yes sir.
