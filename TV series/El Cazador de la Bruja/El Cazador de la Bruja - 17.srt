Most of the time though...

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,125
it's a suspected
criminal who skipped out

23

on a court date or paying
back his bail bondsman...

24

We call it going on the lam.

Or sometimes a victim's family

the assailant's head.

Occasionally, with bigger
crimes like terrorism,

a price themselves.

About a month ago,

But it's not a completely
useless lead, either...

it means he prob'ly
thought the town was safe.

I caught you.

This guy's got some cojones.

I'm thinkin' our best bet's
to stake 'im out here.

We have to?

Security looks pretty
tight in this place...

[ELLIS] Hm?

00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,666
If something happened to me,

175
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,208
could you make it
there on your own?

176

you're prepared for the worst.

Heh. You are in need of
this man, am I correct...?

Allow me to take
him down for you.
