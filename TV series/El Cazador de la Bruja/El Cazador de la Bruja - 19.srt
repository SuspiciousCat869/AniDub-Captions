[CHAIRWOMAN] How long
has it been now...?

2
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:50,708
There is no one alive who
can say for certain...

3
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:53,500
When early civilizations
were beginning to form

4
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,458
on this planet...

5
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:59,708
there was a true
need for our powers.

6
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:02,125
However...

7
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:05,000
as time passed
through the ages...

8
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,500
we became ostracized...

9
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:11,791
and persecuted.

10
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,916
Thus, in order to
avoid repeating

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,833
this unfortunate history...
we decided our only option

12
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:20,666
was to hide the entirety
of our existence

13
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,041
deep in the shadows of
legend and folklore.

14
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,166
There can be
no exceptions...

15
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,291
even for a being...
created by humankind.

16
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,375
[CHAIRWOMAN] Now that Project
Leviathan has been suspended...

17
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,708
there are no longer any benefits

18
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,916
to allowing Ellis
to remain at large.

19
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
[CHAIRWOMAN] And it goes
without saying...

20
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,750
that allowing her to set
foot in that place...

21
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:52,750
is out of the question.

22
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:56,166
If the legend were
to become reality...

23
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,666
it would place the existence of
our people in grave danger...

24
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,625
I'm sure you remember
the "incident"

25

26
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:09,041
We no longer have the time
to be acting deliberately...

27
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,416
I'll instruct you once again...

28
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,041
Capture Ellis at once...

29
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:17,583
That is the collective
will of our people.

Taking a detour?

Oh man...!

[RICARDO sighs]

Oh... the coupons
don't cover booze...

173
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,000
Don't drink too much.

174
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,000
[RICARDO] I'll pay
for whatever I drink.

175
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,291
Okay... That's fine.

176
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,291
So when you run
out of money...

What will you do?

178
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,791
[NADIE] Hmm, what will I do...?

179
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,666
Back to hunting bounties?

180
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:13,750
No way...

181
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,250
I'll come up with
something else...

182
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,458
Besides Ellis doesn't dig.

183
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,083

00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,166
That's good.

How come...?

186
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:26,708
Do you maybe not like me being
a bounty hunter, Ricardo...?

187
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:27,791
'cause I'm a woman?

188
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,458
Relying on your
wits and a pistol

189
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,500
is no way to live
your life Nadie...

190

That's the pot callin'
the kettle black, isn't it?

191

Difference with me is
it's all I know how to do.

192
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:44,000
[RICARDO] You don't need guns
to make a life for yourself...

193
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,958
Somethin' I didn't
realize until too late.

You still have plenty
o' years ahead of ya...

196
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,500
Don't forget, you were just
mistaken for being my husband.

197
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:02,583
Heh.

00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,583
Heh. Ignore me, fine.

Ricardo being
there's a problem.

207
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:45,250
The general idea is to keep him
from getting too close to Ellis.

208
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:48,583
There are ways to do it...

209
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,500
Get back inside.

210
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:50,875
Right.

Is there something you want
to get off your chest?

[B-LADY A] No.

Tell me...

214
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,833
Have you ever seen a
witch's powers at work?

215
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:10,916
Like the power
Ellis invoked?

[BLUE-EYES]
That was nothing compared

217

to a real witch's abilities.

218
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,875
They'd be far more impressive.

I assume.

220
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:24,041
Maybe... there's
some bad wiring.
