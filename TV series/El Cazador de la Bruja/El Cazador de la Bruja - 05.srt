[NADIE] You have to ask?

00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,833
Until we get this guy's

I just filled up this morning!

24
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:21,125

De nada...

29
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,625
I couldn't let two chicas spend
the night up there on their own.

30
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,708
If it hadn't been for you I'd

here who's good with cars?

Huh?

00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,750
[BUCHO] Ahh, there it is.

37
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,916
Looks like you've got
a hole in your tank.

[BUCHO] Hmmm...

42
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,750
You're from
the city?

43
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,541
Not that I'm
trying to pry...

44
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,958
But well are you...
from the big city or what?

about this?

A laboratory...?

50
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,958
Funny, you don't look
much like a scientist...

51
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:24,333
Oh... You must
be on vacation.

52
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:28,375
Uh... Where ya headed?

53
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:29,250
The south.

00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,916
I have no idea.

newest fashions from the city!

00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,875
Straight from the manufacturer.

60
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,250
None of that second hand garbage

61
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,125
you see getting
hawked around here.

62
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:51,375
So what do you think?
Aren't these patterns lovely?

63
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:54,750
And the stitching is some best
you can find, very durable.

64

Feel free to try on any of
these that catch your eye.

take a look around?

68
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,666

74
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,416
So... I wonder if you can
help me with something.

75
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,750
[JOSE] Hmm?

76
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,625
[NADIE] Thanks for
your help earlier.

What's her deal?

78
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,500
Rita's a sick
little girl.

What?

00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,083
But don't let
it bother you...

those things...

everyone gets it at that age.

00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,583
Huh? Nice, looks like
you got her fixed.

84
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:05,833
We're testin' it...

85
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,000
How are you?

86
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,750
[JOSE] I've been better.

87
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:12,333
I put up a lot of dough to get
all those designer items...

88
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:15,416
People want to do a whole lot of
looking and not enough buying.

89
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,916
Any sales?

90
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,500
Just one...

91
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,666
Some girl wanted me to sell her
a jacket but she couldn't pay...

92
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,291
"'til she struck it rich."

'Til she what now?

94
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,958
She said if I gave her
a ride to the city...

95
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,916
she would make a bunch
of money and pay me back.

96
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,041
Rita, right?

97
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,416
Huh?

98
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,208
[JOSE] She must be thinking
the streets in the city

99
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,708
are paved with gold,

100
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,583
which of course couldn't be
any further from the truth.

101
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,958
[NADIE] Tell ya what, I'll pray
that you make at least one sale.

102

[JOSE] Heh. Gracias, amiga...

103

Adios!

104
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,250

105
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,041

It's a temporary

111
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,083
You're gonna wanna take it
to an actual repair shop

116
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,416
Do unta others and
all that, right?

117
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,250

stay in this village.

to put you up for the night.

When you're my age,

to be quite the chore.

to put these?

137
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,250

to the side would be great.

138
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,583

[NADIE gasps]

142
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,250
A guide, huh?

143
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,500
The roads up in the
mountains are tricky...

144
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,250
lotsa cars and horses go
tumbling down those cliffs...

145
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,375
If you wanna get through
the pass in one piece,

146
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,041
you'll need a guide
who knows the terrain

147
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,416
like the back of her hand.

148

Izzat right?

149
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,166
I don't even want to
get paid for it...

150
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,416
Honestly...

151
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,666
All I ask is a ride to
the nearest big city...

152
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,750
Any big city will do.

153
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,083
Any big city...?

154
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,333
Doesn't matter which?

155
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,083
I couldn't care less...

156
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,875
I just want the heck out
of this boring village.

[RITA] Nah, I can work all
that out when I get there.

162
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,333
[NADIE] Huh?

163
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,541
[RITA] My only goal
in life is to avoid

164
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,708
rotting in some
podunk mountain town.

165
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,541

167
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,291
Oh come on...

168
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,750
Giving me a lift
would be nothin'...

169
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,500
Unless there's some
reason you don't want to

170
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,500
take me that you're not
to tellin' me about.

171
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,875
There is.

172
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,375
[ELLIS] Huh?

173
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:25,375
We can't take you 'cause
bein' with us is dangerous.

174
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,625
Oh?

175
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:27,666
See her...?

176
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,375
Wouldja believe she's my bounty?

177
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,458
Yep...

178
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,416
Ellis is
a bounty.

179
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,291
Me? I'm what you call
a bounty hunter...

180
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,666
With a target on my back and
enemies 'round every corner...

181
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,083
Run with us and you'll just
get dragged down into all that.

182
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,833
You're mocking me 'cause you
think I'm just mountain trash.

183
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,958
Wha...?
No, it's not like that.

184
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,333
If you're gonna lie to my face,

185
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,208
at least do a better
job with it.

186
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,833
What was I thinking?
I don't need your help...

187
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,958
Good luck drivin' those cliffs.

188
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,291
[NADIE] Ah!

189
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,583
[door closes]

190
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:02,791
[NADIE chuckles]

191
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,666
Did I hear you say
you're a bounty hunter?

192
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,000
Wha... 
Uh... Yeah.

193
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,000
She's not kidding.

194
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,166
Huh?

195
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,000
--See?
--Ah!

196
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:12,708
Put it back.

197
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,083
Yes sir.

198
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,666
Then, what you said about
her being a bounty...?

199
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,541
[NADIE and ELLIS]
Mm-Hmm.

200
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,041
[BUCHO] So I have to ask.

201
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,875
What's a bounty hunter
and her prize

202
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,500
doing in a little
town like this?

203
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:27,416
Well... You see it's
sort of complicated.

204
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,083
[L.A. chuckles]

205
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,916
[L.A.] Ahh... Ellis...

206
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,416
I've finally found you.

207
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,833
And I will never take
my eyes off you again.

208
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,291
[L.A. chuckles]

209
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,083
Never.

210
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,125
[gunshot]

211
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,958
[bullet shells clatter]

212
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,583
Yes... This should do.

213
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,458
Yes sir... I should
get back to my desk.

214
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,208
Thank you for your work.

215
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,708
[MALE AGENT]
Mm-Hm.

216
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,458
[door closes]

217
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,833
I'm gonna go
scope it out...

218
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,250
You stay here.

219
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,541
Right.

220
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,125
If they dare come in here,
we will smite them.

221
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:41,583
Oh great, isn't
that reassuring...

222
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:42,583
Now...

223
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,541
[ELLIS] I'm coming with you.

224
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,000
[NADIE] Ellis?

225
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:49,958
What's that?

226
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,166
Weapon.

227
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,833
[NADIE] Yeah, that's
not really gonna work.

228
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,916
Two?

229
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,208
Y'know, ya might wanna pick
something a little bigger.

230
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,958
What the hell... is this?

231
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,458
[FEMALE AGENT] See ya, Jody.
I'm heading home.

232
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,333
[BLUE-EYES] Okay.
Have a good night.

233
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,541
[BLUE-EYES sighs]

234
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,750
Repairs to a convent,
what is this about?

235
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,166
Where did this stack
of invoices come from?

236
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,000
That stupid child... Heh.

237
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,916
That stupid girl...

238
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,875
[ROSENBERG and BLUE-EYES] What
in the world is she thinking?

239
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,083
You like...?

240
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,875
They'd look
good on you.

241
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,208
Thing is...

242
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:45,583
we don't have any luggage
to carry any o' this...

243
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:46,958
I'll have to pass.

244
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,625
[JOSE] Oh okay.

245
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:50,916
I'll take this.

246
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,416
[JOSE] Excellent choice.
It really suits you.

247
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,000
[ELLIS laughs]

248
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,750
It's perfect.

249
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,416
[BUCHO] Still got another
spare room if you want it.

250
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,875
[JOSE] Nah, I'm good.

251
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,375
It's a bit of a quirk but
I prefer sleeping in my car.

252
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:28,916
[RITA chuckles]

253
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,708
I'll pay you back the
day I strike it rich...

254
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,541
I promise.

255
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,208
[JOSE] Hey chica.

256
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,500
You got money?

257
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,375
What poor manners...

258
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:17,000
Trying to go after my Ellis
while she is asleep.

259
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,250
[JOSE gasps]

260
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,875
Got any last words,
say 'em...

261
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:35,291
On the mountain, I only
told you we ran out of gas.

262
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:39,958
Then when you saw it running you
commented about it being fixed.

263
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,458
You're the one who put
the hole in my tank.

264
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,083
You a bounty hunter?

265
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:47,500
Peddlin' women's clothes
don't put food in my belly.

266
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,375
Put the gun down and back
away from the window...

267
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,875
Do it quietly...

268
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,916
Rather not wake the whole house.

269
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,875
If you to hand over
the little girl...

270
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,291
I have no problem
backing away.

271
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,083
You really think I'd go
for a deal like that?

272
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,916
Yes, I do.

273
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,083
[RITA] Take this!

[NADIE] Wha... Is that--?

276
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,708
[JOSE] You know
what will happen

277
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,375
if you fire that gun
of yours, right?

278
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:16,500
This could have been avoided
if you'd just given me a ride.

279

[NADIE sighs]

280
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,291
[RITA] Come on, wake up already.

281
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,083
We're going on a little trip.

282
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,125
I said wake up...!

283
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,833
[JOSE] Don't follow us...

284
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,708

00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,000

What's goin' on?

00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,000
What's the fastest
car you got?

290
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,375
That was easier than
I thought it'd be!

291
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,000
I'll head straight to the
city if that's okay with you.

292
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,541
Yeah...!
Tell you what.

293
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,583
You get us there in one piece

00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,541
and I'll buy you
any outfit you want.

You got it...

[JOSE] What?!

He said not to
drive it too fast.

[RITA] Why not?

304
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,416
Because the patch
was only temporary

305
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,958
and it might break again.

306

Now you tell us!

307
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:37,416
[RITA] Why didn't you
say something before?!

I'm just some hick.

330
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,625
Looks too late for him...

331
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,875
[RITA] No thanks...
I don't want it.

332
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:41,291
I did my best trying to pick
the stuff I thought you'd like.

333
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,041
Yeah...
Pretty.

334
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:48,250
Maybe so but I want more out of
life than just cute clothes.

335
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,916
Not like you can understand
how I feel anyway...

336
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,166
Growing up in nowheresville
is a death sentence

337
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,375
for someone like me.

338
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,333
[RITA sobs]

339
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:06,125
[BUCHO] Rita wants to see the
world, like any other child.

340
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:09,583
[CAROLINA] When you live as far
off the beaten path as we do...

341
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,166
it's only a matter of
time before you start

342
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,208
dreaming about the bright
lights of the big city.

343
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,583
[CAROLINA]
Especially at Rita's age.

344
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:19,625
Right...

345
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,333
Is that the illness
you mentioned?

346
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:22,791
Huh?

347
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,916
Mm-hmm. Sure is...

348
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,541
Wanderlust hits
us all that age...

349
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,958
But hey...

350
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:33,958
How else are you gonna find out
what kinda life suits you best?

351
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,250
[CAROLINA] Here, girls.
For the road.

352
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,375
Wow...!
There's so much!

353
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:40,625
Looks yummy.

354
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:41,875
They are...

355
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,916
It's what our village
is known for!

356
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,750
Muchas gracias!

357
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,250
See ya! Take care!

358
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,333
--[BUCHO] Be safe you two!
--[CAROLINA] We'll miss you!

359
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,333
[NADIE and ELLIS]
Bye-bye!

360
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:08,958
I'll get to the city...
someday for sure.

361
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:29,125
[grunting]

362
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:33,333
Damn...
Those putas stole my van!

363
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,250
[RICARDO] You all right?

364
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,666
Huh?

365
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,500
You uh, know your
head is bleeding?

366
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:38,916
[JOSE] Uh--

367
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:45,083
It's um... tomatoes...

368
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:52,666
[NADIE chuckles]

369
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,250
Y'like that one, huh?

370
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,833
Yeah.

371
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:36,083
[ELLIS] How do I look?

372
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:40,416
[NADIE] Mm...! It is totally
see-through, though.
