They have arrived...

00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:02,500
Is this it...? Ellis?

4
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,208
[ELLIS] It's warm.

5
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:14,250
[BLUE-EYES] At this place...
where answers await them.

6
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,125
[NADIE] Here goes...

7
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,583
This must be that town
that was wiped out

8
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,791
by the mysterious epidemic...

9
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,166
It's perfect...

10
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,583
It practically screams
"camouflage"...

11
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:51,625
Ellis... which way?

12
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,125
[ELLIS] Say what?

13
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,333
[NADIE] Oh uh, can you tell
which way we should go...?

14
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:58,958
Does the Inca Rose say?

15
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,583
Go straight.

16
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:02,916
Roger that...

17
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,666
Goin' straight.

18
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,625
What is this...?

19
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,458
Somethin's wrong...

[WHITE PLATOON MEMBER A]
Intruder confirmed.

21
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,791
[ROSENBERG] Heh.

22
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,875
Ah yes...

23
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:24,708
I am much more suited to the
amenities of civilization...

24
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:29,583
You can empathize, can't you...?

25
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:34,250

[BLUE-EYES]

27
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,833
You have a cold,
ma'am?

28
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,125
Uh... no.

29
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,541
Air's pretty dry
down here, be careful.

30
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,458
Thanks.
Good to know.

more gorgeous...

...without glasses.

33
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,791
[NADIE] Gets worse
the further in we go...

34
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,791
This is more than
just neglect...

35
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,916
Looks like someone
bombed the place...

36
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,541
What's wrong?

37
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,666
[NADIE] Ellis?

Um, hey...

That hurts.

Huh?

46
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:58,958
[ELLIS] That hurts, Nadie.

Oh... sorry.

[NADIE] Huh?
[ELLIS] That.

51
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,250
Wanna go there...

52

Can we?

53

Okay...
Let's go check it out.

Why are they
shooting us?

'Cause we're a nuisance.

Yeah, so we're
the biohazard.

[NADIE] When I give the signal,
you jump in there.

tell you in person.

remember, Ellis?

to whatever it is
you'd like to know.

[ELLIS] Whatever I...?

149
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,833

to this place, isn't it?

known there'd be nothing here.

[L.A.] Did you know...
that long ago,

152
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:51,125
there lived a group of people
who were called witches?

153
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,041
[ELLIS] Witches?

154
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,916
They could
manipulate wind...

155
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,208
had control over flame.

156
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,416
But eventually...
the witches died out.

00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:16,708
[L.A.] This is where they
created artificial witches.

160
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:23,166
And that's what
you are, Ellis.

161
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:43,458
And right here's where
all hell breaks loose.

162
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,958
I was created?

163
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,250
[L.A.] Numerous life forms
were made using DNA

164
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,291
harvested from
the witches...

165
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:55,083
However... they all
turned out to be failures.

166
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,000
Except two...

167
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:01,041
There's you, of course,
and then there's me.

168
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:05,000
That's right,
I'm like you, Ellis...

169
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,333
Though as a male,

00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:10,875
I cannot harness the powers
you're capable of...

171
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,750
I am... far superior
to human beings...

172
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:18,041
You see...?
Just like you.

173
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,083
What happened to
the rest of 'em?

174
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,291
Right now...

175
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:26,083
the only two who
remain in this world...

176
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,500
...are you, and me.

177
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,666
[NADIE] So earlier...

178
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,416
what I saw was...

179
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,208
[NADIE gasps]

180
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,166
[NADIE panting]

181
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,541
[L.A.] You have not yet
gained a firm command

182
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,291
over your witch powers.

183
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:06,750
Currently, you only
exercise them involuntarily...

184
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,791
but you need not worry...

185
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:12,666
In time, you will learn to
control them consciously.

186
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,166
My powers...

187
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,333
Did I kill the Doctor with them?

188
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,166
Doctor...?

189
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,708
Oh...

190
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:23,291
You mean the man who took you
in and experimented on you.

191
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,958
[ELLIS] Tell me.

192
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,625
[L.A.] I don't know.

193
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,916
[L.A.] But I hardly see how
that's an issue at this point...

194
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,375
Ellis.

195
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,833
[L.A.] After all...

196
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:50,583
humans are foolish,
insignificant creatures.

197
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:55,250
[L.A.] Now...
Come along, Ellis.

198
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,833
We'll begin our new life...

199
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,833
I really hate you.

200
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,500
[L.A. gasps]

201
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,750
Very much.

202
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,125
[L.A. chuckles]

203
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,083
Ellis...

204
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,250
I am still going south...

205
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:19,041
because Wiñay Marka is not here.

206
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,541
Wiñay Marka?

207
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:22,625
Ellis...

208
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,916
[ELLIS] Stop watching me,
I mean it.

209
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,416
[L.A.] Be careful with Nadie.

210
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,541
[ELLIS] That's ridiculous.

211
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:37,375
Perhaps I rushed
things a bit...

212
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,750
It's all right, Ellis...

213
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,625
I will wait...

214
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:45,750
I am certain one day
you will come to me...

215
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,458
Quite certain.

216
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,708
[ELLIS] Nadie!

217
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,291
[ELLIS gasps]

218
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,333
[gunshots]

219
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,208
[NADIE] Looks like their
reinforcements've arrived.

220
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,583
[ELLIS] Nadie.

221
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:15,041
Dummy... Didn't I
tell you to hide...?

222
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:18,333
It's cool...
You're okay, right?

223
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:25,541
I'm sorry.

224
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,041
Ellis.

225
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,416
[ELLIS sighs]

226
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:40,833
It's the wrong place.

227
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:41,375
[NADIE] Huh?

228
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,166
Let's go south.

229
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,958
You sure?

230
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,958
Wiñay Marka.

231
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,625
Yeah... Let's go.

232
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,666
[NADIE] Bastards are
friggin' relentless.

233
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,583
Perfect.

234
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,208
[NADIE] All right,
let's make a run for it.

235
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,625
[ELLIS] Yessir!

236
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,000
[RICARDO] Heh.

237
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,333
Roger that...

238
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,375
Rosenberg, huh?

239
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:01,125
[ROSENBERG] I am deeply grateful
for your help in this matter.

240
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,041
[RITGEN] It's for the
good of the nation...

241
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,833
I assume you were
speaking truthfully

242
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,333
when you told me
that, my friend.

243
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:07,541
Yes...

244
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:11,291
And in the end, Senator,
you will be a hero.

245
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,541
Well...

246
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:16,125
I have faith in
the German spirit.

247
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,041
Thank you very much, sir...

248
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,583
A toast then, to our future.

249
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,208
[NADIE] Not yet.

250
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,916
[ELLIS] Not yet?

251
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,083
[NADIE] Same with that.

252
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,083
[ELLIS] Same with that?

253
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,791
[ELLIS chuckles]

254
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:03,750
[NADIE] Something...

255
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,416
happened to her back there...

256
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,083
But what...?

257
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:11,958
Is it... something
about her past?

258
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:19,041
[NADIE] I'm committed
to protecting her...

259
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:22,416
even if it costs me my life.

260
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,166
[NADIE] Not. Yet.

261
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,250
[ELLIS] Still not?

262
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:25,916
[NADIE] Yeah, hello?

263
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,375
[ELLIS] Really?

264
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,541
[BLUE-EYES] Something
changed on that day...

265
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:35,333
they now each had a secret
to keep, from the other.
