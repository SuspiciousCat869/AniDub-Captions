1
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:40,083
[NADIE] Damn piece of junk!

2
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,416
[NADIE sighs]

3
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,541
Ellis, are you even aware
of what's goin' on here?

4
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,916
Jeep's broke.

5
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,333
[NADIE] Yeah. Did it ever occur
to you to get up and help?

6
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:51,250
Did you want
me to help you?

7
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:54,041
Unless you wanna
roast here and die.

8
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,250
Ahh!

9
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:03,750
Got any last
words, say 'em.

10
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,666
Look what I found.

11
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,083
[NADIE] Huh?

12
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,583
[NADIE] Hmm...

13
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:17,250
[NADIE] Nothin' out there.
Just barren wasteland.

14
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:18,875
[ELLIS] Wrong.

15
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,333
[NADIE] Wrong?

16
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,875
[ELLIS] What's that?

17
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:26,583
[NADIE] Huh? Uh... Ha!

18
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:27,791
[ELLIS] Is it okay?

19
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:28,916
Looks like a diner...!

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,041
We're friggin saved,
come on, let's go!

21
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,000
Waitaminnit...
How'd you see it?

22
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:39,000
My... eyes?

23
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,083
[BLUE-EYES] There is still
much that remains unknown...

24
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,541
about Ellis's basic powers.

25
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,458
[gun cocks]

26
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:55,375
[NADIE] Hola!

27
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,916
Hello? Anyone here...?

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,708
Are y'all open?

29
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:00,625
[FRIDA] Cállate!

30
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:01,958
[NADIE gasps]

31
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,916
Would you mind keeping
your voice down...?

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,208
You're interruptin'
my afternoon nap here.

33
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,250
[NADIE] Uh, sorry.

34
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,500
[ELLIS] Huh?

35
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,708
I see.

36
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:20,375
[stomach growls]

37
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,000
Oh...
Tummy growled.

38
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,958
Yeah... Maybe 'cuz we
haven't eaten all day.

39
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,250
[ELLIS chuckles]

40
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,375
[FRIDA sighs]

41
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,041
[FRIDA] You two in
some sorta trouble?

42
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,916
Us...? No... sort of.

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,875
[FRIDA] Anythin' you don't like?

44
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,041
Drunk people.

45
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:43,833
[NADIE] Eh?

46
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,041
[FRIDA] Heh. I mean food.

47
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,041
I'll eat pretty
much anything.

48
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,333
[FRIDA] Okay.

49
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,375
Yeah...

50
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,041
Me too, long as
it's not too spicy.

51
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,708
[FRIDA] Doesn't matter...
I don't serve bounty hunters.

52
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,208
[NADIE] Uh!

53
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,291
Far as I'm concerned, you
kill for money, you're scum.

54
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,333
Really... Could you
be any more rude?

55
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,666
I dunno what you're
doing with her sweetie.

56
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,708
But mark my words, no good
will come of it...

57
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:08,875
Get out now.

58
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,541
What the hell's
your problem, lady?

59
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,875
That's none o' your
damn business!

60
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,875
Uh... You broke it.

61
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:16,916
Oops.

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,166
[FRIDA grunts]

63
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,833
[NADIE] Y'sure it wasn't
broken already?!

64
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,208
I hope you like
workin' for me.

65
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,041
Yes ma'am.

66
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,541
[FRIDA] Huh?

67
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,416
Oh, you don't need to
do a thing, honey...

68
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,958
Eat up.

69
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,666
I'll wait 'til
Nadie can eat too.

70
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,791
Open wide.

71
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,041
Aaahh.

72
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,000
Ah!

73
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,000
Yum, choc'late!

74
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,000
Aaaahhh...

75
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,583
Nice set of choppers,
no cavities.

76
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,916
I want choc'late.

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,916
Oh, well.

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,875
Aw man,
that's my line.

79
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,000
Back to work.

80
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:57,875
Meanie.

81
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,250
You're still here?

82
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,041
Frida, hola.

83
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,416
Lopez!
Bienvenido amigo!

84
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,375
[LOPEZ] What's this?
Did you take on some new staff?

85
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:07,458
Choc'late!

86
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,875
Can it.

87
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,666
That was delicious!

88
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,958
Nothin' makes me happy
like a full tummy!

89
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,083
Awright Nadie, there's
an incinerator out back

90
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,500
with your name on it,
now get to burnin'.

91
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,583
C'mon, I just finished eating,
lemme rest a sec...

92
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,958
Girl's gotta digest.

93
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,041
[ELLIS] Huh?

94
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,625
Right... Your wish
is my command!

95
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:32,625
And Ellis?

96
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,083
You're fine right
where you are.

97
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,875
I only make
the idiots work

98
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,416
right after they finish eating.

99
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,041
Hey!

100
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,708
[NADIE] Stupid old hag,
wring her friggin' neck...

101
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,666
She calls this an incinerator?!

102
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,666
Obviously just an old oil drum.

103
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,333
[NADIE coughs]

104
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,541
You're sitting downwind
of the smoke.

105
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,541
Ah? I know that.

106
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,875
Here.

107
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,916
Izzat right?
Your jeep, huh?

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,125
Yeah...
It broke down.

109
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,916
I'll take a look at
it later for ya...

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,375
But I gotta ask...

111
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,916
What in God's name are you
doing wandering the desert

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,541
with a bounty hunter?

113
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,750
Ellis is
Nadie's bounty.

114
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,916
[LOPEZ coughs]

115
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,291
[ELLIS] Because Ellis...

116
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:21,041
...killed the doctor...

117
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:24,166
Wiñay Marka.

118
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,750
[LOPEZ] Uh...

119
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,958
So who...
are you?

120
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,958
Just a
restaurant owner.

121
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:35,333
Y'know that's not
what I meant...

122
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,208
Forget it.

123
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:40,291
[FRIDA] What made you become a
bounty hunter of all things...?

124
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:43,958
Musta been plenty other
ways of making a living.

125
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,458
[NADIE] Up we go...

126
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:49,416
I like it. No boss.
No hassles or stress...

127
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
[FRIDA] If you actually
believe that...

128
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,208
you're dumber than I
gave you credit for.

129
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,958
[NADIE] What the crap?
Are you trying to piss me off?

130
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,541
[FRIDA] Just call 'em
like I see 'em.

131
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,458
[NADIE] Heh.
Or you're just a bitch.

132
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,416
[NADIE sighs]

133
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,208
I'm done with
the garbage...

134
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,791
Hey, where'd
Frida go?

135
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,791
[ELLIS] Out to get supplies.

136
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,333
Oh...

137
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,875
What a maroon!

138
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,041
[LOPEZ] Hardly.

139
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:31,125
Just proves she's
trusting of you girls.

140
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,791
Too trusting, I'd say.

141
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,125
Oh right. Your jeep.

142
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,416
[NADIE] Hm?

143
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,291
I took a look at it a bit ago

144
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,500
and the engine's
all blown to hell...

145
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,583
I can bring my tools
up tomorrow though.

146
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,125
So you're gonna
fix it for us?

147
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,208
Thank you!

148
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,916
[LOPEZ] How about some coffee?

149
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,708
Sure thing.
It's on the house.

150
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:49,833
Uh--

151
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,625
[LOPEZ] That's Maria.

152
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,083
Maria?

153
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:58,708
Frida's... daughter.

154
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,208
[NADIE] Daughter?
So is she around here somewhere?

155
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,333
[LOPEZ ] No, she's
at an orphanage.

156
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,958
[NADIE] Oh man...
Did Frida give her up?

157
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,750
[LOPEZ] Actually Maria admitted
herself to the orphanage

158
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,958
when she found out her
mother was a bounty hunter.

159
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,958
[NADIE] Frida was
a bounty hunter?!

160
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,208
Shut up!

161
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:17,166
[LOPEZ] They say she was
pretty good at it too.

162
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,541
[NADIE] Hm.

163
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,083
Then what's she doing running
this old restaurant?

164
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,541
"Murderer."

165
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,375
That was the last word
Maria spoke to her mother

166
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:30,083
before she left
for the orphanage.

167
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,916
The very next day, Frida washed
her hands of the business

168
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,708
and opened this diner.

169
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,000
That was ten years ago.

170
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,875
She wrote to Maria
telling her this but...

171
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,166
[NADIE] Maria never
wrote back...

172
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,791
Right...

173
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,750
But Frida's still
waiting for her...

174
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,708
Just... waiting.

175
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,375
Being separated...

176
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,125
...it hurts.

177
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,791
[LOPEZ] Hmm.

178
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:19,500
[NADIE] Uh. Sorry,
you wanted coffee.

179
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,166

You didn't see that
did you, Mister?

183
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,291
Nope...
But she might've.

[NADIE] What the crap, Frida?

186
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,791
I could wash this thing
all friggin' night

187
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,375
and it still
wouldn't come clean!

188
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,458
[FRIDA] Don't forget to wax
it too, Nadie, two coats.

189
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,375

[NADIE grunts]

191
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,291
Maybe I should polish it
with some engine oil,

192
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,291
you crusty old witch.

193

I'm not sure.

[FRIDA sniffs]

196
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,208
It's just a coyote...

197
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,833
They like to come and
pick through the trash.

198
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,208
Wait...
You smelled that?

199
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:41,666
Maybe...
Are you impressed?

200
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,875
No, not really.

201
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,000

[AGENT] Wha...? Uhh...

213
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,291
It's a compilation of every
record Doctor Schneider made

214
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,416
for Ellis during
his observations.

215
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,375
So all you did was reorganize
them and put them in a folder?

What I had requested from you
was insight, a new perspective.

Trackable patterns of

Proper nouns used
often or with import...

Subtle changes in the writing

Ah, my dear Madam.

00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:19,625
What a magnificent party
you threw the other day.

230
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,583
I'm sorry for my lack
of toasting skills...

231
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:27,000
I hope I did not
offend His Excellency.

Heh. Is that so...
I'm so glad to hear it...

Oh, I meant to ask you, Madam,
are you a fan of caviar...?

I just received a

had a moment to discuss

239

these questionable expenses.

240

I will get to that but I do have
somewhere to be right now...

fixed it up.

All I had to do was
replace a part,

He set fire to the bike
as a diversion

332
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,458
while he went to grab Ellis.

333
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:44,875
Ellis...!

334
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:45,625
[car door opens]

335
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:46,791
Are y'hurt?

336
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,000
Whatcha mean?

337
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,041
Long as you're safe.

338
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:03,041
What are you doing?

339
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,583
Frida.

340
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,750
[ELLIS] Hm?

341
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,666
I'm gonna collect on
this guy and be a rich girl!

342
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,083
[MARIA and FRIDA] Huh?

343
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,916
Sleaz-o has a huge
bounty on his head...

344
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,083
Glad we ran into 'im out here,
makes my job easy.

345
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:35,750
So wait...
You're a bounty hunter?

346
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,291
This person
was a bounty?

347
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,375
Yeah we covered
that, Ellis...

348
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,875
Now shut it before you
screw everything up!

349
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,125
Hey gramps...

350
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,583
Hate to ask, but can ya
help me carry the trash?

351
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,625
[LOPEZ] Heh, heh.

352
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,583
Nadie... C'mon.

353
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,083
Come on.
Hurry up.

354
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,833
Yeah, hurry up.

355
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,000
[car engine starts]

356
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:11,500
I... think I should
tell her the truth.

357
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,083
Are y'sure?

358
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,750
I'm sorry about all this.

359
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,125
Don't be...

360
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,958
You went out of your way
to protect Ellis...

361
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:25,291
Just look at this as my
chance to return the favor.

362
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,708
Now be good to each other...

363
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:33,041
Remember, you two are
the only family you've got.

364
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,583
Uh... Gracias.

365
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,625
Yo!

366
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,208
[NADIE] Okay, sorry!
You three!

367
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,583
Hasta!

368
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,625
[NADIE] And Gramps...
thanks for fixin' the jeep.

369
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,541
[LOPEZ] Ah...
my pleasure dear.

370
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:46,791
And you take care, Ellis.

371
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,000
[ELLIS] Yes.
I'll take care.

372
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,083
[NADIE] Hasta luego!

373
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,083
Bye!

374
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:59,583
I swear...
That's one tough cookie.

375
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,083
[NADIE laughs]

376
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,375
[ELLIS chuckles]

377
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,083
[FRIDA] Maria!

378
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,166
[MARIA] Mama!

379
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,083
[FRIDA laughs]

380
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,583
[ELLIS chuckles]

381
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:31,083
[BLUE-EYES] I was wise to assign
Nadie to accompany Ellis...

382
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,333
Their time together
will have a great impact

383
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:35,750
on both of their futures...

384
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:40,208
[BLUE-EYES] Without a doubt.
