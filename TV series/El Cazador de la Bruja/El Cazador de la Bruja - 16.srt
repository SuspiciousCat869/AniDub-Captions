Bienvenidos...!

00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:50,958
Enjoy your meal at Amigo Tacos!

[BLUE-EYES] Food,
clothing, and shelter

00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,000
are important to the human race.

00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,083
So, how'd it go?

9
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,750
I hate people...

10
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,541
So not well then?

11
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:33,791
Yeah, hey...
How much've you got?

12
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,291
Heh...

13
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,833
We can't even buy
bread with this.

Damn robotic bitch...

16
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,666
She's just playin' dirty.

17
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:59,500
Did you handle that...
assignment I gave you?

18
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,750
[B-LADY B] For your
verification...

19
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:05,000
All of the bank accounts
have been suspended...

20
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,625
Nadie won't be able to
withdraw a single peso

21
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,791
from here on out...

22
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,875
My next assignment?

23
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,708
Nothing, we're finished now.

24
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,458
Huh?

25
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,708
[BLUE-EYES]
Is that a problem?

26
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,458
No... I was just
under the assumption

27
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,875
you would begin
negotiations at this point.

28
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,208
Hitting her in the
pocketbook will only serve

29
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,625
to slow her down...

30
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,833
and it certainly won't
induce her to part with Ellis.

31
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,916
[B-LADY B] Then why bother?

32
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,833
Put nicely,
to educate her...

33
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,583
But if you want
an honest answer...

35
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,083
[NADIE] What's this?

36
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,833
[BLUE-EYES]
Payment in full.

37
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,791
Your fee plus expenses,
as agreed upon...

38
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,333
With a fifteen percent
bonus for your efforts.

39
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,583
What the hell?

40
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,333
Your contract ends
effective today.

41
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,041
Hold on a minute...!

42
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,000
This is all comin'
outta nowhere!

[BLUE-EYES]
I'm grateful to you...

44
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,458
You've protected Ellis
well to this point.

45
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,625
What's gonna
happen to her?

46
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,125
[BLUE-EYES] I have no
reason to tell you that.

47
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,250
Again...

48
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,833
The girl no longer concerns you.

50
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,500
[NADIE] Keep it...

51
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,000
I don't want your money.

52
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,916
Hold on!

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,958
[NADIE] My mind's made up.

54
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:32,125
I'm stayin' here...
by Ellis's side.

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,583
I want her to understand
how naïve her decision was...

56
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,791
So very naïve.

57
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,916
Yeah not so much...

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,083
The idea is to
make some quick cash

59
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,125
without expending
too much effort.

60
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,416
Oh, I can do that.

61
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,250
Hm? Explain please?

62
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:03,791

So stupid...

Why didn't I just take
the money back there

71
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,291
instead of tryin' to look cool?

While I appreciate
the sentiment,

aren't you hungry enough?

keep at it, huh?

so what?

They have a poster up...

it says they're hiring.

But between you
and me, chicas...

in the sauce the
company sends me...

back with your drinks.

00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,750
That really hurts... Ellis.

[ELLIS gasps]

00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,958
You've... done enough.

00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,875
Nadie.

338
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:32,375
I'll handle it from here.

339
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,833
[RICARDO] Where's Lirio?

340
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,833
She's in the backroom.

[RICARDO] Gotcha.

Got any last
words, say 'em.

[L.A. chuckles]

345
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,875
You can't kill me,
even if you want to.

346
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,750
I'll take that bet.

[L.A.] Ellis...

You don't actually know
where Wiñay Marka is...

00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,250
do you?

350
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,958
Just wandering south...

driven onward by
some vague urge...

352
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:04,041
Hoping to find answers.

353
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,875
But I know...

354
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,041
And if I die...

355
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,125
your one link to
Wiñay Marka's location...

356

will be gone...

357
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:17,291
And you will never find it.

358
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:20,041
We both know you
don't want that.

If you ladies
will follow me...

I will lead you
straight to Wiñay Marka.

Ellis...

369
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,916
To think that you would
treat me in such a manner.

[L.A. laughs]

00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,291
It's fine though...

00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,875
Simply a part of who we are...

Isn't it wonderful?!

It's okay to get angry...

00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,416
just pull your
punches a little, kay?

Angry...?

I see...

385
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,583
So that's what angry feels like.

[BLUE-EYES] On that day,
