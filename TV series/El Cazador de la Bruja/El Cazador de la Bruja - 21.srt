[BLUE-EYES grimaces]

2
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,625
I am extremely
disappointed in you...

00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:02,291
Blue Eyes.

4
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,083
In order to capture Ellis...

5
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,458
those in our way must
be disposed of first.

6
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:10,375
That is our conclusion.

7
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:15,875
[CHAIRWOMAN] You are hereby
ordered to kill Nadie.

8

[BLUE-EYES gasps]

9
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,958
[CHAIRWOMAN] How you
accomplish this is up to you...

10
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:23,333
However, there is one
condition that must be met.

11
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:24,625
Condition?

12
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:26,416
Listen closely...

13
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,750
You are to execute
this mission personally.

14
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,166
[dial tone]

15
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,166
[BLUE-EYES] And thus...

16
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,500
I received the order...
to murder Nadie.

17
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,875
[gun cocks]

18
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,291
Ellis said it herself...

19
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:55,166
She wants it to be over.

20
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,208
Let's get this
over with... L.A.

21
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,541
I don't get it...

22
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,708
It just doesn't
make any sense...

23
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:08,541
What in the world could Ellis
possibly want to end...?

24
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:13,583
We haven't even begun
our ultimate journey!

25
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,083
Huh?

26
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,625
¿Está bien?

27
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,041
Do you not feel good?

28
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,708
I know what to do.

29
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:37,791
[GIRL gasps]

30
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,833
Hm. So uh...

31
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,333
Whatcha make of this?

32
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,375
I'm not real sure.

33
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,750
Don't you think it's
a little too "artistic"

34
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,000
to be You-Know-Who's handiwork?

35
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:01,958
[GIRL] Umm...

36
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:02,958
[ELLIS and NADIE] Hm?

37
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,708
You don't happen
to know the person

38
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,250
who put these
flowers here, do you?

39
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,416
Yeah, we might...

40
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,583
Sorry, we don't.

41
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:09,791
[NADIE] Uh--

42
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,541
Well if you ever happen
to run across him...

43
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,625
Will you do me a favor
and thank him for me?

44
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,958
[NADIE] Really?

45
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,958
He was kind enough to buy
every one of my flowers.

46
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:20,791
[NADIE] That guy?

47
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,166
Si!

48
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,541
[ELLIS] Hm?

49
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,708
He actually
pays for them?

50
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:27,625
Uhh...

51
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:39,208
Man, wish I could figure
out what L.A.'s up to...

52
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:42,083
Maybe he just went off the
deep end after all that crap

53
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,833
you said to him the other day.

54
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,166
So wait...

55
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,083
if a guy loses it,
but he's crazy to begin with,

56
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,916
does that bring him
back around to sane?

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,291
I don't want...
to talk about it...

58
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,791
Change the subject.

59
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:59,291
[NADIE] Hmm.

60
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,791
Yessir.

61
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,666
Any sniper
experience?

62
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,541
I've taken the standard
training courses,

63
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,041
so I think I should
be all right.

64
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:44,375
That being said, it has been
several years since then...

65
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:47,916
But I'm sure the training will
kick back in before too long.

68
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,291
[BLUE-EYES] Do you know
why I was the one ordered

69
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,416
to be the shooter for this job?

70
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,583
[B-LADY A] I imagine
it has something to do

71
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,583
with our incompetence.

72
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,625
[BLUE-EYES] You're wrong...

73
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,625
I assume it has to do
with our superiors

74
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,375
being suspicious of me.

75
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,125
What's that
supposed to mean?

76
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,375
I think they believe
I'm prolonging the capture

77
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,125
of Ellis for my own purposes...

78
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,541
So they order me
to murder Nadie...

79
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,000
in an attempt to
test my loyalty.

fix this, missy.

And if you're not
able to do that...

No.

this is our best position.

to wait them out.

think of something that
might actually work?

Something that
might actually work?

00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,875
Yeah, as in a way to
catch the damn thing.

That wasn't a little.

00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,750
[NADIE] Hm?

147
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,541
I see movement.

What's she trying to do?

a taste for chocolate.

Yeah, that's sketchy...

have a clean shot.

So let's move.

we're doing this!

like that it's mine!

[BLUE-EYES exhales]

167
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,750
Little do you know
the real prey here is you...

168
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,416
Nadie.

[gun shells clatter]

171
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,916
[MELISSA] Cute, aren't they?

172
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,458
[ROSENBERG chuckles]

173
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,041
These two are
a bonded pair ...

174
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,250
They should be laying
their eggs soon...

175
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,833
Once the chicks hatch you'll
take care of them with me,

176
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:09,958
won't you hon?

177
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,458
Of course I will. Heh.

178
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,625
C'mon bird,
I'm beggin' ya...

179
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,375
Just get down here!

180
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,041
Funny I was about to
say the same thing.

181
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,166
[NADIE] Hey...
you awake?

182
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,958
I dozed off.

183
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,166
Yeah, I noticed.

184
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,083
And the bird?

185
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,791
Lucky...

186
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,333
I wish I could fly like him...

187
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,791
It would be fun.

188
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:46,916
[NADIE] Yeah...

189
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,625
That would be nice...

190
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:52,041
After all, if you had wings,
you'd be totally free...

191
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,500
Free to go wherever
you felt like.

192
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,791
[ELLIS] Free.

193
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:04,125
Is there some place you
want to go someday, Nadie?

194
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:07,666
[NADIE] Hm?

195
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,166
Now that I think
about it, not really...

196
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,666
Even trying to be nice,

197
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,791
I wouldn't call that a
terribly constructive life.

198
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,083
[NADIE] I suppose the
destination doesn't matter...

199
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:21,000
Long as I don't
have to travel alone...

200
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,083
[BLUE-EYES sighs]

201
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,666
[NADIE] Long as
someone's by my side.

202
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,333
Someone, huh?
Does that mean Ellis?

203
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,500
Sorry kiddo, can't say.

204
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:30,958
[ELLIS] Come on...

205
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,000
[NADIE] I. don't. want. to.

206
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,250
[ELLIS] Why. Not?

207
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:37,375
[NADIE] Because.
I. Don't. Want. To.

208
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:42,458
[ELLIS] I. Don't. Think. It.
Would. Hurt. for you to tell me.

209
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,458
[NADIE] That was a long one!

210
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,708
[BLUE-EYES chuckles]

211
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,958
What's wrong, Nadie?

212
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,250
I'm bored up here...

213
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,875
Give me something
interesting to listen to.

214
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:00,958
[NADIE] Blue Eyes.

215
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:01,791
[BLUE-EYES gasps]

216
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,750
I'm not...

217
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:07,750
letting you take
Ellis away from me.

218
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,333
She's sleeping...

219
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,500
Jeez, don't scare me like that.

220
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,000
[NADIE] Mmm.

221
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:20,416
Did I... Did I fall
asleep or something?

222
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,333
Yeah, you sure did.

223
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,041
Sorry.

224
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,166
Nadie, who is Blue Eyes?

225
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:27,958
[NADIE gasps]

226
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,958
[BLUE-EYES gasps]

227
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,625
You were...
talking in your sleep...

228
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,833
I heard you say you wouldn't
let Blue Eyes take me away.

229
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,291
[NADIE]
Now that you mention it,

230
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,000
I think I was dreaming
somethin' like that.

231
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:43,166
[ELLIS] Is it that person who
tried to take me the other day?

232
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,541
Yeah...
it sure is.

233
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,041
What's she like?

234
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,666
You wanna know?

235
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,666
[ELLIS] Mm-hmm.

236
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,666
Okay, I'll tell
you everything...

237
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,875
Or at least as
much as I can...

238
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,166
I've only had dealings with
her on business matters,

239
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,375
so I don't really know her
on a personal level...

240
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,000
Are you cool with that?

241
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,500
[ELLIS] Mm-hmm.

242
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,375
[NADIE] Well,, in a word,
she's a robot...

243
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,166
A machine with a head
full of gears and cogs...

244
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,500
I mean, I'm sure she's
intelligent and all,

245
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,500
but how do I put this?

246
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:16,208
I think she's the type of woman
who'll go to her death

247
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,375
without ever
finding happiness.

248
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,166
How nice of you to say.

249
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,375
[NADIE] And on top of that,
she's got a mean streak...

250
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,333
Like when she closed off my
bank account, remember...?

251
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,250
I've known people like her,
and in my experience,

252
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,375
they never have many friends.

253
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,625
And now you're just
pissin' me off.

254
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,291
Tell me how
you really feel.

255
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,041
Well I can't help it...

256
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,958
I mean, the worlds
she and I come from

257
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,125
couldn't be any
more different...

258
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,541
She's a slave to the
organization she works for,

259
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,666
through and through...

260
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,791
I'm a free-spirited bounty
hunter, livin' in the now,

261
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,708
never knowin'
what tomorrow holds...

262
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,750
[ELLIS] Free, huh?

263
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,083
[ELLIS] Then you're
a bird, Nadie.

264
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,958
[NADIE] Huh?

265
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,916
[ELLIS] He's back.

266
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,541
[NADIE] You go 'round front.

267
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,541
[ELLIS] Yessir.

268
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,416
[NADIE] Let's go.

269
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,625
[BLUE-EYES] You're actually not
that wrong about me, Nadie...

270
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:35,875
I am merely a cog in
a much bigger machine.

271
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,541
But you're mistaken
about one thing...

272
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,291
Though I am a member
of the organization,

273
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,791
I do have my own dreams.

274
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,000
There is a place...

275
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,625
...I hope to arrive at someday.

276
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,791
[BLUE-EYES inhales]

277
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,250
So you see...

278
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,875
Freedom isn't a privilege
that's awarded to just you.

279
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,291
[BLUE-EYES gasps]

280
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,625
[ELLIS] Hey...

281
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:08,166
Does it feel good to fly around?

282
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,666
[NADIE] Get it!

283
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,000
Ellis, hold down its wings!

284
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,208
[ELLIS] Yessir!

285
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,666
[NADIE] It's okay birdie.

286
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,041
We're not gonna hurt
you or anything.

287
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,916
Don't worry, we're friendly.

288
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,458
That's a good boy. Good boy.

289
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,875
[BLUE-EYES] Come on, Ellis...!

290
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,166
Move the hell out of the way!

309
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:11,916
[ELLIS gasps]

310
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
[NADIE] Is that Blue Eyes?

311
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,500
[NADIE gasps]

312
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,000
[BLUE-EYES]
I've made up my mind.

313
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:13,250
[BLUE-EYES] I am...
descended from the Witches.

314
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,750
[BLUE-EYES] But unlike Ellis...

315
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,416
I'm not an artificial life form

316
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,208
created through genetic
engineering...

317
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:24,500
I'm a true witch.

318
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,875
[BLUE-EYES] However,
I'm unable to use the abilities

319
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,916
that are my birthright...

320
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,666
Do I not possess
these powers...?

321
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,833
or are they lying
dormant inside me...?

322
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,416
It's anyone's guess.

323
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,041
[BLUE-EYES] So if arriving at
that place allows Ellis to...

324
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:42,083
realize her ultimate
awakened state, then...

325
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,958
I assume there's
a high probability

326
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,916
the same will hold true for me.

327
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,583
[B-LADY A] So you're
saying that you

328
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:50,291
never intended
to capture Ellis?

329
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,208
[BLUE-EYES] I wasn't
sure at first...

330
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:57,291
Honestly... I wasn't sure
until this very moment.

331
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,500
But I've made my choice...

332
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,916
From now on I
follow my own path...

333
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,500
just like those
girls down there.

334
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,625
[B-LADY B] If you do that
they'll hunt you down.

335
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,041
I know...

336
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:12,750
So I can't drag you any further
into this than you are.

337
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,541
Thank you for all
you've done.

338
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,500
I can't believe that crotchety
old runt conned us...

339
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:41,500
Jus' thinkin' about it
still pisses me off.

340
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,000
[ELLIS] That Blue Eyes lady.

341
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,500
Say what?

342
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,791
Her eyes were real pretty.

343
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,000
[NADIE chuckles]

344
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:02,083
[MELISSA] Are you sure
you didn't let them out?

345
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:05,000
Melissa... I'd never.

346
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,916
[MELISSA] Of course...

347
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,708
I'm sorry.

348
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,750
[ROSENBERG sighs]

349
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,416
Are you wanting us to
come and get you...?

350
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,750
Little late for that
now, isn't it...?

351
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:25,125
As I recall, you are
the ones who left.

352
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:32,083
[BLUE-EYES] In the end...

353
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:35,916
a caged bird...
can only survive...

354
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,041
within its cage.
