[KID ELLIS] No.

[HEINZ] It's the same
examination we always do.

Nothing to be scared of.

00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:00,541
It's never hurt before, has it?

[KID ELLIS] No.

Did she...

11
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,458
refuse to go along with
the examination again?

12
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:22,750
What's that?

[ROSENBERG] Today is
Thanksgiving, I'm giving thanks.

14
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:29,916
Sorry, would you have preferred
a turkey and stuffing?

15

I prefer not to pander
to social norms.

16
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,791
My dear Dr. Heinz Schneider...

17
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,250
How very like you to say so...

18
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:40,125
But that is why I chose
to place her in your care.

19
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:43,125

The subject is
strong-willed...

It cannot be easily manipulated.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,541
I see, then here...

27
00:02:58,625 --> 00:02:59,541

[HEINZ] Huh?

with the heart.

30
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,541
Okay... Shall we begin?

31
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,791

I don't mind...
it's fine.

[KID ELLIS] You.

[HEINZ] Huh?

00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:07,333
It is you... You see?

00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,666
[KID ELLIS] Achoo!

45
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,333
Ellis, you must
be freezing...

46
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,541
Change out of those clothes...

47
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,041
I'll put another log
on the fire for you...

Come warm up once
you're dressed, ok?

49
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,500
[KID ELLIS] Hmm?

[HEINZ] Quickly.

00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,125
[KID ELLIS] With what?

00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,291
[HEINZ] Are you warm enough?

[KID ELLIS] Yes.

00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,041
Hello birdie.

61
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,833
[ROSENBERG] I looked
through your report...

62
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,000
it appears we have a problem...

63
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,958
Ellis has shown no recent
signs of progress.

64
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,541
Your point...?

65
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,833
My job is to collect data based
on her periodic examinations...

66
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:42,416
I only analyze my data and
report the findings...

67
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,416
It's not my concern
if the results

68
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,916
are not what you'd hoped for.

69
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,041
I'm sorry?

70
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,375
[HEINZ] Hm?

71
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,583
[ROSENBERG] You just
referred to Ellis as "her."

72
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,833
I did.
Is that a problem?

73
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:57,125
[ROSENBERG] Hm. No, no...
Not at all...

74
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,833
I'm simply reflecting on
how people change over time.

75
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,041
[HEINZ] What are
you talking about?

76
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,250
The subject...

77
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,625
That's how you've always
referred to Ellis,

78
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,291
if you recall...

79
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:11,125
In the past, I attributed
your use of the term

80
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:14,666
to your clinical nature.

81
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,333
So what happened...?
Change of heart perhaps?

82
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,875
[HEINZ sighs]

83
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,166
Who knows?

84
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,416
It wasn't my
intention to pry...

85
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,333
Guess my curiosity
got the better of me.

86
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:30,375
One can often be surprised by
what one is concerned about...

87
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,958
Regardless...

88
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,958
what's important is Ellis has
been here nearly ten years now.

89
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,833
Judging from my analysis
of the results thus far...

90
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:42,333
perhaps Ellis is no different
than the others after all.

91
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,291
So, not a witch... Yes?

92
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,708
[HEINZ] Her physical
abilities are far superior

93
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:51,125
to normal humans...
and while minute,

94
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:56,125
I have detected the occasional
unique emanation.

95
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,375
But never enough
that she's actually

96
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,333
caused something to happen.

97
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,375
Welcome back.

98
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,541
[HEINZ] Never mind
Maxwell's Demon...

99
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,583
she hasn't shown enough
supernatural power

100
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:10,833
to bend a spoon.

101
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,833
[ROSENBERG] Those abilities
may yet surface.

102
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:16,083
[HEINZ] I am inclined
to disagree.

103
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,708
[ROSENBERG] Do you wish
to part with Ellis?

104
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,208
[HEINZ] Once the
study concludes...

105
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,000
there will be no reason
for her to be here.

106
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,291
And you are
okay with that?

107
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,333
What does that mean?

I put this...?

from your own feelings, Doctor.

what you're getting at.

111
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,583
[ROSENBERG] Of course you don't.

to a conference next week

of Ellis with my superiors.

117

a glint of light has begun
to shine into the void...

119

Just a glint.

What did...?

bait me, Rosenberg.

166
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,541
That data has not
been fabricated.

167
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,000
That's your story?

168
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:02,458
[HEINZ] If you want to
fire me, then do it.

169
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,500
[ROSENBERG sighs]

170
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:11,250
All right then...
I believe you...

171
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,500
You know...
it is gorgeous outside...

172
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,000
Take the rest of the day off,

173
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,333
maybe an excursion
out to the lake.

174
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,750
I'm sure Ellis would
love the fresh air.

175
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,166
[HEINZ] I have no intention
taking the subject anywhere.

176
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,125
Or have you forgotten Cartagena
Protocol on Biosafety?

177
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,708
Subject?

178
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,125
[HEINZ] Is that all?

179
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:33,708
Yes... I'll let myself out.

180
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,958
Keeping her
to yourself...?

181
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:45,125
Doctor...
You will regret it.

182
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,000
Are you alright?

183
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,291
So high.

184
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,416
[HEINZ] Hm?

185
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,541
[KID ELLIS] The sky...

186
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,416
It's way up there.

187
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,750
[HEINZ] Heh.

188
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,833
How about...
a little trip?

189
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,916
It's so big.

190
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,791
Yes, it sure is...

191
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:49,625
In fact, it has a surface area
of 28,568 square kilometers.

192
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,833
It's about the tenth
largest lake in the world.

193
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,458
But I suppose...
you don't care.

194
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,958
[KID ELLIS] Waves.

195
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,666
That's right.

196
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,708
[KID ELLIS] Pretty, isn't it?

197
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,833
Yes, very.

198
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,333
[KID ELLIS] It's cold.

199
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,458
Ellis.

200
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:24,416
Doctor...
Check it out... it's cold.

201
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,000
[KID ELLIS giggles]

202
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,375
[KID ELLIS] Mmm...

203
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,916
You feeling tired?

204
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,208
[KID ELLIS] I'm okay.

205
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:12,000
It was a day full
of firsts, wasn't it?

206
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:12,791
Yes.

207
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,041
[HEINZ] Did you have fun?

208
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,958
Yes.

209
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,416
[HEINZ] Why don't
you get some sleep?

210
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,125
We still have the examination
when we get back.

211
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,958
Do we... have to?

212
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:27,375
Yes, we do.

213
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,708
[HEINZ] "In love...
there is only one law...

214
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:47,458
That is to bring happiness
to the one you love."

215
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,083
Just bread to eat, huh?

216
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:26,583
G'morning.

217
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,000
Ah good morning, Ellis...

218
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,041
I see you got things ready...

219
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:33,250
Why don't you relax here for
a bit while I make some soup.

220
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,791
Will do.

221
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,416
[KID ELLIS] No...

222
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,791
[HEINZ] Ellis...!
Ellis, calm down...!

223
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,625
Please Ellis, don't struggle.

224
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,833
[KID ELLIS] No... I don't
wanna do that anymore!

225
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:55,666
I don't wanna!

226
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:00,125
[HEINZ] Ellis...

227
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:05,000
[KID ELLIS] Don't wanna.

228
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:09,000
All right then...
No more examinations...

229
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,833
We won't do them anymore...

230
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,625
I promise.

231
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,416
I cross my heart...

232
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,750
Deal?

233
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,083
Ellis...

234
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,458
[KID ELLIS] You really promise?

235
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:29,166
Yeah... I promise.

236
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,041
Doctor...

237
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,291
[HEINZ]
"Life is not complex...

238
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:47,041
We are complex...
Life is simple...

239
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:50,541
and the simple thing
is the right thing."

240
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,458
Well... It looks all right...

241
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,958
considering it's my first
attempt at roasting a turkey...

242
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:02,750
Now... I only hope
it's cooked through.

243
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,083
Which one?

244
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,708
Hm? Wear whichever
you like most.

245
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,083
I like both.

246
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,291
[HEINZ] Oh...
quite a dilemma...

247
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,500
Pick the one best
suited for a party.

248
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,166
Party...?
There's a party?

249
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,416
Well, today is
Thanksgiving...

250
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,166
[KID ELLIS] Thanksgiving?
We've never done that.

251
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,375
Guess not...

252
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,166
Now head up and get changed.

253
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,458
'Kay.

254
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,916
So... How do I tell
when it's perfectly done?

255
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,625
Ellis.

256
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,958
[HEINZ] What's going on?

257
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,666
[KID ELLIS] A present.

258
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:35,041
A present...? For me...?
What's the occasion?

259
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,041
Ellis?

260
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,666
[KID ELLIS]
Because I love you.

261
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:07,500
[HEINZ gasps]

262
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,541
Because I love you.

263
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,708
Oh, Ellis... thank you.

264
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,125
[KID ELLIS sighs]

265
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:27,458
I've decided...
We're leaving, Ellis.

266
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:31,583
We'll go somewhere far
away from this place.

267
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,416
You sure?

268
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,000
Yes, I'm sure...
Nothing else matters now.

269
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Doctor.

270
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,833
[HEINZ] Ellis.

271
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,166
[gunshot]
