[NADIE] Do we really have to
take the road in that direction?

[ELLIS] Yes.

[NADIE] Ugh.
Talkin' to you sometimes,

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,625
I swear my brain's
turning to tacos.

make my ears bleed.

Through Blue-Eyes'

00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,708
we now know the full extent
of Douglas Rosenberg's

codenamed Leviathan.

[murmuring]

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,250
It is dangerous to let
Ellis remain at large...

27
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,708
We should dispose
of her immediately.

28
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:05,958
Correct...

00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,041
But let us not forget
they are working under

30
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:11,000
the assumption that we already
have this information...

31
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,458
If we act too hastily
in this matter,

32
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:16,416
they could use that
to their advantage.

33
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,291
Unless we devise a plan,

34
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,291
we are simply inviting
the worst to occur.

35

[BLUE-EYES]
I believe I've answered

36
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,666
that question for you before.

was unnecessary, but true.

Still haven't heard
an answer I like.

46

[BLUE-EYES] It matters?

[NADIE] What?

48
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,458
[BLUE-EYES] If you remain
in the dark about Ellis...

49
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,000
will it keep you from
doing your job effectively?

[NADIE] Well...

is your top priority...

Anyway, if you
insist on going south,

68
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:33,083
I recommend you take the
bypass road north of here.

69

It'll make
the trip longer,

but you'll be safer
than going through town.

Nothing wrong with
living extravagantly...

I have more money than I
could ever hope to spend.

165
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,833
And all you had
to do was fleece

166
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,083
a bunch of innocent
people, right?

167
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:48,041
You know you don't have to
make it sound so negative...

168
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,291
They donated it to me.

169
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,666
[NATALYA] Those are
from my childhood.

170

[ELLIS] Huh?

China, Japan,
Great Britain, America...

172
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,666
Back in those days I was raking
it in all over the world...

173
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:06,625
I even had a palatial estate
built for me in Beverly Hills.

174
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,166
But of course, they
found out the truth...

175
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,875
that I was just faking it...

176
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,416
The whole thing went
to hell after that.

177
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,416
The entire world was talking
about what a fraud I was.

178
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,625
Oh yeah,
I remember all that...

179
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,875
[NATALYA] In the end,
I'd lost everything...

180
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,125
I wandered for awhile
until I came here.

I believe fate is what brought
me to this little village.

The entire region is
filled with old legends

concerning witchcraft
and the dark arts.

184
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,208
I knew I could use
those legends...

185
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,083
for a new endeavor.

186
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,083
[EXTREMIST REP] The Council
is leaning towards a decision

187
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,875
that would be disastrous for us.

188
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:52,958

[EXTREMIST REP] She was
created by the hands of man...

If this creature born of
nothing is allowed to thrive,

192

she will sow the seeds
of our destruction.

193

[EXTREMIST SUBORDINATE] I agree.

Worst-case scenario...

195
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,416
we may ignore the Council's
decision outright

196

of the Night.

was nothing but a fraud!

been the problem...

my parents stole every
penny and disappeared.

cross again soon.

321
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,500
[ELLIS] Mmm.

322
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,541
[NATALYA] Be careful
out there...!

323
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,166
Now...

324
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:34,375
[phone rings]

325
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,041
[NATALYA] Hello, is this
the White House...?

326
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,625
I don't care who I talk to

327
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,750
as long as they're
really high up...

328
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,375
I have some...

329
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,750
...information you all
might be interested in.

330
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,583
Yeah yeah, that's right...

331
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:51,333
I'm talking secrets vital
to national security...

332
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,250
[SQUAD MEMBER]
Can you give me any...

333
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,625
...details?

334
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:57,166
[NATALYA] It's concerning
a girl named Ellis...

335
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,333
but before that, you and
I need to talk business.

336
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,916
[SQUAD MEMBER] What business?

337
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,333
[NATALYA] This information does
not come free, you understand...

338
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:10,750
Once funds are secure, I'll
set up a meeting with Ellis.

339
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,666
And there's one
more condition...

340
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,416
I want your guarantee
you'll let us all live.

341
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,083
That's me, Ellis and
her companion, Nadie...

342
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:21,125
All three of us.

343
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:24,833
All right...
I'll be in touch.

344
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:30,458
[NATALYA] Ah!
That was nerve-wracking.

345
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:31,500
But it was worth it.

346
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,708
Everything should
work out now...

347
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,333
I'll even be able to move
back into my mansion

348
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,625
in Beverly Hills. Heh.

349
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,791
Just like the old days.

350
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:46,708
Hm?

351
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,541
[gunshot]

352
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,500
[ELLIS] Hm?

353
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,208
Is somethin' wrong?

354
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:59,000
No, it's nothing.

355
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,250
As for the
immediate future...

356
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,125
we shall merely observe...

357
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:07,000
We shall wait to see
how Rosenberg proceeds.

358
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,666
Any objections?

359
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:23,750
Correct, I am en route
to the location now.

360
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,000
[ROSENBERG] Hm?

361
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,625
Coming to get me...?

362
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:34,916
No, even she would
not be so bold.

363
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,708
The heat is unbearable
where you are heading...

364
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:42,583
Limit yourself,
lest it proves fatal.

365
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,583
Wonder if she's okay...

366
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,083
What?

367
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,541
It's nothing, really.
