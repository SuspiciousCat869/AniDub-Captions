[ELLIS] That's it.

Oh, wow...

[NADIE] You sure?

this passageway goes.

Almost there.

The truth... Or else.

If you kill me... the truth

[NADIE] Why do such a thing?

53
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,250
[ROSENBERG] Because awakening
Ellis... required the death

I secretly secured

and left her in the care
of Doctor Schneider...

72

Ellis and the doctor came
to understand each other,

Is... Is this...?

165
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:01,166
A mantle of rainbow-colored
light soars through the heavens.

166
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:05,125
Gallant is the dance of flames
that rends the land asunder.

167
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,083
[CHAIRWOMAN]
The roar of the spray

168
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,333
in frenzied, spastic tumult...

169
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:11,375
They are the culmination
of all deviltry...

170
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,750
Where the crimson
essence ultimately leads.

171
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:19,250
[BLUE-EYES pants]

172
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,375
[ringing noise]

173
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,500
What the-- Blue Eyes?!

174
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,916
[RICARDO] Lirio!

175
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:55,791
Witch powers... After
all this time, I've done it...

176
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,083
[ELLIS] She's cold.

177
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,000
[RICARDO] Nadie...
Hey, do it again!

178
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:10,416
Splendid...! I never in a
million years imagined

179
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,208
Miss Hayward's dormant
powers would awaken within her.

180
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,916
A witch's powers
awaken through grief...

181
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,291
The grief felt from the
death of a loved one.

182
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,250
Ah, Blue-Eyes...

183
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:27,625
it seems you loved Nadie and
Ellis with all of your heart.

184
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:31,333
You saved my dear Ellis
from the grave itself...

185
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,583
For that I am grateful.

186
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,041
What now?

187
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:41,000
Simple... the Inca Rose
is no longer needed.

188
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:52,375
Ellis... Let us begin
our journey again...

189
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,375
I will acquire
a new sacrifice

190
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:57,375
to stand in Nadie's
intended place.

191
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,166
Now... Come along with me.

192
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
[ROSENBERG yells]

193
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:16,500
[ringing noise]

194
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:26,541
[ringing intensifies]

195
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,000
[CHAIRWOMAN] Hm.

196
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,750
Ellis.

197
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,125
Hi, Doctor.

198
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:20,208
Thank you... Ellis.

199
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,916
[NADIE] Ellis?!

200
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,291
[RICARDO] We've got
to get outta here!

201
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:27,750
But I...

202
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,958
[CHAIRWOMAN] There is
no need to worry...

203
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,958
The witch created
by the hands of man...

204
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:37,875
has acquired the means to
use her powers properly.

205
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:42,750
In turn, we shall be allowed
tranquility in our hearts...

206
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:46,333
so we may walk down
the path toward oblivion.

207
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,125
[ROSENBERG] Hm.

208
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:26,291
[ELLIS] Got any
last words... say 'em.

209
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,583
Ellis...

210
00:21:56,666 --> 00:22:02,083
I envy you, Ellis...
I envy you.

211
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:38,375
[BLUE-EYES] And thus...
their arduous journey...

212
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,333
came to an end.
