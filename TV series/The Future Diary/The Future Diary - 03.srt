1
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,541
Look at that sky.

2
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,416
Oh, no. Help me.

3
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,041
My parachute's jammed.

4
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,416
I'm too young to die.

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,833
Ka-thunk.

6
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,083
Bon appetite!

7
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:12,416
Hey, uh.

8
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,750
Next time can we do
something not so terrifying?

9
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,708
It's gonna melt.

10
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:18,250
Are you listening to me?

11
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:19,750
Better hurry.

12
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:24,833
We should totally
go on that one next!

13
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:30,708
Someone explain to me
why I agreed to come here?

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,958
♪ opening song ♪

15
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,333
It's been a long time
since I believed in God.

16
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,291
Thing is, I need your help.

17
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,083
Okay?

18
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,916
If we're going to minimize
bloodshed in this damn game.

19
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,291
The first order of
business is to

20
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,333
identify the other diary users.

21
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,041
I've dredged up
enough Intel to give us

22
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,000
a decent start,
but that's about it.

23
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,250
So I need you to pay attention.

24
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,416
This is what we've
got to work with so far.

25
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,208
There's you, naturally.

26
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:56,083
Then you, Gasai; a.k.a. Second.

27
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,291
Then of course
there's little old me.

28
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,083
Designated Fourth.

29
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:03,041
Third was Hiyama Takao,
but he's dead.

30
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:08,333
And we have Uryuu Minene,
Ninth; currently a fugitive.

31
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,916
So that accounts for five of us.

32
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,583
Seven more and
we're ready to move.

33
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:12,666
That the low down?

34
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,416
Your mission is
to help me find them.

35
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,208
Mission?

36
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,625
Awesome!

37
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,333
Your school's closed for
repairs until further notice.

38
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,541
That's good.

39
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,916
We can use your free
time to apprehend Ninth.

40
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,625
Ugh... That woman.

41
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:26,958
Just the thought
of her out there

42
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,166
running around
makes my skin crawl.

43
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,000
Doesn't help she's always keyed
in to the perfect getaway plan,

44
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,666
thanks to her diary.

45
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,583
It's just my luck to
be on her bad side.

46
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:41,000
You're not going to try to use
us as bait or anything, are you?

47
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:41,875
Well, uh.

48
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,541
Here's the plan.

49
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:50,791
Ninth's on the lamb, sure,
she's bent on offing you both.

50
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,125
"Bait" isn't the word
I would choose, but...

51
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,708
Well, you see where
I'm going with this.

52
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,750
We're just dicking around here.

53
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,458
How's is this helping?

54
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,416
Mission my ass.

55
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,208
Bet you anything he's
just trying to keep us

56
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,416
close to the police station.

57
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:13,250
Still, though:
I can use the time.

58
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,500
Maybe I can wrestle some
kind of sense out of Yuno.

59
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,583
It's just.

60
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,458
When you're being stalked,
how are you supposed

61
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,166
to gently broach the
topic to the stalker?

62
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,208
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,666
Took a while.

64
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,958
It's alright.
Thanks.

65
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,500
So yeah.

66
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,916
--What's the deal with.
--Notice the straws?

67
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,875
Drink up.

68
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:00,000
What in the hell
is wrong with you?!

69
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:29,666
Pull it together.

70
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,208
I've got this.

71
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,416
I haven't left the
party yet, you bastards.

72
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,583
Not by a long shot.

73
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,166
Survival is what I do.

74
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,666
Winning is what I do.

75
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,083
This game has nothing on me.

76
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,583
Damn rain can stop any time now.

77
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:04,458
"Two cops around the corner,
50 meters ahead.

78
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:08,083
Turn right to avoid
danger." Got it.

79
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,916
Hey!

80
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,166
Shit!

81
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,791
Hey, stop!
Hold it!

82
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,291
--This is resisting!
--Are you not hearing me?!

83
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,083
Let's go there next!

84
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,666
Okay, she knows damn
good and well this

85
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,166
stuff scares the
crap out of me!

86
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,958
Wha...
What is this?

87
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,166
Let go of my arm!

88
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:52,500
Wow.

89
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:53,958
She's actually scared.

90
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,708
That's new.

91
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:04,791
Ugh.

92
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:05,750
That place?

93
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,166
No thanks.

94
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,041
Glad to know something brings
out her normal side, I guess.

95
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,333
I was scared.

96
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,416
Crap.

97
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,833
I really want get to the bottom
of her fixation on me, but...

98
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,541
She's just so cute like this.

99
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,583
Hey, hey.

100
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,000
Lookie there.

101
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,416
Last one in the
water's a rotten egg!

102
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,541
Look, please listen when
I say this is not a good idea!

103
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,416
Yuki!

104
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:48,583
You...

105
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,000
You go on ahead.

106
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,125
I'll, just stay right here.

107
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,041
Stop being such a girl!

108
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,375
I swear!

109
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,416
What's the matter?

110
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,333
Well, uh...

111
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:06,708
This bathing suit
doesn't quite fit.

112
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,166
This is so wrong.

113
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,375
Clean thoughts!

114
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,333
Make conversation!

115
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,000
They say the amount
of pee in public

116
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,500
pools is like twenty percent.

117
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,000
Nice going, doofus.

118
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,791
Bad news, my love.

119
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,416
My suit's kind of floated away.

120
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,708
Don't worry, I'll get it back!

121
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,333
No!
I'm naked!

122
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,416
You can't leave
me here alone like this!

123
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,041
Ask a lifeguard for help,
it's what they're here for!

124
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,041
Kay. This must be
Yuno's upset side.

125
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,500
Uh, excuse me.

126
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,291
Her top got swept downstream.

127
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,625
Oh.
No worries.

128
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,750
Oh, sorry.

129
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,708
Stay like you are!

130
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:07,833
Move and I'll be exposed.

131
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,833
You want everyone to see?

132
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,458
Um, no?

133
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,250
Here you go.
I think.

134
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,500
You are a life saver!

135
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,208
Whew.

136
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,416
That could've been a lot worse.

137
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yuki!

138
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,083
What do you think we
ought to tackle next?

139
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:40,958
Oh!

140
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,125
A planetarium!

141
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,083
Let's go there!

142
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,583
No thanks...

143
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,291
I don't want to.

144
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:05,958
Wow!

145
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,083
Check out that view!

146
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:13,041
The city looks like
a model from this high.

147
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:15,875
Hey.

148
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,208
Yuno.

149
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,833
Be honest.

150
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:23,125
Why do you keep following
me around all the time?

151
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:27,791
How come...

152
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:31,000
How come you didn't want
to go to the planetarium?

153
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,166
I thought you were like,
crazy over space stuff.

154
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,333
How did you?

155
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,875
Your diary's driving me insane.

156
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,083
Shut up!

157
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,083
I know you like stars
because you told me!

158
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,833
A year ago.

159
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,666
Don't you remember?

160
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,166
Everything okay?

161
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:09,500
I had trouble with
the survey, too.

162
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,500
I'm sorry about your parents.

163
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,750
Oh, uh, I just saw
that on your paper.

164
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,208
I wanted to go out to
the country with

165
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:20,041
them to look at
the stars, but they...

166
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,208
The divorce just got finalized.

167
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:26,000
Sucks cause I already bought
a telescope and everything.

168
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,291
Why'd I write that?

169
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,833
So stupid.

170
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,125
It's not stupid at all.

171
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,875
Well, it's a little stupid.

172
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,583
I mean, I can't hand
this into the teacher.

173
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:40,166
You could always come
with me to see the stars.

174
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,666
There's an observatory
real close to my house.

175
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,958
Yeah!
I've been dying to go!

176
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:48,333
It, um, really wouldn't be
the same without my family.

177
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,625
Ugh! Why you got
to be so negative?

178
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,625
I swear, some people.

179
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:57,041
We could be a family
if we got married.

180
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:01,166
I totally thought she'd
been kidding about that.

181
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,375
We'll have to
wait till we're older.

182
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,708
How can you be for real?

183
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,541
That was just a
random moment, right?

184
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,458
It can't mean...

185
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,625
Look, I...

186
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:23,833
You're sweet and all,

187
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,291
but my gut tells me
you're hiding something.

188
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,666
Of course I am.

189
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,833
Great.

190
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,791
Kay...
Here goes.

191
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,291
We've got reports of suspicious
activity, probable public intox,

192
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,916
about a block east
of 5th and Mockingbird.

193
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,166
Holy crap.

194
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,833
This is your house?

195
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:48,875
Yep.

196
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,666
Well, then... Good
night. I had a lovely time.

197
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,250
Don't go yet.

198
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,083
You could...

199
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,250
...come inside.

200
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,041
Got it.
Thank you.

201
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,916
Notify me the moment
Amano leaves, understood?

202
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,958
Good...
Be careful.

203
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,750
They made it home.

204
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,250
Well, to the girl's house.

205
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,166
That's good.

206
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,416
Think we should add
a few more officers

207
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,666
to their security detail?

208
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,541
Nah.

209
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,000
No need.

210
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,291
She's not going to try to
make a move on them tonight.

211
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,666
They're safe for now.

212
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,916
We have enough uniforms
out there to scare her off.

213
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,083
What the hell's wrong?

214
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,166
You're supposed to
be an escape diary.

215
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,000
Worthless piece of junk.

216
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,166
Try not to make any noise.

217
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,875
Are you able to move?

218
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,791
Don't even try!

219
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:14,833
Everything's okay.

220
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,750
I'm here to help you.

221
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,125
Sure you are.

222
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,291
Who sent--

223
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,833
Please.
Ha!

224
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,500
I'd look at my
options if I were you.

225
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,666
Yeah. Sorry
about the lights.

226
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,583
We're kind of off
the grid at the moment.

227
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,083
Oh...
It's alright.

228
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:48,250
Believe it or not, this apple
was grown in our backyard.

229
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,083
Let me go peel it for you.

230
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,083
Um, okay.

231
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:57,916
This setup is...

232
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,375
I don't know.

233
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,958
Right.
Nature calls.

234
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,833
Something for the pain.

235
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,291
I'd recommend two in your case.

236
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,916
Why are you doing this?

237
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,625
Who are you?

238
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:24,875
Who am I?

239
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:29,208
Oh, let's just say I'm
a Samaritan of sorts.

240
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,166
You should pay attention
to who you save.

241
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,250
Your karma might get screwed up.

242
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,166
Ha!

243
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,500
I like that.

244
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,250
I'm actually an instrument
of karma, as it happens.

245
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,625
Your karma.

246
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:42,583
Weirdo.

247
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,250
You will regret this.

248
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,791
I promise you.

249
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,416
Let's wait to stack
up our regrets

250
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,125
for comparison till
everything's over, eh?

251
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,458
Why hasn't anything changed?

252
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,666
Am I safe here or what?

253
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,750
Talk to me!

254
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,041
I didn't know what would happen.

255
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,750
All I wanted was
to find a bathroom.

256
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,125
They've got to have one.

257
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,916
I was just going to use
my diary to find it

258
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,750
and then head straight back
to where I'd been sitting.

259
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,083
What the heck's that all about?

260
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:43,208
Okay...
Kind of weird.

261
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:00,958
You bastard.

262
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:03,291
What the hell was
in those pain killers?!

263
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,458
Just a little something to
hurry your treatment along.

264
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,041
Stay back!

265
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,166
Why aren't there
any diary entries?!

266
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,625
This doesn't make any sense!

267
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,916
I'm going to count down
from three, after which, well...

268
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You'll be wide awake, Ninth.

269
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,166
Oh shit, no.

270
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,333
You, you're a diary user.

271
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,208
Three.

272
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,375
Two.

273
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,083
One.

274
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,166
And presto!

275
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,375
Haha!

276
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,041
Now that you're up:
Tell me everything you

277
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,791
know about the
other diary users.

278
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,750
--No! Stop!
--I'd like to begin,

279
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:48,875
--What are you doing?!
--predictably enough,

280
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,708
with First's true identity.

281
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,666
Huh. My diary doesn't
say anything about

282
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,291
me going through this door.

283
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,500
Meaning if I actually
check out what's in here,

284
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,250
then I'll have
rewritten the future.

285
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,208
I had no clue.

286
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,291
Who would've?

287
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,666
Sometimes all you
have to do is walk

288
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,500
through a door and
boom: game changer.

289
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,333
For everyone.

290
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,166
In case you haven't
noticed, Boss,

291
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,125
causality is sort
of collapsing in on itself!

292
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,583
The boy's done it, hasn't he?

293
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,416
He's achieved the unthinkable!

294
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,791
I've meticulously ordered the
causal nexus to ensure all

295
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,916
twelve keepers would
converge upon Sakurami.

296
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,916
And yet, as if in scorn of my
design, something marvelous

297
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,583
has intervened; the
playing field is transformed.

298
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:25,625
Well done, boy.

299
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,083
Very well done.

300
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,166
I've seldom been so entertained.

301
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,500
It was wise of me to select you.

302
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,375
Why'd you do it?

303
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,416
We were good, right?

304
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,916
You... You just
couldn't stand not to look.

305
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:12,583
Those couldn't have been
what I thought they were.

306
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,208
Right?

307
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,708
I mean, they looked like...

308
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,791
Good night, sweetie.

309
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,750
I'll see you in your dreams.

310
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:35,791
♪ closing song ♪

311
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:11,750
Tell me something, Yuki.

312
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,125
What's up?

313
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:18,375
I want to be popular so what do
I got to do to make that happen?

314
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,541
Are you serious?

315
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,125
Hey, just cause
I'm supernatural,

316
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:23,416
it doesn't mean I don't care
what people think of me.

317
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,208
Yeah you're kind of
a social outcast,

318
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:27,958
but I'm sure you can drop some
knowledge on me right, Yuki?

319
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:30,041
Uh.

320
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:31,333
I don't know.

321
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:33,500
Maybe try being cute?

322
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:36,125
But aren't I already cute?

323
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:39,250
I get it.

324
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,041
You think I look all
fugly, don't you!

325
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:42,041
Huh?! No!
You're, plenty cute!

326
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:43,416
You've got that part covered!

327
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,000
Maybe being known
as a good cook

328
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:47,625
would help with your
popularity a bit.

329
00:24:47,708 --> 00:24:48,791
Do you think that'll do it?!

330
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:51,291
Cause I'm a real
bad-ass in the kitchen!

331
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,583
Behold!
Boiled corn!

332
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:58,208
That's not very difficult.

333
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,000
How 'bout roast corn
and steamed corn?

334
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:05,375
You're still doing the
same thing, pretty much.

335
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:07,166
Fried corn and dried corn!

336
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,083
Earth to Murmur!

337
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:10,291
Corn doesn't count as cooking!

338
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:14,125
You really put the "corn"
in "scorned," Yuki.

339
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:15,416
What a space cadet.

340
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,625
Look, don't worry about cooking.

341
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:20,375
The real key to popularity...

342
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:22,875
Is just being kind to people.

343
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:25,083
I've heard of this
"kind" thing before.

344
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:26,833
So what's it about?

345
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:30,458
It's like making someone a
late-night snack just 'cause.

346
00:25:30,541 --> 00:25:32,166
You know?

347
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,125
I asked for no snack.

348
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,625
Or did I?
