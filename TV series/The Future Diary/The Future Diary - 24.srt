1
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,500
Was it really so much to
ask that I get to spend

2
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:34,041
one single day in bliss
with the man I love?

3
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:39,166
Mom?

4
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,333
Dad?

5
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:41,708
Hey.

6
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,333
What's wrong with
the two of you?

7
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,125
Why aren't you waking up?!

8
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,541
I don't want to be alone!

9
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,250
Don't leave me!

10
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,916
We could be a family
if we got married.

11
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:05,291
Hey, Mom.

12
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:06,416
Hey Dad.

13
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm home.

14
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:12,708
Yuki said he was going
to head out as soon as he

15
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:14,500
turned in that
dumb survey for class,

16
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,291
so I waited around for him.

17
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:17,541
But he must've
slipped out of the

18
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:19,666
room when I wasn't
paying attention.

19
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:20,958
Don't worry.

20
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,166
I'll bring my future husband

21
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,666
home to meet you
two soon enough.

22
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:44,666
Help me, please.

23
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,750
Yuki.

24
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,208
This is how it has to be.

25
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:49,708
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,958
This world isn't big
enough for the two of us.

27
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:57,041
Now I can have
more time with Yuki.

28
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:05,250
I want to see him.

29
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,458
I want to see Yuki.

30
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,500
So that happened!

31
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:13,750
I sure hope you're ready to
take the other Yuno's place.

32
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,333
What do you mean?

33
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,666
We should keep this on
the down-low from Deus.

34
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,041
Along those lines.

35
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,708
I'm going to lock away part
of your memory for now.

36
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:22,791
Her phone.

37
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,708
Can I use it like the
one that I have?

38
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,041
Knock yourself out kid!

39
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,791
It'll tell you the
exact same stuff,

40
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,416
but hey whatever floats
your boat, am I right?

41
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,500
Either one is boss enough
to help you win this thing.

42
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:34,916
Why, to become a god?

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,208
I couldn't care less about that.

44
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,083
Sounds like someone's
still got Yuki on the brain.

45
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,541
Sure you're not
just going to try and off

46
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,458
yourselves together,
like the last time around?

47
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:52,875
But why?

48
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,208
Why'd you do it?

49
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:57,458
Oh, darling, it's just
water under the bridge.

50
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:00,125
Dammit, why'd
you kill yourself?!

51
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,875
This place's getting nuttier
than a bag full of cats.

52
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,916
I hope you don't mind if
we speed things up a little bit.

53
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:31,916
♪ opening song ♪

54
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,166
Yuno!

55
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,541
Aw, cut her some
slack there, hotshot.

56
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:09,208
That girl was in a pretty gnarly
headspace after she figured out

57
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:12,541
her parents were down for
the count and she lost you, too.

58
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,000
Still, it all would've
been hunky-dory.

59
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,500
But a certain someone
had to get all nosy and

60
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,791
take a peek in the room full
of decomposing parent.

61
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,375
If that third corpse
had never been found,

62
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,208
nobody would've ever
come to the conclusion

63
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,458
that the original Yuno
Gasai had left the building.

64
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,666
Second could've opened
the bank vault for you with her

65
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,958
retinal scan, but thanks
to that smoking umbilical cord,

66
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,375
you were sure she
wasn't the real McCoy.

67
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,458
Poor thing's been trying
her damnedest to play the game

68
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,708
like she did the first time,
but it just didn't pan out.

69
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,375
A little sympathy, bro.

70
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,250
Anyhoo, this is
the end of the line.

71
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,375
The Causality Hall.

72
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,250
So why?

73
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,375
Why did you want me dead?

74
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,416
What do you mean?

75
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,583
Stop playing dumb!

76
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,833
You know damn well
what I'm talking about!

77
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,166
Here's a question for you, baby.

78
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,583
Why did you say the two
of us should die together?

79
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,375
You said to me
that you didn't want

80
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,958
to be god if it meant you
had to kill me, darling.

81
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,250
You wanted to die at my side.

82
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,708
So I did.

83
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,250
But you promised me.

84
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:25,375
You swore to kill me at
the end and win the game.

85
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,083
Don't you know?

86
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,083
I could never kill you.

87
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,416
And that's okay!

88
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,708
But if that's how you feel,
you need to be dead!

89
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,125
Think about it!

90
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,333
If one of us doesn't take
Deus's place, the world's

91
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:39,291
going to end and
then everybody loses.

92
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,875
It's a big responsibility
but I don't mind!

93
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,375
You'll die, of course but it'll
mean I get the power to go back

94
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:48,125
to the start and play the
game with you for a third time!

95
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,833
You would hack me to
death for a damn replay?!

96
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,416
Both of us dying doesn't
make any sense, that's all.

97
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,875
If you don't want to kill me,
then I respect your decision.

98
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,750
But if that's the case, you got
to take one for the team.

99
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,166
If you play for a third time,

100
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,666
you're going to have to
kill everyone all over again!

101
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,000
That sounds a
whole lot better than

102
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,333
letting the entire
world come to an end.

103
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,416
If you won the game,
you'd understand.

104
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:10,875
Hell, what do you
think our world

105
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,083
is but a
gigantic chessboard?

106
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,041
And every last one of
us is a faceless pawn.

107
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,208
And you know
you're not one to talk

108
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:21,666
about killing people
my big murderous Yuki.

109
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,958
I guess it's about
time to say...

110
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,166
Goodbye.

111
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,416
You're insane.

112
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,750
You're out of your mind,
you know that, right?!

113
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,166
What do you expect of me, huh?!

114
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,750
I'm trapped inside
a madhouse of a

115
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,500
world that never
lets me just be with you!

116
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,916
Yuno was right.

117
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,458
I murdered people
to get what I wanted.

118
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,750
I'm no better than she is.

119
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,125
But whatever goes down
after that is on your head.

120
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,958
So own it.

121
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:05,750
Uryuu after all this
killing, there's a life.

122
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,833
I want to save!

123
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,583
Not as visceral as
chopping off his head,

124
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,291
but it's probably safe to assume
he's out of the running now.

125
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,583
Are you ready to take the
throne for a second time?

126
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,041
Ladies and gentlemen!

127
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:28,250
We have ourselves a win!

128
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,458
What was that about?!

129
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,750
How come the future's
changing now?!

130
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,708
I love you.

131
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,833
He's alive!

132
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,375
Yuno!

133
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,000
Maybe I'm nothing
more to you than a

134
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,458
good time to be thrown away.

135
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,416
Please don't
come up here Yuki!

136
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,208
But I...

137
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,875
I really cared about you!

138
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,666
Your heart knows
I'm telling the truth!

139
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,708
No.

140
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:00,791
Yuno!

141
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,333
I'll save you,
I swear it on my life!

142
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,583
Wait!
It's you!

143
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,500
Dying is for pussies!

144
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:16,625
Uryuu!

145
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,041
Looks like I saved
your ass yet again!

146
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,125
Hey, no fair!

147
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,583
You were supposed to
be dead by now!

148
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:29,791
You think you're so slick, huh?!

149
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,875
Let's see you dodge all of this!

150
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,708
Helping Second win
the game, are you?

151
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,583
That's messed
up don't you think?

152
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:38,833
You watch your damn mouth!

153
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,458
You're not even supposed
to be alive right now,

154
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,583
so you don't get an opinion!

155
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,791
Guess you missed.

156
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,125
Now I get it!

157
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,083
Deus gave you some mojo!

158
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,166
Geez!

159
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,000
A little slow on
the uptake, ain't you!

160
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,083
It's time to go!

161
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,333
We're off to the past,
you chumps!

162
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,666
And away they go.

163
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,916
Well, what do we do?!

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,916
We can't just let them escape!

165
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
You want to follow them, huh?

166
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,208
Damn straight.

167
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,958
Sounds like you grew
some balls there, kid.

168
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,208
Aw, what the hell.

169
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,916
It's not like I've got
anything better to do.

170
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,416
C'mon!

171
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:25,916
Yuno!

172
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,041
I won't let you do it!

173
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,875
What a view.

174
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,666
Owe...
Damn.

175
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,375
I got to work on my landings.

176
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,958
Wait a minute.

177
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,500
Didn't you die
detonating your bomb?!

178
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,333
Uh-uh.

179
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,166
Deus had another plan.

180
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,541
After all I've lost I got
my humanity back.

181
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,125
Nishijima.

182
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:23,916
He saved you?

183
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,875
Hold onto your ass.

184
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,416
It's about to get weirder.

185
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,625
Excuse my, caution,
but we needed privacy.

186
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,583
From Murmur.

187
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:32,625
Sure, whatever.

188
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,208
I have a question for...

189
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:38,791
Be still for once.

190
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:42,333
I hereby bestow upon you
half of my divine power

191
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:43,958
and knowledge of the cosmos.

192
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:44,916
Huh?!

193
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What the hell?!

194
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,458
Your hatred of
religion is absolute.

195
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,875
Who better with whom
to share a god's boon?

196
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,541
Murmur's meddled
in the workings of my

197
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,791
game for far too long,
giving Second an advantage

198
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,708
that tipped the
scales unfairly...

199
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,250
Now you will balance them anew.

200
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,833
I believe this Murmur to hearken

201
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,250
from the first
incarnation of my game.

202
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,416
Huh?!

203
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,166
She does not serve me.

204
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,833
Her true master is Second,

205
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,541
who became a god in
another timeline.

206
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,916
You shall be my ace
in the hole, as it were.

207
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,041
Forgetting all of this until
the appointed hour.

208
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,666
Deus wouldn't let me die.

209
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,958
I guess he needs me alive
to clean up his messes for him.

210
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,291
Can't complain, though.

211
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,791
It does let me dish out a
little more whoop-ass.

212
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,291
Kay, then.

213
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,541
Where are we?

214
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,708
Damned if I know.

215
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,250
I was too busy tailing
them through time

216
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,375
to check out the
road-signs, you know?

217
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,708
It's today.

218
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,750
I mean, it's July 28th.

219
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,250
Really.

220
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,083
Two years ago, to the day.

221
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,500
I was still in grade
school back then.

222
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:47,916
Probably just a fluke.

223
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,333
I don't think of Murmur as
the "planning ahead" type.

224
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,708
Hey...
Check it out.

225
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,583
Since we went back
in time to get here.

226
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,750
That makes this the third
incarnation of the world.

227
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,375
Thinking about it
kind of blows my mind.

228
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,041
Don't let it throw you too hard.

229
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,541
I didn't bring you back
here just to puss out.

230
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,750
Yuno 1.0 plans to kill the
third incarnation of herself

231
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,416
and take her place, buying
herself another go-round of the

232
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,875
game with this world's unwitting
schmuck version of you.

233
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,583
You came here to stop her.

234
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,041
Remember that.

235
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:24,416
She's going to kill the third
Yuno two hours from now!

236
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,875
We've jumped back to a time
before the new god was selected.

237
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,958
That means the survival
game is still chugging along.

238
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,708
Your diary says that
Yuno arrives at 2:36.

239
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,750
It looks like we
got to the party first.

240
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:39,750
"Party," huh?

241
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,666
One where she's
going to kill me.

242
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,083
Maybe but that doesn't matter.

243
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,583
I have to protect this world's

244
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,750
innocent Yuno from
the first one.

245
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,541
Hey, just look
on the bright side.

246
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:52,500
The bitch hasn't killed you yet.

247
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,291
Please, darling, why won't
you just come home already?

248
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,750
I can't take another
day alone with that girl!

249
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,333
Why did we adopt her?

250
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:05,583
If you're never going to be here
for her, why'd we even bother?!

251
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,416
He hung up.

252
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,375
He doesn't care about
me in the slightest.

253
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,625
But neither do you.

254
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:16,916
Look at you.

255
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,166
Do you have any idea
why you're such a failure?

256
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,833
Why you can't do anything right?

257
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,250
Mommy's hurting worse
than anything,

258
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,500
and you stare up
at me like it's my fault!

259
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,916
All I need is someone to give a

260
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,916
damn can't you do
that for Mommy?!

261
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,333
I'll help, Mommy.

262
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,416
I promise.

263
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,125
You hate me.

264
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,416
You say you don't,
but I can see it in your eyes.

265
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,041
I'll bet you curse
the very day I was born.

266
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,333
No I don't.

267
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:40,250
I love you.

268
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,791
No.

269
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,958
You've despised me ever since
the day we brought you home.

270
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:47,375
You purposely disobey me because
you know how it wounds me!

271
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,875
I know you do!

272
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:52,208
Mommy, no I would never
do anything to hurt you!

273
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,750
Why am I even here?

274
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:57,041
You don't need me, and your
father, he's never needed me.

275
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,333
What am I doing,
living in this prison?

276
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:02,666
What horrible thing did
I do to get sent here?

277
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,375
My whole life is a mistake.

278
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,583
Your silence means
you agree with me!

279
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,791
Don't be sad.
Mommy.

280
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,875
I'm sorry.

281
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,041
I'm sorry your mother
is so worthless.

282
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,708
This is goodbye.

283
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,750
I'm sorry, Yuno.

284
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,083
No, wait.

285
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,250
Come back.

286
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,416
Please don't go!

287
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,750
This is the world of
two years ago.

288
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,416
Mom and Dad are
still alive in this one.

289
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,666
Along with everyone else.

290
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,583
Yeah... Well, don't
make yourself at home kid.

291
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,750
Enough gawking.

292
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,541
Let's get down to business
before those two arrive.

293
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,583
Know you this, Funatsu.

294
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,750
We are here to give assistance
to the souls of the weak.

295
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,541
That must never be forgotten.

296
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,125
You're right, Lady Tsubaki,
a thousand pardons.

297
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,291
Have you any wisdom for
the Founder?

298
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,000
Indeed I do.

299
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:04,125
Tell him to act with all
due prudence while he is away.

300
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:07,375
And remind him to
only drink in moderation.

301
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,541
As he knows.

302
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,791
I will be observing
him from afar.

303
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,666
Very well.
I take my leave of you, Milady.

304
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,750
"Watching him
from afar," my ass.

305
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,583
If she had second sight
she would never let me

306
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,541
within two hundred feet
of her parents' car.

307
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,416
Pardon me, how are
the preparations

308
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,833
coming along Mr. Mayor?

309
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,708
Better than even I had expected.

310
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,666
Holon's capacity for
analysis is phenomenal.

311
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,166
Putting the finishing
touches on these

312
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,791
Future Diaries should
take no time at all.

313
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,541
I'm pleased to report
that the second

314
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,958
and third Holon units
will soon be operational.

315
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,375
As you know, sir,
that will triple the

316
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,291
amount of processing
power at our disposal.

317
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,250
Good.

318
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,625
Very good.

319
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,791
Then the testing of
prototypes will continue apace.

320
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:57,291
"Look upon my works,
ye mighty, and despair!"

321
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,625
This should prove
an amusing experiment.

322
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,333
Now we need but
choose which players

323
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,416
to toss into the crucible.

324
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:10,708
Huh.

325
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,083
Not a single car in the garage.

326
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,750
Are her rich-ass folks
out for the night?

327
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,666
Just beyond this door.

328
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,208
According to my diary,
that's where Mr. and Mrs. Gasai

329
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,291
keep the third
Yuno locked up.

330
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,166
Hey, don't get involved
with this one, you hear me?

331
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,541
Why is that?

332
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,458
I don't need you making
this any more complicated.

333
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,833
Serious.

334
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,291
Cause I'm not looking to
actively court trouble, dig?

335
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,833
You're only here to put
Yuno 1.0 in her place.

336
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,125
I'll just look.

337
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,625
I've got to make
sure she's okay.

338
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,750
Yuno?

339
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,041
That odor.

340
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,541
What is it?

341
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,083
You see?
She's alive.

342
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,375
Now let's jet.

343
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,083
The smell's going
to make me gag.

344
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,166
Hey!
What the hell?!

345
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,375
Wait this is straw.

346
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,500
She was eating the tatami
mat, and choked on it!

347
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,500
Yeah, I need an ambulance ASAP.

348
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,291
A friend of mine ate
something she shouldn't

349
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,708
have and now I think
she's choking.

350
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,291
Come on!

351
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,333
I don't know.

352
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,125
The Gasai residence,
in district 1.

353
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,250
Please, just get here quickly.

354
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:27,833
Good!

355
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,041
What did I say to you?!

356
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,458
What'd we just
frigging talk about?!

357
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,166
I don't care!

358
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:33,875
I had to help her.

359
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,125
I know this isn't my
world but she's still Yuno.

360
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,875
I can't write her off.

361
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:41,083
I can change this
world's future to save her.

362
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,833
God, you're such an idiot.

363
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,333
Yuno.

364
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,500
I'm not letting you kill her.

365
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:53,791
Got to get up
pretty early in the

366
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,333
morning to get
something past your diary.

367
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:59,375
It sees Dead Ends
coming from a mile away.

368
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,458
So I brought you
a little surprise.

369
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:05,750
I think you're going to get a

370
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:09,041
kick out of these
familiar faces.

371
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,291
Oh my god.

372
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:13,500
Mom!

373
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,625
Dad!

374
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,833
Well, now that we're all here.

375
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,583
Let the death begin.

376
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:19,958
Don't do this.

377
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,541
Time to go!

378
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,666
Why the hell are
we running away, Ninth?!

379
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,416
Those are my
Mom and Dad down there!

380
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,833
Don't be stupid!

381
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,791
Those two weren't
your parents, okay?!

382
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,458
The Mom and Dad
you knew are dead!

383
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,833
But they!

384
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,458
Dammit, Ninth!

385
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:40,458
Take me back!

386
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,750
I've got to get
them out of there!

387
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,583
I'm not going
to lose them again!

388
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,541
Stop squirming around,
you idiot!

389
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,125
Put me down, now!

390
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,791
Put you down, huh?!

391
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,583
What the hell did we
travel back in time to do, kid?!

392
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,875
Save Yuno?! Or save
the new one on my back?!

393
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,250
Or maybe save your folks!

394
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,625
Make up your mind!

395
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,625
Why're we here?!

396
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:12,625
♪ closing song ♪

397
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:45,041
Got a problem, feel alone?

398
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:48,000
Just call me on the telephone!

399
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:49,875
Hey, party people!

400
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,708
It's time for some
counseling, live on the air!

401
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,000
Yours truly, the
great and powerful Dr. Murmur,

402
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,291
is on the line,

403
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,541
so if something's bugging
you give me a call!

404
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:58,500
Yeah?

405
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,291
What's your damage?

406
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,125
I'm listening so go nuts!

407
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:01,875
Uh.

408
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:02,916
Hello Doctor.

409
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,500
I'm a housewife whose husband

410
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,666
keeps coming home
later and later.

411
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,166
You should catch up on TV shows,

412
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,541
since you don't have to share
the remote with anybody.

413
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,291
Bam.

414
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,208
What's your damage?

415
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,041
I'm ready,
so knock yourself out!

416
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,166
Hi.

417
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,291
It's me again.

418
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,958
Actually, my husband
isn't coming home

419
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,250
at all not for days
at a stretch.

420
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,625
What's worse, he won't
even answer his phone!

421
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:29,416
Dr. Murmur, you don't you don't
think he's avoiding me, do you?!

422
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,625
Pretty much, yeah.

423
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:31,708
Take yourself a nap.

424
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:33,041
Could be a while.

425
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,458
Bam.

426
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:37,750
Dr. Murmur speaking.

427
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:39,125
What's your major malfunction?

428
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:40,625
Me again, sorry!

429
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,291
The nap thing didn't work!

430
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,875
Look, my husband's not
coming home, ever!

431
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:46,791
And my daughter's a
hopeless ingrate!

432
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:48,833
She hardly ever listens
to a word I say,

433
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:50,916
and when she does,
it's just to give me backtalk!

434
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,416
And she won't study!

435
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,458
Not that her grades
are bad,

436
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:55,208
mind you but they
could be better!

437
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,875
It's not that I don't
care about her feelings,

438
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,625
but the competition for the good
schools is getting insane.

439
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:01,625
If she doesn't give it her all,
she won't make the cut!

440
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:03,875
I only push her because I care!

441
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:04,666
Hello?

442
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,750
Get a hobby, sister.

443
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:07,541
I suggest social drinking.

444
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:08,666
Bam.

445
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:13,750
Okay talk to me, home-girl,
I know it's you again.

446
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:15,375
It probably has
nothing to do with it

447
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:17,958
but that problem child of
mine is adopted.

448
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:19,750
My husband and I
weren't able to have kids,

449
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,958
not that we tried
nearly often enough

450
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:24,791
for my liking but
that's a whole other call.

451
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:26,875
Our folks are pretty
loaded, so we were

452
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:29,083
hoping for a boy to
inherit the family business.

453
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:30,375
But we adopted a girl.

454
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:31,458
Go figure.

455
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:32,625
You should have
the birds-and-the-bees

456
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:34,041
talk with your husband.

457
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,500
Yup.

458
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,875
Wow, that was pretty fast!

459
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:39,833
So, what did he think?

460
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:41,125
You have to help me, Doctor!

461
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,958
I'm in serious
trouble over here!

462
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,708
Could you be a
little more specific?

463
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,291
Just give me one
morsel of good advice!

464
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,791
I'm only going to say it once.

465
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:49,500
You ready?

466
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:50,291
Yes!

467
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,416
I'm not a doctor.

468
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,833
I'm really just an intern here.

469
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:53,791
See ya!

470
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,041
Bam.

471
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,291
Well, that's all the
time we have for tonight!

472
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:00,833
This is Dr. Murmur,
signing off!
