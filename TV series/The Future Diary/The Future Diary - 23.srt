1
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,958
Don't take it personal, boss.

2
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,833
This is really for the best.

3
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:45,625
We don't want reality ripped
apart before July 28th, right?

4
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,583
I was right to be suspicious.

5
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:51,333
Know, recalcitrant imp:
as my servant,

6
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:54,958
the power you wield
is not yours to control.

7
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,000
The bracelets round
your wrists are not trinkets;

8
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,625
they are restraints.

9
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:02,333
Oh, we'll see about
that I have a feeling

10
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:05,166
you're in for an
unpleasant surprise.

11
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,208
There we are...

12
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:19,041
...as pro tem ruler of
this desolation

13
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:22,083
I declare my powers
totally unfettered!

14
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,750
All hail Queen Murmur!

15
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:31,083
♪ opening song ♪

16
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,208
What the hell do you mean

17
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,458
reality ends on
July Twenty Eighth?!

18
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,958
Indisputable fact
sweet pea it's in my diary.

19
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,250
Don't take my
word for it, though,

20
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,250
yours is bound to
say the same thing.

21
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:12,583
Holy crap.

22
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,333
This can't be true!

23
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,208
Afraid so.

24
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,541
But it's not all bad news.

25
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,041
There's a silver lining,
believe it or not.

26
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,208
The day we all die will be
the happiest of our lives.

27
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,708
That's when we'll truly
belong to each other.

28
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,416
Is that water I'm hearing?

29
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,708
Funny.

30
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,500
The plumbing was shut
off last time I was here.

31
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,416
What's up with that?

32
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,500
Don't tell me she's tapped
into a neighbor's mainline.

33
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,791
Then again, why does it matter?

34
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,416
No one's gonna complain.

35
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,375
Frigging world's about to end.

36
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,166
Damn.

37
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,291
It's really gonna happen.

38
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:18,833
Hey.

39
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,500
Are you here or what?

40
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,333
Oh!
Good morning Yuki!

41
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,916
Are you bathing in
a trash can?!

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,166
There's room for one more
if you want to come in.

43
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,833
Wait, you mean, like...

44
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,666
Feels really good.

45
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,083
Wait! Ugh.

46
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:40,625
Silly.

47
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,333
Lighten up huh?

48
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,541
Sheesh.

49
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:48,000
You were so picturing me naked.

50
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,041
No I wasn't.

51
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,250
Oh yeah, sure.

52
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,041
Liar, liar pants on fire.

53
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,500
Just give me a couple
minutes to get the

54
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,541
water temp back up
and you're good to go.

55
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:57,916
I'll just skip today.

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,458
Oh, don't be a grouch,
you gotta take

57
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,833
a bath at least every
twenty four hours.

58
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,416
We're the only two users left.

59
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,375
Weird not to have to keep
looking over my shoulder.

60
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,875
Still though, feels like
maybe I should anyway.

61
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:15,916
What if they were right?

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,791
What if it's true that no
one can be brought back?

63
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,708
What if Yuno really
has been lying?

64
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,041
Couple more pieces.

65
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,541
Out to do it.

66
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,375
She's hiding something,
I know she is.

67
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,416
But at this point, why bother?

68
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,458
When the time is right,
she's going to murder you!

69
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:34,875
Who knows?

70
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,083
Maybe she's
just killing me softly.

71
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,208
I've got to stop
thinking like that.

72
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:41,666
She's nuts about me.

73
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,458
I'm fine.

74
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:57,000
I wanna trust her; I really do.

75
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,791
But it'd be stupid not to
keep checking my diary.

76
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,583
Dad was built a little bit
different than you, but...

77
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,916
A few alterations, and presto!

78
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,958
Hey, I was serious about
us taking a bath together.

79
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,791
I, don't think that'd
be a good idea.

80
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,291
Why'd you say that?

81
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,000
Well, because of the water.

82
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,250
I mean, without my cell phone

83
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,625
it'd be like shooting
fish in a barrel.

84
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,416
After all this...

85
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,708
You still aren't
able to trust me.

86
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:25,750
No.

87
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,375
It's just.

88
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,541
Dinner was great.

89
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,208
Well, I'm off to bed.

90
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,250
Good night.

91
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,750
Damn it, Yuki!
Why do have to be like this?!

92
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,500
Hold up!
What is this about?

93
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,708
Look, I know it freaks you
out that I'm crazy-good

94
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,583
at killing people,
and that I may not be

95
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,916
as pretty as some of
the other girls, okay?!

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,875
But goddamn it,
cut me some slack!

97
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,416
Everything I've done
I did to get the bad stuff

98
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,416
over with so
we could be together.

99
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,666
And what do I get?

100
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,958
I get "dinner was great,"
and "good night."

101
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,583
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,166
Don't be like this.

103
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,750
It's nothing personal;
I just feel in over my head.

104
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,250
She loves me, right?

105
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,166
I mean, this is real?

106
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:44,041
Hell, even if it is, doesn't
mean I'm not still in danger.

107
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,458
Hey, Yuki.

108
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,541
You asleep yet?

109
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,916
Come on, if she
really wanted to off me

110
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,416
she'd have done it by now.

111
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,916
It's not like she hasn't had
about a dozen opportunities.

112
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,541
Why wait, right?

113
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Damn it, I don't know.

114
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,541
Where'd you go?

115
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,333
Seriously.

116
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:30,958
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,333
She's an unknown quantity.

118
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,875
Plain and simple.

119
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,208
There is no uncomplicated
way to feel about her.

120
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,500
Takes me back.

121
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,458
This is where I first
got the courage

122
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,083
to break the ice with you.

123
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,541
Remember that?

124
00:08:58,625 --> 00:08:59,875
Yuno.

125
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,625
Even back then, I knew
we would end up together.

126
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,416
Cheesy?
Sure.

127
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,833
But it's...
Whatever.

128
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,833
If you want me to stay
in the wings, I'll do it.

129
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,791
Please, Yuno.

130
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,458
Tomorrow, the world ends.

131
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,375
I deserve to be alone.

132
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,375
I've treated my guardian
angel like a fly.

133
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,208
I'm a jackass.

134
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,750
She deserves someone better.

135
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,125
I want to be that someone.

136
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,791
The end is here.

137
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,875
I can't let her spend it alone.

138
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,250
I've got to go to her.

139
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,875
Time to man up.

140
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,875
Hey there.

141
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,208
Yuki?

142
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,916
If your offer stands...

143
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,625
I'm in.

144
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:59,166
July twenty eighth isn't going
to be our Happy Ending.

145
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,333
Tonight is.

146
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,583
Hey, uh pookie?

147
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,458
Yeah?
What's up?

148
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,916
What do you say we get outta
here before the water gets cold?

149
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,666
Oh, um.

150
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,000
Sure.

151
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,291
--So, yeah.
--So, yeah.

152
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,541
Sorry.

153
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,791
Didn't mean to interrupt you.
You go first.

154
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,208
No, no.
Please, you first.

155
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,458
I insist.

156
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,833
I just wanted you to know it's

157
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,708
my first time doing
this sort of thing.

158
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,208
So please be gentle.

159
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,500
That makes sense.

160
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,458
No prob.

161
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,375
It's my first time, too.

162
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,166
Don't worry, love.

163
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,000
We'll be fine.

164
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,083
I know we will.

165
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,583
Your lips feel
like butterfly wings.

166
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,375
Yuno.

167
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,000
Yuki.

168
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,083
I love you so much, Yuno.

169
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,291
I...

170
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,791
I love you, too, Yuki.

171
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,833
Sure took us a while
to get here, huh?

172
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,666
Whole thing finally
feels right, though.

173
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,416
Like we were always meant to be.

174
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,791
So romantic.

175
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,166
Since we've made it this far.

176
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,000
What do you say we adopt
a policy of full disclosure?

177
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,333
Why did you tell me
I'd be able to bring

178
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:46,041
everyone back when you
knew that wasn't true?

179
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:48,833
She's going to murder you!

180
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,958
No, wait!
It was just a question!

181
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,750
What the hell?

182
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,416
I'm sorry if I was dishonest.

183
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,375
All I wanted was to
ease your mind, love.

184
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,083
Your parents were
weighing on our conscience

185
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,416
and I didn't want that.

186
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,750
If I had to tell a lie
to make you happy.

187
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,666
So be it.

188
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,041
I've known since this mess began

189
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,083
that you can't bring
back the dead.

190
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,875
I asked Deus and
he leveled with me,

191
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,000
said it just wasn't possible.

192
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,416
I want you to kill me now
before this moment ends.

193
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,875
Before the truth unravels our

194
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,500
happiness any more
than it already has.

195
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:26,958
You know I can't do that.

196
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,041
What would be the point of
winning the throne of time

197
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,666
if I'm nothing but some
schmuck sitting there

198
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,625
pining over the lives I wasn't
able to bring back, huh?

199
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,791
At least you'd be alive,
wouldn't you?

200
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,083
No!

201
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,208
Being god isn't worth shit
if it means I have to kill you!

202
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,583
We're facing the end together!

203
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:47,375
Huh some things never change.

204
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,666
It's good we're being
open about everything.

205
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,333
I wanted to be able to
trust you, and now I can.

206
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:53,750
I don't think Aru
could've really meant

207
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,083
what he said in his message.

208
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,083
Wait...i
What message?

209
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,916
He was babbling off of his head.

210
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,458
It means nothing.

211
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:01,458
I don't care.

212
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,458
What'd it say?

213
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:03,833
Well we hammered something out

214
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,666
on his phone and
showed it to me.

215
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,250
It was about you.

216
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:11,250
He said this wasn't the first
time you've played the game.

217
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,125
That you'd actually won
and become a goddess

218
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,166
in some universe that
existed before this one.

219
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:20,666
Oh crap!

220
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,291
No...
It's too soon for this.

221
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,875
What's wrong, sweetie?

222
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,583
What's going on?

223
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:29,875
Damn it.

224
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,250
Was it really so much to
ask that I get to spend

225
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,583
one single day in bliss
with the man I love?

226
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,208
She's insane!

227
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,541
I've got to get out of here!

228
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,000
This is crazy.
A minute ago...

229
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,958
We were in love.

230
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,958
Why are you doing this?!

231
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,500
Careful what you ask for, kid.

232
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,125
No!!!

233
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,541
What is this?

234
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,375
Wait, I'm in our class.

235
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,750
The survey.

236
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,250
Hey, Yuno.

237
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:58,666
Everything okay?

238
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,166
I had trouble with
the survey, too.

239
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,750
I wanted to go out to the
country with them

240
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,000
to look at the stars, but...

241
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:04,875
They...

242
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:05,666
She's immaterial.

243
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,625
No touchy.

244
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:08,833
It's you!

245
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,541
The difference here is
the same as between

246
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,083
a live taping and a rerun.

247
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,083
What is this?

248
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,333
What am I seeing here?

249
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,375
It's a very important
point in the timeline.

250
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,875
Your girl's already
axed her parents.

251
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,416
You could always come
with me to see the stars.

252
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,875
There's like an observatory
real close to my house.

253
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,916
This is where her
life takes a turn.

254
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,833
Poor little thing didn't have
much in the way of hope

255
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,333
before you came
into her life, studmuffin.

256
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:32,666
Impossible.

257
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,541
We could be a family
if we got married.

258
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,625
We'll have to
wait till we're older.

259
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,541
This isn't real.

260
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,958
So you're gonna be
what they call a hard sell.

261
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:43,750
Kay.

262
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,250
Wait, where're you going?

263
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,000
You mean where are
the two of us going.

264
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,916
Did I read too much
into things or aren't you

265
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,041
curious 'bout why
she's trying to kill you?

266
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,916
Don't listen to her, Yuki!

267
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
She's a lying whore!

268
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,541
What she's showing
you isn't the truth!

269
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:58,541
Don't watch!

270
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,333
I'm begging you not to watch!

271
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,250
Please!!!

272
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,000
What are you doing?

273
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,333
Where are we?

274
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,916
Think of it as a
sort of repository

275
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,708
of all things past and future.

276
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,875
These are private memories.

277
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,458
What are you trying to pull,
showing me stuff like this?

278
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,208
Well it just so happens that
one of my many responsibilities

279
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,375
is to make sure the
game stays interesting.

280
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,708
Boom.

281
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,166
Hey mom.

282
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,458
Hey dad.

283
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,333
Soon I'm gonna
introduce ya to the guy

284
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,666
I intend to marry one day.

285
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,333
Akise was right.

286
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,875
She needed me
to keep her stable.

287
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,250
The one thing that's sustained
her through the hardships of her

288
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,375
life has been the idea that
one day she'll be your wife.

289
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,375
But alas, it wasn't meant to be.

290
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,000
How come?

291
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:50,000
The contest started not
long after that day in class.

292
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:53,333
As you know only one player
was decreed to survive.

293
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,125
But she was determined
to be happy at any cost.

294
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,833
All she wanted out
of you was one day

295
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,416
of untrammeled bliss
before it was all over.

296
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,958
Given that, the poor
thing was willing to

297
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,583
forfeit her life and
let you win the throne.

298
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,583
Once upon a time you
were dead set to be the victor.

299
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,250
What happened with that?

300
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,458
I got...

301
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:13,750
I don't know.

302
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,291
Then...
I promise you, here and now.

303
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:19,125
I'm gonna put it
all back the way it was.

304
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,583
Things changed, I guess.

305
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,583
I thought I could
bring everyone back.

306
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:26,750
That I had a chance
to make Yuno feel loved.

307
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,416
Pointless now, though, isn't it.

308
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,916
Always was.

309
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,041
If you ask me, seems like
if you wanted to die with her,

310
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,750
you might as well let her
kill you and be done with it.

311
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,833
But let's focus
on the topic at hand.

312
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:43,333
You need to know how the first
version of the universe ended.

313
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,083
So...

314
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,375
You mean there was one?

315
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:46,458
Of course.

316
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:47,916
I thought that
Akise fella explained

317
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,916
that to you in his dying text.

318
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,625
Pay attention you
might learn something.

319
00:17:55,333 --> 00:18:00,625
Wait, these, these are like
clips of the past but different.

320
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,208
Good eye, kid.

321
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:06,041
Those are snippets from
this timeline's first iteration.

322
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,458
Technically, the timeline you're

323
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:10,041
caught up in now
is the second iteration.

324
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,416
Mind officially blown.

325
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,041
Say hello to your incarnations
from the first universe;

326
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,541
a couple of love struck
teenagers who killed all their

327
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,583
rivals in the game and decided
to go out hand-in-hand.

328
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:37,375
No.

329
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:38,333
I don't believe it.

330
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,541
Second is about to make the

331
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,583
mistake that kicked
off this whole mess.

332
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,916
It's okay, my love
just you watch.

333
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,666
Once I'm sitting
at the throne of time,

334
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,041
not even death
will keep us apart!

335
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:15,250
Okay... aha...

336
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,708
This is the bit where she
learns the dead stay dead.

337
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,708
No exceptions.

338
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,750
Tragically, she wouldn't
discover the truth until

339
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,791
she'd already
convinced you to die.

340
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:24,750
That's not right.

341
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,375
She learned the truth from Deus.

342
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,291
Oh please.

343
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,083
That talk never happened.

344
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,458
She lied to keep
you from knowing

345
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,416
how she really
found out.

346
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,458
She knew from experience.

347
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,958
The first thing she
did when space and time

348
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,333
became hers to command was make

349
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,541
a relatively
straightforward wish.

350
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,833
"Transport me to a past
where Yuki is still alive."

351
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,375
That, as you might've guessed,
was her second mistake.

352
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,375
'cause the wish was granted.

353
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,916
This is how it has to be.

354
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,708
I'm sorry.

355
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,625
This world isn't big
enough for the two of us.

356
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,458
Paints quite a picture, huh?

357
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,458
This is the dirty little
secret your woman's

358
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,666
gone to such pains
to keep buried.

359
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,916
Oh yes!

360
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,666
You, you're telling me
that my Yuno is a

361
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,416
version of herself
from another universe?

362
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,333
That's why...

363
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:34,583
Why her DNA was a
match for the third body.

364
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,833
There were two of her.

365
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,250
So she killed the new one.

366
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:41,500
I knew she was a murderer,

367
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,750
but I never would have thought

368
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,208
she could do
something like this.

369
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,000
Yuno!
Don't die on me!

370
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,458
Please!

371
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,125
Like I said: no touchy.

372
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,375
What you're looking at is
just a replay from the past;

373
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,375
you can't interact with it.

374
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,791
This isn't happening.

375
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,166
This is the Yuno I promised
to take star-gazing;

376
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,833
the one I promised to marry
when we were old enough!

377
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:07,958
Why?

378
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:11,041
Why would you cut her down
in cold blood like this?!

379
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,291
Yuno.

380
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,666
Please don't die!

381
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:20,583
Is that, is that you?

382
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:23,000
I know that voice.

383
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,041
You're really here.

384
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,500
No way!
That's impossible!

385
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,416
H.

386
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,583
e.

387
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,083
L.

388
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,458
p.

389
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:50,833
Help me please.

390
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:55,625
I, I, will wait for you.

391
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:58,625
No.

392
00:21:58,708 --> 00:21:59,875
No.

393
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:10,666
Yuno!

394
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:36,375
♪ closing song ♪

395
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:12,625
Coming to me for relationship

396
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:14,666
advice was a smart move.

397
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,875
Old Murmur's got the menfolk
pretty much all figured out.

398
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,250
Good to know.

399
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,291
You're gonna knock him dead!

400
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:24,250
Yuno.
You in here?

401
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,666
I'm so glad you're
here, Yuki-san.

402
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,375
Don't I look sugoi?

403
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:34,041
Uh you look very "different."

404
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:37,291
I'm just gonna go now.

405
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:42,083
My bad sister.

406
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:44,625
But I really thought Yuki would
go for something like that.

407
00:24:44,708 --> 00:24:46,166
Hey, enough with
the waterworks already!

408
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,416
I have a super backup
plan up my sleeve.

409
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,875
Talk to me.

410
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:53,291
Why on earth was she
all dressed up like that?

411
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:00,000
You've been oh so naughty, Yuki.

412
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,833
Now get on all fours
like a good boy.

413
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:06,958
Wait... No, what,
what I meant to say was!

414
00:25:08,416 --> 00:25:11,250
Aw, what're you
running away for?!

415
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:12,791
I dunno, Yuno.

416
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:16,250
That S&amp;M outfit should have
sent him straight to boner city.

417
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:19,333
Maybe I should be
having this convo with Aru.

418
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:24,291
Ah, so he's a cat person, huh?

419
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:25,291
What the hell?

420
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:27,333
It's like she's
extra nuts today.

421
00:25:27,416 --> 00:25:28,958
Hey, Yuki.

422
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:31,000
Wanna pet me?
