1
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,458
Yuno!

2
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:36,541
Stick to the plan.

3
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,708
Once they all run for it, we'll
meet up on the 25th floor.

4
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,791
Right down to the letter, baby.

5
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,791
God, I'm in love with you.

6
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:43,916
Awesome.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,458
'Cause I love you, too.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You're telling me that
girl is running amok

9
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,291
downstairs with a katana?

10
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:02,458
Yes, sir but I'm afraid
we've lost track of her!

11
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,291
We're live on the
scene at City Hall

12
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,708
as the crisis
continues to worsen!

13
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,000
It would seem
that the terrorists

14
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,041
have made good on their threat

15
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,500
to take hostages
in order to leverage

16
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,708
their way into
the mayor's office.

17
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,541
They've just released their
demands to the media which we're

18
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:19,250
only broadcasting in the
name of journalistic integrity.

19
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,166
"Unless you want corpses
on your hands, you'll release

20
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,083
Kousaka Ouji, Hinata Hino
and Mao Nonosaka

21
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:26,333
and the Mayor
has to kill himself!"

22
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:29,958
Using the media to
thin out Balks's options?

23
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,541
Clever.

24
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,083
Be a dear and
retrieve our friends

25
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,541
from those guards, would you?

26
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:35,208
Yeah!

27
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:36,791
Be back in a jiffy!

28
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:42,041
It's high time I dealt with
Eleventh once and for all.

29
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:45,333
That look.

30
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,333
When did First grow a pair?

31
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:49,166
If I'm going to bring
Mom and Dad back.

32
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,083
I need to win this thing.

33
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,500
Sorry but there's
something I still got to do.

34
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:09,750
I promise, Nishijima.

35
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:12,375
You won't be the last to bleed.

36
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:18,000
♪ opening song ♪

37
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,583
We have to hurry!

38
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,000
We've only got an hour before
the cops storm the building!

39
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,416
This had better work out.

40
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,333
Don't tell me it
slipped your mind.

41
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,041
You hitting the bulls-eye.

42
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,666
Also...

43
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:09,166
Nishijima had no
business dying today!

44
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,791
You're alive right now 'cause
you're gunning for Eleventh.

45
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,958
But the second that your
little plan doesn't work.

46
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,875
I'm gonna put the
daylight through ya!

47
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,416
Looks like ya got
us cornered, Officer.

48
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,833
I surrender.

49
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,208
If we get outta this,
remind me to kick your ass!

50
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,958
When you said you could
handle this I thought

51
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,791
it meant you
actually had a plan!

52
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:41,958
Listen, up!

53
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,250
If you get the three
of us eighty-sixed,

54
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,666
it is definitely not gonna rock!

55
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,166
Yeah it will!

56
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,541
Eighties rock!

57
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,916
So what do you think
we should do with them?

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,625
The mayor made it very clear he
wanted these three disposed of.

59
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,125
Wai-wai-wait!
Hold on a sec!

60
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,416
You don't wanna shoot us,
man we're just a bunch of kids.

61
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,416
We won't blab about Holon,
so we're cool, yeah?!

62
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,500
I'd have let him go if
he hadn't said Holon.

63
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,541
Guess we got to kill them, then.

64
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,375
--Dumbass!
--Dumbass!

65
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,583
That girl just ambushed
two of our men!

66
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,458
Get her!

67
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,541
There you are!

68
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,416
Gasai Bank?

69
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,875
But...!

70
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,250
This bank breathed its
last about a year ago.

71
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,250
Ever since it went bankrupt,
it's belonged to the city.

72
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,041
I believe it was
owned by the parents

73
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:44,000
of your little chippy
in better days.

74
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,291
I'm not done with
you yet, Balks!

75
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,666
The irony is delicious.

76
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,958
This vault was a holding
of the Gasai family.

77
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,375
Now this steel will
shield me from

78
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,708
a pretender to their throne.

79
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,458
No the door's
already rolling shut!

80
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,375
We're gonna lose him!

81
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,083
Bastard!

82
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,541
"Please enter PIN code?!"

83
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,041
What is it?!

84
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:24,000
Spill your guts,
or I'll spill them for ya.

85
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,708
Why settle for a single door
when you can have two?

86
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,583
Hold up, Yuno.

87
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,625
Holon isn't down that hallway!

88
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,708
Where're you even going?!

89
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,125
Gasai Bank, huh?

90
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,583
Why aren't the keycard and pin
code working on this one?!

91
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,083
I got to hand it to ya, First.

92
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,250
You had a pretty good run.

93
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,583
What the hell are you doing?

94
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,375
Remember me saying
you were dead meat

95
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,208
the minute your
plan stopped working?

96
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,416
Wait...

97
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,291
There's got to be some
way to get it open,

98
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,208
just give me a minute!

99
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,916
Use your head!

100
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,916
We're talking
about Eleventh here.

101
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,875
That bastard doesn't
leave anything to chance.

102
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:47,875
Nishijima's the one man who ever
promised to make me happy 

103
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,708
and if he hadn't gotten
wrapped up in this shit,

104
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,291
I think he
could've pulled it off.

105
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,583
But we'll never know, will we?

106
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,583
See you in hell!

107
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:01,375
I have to put that rabid whore
down before she murders my Yuki!

108
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,916
This doesn't rock.

109
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,250
I got no idea where this nutty
chick is leading us off to!

110
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,083
Why's Akise calling?

111
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,000
Don't drag this out, First.

112
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,041
Yuno's coming for me right now.

113
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,666
All I have to do
is survive 'til then!

114
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,500
A Dead End!

115
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,291
You might as well show yourself.

116
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,750
Killing you's gonna take
the last of my strength.

117
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:36,166
I bet you I'll bleed out
before your body's even cold.

118
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,208
Your reason for wanting to
win this was bullshit, anyway.

119
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,458
If I'm going to bring
back Mom and Dad,

120
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,583
I need to win this thing.

121
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,708
I got a newsflash for ya, kid!

122
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,250
Parents die all the damn
time but what you don't see

123
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,166
is other people going on killing
sprees to bring them back.

124
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,500
You're sad 'cause you lost your
mom and dad just now, right?

125
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,583
Well cry me a river.

126
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,500
I lost my folks
in the Middle East,

127
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,416
thanks to a
sixteen-hundred-year-old fight

128
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,250
about three takes
on the same damn God.

129
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,708
I couldn't speak the language.

130
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,458
Didn't know a soul.

131
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,916
I had to steal to survive.

132
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,958
Getting caught would have
meant death or something worse.

133
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,208
Don't know why
I'm telling you this, but...

134
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,500
I've kind of got a
soft spot for you, Yuki.

135
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,875
When I think of
you running through

136
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,583
that minefield like a damn fool,

137
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,083
or getting outsmarted
by a toddler,

138
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:35,291
you remind me of how pathetic I
was back in the day when

139
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,791
I was just a little girl
and my losses were still fresh!

140
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,500
But you gotta face the facts!

141
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,333
You ain't never gonna
get them back, kid!

142
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,416
Your parents are dead!

143
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:53,208
I hit you with both
barrels, and not a peep.

144
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,750
Kudos for having the
good sense to hold it all in.

145
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,958
I need to change
the future, fast!

146
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,541
Unless you kick off a rewrite,

147
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,416
you're gonna take one to the
head in about a minute.

148
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,041
But if you do change the future,

149
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:08,375
that static sound will
give away your location.

150
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,541
She's right!

151
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,708
They hunt each
other to extinction

152
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,083
as I watch from a
fortified perch.

153
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,250
It's too easy!

154
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,250
They really outdid
themselves...

155
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,666
...outfitting the second door
with a retinal scanner.

156
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,166
And the only eyes it
will accept are mine

157
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,500
the deceased Gasai couple's.

158
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:49,125
And those of their
adopted daughter, Yuno.

159
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,916
The impostor shall not
be granted access.

160
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,666
Eighth!

161
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,458
Time to cut a whore in half!

162
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,833
That cop is Aru!

163
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,041
Get out of my way.

164
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,500
Now.

165
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:30,583
"Sorry, Yuno." "If I die, I want
you to bring Mom and Dad back."

166
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,875
Yuki's gonna die?!

167
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,291
Buckled under
the pressure, did ya?

168
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,125
Seems about par for the course.

169
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,708
No offense.

170
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,416
I think I'm gonna
miss the way you

171
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,416
squirm through life
without a spine.

172
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,625
Only his cell phone?!

173
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:01,583
I messaged Yuno
like I was about to die.

174
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,666
She panicked, just like I
figured she would,

175
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,708
causing the future to change.

176
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,541
You wanted static.

177
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,333
You little shit.

178
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,583
I know that resurrecting
my parents is selfish.

179
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,291
But I can't just
let them stay dead.

180
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,750
Why aren't you
pulling the trigger?

181
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,833
I don't want to kill you.

182
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,333
Huh?

183
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,166
Listen to me.

184
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,291
I swear on my soul I
didn't want to kill any of them.

185
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,666
But I did.

186
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,416
More than I can count.

187
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,958
This game left me
no other choice!

188
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,166
The hell it didn't!

189
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,875
Why don't you tell me, then?!

190
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:39,000
If you're so smart,
tell me what choice I had!

191
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,958
Stop being such a bitch!

192
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,750
Own your sins!

193
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,833
You murdered them because
it was better them than you!

194
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:53,583
The gun!

195
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,625
Minene! No!

196
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:01,500
It's like I told you,
better you than me!

197
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:12,000
He and I, we're the same.

198
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,166
He's just a scared
little kid crying

199
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,250
for Mommy and Daddy to get up.

200
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,500
I'm sorry.

201
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,833
Right considerate of them
to kill each other off.

202
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:43,708
I'm betting you're ready
to throw in the towel.

203
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,166
But seeing as
how you've given me

204
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,500
so much data over the
course of this fracas.

205
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:52,958
I'm going to do you the honor of
asking for your opinion, First.

206
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,625
You lost your parents,
and as one might expect,

207
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,208
you tried to avenge them.

208
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:01,125
But you failed due to your
inefficient use of your diary.

209
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,250
How very banal of you.

210
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,125
All hail the conquering zero.

211
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,000
I can't imagine
the hubris that let you

212
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,916
think you were fit
to attempt this.

213
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,583
You and your family
were nothing more than

214
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:17,125
lab rats running through
a maze of my design.

215
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,708
What did you say?!

216
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,166
I must admit, your killing
Ninth was a pleasant surprise.

217
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:27,291
Still, she was nothing more
than a bush-league anarchist.

218
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,916
I've got your "pleasant
surprise" right here, Eleventh.

219
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,291
How're you still alive?

220
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,625
I'm stubborn.

221
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,875
First is lucky that I am.

222
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,875
I've got one
hell of a bomb...

223
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,250
...and it's hooked up to a
dead-man's switch.

224
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,916
As soon as my heart gives out,
it's "pop goes the weasel" time.

225
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,041
If you think that door's
gonna save your ass,

226
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,958
you're even dumber
than most politicians

227
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,083
and that's saying something.

228
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:56,416
You're crazy!

229
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
You're gonna blow yourself up?!

230
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,000
You're a trip.

231
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,333
Shooting me is fine but now you

232
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,291
get your panties in
a wad over this?

233
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,875
Then again it's not
like I've been operating

234
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,416
under the most logical
rules of engagement lately.

235
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,375
So I'll take care of
the open sesame part.

236
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,750
But whatever goes down
after that is on your head.

237
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,916
So own it.

238
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:40,500
If I break my diary, the bomb'll
go off as soon as I flat-line.

239
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,291
Been a while, huh.

240
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:58,291
I finally did that thing you
always wanted done.

241
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,666
I hope you're happy.

242
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:05,000
This is where we
go our separate ways.

243
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,000
Now you understand.

244
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:24,000
Yeah, I guess I do.

245
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:29,125
I just wanted
someone to save me.

246
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,125
After all I've lost.

247
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,583
I got my humanity back.

248
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,833
Nishijima.

249
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,666
Not even a scratch?!

250
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,375
What've we here?

251
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:04,708
Ninth blows herself to hell,
yet the door is standing firm!

252
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,291
Shut your mouth!

253
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,291
Yuki!

254
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:13,916
She's dead.

255
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,708
She sacrificed herself
to give me a shot at him.

256
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,333
But it didn't work!

257
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,916
It's okay.

258
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,833
We just have to get over to the
South Tower and destroy Ho-lon.

259
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,625
If we do that, Ninth's death
won't have been for nothing.

260
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,041
Right?

261
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,291
Yeah.

262
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,166
I guess you're right.

263
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,125
I'll keep an eye on Eleventh,
so you go on ahead.

264
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,875
Thanks.

265
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,500
Such a tantrum won't affect

266
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,791
my plans in the slightest,
so have at it.

267
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,166
Your best, eh?

268
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,083
I must be seeing things.

269
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,875
She couldn't have
gotten inside the vault!

270
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,916
Yuno killed Eleventh
as soon as I was gone?!

271
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:37,333
Why would he let her in?

272
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,000
Huh?

273
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,625
Oh...
Hey, Yuki.

274
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:00,791
Good morning.

275
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,833
I thought you were
gonna sleep downstairs!

276
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,791
Whatever!

277
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,291
Just put some clothes on ASAP!

278
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,791
Okay!

279
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,833
All right.

280
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,125
Eighth is the
only keeper left to kill.

281
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,291
And from the looks of it,

282
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:18,250
Aru might just hand
her right off to me.

283
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,833
I'm in the home stretch.

284
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,583
Honestly, I've got
half a mind to march

285
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,625
you up to his doorstep
and ring the bell.

286
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:32,250
I think that Yuki's the best
candidate for godhead by far.

287
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,125
What's the other
half of your mind say?

288
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,958
There's the rub.

289
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,666
Identity confirmed.

290
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,708
Lock Disengaged.

291
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,458
Yuno Gasai does
not inspire trust in me.

292
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,416
Yuki's motive for wanting
to win this game is pure.

293
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,000
He wants to revive his parents

294
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,291
and undo the events
of this bloodbath.

295
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,291
Yuno, on the other
hand, remains such an

296
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:02,500
enigma that we don't
even know her real identity.

297
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,416
I wonder.

298
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:10,333
Sorry, but I need
to ask a favor of you.

299
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:17,500
Sweet pea.

300
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,958
What're you writing in there?

301
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,875
Oh...

302
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,958
It's all the people I've gotten
killed over the course of this.

303
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,458
As soon as I win, I'm
gonna bring them all back.

304
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:28,208
Take a sec and think
about how far you've come.

305
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,333
Once, there were twelve of us.

306
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:33,708
Now, all that's left to
do is put a bullet in Eighth.

307
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,000
And one in yours truly.

308
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,875
Yuno.

309
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,333
If you're going to bring your
mom and dad back from the dead,

310
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:44,333
you can't afford
to get all sentimental.

311
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,291
Besides, I'll be alive again.

312
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,666
'Cause you're gonna undo
everything else, remember?

313
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,708
Yuki, look!

314
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,041
What is this phenomenon?!

315
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,500
The fabric of reality
is starting to tear!

316
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,208
But why is it happening to the

317
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,333
whole city instead
of a dead user?

318
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,708
Why now?!

319
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,875
I don't wanna be the
voice of doom,

320
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,916
but you know Deus's
time is almost up.

321
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,666
If he doesn't pick a successor

322
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,416
before he crumbles
into oblivion,

323
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,625
his death is gonna take
the whole world with him.

324
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,500
But you can save it.

325
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,875
Then I promise you,
here and now...

326
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,583
I'm gonna put it all
back the way it was.

327
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:36,833
And I promise I'll
make you happy.

328
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,166
Well isn't this funky.

329
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,875
He's not supposed to
kick the Deus-bucket

330
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,750
for a little bit longer.

331
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:46,000
Did the Big Guy forget to
carry the one or something?

332
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,916
Not to be a diva,
but the global kaput

333
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,583
is set for a hard date
of July 28th.

334
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,166
He's gotta soldier
on until then.

335
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,916
You like surprises, Murmur?

336
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:57,625
What the hell?

337
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,750
Don't you keepers ever knock?!

338
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,916
Aru Akise?!

339
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,083
And we've stepped
through the looking glass.

340
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:08,166
Does this mean I've been
granted an audience with Deus?

341
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:12,083
So sorry, but this
chamber is invitation-only!

342
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,583
Murmur from the top rope!

343
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,375
Deus, right?

344
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:19,833
Thank you sir for the
divine intervention.

345
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:21,875
I'll cut right to the chase.

346
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:23,583
If Yuki becomes god,

347
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:27,125
can he really undo
everything that's happened?

348
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:36,250
♪ closing song ♪

349
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:11,291
"Future Diaries," huh?

350
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:12,958
It is pretty catchy.

351
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:14,791
What did you expect?

352
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:17,000
I hope you don't take offense,
Mr. Mayor, but how come

353
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:19,666
your diary is the only
one that has a weird name?

354
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,291
What are you talking about?

355
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:24,125
Well, you've got
First's Indiscriminate Diary,

356
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:25,666
the Diary of Future Love,

357
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,958
the Murder Diary, the Case
Diary, the Clairvoyant Diary and

358
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:31,666
Exchange Diaries,
the Propagation Diary,

359
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:36,416
the Escape Diary, the Breeder's
Diary and the Justice Diary.

360
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:39,291
And then there is yours.

361
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:41,875
The mighty Peeper.

362
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:43,083
Dude, really?

363
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:44,208
"The Peeper?!"

364
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:46,166
My diary's not The Peeper.

365
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:46,916
Watcher.

366
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,625
Its name is The Watcher.

367
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:49,791
My mistake.

368
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:51,333
I don't know how
I got those two mixed up.

369
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:54,125
I notice you didn't mention
Fifth's Hyper Vision Diary,

370
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:57,541
the name of which is worlds
clunkier than The Peeper!

371
00:24:57,625 --> 00:24:58,750
Now we're gonna field some

372
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:00,458
e-mails from your
loyal subjects!

373
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,166
Let's see what folks
have to say about ya!

374
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,291
If they're complaining,
just delete them.

375
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:05,875
Here's our first message.

376
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:09,458
Sent in by "I'm Pretty Kick-Ass
and Everybody Knows It."

377
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,416
"Your Peeper diary
is a little too pervy

378
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,958
for an elected official, man.

379
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:14,708
Let's call it the
'Full Head O' Hair Diary,'

380
00:25:14,791 --> 00:25:16,250
and no one will know it's yours!

381
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:17,833
Oh snap!"

382
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:22,375
And the survey says no.

383
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:23,791
Our next one was
sent in by someone

384
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:26,166
calling herself "Gimme
Back My Fake Arm."

385
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,583
"Hey Mayor.

386
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:29,250
'The Peeper' makes me
thinks it's made of eyeballs.

387
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:31,416
How about 'The Creeper'
for the name of your diary?

388
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,541
It basically means
the same thing, so yeah."

389
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:36,166
Verdict?

390
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,041
Zero for two.

391
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:40,166
Next up, a helpful
suggestion from someone

392
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:43,541
going by the name
"I Dream of Hinata's Boobies".

393
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,958
"Mr. Mayor,

394
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:46,416
how about you call your
diary the 'I'm Always Watching

395
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,541
You Because I'm a Weird Old
Man With a Funky Hat

396
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:50,458
and Delusions of
Grandeur' diary?

397
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:52,666
That sums it up pretty well."

398
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,958
Sorry, "Boobies"
don't hold your breath.

399
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:57,875
You know what?

400
00:25:57,958 --> 00:25:59,625
Now that I think about it, maybe
we're gilding the lily here.

401
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:01,250
'The Peeper' is just fine.

402
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:04,208
It's The Watcher,
you little maniac!
