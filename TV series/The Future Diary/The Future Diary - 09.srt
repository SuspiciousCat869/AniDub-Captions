1
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,625
I won't deny it.

2
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,583
I am in fact, the serial killer.

3
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,333
It's quite simple, my dear,

4
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:43,958
I'm compelled to
eliminate suspected

5
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:47,458
Diary Users before they
turn the tables on me.

6
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:50,125
I spare no thought
for the lives I've taken.

7
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,416
I do, however, regret
allowing my obsession

8
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,083
to take me from you
and your mother.

9
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,541
Dad, I...

10
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,625
My entire purpose
for assuming the

11
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:02,708
Throne of Time was the
vain hope of restitution.

12
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:03,875
For us.

13
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,750
There's no reason
we can't make it work!

14
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,125
Look, I'm here for you, okay?

15
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,583
Whatever it takes, I'm all in!

16
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:18,375
The shadows lengthen
for me, I fear.

17
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,333
That weirdo?

18
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,208
His unrelenting
knack for spying on me

19
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,166
would suggest he has a Diary.

20
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,000
He's nothing...
You can't be serious.

21
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:33,958
Much as I long for us to start
anew, the boy is an obstacle.

22
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:44,541
What if I could do
something about that?

23
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,333
Give me what I want,
and we're cool.

24
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:54,291
And don't try to
play innocent, freak.

25
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:55,875
I'm on to you.

26
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:58,750
Are you telling me
Akise is a Diary User?

27
00:01:58,833 --> 00:01:59,833
Duh.

28
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:01,083
No...
You know what?

29
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,958
I staged my own grisly
death so the pack of us

30
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:05,250
could come out of this
thing a little bit closer.

31
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,833
Fact is, his diary's
got a blind spot

32
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:10,125
when it comes to
the dearly departed.

33
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:13,500
So, this was all just a ploy
to get the drop on Akise?

34
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,416
Sorry, pumpkin you
were the perfect bait.

35
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,000
He's been on to you for weeks.

36
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,708
Come on, you can't blame a girl
for stacking up her advantages.

37
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,250
Don't be like that.

38
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,791
You barely know me.

39
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,750
Bad enough you had to chuck
a monkey wrench into my plan.

40
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,250
You used me.

41
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,166
Fine...

42
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,875
You want it, you can have it.

43
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:33,416
But please...

44
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,416
...just indulge me for a second.

45
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,416
Guess which hand.

46
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:48,791
♪ opening song ♪

47
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,583
So, I have my diary
and you have Amano's.

48
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:23,416
Which is good.

49
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,583
Level playing field.

50
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:25,916
I like that.

51
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,666
I propose we wager our
respective holdings in a

52
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,583
friendly little gamble,
if you're feeling lucky that is.

53
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,375
As if luck has
anything to do with it

54
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,208
when I can tell
the frigging future.

55
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,625
Really didn't think that one

56
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,083
through too carefully,
did you, Sherlock?

57
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,958
You think it'll be
simple as all that?

58
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,375
You're hardly the
only one here for

59
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,250
whom the future
makes itself known.

60
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,291
Why is this nutcase so damn
cocky all of a sudden?

61
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,958
Hinata...
Take him up on it.

62
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,208
He's just trying
to psych you out

63
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,708
cause he knows
Amano's diary is better.

64
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,083
Alright then.

65
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,625
Easy-peesy.

66
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:58,833
You're on!

67
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,291
Bring it!

68
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,333
First a warm-up toss.

69
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,833
Would you be so kind
as to do the honors?

70
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,958
According to this, the coin
will be in the right hand.

71
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,291
Cinch.

72
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,291
Okay, whatever
this is, I'm not a fan.

73
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,583
It'll be in her right hand.
Got it?

74
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:33,000
Kay! Which hand's
holding the glory?

75
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,041
Nice try, emo.

76
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,708
Next time, try not
to be so obvious

77
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,125
when giving your
pals the signal.

78
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,958
It's actually in my
left hand, so suck it.

79
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,708
Hate the game, not the player.

80
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,250
Oh, it's no big deal.

81
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,250
My diary's a bit
of stickler for details.

82
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,708
It's in your left.

83
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,416
Read them and weep.

84
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,125
Wait.

85
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,708
What?

86
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,291
How the hell did you?

87
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,833
I... you...

88
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,833
Is that really a Diary,
or is this guy just bluffing?

89
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,000
This... This is total b.s.!

90
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,791
Hold on...
There's more?

91
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,083
I don't like this one damn bit.

92
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,083
Okeydokey.

93
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,041
That'll do for a prelim,
I believe.

94
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,125
Let's play for keeps.
Eh?

95
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,500
I don't get it.

96
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,833
I mean, shouldn't Amano's
diary be able to predict

97
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,458
whatever is written
in Akise's diary?

98
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,000
Shut up!

99
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,250
Where oh where has
my little coin gone?

100
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,958
I have to get this!

101
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,791
It's in your right.

102
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,750
No points this round.

103
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,250
This guy's good!

104
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,708
Them's the breaks, chickadee.

105
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:09,791
Hand it over.

106
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,208
To hell with that!

107
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,625
How about I hand
over the kid instead?

108
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,541
You got a problem with that?

109
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,083
I agreed to your stupid game,

110
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,666
no reason it's got to
end after one round.

111
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,375
Amazing.

112
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,916
Dude, you're like a total boss!

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,916
We could play as
many rounds as she wants!

114
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,500
Bizarre...

115
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:34,291
His phone didn't make a noise
when the future got rewritten.

116
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,375
Something's not right.

117
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,875
Right.
Moving on, shall we?

118
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,666
First you have to
agree that if I win,

119
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,791
that makes this the
final round, yes?

120
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,375
No point dragging--

121
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,500
Sorry for all the fuss;

122
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,041
but I forgot to ask
you something important.

123
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,166
Who are you?

124
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,666
Which number?

125
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,291
What?!

126
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,958
Yuno, lay off him, he's
trying to get my diary back!

127
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,291
Sorry, my love.

128
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,583
You have to think
long term to survive.

129
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,958
Well, just look at
what we have here.

130
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:11,625
There's not a single
entry in this damn thing.

131
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,041
Excuse me?!

132
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,333
What's your game?

133
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,375
You're not a diary user.

134
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,333
He's been faking us
out the whole time?

135
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,333
Yeah, I may have lied a little.

136
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,750
Everyone was so adamant
about my having a diary,

137
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,416
I just kind of got caught up in
the spirit of things, you know?

138
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,666
It was infectious.

139
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,083
But... You won the
game twice in a row.

140
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,500
Sheer luck, my friend.

141
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,708
Good news for us, though:
it made Hinata doubt your

142
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,125
diary long enough to
turn the tide in our favor.

143
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,750
That's what this
was about, right?

144
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,250
Why'd you have to
go and spoil our lead?

145
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:48,833
You make it sound as though you

146
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,541
risked Yuki's life to
test a hypothesis.

147
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,916
Game over!

148
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,916
Sorry...

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,916
There's some life
in the game yet, I fancy.

150
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,583
Hinata wants me
dead cause I know

151
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,208
daddy dearest's
dirty little secret.

152
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,500
So I have what you might
call an honest incentive

153
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,333
to keep vying for Yuki's diary.

154
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,458
Now let's start playing
and be done with it.

155
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,583
Okay?

156
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:11,916
This is insane.

157
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,416
Think, man. You can't
get the better of someone

158
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,541
who can actually
tell the future!

159
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,083
If it's all the same to
you, sweet cheeks.

160
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,791
I'll decide myself.

161
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,166
You're crazy.

162
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,916
Even if he had a chance
in hell against my diary,

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,625
they're on to his trick now.

164
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,375
The whole thing's pointless.

165
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,416
Let's do it.

166
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,541
I'm curious to
see what you've got.

167
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,208
Goes without saying the stakes
are different now, though.

168
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,333
You win, you get Amano's diary.

169
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,750
I win, you become chew toys.

170
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:38,666
Hey, Hinata.

171
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,041
What?

172
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,083
Promise me something
before we do this again.

173
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,708
If we win,
promise me you'll, uh...

174
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,625
Well, I'd like us to still
be friends if that's okay.

175
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,958
Whatever.

176
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,250
And 'cause you're such a doofus,
I'll let you live regardless.

177
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,000
Are you out of
your mind, Hinata?!

178
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,208
The whole point was to keep

179
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,125
the skeletons in your
closet locked up!

180
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,250
Come on... You knew as well as
me this was a long shot.

181
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,208
Matter of fact,
you should leave.

182
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,541
Don't get me wrong:
I've been glad for the help.

183
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,791
It's just, I shouldn't have
gotten you into this mess.

184
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,041
Please forgive me.

185
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,041
Listen to him.

186
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,208
One doesn't expect to outwit

187
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,625
the Indiscriminate
Diary forever.

188
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,708
You're gambling
with my man's life.

189
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,666
I'm not okay with that.

190
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,458
And just so you know...

191
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,791
I don't trust you as far
as I could pummel you.

192
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,916
Well, just so you know, I'm
not in this to be an altruist.

193
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:33,916
Your man's a hottie.

194
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,333
--Hold on just a minute!
--Let's get this over with.

195
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:36,625
Ready when you are.

196
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,916
I'll make this fast.

197
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,375
Watch carefully!

198
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,208
Right hand or left?

199
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,916
This time I'm going to win.

200
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The coin's in my right hand,

201
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,166
but he'll guess
wrong I know he will!

202
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,791
He has to!

203
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:53,791
Sweet pea...?

204
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,208
Mind if try
something real quick?

205
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,833
Okay.

206
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,541
Definitely...

207
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,750
...the right!

208
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,041
That son of a bitch!

209
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,833
How'd he know?!

210
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,291
Um... Sorry, Yuki...
I got it wrong.

211
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,500
Afraid we're
basically up a creek.

212
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,625
But... You... I... We...

213
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,083
What the hell are
we supposed to do now?!

214
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:21,916
Alrighty, then.

215
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,333
Now that Yuki's
sufficiently in the dark,

216
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,125
we can continue our little
back and forth.

217
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,625
I don't get it.

218
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,458
What's he stand to gain by
making him think they've lost?

219
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,500
Oh, crap!
Of course!

220
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,125
Wise to the ruse yet?

221
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,833
His diary reflects what
he thinks happened.

222
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,416
Yup.

223
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,250
An entry's only as reliable as
the perception it's based on.

224
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,416
You made him a false prophet.

225
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,083
Well, as long as
we're pointing fingers,

226
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,500
I'd like to remind everyone
that your little hoax out there

227
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,833
in the woods twisted his
perception of the future first.

228
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,750
So, I'm hardly the only
person in this room to

229
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:56,333
make him call into question
his phone's knack for accuracy.

230
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,875
You clever bastard.

231
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,375
I actually planned
on telling him I'd

232
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,916
lost this round whether
I guessed wrong or not.

233
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,791
Either way,
the point was to inhibit his

234
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,708
ability to truly
know what came next.

235
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,291
Okay, you lost me
with that last part.

236
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,458
How would that
have helped you win?

237
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,541
There was no guarantee I'd win.

238
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,500
But, hey, fifty-fifty
odds are pretty good,

239
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:19,833
all things considered.

240
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,541
I took a gamble and it paid off.

241
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,250
Plain and simple.

242
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:27,625
You lose, my dear. Sorry.

243
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,125
Mao?

244
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,250
No...

245
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,958
You get away from her!!!

246
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,375
You people...

247
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,208
It's not enough my dad's
on the chopping block.

248
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,375
Now you've got to take away

249
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:17,333
my only friend in
the entire world?!

250
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,875
I... I'm sorry.

251
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,291
Come on.

252
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:24,541
Now's not the time to let her
play on your sympathies.

253
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,083
Oh Mao...

254
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,958
Don't worry.

255
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,416
It's gonna be okay.

256
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,875
I stopped the bleeding before
you lost too much blood.

257
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,125
Alpha One!

258
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,500
Resume the hunt!

259
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,750
Rip them all to shreds!

260
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:12,041
All pack leaders follow Alpha
One's example and show no mercy!

261
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,833
I want every dog on their ass!

262
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,500
Oh crap.

263
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,375
Do you hear that?

264
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,250
We're all going to get eaten!

265
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,166
Why did this have to happen?

266
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,666
This isn't what I wanted.

267
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,166
This isn't my future!

268
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,291
Transfer ownership?

269
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,541
Yeah, Tenth tried
to reassign his diary,

270
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,500
but Deus put the kibosh on it.

271
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,500
Said the game would
be chaos if players could

272
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,083
bow out whenever they
felt the net closing in.

273
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:45,333
Are you sure that was Tenth's
only reason for asking?

274
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,666
He strikes me as the type
of man who loses all

275
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,250
sense of propriety when his
back's against the wall.

276
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,000
I suspect he's not
above entangling

277
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,458
innocent people in
his bid for survival.

278
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,666
He's a psychopath.

279
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:02,583
What are you doing?

280
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:03,791
You go on without me.

281
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,166
There's no way in hell
we're gonna outrun a

282
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,875
pack of dogs and you know it.

283
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,208
I'm going to stay behind.

284
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,250
See if I can't get
Hinata to call them off.

285
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,791
Darling, no.

286
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,291
Best be on your way.

287
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,500
Instead of taking the whole
problem on by yourself,

288
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,666
though, how 'bout the three
of us distract the pack?

289
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,833
We'll lead the hellhounds on a

290
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,250
wild goose chase
though the park;

291
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,541
you reach Hinata without
teeth marks on your ass.

292
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:24,750
Nuh-uh!

293
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,291
You don't just volunteer
me for that b.s.!

294
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,500
I'm sorry you have
something better to do?

295
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,833
Are you at least with me, Yuno?

296
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,375
It is a good plan.

297
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,500
Then let's make it happen.

298
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,208
Huh? What? Hey!

299
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,375
What are you doing?

300
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,916
Following me wasn't
part of the deal!

301
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,166
You've got to think long term.

302
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,208
We can use them as
our opportunity to get out

303
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,333
of this without being eaten
alive by those dogs!

304
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,833
You know...

305
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,375
If we use them as decoys,
we stand a pretty

306
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,416
good chance of
getting out of here.

307
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,833
We're not using them!

308
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,333
If I can get to Hinata,
we'll all be out of harm's way!

309
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,833
What makes you think you
can talk sense into her, huh?

310
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,208
You only just met her today!

311
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,750
And she played you!

312
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,041
I know, it's just...

313
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,500
Don't take this the wrong way,

314
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,916
but this is a bone-headed
idea from start to finish!

315
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,333
I know what this is about:

316
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:12,500
you're trying to make
friends and it's not worth it!

317
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,125
I'm not going to do it!

318
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,166
I'm not going to go back
to being the outsider!

319
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,208
Idiot!

320
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,750
You're too sentimental!

321
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,791
Whatever you're about to do,
please give it a second thought!

322
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,000
How many times
do I have to tell you,

323
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,750
sweetheart the only
friend you need is me.

324
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,125
You just want me to be alone.

325
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:45,208
You can't stand the thought of
anyone else being in my life.

326
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,333
Why?

327
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,541
Yeah, great idea: nothing to it!

328
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,125
And they've got backup.

329
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,458
Awesome.

330
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,666
Hey, if we get out of
this with our lives we'll

331
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,750
have Yuki to thank for it...

332
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,333
'less of course
he drops the ball.

333
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,916
Great...

334
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,541
They've lost track of
Amano and the psycho.

335
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,958
I didn't mean for things
to turn out this way, Mao.

336
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,791
I'm sorry.

337
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,750
But I'm not ready
to go home Mommy!

338
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,125
There's a ton of
rides we haven't

339
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,583
gone on and it's still daylight!

340
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,125
Don't throw a fit, dear.

341
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,625
This place is close
enough that we can

342
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,500
come back whenever
you'd like to, alright?

343
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,125
Try to think of your
father once in a while?

344
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,708
I've seen quite enough.

345
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,583
Let's go home.

346
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,208
Promise me that
if you win, you'll...

347
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:47,083
Well, that the two of
us can still be friends.

348
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,916
There's no point trying
to be my friend, Yuki.

349
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,500
Trust me.

350
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,458
Oh god.

351
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:59,583
Please someone come
and pull me out of this!

352
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,250
You're really gonna
go through with it?

353
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,125
I still say the best
course of action is to

354
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,041
leave them all to
rot and run like hell.

355
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,291
Not happening.

356
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,958
Oh, pookie.

357
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,333
Don't even!

358
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:11,458
Darling?

359
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,791
There's no good
reason I can't do this!

360
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,791
When the smoke clears,
we'll all be friends!

361
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,000
Oh shit.

362
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,833
Alpha One, come!

363
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,458
Calling Alpha Two and Three.

364
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,916
Call them off or
I slit your throat.

365
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,458
Alpha One stand down...
I Repeat, stand down!

366
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,416
Now hand over the diary.

367
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:39,541
No, please!

368
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:40,791
You wanna die, bitch?!

369
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,250
Let go of me!

370
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,583
Yuno, stop!

371
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,083
She's the enemy.

372
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,041
All we need is the diary; you
don't have to take it this far.

373
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,458
She tried to kill you!

374
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,250
At the very least she deserves
a knife to the jugular!

375
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,333
She surrendered;
stop adding insult to injury!

376
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:56,583
Come on...

377
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,958
You and I both know what
this is about, don't we?

378
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,916
You want me alone.

379
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,791
Course I do...

380
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,666
Think about it: where
would I be if you got to

381
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,500
know this girl and
fell in love with her?

382
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,375
Life, just wouldn't
be worth living if I

383
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,583
can't be the center
of your whole world.

384
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,333
Whore's got to go.

385
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:13,833
You hear me?

386
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:17,125
Same applies to anyone who
tries to shoulder in on my Yuki!

387
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,583
All of you have
been trying to drive a

388
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,000
wedge between us
from the very beginning!

389
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,000
Now I get it.

390
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,708
You understand,
don't you, my love?

391
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,625
I'm all the friend
you'll ever need.

392
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,041
Right?

393
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,500
Enough!

394
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,708
You have never been my friend.

395
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,833
Don't say that!

396
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,000
Damn it let me finish!

397
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,666
You're not my friend, Yuno.

398
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,916
I'm sorry.

399
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:42,166
Hinata.

400
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:43,916
Akise.

401
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,750
Kousaka.

402
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,291
Yeah, that's my name.

403
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,708
I would like to introduce you
all to someone very special.

404
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,958
This is Yuno Gasai.

405
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,333
My, uh, girlfriend.

406
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,000
Yuki.

407
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,916
You just called me your
girlfriend didn't you?

408
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,500
Don't spoil the moment;
I'm trying to be a

409
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,708
gentleman here and
introduce you to the gang.

410
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,041
I've waited long
enough as it is.

411
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,333
He's brilliant.

412
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:13,250
Wow, they already act
like a married couple.

413
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:16,500
You've got more guts in you
than I would have thought emo.

414
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,041
Nothing like taking
one for the team, huh?

415
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,416
Listen, Yuno...

416
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,958
July 28th.

417
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,083
That's when we live
happily ever after, right?

418
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,125
Try not to over-think it.

419
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,583
Look at them.

420
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,291
All I ask is that you accept
these people as my friends.

421
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,458
You can start by
apologizing to Mao.

422
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:36,708
Come on, you don't
want to be one of

423
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,333
those girlfriends
everybody hates, do you?

424
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,000
Read me?

425
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,583
Yeah?

426
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,291
I do.

427
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,166
Now what?

428
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,500
What the hell have
I gotten myself into?

429
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,958
I don't understand;
why'd you do it?

430
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,708
I'd have killed you
given the opportunity.

431
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,166
It wasn't your fault.

432
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,375
It was circumstance.
That's all.

433
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,500
I dropped the ball, dad.

434
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,166
Guess you've been right
about me from day one.

435
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,250
The boy's right, my dear.

436
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,916
It wasn't your fault.

437
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,125
I set you on the wrong trail.

438
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,000
Yeah, but...

439
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,833
It's over, Hinata.

440
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,958
Don't talk like that!
Please!i

441
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,083
There's still a chance you can

442
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,583
win that throne and
reboot the family!

443
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,125
And why would I want to do that?

444
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:32,083
Don't you know a bald-faced
lie when you hear one, girl?

445
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,500
I swear, an inbred beagle
has more sense that you!

446
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:36,416
Dad.

447
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,875
Don't.

448
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,666
The most you'll ever
get out of dear old dad

449
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,500
is a negative example.

450
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,333
But that's...

451
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,916
I've got an ambulance
on the way, so...

452
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,500
Us, one,
Collateral Damage, zero.

453
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,458
Because my Yuki
followed his instincts.

454
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:54,375
No question.

455
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:55,750
I am a little surprised that you

456
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,625
came out of this
unscathed, though.

457
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,166
Anyone else's instincts
probably would've led them

458
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,750
to dispose of the loose cannon
rather than try to appease it.

459
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,250
Beware...

460
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:09,500
Those who seem kindest

461
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,916
are often the most
insidiously cruel.

462
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,083
Few people, if any,
can be trusted to the end.

463
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,833
Don't you agree?

464
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,083
Fourth?

So this is where Karyudo
Tsukishima calls home.

468
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:16,166
They say his dogs
eat like kings,

469
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,875
and Murmur wants in
on that gravy train!

470
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:35,208
And now, my dogs shall
feast like the princes they are!

471
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:42,875
Your dinner awaits!

472
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:44,208
But first!

473
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:45,208
Roll-call!

Pop quiz.

00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:52,000
What's the top
of a house called?

479
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:52,500
Roof!

The roof!

481
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,958
Roof!

482
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:56,750
Question number two.

483
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:58,583
If something
is difficult, it is...!

484
00:24:58,666 --> 00:24:59,250
Ruff!

485
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:00,250
That would be Ruff!

486
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:01,291
Ruff!

487
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:02,666
Two down!

488
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,666
Question three!

489
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,708
What is this called?!

490
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:05,375
Bowl!

491
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:06,375
A bowl!

492
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:08,791
We have an
interloper in our midst!

493
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:12,958
So, my boss Deus
has decided that you're

494
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:15,000
gonna be one of his
twelve diary keepers.

495
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:16,541
Pretty cool, huh?

496
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:20,166
You're still wearing that?
