1
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:31,875
Seriously?!

2
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:34,000
This has got to be like
the fortieth text.

3
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:35,791
And who the hell
gave her my number?!

4
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,583
It sure wasn't me!

5
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,791
Face it, I've got
a bona fide stalker.

6
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,750
Question is, why?

7
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:45,875
Well, it wouldn't be much use
to me if it couldn't keep up.

8
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:47,375
I get the relevant
details on your

9
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:49,083
future in ten-minute intervals.

10
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,291
The Diary of Future Love.

11
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:52,875
Ten minute intervals.

12
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:54,458
Which means she knows
exactly what I'm up

13
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,625
to pretty much all the time.

14
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,541
Hey, sweetie.

15
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:09,000
♪ opening song ♪

16
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,375
So here's the breakdown.

17
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,250
I've got a diary that lays
out everything I'm going

18
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,166
to take note of before
I experience it.

19
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,625
But I'm just one of twelve
people with a similar way of

20
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,583
sneaking peaks at the future;

21
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,166
all trying to pick
each other off,

22
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,500
because the last man
standing gets to be a god.

23
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:04,500
Evidently the guy they call
Third drew the short straw.

24
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,500
Did I really kill someone?

25
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,083
Mr. Hiyama is, uh, out sick
today, so I'll be filling

26
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,916
in for him as best I can
if you'll bear with me.

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,583
Guess we'll start
with a headcount.

28
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:21,875
Please say "here"
when I call your name.

29
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,625
What am I supposed
to do with this thing?

30
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,625
Just having it makes
me a marked man.

31
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,958
And it's not exactly like
I can ask anyone for help.

32
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:35,875
No, no, no.

33
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:39,541
It's tempting, sure,
but she's stalking you.

34
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:44,875
First things first,
you might say.

35
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,250
Well put.

36
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,125
Excuse me.

37
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:01,625
Can we, like, uh.

38
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,916
Talk for sec?

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,916
Right now really
isn't the best time.

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,791
I'm gonna be late for P.E.

41
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,875
Just hit me up
later on today, alright?

42
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,791
Try to wait it out.

43
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:18,708
Okay.

44
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,708
Suppose that's
the best I can hope for.

45
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,208
Sorry. Can you
maybe help me?

46
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,125
I'm trying to
find the faculty lounge.

47
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,750
Any idea if I'm getting warmer?

48
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:31,083
I figure somebody there should
have some answers about Hiyama.

49
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,625
Uh.

50
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,208
What's her story?

51
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,500
Guy's your homeroom
teacher, right?

52
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:40,375
Hey... did you know he also
happened to be a killer?

53
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,250
Okay, I'm gonna run on ahead.

54
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:48,083
Sure.
See you 'round.

55
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,625
Word is your grades are up.

56
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,375
And if a gal asks around,
seems most of your classmates

57
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,583
think you've been acting kind
of uppity the past few days.

58
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,208
Don't you think
Hiyama's absence

59
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,125
is a little on the
suspicious side?

60
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:03,541
I mean, after all,
the killer died yesterday.

61
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,500
His Murder Diary didn't amount
to much at the moment of truth.

62
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:09,625
He was in the process of hunting
First when he got upstaged.

63
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,041
In case you're having
trouble following me,

64
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,750
the guy shaping your
mind was Third.

65
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,208
No way!

66
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,208
Sweet phone you got.

67
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,375
I was dead-on.

68
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,958
You're First, aren't you?

69
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,458
Pleased to make
your acquaintance!!!

70
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,500
Dead end?!

71
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:36,916
No!

72
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,833
Too late.

73
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,041
The name's Uryuu Minene, kiddos.

74
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,416
Alias Ninth.

75
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,666
And if Third was the appetizer,
I'm the main course!

76
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,541
Au revoir!

77
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,125
I'm gonna die.

78
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,333
It says Dead End in three hours.

79
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,125
Hey.

80
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,750
We're gonna survive this.

81
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:18,958
She's not gonna get you
because I'm gonna get her.

82
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,791
How can she talk
about taking a life like

83
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,083
it's some random errand?

84
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,041
I've got your back.

85
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,250
That's what I do.

86
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,166
So you keep telling me.

87
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:34,916
Well I need somebody
to, least for now.

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,583
She may not be stable but
she's better than nothing.

89
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,875
Yuno, I...

90
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,291
I need you to get
me through this.

91
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:46,875
Hey.

92
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,166
For you, sweetheart.

93
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,916
Anything.

94
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,208
I'm not using her.

95
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,041
I'm utilizing.

96
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:01,750
Attention all you grub-pawed,
snot-nosed little tadpoles.

97
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,750
This soviet bloc eyesore of
a pen they keep you bricked up

98
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,666
in till you're
hormones burn out?

99
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,875
It's been rigged.

100
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,041
We're talking
demolitions-grade explosives

101
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,166
decked out with motion sensors.

102
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:15,208
'Less you wanna blow up,
stay where you are.

103
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,041
That's right boys and girls.

104
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:21,458
The whole student body
is now my hostage!

105
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,458
We better keep moving, huh?

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,041
I'll protect you whatever
the cost, my love.

107
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,041
Whatever the cost.

108
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,916
Looks like everybody's holed
up in the other building.

109
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,166
They know she's serious.

110
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:49,666
Oh crap...!

111
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,916
The stairs are gonna
blow out underneath us!

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,666
Then we find another route.

113
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,291
No need to make
this complicated.

114
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,250
My diary just rewrote itself.

115
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,833
Well, yeah.

116
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,416
We didn't do what it said,
so the future changed.

117
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,208
This is why your diary in
particular is so useful...

118
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,750
...you jot down everything.

119
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,083
It's called the Indiscriminate
Diary because you basically

120
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,958
keep a record of
whatever you see.

121
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,625
So, that means?

122
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,500
It means what we
should be doing now is

123
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:21,000
monitoring Ninth's
activity with it.

124
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:25,000
Now it's rewriting itself when
I didn't even do anything!

125
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,875
She's making a play.

126
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,333
Our movements
are interlocked now.

127
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,875
If her future changes,
so does ours.

128
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:36,416
Apparently a bomb is about
to go off in classroom 2C.

129
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,833
Look out!!!

130
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,708
Quick! Read the next entry!

131
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,708
Looks like it says.

132
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,458
There's another
explosion down the hall!

133
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,625
I'm not going to lie.

134
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,125
Yuno is really good at this.

135
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,625
And, the future
branches off yet again.

136
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,708
Got you running
in circles, pipsqueak?

137
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,541
I have officially made a
very good life choice today.

138
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,250
This is a breeze!

139
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,000
Or not?

140
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,041
Kay. What's it say now?

141
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:33,750
Huh?

142
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:34,958
Oh.

143
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,291
Oh no!
Are you alright?!

144
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,166
Ow.

145
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:43,916
Yeah.

146
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,541
I think so.

147
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:46,791
New tactic.

148
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,208
If it's at all possible.

149
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:51,166
Focus on how it says you
react to the explosions.

150
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,583
Like, what they do to me?

151
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,500
What is it?
What's the matter?

152
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,833
It's just I...

153
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,458
I don't write about
my reactions.

154
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,791
That's the whole point.

155
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,250
I keep a record of
what's going on

156
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,583
without really
including myself.

157
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,375
I don't get involved.

158
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,208
My diary doesn't have
anything in it about

159
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,416
what actually happens to me.

160
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,500
Squirmy little tadpole,
aren't you?

161
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,375
No sweat.

162
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,416
So your diary isn't much
for pertinent details

163
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,958
about what happens to you.

164
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,500
You might say mine kind
of picks up the slack there.

165
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,333
I'm good at keeping an
eye on my sugar bear.

166
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,791
Okay.

167
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,708
C'mon, pookie!
Use your head.

168
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,250
We can coordinate
the information in

169
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,375
your diary with the
information in mine

170
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,458
to piece together every
little thing that's going

171
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,500
to go down within
a mile of you!

172
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,875
You'll be invincible!

173
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,333
That's brilliant.

174
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:08,666
Yuki, I told you
I've got your back.

175
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,625
Think of me as a
survival resource

176
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,125
you can tap whenever you want!

177
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,166
The hell's wrong with me?

178
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,583
Look at us.

179
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,416
What is it now?

180
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,291
How pathetic am I?

181
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,791
Thinking I was watching
everything from a safe distance.

182
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:33,041
I kept to a strict policy
of staying out of things.

183
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,416
But the truth is I'd have

184
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,000
given an eye not to
be so cordoned off.

185
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,125
I was just lonely, you know?

186
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,208
I wanted to be the
guy everybody liked.

187
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,166
Talk to that one girl.

188
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,583
Deep down, though.

189
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,500
I was just too scared
of getting hurt.

190
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,166
Is that irony or what?

191
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,125
I'm always calling
myself an observer.

192
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,750
When really I'm just a coward.

193
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,458
Stop talking like
your life's over, silly.

194
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,250
You got at least an
hour and a half before

195
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,666
your Dead End
becomes a reality.

196
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,166
I say we nix the
mope-fest and get

197
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,375
ourselves over to
the other building.

198
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,833
I mean, think about it;
they're all your friends, right?

199
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,791
They're bound to help us!

200
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,250
Only thing that
worries me is why his

201
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,625
Dead End is scheduled for 2:04.

202
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,333
She could've killed
him at any time.

203
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,375
Why is she putting it off?

204
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,708
Alright then, chief.

205
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,958
We've got the SWAT snipers
in position on the rooftop.

206
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,375
Call them off.

207
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,958
Beg pardon, sir?!

208
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,791
This is Uryuu Minene
we're dealing with here!

209
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,041
What kind of
leverage do we have

210
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,083
if you don't put her
in the crosshairs?

211
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:46,875
She's too clever.

212
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,458
We wouldn't have
any leverage either way.

213
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,416
The little fury has the
bombs programmed to go

214
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,458
off on mass the
second her heart stops.

215
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,500
She's made herself
into the ultimate trigger.

216
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,583
But that's crazy!

217
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,208
She's right.

218
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,750
What I've got to do right now
is think about my classmates.

219
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,416
They'll have to take
the whole Future Diary

220
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,291
thing at face value, sure.

221
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,708
But if they can
just hear me out,

222
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,416
there's no reason we
can't pull through this.

223
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,041
I don't like this.

224
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,750
It's too quiet.

225
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:36,250
Too long since my
diary's rewritten itself.

226
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I know him!

227
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,375
I'm sorry, what?

228
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,916
Kousaka, hey!

229
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,000
Hold on.
This isn't right.

230
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,791
Why are they out
of their classrooms?

231
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,208
Oh no.

232
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,916
Yuki!

233
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,166
Here's the deal I'm after Amano.

234
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,500
Pool your resources
and deliver him to me

235
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,791
like the good little
drones you are, and hey...

236
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,583
I'd have to disarm the
bombs for a sec, huh?

237
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,500
Do me that kindness
ladies and germs,

238
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,041
and no one else
needs to die today.

239
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,833
Truss him up and toss his
cell phone out of reach.

240
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,625
Watch out for
his girlfriend, too.

241
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,833
Get him down here,
and we're Even Steven.

242
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,208
This isn't real.

243
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,000
We're supposed to
be in this together!

244
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,291
Why are you doing this?!

245
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,375
I'd stay right there
if I were you.

246
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,666
There's a minefield between us.

247
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,166
Let go of me, please!

248
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,625
I've got to protect him!

249
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,791
That'll do everyone,
much obliged.

250
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:48,791
Motion sensors are back online,
by the way so get comfy.

251
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:53,000
They're your friends, right?
They're bound to help us.

252
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,458
It was my idea to reach
out to these people.

253
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,750
I told him they
were his friends.

254
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,833
This is all my fault!

255
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,750
They're monsters.

256
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:08,125
They couldn't care less
if Yuki lives or dies.

257
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,250
They...

258
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,833
They've made a liar out of me!

259
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,458
End of the line, First.

260
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,791
Too bad so sad.

261
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,291
I can't let this happen!

262
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,208
Whatever the cost.

263
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:31,458
This is what you all get for
selling out my poor Yuki!!!

264
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,416
Anyone who treats my man like

265
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,250
a bargaining chip can
get blown to hell!

266
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,666
Looks like we've
got a loose cannon.

267
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,458
Chief, look at this!

268
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,500
I'm going in.

269
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:47,708
Stop it, Yuno.

270
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,333
You're going to kill everyone.

271
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,375
It's all over.

272
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,833
I can't do this anymore!

273
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,916
I'm gonna die.

274
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,375
I'm really gonna die.

275
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,500
Hey, I'm not all bad.

276
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,916
Your backstabbing
friends can go with you.

277
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,916
In ten minutes this place will
go up like a munitions factory!

278
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,583
Ten minutes.

279
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,166
2:04 p.m.
My Dead End.

280
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,291
That's how it happens.

281
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,458
You haven't lived
till you've seen

282
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,791
what I can do with plastique.

283
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,166
You're at 11;
we need you at a 4.

284
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,625
Due courtesy when on my turf.

285
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,250
How's it hanging, First?

286
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,791
Do I know you?

287
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,041
Ah, no worries.

288
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,750
It's not a surprise that
you don't remember me.

289
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,333
Stop wasting my time, Fourth.

290
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,666
Stop wasting mine.

291
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,833
We both know
what you're here for.

292
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:43,916
Did she say?

293
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,458
It's a little complicated.

294
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,125
All you really need
to know right now

295
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,500
is that she isn't here for you.

296
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,833
It's me she wants.

297
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,875
Say hello to the Case Diary.

298
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,041
It lets me know how
jobs I'm on will pan out.

299
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,875
Being a god doesn't
do it for me.

300
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:05,458
My cup of tea is bringing
homicidal maniacs to justice.

301
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,750
Excuse me.

302
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,583
Not to break up your
little pow wow over there.

303
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,833
But I'd kind of like to start
laying out a few demands.

304
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:18,166
I'll just take your silence,
as a green light.

305
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,333
So...

306
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,250
Blow the little
bastard's brains out.

307
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,833
Then do yourself!

308
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:27,083
It's bad enough I have to
wrangle with a whipped teenager.

309
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,916
I'm not about to
leave a sooth saying

310
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,958
homicide cop on the loose!

311
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,083
No dice, Ninth.

312
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:32,958
Fine!

313
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,291
Then everybody can go to hell!

314
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,125
Don't take it personally.

315
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,541
She's painted me into a corner.

316
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:50,500
For what it's worth, your death
is going to weigh on me.

317
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,666
Naturally.

318
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,625
I mean, how long did
I think a wuss like me

319
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,833
would hold out in this game?

320
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,791
I'm just a wallflower.

321
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,791
Terrified of life.

322
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,291
When push came to
shove, I had to use a

323
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,958
crazy girl just to
make it this far.

324
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,791
Death was only a matter of time.

325
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,458
Please.

326
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,958
Promise me my death
won't be for nothing.

327
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,958
Promise me it won't
be as meaningless

328
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,666
as my stupid life's
always been.

329
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,000
Yuno.

330
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,583
Don't just sit there.
Get your diary.

331
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,833
If you really want your
life to mean something,

332
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,250
then get off your ass.

333
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,375
Show us you're a force
to be reckoned with.

334
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,666
And maybe help
your little friend?

335
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,041
Turn that fear to advantage.

336
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,375
Dress it up as a game face.

337
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:58,916
Sure, that'll do.

338
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,875
Go for it!

339
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,541
He's out of his damn head.

340
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:04,750
The minefield!

341
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,291
Yuki! Left!

342
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,416
Son of a...

343
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,041
Kay, I don't like
where this is going!

344
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,250
Veer to the right!

345
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,875
Seriously?!

346
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,083
The little tramp's
a diary user!!!

347
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,958
Enough playing cowboy, Fourth!

348
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,250
Now left! Then another
left after that!

349
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,416
Shut up!

350
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,166
Crap!
Now what?!

351
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,916
Fine!
I'll do this manually!

352
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,458
Yuki!

353
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,791
You can do it!

354
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,625
You little turds!

355
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,208
Shit!

356
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:52,958
Ninth!

357
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,250
Oh shit!

358
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,583
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!!!

359
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,750
Shit!!!!

360
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,208
Give up, Ninth.

361
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,916
Only an idiot would
resist in your condition.

362
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,833
 Screw you!!!

363
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,833
What the?

364
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,083
My diary's got a name, too!

365
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,041
The Escape Diary!

366
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,958
Ninth and the others will
be falling all over

367
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,583
themselves to get at you, kid.

368
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:42,833
When they pounce, I'll be there
to put a stop to this madness.

369
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,916
Matter of fact, I
propose the three of us

370
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,083
form a partnership to
ensure exactly that.

371
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:49,708
We can call ourselves the

372
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,708
Future Diary Alliance or
something like that.

373
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,500
Corny, I know.
But are you with me?

374
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,291
Hell yeah!

375
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,583
What do you say we get going?

376
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,416
 I say "sure." 

377
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:12,125
♪ closing song ♪

378
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,250
Hey-o, fans!

379
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,666
I'm Murmur, a
character that you'll

380
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,541
notice doesn't get
much screen time.

381
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,500
Yeah. Sure, they'll
tack me on the end.

382
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:55,875
But it's really
just for exposition.

383
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,083
See, the point of this
segment is to spell out things

384
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:00,041
you may not have
gotten on your own.

385
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:01,583
Nice of them, yeah?

386
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:04,083
Well, honestly, we're trying to
keep you interested by laying

387
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:06,375
out the back stories of the
other diary users you know,

388
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:08,833
in case you're not sold
on the principle cast yet.

389
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:10,625
For example, it's got
to be bugging you how

390
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:13,208
Fourth and Ninth
knew who Yuki was.

391
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,291
See, the thing is, both
were originally on

392
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:16,750
the trail of Third, who,

393
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:19,166
you'll remember from episode
one, was a serial killer.

394
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:22,541
Fourth is a cop.

395
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:25,333
Ninth a hardened criminal.

396
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:28,291
Familiar with society's dark
underbelly, they both knew some

397
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:30,916
of the diaries would
be used for evil.

398
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,500
Fourth's diary keeps track of
what the future holds in store

399
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,208
for the cases he's working,

400
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:39,666
so when he was after
Hiyama, owie, owie, owie.

401
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,333
He knew when
Yuki got questioned.

402
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,250
So, wait why did
you need to know that?

403
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,458
Oh right cause when
Yuki killed Third, he was

404
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:48,458
already on Fourth's radar, so
Ninth pieced it together.

405
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:53,416
Anyway, what First is in for
next is anyone's guess.

406
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,083
Unless of course you
had a Future Diary,

407
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:57,083
in which case you'd
be up to speed.

408
00:23:57,166 --> 00:24:00,250
See you next time!
