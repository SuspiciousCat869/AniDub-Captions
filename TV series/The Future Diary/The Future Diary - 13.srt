1
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:53,083
Where are you Yuki?

2
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:54,958
Akise!

3
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:57,958
Nishijima...
Hey.

4
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:59,416
What are you doing up here?

5
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,458
I haven't seen you in forever.

6
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:05,416
It's our stop.

7
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,458
No one ever said it has to be.

8
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:10,000
But this is where we were
going to look at the stars.

9
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,791
I've got a better spot in mind.

10
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:13,666
Don't you worry.

11
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,458
Uh, sure.

12
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:20,875
♪ opening song ♪

13
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:57,875
Fourth has become the next
keeper to trek thither into that

14
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:01,041
undiscovered country
from which no man returns.

15
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:04,458
I must admit to a
certain frisson of surprise.

16
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:08,416
My calculations had Fourth
in the game up until the end.

17
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,541
Rather odd, isn't it.

18
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,166
Not really!

19
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,375
What?

20
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,041
Mochi.

21
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,666
Aw, what the heck.

22
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,166
I might as well be
straight with ya, Boss.

23
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,041
Fourth shouldn't have known
that his kid was slowly

24
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,708
but surely kicking the bucket
until later in the game.

25
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,958
He would've sold out
Yuki and Yuno eventually,

26
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,708
but only after more
keepers bit the big one.

27
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,708
Trouble is, his presence
on the board was

28
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,333
stabilizing the game too much.

29
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,625
Boring!

30
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,958
So I maybe kind of sort
of gave things a nudge.

31
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,791
What are your motives, imp?

32
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,208
I want the same
thing you do, Boss.

33
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,458
A game that's fun to watch

34
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,416
and doesn't take
forever to play out.

35
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:51,750
We don't exactly have all the
time in the world, you know.

36
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,416
You're going to be
checking out any day now.

37
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,375
And we have to get
your successor ready to roll.

38
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,000
Hey, Deus.

39
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,625
What you say we spice
things up with a bet?

40
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,333
Yuki.

41
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm kind of thirsty.

42
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,500
I'm going to go buy
a drink, if that's okay.

43
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,750
Oh, yeah.

44
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,708
The air seems
pretty clean up here.

45
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,916
I think we'll be able
to see the stars just fine.

46
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,125
One soda, coming up!

47
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:39,916
Huh?

48
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,791
I figured you
would be thirsty, too.

49
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,750
Thanks.

50
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,375
That stretch
I dedicate to Akise.

51
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:06,375
We owe him a big
thank-you for inviting us.

52
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,541
Ain't that the truth!

53
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,416
The view here is
simply breathtaking!

54
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,208
The scenery up here
is really beautiful, isn't it.

55
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,291
A hot spring?

56
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,958
And you're, inviting us?

57
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,291
Indeed.

58
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,500
I received these vouchers
from an acquaintance of mine.

59
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:28,583
Might as well celebrate
your recovery, right?

60
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,083
I'm going to make crab an
endangered species at dinner.

61
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,625
Is something the matter?

62
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:43,208
I could have of sworn I saw
a flash in the water just now.

63
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,916
It's just your imagination.

64
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,250
Yeah, must of been.

65
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,541
There's nothing in
here that could make a--

66
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:51,791
That was not my imagination!

67
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,250
Oh!
No, Hinata, please!

68
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,500
You have to put those away!

69
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,166
Look, something
keeps flashing down there

70
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,250
and I want to
know what it is?!

71
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,875
Hey, how come
your nose is bloody?

72
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:01,875
Uh...

73
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,750
Wait...
What you got there, huh?

74
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:05,583
Huh?

75
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,333
Oh, that?

76
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:08,791
A cell phone?

77
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,625
No shit, Sherlock!

78
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,458
Now tell me why you
dragged the damn thing

79
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:13,500
into the bath with us!

80
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,125
I was expecting
an important call?!

81
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,458
Too bad!
Now give me that phone!

82
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,416
No, I need it!

83
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,041
Dammit, Mao!
Stop squirming!

84
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,541
Stop grabbing at me you pervert!

85
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,750
Me?! You just
double-high-fived my boobs!

86
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,458
A zip-line?

87
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:26,791
That's right.

88
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,750
They say you can see
for miles around as you go.

89
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,041
Aw, that sounds
like a yawn-fest.

90
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,541
But as long as
we're here anyway,

91
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,208
I guess we should
give it a whirl.

92
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,875
Guess who just ganked,
like, all the crab!

93
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,291
Man... This is why
we can't take you anywhere.

94
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:42,500
I don't mean to be rude, but
why is he on this trip, again?

95
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:46,750
Well... I had an extra voucher
so I figured what the heck.

96
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,666
I guess.

97
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,458
So what's boy detective
jotting down over there, huh?

98
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,375
That your actual diary?

99
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,666
More or less.

100
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,833
Whatever!

101
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,958
I bet you it's not as
cool as this baby!

102
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,708
Behold the Kousaka King Diary,

103
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,125
a chronicle of my
rock-tacular triumphs!

104
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,041
That's the worst
diary in all of history.

105
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,166
Some grade-school
kid write those for ya?

106
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,708
Grade-school kids
don't rock this hard!

107
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:13,875
Why do you call yourself a
commoner in your own diary?

108
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,125
Is this some online journal?

109
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,416
I'm assuming it's
programmed so that

110
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,916
your ranking improves
as you post.

111
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,916
Guys, enough with
the damn diaries already.

112
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,750
You're going to turn into
Yuki if you don't watch out.

113
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,750
Speaking of, I wonder
what he's up to right now?

114
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,416
Dude probably got
his ticket punched.

115
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,250
Whoa.
What's your problem?

116
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,583
I'm going to grab more
crab... I'll be right back.

117
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,375
Uh, okay then.

118
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,125
What in the hell
are you screaming for?!

119
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,375
Hinata just mentioned Yuki!

120
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,208
I don't understand why
she'd be thinking about

121
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,291
him out of the blue like that!

122
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,208
The chief's casebook.

123
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,833
"The serial killer was Hiyama
Takao, keeper number three.

124
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,541
Uryuu Minene, a.k.a.

125
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,458
Ninth, was the school bomber.

126
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,750
Sixth and Twelfth,Tsubaki
Kasugano and Yomotsu Hirasaka,

127
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,000
were behind the cult massacre."

128
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,125
"Fifth, Houjou Reisuke, was
the assailant at Yuki's house.

129
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,458
The dog murders
were Karyuudo Tsukishima.

130
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,041
He's Tenth."

131
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:13,875
"The hospital bomber was
Keigo Kurusu or Fourth.

132
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,666
All of these incidents involved,

133
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,958
Yukiteru Amano who's First
and Second, Yuno Gasai."

134
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,708
Twelve individuals
commanded to kill each other.

135
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:25,875
And if you
don't count Uryuu,

136
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,708
only Seventh, Eighth
and Eleventh remain.

137
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,250
Yes, of course.

138
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:35,166
Yuki and Yuno are trying to
keep one step ahead of the rest.

139
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,125
The others are gunning for them.

140
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,250
We have got to find
them before they do.

141
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,000
Any promising leads?

142
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,291
They didn't exactly leave us a

143
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,875
trail of bread-crumbs
when they ran off.

144
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,083
We do know they've been taking

145
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,708
trains and other public
transportation.

146
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,083
They were last seen
heading up into the mountains.

147
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,375
I doubt it.

148
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,000
A witness gave us a
positive ID on them both.

149
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,625
Where they were seen, are
there any buildings to speak of?

150
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:58,875
No, not a one.

151
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,375
The odds of them
being there are very slim.

152
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,958
Smart money says
that they're long gone.

153
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,583
Yuno wouldn't keep running.

154
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,083
There are too many variables
she can't protect Yuki from.

155
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,166
She would go to ground.

156
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,541
Keep going.

157
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,166
That eyewitness you mentioned,
tell me about them.

158
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,416
He was the driver on one
of the buses they took.

159
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,833
Fetch me a map and I need the
particulars of that bus route.

160
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,125
I believe they're
using witnesses

161
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,083
to their own advantage.

162
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:30,166
But if you're not in the
mountains, then where are you?

163
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,458
Hello, Nishijima.

164
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:53,958
What's up, guys?

165
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,291
I hope you all got a
good night's sleep.

166
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,166
Should I know this dude, Akise?

167
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,583
Well he did pay for our trip.

168
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,833
Nishijima here gave
me the vouchers.

169
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,333
Did I mention that he's a cop?

170
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:05,791
--Huh?!
--Huh?!

171
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,791
The reason I hooked you up
with the vouchers is because

172
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,708
Yuki and Yuno might be hiding
out in this town somewhere.

173
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,000
Are you serious?!

174
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,833
I want to find Yuki,
but I'm pretty sure

175
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,250
I'm going to need
your help to do it.

176
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,166
Why the hell'd we do that?

177
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,208
Because they can
see into the future.

178
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,166
If I send in cops,
they'll run for it,

179
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,250
and we'll never even
lay eyes on them.

180
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:25,541
But they won't run
away from friends.

181
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:26,708
--Sounds like a real drag.
--What's this about?

182
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,041
Is Yuki okay?

183
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,416
I wish I knew.

184
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,708
I'm just running
with Akise's theory.

185
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,166
A, that they're even
in this town, and B,

186
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,708
that she's keeping him prisoner.

187
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,166
Wait, prisoner?!

188
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,458
What would possess
her to do that?!

189
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,541
C'mon, cop!

190
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,958
Tell us the plan!

191
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,375
Well, unfortunately, there
are a number of small towns

192
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,583
near the spot where Yuki
and Yuno were last seen,

193
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,750
and they could be
in any one of them.

194
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,625
This region depends on tourism.

195
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,916
When the economy went south

196
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
and the hot springs
weren't as big of a draw,

197
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:58,208
a lot of the hotels and homes
around here went vacant.

198
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,541
In other words,

199
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,583
she's found the world's
absolute best hiding spot.

200
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,875
So, dude...

201
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,000
This bait-and-switch you
pulled is pretty messed up.

202
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,958
Think of this as payment
for all that crab you ate.

203
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,458
Like it or not,
the fact remains that

204
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,958
Yuki saved all of our asses.

205
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,083
But, how are we
going to find them?

206
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,833
We don't have the first idea
where to start looking.

207
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,250
Well, then, I guess
we'll have to check

208
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,000
every damn building
we come across.

209
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:25,791
Hold on!

210
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,041
Are you out of your mind?!

211
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,625
You know how long
that's going to take us?!

212
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:29,541
Poor baby.

213
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,375
Is this too hard for you?

214
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,416
We'll cover more ground
if we split into groups.

215
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,750
Mao, you go with Hinata.

216
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,375
Kousaka, you're with me.

217
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,458
This trip sucks.

218
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:03,916
Hey, uh, give me a sec.

219
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,833
I got to go take a whiz.

220
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,541
Yeah good luck with that.

221
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,833
Checking every hotel is going to
take a prohibitively long time.

222
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,541
If only we could
shorten this list.

223
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:17,791
That's Kousaka!

224
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:19,833
Are you all right?

225
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,333
How I'm I supposed to
wash my hands if there's

226
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,333
no running water in
this stupid place, huh?!

227
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,375
C'mon, man!

228
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,333
Don't make me
draw you a picture!

229
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,625
Running water.

230
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,666
Kousaka, you are a genius!

231
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:38,833
Hey, Aru.

232
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,041
What you got?

233
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,375
I think I may have
figured out a way to

234
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,333
speed up the process
of finding them.

235
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:46,083
Remember to tell them the
part where I'm a genius!

236
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:47,750
Just because they're hiding

237
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,625
doesn't mean they don't
need water and power.

238
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:50,583
In other words...

239
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:51,916
We check the lights,

240
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,416
and if they don't work
that means nobody's home!

241
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,666
Yes, in a nutshell.

242
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,125
I think that'll expedite
the dragnet quite a bit.

243
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:00,958
Also, I'm honor-bound to mention
that Kousaka gave me the idea.

244
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,291
Well, what did they say?!

245
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,208
They must think I'm
pretty frigging awesome,

246
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,083
ain't that right!

247
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,541
I'm glad we don't have
to take the stairs in this one.

248
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,625
My legs could use a break.

249
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,000
The hell's that thing
doing in an elevator?!

250
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,458
It seems she knew we'd opt for

251
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31,208
the easier mode of
transportation.

252
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,833
I'm confident that's not the
only trap she's laid out for us.

253
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,416
Dude... let's just
call it a day huh?

254
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,750
I don't think we're going
to find Yuki in this one!

255
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,000
In all likelihood,
your hunch is correct.

256
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:48,916
But we'll never know for certain
unless we check every last room.

257
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,500
Yuno is nothing
if not meticulous.

258
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,083
She could have him
secreted away anywhere.

259
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,333
Another swing and a miss.

260
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,583
This'd be way easier if we
had some of that diary action.

261
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:02,833
Keep your chin up.

262
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,750
Look at it this way
every place we cross off

263
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,250
the list gets us that much
closer to finding him.

264
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,125
It's going to work.

265
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,875
Of course it is.

266
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,416
You guys have
covered a lot of ground.

267
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,583
Good job.

268
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,125
I was wondering.

269
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,666
Go on.

270
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,750
This is something of
a long-shot but did

271
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:25,250
Yuno's family ever own one
of the hotels in the area?

272
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,333
No, that's good!!

273
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:27,333
That would make sense!

274
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,291
Let me check
and get back to you!

275
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,666
Hey, what's the big idea?!

276
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,500
She's trying to slow us down.

277
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,041
Look alive.

278
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,750
We have to get out of this car.

279
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,625
Yeah but,
how're we going to do it?

280
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,291
I got a text?

281
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,708
How come they
didn't just call me?

282
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,041
This is from Yuki!

283
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,000
What does it say?!

284
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,291
I know where she's keeping him!

285
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,458
Oh crap!

286
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,041
We have to go
get him outta there!

287
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:07,916
Hold on!

288
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,041
Shouldn't we call the others?!

289
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,375
That'll take too long!

290
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,583
Tell them she's got Yuki

291
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,875
trapped in the basement
of the Grand Hotel!

292
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,583
Thanks, Mao!

293
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,708
Oh Hinata.

294
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:27,583
Sorry.

295
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,000
Go ahead.

296
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:38,875
Can you hear me?!

297
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,125
Loud and clear.

298
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,083
We just found out
where she's keeping Yuki!

299
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,208
Where are you now?

300
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,791
We should regroup
before we go in.

301
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,333
Hinata went in by herself?

302
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,500
Uh-huh.

303
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,125
Wait, you were saying Hinata
got that text from Yuki, right?

304
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:02,625
Why would Yuno leave him
his phone if he's her prisoner?

305
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,416
Good point.

306
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,958
Thanks to her diary's powers,

307
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:09,083
Yuno is privy to every
move that Yuki makes.

308
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:12,750
He couldn't possibly have sent
that text to Hinata's phone.

309
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,375
No doubt a plea
for help came from

310
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,083
his phone but he was
not the sender.

311
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,500
Damn it!

312
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,291
Yuno sent her a fake message
to lure her into the hotel!

313
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,708
Okay, let's do this.

314
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,833
Hinata's in serious trouble!

315
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,291
That's Hinata's ringtone!

316
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,166
She totally found Yuki
in the hotel basement!

317
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,625
Check it!

318
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,541
So it seems.

319
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,750
But did Hinata send this?

320
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,083
Doubtful.

321
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,458
Yo, guys!

322
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,083
Enough with the
freeze-tag routine!

323
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,333
Let's bust him out already!

324
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:50,541
Yes, of course.

325
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:51,541
This way!

326
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,083
Right!

327
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:13,750
Ready?

328
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,541
Yeah, ready.

329
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:22,583
Check it, guys.

330
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,833
Yuki.
Twelve o'clock.

331
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,875
Uh, Yuki?

332
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,125
No response.

333
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,708
Perhaps he's unconscious.

334
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,583
Too difficult to tell
from this distance.

335
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,166
I'm going to slip in
and check his condition.

336
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,375
If you could hold the door
open while I do, Kousaka,

337
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,083
I'd be ever so much obliged.

338
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,583
You got it!
I'm your man!

339
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,500
Mao, would you
mind coming with me?

340
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,833
Sure, whenever you're ready.

341
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,416
Hey, Yuki?

342
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,208
Can you hear me?

343
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,875
It's a wig!

344
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:03,666
Hoist him outta
that chair and let's jam!

345
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,375
Huh?!

346
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,375
No, no, no, no!
You've got to be kidding me!

347
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,583
We cannot be locked in here!

348
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:13,916
This was a trap.

349
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,791
And we took the bait.

350
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:17,750
Door's not budging.

351
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,166
We're stuck in here!

352
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,250
But I got that message!

353
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,250
That text wasn't
really from Hinata.

354
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,500
Just like the one that brought
her here in the first place,

355
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,458
it was actually
sent out by Yuno.

356
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,208
But then, where's Hinata?!

357
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,958
Yeah and where's Yuno
hiding the real Yuki?!

358
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,208
Hinata probably made
the same mistake we did,

359
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,375
and came to this room.

360
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,000
Yuno doubtless
got the drop on her.

361
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,625
I hope she's still in one piece.

362
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,041
And what was Yuki
doing during this catfight?!

363
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,125
He just stood by
and let it happen?!

364
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,791
Of course not.

365
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,958
He probably can't move.

366
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,375
What's that hissing?

367
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,791
I know that scent.

368
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,916
It's gas!

369
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,791
Wait, like gas?

370
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,125
--Holy crap!
--No!

371
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,083
If we don't find a
way out of this room,

372
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,708
we're all going to asphyxiate!

373
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,958
You want to make a bet who's
going to win this game, Deus?

374
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:22,833
Face it...

375
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,250
Team Yuki isn't looking so hot.

376
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,333
I'm putting my money on Second.

377
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,000
What about you, Boss?

378
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:34,083
I know you like him and all, but
First is out of the running now.

379
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,166
I bet on Yukiteru, regardless.

380
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:41,291
My faith in the lad has
not wavered one iota.

381
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,000
Mark my words.

382
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,791
First shall prevail.

383
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:51,291
♪ closing song ♪

384
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:15,916
Sorry, panties...

385
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,916
No hot spring for you.

386
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,500
Huh?

387
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,750
Dead midget!
Dead midget!

388
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:24,791
Well what have we here?

389
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,625
You're the girl who roused
me from my slumber.

390
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,750
If you hadn't said
something when you did,

391
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,750
I would have remained
asleep for eternity.

392
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,416
So, you got a name?

393
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,291
Who, me?

394
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:35,125
Yeah, it's uh.

395
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,208
Enough about me!

396
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:38,458
Since you saved me,

397
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,958
I'll grant you any one
wish your heart desires!

398
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,833
Go nuts, babe!
Make a wish!

399
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,291
I think I'm going to pass.

400
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,833
Oh, and you should
stop napping in baskets.

401
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,333
Not going to lie,
it's kind of weird.

402
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:52,166
C'mon!
Just make a wish!

403
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,791
I wish I could use
this in the bath.

404
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,583
I think there's
something in the basket.

405
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:00,875
Dead midget!
Dead midget!

406
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:03,041
Well what have we here?

407
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:05,500
You're the second girl who
roused me from my slumber.

408
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,250
If you hadn't said
something when you did,

409
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,458
I would have remained
asleep for eternity again.

410
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:11,166
Uh, what do I call you?

411
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,375
Just call me.

412
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,166
Uh, you know...

413
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,291
But enough about me, right?!

414
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:16,541
Since you saved me,

415
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:18,833
I'll grant you any one
wish your heart desires!

416
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:20,875
Knock it outta the park and go!

417
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:22,125
A wish?

418
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:22,916
I don't know.

419
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,833
Wait, wait--don't tell me!

420
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:24,958
I'm going to use
my powers to

421
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:26,833
pluck it right outta your head!

422
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,291
You're cutting it way
too close there, Murmur!

423
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,500
Don't give her a chance to turn
you down like the other one did!

424
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:35,125
Huh?

425
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:37,250
I think somebody would
really dig a waterproof

426
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,000
cell phone right
about now am I right?

427
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:41,875
How'd you know
that's what I wanted?!

428
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:43,166
I rock.

429
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:45,458
Abracadabra!

430
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,958
Now you can take
pictures in the bath,

431
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:49,583
with the flash and everything.

432
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:52,666
Thank you,
wish midget cause now I can!

433
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:54,833
Uh...

434
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:55,833
Just don't put them
on the internet.

435
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:57,583
That's all I'm saying.

436
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:01,458
I'm going to hit the bath.
