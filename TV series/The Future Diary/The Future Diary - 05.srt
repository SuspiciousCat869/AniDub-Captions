1
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,458
Time to choose, Yuki.

2
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,333
Choose what?

3
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:34,583
Stick with me and
get out of this alive.

4
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:36,958
Or stay with that
whore and say goodnight.

5
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,541
Better hurry.

6
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,583
Uh. Now?

7
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:41,958
What the hell?!

8
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,791
Look, whoever's behind
this is after Sixth, not us.

9
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,875
And there's no reason
we can't just ditch her.

10
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:49,166
So leaving means we live!

11
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:52,666
I gave my word I'd protect her.

12
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,875
What gave me the idea I could?

13
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:05,916
♪ opening song ♪

14
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:43,875
There are two worlds:
one visible, one invisible.

15
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,666
The second is a
wellspring from which

16
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,666
my misery flows in
dark torrents.

17
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,583
My sight was poor from birth;
I could scarcely

18
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:58,166
see beyond the reach of my hand.

19
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:01,458
But God bestowed on
me the gift of second sight;

20
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,750
the future was
always known to me.

21
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:07,125
My parents were quick to work
this talent to their advantage,

22
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,958
proclaiming me
The Clairvoyant Maiden

23
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:12,333
and anointing me with
countless, eager devotees.

24
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,500
Though to all outward
appearances powerful,

25
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:17,583
my role as the Omekata
Cult's leader was a pantomime;

26
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:18,958
I was little more
than a mouthpiece

27
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:22,291
for my parents' designs
though happy all the same.

28
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:27,458
They were kind,
my visitors often delightful.

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,208
Of the world beyond
the shrine I knew little,

30
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:33,666
but even so loneliness never
presumed to touch me.

31
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,041
Then came the accident.

32
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,541
Pain inevitably flows from
that which we cannot see.

33
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:53,083
We lurch along the path of life,
spine bent with sin!

34
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:57,166
To unbind our burden, one must
withdraw from the road!

35
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,500
My chamber became a prison cell;
paradise, a living hell.

36
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,875
My only comfort was a
plaything of my mother's

37
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,750
a small vestige of
the visible world.

38
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,541
Then one day.

39
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:16,166
The invisible world claimed
this, too, for its own.

40
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,250
No, It's not fair.

41
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,958
I need it.

42
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,000
I have nothing else!

43
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,500
Why must the
darkness torment me?!

44
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,458
I hate you!
I hate you!

45
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:28,958
I hate you!!!

46
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,208
Right, we have an exit!

47
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,208
We're getting you out of here!

48
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,291
I was right to put
my trust in you.

49
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,083
Sorry it took so long,
damn sprinklers are

50
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,250
more complicated than
they need to be.

51
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,208
Get out of there!

52
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,666
Things getting uglier?

53
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,750
Somebody's hypnotized
all the cultists!

54
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,250
Come again?

55
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,791
As if the situation wasn't
bizarre enough, right?

56
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,916
It's okay backup's
been called in.

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,166
I want you kids to make
a b-line for the front gate

58
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,833
and tell them you're with me.

59
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,666
What are you gonna do?

60
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,583
I'm going to find Ninth.

61
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,583
6:47pm.

62
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,875
I enlighten Ninth as to my
personal concept of Justice.

63
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,666
She isn't especially impressed.

64
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,083
Is that his diary?

65
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,125
Hey.

66
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,708
What are you doing?

67
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,625
Enjoying a sneak preview.

68
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,833
Or, pre-listen, rather.

69
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,166
Say hello to the Diary of
Justice a record of

70
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,541
unspeakably wicked deeds all but
begging for swift retribution!

71
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,708
It's how I descried the
Cult's unseemly agenda;

72
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,250
why I took it upon

73
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,000
myself to infiltrate this nest
of vipers and subdue Sixth.

74
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,416
You, unlucky wretch,
were merely a token of

75
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,791
my pretense at loyalty
to the enemy!

76
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,250
Through the prognostications of
this magnificent contraption

77
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,750
I knew where and when to
"rescue" you and

78
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,666
how to give you "first aid."

79
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,375
6:47pm.

80
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,500
Errant litter behind a desk.

81
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,000
What?!

82
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:12,708
Aaaaahhhh.

83
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:15,083
Harmony restored.

84
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,791
What is it now?

85
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,208
I'm off to make good use
of your explosives.

86
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,750
What'd the diary tell you?!

87
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,625
That righteousness
will be satisfied!

88
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,166
I'd abscond if I were you.

89
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,250
Crossfire, you understand.

90
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,833
Wait. That's it?

91
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,958
If I didn't know better, I'd
swear you did that deliberately!

92
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,750
Whatever, keep your shirt on,
we're practically there!

93
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,208
Yuno?

94
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,833
Greetings, milady.

95
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,041
Truly, you honor us.

96
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,041
I can't believe it's her!

97
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,208
I don't like where
this is going.

98
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,000
Wondrous to see you,
your ladyship.

99
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,708
Please tell me
they've snapped out of it!

100
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,416
They're acting normal
for cultists, I guess.

101
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,000
Look, my love!
Almost there!

102
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,583
We're on the homestretch
of getting out of this!

103
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,500
I beg you, wait!

104
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,666
We should pay the
villains back in kind.

105
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,250
Huh?

106
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,875
My adherents have been restored
to their senses, have they not?

107
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,791
We have numbers on our side!

108
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,291
Really?

109
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,750
Yuno, please!
Just stop!

110
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,250
Whatever it is
you're about to do.

111
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,375
There's nothing to
worry about, sweetie.

112
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,041
It won't take long.

113
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,000
What do you mean?

114
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,916
Oh crap she's in psycho mode!

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,375
I'm on to you.

116
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,583
I'm not about to stand here
and let you trick my man.

117
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:42,958
Delusional.

118
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,083
Do you see, Yuki?

119
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,208
What's going on?

120
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,541
What are you farting around for?

121
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,583
Twelfth is about
to be on top of you.

122
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,291
Wait.
Say that again?!

123
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,666
Son of a bitch.

124
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,458
Guy's bad news
top to bottom...

125
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,916
...blind as a mole rat
but ears like radar.

126
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
He's got explosives with him and
he fully intends to use them.

127
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,833
Of course he does!

128
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,958
So get the hell
outta Dodge already!

129
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,000
Yuki!
Someone's on the roof!

130
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,083
Aw, damn it!

131
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,708
Twelfth Red!

132
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,416
Twelfth Blue!

133
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,166
Twelfth Yellow!

134
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,666
Twelfth Green!

135
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,208
Twelfth Pink!

136
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,833
Together, we form.

137
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,041
The Twelfth Five!

138
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
This is ridiculous.

139
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,083
Pleasure to meet you.

140
00:08:59,166 --> 00:08:59,916
First.

141
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,041
Surprised.

142
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:01,916
I'll bet.

143
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,958
Not that I blame you.

144
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,875
I have absolutely
no response to this.

145
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,833
Mind your manners, miscreant!

146
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,375
You're being addressed
by an adult!

147
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,125
Sorry!

148
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,333
Hi!

149
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,041
Heed my warning, boy.

150
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:18,083
Sixth is playing you for a fool.

151
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,041
The initiatory ritual for
membership in this

152
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:24,083
cult is a blight on civilized
behavior everywhere!

153
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,000
Neophyte acolytes are
forced to share the

154
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,625
burden of this
cult's evil secret,

155
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:31,000
thus cinching unwavering
loyalty from all who join!

156
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:34,458
In short, this sect is a
brainwashing factory!

157
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,625
I don't.

158
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,166
I don't know what to do.

159
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:42,083
My purpose here tonight
is to terminate Sixth.

160
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,666
As I cannot guarantee your
safety, you should leave.

161
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,000
Be advised that one of me

162
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,500
has ingested a timed
incendiary device.

163
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,166
And that me will
be going kerplooie.

164
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,416
Okay.

165
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,000
What about the other four?

166
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,625
Mesmerized
decoys all, I'm afraid.

167
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,875
Desperate times,
desperate measures.

168
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,333
I've had the
demoralizing bad fortune

169
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,875
to be notified of a Dead End.

170
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,000
I cannot say I'm shocked, being
deep behind enemy lines.

171
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:10,375
But I can at least take said
enemy with me when I go!

172
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,916
You've got to be
out of your mind!

173
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,500
If by surrendering my life
I advance the cause

174
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,666
of Justice, Fate's terms
are acceptable!

175
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,583
Okeydokey, then.

176
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:20,708
This would be a pretty good time

177
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,208
to get out of here,
don't you think?

178
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:25,166
I've told you,
I can't leave Tsubaki.

179
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,333
Showtime!

180
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:31,125
There's got to be something
in my diary that I can use!

181
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,583
Second guy from the left!

182
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:36,666
Aw, come on!

183
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,791
That's totally cheating!

184
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,833
The real one's blind, right?

185
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,583
That means four
of the five can see.

186
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:45,791
Gotcha.

187
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,125
Wait Yuno!

188
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,125
Surely you're not gambling
with odds like these?!

189
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,208
Watch and learn, sister!

190
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,583
Heh...
Gotcha, you bastard.

191
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,000
Victory is yours.

192
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,291
Let Justice prevail.

193
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,708
Okay.

194
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:19,291
Yuki was right; it was the
second one from the left.

195
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,750
7:07pm.

196
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,541
Hirasaka Yomotsu, a.k.a.

197
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,166
Twelfth, perishes.

198
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,625
Dead End.

199
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,916
What the hell's going on?!

200
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,916
Explosion.

201
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,250
Give me my damn cell phone back!

202
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,166
Do you want to make
it out of here on your legs

203
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,000
or in a body bag?!

204
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,291
Yuno?!

205
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,791
Oh man, she's burning up!

206
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,541
She's been pushing
herself too hard!

207
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,666
Kudos, Second.

208
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,291
You have my respect.

209
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,541
Huh?

210
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,666
What are they doing?

211
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,500
What are they doing?!

212
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,416
Sorry, Yuki.

213
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,166
Tsubaki, please!
Call them off!

214
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,541
You've really not put it
together yet, have you?

215
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,875
Foolish boy.

216
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,208
I mean to kill the lot of you.

217
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,750
Ninth was bait from the
beginning; wheels within wheels,

218
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,041
as our Game Master might say.

219
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,041
Damn you, Twelfth!

220
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,958
No, you...

221
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:23,208
You're like a beacon of hope to
people you can't be this way!

222
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,375
No doubt you think me virtuous.

223
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:31,166
I was relieved of
my virtue long ago.

224
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,500
It's far too cruel
a world to be naive in.

225
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,958
Or for that matter a virgin.

226
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:43,375
We could do something about
your virtue, if you'd like.

227
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:59,125
Now, then.

228
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,916
Child... Let us see
if the appropriate Dead End

229
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,541
has yet appeared on my scroll.

230
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,000
Impossible!
How can this be?!

231
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,083
I refuse to believe.

232
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,250
You kissed my Yuki!!!!

233
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:19,208
Stand firm!

234
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,916
Protect the diary!

235
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,458
YOU WHORE!!!

236
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,083
Yuno!

237
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,500
Are you...?

238
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,333
You have to take this.

239
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,375
My arm!

240
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,333
Make a run for it.

241
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:46,833
Yuno!

242
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,666
Oh no!
Talk to me!

243
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,875
Don't let him get away!

244
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,166
Somebody cut him
off at the gate!

245
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,625
Call me a whore?!

246
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,708
The girl's been reigned in and

247
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,541
Yuki scrambled for
a hiding place.

248
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,250
We have zero chance of
staying out of sight.

249
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,458
And of course.

250
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,916
The backup I called
for can't get further

251
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,416
than the hedgerow out front.

252
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,291
We're screwed.

253
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,541
Will you shut your face already?

254
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:17,000
And while you're at it
get this thing off me!

255
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,500
I'm not about to bite the big
one cuffed to a damn pig!

256
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,625
Fine.
I'll take 'em off.

257
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,333
But you gotta do
something for me.

258
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,708
My lady, you've lost a
dangerous amount of blood.

259
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,000
We must take you to a hospital.

260
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,166
Shut your mouth!

261
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,500
This is an inconvenience,
nothing more!

262
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,958
The invisible world yet
again claims something

263
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,250
dear to me for its own.

264
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,000
I loathe it.

265
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,666
I'd destroy the darkness,
if I could.

266
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:54,166
I'd destroy everything
it encompasses!

267
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,625
Mark me, Second.

268
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,916
My first act as God will be
to end this wretched world.

269
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,250
But you can't!

270
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:06,291
This world is where Yuki
lives that would kill him!

271
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,250
I've just had a minor epiphany.

272
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,875
Let's use you as bait.

273
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,416
If he loves you,
he can't resist.

274
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,583
You'll know he reciprocates
and then you'll get

275
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,250
to watch him die
before your eyes.

276
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:19,000
Hey.

277
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:19,791
See anything?

278
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:20,500
Nothing yet.

279
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,000
You check under here?

280
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,875
No, but he'll hear you.

281
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,666
C'mon.
Where's he gonna go?

282
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,416
Just try to be discreet.

283
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,166
Am I safe here?

284
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,000
Watch where you step.

285
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,583
Tsubaki was leading me
on the whole time.

286
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:41,291
I should've just taken
Yuno's word for it.

287
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,791
Sure she's nuts, but,

288
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,541
at least you know where
you stand with her.

289
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,083
I think.

290
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,208
Whoa.

291
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:51,166
The amusement park
thing was a date to her?

292
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,000
Yuno's definitely not
your average girl,

293
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,541
but what am I gonna do?

294
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,708
She's totally serious when she
says she's gonna protect me.

295
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,083
She's crazy about me
and like it or not that's

296
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,625
turned out to be a good thing.

297
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,791
Better hurry.

298
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,708
What am I gonna do?

299
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,875
I ran off like a total wuss
without even trying to save her

300
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm pathetic!

301
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,416
What's that?

302
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,666
Here is the microphone,
your ladyship.

303
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,291
What are you gonna do?

304
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,125
I'm going to draw out your man.

305
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,291
Now, you can't tell me you're

306
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,000
not curious to see
if this works.

307
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,041
Let's get his attention!

308
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,500
No!

309
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,000
I want all the men
to form a line.

310
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,458
Testing.
One-two.

311
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:44,916
Listen up, First.

312
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,125
There's about to be a fire sale
on Second's maidenhood.

313
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,375
No!

314
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:52,083
Are you going to man-up
and try to intervene?

315
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,000
Stop it!

316
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,041
I was saving myself for Yuki!

317
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,375
Get your hands off me!!!

318
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:02,625
She wants me to come
out so she can kill us both.

319
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,708
But I can't just let Yuno be...

320
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,875
What am I supposed to do?!

321
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,875
No!

322
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,791
Look, I...

323
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,041
You're sweet and all,

324
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,166
but my gut tells me you're
hiding something.

325
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,333
There he is!

326
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,791
Get him!

327
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,875
Of course I am.

328
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,500
Why'd you just kiss
me on the forehead?

329
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:34,041
'Cause it's your move if you
want one on the lips.

330
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:38,125
Don't think I'm protecting you
out of the goodness of my heart.

331
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:41,583
A girl has the right to expect
compensation for her trouble.

332
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,333
Yuki!

333
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,500
Get off of her!

334
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,708
 Get off of her!!!

335
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,875
You're more of a man than I
thought you were, First.

336
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:53,916
Nicely done.

337
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,458
Thank you.

338
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,791
A worthy sacrifice on
my path to godhood.

339
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,375
Believe me...

340
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:03,416
When I attain the throne of time
none of this pain will matter.

341
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,583
Don't bother.

342
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,583
You're in full view of my
adherents, imbecile.

343
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,416
All your movements
are right here.

344
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,125
There's no option open
to you that I can't see.

345
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,833
More eyes are on
you in this room

346
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,041
than can possibly be evaded.

347
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,375
I know.

348
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,916
My diary says that in more
or less the same words.

349
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,208
Funny.

350
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,583
And yet somehow no Dead End
has been triggered for me.

351
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,500
Which means I'm
not checkmated yet.

352
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,500
I still have options.

353
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,583
Options like this.

354
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,833
I choose to live.

355
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,333
I choose Yuno!

356
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,666
You idiot boy!

357
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,416
I can do this.

358
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,625
All I need is a second.

359
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,750
Look at this!

360
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,500
No!

361
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,916
Their eyes are all
drawn to the same thing!

362
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,666
Don't touch my scroll!

363
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,708
My hand I...

364
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,458
Why on earth?

365
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:22,041
Of all the things.

366
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,875
Where have you been?

367
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,041
Oh Yuki.

368
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,416
I should've come sooner.

369
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,375
I'm so sorry.

370
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,041
Who are you, Yuno?

371
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,041
Who are you really?

372
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:56,583
You stalk me.

373
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,166
Switch gears at
the drop of a hat.

374
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,208
Your house has
dead people in it.

375
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:03,583
I mean, how's a guy supposed
to feel about all that?

376
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,375
Ah, who cares right now.

377
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:19,333
Did that cop seriously
hit me up for my number?

378
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,041
Whatever the hell he's up to.

379
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,000
I don't like it.

380
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:38,041
♪ closing song ♪

381
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,916
More tea?

382
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,875
Why yes, thank you.

383
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:29,958
I begin to think Justice
no more than a fiction.

384
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,375
Just the other day.

385
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:36,000
There was an elderly woman
struggling with her groceries.

386
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:39,041
Allow me, oh
world-weary babushka.

387
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:42,833
Stay away from me!

388
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,250
No,wait!
You misunderstand!

389
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:47,458
She ran in terror as though
I were a common thug.

390
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,541
Well, have you looked
in a mirror lately?

391
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:50,958
Haven't you eyes
in your head, sir?!

392
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:53,708
I tried drawing a policeman's
attention to a burglar.

393
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:56,375
It was myself
arrested for the effort.

394
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,125
I'm not the one you want!

395
00:22:58,208 --> 00:22:59,541
I can't walk down the street

396
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,750
without children
throwing rocks at me.

397
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,041
See?

398
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:04,583
I'm surprised it's only rocks.

399
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:05,791
Alas...

400
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:08,458
Perhaps I'm just not
of the vigilante mold.

401
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:12,458
I suppose it is all
rather absurd, isn't it?

402
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:13,583
Stop that!

403
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:15,416
You're just going
through a bad patch!

404
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,500
I am?

405
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:20,666
What you need is
the Diary of Justice!

406
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,875
Sorry, what?

407
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:24,333
With this baby.

408
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,458
You'll know precisely where
you're needed and by whom!

409
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:27,916
No more misunderstandings!

410
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Surely you jest!

411
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,875
It's too good to be true!

412
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:31,750
You want it?

413
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:33,250
With every fiber of my being!

414
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:34,416
But I am so poor!

415
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,958
Ho-ho!

416
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,375
It's on sale for the amazing
price of Whatever You've Got!

417
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,833
Yes, yes, yes,!!!

418
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:41,916
I shall pay you, Fifty!!!

419
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:47,666
There's a sucker
born every minute.

420
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,916
Did my good deed
for the day, though.

421
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:55,583
Hi there.

422
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:57,166
I'd like this, please.

423
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,250
That'll be sixty even.
