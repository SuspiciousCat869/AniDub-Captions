1
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,041
Yuno Gasai.

2
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,625
It appears I have my
work cut out for me.

3
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,375
"Just think of it
as an opportunity

4
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,166
to prove the cut of your jib!"

5
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,750
Good advice.

6
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,166
"Don't get so cocky you
let your guard down.

7
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,083
You're squaring off against
two players here who

8
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:49,000
have proven the cut
of their jib several times."

9
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,416
You won't be able to get
the drop on them easily;

10
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,833
they can use their diaries in
tandem to blackout your options.

11
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:55,666
Oh, yeah.

12
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,416
Something else to consider.

13
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:01,416
Your diary is just
this side of being a joke.

14
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:04,416
"Hyper Vision Diary"?

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,041
More like, 'poor
little boo-boo's

16
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,000
three-entries-per-day
picture-bo ok.'

17
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,541
Morning. Noon. Night.

18
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,791
Yeah... Seriously...
Good luck with that."

19
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,791
Three windows
of opportunity a day.

20
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,291
That's two more
than you need to win!

21
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:20,458
If I can take the lovebirds
down with one stone,

22
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:21,916
so much the better.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,166
Mom and Dad must be avenged.

24
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,750
Ha!

25
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:35,791
Who am I kidding?

26
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:37,625
I don't give a
damn about my folks!

27
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:40,208
I'm in this for sweet,
sweet victory,

28
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,041
and these two need
to be taken out.

29
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:43,875
That's all.

30
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:48,916
♪ opening song ♪

31
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:25,083
Wow... Is it me or
is that a lot of food?

32
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,333
Eat some salad!
I made it myself!

33
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,125
Our budding little sous chef
was so eager to lend a hand.

34
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,125
Nice...
Suck up.

35
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,416
Sorry, gang.
I've got to take this.

36
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:44,291
So what brought you to our
humble abode, short stuff?

37
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,250
My mommy and daddy have
to work late for a long time.

38
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,916
They wanted me
to come stay here.

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Uh...

40
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,125
Well, that was
very thoughtful of them.

41
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:57,541
The lettuce is shy, so we've got
make it dance with the cucumber.

42
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,291
Throw a couple of
special tomatoes into

43
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,666
the mix and we've
got ourselves a hoedown.

44
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,000
Grab your partners, do-si-do.

45
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,791
Not that one.

46
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,083
What is that all about?

47
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,291
Come on, Eat it!

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,333
Wait, something's not right.

49
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,250
This tomato's off.

50
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,208
It's heavier than
when I washed it.

51
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,500
Water retention?

52
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:29,666
Don't be cute.

53
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,250
I'm telling you I think
something's wrong.

54
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,333
You shouldn't eat it.

55
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,416
Better safe than sorry.

56
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,625
Observant little minx,
isn't she?

57
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,666
I think she might be
a little paranoid.

58
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,166
Whoa, why'd it do that?

59
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,833
Seriously?

60
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,458
Second is on alert,
but I wonder about First.

61
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,541
Not that it matters
one way or the other.

62
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,500
I'll get my chance.

63
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,125
Hope you're not mad at me
for throwing out the salad.

64
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,875
I mean, you put so
much work in to it.

65
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,333
That really sucks.

66
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,541
Naw.

67
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,583
You didn't want anyone
to get a tummy ache.

68
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,916
Well, it's kind of my thing to
look after people I care about.

69
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:24,000
That's why I'm going to
keep a close eye on you.

70
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:25,916
Thank you.

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,208
So adorable.

72
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:40,000
Oh, she is good.

73
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,916
I just might be in love!

74
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,125
The real measure of
an electric shock's intensity

75
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,375
isn't the voltage.

76
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,916
Currents as low as
110 volts can be fatal

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,791
under the right
circumstances.

78
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,125
And plain old table salt

79
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,750
ratchets up tap
water's conductivity.

80
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,291
Double, double,
toil and trouble.

81
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,458
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

82
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:12,583
Really? Again?
But I haven't done anything?

83
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,750
Why does the
future keep changing?

84
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,833
Crap!

85
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,958
There's got to
be another user nearby!

86
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,125
Cut it out!

87
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,291
Wait... Yuno gets electrocuted?!

88
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,333
How the hell is
that going to happen?!

89
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,958
Hey, sis.
Can I take a bath with you?

90
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:31,666
Oh...

91
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,250
Do you need help?

92
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,625
I promise not to splash.

93
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,708
I'm not going to make
it to her in time!

94
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,333
C'mon, think!

95
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,250
Damn it, there's got
to be something!

96
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,916
There's a sweet
irony to this, really.

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,791
First will go second.

98
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,250
And Second will go first.

99
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,791
Die!!!

100
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,500
Turbo!

101
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,958
Huh?

102
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,250
The circuit breaker's
been tripped!

103
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,000
Maybe First isn't so clueless.

104
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,125
Are you okay?!

105
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,625
Please tell me
this isn't happening.

106
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,500
He better not be asking me out.

107
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,458
Why'd I have
to give him my info.

108
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,500
What's this about Fifth?

109
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,750
Oh, snap...

110
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,500
Have fun taking
out a toddler, First.

111
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,708
Somehow the image
of you being terrorized

112
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,291
by a half-pint is
hilarious to me.

113
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,291
What gives?

114
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:57,666
Why's Johnny Law keeping
me in the loop about this stuff?

115
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,916
It's got to be here somewhere.

116
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,166
If the kid's a diary user,

117
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,583
then his diary's
somewhere in this house.

118
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,041
Could be anything
though, couldn't it?

119
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,916
What'd he have on him when
Mom brought him home?

120
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,125
There's a faster
solution to this.

121
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,541
Kill him.

122
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,958
Don't even start!

123
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,291
He's here to kill you.

124
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,416
It's only fair.

125
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,625
He's only a kid!

126
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,666
I don't want a toddler's
blood on my hands!

127
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,333
Look, just cut it out and
help me find his diary!

128
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,666
What if he makes another
move before we find it?

129
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,916
I...

130
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,583
Let's just hope it
doesn't come to that, okay?

131
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,083
It will.

132
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,041
I have to go and
make a number two.

133
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,458
You're not going to get
the better of me that way.

134
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:54,916
I'm far too clever
for either of you.

135
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,500
Where could a kid
his height reach easily.

136
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,375
Fail.

137
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,041
I figured we'd have a shot
if I combed the places

138
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,416
not mentioned in my diary.

139
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,125
And, bam!

140
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,333
Yeah, that was dumb.

141
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,583
Damn it, I thought I made
myself perfectly clear!

142
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,333
I'm trying to tell you:
it'll be a lot

143
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,166
quicker and easier
if we do it my way.

144
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,041
Put that down!

145
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,958
Mom's going to see you!

146
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,916
What kind of shenanigans are
those two getting up to now?

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,708
Beats me.

148
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,541
Hey, let's move to a new stage.

149
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,708
Alright. Hang on.

150
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,291
I need only continue
my infant act a bit longer.

151
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,125
At high noon,
the gloves come off.

152
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:53,666
If it's not here, I'm completely
dried up on what next.

153
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,250
We're not even close.

154
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,416
So we have confirmation
this was a bad idea,

155
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,583
seeing as he's
never left the house.

156
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:07,333
Except when mom took
him with her to the store.

157
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,750
You don't suppose he could've...

158
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,833
I mean that's a pretty
risky place to hide.

159
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,416
Hey...
Where'd you go?

160
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,041
I was talking to you.

161
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,291
No point keeping up
appearances now, huh?

162
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,000
Sounds like World War
three down there.

163
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,250
What have you done?!

164
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,958
I'm such an idiot.

165
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,666
You just had to go
with your instincts.

166
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,416
This is exactly the kind of
stupid thing I wanted to avoid!

167
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm sorry, Yuki.

168
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,708
I'm so sorry. 

169
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,000
Look...
It's okay.

170
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,416
Your heart was
in the right place.

171
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,958
What we need to
focus on now is getting

172
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,250
our hands on that
little brat's diary.

173
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,291
So, chin up.

174
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,458
I can't do it without you.

175
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,625
Yeah?

176
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,333
Something tells me
we don't have a lot of time.

177
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,666
My man needs me.

178
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,083
Besides, find the diary,
and he'll probably

179
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,750
overlook me cracking
his mom's skull.

180
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,083
Alright.

181
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm a four year old prodigy.

182
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,916
A hiding place for the
most valuable thing

183
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,083
I own only makes sense

184
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,541
if it's easily accessible,

185
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,208
practically beneath
the awareness

186
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:53,458
of my opponents,
and most of all consistent.

187
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,458
Where is it?

188
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,375
C'mon. It's staring
us in the face.

189
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:58,666
Think.

190
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,000
Whoa...!
What the hell?!

191
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,250
Holy crap.

192
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,875
Whatever it is you're doing,
just please don't be murdered!

193
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,916
The corner store
has a delivery service.

194
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I send a package.

195
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,958
I address it to myself.

196
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,833
It's almost here!

197
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,125
Just a second!

198
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,458
Stop him, Yuki!

199
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,583
That's the hiding place!

200
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,791
No you don't!!!

201
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,833
Ha ha!
Now I've got you!

202
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,458
Don't open it!

203
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,291
Excellent.

204
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,791
Yuki! No!!!

205
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:50,541
Oh god!

206
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,791
Oh god, oh god, oh god!

207
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,041
Hang in there, my love!

208
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,125
Yuno's here for you;
I'll get us out of this!

209
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,041
Victory is mine!

210
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,666
Weren't expecting a lethal
dose of nerve gas, were you?

211
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,208
People who don't
want to die unseal the

212
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,666
package from the
opposite end, you see.

213
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,291
Live and learn, I guess.

214
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,875
Don't be a party pooper.

215
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,000
You going to hole
up in there all afternoon?

216
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,625
Get out here!

217
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,458
Forget about him.

218
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:33,291
There's nothing you
can do, he's a goner.

219
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,750
Come out and play.

220
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:41,125
I was probably the one
who killed your parents.

221
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,625
Matter of fact I'm sure of it.

222
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,375
If you want revenge, take me.

223
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,250
He had nothing to do with it.

224
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,833
Aw, that's sweet but I'm
not in this for payback.

225
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,541
Thing is, I've grown
rather fond of you.

226
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,333
Butchery is just
how I express it.

227
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,875
Come out and play!

228
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,166
Fight it all you want, big sis.

229
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,583
You and I both
know we're going to

230
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,041
go at each other like animals.

231
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,750
Fine, then.
Be a bitch.

232
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,041
How about I up
the ante a little?

233
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,000
If you beat me, you get a prize.

234
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,791
The antidote!

235
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,583
We'll keep it simple and treat
this like Hide 'n Seek.

236
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:23,708
Find me, and you get to save
your stupid boyfriend.

237
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:28,333
Let the gas overcome you, and,
well I'll be the winner.

238
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,958
Mom. She's
breathing this in.

239
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,416
We have to get her out
of here before it's too late.

240
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,083
I'm not a monster.

241
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,958
I'm hardly going to let Miss
Amano suffer because of you two.

242
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,000
So are we on or what?

243
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,875
Just remember:
breathe shallow or this

244
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,041
stuff will do nasty things
to your insides!

245
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,083
And go!

246
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:49,875
Don't do it.

247
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,708
There's no way
this isn't a trap.

248
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,083
If you go out there,
he'll be waiting

249
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,166
in ambush with
something terrible.

250
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,791
How very chivalrous
of you to worry about me.

251
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,333
Thank you.

252
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,958
I'll be back with the antidote
before you know it, my darling.

253
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,625
You're crazy.

254
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,916
Doing fantastic, big sis.

255
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,833
But this is just the
start of round one.

256
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,166
How long do you
think you can hold

257
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,583
your breath or is
that a moot point?

258
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:08,250
Someone's in for a big,
gasping surprise!

259
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,375
Nerves of steel, that girl.

260
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,666
Sheesh.

261
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:23,250
I'd better find
another hiding place.

262
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,625
I so love it here!

263
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,958
Miss Amano is super nice.

264
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:39,083
I have a big brother
and sister to play with.

265
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,666
I never much cared
for my other home.

266
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,375
Who needs a dumb
old mom and dad, anyhow?

267
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,208
I'm perfectly self-sufficient.

268
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:55,416
As First and Second are
about to find out the hard way.

269
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,166
Tell me what's going on outside.

270
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,666
Please.

271
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,750
Damn it. This thing
is useless from in here.

272
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,458
I've got to make it
to the yard somehow.

273
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:13,458
Not on the first floor.
Meaning...

274
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,291
Uh-oh!

275
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,500
Looks like I'm it!

276
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,541
Bring it.

277
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,958
You've got me good
and cornered, big sis.

278
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:33,541
But I'm not as easy to
take down as all that.

279
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,333
Oh, no.

280
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,875
What do I have here?

281
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,791
Better luck next time.

282
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:51,458
Now that's what I
call a shocking victory!

283
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,291
What's happening?!

284
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,375
Explain something
to me, would you?

285
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,083
If the object of
this game is for us

286
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,416
to all slaughter each other,

287
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,625
why do you go to such
lengths protecting First?

288
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,791
You can stop holding
your breath, by the way.

289
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:16,208
I'm not in this for myself, I...

290
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,083
I protect him out of love.

291
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,083
Aw, then it's just as
well that you lose now.

292
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:31,250
It's been fun, Yuno.

293
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,541
I'm sorry, Yuki.

294
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,958
Damn it!

295
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,208
Yuki.

296
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:11,041
I'm guessing... that you
don't understand true love.

297
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,416
Guess not.

298
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:21,875
Good.

299
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,791
Good for you.

300
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,083
You're...

301
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,166
You are one amazing woman.

302
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,208
Don't worry, it's real.

303
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:37,333
It's too late to pull a
fast one on you now.

304
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,625
Still, though, is it worth it?

305
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,500
The more you win,
the closer you get to

306
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,500
what's shaping up to
be an ugly stalemate.

307
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:49,833
Eventually, there'll
be no one left to kill but him.

308
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,083
And then where will you be?

309
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:55,750
You going to protect the
man you love from yourself?

310
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,375
How is that supposed to work?

311
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:02,000
What will your love be
worth at the moment of truth?

312
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,750
Sorry, I won't be
around to see it.

313
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,250
Oh, and uh...

314
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,375
Congratulations.

315
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,500
I don't give a damn.

316
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,666
I'll protect my man from
whoever the hell I've got to.

317
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,958
Hang in there, pookie.

318
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,041
The antidote's coming.

319
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,458
A word of advice, kid.

320
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,000
Kill her.

321
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:52,666
There's only one winner to
this game, so just deal with it.

322
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,750
Push comes to shove,
mercy won't factor in

323
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,583
to how she deals with you.

So, yeah.

326
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,041
You get to be a diary user

327
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:48,041
and creatively kill a
bunch of people.

328
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,458
Cool, hey, tell me something.

329
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:52,958
Are aliens, like, real?

330
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:54,416
It stands to reason.

331
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,833
If gods are real,
surely aliens have a shot.

332
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:57,791
Uh...

333
00:22:57,875 --> 00:22:58,541
Tell you what.

334
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:00,083
I'm in.

335
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:03,625
But only and I mean only if
you show me a bona fide alien.

336
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,333
I come from beyond the stars.

337
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:12,625
Take me to your leader.

Behold.

00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,791
The Mother ship I
have traveled here in.

340
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,375
Ah, neat!

341
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:33,250
Wow, really drives home just how
insignificant we all are, huh?

342
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,291
Win this game,
and the absolute last thing

343
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:37,083
you'll ever be is insignificant!

344
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,750
Screw that, I want to
be self-sufficient!

345
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,541
Um, okay then.

346
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:55,291
Where has my saucer gone?
