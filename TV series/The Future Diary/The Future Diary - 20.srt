1
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,541
I'm sorry, love.

2
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,041
It's alright.
Let's go.

3
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,583
Are you not listening to me?

4
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:41,750
Whoever the hell that girl is,

5
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,833
she most certainly
isn't who you think!

6
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,416
Shut up!

7
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,666
I don't give a damn.

8
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,666
I should've been more persuasive

9
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,583
when making my case
for him to drop her.

10
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,708
Eleventh is John Balks,

11
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:07,333
aka the mayor of this
podunk little backwater.

12
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:11,416
Watch your ass, Eleventh.

13
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm coming.

14
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,958
We'll be splitting up
into nine teams.

15
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,916
Once a perimeter
has been established,

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,291
each team is to hold...

17
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:28,708
You can't sit on the fence.

18
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:31,166
It's Time to settle on
which side looks greener.

19
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,333
Don't whine about it.

20
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,375
This is how choices get made.

21
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:39,958
The rest of you can suck it.

22
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,375
Godhood becomes me.

23
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:47,125
Huh...
What's this crap?

24
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:50,416
Defense schematics?

25
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,333
I'll be damned.

26
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,833
This pays off the
remainder of my debt.

27
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,166
Shop's closed from now on.

28
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:05,875
♪ opening song ♪

29
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,666
Oily bastard.

30
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,333
Why this place?

31
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:54,916
The hell is all this?

32
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,541
Somewhat imposing, yes?

33
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,166
A little.

34
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,708
We call it Holon Three;

35
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,666
the third largest
supercomputer in the country.

36
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,916
Exquisitely helpful.

37
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,458
Why do I shudder to
hear you use that word?

38
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:15,541
Perhaps a pang of misgiving as
to my intentions for your diary?

39
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,500
Every man, woman and
child in Sakurami has been

40
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,416
allotted a mobile
account that routes

41
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,125
through this
magnificent pylon.

42
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,666
For what possible reason?

43
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,333
Is it not obvious?

44
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:28,083
When I connect the Propagation
Diary to Holon Three,

45
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,916
every citizen will
become a Diary Holder!

46
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,458
Empires traffic in powers

47
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,291
beyond the ken of
their vassal lands!

48
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,416
Macedonia, Rome, Germany!

49
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,250
Sakurami will stand beside
them in the annals of history!

50
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,875
A city of prophets to
which all others shall bend!

51
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:47,958
My ass!

52
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,000
You're a lunatic!

53
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,041
Que sera sera, dear.

54
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,291
Oh crap!

55
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,916
Drop this?

56
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:01,375
HQ.

57
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,041
Team Three reporting.

58
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,458
There's been an explosion!

59
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,958
The terrorist has reared her
head right on schedule.

60
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,708
Deal with her
accordingly, would you.

61
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,250
Sir.

62
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:12,833
This is some bullshit!

63
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,791
How was he not surprised?

64
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:16,750
Screw it.

65
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,666
East lab it is.

66
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,000
Team Six.

67
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,083
We'll try to grab her en route.

68
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,375
What?!

69
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,458
Someone tell Team Five
to cover the East lab, STAT!

70
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,583
What the Hell?

71
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,916
Is this a Clairvoyant
Diary type of deal?

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,125
He's culling intel
from his toadies?

73
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,541
No... They haven't
even seen me yet.

74
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,791
She'll make a b-line for
the men's dormitory.

75
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,041
Yes, sir.

76
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,875
I see all, Ninth.

77
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,541
There is no escape.

78
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,541
Team Six checking in.

79
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,500
I'm sorry.
No sign of her.

80
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,958
Do you think she's on to us?

81
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,041
Don't worry about it.

82
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,166
Keep patrolling.

83
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,416
Team Nine, head for
the women's dorm;

84
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,958
she's on her way there next.

85
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,458
If you can,
cut her off at the pass.

86
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,250
What is this?

87
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,208
Nishijima to Headquarters.

88
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,375
I just saw a person
skulking toward the quad.

89
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,166
It was definitely
no one I recognize.

90
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,916
Teams Five and Six
go check it out.

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,083
What are you trying to pull?

92
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,791
Thought we were
done with each other.

93
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,125
Well...

94
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,000
Let's just say I got tired
of sitting on the fence.

95
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,375
And here's the part where you
tell me what changed your mind.

96
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,875
Okay...

97
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,500
You did.

98
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,541
Shut the hell up!

99
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,208
I'm being proposed to?!

100
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,250
Oh god.

101
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,625
Oh god.

102
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,750
Oh god!

103
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,458
Nobody gave you permission
to put that on me!

104
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,750
Would you please
stop freaking out?

105
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,208
Excuse me for wanting more for

106
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,666
myself than being a
frigging baby factory!

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,958
I think you'd make
a wonderful mom.

108
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:14,125
You'd be wise to
surrender your diary.

109
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:17,333
Why continue to let blood
heap senselessly on blood?

110
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,583
I am asking you for your help.

111
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,416
And I believe you.

112
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,541
Too hot in here?

113
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,375
I don't wear this
to be whimsical.

114
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:33,875
You asked.

115
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,666
I'm giving it to you.

116
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,291
Don't look a gift
horse in the mouth.

117
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:43,833
Will you slow down, please?

118
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,333
At least give me
some kind of answer!

119
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,166
This isn't the
time or the place!

120
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,375
Our illustrious mayor's battier
than a chimp on speed!

121
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,250
It'd be easier to deal with him

122
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,000
if you had and
extra pair of hands.

123
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,375
Let go or you'll need them!

124
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,500
What's with you?

125
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,875
I'm not the sort of
gal who's waiting

126
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,416
for her knight in
shining armor, okay?

127
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,250
Stop acting like I'm
sentencing you to life!

128
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,666
I'd rather stamp out
license plates, actually.

129
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,500
I need you.

130
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,250
A-ha!

131
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,750
Pervert!

132
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,208
Will you give me a break here;
I'm bearing my damn soul!

133
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,833
Let's you and me make
a little agreement.

134
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,166
Help me and I'll consider
it without retching.

135
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,375
Alright.

136
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,708
Good a start as any,
under the circumstances.

137
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,083
Why is this
getting under my skin?

138
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,833
This guy's a joke.

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,208
I'm a loner.

140
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,708
A rebel.

141
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,583
I blow shit up.

142
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:37,875
We've got a visual!

143
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,541
This is Team Six we have them!

144
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,000
Case in point.

145
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,625
How much longer till the

146
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,416
Propagation Diary is
fully connected?

147
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,541
Just a matter of moments.

148
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,000
She's through here!

149
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,958
Yes she is.

150
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,416
That is so cheating!

151
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,416
Misguided fool.

152
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,750
A shambling, one-trick
pony with a diary

153
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,458
every bit as absurd as
your confidence.

154
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:16,458
The Watcher renders all
notion of escape obsolete.

155
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,041
This is the
Electronics Lab team.

156
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,791
The Assailant has been captured.

157
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,500
This is it.

158
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,166
One big, happy family, sir.

159
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,875
Sorry guys afraid you're
in for a hollow victory.

160
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,875
Follow my lead to hell.

161
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,833
Minene!

162
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,083
Are you out of your mind?
You...

163
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,083
Don't even start!

164
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,125
What the hell are you doing?!

165
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,625
Not the best
career move, really.

166
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,000
Looks like I can
say goodbye to the

167
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:06,250
moral high ground for a
little while, too, huh?

168
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,291
After all that?

169
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,833
It couldn't have been this easy,
he knew every angle.

170
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,875
No way, Mr. By the Book
surprised him.

171
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:18,000
Except he doesn't have a diary.

172
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,416
Hold on.

173
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,041
I see you're not dry-heaving.

174
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,041
Uh...

175
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,083
Slow down!

176
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,583
Come on, am
I really all that bad?

177
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,791
Look, it's complicated.

178
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,000
I...

179
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,916
um...

180
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,875
Oh god.

181
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,000
We got a code red, people.

182
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,208
A patient's threatening suicide.

183
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,666
Requesting backup.

184
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,125
Please... Come off the
ledge and let's talk about this.

185
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,250
You don't get it!

186
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,166
I die tomorrow!

187
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,666
Hey these are
tomorrow's stock prices?

188
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:06,166
We're gonna have sukiyaki
tonight, aren't we mom?

189
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,000
That's right.

190
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,958
Are you reading mom's mind?

191
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,500
Okay that's bizarre.

192
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,458
When did I post
on my blog today?

193
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,333
Crap!

194
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,375
What in the hell is going on?!

195
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,791
A testament to the power of
redundancy, don't you think?

196
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,041
The portion of Holon
Three damaged in their

197
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,541
ill-advised attack was
entirely peripheral.

198
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,833
The dawn of our glory
shall not be denied!

199
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,083
That's check and mate, boss.

200
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,500
Tough luck.

201
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,250
Ninth doesn't have a snowball's
chance in hell as long

202
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:41,250
as the nature of Eleventh's
diary stays on the DL.

203
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,958
Ah...
The silent treatment.

204
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,083
That's alright.
Things are going well.

205
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,208
Murmur.

206
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,541
That's my name.

207
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,666
I feel I should
rest for a spell.

208
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,916
Good idea; you do that.

209
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:03,208
She is up to something,
any fool could see it.

210
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,916
Should I counter her move before

211
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,458
what power I have left
deteriorates further?

212
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:12,208
Clearly, I am in need of aid.

213
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,500
I hate this.

214
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,500
They might be coming at
us with tanks for all I know.

215
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,250
Who the hell are
you trying to call?

216
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,750
I think Akise will
know what to do.

217
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,333
The twink?

218
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:31,625
Booya!

219
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,291
Totally called it!

220
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,458
Wait, you're Akise's...

221
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:36,458
What up?

222
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:39,166
Good to see you
again, detective.

223
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,750
Cool.
He beat us here.

224
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,416
Hope you haven't
been waiting long.

225
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,250
I'm not getting
why you're even...

226
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,125
Fuck me.

227
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,625
So who's got what diary?

228
00:12:56,708 --> 00:13:00,125
Feast your eyes on the badass
Neo Kousaka King Diary.

229
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,125
A block busting
play-by-play of me and

230
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,583
my posse in all our
unadulterated epic-ness!

231
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:05,583
Groan.

232
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,291
This is the friendship diary.

233
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,541
As you can guess it

234
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,041
keeps track of what I'm
doing with the peeps.

235
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,500
And I call this my
Lovely Hinata Diary.

236
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,125
It's like a digital scrapbook
of Hinata's life so far.

237
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:16,583
Hold on.
Excuse me?

238
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,166
Kind of stalkerish.

239
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,500
We haven't talked about this?

240
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,250
No!

241
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,541
No... don't read it!

242
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,875
"The nurse gave
us physicals today.

243
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,125
Hinata's boobs are,
like, humongous.

244
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,416
Hooray for."

245
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,833
Hooray for boobies!

246
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,166
Hooray for Hinata!

247
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,125
What is wrong with you!

248
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,541
Stop acting like a B!

249
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,166
You had no right to look
at it anyway--give it back!

250
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,083
Who are you people and
why the hell are you here?

251
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:43,500
Akise told me to show
up and help you guys out.

252
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,333
Said you'd be, like,
completely cut off, or whatever.

253
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,500
My diary basically told
me the same thing.

254
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,791
Mine didn't;
I was just tagging along.

255
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,291
Imagine that.

256
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,916
Checks out, I guess.

257
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,458
Where is Akise?

258
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,000
I asked him to come but he said
he was busy with something.

259
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,250
What're these Holon
things all about?

260
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:01,958
Give it.

261
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,041
Hey! It's my ass
if you break it!

262
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:05,875
Of course!

263
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,541
There's more than one!

264
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,208
Balks survived the explosion?

265
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,166
Looks like we're
gonna need some serious

266
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,000
computer geekage
in our corner on this one.

267
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,583
Or we take another crack at it.

268
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,791
According to this, the two
main units are housed on

269
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,291
the penthouse floor of
the Quad Tower downtown.

270
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,291
It's not gonna be a

271
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,791
straightforward
cord yank, though.

272
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,541
The units have to be put out of
commission simultaneously.

273
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,083
Meaning we're gonna
have to assemble a team.

274
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,750
And, we're here.

275
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:31,916
So, you know.

276
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,333
Aw, seriously.

277
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,875
Screw that, I'm putting
my foot down on this one!

278
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,666
This crazy bitch
is responsible for

279
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,250
blowing up half my damn school!

280
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,250
What I'm about to do is

281
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,041
gonna make your school
look small time.

282
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,833
You're psychotic!

283
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,958
I'll take both Quad Tower
units on my own.

284
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:53,958
You can go home.

285
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,833
Damn right we can!

286
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,416
I'm better off without you.

287
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,791
Get outta here, fur balls.

288
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,541
Is there some special reason
you chased those kids away?

289
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,583
No not really.

290
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,333
Unless you think
it's special of me not

291
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,333
to wanna see them get killed.

292
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:17,041
Same goes for you, incidentally.

293
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,333
Why are you still here?

294
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,083
Got a bun in the oven, huh?

295
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,666
Don't be a dick.

296
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,916
Get out of here.

297
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,833
I told you, I've done
my time on the fence.

298
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,083
I guess we better get a move on.

299
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,958
About damn time.

300
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,416
Son of a bitch, you're in.

301
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,875
Hey...

302
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,708
Good luck saving the city
without its resident badass!

303
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,208
You're gonna need me up there.

304
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,791
I couldn't sleep
last night thinking

305
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,375
about you two doing
this on your own.

306
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,500
I just didn't have
anything better to do.

307
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,375
Fantastic.

308
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,666
Don't worry about it,
sugar, we got this.

309
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,291
When I said resident badass,
I mean one with a weapon.

310
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,791
Let our enemies
try to pull a fast one

311
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,833
on us with this mamma
jamma in the mix!

312
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,625
I see you up there, douche bags!

313
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:18,375
Idiot.

314
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,500
I know, right?

315
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:20,583
Hey, this is brilliant!

316
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,083
Wait, that's it!

317
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,541
Bastard knew every
move I was gonna

318
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,958
make before I so
much as wriggled a toe.

319
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:30,333
But somehow Nishijima
found his blind spot.

320
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,791
What's he got that I don't?

321
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,833
Please don't be
what I think it is.

322
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,958
Deus!

323
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,625
Welcome, Ninth.

324
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,583
I've brought you here to
extend something of a proposal.

325
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,958
Excuse my caution
but we needed privacy.

326
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,875
From Murmur.

327
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,208
Sure, whatever.

328
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,000
I have a question.

329
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,000
Well?

330
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,291
Are you going to pose it or not?

331
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,291
What was that?

332
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,416
Am I losing it?

333
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,250
They've arrived.

334
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,458
What shall we do, sir?

335
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,291
They've split into two groups.

336
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,000
One's in the South Tower,
the other's in the North.

337
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,500
Both riding the
elevators to twenty.

338
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:38,833
Go time, people.

339
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,458
Operation Starling's
in full swing.

340
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,166
Intercept them when they get
off the elevators, please.

341
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,333
Kill them all as cleanly
as you possibly can.

342
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,458
Yes, sir.

343
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,166
We're in position
at the South Tower.

344
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,250
Copy that.

345
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,958
North Tower's covered.

346
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,416
Wait, what?

347
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,791
We've got nothing!

348
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,708
I beg your pardon?

349
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,333
Got you, you slippery bastard!

350
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,291
Keep tabs on us now!

351
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,291
This is not possible.

352
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:11,666
Sucks that all you can do
is spy on other diary users.

353
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,458
The Watcher's power is
unique, to say the least.

354
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,458
Do not think that because I
devised this game the concept

355
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:22,375
for it sprang from my
mind free of outside suggestion.

356
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,125
Eleventh had a formative
hand in the process.

357
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,458
Seriously?!

358
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:29,208
The diaries I must
credit to his imagination.

359
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,666
He persuaded me to
share a touch of my divinity

360
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,375
with mankind so as
to hasten its evolution.

361
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,416
It was vital that
each diary reflect the

362
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,500
personality of its user,
lest the game grow tiresome.

363
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:44,250
Together we conceived a variety
of applicable archetypes.

364
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,791
The Radar, for example,

365
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,458
whose predictions
function by proximity.

366
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:52,333
The Searcher, which foretells
the actions of a given target.

367
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:56,666
The Organizer, whose focus
is on that of a specified group.

368
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,458
The Supplier, bestowing the gift

369
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,791
of prophecy upon
third party users.

370
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:04,666
And finally, The Watcher--
Eleventh's invention a diary

371
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,333
capable of integrating
the predictions

372
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,333
of all other diaries in play.

373
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,125
So he's essentially
been monitoring the

374
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,625
rest of us from the word go.

375
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:12,875
Correct.

376
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,458
He created this game for
humanitarian purposes.

377
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:18,000
So he assured me.

378
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:19,958
Humanitarian?!

379
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,583
Are you fucking blind?!

380
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,000
I'll show you humanitarian!

381
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,666
Do your thing.

382
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,708
Already got
the entry

383
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,333
three-fourths
altered, sweetheart.

384
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:34,208
Edit our diaries,
screw with his.

385
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,875
Hey, I'm a veteran blogger:

386
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,083
bullshit entries
are my specialty.

387
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,875
Less talky, more typy.

388
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,541
We can't seem to pinpoint them.

389
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,166
Neither team can
find any trace of them

390
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,500
in the areas that
were specified.

391
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,541
A diversion.

392
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,125
Starlings tend to
travel in huge flocks,

393
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,875
making an ungodly racket.

394
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,166
Information overload
make it hard for the

395
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,083
enemy to separate
signal from static.

396
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:05,333
Have they puzzled out that
I can monitor their diaries?

397
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,375
So be it.

398
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,541
We might actually
stand a chance.

399
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:13,958
If we're lucky.

400
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,291
Please tell me when this
is all over with you'll trade

401
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,166
in the whole hard ass
shtick for a wedding ring.

402
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,500
Stop with that!

403
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,250
We've got more important
things to worry about.

404
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:23,583
No!

405
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,708
Minene!

406
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,125
You okay?!

407
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,416
Damn it, get the
hell away from me!

408
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,250
Oh fuck.

409
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:45,375
Nishijima!

410
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,625
Of course false
information plays havoc

411
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,375
on The Watcher's effectiveness.

412
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,875
Elementary.

413
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,250
And yet my diary, which
keeps meticulous track

414
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,958
of the orders you're to
give me remains unaffected.

415
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,333
The threat has passed.

416
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,916
Don't really feel like
a badass right now.

417
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
If you had quit screwing around
we wouldn't be in this mess!

418
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,375
Uh-uh.

419
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,125
Stay with me, man.

420
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,833
I'll be fine.

421
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,166
Just get out of
here while you...

422
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,250
Don't even finish that thought!

423
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,791
Damn it, listen.

424
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:23,166
There no, point
worrying about me now.

425
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:26,791
I love you!

426
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:30,041
You stupid son of a bitch!

427
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:46,375
Little too close for comfort,
don't you think?

428
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,583
First.

429
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,041
Why.

430
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,708
We've been hanging back so
you guys could lead the way.

431
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,916
We were your decoys?

432
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,541
We wouldn't have
had a prayer without ya!

433
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,833
Get those hands dirty, my love.

434
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,250
Yep! How much do
I want you right now?

435
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,583
What the hell you
think you're trying to pull?

436
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,500
Stick around,
you might learn something.

437
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,208
Hi there, Pookie.

438
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,958
Rock n' roll.

439
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,250
What are they doing here?

440
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,083
They're civilians.

441
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:25,291
That makes them useful.

442
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,208
Think about it for a minute.

443
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:28,416
Balks is the mayor.

444
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,458
He's a man of the people.

445
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:36,708
♪ closing song ♪

446
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:13,750
This ride is gonna be awesome!

447
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:15,708
I can't wait to give it a whirl!

448
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:17,958
I wouldn't get
my heart set on it.

449
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,041
What, you think I'm too
short to get on, is that it?

450
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,333
Well, they do have a sign.

451
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:26,041
I got a little
something-something' for that.

452
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:26,791
Candy?

453
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:27,875
Yeah, right!

454
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:29,291
More like chewable
growth supplements

455
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:31,833
that can futz with my age.

456
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:51,208
"I can ride the rides
today, do-dah, do-dah!

457
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:52,291
Roller-coasters 'til we spray!

458
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:53,375
Were you that
upset that you couldn't

459
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,166
go on these rides
last time around?

460
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,166
Hey, it ain't no crime to be
fun-sized, so spare me the pity!

461
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:02,000
Somebody's short-tempered.

462
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:14,083
Incoming!

463
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:22,791
Watch as Gigantic
Murmur levels the city!

464
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:25,666
Run for your lives, puny humans!

465
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:30,500
Oh I am so riding that!

466
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:33,791
I'm gonna ride it until
my butt goes numb!

467
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:34,791
Hey, lady?

468
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:36,125
Speak, primate.

469
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:38,375
The train well, it's meant
for grade-school kids,

470
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:39,375
so you're outta luck.

471
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:40,375
Are you serious?

472
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:43,500
But I love the little train!

473
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:51,750
Son of a--!
