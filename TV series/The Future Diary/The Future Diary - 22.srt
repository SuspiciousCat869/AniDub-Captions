1
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:41,208
I had wondered how long
it would be ere your quest

2
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:45,083
for answers brought you hither
to my chamber, Aru Akise.

3
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:46,708
Far be it from me to deny that

4
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:49,541
boon to so dedicated
a supplicant.

5
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,416
Good luck, Aru.

6
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,958
I hope you know
what you're doing up here.

7
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:06,583
Should Yuki win this game
and ascend to my throne,

8
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,250
you wish to know if
he can rouse the

9
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:11,916
recent dead from their
sanguinary slumber.

10
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:15,166
The answer is...

11
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,458
♪ opening song ♪

12
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,666
Can't you type any faster?

13
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,291
I'm doing the best I
can here, slow your roll!

14
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,500
Please be okay.

15
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,166
Why didn't I see it sooner?!

16
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,791
Aw, crap!
Did he just figure it out?!

17
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:10,875
This is bad.

18
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,208
Yuki needs to hear
about this new wrinkle!

19
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,333
Guess again, Sherlock!

20
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,166
Deus?
What gives?!

21
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,375
I fear such a
mission of elucidation

22
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,958
is not in the cards for you,

23
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:28,041
as it is your fate to perish
here alongside me, Aru.

24
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,541
After all, you're the Observer.

25
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,291
Under normal circumstances,

26
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,875
nothing can occur
without my knowing it.

27
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,708
But in these days of
war among the diary users,

28
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,083
the future changes
course far too often

29
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,250
to properly gauge from afar.

30
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,833
I needed a man on
the ground, as it were.

31
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:49,166
Someone to note alterations
as they occurred.

32
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,291
That is why...

33
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:57,000
I imbued you with such ravenous
curiosity when I created you.

34
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,708
Deus created me?

35
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,500
Is that possible?

36
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:04,041
You are a construct... a
reconnaissance device that has

37
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,875
been granted the desire and
the cognitive wherewithal

38
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,708
to broaden its body
of knowledge.

39
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:14,666
Now you will die and return
unto the Akashic Records.

40
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,791
The Akashic Records?

41
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,083
A heavenly storehouse
of knowledge,

42
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:22,875
wherein all defining
events are duly chronicled.

43
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,250
My body, it's!

44
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,833
Ponder this as you cease to be.

45
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,625
You think yourself
to have tracked

46
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,250
the keepers of your
own volition,

47
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:34,250
but no such choice
was ever afforded you.

48
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,791
What are you saying?

49
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,166
You collected
information because

50
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,125
it was my will that you do so.

51
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:40,958
You're wrong!

52
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:41,833
I'm not a puppet!

53
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,250
I am my own man!

54
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,083
If it's proof you want, I shall
explain how your deeds one and

55
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:51,916
all were all undertaken at my
unspoken behest, my dear Aru.

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,250
But as I am a benevolent god,
I shall grant you this chance.

57
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,125
If you can make
manifest any moment

58
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:00,208
that speaks to
your supposéd free will.

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,541
I'll allow your
existence to continue.

60
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,875
The case of Tenth,
the dog-trainer.

61
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:11,083
I shadowed him of
my own accord, didn't I?

62
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:14,500
I needed confirmation of his
actions while he was in hiding.

63
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,125
Thus, you supplied
said assurance.

64
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,708
What about my probing into
Yuno's background?!

65
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,125
She is a key player
in this game.

66
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,416
You really think I would allow

67
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,708
such a creature to
remain a cipher?

68
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,625
I risked my life to save Eighth!

69
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,250
I wanted Second's
murderous ways be kept in

70
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:34,083
check at that particular
moment, and you obliged.

71
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,375
Dude, it's crunch-time!

72
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:37,750
C'mon!

73
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,083
I know that, Hinata!

74
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,958
But Aru's handwriting
is really frigging small!

75
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:46,500
One last chance to
prove me wrong, lad.

76
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,458
What was the
strongest emotion that

77
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,708
drove you during your
time in this world?

78
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:55,625
The strongest... emotion.

79
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,291
It was my...

80
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,083
My love for Yuki.

81
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,041
It's real.

82
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,083
I feel it, even now.

83
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:09,333
That love was
nothing but an illusion.

84
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,125
Game over, Aru.

85
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,291
It appears every
action you undertook

86
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,625
was simply that of a thrall.

87
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,416
You're wrong!

88
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:26,250
Is this Future Diary I'm holding
part of your master plan?!

89
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,875
A diary that exists to keep
tabs on other users.

90
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,583
But how?

91
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:35,875
I had Eighth turn my phone into
a diary subordinate to hers.

92
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,833
Perhaps I was
your unwitting Observer,

93
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,416
Deus but that changes now.

94
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,208
I'm neither your eyes,
nor a tool of your will.

95
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,916
I'm going back to Earth
to change the future

96
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,208
because Aru Akise
is not a drone!

97
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:52,541
I'm saving Yuki if
it's the last thing I do!

98
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,958
Those are the words
of one who answers

99
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,750
to no god, one
who has chosen to live.

100
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,375
It would appear you
have slipped free

101
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,916
from your tethers on this day.

102
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,375
Get thee hence, Aru Akise.

103
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:12,291
Alter the future while there
is still a future to change.

104
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:21,500
If we're gonna save the world,
there's only one way to do it.

105
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,750
Meet up with Aru and the
others, put a bullet in Eighth,

106
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,166
and undo it all as
soon as I'm god.

107
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,375
I know it sucks,
but I'm glad they ultimately

108
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,750
see eye-to-eye with
me and Yuno on all this.

109
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,458
I mean, it's not like
I'm gonna drag it out.

110
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,125
Yuki, wait.

111
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,000
We got to go, Yuno.

112
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,291
We're kind of
on a deadline here.

113
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,333
I need to ask you
something important.

114
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,583
Okay but make it quick.

115
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,666
Sweetie... if Aru and
the others tried to

116
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,541
sell you out at the last moment,

117
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,375
would you be able to kill them?

118
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,041
Why would you
say something like that?

119
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,000
Be honest with me.

120
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,458
I have to know
what you would do.

121
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,500
No one's gonna betray anyone.

122
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:07,125
These guys have stuck by
me through everything.

123
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,958
Speak of the devil.

124
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,375
What's up, Yuki?

125
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,916
Where is everybody?

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,333
I thought they were here.

127
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:16,375
We need to kill Eighth.

128
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,041
Where the hell is she?!

129
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,416
Don't make me ask you again.

130
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,041
I have a bit of private
business with Yuki.

131
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:26,666
Not to be rude, but could you
make yourself scarce?

132
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,416
No!
What have you done?!

133
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,416
You stabbed him.

134
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,000
Up there!

135
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,541
They're moving Eighth
to higher ground!

136
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,416
Go get her!

137
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,041
He wanted to talk to
me and now he's dead.

138
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,875
Now you understand
why I was asking?

139
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,083
Your so-called friends
betrayed you, darling.

140
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,458
That's under some debate.

141
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,875
How did you survive her attack?!

142
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,000
I wasn't sure that I would.

143
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,791
He's wearing body armor!

144
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,708
Armor's not gonna
shield you from this!

145
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,375
A rubber glove?!

146
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,375
But how could you have known?!

147
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,416
What the hell?

148
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,500
This fight should be over.

149
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:23,791
According to my diary,

150
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,208
she knocks Aru unconscious
with that stun gun.

151
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,958
But that's two for
two he saw coming.

152
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,583
We're not gonna
win this one, Yuno!

153
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,666
Sure we can it's
two against one!

154
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,833
I knew you'd figure it out.

155
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,250
Thanks to Eighth,

156
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,458
and the miracle that is
modern technology,

157
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,541
my cell-phone is now the one
that watches the watchmen.

158
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,333
I know everything your
diaries will say as well

159
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,291
as the changes in the
future your actions will cause.

160
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:51,291
My Detective Diary, Mark Two.

161
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,958
I'm sorry, but I've been
playing the both of you

162
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,166
like a fiddle since you arrived.

163
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,208
Go, Yuki!
Eighth is getting away!

164
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,791
Don't worry!
I'll keep this bastard busy!

165
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,625
But...

166
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,708
Akise totally called it,
you guys.

167
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:11,958
Yuno's been lying to Yuki
about all this from the start.

168
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,833
We have to get him out of
that psycho's clutches.

169
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,125
'Cause that's
what friends are for.

170
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,750
Am I right?

171
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:19,750
I don't get it.

172
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,750
Why are they
helping her escape?!

173
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,166
How could Aru sell
me out like this?!

174
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,375
I want to trust them.

175
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,833
But...

176
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,291
You seemed like
someone I'd want to know.

177
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,000
Hinata.

178
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,333
I'm sorry, but if
you're not behind me

179
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:38,875
on this all bets are off.

180
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,500
Stop, Yuki!

181
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,500
It's you.

182
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,041
And Eighth!

183
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,166
This has got to stop!

184
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,500
Killing her isn't the answer!

185
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,041
If you do this, things are
only gonna get worse!

186
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:51,708
Dammit, Hinata!

187
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:52,625
Get out of the way!

188
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:53,500
Listen to me!

189
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,708
Yuno has been lying to you!

190
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,333
You can't just kill
people and fix it later!

191
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,291
Even if you become a god,
once folks are dead,

192
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,416
they can't come back!

193
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,208
I have a confession to make.

194
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,708
I tricked you.

195
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,333
You stayed behind under the
auspices of keeping me here,

196
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,416
but really that's
precisely what I wanted.

197
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,958
You see, I had to get
you away from Yuki.

198
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:29,291
As our stalemate unfolds Hinata
is telling Yuki the truth.

199
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,458
The scales will
fall from his eyes

200
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,166
and your spell on him
will be broken.

201
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,708
How was that of benefit to you?!

202
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,083
I can't get the jump on you
thanks to that diary.

203
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,250
So I let you defeat me here,
just as it predicted you would.

204
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,458
What do you do, smarty-pants?

205
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,916
You could go
traipsing off to Yuki

206
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,250
and leave me here to bleed out.

207
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,791
You know you want to.

208
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,708
But, what's Yuki gonna
say if I die here?

209
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:04,916
Losing his beloved?

210
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,958
That's gonna crush him.

211
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,083
You're saying...

212
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,666
I couldn't bring back the dead?

213
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,166
But I'll be a god!

214
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,625
What the hell kind of a god
can't resurrect dead people?!

215
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,708
Of course I'll bring them back!

216
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,666
Maybe you can
bring back their bodies

217
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,875
but their souls aren't
gonna be inside them.

218
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,000
Look, it's the truth.

219
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,541
Aru heard it straight from Deus.

220
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,666
Dammit, Hinata.
That doesn't even make sense!

221
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,750
You're saying...

222
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,041
I can't resurrect
everyone I killed?

223
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,750
Face the facts they are gone!

224
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,333
But, if that's true,
Mom and Dad are...

225
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,375
I'm sorry.

226
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,875
Them too.

227
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,000
Why're you lying?!

228
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,833
Some things are too
big to take back.

229
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,458
That's the way life
has always worked.

230
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,666
Don't you get it?

231
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,500
Dead is dead.

232
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:04,666
But I've got a list.

233
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:13,125
I never thought she'd resort
to practically gutting herself.

234
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,166
The situation's too volatile
I have to get him out!

235
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,583
A busy signal?

236
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,083
That doesn't make any sense.

237
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,375
Who could he possibly
be talking to right now?!

238
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,583
But of course!

239
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,541
Oh god, Yuki help me!

240
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:29,666
He's got the knife!

241
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,208
He's gonna kill me!

242
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,375
Yuno, what's going on?!

243
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,166
Aru, no!

244
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,416
Is she telling me
Aru stabbed her?!

245
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,750
Don't be fooled
by their lies, Yuki!

246
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,708
Your future diary doesn't record
anything about yourself,

247
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,416
but mine does, remember?!

248
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,583
Mine watches your back!

249
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,041
Tells me everything!

250
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,750
Please, you have to believe me!

251
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,125
They don't want you to win!

252
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,625
They're the enemy!

253
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,250
You lied to me.

254
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,416
Why would you do that?

255
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,583
What?!
I didn't!

256
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,958
Oh yeah?!
Why did the future change, huh?!

257
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,625
Why did Aru cut up Yuno?!

258
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:01,625
Yuki, just listen to me!

259
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,000
Don't you say another word!

260
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,333
Shut up!

261
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,875
Hey! Why the hell
would I lie to you, dumbass?!

262
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,000
We're friends, remember?!

263
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:09,791
Hinata! No!

264
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,791
What have you done, Yuki?!

265
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,333
It's her fault I shot her.

266
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,958
She kept lying
about Mom and Dad.

267
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm gonna bring
them back to life.

268
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,291
If we're supposed to be friends,

269
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,875
why'd you keep lying
to me about it?!

270
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:36,541
I'm gonna bring everybody back.

271
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,708
I didn't hit anything major.

272
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:45,041
But I'd still be dead if
Aru hadn't patched me up.

273
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:48,291
That trick's only
gonna work once.

274
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:52,958
If I'm going to kill Aru I need
to change up my tactics.

275
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,500
Stand aside Mao.

276
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,041
Stand aside, dammit!

277
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,291
Eighth is going to die.

278
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,291
You know what you are, Yuki?!

279
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,500
You're a coward!

280
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,041
Hinata told you the truth,
which is more

281
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,958
than Yuno has
ever cared enough to do!

282
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,125
And you knew she was right.

283
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,625
You knew it!

284
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:15,208
But it wasn't the truth Mr.
Future Diary wanted to hear!

285
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,125
You helped her patch
things up with her father.

286
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,708
You don't know
what that meant to her.

287
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,041
She thought the world of you.

288
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,291
And you killed her!

289
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,500
I have plenty of bullets left.

290
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,166
Don't make me use them, Kousaka.

291
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,708
I'm not gonna make you do
anything, you piece of crap.

292
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,291
That's on you.

293
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,166
You make me sick.

294
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,666
Always did.

295
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,666
You wanna know why?

296
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,166
'Cause I'll tell ya.

297
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,125
You're always crying.

298
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,625
Sniffling away like
a weak little bitch!

299
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,125
Aw, look at poor Yuki!

300
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,458
What's the matter are you
gonna start crying little baby?!

301
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:04,708
You don't get to cry,

302
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,750
not after what you just
did to Hinata and Mao!

303
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:07,916
You killed your own friends!

304
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,416
Has that penetrated--

305
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,875
W-What'd I just say?

306
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:23,833
You don't have any
right to cry you bastard.

307
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,041
Please, Yuki don't go yet!

308
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:38,958
Aru.

309
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,833
You shot them down, didn't you.

310
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:46,083
Yeah, I did and I'm gonna
do the same to you.

311
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,500
Looking at their corpses,

312
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,708
I realize that I
underestimated Yuno.

313
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,916
I regret not killing her
when I had the chance.

314
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,041
Before she filled that
trusting head of yours

315
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,750
with her vile
machinations and lies.

316
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,291
If so, our friends
would still be alive.

317
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,625
I'm here because
I want to protect you.

318
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,458
If nothing else, please believe

319
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:09,875
that keeping you safe
is my top priority.

320
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,708
According to my newly
prognosticative diary.

321
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,458
I'll be killing Yuno just a
few minutes from now.

322
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,708
What?!

323
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,166
It's for your own good.

324
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:23,958
Stay back!

325
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,291
Any closer and I'll shot!

326
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,625
You have to face
the facts, Yuki!

327
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,666
When the time is right,
she's going to murder you!

328
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,541
The dead cannot be renewed!

329
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,208
And if you're asking yourself
why Yuno would let you assume

330
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,791
otherwise it's because
she needed you to kill

331
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,916
without hesitation and
endure to the endgame!

332
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,750
She means full well
to succeed Deus!

333
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,500
It seems you're out
of bullets, my friend.

334
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,291
Get away from him!

335
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,708
He's dangerous, pookie!

336
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,291
He tried to kill me!

337
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,708
Yuno.

338
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,541
You deserve someone who
will always tell you the truth.

339
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,541
You kissed me.

340
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,416
When I get a hold of you...

341
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,375
I'm gonna gut you like a fish!

342
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,083
Ah!

343
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,875
I should have let you bleed out
when I had the chance, Yuno.

344
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,125
This time around.

345
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,125
I mean to end you!

346
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,250
No, don't do this!

347
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,791
Aru's diary says it's a
fight to the death this time.

348
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,583
One that he wins.

349
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,375
If you challenge him again.

350
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,791
I'm gonna send you to hell!

351
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,333
You should be dead right now.

352
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,416
She has two?

353
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,791
What's going on?

354
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,125
I broke her phone and
she's none the worse for wear.

355
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,458
A decoy?

356
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:06,875
No, couldn't have been.

357
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,791
The screen flickered
as it snapped.

358
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,000
I heard it crackle with the

359
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,666
sound of the future
changing course.

360
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,666
"Amano"?!

361
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,375
Yuno always calls
him Yuki in her entries.

362
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,291
That phone was a
Future Diary I'm sure of it.

363
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:27,208
But not hers, or she
would've twisted into oblivion.

364
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,041
Who the hell's was it?!

365
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,458
Yuno.

366
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,625
You're bleeding.

367
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,625
I've got it bandaged up.

368
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,125
How bad is he?

369
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,458
Later, darling he's
not going anywhere.

370
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,416
Killing Eighth should be
next on our to-do list, right?

371
00:19:56,333 --> 00:20:00,541
I saw Aru break your cell-phone
right before you cut his throat.

372
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:01,916
Just a decoy.

373
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,291
And thankfully,
he took the bait!

374
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,583
One quick jab to the aorta.

375
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:13,125
Then you can bring back your mom
and dad as good as new, Yuki!

376
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,583
Don't even think about it.

377
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,833
Either way, Eighth is dead.

378
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:17,791
Listen to me!

379
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,583
Yuno has been lying to you!

380
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:20,791
You know what you are, Yuki?!

381
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,500
You're a coward!

382
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,708
Yuki.

383
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,875
Make this a world where the
children can all live in peace.

384
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,583
I will gladly die for that.

385
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,583
There's no turning back.

386
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:42,333
Yuno and I, are all that's left.

387
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:49,958
There's the real Yuno Gasai,
and the girl who took her place.

388
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,208
Three bodies in their backyard.

389
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:55,833
Two were the corpses
of Yuno's adoptive parents.

390
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,041
The last one matched the DNA

391
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,750
from the real Yuno's
umbilical cord.

392
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:04,208
Ergo, the Yuno we've
known is the interloper.

393
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,458
But, this one had
two Future Diaries.

394
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,250
So did she steal the
real Yuno's phone?

395
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,250
No.

396
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,458
The real Yuno was never
part of Deus's game.

397
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,500
Why were there two diaries?

398
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,458
It makes no sense.

399
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,625
The third corpse.

400
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,833
The real Yuno Gasai.

401
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,041
A death match
to replace a deity.

402
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,250
A pair of Future Diaries.

403
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,958
A pair.

404
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,500
There are two?!

405
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:49,375
He's alive?

406
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,208
Can't talk with
a severed windpipe.

407
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,375
But I can tell him...

408
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,666
I thought that you killed him.

409
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,916
I can warn Yuki
in another fashion.

410
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:05,791
Yuno!

411
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:06,583
Don't do this!

412
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:09,041
He's not a threat anymore!

413
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:19,416
I need to warn my beloved Yuki.

414
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:36,500
♪ closing song ♪

415
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,625
I am known as Deus Ex Machina ♪

416
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:16,458
the lord and master of
space and time.

417
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:19,833
As such,
my vigil is never-ending.

418
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:22,875
On this day, just
as on any other,

419
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:26,083
my duty demanded the
whole of my attention.

420
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:29,291
Hey, Deus.

421
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:31,625
I'm kind of antsy,

422
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:33,750
so I'm gonna go out
and play for a little while.

423
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,416
Very well.

424
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,416
Do not tarry overlong.

425
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:42,083
My strength is much
reduced as of late.

426
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:46,000
I think the boatman will
earn his pay soon enough.

427
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:48,541
An ambitious human
approached me recently,

428
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:50,916
proposing a game of
sorts through which my

429
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,333
inevitable successor
could most easily be chosen.

430
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:58,458
It is a matter of no small
concern, as I well know.

431
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:02,541
However, it is not
my only responsibility.

432
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:09,041
What's for dinner tonight?

433
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,500
What would you like?

434
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:12,500
I want curry!

435
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:13,708
It's really yummy!

436
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:16,083
But we had curry
yesterday, you silly goose.

437
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:18,041
How about meat, then!

438
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,541
A lot of things
are meat, sweetie!

439
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:20,833
What kind do you want?

440
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:23,000
Something made of pork!

441
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,916
Murmur thinks Deus
is the bee's knees.

442
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:03,666
I couldn't spare
the time to pick her up

443
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:07,416
that day but that
is just what I did.
