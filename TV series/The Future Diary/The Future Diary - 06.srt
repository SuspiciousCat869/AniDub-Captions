00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:37,791
I really need to start using my
diary for more practical things.

3
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,375
If I had known she
was going to be late,

4
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,166
I wouldn't have gotten
here at four on the dot.

5
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,666
Hey! Hey!
There he is!

6
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,875
Sorry, champ.
You wait long?

7
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,125
Yep.

8
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,916
I swear you'd think
I'd been gone a year

9
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,291
as much as you've grown.

10
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:59,208
Yeah, well it's only been
a month so whatever.

11
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,375
Here he goes with the attitude.

12
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,291
This is not going
to be a good day.

13
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,666
This is my mom.

14
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,500
She's a big shot game
developer, or whatever.

15
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:12,500
She travels a lot for work
which, honestly, I'm fine with.

16
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,666
Then I guess it'll
be my default.

17
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,625
Steak hamburguesa.

18
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,666
So why did the
brass let you off?

19
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,458
Um.

20
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:20,458
Something.

21
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:21,833
Kind of came up.

22
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:24,083
I'll explain it to you later.

23
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,125
Change of subject.

24
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:29,000
Some lucky cheerleader
make my son a man yet?

25
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,833
Ugh! What is wrong with you?!

26
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,375
C'mon, you can tell me.

27
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,833
Most moms freak out
about that kind of thing.

28
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:35,750
Well, sure.

29
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,041
'Cause they're idiots.

30
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,125
Sorry.

31
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,666
Crazy stalker's
the best I got for you.

32
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,125
Uh, Yuki.

33
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,666
Was the window
broken before you left, or?

34
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,958
So...
That's a no.

35
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,458
Oh no.

36
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,208
Uh, yeah! It was me.

37
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,208
I was rough-housing,
or whatever would cause that.

38
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,541
Why don't you get dinner
started and I'll go wash up!

39
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,208
Yuki!

40
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,625
Of all the days for
her to pull this!

41
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,333
Welcome back home, my love.

42
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,625
We're not playing house!

43
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,625
What the hell are you
even doing here?!

44
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,625
It's okay,
I'm just trying to make a

45
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,500
good impression on your mom.

46
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,541
We want her to like me, right?

47
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,750
Scrub, scrub, Scrub, scrub.

48
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,875
Oh, hello.

49
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,958
Wow, that smells amazing.

50
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,833
Get out of here
before she sees you!

51
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,333
I want to meet her.

52
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,291
Damn it.

53
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,458
Uh.

54
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,500
C'mon.

55
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,583
Since when do you cook?

56
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,041
Son of a!

57
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,708
The jig is up if
you don't think fast!

58
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,083
Last I checked you
couldn't even boil water.

59
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,458
This is the part where
you tell me I look pretty.

60
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,916
Hey, Julia Child.

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,958
I'm talking to you.

62
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,333
Crap!
What am I gonna do?!

63
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,916
Are you in your room?

64
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,375
What's that all about?

65
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,041
Oh, just...
Stretching.

66
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,125
You know.

67
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,583
So, yeah, dinner's on me, huh?

68
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,791
You can't leave the stove on
while you're not here, doofus!

69
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:11,791
Sorry.

70
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,625
I'm still new to
the whole concept.

71
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,541
Not good, It isn't
like Yuno was just

72
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,750
in the neighborhood and
decided to drop by.

73
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,791
She's got it in her head
to make friends with mom.

74
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,541
Oh wow.
Cleaning too, huh?

75
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,875
Yes?

76
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,916
Who are you and what
have you done with my Yuki?

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,166
Bet you're surprised.

78
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,500
Oh wow, she sounds
like a total angel.

79
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,875
I've got to meet her!

80
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,416
Let me out.

81
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,583
Hey.
Was that...

82
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,708
Was that a girl's
voice I just heard?

83
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,416
Probably just
the house settling.

84
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:52,500
Let me outta here.

85
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:53,625
Ah!

86
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,166
You're telling me
you don't hear that?

87
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,833
Seriously, do you lift weights

88
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,708
in your spare time
or something?!

89
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,625
Knock it off!

90
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,791
Son of mine.

91
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,125
What's up?

92
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,125
Care to tell me why you're
arguing with a closet?

93
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,958
What?
Nobody's arguing.

94
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,125
Normally this is called leaning.

95
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,041
You must think
I was born yesterday.

96
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:16,208
Do you really think I
can't see you straining.

97
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,208
My poor child.

98
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,750
Trying so valiantly
to hide his little girlfriend.

99
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,375
That's my cue!

100
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,041
Time to push out
and say "Hi, Mom!"

101
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:29,541
Move it, kid.

102
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:30,708
This is pointless.

103
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:31,708
Yuki.

104
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,083
--Open the door!
--Open the door!

105
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,333
She's out of bounds!

106
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,375
You did not just do that!

107
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,875
Oh, you're in for it now!

108
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,291
Best let the woman
cool her jets a bit.

109
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,041
Why are you looking at those?!

110
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,541
Or, an even better
question maybe...

111
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,416
Why are they here?

112
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,875
So, Yuno Gasai.

113
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,916
Mercy, how incredibly
adorable are you?!

114
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,083
Why anyone would want
to keep a girl like this a

115
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,125
secret from their
mother is beyond me.

116
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,458
Oh, just look at her face.

117
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,791
This may be the
worst day of my life.

118
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,291
Uh, excuse me, ma'am, but,

119
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:38,208
I steamed some vegetables
if you'd like to try a bite.

120
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,666
Interesting.

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,416
Good luck with that, Yuno.

122
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,833
Mom's a confirmed foodie.

123
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,291
There's not a pickier
palate in the world

124
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,625
when it comes to culinary stuff.

125
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,750
Ah! Well done,
my dear!

126
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,375
You're pulling my leg, right?

127
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,041
That's some serious
talent you've got.

128
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,458
Very impressive.

129
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,333
You've practically got a little
showcase going on here.

130
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,583
I know Home Ec prodigies
when I see them.

131
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,041
Thank you!

132
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,375
This family could
use a gal like you.

133
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:10,708
You think?!

134
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,500
Oh, I'd love to get you
in a fancy wedding dress.

135
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,708
Or, something more
traditional, maybe.

136
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,958
Are we talking a
Shinto ceremony?

137
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,666
Modernism's got
it's good points too.

138
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,541
Why do I get the feeling the

139
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:24,250
rest of my life hangs
in the balance?

140
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,500
Where do the years go?

141
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,250
Kids grow up so fast,
one minute you're

142
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,916
buying them cereal,
the next cruise vouchers.

143
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,708
There's hardly time to
get a handle on them

144
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,375
before they've plunged
right into adulthood.

145
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,125
Son of mine.

146
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,125
Oh god!

147
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,125
Birds and Bees time.

148
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,125
Seal the deal!

149
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,583
Oh wow.

150
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,291
Don't think I would pimp
my boy out to anyone.

151
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,833
You seem like a nice girl.

152
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,750
Really, ma'am,
that's very sweet.

153
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,333
I'm not late to the party, am I?
Have you two already done it?

154
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,250
I hate my life.

155
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,625
Well...

156
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,541
Damn.

157
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,083
They definitely yanked
it out like a pro.

158
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,000
You going to start
referring patients to him?

159
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
I know that tone.

160
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,041
Here you go.

161
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,250
Right color and everything.

162
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,083
Just understand...
you're probably gonna look a

163
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,333
little wall-eyed before you
get the hang of it.

164
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,333
So, who was this beast
who got the best of you?

165
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,875
Shut up.

166
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,583
Unless you got a death wish you
need to change the subject.

167
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,041
So testy.

168
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,208
Hope you don't
lose the other eye.

169
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,666
Shove it, pops.

170
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,250
When'd you go
kid clinic, by the way?

171
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,458
Oh, that.

172
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,541
Sad story, actually.

173
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,166
You're looking at
the real casualties

174
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,250
of the Omekata Cult massacre.

175
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,916
Most of them probably
saw their folks die.

176
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,708
They were in the shrine?

177
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,125
Child Welfare wants me to

178
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,875
evaluate them for
foster placement.

179
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:59,000
This is a legit doctor's office
two thirds of the time.

180
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:02,416
Official word on the cult's
death was mass suicide;

181
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,041
which, when you think about it,
isn't exactly a hard sell.

182
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,291
Particularly when the
truth puts their blood on

183
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,541
the hands of an axe-wielding
teenage cupie doll.

184
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,000
I imagine the powers
that be don't want these

185
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,833
kids clamoring for blood
when they get older.

186
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,000
You know what...?

187
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,333
Revenge sucks.

188
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,916
Believe me.

189
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,666
A kid's parents are
supposed to die first.

190
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,458
Oh, wait.
Get a load of him in this one.

191
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,708
Look at those cheeks!

192
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,333
Can you believe he
was ever this small?

193
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,416
Or ever not such a
royal pain in the kiester?

194
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,875
--He's not that bad.
--This is so humiliating.

195
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,583
Defending him now, are we?

196
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:42,916
Oh, Mom.

197
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,166
A-ha!

198
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,083
And this was his first
ever swimming lesson.

199
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,041
Aw!

200
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,625
Look at those cheeks!

201
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,583
What the hell pictures
are they looking at?

202
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,708
Somebody was P.O.'ed
about wetting the bed, huh?

203
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,208
What are you showing her?!

204
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,375
Mom!

205
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,208
Baby pictures.

206
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,291
You pervert!
I'm naked in all of these!

207
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,583
It's not like I let you go au
natural till you were twelve.

208
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,916
Can you two please just
look at something else?

209
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,500
If you want.

210
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,500
I can always show her my record
of when you got the chicken pox.

211
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,500
I hate my life.

212
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,875
If I'd known this was
going to be my day

213
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,541
when I woke up this morning.

214
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,583
And we're out.

215
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,208
Of course.

216
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,500
Here you go.

217
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,458
Sorry.

218
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,625
Get out!

219
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,333
The next melee
should be intriguing.

220
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:52,291
The whole shebang
is spicy if you ask me.

221
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:55,750
Every diary an extension
of the user's personality.

222
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,250
Less an extension
than a microcosm,

223
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,833
I think, but spicy all the same.

224
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,375
Uniqueness of character was my

225
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,166
chief criterion when
selecting participants.

226
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:11,166
Sure makes whoever's going to
succeed you anybody's guess.

227
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,750
You know, in theory the game

228
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,750
could go on
forever, couldn't it?

229
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,208
Might be a while
before they weed

230
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,083
each other out of the running.

231
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,041
I mean, rules are rules

232
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,166
and there're still nine
users in the mix.

233
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,583
Let's keep our fingers
crossed you can hold out.

234
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:25,958
Heh.

235
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,416
If they piddle around you'll
turn into Humpty Dumpty.

236
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,208
Doesn't surprise me.

237
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,208
He's had a keen eye for
other people's business

238
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,000
ever since he was a little boy.

239
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,500
Matter of fact, a month ago...

240
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,291
Oh, almost forgot.

241
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,666
My being here?

242
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,791
Work's given me paid
leave for the next three days.

243
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,291
Something the matter?

244
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,666
Well, uh...

245
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,166
Have you kids by any chance
been following the news

246
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,750
about that nutty suicide cult?

247
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,083
Yeah.

248
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:56,250
Well, turns out one of my
coworkers was a member.

249
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,500
They left behind a child and
the company wants me to

250
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,958
look after it while they
arrange things long-term.

251
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,083
How old a kid are
we talking about?

252
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,583
Two or three, I believe.

253
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,083
It's a little boy.

254
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:09,208
I offered to let him stay
here for a few days.

255
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,833
Best get ready for bed, Yuno,

256
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,500
it's too late to
let you walk home.

257
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,416
Uh, I don't think
that's a good idea!

258
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,833
Thank you.
You're so considerate.

259
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,541
But...

260
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,750
Oh crap!!!!

261
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:27,666
There's like five
other rooms she could

262
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,416
be crashing in besides mine!

263
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,750
Cut out the Puritan act.

264
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,000
All I ask is that you
try to keep it down.

265
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,000
Night-night.

266
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,291
Have fun storming the castle.

267
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,916
And keep that rascal
wrapped till you're married.

268
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:00,625
I hate life.

269
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:08,708
Screw that!

270
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,416
Hell no!

271
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,458
Sweetie, I'll leave
a fresh towel

272
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,583
for you on the vanity, okay?

273
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,625
You're the awesome-est mom ever.

274
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,791
Feel free to use my
body-wash, if you want.

275
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,583
Trust me, it's like
giving your skin a

276
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,583
dress rehearsal for the
post-party afterglow.

277
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,291
Okay.

278
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,541
One more thing, hon.

279
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:33,708
Yes ma'am?

280
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,541
Take good care of my boy, huh?

281
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,000
He's worth it.

282
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,375
Right.
Good night.

283
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:47,166
She's such a good mom.

284
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,250
The first time I have
a girl stay the night

285
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,833
and it's got to be a nut case.

286
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:21,708
Hey.

287
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:22,958
You going to put the
moves on me or not?

288
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,875
I'm going with or not.

289
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,250
Aw, loosen up.

290
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,083
Your mom said it's okay
if we mess around.

291
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:30,708
Look...

292
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,625
You're nice but I just
don't see you that, way.

293
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:33,541
Give it time.

294
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:34,916
Excuse me?

295
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,083
You're totally going to fall
in love with me soon.

296
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:37,833
Yeah?

297
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,666
What makes you so sure?

298
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,750
On the twenty-eighth
of July, we take things

299
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,125
to the next level and
become lovers.

300
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,416
See?

301
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,291
Uh.

302
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,541
You do know it's my prerogative
to change that future if I want.

303
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:52,750
That's fine.

304
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,958
And suddenly it's
fine just like that?

305
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,500
Would it kill you to make some
sense every once in a while?

306
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,541
Our happy ending
is what it is, Yuki.

307
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,916
I've got news for you,
if I don't like it, I'm...

308
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,041
Let's get something,
straight, kay?

309
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:10,166
It's my happy ending, too...
doesn't matter what you do.

310
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,333
Yuno.

311
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,916
On July 28th, it happens.

312
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,250
We join together in love
as a single soul.

313
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:24,416
Yuki... If, if it helps
consider it a challenge.

314
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,708
Going to sleep now!

315
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,833
The two of us.
Together.

316
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,083
I can't even imagine it.

317
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,000
Hey...

318
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,291
For you, sweetheart...

319
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,416
Anything.

320
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,958
I'm good at keeping an
eye on my sugar bear.

321
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,333
Okay, I'll admit she's,
like, painfully cute, but...

322
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,250
No!
Don't even start!

323
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,083
What's wrong with me!

324
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:05,000
My man has such a lovely,
understanding mother.

325
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:10,041
And here I thought I'd
have to get ugly with her.

326
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,125
Here we are kiddo!
Whatcha think?i

327
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,000
Wow!

328
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,416
Hey, be a sport and wait
for me on the porch, will ya?

329
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,666
I'm gonna pull the car into
its secret hiding place.

330
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,625
Okey dokey!

331
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,708
I hope you kids
slept well last night.

332
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,166
Ha.

333
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,416
So, this is the fella
I was telling you about.

334
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,750
Hey, champ.

335
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,875
Can you tell big brother
and big sister your name?

336
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,125
I'm Houjou Reisuke!

337
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,125
What's your name big brother?

338
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,041
Hi there.

339
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,500
You can call me Yuki.

340
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,125
What do I call you, sis?

341
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,875
Oh, my name's Yuno.

342
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,083
Face hug!

343
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,166
Ho!
The kid's good.

344
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,458
Be sure to take off your
shoes before you come in.

345
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,333
Okey dokey!

346
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,291
Face hug.

347
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:30,458
Sloopy, sloopy,
sloopy, sloopy face hug.

348
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:39,708
Whoa.

349
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:40,875
Look at you.

350
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,625
Little dude's a drawing
fiend, aren't ya?

351
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:43,791
Awwww.
Yuno, look.

352
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,916
It's you.
I can tell from here.

353
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Nice job.

354
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,250
It's a picture of
the woman I love!

355
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,625
Uh-oh, Yuki.

356
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,916
It sounds like you have a rival.

357
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,208
Afraid there's
no competition, Mrs. A.

358
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,750
Man.

359
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,458
This kid sure is chipper for
having just become an orphan.

360
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,208
I really hope...

361
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,750
Nah.
Not possible.

362
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,333
He couldn't know
Yuno was responsible.

363
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,416
Hey...

364
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,916
You're pretty good
at that aren't ya.

365
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:11,791
Aw.

366
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,166
Did you make that just for me?

367
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,166
Oh, honey you've
got to be careful!

368
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,791
Anybody get hurt?

369
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,875
I'm alright.

370
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,083
Oh crap!!

371
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,375
Yuno!

372
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,625
I'm good.

373
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,666
The cushion's another story.

374
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,125
Oops.

375
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:35,958
You're okay?

376
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,166
You're absolutely sure?!

377
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,875
Yeah, yeah they
didn't even graze me.

378
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,000
Close call.

379
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,250
Sweet pea.

380
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,250
Promise me you'll never
run with scissors again.

381
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,500
I promise.

382
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,041
Where you off to?

383
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,666
You good to go in there alone?

384
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,916
I'm a big boy!

385
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,083
Yuno Gasai.

386
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,208
This one's gonna be a bitch.

387
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:09,875
♪ closing song ♪

388
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,541
'kay, I'm ready!

389
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,416
Alright then, Yuno...
Shall we get started?

390
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,000
Target detects nothing amiss.

391
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,916
My disguise is genius!

392
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The Amano family's
famed secret recipe for

393
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:56,458
miso soup is practically
in my hands!

394
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,750
Alright, I'm not going
to lie I'm a little nervous.

395
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:01,166
But, maybe if you
laid it out for me first.

396
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,208
It's not that hard when
you get right down to it.

397
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,833
The first order of
business is prepping our

398
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,875
ingredients with
the utmost care.

399
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,500
Item one: purified water.

400
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,791
What could be purer than water
from a glacier completely

401
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:19,458
unsullied by human hands
since the last Ice Age???

402
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:22,958
Item two:
unimpeachable soup stock.

403
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:30,083
No peaches on this beautiful
specimen, are there?

404
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:31,291
Ha-ha!

405
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:35,000
Item three: soy beans worth
moving heaven and earth for.

406
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:38,583
Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig!

407
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:41,416
They always say you got
to keep the earth moving!

408
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,125
Sweetie, I think you've
outdone yourself!

409
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:49,208
Hey, anything worth doing
is worth doing right, isn't it?

410
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,666
My ex-husband could make
miso soup out of this stuff,

411
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,416
and he's a disaster
in the kitchen!

412
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,458
Damn it.

413
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,458
Give me a sec,
I sort of have to take this.

414
00:22:58,541 --> 00:22:59,250
What is it?

415
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:00,333
I'm busy!

416
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:03,916
A disaster in
the kitchen, you say?

417
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:07,250
Sorry about that.

418
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:08,041
Ah.

419
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:08,875
Enthusiasm.

420
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:10,750
I like that about you.

421
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:12,333
--Here.
--Oh.

422
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:14,083
And a quick learner, too.

423
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:16,791
Let's see if it's fit
to be called Amano.

424
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,916
Stop looking at me like that;
it was an accident okay?

425
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,541
I'll make it up to her by
concocting at the very site

426
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:29,458
of my gaffe a batch of miso
soup worthy of the gods!

427
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,666
Item one: a little kick.

428
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,666
And some salt to
counteract that.

429
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,125
Some good-time
juice to fix that.

430
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:41,583
Which we offset by waving
our hands around frantically!

431
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:44,041
It's okay, it's okay.

432
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:50,333
What's that smell all about?

433
00:23:50,666 --> 00:23:52,541
Is it coming from there?

434
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:53,625
Bizarre.

435
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,666
When'd mom get home?
