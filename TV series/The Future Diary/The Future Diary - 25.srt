1
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,208
First quarter moon.

2
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:33,666
Half light.

3
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,375
Half dark.

4
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,583
We're a lot alike.

5
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:47,625
Don't you think, my love?

6
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:53,916
♪ opening song ♪

7
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:28,125
Ninth is really starting to
grate on my damn nerves.

8
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:29,541
Bleh.

9
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,041
Let the tramp do her worst.

10
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,833
The day some stupid
Escape Diary holds

11
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,750
a candle to yours,
I'll eat my crown.

12
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:35,875
Sure... Whatever.

13
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,458
C'mon, don't start
giving me attitude.

14
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,083
If first so much
as takes a leak,

15
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,500
we know about it ten
minutes in advance.

16
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,000
Kind of a hint there.

17
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,708
You might want
to track them down.

18
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,041
Yeah.

19
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,333
I shouldn't be doing this.

20
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:53,833
The less I interact with Yuki's
second incarnation, the better.

21
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:56,916
It's not like the playing
field's the same anymore.

22
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:02,166
I didn't want to kill him
but he wouldn't kill me.

23
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,375
The world would've ended if
one of us hadn't bit the dust.

24
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:09,250
There'd have been no
more me, no more him.

25
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,833
No more anything.

26
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,041
He lost faith in me;
yet somehow,

27
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,958
I couldn't bring myself
to lose faith in him.

28
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,333
I owe him a goodbye, that's it.

29
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,875
Next up I try my luck with
Yuki's third incarnation.

30
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:26,500
One way or another, damn it,
I'm going to make this work!

31
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,166
What now?

32
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,458
It's an ambulance.

33
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,916
Yuki called for one earlier.

34
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Yuno!

35
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:39,791
Dad, what're you doing.

36
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:40,916
Are you hurt?!

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,208
What is this?

38
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,916
The EMT's called me;
I came as soon as I could!

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,375
Anybody injured?

40
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,166
Look me in the eye.

41
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,791
If it's something your
mother did, I want to know.

42
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,166
Dad.

43
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,791
Mom.

44
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,500
This isn't right.

45
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,166
You look, different somehow.

46
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,208
It's like.

47
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,375
I can't explain it.

48
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:01,833
You're taller?

49
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,125
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

50
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,458
Are you trying to
create a paradox?!

51
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,958
What you're trying
to do is beyond dumb!

52
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,541
Only a moron would
dream it up to begin with.

53
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,583
I don't give a damn what
you think my chances are,

54
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,708
I'm saving both versions of her!

55
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,458
There's still time
in this iteration of reality.

56
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,458
So stuff it!

57
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,500
Are you hearing yourself?
Grow up!

58
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,416
I'm telling you the
only way to deal with this

59
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,416
mess is to kill the bad one
outright and be done with her!

60
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,666
Like hell.

61
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,833
Fine, then.

62
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,916
You can ride this
short bus by yourself.

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,833
Think about it.

64
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:47,750
What?

65
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,125
This whole world.

66
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:52,500
Everything is impossible
here so why shouldn't I try.

67
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,416
Because the world doesn't care.

68
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,875
You can't have your
cake and eat it, too.

69
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,291
You have to choose.

70
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,250
I won't hold it against
you if you want out.

71
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,875
Like I care either way.

72
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,958
Best of luck to you.

73
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,125
She weighs a ton.

74
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,083
Another rewrite.

75
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,500
She's hot on our trail now.

76
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:22,625
Don't be scared, Yuno.

77
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:23,833
I'll protect you.

78
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,291
She's going to have
to go through me, first.

79
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,125
I love you.

80
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,041
I mean, after all
we've been through.

81
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,666
What kind of guy would I be if
you hadn't grown on me, right?

82
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:39,916
Here it is.

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,208
The place where it all began.

84
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,333
Seems like forever ago.

85
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,791
It's okay.
I'll be right back.

86
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,250
Time to end this.

87
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,041
Alright then.

88
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,750
Now what?

89
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,750
I'm sorry it's
got to be this way!

90
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,208
So am I!

91
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,958
I know your moves!

92
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:26,333
Murmur!

93
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,916
He's going for the fire hose!

94
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,500
That's right, you
little bastard dance

95
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,708
like the meat puppet you are!

96
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,708
Ha ha! Show me how
long you can dance!

97
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,458
They're in full swing.

98
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,416
Excuse me?

99
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,166
Forget it.

100
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,250
Talking to myself.

101
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,250
Anyway, listen
carefully, Kurusu.

102
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,791
You're boy has
a heart condition.

103
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,041
It hasn't been detected yet,
but if you wait much longer

104
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,333
he'll die before he's
reached another birthday.

105
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,666
Get him checked out now,

106
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,041
and there might be
something you can do about it.

107
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,750
Who the hell is this?

108
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,875
There...
I kept my side of the bargain.

109
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,875
Try not to be such an
asshole in this universe.

110
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,541
You've got to be kidding!

111
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,375
It's time to die!

112
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,375
Follow him Murmur he's
heading down the hallway!

113
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,500
They've got me bouncing
back and forth like a pinball.

114
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,541
Her diary knows exactly
where I'm going to be.

115
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,958
And you know what?

116
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,708
That's perfect.

117
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,833
She got him.
He's hurt.

118
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,375
Wait.

119
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,250
This is.

120
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,000
Oh god!

121
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,208
This isn't what I want!

122
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,458
I'm on borrowed time
at this point, huh?

123
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,916
She's going to stab me
in the neck before too long.

124
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,791
Except...

125
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,250
I've got just a little
bit of wiggle room.

126
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,708
Wow... You are a
reckless S.O.B., Yuki.

127
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,166
No wonder Ninth
got the hell out of Dodge.

128
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,541
No.

129
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,875
I can't think like that.

130
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,333
I'm talking Yuno out
of this version of Reality.

131
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,083
Period.

132
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,750
Whatever it takes.

133
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,291
She can be Goddess of
the Second Iteration.

134
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,916
Even if I have to
die to make that happen.

135
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,541
Best option, really.

136
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,083
Hell, only option.

137
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,666
So, suck it up!

138
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,791
Enough is enough Yuno!

139
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,791
You have to stop chasing me!

140
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,416
Shut up.

141
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,583
Only one way to make this work.

142
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,208
Get that damn
phone away from her,

143
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,708
and the future will
be a clean slate.

144
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:06,208
If she's helpless,
she can be persuaded!

145
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,625
Just come at me, bro!

146
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:11,500
Queen Murmur specializes
in taking out idiots!

147
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:19,791
What?!

148
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,833
My Dead End comes
by Yuno's hand.

149
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,750
The imp's got nothing!

150
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,083
Yuno!

151
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,208
Damn it, Yuki!

152
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,291
Why do you always
have to interfere?!

153
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,208
Because I love you,
you crazy bitch!

154
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,041
Oh no.

155
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,916
I thought she'd
do it close-range.

156
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,375
How did I only graze him?

157
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,791
Did his words throw me off?

158
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:46,791
No.

159
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,416
I...

160
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,041
Maybe try this on for size!

161
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,958
Not on my watch!

162
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,541
Time's up, sweetheart
my Dead End's a no-show.

163
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,375
Listen to reason, Yuno.

164
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,791
Go back to the
Second Iteration and rule it.

165
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:07,875
The sky's the limit.

166
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,375
So that's your
big strategy, huh?

167
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,541
Why you got to be such
a pain in the ass?!

168
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:16,666
Huh?

169
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:22,708
Boom!

170
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,125
Good night!

171
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,291
It's so obvious.

172
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,750
I didn't see it.

173
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,250
Denial runs pretty
deep, I guess.

174
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,541
I love you, too, Yuki.

175
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,625
Diaries are generally
about how you feel, right?

176
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:02,833
Core of Deus, grant me dominion
over the Spheres of Causality!

177
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,833
I so get it now, Pookie.

178
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,666
I'm in love!

179
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,166
Damn it, kid!

180
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,541
So your daughter and your
husband are both missing?

181
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,083
Yes.

182
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:30,583
The EMT said something about
my husband meeting them, but...

183
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,666
Sorry, give me one moment.

184
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,708
Yes, This is Kurusu.

185
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,166
They're in full swing.

186
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,250
Excuse me?

187
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,125
Forget it.

188
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,125
Talking to myself.

189
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,000
Anyway, listen
carefully, Kurusu.

190
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,583
You're boy has
a heart condition.

191
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,875
It hasn't been detected yet,
but if you wait much longer

192
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,166
he'll die before he's
reached another birthday.

193
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,500
Get him checked out now,

194
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,083
and there might be
something you can do about it.

195
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,708
Who the hell is this?!

196
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,000
Must be something going around.

197
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,166
I've got to get
an unlisted number.

198
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,500
Heads up, chief!

199
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,958
We've got an explosion at
the elementary school!

200
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,625
You got to be kidding.

201
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,833
Odds are I just
listened in on it.

202
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,583
Son of a.

203
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,416
On your feet, sleeping beauty.

204
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,625
I was just resting my eyes!

205
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,541
Get a move on, people!

206
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,250
Somebody help me!

207
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,666
What's going on?

208
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,708
Aw, neat-o!

209
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,666
Lady Tsubaki.

210
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,791
Your mother and father
shall be leaving

211
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,708
with Funatsu in a
matter of moments.

212
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,333
I thought you should know.

213
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,000
Have them wait a while.

214
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:39,125
I don't recommend
travel just now.

215
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,875
What in heaven's
name is going on?

216
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,083
Miss Matron!

217
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,750
I think we've got a situation!

218
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,333
Some Big Wig
wants to talk with you!

219
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,125
What have we
learned about loitering?

220
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,416
That freaks give
you hell for it!

221
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,833
Dude, you look
like you've seen a ghost.

222
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,416
Dad.
Mom.

223
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,000
Sit down; we need to talk about
where to set up the telescope.

224
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,208
Better warn your appetite;
I made Salisbury steak.

225
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,666
No way.

226
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,125
How is the jacket I've wanted

227
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,833
forever suddenly
part of my wardrobe?

228
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,375
And this dart board.

229
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,541
And a frigging myna bird.

230
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:44,375
Not a bad place to
hang your hat, right?

231
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,208
Think of it like
a mirror where your

232
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,250
heart's every desire is
reflected flawlessly.

233
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,750
I used Deus' core to build you

234
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,000
a kind of personal
Never-Never Land.

235
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,500
Yu--!

236
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,166
Why can't I say her name?

237
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,291
What've you done to me?

238
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,625
Nothing love.

239
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,208
You're living in an illusion
where I don't exist.

240
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,500
My name can't leave your lips

241
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,500
because you've never
heard it before.

242
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,666
I'm sorry.

243
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,666
This is...

244
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,000
My way of breaking up.

245
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,000
My theory was incorrect.

246
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,208
I thought if I killed the 2.0
version of you

247
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,666
I could end all this.

248
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,958
That I could hop on
over to the Third Iteration

249
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,375
and live happily ever after.

250
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,916
I was wrong.

251
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,250
I didn't think
everything through.

252
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,541
My brain is all over the map.

253
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,125
I'm sorry.

254
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,125
It's the only way to
clear out the cobwebs.

255
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,833
Don't think for a
second I don't love you.

256
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,583
The Second Iteration's simply
out of the question for me now.

257
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:39,916
No it's not!

258
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,291
Listen... You'll be
its goddess;

259
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,083
you'll have control over
how things will play out!

260
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,125
No I won't!

261
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,583
Not where it matters!

262
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,375
You'll still be dead!

263
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,041
It's like every
other version of the game;

264
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,916
if a winner isn't chosen, the
whole thing goes up in smoke.

265
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,375
This world needs a god.

266
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,416
Think of this like
I'm nominating you.

267
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,750
Please don't be upset with me.

268
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,500
Everybody gets
something out of it, right?

269
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,375
You get to live and I get
to try my luck with the

270
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:04,666
third version of you in
the universe next door.

271
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,166
Even as a goddess,
I amount to less

272
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,458
than nothing without
you in my heart.

273
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,916
So this is it, then.

274
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,583
You're just going to leave
me marooned here.

275
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,375
And you'll go on
butchering everyone!

276
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,916
Over and over again!

277
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You'll take the same stupid
risks that'll lead us nowhere!

278
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,375
Don't make me.

279
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,291
I don't want to say it.

280
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,875
Think about it.

281
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,416
I'd have fallen for anyone
who'd let me cling to them.

282
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,083
I'm sorry, but
you know it's true.

283
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,708
You needed to be protected.

284
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,791
I needed somebody to fawn over.

285
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,875
We only worked cause
our issues dovetailed.

286
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,541
Hi there, cutie.

287
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,416
The hell is this?!

288
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:51,916
Good, you're sitting.

289
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,125
Because guess what?

290
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,041
I'm totally gaga over you.

291
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,291
No!

292
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,875
The real Wakaba would
never talk like that!

293
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,000
Take me.

294
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:07,000
No.
Knock it off!

295
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,041
I've wanted this for so long.

296
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,916
You have no idea.

297
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,875
Get off of me!

298
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:13,958
This isn't real.

299
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,291
This isn't real!

300
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,000
Yuno made this for me!

301
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,500
She's the one I love!

302
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,625
Not you!

303
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:22,791
Goodbye.

304
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,250
Stop it!!!

305
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:28,291
Okay.

306
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,041
I get it.

307
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,083
We were codependent.

308
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,833
I accept that.

309
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,958
But I wasn't just using her.

310
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,500
There was more to it.

311
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,625
So much more.

312
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:44,875
Sup.

313
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,166
What's with the face?

314
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,041
You look like someone just
stomped your heart into the mud.

315
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:56,041
Exactly what's in it
for you to help him?

316
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:59,291
Anyway I slice it, it's
never made sense to me.

317
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,583
I don't know.

318
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,166
I'll get back to you
after I've figured out

319
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,791
why birds fly south
for the winter.

320
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,583
It's probably just instinct.

321
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,041
Might as well ask
why they fly at all.

322
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,541
Kind of like love.

323
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,958
Either you go with the flow or
convince yourself you are.

324
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,416
Enough philosophy for tonight.

325
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,125
I vote we leave the Big
Questions to our fists!

326
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,500
Murmur!
I shatter your restraints!

327
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,625
How's this a thing?

328
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,875
You were half-dead a second ago!

329
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,833
You all pumped up to
play junior astronomer?

330
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,916
The telescope I
got's professional grade.

331
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,125
Seriously?!

332
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,625
Every now and then,
your dad gets it right.

333
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,125
I say we find the
highest plot of land

334
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,666
we can get to and set up camp.

335
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,041
Hell yeah!

336
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,125
Any constellation whose
skirt you fancy looking up?

337
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,708
Dad!

338
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,750
You're such a freak.

339
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:38,833
Ah.

340
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:39,708
Here we go.

341
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,875
Meal fit for a king.

342
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,250
Bon appetite!

343
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,500
Stop ogling the chef
and eat while it's hot.

344
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,833
Alright.

345
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,208
Rub-a-dub, thanks
for the grub.

346
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,958
Wow, mom.
This is amazing.

347
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,500
Eat it slow.

348
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,291
I'm packing you black holes
a gut-busting lunch as it is.

349
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,000
You really couldn't
ask for a prettier day

350
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,541
than this to go star-gazing.

351
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,375
How bout we hit Misaka Pass
on the way to the observatory?

352
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,375
The sky practically
touches the ground.

353
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,791
Trust me, we've got
more than enough

354
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,958
food to make the trip on
if you're feeling up to it.

355
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,833
I made that tulip fried chicken.

356
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,541
Wow...
Sounds awesome!

357
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,833
Hey, mind if I get
seconds of this, though?

358
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,250
I swear, champ.

359
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,083
The heck do you put it?

360
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,458
Something wrong, sweetheart?

361
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,041
Uh...
Nothing.

362
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,291
Just thinking
about a dream I had.

363
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,000
Oh yeah?

364
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,416
It was pretty messed up.

365
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,916
I was in this, like,
fight to the death

366
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,666
using cell phones that
told you the future.

367
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,833
Uh huh.

368
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,125
Someone ate
leftovers before bed.

369
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,458
I totally fell in
love with this girl.

370
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,708
She was a stalker, or something.

371
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,208
Those are the best kind.

372
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,916
I got to say I never really
saw you going for that type.

373
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,125
Was she pretty at least,
or are we talking psycho troll?

374
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,583
She was...

375
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,125
She was always there for me.

376
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,291
No matter what.

377
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,208
Like you guys.

378
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,916
And I was...

379
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I was just so mean
to her sometimes.

380

I don't know...

It's just...

385
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:30,166
You look taller since
the last time I saw you,

386
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,166
and you've, uh, maybe,
grown into certain things.

Please tell me you meant that
differently than it sounded!

This is not going to end well.

I need to get in there and
pull some sleight of hand.

Deus, hear my command!

Make Second height

And you've, uh, maybe,

Alright, Murmur.

404
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:09,583
Something a little
less dramatic this time.

405
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,583
I'm not thinking
strait right now.

406
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:13,791
I just have to watch
my intonation.

Take three.

Oh, hang on.

Know what?

425
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:56,416
I retract my previous
observation.

426
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,541
 Wait!
That's not what I meant!

427
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:00,416
I take it back!
