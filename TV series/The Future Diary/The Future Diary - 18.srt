1
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,833
It was just a coincidence.

2
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,375
I'm not a stalker.

3
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,125
I mean, yeah I was kind

4
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,875
of maybe spying
on him, sure, but...

5
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,541
I didn't mean to see it.

6
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:42,875
I'm going to be late.

7
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:44,291
Ugh.

8
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:45,916
Was that a love letter?

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
♪ opening song ♪

10
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm telling you,
that chick is on fire.

11
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,750
Well go on put the
moves on her, dude.

12
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,208
I'm just window shopping here;
I'm not outta my mind.

13
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,208
If I was feeling
suicidal, then maybe.

14
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,208
Or when your balls finally drop.

15
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,750
Shut up!

16
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,250
Stupid boys.

17
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,958
Wipe the drool off your chin.

18
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:50,416
I know what you're
after... no thank you.

19
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,000
I have a man.

20
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,375
One who's going
to love me for me.

21
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,958
One day, Yuki.

22
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,000
I started following him
about a week ago now.

23
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:10,833
Nothing creepy,
just keeping an eye out.

24
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,666
This cheesy survey they
handed out in class was throwing

25
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,250
me off for some reason;

26
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,250
I could tell he was
having issues with it, too.

27
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,041
So, I made conversation.

28
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,250
Like you do.

29
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,958
Long story short... the promise.

30
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,666
We could be a family
if we got married.

31
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,833
We'll have to
wait till we're older.

32
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,750
Alright, the votes
have been tallied,

33
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,125
let's read out the results.

34
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,708
I don't really know how else
to describe how I feel.

35
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,666
It's like I'm trapped in a
pit and he's my rope ladder.

36
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,291
So you know...

37
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,041
That crap has to go.

38
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,208
No valentine for her.

39
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:55,333
But it looks like the majority
has opted to do a Maid Cafe.

40
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,916
So...

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,833
Holy cow we'll need enough stuff
that it looks like one of you

42
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,083
will get to go on
a shopping spree.

43
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,333
Actually, I need two people.

44
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,625
Gasai, Amano, you're up.

45
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,125
Oh wait.

46
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,583
Never mind, Miss Gasai.

47
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,083
I forget your parents like
you home right after school.

48
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,833
Can I get someone else to
help Yuki with the schlepping?

49
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,083
I'm happy to do it, sir.

50
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,750
My folks are cool.

51
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,166
Good.

52
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,041
It'll be Wakaba and Amano, then.

53
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,375
Thank you very much.

54
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,875
No problem.

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,291
That sneaky little bitch.

56
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,875
Abusing her power to
put the moves on my man.

57
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,875
The letter's for her, isn't it?

58
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,958
She knows, too.

59
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,375
She's working
the angles so he'll

60
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:40,583
muster up the
courage to give it to her.

61
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,750
This place should
have everything we need.

62
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:44,416
Yeah.

63
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,916
Sure.

64
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:49,125
Wow. In a single afternoon
I go from zero friends,

65
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,791
to hanging out with her.

66
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,500
How's that happen?

67
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:53,958
Ah, who cares, right?

68
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,416
I just got to not screw this up.

69
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,208
Today is the day.

70
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,541
Stationary store first, yeah?

71
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,000
Denied!

72
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,791
That was way too close.

73
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,500
Mommy, I want to pet
the giant bun-bun!

74
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,291
Another millisecond
and they'd have

75
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,750
been skipping like
this was a musical.

76
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,041
Here, let me help.
You okay?

77
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,833
Yeah.
Thank you.

78
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:42,875
Found it.

79
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,083
And that takes care of our list.

80
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,583
You ready?

81
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,166
I really need to do this right.

82
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,291
Buy her a soda first.

83
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,000
Get her in the mood.

84
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,833
Let's see...

85
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,458
Did I sit on your frigging
eggs or something?!

86
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,375
Why am I being
harassed by a furry?

87
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:13,500
Where the hell is it written

88
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,500
that I don't get to
have a love life?!

89
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:17,875
Catastrophe averted.

90
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,916
Break down her defenses
with a cold beverage

91
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,208
over my dead, fluffy body!

92
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:25,458
Why'd the hoppity have to
make growlies at me, momma?

93
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:26,541
It's okay son.

94
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,625
He's gone.
Cheer up.

95
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,750
I don't want it!

96
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,416
I'm not out of the woods, yet.

97
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,583
He might give her
the letter anyway.

98
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,625
Kay. I'm going to give her the
letter after I do my business.

99
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,083
No skimps on the hand-washing.

100
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,041
Damn it!

101
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,000
You're kidding me.

102
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,416
Why the hell do you want this?

103
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,208
There he is!
Arrest that rabbit!

104
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,791
Screw you guys,
I've got a letter to burn!

105
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:32,875
Don't give her the letter!

106
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,166
She's the wrong girl for you!

107
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,083
She's a whore!

108
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,583
Wakaba!

109
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,125
Where've you, been?

110
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,375
Yuki, don't!

111
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:45,583
I can't lose him!

112
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,708
Without Yuki,
I don't have a future!

113
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,375
Wakaba.

114
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:52,333
Um.

115
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:53,333
Yeah?

116
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,083
This is for you.

117
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,041
What happens at the bottom?

118
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,833
It's important for
me that you read it.

119
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,291
Oh no.

120
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,625
I broke my curfew.

121
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,916
Wait.

122
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,125
Why do I care?

123
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,541
It's not like it matters now.

124
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,208
No one's around to get mad.

125
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,291
I'm home, guys.

126
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,750
How was, your day?

127
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,375
It's been about a
month since they died.

128
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:00,958
Keep your GPA up.

129
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,958
Absolutely no junk food.

130
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,375
Backtalk is one demerit.

131
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,208
Breaking curfew is three.

132
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,291
I know.

133
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,333
I know.

134
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,166
Three demerits gets the cage.

135
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:17,083
And the cage means no food.

136
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,166
Not so much fun
when you're the ones

137
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,041
locked in there pleading
for scraps, is it?

138
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,625
What can I say?

139
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,583
You get tired of being little
Miss Perfect after a while.

140
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,833
Birdie's got to leave the nest.

141
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:36,875
Or, next best thing,
lock up the folks.

142
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,250
See to it momma and
poppa bird get a taste

143
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,541
of the worms they've
been feeding you.

144
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,166
You little bitch!

145
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,041
I curse the day you were born!

146
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,666
Doesn't end well, though.

147
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,291
Not really.

148
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,583
I don't know if I meant
for them to die, but...

149
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,500
Oh well, I guess.

150
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,250
Thanks for helping
me out, up there.

151
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,875
If she'd taken
the letter, I'd be...

152
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,708
For now I still have a future.

153
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,875
All I have to do is
protect him from himself.

154
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,500
Got to keep him honest about the
promise he made me, don't I?

155
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,791
It's the only way.

156
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,958
The only tomorrow.

157
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,375
You wish to sift your mother
from the common dust?

158
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,708
Yes.

159
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,000
You're a god; it should
be a walk in park for you.

160
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,833
I cannot bring her back.

161
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,166
Why the hell not?!

162
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,708
My stewardship of
causality has diminished to

163
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:59,041
the point where such a
task is no longer possible.

164
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,125
My strength leaves me.

165
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,416
Lo!

166
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,666
When I am folded
into our common dust,

167
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,875
reality as you know
it will crumble for

168
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,250
lack of a successor
to this throne.

169
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,208
Yep.

170
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,875
Take a look at
the bigger picture kid;

171
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,583
mommy staying dead should
be the least of your worries.

172
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,000
We are talking universal
catastrophe here.

173
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,291
But...

174
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,333
The boss isn't being
totally straight with you.

175
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,208
There is a little workaround.

176
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:26,291
A way to save your
mom and the universe.

177
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,000
You have got to be kidding me.

178
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,666
Dad!

179
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,083
So what I get for whistling to
myself in a dark alley when

180
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,750
god only knows how many
loan-shark lackeys got to be out

181
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,958
there waiting to pounce the
second I show up on their radar.

182
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,458
How dare you come here!

183
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,875
Come clean.

184
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,125
I know you killed mom.

185
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,833
Turn yourself in.

186
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,583
Hell of a sense of humor
you got there, champ.

187
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,708
This isn't a joke!

188
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,208
Okay, fine.

189
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,625
Suppose I was the
one who killed her.

190
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,583
If you had any proof, why not
just go to the police yourself?

191
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,416
It's not exactly
as simple as that.

192
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,583
Then you might want to put a
damper on the libelous bullshit.

193
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,833
What did you get
that pawn receipt for?

194
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,041
You don't have anything to sell.

195
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,583
The hell you know
about what I have?

196
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,083
He hocked something.

197
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,458
I know it.

198
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,208
What, though?

199
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,208
The deadline's tomorrow.

200
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,333
If he thinks I'm on to him,
he'll just yank whatever

201
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,916
is out of pawn
before I can use it.

202
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,625
Unless I tail him and steal it.

203
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,250
Then he's up a creek.

204
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,333
The bastard will have
to confess to what he did!

205
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,625
Relax.

206
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,791
It's just a couple of
routine questions, alright?

207
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:04,000
The bones we found at
your house, they, uh, well...

208
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,375
Dental records confirm
that two of the skeletons

209
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,708
belonged to your parents.

210
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,625
So that's solved at least.

211
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,333
The third skeleton's
still a mystery, though.

212
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,875
We were wondering if
you might be able to shed

213
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,916
some light on that one for us.

214
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,333
Excuse me?

215
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,333
Don't get too comfortable, girl.

216
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,958
Forensics is working
nights on this one.

217
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,458
Then...

218
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,541
Well, we'll see.

219
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,000
Damn it!

220
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,000
Why didn't my alarm go off?

221
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,708
The bastard's gone!

222
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,500
He's nowhere near
the pawn shop yet, though.

223
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,416
If I hustle I can catch up!

224
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,125
Or not?

225
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,583
To hell with that!

226
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,833
Come on, damn it.
Rewrite!

227
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,250
I have to be closing the gap!

228
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,208
Bingo!
Shortcut!

229
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,375
That's what I'm talking about!

230
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,875
Gotcha!

231
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,625
A bag?

232
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,791
No, no, no, no, no!
Son of a...!

233
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,291
Where's he going?

234
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,458
The shrine?

235
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:49,625
Alright, then.
Another shortcut.

236
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,541
Man, I'm getting
old if these stairs

237
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,791
can frigging wind me like this.

238
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:00,625
Guess it's been a while
since I've climbed them, huh?

239
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,125
I know the perfect spot!

240
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,416
The courtyard of this place
is made for star-gazing!

241
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,583
You're going to absolutely
love it, trust me!

242
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:18,500
Too bad we never got a chance to
do some real sky-watching, huh?

243
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,666
It's over, Dad.

244
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,541
What are you doing here?

245
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,416
You tailing me?

246
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:33,916
Bastard...

247
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,791
What's in here's going to
prove you're a murderer!

248
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,666
Wait, what?

249
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,833
Dad, Why do you have this?

250
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,583
I bought it back in the day
so we could, you know, use it.

251
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,708
It's been in storage.

252
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,583
Fat chance of that now, right?

253
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,875
Your old man's got a one
way ticket to the Big House.

254
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,916
What did you expect?

255
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,458
Look, just...

256
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:04,666
Please believe me when I
tell you I didn't mean to do it.

257
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,791
I loved your mother.

258
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,416
I got this thing out of
pawn so you'd know that

259
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,208
I'd wanted us to be a
family again, too.

260
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,208
Dad.

261
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,458
I'm sorry for what
I did to us, Yuki.

262
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,666
Your dad's a monster.

263
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,291
You know they set
up these really neat

264
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:33,583
viewing stalls all along
here during festivals.

265
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,166
Sounds pretty cool, actually.

266
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,416
Maybe they'll go easy on me.

267
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,958
Maybe.

268
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,375
If I get out on good behavior
at some point down the road,

269
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,666
what do you say you and me...

270
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,083
I don't know, see if
we can't make this

271
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,416
whole father-son thing work?

272
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,541
If you've served your
time then maybe.

273
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,833
Can I get you to work your
charm on the parole board?

274
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,416
Uh oh.
Now what?

275
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,541
Dad!

276
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,541
No! Don't you
do this to me!

277
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,000
Get up! Please!

278
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,458
Dad!

279
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,208
No.
He was...

280
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,375
He was ready to atone.

281
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,833
He was going to face the music.

282
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,541
We had plans for
when he got out.

283
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,208
This isn't fair.

284
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,541
Why?

285
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,791
What if I told you
there actually is

286
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,083
a way to bring her back?

287
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,458
The solution's
been staring right

288
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:53,583
at you since the game began,

289
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,666
but for some reason
you've missed it.

290
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,791
You have to win the game.

291
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,166
Inherit the throne of time.

292
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,333
The irony's a bitch, I know kill
everyone to save everyone,

293
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,958
but that's the way the
Time God crumbles.

294
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,750
Hey. It's nothing
personal, kiddo.

295
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,791
Oh, it's about to
get extremely personal.

296
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,333
You little punk ass!

297
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,916
"An enemy tries to
stab me from behind."

298
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,625
"The enemy to
my right opens fire."

299
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,208
Look out!

300
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,916
This little bastard is either a

301
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,791
goddamn killing machine
or he's out of his mind!

302
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,958
Sorry, love. I got
here as soon as I could.

303
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,458
Yuno.

304
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,916
Are you alright?

305
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,375
Here.
Drink slowly.

306
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,083
You'll hurl if you chug it.

307
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,000
Talk to me.

308
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:35,208
There's, uh, been
a change of plans.

309
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,166
I'm going to win this
thing and become god.

310
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,000
Which means, I damn
well better get used

311
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,000
to having blood on my hands.

312
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,958
I have to bring
mom and dad back.

313
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,500
I'm sorry!

314
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:50,041
As of right now, all you
are to me is a hurdle!

315
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,708
Oh yeah?

316
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,375
I don't need you anymore.

317
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,083
I can fight my own
battles from here on out.

318
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,750
I've got the goods
on Eighth, and Ninth

319
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,958
won't ever see it
coming, not from me.

320
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:04,125
And for Eleventh,
I'll figure it out.

321
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,833
Go on, then.

322
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,833
Might as well strike
while the iron's hot.

323
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,791
Oh, sugar bear.

324
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,583
I'm ready to cash in
whenever you give the word.

325
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,916
Cause that's how much...

326
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,958
I love you.

327
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,666
The Eleventh Diary User

00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,750
Are we on some kind
of stakeout, or what?
