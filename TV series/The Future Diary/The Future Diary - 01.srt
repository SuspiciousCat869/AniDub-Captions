1
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,833
Um. Okay.

2
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,458
Ha-ha.

3
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,916
Very funny.
C'mon.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You're scaring me!

5
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,500
Mom.

6
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,166
Dad.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,958
Help me, please.

8
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:10,500
Yuki.

9
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:15,833
♪ opening song ♪

10
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,500
And I'd like everyone to bear in
mind the current unpleasantness

11
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:58,875
as they make their way home.

12
00:02:58,958 --> 00:02:59,750
Monitor.

13
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,208
Dismissed.

14
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,166
Court's open, right?

15
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,708
Ours for the claiming, dude.

16
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,125
Shame we don't
have enough people.

17
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,708
So we find somebody.

18
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,250
It's not like it's hard.

19
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,333
Hey, Amano.

20
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:14,250
You game?

21
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,791
Bad idea.

22
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:16,958
Dude. Really?

23
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,041
He's not going to
be into it, trust me.

24
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,166
Creep's a wallflower.

25
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,416
Is that why his face
is buried in that

26
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,166
frigging cell phone
twenty-four seven?

27
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,416
What's all that crap about?

28
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,666
Who knows.

29
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,875
I heard he keeps like
a diary or something.

30
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,958
Miss Gasai I'd appreciate
it if you could deliver

31
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,416
these to the faculty
lounge on your way out.

32
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,041
Happy to sir.
I'll get right on it.

33
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,833
I could also use your
help in the library,

34
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,791
if you can spare the time.

35
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,166
Sure.

36
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,625
I'm what you might call a
bystander, a casual observer.

37
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,125
Always have been, really.

38
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,500
I started begging off of sports
and stuff in grade school.

39
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,541
So, now people pretty
much leave me alone.

40
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,791
Guess I keep a journal out
of boredom, to be honest.

41
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,291
I mean, what else
was I going to do?

42
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,250
Don't get me wrong,
I have friends.

43
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:30,041
They just happen to be,
well, kind of imaginary.

44
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,833
Deus.

45
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,500
Yukiteru.

46
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,000
A moment please.

47
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,708
I am amending a
finer point of causality.

48
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:44,041
Sounds like somebody's
got a lot on their plate.

49
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:47,416
Reality benefits
from the occasional jolt.

50
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,000
You're not going to,
like, I don't know,

51
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,375
spark a war or
anything are you?

52
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,458
You dislike violence?

53
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,083
Wheels within wheels, lad.

54
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,916
Just you wait and see.

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,916
Deus Ex Machina,
lord of space and time.

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,041
That thing we call "The
Universe?" That's his baby.

57
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,833
Again with the diary?

58
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:08,000
How does a kid like you have
that much to write about?

59
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,500
Uh. Well.

60
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,500
I mean, it's not like I'm
writing a memoir or anything.

61
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,708
I just like to jot down the when
and where of things, you know?

62
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,916
Things like the fact that
you're lousing up my bed.

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,458
So jot this down.

64
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,416
Wow, Murmur, way to be mature.

65
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,041
Way to not have your
entries be all random.

66
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,083
That's the whole point.

67
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,750
If I tried to organize them,
there'd be too much of me

68
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,625
in this thing for it
to be objective.

69
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,166
Kay.

70
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,458
Besides, it's not as if I'd have
much to say otherwise.

71
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,166
My phone is my whole world.

72
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,833
That and this place.

73
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,625
Are you lonely?

74
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:47,916
Not really.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,166
Given the opportunity
to reinvent yourself,

76
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,708
however, what would you do?

77
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:58,541
Suppose I bestow upon you the
ability to foresee the future?

78
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,375
Who's texting me?

79
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,916
Consider it my gift to you.

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,791
From my own phone?

81
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,541
Out with it.

82
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:09,958
What are you cooking up now?

83
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,375
A diversion of sorts.

84
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,916
Whatever you say, old man.

85
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,625
I can always pinch myself.

86
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,416
Oh, give me a break!

87
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,958
Somebody, get down here
and open this door right now!

88
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,791
Oh god, not like this.

89
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,208
Please I'm not ready.

90
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,208
What's this all about?

91
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:01,041
"April twenty-second, 6:59 a.m.

92
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,708
Scored a double bull's-eye
doing my morning routine."

93
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,125
"7:05 a.m., home.

94
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,916
The news ran a thing
about the serial killer again.

95
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,750
Another woman was murdered.

96
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,333
They think the guy
took a shortcut

97
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,708
through our school
to shake the cops."

98
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,458
Wait...

99
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,791
Did I sleep-text?

100
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,541
And how are all
these from today?

101
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,791
Whatever.

102
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,083
Whoa, dude!

103
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,583
Nice!

104
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,208
In other news...

105
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,458
The body of a young woman,

106
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,375
thought to be the latest
victim in a string of

107
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,583
serial killings that began
several months ago,

108
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,625
was found brutally
stabbed not far from

109
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,625
a school in the
Sakurami district.

110
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,250
The special task
force appointed to

111
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,000
bring the killer to
justice maintains

112
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,916
that this latest
murder fits the

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,083
perpetrator's so-called
escalating profile.

114
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,666
Another one, huh?

115
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,458
The killer is thought to have
fled capture in this instance by

116
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,416
using the nearby
school as a shortcut,

117
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,208
suggesting a familiarity
with the building...

118
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,583
How could I?

119
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,125
No.

120
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,041
Just a freaky
coincidence, that's all.

121
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,833
Has to be.

122
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,291
This is unusual.

123
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,333
I ran into Kousaka and
Shiraishi on my way to school.

124
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:18,250
Slow down, man!

125
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,500
Hey!

126
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,208
My bad, I figured you
were way ahead of me.

127
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,500
Okay, that's freaky.

128
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,583
I never see these guys here!

129
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,250
They're on the track team.

130
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,916
They should be at practice!

131
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,750
This is really starting
to weird me out.

132
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,291
April twenty-second, 9:30 am.

133
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,083
School, class 2-B.

134
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,166
Pop quiz in math.

135
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,000
This can't be a coincidence.

136
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,000
Wait a second.

137
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,833
I've got the answers?

138
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,375
Are they correct?

139
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:53,750
Yo, dude.

140
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,708
You like ace the test or what?

141
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,625
Well, I don't know about that.

142
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:00,208
It's not like I can
compete with you right?

143
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,166
Why you got to be
such a little suck-up?

144
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,416
12:32 p.m.

145
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,666
Classroom.

146
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,875
Kousaka gives me a
hard time at lunch again.

147
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,333
2:05 p.m.

148
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,750
Home Ec class.

149
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:22,208
Satonaka cuts her hand
and has to go to the nurse.

150
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,458
Okay, this is insane.

151
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,833
"4:12pm, walking home.

152
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:31,333
Ran into a couple of detectives
doing a sweep around the school.

153
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,666
They're on the
serial killer case."

154
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,750
Can my phone see?

155
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,291
Quite so.

156
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,125
I have an inkling you'll find
prognostication very handy.

157
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,208
This is impossible!

158
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,708
You're a figment of
my imagination,

159
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,125
how does that translate into
knowing what my future is?

160
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,500
I mean, you...

161
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,500
I thought you up and I don't
know what's coming next!

162
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,791
Do you believe imagination
and reality to be

163
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:54,458
mutually exclusive habitats
for an entity of my stature?

164
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,333
He's a god.
He lives where he wants.

165
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,333
And beware the boon of a god.

166
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:01,000
Yours in particular
comes at a price.

167
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,333
A diary of this kind
and its user are as one.

168
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,833
Should your phone come
to ruin, so shall the

169
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:10,416
march of days it serves as
a privileged window upon.

170
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,041
Your life will be forfeit.

171
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,916
A Future Diary.

172
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,083
Everything I've seen.

173
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,291
No.

174
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,000
Everything I'm going
to see is already here.

175
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,541
Recorded for posterity.

176
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:30,291
Every little detail about
what my day has in store.

177
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,625
I'm telling ya, man.

178
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,041
His head's swollen up
like a damn balloon.

179
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,625
How does a geek go from
walking with his eyes glued to

180
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,500
his shoes to prancing
around like he

181
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:38,958
owns the place all of a sudden?

182
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,625
Where's a loser like him
get off acting like a big shot?

183
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,291
Dude's got a hard
wakeup call coming his way.

184
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,416
What the hell?

185
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,208
I don't know, man.

186
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,250
This is the way he takes.

187
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,500
He should be here.

188
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,333
2:12 p.m., outside.

189
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,916
Jocks waiting behind the school.

190
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,125
Thought they'd teach me a lesson
by ambushing me between classes.

191
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,916
They told me that's what
I get for being a poser.

192
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,083
Jerks.

193
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,583
More like dumbasses!

194
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:02,583
This is awesome!

195
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,041
Keep this puppy in
good shape and

196
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:07,666
I've basically got a cheat
sheet for, like, everything!

197
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:13,000
I completely
and totally win at life!

198
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,500
The trail's getting hot.

199
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,250
Uh, Mr. Hiyama?

200
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,791
No offense or nothing,
but number three is bunk.

201
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,208
We never covered this stuff.

202
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,541
Is that a fact?

203
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,375
I could have sworn
we went over it last week.

204
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,666
Yeah.

205
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,458
You know, somehow
I'm just not sweating this.

206
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,958
Go figure.

207
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,625
Why do I even need
to know this crap?

208
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,875
Don't worry, people.

209
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,166
You can always lift the
answers off your phone.

210
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,916
Oh, wait.
Except you can't.

211
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,458
Ha!

212
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,791
Kay... What was
that all about?

213
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,125
Weird.

214
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,958
Excuse me, Miss Gasai, but we
are in the middle of a test.

215
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,708
I'm just keeping
my brain occupied.

216
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,625
I can do two things at once.

217
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,875
Try not to distract
your classmates.

218
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,000
Yuno Gasai.

219
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,166
Straight A student.

220
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,208
Pretty.

221
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,708
Got the whole
school at her feet.

222
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:26,666
Nah.

223
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,166
Can't be.

224
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,166
I have to be dreaming.

225
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,458
Don't I?

226
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,291
Dead End?

227
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,625
What the hell's going on?

228
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,208
What happened to the future?

229
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:51,083
Your future.
Don't get them confused.

230
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,750
Hey there Amano.

231
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,916
She knows my name?

232
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,833
You got a dead end, right?

233
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,125
How did you know that?

234
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,791
I saw it coming
a mile away.

235
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,916
It's changed again?

236
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,416
What the hell?!

237
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,708
6:09 p.m., in town.

238
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,250
I escape into a side alley.

239
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,333
I think I lost her.

240
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,208
Will you just hear me out?!

241
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:27,208
However you're doing this, why
not go and bother someone else!

242
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,083
Get your head around it, man.

243
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,500
There's an explanation.

244
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,125
There's gotta be!

245
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,625
As far as I know
I'm the only one

246
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:40,208
who's got dibs on
the future, right?

247
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,041
Right?

248
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,166
Okay.

249
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,208
Calm down.

250
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,458
This isn't real.

251
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,208
I'm afraid it is Yuki.

252
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,916
You're kidding me.

253
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,875
You've got one, too?!

254
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,000
Is she going to kill me?

255
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:13,916
Wait!

256
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,416
My darts!

257
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,041
Don't.

258
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,708
We both know you're
not going to hurt me.

259
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,500
My diary says so.

260
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,750
Tends not to be wrong.

261
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,500
Your diary?

262
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:38,875
Besides it's not what you think.

263
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,083
You don't have any
reason to hurt me.

264
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,791
He's here.

265
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:47,250
Who?

266
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,708
The local serial killer.

267
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,083
Known to the other
diary users as Third.

268
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,458
Bad apple.

269
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,583
Third?

270
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:54,708
He was slated to
take you out of

271
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,125
the running today,
with a machete.

272
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,708
Good thing I've got
the inside track.

273
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,583
This baby's specialty
is keeping tabs on you.

274
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:08,041
At 6:20 p.m, you're scheduled
to die on the 14th floor.

275
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,291
But, I mean.

276
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,541
You.

277
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,666
All, those entries
are about stuff that I do.

278
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,083
What the?

279
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,791
Well, it wouldn't be much use
to me if it couldn't keep up.

280
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,333
I get the relevant
details on your

281
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,958
future in ten-minute intervals.

282
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,208
The Diary of Future Love.

283
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,916
Ten-minute intervals?

284
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,041
This nut job writes
about me in her diary

285
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,500
every ten minutes on
the frigging dot?

286
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,291
Crazy stalker alert!

287
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:36,291
In a way, your future kind
of belongs to both of us.

288
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,291
That's it!
I want off!

289
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,208
Silly! Don't start getting
paranoid I'm trying to help!

290
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,833
You'll be the first person
eliminated from the

291
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,833
Survival Game if you
get off on fourteen.

292
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,708
What does that mean?

293
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:51,666
I...

294
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:57,375
All Future Diary users are in a
last man standing type of thing.

295
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,416
He's coming for you.

296
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,541
Kay, any second now
she'll start making sense.

297
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,583
If you want my advice,

298
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,916
try not to let your
entries be so topical.

299
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,208
Makes it too easy to track you.

300
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:20,833
Oh, great idea.

301
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,583
Being on the roof makes
getting away a total cinch!

302
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,625
You know the whole "you can
run but you can't hide," bit?

303
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,625
Kind of fits this
situation to a T.

304
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:32,875
So, at least up here we
can take in the sunset.

305
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,625
This chick is certifiable.

306
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,750
If I let her call the
shots, I'm dead meat.

307
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,375
This is an ideal place
to confront him.

308
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,291
Are you yanking my chain?!

309
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,541
I do have a plan, you know.

310
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,541
My darts?

311
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,916
That dart's going to
make or break your future.

312
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,916
Hope you're feeling lucky today.

313
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,125
Where are they?

314
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,125
Hide and seek, is it?

315
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,041
I've only got one shot at this.

316
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,500
C'mon, take out your diary.

317
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,000
Remember, a Future Diary

318
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,250
is equal parts weapon
and Achilles' heel.

319
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,333
The fate of a diary and
its user are entwined.

320
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:40,875
Damn it!

321
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,000
Where the hell are they?!

322
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,375
Destroy his phone.
Destroy him.

323
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,000
Right on the money!

324
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,625
Is that's all we get?

325
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,583
Man, you'd think there'd
be a little bit of blood.

326
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,041
So, what do you say
we grab a bite to eat?

327
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,333
Your mom is out tonight, right?

328
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,500
And you got to have something.

329
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,958
I demand to know
what's going on!

330
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,375
You never said there
were other people

331
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,458
running around with
future diaries!

332
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,541
Neither do I recollect
saying the gift of

333
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,625
future sight was unique to you.

334
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,125
Cheap shot.

335
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,333
Calm yourself.

336
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,791
I've not been duplicitous.

337
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,166
I told you this was a diversion.

338
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,750
What's more, boy,
you stand as its first victor.

339
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,208
Wait. What?

340
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,666
Congratulations, First.

341
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,333
Yeah. Nice work, dude.

342
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,666
Takes some real balls to wipe
out a practiced man-hunter.

343
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,166
I'm looking at the other
diary users, aren't I?

344
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,083
Is that...?

345
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,666
Yuno?

346
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,750
Now that you've all
congregated under the

347
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,708
auspices of my survival game,

348
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,875
permit me to extrapolate
on its rules and purpose.

349
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:31,916
Let us first consider the
diaries in your possession.

350
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,083
Known, rather quaintly,
as future diaries.

351
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:39,291
Having begun as ordinary, linear
journals, their relationship to

352
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,375
time has been distorted
to afford you a

353
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:44,625
window into the future,
up to ninety days.

354
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,250
If I may interject.

355
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,291
Speak your mind, Tenth.

356
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,208
Given your explanation I'm
curious as to how it is I've

357
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,500
witnessed my own diary
rewrite itself multiple times.

358
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:58,333
The future is subject to change
in response to a user's actions.

359
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,583
Consider, for example, gleaning
foreknowledge of some

360
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,375
imminent personal
catastrophe that is to

361
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,416
befall you down the road.

362
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,166
When the appointed hour of
said catastrophe arrives,

363
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,833
the foreknowledge allows
you to take steps to avoid it,

364
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,875
thus curtailing one future
and inaugurating another.

365
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,708
In other words, the
timeline of which

366
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,083
the catastrophe is
part has been left.

367
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:22,291
A new future begins; your diary
alters to reflect the change.

368
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,291
Then I have a question.

369
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,791
My diary has changed
without me doing anything.

370
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,625
I mean, I didn't even
know this third creep

371
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,583
was after me to begin with.

372
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:34,125
None of you is the sole
determinant of your own future,

373
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,250
hence the stakes that render

374
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,958
these proceedings a
test of survival.

375
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,000
Once there is confirmation
that one user

376
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,333
is poised to kill another,

377
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,041
a death sentence will
be entered and the

378
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:46,208
words dead end sent to
your diary as a warning.

379
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,625
How are we supposed
to know who to

380
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,833
kill when we don't
know who they are?

381
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,208
The identity of your
fellow competitors

382
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,416
can be deduced
from your diaries.

383
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,250
So the first thing
we do is figure out

384
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,583
who everyone is and
take it from there?

385
00:20:58,666 --> 00:20:59,875
Precisely.

386
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,000
Unveiling your opponents

387
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,458
will severely compromise
their position.

388
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,791
Whosoever receives a
dead end warning must

389
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,375
marshal all their
resources to undo it.

390
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:12,125
Thus discretion is invaluable.

391
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,333
You, First.

392
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:17,583
Your death at the hands
of Third was written in stone.

393
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,541
But miracle of miracles,

394
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:23,000
you reduced the verdict to
mere scribbles in the sand!

395
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,166
Should we owe this more
to cunning than luck;

396
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,666
you may well be my champion.

397
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,083
In any event,

398
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:31,041
without question your
beginnings bode propitiously.

399
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:36,250
But, what if the cunning
didn't exactly come from me?

400
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,000
Lo!

401
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,666
He who weathers the
vicious onslaught

402
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,708
shall win a throne
incomparable!

403
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,708
Indeed, he will succeed me.

404
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:49,416
Bearing the mantel of
space-time as its reborn god!

405
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,583
Look around you,
eleven only remain.

406
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:55,041
Henceforth, consign
mercy to the outlands

407
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:58,458
of your warrior's heart and vie
for control of the universe!

408
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:01,416
First things first,
you might say.

409
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,833
Well put.

410
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,833
A pleasant day
to you, o' favored one.

411
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:10,333
You'd better stay alive long
enough for me to kill you.

412
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,708
Bye-bye, First.

413
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:13,750
Best of luck to you.

414
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,208
Wait I, uh.

415
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,541
Fear leaves an aura about you.

416
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,458
It sounds like this game
should be interesting

417
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:21,583
hunting down a kid
with your skills.

418
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,000
It... it wasn't skill!

419
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,583
Easy, kid.

420
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:28,125
I'm going to be
watching over you.

421
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,083
You poor little monkey.

422
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:31,166
Please! I...!

423
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,083
I declare this
meeting adjourned.

424
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:40,625
This is insanity.

425
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:43,125
There's just no
other word for it.

426
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:45,166
Don't worry, Yuki.

427
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,500
It'll be okay.

428
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:53,083
Yuno's here to protect you.

429
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:56,958
I'll do whatever it
takes to keep you safe.

430
00:22:57,041 --> 00:23:00,083
Cause that's how
much I love you.

431
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:05,625
♪ closing song ♪

432
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,875
Today's your
lucky day, my friend!

433
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:25,458
You, sir, have
been chosen to be

434
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:28,083
one of twelve Future
Diary Users!

435
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:32,000
Witness.

436
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:33,125
Okay.

437
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:35,791
You give me no choice.

438
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:47,375
Wait, no, no, no!
I'm not!

439
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:50,000
Alrighty then, seems you kind
of have a problem listening.

440
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:53,750
Let's try this again: this time
without the hack-n'-slash.

441
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:56,833
This is a log of your
homicidal conquests, is it not?

442
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:58,166
Your Murder Diary?

443
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,750
Well, you'll be happy
to know I've added

444
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,708
some killer new features to it.

445
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,833
How did you get
your hands on that?!

446
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:05,666
It's what I do.

447
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,500
All evidence must be destroyed!

448
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:13,000
Will you stop that
and listen to me!

449
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:19,791
Moral of the story.

450
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:23,541
Some prospective players take
more finessing than others.

451
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:25,333
Sorry, Third.

452
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:26,750
That's what you get
for being such

453
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:28,916
a paranoid pain in the butt.
