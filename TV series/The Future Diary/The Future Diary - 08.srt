1
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:31,583
Here we stand.

2
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:34,500
Eight prospective heirs to my
throne remain as the gathering

3
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:37,625
dark of time in
peril sounds its knell.

4
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:41,500
The game lurches inexorably
toward its logical conclusion.

5
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,291
Sir.

6
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:48,708
I would like to make a somewhat
controversial request.

7
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,291
I propose transferring
diary ownership.

8
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,750
Temporarily but with
very good reason.

9
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,500
Oh?

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,958
♪ opening song ♪

11
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,916
It's been two
weeks since the kid.

12
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,083
Might as well have been a year.

13
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,833
As far as anyone else knows,
Yuno whacked mom over the

14
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,833
head by mistake while
chasing down an intruder.

15
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:52,416
And Houjou disappeared during
all the commotion afterwards.

16
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,875
Okay, so maybe we
twisted the truth a little bit,

17
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:58,333
but we didn't
tell an outright lie.

18
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:01,250
Not one Kurusu's
wised up to, anyway.

19
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:10,916
Hi, love!

20
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,541
I really like your outfit today.

21
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,500
It's cool.

22
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,416
This is going to
be a total disaster.

23
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,166
I royally suck
at making friends.

24
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,750
So, yeah.

25
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,250
I'm sure you already
thought of this, but...

26
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,750
In the interest of fitting in,

27
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,208
we can probably
assume your phone

28
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,125
and this school
aren't going to mix.

29
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,833
I would put it away before we
even get to the crosswalk.

30
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,000
I mean, that is kind of why

31
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,583
you almost screwed
things up with Third.

32
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,583
Yeah...
Guess you do have a point.

33
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:41,750
I'll just go without.

34
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,000
Can't be that hard to manage.

35
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,583
And as far as making new
friends, who needs them, right?

36
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,000
You still got me.

37
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,708
We'll be in different classes,
but that doesn't matter.

38
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,541
What's wrong, sweetie?
Scared?

39
00:03:58,625 --> 00:03:59,625
Huh? Oh.

40
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,375
Someone's... staring?

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,083
Who was?

42
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,583
Never mind...
I'm seeing things.

43
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,583
Promise me that
we'll walk home together.

44
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,166
I'll wait for you in
the courtyard, okay?

45
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:24,958
Okay.

46
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,541
Roomful of perfect strangers.

47
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,458
How awesome is that?

48
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,416
What the frak's your deal, man?

49
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,208
You think no one's going to
notice a guy on his tippy-toes?

50
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,583
What's he doing here?

51
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,083
Long time no see, Yuki.

52
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,750
How's the world
been treating ya?

53
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,958
Please tell me he's
in the wrong class.

54
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:50,666
This reptile thrives on making
life a hell on earth for me.

55
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,583
More than that...

56
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,458
Ninth almost blew me to
pieces because of what he did.

57
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,041
Dude, seriously.

58
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,291
Isn't it a little soon to try

59
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,750
and make your way
in a new place?

60
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,291
I mean...

61
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:06,083
You did get everyone at our last
school blown up and killed!

62
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,458
What's he doing?

63
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,291
Why's he broadcasting
that to the whole class?

64
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,750
Guess everybody's entitled
to reinvent themselves.

65
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,083
Even little puss bags.

66
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,416
Well good luck
with that, freak show!

67
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,583
You'll have your
work cut out for you

68
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:18,833
so long as I'm around to remind

69
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,875
these kids of the
good old days, trust me.

70
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,625
Shut it!

71
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,708
What was that for?!

72
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,041
Mind your own damn business!

73
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,208
Settle those hormones,
mister Roid Rage.

74
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,250
It's bad form to
fight on your first day.

75
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,416
Oh Hinata; always intervening
on behalf of the underdog.

76
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,208
Of course in this case,
how're you supposed to

77
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,166
know which of these
two brutes that is?

78
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,416
Knock it off, Mao.

79
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,375
You're being rude.

80
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:47,458
You're going to be famous

81
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,208
for that soft spot one
of these days.

82
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,041
I told you to knock it off.

83
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,083
Okay, emo kid.

84
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,916
On your feet.

85
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,791
Quit smiling at me like that,
you little delinquent!

86
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,416
I'll thank you all
to take your seats

87
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,166
and at least emulate
civilized behavior.

88
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,333
Alright.

89
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,041
This is very important
so pay attention.

90
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,916
Walk home in groups.

91
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,166
Murders?

92
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,625
Don't you watch the news, twerp?

93
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,333
Bunch of people have
been totally slaughtered

94
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,458
in this neighborhood the
past couple weeks.

95
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,458
Could Third have come back?

96
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,875
They say the
victims died horribly.

97
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,666
As if they'd been
attacked by a werewolf.

98
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,000
Not even their next of kin
could identify the bodies,

99
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,958
they were so torn up and bloody.

100
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:41,250
We're talking teeth marks,
scratches, the whole bit.

101
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,833
Teeth marks, huh?

102
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,958
Wouldn't forensics have a field
day with something like that?

103
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,250
You've got a point.

104
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,666
Yeah well.

105
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,541
I heard the police are
withholding all kinds of details

106
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,083
about the case to keep
a panic from breaking out.

107
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,375
Then again...

108
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:56,916
I really ought to
run that by Akise

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,625
to see if there's
any truth to it.

110
00:06:58,708 --> 00:06:59,500
Who's that?

111
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,791
Ah, that guy.

112
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,375
Take a look at the
empty desk there

113
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,000
just to the left of you, sport.

114
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,625
The assigned seat of
our class biggest head case.

115
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,083
It's vacant right now
'cause he's probably

116
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,458
ditching to play private eye.

117
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,083
Hey-hey!

118
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,958
Boom.
Okay.

119
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,583
Bear with me this an awesome
idea if you hear it out.

120
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,166
Yuki?

121
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,083
Don't get any ideas about
being the leader; that's my job.

122
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,583
Who're they?

123
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,875
Hey, snooping around the
scene of the latest murders

124
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,416
is as good a way to spend
an afternoon as any?

125
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,625
Nice work sneaking us in, Mao.

126
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,916
It really wasn't as difficult
as you'd think it would be.

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,666
A couple of bored-looking
patrol officers

128
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,958
is all they had for a perimeter.

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,958
Oh shit!

130
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,666
You can totally
still see the blood!

131
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,291
Official chalk outlines
and everything!

132
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,041
That is effed up!

133
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:06,791
I don't know about this.

134
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,500
Yuno looks like she's
ready to blow a gasket.

135
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:10,666
Hey, Amano!

136
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,500
Take a look at this!

137
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:14,333
Eh.

138
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,375
She'll deal with it.

139
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,708
Hey!

140
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:40,750
Come on, spaz!

141
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,291
It's not like we've
all got leprosy!

142
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,875
You should really try some
of this juice, I'm telling ya.

143
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,500
I prefer it right here.

144
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,791
I'm not sure what
I expected to find,

145
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,166
but I thought it'd be
cooler than this.

146
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,083
Oh well... What are
you going to do, right?

147
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,375
Hey, Hinata?

148
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,583
Yeah?

149
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,541
What exactly possessed
you to break the ice

150
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,750
with me in the first place?

151
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,333
You seemed like
someone I'd want to know.

152
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,625
Eh?

153
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,791
Do you mean that?

154
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,916
We should go
check the other side!

155
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,791
Okay!

156
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,166
Mao!
I'm heading out.

157
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,375
Catch me if you can!

158
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,916
Be careful!

159
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,750
She's going to be famous
for that soft spot one day.

160
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,083
Such a character.

161
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,541
She's a good judge
of it herself.

162
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,333
I usually agree
with her choices.

163
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,000
As in this case.

164
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,083
Oh and I should probably
tell you this now...

165
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,375
You don't have a
snowball's chance in

166
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,500
hell of ever being
more than her friend.

167
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,625
Ah...
So she has someone.

168
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:48,291
Maybe she does
and maybe she doesn't.

169
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:49,916
Come on.

170
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,083
Let's go.

171
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:51,958
Hold on.

172
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,958
I'm actually enjoying myself.

173
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,250
Fine then.

174
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,125
Jeez.
Bunch of slowpokes.

175
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,250
There's like the coolest
spot just up ahead, people.

176
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:26,958
What the hell?

177
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,291
The future's rewritten itself!

178
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,291
There's a Diary User
somewhere nearby!

179
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,125
Crap!

180
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,375
What are we supposed to do?!

181
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,208
The others will get
caught in the crossfire!

182
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,208
This is bad news.

183
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,375
On top of everything else,

184
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,375
Hinata's out there
somewhere by herself!

185
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,708
I know I shouldn't,
but this is an emergency.

186
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,083
Yuki, no!

187
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,333
You need to get as far
away from here as possible!

188
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,791
These guys can
look after themselves;

189
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:46,916
they're not your responsibility!

190
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,083
Shut up!

191
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,083
Hinata's the first
friend I've ever made!

192
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,625
I'm not about to
turn tail and run!

193
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,416
No.

194
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,125
One of you going to tell us
why we're running, or what?

195
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:02,000
Whatever this is, man,
it'd better be damn good!

196
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,375
Is that?

197
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,291
Don't let it be.

198
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:17,708
No!

199
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:26,416
Hinata.

200
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,000
This is a joke, right?

201
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,083
Um, okay I'm going
to vote we run like hell

202
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,541
just in case it's not.

203
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,041
Yuki, c'mon!

204
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,541
Need a hand? 

205
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,000
Who the--?

206
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,125
Akise! How long
have you been there?

207
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,666
Longer than you,
to go by your panting.

208
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,000
Let's not stand on
ceremony just now, alright?

209
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,333
If you don't accept my help,
you're dead meat.

210
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,333
Unless we fancy
being doggie kibble,

211
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,500
the thing is to get out
of here before sundown.

212
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,541
The question is how.

213
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,083
Don't take this wrong...

214
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,166
...but your shaking is adorable.

215
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,250
Don't you worry hot stuff...

216
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,375
I can be trusted.

217
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,125
Name's Akise.

218
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,791
And I'm about to
be your best friend.

219
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,833
Through crumbling?

220
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,500
What's his game?

221
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,583
I'm on to you.

222
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,458
I'm sure you've got a lot
of questions, Yuki, but...

223
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:35,583
...there are, kind of more
pressing things to worry about.

224
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,541
There's an observation
deck just up the way.

225
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,875
We should make a break for it.

226
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,416
Watch it, he's not
your dance partner!

227
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,541
Now's really not the
time for petty jealousy.

228
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:50,666
I don't understand.

229
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,208
Why is this happening?

230
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:55,125
We just wanted to
see a crime scene.

231
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,375
My four-legged lovelies have
certainly indulged themselves.

232
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,500
Why can't I follow
their example?

233
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,083
No shame in self reward,
I should think.

234
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,791
Don't you agree Mary?

235
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,708
Ah, the sizzle of
Matsuzaka steak

236
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,916
rings out like an
electric charge.

237
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,458
Served with stew
slow-cooked to perfection.

238
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,458
And, naturally,
the finest vintage

239
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,208
from my special reserves.

240
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,250
And voila!

241
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,875
A banquet not
only fit for a king,

242
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:45,125
but ripe for eternal tribute
via my internet blog!

243
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,250
Alas, I must quell
the urge and hie

244
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,291
this repast to yon dinning hall!

245
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,875
Everyone...

246
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,750
Fill thy superior
gullets to satiety!

247
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,708
Ah, yes...
Such sweet indulgence.

248
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:11,375
Excellent.

249
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,791
The wheels are in motion.

250
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,458
Indeed.

251
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,416
May the road rise
to meet you, poppet.

252
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,541
Protect my diary as you
would my perspicacious pack.

253
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,125
Going to be alright, Yuki?

254
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,041
You look exhausted.

255
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:31,833
Hinata.

256
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,166
Oh, sweetie.

257
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,583
So... Is there like a part
B to this plan, or what?

258
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,500
We're safe for right now.

259
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,208
At least, I think so.

260
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,708
Let's have a proper
introduction this time.

261
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,708
My name's Aru Akise.

262
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:52,000
And my dream is to be a world
famous detective someday.

263
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,000
Oh, uh.

264
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,500
--I'm...
--Yukiteru Amano.

265
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:55,958
I know.

266
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,875
Look, if I came on a
bit strong back there,

267
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,166
it was just my way of saying

268
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,958
I've been sort of
keeping tabs on you.

269
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,333
C'mon, a guy's got to do what he
can to make himself interesting.

270
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,333
I'm an information
junkie of sorts.

271
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,166
The murders around
your old school.

272
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,833
The bombings that shut it down.

273
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,416
And the Omekata cult.

274
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,375
I've been following
it all closely.

275
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,875
It seems that you happen to be
the common denominator here.

276
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,958
Thing is and please don't
take this wrong... anybody with

277
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,666
that kind of screwed up luck
has to be hiding something.

278
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,000
Does this guy
know about my diary?

279
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,000
Dude, you have my solemn oath
I'm not trying to be a creeper.

280
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,791
It's not like I think you're the
evil architect behind all this.

281
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,166
I mean...

282
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:43,458
I know a bloodthirsty madman's
target when I see one.

283
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,333
Believe it or not.

284
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,000
My whole reason for keeping an
eye on you in the first place

285
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,500
was to try and spare you
from more of the same.

286
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,083
Thanks, I guess.

287
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:54,041
Hey, we weirdoes have
to stick together, right?

288
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:55,875
Well, it could be worse;

289
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,541
this guy could be
someone else trying to kill me.

290
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,625
Are you really out to help him?

291
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,041
No offense...

292
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,583
But we should really consider
the situation we're in.

293
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,458
Whoever's controlling the
dogs has got to be close by...

294
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:09,458
...meaning for all we know

295
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:10,916
they're hiding
somewhere in here,

296
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,375
waiting for the
right moment to strike.

297
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,625
Maybe it's the photog girl.

298
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,833
Maybe it's the jerk.

299
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,625
Don't even try
to pin this on me!

300
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,166
Or of course the pervert, who
was kind enough to lead us here.

301
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,333
Knock it off, Yuno!

302
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,375
Oh shit, they're getting in!

303
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,375
This is messed up!

304
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,541
How are we supposed to not die?!

305
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,333
I don't like this.

306
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,666
If they attack en masse, we...

307
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,750
If they go for the windows
simultaneously there's

308
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,458
not enough of us to
keep them all blocked!

309
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,791
They'll get in if we
don't do something.

310
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,291
I've got to tell everyone
which windows to guard.

311
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,541
You know...

312
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,083
If we use them as decoys,
we stand a pretty

313
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,375
good chance of
getting out of here.

314
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,583
Besides one of them
is probably trying to kill you.

315
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,500
Don't even start!

316
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,291
To hell with this crap!

317
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,416
And to hell with the two of you!

318
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:04,958
This is bad.

319
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,708
They're almost in.

320
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:11,458
If I don't use my diary,
we're dog chow.

321
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:15,333
But if I let them in
on my dirty little secret...

322
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,875
...they're not going to want
anything more to do with me,

323
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,833
even if I save us.

324
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,041
Still...

325
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:30,125
I... I can't just
let my friends die!

326
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:31,708
Kousaka!

327
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,750
Two windows to your right! Move!

328
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,041
What?!

329
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,625
Sweetie, no!

330
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:37,500
Shove it.

331
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,458
You're not the damn boss of me!

332
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,750
How'd you do that?

333
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,750
Somebody block the third window
left of the entrance, hurry up!

334
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,791
Gotcha!
I'm all over it!

335
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,041
Mao! Take the window
just to your left!

336
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,750
If you say so!

337
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,375
Now what?

338
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:00,958
Hey, psychic!

339
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:02,833
Where should I be?

340
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,208
C'mon, we don't got all day!

341
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,833
Are you serious?

342
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,416
Whoa...

343
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,708
We're in the clear, right?

344
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,041
Hellz yeah!

345
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,708
That's some serious
magic you're working with.

346
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,250
Hey! You should
be on the tube!

347
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,625
Everyone and their dog'll want
a piece of this mind-freak!

348
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,208
Ha! I can totally
be your manager, dude!

349
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,791
Ah, it's was nothing.

350
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,583
So what's your phone
got to do with this?

351
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,166
You keep staring at it.

352
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,958
Well, it basically told me what
windows the dogs would go for.

353
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,333
I just read off the
text to you guys.

354
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,583
It's like a diary.

355
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,041
Wait, what?

356
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,000
Cell phones have come a long
way in the past few years,

357
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,083
but this is the first I've
heard of an app that

358
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,750
clues users into what
the future holds.

359
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,333
Oh wow.

360
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,000
Is it possible they're
taking all this in stride?

361
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,083
You are some piece
of work, Amano.

362
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,666
You won't mind if I borrow
this for a little while, right?

363
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,916
What the hell are you doing?

364
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,166
You can't take that.

365
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:24,916
You bitch!

366
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,500
Freeze!

367
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,250
At least tell us you're
surprised before

368
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,291
you make a move.

369
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,791
No way.

370
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,500
I'm surprised, too,
though I didn't think

371
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,791
Yuki'd reveal
himself so quickly.

372
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,500
Sorry, Amano.

373
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:41,750
You've been had.

374
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,125
But... you were...

375
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,125
How is she still alive?

376
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,291
Don't even...

377
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,500
You're good.

378
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,875
But I know what
you're going to try to pull.

379
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,875
She's a User.

380
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,583
Don't get your panties
in a wad, sister.

381
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,583
I'm not after
your little boyfriend.

382
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,833
None of this crap
was for either of you.

383
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,541
It's not your
future diary I'm after.

384
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,875
It's the boy detective's.

385
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:22,125
♪ closing song ♪

386
00:21:56,625 --> 00:22:00,500
The name's Aru Akise;
hardboiled gumshoe in training.

387
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,208
Lately, a number of screwball
"happenings" in Sakurami

388
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,708
have been drawing me
in like a dark whirlpool.

389
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:06,916
Twisted things.

390
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,416
Uncanny things.

391
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,333
This cavalcade of the bizarre

392
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:14,166
has a convergence point:
Yukiteru Amano.

393
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,208
I'm en route for a friendly how
do ya do with him now.

394
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,583
A sleuth worth his powder
always knows when

395
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,583
he's on to something big.

396
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:36,708
I am so sorry!

397
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,583
Please tell me you're okay!

398
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:40,916
I've, had better days,
to be honest with you.

399
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,625
Hold tight.

400
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:42,916
I'll call an ambulance!

401
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,875
No hospitals.

402
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:49,041
There's only one place that
holds any hope for me now.

403
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,791
People look like
ants from up here!

404
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,916
How awesome is this?!

405
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:36,500
So, uh...

406
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:37,791
Throwing yourself
in front of my bike

407
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,541
was the best way to get here?

408
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:41,083
How'd you know?

409
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:42,666
Elementary, my dear Watson.

410
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,458
You are, after all,
in the company of

411
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:46,791
a future internationally
renowned detective.

412
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:47,875
Yeah?

413
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,666
But part of your
gambit still eludes me.

414
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,750
Go on.

415
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,666
What conceivable
purpose was served by

416
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,625
making off with my bicycle seat?

417
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:57,375
No idea what
you're talking about.
