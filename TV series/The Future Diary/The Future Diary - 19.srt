1
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:38,166
Mr. Mayor!

2
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,958
Closing the orphanage
would be political napalm!

3
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,791
If we turn those kids
out into the street,

4
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,250
the media will rip us a new one!

5
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:46,500
Well, Balks?

6
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,958
What do you have to say?!

7
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:52,458
What can one say?

8
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:54,750
To think of the friendships
that sustain those

9
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:57,458
children being torn asunder!

10
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:00,375
Weep though I may, the
orphanage stands accused

11
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,750
of sheltering the perpetrators
of the tower bombing

12
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:05,458
which I know in my
very bones to be true!

13
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:06,958
I beg your pardon?

14
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:09,625
The dark seed of sedition
has taken root in that house,

15
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,625
and we must needs dig it up!

16
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:13,250
You can't prove that!

17
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:17,333
So we wait for another
attack on our city?!

18
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:18,666
I swear to you!

19
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,583
I love the children of Sakurami

20
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,708
as though they were
mine own kin!

21
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,958
That goes double for the waifs
that call the orphanage home!

22
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:29,166
I know you would never
throw those blameless souls

23
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,083
to the wolves for mere
political self-preservation!

24
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,375
I cannot allow the
city's orphans to

25
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:39,416
sleep under the same
roof as those terrorists!

26
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,416
Haven't they... haven't they
been through enough?!

27
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:46,125
What objections could
you possibly have to

28
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:49,625
safeguarding our
city and our children?!

29
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:55,291
I can't fathom such
thinking, so explain it.

30
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:02,791
Those who agree with me, stand.

31
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,083
The yea's have it.

32
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:11,541
The orphanage known as Mother's
House will be shut down...

33
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,166
...effective immediately.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,958
♪ opening song ♪

35
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,916
So, you wanna give
First and Second

36
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,458
the old heave-ho
from the game, huh?

37
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,250
There's been no sign
of them for five days.

38
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,083
They haven't even
deigned to show up here,

39
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,875
in the safety
of Deus's presence.

40
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:09,208
It should be clear to all that
they refuse to participate.

41
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,875
Five whole days!

42
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,708
Deus's condition worsens
with each passing hour.

43
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,000
He doesn't have time for them

44
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,416
to "run down the
clock," as it were.

45
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,625
I believe you're right.

46
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:27,000
Such stalling goes against
the spirit of this game.

47
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,583
According to what
Nishijima tells me,

48
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,583
Mother's House is really
taking it on the chin.

49
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,375
I bet it's that windbag,
Eleventh.

50
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,583
He's trying to take down
three Keepers all at once.

51
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,166
Ambitious.

52
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,000
Who is this guy?

53
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,500
In light of these facts,
First and Second leave me

54
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,375
with no choice but
to remove them from--

55
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,875
Not yet!

56
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,583
Geez, skip out on
a couple of meetings

57
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,500
and you're public
enemy number one.

58
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,875
About time.

59
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,291
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Eleventh.

60
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:04,958
I mean...

61
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,125
Mayor of Sakurami!

62
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,041
What do you think I was up to

63
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,750
for the last five days,
huh, Cueball?!

64
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,125
Fair enough.

65
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,208
It seems the remaining players'

66
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,500
identities have been
brought to light.

67
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,500
The need to obfuscate
your appearances

68
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:29,833
within this realm
no longer applies.

69
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:45,750
The prize of
godhead will be mine!

70
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,166
How did you find me?

71
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,000
I want to know.

72
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,291
You make it sound
like it was difficult.

73
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,333
It was child's play.

74
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:00,125
I spent the last five days
right under your nose.

75
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,541
sitting in the lobby
of Sakurami City Hall.

76
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,916
My diary takes note of
everything around me,

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,708
and City Hall is a pretty
happening place!

78
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,625
You wouldn't believe how
much info I soaked up,

79
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,000
just zoning out in a chair.

80
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,208
Right before the vote was held
about whether or not to shut

81
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:24,250
down the orphanage you gave
a speech to the other bigwigs.

82
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,583
That's when you laid it on
thick, because you knew the

83
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,833
measure wasn't going to
pass through the council

84
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:32,166
unless you guilted them
into total submission.

85
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,208
What do you think, Yuno?!

86
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,541
Did I sound like a badass?!

87
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,791
Oh, you were perfect!

88
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,416
Like something right
out of a movie!

89
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,666
Well, I did have a script,

90
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,416
so I guess the
comparison's pretty spot-on!

91
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,750
You hit it outta the
park with this, Yuno!

92
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,541
I just, threw together a
general outline you're the one

93
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,500
who actually had
to pull it off, darling.

94
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,875
Besides, we've only
slowed Eleventh down a bit.

95
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,250
We haven't stopped him.

96
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,375
Stopped him from what?

97
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:09,791
You know.

98
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,375
Going after Eighth's Propagation
Diary, which will be way

99
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,833
easier now that
their home base is kaput.

100
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:21,291
The funding for Mother's House
comes straight outta City Hall.

101
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,875
And I'm pretty sure
Eighth is renting

102
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,791
her diary's server
on the town's dime.

103
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:27,875
If the orphanage shuts down,

104
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,416
then all its assets
revert back to the city.

105
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,625
Yeah but, what could a
guy like the mayor of Sakurami

106
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:36,000
possibly want with a
secondhand server, anyway?

107
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,833
He probably wants
to have his own minions.

108
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,000
What?!

109
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,875
If he pulls that off,
we're all screwed!

110
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,833
It's a good thing I wrote this.

111
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,708
Because there's always a sequel.

112
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,500
All you have to
do is stick to some

113
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,416
scripted cues again,
and win over Eighth.

114
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,541
Yuki, what's up?

115
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,666
I just don't know
if I can pull this off.

116
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,041
That's all.

117
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,833
What the hell?!

118
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,333
I'm not gonna
let you be a quitter.

119
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,416
My baby's going to kill the
rest of those diary users

120
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,250
then send me off to the
grave and become god.

121
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,791
You promised to make
your parents happy.

122
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,750
And I seem to remember
you promising

123
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,833
that to the girl who's lying
on top of you as well.

124
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,583
So suck it up.

125
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,291
You're finished
when I say you are.

126
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:30,791
She's right.

127
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,000
There's no turning back.

128
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,083
My baby's gonna
do his very best.

129
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,208
So that's it, then.

130
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,875
I win, or I perish.

131
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,500
What did you say?!

132
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,250
You heard me, Officer.

133
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,166
Eleventh is John Balks, a.k.a.

134
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,500
the mayor of this
podunk little backwater.

135
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:56,916
But that's impossible!

136
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,416
But wait, there's more.

137
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,791
It sounds like old First and
Second are gunning for him.

138
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,958
Now how much would you pay?

139
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,875
What's the matter?

140
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,708
I just got out of a
meeting with the police chief.

141
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,833
As of this morning, I'm on
the mayor's security detail.

142
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,791
That's some bad fucking luck!

143
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,750
So, whose side are you going to
take when the shit hits the fan?

144
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,291
This is no laughing matter.

145
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,791
So spare me the snark!

146
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,750
"Please forgive my insolence."
There, that do the trick?

147
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,750
Dug up anything on Second yet,
or do I got to do all the work?

148
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,416
Uh... We're waiting
on the lab-work for

149
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,208
one of those bodies
from her backyard,

150
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:36,458
but they bounced us back
positive IDs for the other two.

151
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,375
They belong to
Ushio and Saika Gasai.

152
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,708
Yuno's mother and father.

153
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,083
They came from money,

154
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,833
both sides built their
fortunes in the banking biz.

155
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,708
A match made in yuppie heaven.

156
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,375
By all accounts, they were
desperate to have children,

157
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:57,583
but they never did.

158
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,083
Uh... Didn't you just
call them her folks?

159
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,708
Akise's off trying to get to the
bottom of that very question.

160
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,875
We have two enigmas
on our hands.

161
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,666
Yuno and that corpse.

162
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,208
The plot thickens, huh.

163
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,250
Yuno just flashed the signal.
Is everyone all set?

164
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,708
Just so we're clear on this...

165
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,041
I don't trust you any farther
than I can throw you.

166
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,416
I could say the same.

167
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,250
But for the moment I think
it would behoove us

168
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,375
both if we worked together.

169
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,875
Eleventh has backed Eighth
into a corner with the closing,

170
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,125
and Yuno and I don't want him

171
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:00,083
getting his hands on the
Propagation Diary.

172
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,583
Don't forget, we did
you guys a solid already.

173
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:06,333
Helping with your diary, like we
did, was a sign of good faith.

174
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,000
Let's go over the plan again.

175
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,625
Just as one plus two
plus eight equal eleven,

176
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,333
Eighth and Second
and I are teaming up

177
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,583
to cancel out Eleventh.

178
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,833
I'll start things off by
heading down to the road.

179
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,250
Once I'm there, I'll use
my Indiscriminate Diary

180
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,125
to halt the mayor's caravan.

181
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,333
Then, when the time is
right, we unleash a cloud

182
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,875
of sleeping gas on
his little entourage.

183
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,208
That'll be the signal for the
attack to go into full swing.

184
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,791
Orin, you'll use your diary
to monitor the status of all the

185
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,333
orphans and direct
their movements

186
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,875
during the attack phase.

187
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,500
I got it covered.

188
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,708
Speaking of covered.

189
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,625
Taro will hang back
to defend Eighth

190
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,291
and make sure I don't
try anything funny.

191
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,875
That Copy Diary of yours
is pretty handy, Taro.

192
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,250
You've harnessed the power of
Yuno's phone, and can keep

193
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,458
tabs on me in
ten-minute intervals.

194
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,083
Listen up.

195
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,583
If you try and pull
a fast one, I will take--!

196
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,750
Take me out?
Yeah, I know.

197
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,541
Everything's gone
according to Yuno's script.

198
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:11,666
Hey...

199
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,583
Have one.

200
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,541
They're not poisoned or
anything, so just go to town.

201
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:17,458
Are there enough?

202
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,041
Uh-huh.

203
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,625
I know you're not the sneaky
bastard Ta thinks you are.

204
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:26,041
I was at Omekata and I
saw how you acted.

205
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,375
Eighth seems like
a pretty nice lady.

206
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,791
How does she deal with all this?

207
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,333
Aw, she's awesome.

208
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,833
She doesn't even care about
trying to become god.

209
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,625
She only plays
this game 'cause of us.

210
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,666
We orphans have
been begging her to win,

211
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,666
so she goes along with it.

212
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,666
Because she loves us.

213
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,500
And we love her right back,
that's why we're here.

214
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,125
I know she's gonna
make it a better world if

215
00:12:57,208 --> 00:13:00,041
she gets the chance
to be the new god.

216
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,541
Anyway.

217
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,416
Thank you.

218
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,791
That was very nice of
you to share your onigiri.

219
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,833
I'm glad you like it!

220
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,375
Look, Orin.

221
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,416
I don't think
you should be here.

222
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,583
It's gonna get bad and if

223
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,916
something happens to
Eighth, then you...

224
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,625
Nothing's gonna happen to her.

225
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,500
I won't let it.

226
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,291
Okay, then.

227
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,375
Time to do this!

228
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,333
A roadblock?

229
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:01,916
Oh shit!

230
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:04,875
It's an ambush!

231
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,666
More of them are
coming down the hill!

232
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,958
Take them out!

233
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,458
Wait... that's Yuki!

234
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,708
This makes no sense.

235
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,833
That boy said he spent
the better part of a week

236
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,958
in City Hall he should
know what our plans are.

237
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,666
Why is he attacking us?

238
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:33,541
Megumi!

239
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,125
There's a cop just right
of the smoke cloud!

240
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,625
Jun, pull back!

241
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,000
I'll be damned!

242
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,791
First's plan is working
just like he said it would!

243
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,958
And he hasn't
pulled anything shady.

244
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,416
Guess I was
worrying for nothing!

245
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,333
What the?!
Guys!

246
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,333
There's something on the car!

247
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,333
Huh?!

248
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,708
No way!

249
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,083
What'd that guy do to my phone?!

250
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,083
I can't connect to the server!

251
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,916
I knew I'd have to deal with
Eighth at some point or another,

252
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,625
so I had my
car outfitted with the

253
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,291
latest tech for the
jamming of cell phones.

254
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,375
They can do that?!

255
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,250
You sold us out!

256
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,041
Hurry up!

257
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,791
You got to bust that
thing on top of his car!

258
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You were right.

259
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,458
You traitorous bastards!

260
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,708
She was just a little kid!

261
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,291
We formed this
alliance to hand you to

262
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,291
Eleventh on a silver platter.

263
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:07,708
That's the one reason we stooped
to work with you amateurs.

264
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,375
We didn't come out here
to ambush the mayor.

265
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,041
We trusted you!

266
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,000
And this is how you repay us?!

267
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,916
We came to murder Eighth!

268
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,041
Your lives weren't
taken in vain.

269
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,625
At the end of this
game once I'm a god.

270
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,000
I'll bring you back.

271
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,166
You haven't won the game yet,
you little backstabber!

272
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,375
Kamado, you got to run for it!

273
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,666
Please, just go!

274
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,125
Get in the car now!

275
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,166
We can break through!

276
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,791
C'mon, baby!

277
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,333
We can use this to chase them!

278
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,291
Eyes on the diary!

279
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,625
Take it!

280
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,708
It looks like things
are gonna go our way.

281
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,333
The Diary says we'll
catch up to them

282
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,125
after I shoot out their tires.

283
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,708
Thanks in advance.

284
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,916
Huh?

285
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,500
How could they
have figured it out?!

286
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:34,208
I, I made sure there was
nothing to test it against!

287
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,750
If Yuki finds out, he'll...!

288
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,708
Don't look so worried,
Yuno we're in this together.

289
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,166
I'll never let you go again.

290
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,166
I promise.

291
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,708
You monster!

292
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,666
I lost all of my children
today because of you!

293
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,791
Spare me the theatrics; I know
the score they were lying in

294
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:06,083
wait to spill my blood, so drop
the righteous indignation.

295
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:09,750
But it turns out that your
scheming was all for naught.

296
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,500
Thanks to my diary...

297
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,458
The Watcher.

298
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,250
I will emerge triumphant!

299
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,166
"The Watcher."

300
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,958
Right on schedule.

301
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,958
The fools.

302
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,666
We're gaining on him!

303
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,250
Crap! So they're gonna try
and lose us on the freeway!

304
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,416
Get ready to switch lanes!

305
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:38,041
Bring me up behind them as close
as you can, all right baby?!

306
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:38,791
Yuno!

307
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,125
He's depending on me.

308
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:43,208
I have to shoot the tire
like his diary predicted!

309
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,500
He dodged the shot?!

310
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,333
I'm betting he used his diary to
predict the timing of your shot!

311
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,500
If his keeps track of his
surroundings like mine does,

312
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:52,916
we might have a problem!

313
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,500
But if it does work like Yuki's,

314
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,500
he only knows what's
happening around him.

315
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,750
Forget the tires I'm cutting
out the middle-man!

316
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,666
Missed me.

317
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,541
Wait so, he can predict what's
gonna happen to himself?!

318
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,458
Dammit to hell!

319
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,875
Give the mayor
the strongest one!

320
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,541
Yeah, that's fair, Deus!

321
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,041
So, he intends to force
us off the road, does he?

322
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:21,666
That's rather barbaric of
you First, you disappoint me.

323
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,500
Yuno get up.

324
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,833
Are you all right?

325
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,333
We got to kill them
before they get away!

326
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,041
Huh?

327
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,166
You ready to die?

328
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,958
Not today, little girl.

329
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,041
The arrival of
allies will rob you

330
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,250
of the opportunity
to gun me down.

331
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,333
Your men don't frighten me!

332
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:07,125
I never told you they
were my allies, now did I?

333
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,750
You don't mean!

334
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,625
Akise, what're you doing here?!

335
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,375
Hey, kiddies.

336
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,416
We're all gonna
have us a little chat okay?

337
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,708
You've got the grenade,
so you start.

338
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,416
Hey, I do have an
eye for a good time.

339
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,875
I picked up Sherlock here went
down to the lab and then we used

340
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,750
a police scanner to track
down you party-animals.

341
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,375
They went to a lab?!

342
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,791
Turns out we found a positive
match for the DNA of

343
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:50,000
contestant number three in
your backyard hobby hole.

344
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,125
Our smoking gun!

345
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:55,708
Go ahead, Yuki.

346
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,666
Open it up.

347
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,041
No...
It can't be.

348
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,375
I don't get it.

349
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,166
It's something we were
able to track down at the

350
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,791
orphanage where Yuno was
abandoned as a newborn.

351
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,750
Wait....
Are you saying this is?

352
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,375
You figured it out.

353
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:19,208
That's a bit of Yuno
Gasai's umbilical cord.

354
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,541
Why did they keep that thing?!

355
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,875
We had the lab salvage
whatever DNA they could

356
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,625
from that and
compare it to the DNA

357
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,375
from the mystery corpse
found with Yuno's folks.

358
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,500
And in a delightful
twist to this story the

359
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,458
two samples matched
each other perfectly.

360
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,666
You're a liar!

361
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,166
Yuki, don't listen!
He's lying!

362
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,583
You're telling me that
they were the same?

363
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:40,875
That's right.

364
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,708
And when I say they
matched, I don't mean the

365
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,750
two samples were taken
from the same family.

366
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:46,625
Specifically...

367
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:47,875
Please, Yuki make him stop!

368
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,166
He doesn't know
what he's talking about!

369
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:54,375
It means that the third body
is none other than Yuno herself.

370
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:58,583
The real Yuno shuffled off
this mortal coil ages ago.

371
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:01,458
But, then who is this?

372
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,333
Occam's Razor.

373
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:07,208
If Yuno is dead,
then that girl is an impostor.

374
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:10,208
Whoever she is, I advise
you to step away from her.

375
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,583
No!
I'm not an impostor!

376
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,333
I swear it, Yuki!

377
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,875
I can...!
I can explain!

378
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,791
You believe me, don't you?!

379
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,875
Don't you, Yuki?!

380
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,208
We can get through this!

381
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:24,916
No!

382
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,541
What're you?!

383
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:27,666
No!

384
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,500
Yuki!

385
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:36,500
♪ closing song ♪

386
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,875
Thank you for
all the tasty food!

387
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:11,541
Thanks for not
leaving any leftovers.

388
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Whoa.

389
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:17,916
I guess we forgot one.

390
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,250
Never seen her before.

391
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:26,583
Dig in.

392
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:27,583
Are you sure?

393
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:28,375
No prob.

394
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,333
Now eat it while it's hot.

395
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:32,916
Good, huh?

396
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,208
By the way, are you
supposed to be here?

397
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:36,916
This is an orphanage, you know,

398
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,791
a place for kids who
don't have parents,

399
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:39,958
or who have them but can't be

400
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:41,833
with them for some
reason or another.

401
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:44,416
What are "parents," anyway?

402
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,958
They're, um, the big people
who look out for you

403
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:51,333
all the time and stop you
from getting into trouble.

404
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:56,041
Right here.

405
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:58,750
I guess I've got
someone like that.

406
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:00,125
Well, tell me
about your parents,

407
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,166
then and don't leave
anything out.

408
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,541
I bet you that they're
really nice to you.

409
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:07,458
I can tell that much
just by looking.

410
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:15,250
Nice?
Yeah, Not so much.

411
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:18,166
So, are they super-weird, then?

412
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:26,750
How do you know?

413
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:28,000
They're super-duper-weird!

414
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:29,041
Like, weird, weird?!

415
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:30,583
Weird squared, even!

416
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:32,291
That's a lot of weirdness.

417
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:35,000
And you don't
know the half of it.

418
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,416
Of course they're weird.

419
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,791
Look what they've
got you wearing.
