00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:41,833
- ( people chanting )

2
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,291
- Kirika: NOIR.

3
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:46,791
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE,

4
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:50,291
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH.

5
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,875
THE PEACE
OF THE NEWLY BORN,

6
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:55,208
THEIR BLACK HANDS PROTECT.

7
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,375
- ( water running )

8
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,958
- ( gunfire )

00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,000
- ( grunts )

12
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,500
- ( gasps )

13
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,000
- ( grunts )
- ( grunts )

00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,458
- ( gunshot )

15
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,291

16
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,083
- ( sighs )

17
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,250
( gasps )

18
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,875
( grunts )

19
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,416
CHLOE.

20
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,916
- CORSICA IS
A SPECIAL PLACE...

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,666
BOTH FOR ME AND FOR HER.

22
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,583
- FOR HER?

23
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,750
"HER" MEANING KIRIKA?

24
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,083
- THAT'S RIGHT.

25
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:06,583
SHE AND I ARE QUITE SPECIAL,
YOU KNOW.

26
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,333
SHE AND I ARE
THE TRUE NOIR.

27
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:14,208
- KIRIKA IS PART
OF THE TRUE NOIR?

28
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,125
- ( sighs )

29
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,208
- I COULD KILL YOU.
- ( gasps )

30
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:21,541
- BUT I WOULD PREFER
TO BECOME FRIENDS WITH YOU.

31
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:25,333
- FRIENDS?  WITH ME?

32
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:28,833
- OF COURSE.
YOU ARE HER FRIEND, AREN'T YOU?

33
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,708
I'M SURE WE CAN
BECOME FRIENDS, TOO.

34
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,708
AFTER ALL, YOU ARE
A CHILD OF THE SOLDATS

35
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,000
AS WELL, AREN'T YOU?

36
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,958
- ( breathes shakily )

37
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:48,166
A CHILD...
OF THE SOLDATS.

38
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,958
IN CORSICA,
CHLOE TOLD ME...

39
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,708
THAT YOU AND SHE ARE SPECIAL...

40
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,458
THAT YOU ARE PART
OF THE TRUE NOIR.

41
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:14,083
MY PARENTS BELONGED
TO THE SOLDATS,

42
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:17,041
THE WATCH IS PROOF OF THAT.

43
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:20,083
BUT IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE
TRYING TO PROTECT ME...

44
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:25,250
THAT THEY...
AND MY BROTHER...

45
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,333
WERE KILLED.

46
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,291
- ( crying )

47
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,958
- ( gasps )

48
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:39,250
I KNOW THAT YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN LYING TO ME

49
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,250
AND I RESPECT YOUR SKILLS.

50
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,666
TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST,

51
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,041
YOU'RE A BETTER
KILLER THAN I AM.

52
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,666
- ( gun clicks )

53
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,375
- BUT WHILE
YOU'RE A SPLENDID ASSASSIN,

54
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,166
YOU'RE ALSO
A DISTURBING ENIGMA--

55
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,458
ONE I WISH I'D NEVER SEEN.

56
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,916
- ( crying )

57
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,541
- PLEASE...

58
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,416
GET OUT OF MY SIGHT.

59
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,416
I'M BEGGING.
JUST FOR NOW.

60
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:17,875
- ( whimpers )

61
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,500
- PLEASE.

62
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,833
- ( woman singing )

63
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,875
- IT'S A RATHER GLOOMY DAY,
ISN'T IT?

64
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:49,166
- YES MA'AM.
- ( sighs ) LATE AGAIN.

65
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,166
AND THEY JUST RAISED
THE FARE AGAIN, TOO.

66
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:54,916
- OH.

67
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,916
- I'M ON MY WAY TO
VISIT MY GRANDCHILDREN

68
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,750
AND MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW
AS WELL, UNFORTUNATELY.

69
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,666
SO WHERE ARE
YOU GOING, DEAR?

70
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,041
HMM.

71
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:13,000
ARE YOU FEELING
ALL RIGHT, CHILD?

72
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,041
- I DON'T KNOW.

73
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,666
- HMM?

74
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,041
- MY FRIEND IS SUFFERING.

75
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,083
BUT WHILE
I CAN SEE HER PAIN,

76
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,875
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT...

77
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:27,500
OR ANYTHING ELSE.

78
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:31,041
- YES.  WELL,
THAT WOULD BE HARD.

79
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,500
- ( bus honks )
- HMM.  THERE'S THE BUS.

80
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,875
UM, AREN'T YOU GETTING ON?

81
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,458
- Kirika's voice:
WHO AM I?

82
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:11,125
I AM NOIR.

83
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,375
PART OF THE TRUE NOIR.

84
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:21,541
I'M A DISTURBING ENIGMA.

85
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,333
SO THE TWO RAILS

86
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,416
DON'T ALWAYS END TOGETHER.

87
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,375
- ( cars honking )

88
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,958
- Man:
THIS IS FOR YOU, MISS.

89
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,666
YES, HE SAID THAT
I WAS TO GIVE IT TO YOU.

90
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,000
- HUH?

91
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,333
- LOOK. THE DRIVER OF
THAT CAR BROUGHT IT OVER.

92
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,458
- ( rustling )

93
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,958
- ( gasps )

94
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,666
- I'M GLAD
THAT YOU DECIDED TO JOIN ME.

95
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,291
I WANTED A CHANCE
TO TALK WITH YOU.

96
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,625
LET'S GO, PLEASE.
- Man: YES SIR.

97
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:13,833
- ( engine starts )

98
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,625
- THERE'S NO POINT
IN MY TELLING YOU WHO I AM.

99
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,125
ALL THAT YOU NEED
TO KNOW RIGHT NOW

100
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,916
IS THAT I'M A MESSENGER.

101
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,916
- SO, YOU'RE WITH THE SOLDATS.

102
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,333
- THAT'S RIGHT,

103
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,625
BUT THERE IS
NO NEED TO BE WARY.

104
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,750
SANCTIONING YOU
IS NOT MY PURPOSE HERE.

105
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,375
THAT TASK HAS
BEEN ASSIGNED TO OTHERS.

106
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:41,958
- LIKE CHLOE.

107
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,458
- HER?  NO.

108
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:47,500
IN TRUTH, THE ORDERS
TO SANCTION THE TWO OF YOU

109
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,083
HAVE BEEN GIVEN
TO THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION,

110
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,958
BUT CHLOE ONLY ACTS
ON ALTENA'S WILL.

111
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,833
- ALTENA?

112
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,666
- YES.
ALTENA IS THE ONLY ONE

113
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,416
WHO CAN CONTROL CHLOE.

114
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,375
THAT IS WHY MY FACTION
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU.

115
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:08,416
YOU SEE, ALTENA AND WE DISAGREE
ON CERTAIN PRINCIPLES.

116
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,708
- ALTENA... IS
AN INFLUENTIAL SOLDAT THEN?

117
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,416
- MM-HMM.

118
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,541
"LE GRAND RETOUR,"
"THE GREAT RETURN"--

119
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:20,000
HAVE YOU HEARD
THAT PHRASE BEFORE?

120
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,875
- I HEARD
CHLOE MENTION IT ONCE,

121
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,541
BUT THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

122
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,500
- HMM.  I SEE.

123
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:30,750
ALTENA DESIRES
"LE GRAND RETOUR."

124
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,041
IN PRINCIPLE,
THIS IS SOMETHING

125
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,208
THAT ALL OF THE SOLDATS
AGREE UPON.

126
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:38,708
BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE
METHODS THAT ALTENA EMPLOYS

127
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:39,958
ARE FAR TOO DANGEROUS.

128
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,208
- AND IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH CHLOE AND ME, RIGHT?

129
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,500
- THAT IS CORRECT.

130
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,708
"LET US FEED THE SAPLINGS

131
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,291
WITH WATER AND LIGHT,"
IT HAS BEEN SAID.

132
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,958
WE ARE PREPARED
TO PROVIDE YOU

133
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,625
WITH CERTAIN INFORMATION
YOU DESIRE.

134
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,291
IT MAY BE FOUND AT THE
ALEXANDER TRADING COMPANY

135
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,458
AT 27 CLERY STREET.

136
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,250
- ( dial tone )

137
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,875
- ( woman singing )

138
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:54,708
- MMM.

139
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,916
- ( thuds )

140
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,375
- HMM?

141
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,000
- ( clicks )

142
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,791
- ( rock music plays )

143
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:49,750
- ( dings )

144
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,916
- ( door opens )

145
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,333
- ( gasps )

146
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,541
( sighs )

147
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:18,583
( gasps )

148
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,958
- Kirika's voice: "A SINNER,
ONCE PASSED AWAY,

149
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,916
WILL NEVER RETURN.

150
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,083
HOWEVER,
THE SINS WILL NEVER VANISH.

151
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,083
AND AS FOR THE LOVE,

152
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,875
IT WILL NEVER DIE.

153
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,708
THE HERMIT ALSO SPOKE THUS.

154
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,000
THE BLOOD
OF THE SOLDATS WILL SEEP

155
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,291
THROUGHOUT THE WILDERNESS

156
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,958
AND FLOW
INTO THE GREAT RIVER."

157
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,000
- Man on phone:
YES, WHAT IS IT?

158
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,083
- Kirika:
YOU'RE THE MAN FROM LAST NIGHT.

159
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,583
- WHAT?  YOU?

160
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,500
- A MAN WAS KILLED

161
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,000
AT THE ALEXANDER
TRADING COMPANY.

162
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,500
- YES, I JUST HEARD
OF THAT AS WELL.

163
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:07,500
- THE MAN HAD SOME PHOTOCOPIES
IN HIS HAND--

164
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,875
TWO PAGES FROM THE BOOK.

165
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,041
- YES, WE HAD ATTEMPTED

166
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:15,000
TO GIVE YOU A COPY OF THE
ENTIRE BOOK. HOWEVER--

167
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,250
- DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER COPY?

168
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,916
WHAT ABOUT THE ORIGINAL?

169
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,666
- THE ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPTS, NO.

170
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,416
BUT COPIES, YES.

171
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,791
- THEN I NEED TO SEE THEM!

172
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,750
- THE SITUATION HAS CHANGED.

173
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,500
- MY OWN LIFE IS AT RISK NOW.

174
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:31,041
MEETING YOU WOULD BE
FAR TOO DANGEROUS.

175
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,833
- JUST ONE MORE TIME.

176
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,500
- CARILLON,
TOMORROW AT 8:00.

177
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,583
THAT'S YOUR LAST CHANCE.

178
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,333
- ( clatters )

179
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,541
- ( phone ringing )
- HUH?

180
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,083
- ( picks up )
- ( gasps ) MIREILLE?

181
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,041
MIREILLE, IS THAT YOU?
- ( beeps )

182
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,041
- ( beeping )

183
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,041
- ( bell tolling )

184
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,000
- I HAVE BEEN LOOKING
EVERYWHERE FOR YOU.

185
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:44,166
- THE KILLING AT THE
ALEXANDER TRADING COMPANY--

186
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,541
WAS THAT YOU?
- THAT ONE?  NO.

187
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,208
HOWEVER, IF THAT ASSIGNMENT
HAD BEEN GIVEN TO ME,

188
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:54,000
I WOULD'VE DONE IT
WITHOUT ANY HESITATION.

189
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,375
I ALSO KNOW
THAT A SOLDAT CELL

190
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,041
HAS MADE CONTACT WITH YOU.

191
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,916
HOWEVER, NEITHER OF THESE IS THE
REASON I WAS SEARCHING FOR YOU.

192
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,666
I HAVE NEWS
CONCERNING YOUR FRIEND.

193
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,375
- MIREILLE?

194
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,875
- ( ringing )

195
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,250
- ( sighs )

196
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,166
- YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT THE ORDERS

197
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,875
FOR YOUR SANCTION
STILL STAND.

198
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,583
THE HUNTERS HAVE
NOT YET TIRED

199
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,916
NEW TRAPS ARE
BEING SET IN THE DARK...

200
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,416
EVEN AS WE SPEAK.

201
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,916
- ( breathes hard )

202
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,791
- YES, YOUR FRIEND
IS IN DANGER.

203
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,916
- ( phone ringing )

204
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,625
- TONIGHT AT 8:00
IN GUSTAVE PLAZA.

205
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,375
THOSE ARE
ALL THE DETAILS I KNOW.

206
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,750
- 8:00 O'CLOCK.

207
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,833
- Chloe:
I DON'T KNOW WHAT PRETENSE

208
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,708
THEY WILL USE
TO LURE HER OUT--

209
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:55,875
THE SOLDATS, THE WATCH--
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

210
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,708
YOUR FRIEND IS SURE TO GO.

211
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,250
I THOUGHT ABOUT
LEAVING THIS TO FATE,

212
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:05,500
AFTER ALL, IT IS ONLY
ONE OF MANY TRIALS.

213
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:10,500
BUT THEN,
SHE IS YOUR FRIEND.

214
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,833
YOU MUST DECIDE
THE PATH YOU TAKE.

215
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,208
IT MUST BE YOUR DECISION,

216
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,833
YOUR CHOICE.

217
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,166
- ( phone ringing )

218
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,333
- ( sighs )
- ( beeps )

219
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,041
- THANK YOU.
( breathing hard )

220
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,666
- ( people chattering )

221
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,458
- ( woman singing )

222
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,750
- ( breathing hard )
- HEY, WAIT UP!  YOUR CHANGE!

223
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,666
- ( sighs )

224
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,333
- ( gasps )

225
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,458
- ( breathing hard )

226
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,166
- ( gasps )
- Man: DID I MISS SOMETHING?

227
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,541
- ( chuckles )

228
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,041
- ( clicks )
- ( gasps )

229
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,916
- ( swishes )

230
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,125
- ( gasps )

231
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,041
- ( body thuds )

232
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:24,250
- Man: OH MY GOODNESS!
- ( people scream, chatter )

233
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,875
- HMM. ( grunts )

234
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,000
- ( engine starts )

235
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:48,583
Mireille: A SINNER, ONCE PASSED
AWAY, WILL NEVER RETURN.

236
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,375
BUT THE SINS
WILL NEVER VANISH

237
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,291
AND THE LOVE
WILL NEVER DIE.

238
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,583
THE HERMIT ALSO SPOKE THUS.

239
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,750
THE BLOOD
OF THE SOLDATS WILL SEEP

240
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,666
THROUGHOUT THE WILDERNESS

241
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,291
AND FLOW
INTO THE GREAT RIVER."

242
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,125
( sighs )

243
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:09,041
THAT'S ALL YOU GOT?
- MM-HMM.

244
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:12,458
- SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU JUST
PASSED UP THIS GREAT LEAD...

245
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:14,708
- MM-HMM.

246
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,750
- ...AND THAT YOU
DIDN'T EVEN THINK

247
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,041
ABOUT GETTING
THE COPY INSTEAD OF--

248
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,458
- HM-MMM.

249
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,250
- ( chuckles )

250
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,916
YOU FORGOT SOMETHING.

251
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:39,666
A WOUNDED BEAST ONLY SEES
THE PAIN IT FEELS ITSELF.

252
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,416
SOUNDS LIKE ME,
DOESN'T IT?

253
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:46,541
BUT YOUR WOUND MUST BE
MUCH DEEPER THAN MINE.

254
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,625
SO MUCH DEEPER,
IN FACT...

255
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,916
THAT IT MUST BE UNBEARABLE.

256
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:00,250
- THAT MAY BE TRUE, BUT...

257
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:04,583
BUT I STILL
HAVE TO KNOW IT.

258
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,333
SOMEWHERE IN THE DARKNESS

259
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:20,000
IS MY REAL SELF.

260
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:23,833
OR IS IT THAT THE DARKNESS

261
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:25,458
IS WITHIN ME?

262
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,541
- ( women singing )
