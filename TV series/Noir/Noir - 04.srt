1
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:41,166
- ( men chanting )

2
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,916
- Kirika: NOIR--

3
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,625
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE--

4
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:49,833
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH.

5
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:52,041
THE PEACE OF
THE NEWLY BORN,

6
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,583
THEIR BLACK HANDS PROTECT.

7
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,583
- ( man laughs )
- ( classical music plays )

8
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,250
- ( people chattering )

9
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:10,375
( chatter continues )

10
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:15,125
- UNBELIEVABLE...
( speaks indistinctly )

11
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,250
DID YOU SEE THE LOOK
ON HIS FACE?

12
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,625
- YOUR EXCELLENCY,
CONGRATULATIONS

13
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,250
ON YOUR APPOINTMENT
AS MINISTER OF DEFENSE.

14
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,375
- OH, TANNER!

15
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,041
THANK YOU FOR COMING,
MY FRIEND.

16
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,791
- AS REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE ATRIDE CORPORATION,

17
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:29,833
WE CONGRATULATE YOU.

18
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,333
- BUT THIS IS ALL THANKS
TO ATRIDE.

19
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:33,916
- Tanner: NOT AT ALL, GENERAL.

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,291
OUR CORPORATION BELIEVES
IT IS A DIRECT RESULT

21
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:37,583
OF YOUR INNATE VIRTUES.

22
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,250
AND I THINK YOU WILL FIND

23
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,166
THAT IS ALSO THE BELIEF
OF THE CITIZENS

24
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,208
WHO CONSIDER
THE PRESIDENT'S FACTION

25
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,333
TO BE A SOURCE OF THEIR
FINANCIAL PROBLEMS.

26
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,291
- ( laughs )
THAT MAY BE.

27
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,166
BUT YOU CANNOT DENY

28
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,666
THAT THIS IS
A BIG STEP FORWARD

29
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,791
FOR YOUR PROJECT AS WELL.

30
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,125
ULGIA HAS A NEW LEADER

31
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,625
AND YOU HAVE GAINED
A FORTUNE, MY FRIEND.

32
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,583
- AND WE ARE MUCH OBLIGED.

33
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,708
- IT APPEARS NEXT YEAR
WILL BE FRUITFUL FOR ALL OF US.

34
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,583
- Tanner: YES, SIR.
- HMM.

35
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,083
THINK OF THIS AS
A CELEBRATION IN ADVANCE.

36
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,250
ENJOY.

37
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,791
- Tanner: WE WILL. 
AND THANK YOU, SIR.

38
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,458
- ( music continues )

39
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,750
- WELL, BY THIS TIME
NEXT YEAR,

40
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,583
THIS COUNTRY'S POPULATION
WILL HAVE BEEN CUT IN HALF.

41
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,416
- ( woman giggles )

42
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,416
- HMM?  MMM.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,791
( chuckles )
HEY.

44
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,541
( chuckles )

45
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,041
( gasps )

46
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,625
- ( screams )
- WHAT THE HELL?

47
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,791
- ( people scream, shouting )

48
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,666
- TANNER!  HUH?

49
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,458
- ( screaming continues )

50
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,625
- General: TANNER!

51
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,958
- Mireille:
THE ATRIDE CORPORATION

52
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:18,166
PROMOTES ITSELF AS AN
INTERNATIONAL SECURITY SERVICE,

53
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,416
BUT WHAT THEY REALLY DO
IS COORDINATE <i>COUP D'ETATS.</i>

54
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,333
THEIR USUAL MODE OF OPERATION

55
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:26,583
IS TO LOCATE A REGION THAT'S
RIPE WITH POTENTIAL FOR CONFLICT

56
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,416
AND APPROACH ONE
OF THE LOCAL PARTIES

57
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,416
WITH AN OFFER
TO HANDLE EVERYTHING

58
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,208
FROM PLANNING AND
TRAINING SOLDIERS

59
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,416
TO BUYING WEAPONS.

60
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,083
IT'S QUITE A BUSINESS,
DON'T YOU THINK?

61
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,916
HEY, DID YOU BRING
A SWIMSUIT?

62
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:06,625
- HMM?

63
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,083
- I UNDERSTAND, 
YOUR EXCELLENCY,

64
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,500
BUT WE'VE ALREADY INVESTED
A LARGE SUM IN THIS.

65
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,750
THERE CAN BE
NO TURNING BACK NOW.

66
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,541
YES, I CAME TO ULGIA
FOR THAT PURPOSE.

67
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:45,791
AND IF YOU STILL INSIST ON
BREACHING OUR CONTRACT, SIR,

68
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,458
WE WILL BE FORCED TO DISCLOSE

69
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:50,041
THE NATURE
OF OUR INVESTMENT.

70
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,416
AND YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD
HAPPEN THEN.

71
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:57,583
YES, I SUGGEST THAT YOU DO
RECONSIDER THAT, GENERAL. 

72
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:58,750
GOOD-BYE.

73
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,916
- ( phone clicks )

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,666
- IF CANORA LOSES HIS NERVE,

75
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,791
IT'LL THROW OFF OUR SCHEDULE.

76
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,791
- OH, I WON'T LET HIM CANCEL.

77
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,625
WE'VE INVESTED OVER
THREE YEARS ON THIS PROJECT.

78
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,375
THAT'S FAR TOO MUCH
TO BE MADE UP

79
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,500
BY THE RIGHTS TO WORK
A COUPLE OF MINES.

80
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,583
- DO YOU THINK THAT
TANNER AND FOSTER

81
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,833
WERE KILLED BY
THE PRESIDENTIAL FACTION, SIR?

82
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,791
- IT'S POSSIBLE, BUT...

83
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,625
LET'S NOT FORGET
THAT THE ATRIDE CORPORATION

84
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,625
HAS DONE WORK
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

85
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,625
I IMAGINE WE'VE GOT
A LOT OF ENEMIES.

86
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,583
- THAT'S PART OF OUR BUSINESS.

87
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,333
TANNER AND FOSTER
WERE SIMPLY UNLUCKY...

88
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,791
BUT BAD LUCK
IS ALL THAT IT WAS.

89
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,291
THERE ARE ALWAYS
ANNOYING PESTS

90
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,458
IN NOXIOUS HELLHOLES
LIKE THIS

91
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,625
AND WE DON'T HAVE TIME
TO SWAT EACH ONE OF THEM,

92
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,416
BUT WE WILL
CRUSH THIS ONE.

93
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,500
- ( sighs )
THREE TARGETS LEFT.

94
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,791
THERE'S THE PRESIDENT HAMMOND

95
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,708
AND HIS AIDES
BURKE AND WELLMAN.

96
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,000
THE SEA'S SO QUIET HERE.

97
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,000
- YES.

98
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,875
- IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

99
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,125
- ( panting )

100
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,583
- ( gunfire )
- ( men grunting )

101
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,583
- ( breathing heavily )

102
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,625
- ( engine whirs )

103
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,625
- ( chatter )
- Woman: EXCUSE ME, MISS.

104
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:41,916
IS THIS GATE...

105
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,916
- Mireille: IT LOOKS HE'S
WAITING FOR SOMEONE.

106
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,916
- HIS GUARDS
ARE WELL HIDDEN.

107
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,708
- I COUNT FOUR.
- NO, THERE ARE SIX.

108
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,375
- HMM?

109
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,500
- HEY, DAD!

110
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,625
HAVE YOU BEEN
WAITING LONG?

111
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,333
AH!
- ( gasps )

112
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,500
- WHY DID YOU COME HERE
UNINVITED?

113
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,791
I CAME TO ULGIA
ON BUSINESS.

114
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,833
WHATEVER YOU HAD TO SAY
COULD HAVE WAITED

115
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,166
UNTIL I WAS BACK
IN NEW YORK.

116
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,666
- IT REALLY DOESN'T
MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE

117
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,125
WHERE YOU ARE, ANYWAY.

118
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,375
I STILL WON'T
GET TO SEE YOU.

119
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,625
YOU'RE NEVER THERE
WHEN WE NEED YOU! 

120
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,125
WHY DO YOU THINK
MOM LEFT?!

121
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,208
- YOU'RE GOING HOME
ON TOMORROW'S FLIGHT.

122
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,875
- CAN'T I AT LEAST STAY

123
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,166
UNTIL THE DAY
AFTER TOMORROW?

124
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,166
- NO!

125
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,500
- ( sighs )

126
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,125
I KNEW IT.

127
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,333
YOU DON'T REMEMBER.

128
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,333
- REMEMBER WHAT?

129
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:10,000
- THE DAY YOUR
DAUGHTER WAS BORN, DAD.

130
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,041
- HUH?

131
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,916
JUST BE ON
THE FIRST FLIGHT TOMORROW.

132
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,375
- Mireille:
ROSALIE HAMMOND, AGE 15.

133
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,875
THE ONLY DAUGHTER
OF THE DIVORCED HAMMOND COUPLE.

134
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,375
SHE CURRENTLY LIVES
WITH HER MOTHER JULIA

135
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,583
IN NEW YORK CITY.

136
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,375
THAT'S MADE IT
HARD FOR HAMMOND.

137
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,583
IT SEEMS THAT
HE'S BEEN SO OCCUPIED

138
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,666
FANNING DISPUTES
IN OTHER COUNTRIES

139
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,250
THAT HE RARELY
SEES HIS DAUGHTER.

140
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,083
- SCHOOL.

141
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,166
WHEN I CAME TO,
I WAS HERE.

142
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,125
WHO AM I?

143
00:11:56,208 --> 00:12:00,750
I AM... NOIR.

144
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,000
BEYOND THAT,

145
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,333
I KNEW NOTHING.

146
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,250
( cries )

147
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,625
- ( knob jiggles )

148
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,041
- Rosalie: HEY, DAD.

149
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,791
- DID I WAKE YOU?
- NO.

150
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,041
- ROSALIE.

151
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,041
- YEAH, I KNOW.
I'LL GO HOME

152
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,541
ON TODAY'S FLIGHT
LIKE A GOOD GIRL.

153
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,000
DON'T WORRY, OKAY?

154
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,708
I'LL BET MOM'S PRETTY
PISSED OFF AT ME TOO.

155
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,541
- I'VE ALREADY
CALLED YOUR MOTHER.

156
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,541
I TOLD HER
YOU'D COME HOME NEXT WEEK.

157
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,083
- ( door closes )
- HUH?

158
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:45,041
- ( traffic sounds )

159
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,000
- ( birds twittering )

160
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,625
- ( car horns honking )

161
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:51,916
- IT MAY TAKE A WHILE

162
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,833
BEFORE WE FIND OUT
WHO DID IT, SIR.

163
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,416
OUR PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY
GOING THROUGH OUR RECORDS,

164
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,208
RESEARCHING EVERYONE
THE ATRIDE CORPORATION

165
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,750
HAS EVER WORKED WITH
IN THE PAST.

166
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,208
HOWEVER, I ASSURE YOU THAT
BOTH THE ASSASSIN AND HIS CLIENT

167
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,708
WILL PAY FOR WHAT THEY DID.

168
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,458
- HUH?  STOP THE CAR.

169
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,958
- ( knocks on door )
- THE DOOR'S OPEN.

170
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,625
- EXCUSE US.

171
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,125
- ( door closes )
- WELL, WHAT IS IT?

172
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,208
- A STRANGE LETTER.

173
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,333
IT JUST ARRIVED, SIR.

174
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:40,958
- A STRANGE LETTER?

175
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,625
"NOIR."
- Wellman: WHAT'S IT MEAN, SIR?

176
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,291
- Hammond:
NOIR IS AN ASSASSIN,

177
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,958
ONE OF THE BEST.

178
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,375
- SO THEN IT'S A TIP, SIR?

179
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,541
- OR IT COULD ALSO BE
SOME SORT OF TRAP.

180
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,791
- YES, BUT EVEN SO,
IF IT IS A TRAP,

181
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,875
IT'S STILL AN IMPORTANT
CLUE FOR US.

182
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,916
- HMM.

183
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,833
I THINK IT'S TIME
WE CALLED IN SOME FAVORS.

184
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,208
THERE'S AN ULGIAN MILITARY BASE
NEAR THAT POINT.

185
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,541
CALL CANORA AND HAVE HIM
SEND IN SOME TROOPS.

186
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,333
- Both: YES, SIR.

187
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,458
- ( gasps )

188
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,166
ULGIAN TROOPS.

189
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,250
- WE'RE SURROUNDED.

190
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,166
- HOW DID THEY FIND US?

191
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:48,125
YEAH, IT MUST BE THEM AGAIN.

192
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,916
OKAY, THEN,
CAN WE HANDLE THIS?

193
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,083
- HMM?

194
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,750
- ( growls )

195
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,375
- Soldiers: HUH?

196
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,458
- SHE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY WEAPONS, CAPTAIN!

197
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,958
- Soldier #1:
THERE'S NO ONE INSIDE, EITHER.

198
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:40,166
- SO, TELL ME THEN...

199
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,250
WHAT'S A LITTLE GIRL
LIKE YOU

200
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,916
DOING OUT HERE 
ALL BY HERSELF?

201
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:50,041
WHERE ARE YOU FROM? 
WHERE'S YOUR PASSP--

202
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,125
- ( gunshot )
- ( grunts )

203
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,291
- ( men gasp )
- ( soldier grunts )

204
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,041
- ( soldiers grunt, groan )

205
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:59,500
 ( screaming )

206
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,416
- Soldier #2:
RETREAT!  PULL BACK!

207
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,375
- ( gunfire continues )

208
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,875
- ( screaming )

209
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:15,125
- ( soldiers scream )

210
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,666
- THEY GOT AWAY?!

211
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,000
- FROM WHAT WE CAN TELL,

212
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,083
IT SEEMS THE SCOUTING PARTY
THE ARMY SENT AHEAD

213
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,166
CHARGED IN WITHOUT
WAITING FOR BACKUP, SIR.

214
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,541
- WE STILL DON'T KNOW
ALL THE DETAILS, SIR.

215
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,791
THE ULGIAN TROOPS
ARE IN TOTAL DISARRAY.

216
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,166
AND NOBODY DOWN THERE 
KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON.

217
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,583
- HMM.

218
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,333
I WANT THE TWO OF YOU
TO GET OUT THERE RIGHT NOW.

219
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:31,583
I'LL BE EXPECTING A FULL REPORT
IN ONE HOUR.

220
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,041
- Both: YES, SIR.

221
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,916
- ( door opens )

222
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,208
- ( door closes )

223
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,625
- ( sighs )

224
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,875
- ( urinating ) DAMN!
 HOW DID WE GET STUCK

225
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,875
DOING THE DIRTY WORK
THIS TIME?

226
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,791
- ( zipper zips )
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

227
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,625
IT'S ALL PART
OF DOING BUSINESS.

228
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,541
WE WOULDN'T HAVE ANY JOBS
IF THERE WEREN'T ANY CLIENTS.

229
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,041
BUT WHY BLAME US WHEN IT'S YOUR
OWN DAMN GOVERNMENT'S FAULT

230
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,416
IN THE END?
- ( faucet squeaks )

231
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,958
- IT'S A LITTLE LATE
TO COMPLAIN NOW.

232
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,791
LET'S DO IT.

233
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,500
- ( engine turns over )

234

238
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,958
- ( electric guitar riff plays )

239
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,166

- ( chanting stops )

243
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,583
- OH.

244
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,500
HMM.

245
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,708
- HERE.

246
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,333
- ( giggles )

247
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,416
HUH?
