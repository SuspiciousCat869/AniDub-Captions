1
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:41,416
- ( people chanting )

2
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,291
- Kirika: NOIR.

3
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:46,791
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE,

4
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:50,291
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH.

5
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,875
THE PEACE
OF THE NEWLY BORN,

6
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:55,208
THEIR BLACK HANDS PROTECT.

7
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:58,791
NOIR.

8
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:02,250
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE...

9
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,458
Kirika and Chloe:
TWO MAIDENS WHO GOVERN DEATH.

10
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,458
THE PEACE OF THE NEWLY BORN,

11
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,500
THEIR BLACK HANDS PROTECT.

12
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:11,208
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE,

13
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,458
TWO MAIDENS WHO GOVERN DEATH.

14
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:15,041
THE PEACE OF THE NEWLY BORN,

15
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,041
THEIR BLACK HANDS PROTECT.

16
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,208
IT IS THE NAME...
- NO.  KIRIKA.

17
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,750
- KIRIKA!
- ( gasps )

18
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:48,791
AM I-- AM I...?

19
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,958
MIREILLE?

20
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,958
THE TEA.

21
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,375
IT'S ALREADY GETTING COLD.

22
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,375
- YEAH.

23
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,541
- ALTENA.

24
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,083
( giggling )

25
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,333
- ( sighs )

26
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:46,625
BUT YOU'VE ALREADY READ
THIS BOOK SO MANY TIMES, CHLOE.

27
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:50,708
I WANT TO HEAR YOU SAY IT ONE
LAST TIME BEFORE THE RITUAL,

28
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,625
THE WAY YOU USED
TO TELL ME IN BED.

29
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,666
- ( sighs )

30
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,833
IT IS A STORY AS OLD
AS HISTORY ITSELF.

31
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,500
IT WAS A THOUSAND YEARS AGO

32
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,875
AT THE END
OF THE 10th CENTURY

33
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:07,416
WHEN THE PEOPLE FINALLY SAW
THE TRUE SHAPE OFF THIS WORLD.

34
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,166
THERE HAD BEEN
AN ABOMINABLE PLOT,

35
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,083
AN ATTEMPT TO GAIN POWER.

36
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,000
MANY PEOPLE WERE KILLED.

37
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,125
NEITHER THE OLD AND INFIRM,

38
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,750
NOR THE YOUNGEST CHILD
WERE SPARED.

39
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,625
THE WORST ATROCITIES
THAT MAN COULD COMMIT

40
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,375
AGAINST HIS FELLOW MAN
WERE COMMITTED.

41
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,208
BUT THERE WERE THOSE
WHO SURVIVED THAT HELL,

42
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,875
PEOPLE WHO SAW THE DEPTH
TO WHICH MEN COULD DESCEND

43
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,291
WITH THEIR OWN EYES.

44
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,583
AND THOSE PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD.

45
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,541
THEY KNEW THEN
THE TRUE NATURE OF MAN,

46
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,625
THAT THE EARTH WAS FILLED
WITH EVIL AND DESPAIR.

47
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,458
THOSE WHO HAD SURVIVED

48
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,708
SWORE TO EACH OTHER THAT

49
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,375
THEY WOULD SEEK REVENGE
AGAINST THIS WORLD,

50
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:49,541
THAT THEY WOULD HELP
THE WEAK AND THE PERSECUTED,

51
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,791
THAT THEY WOULD REALIZE
JUSTICE ON THIS EARTH.

52
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:56,083
THEY SWORE A VOW
OF SECRECY AND LOYALTY,

53
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,500
AND FROM THAT SEED
THE ROOTS OF THE SOLDATS

54
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,791
FIRST TOOK HOLD
IN THE LAND OF MEN.

55
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:07,291
THE BLOOD OF THE SOLDATS WILL
SEEP THROUGHOUT THE WILDERNESS

56
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:10,083
AND FLOW
INTO THE GREAT RIVER.

57
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,333
THE SEEDS OF THE SOLDATS

58
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,833
SCATTERED TO THE WIND,

59
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,000
TAKING UP SECRET LIVES

60
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:19,083
IN THE DARKENED SHADOWS
OF HUMAN SOCIETY,

61
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:22,875
IN EVERY PART OF THIS WORLD
WHERE MEN MIGHT LIVE.

62
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:51,416
- THE BLOOD OF THE SOLDATS WILL
SEEP THROUGHOUT THE WILDERNESS

63
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,625
AND FLOW
INTO THE GREAT RIVER.

64
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:57,250
- AND NOW, COUNTLESS
MONTHS AND YEARS LATER,

65
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,833
IT HAS COME TO PASS.

66
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:02,166
THE BLOOD OF THE SOLDATS NOT
ONLY RUNS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD,

67
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,125
IT IS THE WORLD.

68
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,500
- HOWEVER, WE MUST STILL
CONTINUE OUR ACTIVITIES

69
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,541
IN ORDER TO PRESERVE
THIS WORLD.

70
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:13,500
BUT ALTENA--
- YES, ALTENA,

71
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,166
THE MERCIFUL MOTHER.

72
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,166
IN A WAY,
SHE IS CORRECT.

73
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,125
THE IDEALS OF THE SOLDAT
SHOULD BE REALIZED.

74
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:24,708
- BUT IN THIS DAY,
NOIR WOULD BE AN ANACHRONISM.

75
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,041
ALTENA'S ATTEMPTS
AT RESTORATION

76
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,875
ARE COMPLETELY DELUSIONAL.

77
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,791
IT'S JUST A FARCE.

78
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,541
- THE GRAND RETOUR
IS IN ACCORDANCE

79
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,708
WITH THE SOLDATS'
COLLECTIVE WILL.

80
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,208
AS LONG AS ALTENA
CHAMPIONS ITS CAUSE,

81
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,666
WE CANNOT OPENLY OPPOSE HER.

82
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:49,250
- BUT IF WE ALLOW
THE RITUAL TO BE PERFORMED

83
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,458
AS ORIGINALLY PLANNED, THAT
MEANS THAT ALTENA WILL BECOME

84
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,125
THE NEXT HIGH PRIESTESS
OF THE SOLDATS.

85
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,791
- THAT WOMAN DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND ANYTHING AT ALL.

86
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:01,500
POWER AND WEALTH ARE WHAT MAKE
THE WORLD TURN UPON ITS AXIS.

87
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,833
- ( door closes )

88
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,791
- Altena's voice:
IF LOVE CAN KILL,

89
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:59,333
THEN SURELY HATRED CAN SAVE.

90
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,333
THOUGH THE AGES COME AND GO,

91
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:52,500
THE WORLD OF MAN
DOES NOT CHANGE.

92
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,833
THE LANDS OVERFLOW
WITH GRIEF

93
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:59,666
AND MEN COMMIT WICKED DEED
UPON WICKED DEED.

94
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,666
AND AS FOR HEAVEN,

95
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,958
HEAVEN MAINTAINS
ITS SILENCE.

96
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:08,291
BUT SOMEONE
MUST BEAR THE SINS.

97
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:12,125
SOMEONE MUST BEAR THE SINS.

98
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,041
AMONGST THE SOLDATS OF OLD,

99
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,750
THE LEGEND
OF TWO MAIDENS BEGAN.

100
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,416
TWO MAIDENS WHO SERVED GOD,

101
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,875
YET DARED
TO TAKE UP THEIR SWORDS,

102
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:28,000
WHOSE VALOR WAS GREATER THAN
THAT OF THOUSANDS OF KNIGHTS.

103
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:31,708
BLESSED WITH THE MERCIFULNESS
OF THE HOLY MOTHER

104
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:35,791
AND THE GRIM REAPER'S
HEART OF STONE,

105
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,458
TWO MAIDENS
WHOSE BLACK HANDS

106
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:41,500
PLAYED ATTENDANT
TO THE SOLDATS' HIGHEST PRIEST.

107
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,208
TWO MAIDENS WHOSE NAME

108
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,708
WAS NOIR.

109
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:49,958
- Mireille:
I'M BEGINNING TO SEE

110
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,166
HOW ALL THIS FITS TOGETHER.
- HUH?

111
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,541
- IT WAS THEIR NOIR
AND NOT THE ONE WE FORMED

112
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:56,916
THAT WAS THE REASON

113
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,125
THAT THE SOLDATS CAME AFTER
US IN THE FIRST PLACE.

114
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,083
THAT'S WHY
THEY ISSUED AN ORDER

115
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,750
TO HAVE
THE TWO OF US SANCTIONED

116
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,083
YET, AT THE SAME TIME,
HID OUR IDENTITIES

117
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,500
FROM THEIR OWN HITMEN,

118
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,666
EVEN THOUGH
THEY KNEW WHERE WE LIVED.

119
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,666
WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?

120
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,666
BECAUSE THOSE ARE
SIMPLY THE RULES.

121
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,500
- TRIALS.

122
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,666
THE FATE OF THOSE
WHO ARE TO BECOME NOIR

123
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,458
- THAT'S RIGHT.
BECAUSE THE RULES CALL FOR US

124
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,250
TO DODGE THE TRAPS THEY SET.

125
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,916
MAKING US PLAY THE GAME
WAS THEIR REAL GOAL ALL ALONG.

126
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,250
( sighs )

127
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,166
AND THEN THERE'S YOU.

128
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,625
THERE WAS SOMETHING
SPECIAL ABOUT YOUR ROLE

129
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,208
IN THIS FROM THE BEGINNING.

130
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:39,125
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT CHLOE SAID,

131
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,125
THAT YOU AND SHE
WERE SPECIAL.

132
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,708
- MIREILLE.

133
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,958
- OH YES, YOU AND CHLOE
ARE DEFINITELY SPECIAL.

134
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:49,625
DO YOU REMEMBER HOW WHEN
CHLOE FIRST APPEARED TO US?

135
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,000
SHE SAID--
- MIREILLE!

136
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,916
MIREILLE.

137
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,791
PLEASE STOP.

138
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,333
- ( sighs )

139
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,583
WHEN SHE CLAIMED
TO BE THE TRUE NOIR,

140
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:06,000
I FELT AS IF SHE WAS
A REFLECTION OF MYSELF.

141
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,750
BUT IT SEEMS THAT REFLECTION

142
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,708
WASN'T OF ME, WAS IT?

143
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,833
- ( rock music plays )

144
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:30,333
- Altena: PLEASE TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF CHLOE.

145
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,416
THE TIME OF THE RITUAL
IS DRAWING NEAR EVERY DAY.

146
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,166
THE TASK OF GIVING HER
THE FINAL GUIDANCE

147
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,500
MUST FALL TO YOU.

148
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,083
- RIGHT.

149
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:43,000
I WILL,
BUT WHAT ABOUT HER FRIEND?

150
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,208
- YOU MUST KNOW
AS WELL AS I,

151
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:48,333
THAT THE DAUGHTER
OF CORSICA IS ALSO FIT.

152
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,666
- YES, BUT--
- ( chuckles )

153
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,708
BUT YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO FEAR, CHILD.

154
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,541
JUST AS YOU HAVE
ALWAYS BELIEVED,

155
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,000
YOU AND KIRIKA
ARE MOST SPECIAL.

156
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,333
- ( sighs )

157
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,291
- YOU MUST SHOW
HER FRIEND WHY,

158
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,833
AND TO DO SO,
YOU NEED ONLY THE TRUTH.

159
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,291
SHOW HER THE TRUTH, CHLOE.

160
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,750
- I WILL.

161
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,833
- Mireille: IF YOU AND CHLOE
ARE THE TRUE NOIR,

162
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,750
THEN WHAT AM I?

163
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:20,458
NOIR IS A PAIR
OF CHOSEN ASSASSINS.

164
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:24,833
SO IF THE SOLDATS' GOAL IS
TO TEST YOUR QUALIFICATIONS,

165
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,333
WHAT'S MY ROLE HERE?

166
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,291
- ( train rattling )

167
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,791
- Altena:
THE TWO HANDS OF THE SOLDATS

168
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,333
ARE TWO MAIDENS,

169
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:40,791
TWO MAIDENS WHO HAVE
NO FEAR OF BEING SULLIED,

170
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:45,041
TESTED BY THE MOST
RIGOROUS STANDARDS

171
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,708
AND BOUND BY THE BLACK THREAD
OF FATE ITSELF

172
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,250
TO EACH OTHER

173
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,875
AND TO THEIR
MOST SUBLIME DUTY.

174
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,666
- CHLOE HAS BEGUN
TO TAKE ACTION.

175
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,166
- THAT IS NOT GOOD.

176
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,166
- IF THEY ENTER THE MANOR,

177
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,166
THEY WILL BE
BEYOND OUR REACH.

178
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,375
- ( thunder crashing )

179
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:13,250
- TONIGHT WE WILL SET
THE KNIGHTS OF PARIS IN MOTION.

180
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,666
HOWEVER...

181
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,250
- HOWEVER?
- ...WILL EVEN THEY BE ABLE

182
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,125
TO DEFEAT
ALTENA'S CHOSEN TWO?

183
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,083
- HMM.

184
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,125
- AND CAN THEY DEFEAT
THE MERCIFUL MOTHER ALTENA?

185
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,583
ONCE FEARED TO HAVE
GOVERNED DEATH ITSELF?

186
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,041
- ( thunder crashing )

187
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,916
- ( grunts )

188
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,875
- ( panting )

189
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,541
- ( yelps, grunting )

190
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,083
- ( panting )
- ( men groan )

191
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,250
- ( cocks )
- ( grunts )

192
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,958
- ( gasps )
- ( grunting )

193
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,083
- ( gasps )

194
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,291
( yells, grunts )

195
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,708
( breathing heavily )

196
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,875
- ( silenced gunfire )
- ( grunts )

197
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:02,791
- ( yells )

198
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,916
- ( breathing heavily )

00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,958
- ( gun cocks )
- ( gasps )

200
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,583
- ( gunshot )
- ( grunts, gags )

201
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,083
- Altena:
IT IS IN THE NATURE OF MAN

202
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,041
TO COMMIT SIN.

203
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,958
AND NO MATTER HOW
HE STRUGGLES...

204
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:35,000
- ...NO MAN CAN ESCAPE
THAT FATE.

205
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,750
IT IS THEREFORE
OUR DUTY TO SOIL OUR HANDS

206
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,958
FOR THE SAKE OF MAN,

207
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:47,375
JUST AS THE SINS
OF THE SOLDATS OF OLD,

208
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,750
WERE COMMITTED IN ATONEMENT

209
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:53,083
FOR THE SINS
OF MAN HIMSELF...

210
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,666
- ( men grunting )

211
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,916
- ...NOIR WILL COMMIT
SIN UPON SIN.

212
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,958
THE HISTORY OF SIN

213
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,666
WILL BE REPEATED

214
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,041
WITHOUT END...

215
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,666
FOR ALL ETERNITY.

216
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,666
- ( thunder crashing )

217
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
- ( bullets ricochet )

218
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:32,708
- Altena: NOIR WILL
COMMIT SIN UPON SIN.

219
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,250
- ( man screams )

220
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,208
- ( sighs )

221
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,750
- ( gasps )

222
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,500
( gasps )

223
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:15,625
- THE TWO OF YOU HAVE
OVERCOME ALL OF THE TRIALS.

224
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,583
IT SEEMS THE DEPTH
OF YOUR SINS

225
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,875
IS TRULY WORTHY
OF THE NAME OF NOIR.

226
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,708
THEREFORE I HAVE COME,
AS PROMISED,

227
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,416
TO GIVE YOU THE FINAL GUIDANCE
REQUIRED TO REACH THE MANOR.

228
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,125
- AND WHAT'S THIS MANOR?

229
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,166
- IT IS SACRED GROUND.

230
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,916
THE ONE PLACE ON THIS EARTH

231
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,625
LEFT BEHIND
BY THE FLOW OF TIME.

232
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,666
IT IS THERE THAT
THE RITUAL OF ACCESSION

233
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,208
TO NOIR WILL TAKE PLACE.

234
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:47,083
- ( thunder crashing )
- ( gasps )

235
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,208
- I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU

236
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,041
FOR BEING WITH HER UNTIL NOW.
- ( gasps )

237
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:02,458
- HOWEVER, THE TIME HAS COME
FOR HER TO GO HOME.

238
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,166
- ( breathes shakily )

239
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,166
( grunts )

240
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:46,458
- YOUR GUN.

241
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,541
- ( gasps )

242
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:01,791
( gasps )

243
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,833

- ( cocks )

245
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,208
- ( gasps )

246
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:27,125
- TIME TO RECEIVE
THE FINAL GUIDANCE.

247
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,083
- NO!
- ( gunshot echoes )
