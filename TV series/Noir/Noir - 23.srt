1
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,666
- ( voices chanting )

2
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,041
- Chloe: NOIR...

3
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:46,083
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE--

4
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:49,000
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH.

5
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:51,916
TO WARD THE DARKNESS
FROM THE NURSING BABES

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,583
THEIR BLACK ROBES
SERVE AS SHIELDS.

7
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,416
- ( wind blowing )

8
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,041
- ( women singing in Latin )

9
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,250
- ( traffic noise )

10
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,333
- WE HAD A PROMISE, RIGHT?

11
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,833
THAT WHEN ALL BECAME CLEAR

12
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,000
THAT YOU WOULD KILL ME.

13
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,083
- ( clicks )

14
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,791
- THAT TIME HAS COME, MIREILLE.

15
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,958
- ( sighs )
- PLEASE...

16
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,625
DO IT.

17
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,500
DO IT NOW.

18
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,166
( exhales )

19
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:52,833
WHAT'S WRONG?

20
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,625
MIREILLE?
- ( gasps )

21
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:01,750
( grunts )

22
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,541
- ( clicking )

23
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,166
- ( gasps )
WHO'S THERE?!

24
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,708
- ( cane tapping )

25
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,333
- YOU HAVE SOME SKILL,
I MUST ADMIT.

26
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,750
- AND YOU ARE?

27
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,125
- A SOLDAT.

28
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,791
ONE WHO WOULD LIKE
TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

29
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,583
- I'LL JUST BET YOU WOULD.

30
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:46,875
- YES, BUT I PREFER TO TALK
UP ON THE STREET.

31
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,125
THIS COLD AIR
AGGRAVATES MY LEG.

32
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:51,875
- FINE.

33
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,000
- ( birds chirping )

34
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,708
- AH YES, MUCH BETTER.

35
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,000
FEW THINGS IN LIFE

36
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:00,125
ARE AS WONDERFUL AS SIMPLY
SITTING IN THE SUN.

37
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:03,375
YOU MUST BE QUITE TIRED
OF LIVING IN THE SHADOWS.

38
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,083
- JUST WHAT ARE YOU
GETTING AT?

39
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,375
- I WOULD

40
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,583
LIKE TO INVITE YOU
TO JOIN US.

41
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,625
JOIN THE SOLDATS THAT IS.
- ( barking )

42
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,041
- ( groans )

43
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,083
HAVE A SEAT PLEASE.

44
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,291
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO SEE

45
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,833
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ON THE SIDE
OF THOSE WHO RULE?

46
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,250
- EXCUSE ME IF I DON'T LAUGH.

47
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:35,125
- OH, ONE FINDS RULING OTHERS
ISN'T SUCH A BAD THING,

48
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,625
ONCE ONE GET USED TO IT.

49
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,625
YOU DO HAVE
THE QUALIFICATIONS,

50
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:44,041
AND QUITE TRUTHFULLY,
THERE WERE SOME AMONG US

51
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,333
WHO THOUGHT THAT WE
SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT YOU

52
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,958
INTO THE FOLD EVEN EARLIER.

53
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:51,333
BOTH YOU AND YOUR
FORMER PARTNER AS WELL.

54
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,458
- KIRIKA?

55
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:56,375
- I BELIEVE SHE HAS
ENTERED THE MANOR BY NOW

56
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,083
AND GONE OVER TO ALTENA.

57
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:02,625
WHICH UNFORTUNATELY MEANS
THAT SHE IS BEYOND OUR REACH.

58
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,625
- YOU PEOPLE CERTAINLY
DO SEEM TO HAVE

59
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,583
SOMETHING AGAINST
THIS ALTENA PERSON, DON'T YOU?

60
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,916
- YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED
TO LEARN THAT ALTENA

61
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,458
WAS THE ONE WHO WAS
THE MOST OPPOSED

62
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,125
TO DRAWING YOU IN
TO OUR LITTLE ORGANIZATION

63
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:21,458
AND SHE WAS EXTREMELY ADAMANT

64
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:24,208
ABOUT PUTTING THE SAPLINGS
THROUGH THE TRIALS.

65
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:27,125
THOSE "SAPLINGS"

66
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,083
BEING THE CANDIDATES
CHOSEN

67
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,583
AS POSSIBLE NOIRS--

68
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,375
THOSE WHO HAD RECEIVED
THE BLESSINGS

69
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,083
OF THE SOLDATS' HIGH
PRIEST UPON BIRTH.

70
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:41,041
- ( gunshots )

71
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,708
- Man: OUR RANK AND FILE
SOLDIERS KNEW NOTHING

72
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,666
OF THE TRUE REASONS
BEHIND THE COMMANDMENT

73
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,708
TO SANCTION YOU.

74
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,916
THEY SIMPLY FOLLOWED
THEIR ORDERS

75
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,416
AND ATTACKED.
- ( gunshots )

76
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:02,333
- ALL OF THIS FOR NO REASON
OTHER THAN THAT THE TRIALS

77
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,500
HAD TO BE REAL BATTLES,

78
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,833
CONTESTS WHERE LIFE AND DEATH

79
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,916
WERE TRULY ON THE LINE.

80
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:16,541
OF THE SAPLINGS, TWO HAVE
FALLEN INTO ALTENA'S HANDS.

81
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,666
ALL THAT REMAINS IS YOU.

82
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,708
- WHICH IS WHY
YOU'RE MAKING THIS OFFER

83
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:27,583
TO JOIN FORCES WITH ME.
- THERE IS JUST ONE CONDITION.

84
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,958
YOU MUST GO TO THE MANOR
AND BECOME A PART OF NOIR.

85
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,250
NOIR HAS TWO HANDS--
LEFT AND RIGHT.

86
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,416
TO BECOME HALF OF THAT PAIR,

87
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,208
YOU WILL HAVE TO KILL
ONE OF THE OTHER TWO--

88
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,458
CHLOE OR YOUR FORMER PARTNER.

89
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,833
WHICHEVER YOU CHOOSE,

90
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,958
IF YOU SUCCEED, ALTENA WILL
BE FORCED TO ACCEPT YOU,

91
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:55,208
EVEN IF SHE KNOWS THAT YOU HAVE
BEEN INFLUENCED BY US.

92
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,041
- AND THEN...

93
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,708
KILL ALTENA
WHEN I GET THE CHANCE?

94
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,708
- IF ONE PRESENTS ITSELF.

95
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:14,208
I'M SORRY, BUT YOU HAVE
NO CHOICE, MISS BOUQUET.

96
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,375
YOU SIMPLY KNOW TOO MUCH.

97
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,666
AND THE SOLDATS DO NOT LEAVE
LOOSE ENDS UNCUT.

98
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,750
I WILL GIVE YOU TWO DAYS.

99
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,875
I TRUST THAT YOU WILL COME
TO A WISE DECISION.

100
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:07,166
- IT'S MORE LIKE THE MAD
TEA PARTY THAN I THOUGHT.

101
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,541
WHAT WAS IT THAT
THE MARCH HARE

102
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,625
AND THE MAD HATTER
SAID TO ALICE?

103
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,791
"NO ROOM! NO ROOM!"

104
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,875
( chuckles )

105
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:19,000
THREE CANDIDATES FOR NOIR,

106
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,416
BUT ONLY ROOM FOR TWO.

107
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,833
IT'S GOING TO BE
A MAD TEA PARTY INDEED.

108
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,791
- ( women singing in Latin )

109
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,875
- ( dings )

110
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,083
- ( silenced gunshots )
- ( groans )

111
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,125
- ( door creaks )

112
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,375
- HMMM.

113
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,833
I'M IMPRESSED
THAT YOU FOUND ME.

114
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,833
- ACTUALLY IT WAS
EXTRAORDINARILY EASY,

115
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,083
MR. REMY BREFFORT.

116
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:13,208
HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK
CARRY A CANE LIKE THAT?

117
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,250
- AHA.

118
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,041
- ( sighs )

119
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:21,041
AND THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
THAT YOU'VE FORGOTTEN.

120
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,875
- HMM?

121
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,791
- YOU SOLDATS...

122
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:28,166
ARE THE SAME PEOPLE
WHO HAD MY PARENTS MURDERED.

123
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,458
AND NONE OF YOUR
INTERNAL SQUABBLES

124
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,250
MEAN JACK SQUAT TO ME.

125
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,625
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW
YOU'RE ALL THE ENEMY.

126
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,375
- YOU CAN SHOOT ME
IF YOU WANT

127
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,041
AND YOU'LL HAVE
ONE DEAD SOLDAT.

128
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,250
HOWEVER...

129
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:47,250
IF YOU KILL ME, YOUR CAREER
WILL ALSO END HERE AND NOW.

130
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,375
I'M QUITE AWARE
OF YOUR STYLE, MIREILLE,

131
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:54,250
AND I KNEW THAT YOU
WOULD COME HERE.

132
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,291
- OH? THEN WHY?

133
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,583
- BECAUSE I WANTED
YOU TO REALIZE

134
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:02,125
THAT THERE'S NO WAY OUT
OF THIS UNDERWORLD WE LIVE IN.

135
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,333
REMEMBER WHAT
YOUR UNCLE SAID?

136
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,875
- HUH?

137
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,000
- HE SAID NOT TO MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKE

138
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,125
AS YOUR FATHER.
- ( gasps )

139
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,125
- IF LAURENT HAD SIMPLY
HANDED YOU OVER TO THE SOLDATS,

140
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,916
THE BOUQUETS' POWER
WOULD HAVE GROWN,

141
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,875
BUT INSTEAD YOUR PARENTS
CHOSE THE PATH

142
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,458
THAT LED TO DESTRUCTION.
- ( sighs )

143
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:34,291
- WILL YOU REPEAT YOUR PARENTS'
MISTAKE, MIREILLE BOUQUET?

144
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,791
TOMORROW YOU WILL DECIDE.

145
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,041
YOU MUST THINK WELL
UPON YOUR ANSWER.

146
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,833
- ( birds chirping )
- ( gunshot )

147
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,208
- ( music-box melody playing )

148
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,416
- Kirika: I'M BEGGING YOU!
KILL ME,

149
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,916
PLEASE, MIREILLE!
- ( cars honk )

150
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,166
- I WILL KILL YOU, KIRIKA.

151
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,583
THAT WAS OUR PROMISE.

152
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,791
- Man: I SEE.

153
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,875
WE TRUST
YOUR JUDGMENT, BREFFORT.

154
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,166
- YES, I KNOW.

155
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,875
- Kirika: KILL ME,
PLEASE, MIREILLE!

156
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,208
- ( crashes )

157
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,125
- ( sighs )

158
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,916
AH.

159
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,833
- (Mireille reading) "MIREILLE,
I HAVE A VERY BAD FEELING--

160
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:52,625
A PREMONITION. THAT IS WHY
I'M WRITING THIS TO YOU NOW.

161
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:57,458
WHEN CHLOE SAID THAT
THE SOLDATS WAS MY TRUE HOME..."

162
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:00,708
- Kirika:
"I HAD THIS FEELING

163
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,333
THAT I MIGHT NEVER BE ABLE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

164
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,458
THERE IS ANOTHER ME, MIREILLE.

165
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:11,541
IT IS SOMETHING THAT
I NOW KNOW MUST BE TRUE.

166
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,666
IT'S STRANGE,

167
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,375
BECAUSE I WOULD NOT MIND
BEING KILLED BY YOU.

168
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,083
BUT IF THAT MOMENT CAME
AND THERE WAS NO TIME

169
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,125
TO EXCHANGE FINAL WORDS,

170
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,250
I COULD NEVER BEAR THAT.

171
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,041
BECAUSE THERE IS SOMETHING
THAT I WANT TO TELL YOU

172
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:30,375
NO MATTER WHAT ELSE
MAY HAPPEN BETWEEN US.

173
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:34,916
I WAS ALONE, MIREILLE,
ALONE FOR SUCH A LONG TIME.

174
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,958
I HAD NOTHING.

175
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,458
IT FRIGHTENED ME
AND IT HURT.

176
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,291
AND YET...

177
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,166
AND YET I WAS NOT ALONE.

178
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,041
AND ALTHOUGH
IT CAME AS A SHOCK,

179
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:53,125
WHEN I LEARNED THAT NOIR WAS
ORIGINALLY A NAME FOR TWO,

180
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:56,166
MY HEART WAS FILLED WITH JOY.

181
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,041
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY,
MIREILLE?

182
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,291
BECAUSE I FOUND YOU.

183
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,500
AND I KNEW THAT YOU
WERE THERE FOR ME

184
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,416
AND I WAS HAPPY.

185
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,500
I WAS SO HAPPY.

186
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,666
SO HAPPY THAT
I WANTED TO SING.

187
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,416
BECAUSE I--

188
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,750
OH, MY DEAR MIREILLE...

189
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,375
I-- ( sobs )

190
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,625
I'M SORRY,

191
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,958
BUT I JUST CAN'T EXPRESS
HOW I FEEL IN WRITING.

192
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:28,125
THANK YOU, MIREILLE.

193
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,041
THANK YOU."

194
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,041
- ( gasps, sobs )

195
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,000
YOU IDIOT!

196
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,000
( sobbing continues )

197
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,750
- I WILL GO TO THE MANOR.

198
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,208
- AH. I SEE.

199
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,541
- BUT DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME.

200
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:50,416
I WON'T BE GOING JUST
TO SERVE YOUR INTERESTS.

201
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,541
I'M GOING FOR MY SAKE,
NOT THE SOLDATS.

202
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,750
AND NONE OF THIS
CHANGES THE FACT

203
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,666
THAT YOU'RE STILL MY ENEMY.

204
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,958
- ( wings flap, birds squawk )

205
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:16,333
- DO YOU REALLY WISH TO STAY
A MERE HIT MAN FOREVER?

206
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,625
A FIRST-RATE ONE OF COURSE,

207
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,333
BUT ONLY A TOOL
TO BE USED BY OTHERS?

208
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,833
- AT LEAST IT'S A PATH
THAT I CHOSE FOR MYSELF.

209
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:27,250
- IF YOU JOINED US COMPLETELY,

210
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,791
YOU WOULD STAND TO GAIN
ENORMOUS POWER,

211
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:33,166
EVEN MORE THAN YOUR
PARENTS ENJOYED IN CORSICA.

212
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,416
- I UNDERSTAND NOW

213
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,041
WHY MY PARENTS CHOSE
TO GO AGAINST THE SOLDATS

214
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,833
EVEN KNOWING THE COST.

215
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,500
- MMM?

216
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,166
- MY PARTNER HAS BEEN LIVING

217
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,208
WITH A DARKNESS THAT WAS
PLANTED IN HER HEART.

218
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:52,833
MY PARENTS KNEW
WHAT MY LIFE WOULD BE LIKE

219
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,833
AND THEY SOUGHT TO SPARE
THEIR CHILD THAT TORMENT.

220
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,750
- HMM.

221
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:01,000
- MY PARENTS WERE
DEFINITELY SOLDATS.

222
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:04,916
BUT THEY WERE ALSO PARENTS
WHO LOVED THEIR DAUGHTER.

223
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,166
IT'S QUITE SIMPLE REALLY.

224
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,291
- WHEN YOU GET
TO THE MANOR...

225
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,208
WILL YOU SAVE YOUR PARTNER?

226
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,000
- ( sighs )

227
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,208
WHO KNOWS THE FUTURE?

228
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,666
I CAN SAY
ONE THING THOUGH--

229
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,083
THAT THE PERSON WHO HAS
MANIPULATED MY FAMILY

230
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:32,125
AND MY PARTNER'S FATE
WILL ANSWER TO ME.

231
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:17,625
- ( bell tolling 12:00 )

232
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:27,625
- ( bell tolling 12:00 )

233
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:41,875
- ( bell tolling 12:00 )

234
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,291
- ( tolling stops )

235
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,791
- AS YOU WILL.

236
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,291
GO AHEAD AND TRY.

237
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,125
THE OUTCOME WILL NO DOUBT

238
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,041
BE OF GREAT INTEREST
TO SOMEONE

239
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,708
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.
- THAT MAY BE SO.

240
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,583
- THE MANOR IS ON THE BORDER

241
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,583
BETWEEN SPAIN AND FRANCE.

242
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,541
I WILL EMAIL YOU
WITH THE PRECISE LOCATION.

243
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:22,958
THE MANOR IS A PLACE
LOST IN THE DARKNESS OF HISTORY.

244
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:26,291
AND EVEN IF YOU ARE
ABLE TO SAFELY RETURN,

245
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,875
THAT SAME DARKNESS STILL
ENVELOPS THE REST OF THE WORLD.

246
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:39,708
TELL ME, DO YOU INTEND TO
FIGHT THE ENTIRE WORLD ALONE?

247
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,000
- NOT NECESSARILY...

248
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,666
ALONE ANYHOW.

249
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:49,416
- HMMM.
IN THAT CASE,

250
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,333
ALTHOUGH IT MAY
SOUND STRANGE,

251
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,208
MAY I WISH YOU
THE BEST OF LUCK?

252
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,916
- HMM.

253
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,166
- WELCOME HOME, LITTLE ONE.

254
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:19,416
- I AM HOME.

255
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,833
- ( wind blowing )

256
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:01,708
- ( women singing )
