3
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:46,791
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE.

00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,416
I'M ALMOST FINISHED NOW.

10
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:15,916
- THE FIRST TIME WE MET,

11
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,875
YOU ENDED UP
BANDAGING ME THAT TIME TOO.

12
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:22,083
- IT FEELS AS IF THAT HAPPENED

13
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,041
SUCH A LONG TIME AGO,

14
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,916

00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:49,500
TRADITION DICTATES THAT
THE RITUAL TAKES PLACE THERE.

WHAT ABOUT THAT GIRL?

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,583
THE THIRD SAPLING
FROM CORSICA?

AN INQUIRY BY THE COUNCIL
WILL SURELY BE AWAITING US.

DAMN YOU, ALTENA,
AND DAMN YOUR PLANS!

ARE YOU LISTENING

WILL STILL BE PERFORMED.

97
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:42,916
THIS OUTCOME IS NOT 
ENTIRELY UNEXPECTED.

98
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,208
BUT THERE IS STILL
ONE LAST TRIAL

99
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,458
THAT MUST BE OVERCOME.

- ALL THAT MATTERS

101
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,333
IS THAT THE BLADES OF OLD

102
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,625
SHALL BE BROUGHT BACK
INTO THIS WORLD.

103

BELONGS TO THE <i>SOLDATS.</i>

- ARE YOU SAYING
THAT YOU DON'T EVEN CARE

105
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,000
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE <i>SOLDATS</i>
 BECAUSE OF NOIR?

109
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:15,000
THE <i>SOLDATS</i> WERE CREATED 
TO ADDRESS CERTAIN TRUTHS

110
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,625
THAT EXIST WITHIN
THE SOCIETY OF MAN.

111
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,875
BUT IN THE LONG YEARS SINCE,

112
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,208
THE <i>SOLDATS</i> LOST THEIR WAY.

113
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,916
NOW, RAVAGED BY THE VERY DISEASE
THEY SOUGHT TO CONTAIN,

114
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,041
THEY WRITHE LIKE MAGGOTS
IN SOCIETY'S FLESH.

115
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:36,666
- YOU CAN'T MEAN--
- TO REMOVE THAT FLESH,

116
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,666
WE NEED A PURE
UNTAINTED BLADE,

117
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,791
A BLADE DEVOID OF BINDINGS,

118
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,916
FREE TO CUT WITH
THE WILL OF GOD.

119
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,375
AND ONCE NOIR
HAS BEEN REVIVED,

120
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:51,708
THAT IS WHEN THE IDEALS
OF THE <i>SOLDATS</i> OF OLD, 

121
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,333
"THE GRAND <i>RETOUR"</i> THAT
WE HAVE WAITED FOR

122
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,208
WILL BE REALIZED AT LAST.

123
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:59,208

TO HAPPEN ALL ALONG.

( grunts )

125
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,000

126
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,791
WHO WILL OVERCOME
THE FINAL TRIAL. 

127
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,916
THE BOND YOU SHARE

128
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,791
IS THE MARK
OF THE TRUE NOIR.

129
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:29,166
WELCOME, NOIR.
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

130
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,250
- SO YOU'RE ALTENA, HUH?

131
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,958
OR PERHAPS I SHOULD SAY,
"SO WE MEET AT LAST."

132
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,166
- THIS ISN'T
OUR FIRST MEETING, CHILD.

133
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,458
IN TRUTH,
I HAVE LONG

134
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,958
WATCHED OVER ALL OF YOU
FROM THE SHADOWS,

135
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:45,083
EVEN YOU,
MY DAUGHTER OF CORSICA.

136
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,458
- DON'T YOU DARE
CALL ME THAT!

137
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:01,250
- Altena: THIS IS YOUR LAST,
MOST DANGEROUS TRIAL.

138
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,500
COME, CHILDREN.

139
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,666
LET THE RITUAL NOW BEGIN.

140
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:21,041
- THE SURFACE WORLD
IS FULL OF SUFFERING,

141
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:24,000
BUT NOIR IS ALWAYS THERE
IN THE DARK,

142
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,875
FIGHTING TO PROTECT
THE GRIEVING CHILDREN.

143
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:32,333
THIS IS THE TRUE FORM 
OF THE <i>SOLDATS</i> OF OLD,

144
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:35,916
TWO MAIDENS WHO FORGE
A PERFECT BALANCE.

145
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,625
- ( distant gunfire )

146
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:43,333
- ( girl shrieks in distance )

147
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,125
- ( people scream in distance )

148
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,208
- Altena:
IF LOVE CAN KILL PEOPLE,

149
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:37,541
THEN SURELY HATRED
CAN SAVE THEM.

150
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,958
- ( child cries )

151
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,458
- ON THIS ALTER,

152
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,583
THE TRUE RITUAL
WILL BE STAGED.

153
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:45,541
IT IS A PLACE LOST
IN THE EDDIES OF TIME.

154
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,375
AND IN THIS
FORGOTTEN PLACE,

155
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,375
YOUR PILGRIMAGE
WILL COME TO AN END.

156
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,125
- SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED,

157
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,833
INNOCENTS AND <i>SOLDATS,</i>

158
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:59,875
MIREILLE'S FAMILY,
AND NOW CHLOE TOO.

159
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,875
WHAT PURPOSE
DID IT SERVE?!

160
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,500
- ( chuckles )

161
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,875
FOOLISH CHILD.

162
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,833
SO FOOLISH, BOTH OF YOU.

163
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,916
YOUR MOTHER WAS
A FOOL LIKE THAT AS WELL.

164
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,166
- ( gasps )
- YOUR PARENTS WERE BOTH FOOLS

165
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,333
WHO LET AFFECTION
FOR THEIR PROGENY

166
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,416
BLIND THEM TO THE SIGHT
OF THE TRUTH.

167
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,708
BUT THEY DID
SERVE QUITE WELL

168
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,916
AS LAMBS TO BE SACRIFICED
UPON YOUR ALTER.

169
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,916
- ( gasps )

170
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,375
( grunts )

171
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,833
HOW DARE YOU,
YOU MONSTER! 

172
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,916
- HMM.

173
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,833
- YOU'RE NOT WORTH IT!

174
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:14,458
IT'S NOT WORTH SOILING
A BULLET TO KILL YOU. 

175
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,500
- ISN'T IT?

176
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,875
THAN I HAVE NO CHOICE.

177
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:19,916
- ( screams )

178
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,750
( winces )

179
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:30,250
- GO AHEAD, CHILD.
IF YOU DO NOT SHOOT,

180
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,208
THEN YOUR FRIEND
WILL SURELY DIE.

181
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,666
- ( gasps )
- YES, SO MANY LIVES

182
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,416
HAVE ALREADY BEEN TAKEN.

183
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,875
SO MANY BY YOUR HANDS.

184
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,791
ARE YOU REALLY
GOING TO LET

185
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,416
ALL THOSE LIVES 
GO TO WASTE NOW?

186
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,000
SURELY, YOU OUGHT TO KNOW IT
AS WELL AS I.

187
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,666
YOU ARE NOIR, MY CHILD--

188
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,083
BORN UNDER
THE MARK OF CAIN,

189
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,250
RAISED IN A CRADLE OF SIN,

190
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,166
A SUPREME PRESENCE 
THAT GOVERNS DEATH.

191
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,750
IT IS THE PURPOSE
FOR WHICH YOU EXIST,

192
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,333
YOUR SOLE REASON
FOR BEING.

193
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:11,000
- THAT CAN'T--

194
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,458
IT CAN'T BE!

195
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:16,708
- Altena: YOU HAVE COMMITTED
SIN UPON SIN AS NOIR.

196
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:20,958
AND THOSE SINS WILL EXIST
FOR ALL ETERNITY.

197
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,083
( chuckles )

198
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:28,583
YOU NEEDN'T BE
SADDENED BY THIS

199
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,791
FOR THOSE SINS ARE NECESSARY

200
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:34,125
AS LONG AS THE WORLD
OF MAN EXISTS.

201
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:38,541
YOU ARE ONE WHO HAS BEEN
SELECTED FOR THAT PURPOSE.

202
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,375
NOW, PULL THE TRIGGER,
CHOSEN ONE.

203
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,958
KILL ME FOR ALL MY SINS

204
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,291
AND LIVE ON
AS A TRUE NOIR.

205
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,375
- ( breathing heavily )

206
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,250
( gasps )

207
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,500
- PLEASE GUARD MY MIREILLE.

208
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,375
- HUH?

209
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,208
- ( gasps )

210
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,083
- ( gasps )

211
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,625
- KIRIKA!

212
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:30,000
- ( groaning )

213
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,333
( gasps sharply )

214
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,083
( strains )

215
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:46,250
OUR HANDS
MAY INDEED BE BLACK.

216
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,875
( inhales slowly )

217
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:52,500
AND PERHAPS THOSE SINS...
( breathes raggedly )

218
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,583
WILL NEVER VANISH.

219
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,916
( moans )

220
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,500
BUT MY SINS
ARE YUMURA KIRIKA'S

221
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:02,958
AND NOT NOIR'S

222
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:07,916
BECAUSE WE ARE NOT
WHAT YOU THINK WE ARE.

223
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,291
- ( gasps )

224
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,875
KIRIKA!

225
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,625
KIRIKA!

226
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,458
- <i>SAYONARA,</i> MIREILLE.

227
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,041
- KIRIKA!

228
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,208
( strains )

229
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,791
- LET GO, MIREILLE.

230
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,666
LET GO.

231
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,583
- ( Mireille cries )

232
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,625
KIRIKA.

233
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,833
I'M BEGGING YOU.

234
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,625
( cries )

235
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,166
PLEASE.

236
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,250
- IT'S NOIR.

237
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,166
- NOIR'S JUST A NAME.

238
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,125
- BUT YOU'LL STAND ASIDE

239
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,375
IF YOU FEAR
THE HEART OF DARKNESS.

240
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,333
- SO, WHAT DO YOU
INTEND TO DO NOW?

241
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:23,708
YOU MUST KNOW THAT THIS
IS BY NO MEANS THE END.

242
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,791
- WHO CAN PREDICT
THE FUTURE?

243
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,833
WE'LL LIVE
AS WE SEE FIT.

244
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,083
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

245
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:42,291
- IN THE END, ALL THE WORLD 
WE LIVE IN LIES IN DARKNESS.

246
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:46,833
- WHICH IS WHY WE CONTINUE
TO SEEK THE LIGHT.

247
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,583
- HMPH.

248
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:56,791
- MIREILLE?
- UH-HUH?

249
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:59,833
- WHAT WILL WE DO NOW?

250
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,875
- WELL, I'D LIKE
TO GO BACK TO PARIS

251
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,875
AND HAVE
A NICE CUP OF TEA.

252
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:07,791
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT
AFTER THAT, OKAY?

253
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,750
- SURE.

254
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,333
- YOU ARE MAKING
THE TEA, YOU KNOW?

255
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,333
- ( chuckles softly )

256
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:36,625
- ( gunshots )
