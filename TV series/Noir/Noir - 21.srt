- Mireille: NOIR--

3
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,666
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE.

4
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,083
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH,

5
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:51,750
TOWARD THE DARKNESS
FROM THE NURSING BABES,

6
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:54,583
THEIR BLACK ROBES
SERVE AS SHIELDS.

7
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,041
- YOUR GUN.

8

- ( gasps )

11
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:43,500
- TIME TO RECEIVE
THE FINAL GUIDANCE.

12
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,583
- NO!

13
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,458

( sighs )
SHE'S ALIVE.

19
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,666
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?!

20
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,791
- IT'S THE FINAL GUIDANCE.

21
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,500
- HUH?
- THE TRAVELER NEEDS GUIDANCE

22
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,833
IN ORDER TO ADVANCE
THROUGH THE WILDERNESS.

23
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,166
IF SHE REMEMBERS NOW,

24
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,375
THEN SHE WILL SURELY
FIND HER WAY HOME.

25
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,166
AND IF SHE DOES NOT,

26
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,666
THEN SHE WILL DIE ALONE
IN THE WASTELANDS.

27
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,916
- BUT WHY?

28
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,375
IT MAKES NO SENSE.

29
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,666
WHAT'S THE POINT?!

30
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,708
- I HAVE FAITH.

31
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,583
SHE WILL SURELY REMEMBER.

32
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,625
SHE MUST.

33
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,958
ALTENA TOLD ME SOMETHING.

34
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,166
SHE SAID THAT
THE BEST COURSE

35
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,041
WOULD BE TO
TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

36

WHAT TRUTH COULD 
YOU TELL ME NOW?!

39
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,916
- THE IDENTITY OF THE ONE

40
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,333
WHO KILLED YOUR PARENTS
AND ELDER BROTHER, PERHAPS.

41
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:30,750
- I KNOW WHO KILLED THEM.
THE <i>SOLDATS</i> DID IT.

42
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,083
- AND THE KILLER'S NAME?

43
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,583
- THE NAME!

44
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,458
- THE ONE WHO PULLED
 THE TRIGGER'S NAME,

45
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,583
I KNOW IT.

THAT PERSON'S REAL NAME.

55
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,250
OH NO, BUT WHAT
