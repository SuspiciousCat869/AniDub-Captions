1
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,625
- ( voices chanting )

2
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:43,500
- Kirika: NOIR...

3
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,500
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE--

4
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:50,125
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH.

5
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:52,708
THE PEACE
OF THE NEWLY BORN

6
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:55,000
THEIR BLACK HANDS PROTECT.

7
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,125
- ( grunting )

8
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,958
- ( grinding )
- ( Mireille groaning )

9
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:17,750
- ( chuckles )

10
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,041
- HMM?

11
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:33,166
- MM, SUCH SPIRIT.

12
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,041
- ( chuckles )

13
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,625
- BUT YOUR TIME HAS
NOT COME QUITE YET.

14
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:04,000
- JUST KILL HER.
WHY NOT BE DONE WITH IT NOW?

15
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:07,083
- BECAUSE THERE IS STILL
ONE MORE.

16
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,666
- CLEVER.

17
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,291
SO YOU'RE GOING TO USE ONE
AS BAIT FOR THE OTHER.

18
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,750
- ( gasps )

19
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,125
- Chu: NO WONDER THEY CALL
YOU THE COLD-BLOODED KILLER.

20
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,666
- ( chuckles )

21
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,833
- ( metal clangs )

22
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,166
- ( screams )

23
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,500
( coughing )

24
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,208
- ( clicks )

25
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,166
- ( blade snicks )
- ( yells )

26
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,291
- IT SEEMS I'M JUST IN TIME

27
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,708
TO HELP YOU.

28
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,791
- IF YOU'RE REALLY HERE
TO HELP ME,

29
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,791
I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHY FIRST?

30
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,375
- THIS MOMENT...

31
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,125
IS NOT THE TIME FOR TALKING.

32
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,125
- MIREILLE!

33
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,250
- HMM?

34
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,083
- ( snorts )

35
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:04,958
- ( grunts )

36
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,041
- ( women vocalizing )

37
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:22,666
- HMM.

38
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,791
OH.

39
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,833
- ( soft gasping )

40
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,375
- IT SEEMS THE BAIT WORKED
FASTER THAN WE THOUGHT.

41
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:46,375
- GOOD.
SHE'S SAVED US THE TROUBLE.

42
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,541
- HMPH.

43
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,875
IT WOULD SEEM SHE'S MAD.

44
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,208
- NO!
- DON'T MOVE!

45
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,791
- HMM.

46
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,083
- ( blade snicks )
- ( yells )

47
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,375
- ( groaning )

48
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,666
- ( growls )

49
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,541
- ( yells )

50
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,125
- THERE ARE THREE? BUT OUR
SOURCES SAID THERE WERE--

51
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,958
- ( blade snicks )
- ( yells )

52
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,208
- ( distant gunfire )

53
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,416
- HMPH.

54
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,375
- ( clicks )
- ( gasps )

55
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,250
- TIME TO DIE!

56
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,083
- ( blade snicks )
- ( yells )

57
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,166
- ( gunshots )
- ( groans )

58
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,250
- Kirika: MIREILLE!
- AHH.

59
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,333
- YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

60
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:44,208
- ( sighs )
THAT WAS THE STUPIDEST STUNT.

61
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,250
SHE SAVED ME,

62
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,500
BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHY.

63
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,041
- AND THEN SHE DISAPPEARED?

64
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,583
OH.

65
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,541
- ( phone rings )
- ( gasps )

66
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,791
- YAN, THIS IS CHU!

67
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,791
TELL YOUR MEN TO FALL BACK
AND REGROUP!

68
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,000
I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU
AT MASTER WU'S ESTATE.

69
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,541
NOW THAT WE KNOW
WHO NOIR IS,

70
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,625
THERE ARE PLENTY OF WAYS
TO DEAL WITH THEM.

71
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,625
HEY, ARE YOU
LISTENING, YAN?!

72
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,916
YAN!
- ( beeps )

73
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,333
- YOU ARE A DISGRACE.
PITIFUL.

74
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,791
- THIS IS NOT OVER YET, HO.

75
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,083
I'LL IT MAKE UP
EVEN IF IT COSTS ME MY LIFE.

76
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,125
- YES, YOU WILL.

77
00:10:56,583 --> 00:11:00,708
- THIS NOIR, THEY ARE
TRULY THIS FORMIDABLE?

78
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,208
- YES, ELDER.

79
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:06,583
- WHEN THE SOLDATS' AGENT
CONTACTED NOIR THERE WERE TWO.

80
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,750
YET ONLY A SHORT TIME LATER

81
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,583
A THIRD APPEARED
IN AMBUSH.

82
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,583
THERE IS MORE HERE
THAN MEETS THE EYE.

83
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:17,166
- Ho: I WILL
INVESTIGATE PERSONALLY.

84
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,125
- THAT SOURCE OF YOURS?
- YES.

85
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,958
- SHAOLI.

86
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:42,250
I HAD NOT BEEN INFORMED
THAT YOU HAD RETURNED.

87
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:46,000
IN FACT, I HAD HEARD
THAT YOU WERE DEAD.

88
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,958
- HMM.

89
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,791
- YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO THE NAME
OF THE COLD-EYED KILLER.

90
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,625
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE HIRED YOU FOR?

91
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:55,833
- HMM.

92
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,500
( footsteps )

93
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,208
- ( grunts )

94
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,166
- ( grunts )
- ( casing bounces )

95
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,833
- AND THAT'S HOW IT WAS.
- HMM.

96
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:26,958
HMM?

97
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,250
- LOOK OUT! IT'S THE BLON--
- ( silenced gunshot )

98
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,041
- NO, WAIT!
- ( silenced gunshot )

99
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,708
- ( body thuds )

100
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,000
- Kirika: MIREILLE!

101
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,208
OUT HERE.

102
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,000
- Mireille: HO LISHIN.

103
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,583
HE'S ONE OF THE OFFICERS.

104
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,791
THIS IS SHAOLI'S WORK.

105
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,666
BUT WHY WOULD SHE DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

106
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,875
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

107
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,625
- ( honking )

108
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:09,875
THE HONG YIBAN'S HIGHEST-RANKING
OFFICERS ARE ALL DEAD.

109
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,791
IT WILL TAKE THEM QUITE
AWHILE TO RECOVER

110
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,041
FROM A BLOW LIKE THAT.

111
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,458
- AND SO AFTER ALL THAT,

112
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,416
WE ENDED UP DOING THE JOB
THE SOLDATS WANTED ANYWAY--

113
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,041
WITHOUT LEARNING A THING.

114
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:27,875
AND TO MAKE THING WORSE,
SHAOLI STILL KNOWS OUR FACES.

115
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,500
WE'VE GOT TO FIND
AND ELIMINATE HER.

116
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,291
THAT'S OUR TOP PRIORITY
RIGHT NOW.

117
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,666
- HMM.

118
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,416
- ( baby crying )

119
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,375
- ( laughs ) OH PLEASE!

120
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,791
THIS IS A MEDICINE SHOP!

121
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,750
- Man: I'M SORRY,
BUT I COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING.

122
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,916
- THANKS FOR TRYING.
- LATER.

123
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,750
- HMPH.

124
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,500
- ( typing )

125
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,416
- Kirika: HERE.

126
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,833
- THANK YOU.

127
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,333
- YUN SHUTONG.

128
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,708
- I HAVE BEEN
WAITING FOR YOU.

129
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,000
PLEASE SIT.

130
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,958
- THIS IS QUITE CLOSE ENOUGH.

131
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,250
THE CLAN OF THE COLD-EYED
KILLER'S CLAWS

132
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,791
HAVE TREMENDOUS REACH,
SO IT IS SAID.

133
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,916
- HMM.
YOUR UNIFICATION-FUND ORIGINS

134
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,833
ARE SHOWING, MR. YUN.

135
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,750
- YOU HAVE OUR GRATITUDE
FOR A JOB WELL DONE.

136
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,833
SILENCING HO WAS
AN UNEXPECTED BONUS.

137
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:21,750
- AS HO WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO
KNEW YOU WERE THE INFORMANT,

138
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,833
IT SEEMED
THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP.

139
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:27,583
- MM-HMM, A VERY
ASTUTE DECISION.

140
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:30,375
- YES, I HAVE
STUDIED THIS CAREFULLY.

141
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,833
- HUH?
- FOR EXAMPLE,

142
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:35,666
HOW YOU WORK FOR THE SOLDATS,
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME

143
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,000
LEAKING THEIR INFORMATION
TO THE TRIADS.

144
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:41,083
THE WILL OF CHINA
IS A MYSTERIOUS THING.

145
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:44,166
- THE SOLDATS MAY HAVE THE PARTY
UNDER THEIR THUMB FOR NOW,

146
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,208
BUT IN TIME,
THERE IS NO DOUBT

147
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:49,125
THAT WE WILL SWALLOW
EVEN THE SOLDATS WHOLE.

148
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:52,208
"ALLY WITH THE STRONG,"
IT IS SAID.

149
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,708
AN ANCIENT WISDOM WHICH YOU
HAVE MOST CERTAINLY MASTERED.

150
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:59,083
YOU HAVE THE RUTHLESSNESS
TO SURVIVE IN THIS WORLD.

151
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,416
- ( chuckles )

152
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,250
- I SHALL EXPECT
GOOD THINGS FROM YOU.

153
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,583
I WILL BE CONTACT--
( gasping )

154
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,250
- ( chuckling )

155
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,958
THAT'S RIGHT--
THE INCENSE BURNER.

156
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,500
TO ME, IT IS BUT A SWEET
HEAVENLY FRAGRANCE.

157
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:33,583
BUT TO NORMAL PEOPLE,
IT IS THE BRINGER OF DEATH.

158
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,416
- T-TRAITOR.

159
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
- OH, NOT A TRAITOR.

160
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:41,625
JUST A GIRL WITH THE
RUTHLESSNESS NEEDED TO SURVIVE.

161
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,416
- THEN WHY KILL ME TOO?

162
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,791
- TO "ALLY WITH THE STRONG."

163
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,583
IF I COME BEARING
