1
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,625
- ( voices chanting )

2
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:43,500
- Woman: NOIR...

3
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,500
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE--

4
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:50,125
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH.

5
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:52,708
THE PEACE
OF THE NEWLY BORN

6
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:55,000
THEIR BLACK HANDS PROTECT.

7
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:01,958
- ( accordion folk music
playing )

8
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,875
- HMM.

9
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,916
HUH?

10
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:42,041
( thinking ) "MAKE A PILGRIMAGE
FOR THE PAST WITH ME."

11
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,041
A PILGRIMAGE TO THE PAST?

12
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,583
OH WHATEVER.
THIS IS STUPID.

13
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,833
- ( music-box melody playing )
- ( gasps )

14
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,791
- ( students chattering )

15
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,750
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

16
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,625
- SHALL WE TALK?

17
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:47,000
SUPPOSE WE START
WITH WHO YOU ARE?

18
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,375
( grunts )

19
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,958
- ( music-box melody playing )
- ( hisses )

20
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,791
( gasps )

21
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,000
( gasps )

22
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,208
( grunts )

23
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,583
( running footsteps )

24
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,125
- ( music-box melody playing )
- ( wind blowing )

25
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,625
- END OF THE LINE?

26
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,666
NOT MUCH OF A PILGRIMAGE, HUH?

27
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,250
- ( melody stops )

28
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,458
- I'M GOING TO ASK YOU
ONE LAST TIME.

29
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,208
WHO ARE YOU?
START TALKING.

30
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:26,500
- NOIR.

31
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,250
- NOIR?
- I KNEW YOU WOULD COME.

32
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:32,875
I'VE BEEN WAITING.
- ( shudders )

33
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:42,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

34
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,125
- ( gunshots )

35
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,625
- ( gasps )
- ( gunshots )

36
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,458
- ( yells )

37
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,666
- YOU LITTLE...

38
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,208
( grunts )

39
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,166
- ( men groan )
- ( casings clatter )

40
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,041
- ( panting )

41
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,125
- ( distant gunfire )

42
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,500
- ( thinking )
AREN'T THEY AFTER ME?

43
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,500
OR ARE THEY?

44
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,791
( footsteps )

45
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,625
DON'T TELL ME
SHE DID ALL OF THIS.

46
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,500
( grunts )

47
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,250
( gasps )

48
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,458
- ( man grunts )

49
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,375
- HMPH.

50
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,708
- ( gunshot )
- ( groans )

51
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,208
- ( gunshots )

52
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,541
- ( gasps )

53
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,583
- ( man grunts )

54
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,125
( body thuds )

55
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,541
- ( grunting )

56
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,875
( man gags )

57
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,291
- IT WOULD SEEM THAT KILLING
IS SOMETHING

58
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,541
THAT I CAN DO SO EASILY.

59
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,666
BUT WHY CAN'T I...

60
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,541
FEEL SORROW
FOR WHAT I'VE DONE?

61
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,166
- Noir: THAT SHOULD DO IT.

62
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,666
- YES, IT SHOULD. IT'S AN
EXCELLENT FIELD DRESSING.

63
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,375
DID YOU TRAIN AS A MEDIC?

64
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,500
- I DON'T KNOW.

65
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,791
- SO THIS IS WHERE YOU LIVE.

66
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,041
- MM-HMM.

67
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,541
- BUT IT'S NOT REALLY
YOUR HOME, IS IT?

68
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,875
- YUMURA, KIRIKA.

69
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,083
THAT'S MY NAME.

70
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,500
- AND THAT ISN'T
YOUR REAL NAME EITHER.

71
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:20,875
- MM.

72
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,833
- I'VE DONE SOME
CHECKING UP ON YOU.

73
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:23,875
- HUH?

74
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,833
- IT SEEMS THE YUMURA FAMILY
OF THREE

75
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,875
BOUGHT THIS HOUSE
HALF A YEAR AGO.

76
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,833
THREE PEOPLE MOVED IN.

77
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,041
BUT WITHIN A FEW MONTHS,

78
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,500
BOTH OF THE PARENTS
HAD LEFT FOR AMERICA.

79
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,125
NEW JOBS SUPPOSEDLY,

80
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,583
WHILE THE DAUGHTER STAYED
BEHIND TO ATTEND SCHOOL.

81
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:39,583
- MM.

82
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,750
- BUT IT WAS ALL JUST
AN ELABORATE WORK OF FICTION.

83
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:48,333
AND THE DOCUMENTS SUBMITTED
TO THE SCHOOL AND PUBLIC OFFICES

84
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,375
WERE FORGED, RIGHT?

85
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,500
( huffs )

86
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,541
THE FAMILY REGISTER,
THE PARENTS' EMPLOYERS,

87
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,666
NONE OF IT EVER
ACTUALLY EXISTED.

88
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,708
AND THE YUMURA
HUSBAND AND WIFE

89
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,708
DISAPPEARED WITHOUT A TRACE.
- ( gun clattering )

90
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,083
- SO NOW WHY WOULD
SOMEONE HAVE BEEN PRETENDING

91
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,708
TO BE YOUR PARENTS?

92
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,333
- THREE QUESTIONS:
WHO ARE YOU,

93
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,458
WHERE DID YOU COME FROM
AND WHY ARE YOU HERE?

94
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:21,958
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

95
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,083
- I DON'T KNOW WHY

96
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,166
I KNOW HOW TO DO
THINGS LIKE THIS.

97
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,416
HOW CAN I KNOW THIS?

98
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,625
HOW CAN I KNOW...

99
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,041
WHEN I KNOW NOTHING ELSE?

100
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,291
WHEN I CAME TO,

101
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,708
I WAS HERE.

102
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,625
WHO AM I?

103
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,958
I AM...

104
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,458
NOIR.

105
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,416
BEYOND THAT,

106
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
I KNEW NOTHING.

107
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,833
- ( sighs )

108
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:33,625
( gasps )

109
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,208
- Noir's voice:
AND THEN I...

110
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,875
FOUND THIS.

111
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,750
THAT ISN'T ALL.

112
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,750
I LEARNED
I KNOW TERRIBLE THINGS.

113
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,375
I DO.

114
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,750
BUT WHY?

115
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,625
- AND YOU DON'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING ABOUT YOURSELF?

116
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,875
- HUH-UH.
- WHAT ABOUT ME?

117
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,208
- MIREILLE BOUQUET,

118
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:51,458
A MOST TRUSTWORTHY
ASSASSIN FOR HIRE.

119
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:52,916
- I SEE.

120
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,166
WELL, LET'S MOVE ON
TO THE NEXT TOPIC, SHALL WE?

121
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,416
I KNOW YOU FOUND MORE
THAN JUST THIS GUN.

122
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:07,958
YOU HAVE ONE MORE THING
THAT YOU'VE BEEN HIDING.

123
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,916
- HMM?

124
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,458
- TAKE IT OUT.

125
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,041
- ( music-box melody playing )

126
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,416
- ( gasps )

127
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,333
- ( ticking, music continues )

128
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,458
- ( ragged breath )

129
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,000
( sobbing )
- ( echoing ticking )

130
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,958
- ( orchestra playing melody )

131
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,875
- STOP IT.
- ( clicks off )

132
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:15,750
- YOU KNOW, DON'T YOU?

133
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,541
YOU KNOW...

134
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,541
- ( score playing )

135
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,916
- ( gasps )

136
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,958
- ( gunshots )

137
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,666
- Mireille: AND THEN...

138
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,833
YOU CONTACTED ME.

139
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,500
- NOT MUCH
OF A PILGRIMAGE, HUH?

140
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,625
- NOIR...

141
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:42,625
- NOIR?

142
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,833
- A PILGRIMAGE

143
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,458
TO YOUR PAST AND MINE.

144
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,000
- ( gasps )

145
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,250
- LET'S START

146
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:00,375
WITH THE SIMPLE FACT
THAT I KILL PEOPLE FOR A LIVING.

147
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,916
I'M NOT IN BUSINESS
TO HELP YOU.

148
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,500
THEN...

149
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,500
THERE'S THE FACT THAT I HAVE
ALWAYS PREFERRED TO WORK ALONE.

150
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,916
AND I INTEND
TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.

151
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,625
- PLEASE LEND ME YOUR HELP,
MIREILLE.

152
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,500
I NEED YOUR HELP
TO FIND OUT WHAT I AM.

153
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,333
I NEED YOUR HELP UNTIL...

154
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,833
UNTIL...

155
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,458
I FIND THAT ANSWER.

156
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,291
- ( sighs )

157
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,083
Mireille: I'VE MADE
THE ARRANGEMENTS

158
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,416
TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY.

159
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,541
- Noir: THANK YOU.

160
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,333
- SO ARE YOU ABOUT FINISHED?

161
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,333
- MM-HMM.

162
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,625
- I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

163
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,583
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO SAY
GOODBYE IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?

164
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:23,708
- HMM.
- "EVEN WHEN I WAS IN A CROWD,

165
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:27,208
I WAS ALWAYS ALONE."
- HUH?

166
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,500
- I'M AFRAID THAT'S NOT MINE.

167
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,875
IT'S ERNEST HEMINGWAY,
I BELIEVE.

168
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,458
- I'M READY
TO GO NOW, MIREILLE.

169
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,708
- Mireille: YOU KNOW WHAT
IT IS THAT I DO FOR A LIVING.

170
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,833
AND YOU KNOW

171
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,208
THAT MEANS I CAN'T
LET YOU LIVE.

172
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:06,750
- Noir: YES.

173
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,708
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TEAM UP WITH YOU.

174
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,666
THEY'RE SURE
TO COME AFTER US AGAIN.

175
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,875
- ( typing )
- AND WHEN THEY DO,

176
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:21,750
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO ASK THEM.

177
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,833
ONCE THAT'S OVER,

178
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:27,041
I WILL KILL YOU.

179
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,625
- I'LL BE WAITING

180
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,708
FOR THAT MOMENT.

181
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:17,125
