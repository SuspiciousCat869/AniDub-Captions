1
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:41,041
- ( people chanting )

2
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:42,916
- Chloe: NOIR.

3
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,416
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE,

4
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,583
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH.

5
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:51,916
TO THE DEPTHS
OF HELL'S FIRE,

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,333
THEIR BLACK SOULS
LURE THE LOST CHILDREN.

7
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:59,333
- ( birds chirping )

8
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,416
- ( moans )

9
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,833
- Altena's voice:
"MY DARLING CHLOE,

10
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:35,166
I REJOICE TO HEAR THAT
YOU HAVE SAFELY ACCOMPLISHED

11
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,083
YOUR ASSIGNED TASK.

12
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:42,125
I ANTICIPATE YOUR RETURN
FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.

13
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:46,458
HOWEVER, BEFORE THAT
JOYOUS EVENT CAN OCCUR,

14
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,541
I REGRET TO INFORM YOU

15
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,875
THAT THERE IS ONE MORE JOB
THAT I MUST HAVE YOU DO."

16
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,208
- ( stomps, clanks )

17
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:09,666
- ( door closes )

18
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,750
- ( sighing )

19
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,166
- SOMETHING'S WRONG.
THEY'RE LATE.

20
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,458
- Man: I'M AFRAID YOU ARE
WASTING YOUR TIME WAITING.

21
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,583
- Man #2: Z-- ZELLNER!

22
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,083
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

23
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,583
- YOUR FRIENDS HAVE
LEFT THIS WORLD

24
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,166
ONE STEP AHEAD OF YOU.

25
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,000
- WH-- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- ( gasps )

26
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,166
- ( cocks )

27
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,541
- DIVERTING SOME
OF MY PRECIOUS PRODUCT

28
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:53,958
WAS A MISTAKE.

29
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,916
A MISTAKE THAT
YOU WILL NOT MAKE AGAIN.

30
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
- WE'LL GIVE BACK THE GOODS!

31
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,791
- NOW JUST HOLD ON, ZELLNER,

32
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,208
WE WERE ONLY--
- ( men whimper )

33
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,458
- YOU WILL FIND
MY MEN ARE WELL-VERSED

34
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,166
IN THE SCIENCE
OF INFLICTING PAIN.

35
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,583
THE TRICKS THEY LEARNED
IN EAST GERMANY

36
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,000
SHOULD AMUSE YOU
BEFORE YOU DIE.

37
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:16,333
- Man #3: ZELLNER, WAIT!  WAIT!
- Man #2: NO!  NO!

38
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:19,666
- Man #3: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
NO NO NO!

39
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,333
- ( sighs )

40
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,666
HOW IS THE REIMANN SANCTION?

41
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,625
- ROSHMAN REPORTS THAT HIS
TEAM HAS ENTERED SWITZERLAND.

42
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,250
HE SAYS THEY'LL LAUNCH
THE STRIKE TOMORROW.

43
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,791
- MMM.

44
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:44,250
THE WALL IS GONE,
BUT THE PAST REMAINS.

45
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,708
YOU WILL PAY, REIMANN.

46
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,208
YOU WILL PAY.

47
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,083
- HMM?

48
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,000
AH.

49
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:12,666
YOU ARE SOLDATS.

50
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,208
- THAT'S RIGHT. GENERAL
DIETER REIMANN, I PRESUME.

51
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,666
- YOU HAVE COME TO KILL ME,
I SUPPOSE.

52
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,583
- YES.

53
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,000
- ( men grunt )

54
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,166
- Reimann:
IT'S ALL RIGHT, HEINZ.

55
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,500
- HUH?
- HUH?

56
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,666
- I'M SORRY.
IT IS THEIR JOB

57
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,916
TO BE MY BODYGUARDS,
AS YOU KNOW.

58
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,916
IT'S BEEN QUITE A WHILE
SINCE I LEFT THE BUSINESS.

59
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,375
BUT NATO STILL FRETS OVER ME,

60
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,833
OR AT LEAST THE THINGS
I HAVE LOCKED IN MY HEAD.

61
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,458
I USUALLY TAKE
A WALK EVERY AFTERNOON

62
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,125
ABOUT THIS TIME.
WOULD YOU CARE TO JOIN ME?

63
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,458
- Heinz: GENERAL.
- DOWN, HEINZ.

64
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:04,333
SO, YOUNG LADY,
WOULD YOU LIKE TO ACCOMPANY ME?

65
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,125
- SURE.
- YOU WILL.

66
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,708
WUNDERBAR.

67
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,125
- AND WE'LL ACCOMPANY YOU.
- NO.

68
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,583
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.
- BUT, SIR!

69
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:19,625
- LET'S NOT GET BOORISH AGAIN,
SHALL WE, HEINZ?

70
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,166
- SIR!

71
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,000
- Man: WE'RE NOT JUST GONNA
LET HIM GO, ARE WE?

72
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:36,000
- WE HAVE NO CHOICE. WE'LL HAVE
TO GUARD HIM FROM A DISTANCE.

73
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,791
BUT IF I KNOW THE GENERAL,

74
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,458
HE'LL BE TAKING
HIS USUAL ROUTE.

75
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,583
- HMM.

76
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,208
- THOSE ARE ALPINE ROSES,
MY DEAR.

77
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,291
A TRUE EMBODIMENT OF THE ALPS.

78
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,458
THEY ARE QUITE LOVELY, YES?

79
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,541
- THEIR COLOR IS BEAUTIFUL--

80
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,333
PALER THAN CRIMSON,

81
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,416
YET DARKER THAN PINK.

82
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,583
- INDEED.

83
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,708
AND THE ROSES IN THIS MEADOW

84
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,500
ARE OF AN ESPECIALLY
DELICATE SHADE AS WELL.

85
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,458
YOU HAVE AN EXCELLENT EYE.

86
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,958
- MMM.

87
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,500
GO.

88
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:23,083
- THE WOODS AND MEADOWS HERE
ARE FILLED WITH LIGHT.

89
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,916
THAT'S WHY I CAME HERE
WHEN I RETIRED.

90
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,625
THE FORESTS WHERE I GREW UP
IN GERMANY WERE DARK--

91
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,833
DARK AND TERRIBLE.

92
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:39,625
THEY WERE THEN
AND THEY STILL ARE.

93
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:43,000
OVER THE YEARS,
I SOILED MY HANDS MANY TIMES.

94
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,375
SOMETIMES I DID IT
BECAUSE I BELIEVED IT WAS RIGHT.

95
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,166
BUT THERE WERE OTHER TIMES

96
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,125
WHEN I WAS BLINDLY
FOLLOWING THE ORDERS

97
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,916
ISSUED BY THE SOLDATS,

98
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,041
AND I QUESTIONED
NEITHER THE REASONS

99
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,541
NOR THE MORALITY
OF MY ACTIONS.

100
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:08,458
THAT'S RIGHT, NEVER QUESTION
THE WILL OF THE SOLDATS.

101
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,166
THAT WAS MY RULE,
YOU KNOW.

102
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,458
THAT'S WHY I MADE IT
ALL THE WAY TO GENERAL.

103
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,541
DO YOU EVEN KNOW THE REASONS
FOR WHICH THE SOLDATS

104
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:20,958
HAVE ORDERED MY DEATH?

105
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,541
- I DON'T.

106
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:27,000
- BUT EVEN SO,
YOU STILL INTEND TO KILL ME.

107
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,458
- YES.

108
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,958
- YOU SEEM TO HAVE TAKEN
QUITE A LIKING TO THOSE FLOWERS.

109
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,541
- HUH? ( cries out )

110
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:46,666
- ( thunks )
- ( groans )

111
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,250
( panting )

112
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,875
- STAY HERE, PLEASE.

113
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,500
- HUH?  BUT WHAT--

114
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,666
- ( gunfire )
- ( gasps )

115
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,916
- ( knife zings )
- ( man screams )

116
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,375
- ( gasps )

117
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,541
- ( knife zings )
- ( screams )

118
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,291
- ( gunfire )

119
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,916
- ( grunts, screams )

120
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,583
- ( Roshman exhales sharply )

121
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,625
WHERE THE HELL IS HE?

122
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,291
( gasps )

123
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,833
- ( knife zings )
- ( screams )

124
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,250
- ( sighs )

125
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,833
( sniffs )

126
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,916
- ( rock music plays )

127
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,458
- ( both gasp )

128
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:44,083
- WHAT-- WHAT IN THE HELL
HAS BEEN HAPPENING HERE?

129
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:47,458
- HEY, THIS IS--
- Bodyguard: GENERAL!

130
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,458
- GENERAL, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT!

131
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,875
- YES, I'M QUITE FINE...

132
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,875
THANKS TO THIS YOUNG LADY.

133
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:58,875
- HUH?
- AH.

134
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,708
- Reimann: THAT ONE WAS
THE LEADER OF THE ATTACKERS.

135
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,291
- THAT'S ROSHMAN.
HE USED TO BE AN ASSASSIN

136
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:13,458
FOR THE S.G.T.
- I THOUGHT SO.

137
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,958
- THANK YOU, MISS.

138
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,000
I SEEM TO OWE YOU MY LIFE.

139
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:22,000
- THE FACT THAT I'VE BEEN TASKED
WITH KILLING YOU HASN'T CHANGED.

140
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,000
- HMM.

141
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,333
- THESE FOOLS WOULD'VE
HINDERED ME IN THAT TASK.

142
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,958
IT WAS SIMPLY EASIER
TO KILL THEM.

143
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,083
- ( wind howling )

144
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,916
- THE WIND SEEMS
TO BE PICKING UP A BIT.

145
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,958
I THINK
A STORM IS ON THE WAY.

146
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,000
( sits )

147
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,250
I HAD THOSE ASSASSINS CHECKED.

148
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,541
EX-S.G.T.,

149
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:15,958
THE OLD EAST GERMAN
NATIONAL SECURITY BUREAU.

150
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,708
AFTER THE WALL
CAME DOWN IN BERLIN,

151
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,333
THEIR LEADER,
CONRAD ZELLNER,

152
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,416
USED THE KNOWLEDGE
HE'D ACCUMULATED

153
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,791
DURING THE COLD WAR TO BUILD
HIS OWN CRIMINAL NETWORK.

154
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,958
HE'S CURRENTLY AMASSING
A HUGE PERSONAL FORTUNE

155
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,000
IN ILLEGAL NARCOTICS.

156
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:35,166
WHILE I WAS POSTED
WITH NATO INTELLIGENCE,

157
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,750
WE WERE CONSTANTLY AT ODDS.

158
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,708
IT WAS A DIRTY,
NO-HOLDS-BARRED STRUGGLE.

159
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:45,375
WE EVEN ATTACKED AND KILLED
EACH OTHER'S FAMILIES.

160
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,958
WHAT FOOLS WE WERE.

161
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,333
I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW FOOLISH

162
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,916
UNTIL I LOST MY OWN DAUGHTER.
- MMM.

163
00:14:57,166 --> 00:15:00,666
- YES, ZELLNER KILLED
MY DAUGHTER...

164
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,291
BRUTALLY.

165
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,333
HORRIBLY.
WITHOUT MERCY.

166
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
- REVENGE MUST BE
CARRIED OUT PROPERLY.

167
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:16,166
- THAT IDEA IS ITSELF MISTAKEN,

168
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,875
FOR ONCE BEGUN, REVENGE
BECOMES AN EVER-GROWING WEB

169
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,500
THAT ENSNARES
EVEN THOSE WHO SPIN IT.

170
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,750
I'M SORRY.

171
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,125
ALL OF THIS TALK WAS
NO DOUBT POINTLESS

172
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,833
FOR AN EMISSARY
OF THE SOLDATS.

173
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,375
- ( rain pattering )

174
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:45,291
- SO THEN...
HOW IS THE WINE?

175
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,333
- DELICIOUS.
HOWEVER,

176
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,833
THE WINE AT THE MANOR
IS EVEN BETTER.

177
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,291
- THE MANOR?

178
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,250
- YES, THAT IS WHERE I LIVE

179
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,375
WITH MISTRESS ALTENA.

180
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,250
- ALTENA.

181
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,083
I'VE NEVER MET THE LADY,

182
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,541
BUT HER NAME IS
CERTAINLY FAMILIAR TO ME.

183
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,541
( gasps )
CAN IT BE...

184
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,916
THAT YOU ARE
THE ONE CALLED NOIR?

185
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,750
- YES.

186
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,458
- I KNEW THAT
THERE WERE ASSASSINS

187
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,208
IN THE PAST WHO HAD
CALLED THEMSELVES NOIR,

188
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:24,500
AND YET I NEVER THOUGHT
I MIGHT LIVE

189
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,333
TO SEE NOIR MYSELF.

190
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:50,333
- HEINZ AND THE OTHERS
KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE SOLDATS.

191
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:53,583
IF POSSIBLE,
I WOULD LIKE THEM SPARED.

192
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,083
- VERY WELL.

193
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:00,083
- I AM GRATEFUL.

194
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,375
- ( wind blowing )

195
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,750
- ( glass shatters )

196
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,833
- ( women singing )

197
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,125
- MMM.

198
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,041
- ( breathing shakily )

199
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:33,125
- I JUST MADE A PERSONAL
PROMISE TO THE GENERAL.

200
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,791
- ( zings )

201
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:40,166
- IF POSSIBLE, I WOULD
VERY MUCH LIKE TO KEEP IT.

202
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,000
- ( women singing )

203
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,666
- ( gun clicks )
- ( sighs )

204
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,666
- AT LAST,
GENERAL REIMANN IS DEAD.

205
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,958
- YES SIR.

206
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:21,291
- NATO'S OLD FOX IS
COMMITTED TO THE DARKNESS.

207
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,916
THIS IS THE MOST JOYOUS NEWS
SINCE THE REUNIFICATION.

208
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,916
- ( hesitantly )
UH, YES, EXCEPT--

209
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,791
- WHAT IS IT?
JUST TELL ME, VINT!

210
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,333
- IT SEEMS THAT
SOMEONE ELSE KILLED REIMANN,

211
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,833
ALONG WITH OUR ENTIRE
ASSAULT TEAM.

212
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:39,083
- WHAT?!
AND WHAT HAPPENED TO ROSHMAN?

213
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,458
- IT SEEMS HE'S DEAD AS WELL.

214
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,375
OUR SOURCES DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED OR EVEN WHEN.

215
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,083
- ( sighs )

216
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,208
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

217
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,333
YOU WILL TAKE COMMAND
OF IT, PERSONALLY.

218
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,833
IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?
- SIR!

219
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:58,333
- A NEW SHIPMENT OF PRODUCT
WILL BE ARRIVING NEXT WEEK.

220
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,541
MAKE SURE
THAT NOTHING GOES WRONG.

221
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,708
- RIGHT.

222
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,541
( gasps )

223
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,583
( footsteps approach )

224
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,833
WHO IN THE HELL COULD'VE--
- ( clatters )

225
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,208
- ( gasps )
- HUH?

226
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,875
NO NO.
IT'S NOTHING.

227
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,500
THAT'S RIGHT.

228
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,541
WE'LL MAKE ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS
FOR THE SHIP ON OUR END.

229
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,666
VERY GOOD.
I APPRECIATE YOUR COOPERATION.

230
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,125
 - ( phone clatters )

231
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,416
- WHO ARE YOU?!

232
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,875
HOW DID YOU GET PAST
MY GUARDS?!

233
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:42,708
- ( clicks )
- HEY,

234
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,625
IS THERE ANYONE OUT THERE?!

235
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,375
HEY, WHERE ARE YOU?!

236
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,458
SOMEONE PICK UP
THE PHONE, DAMN IT!

237
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:49,833
- ( clicking )
- Zellner: VINT!

238
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,791
( breathing heavily )

239
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,791
WHO-- WHO ARE YOU?

240
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,416
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT?
( whimpers )

241
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,541
- ( knife whooshes, slices )
- ( grunts )

242
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,875
( gags )

243
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:08,958
- ( clatters )

244
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,083
- ( footsteps depart )

245
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,583
- ( Chloe shouts ) ALTENA!

246
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,416
- CHLOE.

247
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,375
- ( both laughing )

248
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:06,833
- ( sighs )
- MMM.

249
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,625
WELCOME HOME, PRECIOUS.

250
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:17,000
- ( sighs )
I AM HOME.

251
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:21,166
- NOW LET ME SEE YOUR FACE,
MY CHLOE.

252
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,125
LET ME SEE THAT YOU ARE WELL.

253
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,125
- MA'AM.

254
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:32,125
I HAVE SO MUCH
TO TELL YOU THIS TIME.

255
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,916
I MET HER LIKE YOU SAID.

256
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,541
AND LOOK,
I RECEIVED THIS FROM HER.

257
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,583
- MY.
YOU MUST BE SO TIRED.

258
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,333
COME ALONG.
LET US GO INSIDE

259
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:53,125
AND YOU CAN TELL ME
ALL ABOUT IT.

260
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:03,166
- ( women singing )
