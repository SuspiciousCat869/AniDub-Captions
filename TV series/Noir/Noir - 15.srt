1
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:41,416
- ( men chanting )

2
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,166
- Kirika: NOIR--

3
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,875
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE--

4
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:50,083
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH.

5
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,291
THE PEACE OF
THE NEWLY BORN,

6
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,833
THEIR BLACK HANDS PROTECT.

7
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,583
- ( people chattering )

8
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:12,041
- MINISTER SONG,
IT'S TIME.

9
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,166
- HMM.

10
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:19,708
- NOW ABOUT THE MEETING
WE HAVE SCHEDULED FOR TONIGHT--

11
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,708
- ( grunts )
- EXCUSE ME.

12
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,083
- NO, IT WAS MY FAULT TOO.

13
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,166
HUH?

14
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,625
- I AM SO SORRY.

15
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,625
- IT'S NOTHING.

16
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,250
- THANKS.

17
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,958
- HUH?

18
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,583
- SIR, WE SHOULD GO.

19
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,541
- HMM.

20
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,250
( gasps )

21
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,333
- UM, SIR?

22
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,250
- ( gags )
- SIR!

23
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:58,958
IS SOMETHING WRONG? SIR?!
- ( gagging )

24
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,500
- ( body thuds )

25
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,000
- ( screaming )

26
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,416
- ( people shouting )
- Man: GET AN AMBULANCE!

27
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,666
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?!

28
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,000
- Woman: DOES
ANYONE KNOW C.P.R.?!

29
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,250
- ( frantic chatter continues )

30
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,333
- ( people chattering )

31
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,375
( chatter continues )

32
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,750
- WE CAN'T GO BACK
TO THAT LAKE.

33
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,583
I'M SO SORRY.

34
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,916
- ( sighs )
IT WOULD SEEM THAT YOU'RE

35
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,500
LAURENT BOUQUET'S
DAUGHTER TO THE END.

36
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,750
- ( gunshot )

37
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,458
- ( pottery shatters )

38
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,166
- ( slightly gasps )

39
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,875
- ( gun cocks )

40
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,708
- WHAT IS THAT?

41
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,708
I SAID, WHAT IS THAT?

42
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,750
- IT'S A JOB OFFER.

43
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:09,083
IT'S AN OFFER FOR
A JOB IN TAIWAN. 

44
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,750
- IN TAIWAN?
THAT MAKES NO SENSE.

45
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,625
- BUT LOOK AT THE CLIENT.

46
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:20,833
- ( gasps )

47
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,333
- YES, THE <i>SOLDATS.</i>

48
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,125
- ( gasping )

49
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,250
THE HON YIBAN.

50
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,958
THE MOST POWERFUL
OF THE TRIAD ORGANIZATIONS

51
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:08,250
THAT RULE
THE TAIWANESE UNDERWORLD.

52
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,125
OUR ASSIGNMENT,
IF WE DECIDE TO ACCEPT IT,

53
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:13,250
IS TO KILL THEIR ELDER,
ONE WU XIWU.

54
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,500
THAT'S THE JOB
THE <i>SOLDATS</i> WANT US TO DO.

55
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,583
- VERY GOOD.

56
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:41,791
- SO WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE

57
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,833
THE <i>SOLDATS</i> ARE
REALLY UP TO HERE?

58
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,458
- I DON'T KNOW.

59
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,458
BUT WHAT I DO KNOW

60
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,625
IS THAT THEY'RE
GETTING MUCH CLOSER--

61
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,416
CLOSER TO US.

62
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,291
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

63
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,916
WHY ELSE WOULD THEY HAVE
LEFT THAT LETTER

64
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,458
THE WAY THEY DID, SIGNED
BY THE <i>SOLDATS</i> THEMSELVES?

65
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,791
- IT'S ALMOST LIKE
A SERIES OF MASKS 

66
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,458
SLOWLY BEING REMOVED
ONE BY ONE.

67
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,458
- WELL, I'M NOT
GOING TO LET THEM

68
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,583
PULL US AROUND
BY THE STRINGS ANY LONGER.

69
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:13,125
I'LL TEAR THOSE
DAMN MASKS OFF MYSELF.

70
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:16,375
THAT'S THE REAL REASON
WE CAME TO TAIWAN.

71
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,125
- BUT THE RISK
IS MUCH HIGHER NOW.

72
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,166
- ( huffs )

73
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,416
- THIS IS A TRAP.

74
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,166
COMING TO THIS
PLACE WAS WRONG.

75
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,458
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

76
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,875
ISN'T THIS EXACTLY
WHAT WE WERE WAITING FOR?

77
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,750
WE WANTED THEM
TO MAKE CONTACT WITH US.

78
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,666
AND EVEN IF IT IS
BAIT AND A TRAP,

79
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,041
SO WHAT?!

80
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,000
WE'LL TAKE IT ANYWAY.

81
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,875
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT
WE PARTNERED UP FOR. 

82
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:57,375
BUT I'M DOING THIS
NO MATTER WHAT,

83
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:01,250
WITH A PARTNER OR BY MYSELF.

84
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,708
- ( door opens, door closes )

85
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,041
- Altena: MY DARLING CHLOE,

86
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,583
I READ THE NOTE 
YOU LEFT BEHIND.

87
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,125
WHAT AM I
TO DO WITH YOU?

88
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,791
AS YOU'VE SURMISED,

89
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,958
I'VE LED HER
AND HER FRIEND TO TAIWAN.

90
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,916
I GAVE THEM A TASK.

91
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,416
HOWEVER,
THE SITUATION IN TAIWAN

92
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,708
HAS CHANGED UNEXPECTEDLY

93
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,250
AND VERY DRASTICALLY.

94
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,041
I NOW FEAR THAT
THEY MAY FALL PREY

95
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,583
TO THE POISONOUS INSECT.

96
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:14,166
OH, CHLOE, SUCH A KIND CHILD.

97
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,833
I AM PAINFULLY AWARE
OF HOW WORRIED SICK YOU ARE.

98
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:23,958
VERY WELL.  GO AS YOU WILL.

99
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:28,125
YOU KNOW THAT I SHALL
ALWAYS BE WATCHING OVER YOU.

100
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,625
- ( chuckles )

101
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:51,541
- GENTLEMEN,
A SITUATION IS DEVELOPING

102
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,375
THAT MAY PROVE UNFAVORABLE

103
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,625
TO OUR ORGANIZATION,
THE HON YIBAN.

104
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,041
AS YOU KNOW,
WE ORDERED SHAOLI

105
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,416
TO ELIMINATE MISTER SONG
OF THE CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY.

106
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,625
THIS SANCTION WAS NECESSARY

107
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,333
AS HE WAS ACTING ON BEHALF
OF THE <i>SOLDATS.</i>

108
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,166
HOWEVER, THE <i>SOLDATS</i>
HAVE NOW LEARNED

109
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,666
THAT WE WERE BEHIND
THE ASSASSINATION. 

110
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,041
THEY WILL SEEK
TO DESTROY US.

111
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,666
EVEN BEFORE
WE MOVED TO TAIWAN,

112
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,083
TOGETHER WITH
CHIANG KAI-SHECK'S NATIONALISTS,

113
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:30,833
THE <i>SOLDATS</i> AND THE TRIADS
HAVE ALWAYS SHARED INTERESTS.

114
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:35,750
BUT NOW THAT THE <i>SOLDATS</i>
ARE TRYING TO ELIMINATE US...

115
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,583
WE ARE LEFT WITH NO CHOICE
EXCEPT TO FIGHT.

116
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,333
WE WILL FIGHT
NOT FOR POLITICS,

117
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,583
BUT FOR THE FUTURE
OF THE TRIADS.

118
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,625
- Man #1: NOIR HAS
ENTERED TAIWAN.

119
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,916
- HUH?

120
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,708
- THE <i>SOLDATS</i> ARE
NOT WORKING AS ONE.

121
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:54,375
OUR INSIDE SOURCE TELLS US
THEY ARE NOT UNIFIED.

122
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:57,208
- WE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE
IF THAT IS SO.

123
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,750
IS YOUR SOURCE GOOD?

124
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,041
- WHO IS THAT?

125
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,041
- AN AGENT OF THE <i>SOLDATS.</i>

126
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:07,375
- HMM.
- Man #1: KEEP AN EYE ON HIM

127
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,500
AND HE WILL LEAD US
TO NOIR.

128
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,291
- SO, SHAOLI...

129
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,291
CAN YOU KILL THE ONES
CALLED NOIR?

130
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,875
THINK WELL.

131
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,041
- OF COURSE.

132
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,125
NOIR MAY BE THE THOUSAND-
YEAR-OLD DARKNESS OF EUROPE,

133
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:28,291
BUT THE TRIAD'S ROOTS
GO BACK OVER TWICE THAT.

134
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:32,000
THEY ARE NO THREAT TO
THE LI FAMILY'S ART OF POISON.

135
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,791
- I'LL HOLD YOU
TO THOSE WORDS, SHAOLI.

136
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,791
- ( chuckles )

137
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,208
- EXCUSE ME, MISS.

138
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,916
THERE'S A NOTE
IN YOUR MESSAGE BOX.

139
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,708
- RIGHT, THANK YOU.

140
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,875
- IT APPEARS THAT YOU DID
RECEIVE THE MESSAGE I LEFT.

141
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,666
- SO IT WOULD SEEM.

142
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,250
- I HAVE NEW AND URGENT
INFORMATION FOR YOU.

143
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,208
- WE'RE LISTENING.

144
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,291
- WE'VE LEARNED
THE HON YIBAN

145
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,375
HAVE HIRED ONE OF
THE "COLD-EYED" CLAN.

146
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:05,333
- "COLD-EYED," MEANING
A HIT MAN I SUPPOSE.

147
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,708
- THAT'S RIGHT,
A WOMAN NAMED SHAOLI.

148
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,375
HER REPUTATION IS SUCH

149
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,333
THAT THE TRIADS CALL HER
"THE COLD-BLOODED KILLER."

150
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,708
- "THE COLD-BLOODED KILLER"?

151
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:18,083
- I'VE HEARD OF HER BEFORE.
SHE'S ONE OF THE BEST.

152
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,458
- AND IT SEEMS THAT
THE HON YIBAN

153
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,083
INTEND TO USE SHAOLI
TO CRUSH NOIR.

154
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,541
- ( gasps )

155
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,833
- <i>SOLDAT</i> AND TRIAD
INTEREST IN CHINA 

156
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,916
HAVE LONG BEEN
IN CONTENTION.

157
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,750
IT APPEARS THAT THE TRIADS
HAVE FINALLY CROSSED THE LINE.

158
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,291
OUR INFORMATION SUGGESTS

159
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:51,666
THAT THE TRIADS
ARE PREPARING

160
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,291
FOR AN ALL-OUT-ATTEMPT
TO RESIST THE <i>SOLDATS.</i>

161
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,416
HOWEVER,
WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED

162
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,250
THAT SOMEONE INSIDE
OUR ORGANIZATION

163
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,125
IS LEAKING INFORMATION
TO THEM.

I WANT SOME ANSWERS FIRST.

TO COOPERATE WITH YOU,

THAT'S ALL YOU GET.

IS HUNTING DOWN THE RATS.

AND SHAOLI IS THE SMOKE

189
