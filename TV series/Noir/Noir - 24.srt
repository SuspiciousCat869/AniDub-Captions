1
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,791
- ( voices chanting )

2
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:43,666
- Kirika: NOIR...

3
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,666
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE--

4
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,291
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH.

5
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,875
THE PEACE
OF THE NEWLY BORN

6
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:55,166
THEIR BLACK HANDS PROTECT.

7
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,083
- HMM?

8
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,291
( gasping )

9
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,500
- WELCOME HOME, LITTLE ONE.

10
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,500
- I AM HOME.

11
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,500
- ( snorts )

12
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,875
- Altena: AT LONG LAST,

13
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,750
HAVING COMPLETED
YOUR PILGRIMAGE,

14
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,750
YOU HAVE RETURNED.

15
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,333
- SO YOU ARE ALTENA.

16
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,708
- YES.

17
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,958
- Kirika: WAS I BORN
IN THIS PLACE?

18
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,750
- NO, NOT HERE.

19
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,000
HOWEVER IT IS TRUE
THAT YOU SPENT

20
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,750
A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR
LIFE WITHIN THESE WALLS.

21
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,083
AS A SEEDLING, YOU SHOWED SIGNS
OF THE GREATEST PROMISE.

22
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,875
IT WAS HERE THAT YOU WERE GIVEN
YOUR FIRST TASKS AS A SAPLING.

23
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,583
- ( exhales )

24
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:59,291
- THERE WERE THREE
SAPLINGS CHOSEN

25
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,250
AS CANDIDATES FOR NOIR.

26
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,708
OF THOSE THREE,
THE DAUGHTER OF CORSICA

27
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,083
WOULD BE CAST TO THE WIND.
OUR INTENT,

28
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,791
YOU SEE, WAS TO RAISE
EACH SAPLING

29
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,791
IN A DIFFERENT SOIL.

30
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,000
EACH WOULD BE NURTURED

31
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,208
WITH DIFFERENT AMOUNTS
OF WATER AND LIGHT,

32
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,583
DIFFERENT WINDS
AND DARKNESS.

33
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:20,125
IN THIS WAY ONLY THE SAPLINGS
THAT GREW THE MOST TRUE,

34
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:24,083
THE VERY STRONGEST,
WOULD BECOME NOIR.

35
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,958
- ( bagpipes playing )

36
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,291
- ( footsteps )

37
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,291
- ( door creaks open )

38
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,875
- THE SMELL OF BLOOD.

39
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,833
- Chloe: THAT'S RIGHT.
- HUH.

40
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:12,000
- OVER THE YEARS MANY LIVES
HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN THIS ROOM.

41
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,666
- IT GOES BEYOND
THIS ONE ROOM.

42
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,708
THIS WHOLE PLACE SEEMS IMBUED
WITH THE AURA OF DEATH.

43
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,833
- YES.

44
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,666
YOU LIVED HERE ONCE,
YOU KNOW?

45
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,875
- OF COURSE.

46
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:32,875
IT'S MY HOME, ISN'T IT?

47
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
- YES.

48
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,875
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COME SEE MY ROOM?

49
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:54,166
THE TWO OF US USED
TO LIVE HERE TOGETHER.

50
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,958
IT WAS JUST
FOR A BRIEF TIME THOUGH.

51
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,958
WE WERE ALL SUPPOSED
TO RECEIVE INSTRUCTION

52
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,500
IN SEPARATE PLACES.

53
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,416
AND YOU WERE OUT PERFORMING
ASSIGNMENTS FOR ALTENA

54
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,291
EVEN BEFORE THAT.

55
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,291
LIKE YOUR FIRST TRIP
TO CORSICA!

56
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:17,708
HMM.

57
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,208
- ( casings bouncing )

58
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,083
- ( music-box melody playing )

59
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,416
- ( giggles )

60
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:48,000
- YOU WERE TRULY A MAIDEN
WITH BLACK HANDS THAT DAY.

61
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,541
THE IMAGE OF NOIR.

62
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,875
AFTER SEEING YOU THAT DAY,
I MADE MY DECISION--

63
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,708
THAT I WOULD BE LIKE YOU

64
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,291
AND THAT I WANTED
TO BE WITH YOU,

65
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,791
A NOIR BY YOUR SIDE.

66
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,666
- YOU BECAME AN ASSASSIN

67
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,375
BECAUSE YOU SAW ME?

68
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:08,791
- YES.

69
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,500
- ( melody continuing )

70
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,208
( melody continuing )

71
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,041
( melody ends )

72
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,541
- ( sighs )

73
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,416

- Kirika: THE TWIN HANDS
OF THE SOLDATS

82
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,791
ARE TWO MAIDENS.
- ( gasps )

83
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,000
- BLACKER THAN BLACK

84
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,500
BURDENED BY SIN,

85
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,583
REACHING OUT WITH MERCY,

86
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,958
THEY ARE NOIR.

87
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,708
- IF IT IS TRUE THAT
LOVE CAN KILL,

88
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:18,708
THEN MIGHT NOT HATRED
SAVE SOMEONE AS WELL?

89
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,958
THAT IS WHAT I BELIEVE.

90
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,291
- YES.

91
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,250

92
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,875
YOU HAVE DONE WELL

00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,250

SO PLEASE SLEEP WELL

99
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,708
TOMORROW WILL BE
A BUSY DAY FOR YOU.

100
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,791
WE MUST ALL PREPARE
FOR THE RITUAL.

101
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,791
GOOD NIGHT, KIRIKA.

102
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,291
- ( gasps )
MISTRESS ALTENA.

103
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,125
I...

104
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,541
- ( chuckles )
YES, MY CHILD?

105
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,083
- GOOD NIGHT, MISTRESS.

106
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,458
- PLEASANT DREAMS.

107

00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,000
- ( wind blowing )

110
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,375
- BORNE, MARENNES,
AT LAST YOU ARE HERE.

111
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,041
- ( Scottish accent )
DEAREST ALTENA!

112
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,333
- WE'RE GLAD
TO SEE YOU SO WELL.

113
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:19,833
- AYE. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
THAT IT'S TIME AT LAST.

114
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,541
- CONGRATULATIONS, ALTENA.

115
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,500
THIS COULD NEVER HAVE
COME TO FRUITION

116
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,500
WITHOUT YOUR CEASELESS WORK.

117
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:28,083
- NO, I MERELY ACCOMPLISHED

118
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,500
A TASK THAT WAS
ASSIGNED TO ME.

119
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,500
THE REVIVAL OF NOIR

120
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,500
WAS THE WILL
OF THE SOLDATS OF OLD.

121
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,583
I SIMPLY ACTED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THEIR WISHES.

122
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,875
- BUT STILL,
WITHOUT YOUR EFFORTS,

123
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,541
THIS <i>GRAND RETOUR</i> WOULD NOT
HAVE COME TO PASS.

124
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,541
- YOU HAVE STOOD FIRM AND WON

125
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,333
AGAINST SOME OF THE
MOST POWERFUL FACETS

126
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,708
WITHIN THE SOLDATS.

127
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,666
YOUR COURAGE DESERVES PRAISE
WITHOUT RESERVATION.

128
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,500
- MARENNES' RIGHT.
YOU'RE OUR TRUE LEADER!

129
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,791
NOT THOSE SCOUNDRELS WHO NEST
AT THE HEART OF THE SOLDATS

130
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,583
AND SEEK TO STOP
THE <i>GRAND RETOUR.</i>

131
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,375
- Marennes: WE MUST
COMPLETE THE CEREMONY

132
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,125
NO MATTER WHAT THE COST.

133
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,583
- Altena: WHO WILL
STAND WITNESS THEN?

134
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:10,041
- I, BORNE, AM SWORN
TO THE SOLDATS.

135
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,958
- AS AM I, MARENNES.

136
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,875
LEAVE THE PREPARATION
FOR THE RITUAL TO US, MISTRESS.

137
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:37,000
- ( gasps )
SUCH BEAUTY.

138
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,625
- Borne: THESE TWO SAPLINGS
YOU HAVE RAISED,

139
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,333
THEY ARE TRULY FIT
TO BE CALLED NOIR.

140
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:21,375
A MOST EXCELLENT HARVEST.

141
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,416
- Marennes: I REMEMBER
THINKING THAT

142
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,291
THE TRIALS WERE CRUEL AT FIRST.

143
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:28,125
BUT I KNEW A SAPLING
MUST BE CUT TO REACH ITS GROWTH,

144
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,333
EVEN LEST IT FAILS
AND DIES.

145
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,333
- ( blades scraping )

146
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,291
- ( grunts )

147
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,000
( yelps )

148
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:57,000
- Borne: ALL THREE SAPLINGS
WERE EQUALLY GIFTED.

149
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,500
- Marennes: BUT LIKE A
BLADE THAT MUST BE

150
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,125
HONED TO KEEP ITS EDGE,

151
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,666
THE DAUGHTER OF
CORSICA BECAME DULLED

152
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,833
WHEN LEFT IN THE WILDERNESS.

153
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,250
- I KNOW YOU DEMANDED
FULL DISCRETION

154
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,833
IN THE CARE
AND NURTURE OF NOIR.

155
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:14,458
HOW WISE YOU WERE,
FOR IT WAS NOIR ITSELF

156
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:18,041
THAT WOULD KEEP YOUR INFLUENCE
WITHIN THE SOLDATS INTACT.

157
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,166
- AS LONG AS WE FULFILL
THE RITUAL WITHOUT MISHAP,

158
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,958
YOUR AUTHORITY WILL BECOME
ABSOLUTE AND TOTAL.

159
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:29,000
- AND WE MUST MAINTAIN
THAT POWER, ALTENA.

160
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:32,708
FOR WITHOUT IT, WE CAN
NEVER REALIZE OUR TRUE GOAL.

161
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,708
- I UNDERSTAND

162
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,250
AND I WILL ACCOMPLISH
OUR IDEAL--

163
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:40,708
THE RETURN TO THE SOLDATS
OF OLD-- WITHOUT FAIL.

164
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,666
NO MATTER WHAT
THE COST TO MYSELF.

165
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,750

172
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,666
IT'S JUST LIKE A DREAM.

173
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,791
- HUH?

174
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:53,291
- SOON WE WILL HAVE UNDERGONE
THE RITUAL AND BECOME NOIR.

175
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:57,208
WE'VE WISHED AND WAITED
FOR THIS MOMENT FOR SO LONG.

176
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,583
UH, ALTENA AND I, I MEAN.

177
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,375
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO SHOW YOU.

178

- IS THAT...

179
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:11,291
- IT'S THE FORK THAT
YOU GAVE ME THAT NIGHT.

180
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,708
IT IS MY MOST PRECIOUS
TREASURE.

181
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,625
OUR MOONLIT PARTY,

182
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,166
IT WAS SO MUCH FUN.

183
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,125
ONCE THE RITUAL IS COMPLETED,

184
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,416
WE CAN INVITE
YOUR FRIEND HERE TOO.

185
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,000
THEN THE THREE OF US CAN
HAVE TEA TOGETHER AGAIN.

- Altena: GO AHEAD AND SHOOT.
- HUH?

206
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,416
- IF THAT WERE THE TASK
ASSIGNED TO YOU,

207
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,041
A NOIR MUST
BE ABLE TO SHOOT,

208
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,250
EVEN IF THAT TARGET
IS MYSELF.

- ( ragged breathing )

210
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,166
- JUST WHAT
WORRIES YOU, CHILD?

211
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,000
YOU MUST NEVER FALTER.

212
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:42,250
THE WORLD OF MAN IS ALWAYS
BOUND IN DARKNESS.

213
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,333
AND IN YEARS TO COME,
YOU WILL SEE

214
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,750
MANY BLACK DEEDS
WITH YOUR OWN EYES,

215
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,416
BUT YOU MUST NEVER
LOOK AWAY.

216
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,416
NOT FROM THAT DARKNESS
AND NOT FROM THE WORLD

217
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,291
FULL OF SUFFERING.

218
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,458
WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION

219
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,416
THAT WE MUST BEAR,
BOTH YOU AND I.

220
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,666
IT IS OUR SHARED DESTINY

221
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:07,458
TO BEAR THE MOST UNFORGIVABLE
OF SINS TOGETHER.

222
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,791
- ( ragged breathing )

223
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:16,041
- BUT YOU ALREADY KNOW THIS,
DON'T YOU, CHILD?

224
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,333
THE ANSWER THAT YOU HAVE BEEN
SEARCHING FOR

225
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,000
IS WITHIN THESE WALLS.

226
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,750
YOU HAVE RETURNED
TO YOUR HOME.

227
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:28,750
THIS IS WHERE YOU BELONG.
IT'S TIME TO ACCEPT YOUR WORLD.

228
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,333
THOSE GATHERED HERE
ARE ALL FAMILY

229
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,458
AND TOGETHER
WE SERVE THAT CAUSE.

230
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,541
- YOU'RE SAYING
I'M A SINNER,

231
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,916
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT WE MUST DO--

232
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,583
THIS FAMILY?

233
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,333
- YES.

234
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,583
THE SIN WITHIN THE SIN,

235
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:58,708
THAT IS WHY WE LIVE TOGETHER
IN DARKNESS.

236
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,333
FOR THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE

237
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:04,875
WHERE YOU WILL EVER KNOW PEACE.
- ( soft sobs )

238

- ( sighs )

240
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,208
- THE MAN WITHIN THE MAN,

241
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,541
THE LOVE
WITHIN THE LOVE,

242
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,708
THE SIN WITHIN THE SIN.

243
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:30,166
- POOR LITTLE ONE.
DO NOT WORRY, CHILD.

244
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,541
ONCE YOU COME
TO ACCEPT THIS LIFE,

245
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,083
ALL WILL BE RIGHT
ONCE MORE.

246
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,708
