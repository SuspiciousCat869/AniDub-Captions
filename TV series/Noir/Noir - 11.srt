1
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:41,583
- ( men chanting )

2
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,333
- Kirika: NOIR--

3
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:47,041
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE--

4
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:50,250
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH.

5
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,458
THE PEACE OF
THE NEWLY BORN,

6
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:55,000
THEIR BLACK HANDS PROTECT.

7
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:00,916
- ALL RIGHT,
WHO ARE YOU?

8
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,083
- CHLOE.

9
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,125
- RIGHT, AND YOU ARE?

10
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,375
- THE TRUE NOIR.

11
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,500
- ( gasps )

12
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,291
- IF YOU'D REALLY LIKE,

13
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,041
WE CAN SEE WHO'S FASTER.

14
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,000
- ( sighs )

15
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:41,708
- I AM THE TRUE NOIR,
YOU KNOW?

16
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,708
- ( phone rings )

17
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,208
- <i>BONJOUR.</i>

18
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,541
- Man: IS THIS NOIR?
- ( gasps )

19
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,875
YOU MUST HAVE
THE WRONG NUMBER.

20
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,250
- I SENT YOU SOMETHING
IN THE POST.

21
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,541
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD
LOOK AT IT.

22
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,625
- ( clicks )
- ( phone beeps )

23
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:15,791
- THE SAME PHOTOCOPY.

24
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,625
- IS IT?

25
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,750
LOOK AGAIN.

26
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:25,541
- IT'S BEEN
COPIED FROM A BOOK.

27
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,375
AND THAT'S THE EDGE
OF THE NEXT PAGE.

28
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:29,791
( gasps )

29
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:33,750
BUT MOST OF THE DIRT AND STAINS
ARE IN THE SAME SPOT,

30
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,750
WHICH MEANS THAT IT'S LIKELY
THAT BOTH COPIES

31
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:37,958
CAME FROM THE SAME BOOK,

32
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,250
BUT ALSO THAT 
THE TWO COPIES

33
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,958
WERE MADE
AT DIFFERENT TIMES.

34
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,583
- PROBABLY.

35
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,458
AND BY DIFFERENT SOURCES.

36
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,708
- ( phone rings )
- ( gasps )

37
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,333
- ( ringing continues )

38
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,458
- ( phone beeps )
- Mireille: YES? 

39
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,291
- Man: HAVE YOU BOTH
SEEN THE PHOTOCOPY? 

40
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,125
- Mireille: WHO ARE YOU?

41
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,666
- Man: I WANT
TO MEET WITH YOU.

42
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,791
FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON

43
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,875
IN THE GARDENS BEHIND
THE LAMBERT MEMORIAL HALL.

44
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,000
- OUR CALLER ALREADY KNEW

45
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,833
MY ADDRESS AND
TELEPHONE NUMBER.

46
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,708
WHAT'S MORE,

47
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,250
HE SAID THAT HE WANTED
TO MEET BOTH OF US.

48
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,125
- <i>SOLDATS.</i>

49
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:25,125
- AND IT LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE READY TO CONTACT US.

50
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,583
- FIRST, THERE'S THIS
"TRUE NOIR" CHLOE

51
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,375
AND NOW THIS.

52
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,083
IT ALL HAS TO BE...

53
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,166
- RELATED SOMEHOW, I KNOW.

54
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,666
BUT EXACTLY HOW,
I HAVE NO IDEA. 

55
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,166
- ( gasps )

56
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,250
MIREILLE.

57
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,125
- HOW GOOD OF YOU TO COME.

58
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,791
- YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO CALLED?

59
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,750
WHEN MEETING A DATE,

60
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,291
PROPER ETIQUETTE DICTATES

61
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,208
THAT INTRODUCTIONS
ARE IN ORDER.

62
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,875
- JUST KNOWING MY NAME
WOULD BE MEANINGLESS. 

63
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,791
I BELIEVE IT WILL
BE ENOUGH TO SAY 

64
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,708
THAT I AM LOYAL
TO THE <i>SOLDATS.</i>

65
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:14,750
- ( gasps )

66
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,833
- I AM MOST PLEASED
TO MEET YOU AT LAST.

67
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,791
- IS THAT SO?

68
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,041
AND HERE
I COULD HAVE SWORN

69
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,375
THAT YOU WERE
TRYING TO KILL US.

70
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,125
- AND SO WE ARE.

71
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:34,041
THE ORDERS TO SANCTION
BOTH OF YOU STILL STAND.

72
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,416
YOU MUST TAKE CARE.

73
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,583
- SO ARE YOU HOLDING OUT
A DAGGER OR AN OLIVE BRANCH?

74
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,958
- THERE ARE NO FRIENDS
OR FOES IN OUR WORLD. 

75
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,958
YOU TWO SHOULD KNOW
THAT ALL TOO WELL, CORRECT?

76
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,875
I AM ONLY ACTING ON THE WILL
OF THE <i>SOLDATS.</i>

77
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,291
JUST AS THE TWO OF YOU ARE.

78
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,875
- STOP SPEAKING IN RIDDLES.

79
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,583
- I INTEND TO,

80
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,666
BUT THE TIME
IS NOT YET RIGHT.

81
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,916
- AND WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

82
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,708
- THAT YOU DO NOT
YET COMPREHEND

83
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,291
THE ENORMITY OF
THE <i>SOLDATS,</i> MY DEAR.

84
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,625
THINK OF THEM
AS AN ENORMOUS SHROUD

85
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,833
ENCOMPASSING
THE VERY EARTH ITSELF.

86
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,166
I HAVE THE BOOK,

87
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,875
THE SOURCE OF
THE PHOTOCOPY I SENT YOU.

88
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:37,375
THE BEGINNING OF ALL OF THIS
IS INSCRIBED WITHIN IT.

89
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:41,958
IN THREE DAYS TIME,
I WILL REVEAL ITS LOCATION.

90
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:45,625
WE SHALL MEET HERE
AT THE SAME TIME AND PLACE.

91
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,041
- ( gasps )
HOLD ON!

92
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,291
( grunts )

93
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,375
- ( leaves rustle )

94
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,250
- Woman:
"THE WINDS MUST BLOW

95
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:40,166
IN THE SAME DIRECTION,
MY DARLING CHLOE.

96
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,666
DO YOU RECALL
HOW THE BREEZES RIPPLED

97
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,875
THROUGH OUR BEAUTIFUL VINEYARD?

98
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,416
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE WINDS

99
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,833
FROM DIFFERENT
DIRECTIONS COLLIDE?

100
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:54,916
WHIRLWINDS, CHAOS
AND NEEDLESS EDDIES ARISE.

101
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,875
WE MUST WORK HARD,
MY PRECIOUS CHLOE 

102
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,666
SO THAT OUR DELICATE GRAPES
WILL NOT BE BRUISED."

103
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,791
- MISS CHLOE?

104
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:04,875
I DO NOT RECALL
SUMMONING YOU HERE.

105
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,083
AND AS I AM ACTING UNDER
THEIR DIRECT APPROVAL,

106
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,500
THAT ALSO ENCOMPASSES
MAKING CONTACT WITH THOSE TWO.

107
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,791
"LET US FEED THE SAPLINGS
WITH WATER AND LIGHT."

108
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,791
THAT HAS ALWAYS
BEEN OUR PRINCIPLE,

109
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:22,791
HAS IT NOT?

110
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,458
AND FOR THOSE TWO AS WELL.

111
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,666
- YES, I KNOW THAT.

112
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,625
- THEN WHY DO YOU
MONITOR ME?

113
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,833
WHAT RIGHT DO YOU HAVE?

114
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,125
JUST WHAT IS
ALTENA THINKING?

115
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:42,166
- HER CONCERN
IS FOR NOIR'S TRUE FORM.

116
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,625
- ( gasps )
- ( thunder crashes )

117
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,458
- IN THE END,
ALTENA IS DANGEROUS.

118
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:10,333
WE DO NOT AND CANNOT APPROVE
OF HER GRAND RETOUR.

119
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:13,833
YOU KNOW I MUST
REPORT THIS.

120
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,708
- OH, THERE IS NO NEED
FOR THAT.

121
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:26,291
- JUST WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

122
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:29,291
- THE DECISION HAS
ALREADY BEEN MADE.

123
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,000
- THAT CANNOT BE.

124
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:43,083
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT
THE PROMISE YOU MADE.

125
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:46,416
OTHERS WILL BE SENT
TO LAMBERT HALL IN YOUR PLACE.

126
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,750
- DO YOU MEAN
TO KILL THOSE TWO?

127
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:22,541
- ( distant gunshots )

128
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,375
( gunshots )
- ( panting )

129
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,875
- ( grunts )

130
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,625
- RIGHT THEN.

131
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,125
- ( groaning )

132
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,708
- ( groans )

133
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,958
- ( gunshots )
- ( grunting )

134
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,958
- ( panting )

135
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,375
- ( gunshot )
- ( man groans )

136
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:29,041
- ( gunshots )
- ( men groaning )

137
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,291
- ( gunshots )
- ( groans echo )

138
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,500
- ( sighs )

139
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,541
SO INSTEAD OF
OUR DAPPER FRIEND,

140
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,791
WE GOT A BUNCH OF
HALF-RATE HENCHMEN.

141
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,541
HENCHMEN WHO LEFT NO TRACES

142
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,375
THANKS TO THE RAIN
AS USUAL.

143
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,583
IT REALLY CHAFES
MY DERRIERE.

144
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,333
- BUT THE MAN
WE MET THREE DAYS AGO

145
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,375
FELT LIKE MORE THAN
JUST BAIT TO ME.

146
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,958
- THAT'S TRUE.

147
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,833
THERE WAS DEFINITELY
SOMETHING THAT SAID 

148
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,625
HE WAS TRYING
TO TELL US SOMETHING.

149
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,041
- HE DID SAY THAT
WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL.

150
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:02,375
AND THAT THE ORDERS
TO SANCTION US STOOD.

151
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,791
- WHICH IMPLIES DIFFERENT
FACTIONS WITHIN THE <i>SOLDATS.</i>

152
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:11,041
AND WHAT'S WORSE,
WE DIDN'T EVEN GET THE BOOK.

153
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,916
ASSUMING OF COURSE
THAT IT EXISTS AT ALL

154
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
OR THAT IT'S
REALLY EVEN IMPORTANT.

155
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,583
IT'S JUST MAKING
MY BRAIN ITCH.

156
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,458
- ( knocks on door )
- ( gasps )

157
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,916
( Mireille approaching )

158
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,291
WHO IS IT?

159
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,875
- ( unlocks )

160
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,250
- ( gasps )

161
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,666
- Chloe: GO AHEAD.
TAKE IT OUT.

162
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,666
- ( both gasp )

163
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,125
- REALLY.
THIS IS YOUR HOME, AFTER ALL.

164
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,833
- RIGHT.

165
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,041
THEN WE'LL JUST DO
AS WE PLEASE THEN.

166
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,916
- ( kettle whistles )
- ( Kirika gasps )

167
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:13,958
UM, WOULD YOU 
LIKE SOME TEA?

168
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,541
- ( gasps )
- YES, THANK YOU.

169
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,708
- I ONLY HAVE ORANGE PEKOE
RIGHT NOW.

170
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,041
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?

171
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,750
- YES, THANK YOU.
- ( exhales )

172
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,416
- EXCELLENT.

173
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,250
- WAIT A MINUTE!  STOP THAT.

174
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,250
AND WHAT IN THE HELL
ARE YOU THINKING?

175
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,041
- THE MOON IS SO BEAUTIFUL.

176
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,041
COULD WE TURN OUT
THE LIGHTS?

177
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,333
- THE LIGHTS?!
ARE YOU CRAZY?

178
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,541
- IT IS...

179
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,791
LOVELY.

180
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,291
- IT'S GOOD.
- YES, ISN'T IT?

181
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,375
I TRIED SOMETHING NEW,
SOMETHING FROM A BOOK.

182
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,000
- SO, JUST WHAT ARE YOU
HERE FOR?

183
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:42,250
YOU DIDN'T COME HERE JUST
TO HAVE TEA, DID YOU?

184
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,791
- THERE ARE BISCUITS TOO.

185
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,125
- STOP IT.

186
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:00,333
SO WHEN YOU SAID THAT
YOU WERE THE "TRUE NOIR,"

187
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,458
JUST WHAT DID YOU MEAN?

188
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,625
- THAT I'M DIFFERENT
FROM YOU, OF COURSE.

189
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,958
- AND EXACTLY WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY DIFFERENT?

190
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,958
- IT IS ALL INSCRIBED
WITHIN THE BOOK.

191
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:14,750
- "BOOK."  THE BOOK
THOSE COPIES CAME FROM?

192
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:20,458
- YOU KNOW, I WAS
WATCHING YOU TODAY...

193
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,166
AT LAMBERT HALL.

194
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,041
THERE WAS NO DOUBT 
THAT YOU WOULD WIN.

195
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,208
- THEN YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO SENT THOSE MEN?

196
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:32,916
ANSWER ME!

197
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,708
- AN ANSWER...

198
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:48,333
IS SOMETHING YOU MUST
FIND FOR YOURSELF.

199
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:52,000
THAT'S WHAT ALTENA
ALWAYS SAYS TO ME.

200
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,208
- ALTENA?

201
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,916
WHO IS ALTENA?

202
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,375
CUT IT OUT, DAMN IT!

203
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:04,041
THIS WHOLE THING IS TURNING
INTO A MAD TEA PARTY.

204
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,500
- HUH?

205
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,208
A MAD...

206
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,750
- LIKE "ALICE IN WONDERLAND."

207
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,375
- ( sighs )

208
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,541
WELL, AT LEAST ONE OF YOU

209
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,583
HAS HAD SOME
LITERARY SCHOOLING.

210
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:28,333
- IT REALLY IS SO BEAUTIFUL.

211
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:37,083
- UM, WOULD YOU
LIKE ANOTHER CUP?

212
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,291
- YES, PLEASE.

213
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:43,291
- MAKE MINE
DARK WITH SUGAR.

214
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,333
- THANK YOU.

215
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,166
THE TEA WAS DELICIOUS.

216
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,166
- ( gasps )

217
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,166
- COULD I KEEP
THIS ONE, PLEASE?

218
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,041
PERHAPS WE'LL
HAVE TEA AGAIN...

219
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,166
SOMEDAY PER CHANCE.

220
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,958
- ABOUT THAT FORK--

221
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,958
- WHEN I MADE THE TEA,

222
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,583
BUT SHE NEVER LET
HER GUARD DOWN,

223
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,833
NOT EVER.

224
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:01,791
THE MAN WHO CONTACTED US,

225
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:05,541
THE MAN WHO SAID HE'D TELL US
THE LOCATION OF THE BOOK...

226
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:10,291
I'M AFRAID THAT
HE'S NO LONGER ALIVE.

227
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:18,500
- I AGREE.

228
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:02,125
- ( techno music playing )
- ( women chanting )
