1
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,333
- ( men chanting )

2
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:43,083
- Kirika: NOIR--

3
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:46,791
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE.

4
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:50,000
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH--

5
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:53,125
THE PEACE OF
THE NEWLY BORN,

6
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,416
THEIR BLACK HANDS PROTECT.

7
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,250
DO IT.

8
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,416
SHOOT ME NOW.

9
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,833
PLEASE, MIREILLE!

10
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:23,958
SHOOT ME.

11
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:26,500
MIREILLE!  MIREILLE!

12
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,750
( cries )
MIREILLE.

13
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,583
KILL ME.

14
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:38,791
PLEASE!

15
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,125
( cries )

16
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,208
MIREILLE.

17
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,375
( cries )

18
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,583
WHY?

19
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,833
WHY?

20
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,791
- WHY?
I WANTED TO.

21
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:05,208
BUT I JUST COULDN'T.

22
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,791
- ( cars honking )

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,416
- THE FLOWER
NEVER TURNED BLACK.

24
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,000
IT JUST WITHERED AND DIED.

25
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:22,083
KIRIKA'S NOT COMING BACK.

26
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,583
- WHERE AM--

27
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,458
( groans )

28
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,500
HUH?

29
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,583
- ( door opens )

30
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:40,541
- Man: AHH, YOU ARE
AWAKE AT LAST.

31
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,458
- WHERE AM I?

32
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,041
- THIS IS MY HOME.

33
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,083
WE FOUND YOU COLLAPSED
AT THE EDGE OF THE VILLAGE.

34
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,708
I AM KNOWN AS TRISTAN.

35
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,208
AND THIS IS
MY WIFE MARGARET.

36
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,250
- MY NAME...

37
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,250
MY NAME--

38
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,000
- WE KNOW THAT, CHILD.

39
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:10,291
JUST AS WE KNEW YOU WOULD
COME TO THIS VILLAGE SOME DAY.

40
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,875
- ( gasps )
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

41
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,000
HOW COULD YOU KNOW?

42
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:19,833
I DON'T KNOW WHERE I WAS

43
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,791
OR WHERE I WAS GOING.

44
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:25,291
SO HOW COULD YOU KNOW
THAT I'D BE HERE?

45
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,791
- Tristan: YOU WILL KNOW
THE ANSWER SOON ENOUGH. 

46
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,583
HMM.

47
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,291
YOU CAME BECAUSE YOU WERE
MEANT TO COME HERE.

48
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,083
- MEANT TO COME?

49
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,958
HOW CAN YOU KNOW SOMETHING
I DON'T KNOW MYSELF?

50
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,291
HAVE WE MET
SOMEWHERE BEFORE?

51
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:43,583
- BEFORE?  NO.
BUT IT'S NOT AN ISSUE

52
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,458
THAT SHOULD CONCERN YOU.

53
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,291
- I'VE BROUGHT YOU
SOME FRESH CLOTHING.

54
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,291
YOUR BREAKFAST IS READY!

55
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,291
- COMING.

56
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,541
- ( sniffing )

57
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:15,083
- THIS VILLAGE IS ON THE BORDER
NEAR A CERTAIN PLACE.

58
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:19,166
YES, THE SAME PLACE THAT YOU
HAVE BEEN HEADING TOWARDS.

59
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,625
THIS VILLAGE GUARDS
THE ENTRANCE TO THAT PLACE.

60
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:27,083
- AND WHERE SHOULD I GO?

61
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,166
- THERE'S AN OLD STONE MONUMENT

62
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,166
ON THIS TOWN'S WEST SIDE.

63
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,666
I BELIEVE YOU SHOULD
GO THERE FIRST.

64
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,666
- ( children laughing )

65
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,791
( overlapping chatter )

66
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,708
- Girl: HEY, NO FAIR.
- ( boys chatter )

67
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,875
- Girl: I CAN'T RUN
IN THESE SHOES.

68
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,125
- Boy #1: LAST ONE THERE
IS A ROTTEN EGG.

69
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,500
- Girl: WAIT FOR ME.
COME ON, YOU GUYS.

70
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:22,416
- WHY AM I HERE?

71
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,750
HOW DID I END UP
COMING TO THIS VILLAGE?

72
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,375
THEY ALL KNOW WHO I AM.

73
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,958
THE ONLY ONE
WHO DOESN'T KNOW

74
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,750
IS ME.

75
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,875
- ( bell rings )

76
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,083
- ( gasps )

77
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,625
- OH.
- WELL, GO AND GET IT.

78
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,333
- THANK YOU, MISTRESS.  HUH?

79
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
OH?

80
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:52,375
- I-- I KILLED YOUR FAMILY.

81
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:57,458
I REMEMBER KILLING THEM,
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY.

82
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,500
MIREILLE.

83
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,458
- MY NAME ISN'T
MIREILLE, MISTRESS.

84
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:08,000
- BUT I KNOW
THAT I KILLED THEM.

85
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,791
- OF COURSE YOU DID.

86
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,375
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOIR.
( giggles )

87
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:19,125
- WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME!
- BRING THE BALL.

88
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,791
- LET'S GO PLAY
BY THE PASTURE INSTEAD, OKAY?

89
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,375
I'LL RACE YOU THERE!

90
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,375
- HMM?
( groans )

91
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:49,541
- HMM?  AH, YOU'VE ARRIVED
JUST IN TIME.

92
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,625
SO, WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF OUR VILLAGE?

93
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:56,500
- I FOUND IT QUITE LOVELY.

94
00:09:56,583 --> 00:10:00,333
- ISN'T IT?
BUT NOW THAT YOU'RE BACK,

95
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,791
YOU MUST MEET
OUR TOWN ELDER THEBALT.

96
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,958
- WELCOME, CHILD.
WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

97
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,083
- Tristan:
AND MAY I ALSO INTRODUCE

98
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,791
OUR OTHER GUESTS.

99
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,541
- THERE'S NO NEED.

100
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,375
LET'S FINISH OUR TALKS FIRST,
SHALL WE?

101
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,208
- I'M SURE BY NOW,
YOU'VE CONVEYED

102
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,250
OUR SUGGESTION TO HER, RIGHT?

103
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,416
- NO, I'M AFRAID NOT.

104
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,041
- OH, REALLY?
THEN WE'LL TELL HER OURSELVES.

105
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,125
- IT WOULD BE
RATHER POINTLESS.

106
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,583
- WHAT'S THAT?
- OUR PEOPLE'S BELIEFS

107
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,833
HAVE NOT CHANGED
IN 1,000 YEARS. 

108
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,375
( chuckles )

109
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,875
UNLIKE YOURS I FEAR.

110
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,208
- ( gunshots ) 
- ( men groan )

111
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,375
- ( gasps )
- ( gunshot )

112
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,333
- ( grunts )

113
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,583
- ( gunshot )
- ( groaning )

114
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,375
- ( distant gunshots )

115
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,833
- LET'S STEP OUT FRONT.

116
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:15,375
- BUT WHY?

117
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,791
- I'M AFRAID THAT
OUR LATE GUESTS

118
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:21,875
WERE AMONG THOSE WHO OPPOSE
"THE GRAND <i>RETOUR."</i>

119
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,333
THEIR INTENT WAS TO KEEP YOU

120
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,375
FROM SEEING THE LADY,

121
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,541
WHICH WOULD OPPOSE

122
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:31,375
THE CAUSE FOR WHICH
THIS VILLAGE HAS ALWAYS STOOD.

123
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,083
AND THAT WE COULD NOT ALLOW.

124
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,166
- WHAT KIND OF PLACE
IS THIS?

125
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,625
WHO ARE YOU?

126
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,500
- ( chuckles )

127
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:01,833
I BEG YOUR FORGIVENESS

128
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,833
FOR NOT EXPLAINING SOONER

129
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,833
FOR, YOU SEE,
EVERYONE IN THIS TOWN IS...

130
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,791
A <i>SOLDAT.</i>

131
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,208
- ( gasps )

132
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,500
- Tristan:
FAR BEYOND THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS

133
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,208
THAT RISE ABOVE THIS VILLAGE,

134
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:43,416
IN THE BORDERLANDS
THAT DIVIDE SPAIN AND FRANCE,

135
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,500
IS A PLACE THAT BELONGS
TO NO COUNTRY.

136
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,041
IT IS A PLACE THAT CANNOT
BE FOUND ON ANY MAP,

137
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,875
A PLACE THAT HAS BEEN
FORGOTTEN BY TIME.

138
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:57,166
IT MAY SEEM QUITE
HARD TO BELIEVE, 

139
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,875
BUT THERE ARE STILL
SEVERAL SUCH PLACES

140
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,875
IN THIS WORLD OF OURS.

141
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,875
THE PLACE BEYOND THIS VILLAGE
IS ONE OF THEM.

142
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,458
WHATEVER NAME IT ONCE HAD
IS LOST.

143
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,000
IT IS CALLED SIMPLY,
"THE MANOR."

144
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,000
- ( gasps )

145
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,875
- THE REASON
YOU UNCONSCIOUSLY

146
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,041
FOLLOWED THE PATH
TOWARDS THE MANOR

147
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:19,333
IS BECAUSE YOU ARE NOIR.

148
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,500
- ( gasps )

149
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,041
- THE LAND BEYOND HERE

150
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,000
IS SACRED GROUND
FOR THE <i>SOLDATS.</i>

151
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:28,875
AND TO INTERFERE IN
THE AFFAIRS THERE IS TABOO.

152
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,875
THAT IS WHY
THEY WILL STOP AT NOTHING

153
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,416
TO KEEP YOU
FROM LEAVING THIS VILLAGE.

154
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,125
- YOU MEAN, THE ONES
 WHO SENT THOSE MEN?

155
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,416
- HMM, THAT'S CORRECT.

156
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,916
FOR EVEN AS WE ARE THE
DESCENDENTS OF THE <i>SOLDATS,</i>

157
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,416
SO ARE THEY.

158
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,166
SO THIS IS THEIR LAST CHANCE.

159
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,041
IN THE 10th CENTURY,

160
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,875
THE <i>SOLDATS</i> SENT THEIR SEED
TO LIE DORMANT

161
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:59,416
DEEP WITHIN EVERY
NICHE OF SOCIETY,

162
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,333
MUCH LIKE THE GERMS
THAT CAUSE SCARLET FEVER.

163
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,916
THROUGH THEM,
THE <i>SOLDATS</i> WERE ABLE

164
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,250
TO PLAY A GREAT PART
IN ALL ASPECTS

165
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,750
OF HUMAN HISTORY.

166
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,041
- Kirika:
"THE BLOOD OF THE <i>SOLDATS</i>

167
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,708
WILL SEEP THROUGHOUT
THE WILDERNESS

168
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,791
AND FLOW INTO
THE GREAT RIVER."

169
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:17,625
- Tristan: EXACTLY, BUT AT
THE END OF THAT LONG JOURNEY,

170
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:21,208
SOME OF THE <i>SOLDATS</i> HAD BECOME
SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT.

171
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,375
THEY HAD BECOME
A BLACK SHROUD 

172
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,833
THAT SOUGHT TO ENVELOPE
THE ENTIRE WORLD.

173
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,750
"THE GRAND <i>RETOUR"</i>
 MEANS A RETURN

174
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,666
TO THE ROOTS
OF THE <i>SOLDATS.</i>

175
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,208
BUT AMONG THE <i>SOLDATS,</i>

176
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,333
THERE ARE THOSE WHO'VE
TURNED AGAINST THE OLD WAYS

177
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,916
BECAUSE TO THEM,
YOU SEE,

178
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,458
THE <i>SOLDATS</i> HAVE
ALREADY BECOME

179
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,041
THE POINT
OF THE WORLD ITSELF.

180
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,333
- Councilman: I UNDERSTAND.

181
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:52,541
EXECUTION OF THE PLAN
IS APPROVED.

182
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,166
WE'RE ALL AGREED THEN?

183
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,375
- BLOOD MUST ALWAYS BE SHED,

184
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:04,916
EVEN THE BLOOD OF OUR
BRETHREN <i>SOLDATS</i> IF REQUIRED.

185
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,666
- INDEED.
THAT IS A TRUTH

186
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,375
THAT THE <i>SOLDATS</i> HAVE
ALWAYS KNOWN.

187
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,875
- ( rumbling )

188
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,875
- AND YOU SAY
THAT IT'S BEEN 1,000 YEARS?

189
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,000
- WE HAVE AN ANCIENT TASK

190
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,666
THAT WE HAVE BEEN
CHARGED WITH.

191
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,625
THAT TASK IS TO GUARD
THE MANOR WITH OUR LIVES.

192
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:30,416
THE <i>SOLDATS</i> ARE
WITH THE TRUTH.

193
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,416
WE KNOW THE TRUE NATURE
OF THE WORLD OF MAN

194
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,583
AND SO DOES THAT LADY.

195
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,041
- THAT'S ALTENA, RIGHT?

196
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,333
- YES.

197
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:46,500
THERE, AT THE MANOR,
SHE GUARDS THE WAYS 

198
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:47,833
OF OUR LOST HISTORY,

199
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,083
AWAITING THE TIME
OF THE RITUAL.

200
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:53,500
FOR IN THE DARKNESS
OF MEDIEVAL TIMES, 

201
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,333
WHEN THE <i>SOLDATS</i> FIRST
WENT UNDERGROUND,

202
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,500
TWO HANDS WERE LEFT BEHIND

203
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,375
ON THE DARK SURFACE
TO CARRY OUT ITS BIDDING.

204
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,000
- NOIR.

205
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:06,833
- YES, THE <i>SOLDATS</i> MUST
REGAIN THESE HANDS,

206
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,000
WHICH WE HAVE LOST.

207
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,375
FOR IT IS THE REVIVAL

208
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,541
OF THE RITUAL
OF ACCESSION TO NOIR

209
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:16,500
THAT WILL TRULY SYMBOLIZE
"THE GRAND <i>RETOUR."</i>

210
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,708
- ( gasps )

211
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,583
- PLEASE, WE MUST GO NOW.

212
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:30,583
- HUH?

213
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,541
- THEY WILL COME
WITHIN THE NIGHT.

214
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,958
YOU MUST LEAVE IMMEDIATELY.

215
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,708
MY WIFE WILL
SHOW YOU THE WAY.

216
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,791
- BUT HOW CAN I JUST--

217
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,041
- YOU MUST GO.

218
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,791
- HMM?

219
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,916
- ( gunshots )

220
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,750
- Margaret:
THERE IS NO TIME LEFT.

221
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,541
WE MUST HURRY!

222
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,166
- ( gunshots )

223
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,000
( gunshot, gunfire )
- ( groans )

224
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:26,958
- ( soldier grunts )

225
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,625
- PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR HEAD

226
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,125
AND GET DOWN
ON YOUR STOMACH!

227
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,625
- THE WOMAN'S
GOTTEN AWAY!

228
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,833
THERE WAS ONLY ONE
OLD MAN IN THERE!

229
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,500
- ( pants )

230
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,708
- Margaret:
PLEASE, WE MUST HURRY.

231
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,541
- ( panting )

232
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,375
- Soldier: YOU'RE BLOCKING
THE LINE OF FIRE!

233
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,875
GET OUT OF THERE NOW, ERIC!

234
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,083
PULL BACK!
- ( gun clicks )

235
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,291
- HUH?  AAH! 
- ( gunshot )

236
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,000
- THESE PEOPLE!

237
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,791
THEY'RE ALL CRAZY.

238
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,541
- ( rumbling )
- ( gasps )

239
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,166
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

240
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,208
ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE

241
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,208
ARE DYING FOR WHAT?

242
00:18:56,291 --> 00:19:00,208
- THEY DIE BECAUSE
THAT'S THE TRUTH OF MEN.

243
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,208
- I DON'T--

244
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:05,083
- UNDERSTAND?
BUT OF COURSE YOU DO.

245
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:08,125
THAT IS WHAT
MAKES YOU NOIR.

246
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,250
- ( gasps )

247
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,000
- MAN COMMITS SINS.

248
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,875
IT'S OUR NATURE.

249
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,375
THE <i>SOLDATS</i> COMMIT SINS
AS ALL MEN DO,

250
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,916
BUT WE WILL ALSO SHED
OUR OWN BLOOD WILLINGLY.

251
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,750
- ( sighs )

252
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,916
- BUT WHY MUST--

253
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,250
- ( growls )

254
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,750
- ( gasps )

255
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,708
- ( man screams )
- ( shotgun cocks )

256
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:33,916
- ( panting )
( grunts )

257
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,958
- AAH!

258
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,000
- ( gunfire )
- ( screaming )

259
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,083
- ( groans )
- ( barking )

260
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,375
- THE GIRL'S NOT THERE!

261
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,416
- SHUT UP THAT DAMN DOG
SO WE CAN HEAR!

262
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,833
- ( gunshots )
- ( groaning )

263
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,875
- WHERE'S IT COMING FROM?
- IT'S BEHIND US.

264
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,041
IN THE TREE!

265
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,125
- ( men whimper )

266
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,041
- ( screaming )

267
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,166
- ( screams )

268
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,958
- EXCELLENT.

269
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,541
THAT'S HOW...
