1
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:41,166
- ( men chanting )

2
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,916
- Kirika: NOIR--

3
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,625
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE--

4
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:49,833
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH.

5
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:52,333
THE PEACE OF
THE NEWLY BORN,

6
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:54,916
THEIR BLACK HANDS PROTECT.

7
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:59,916
- ( sirens wailing )
- ( car horns honking )

8
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,583
- ( women vocalizing )

9
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,208
- IT SEEMS THE MEXICANS

10
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:14,333
THINK THEY ALREADY
OWN NEW YORK.

11
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:15,458
- HMM.

12
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,333
- A STEADY STREAM OF ENFORCERS

13
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,500
IS ALREADY FILTERING IN
FROM MEXICO.

14
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,500
WE CANNOT AFFORD TO STAND BY
AND DO NOTHING.

15
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,875
- THE MEXICANS HAVE
NOTHING TO LOSE,

16
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:28,250
JUST AS OUR OWN ANCESTORS
ONCE HAD NOTHING TO LOSE.

17
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:31,500
THOSE WHO ARE STARVING
CAN BE STRONG INDEED. 

18
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:34,541
- BUT, SIR--
- DO NOT WORRY.

19
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,458
WE WILL PROTECT THE LAND

20
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,000
THAT OUR FATHERS
AND OUR BROTHERS

21
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,916
PAID FOR WITH THEIR
WITH THEIR BLOOD

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,875
FOR THAT IS THE DUTY
OF AN HONORABLE MAN.

23
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:46,208
- SO WE'LL FIGHT THEN?
- WE WILL CRUSH THE MEXICANS

24
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,583
IN THE NAME
OF THE <i>COSA NOSTRA.</i>

25
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:54,583
- MAY WE MEET AGAIN SOON, 
DON GREONE.

26
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:01,916
- HMM?

27
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,666
- ( women vocalizing )

28
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:12,583
- ( Don grunts )

29
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,958
- ( men scream, groan )

30
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,916
- Mireille:
THE MEMBERS OF THE MAFIA

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,291
DO NOT REFER
TO THEMSELVES BY THAT NAME.

32
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,250
ORIGINATING IN SICILY,

33
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,333
THEY CALL THEMSELVES
THE <i>COSA NOSTRA.</i>

34
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,416
HOWEVER, GIVEN 
THAT OUR CLIENT

35
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,750
WAS IN POSSESSION
OF THE DOCUMENT

36
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,250
WE WERE LOOKING FOR,
WE HAD NO CHOICE

37
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,208
BUT TO CARRY OUT
THIS ASSIGNMENT.

38
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,333
- THAT'S TRUE.

39
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,625
HOWEVER,
WE COMPLETED THE JOB

40
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,083
AND WE STILL
HAVEN'T RECEIVED

41
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,250
THE CONTRACT
WE WERE PROMISED.

42
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,958
- YES, BUT THE ARRANGEMENTS
HAVE BEEN MADE.

43
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,791
AND IN THE CONTRACT
OF THE GREONE FAMILY,

44
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,708
IT SEEMS WE FINALLY FOUND
A LINK TO THE <i>SOLDATS.</i>

45
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,791
I CAN'T WAIT TO READ IT
FOR MYSELF.

46
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,041
HOW ABOUT YOU?

47
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,083
- ( chewing loudly )

48
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,791
- ( men gasp )

49
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,000
( whispering )
DON SALVATORE.

50
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,250
- RICARDO.
- SIR!

51
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:34,166
- GO TO SICILY AND SUMMON
"THE <i>INTOCCABILE."</i>

52
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,291
- THE <i>INTOCCABILE?!</i>
<i>-</i> YES.

53
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,458
- BUT--
BUT, SIR, SHE'S--

54
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:41,166
- YOU HEARD ME.
SUMMON HER AT ONCE.

55
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,166
THE TIME HAS PASSED
FOR ANY HESITATION.

56
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,458
- ( children laughing )

57
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,166
( laughing continues )
- ( dog barks )

58
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,041
- HEY, BIG SISTER!

59
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,791
- OH?  AND YOU'RE SURE?

60
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,625
RIGHT.  ANYTHING ELSE?

61
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,333
( gasps )
- HUH?

62
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,208
- OH NO, IT'S NOTHING
TO BE CONCERNED WITH.

63
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,791
YES, THANKS FOR THE INFO.

64
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:23,375
AND PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF
ANYTHING ELSE COMES UP, OKAY?

65
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,125
- ( phone beeps )

66
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,750
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?

67
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,416
- IT'S NOTHING.  REALLY.

68
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:38,291
THE <i>INTOCCABILE.</i>

69
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:14,083
- I KNOW NO FEAR.

70
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,916
- ( sighs )

71
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:25,000
- ( footsteps approach )

72
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,208
- ( engine starts )

73
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,041
- ( inaudible )

74
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,083
- ( gasping )

75
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,166
- THE <i>INTOCCABILE.</i>

76
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:08,750
- YES, OUR <i>INTOCCABILE</i>
 HAS RETURNED

77
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,291
FIVE YEARS AGO,

78
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,708
YOU SLEW YOUR OWN FATHER

79
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,958
IN THE NAME OF HONOR.

80
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,916
WHEN YOUR OWN BLOOD
BROKE THE CODE OF SILENCE,

81
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,041
THE <i>OMERTA,</i> YOU DID
WHAT WAS NECESSARY.

82
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,125
OF ALL OUR FAMILY,
THE GREONE BLOOD

83
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,250
LIVES ON
MOST STRONGLY IN YOU.

84
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,166
AND FOR THAT,
MY GRANDDAUGHTER,

85
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,958
I BANISHED YOU
TO SICILY.

86
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,208
AND YOU OBEYED ME
WITHOUT A WORD.

87
00:07:56,291 --> 00:08:00,583
BUT TIMES HAVE CHANGED
AND NOW THE ONLY ONE

88
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,958
WHO CAN PROTECT
THE <i>COSA NOSTRA'S</i> HONOR

89
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,416
IS YOU,
THE <i>INTOCCABILE.</i>

90
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,791
THE HONORABLE MEMBERS
OF THE <i>COMMISSIONE</i>

91
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,291
SHALL STAND WITNESS

92
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,875
AS THE POWER
OF THE GREONE FAMILY

93
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:15,208
IS TRANSFERRED TO
ITS RIGHTFUL HEIR AT LAST.

94
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,708
THIS IS THE DAGGER

95
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,250
WITH WHICH
YOU SLEW YOUR FATHER.

96
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,000
- ( grunts )

97
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,583
( strained )
WELL DONE.

98
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,541
I ACCEPT THE PRICE.

99
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,625
IT IS MY PENALTY FOR TAKING
YOUR FREEDOM AWAY FROM YOU 

100
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,625
AND FORFEITING
THE FAMILY'S HONOR.

101
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,583
I LOVE YOU, SILVANA.

102
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,250
- AND I,
GRANDFATHER,

103
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:14,833
LOVE YOU AS WELL.

104
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,833
- ( clipping continues )

105
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,416
- ( clipping stops )
- HUH?

106
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,041
MIREILLE?

107
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,083
- THE <i>INTOCCABILE.</i>

108
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,125
HAVE YOU HEARD
THAT NAME BEFORE?

109
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:59,375
- THE INVIOLATE ONE.

110
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,625
THE INTOCCABILE.

111
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,333
THE ONE WHO MUST
NEVER BE CROSSED, CORRECT?

112
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,125
- I KNOW HER.

113
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:16,625
I MET HER WHEN
I WAS JUST A CHILD.

114
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:20,375
MY FATHER WAS
ON FRIENDLY TERMS

115
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,166
WITH A NUMBER OF
PROMINENT MEN IN SICILY.

116
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,416
- ( men chatter )

117
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,750
- Mireille: AND ON ONE
OF HIS BUSINESS TRIPS,

118
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,625
HE BROUGHT ME ALONG.
- ( speaks Italian )

119
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,166
- Mireille:
WHILE WE WHERE THERE,

120
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,125
DON SALVATORE MADE
AN UNEXPECTED APPEARANCE.

121
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,333
HE BROUGHT HIS GRANDDAUGHTER
WITH HIM.

122
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:47,041
SILVANA GREONE, WHO,
AS I WAS SOON TO LEARN,

123
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,833
WAS CALLED
THE BRUTAL PRINCESS.

124
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,375
- ( man gasps )

125
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,750
- Silvana: FROM THE TIMING 
OF THE DON'S ASSASSINATION,

126
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:06,083
IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE KILLER
KNEW OF HIS SCHEDULE,

127
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,375
WHICH MEANS THAT THIS FAMILY
HAS A TRAITOR.

128
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,791
THAT TRAITOR IS YOU, RIZZO.

129
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,125
YOU JOINED FORCES
WITH THE MEXICANS

130
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,041
AND SOLD OUT THE DON,
DIDN'T YOU?!

131
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,333
- HELP ME!

132
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,250
- THERE IS AN OLD
SICILIAN PROVERB:

133
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,875
"TO WASH AWAY BLOOD

134
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,833
YOU MUST FIRST
SHED MORE BLOOD."

135
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,541
- ( gasps )
- ( girls screaming )

136
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,208
- NO!
- ( gunshots )

137
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,500
- ( screaming continues )

138
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:34,000
- Rizzo: NO! ( cries )
- ( gunshot ) 

139
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,791
- ( crying )
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.

140
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,250
YOU'RE RIGHT.

141
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,916
I HIRED HIM.

142
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,291
I HIRED NOIR.

143
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,041
- NOIR?

144
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,291
- Man: MY LADY,
WHEN WE FOUND HIM,

145
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,166
HE HAD THIS.

146
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:54,500
- Rizzo: IT'S AN ANCIENT
USELESS PIECE OF PAPER. 

147
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,666
THAT CONTRACT IS THE PAYMENT
THAT NOIR DEMANDED.

148
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,250
I DON'T KNOW WHY
HE WANTED IT.

149
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,708
- ( woman hacking )
- I SWEAR I DON'T!

150
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,458
- ( woman screaming )
- PLEASE!

151
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,250
- ( gunshots )
- ( screaming intensifies )

152
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,958
- SPARE THEM!
I'M BEGGING YOU!

153
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:09,125
PLEASE!
( cries )

154
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
- ( footsteps approach )

155
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,208
- Silvana: PAOLO.

156
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,041
DOMINIC.

157
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,416
AND FRANCESCO.

158
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,333
THREE MAFIA HIT MEN
WITH THE NAMES OF SAINTS.

159
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:46,541
- Mireille: THREE OF SICILY'S
MOST PROMINENT KILLERS

160
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,916
HAVE RALLIED TO THE
CALL OF THE <i>INTOCCABILE.</i>

161
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,958
- Silvana: I KNOW...

162
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,375
NO FEAR.

163
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,833
- AND THIS IS?

164
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,291
- IT WOULD APPEAR
THAT NOIR

165
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,125
TOOK THE JOB OF
KILLING DON LUCIO

166
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,166
IN EXCHANGE FOR
THIS CONTRACT. 

167
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,750
- NOIR, HUH?
- YEAH, THAT RIZ.

168
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:28,125
FOR SUCH A LOSER, HE SURE
HIRED A FIRST-RATE ASSASSIN.

169
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:31,000
- THE MURDER OF DON LUCIO
MUST BE REPAID IN FULL.

170
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,500
AS THE NEW HEAD
OF THE GREONE FAMILY,

171
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,416
THAT IS MY FIRST DUTY.

172
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,583
- COOL.

173
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,416
- OF COURSE WE MUST
FIND NOIR FIRST.

174
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,416
- OH, THERE'S NO NEED
FOR THAT.

175
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,916
WE HAVE THIS.

176
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,416
AND AS LONG
AS WE HAVE IT,

177
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,541
NOIR WILL COME TO US.

178
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,666
YOU SEE?
- I DO INDEED.

179
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,416
- BUT LET US MAKE
THAT DECISION

180
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,125
EVEN EASIER
FOR HIM TO MAKE.

181
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,416
- WE UNDERSTAND.

182
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,833

183
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:10,958

00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,708
- OUR CLIENT IS DEAD.

187
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,625
- ( sirens wail )
- THEN SILVANA HAS

188
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,000
THE CONTRACT NOW?

189
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,791
- YES.

190
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,708
SHE'S TAKEN IT
AND HER THREE KILLERS

191
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,000
TO A COUNTRY HOUSE
IN NEW JERSEY.

192
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,250
- IT'S A TRAP, ISN'T IT?

193
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,458
- HER POSITION RIDES UPON
HER EXECUTION OF NOIR.

194
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,583
ONLY BLOOD WILL
WASH OUT BLOOD.

195
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:39,875
- SO WHAT NOW?

196
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,916
- SHE'S THE INVIOLATE ONE,
THE <i>INTOCCABILE.</i>

197
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,583
I CAN'T WIN AGAINST HER,
NOT AGAINST HER.

198
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,375
( crying )
- MIREILLE. 

199
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,916
- I KNOW.

200
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,333
I HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO DO THIS.

- Francesco: THE LORD
TEACHES US TO BE MERCIFUL

206
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:40,041
TO ALL LIVING THINGS.

207
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,750
BUT A FOOL
WHO'D RAISE A HAND

208
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,583
AGAINST THE <i>INTOCCABILE,</i>

209
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,666
EVEN THE LORD MUST
SURELY FORSAKE.

210
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,250
YOU ARROGANT FOOL!

- DID WE GET HIM?

220
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,875
- THIS NOIR,

221
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:28,416
HE'S EVEN BETTER
THAN THEY SAY HE IS.

222
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,750
- ( panting )

223
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,250

AAH!

- ( gunshots )

229
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,791
- Paolo: LADY SILVANA.

230
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,833
TELL US, DID YOU SEE
NOIR'S FACE?

231
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,666
- SEE IT?

232
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,041
NO, I DIDN'T.

233
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,416
- I BLEW
MY GODDAMNED CHANCE.

234
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,833
NO, TO BE HONEST,

235
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,541
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT, ANYHOW.

236
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:46,000
- DID SHE...
SEE YOUR FACE?

237
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,791
- I DON'T KNOW.

238

I JUST DON'T KNOW.

239
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,500
