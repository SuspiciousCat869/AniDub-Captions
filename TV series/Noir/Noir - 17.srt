1
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:41,333
- ( people chanting )

2
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:42,791
- Mireille: NOIR.

3
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:46,291
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE,

4
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:49,000
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH.

5
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:51,916
TO WARD THE DARKNESS
FROM THE NURSING BABES

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,583
THEIR BLACK ROBES
SERVE AS SHIELDS.

7
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,958
- ( boat horn tooting )

8
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,625
- Mireille's voice:
I'M GOING BACK...

9
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:18,125
TO MY HOMELAND, CORSICA.

10
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,958
- HUH?

11
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,666
- I HAVEN'T GONE
BACK THERE SINCE...

12
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:29,625
I WAS AFRAID, BUT NOW...

13
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,000
- ( boat horn tooting )

14
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,791
- Mireille's voice:
AFTER MY PARENTS WERE KILLED,

15
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:24,458
THE BOUQUET FAMILY AND THE
SYNDICATE WE RAN COLLAPSED.

16
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:27,375
CORSICA FELL INTO THE HANDS
OF A RIVAL SYNDICATE

17
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,208
AND, HOMELESS,
I FLED THE COUNTRY

18
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,125
WITH ONLY REMAINING FAMILY,

19
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,666
UNCLE CLAUDE.

20
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,916
- ( gulls cawing )

21
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,166
- ( grunts, cries out )

22
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,833
- OH!
- OH, PLEASE EXCUSE HIM, MISS.

23
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:14,708
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
- ( gasps ) OH!

24
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,458
- UH...

25
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,666
- OH, PLEASE EXCUSE US.
- THANK YOU.

26
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,916
- ( sighs )

27
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:01,375
- AT LONG LAST
I'VE COME HOME.

28
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,041
- ( sighs )

29
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,000
- ( playing notes )

30
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,791
- ( thunks )

31
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,833
- ( exhales )

32
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,666
( sighs )

33
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,750
( breathing shakily )

34
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,791
( sighs )

35
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,875
- ( woman gasps )
LADY ODETTE.

36
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,083
- ( gasps )

37
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,125
( breathes shakily ) MARY?

38
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,875
IS THAT REALLY YOU?

39
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,000
- WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU,

40
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,458
I HONESTLY THOUGHT
MY HEART WOULD STOP.

41
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:41,791
OH, HERE.

42
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,541
YOU'VE GROWN SO MUCH,
MS. MIREILLE.

43
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:50,458
( crying ) I NEVER THOUGHT
I WOULD EVER SEE YOU AGAIN.

44
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,625
AND THEN I--

45
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,250
- WHEN YOU FIRST SAW ME,

46
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,583
YOU CALLED OUT
MY MOTHER'S NAME.

47
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,875
- I SERVED THE MISTRESS,

48
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,458
YOUR MOTHER, LADY ODETTE,

49
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,666
EVER SINCE
SHE WAS A CHILD HERSELF.

50
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,000
I COULD NEVER FORGET
HER LOVELY FACE,

51
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,416
EVEN IF I TRIED.

52
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,083
YOUR RESEMBLANCE
TO HER IS SO STRIKING.

53
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:13,000
OH, I FEEL AS IF THE MISTRESS
HAS RETURNED FROM THE PAST.

54
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,041
- ( clatters )
- ( gasps )

55
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:20,083
- OH. OH.

56
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,291
- OH, THIS IS
MY HUSBAND VICTOR.

57
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,208
- YES, I REMEMBER.

58
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,875
- VICTOR, IT'S LADY MIREILLE.

59
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:31,083
SHE'S LADY ODETTE'S DAUGHTER,
REMEMBER?

60
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:34,583
- ( groans )

61
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,041
- OH, YOU MUST
EXCUSE HIM, PLEASE.

62
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,583
HE-- HE'S NEVER HAD
ANY MANNERS.

63
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,583
- NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT, MARY.

64
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,291
- ( gasps ) OH!

65
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,750
- I IMAGINE
IT'S BEST NOT HAVE

66
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,750
ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THE BOUQUETS.

67
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,541
- OH, LADY MIREILLE.
- THANK YOU,

68
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,250
BUT I'LL BE GOING NOW.

69
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,583
- ( humphs )

70
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,666
- MR. BERTONIE WANTS
TO SEE YOU.

71
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,916
GET IN PLEASE.
- SURE.  WHY NOT?

72
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,583
- ( clears throat )
THANKS, BOYS.

73
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,916
HMM.

74
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,208
LADY ODETTE?

75
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,416
NO, JUST A STUNNING RESEMBLANCE.

76
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,166
MIREILLE BOUQUET,

77
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,208
WHY HAVE YOU RETURNED?

78
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,000
- I'M HERE TO VISIT GRAVES,

79
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,708
NOT FOR REVENGE.

80
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,208
- ARE YOU?

81
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,500
- THE PAST IS THE PAST.

82
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:20,041
I HAVE NO INTEREST IN WHOSE
PROVENCE THESE LANDS ARE NOW.

83
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:23,125
- HMM.  I SEE.

84
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,541
- HOWEVER, 

85
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,791
THERE IS SOMETHING
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.

86
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,083
- AH.
AND THAT IS?

87
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,416
- WHO WAS IT
WHO KILLED MY PARENTS?

88
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,458
- I KNOW THAT IT WASN'T ME.

89
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,916
- I KNOW THAT.

90
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,416
- ( chuckles )

91
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,375
YOU'RE YOUR FATHER'S DAUGHTER,
ALL RIGHT--

92
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:44,875
ALL GUTS AND NERVE.

93
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,041
IN THAT CASE...

94
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,291
WANT ONE?

95
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,833
- ( grunts )

96
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:51,833
- WELL THEN...

97
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,125
YOU NO DOUBT KNOW

98
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,166
THAT MANY FORCES
HAVE LONG BEEN VYING

99
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,375
OVER CORSICA,

100
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,291
MY OWN SYNDICATE
BEING ONE OF THEM.

101
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,750
THE BOUQUETS, HOWEVER,
WERE ALWAYS A BREED APART.

102
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,708
LIKE KINGS, THEY REIGNED OVER
THIS UNDERWORLD OF OURS.

103
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:15,125
YET WITHIN JUST WEEKS
OF THEIR DEATHS,

104
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,000
LAURENT AND ODETTE'S
SYNDICATE COLLAPSED TO DUST.

105
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,250
SUCH A FLEETING THING.

106
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,416
- PLEASE, SPARE ME
THE SENTIMENTALITY.

107
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,250
MY FATHER MUST HAVE
HAD TROUBLE WITH SOMEONE.

108
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:30,250
SOME ORGANIZATION, PERHAPS?

109
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,875
- THERE HAVE BEEN RUMORS

110
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:38,458
THAT YOUR FATHER RAN AFOUL OF
AN ANCIENT AND MALEVOLENT POWER.

111
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,125
- I DON'T KNOW WHERE
THAT STORY BEGAN,

112
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:44,125
BUT I CAN SEE
WHY SOME MIGHT BELIEVE IT.

113
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,250
THE ONE THING I DO KNOW

114
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:50,416
IS THAT IT WAS NOT THE WORK
OF SOMEONE FROM CORSICA.

115
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,458
BUT PERHAPS
MADELIN WOULD KNOW.

116
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:55,416
- ( grunts ) MADELIN?

117
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,958
YOU MEAN GEORGE MADELIN?

118
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,958
- THAT'S CORRECT,

119
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,958
YOUR FATHER'S
OLD RIGHT-HAND MAN.

120
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:04,291
I SUSPECT HE MAY KNOW
FAR MORE THAN I.

121
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,000
- I'D BEEN TOLD
THAT HE WAS DEAD.

122
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,666
- OH NO, HE'S ALIVE.

123
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,625
IF I MAY OFFER
A LAST WORD OF ADVICE:

124
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:17,333
I WOULD LEAVE THIS ISLAND
QUICKLY IF I WERE YOU.

125
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,458
CONSIDER THAT A WARNING.

126
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,666
- HMM.

127
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,791
- ( rock music plays )

128
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,916
- ( chattering )

129
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,833
- ( humming drunkenly )

130
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,541
- ( clatters )

131
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,291
- HUH?
WHO'S BACK THERE?

132
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,458
- IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME,
HASN'T IT?

133
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,666
- UH... ( gasps )

134
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,041
( screams )
- ( bottles shatter )

135
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,541
- IT'S ME, GEORGE, MIREILLE.

136
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,958
- I WAS SO HAPPY TO LEARN
THAT YOU'D SURVIVED.

137
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,541
PLEASE, GEORGE,
I NEED YOUR HELP.

138
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,791
- NO!  GET AWAY FROM ME!
- ( gasps )

139
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,458
- ( pounding )
OPEN UP, GEORGE!

140
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:51,333
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
PLEASE!  OPEN THE DOOR!

141
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,750
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

142
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,333
COME ON,
CAN'T YOU JUST HEAR ME OUT?

143
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,791
- ( gulps,
breathing deeply )

144
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,416
HUH?

145
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,833
OH.

146
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,250
- I WONDER
WHATEVER BECAME OF...

147
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,583
THE OLIVE GROVES
WE USED TO OWN.

148
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,791
- ( sighs )

149
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,750
SOME WOMEN NEVER KNOW
WHEN IT'S TIME TO GIVE UP.

150
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,958
YOUR MOTHER WAS
LIKE THAT TOO, YOU KNOW.

151
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,083
JUST WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU WANT?

152
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,791
- ( clatters )
- DO YOU REMEMBER THIS?

153
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,708
- ( music playing )

154
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:44,916
- ( gasps )

155
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:49,416
- YES, IT'S MY FATHER'S
OLD WATCH.

156
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,375
- ( breathing shakily )

157
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,500
- ( music stops )

158
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:07,333
- ( whispering )
WE CAN'T TALK IN THIS PLACE.

159
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,791
- ( whispering )
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

160
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,041
- TOMORROW.

161
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,375
TOMORROW I WILL TELL YOU

162
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:15,083
EVERYTHING I KNOW.
I PROMISE.

163
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,041
- ( sighs )

164
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:35,541
- ( George sighs ) THE
BOUQUET FAMILY, YOUR FAMILY,

165
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,000
HAD A GREAT SECRET,
MIREILLE.

166
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,416
- WHAT KIND OF SECRET?

167
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,875
- ONE THAT ALLOWED THE BOUQUETS
TO DOMINATE CORSICA.

168
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:48,333
IT CONCERNS A PACT THEY MADE
WITH A CERTAIN ORGANIZATION,

169
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,416
ONE TO WHICH GENERATION
AFTER GENERATION

170
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,208
OF BOUQUETS SWORE LOYALTY

171
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:56,750
IN EXCHANGE FOR DOMINION
OVER THE CORSICAN PEOPLE.

172
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,500
THE BOUQUETS DEAL
WITH THIS POWER

173
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,250
WAS THEIR GREATEST SECRET.

174
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,416
( sighs ) AND THE NAME
OF THAT POWER IS...

175
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,125
- THE SOLDATS.

176
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,833
- ( gasps )

177
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,916
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

178
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,875
- ARE YOU SAYING THAT...

179
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,708
MY PARENTS WERE MEMBERS
OF THE SOLDATS?

180
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,000
- THAT'S RIGHT.

181
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:23,041
THE WATCH YOUR FATHER CARRIED
IS PROOF OF THAT.

182
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,875
- YOU'RE LYING!
- HMM?

183
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,625
- THAT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE.

184
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,583
- I MEAN, MY FAMILY
WAS MURDERED BY THE SOLDATS!

185
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,875
- THAT IS TRUE AS WELL.

186
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,041
- BUT THEN WHY WERE THEY...?

187
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,625
- YOUR PARENTS DIED--
- ( gunshot )

188
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,166
- ( screams, groans )

189
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,916
- GEORGE!

190
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,958
- ( gun firing )
- ( screams )

191
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,083
- ( gasps )

192
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,291
- ( weakly )
MIREILLE...

193
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,250
MASTER LAURENT
AND LADY ODETTE

194
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,750
WERE KILLED FOR TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU.

195
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,125
- ( gasps )

196
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,958
- THERE WAS NOTHING
I COULD DO TO SAVE THEM.

197
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:12,791
AND LIKE A COWARD, I RAN.

198
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,625
( groaning )

199
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:18,208
I'M-- I'M SORRY.

200
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,541
- GEORGE!
- ( gunshot )

201
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:21,875
- ( gasps )

202
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,375
- ( woman singing )

203
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,458
- ( grunting )
- ( gunfire )

204
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:57,416
- ( grunts )

205
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,625
- ( clicks )
- ( clatters )

206
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,125
- ( grunts )
- ( grunts )

207
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,083
- ( gunshot )

208
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,250
- ( grunts )

209
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,708
- ( sighs )

210
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,041
( gasps )

211
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,500
( grunts )

212
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,541
( sighs )

213
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,166
CHLOE.

214
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,916
WHO WAS THIS MAN?

215
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,625
- SOMEONE WHOSE DUTY WAS

216
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:08,291
TO KEEP THE SECRETS
OF CORSICA'S PAST SEALED AWAY.

217
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,958
- I SEE.

218
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,458
AND YOU?

219
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,666
- I WILL NOT HELP HIM
DO HIS DUTY,

220
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,541
NOW WILL I INTERFERE.

221
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:18,958
- THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?

222
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,333
AND DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE JUST SIGHTSEEING.

223
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:24,750
- CORSICA IS
A SPECIAL PLACE...

224
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,375
BOTH FOR ME AND FOR HER.

225
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,583
- FOR HER?

226
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,583
"HER" MEANING KIRIKA?

227
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,416
- THAT'S RIGHT.

228
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,416
SHE AND I ARE QUITE SPECIAL,
YOU KNOW.

229
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,750
SHE AND I ARE
THE TRUE NOIR.

230
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:46,416
- KIRIKA IS PART
OF THE TRUE NOIR?

231
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,666
- ( sighs )

232
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,583
THERE IS SOMETHING...

233
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,625
I HAVE TO SAY TO YOU.

234
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:55,958
- I'M LISTENING.

235
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,041
- IF A TIME COMES

236
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,541
WHEN SHE SAYS THAT
SHE WOULD LIKE TO GO HOME,

237
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,125
DO NOT STOP HER,

238
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:06,625
FOR I AM THE ONE WITH WHOM
SHE IS TO MAKE THAT JOURNEY.

239
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,625
- ( chuckles )
AND WHAT HAPPENS IF I SAY NO?

240
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,625
- THEN I'LL KILL YOU.

241
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,000
- ( inhales sharply )

242
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:16,375
- BUT I WOULD PREFER
TO BECOME FRIENDS WITH YOU.

243
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,625
- FRIENDS?  WITH ME?

244
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,500
- OF COURSE.
YOU ARE HER FRIEND, AREN'T YOU?

245
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,958
I'M SURE WE CAN
BECOME FRIENDS, TOO.

246
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:31,041
AFTER ALL, YOU ARE
A CHILD OF THE SOLDATS

247
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,708
AS WELL, AREN'T YOU?

248
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,083
- ( breathes shakily )

249
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:46,541
A CHILD...
OF THE SOLDATS.

250
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:19,250
- THIS... TURNED OUT TO BE
A WATCH OF THE SOLDATS.

251
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,541
- ( gasps )

252
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,958
- ( grunts, crying )

253
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,625
I...

254
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,416
REALLY AM.

255
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,791
- MIREILLE.

256
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,000
- SHE SAID...

257
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,291
I'M A CHILD
OF THE SOLDATS.

258
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:02,833
- ( women singing )
