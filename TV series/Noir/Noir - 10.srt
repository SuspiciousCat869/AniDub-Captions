1
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:40,750
- ( people chanting )

2
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,625
- Kirika: NOIR.

3
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:46,125
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE,

4
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:49,291
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH.

5
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,875
THE PEACE
OF THE NEWLY BORN,

6
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,500
THEIR BLACK HANDS PROTECT.

7
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,875
- AND AS THE EVIDENCE PROVES,

8
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,375
THE DEFENDANT,
MAURICE RUBIK,

9
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,000
IS CLEARLY GUILTY.

10
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:13,250
THE FACT THAT THE DEFENDANT
IS A POLICE OFFICER ONLY--

11
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,625
- YOUR EVIDENCE
OF CORRUPTION IS SUSPECT.

12
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:16,958
IT IS THEREFORE THE DECISION

13
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,250
OF THIS PRELIMINARY
COURT OF INQUIRY

14
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:22,000
THAT THESE CHARGES AGAINST
THE DEFENDANT BE DROPPED.

15
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:23,458
- HUH?

16
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,333
- HOWEVER, THE DEFENDANT
WILL BE TRANSFERRED

17
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:31,291
TO THE COURT OF MISDEMEANORS
ON THE CHARGE OF BATTERY.

18
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,208
- BUT, YOUR HONOR, PLEASE!

19
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:36,500
THIS CASE IS THE KEYSTONE
OF A HUGE CORRUPTION INQUIRY.

20
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,541
AS SUCH,
IT IS OF VITAL CONCERN

21
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,208
TO BOTH THE POLICE
AND THE COURT!

22
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,250
HUH?

23
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,416
- ( clears throat )
THIS HEARING...

24
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,000
IS DISMISSED.

25
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,541
- ( gasps )

26
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,291
- ( gasps )

27
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,541
- ( both grunt )

28
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,916
- ( chattering )

29
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,000
- ( meowing )

30
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,166
- ( computer beeps )
- ( gasps )

31
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,416
HMM.

32
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:04,250
IT SEEMS THE FIRST HALF
OF OUR FEE HAS BEEN DEPOSITED,

33
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,833
SO AT LEAST OUR CLIENT BELIEVES
THAT WE DID THE JOB.

34
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,208
OF COURSE, I IMAGINE
THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE

35
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:15,375
WHO HAD GRUDGES AGAINST
A CORRUPT COP LIKE RUBIK.

36
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,750
I GUESS THIS TIME
SOMEONE ELSE GOT THERE FIRST.

37
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,625
- YOU'RE WRONG.

38
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,208
THIS HIT WASN'T
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

39
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,833
- HUH?

40
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,750
SO IF NOT THAT, THEN WHAT?

41
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,583
IN ANY CASE, WE STILL HAVE

42
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,500
THE REMAINING HALF OF THIS
ASSIGNMENT TO COMPLETE--

43
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:43,125
THE ONE WHO'S BEHIND IT ALL.

44
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,750
AS LONG AS THE PRELIMINARY
JUDGE IS ON THE TAKE,

45
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,916
CORRUPT COPS LIKE RUBIK
CAN GET AWAY WITH MURDER.

46
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:06,041
( sighs )
WE STILL HAVE A CONTRACT

47
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,416
TO KILL D'ESTAING.

48
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,416
ONCE THAT'S DONE,
WE CAN FIGURE OUT

49
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,166
WHAT TO DO
WITH THE FEE FROM RUBIK.

50
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,708
- ( sighs )

51
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,458
- IT'S GETTING
A LITTLE COOL IN HERE.

52
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,916
HOW ABOUT
I MAKE US SOME TEA?

53
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
- MIREILLE?

54
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,333
- YEAH, I KNOW.
- RIGHT.

55
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,666
- SO WHO COULD'VE BEATEN US?

56
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,708
IN THIS WHOLE INDUSTRY,

57
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,500
THERE'S ONLY A HANDFUL WHO
COULD PULL OFF A HIT LIKE THAT.

58
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,250
BUT I WOULDN'T WORRY.

59
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,166
WE WILL FIND OUT WHO IT IS...

60
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,791
AND SOON.

61
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,833
- ( wind blowing )

62
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,500
- Woman's voice:
I AM ALWAYS PRAYING, CHLOE.

63
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,750
I'M ALWAYS PRAYING FOR YOU.

64
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,833
I PRAY THAT YOU
WILL ACCOMPLISH YOUR TASKS

65
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,833
WITHOUT MISHAP

66
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:34,791
AND THAT YOU WILL RETURN
TO ME WELL AND WHOLE.

67
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,750
- ( chattering )

68
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,125
- NOIR?

69
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,666
- THAT'S RIGHT.

70
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,333
THE WORD ON THE STREET

71
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,541
IS THAT THE ONE WHO POPPED
THE COP AT THE COURTHOUSE

72
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,333
WAS NONE OTHER THAN NOIR.
( chuckles )

73
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,666
THAT HIT WAS SOMETHING ELSE,
ALL RIGHT.

74
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,916
BUT THAT'S NOIR FOR YOU.
I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT

75
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,875
WHEN I HEARD THAT NOIR WAS
TAKING CONTRACTS AGAIN,

76
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,625
BUT I GUESS
IT WAS TRUE, HUH?

77
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,333
ME?  I'M JUST HAPPY
RUBIK GOT HIS.

78
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:14,875
I MEAN,
I MAY BE A CROOK,

79
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,250
BUT COPS WHO WORK
BOTH SIDES OF THE STREET

80
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,875
ARE THE LOWEST FORM OF SCUM.

81
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:22,000
I BET OLD RUBIK IS UP
TO HIS ASS IN BRIMSTONE!

82
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,458
SERVES HIM RIGHT.

83
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,875
- Mireille: THE RUMOR
SEEMS TO BE EVERYWHERE.

84
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,750
AND DOZENS OF THE BEST
INFORMATION SOURCES

85
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,875
IN THE UNDERGROUND
ARE SAYING THAT NOIR DID IT.

86
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,875
- ( people chattering )

87
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,958
- BUT BY "NOIR,"
ARE THEY REFERRING TO US...

88
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,000
OR ARE THEY...

89
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:55,333
REFERRING TO WHOEVER IT WAS
WHO REALLY KILLED RUBIK?

90
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,500
- I DON'T KNOW.

91
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,666
BUT IF...
SOMEONE'S LOOKING FOR NOIR...

92
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,625
- ( sighs )

93
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,125
I DON'T LIKE THE WAY
THIS WIND IS BLOWING.

94
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,666
"HE WHO SEES
HIS OWN REFLECTION DIES."

95
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,791
THAT'S FROM A BOOK
OR SOMETHING, ISN'T IT?

96
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,125
POE, I THINK.

97
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:56,166
NOIR.
AND THIS...

98
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,250
THE SOLDATS,

99
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,791
A MYSTERIOUS ORGANIZATION

100
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:07,166
THAT WAS SOMEHOW INVOLVED
IN THE BIRTH OF THE MAFIA.

101
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,625
HOW CAN IT ALL BE CONNECTED?

102
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,708
- ( chuckles )

103
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,500
- YOUR TASK THIS TIME

104
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,458
WILL BE A VERY SPECIAL ONE.

105
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,625
YOU WILL JOURNEY
TO MEET HER--

106
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,916
BOTH HER AND HER FRIEND.

107
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,958
( sighs ) AT LONG LAST,
THIS DAY HAS COME.

108
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:59,083
AND NOW EVERYTHING
DEPENDS ON YOU, MY CHLOE.

109
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:02,666
GO AND SEE
WITH YOUR OWN EYES.

110
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,000
SEE FOR YOURSELF
AND DECIDE.

111
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,041
- ( rock music plays )

112
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,000
- ( sighs )

113
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:47,750
HMM.

114
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,750
- ( wind blowing )

115
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,833
- ( rustles )

116
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,125
- WHO ARE YOU?

117
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,125
I ASKED YOU WHO YOU WERE.

118
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,125
- JUDGE D'ESTAING.
- ( gasps )

119
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,916
- YOU HAVE COMMITTED
MANY SINS--

120
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,125
COUNTLESS SINS,
ACTUALLY.

121
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,291
- AND YOUR POINT IS?
- ( chuckles )

122
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,375
- RUBIK IS DEAD.

123
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,416
YOU'RE NEXT.

124
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,416
- ARE YOU SAYING YOU'RE
THE ONE WHO KILLED RUBIK?

125
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,208
- ( chuckles ) YES.

126
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,166
HOWEVER, IN ALL HONESTY,

127
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,416
THERE ARE OTHERS
WHO ARE AFTER YOU.

128
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,583
- ( gasps )

129
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,375
- I ONLY CAME TO WARN YOU.

130
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:42,583
FOR YOU SEE, IT IS NOIR
THAT IS AFTER YOUR LIFE.

131
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,041
- ( gasps )

132
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,916
- AND NOIR WILL BRING
DEATH TO YOU.

133
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,666
LET THERE BE NO DOUBT.

134
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,083
THERE'S NO WAY
FOR YOU TO AVOID IT.

135
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,708
YOUR DEATH IS APPROACHING.

136
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,666
IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE NOIR STRIKES.

137
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,125
- JUST WHO THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

138
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,708
- THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE.

139
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,416
I AM ONE
WHO INHERITS THAT MANTLE.

140
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,416
- ( gasps )

- ( casings clattering )

143
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,083
- ( gun cocks )
- OUR DEADLINE IS TONIGHT.

144
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,541
- Kirika's voice: IT'S
POSSIBLE THAT ASSASSIN

145
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,208
MIGHT APPEAR AGAIN.

146
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,875
- Mireille's voice:
THEN WE WAIT FOR THAT MOMENT

147
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,083
AND MAKE THAT CHANCE
OUR TARGET.

148
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,625
THAT'S OUR STYLE.

149
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,958
- ( clicks )
- HMM.

150
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,875
- ( rock music playing )

00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:03,916
- ( cocks )
- ( grunts )

152
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,833
- YOU DID COME.
- ( gun cocks )

153

- ( chuckles )
- ( guns cock )

156
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,125
- IMPRESSIVE.
WHEN IT'S NOT PART OF YOUR JOB,

157
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,833
YOU CAN BE QUITE DEDICATED.

158
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,916
- ( laughs )

159
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,041
- ( cocks )

160
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,041
- TWO-BIT ASSASSINS.

161
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,875
YOU SHOULD LEARN YOUR PLACE.
- ( men chuckling )

162
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,750
- D'Estaing: THE LIKES OF YOU
