1
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,291
- ( chanting )

2
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:46,333
- Kirika: NOIR, IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE--

3
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:49,375
TWO MAIDENS WHO
GOVERN DEATH.

4
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:52,375
THE PEACE
OF THE NEWLY BORN,

5
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,625
THEIR BLACK HANDS PROTECT.

6
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,125
- ( gasps )

7
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:25,125
WE HAVE A JOB.
- WHO'S THE TARGET?

8
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:28,166
- ALBERT DUX.

9
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,666
HE SEEMS TO QUITE
THE NOTORIOUS VILLAIN.

10
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,375
DUX IS A STAR ON THE RISE
IN THE BUSINESS WORLD,

11
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,000
A REAL BIG SHOT.

12
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,375
HOWEVER, WHEN
THE YOUNG PRESIDENT

13
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,875
OF THE VAGNIER GROUP...

14
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,291
- ( camera shutter clicking )
- ...DIED IN AN ACCIDENT,

15
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,291
THERE WERE QUESTIONS.

16
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,958
NONE OF
THE DECEASED'S RELATIVES

17
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,041
THINK IT
WAS AN ACCIDENT.

18
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,333
- ( printing )

19
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,500
( printer beeps )

20
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,166
- SO WHO IS THAT?

21
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,166
- IT'S THE YOUNG
PRESIDENT'S WIDOW,

22
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,166
OUR CLIENT.

23
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,375
- YOU'VE SEEN HER BEFORE?

24
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,750
- YES.

25
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,875
I'D LIKE SOME OF THESE.

26
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,083
- <i>OUI, MADAME.</i>

27
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,375
THE BELLADONNA LILIES,
CORRECT?

28
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,708
- YOU'VE BOUGHT THOSE BEFORE,
HAVEN'T YOU?

29
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,583
- WHY, YES.  YOU REMEMBER
THE STRANGEST THINGS.

30
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,833
- ( gasps )

31
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,416
WE'VE MET BEFORE,
HAVEN'T WE?

32
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,041
- YES, WE HAVE.

33
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,875
A FRIEND OF MINE
IS BURIED HERE. 

34
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,458
- WELL, DO YOU COME OFTEN?

35
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,916
- NO, ONLY OCCASIONALLY.
- AH.

36
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,083
- ACTUALLY, WE WEREN'T
ALL THAT CLOSE.

37
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,291
BUT THEN AGAIN,
AT THE SAME TIME,

38
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,833
I DID SORT OF
CARE ABOUT HIM.

39
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,708
- I SEE.

40
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:42,125
AND DID HE LIKE
BELLADONNA LILIES?

41
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,916
- WELL, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

42
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,541
- YOU SOUND MUCH LIKE ME.

43
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:47,916
- LIKE YOU?

44
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,916
- YES, THE PERSON
I CARED FOR

45
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,250
ALSO LIKED
BELLADONNA LILIES.

46
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,500
I HATED THEM AT FIRST,
YOU KNOW?

47
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:06,458
BECAUSE I HAD HEARD THAT
BELLADONNAS ARE POISONOUS,

48
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:09,791
BUT THEN ONE DAY I LEARNED
THAT BELLADONNA LILIES

49
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,041
ARE OF A COMPLETELY SPECIES.

50
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,541
I SUPPOSE
THAT IN THE END,

51
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,458
IT WOULDN'T HAVE MADE
A DIFFERENCE, THOUGH.

52
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,791
THEY WERE ALWAYS THE FLOWERS
THAT HE LOVED THE MOST.

53
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:18,875
- HMM.

54
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:48,875
- ( guns cock )

55
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,416
- SO WE'RE
GOING TO DO IT?

56
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,791
- YES, WE ARE.

57
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,791
DUX RECENTLY PURCHASED
A RESORT HOTEL.

58
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,666
HE'S STAYING THERE
IN A SUITE

59
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,083
WHILE SUPERVISING ARRANGEMENTS
FOR REMODELING

60
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,333
BEFORE THE HOTEL RE-OPENS.

61
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:20,708
IT'S A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY.

62
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,208
DUX'S SUITE
IS ON THE TOP FLOOR.

63
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,000
THERE ARE THREE ROUTES.

64
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,250
YOU'LL COME IN
USING THE STAIRS

65
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,541
THAT GO TO THE EMERGENCY EXIT,
ALL RIGHT?

66
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,958
- RIGHT.

67
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:47,875
- ( wincing )

68
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,625
- WELL, I MUST SAY
I NEVER THOUGHT

69
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,458
THAT THE GREAT NOIR
WOULD TURN OUT

70
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,958
TO BE A YOUNG LADY
LIKE YOU.

71
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,791
- PLEASE, DROP YOUR WEAPON.

72
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,666
- ( gasps )

73
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,833
SO YOU WERE THE ONE.

74
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,500
- ( gunfire )
- ( gasping )

75
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,125
- ( both gasp )

76
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,500
- ( door opens )

77
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,333
- SEAL OFF THE HOTEL
AT ONCE!

78
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,583
MAKE SURE THEY
HAVE NOWHERE TO RUN.

79
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,041
TO THINK THAT NOIR
WAS TWO PEOPLE.

80
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:17,916
- ( panting )

81
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,125
- ( frustrated sigh )

82
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,375
- I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

83
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:40,000
THIS WHOLE THING
WAS A SETUP,

84
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,791
AND DUX AND OUR CLIENT
WERE IN IT TOGETHER.

85
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,375
IT WOULD SEEM THE TARGET'S NAME
HAS BEEN CHANGED.

86
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,083
- THEY WERE AFTER US
TO START WITH.

87
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,916
THEY'RE AFTER NOIR.

88
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,416
- BUT THAT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

89
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,375
WHY WOULD SOMEONE GO TO
SUCH LENGTHS TO CATCH US?

90
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,625
- THEY'RE PROFESSIONALS,

91
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,666
JUST LIKE US.

92
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,916
SOMEONE MUST BE
PAYING THEM.

93
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,875
- SO YOU THINK
THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE

94
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,916
BEHIND THIS AS WELL?

95
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,916
- YES.

96
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,166
THE HUNTER AND THE HUNTED
HAVE SWITCHED PLACES.

97
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,500
THAT'S ALL.

98
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:23,750
IT DOESN'T ALTER THE FACT

99
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,833
THAT WE'RE DEALING
IN HUMAN LIVES.

100
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,916
- HMPH.  ALL RIGHT.

101
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,875
BUT THEN WHO IS
THE MASTERMIND?

102
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,000
- THE ENEMY.

103
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,000
- YOU MEAN THE ONES
WHO STOLE YOUR MEMORY?

104
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,625
THEY'VE MADE THEIR MOVE.

105
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,666
LET'S MAKE OURS.

106
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:57,958
- ( panting )

107
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,291
( panting )

108
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,708
( men panting )

109
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,166
( running footsteps )

110
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,541
- ( gunshots )
- ( groaning )

111
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,208
- SQUAD "C"?!
SQUAD "C," REPORT.

112
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,041
THEY GOT SQUAD "C" TOO.

113
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,958
IT SEEMS NOIR IS CERTAINLY
LIVING UP TO THEIR REPUTATION.

114
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,791
INITIATE PLAN THREE.

115
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,250
- Man: ( through radio )
THIS IS SQUAD B.

116
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,208
BOTH TARGETS HAVE
ENTERED THE CASINO.

117
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,458
- UNDERSTOOD.

118
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,833
ALL SQUADS REGROUP AND
WAIT FOR INSTRUCTIONS.

119
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,333
- LOOKS LIKE
WE'VE BEEN HERDED HERE.

120
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,375
HMM.

121
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,083
WANT A DRINK?

122
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,541
OR IF YOU PREFER, WE ALSO
HAVE SOME POPCORN.

123
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,583
- Dux: ALL RIGHT, CUT IT.

124
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,750
- I GUESS THEY MEAN 
TO DUKE IT OUT HERE.

125
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,750
- POPCORN.
- HMM?

126
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,750
- I'D THINK I'D LIKE
TO HAVE SOME.

127
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,750
- UH-HUH.

128
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:52,958
- LET'S DO IT.

129
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,625
- ( crunches ) 
- ( gasps ) OH.

130
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,708
- ( gunshot )
- ( yelps )

131
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,166
- ( crunches )
- HUH?

132
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,916
- ( screams )

133
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,250
- ( running footsteps )
- ( gasps )

134
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,708
- WHAA!

135
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,916
- ( gunshot )
- ( grunts ) 

136
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,500
- ( automatic gunfire )

137
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,458
( gunfire continues )

138
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,541
- ( screams )

139
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,041
- ( distant gunfire )

140
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,291
- ( men grunting )

141
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,875
( screaming )

142
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,458
- ( gasps )
- ( gasps )

143
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:04,125
( groaning )

144
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:15,291
THE FIRST TIME WE MET

145
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,000
WAS COINCIDENCE.

146
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,250
- I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT
THAT PEOPLE LIKE US 

147
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,458
SHOULD NEVER VISIT CEMETERIES.

148
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,083
WE JUST SEEM TO FALL
INTO THE GRAVES

149
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,791
AT OUR FEET OURSELVES.

150
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,750
- ALMOST AS IF
THE OTHER SIDE

151
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,708
WAS CALLING US.

152
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,250
- I HAVE TO WONDER

153
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,750
IF THE DEAD
WERE BLINDING US AS WELL.

154
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,375
- ( gasps )
MAYBE SO.

155
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,166
- WHAT ABOUT THAT GRAVE?

156
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,291
- IT'S MY HUSBAND'S.

157
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:47,166
- WHO WAS NOT
THE YOUNG PRESIDENT?

158
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,875
- BUT WHEN I TOLD YOU
THAT HE LIKED THOSE FLOWERS,

159
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,041
THAT MUCH WAS TRUE.

160
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,375
- TELL ME ONE THING.

161
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:00,791
WHO WAS IT THAT HIRED YOU
TO KILL NOIR?

162
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:04,416
- IF YOU WERE ME,
WOULD YOU TELL?

163
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,333
- NO WAY.

164
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,458
- ( laughs )

165
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,833
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- ( gasps )

166
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:18,708
( strains, coughs )

167
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,083
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF ASKING?

168
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,666
NEITHER YOU NOR I
HAVE GRAVES WAITING

169
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,416
ON WHICH
TO COVER OUR NAMES.

170
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,083
( gasping )

171
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,500
NEITHER YOU NOR--

172
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,416
- I DON'T GET IT.

173
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,125
- ( printing )
- THE ENEMY HIRED DUX

174
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,666
AND HIS MEN
TO ELIMINATE NOIR.

175
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,083
BUT DUX HAD NEVER BEEN TOLD
THAT NOIR

176
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,333
WAS YOU AND I.

177
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,791
DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT MAYBE

178
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,958
IT REALLY WAS
SOME KIND OF GAME

179
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:35,125
AND DUX, YOU AND I
WERE NOTHING MORE THAN

180
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,416
PIECES ON THE BOARD?

181
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,583
- I GUESS SO.

182
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:47,041
- NOW WE KNOW THE ENEMY
IS ALWAYS WATCHING.

183
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,541
EVEN NOW THEY'RE WATCHING US
FROM SOMEWHERE...

184
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,583
IN THE SHADOWS.

185
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,833
( sighs )

186
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,541
AND IN THE END,
WE HAVE NO CHOICE,

187
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,708
EXCEPT TO KEEP WINNING
THESE GAMES, RIGHT?

188
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,916
- YES.

189
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,916
AND SOMEDAY...

190
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,458
- NOT HAVING A GRAVE

191
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,750
ISN'T SOMETHING
THAT SADDENS ME...

192
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:48,250
BECAUSE IT IS THE PATH
I CHOSE FOR MYSELF.

193
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:01,083
I KNOW THAT THIS
IS NOT YOUR GRAVE,

194
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,500
BUT SO WHAT?

195
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:25,000
SO WHAT IF THAT'S TRUE?

196
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:01,125
- ( women chanting )
- ( techno music playing )
