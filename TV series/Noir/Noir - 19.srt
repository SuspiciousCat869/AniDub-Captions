1
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,333
- ( men chanting )

2
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:43,083
- Kirika: NOIR--

3
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:46,791
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE--

4
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:50,000
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH.

5
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:52,208
THE PEACE OF
THE NEWLY BORN,

6
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,750
THEIR BLACK HANDS PROTECT.

7
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:03,208
- WELL, THAT'S ONE MORE
LEAD SCRATCHED.

8
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,625
THE ALEXANDER
TRADING COMPANY IS CLEAN.

9
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,416
IF THERE WAS ANYTHING THERE,
THERE'S NO TRACE LEFT.

10
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,625
- ( computer beeps )
- HUH?

11
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,416
- ( double clicks )
- ( beeping )

12
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,125
- AHA.
- "A SINNER

13
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,750
ONCE PASSED AWAY
WILL NEVER RETURN.

14
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,666
HOWEVER, THE SINS 
WILL NEVER VANISH.

15
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,958
AND AS FOR THE LOVE,
IT WILL NEVER DIE.

16
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,750
THE BLOOD OF THE <i>SOLDATS</i>

17
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:36,250
WILL SEEP THROUGHOUT
THE WILDERNESS AND FLOW..."

18
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,500
- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE HOME.

19
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,666
- THE TWO HANDS 
OF THE <i>SOLDATS--</i>

20
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,166
THE TWO HANDS
OF THE <i>SOLDATS?</i>

21
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,375
- HEY, ARE YOU
LISTENING IN THERE?

22
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,583
THIS GUY SAYS HE HAS INFORMATION
REGARDING THAT BOOK.

23
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:56,833
KIRIKA.

24
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,041
KIRIKA?

25
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,416
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

26
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:16,875
- OH, IT'S NOTHING THAT'S 
WORTH MENTIONING, I GUESS.

27
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,791
- ( people chattering )

28
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,125
- THAT EXAM WAS SO HARD.

29
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,166
- ( chattering continues )

30
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,291
- ( Kirika pants )

31
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,375
THERE I GO AGAIN.
- MM-HMM.

32
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,958
PROFESSOR CHATELLE
IS AN AUTHORITY

33
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,000
ON ANCIENT
HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS.

34
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:05,083
I'D ACTUALLY SENT HIM THE VERY
FIRST PHOTOCOPY WE CAME ACROSS,

35
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,666
BUT HE ONLY JUST RESPONDED
TO THAT QUERY.

36
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,083
OF COURSE THIS COULD BE
JUST ANOTHER DEAD END. 

37
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,000
- Professor: THERE'S
NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT.


38
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,583
THIS IS PART OF
THE LANGONEL MANUSCRIPT.


39
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,375
- THE LANGONEL MANUSCRIPT?

40
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,958
- UH-HUH.

41
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:26,041
HERE.
- ( rustling )

42
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,583
( papers rustle )

43
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:29,750
- JUST LOOK AT THIS.

44
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,416
THIS IS A REFERENCE BOOK

45
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,875
OF ARCHAIC DOCUMENTS
FROM THE MIDDLE AGES

46
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,791
WHEREIN ONE OF THE PASSAGES
IN YOUR TEXT

47
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,125
IS QUOTED DIRECTLY.

48
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,666
SEE?
"THE MAN WITHIN THE MAN.


49
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,500
THE LOVE WITHIN THE LOVE.


50
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:45,875
THE SIN WITHIN THE SIN."


51
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,125
- Mireille:
THAT'S IT, ALL RIGHT.


52
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:50,041
- IT'S FROM A MANUSCRIPT
SECRETLY TRANSCRIBED

53
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:53,125
AT THE MONASTERY OF LANGONEL
IN THE 13th CENTURY.

54
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,041
NO EARLIER VERSION
OF THIS TEXT

55
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,416
HAS BEEN FOUND TO DATE.

56
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,083
THAT'S WHY IT IS CALLED 
THE LANGONEL MANUSCRIPT.

57
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,833
HOWEVER, I AM AFRAID

58
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,250
THAT LITTLE ELSE IS KNOWN ABOUT
THIS SECRET BOOK,

59
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,083
EXCEPT THAT IT'S VERY OLD.

60
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,916
BUT TO HAVE LAID MY EYES

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,916
ON EVEN A COPY OF
THE LANGONEL MANUSCRIPT,

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,750
WELL, LET'S SAY I WAS
QUITE SURPRISED.

63
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,541
- ARE THERE COPIES?

64
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,250
I MEAN, ONES WE COULD READ?

65
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,583
- HMM, AT ONE TIME,
THERE WERE TWO.

66
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,916
IN PARIS AND BERLIN.

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,250
UNFORTUNATELY, BOTH WERE
LOST IN FIRES DURING THE WAR.

68
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,041
- FIRES.

69
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:30,250
- BUT THE FACT THAT
YOU HAVE THIS PHOTOCOPY

70
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,916
PROVES THAT ANOTHER COPY
MUST EXIST SOMEWHERE.

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
PERHAPS IT IS EVEN THE ONE

72
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:38,250
FROM WHICH THE LANGONEL 
VERSION WAS TRANSCRIBED.

73
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,458
- ( printing )

74
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,458
( printing continues )

75
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,125
- ( sighs )

76
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,500
- ( clock tower chimes )

77
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,083
- ( sighs )

78
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,791
- ( clicking )

79
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,125
I FOUND ONE!

80
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:33,500
CASPER EDLINGER,
AN AUSTRIAN MULTI-MILLIONAIRE.


81
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,500
THIS IS IT.

82
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,666
( mutters sleepily )

83
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,708
THANK YOU.
- HUH?

84
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,166
YOU CAN'T SLEEP EITHER?

85
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,750
- YOU MEAN WHEN WE'VE
FINALLY GOTTEN THIS FAR?

86
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,666
- MM-HMM.

87
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,583
- IT'S IN VIENNA,

88
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,833
THE BOOK THAT COULD
HOLD ALL OF THE CLUES

89
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,208
THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.

90
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:27,375
- AND SOON--

91
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,708
SOON THE TWO OF US
WILL BE THERE,

92
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,750
OPENING THE DOOR
TO OUR PAST.

93
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,833
- KIRIKA?
- HMM?

94
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,000
- THERE WAS A PROMISE
THAT WE MADE.

95
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,375
- I REMEMBER.

96
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,291
- WHEN EVERYTHING
BECOMES CLEAR,

97
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,833
I PROMISED THAT
I WOULD KILL YOU.

98
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,166
- THOSE TWO MUST 
BE TAKEN CARE OF.

99
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,250
I MEAN CERTAIN DEATH,
NOT THESE RIDICULOUS TRIALS.

100
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,000
- ( frustrated groan )

101
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,333
IT SEEMS THAT'S 
THE ONLY CHOICE.

102
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,583
- I WOULD HAVE LIKED
TO DRAW THOSE TWO

103
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,833
INTO OUR FOLD IF POSSIBLE.

104
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,875
- IT CANNOT BE HELPED.

105
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:25,250
ALTENA'S INFLUENCE HAS GROWN
MUCH FASTER THAN EXPECTED.

106
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,208
- HMM.

107
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:33,041
WE WILL DISPATCH
OUR BEST KNIGHTS THIS TIME,

108
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:36,375
BUT THE PRETEXT WILL REMAIN
THAT IT IS A TRIAL.

109
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,750
- AND SINCE THE SANCTIONS
FOR THE TRIAL

110
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,416
HAVE ALREADY BEEN APPROVED,

111
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,458
THEY'LL BE NO PROBLEM.

112
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,250
- IF THAT'S TO BE THE CASE,

113
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,333
SHOULD THE SANCTIONS
APPLY TO CHLOE AS WELL?

114
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,333
- YES, OF COURSE.

115
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,916
- Old man: IT WAS JUST
TWO YEARS AGO

116
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,541
THAT THE EDLINGER
FAMILY LIBRARY

117
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,708
BURNED TO THE GROUND

118
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,666
ALONG WITH
THE ENTIRE COLLECTION.

119
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,375
- I AM AFRAID THAT
THE LANGONEL MANUSCRIPT

120
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,625
WAS LOST AS WELL.

121
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,666
EVERYTHING OF VALUE
WAS DESTROYED.

122
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,458
SO WE LEFT THE BURNT REMAINS
WHERE THEY LAY.

123
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,625
GO AND SEARCH IF YOU WANT.

124
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,875
BUT NOW NOT A SINGLE COPY

125
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:35,000
OF THE LANGONEL MANUSCRIPT
EXISTS ON THIS EARTH,

126
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,375
NOT UNLESS
IT IS IN A PLACE

127
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,958
THAT HAS BEEN
FORGOTTEN BY TIME.

128
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,166
- SO AFTER ALL OF THAT,
ALL WE FOUND

129
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,583
IS A PILE OF ASHES
AND BROKEN RUBBLE.

130
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,541
THE BOOK THAT WE CAME FOR
NO LONGER EXISTS.

131
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,041
SO DOES THAT MEAN
ALL THOSE COPIES 

132
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,750
WERE MADE BEFORE THE FIRE?

133
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,833
- Chloe: "A SINNER
ONCE PASSED AWAY

134
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,708
WILL NEVER RETURN,

135
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,000
BUT THE SINS
WILL NEVER VANISH

136
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,458
AND THE LOVE
WILL NEVER DIE.

137
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,791
THE HERMIT ALSO SPOKE THUS."

138
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,416
- CHLOE.

139
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,541
- "THE BLOOD OF
THE <i>SOLDATS</i> WILL SEEP.

140
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,708
IT WILL SEEP THROUGHOUT
THE WILDERNESS

141
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,208
AND FLOW INTO THE--" WHAT?

142
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,916
GREAT RIVER?
- WHY, YOU--

143
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,416
- BUT I BELIEVE
YOU KNOW THAT MUCH.

144
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,458
THE REST OF IT
GOES AS FOLLOWS:

145
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,166
"THE TWO HANDS 
OF THE <i>SOLDATS</i>

146
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,791
ARE TWO MAIDENS,
BLACKER THAN BLACK,

147
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,541
BURDENED BY SIN,

148
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,666
REACHING OUT WITH MERCY.

149
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,958
NOIR.

150
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,416
THAT'S RIGHT.

151
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,250
THE TITLE OF NOIR HAS ALWAYS
BELONGED TO THE <i>SOLDATS.</i>

152
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,666
- ( gasps )

153
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,875
- ( gasps )

154
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:14,291
- THAT IS THE TRUE NOIR.
TWO SUPREME BLADES

155
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,958
THAT, TOGETHER,
MAKE UP A SINGLE ENTITY,

156
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,291
THE <i>SOLDATS</i> TWO HANDS.

157
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,416
HOWEVER,
KNOWLEDGE OF THE RITUAL

158
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,708
OF ACCESSION TO NOIR WAS LOST
IN THE PASSAGE OF TIME,

159
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:28,166
UNTIL ONLY THE TERROR ELICITED
BY THAT NAME REMAINED.

160
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,916
AND IN THE YEARS SINCE,

161
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,208
COUNTLESS OUTLAWS HAVE
CLAIMED THE NAME NOIR.

162
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,500
MANY NOT EVEN KNOWING
ITS TRUE MEANING.

163
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,833
- I CHOSE THE NAME NOIR

164
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,833
TO HIDE THE FACT THAT
KIRIKA AND I WERE A TEAM,

165
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,125
BUT NOW YOU'RE SAYING

166
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:02,083
NOIR WAS A NAME FOR
A GROUP OF TWO ALL ALONG?

167
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,166
- ( sighs ) YES.

168
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,208
- THEN IT SEEMS THAT
THE THREAD THAT BINDS US

169
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:11,083
MUST BE AN ESPECIALLY
TWISTED ONE.

170
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:14,083
HOW ELSE TO EXPLAIN
SUCH A CHAIN OF CHANCE,

171
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,625
UNLESS THESE
UNTANGLING THREADS

172
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,041
ARE THE BLACK WEB
OF FATE ITSELF?

173
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,458
- ( running footsteps )
- ( grunts )

174
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:45,333
- SO EXACTLY WHY ARE
YOU TELLING US THIS?

175
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:48,416
- LET US FEED THE SAPLINGS
WITH WATER AND LIGHT,

176
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,833
BUT ONLY WHEN ALTENA
DESIRES IT TO BE SO.

177
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,333
- HMPH, THIS ALTENA--

178
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,750
SHE'S THE ONE WHO HOLDS
YOUR LEASH, RIGHT?

179
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,916
- ALTENA IS STRICT, 
BUT A KIND MISTRESS.

180
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,041
SHE HAS BEEN ANXIOUSLY WAITING
FOR THE TWO OF YOU

181
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,791
TO OVERCOME THE TRIALS
THAT HAVE BEEN SENT.

182
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,166
- TRIALS.

183
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,416
- YES, FOR THAT IS THE FATE

184
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,291
OF THOSE WHO ARE
TO BE NOIR.

185
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:17,166
- THAT'S THE FATE OF 
THOSE WHO'LL BE NOIR?

186
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,958
- RIGHT.

187
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,375
- IT WOULD APPEAR THAT YOU'RE
NOW BEING TARGETED AS WELL.

188
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,916
- BATTLES AGAINST
ABLE-BODIED KNIGHTS,

189
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,166
THE SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION

190
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,750
OF THE ASSIGNED TASKS
AND MISSIONS,

191
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:49,583
AND TRAPS LIKE
A SPIDER'S WEB--

192
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,583
ALL OF THESE ARE TRIALS

193
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:55,583
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ANCIENT
RITUAL OF SELECTING NOIR.

194
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,125
- AND WHAT IS-- OH!

195
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,208
- ( blades slashing )
- ( gags )

196
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,958
- ( gunfire continues )

197
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,166
- OH!

198
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,750
( groans )

199
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,458
- ( chuckles )

200
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,000
- ( gasps )

201
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,166
- ( gunshot )

202
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,375
( gunshot )

203
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,208
- KIRIKA.

204
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,541
- ( gunshot echoes )
- IS THIS REALLY KIRIKA'S PAST?

205
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:36,708
COULD IT BE TRUE?

206
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:40,083
- Chloe: YOU KILL PEOPLE
SO EASILY

207
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:44,250
WITHOUT ANY HESITATION
OR REMORSE.

208
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:47,083
- ( blade slashes )
- ( man screams )

209
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,958
- ( chuckles )

210
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:36,083
YOU AND I
ARE THE TRUE NOIR,

211
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:39,750
BORN AND RAISED
IN THE NEST OF THE <i>SOLDATS.</i>

212
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:43,958
THE TWO OF US EXHIBITED THE
GREATEST APTITUDE AS ASSASSINS.

213
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,291
- ( gasps )

214
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,125
- ( gasps )

215
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,666
- THE <i>SOLDATS</i>
AREN'T YOUR ENEMY.

216
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,375
THE <i>SOLDATS</i> IS
THE PLACE YOU BELONG.

217
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,375
- ( gasps )

218
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,833
- YOU LOST YOUR MEMORIES,
BUT THINK.

219
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:07,583
WHY ELSE WOULD IT BE
THAT YOU WOULD LOOK AT ME SO?

220
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,625
- NO.  STOP.

221
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,750
- DO NOT WORRY.

222
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,541
YOU DO REMEMBER EVERYTHING...

223
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:20,541
BOTH AS A NOIR
AND AS AN ASSASSIN.

224
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,291
- DON'T SAY IT.

225
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:28,041
- YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH
YOUR TASK SO EASILY.

226
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,208
- PLEASE, STOP IT.

227
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,041
STOP TALKING.

228
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,958
- BECAUSE, EVER SINCE
YOU WERE A CHILD--

229
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,000
- LEAVE ME ALONE!

230
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,250
- ( gasps )

231
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:38,000
- NOIR, IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE--

232
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,208
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH.

233
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,666
TO THE DEPTHS OF HELL'S FIRE,

234
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,000
THEIR BLACK SOULS LURE
THE LOST CHILDREN.

235
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,083
- NOIR, IT IS THE NAME OF
AN ANCIENT FATE...

236
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,541
- Both: TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH.

237
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:05,708
THE PEACE OF THE NEWLY BORN,
THEIR BLACK HANDS PROTECT.

238
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,375
IT IS THE NAME OF
AN ANCIENT FATE--

239
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,833
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH.

240
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:14,708
THE PEACE OF THE NEWLY BORN,
THEIR BLACK HANDS PROTECT.

241
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,666
( continues )
- NO, KIRIKA.

242
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,750
KIRIKA!

243
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,625
- ( gasps )

244
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,916
AM I--

245
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,708
AM I...

246
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:08,041
- I WILL RETURN
IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

247
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,625
JUST ONE TIME MORE,
I PROMISE.

248
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:15,833
AND I WILL GIVE YOU YOUR
FINAL GUIDANCE TO THE MANOR.

249
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,000
- "THE HERMIT ALSO SPOKE THUS.

250
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,083
THE BLOOD OF THE <i>SOLDATS</i>

251
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,291
WILL SEEP THROUGHOUT
THE WILDERNESS

252
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,958
AND FLOW INTO
THE GREAT RIVER.

253
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:34,791
THE TWO HANDS OF THE <i>SOLDATS</i>
ARE TWO MAIDENS.

254
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,291
BLACKER THAN BLACK,

255
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,708
BURDENED BY SIN,

256
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,250
REACHING OUT WITH MERCY,

257
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,416
THEY ARE NOIR.

258
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,625
- I KNEW.

259
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:17,791
I DID.

260
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,416
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

261
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:24,333
BUT I JUST...

262
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,833
- ( inaudible )

263
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:32,041
- Kirika:
I JUST WANTED TO BELIEVE

264
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:36,125
THAT A NORMAL ME
EXISTED SOMEWHERE.

265
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,041
THAT WAS ALL.

266
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,958
THAT'S ALL IT WAS.

267
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,875
I DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW.

268
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,291
BUT I KNOW NOW.

269
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,166
PLEASE, MIREILLE.

270
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:11,208
PLEASE DON'T LOOK
AT ME LIKE THAT. 

271
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:01,708
- ( techno music playing )
- ( women chanting )
