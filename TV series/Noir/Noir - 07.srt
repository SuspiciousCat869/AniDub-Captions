1
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,625
- ( voices chanting )

2
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:43,500
- Kirika: NOIR...

3
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,500
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE--

4
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:50,125
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH.

5
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:52,708
THE PEACE
OF THE NEWLY BORN

6
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:55,000
THEIR BLACK HANDS PROTECT.

7
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:01,208
- ( women singing in Latin )

8
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:23,250
- GO ON, MIREILLE. DO IT.

9
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:29,208
THANK YOU
FOR PUTTING UP WITH ME.

10
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,125
- ( ragged breathing )

11
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,458
- Man: BALSAN IS DEAD.

12
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:13,041
MURDERED!
SLAIN IN HIS BED.

13
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:16,666
BALSAN THE GREAT REVOLUTIONARY

14
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,833
KILLED BY THE ASSASSIN
THAT YOU HIRED!

15
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:22,083
HOW COULD YOU KILL THE GLORIOUS
LEADER OF OUR CAUSE?

16
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,791
AND WHO DID YOU GET TO DO IT?
- HMMM.

17
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,291
- ( growls )

18
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,333
- ( man grunts, body thuds )
- TALK!

19
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:33,125
I'LL KEEP KILLING THEM
UNTIL YOU GIVE ME A NAME.

20
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,208
- NOIR.

21
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,291
- ( gasps )
- A NAME ON THE HIGHEST LIST

22
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:51,000
OF ALL ASSASSINS. THE DEATH
THAT COMES IN THE NIGHT.

23
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:54,791
BUT THAT IS ALL WE KNOW,
THE NAME AND NOTHING MORE.

24
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,500
- NOIR?

25
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:02,041
- BUT NOIR IS
THE SERVANT OF GOD.

26
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:06,291
YOU HAVE DEFILED THIS LAND WITH
BLOOD IN THE NAME OF REVOLUTION

27
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,625
AND BALSAN HAS PAID
THE PRICE!

28
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,291
- ( growls )

29
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,416

30
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,708
- ( ragged breathing )

31
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,708
( whimpers )

32
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,208
- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WALK
ONCE WE PASS THE RIVER.

33
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,875
JUST HOW DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
GOING TO MAKE IT LIKE THAT?

34
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,458
IF WE DON'T CROSS
THE ARAMERA BY 4:00,

35
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,666
OUR CHOPPER IS GOING
TO LEAVE WITHOUT US.

36
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:47,083
BEING A PRO IS MORE THAN JUST
BRINGING DOWN YOUR TARGET.

37
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,833
MAKING A CLEAN GETAWAY IS
THE MARK OF A PROFESSIONAL.

38
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,916
YOU KNOW THAT AS WELL AS--

39
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,916
( gasps )
- ( chiming )

40
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,666
- ( sighs )

41
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,750
- ( whimpering )

42
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:05,416
- ARE YOU--
- NO, I'M FINE.

43
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,125
- STILL, ON THE BRIGHTER SIDE,

44
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,208
IF YOU HAD BEEN KILLED, AT LEAST
I WOULD HAVE BEEN FREE OF YOU.

45
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,791
- THAT'S TRUE.

46
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:18,625
- ( woman singing in bathroom )

47
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,791
- ( silenced gunshots )

48
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,083
- ( singing stops )

49
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,833
- ( gunshots )

50
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:53,791
- ( moans )

51
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,583
- YES, I'VE HEARD OF THIS NOIR.

52
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,083
- WHEN YOU WERE WORKING
UNDERGROUND IN PAKISTAN, HUH?

53
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:04,666
- YEAH, THEY SAY HE'S SCARIER
THAN THE GRIM REAPER.

54
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,791
- HMM?

55
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,000
( groans )

56
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,041
THE REAPER?

57
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:14,083
DEATH HIMSELF.
I SEE.

58
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,500
THEN SO BE IT.
I'LL FIND THIS NOIR

59
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,541
AND PUT HIM THROUGH
THE TORTURES OF HELL!

60
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,208
WE'LL DRAG THIS REAPER
INTO THE DESERT SUN

61
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,333
AND STAKE HIM OUT TO DIE!

62
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,750
- ( panting )

63
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,541
- MIREILLE,
MY I.D. CARD.

64
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,875
- HUH?
- I THINK I LOST MY I.D.

65
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,375
WHEN I GOT SHOT.

66
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,750
- WHAT?
- I KNOW IT WAS STUPID.

67
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,875
BUT I COULDN'T
THROW IT AWAY

68
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:11,166
EVEN THOUGH I KNEW

69
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,375
IT WASN'T REAL,

70
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,875
THAT IT WASN'T THE REAL ME

71
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,375
OR ANYTHING. I...

72
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,833
- JUST BE QUIET.
- ( grunts )

73
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,916
- THIS ISN'T THE TIME
FOR THAT NOW.

74
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:37,291
- Kirika: WHEN I CAME TO,
I WAS IN THIS PLACE.

75
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,583
MY NAME AND ALL MY RECORDS,

76
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,250
ARE LIES.

77
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,416
WHO AM I?

78
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,791
WHAT I AM IS NOIR.

79
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,625
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
BEYOND THAT.

80
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,291
BUT THIS...

81
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:01,791
EVEN IF IT IS A LIE,
IT WAS IN MY HANDS.

82
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,291
IT BELONGED TO ME.

83
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,083
- ( water trickling )

84
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,916
- ( thinking ) I MIGHT
STILL BE ABLE TO MAKE IT...

85
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,375
IF I GO ALONE.

86
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,541
- Soldiers: DID ANYONE
SEE ANYTHING?!

87
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,500
- HURRY UP AND OPEN THE DOOR!

88
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,583
SHOW US YOUR I.D.! DO IT!
- PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR.

89
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,833
- OPEN THE TRUNK!
- ( shouting )

90
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:30,083
- GO ON, MIREILLE.
DO IT.

91
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:37,625
THANK YOU
FOR PUTTING UP WITH ME.

92
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,375
- ( music-box melody playing )
- ( ragged breathing )

93
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,750
- NOW. HURRY.

94
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,875
( inhales )

95
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,125
- ( silenced gunshot )

96
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,333
- ( melody continues )

97
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,541
- DID YOU REALLY THINK

98
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,375
I'D LET YOU TAKE
THE EASY WAY OUT?

99
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,416
NOT THAT I COULDN'T
CARE LESS ABOUT YOU

100
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,708
OR WHO YOU REALLY ARE,

101
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:54,125
BUT YOU'RE MY KEY
TO FINDING THE SOLDATS.

102
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:57,083
SO UNTIL I FIND OUT
WHO THEY ARE,

103
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,625
I'M NOT GOING
TO LET YOU DIE.

104
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,958
BUT ONCE I'VE FOUND THEM OUT...

105
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,625
I WILL KILL YOU.

106
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,416
- I'D FORGOTTEN.

107
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,000
- HEY, LOOK AT THIS!
- DID YOU FIND SOMETHING?

108
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,250
- WHAT IS IT?

109
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,125
- ( phone ringing )

110
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,083
- ( laughs )

111
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,625
- ( laughs )

112
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,625
- HMM?

113
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,125
( gasps )

114
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,333
- ( men scream, grunt )

115
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,208
- WE'VE GOT HIM!

116
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,250
- IT'S A GIRL.

117
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,208
- IT'S HER, LOOK AT THE WOUND.

118
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,041
- BUT SHE'S JUST A KID!

119
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,041
- HUH?

120
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,000
WHAT'S THIS?

121
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,583
- ( whimpers )

122
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,333
- TAKE HER TO IZUDDIN.

123
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,041
- YES, IT WILL BE DONE, SIR!

124
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:26,208
- DAMN, SHE'S HEAVY.
- ( engine starts )

125
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,791
- ( grunts )
- GET IN THERE, YOU!

126
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:41,333
- ( music-box melody playing )

127
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,500
- ( ticking )

128
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,708
- ( ticking echoes )

129
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:19,125
- ( melody continuing )

130
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,541
- Kirika's voice:
A PILGRIMAGE

131
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:00,541
TO YOUR PAST AND MINE.

132
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,583
- ( melody stops )

133
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,166
- CAN'T YOU SEE?

134
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,208
THEY'RE NOT SPENDING
THEIR MONEY RIGHT.

135
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:11,125
- WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG WITH OUR
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM?

136
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:14,375
- I'LL TELL YOU-- MY GIRLFRIEND,
SHE HAS THIS CELLPHONE.

137
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,416
- A CELLPHONE?
- YES.

138
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,916
AND IT'S REALLY GOOD TOO.

139
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,250
A LOT BETTER THAN HQ'S.

140
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,916
- ( both grunt )

141
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,041
- HMM.

142
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,250
- ( engine starts )

143
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:46,125
- ( choir singing in Latin )

144
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,583
- IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE--

145
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,666
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH.

146
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,666
TO THE DEPTHS
OF HELL'S FIRE,

147
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,250
THEIR BLACK SOULS
LURE THE LOST CHILDREN.

148
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,958
- ( flames crackling )

149
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,291
- THIS IS THE REAPER?

150
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:34,291
- OH, SHE IS CONNECTED TO NOIR.
THERE IS NO DOUBT.

151
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,791
- WHAT, THIS LITTLE GIRL?!

152
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:40,125
- I AM SURE. SHE REEKS
OF THE SCENT OF DEATH.

153
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,791
- ( footsteps )

154
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,291
( gasps )
IT'S HER!

155
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,416
- WHAT IS THAT?

156
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,458
- I FOUND IT
IN THE EAST CORRIDOR.

157
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,833
IT'S YOUR PICTURE I.D.

158
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,916
YUMURA KIRIKA.

159
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,041
I HAD THE TEXT
ON THE CARD TRANSLATED.

160
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:11,083
SO IS THAT YOUR REAL NAME
OR AN ALIAS?

161
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,375
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU ANSWER?

162
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,250
ARE YOU AN ASSOCIATE OF NOIR?

163
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:22,041
- YOU ARE BRAVE,
BUT YOU'LL CONFESS.

164
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:26,250
YOU'LL CONFESS AS YOU ROAST
IN THE FIRES OF HELL ITSELF.

165
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:29,791
( chuckles )

166
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,666
( stomps )
- ( yelps )

167
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,791
- SO THAT CARD'S
PRECIOUS TO YOU, IS IT?

168
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:38,375
HUH? YOU FILTHY
BASTARDS KILLED HIM.

169
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,000
OUR GREATEST LEADER--
THE GREAT BALSAN!

170
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,333
( blows striking )
SICK DEMON!

171
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,666
- ( Kirika moaning )
- I'LL MAKE YOU PAY

172
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,541
FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE!

173
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,666
- ( groans )

174
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,791
- ( gunshot )
- ( groans)

175
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,375
- NO, THERE'S NOTHING
UNUSUAL OVER HERE.

176
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:01,541
- HUH?
- HUH?

177
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,041
- ( sultry ) HI!

178
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,541
- IS SHE DEAD?

179
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,083
- DON'T BE A FOOL.

180
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,208
I WON'T GIVE HER
THE RELEASE OF DEATH

181
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,875
UNTIL THE BURNING SAND
CONSUMES HER.

182
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,041
- AND WHAT ABOUT HER FRIEND?

183
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:28,083
- THE FRIEND WAS SPOTTED
IN TOWN AT 17:30.

184
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,083
THERE'S A SQUAD ON THE WAY.

185
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,500
- LET ME CHECK.

186
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,625
- ( phone ringing )

187
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,708
- ( groans )
- WHAT'S WRONG?

188
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,666
- NO ONE'S ANSWERING.
- EH?

189
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,125
- ( cocks )

190
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,625
- ( growls )

191
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,875
- HUH?

192
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,375
- ( gasps )
- COULD IT BE GOVERNMENT TROOPS?

193
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,541
- THERE'S NO WAY!
OUR INFORMANT IN THE ARMY

194
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,250
WOULD HAVE ALERTED US.
- LET'S GET UP THERE.

195
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,500
- NOIR...

196
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,833
NOI...

197
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,333
NOI...

198
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,083
- HMM?

199
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,833
- ( groans )

200
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,791
- ( hyperventilating )

201
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,416
( yelps )

202
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,833
( grunts )
- ( gunshot )

203
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,541
- ( wheezing )

204
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,291
- A LITTLE SECRET--

205
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,125
THE CODENAME NOIR
REFERS TO MORE THAN ONE.

206
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,666
- NOIR...

207
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,708
- YES, AN ASSASSIN UNIT
MADE OF TWO.

208
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,625
( casing bounces )

209
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,625
- NOIR...

210
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,708
IT IS...

211
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,125
THE NAME OF...

212
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,291
TWO...

213
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,166
- WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?

214
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,166
- NOIR...

215
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,625
IT IS THE NAME

216
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,416
OF AN ANCIENT FATE--

217
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,708
TWO MAIDENS

218
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,291
WHO GOVERN DEATH.
- WHAT IS SHE SAYING?

219
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,250
A PRAYER?
- THE PEACE OF THE NEWLY BORN

220
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,375
THEIR BLACK HANDS

221
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,916
PROTECT.

222
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,250
- ( whimpering )

223
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,208
- HMPH.

224
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,291
- IN THE END, A LIE IS

225
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,500
ALWAYS A LIE.

226
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,375
I THOUGHT I KNEW THAT
FROM THE BEGINNING, BUT--

227
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,416
( moans )

228
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,041
MIREILLE...
- HUH?

229
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,458
- WHO AM I?

230
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,791
- ( women singing in Latin )

231
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,625
- ( Mireille thinking )
THE THREAD THAT BINDS YOU AND I

232
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:56,125
IS THE COLOR BLACK.
OF THIS I'M SURE.

233
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,708
BLACKER THAN PITCH,
BLACKER THAN NIGHT,

234
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:05,708
BLACKER THAN
THE DARKNESS ITSELF.

235
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,791
- ( women singing )

236
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,125
- ( airplane approaching )

237
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,041
- ( woman singing )
