1
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:40,750
- ( people chanting )

2
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,625
- Kirika: NOIR.

3
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:46,125
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE,

4
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:49,291
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH.

5
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,875
THE PEACE
OF THE NEWLY BORN,

6
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,500
THEIR BLACK HANDS PROTECT.

7
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:59,083
- ( cawing )
- ( waves lapping )

8
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:10,875
- ( sniffs )

9
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:12,208
( sighs )

10
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,750
- ( sniffs )

11
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,791
- Mireille:
THE INVIOLATE ONE,

12
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,541
THE INTOCCABILE,

13
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,750
THE BRUTAL PRINCESS.

14
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,083
- Silvana: I KNOW...

15
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,708
NO FEAR.

16
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,500
- Mireille:
I CAN'T WIN AGAINST HER.

17
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,791
NOT AGAINST HER.

18
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,583
- ( distant gunfire )

19
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,166
- ( clicks )

20
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,166
- ( groans )

21
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,000
- ( sighs )

22
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,166
- ( gun rattling )

23
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,958
- ( gun rattling )

24
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,041
- ( humphs )

25
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,541
- ( gunshots )
- ( bullets whizzing )

26
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,083
- ( sighs )

27
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:23,000
- LADY SILVANA,
WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU.

28
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:27,083
FRANCESCO WILL REST IN PEACE
MORE EASILY IN SICILIAN SOIL.

29
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,083
- BUT WHY ARE WE GOING
TO SICILY WITH HIM?

30
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,083
- I NEED TO LEARN SOMETHING.

31
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,041
- YOU MEAN
ABOUT THAT CONTRACT?

32
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,875
- AND ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

33
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,875
WE WILL SETTLE
THIS MATTER IN SICILY.

34
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,500
- MIREILLE?

35
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,083
I WAS THINKING:
IF SILVANA SAW YOUR FACE--

36
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,208
- I TOLD YOU...

37
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,791
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE DID.

38
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,916
BUT IF I WAS SEEN,

39
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,291
THEN THE ENEMY SHOULD HAVE
ACTED AS EXPECTED.

40
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,041
- ( rustling )

41
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,833
- GOING TO SICILY
RIGHT NOW, IT--

42
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,875
IT COULD BE DANGEROUS.

43
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:06,833
IT'S AS IF...

44
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,666
- JUST HURRY UP
AND PACK, OKAY?

45
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:14,791
- ( sighs )

46
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,708
- ( loud bang )

47
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,416
- ( birds chirping )

48
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,166
- MMM.

49
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,958
- Paolo: LADY SILVANA.

50
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,500
FATHER BELLONI IS WAITING
FOR YOU IN THE CHURCH COURTYARD.

51
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,458
- ( bells tolling )

52
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,416
- HMM. IF THAT FOOL RIZZO HAD
THIS DOCUMENT IN HIS POSSESSION,

53
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,125
THEN HE MUST'VE STOLEN IT
FROM DON LUCIO.

54
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:55,333
THE SIGNATURES ARE THOSE
OF THE FIRST DON GREONE

55
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,916
AND THE MESSINA,
A NOBLE FAMILY OF PALERMO.

56
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,458
THIS CONTRACT WAS DRAWN UP
TO TRANSFER STEWARDSHIP

57
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:06,208
OF THIS LAND FROM THE FEUDAL
LORD TO THE GREONE FAMILY.

58
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:10,083
IT IS VALUABLE SIMPLY DUE
TO ITS AGE, OF COURSE,

59
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,833
HOWEVER, ITS TRUE VALUE
IS MUCH GREATER.

60
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,791
- IF I RECALL CORRECTLY,

61
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,458
THE LORD HAS SAID NEVER TO TURN
ONE'S BACK UPON THE TRUTH.

62
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:19,583
- MMM.

63
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,208
THIS CONTRACT

64
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:26,083
IS DATED
SEPTEMBER 9th, 1791--

65
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,958
A MOST IMPORTANT DATE.

66
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,625
IT IS IMPORTANT, YOU SEE,

67
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:30,958
FOR WITH THIS CONTRACT,

68
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,625
THE FEUDAL LORD ENTRUSTED
THE CARE OF HIS HOLDINGS

69
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,458
TO THE STEWARD OF THE LAND.

70
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,750
IN ESSENCE,
IT MARKED THE END

71
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,291
OF ALL DIRECT INTEREST
THE NOBLES WOULD HAVE

72
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,041
ON THE FUTURE LIVES
OF THEIR SERFS.

73
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:45,333
MAKING THE STEWARD
THE TRUE MASTER OF THE DOMAIN.

74
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,208
THIS WAS THE ORIGIN

75
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,375
OF WHAT WOULD COME
TO BE KNOWN AS THE MAFIA,

76
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,958
THE COSA NOSTRA.

77
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:55,166
IT IS IMPORTANT, BECAUSE WHILE
MANY SUCH CONTRACTS WERE DRAWN,

78
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,625
THE DATE ON THIS DOCUMENT
IS PROOF

79
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,083
THAT THE GREONE FAMILY'S
CONTRACT IS, IN FACT,

80
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,750
ONE OF THE OLDEST
IN ALL EUROPE.

81
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,166
- Domenic:
I JUST DON'T GET IT.

82
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,166
EVEN IF IT DOES MARK THE
ORIGIN OF THE COSA NOSTRA,

83
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,750
WHY IN THE HELL WOULD
SOMEONE LIKE NOIR WANT IT?

84
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,875
- THE COSA NOSTRA
IS 200 YEARS OLD,

85
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,083
BUT THE RUMORS
I HAVE BEEN HEARING

86
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:22,166
INDICATE THAT THIS NOIR
MAY BE EVEN OLDER THAN THAT.

87
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:27,541
NOIR'S SHADOW HAS DARKENED
EUROPE FOR A THOUSAND YEARS.

88
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:29,666
- HMM.

89
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,541
INTERESTING.

90
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,541
- ( girls laughing )

91
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,708
- ( giggles )

92
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,000
- ( both laugh )

93
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,625
- I, SILVANA GREONE,

94
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,250
DO HEREBY BESTOW THIS CROWN

95
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:02,416
UPON THE DAUGHTER OF
A CORSICAN FAMILY.

96
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,041
- AND I...
( giggles )

97
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:13,458
GIVE THIS CROWN TO A DAUGHTER
OF A SICILIAN FAMILY, TOO.

98
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,625
- I THANK YOU.

99
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,083
- ( sniffs )

100
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,625
( sighs )

101
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,791
- ( sniffs )

102
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,208
- ( wind blowing )

103
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,125
- ( waves crashing )

104
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,166
- ( exhales sharply )

105
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:56,833
( whispers ) SCARY.

106
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:01,291
- I BESTOWED A CROWN
UPON YOU, MIREILLE.

107
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:05,791
YOU MUST HAVE COURAGE
THAT IS WORTHY OF THAT HONOR.

108
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,500
- SILVANA?

109
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,416
- THERE IS NO FEAR IN MY HEART.

110
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,000
IS THERE FEAR
IN YOURS, MIREILLE?

111
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,500
- ( gasps )

112
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,041
- IS THERE FEAR, MIREILLE?

113
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,916
- ( crying )

114
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,500
( whimpering )

115
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:36,708
- ( blade zings )

116
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,000
- ( gasps, whimpers )

117
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,666
- MIREILLE?

118
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:59,250
- GO BACK TO THE HOTEL, OKAY?

119
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,333
- ALL RIGHT THEN.

120
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,958
- ( sighs )

121
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,416
- Silvana:
I KNEW YOU WOULD COME HERE.

122
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,708
- ( gasps )

123
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,583
- THE DAUGHTER OF CORSICA,

124
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,708
MIREILLE BOUQUET.

125
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,916
- SO YOU... DID SEE ME.

126
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,750
- "THE LIGHT OF THE MOON
IS MERCILESS

127
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,208
AND EXPOSES
THOSE WHO WOULD HIDE."

128
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:12,333
- BUT HOW COULD YOU REMEMBER
ME AFTER ALL THIS TIME?

129
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:16,916
HOW COULD YOU WHEN WE'VE ONLY
MET ONE TIME BEFORE THIS?

130
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
- AND THE LAST TIME WE MET,

131
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,458
YOU WERE TREMBLING
LIKE THIS AS WELL.

132
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,375
- ( crying )

133
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,666
- AND NOW YOU STAND BEFORE ME

134
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,375
AS THE BLADE
KNOWN BY THE NAME NOIR.

135
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,583
- ( gasps )
- ( moans )

136
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,541
- ( whimpers )

137
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,958
( grunts )

138
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,375
THAT WAS THE...

139
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,875
- AND I SEE
YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

140
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,250
AT NOON TOMORROW,
I WILL BE WAITING

141
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,541
AT THE TEMPLE OF LIBAEO...
WITH THE CONTRACT.

142
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,166
- YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO GO BACK WITHOUT ME.

143
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,208
- ( rustles )

144
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,583
- WAS THAT...

145
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,708
THE INTOCCABILE?

146
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,125
- ( rock music plays )

147
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,166
- ( wind blowing )

148
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,083
( waves crashing )

149
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,041
- LADY SILVANA,
ISN'T THIS THE PLACE--

150
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,333
- YES.  IT WAS HERE

151
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:04,958
ON THIS SPOT THAT I SLEW
MY FATHER FIVE YEARS AGO.

152
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,708
- ( chuckles )
INTOCCABILE.

153
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,916
- AND BLOOD
SHALL CALL TO BLOOD.

154
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,750
- ( sighs )

155
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:32,166
- ( rock music playing )

156
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,083
- AH.

157
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,166
( women singing )

158
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,875
- ( pants )

159
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,041

00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,958
- ( gunfire continues )

163
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,416
- ( gunfire continues )

164
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,125
