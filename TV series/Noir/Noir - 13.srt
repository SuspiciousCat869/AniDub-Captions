1
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,625
- ( voices chanting )

2
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:43,500
- Kirika: NOIR...

3
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,500
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE--

4
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:50,125
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH.

5
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:52,708
THE PEACE
OF THE NEWLY BORN

6
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:55,000
THEIR BLACK HANDS PROTECT.

7
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:59,333
- ( bells tolling )
( birds chirping )

8
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:30,250
- HMM?

9
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,250
- OH.

10
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,416
OH.

11
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,750
YOU'RE VERY GOOD.

12
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,750
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

13
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,916
- HMM.

14
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,458
WELL, THIS ONE'S NICE.

15
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,958
UH, BUT THIS ONE'S NICE TOO.

16
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,791
DECISIONS, DECISIONS.

17
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:18,875
HEY.

18
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,083
WHAT IS IT?

19
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,208
A SKETCHBOOK, HUH?

20
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,625
YOU MEAN THAT YOU WANT ONE?

21
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,125
- MM-HMM.

22
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,250
- FOR SKETCHING, RIGHT?

23
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,958
- MM-HMM.

24
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,625
- HMM.

25
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,250
WELL, I SUPPOSE
MAYBE IT IS TIME

26
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:53,291
THAT YOU TOOK UP A HOBBY
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

27
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,208
BUT IF YOU WANT IT,

28
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,125
LET'S HURRY UP AND GET IT.

29
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,166
- AH.

30
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,708
- HUH?

31
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,250
HELLO.
- ( gasps )

32
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,708
OH, I'M SORRY.

33
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,208
I-- I MEAN...

34
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,791
I GUESS I'M IN YOUR SPOT.

35
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,375
- MY SPOT?

36
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,875
- UH-HUH.

37
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,625
- I DON'T BELIEVE
THIS SPOT BELONGS TO ANYONE.

38
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,416
BUT IF YOU WANT TO DRAW HERE,
YOU'RE CERTAINLY WELCOME TO.

39
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,666
AH, WHAT A GREAT BREEZE.

40
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,416
ISN'T IT GORGEOUS TODAY?

41
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,708
- UH-HUH.

42
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,375
- IN ANY CASE,
DON'T LET ME BOTHER YOU.

43
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,375
- SURE.

44
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,500
- HMM.

45
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,833
UH, HEY,

46
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,666
YOU'RE STARTING
WITH A BRUSH FIRST?

47
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,666
- HUH?

48
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,750
- I MEAN MOST PEOPLE
SKETCH IT OUT BEFOREHAND.

49
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,416
- THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE?

50
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,208
- UH, WELL, DON'T MIND ME.

51
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,875
I'M SURE IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

52
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,916
THEY SAY THE BEST WAY
IS THE WAY THAT YOU WANT TO.

53
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,750
- OKAY.

54
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,416
( brush strokes continue )

55
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,791
- ( scissors snipping )

56
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:57,083
- Mireille: IT SEEMS YOUR SHOP
IS AS POPULAR AS EVER,

57
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,166
RIGHT, PAULETTE?
- OF COURSE.

58
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,833
THE BEST BUZZ COMES
AT A STEEP PRICE.

59
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:05,125
- SO TELL ME,
JUST WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD?

60
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:08,083
- CHRISTIAN GALLE.
INTERESTED?

61
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,708
- I ASSUME YOU MEAN MORGAN'S
OLD RIGHT-HAND MAN.

62
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:15,833
I THOUGHT HE WAS SERVING TIME
IN SOUTH AMERICA.

63
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,791
- WELL, HE'S BACK IN PARIS.

64
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,541
PARDONED THEY SAY.

65
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,208
THEY ALSO SAY
THAT YOU DID MORGAN.

66
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,583
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

67
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,625
THERE WAS QUITE A BIT
OF BAD BLOOD BACK THEN.

68
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,291
- A TYPICAL TURF WAR.

69
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,166
- HMM.

70
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,041
GALLE'S BEEN GATHERING MEN.

71
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,250
HE THINKS HE CAN TAKE YOU.

72
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,166
THIS SESSION WILL BE
RATHER PRICEY.

73
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,041
- ( sighs )
I THOUGHT IT WOULD.

74
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,500
- UGH, YOU'RE SO FORTUNATE

75
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,666
TO HAVE SUCH BEAUTIFUL
HAIR, MIREILLE.

76
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,916
JUST LIKE I DID
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.

77
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:52,875
- THANK YOU.

78
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,208
- ( chirping )

79
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,458
- WELL, THE SUN'S
STARTING TO SET.

80
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,375
IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO CALL IT QUITS.

81
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,166
SO YOU'RE GOING
TO KEEP AT IT?

82
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,166
- HUH?

83
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,583
- UH.

84
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,833
UH, NO, IT'S JUST THAT

85
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,750
YOUR PAINTING IS
VERY DISTINCTIVE.

86
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,000
- IT'S DISTINCTIVE?

87
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,208
- I'M NOT VERY GOOD MYSELF,

88
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,541
BUT THAT'S REALLY
SOMETHING UNIQUE.

89
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:39,458
LOOK, DON'T MIND ME.
I'M JUST TALKING.

90
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,583
WHAT'S BEST IS
TO PLEASE YOURSELF.

91
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,708
- OKAY.

92
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,041
- IF YOU EVER NEED ANY SUPPLIES,

93
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,875
THIS IS THE BEST PLACE.

94
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,791
THE QUALITY IS GOOD
AND THE PRICES ARE REASONABLE.

95
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,625
- THANKS.
I'LL DO THAT.

96
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,875
- AH, SOLD OUT AGAIN.

97
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,333
- HUH?

98
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,208
- THE OWNER OF THE SHOP
MAKES THOSE TILES HIMSELF.

99
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,916
EVERYONE WANTS ONE,

100
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,250
BUT HE REFUSES TO PRINT
ANYTHING MORE THAN LIMITED RUNS.

101
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,375
HE'S SO STUBBORN.

102
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,625
- HMM.

103
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,333
- WELL, LATER, OKAY?

104
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,791
- ( sighs )

105
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,166
SO HAVE YOU LOCATED
THE WOMAN YET?

106
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,791
- HMM, DON'T WORRY, BOSS.

107
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,125
WE'LL FIND HER.

108
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,250
- ( chuckles )

109
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:02,916
OH, I'M COUNTING
ON IT, <i>MON AMI.</i>

110
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,125
- OH.

111
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,250
- ( engine stops )
- ( sighs )

112
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,333
- OH.

113
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,041
HUH?

114
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,958
- ( chuckles )

115
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,041
THERE WE GO.

116
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,000
- SO DO YOU SEE HIM OFTEN?

117
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,666
- HUH?

118
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,291
- THE MAN THAT YOU WERE
PAINTING WITH.

119
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,416
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

120
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,708
- I DON'T KNOW.

121
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,958
- UH-HUH.

122
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,083
YOU SHOULDN'T
SEE HIM ANYMORE.

123
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,416
- UH.

124
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,416
- ( gasps ) OH.

125
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,583
- LIKE IT?
IT'S YOURS.

126
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:23,250
THE LEGION GAVE ME THAT.
THE FOREIGN LEGION, THAT IS.

127
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,083
FOR DISTINGUISHED SERVICE
IN GUIANA.

128
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,083
( groans )

129
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:31,250
MY NAME'S MILOSH HAVEL.
I'M CZECHOSLOVAKIAN.

130
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,958
OF COURSE I'VE BEEN AWAY
FROM THERE SO LONG.

131
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,583
IT'S NOT THE SAME PLACE NOW.

132
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,541
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

133
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,125
- MY...

134
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,791
NAME?

135
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,541
- HEY, NO STRESS.

136
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,458
WE'VE ALL GOT THINGS
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT.

137
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,041
IT'S FINE.

138
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,958
HALF OF THE FOREIGN LEGION IS
FROM EASTERN EUROPE, YOU KNOW?

139
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:11,791
IT'S AND UGLY PLACE FOR MEN
WHO'VE DESERTED THEIR COUNTRIES.

140
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,958
OR WHOSE COUNTRIES
HAVE DESERTED THEM.

141
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,625
AND YET...

142
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,458
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT WHILE PAINTING HERE--

143
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,458
WHETHER TO JOIN UP AGAIN.

144
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,916
( sighs )

145
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,291
SORRY.
I CAN'T EXPECT SOMEONE LIKE YOU

146
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,625
TO KNOW WHAT MY WORLD
IS LIKE, CAN I?

147
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,666
- NO, NOT REALLY.

148
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,666
- YOU'RE STILL SEEING
THAT MAN, AREN'T YOU?

149
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,375
- YES.
- ( sighs )

150
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,666
I COULD HAVE SWORN I TOLD YOU

151
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,375
NOT TO SEE HIM ANYMORE.

152
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,416
- WHY NOT?

153
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,250
- ( exhales )

154
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,375
- HUH?

155
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:32,708
FOLLOWING US?
- UH-HUH.

156
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,291
IS HE STILL BACK THERE?

157
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,916
- YES.

158
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,791
- COVER THE PARK EXITS.

159
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,791
I WANT THAT BLONDE ONE DEAD.

160
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,083
( chuckles )

161
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,375
- RIGHT.

162
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,125
- ( gunshot )
- ( grunts )

163
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,625
- ( gasps )

164
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,666
( moans, thuds )

165
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,375
- ( gunshot )
- HUH HUH?

166
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,791
- ( gunshot )
- ( grunts )

167
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,625

( gasps, exhales )

169
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:51,125
- THE LAST TIME WE MET,
YOU SURVIVED BY RUNNING AWAY.

170
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,666
- ( growling )

171
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,583
YOU BITCH.
- BAD MOVE.

172
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,625
LOOKS LIKE CHECKMATE.
- ( car approaching )

173
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,375
- ( grunts )

174
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,208

00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,375
- WATCH WHERE
YOU'RE DRIVING, DAMN IT!

176
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,250
ARE YOU TRYING
TO GET US BOTH KILLED?

177
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,541
- I SAVED YOUR DERRIERE

178
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,125
AND YOU CAN'T EVEN SAY A
WORD OF THANKS, CAN YOU?

179
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,083
- HUH!

180
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,041
( sighs )

181
00:15:57,125 --> 00:16:00,041
- WELL, THAT WAS
A TOTAL SCREW-UP.

182
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,000
I'D HEARD SHE WAS TOUGH,
BUT I HAD NO IDEA.

183
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,291
- DAMN THEM,

184
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:10,375
I SWEAR I'LL KILL THEM
NO MATTER WHAT.

185
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,500
- HEY.

186
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,500
- HELLO AGAIN.

187
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:39,041
- I'VE DECIDED TO RE-ENLIST.

188
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:42,250
SHOOTING PEOPLE
AND GETTING MEDALS...

189
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,541
I'D GOTTEN SO SICK OF IT.

190
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,875
BUT I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND
ANYTHING ELSE THAT I'M GOOD AT.

191
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,541
I GUESS I SHOULD
HAVE KNOWN, HUH?

192
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,666
YOUR PAINTING'S
TURNED OUT WELL.

193
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,875
IT'S QUITE BOLD,
BUT IT'S TASTEFUL TOO,

194
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,791
EVEN IF, STILL A...

195
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,041
LITTLE CLUMSY.

196
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,500
- ( laughs )
DO YOU THINK SO?

197
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,625
- I GUESS THIS IS GOODBYE, HUH?

198
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,541
- UH-HUH.

199
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,625
- EVEN IN AFRICA,
I PAINTED WHENEVER I COULD.

200
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,875
YOU SHOULD
KEEP PAINTING TOO.

201
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,625
- I WILL.

202
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,500
- WELL THEN.
- ( bells tolling )

203
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,875
- ( soft gasp )

204
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,708
( running )

205
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,166
MR. MILOSH!

206
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,916
- HUH?

207
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,583
- ( tires squeal )

208
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,958
- HUH?

209

- ( moans )

211
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,625
- A GUN?

212
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,958
NO, IT'S OKAY.

213
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:40,916
PLEASE DON'T--
( groans )

214
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,458
- RIGHT. I SEE.

215
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:22,083
THANK YOU, PAULETTE. PUT IT ON
MY BILL FOR NEXT TIME, OKAY?

216
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,541
I KNOW WHERE
GALLE'S HIDING.

217
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,208
- All: HUH?

218
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:48,625
- WHO ARE YOU?

219
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,208
HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?
- ( gunshots )

220
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,750
- MMM.

221

- ( body thuds )

226
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,750
- THIS IS WHY I TOLD YOU!

227
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,166
( huffs )

228
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,041
( sighs )

229
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,166
THAT'S WHY...

230
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:11,375
THAT'S WHY I TOLD YOU.

231
