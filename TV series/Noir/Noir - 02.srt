1
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:40,750
- ( people chanting )

2
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,625
- Kirika: NOIR.

3
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:46,125
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE,

4
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:49,291
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH.

5
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,875
THE PEACE
OF THE NEWLY BORN,

6
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,500
THEIR BLACK HANDS PROTECT.

7
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,958
- ( bells tolling )

8
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,666
- Boy:
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN...

9
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,375
OH!  HEY, MAMA!
IT'S PAPA!

10
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:16,333
- ( engine stops )
- HEY, I'M HOME, HENRI.

11
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,500
- YAY!  PAPA IS HOME!

12
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:21,666
- YOU'RE EARLY.  WE WEREN'T
EXPECTING YOU FOR HOURS

13
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,541
- YEAH, TODAY'S CASELOAD
WAS PRETTY LIGHT.

14
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,541
LOUIS' STILL ASLEEP, HUH?

15
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:31,875
- ( chuckles ) NO, HE'S BEEN
CRYING ALL DAY LONG,

16
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,958
AND I JUST GOT THE LITTLE
MONSTER SETTLED DOWN.

17
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,666
- ( laughs ) REALLY?
- YES, REALLY.

18
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,041
- AND BY THE WAY, HENRI,

19
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,458
YOU KNOW THAT NEW GAME
YOU WANTED?

20
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,208
WHY DON'T WE GO
BUY ONE FOR YOU LATER?

21
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,000
- REALLY?!
ALL RIGHT!

22
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,541
- Mother:
ISN'T THAT NICE?

23
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,791
- ( sirens wailing )

24
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,000
- ( people chattering )

25
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,083
- HMM.

26
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,000
- ( sighs )
- HMM.

27
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,500
HMM.

28
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,375
- ( clicks, beeps )

29
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,666
- Mireille:
HMM.  WE HAVE A JOB OFFER.

30
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,916
- WHAT NOW?

31
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,958
- WELL, LET'S LOOK AT IT,
SHALL WE?

32
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,291
HMM.

33
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,041
- ( sighs )

34
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:23,875
- YOU'RE BORED, HUH?

35
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:26,833
- HM-MMM.

36
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,958
- COME ON.
LET'S HEAD HOME.

37
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,291
- Priest:
O BENEVOLENT GOD,

38
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,458
THROUGH THE DEATH AND
RESURRECTION OF YOUR OWN SON,

39
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,500
WHO IS CHRIST OUR LORD,

40
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,166
YOU HAVE BESTOWED
UPON THE FAITHFUL THE HOPE

41
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,500
OF ETERNAL LIFE
AND RESURRECTION.

42
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:51,083
WE BEG YOU NOW TO ALLOW
THOSE LAID TO REST TODAY

43
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,333
TO REST IN PEACE
UNTIL THE DAY OF RESURRECTION,

44
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,541
AND BY YOUR MERCY

45
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,125
MAY THEY RECEIVE
THE JOY OF ETERNAL LIFE

46
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,041
THROUGH CHRIST WHO IS
OUR LIFE AND RESURRECTION.

47
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,541
- ( whispering )
WE MUST TALK.

48
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,500
- NOW?  CAN'T IT
WAIT UNTIL WE GET BACK?

49
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,166
- NO, IMMEDIATELY.

50
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,666
I HAVE A CAR WAITING.
- All: AMEN.

51
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:15,166
- ( car doors
open, close )

52
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,875
- I KNOW YOU'RE MAD.

53
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:22,708
THAT MAN OUT THERE WAS
ONE OF OUR FINEST OFFICERS.

54
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,708
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
WE CAN'T ADMIT

55
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,083
HE WAS PART OF THE NATIONAL
ANTI-TERROR UNIT,

56
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,041
ONLY THAT HE WAS
A POLICE OFFICER

57
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,666
WHO GAVE HIS LIFE
FOR HIS COUNTRY.

58
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,125
- I KNOW THAT.

59
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,041
- THIS IS THE THIRD ONE.

60
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,500
THE FIRST TWO
WERE PETTY OFFICERS.

61
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,000
AND NOW A COMMISSIONED ONE.

62
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:44,000
IT'S ALMOST AS IF
THOSE BASTARDS HAD ACCESS

63
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,000
TO THE G.I.G.N.'S
RECRUITING LIST.

64
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:49,625
- YOU MEAN THAT YOU THINK...

65
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,583
- WE CANNOT DENY
THE POSSIBILITY

66
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,208
OF A LEAK IN OUR DEPARTMENT.

67
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,208
- HMM.

68
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:02,083
- AT THE VERY LEAST,
I WANT A REPORT READIED

69
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,958
FOR THE MINISTRY
OF NATIONAL DEFENSE

70
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,250
ON THAT SUBJECT.
IS THAT CLEAR?

71
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,958
- UNDERSTOOD.

72
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,541
I'LL START ON IT
IMMEDIATELY, SIR.

73
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,916
- TOP SECRET.
- RIGHT.

74
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,208
- ( sighs )
- ( bell tolling )

75
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:29,625
- I JUST PRAY THAT OUR FEARS
TURN OUT TO BE UNFOUNDED.

76
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,333
- YES SIR.
I'LL BE PRAYING AS WELL.

77
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,333
- ( Mireille sighs )

78
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,916
- THERE.

79
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,708
( sighs )

80
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:15,875
HUH?

81
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:27,958
- ( sighs )

82
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:31,208
Mireille's voice: ALL'S WELL
WITH THE WORLD, IT SEEMS.

83
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,291
WOULD YOU GET
THAT KNIFE FOR ME?

84
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,541
- SURE.

85
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:00,750
HERE.

86
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:08,791
- THANK YOU.

87
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,291
THAT'S OUR DAILY BREAD.

88
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,000
IN OTHER WORDS,
HEAVEN'S BLESSING.

89
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,916
WHY DON'T YOU EAT IT
AS THOUGH YOU'RE ENJOYING IT?

90
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,875
- I AM ENJOYING IT.

91
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,125
- WELL, YOU DON'T LOOK
LIKE YOU ARE.

92
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,708
- REALLY?
- ( emphatically ) REALLY.

93
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,250
- AND YOU DON'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING ABOUT YOURSELF?

94
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,333
- MM-HMM.
- WHAT ABOUT ME?

95
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,250
- MIREILLE BOUQUET,

96
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:11,291
A MOST TRUSTWORTHY
ASSASSIN FOR HIRE.

97
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,458
- I SEE.

98
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,375
WELL, LET'S MOVE ON

99
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,375
TO THE NEXT TOPIC,
SHALL WE?

100
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,125
I KNOW YOU FOUND MORE
THAN JUST THIS GUN.

101
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:28,875
YOU HAVE ONE MORE THING
THAT YOU'VE BEEN HIDING.

102
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,041
- HMM.

103
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,333
- TAKE IT OUT.

104
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,458
( gasps )

105
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,458
- ( ticking )

106
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,291
- ( breathing shakily )

107
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,333
( gasps )

108
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,416
- ( chattering )

109
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,041
- THANKS TO YOU, MY FRIEND,

110
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,375
THOSE DOGS HAVE
ALL BEEN EXECUTED.

111
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:13,750
THAT'S THREE LESS
G.I.G.N. DOGS TO HARRY US.

112
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,041
THERE'S NO FOOL LIKE
A FEROCIOUS DOG

113
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,375
THAT'S BLINDLY LOYAL
TO HIS MASTER.

114
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,041
- MMM.

115
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:24,708
- YOU ARE CONTRIBUTING
TO THE FUTURE OF FRANCE

116
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,833
BY WEEDING OUT THOSE FOOLS.

117
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,291
- AND THE MONEY?

118
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,041
- THE USUAL.

119
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,375
WHAT ABOUT
THE PUBLIC PEACE DEPARTMENT?

120
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,000
- DON'T WORRY.
I'M WITH YOU.

121
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:39,583
- GOOD.
I'M COUNTING ON YOU, COMRADE.

122
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,041
I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN
NEXT WEEK.

123
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,250
- Mireille: OUR TARGETS
ARE JEAN JACQUES LEGRAND,

124
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,958
DIRECTOR OF THE FRENCH NATIONAL
PUBLIC PEACE DEPARTMENT,

125
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,041
AND PIERRE CRESSOY,
A KEY OFFICER

126
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,583
IN THE LEADING FACTION
OF THE PEOPLE'S ARMED ALLIANCE--

127
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,833
A FAR-RIGHT
TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.

128
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:05,375
IT SEEMS LEGRAND SOLD THE
G.I.G.N.'S ROSTER TO CRESSOY,

129
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,250
AND IN RETURN
LEGRAND RECEIVED INFORMATION

130
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,833
FROM CRESSOY THAT IMPROVED
HIS CONVICTION RATE.

131
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:14,083
OUR CLIENT IS ANOTHER FACTION
OF THE PEOPLE'S ARMED ALLIANCE.

132
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,125
THEY WERE RATHER BURNED BY
THE INFORMATION CRESSOY LEAKED.

133
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,875
SO BY HIRING US,

134
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,000
THEY ELIMINATE THE LEADER
OF THEIR RIVAL FACTION

135
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,666
AND LEGRAND IN ONE SHOT.

136
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,125
WELL, TO BE FRANK,
ALL OF THEM ARE SCUM,

137
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:37,083
BUT THE CLEANING FEE
IS <i>TRES BON.</i>

138
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,875
- ( rock music plays )

139
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,041
- HMM.

140
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,708
- ( chattering )

141
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,250
- THERE HE IS.

142
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,333
WELL, IT APPEARS
OUR CLIENT IS RIGHT.

143
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,875
THERE'S DEFINITELY A CONNECTION
BETWEEN LEGRAND AND CRESSOY.

144
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,083
THIS IS THE LEADING FACTION'S
SAFE HOUSE.

145
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,416
HOW THEY GOT A
PROPERTY LIKE THAT

146
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,958
IN THIS DAY AND
AGE IS BEYOND ME.

147
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,541
- ( paper rustles )

148
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,958
- THESE ARE THE BLUEPRINTS
FOR THAT BUILDING.

149
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,041
THE EMERGENCY EXITS ARE HERE,

150
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,791
AND HERE.

151
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,750
SINCE THE FRONT SECTION'S
BEEN BLOCKED OFF,

152
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,958
OUR PATHS OF ENTRY
ARE LIMITED.

153
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,791
THERE ARE TWO ROUTES.

154
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,458
I'LL COVER THE MAIN ONE

155
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,250
AND YOU COVER
THE ESCAPE ROUTE.

156
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,958
ALL RIGHT?
- MMM.

157
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,916
- ( keyboard clicking )

158
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,666
- ( people chanting )

159
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,791
- ( bells ringing )

160
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,833
- ( gun firing )

161
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,291

00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:01,416
- ( hissing )

164
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,583
- HMM.

165
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:13,750
- ( gate squeaks )

166
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:30,500
- AH.  WELCOME TO
OUR HUMBLE FORTRESS, COMRADE.

167
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,208
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE UP TO,

168
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,000
BUT IT HAD BETTER BE REALLY
IMPORTANT TO BRING ME HERE.

169
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,416
- OH, IT IS.
- SO WHAT IS IT?

170
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,958
- THE ACTIVITIES
OF ONE OF OUR OTHER FACTIONS

171
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,541
HAS BEEN BOTHERING ME.

172
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,250
SO JUST FOR KICKS,
I CAPTURED ONE OF THEM.

173
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,291
- YOU WHAT?
- THIS WAY.

174
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:55,291
- HE WAS QUITE TOUGH,
BUT HE SPILLED HIS GUTS.

175
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:58,875
IN FACT, AN HOUR AGO
HE REVEALED THAT HIS FACTION

176
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,708
HAD HIRED AN ASSASSIN
TO KILL THE TWO OF US.

177
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,541
- YOU'RE SURE OF THIS?

178
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:07,458
- EHH, IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING
THEY WOULD COME UP WITH.

179
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:11,250
- I SEE.  AND DID YOU GET
THE ASSASSIN'S NAME?

180
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,791
- YEAH, THE CODENAME IS NOIR.

181
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,791
I'M AFRAID
THAT'S ALL HE KNOWS.

182
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,500
- NOIR?!

183
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,291
NOT THE SAME NOIR.

184
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,750
NO, IT CAN'T BE.

185
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,958
- SO YOU KNOW THE NAME.

186
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,083
- YES, IN FACT, I DO.

187
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,541
YOU SEE, THE NAME NOIR

188
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:31,125
HOLDS A VERY SPECIAL
MEANING IN THE UNDERWORLD.

189
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,500
- OH.

190
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,458
- IT'S NOT VERY WELL KNOWN,

191
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,875
BUT THE TRUTH IS
THAT OUR OWN POLICE

192
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,666
HAVE HIRED NOIR TO HANDLE
CERTAIN JOBS IN THE PAST,

193
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,791
BUT THE LAST TIME
WAS BACK IN THE 1970s.

194
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,416
- HMM?

195
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,833
- SO DOES THIS MEAN THAT
NOIR HAS BECOME ACTIVE AGAIN?

196
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:54,333
OR IS SOMEONE COMPLETELY
UNRELATED CALLING HIMSELF NOIR?

197
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,333
- ( silenced gunshot )
- ( cries out, groans )

198
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,375
- WELL, NO MATTER
WHO THIS NOIR IS,

199
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,416
NOW THAT WE KNOW
HE'S COMING FOR US,

200
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,250
WE HAVE
PLENTY OF OPTIONS.

201
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:21,166
DON'T WORRY.  I'LL ASSEMBLE
OUR MEMBERS IMMEDIATELY.

202
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,791
- AND THIS ONE?

203
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,125

223
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,500
IT'S NOT... POSSIBLE.

224
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,416
HOW CAN YOU BE NOIR?

225
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,583
