1
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:40,750
- ( people chanting )

2
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,625
- Kirika: NOIR.

3
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:46,125
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE,

4
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:49,291
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH.

5
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,875
THE PEACE
OF THE NEWLY BORN,

6
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,500
THEIR BLACK HANDS PROTECT.

7
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:59,333
- ( phone rings )

8
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,541
- Man on phone:
Uh, is that you, Mireille?

9
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:02,750
It's Vanel.

10
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:05,458
I have some information.

11
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,875
Yes, it's about that.

12
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:11,041
No, I'll tell you the details
when we meet in person.

13
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,458
Why don't you come
to my house tomorrow?

14
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:15,250
At noon, perhaps?

15
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:18,541
Yes, my wife would like
for you to come as well.

16
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:27,958
- UH...

17
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,833
- ( cocks )

18
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:51,916
- ( gasping )

19
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,958
( breathes shakily )

20
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,208
- ( footsteps )
WE'RE TOO LATE.

21
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,166
- ( gasps )

22
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,208
- Mireille: IT WAS MY FAULT.

23
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,000
I WAS CHECKING OUT

24
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,208
EVERYONE DUX HAD RECENTLY
COME INTO CONTACT WITH.

25
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,583
I'D ASKED VANEL TO TRACK DOWN
SOME INFORMATION...

26
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,458
AND I'M SURE
THAT HE WAS KILLED FOR IT...

27
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,583
ALONG WITH HIS ENTIRE FAMILY.

28
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,583
- IT'S NO USE.

29
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:02,833
- HMM?

30
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,708
- JUST THINKING ABOUT IT,
I MEAN.

31
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,916
- ( sighs )

32
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,333
YOU'RE RIGHT.

33
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,750
- ( beeping )

34
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,291
- Mireille:
THEY'RE TRYING TO KILL US.

35
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,666
THEY'RE TRYING TO KILL NOIR.

36
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,708
- ( gunshot )

37
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,833
- ( groaning )

38
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,416
THE FIRST TIME WE MET

39
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,791
WAS COINCIDENCE.

40
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,250
- TELL ME ONE THING:

41
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:09,125
WHO WAS IT THAT HIRED YOU
TO KILL NOIR?

42
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,625
- IF YOU WERE ME,
WOULD YOU TELL?

43
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:18,083
- ( chuckles ) NO WAY.

44
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,083
- ( laughs weakly )

45
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,958
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- ( gasps )

46
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,958
( coughing )

47
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,000
WHAT'S THE POINT OF ASKING?

48
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,416
NEITHER YOU
NOR I HAVE GRAVES WAITING

49
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,166
ON WHICH TO CARVE OUR NAMES.

50
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,375
( gags )

51
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,000
( weakly )
NEITHER YOU NOR...

52
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,708
- VANEL MUST'VE FOUND
A CLUE AS TO WHO THEY ARE.

53
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:52,750
AH.

54
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,625
- GOOD MORNING.

55
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,916
- ( sighs )

56
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,583
- OH.

57
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,541
- WATERING THE FLOWERS IS FINE,

58
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:21,000
BUT DON'T FORGET THAT THEY
MIGHT BE TURNING BLACK, ANYWAY.

59
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:27,333
NOIR.
I'D HEARD THAT NAME BEFORE.

60
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,208
IT'S ONE OF THE
OLDEST DESIGNATIONS

61
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,333
IN OUR LINE OF WORK...

62
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:35,083
AND YET NO ONE KNOWS
ITS ORIGINS.

63
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:38,583
IT'S LIKE A PUZZLE MADE UP
OF ODD-SHAPED PIECES.

64
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:42,083
THERE'S THE PIECE
WE CALL NOIR,

65
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,083
YOU'RE ANOTHER PIECE...

66
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,083
AND THEN THERE'S ONE MORE.

67
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,625
I'M GOING TO CHECK OUT
SOME OF VANEL'S OLD HAUNTS.

68
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,625
- ( pants )

69
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,500
- YOU NEEDN'T COME.

70
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,666
- ( door closes )

71
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,125
- ( distant siren )

72
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,791
- Man:
IT'S SO BRUTAL.

73
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,750
THE ENTIRE FAMILY
SLAUGHTERED LIKE THAT.

74
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,125
VANEL WAS A GOOD MAN

75
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,750
WITH A STRONG SENSE
OF HONOR.

76
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,125
EVEN AFTER
HE BECAME WELL-KNOWN,

77
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,791
HE STILL CAME BY
AND PAID HIS RESPECTS TO ME,

78
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,291
HIS OLD SUPERIOR.

79
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,916
TO MANY
HE MAY HAVE SEEMED RESERVED,

80
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,166
BUT HE WAS
A DOTING FATHER.

81
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,333
OUR FRIEND LOVED
HIS SON AND DAUGHTER

82
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,208
AS DEARLY AS LIFE ITSELF.

83
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:59,625
AND HIS WIFE--
NOW THERE WAS A FINE WOMAN.

84
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,541
SO TRAGIC.

85
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,041
- YES, IT WAS.

86
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,666
VANEL AND HIS WIFE
WERE AMONG THE FEW PEOPLE

87
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,625
IN THIS WORLD
I COULD TRUST.

88
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,416
- FINE FOLKS INDEED.

89
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,166
AND NOW YOU ARE
ASKING ABOUT...?

90
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,541
- ABOUT LAST WEEK, SIR.

91
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,791
- AH YES.
AS YOU SAID,

92
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,541
HE CAME INTO THE SHOP
RATHER UNEXPECTEDLY.

93
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,708
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME
HE'D STOPPED BY

94
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,041
IN NEARLY TWO YEARS,
SO I REMEMBER IT WELL.

95
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,125
- AND DID HE SAY ANYTHING?

96
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,541
- NOT REALLY.
HOLD ON.

97
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,875
HMM.  HMM.

98
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,750
NOW THAT I THINK OF IT,

99
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,666
HE WAS LOOKING RATHER PALE.

100
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,000
- I SEE.

101
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,375
- OH!  NOW I REMEMBER!

102
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,125
HE LEFT A BOTTLE
WITH YOUR NAME ON IT.

103
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,291
- ( gasps )
A BOTTLE?!  WHERE IS IT?

104
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,000
- HERE.  THIS ONE.

105
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,083
HE SAID HE WANTED
TO SHARE IT WITH YOU NEXT TIME.

106
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,250
- ( gasps )

107
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,708
- Vanel's voice:
"MIREILLE, TO OUR MEMORIES

108
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,541
OF SAINT GALAN'S CATHEDRAL."

109
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,333
- ( grunts )

110
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,458
( grunts )

111
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,375
- ( cocks )

112
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,166
( grunts )

113
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,916
- ( gun clicks )
- ( sighs )

114
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,750
- ( rock music plays )

115
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,708
- WHAT MEMORIES
OF SAINT GALAN'S CATHEDRAL?

116
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,750
- I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE.

117
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,541
- AND THIS?

118
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,791
- I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THAT'S ABOUT EITHER.

119
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:10,083
- CIRCLES AROUND "D" AND 5.

120
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,375
TRIANGLES AROUND "G" AND 7.

121
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,416
- I THINK
VANEL MUST'VE DISCOVERED

122
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,000
SOMETHING REALLY BIG,

123
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,708
SOMETHING THAT
SCARED HIM SO BADLY...

124
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,416
THAT HE FELT
HE HAD TO HIDE IT.

125
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,916
- IN SAINT GALAN'S CATHEDRAL.

126
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,916
- IN THE CHAPEL?
IN THE BELL TOWER?

127
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,916
- THE MONASTERY?
THE CLOISTER?

128
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,750
- NO, NOT THERE.

129
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:41,541
THE HERB GARDEN?
- THE CATACOMB?

130
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,916
- ( gasps )

131
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,291
- HUH?

132
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,625
- ( switch clicks )
- ( electrical humming )

133
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,958
- Mireille's voice:
"D," <i>"DROIT,"</i> RIGHT?

134
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,166
FIVE.

135
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,791
ONE, TWO,

136
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,333
THREE,

137
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,208
FOUR,

138
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,375
FIVE.

139
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,166
FIFTH TO THE RIGHT.

140
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,583
"G" IS FOR <i>"GAUCHE."</i>

141
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,291
SEVENTH TO THE LEFT.

142
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,166
ONE...

143
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,291
TWO...

144
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:18,833
THREE...

145
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,666
FOUR...

146
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,708
FIVE...

147
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,666
SIX...

148
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,708
SEVEN.

149
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,625
- ( switch clicks )

150
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,041
- ( rustling )

151
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,416
- ( gasps )

152
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,208
( sighs )

153
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,166
- ( bird cawing )

154
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,875
- ( sighs )

155
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,291
- ( gun cocks )
- ( gasps )

156
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,875
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE HERE.

157
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,250
- YOU WHAT?

158
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,708
- I KNEW THAT I WAS BEING
FOLLOWED OUT HERE,

159
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,208
AND I KNEW
THAT YOU WERE AFTER THAT.

160
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,500
- ( gunshot )
- ( grunts )

161
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,208
- BUT WHAT WE'RE AFTER IS YOU.

162
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,791
YOU'RE GOING TO TELL US
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW.

163
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,291
LET'S START
WITH WHO YOU WORK FOR.

164
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,583
- ( groans )

165
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,875
YOU THINK
IT WILL BE THAT EASY?

166
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,458
- ( gunfire )
- ( gasps )

167
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,291
- ( man grunts )
- ( gasps )

168
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,291
- ( rock music playing,
woman singing )

- ( man grunts, thuds )

172
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,750
- SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL ABOUT
THE PHOTOCOPY IN THAT FOLDER?

173
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,166
- ( sighs )
IT'S PRECIOUS.

174
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,041
MORE PRECIOUS THAN THE LIFE
OF ANYONE ON THIS PLANET.

175
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,166
- YOU'RE THE ONES WHO KILLED

176
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,208
VANEL AND HIS FAMILY,
AREN'T YOU?

177
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,333
- SUCH WERE THE ORDERS
THAT WERE GIVEN US.

178
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:27,083
THEY SAID THE SECRET
MUST BE MAINTAINED.

179
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:30,041
- "THEY SAID"?
AND WHO ARE THEY?

180
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,333
- WHO ARE THEY?

181
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,458
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO KNOW.

182
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,916
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE,

183
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,875
AN ABSOLUTE PRESENCE.

184
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,750
ONLY A HANDFUL
EVEN KNOW THEY EXIST.

185
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,000
BUT I KNOW THE TRUTH.

186
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,250
SHOOT ME
AND YOUR KEY IS GONE.

187
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,541
- ( breathing angrily )

188
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,333
- ( chuckles )
- ( breathing angrily )

189
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,458
- ( gunshot )

190
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,791
- ( groaning )

191
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,416
( chuckles )

192
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,166
( groans )

193
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,000
- ( breathes shakily )

- Mireille's voice:
"THE MAN WITHIN THE MAN.

196
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,958
THE LOVE
WITHIN THE LOVE.

197
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,375
THE SIN WITHIN THE SIN.

198
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,208
THE HERMIT TOLD
UNTO THE SINNER,

199
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,750
THE SOLDATS IS
WITH THE TRUTH."

200
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,708
THE SOLDATS.

201
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,708
SO THAT'S THE NAME...

202
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:30,958
OF OUR ENEMY.

203
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,416
- HUH?

204
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:49,000
- BACK HOME...
IN CORSICA,

205
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,583
MY PARENTS AND OLDER BROTHER
WERE ALL MURDERED.

206
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,416
TO THIS DAY I HAVE NO IDEA
WHO KILLED THEM OR WHY.

207
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,208
THAT WAS THE LAST TIME
I SAW THIS WATCH...

208
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,583
UNTIL YOU BROUGHT IT TO ME
FROM MY PAST.

209
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,083
- BUT NOW I HAVE NOTHING.

210
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,083
I'M SORRY.

211
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,083
I'M SORRY, MIREILLE.

212
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,125
- ( chuckles )

213
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,791
I WILL OPEN
THIS DOOR TO THE PAST.

214
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,625
I SWEAR I WILL.

215
