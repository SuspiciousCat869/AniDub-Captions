- ( voices chanting )

2
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:43,500
- Kirika: NOIR...

3
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,500
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE--

4
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:50,125
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH.

5
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:52,708
THE PEACE
OF THE NEWLY BORN

6
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:55,000
THEIR BLACK HANDS PROTECT.

7
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,416
- ( wind blowing )

8
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,208

- ( meows )

12
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,541
- Mireille: LET'S GO.
- HMM.

13
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,791
- ( meows )

14
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,250
- ( engine starts )

00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,250
- ( cab departs )

16
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,458
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- HUH?

17
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,125
- WE'RE ALL CHECKED IN.
LET'S GET TO THE ROOM.

18
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,916
- ( sighs )

19
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:42,916
- Man: HEY, GET IN LINE!

20
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,625
- Woman: THERE IS ENOUGH
FOR ALL. WAIT YOUR TURN.

21
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,875
- Man: BESIDES, THE BORSCHT
IS ALWAYS THICKER

22
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,916
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE POT.
( laughs )

23
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,291
- Woman: THANK YOU, SIR.

24
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:57,750
MAY THE LORD BLESS YOU. YOU
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SO GOOD TO US.

25
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:01,250
- Mireille: THERE'S NO ONE HERE
WHO EVEN KNOWS HIS NAME.

26
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,625
AND FOR ALL HIS WORK
HE SEEKS NO COMPENSATION.

27
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,625
HE'S DEVOTED ALL HIS TIME
TO HELPING THE PEOPLE HERE...

28
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,541
FOR YEARS, FOR DECADES.

29
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,833
THE PEOPLE HERE IDOLIZE HIM.

30
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,000
SOME EVEN CALL HIM A SAINT.

31
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:25,125
BUT WHO HE REALLY IS
IS YURI NAZAROV,

32
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,583
A BUTCHER FOR THE K.G.B.

33
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:30,500
DURING THE PURGES
IN THE OLD U.S.S.R.

34
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,416
THERE WAS AN ETHNIC MINORITY
CALLED THE TASHKIL.

35
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,666
THEY WERE SLAUGHTERED
ALMOST TO THE MAN

36
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,458
IN A SOVIET DEATH CAMP.

37
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,833
DEATHS ORDERED
BY YURI NAZAROV.

38
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,708
SHORTLY THEREAFTER HE QUIT
THE K.G.B. AND DISAPPEARED,

39
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,625
ERASING HIS TRACES SO
COMPLETELY IT WAS AS IF

40
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,041
HE HAD NEVER EXISTED AT ALL.

41
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,458
NO ONE KNOWS WHY.

42
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:55,583
BUT NOW HE'S A SAINT
TO THE DESTITUTE.

43
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:59,375
OUR CLIENTS ARE THE SURVIVING
DESCENDANTS OF THE TASHKIL.

44
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:03,333
ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS THAT
NAZAROV IS TRYING TO ATONE,

45
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,291
THE HATRED OF
THE FEW WHO SURVIVED

46
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,375
CAN'T BE ERASED SO EASILY.

47
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,625
THAT'S WHERE WE COME IN.

48
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,083
A SIMPLE JOB REALLY.

49
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,416
- MM.

50
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,958
OH.

51
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
MIREILLE?
- MM-HMM?

52
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:50,083
- I'M GOING OUT FOR A WALK.
- HUH?

53
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,625
- ( trash can clangs )

54
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:06,708
- ( meows )

- ( door opens )

56
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,333
- I'M BACK.

57
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:19,791
- YOU'VE BEEN GONE AWHILE.

58
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,250
- MM-HMM.

59
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,666
- WHAT'S THAT?
DID YOU BUY SOMETHING TO EAT?

60
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,625
- ( rustling )

61
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,000
- ( meows )

62
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,750
- ( sighs )
PLEASE TELL ME

63
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,833
YOU'RE NOT REALLY
THINKING OF--

64
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,500
- MM-HMM.

65
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,791
- ( crowd laughing, chattering )

66
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,500
- PLEASE SAY YOU AREN'T
REALLY THINKING--

67
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:08,750
- HMM.

68
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,291
- PLEASE TELL ME

69
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:21,750
YOU'RE NOT THINKING OF TAKING IT
BACK TO PARIS WITH US, ARE YOU?

70
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,750
- DOES THIS CAT HAVE NAME?

71
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,375
- HUH?

72
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,125
- IF...

73
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:32,166
IF HE HAS A NAME,
THEN HE'S NOT LIKE ME.

74
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,708
IF THIS CAT HAS A NAME

75
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,333
THEN HE'S ONLY
PHYSICALLY LOST.

76
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,958
BUT I DON'T EVEN HAVE A NAME.

77
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:46,500
ALL I HAVE IS A LIE
CALLED YUMURA KIRIKA.

78
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,708
- ( sighs )

79
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,833
IT'S ALL THE SAME TO ME.

80
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,208
IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT

81
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:56,541
THAT YOU'RE JUST PART
OF A MUCH BIGGER LIE.

82
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,708
BUT THEN AGAIN

83
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,625
IN THE END IT SEEMS
I'M IN THE SAME BOAT YOU ARE.

84
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,958
WE'RE BOTH FLOATING
ADRIFT IN THE DARK

85
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,333
AT THE MERCY OF THE CURRENTS.

86
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,833
IN ORDER TO FIND
THE REAL ANSWERS,

87
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,666
WE'LL HAVE TO ASK
THE SOLDATS.

88
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,416
- YEAH.
- ( ragged breathing )

89

THE LOVE
WITHIN THE LOVE.

00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,166
THE SIN WITHIN THE SIN.

96
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,875
THE HERMIT TOLD
UNTO THE SINNER,

97

THE SOLDATS IS WITH TRUTH."

98
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,416
THE SOLDATS...

99
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,333
I STILL DON'T KNOW ENOUGH
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS.

100
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,791
NOT YET,

101
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,458
BUT I SWEAR I WILL FIND OUT.

102
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,541
- HMM.

103
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,958

- ( purring )

105
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:57,500
- I WISH THAT AT LEAST
I KNEW WHAT YOUR NAME WAS.

106
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,000
- ( man whispers )
PRINCE MYSHKIN.

107
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,833
- OH.

108
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,333
- DID YOU SAY PRINCE MYSHKIN?

109
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,000
OH.

110
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,541
- ( meows )

111
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:32,041
- MM-HMM. YOU ASKED

112
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,375
WHAT THIS FELLOW'S NAME WAS.

113
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,541
IT IS PRINCE MYSHKIN.

114
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,041
- SO THAT MEANS
HE BELONGS TO YOU THEN?

115
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:42,958
- YES, BUT THE LITTLE COSSACK'S
BEEN MISSING FOR A FEW DAYS.

116
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:47,000
IT SEEMS THAT I HAVE YOU
TO THANK FOR TAKING CARE OF HIM.

117
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,333
- OH NO, IT WAS NOTHING REALLY.

118
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,916
- PLEASE ALLOW ME
TO THANK YOU ANYWAY--

119
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,750
FOR HIS SAKE.

120
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,458
GOODBYE, YOUNG LADY.
- GOODBYE, SIR.

121

THAT HE WILL MISS YOU.

124
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,125
- HMM.

WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, SIR?

129
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,166
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

130
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,333
PLEASE, SIR,
YOU'VE GOT TO TRY TO STAY AWAKE.

131
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:40,666
YOU CAN'T GIVE UP.
YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP FIGHTING.

HE HAS BEEN PUSHING HIMSELF

137
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:21,625
FOR FAR TOO LONG.

138

ANY THOUGHT TO HIS HEALTH,

141
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,583
ALWAYS HE JUST KEPT
WORKING FOR OTHERS.

142
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:38,125
I'M AFRAID THERE'S NOTHING
MORE I CAN DO FOR HIM.

143
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:41,583
HE DOESN'T HAVE
LONG LEFT TO LIVE.

- ( choir singing )

165
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,666
- Boy: ARE YOU
FEELING BETTER, SIR?

166
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,500
- Girl: IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT?

167
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,916
- YOU'LL GET WELL
SOON, WON'T YOU?

168
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,333
- Girl: YES, PLEASE.

169
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:23,333
- WE WANT YOU TO BE ABLE
TO PLAY WITH US AGAIN.

170
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,416
- YOU WILL, WON'T YOU?

171
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,750
- YEAH, AND COOK
FOR US AGAIN TOO. RIGHT?

172
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,500
- OH, I WISH
I COULD HAVE SOME NOW.

173
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:33,791
- IT'S REALLY GOOD,
SO GET WELL SOON, OKAY?

174
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:37,291
OH, GUESS WHAT...
- HMM?

175
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,583
- Girl: HUH?

176
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,125
- Boy: WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S WRONG?

177
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,208
- Mireille: HMM.

178
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,000
IT'S GOT TO BE
A FAMILY PICTURE, RIGHT?

179
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,208
AND FROM THE LOOKS OF IT

180
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:58,208
I'M GUESSING THAT
THIS BOY IS NAZAROV.

181
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,666
THAT'S ABOUT THE RIGHT AGE
HE'D HAVE BEEN IN 1951.

182
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,250
( sighs )

183
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,041
ALL RIGHT, BALKUTSK, HUH?

184
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,791
SOUNDS LIKE A PLACE.

185
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,500
( typing )

186
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,833
ON THE OTHER HAND, AT LEAST I'VE
GOT ONE MORE CLUE ABOUT YOU NOW.

187
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,500
- HUH?

188
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,250
- YOU MAY KNOW THE UNDERWORLD,

189
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,375
EXCEL AT ASSASSINATION
TECHNIQUES,

190
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,375
AND SPEAK DOZENS
OF LANGUAGES,

191
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,166
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE
OF RUSSIAN LITERATURE.

192
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,250
- RUSSIAN LITERATURE?

193
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,125
- PRINCE MYSHKIN HAPPENS
TO BE THE PROTAGONIST

194
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,208
OF DOSTOEVSKY'S "THE IDIOT."

195
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:38,416
HE'S THE EMBODIMENT
OF A PURE AND INNOCENT SOUL.

196
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,125
- A PURE AND...

197
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,708
INNOCENT SOUL.

198
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,083
- ( sighs )
THAT'S ODD.

199
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,041
I CAN'T FIND A PLACE CALLED
BALKUTSK ANYWHERE.

200
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,125
- I SEE.

201
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,375
- YOU DO KNOW THAT
IT DOESN'T MATTER

202
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,583
WHAT KIND OF PERSON
NAZAROV TURNS OUT TO BE, RIGHT?

203
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:03,166
- MM-HMM.
- NAZAROV IS A FOOL.

204
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,333
NO MATTER HOW KIND
HE'S BEEN TO THE POOR,

205
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:06,958
IT DOESN'T CHANGE THINGS.

206
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:10,458
IT MAY HELP HIS OWN CONSCIENCE,
BUT EVEN THE ONES HE'S HELPED--

207
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,041
- I KNOW THAT.

208
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:15,208
AND I THINK THAT NAZAROV
KNOWS IT AS WELL.

209
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,125
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
HE CAN DO.

210
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,583
I THINK THAT HE'S JUST WAITING
FOR THE SNOW TO FALL.

211
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,500
- SNOW?

212
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,000
- YES.

213
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,500
UNTIL ENOUGH
HAS ACCUMULATED.

214
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,166
- ( typing )

215
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,625
- ( groans )

216
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,708
- ( meows )
- HMM?

217
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:16,458
( gasps )

218
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,041
( sighs )

219
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,333
MMM.

220
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,583
- ( gunshot )

221
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,125
- ( gasps )

222
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,875
( panting )

223
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,958
- ( gunshot )

224
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:33,625
- ( yelps )

225
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,041
- ( gunshots )

226
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,208
- Mireille:
BALKUTSK WAS THE HOME

227
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,166
OF A PEOPLE CALLED THE NORGA.

228
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,041
DURING STALIN'S ERA
THE NORGA'S ENEMIES,

229
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,000
THE TASHKIL, RAIDED AND
DESTROYED THE VILLAGE.

230
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,041
NOW NOT EVEN
ITS NAME REMAINS.

231
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:53,041
- SO NAZAROV IS A NORGA?

232
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,375
- AND IT SEEMS THAT
EVEN AFTER ALL THIS TIME,

233
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,750
THE LAST FEW REMAINING
NORGA AND TASHKIL

234
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,541
ARE STILL SET ON
KILLING EACH OTHER.

235
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:03,416
THE YEARS CONTINUE TO PASS
AND THE BLOOD CONTINUES TO FLOW.

236
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,541
IT'S GONE ON FOR SO LONG NOW

237
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,791
THERE'S NO WAY LEFT TO TELL
HOW IT ALL BEGAN--

238
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:14,125
WHAT WAS THE CAUSE
AND WHAT WAS THE EFFECT.

239
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,500
SO MANY MONTHS
AND YEARS HAVE PASSED

240
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,083
SINCE THE MASSACRE
AT THE CONCENTRATION CAMP,

241
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:23,791
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE WHAT'S BEEN
GOING THROUGH HIS MIND.

242
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,250
SO THEN, WHERE TO NOW?

243
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,708
DO THE JOB AND BE LEFT
WITH A BAD AFTERTASTE OR...

244
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:36,416
OR SINCE HE'S DYING FROM A
TERMINAL ILLNESS ANYWAY...

245
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,250
- I'LL DO IT.

246
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,125
IT'S OUR JOB.

247
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,875
- ( inhales )

248
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,791
- I'LL KILL HIM.

249
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,041
- ( singing in Japanese )

250
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,125
- ( wind blowing )

251
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,500
- ( gasps )

252
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,375
- ( gunshot )

253
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,416
( casing bounces )

254
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:50,916
- ( meows )

255
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:03,583
- ( woman singing )
