1
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,625
- ( voices chanting )

2
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:42,875
- Woman: NOIR...

3
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:45,500
IT IS THE NAME
OF AN ANCIENT FATE--

4
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:48,833
TWO MAIDENS
WHO GOVERN DEATH.

5
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:51,750
TO WARD THE DARKNESS
FROM THE NURSING BABES

6
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:54,416
THEIR BLACK ROBES
SERVE AS SHIELDS.

7
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,583
- ( rain pattering )

8
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:07,250
- ( gasps )

9
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,250
- ( gunshots )
- ( groans )

10
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,916
- ( whimpering )

11
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,125
- ( birds chirping )
- ( child laughing )

12
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,250
- Man: MIREILLE.
- ( laughing continues )

13
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,208
- MIREILLE!

14
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,416
MIREILLE...

15
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,625
MIREILLE.
- HUH.

16
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,791
- HELLO, MIREILLE.

17
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,125
- ( gasps )
UNCLE CLAUDE?

18
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:55,375
- THAT'S RIGHT, MIREILLE.
- IT IS YOU!

19
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:56,875
UNCLE CLAUDE!

20
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,916
- 10 YEARS SINCE
WE LEFT CORSICA.

21
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,625
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, HUH?

22
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,541
- AND I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
FOR NEARLY HALF OF THAT.

23
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,208
- YEAH.

24
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,000
- SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN BACK IN PARIS?

25
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,708
- NOT VERY LONG.

26
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:17,041
I FOUND MYSELF MISSING
ALL SORTS OF THINGS

27
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,791
SO HERE I AM.

28
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,875
YOUR LATE FATHER,
HE WAS A GREAT MAN, YOU KNOW?

29
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,500
- UH-HUH.

30
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,625
- LAURENT BOUQUET...

31
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,541
HE WAS A TOUGH SYNDICATE LEADER

32
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,708
AND CARING FAMILY PATRIARCH.

33
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,750
- I KNOW.

34
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:38,125
- CORSICA WOULD BE A BETTER
PLACE IF HE STILL LIVED.

35
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:42,583
AND NEITHER YOU NOR I WOULD
HAVE BEEN DRIVEN INTO EXILE.

36
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,291
SO ARE YOU STILL
IN THE BUSINESS?

37
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,458
- I GUESS YOU COULD SAY THAT.

38
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,333
- I SEE.

39
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,541
- SO, AND YOU?
- ME?

40
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:59,000
- ARE YOU WORKING
HERE IN PARIS?

41
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,791
- WELL, THAT IS THE PLAN.

42
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,791
- ( foghorn blowing )

43
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,541
- Mireille: WITH THE DEATH
OF MY PARENTS,

44
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,708
THE BOUQUET FAMILY
AND SYNDICATE COLLAPSED.

45
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,666
THE DOMINION OF CORSICA
FELL TO THE HANDS

46
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,333
OF A RIVAL SYNDICATE,

47
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,000
AND HAVING LOST
MY HOME AND FUTURE,

48
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,750
I FLED THE COUNTRY
WITH MY UNCLE CLAUDE.

49
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,000
CLAUDE FEYDER...

50
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,291
MY UNCLE
ON MY MOTHER'S SIDE.

51
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,916
( sighs )

52
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,416
HE PLAYED WITH ME AND TOOK
CARE OF ME WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.

53
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,541
AND LATER HE TAUGHT ME
MY TRADE.

54
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,416
HE WAS QUITE A TASKMASTER.

55
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,000
HOPEFULLY I'LL GET
TO INTRODUCE YOU TWO.

56
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,083
- HE DOESN'T...

57
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,375
KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THE SOLDATS, DOES HE?

58
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,416
- ( scoffs )
OF COURSE HE DOESN'T KNOW!

59
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,666
IF HE KNOWN ANYTHING AT ALL,

60
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,375
HE WOULD HAVE TOLD ME
LONG AGO, WOULDN'T HE?

61
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,791
- OH, I GUESS THAT'S RIGHT.

62
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,208
UM, MIREILLE?
- YEAH?

63
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,666
- I AM HAPPY FOR YOU, HONESTLY.

64
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,916
- Man: SO HOW ARE THINGS
IN MARSEILLE?

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,666
- OH, YOU KNOW.
IT'S COMING ALONG.

66
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,958
WHAT ABOUT THINGS HERE?

67
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,791
- HMM?
- ( gasps )

68
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,708
- ( silenced gunshots )
- ( groaning )

69
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,083
- ( gunshot )
- ( moans )

70
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,875
- DO YOU REMEMBER

71
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,541
THAT WEEK AT THE LAKE?

72
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,083
- OH.

73
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:25,416
YOU MEAN THE ONE THAT
WE WENT TO WHEN I WAS LITTLE?

74
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,500
OF COURSE.

75
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:31,416
THAT WAS BACK WHEN
WE FIRST ARRIVED IN PARIS.

76
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,000
I WAS IN SUCH LOW SPIRITS.

77
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,333
BUT LIKE THE GOOD UNCLE
YOU WERE,

78
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,833
YOU WERE ALWAYS TRYING
TO CHEER ME UP, WEREN'T YOU?

79
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,583
- Claude: I WAS JUST THINKING

80
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:07,291
WHY DON'T WE GO BACK THERE?
- HUH?

81
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,791
- WHAT'S WRONG?
DON'T YOU WANT TO?

82
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,708
- OH NO,
IT SOUNDS WONDERFUL!

83
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:19,500
- WOULD YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT NOIR, MIREILLE?

84
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,000
- I'M AFRAID I DON'T.

85
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,041
- NOTHING, HUH?

86
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,541
- UM, BY NOIR,

87
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,375
YOU ARE REFERRING
TO THAT NOIR, RIGHT?

88
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,208
- YEAH.

89
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,000
- SO WHY DO YOU ASK?

90
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,041
- OH, IT'S NOTHING.
YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW.

91
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,750
- ( voices chanting )

92
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,583
- ( ship's horn blowing )

93
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,250
- ( panting )
- ( person whistling )

94
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,625
- GO!
- CUT HIM OFF!

95
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:34,625
- RIGHT!

96
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,125
- THERE WE GO.

97
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:24,958
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

98
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,250
- NO, IT'S NOTHING.

99
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:36,375
( sighs )
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT ANYWAY.

100
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:42,000
REALLY,
IT'S NOTHING AT ALL.

101
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:58,375
- WOULD YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT NOIR, MIREILLE?

102
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,291
- ( thinking ) WHY?

103
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,458
WHY WOULD HE WANT TO KNOW?

104
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,541
- ( knocks )
- YES?

105
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,875
MIREILLE, THESE JUST ARRIVED.

106
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,166
- THEY'RE A GIFT FROM MY UNCLE.

107
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,375
I THINK THAT THEY'RE FLOWERS
THAT HE GREW HIMSELF.

108
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,583
- HOW NICE FOR YOU.

109
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,125
- YEAH.

110
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,791
- HMM.
- YO,

111
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,458
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

112
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,916
- THANKS FOR COMING, FEYDER.
I'M GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT.

113
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,333
- AND I'M GLAD TO SEE
YOU'RE IN GOOD HEALTH, DUPOIS.

114
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,958
- GREAT GREAT.
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.

115
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,250
SO WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK?

116
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,666
- NO, I'M FINE.

117
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,833
- JUST HOW LONG HAVE
YOU BEEN BACK IN TOWN?

118
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,958
- OH, NOT LONG.
- HEY, WHAT ARE WE, STRANGERS?

119
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,666
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU DIDN'T
CONTACT ME SOONER?

120
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,166
- I HAD A LITTLE BUSINESS
TO TAKE CARE OF FIRST.

121
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,458
- AND WITH YOUR SKILLS,
YOU MUST BE WORKING QUITE A LOT.

122
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,541
TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST,

123
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,666
I HAD A LITTLE FAVOR
TO ASK OF YOU AS WELL.

124
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,625
- HMM, SUCH AS?

125
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,125
- WELL, AS YOU
PROBABLY KNOW...

126
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,125
( sighs )

127
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:03,541
THERE'S BEEN A RASH
OF ODD MURDERS RECENTLY.

128
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:07,000
- YEAH, ALL THE HITS
HAVE BEEN LOCAL BIG SHOTS.

129
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,833
- WELL, THE FACT IS

130
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:11,000
I'VE HAD A LOT OF DEALINGS
WITH THOSE PEOPLE,

131
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,708
SO I WANT YOU TO FIND OUT
WHO KILLED THEM.

132
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,333
- I SEE.

133
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,166
- WILL YOU DO IT?
- EASILY.

134
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,833
I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO CHECK.
- REALLY?!

135
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,458
YOU MEAN YOU ALREADY
HAVE SOME I--

136
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,625
- MM-HMM.

137
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,416
I'M THE ONE WHO KILLED THEM.

138
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,375
- THAT'S A CLASSIC, FEYDER!

139
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,208
I NEVER THOUGHT YOU HAD
A HUMOROUS BONE IN YOUR BODY,

140
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,666
BUT--
- ( gunshot, casing clatters )

141
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,625
- I'M SORRY, BUT THEIR ORDERS
WERE QUITE SPECIFIC.

142
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,791
- ( groans )
- ( glass shatters )

143
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,500
- AND THERE WAS
ONE MORE THING...

144
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:57,083
I'M AFRAID THAT YOUR NAME WAS ON
THEIR LIST AS WELL, MY FRIEND.

145
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,666
- ( phone rings )

146
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,458
- Mireille: YES?

147
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,166
OH, UNCLE!

148
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,583
THANK YOU FOR THE FLOWERS.

149
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,583
YES, THEY'RE WONDERFUL.

150
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,250
UH-HUH.
I LOVE THEM!

151
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,708
HUH?
YOU MEAN RIGHT NOW?

152
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,583
NO NO, I CAN MAKE IT.

153
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,625
- ( people chattering )

154
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:32,958
- ( car honks )

155
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,750
- Mireille: WOW!

156
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,250
- WELL, NO NEED FOR CEREMONY.
COME ON IN.

157
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,250
THIS WAY, MIREILLE.

158
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:14,125
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
AREN'T THEY SOMETHING?

159
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,041
RAISE THEM WITH LOVE
AND FLOWERS WILL RESPOND.

160
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:20,166
THOUGH I MUST ADMIT,
SOMETIMES I FAIL.

161
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,791
- UNCLE CLAUDE,
YOU DIDN'T BRING ME HERE

162
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,333
JUST TO SHOW ME
YOUR FLOWERS, DID YOU?

163
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,916
- THEY SAY THAT IF YOU TALK TO
FLOWERS, THEY'LL OFTEN GROW--

164
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
- ANSWER ME.
- ALL RIGHT.

165
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,791
I'M WORKING ON A BIG JOB
RIGHT NOW.

166
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,750
- AND YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU,
IS THAT IT?

167
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:35,750
- NO.

168
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,125
I WANT YOU TO STAND BACK
AND WATCH.

169
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,833
- JUST WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

170
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,041
UH.

171
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,041
- THAT'S RIGHT,
YOUR LITTLE ROOMMATE.

172
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:53,791
- WHICH MEANS YOUR RUNNING INTO
ME WASN'T AN ACCIDENT, WAS IT?

173
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,500
YOU MUST HAVE HAD THIS IN MIND
RIGHT FROM THE START.

174
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,625
SO YOU LIED...

175
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,791
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

176
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,958
- BUT YOU LIED TO ME
AS WELL, MIREILLE.

177
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,541
NOIR-- YOU SAID YOU
DIDN'T KNOW HER.

178
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,583
YOU KNOW, I COULD HAVE
TAKEN CARE OF THIS

179
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:15,916
WITHOUT TELLING YOU,

180
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,583
BUT I FELT I OWED YOU THE
PROFESSIONAL COURTESY.

181
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,458
- YOU'RE WORKING

182
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,083
FOR THE SOLDATS.

183
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,625
- YOU MEAN YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE SOLDATS?!

184
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:28,166
- ( gasps ) YOU ARE.

185
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,541
AREN'T YOU?

186
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,250
- IT'S IN OUR BEST INTERESTS.

187
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,041
FOR YOUR SAKE AND MINE,
I HAVE TO.

188
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:39,166
IF I DON'T FINISH THIS JOB,

189
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,375
THE SOLDATS WILL CRUSH ME.

190
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,333
JUST AS THEY CRUSHED
YOUR FATHER.

191
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,583
- ( gasps )

192
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,916
- THAT'S RIGHT.

193
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,208
LAURENT BOUQUET WAS KILLED
FOR DEFYING THE SOLDATS,

194
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:58,041
TOGETHER WITH HIS WIFE
AND SON.

195
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,208
- AND YOU KNEW THAT?

196
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,916
YOU KNEW THAT ALL THIS TIME
AND YOU NEVER TOLD ME?

197
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,666
ANSWER ME!
- YOU MUST NOT

198
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,166
TRY TO LEARN MORE
ABOUT THE SOLDATS.

199
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,041
I SWORE AN OATH
TO THEM, MIREILLE.

200
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,875
I SWORE THAT I WOULD
ALWAYS FOLLOW THEIR ORDERS

201
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,458
WITHOUT QUESTION.
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON

202
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,208
I WAS ABLE TO LEAVE
CORSICA ALIVE WITH YOU.

203
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:25,375
WE LIVE BUT BY THEIR GRACE.
- ( gasps )

204
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,625
- SO NOW YOU KNOW THE TRUTH

205
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,916
AND HOW TERRIBLE THEY ARE.

206
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,583
OH.

207
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,541
THIS ONE'S
NO GOOD ANYMORE.

208
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:41,125
WE ARE MUCH FRAILER
THAN THESE FLOWERS, MIREILLE.

209
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:45,041
ONCE THE SOLDATS SINK
THEIR ROOTS INTO YOUR SOUL,

210
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:48,541
YOU CAN NEVER ESCAPE.
NO ONE HAS, NOT EVER.

211
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,541
PLEASE DON'T MAKE THE SAME

212
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,125
FOOLISH MISTAKE
YOUR FATHER MADE, MIREILLE.

213
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,625
TRUST ME.

214
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,625
- ( voices chanting )

215
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,166
- I UNDERSTAND.

216
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,375
- DO YOU?

217
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,958
- I'LL BRING HER BACK
HERE WITH ME TONIGHT.

218
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,166
- THAT'S PERFECT.

219
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,208
AND ONCE ALL OF THIS
HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF,

220
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,166
LET'S GO TO THAT LAKE.

221
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,166
THE WATER'S NEVER CLEARER
THAN IT IS RIGHT NOW.

222
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,500
- ALL RIGHT.

223
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,125
- ( zips )
I'M GOING OUT FOR A BIT, OKAY?

224
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,500
- GOING WHERE?
- JUST A LITTLE ERRAND.

225
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,083
YOU DON'T NEED TO TAG ALONG.

226
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,875
- ( door opens )

227
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,583
( closes )

228
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,791
- ( sighs )

229
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,458
DIDN'T I JUST SAY
NOT TO TAG ALONG?

230
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,541
GO HOME, OKAY?
- NO.

231
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,916
- I SAID GO HOME.

232
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,208
- AND I SAID NO.

233
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,166
- ( huffs )

234
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,750
- SO YOU'RE STILL GOING?

235
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,916
WHY?

236
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,083
- YOU'RE A LITTLE LATE.

237
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,416
- WHERE'S MY UNCLE?

238
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,041
- OH, HE'S IN THE GREENHOUSE.

239
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:28,208
- DO YOU WANT ME TO CALL
MR. FEYDER FOR YOU?

240
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,583
- NO THANKS,
I KNOW THE WAY ALREADY.

241
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,375
- GO RIGHT AHEAD THEN.
( chuckles )

242
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:36,833
- HMM.

243
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:51,541
- Man: HMMM.

244
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,000
- ( grunts )
- ( gunshot )

245
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,208
- ( gasps )
- ( groaning )

246
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,208
- YOU LITTLE BITCH!
- ( gunshot )

247
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,333
- ( birds chirping )

248
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,666
- UNCLE?
- HUH?

249
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,583
- WE CAN'T GO
BACK TO THAT LAKE.

250
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,875
I'M SO SORRY.

251
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:25,958
- IT WOULD SEEM

252
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:29,375
THAT YOU'RE LAURENT BOUQUET'S
DAUGHTER TO THE END.

253
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,291
- ( sighs )

254
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:02,750
( woman singing )
