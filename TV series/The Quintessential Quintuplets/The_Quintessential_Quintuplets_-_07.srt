Good thinking.

481
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:02,375
The most effective time
for studying

482
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,750
is after you receive
the results from a big exam.

483
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:08,375
But, it doesn't have
to be right after.

484
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:10,666
How about a reward?

485
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:13,458
You requested parfaits, right?

486
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,125
[QUINTUPLETS laughing]

487
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:23,625
[ICHIKA]
Futaro wants a parfait!

488
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:26,000
I know, that isn't
like him at all!

489
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:30,708
Okay, I'll have one. Jumbo size.

490
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,166
[FUTARO]
Is that a real thing?

491
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:37,500
All right, since you
each passed one subject,

492
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,166
you each get one serving.

493
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,166
Come on!
Cheapskate.

494
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:45,125
[FUTARO] I'll make it happen,
just wait and see.

495
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:48,125
Hey, Uesugi, we never saw
your midterm results!

497
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:52,083
Hey! I didn't say
you could look at those!

498
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:54,000
[YOTSUBA]
What the... All hundreds?

499
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:56,333
[FUTARO]
Oh, man, I'm so embarrassed!

500
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,958
[ITSUKI] Are you trying to make
that your catchphrase or what?

501
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:02,291
[QUINTUPLETS]
Quintuplet Trivia!

502
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:03,791
[ICHIKA] What are
our best subjects? Math!

503
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,333
-[NINO] English.
-[MIKU] History.

504
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:06,583
-[YOTSUBA] Japanese!
-[ITSUKI] Science.

505
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:08,375
And together,
the five of us are...

506
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:10,333
[QUINTUPLETS]
The super No-fail Sisters!

507
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,166
[FUTARO] Would you stop
fantasizing and study?

508
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,833
[QUINTUPLETS]
No-Fail Sisters, go!
