Wow.

474
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:20,083
Well, I can tell who got all
the good looks in your family!

475
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,666
Think you could
set me up with him?

476
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:25,916
Maybe. Eventually.

477
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,666
[NINO]
Oh, yeah!

478
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,583
My sisters and I used to be
adorable little angels

479
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,208
back in the day, too.

480
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:36,125
See? Hey, look at it.

481
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:39,750
Not interested, huh?

482
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:42,375
I think I'll go show it to
the girls for old times' sake.

483
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:46,666
That was close.

484
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,916
Oh. Done already?

485
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,791
Well, I gave it
some more thought,

486
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,791
and I decided
I shouldn't rush it.

487
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,500
As long as I have pierced ears

488
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:01,083
by the time I'm wearing
my wedding dress, I'll be happy.

489
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:05,375
Anyway, check out
this blast from the past!

490
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:08,041
[YOTSUBA] Oh, wow,
we look so young there!

491
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,416
[FUTARO] Well, she ended up
seeing my photo.

492
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:14,000
Good thing it was only half.

493
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:16,083
[YOTSUBA]
Aw, we were so adorable!

494
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:17,750
[ICHIKA]
When was this taken?

495
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,416
[MIKU]
In sixth grade.

496
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:23,625
[ICHIKA]
This was Kyoto,

497
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:25,458
so it must have been
from our school trip.

498
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:28,875
[FUTARO]
Five years, huh?

499
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,416
The color's fading a little.

500
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,041
[YOTSUBA]
This takes me back!

501
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,250
[ITSUKI]
We've really changed a lot

502
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,916
since those days, haven't we?

503
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:52,500
[FUTARO]
I hope we meet again.

504
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,875
[QUINTUPLETS]
Quintuplet Trivia!

505
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,291
[MIKU]
Yotsuba's the sporty one.

506
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,625
[NINO]
But does she know all the rules?

507
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:05,958
[YOTSUBA]
Huh? Sure I do!

508
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:07,500
[ICHIKA] What are the rules
for basketball?

509
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:08,750
[YOTSUBA]
Put the ball in the basket,

510
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:09,708
and you get two or three points!

511
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:11,083
[MIKU]
That's it?

512
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:12,750
Oh, and after practice,
you always eat a snack!

513
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:14,583
[NINO] I don't think
that's a requirement!
