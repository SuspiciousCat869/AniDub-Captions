00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,875
is kind of obnoxious.

479
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,458
Maeda won't like it,

480
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:13,916
but you can deal
with that, right?

481
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,375
I mean, think about it.

482
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:18,208
If people saw you
dancing with me,

483
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,458
that probably wouldn't be
very good for your reputation,

484
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:21,666
would it?

485
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,791
Huh? You're crying!

486
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:33,916
Oh gosh.

487
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:37,625
I'm okay. Really.

488
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:39,375
Can I put this thing
down, though?

489
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:45,333
[GIRL 3] Come on! Let's get this
done and head back to the inn.

490
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:50,541
[GIRL 4] Oh wait.
Someone already moved them.

491
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,125
[GIRL 3]
Looks that way.

492
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,250
They made really good time!

493
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,416
-Yeah.
-[YOTSUBA] Excuse me!

494
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:03,166
Have either of you
seen Uesugi around here?

495
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,458
[GIRL 3]
Wait. Uesugi?

496
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:07,166
-Um...
-[GIRL 4] Haven't seen him.

497
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:10,875
Aw, man. This brings
back memories, doesn't it?

498
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,708
Is there a reason
we're hiding though?

499
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:15,625
[YOTSUBA]
Yeah...

500
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:17,666
[FUTARO]
Be nice. Right.

501
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:25,875
Nobody can see now.

502
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:32,208
Uh... that's a weird thing
to say, huh?

503
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,333
[lock clicks]

504
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,833
-Hold on.
-Was that...

505
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,416
[FUTARO]
It's not locked though, right?

506
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,458
Surely not.

507
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:46,208
[ICHIKA]
Wasn't there a key here?

508
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
[laughter]

509
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,041
[FUTARO]
Well, that just happened.

510
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,208
[QUINTUPLETS]
Quintuplet Trivia!

511
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,416
[ICHIKA] So that blonde guy's
your type, huh, Nino?

512
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,125
[NINO]
Hair dye is against the rules.

513
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:07,666
[MIKU]
He looks trashy.

514
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,375
[ICHIKA] I bet he doesn't have
any kind of future.

515
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:10,708
[NINO]
I know, right?

516
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:12,416
I guess I'll end up
supporting him, won't I?

517
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,500
[awkward laughter]
