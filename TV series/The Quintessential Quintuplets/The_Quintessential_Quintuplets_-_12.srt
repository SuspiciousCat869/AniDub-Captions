478
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,333
Let's go.

479
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:11,000
Are you feeling better
this morning?

480
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:14,500
Oh yeah. Now to make up for all
the time I lost in the hospital.

481
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,666
You can keep that for a while,
if you want.

482
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,000
-Sorry, did you say something?
-Not me.

483
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:23,875
Hey, Itsuki, do you have
to do that now?

484
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:26,875
I just get really hungry
in the mornings, okay?

485
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:30,458
I know! We should celebrate
Futaro's recovery!

486
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:32,250
How about we go
to the crepe shop--

487
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,208
Study! That's a great idea!

488
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,166
-[MIKU] Futaro.
-Hmm?

489
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,791
You're a big help.
Please stay a long time.

490
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:44,500
Studying again today?
Okay, let's do this!

491
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,875
Hold on.
I never agreed to study with--

492
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:50,041
Fine, I guess the rest of us can
get together without you, then.

493
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,250
Well, I mean, it's not like
I said no, either!

494
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:53,541
[ITSUKI]
Uesugi...

495
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:56,958
our success is in your hands.

496
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:01,166
That's right. And the finals
are coming up soon,

497
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,916
so I won't go easy on you!

498
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,958
-Oh, um, okay?
-Whoa, hey.

499
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:08,250
[FUTARO]
You better get ready!

500
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:09,958
-[NINO] Run!
-[screaming, laughing]

501
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:11,708
[FUTARO]
Come back here!

502
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:13,625
[YOTSUBA]
You sucker!
