00:00:18,567 --> 00:00:20,650
[FUTARO]
I was having a dream...

00:00:22,858 --> 00:00:25,150
[WOMAN]
Please wake up now, sir.

4
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:27,150
Your bride is ready
and waiting for you.

[FUTARO groans]

6
00:00:29,983 --> 00:00:31,150
[FUTARO]
A dream about

7
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:34,150
the incredible day
that brought us together.

8
00:00:37,983 --> 00:00:39,567
One barbecue combo.

9
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,150
And hold the barbecue.

10
00:00:41,233 --> 00:00:42,400
[LUNCH LADY]
Comin' up.

11
00:00:42,483 --> 00:00:43,775
[FUTARO]
You'd think the cheapest thing

12
00:00:43,858 --> 00:00:46,983
on the cafeteria menu
would be rice, but it's not.

13
00:00:47,067 --> 00:00:50,150
You save 200 yen if you skip
the beef in the combo.

14
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:54,358
It's rice, soup, and veggies
for the same cost as just rice.

15
00:00:56,442 --> 00:00:58,067
[FUTARO]
And the water's free!

16
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,817
I love this place.

17
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,942
Eating alone, as always. Heh.

18
00:01:02,025 --> 00:01:04,317
That loser!

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,025
[FUTARO]
Hmph.

20
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,275
Uh.

00:01:11,442 --> 00:01:12,858
Huh?

[STUDENT A]
Hey, who's that girl?

24
00:02:51,442 --> 00:02:53,025
[STUDENT AA]
She's sitting with Uesugi?

25
00:02:53,108 --> 00:02:54,317
[STUDENT B]
No one does that!

26
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,108
[FUTARO]
That's not our uniform.

27
00:02:57,192 --> 00:03:00,900
Wait, how did this happen?

28
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:03,108
[ITSUKI] I found this
spot before you did.

29
00:03:03,192 --> 00:03:05,067
The next table is wide open.

30
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,567
I think you should move.

31
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,400
This is the table
that I sit at every day!

32
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:10,400
Why don't you move?

00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:11,817
[ITSUKI gasps]

34
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:15,983
[STUDENT BB] Look, Uesugi's
eating lunch with a girl!

35
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:18,275
Is she stupid?

36
00:03:18,358 --> 00:03:20,983
Tch. Seriously?

37
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,358
[FUTARO]
She's all red.

38
00:03:25,442 --> 00:03:27,900
You could've switched seats.

00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:29,817
[FUTARO gasps]

40
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,400
[FUTARO]
250 for udon.

41
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:33,692
Two shrimp tempura
would be 300.

42
00:03:33,775 --> 00:03:36,192
The other varieties of tempura
cost a 100 yen each.

43
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:38,817
Add the pudding and that's--

44
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,025
Who just drops a
thousand yen on lunch?!

45
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:45,525
Well, you do you.

46
00:03:46,608 --> 00:03:48,233
Time to eat.

47
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,275
Uh?

48
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,025
[ITSUKI] That's a little rude,
don't you think?

49
00:03:58,317 --> 00:04:00,358
You're studying
in the middle of lunch?

50
00:04:00,442 --> 00:04:03,942
I'm reviewing my exam.
Leave me alone, jeez.

51
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:07,858
Wow, you must have gotten
a pretty rotten grade, huh?

52
00:04:07,942 --> 00:04:09,442
Can I take a look?

53
00:04:09,525 --> 00:04:10,733
Ah! Hey!

54
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:14,942
Let's see, Mr. Futaro Uesugi.
You scored a--

55
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:16,400
[gasps]

56
00:04:16,483 --> 00:04:18,442
[ITSUKI]
A... hundred?

57
00:04:19,442 --> 00:04:20,442
Is this real?

58
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:23,233
Oh, no! I'm so embarrassed!

59
00:04:23,317 --> 00:04:25,608
You wanted me to see it!

60
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,983
[ITSUKI] I hate to admit it, but
I'm not good at school stuff.

61
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:33,442
I envy you.

62
00:04:33,525 --> 00:04:36,150
You know, it must've been fate
that brought us together!

63
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:38,025
Do you wanna help me study?

64
00:04:38,108 --> 00:04:39,608
Well, this has been great.

65
00:04:39,692 --> 00:04:42,983
Uh! You're already done?

66
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:46,358
You didn't eat much.
Are you sure you got enough?

67
00:04:46,442 --> 00:04:49,442
If you want more,
I'd be happy to share mine.

68
00:04:49,525 --> 00:04:52,942
If anything, you ordered
way too much food.

69
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:54,275
Don't get fat.

70
00:04:54,358 --> 00:04:55,817
What the--?!

71
00:04:56,817 --> 00:04:58,692
I think you might be
the most insensitive person

--I've met in my entire life!
--[phone ringing]

I'm not sharing
anything with you!

74
00:05:04,858 --> 00:05:07,067
[FUTARO]
A chance to pay off our debt?

75
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,608
[RAIHA] Yeah, Dad found
a part-time job for you.

76
00:05:09,692 --> 00:05:12,400
A super-rich family
just moved here.

77
00:05:12,483 --> 00:05:15,858
They're looking to hire a tutor.
What do you think?

78
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:17,317
[FUTARO]
A tutor, huh?

79
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,858
You would get to work
in a nice fancy house.

80
00:05:19,942 --> 00:05:22,608
And it pays five times
the going rate.

81
00:05:22,692 --> 00:05:24,442
[FUTARO]
That sounds like a sketchy deal

82
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:25,650
if I'm being honest.

83
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:27,525
Well, selling a kidney
is sketchy, too,

84
00:05:27,608 --> 00:05:29,317
but you only need one to live.

85
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,525
Whoa, what are you suggesting?

86
00:05:30,608 --> 00:05:31,733
[RAIHA laughs]

87
00:05:31,817 --> 00:05:33,567
[RAIHA]
It's a joke.

88
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,942
But if you do do it,

89
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:37,692
then you'll be able to afford
some actual meals.

90
00:05:37,775 --> 00:05:39,858
It's worth a try.

[stomach growls]

92
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:46,233
[FUTARO] So, do we know anything
about who I'm tutoring?

93
00:05:46,317 --> 00:05:48,567
[RAIHA]
Hmm... High school age?

94
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,108
In fact, I'm pretty sure he said
you were gonna be classmates.

95
00:05:52,192 --> 00:05:54,733
What was the name? Nakano?

96
00:05:54,817 --> 00:05:56,108
Itsuki Nakano.

Obviously, it's her.

But if she rejects me again,

then I'll lose the job
of a lifetime!

on her good side.

Hello again.

Could I have the honor
of dining with you today?

Oh? So she is
the one that you like!

[ICHIKA giggles]

132
00:07:24,483 --> 00:07:26,692
So what is it about her
you're attracted to?

133
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:29,775
Let me guess:
It's her serious side!

134

I know! I'll go tell
her to come over!

I don't need anyone's help.

alone to solve.

Wow, that was so manly!

You know, for a nerd.

142
00:07:45,442 --> 00:07:46,775
But if you ever do need help,

143
00:07:46,858 --> 00:07:49,317
you can just ask
your Big Sis Ichika.

This is gonna be fun.

Hold on, "Big Sis"?

Well, it's a long story.

162
00:08:33,692 --> 00:08:34,942
[YOTSUBA]
Earlier...

163
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:36,858
...that happened.

164
00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:39,067
And then, I noticed it.

165
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:42,067
And now, here we are!

166
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,775
So, which one is yours?

167
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:45,650
[FUTARO]
This one.

168
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,942
Wow! You're such an honest guy!

169
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:50,317
I'll give you both as a reward!

170
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,067
[FUTARO]
That's okay.

171
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,108
What idiot got a zero?

172
00:08:54,192 --> 00:08:55,608
You're lookin' right at her!

173
00:08:55,692 --> 00:08:57,817
[FUTARO] And you're not
even embarrassed?!

174
00:08:59,858 --> 00:09:01,942
[YOTSUBA] You know,
when I first saw you,

175
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:05,108
I thought you were nothin'
but a grumpy, boring old loner.

176
00:09:05,192 --> 00:09:08,192
Now I know that you're all that
and a super-genius!

177
00:09:08,275 --> 00:09:09,233
That was quick!

178
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:12,525
[BOYS]
Uh...

179
00:09:12,608 --> 00:09:16,442
[grunting]

180
00:09:16,525 --> 00:09:18,233
Are you still following me?!

181
00:09:18,317 --> 00:09:20,650
Well, yeah, you haven't
said "thank you" yet.

182
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:21,858
What?!

183
00:09:21,942 --> 00:09:22,983
[YOTSUBA] When someone
picks up your stuff,

184
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:24,650
you thank them.

185
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:28,400
You'd think a super-genius
would know something like that.

186
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:31,400
[FUTARO]
Here, I picked this up for you.

187
00:09:31,483 --> 00:09:32,942
Now, we're even.

188
00:09:34,817 --> 00:09:37,192
Yeah! Thanks so much
for your help!

189
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:39,317
[FUTARO]
Don't thank me for that!

190
00:09:42,608 --> 00:09:43,817
[FUTARO]
I don't know why I thought

191
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,275
she'd walk home by herself.

192
00:09:46,358 --> 00:09:47,983
[NINO]
Itsuki, aren't you eating a lot?

193
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:49,442
It's not that much.

194
00:09:49,525 --> 00:09:51,733
This is only my second one.

195
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,275
[NINO]
Look out, it's the bun monster!

196
00:09:55,358 --> 00:09:57,900
Ah! Hey, get off of my case!

197
00:09:57,983 --> 00:09:59,608
[NINO] You're gonna
scare the boys away!

198
00:09:59,692 --> 00:10:01,608
[ITSUKI]
Mind your own business!

199
00:10:01,692 --> 00:10:03,775
When am I gonna apologize?

200
00:10:03,858 --> 00:10:05,983
[MIKU]
Is it fun being alone?

201
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:07,483
Uh...

202
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:11,858
Uh, it's not bad.
This is my hobby.

203
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:12,942
[MIKU]
I see.

204
00:10:13,025 --> 00:10:16,150
Staring at girls
is your hobby, huh?

205
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:17,900
Just a second.

206
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,150
Please don't
call the cops on me.

207
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:22,692
And please don't tell
your friend Itsuki about this.

208
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:24,442
Fine, I won't.

209
00:10:24,525 --> 00:10:28,400
Also, that girl is
in no way my friend.

210
00:10:28,483 --> 00:10:29,608
[FUTARO]
Huh?

211
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:34,567
[groans]

212
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,942
[FUTARO]
She lives here?

213
00:10:37,025 --> 00:10:39,275
How rich can one person be?

214
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:43,483
But this is it.
At least, I think it is.

[grunts]

217
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:50,608
[NINO] What are you,
some kind of stalker?

218
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,733
State your name and
business, or get lost.

219
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,608
My business has nothing
to do with you.

220
00:10:56,692 --> 00:10:58,942
I'll decide that.

221
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,317
Listen, nobody likes you.

222
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,025
So go home already, scum!

223
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:06,608
[FUTARO]
I'd love to.

224
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:08,233
But this building is my home.

225
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:11,025
[ITSUKI]
Uh, really? I'm sorry!

hold the barbecue.

Huh?!

Are you on a diet?

Huh?

00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:21,817
Uh! Hey, you!

00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,025
I knew it!

232
00:11:24,108 --> 00:11:25,358
[FUTARO]
Found her!

233
00:11:25,442 --> 00:11:28,108
This is my last
chance to fix it!

[FUTARO]
This whole thing is her fault!

239
00:11:45,192 --> 00:11:47,775
I shouldn't have to apologize
for any of this crap!

240

It's her fault that I'm tired
and sweaty from running.

It's her fault that those
weirdos keep harassing me.

Hey, you're that guy
from school.

What could be so important

247
00:12:08,817 --> 00:12:11,317
that you would follow me
all the way home?

[FUTARO]
About yesterday...

249
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,983
Huh? Yesterday?

250
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,150
What are you even
doing here, anyway?

251
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:21,025
I told you. You see, I-I was--

Never mind, I don't care.

Wait, listen to me!

No, you listen! You're starting
to get on my nerves!

I have a meeting with my
tutor in a few minutes,

256
00:12:28,817 --> 00:12:30,275
so if could you
please leave alre--

What?!

Your new tutor. It's me.

No way, I refuse!

00:12:44,317 --> 00:12:45,858
[FUTARO]
I hate it, too!

00:12:45,942 --> 00:12:47,775
Much more than you do!

00:12:47,858 --> 00:12:51,108
But... I'm still
not gonna give up.

266
00:12:51,192 --> 00:12:56,067
Yesterday, I was totally in
the wrong, and I'm sorry.

00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,442
But that changes now!

Starting today...
I'm your partner!

[ITSUKI]
This can't be right.

270
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:06,733
It's not fair!

271
00:13:06,817 --> 00:13:10,483
Why does our tutor have
to be you, of all people?

272
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:12,650
[FUTARO]
Did you say "our"?

273
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:15,442
[ICHIKA] I can't believe
there was a creeper

Hey there, Mr. Honor Roll!

That's him, he's the stalker!

Don't assume things.

[FUTARO]
Why are you all here?!

'Cause this is where
we live, obviously.

[FUTARO]

286
00:13:41,192 --> 00:13:45,108
Oh, I see. You share a fancy
condo with all your girlfriends.

under heavy duress

and overclocked past
its manufacturer limit,

289

reached the only
logical conclusion

290
00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:53,900
that it could possibly muster.

291
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:57,275
A dream. This is
definitely a dream.

292

Could you do me a quick
favor and scowl at me?

Yup, they're related.

307
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:39,983
[FUTARO]
So, why are you here?

308
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:42,983
Obviously, it's time to start
our first tutoring session.

309

Where else would I be?!

be such a pain.

you don't make her too angry!

00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:12,525
[ITSUKI]
Not a chance.

321
00:15:12,608 --> 00:15:15,817
What's the point of a tutor
who's in the same class as I am?

322
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,317
There has to be someone
in this city

323
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,608
better qualified
for the position than you are.

324
00:15:19,692 --> 00:15:20,733
What gives?

325
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:23,067
Yesterday, you wanted
me to help you!

326
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,567
Well, I was wrong.

327
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,608
It's not happening.

328
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:27,733
[YOTSUBA giggles nervously]

329
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:29,025
With five of us,

330
00:15:29,108 --> 00:15:31,150
there's bound to be
at least one disagreement.

331
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:33,317
Miku's the smartest one here.

332
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,608
She'll come down.

333
00:15:35,692 --> 00:15:38,692
I'm sure you'll get
along fine with her.

334
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:41,108
No.

335
00:15:41,192 --> 00:15:43,650
Honestly, why does
it have to be you?

336
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:45,567
There has to be someone
in this city better--

337
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:48,483
[FUTARO]
Yup, I've heard that already.

338
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:51,775
Um, maybe we should move on?

339
00:15:51,858 --> 00:15:54,983
Nino can hit it off with
anybody, so you'll be fine!

340
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:57,692
She's like a social butterfly!

341
00:15:57,775 --> 00:16:01,608
Uh, but I guess
she stepped out?

342
00:16:01,692 --> 00:16:03,650
Uh, you don't need
to worry, though!

343
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:05,692
We still gotta go see Ichika!

344
00:16:05,775 --> 00:16:07,567
She's really...

345
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,733
Uh...

346
00:16:09,817 --> 00:16:11,775
[FUTARO]
What's with the pause?

347
00:16:11,858 --> 00:16:13,817
[YOTSUBA]
Don't freak out, okay?

348
00:16:15,067 --> 00:16:16,192
[FUTARO gasps]

349
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:19,900
It's like some kind
of disaster area!

350
00:16:19,983 --> 00:16:22,567
An actual human lives in here?

351
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,775
[ICHIKA]
Stop talking about my room

352
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:29,400
like it's this disgusting
wasteland full of toxic sludge.

353
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:34,233
[YOTSUBA]
Ugh, this place is a wreck!

354
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:35,567
[ICHIKA]
Wow, I wasn't expecting you

355
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,775
to be our mysterious new tutor.

356
00:16:37,858 --> 00:16:39,650
That's why you
were after Itsuki.

357
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:42,275
Forget that. Come on,
let's go downstairs.

358
00:16:42,358 --> 00:16:44,275
Whoa! That's a bad idea!

359
00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:45,483
[gasps]

360

[ICHIKA giggles]

361
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:49,150
[ICHIKA]
I'm kinda naked here.

362
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:51,025
[FUTARO]
Wha--? But why?

363
00:16:51,108 --> 00:16:52,483
[ICHIKA]
Yotsuba?

364
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:54,942
There should be some clothes
near your feet somewhere.

365
00:16:55,025 --> 00:16:57,525
[YOTSUBA]
Uh, let's see.

366
00:16:57,608 --> 00:16:58,983
[FUTARO]
Good grief.

367
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:01,358
When was the last time you
used this desk for studying?

368
00:17:01,442 --> 00:17:04,150
[ICHIKA] Ugh! Studying
this, studying that.

369
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,525
I hope you're not always this
concerned about your schoolwork

370
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,858
when you're in a bedroom
with a cute, naked girl.

371
00:17:08,942 --> 00:17:10,525
--[FUTARO] Ugh...
--Here we go!

372
00:17:10,608 --> 00:17:14,567
Just get dressed and come to the
living room when you're done.

373
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,233
Honestly...

374
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,650
What was your name again?
Futaro? I have a question.

375
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:24,233
[FUTARO]
Huh?

376
00:17:24,317 --> 00:17:27,025
It seems I'm missing
part of my P.E. uniform.

377
00:17:27,108 --> 00:17:29,233
A red track jacket.

378
00:17:29,317 --> 00:17:32,525
That's too bad.
I haven't seen it.

379
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:34,817
[MIKU]
It was here before.

380
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,150
Right up until you came in.

381
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:40,358
Did you--?

382
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:41,275
No!

383
00:17:41,358 --> 00:17:42,775
[NINO]
Hey!

384
00:17:42,858 --> 00:17:46,150
I made way too many
cookies. Want some?

385
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,900
[FUTARO] Good, at least
I've got four of you here.

386
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:53,150
Well! Time to hit the--

387
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:54,733
[ICHICKA]
Ooh, yum!

388
00:17:54,817 --> 00:17:55,900
What flavor is this?

389
00:17:55,983 --> 00:17:57,942
[MIKU] Why are you wearing
my track jacket?

390
00:17:58,025 --> 00:18:00,775
[NINO] I was baking and I didn't
wanna get my outfit dirty.

391
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:02,275
Take it off right now.

392
00:18:02,358 --> 00:18:04,067
[NINO]
Hey, let go of me!

393
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,233
[MIKU]
Give it back!

394
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:08,400
[NINO] You can have it
later, calm down!

395
00:18:08,483 --> 00:18:09,733
[YOTSUBA]
Uesugi!

396
00:18:09,817 --> 00:18:13,608
Don't worry about me!
I'm already studying hard!

[FUTARO groans]

398
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:17,150
[NINO] It's Saturday, we should
go somewhere fun!

399
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:18,442
Oh, did I get a package?

400
00:18:18,525 --> 00:18:20,150
[FUTARO]
They're hopeless!

401
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,817
What am I supposed
to do with them?!

402
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,025
[NINO]
You don't like cookies?

403
00:18:25,108 --> 00:18:28,525
Uh? No, I'm just
not in the mood.

404
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,317
You don't have
to be so nervous.

405
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,442
It's not like
I poisoned them, you know.

406
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:35,942
Have some and I'll study with
you, does that sound good?

[FUTARO grunts]

408
00:18:40,983 --> 00:18:43,608
[NINO] Wow! You're really
scarfing them down!

409
00:18:43,692 --> 00:18:45,483
You like them?

410
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:47,233
Yeah! They're awesome!

411
00:18:47,317 --> 00:18:50,442
Aw, thanks!

412
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:53,525
Oh, there's something
I meant to tell you!

413
00:18:53,608 --> 00:18:57,275
None of us need a tutor,
so you should probably go away.

414

[MIKU]
Uh.

Here, have some water.

Uh, good idea, thank you.

[FUTARO] Damn. I'm not surprised
that they're slacking off.

419
00:19:11,858 --> 00:19:14,775
But they need to graduate!

00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:13,275
[ISANARI]
I gotta say, I didn't think

480
00:21:13,358 --> 00:21:15,192
I'd live to see the day
you brought a girl home!

481
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:16,733
So, Big Brother?

482
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,942
[FUTARO]
Huh?

483
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:19,858
[RAIHA] How was
your first day of tutoring?

484
00:21:19,942 --> 00:21:21,400
[BOTH gasp]

485
00:21:22,442 --> 00:21:23,567
Well, actually, he--

486
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,025
Of course everything
went perfectly!

487
00:21:26,108 --> 00:21:27,150
Why'd you say that?

488
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:29,483
Just lie. Don't make her sad.

489
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:30,442
What's wrong?

490
00:21:30,525 --> 00:21:32,025
[FUTARO]
Huh?! Nothing!

491
00:21:32,108 --> 00:21:34,108
[ITSUKI]
Yeah! Everything's great!

492
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,233
Ah... I'm so happy to hear that.

493
00:21:36,317 --> 00:21:39,192
Maybe now we can finally
take care of all our debt.

494
00:21:39,275 --> 00:21:41,067
[FUTARO] Not in front
of the guest, Raiha.

495
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,025
[RAIHA]
Oh, sorry.

496
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,483
[ITSUKI]
Thanks for the meal.

497
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:46,358
[ISANARI]
Sure.

498
00:21:46,442 --> 00:21:50,400
You, too. It was lovely. Huh?

499
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:51,608
[RAIHA]
Itsuki?

500
00:21:51,692 --> 00:21:53,025
[ITSUKI]
Yes?

501
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:55,900
I know my big brother's
a stuck-up scumbag loser jerk

502
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:56,775
and everything...

503
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:58,650
Uh, hey...

504
00:21:58,733 --> 00:22:00,483
[RAIHA]
...but he's good in some ways.

505
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:01,608
[gasps]

506
00:22:01,692 --> 00:22:03,567
What I wanna say is...

507
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:07,108
...will you come here
again sometime?

508
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,525
[chuckles]

509
00:22:08,608 --> 00:22:10,525
[ITSUKI]
Of course I will!

510
00:22:10,608 --> 00:22:12,942
Using my brain
makes me super hungry!

511
00:22:13,025 --> 00:22:15,483
I'm looking forward
to the next time!

512
00:22:16,733 --> 00:22:19,150
[ITSUKI]
Don't get the wrong idea.

513
00:22:19,233 --> 00:22:21,650
I may know what
your situation is like now,

514
00:22:21,733 --> 00:22:23,567
but I still can't help you.

515
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,650
[FUTARO]
Is that so?

516
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:28,650
I'll study hard whether
you tutor me or not.

517
00:22:28,733 --> 00:22:31,608
I can accomplish my goals
with or without you.

518
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,108
It's your choice.

519
00:22:35,192 --> 00:22:38,483
So if you want to be our tutor,
then you can go right ahead.

520
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:39,775
[gasps]

521
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,817
What did you say?

522
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,275
What? I just said
it's your choice.

523
00:22:44,358 --> 00:22:46,192
Wow, you really mean that?

524
00:22:46,275 --> 00:22:49,775
I can keep the job?!
Thank you, Itsuki!

525
00:22:49,858 --> 00:22:51,525
Uh, sure?

526
00:22:51,608 --> 00:22:53,817
[FUTARO] I'll be there
tomorrow at noon sharp!

527
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,858
Tell your sisters to be ready!

528
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:57,858
[ITSUKI]
Uh-huh.

529
00:22:57,942 --> 00:22:59,317
[FUTARO]
That's right,

530
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,233
my only job is to make sure
the five of them graduate.

531
00:23:02,317 --> 00:23:04,942
That doesn't mean I actually
have to deal with all five

532
00:23:05,025 --> 00:23:07,525
and their annoyink

533
00:23:07,608 --> 00:23:12,442
I just need to teach the ones
who are at risk of failing.

534
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:15,608
Do you think Futaro knows?

535
00:23:15,692 --> 00:23:17,525
I highly doubt he does.

536
00:23:17,608 --> 00:23:19,192
[ICHIKA] It's not like anybody
would've told him

537
00:23:19,275 --> 00:23:20,400
that we transferred here

538
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:23,233
because all five of us
almost flunked out.

539
00:23:24,775 --> 00:23:28,983
[bells ringing]

540
00:23:36,608 --> 00:23:38,567
Yeah, you're right.

541
00:23:39,608 --> 00:23:41,442
[FUTARO]
All these years later,

542
00:23:41,525 --> 00:23:45,192
I still relive that moment
in my dreams.

543
00:23:56,692 --> 00:23:58,567
[FUTARO]
Or should I say...

544
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,442
...my nightmares...

545
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:03,525
[ITSUKI]
Quintuplets Trivia!

546
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,525
[NINO] Altogether, we weigh
about 250 kilograms!

547
00:24:06,608 --> 00:24:08,358
[ITSUKI] Hey, that divides
evenly by five!

548
00:24:08,442 --> 00:24:09,650
50 kilos each,

549
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:11,442
the average weight
for a healthy young girl!

550
00:24:11,525 --> 00:24:12,608
Let's leave it at that!

551
00:24:12,692 --> 00:24:13,525
[YOTSUBA]
Uh, but--

552
00:24:13,608 --> 00:24:15,025
[ITSUKI]
I said leave it at that!

553
00:24:15,108 --> 00:24:16,317
[MIKU, YOTSUBA]
Fine.
