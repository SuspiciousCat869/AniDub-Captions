1
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:11,833
[NARRATOR] Tonight, the curtain
will rise on a fantastical story

2
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:13,791
unlike any told before...

3
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:17,333
A new play devised by the gifted
girl who wields a divine pen.

4
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,625
Through her words,
she conjures characters

5
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:22,625
forced to navigate the
treacherous waters

6
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:25,291
separating life from death.

7
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:27,291
Will her players
cling to unyielding hope,

8
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,916
or succumb to despair,
providing the audience

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,791
with a heartbreaking tragedy?

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,375
You're very quiet.

11
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,291
How is the story coming along?

12
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,750
Shakespeare, darling.

13
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,458
Great, I think!

14
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,458
It's about a king
who everyone loves...

15
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,041
But that affection
eventually turns to hatred!

16
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,166
You'll love it.

17
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,625
That does sound interesting...

18
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:50,375
Humans have a bad habit
of confusing love and hate,

19
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:52,708
never really
understanding either one...

20
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:55,458
There's nothing more endearing
or pathetic than that, is there?

21
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:56,416
Nuh-uh!

22
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,125
Love consumes this king...

23
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,666
But in the end he gets something
great for his trouble,

24
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,875
even when all his
plans have fallen apart.

25
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:06,291
[LOKI] Hmm...
And what is that, pray tell?

26
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:07,291
[SHAKESPEARE]
Simple...

27
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:08,833
He gets eternity.

28
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:45,625
What's going on?

29
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:46,791
How am I supposed to know?

30
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,958
I don't even know
where we are right now!

31
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:54,583
[LOKI] Aw, our poor little
players are in a panic.

32
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:55,500
Who's that talking?

33
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,083
Come out and show yourself!

34
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,708
[LOKI] I can't wait to see
what will happen next.

35
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,208
[chuckling]

36
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,333
Loki!

37
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,125
[AKANE, MIDORI yell]

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,791
[ALL screaming]

39
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,916
Our actors are ready.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,625
Now it's time to place them in a
living illusion of your design.

41
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,541
Raise the curtain;
delight the audience!

42
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,791
Make our players
face their dreams!

43
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,333
I'm ready to go!

44
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,333
[LOKI]
Break a leg, kids.

45
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,583
Despair is the only thing
waiting for you onstage.

46
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,166
[AKANE]
Aw man, that really hurt...

47
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,916
I can barely see in here...

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,416
Are you guys okay?

49
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,583
Hey, where'd you go?

50
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,791
[buzzing noise]

51
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,916
Um... Hello?

52
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,041
[NARRATOR] The greatest test
these students have ever faced

53
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,958
is about to begin.

54
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:57,416
A drama offering them their
deepest, unspoken desires.

55
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,416
If they can't break free
from this labyrinth,

56
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,416
they'll lose
themselves completely,

57
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,291
never again returning
to the light of reality.

58
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,583
--[applause]
--[LOKI] It's showtime.

59
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,583
Loki! You're gonna pay!

60
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,333
I don't know what kind
of game you're playing,

61
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,583
but I'm outta here!

62
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,291
What... in the...

63
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,875
[LOKI chuckling]

64
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:34,000
As much as I enjoy seeing
them bewildered like this,

65
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,041
I think it's about time the
playwright stepped in

66
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,583
and gave them their cue.

67
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:38,791
Yes, of course!

68
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,833
Let's get this play started.

69
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,750
[HAMLET]
To be, or not to be...

70
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,333
...that is the question.

71
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:53,375
[applause]

72
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,458
I shall play my part
until the curtain falls!

73
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,208
[applause]

74
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:16,291
The task before me is
your utter annihilation.

75
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:21,083
[applause]

76
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,458
What the hell?

77
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,708
Who's this guy?

78
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,666
[SHAKESPEARE]
Hamlet, Macbeth, and Othello...

79
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,833
They're the star actors in
our little theatrical group.

80
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,625
There's no way this show
won't be a masterpiece!

81
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:33,458
Sure...

82
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,791
But Shakes...

83
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,583
I'd like your masterpiece
to be a fresh new take

84
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,625
on a familiar story.

85
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:42,791
Perhaps one with an amazing,
unforeseen plot twist!

86
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:46,250
Maybe you should trust the
writer to know what's best.

87
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,541
But I can do that.

88
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,125
After all, I am
a real professional.

89
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,791
[AKANE]
What?

90
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,083
[MIDORI]
Bring back the lights!

91
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,375
[SHAKESPEARE] Once upon
a time in a distant land,

92
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:07,333
there lived a young girl
with a blazing heart.

93
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,291
[SHAKESPEARE]
Her name was Akane.

94
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,125
[AKANE yells]

95
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,125
And then there was Midori...

96
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,958
Who attempted to assassinate
a tyrant and failed,

97
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,666
resulting in her imprisonment.

98
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,333
She would soon be executed.

99
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:28,166
[MIDORI]
What is going on?!

100
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,833
And one more familiar story,
like you requested.

101
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,833
An ill-fated boy named Aoto
believed he would die

102
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,458
when the last leaf
outside his window fell.

103
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,708
Tears sparkled
in his solemn eyes,

104
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,833
a portrait of tortured beauty.

105
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,625
[SHAKESPEARE squeals]

106
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:44,750
[SHAKESPEARE]
On the other hand,

107
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,875
Akane lived a
fairly peaceful life

108
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,791
with a doting father
whom she loved dearly.

109
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,958
Life seemed perfectly simple.

110
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,833
I can't wait for Father
to return from town.

111
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,625
My heart is all aflutter!

112
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,833
[AKANE] How is my mouth
moving on its own?

113
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,041
And why am I wearing
a damn dress?

114
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,541
[METABON laughing]

115
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,291
[AKANE]
Stop laughing, you moron!

116
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:08,583
This is serious!

117
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,916
[AKANE]
Oh, Father!

118
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
[AKANE]
Well, this is awkward.

119
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,916
I know you've been lonely
staying here all by yourself.

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,500
But you'll never feel
that way again, Akane.

121
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,166
Please allow me to introduce
you to your new family.

122
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,333
[AKANE]
Oh, no...

123
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,958
[STEPMOTHER, STEPSISTERS
laughing]

124
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,375
[AKANE]
That dress was bad,

125
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:39,041
but at least it was better
than these dirty old rags.

126
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,375
[AKANE sneezes]

127
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,000
[STEPMOTHER, STEPSISTERS
laughing]

128
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,500
[AKANE]
Just for sneezing?

129
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,916
If only I could control my body,
I would kick their butts!

130
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,333
[laughing continues]

131
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:53,583
Well, now...

132
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,833
Things are really
starting to heat up.

133
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,125
Keep watching.

134
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,958
You'll never guess where
the plot's going next!

135
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,000
[SHAKESPEARE]
Midori remained imprisoned,

136
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:05,625
forced to sit in a dank cell as
her execution day drew nearer.

137
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,916
Help me!

138
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,791
[SHAKESPEARE] Meanwhile, Aoto
continued to quietly suffer

139
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,916
from a devastating illness.

140
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,291
[SHAKESPEARE] Then one day,
an invitation arrived

141
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,875
that gave Akane a small
glimmer of hope for the future.

142
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:28,125
The prince is having a grand
ball in order to find a bride.

143
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,791
[SHAKESPEARE] Akane was
overcome with excitement,

144
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,083
only to realize
she had no chance.

145
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,750
[SHAKESPEARE] She yelled in
a fit of harrowing despair.

146
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,833
[AKANE] A ragged, dirty
piece of filth like me

147
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:43,000
has no place dancing at
a fancy ball with a prince!

148
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,666
I should be locked away!

149
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,916
A hideous looking girl like me
should be kept far out of sight!

150
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,541
[AKANE] What's with
these terrible lines?

151
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,458
[SHAKESPEARE] Then suddenly,
a new character appeared!

152
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,416
[AKANE]
Ah!

153
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,125
[applause]

154
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:01,291
I have come to grant your
every wish, Miss Akane.

155
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,541
But whoever are you, sir?

156
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,833
[OTHELLO]
I am a grand high wizard!

157
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,125
[LOKI]
Yawn. This part's pretty boring.

158
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,208
What's wrong?

159
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,166
Do you have something
against wizards?

160
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,416
No, I happen to be
well acquainted with one,

161
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,875
and he's the dullest
person that I know.

162
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,250
[SHAKESPEARE]
Hmm...

163
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:22,458
Then let's try
another approach.

164
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:23,541
[AKANE]
Again?

165
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,291
[PAVLOV]
We need to get out of here.

166
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,750
It's been a
long time... Akane.

167
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:36,166
[AKANE gasps]
Dad, is that you?

168
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,666
Have I gone insane?

169
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,666
[SHAKESPEARE] Anyway, let's
just cut to the ball scene

170
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,208
at the castle now.

171
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,416
[OTHELLO]
Such beauty...

172
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,875
Please, will you waltz with me?

173
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,166
Uh, sure...

174
00:09:58,833 --> 00:09:59,791
[AKANE]
Hey...

175
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,750
[PAVLOV]
It's me.

176
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,333
[SHAKESPEARE] Cut back
to the imprisoned Midori.

177
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,500
She was allowed one
last taste of freedom

178
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,208
and headed to her hometown,

179
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,875
where her best friend
was waiting for her.

180
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,541
She ran over the hills
and across the valley.

181
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,916
Was it unwavering affection
that motivated this young girl?

182
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,416
Or was it something
else entirely?

183
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,125
[LOKI] Sorry, but you're
losing me, Shakes.

184
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,291
All that running is so boring.

185
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,291
Huh?

186
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,041
Where's the drama
you promised me?

187
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,375
If you don't like it
then you can fix it.

188
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,333
Hey, kid.

189
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,291
It looks like we've come
to a short intermission.

190
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,833
That's our cue to go.

191
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,250
Hey, wait... They're leaving.

192
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,583
How perfect!

193
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,416
Plays are more interesting
when the actors choose

194
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,583
to ignore the script.

195
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:55,208
Improv does add some
real spice to theatre.

196
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,708
I'm surprised you'd
think that, Shakes.

197
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,583
This'll be the
highlight of the show!

198
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,666
Our actors will choose
their own stories,

199
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,500
so even you and I will be
surprised by the ending!

200
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,375
[SHAKESPEARE]
But they will be tragedies.

201
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,000
Whether it's Akane
in Othello's arms,

202
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,125
Midori with Macbeth,
or Aoto holding Hamlet's hand,

203
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,750
they'll all die.

204
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,166
Oh, wonderful!

205
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,750
I was hoping for some
gut-wrenching tragedy.

206
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,541
Let's see where this goes.

207
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:32,166
[AOTO] When the last leaf falls,
I shall be gone as well.

208
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,583
It should be soon.

209
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,583
But that's so sad; don't tell me
you've given up already.

210
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,375
Sad or not,
I have accepted my fate.

211
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,458
There's no way to change it.

212
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,416
[LOKI] Wow, I can really
see the torment on his face.

213
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,958
[SHAKESPEARE] Yeah,
he's totally got the whole

214
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,791
"tortured soul" look down!

215
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:50,750
[AOTO gasps]

216
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,916
What's the matter, big brother?

217
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,541
Come back!

218
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,166
Loki can't reach us here,
so we should be safe for now.

219
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,875
We can rest for a few seconds.

220
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,666
You throw a
wicked punch, kiddo.

221
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,250
I guess you really are
a chip off the old block.

222
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,500
Where've you been, Dad?

223
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,708
Did you fake your death somehow?

224
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,125
When Mom and I heard
that you had died...

225
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,166
Do you have any idea
what we went through?!

226
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,791
How could you do that?

227
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:46,958
Akane...

228
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,750
[VOICE]
Midori...

229
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,958
I know this place...

230
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:10,958
That was Elena!

231
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,458
[ARITON]
Come on...

232
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,041
You should go back to bed.

233
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,208
Thank you.

234
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,333
[ARITON]
Long time no see...

235
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,541
...Big Brother.

236
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,208
[PAVLOV] It was in
everyone's best interest

237
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,958
that I disappear that day.

238
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,291
Trust me...

239
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,791
But I still regret leaving
you behind like that.

240
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,375
Honestly. It tears me up inside.

241
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:48,208
[SON laughing]

242
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,291
[FATHER]
You ready?

00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,458
[SON]
Yeah!

--[SON] Coming back!
--[FATHER] All right!

248
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,166
Yeah, I'd like that
more than anything.

249
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,583
Please! Stop running
from me, Elena!

250
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,041
[MIDORI yelps]

251
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,000
Man, just as I suspected,

252
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,541
you're a big mess when
I'm not around, aren't you?

253
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,166
Where have you
been all of this time?

254
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,875
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

255
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,416
I'm sorry...

256
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,291
You must have been
so lonely without me...

257
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,375
I didn't want that.

258
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,750
Elena...

259
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,875
Forgive me, Midori...

260
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,791
I'm so sorry.

261
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,583
I know that wanting
to be your only friend

262
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,166
was selfish of me.

263
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,000
I wanted us to be
each other's whole world.

264
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,708
The two of us
together forever.

265
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,208
That's why that day...

266
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,750
Please don't blame
yourself, Elena...

267
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:00,875
I should have been
a better fri--

268
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,500
[ELENA]
Shh.

269
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:05,291
I'm just glad we're
finally reunited.

270
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,833
Come on now.
Show me a big smile.

271
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,875
You always make me feel better.

272
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:17,291
Look at you taking care of me.

273
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,666
You're my only real friend.

274
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,625
I love you until the
end of time, Midori...

275
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:26,250
If I have you here, I don't need
anything else in this world.

276
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,916
What's the matter?

277
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,333
Can you not even
say my name, brother?

278
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:34,000
Maybe you're just so surprised
to see me that you can't speak.

279
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,833
Is that it?

280
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,500
Okay, I'll go first, then...

281
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:41,083
I'll tell you what I've been
doing these last few years.

282
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,750
[ARITON] I've been to many
different places since the day

283
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,708
we parted. I've traveled
all over this world.

284
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,083
And I've met
all kinds of people.

285
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,583
It was fun, for the most part,

286
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,250
but there were times
I witnessed the cruelty

287
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,833
humans are capable of
inflicting on each other.

288
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,833
I was always curious
about you, brother.

289
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,583
Trying to figure you out.

290
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,083
I wondered why
you never said a word

291
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,375
when our parents
abused you so much.

292
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,500
But I think I'm probably
the only one in this world

293
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,083
who could ever hope
to understand you.

294
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:14,083
And at the same time,
only you can understand me.

295
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,791
It's been too long.

296
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,541
I should have reached out
to you earlier, big brother.

297
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,208
[NARRATOR] A sweet temptation
tugs at the boy's frozen heart.

298
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,666
He sees himself in the past,

299
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,416
reaching out to grab his
younger sibling's hand.

300
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,416
Begging him not to go.

301
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,916
But the boy can't
ignore the feeling

302
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,958
that something isn't right.

303
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,750
Who are you?

304
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,208
We have to go to this
year's summer festival

305
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,833
with each other, okay?

306
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,791
We can dress in matching
kimonos, just like old times!

307
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,083
Sounds great.

308
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,125
But I want to say
something first.

309
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,458
I have to apologize to you.

310
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,208
No, don't worry about it.

311
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:03,000
Let's just put
all that behind us.

312
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,625
Okay.

313
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:05,875
[ELENA]
To tell you the truth,

314
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,791
for a long time I did
want you to apologize.

315
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,291
I wanted to hear,
"Sorry I ignored you."

316
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:14,666
"Sorry I left you alone."
Stuff like that.

317
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,708
But...

318
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,958
Eventually I realized
what my wish actually was...

319
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,208
From the bottom of my heart,

320
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,625
all I want in this life
is for you to be happy.

321
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:32,000
Because your smile is the
best thing in this world.

322
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,458
Elena...

323
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,416
So I'm the one who
should be apologizing.

324
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,916
For ever making you feel bad.

325
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,166
And just so you know,

326
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,416
you're still my number one
best friend, okay?

327
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,291
[MIDORI]
Look what I've still got.

328
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,208
Yeah, what is it?

329
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,000
Don't tell me you
forgot about these.

330
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,791
You know, it's always
been a dream of mine

331
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,666
to get to play catch
with my son like this.

332
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,916
I thought about it a lot,

333
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,833
even though I was forced
to put my work first.

334
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,916
Why don't we
start over again?

335
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,625
We could live together,
all three of us,

336
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,375
just like old times.

337
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,500
You think you can show up

338
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,416
and everything will
go back to normal?

339
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,208
And what about your research?

340
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,666
Isn't that "more important"?

341
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,875
Turns out there's more to
life than finding answers.

342
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,458
To think I had to
leave you guys behind

343
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,916
to realize such a simple fact...

344
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,666
It's pretty pathetic,
don't ya think?

345
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,583
Yeah, I guess so.

346
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,291
Please forgive me, Akane.

347
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,291
I'll do whatever it takes
for us to live together

348
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,166
as a whole family again.

349
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,375
Even if it means losing
all of my research.

350
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,958
All of this time...

351
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,750
You were really alive!

352
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,375
[AKANE]
Wait...

353
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,666
[NARRATOR] The boy is
tormented by an odd feeling

354
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,583
in the back of his mind.

355
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,541
He'd tried to ignore it once...

356
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,000
But he couldn't.

357
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:11,458
His soul cried out,
forcing him to seek the truth.

358
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,250
Just like this moment.

359
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,958
[AKANE]
Who the hell are you?

360
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:19,125
My dad put his research
ahead of all of us...

361
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,666
His work...

362
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,041
It was everything to him.

363
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,083
There's no way he'd abandon
all that, even for me.

364
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,208
He could lose everything,

365
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,625
but he'd never stop
being a genius.

366
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,791
That's how my real father was.

367
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,791
I have failed.

368
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:41,791
Damn...

369
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,500
You have seen through my act.

370
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,750
Dammit!

371
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,125
Hey, that's not fair!

372
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,500
What's going on, Loki?!

373
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,375
Don't you worry
about it, Shakes.

374
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,416
This is turning out
to be far more interesting

375
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,958
now that they're not following
the script you wrote.

376
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,500
Look. You should be watching.

377
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:12,791
[LOKI]
The actors failed,

378
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,958
but the actual
characters are coming.

379
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:18,333
Reality really is stranger
than fiction in this case.

380
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,125
[LOKI chuckles]
How exciting.

381
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:25,041
It seems we're going to get
a surprise ending after all.

382
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,791
Our part in this
story ends here.

383
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:28,708
Fine...

384
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,375
I'm over this play anyway.

385
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,583
[LOKI] I think you
should get some rest.

386
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,666
You still have a role
to play in this drama.

387
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,916
What now?

388
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,125
[yells]

389
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,000
[AOTO gasps]

390
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,125
[MIDORI yells]

391
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,750
The ultimate comedy
that we know as reality

392
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,125
is about to begin
for these players.

393
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,666
[chuckles]

394
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,583
[LOKI] Don't fault me
for this, Arthur.

395
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:01,666
You selfish humans are the
ones who are truly to blame.

396
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,166
You're always trying
to fight against destiny...

397
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,458
Just like your parents did
when they abandoned you

398
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:10,166
as a child all those years ago.

399
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,166
You're grasping at straws.

400
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,083
[NARRATOR] Does the silent
Fallen King wish to see

401
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:18,000
a comedy that laughs
in the face of despair,

402
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:21,625
or a tragedy that obliterates
all hope for the future?

403
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,958
How will his reign change
the world's story?

404
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,250
Only the gods know for sure.

405
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:03,333
[AKANE]
If this is who you are,

406
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,000
I wish that you'd
have stayed dead!

407
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,541
[PAVLOV] Don't tell me that
weak punch is all you've got.

408
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,833
[MIDORI] You better stop before
you make me really angry!

409
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:11,208
[DOROTHY] If fighting
with you is the only way

410
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:13,500
to prove it's really me,
then so be it.

411
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:16,125
[LOKI] Conflict is the
heart of every good story.
