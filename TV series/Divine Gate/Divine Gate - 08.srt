00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,416
[NARRATOR]
A long time ago,

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,708
an arrogant human
built a tower so tall

3
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:13,666
that it punctured the sky,

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,333
reaching the place
where the gods resided.

5
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,958
The gods were appalled
by this demonstration,

6
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:20,666
and they doled out
a vicious punishment

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,416
to remind all humans
of their inferiority.

8
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:31,375
Now, another human has reached
the gods' hallowed territory,

9
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:34,125
fighting his way
to the Divine Gate.

10
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:35,791
But this man is different.

11
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:38,583
He's punished himself.

12
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:41,500
Despite his attempts to
resist a god's mischief,

13
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,791
this man, once known
as the Holy King,

14
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:47,166
succumbed to darkness in front
of that most sacred of Gates.

15
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,875
Why hello there, Arthur.

16
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:07,000
I see you still have a bit
of consciousness left.

17
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:09,166
Loki... What've you done to me?

18
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,875
What is this place
I'm trapped in?

19
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:12,458
[LOKI]
You sound so angry.

20
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:15,125
Don't tell me you've forgotten
everything I've done for you.

21
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,375
[ARTHUR]
You really are a monster.

22
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,416
[LOKI] It's such fun
to watch humans get angry

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,583
when they realize
they're not in control.

24
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:31,541
[chuckles]

25
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,541
I'll visit you again soon.

26
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,958
[LOKI] Don't look so sad,
my darling little puppet.

27
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:42,416
I did make you
a king, after all.

28
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,166
[ANNOUNCER 8A] The following
is an announcement from

29
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,500
the World Council.

30
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,333
Due to issues stemming
from yesterday's

31
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,916
large-scale system error,

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,291
a special curfew has
been put into place.

33
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,625
Please stay indoors after 8 pm.

34
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,250
In addition,
certain city sections

35
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,958
are completely off limits.

36
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,541
These rules are in effect
until further notice.

37
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,875
Thank you in advance
for your cooperation.

38
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,166
Your safety is
our highest concern.

39
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,916
[SAINT A (DANTE)]
You will answer my question!

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,791
Yes, sir!

41
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,458
Um... Like I said before, uh...

42
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,750
It seemed like Arthur was
planning some kind of coup

43
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,583
to make himself our ruler.

44
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:52,000
I was just trying to do
what was best for the Council;

45
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:55,041
to stop him by
any means necessary.

46
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,500
[SAINT A (DANTE)] So Arthur
was secretly planning to destroy

47
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,541
the Divine Gate
once he reached it?

48
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,083
[OZ]
Exactly!

49
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,125
[SAINT C (JOHANN)]
And to keep him from doing so,

50
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,750
you took it upon
yourself to summon

51
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,750
the Scandinavian gods
for assistance?

52
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:08,750
[OZ]
That's right.

53
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,791
I figured it was
our only option.

54
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:11,916
[SAINT B (AEGIS)]
You don't have the authority

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,750
to make that decision.

56
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:14,958
[OZ]
But Loki...

57
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,750
He made it sound like...

58
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,208
[SAINT A (DANTE)]
Where is Loki?

59
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,916
Why doesn't he
speak for himself?

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,750
[OZ]
I have no idea!

61
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,958
[LOKI]
So sorry to keep you waiting.

62
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,375
[OZ]
Loki?

63
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,083
[LOKI] It's an honor to stand
before the Six Saints.

64
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,125
I come with news about
the conspirator Arthur

65
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:32,083
and his personal army,
the Knights of Round.

66
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,666
You'll be happy to know
that all of them are dead.

67
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,750
[LOKI] Those Saints like to
argue because it makes them

68
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:45,875
feel important.

69
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,000
They never act on anything.

70
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,541
Hey...

71
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,250
There's no way you were telling
the truth back there, right?

72
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,583
[LOKI] You're going to have
to be a little more specific.

73
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,041
Come on!

74
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,000
About Arthur and the Knights
of Round all being dead--

75
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,583
That must've been a lie!

76
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,208
[LOKI]
Oh, I see.

77
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,666
Tell me, what are you
hoping I'll say right now?

78
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,583
[OZ]
Dammit, would you be serious?!

79
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,750
[LOKI] The truth won't
make you happy.

80
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,000
You and I have
both conspired against

81
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,541
the Six Saints.

82
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,208
We've taken the
first step together.

83
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,708
That means we share
the same fate now.

84
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,166
So I don't understand
why you're acting like

85
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,083
some kind of insolent brat.

86
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,458
You're going to have to
learn to steel yourself, Oz.

87
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,916
All I want is
to know the truth

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,458
about what happened to them.

89
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,500
Come on, tell me
they're still alive!

90
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,916
Loki, some of them were
just kids from the Academy.

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,833
[LOKI] All killed by the
Scandinavian gods you unleashed.

92
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:38,083
Every last one of them struck
down with extreme prejudice.

93
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:40,916
Beneath these white gloves,

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,541
your hands are
stained red with blood.

95
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,291
Don't pretend like you didn't
know what was happening.

96
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,375
You are not innocent.

97
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:17,875
Hey.

98
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,541
I was wondering when you'd show.

99
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,125
[YUKARI]
Why are you three late?

100
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,833
[UNDINE] Just making sure
we weren't followed.

101
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,750
I'm so glad to see
that you're okay!

102
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,041
[SYLPH]
Midori, you're choking me!

103
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,208
Akane was really worried
about you, too, bon.

104
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,666
Shut up!

105
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,583
So what do things look
like in the outside world?

106
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,708
Well, I'm afraid
it's not good news.

107
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,916
The Council's trying
to track you down.

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,833
Nothing's being reported
in the news, though;

109
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,250
not the tower,
or the expedition,

110
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,166
or anything like that.

111
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,291
[MIDORI] They're ignoring it
and pretending it didn't happen.

112
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:49,000
Just like the
Blue Christmas stuff.

113
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,500
It definitely sounds
like we can't trust

114
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,250
the World Council anymore.

115
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,041
On the bright side,
we brought the medicine

116
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,875
and other supplies
you asked for.

117
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:56,916
[MIDORI]
Awesome!

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,291
We used up the last
of our bandages

119
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,166
right before you got here.

120
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,833
[UNDINE] Hikari,
how's your leg healing up?

121
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,500
Pretty good; I'll be fine!

122
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,583
It looks really painful.

123
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,166
[sighs]

124
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,666
We need to get going.

125
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,208
Really? Already?

126
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:14,000
The Council might get suspicious
if we're gone for too long.

127
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,166
You've got a good point.

128
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,750
Thank you so much!

129
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,125
Be safe out there.

130
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,083
[SYLPH]
We'll come back soon, okay?

131
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,625
[GINJI]
Great. So what do we do now?

132
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,291
Any ideas, Santa?

133
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,666
Well... Probably
not a good idea

134
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,250
to go running back
to the World Council

135
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,500
if we're not certain
what their plans are.

136
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,500
Just think of how
this must look to them.

137
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,250
They'll think of Arthur
as the bad guy,

138
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,000
and honestly, I would agree.

139
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:42,000
I mean, he killed Lancelot right
in front of you for no reason.

140
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,500
In cold blood.

141
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,416
Yeah, he did.

142
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,541
But it was weird...

143
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:56,708
Arthur didn't really
seem like himself

144
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,125
after he reached the Gate.

145
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,291
Blame the god.

146
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,500
Loki was standing
right behind him.

147
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,458
At this point,
we're all in the dark.

148
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,583
There's no way to know
what happened at the Gate.

149
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,708
And I suppose
that probably means

150
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,666
you don't trust me, either.

151
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,916
[YUKARI]
We don't.

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,666
But if Santa hadn't
come to save us,

153
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,375
I don't think we ever
would've made it outta there.

[YUKARI]
Hikari!

156
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,416
[YUKARI] We can't
keep this up much longer.

157

[HIKARI]
Don't worry about me.

158

00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,291
[GINJI]
Who are you?

161
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,208
They call me
the children's ally.

162
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,875
There it is!

163
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,708
[GINJI]
Now, don't get me wrong,

164
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,833
I appreciate you showing up
right in the nick of time.

165
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,708
But why were you there
in the first place?

166
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,208
[SANTA CLAUSE] Because I
made a promise to Arthur

167
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,625
a long time ago.

168
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,875
Made it just in time! Heh!

169
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,791
Hey, guys! Hurry!

170
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,166
You're gonna miss it!

171
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,250
And then you'll be sorry!

172
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,958
[SANTA CLAUSE]
Man, you're impatient today.

173
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:26,000
[ELISABETH] What's so urgent
this early in the morning?

174
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,291
[ARTHUR]
See for yourselves.

175
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,000
Isn't this view amazing?

176
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,916
[ELISABETH gasps]

177
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,750
It's beautiful.

178
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:33,833
[SANTA CLAUSE]
Yeah.

179
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,416
Wonderful news,
my Geniuses of Divine.

180
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,750
The prologue has now
come to a conclusion.

181
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,250
It's finally time to
move on to the main event.

182
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,791
Let's begin the
Twilight Judgment.

183
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,458
Oh, and I thought you
might like to know...

184
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:54,750
I'm going to have your son
join our little play, as well.

185
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,916
Now, then...

186
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,750
I'd like to introduce you
to our show's brilliant writer.

187
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,333
Ta-da!

188
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,541
[SHAKESPEARE]
Surprise!

189
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,166
[LOKI]
Ah! Hello, hello.

190
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,541
It's been too long since I've
had the pleasure, Shakespeare.

191
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,708
Do you have something
entertaining planned for me?

192
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,250
Oh, I never disappoint.

193
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:17,041
You're gonna love the disaster
I've put into motion.

194
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,250
Great! Tell me
how the story goes!

195
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,958
[LOKI laughs]

196
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,333
Yes, why wait?

197
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,041
You get out your Divine Pen,

198
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,125
and together
we'll write a tragedy.

199
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,250
[SHAKESPEARE]
Okay!

200
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:37,166
Hey, Oz?
is something bothering you?

201
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,958
I think I may have
gotten some children

202
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,666
from the Academy killed.

203
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,708
They were so young,
probably around your age.

204
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,083
[DOROTHY]
Midori?

205
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,541
[SANTA CLAUSE] On that
fateful Christmas night...

206
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,541
I saw the blue moon
shining overhead.

207
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,458
Wait, you mean
the Blue Christmas?

208
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,958
The Council covered it up;
they never told Arthur the truth

209
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,083
about what happened there
and decided to keep everything

210
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,666
a big secret.

211
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,625
That's how they operate.

212
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,958
The truth about
your father's death.

213
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,500
Your old friend's whereabouts.

214
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,458
The Council has answers.

215
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:23,000
They're keeping things from
each and every one of you.

216
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,208
[HIKARI]
How is that possible?

217
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,875
[GINJI]
What're you talking about?

218
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,208
[AKANE]
Hold on a sec.

219
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,333
What secret is there about
my father's death, huh?

220
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,875
[MIDORI] Do you know
where my friend is?

221
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,666
I thought she'd be
waiting for me at the Gate.

222
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,833
Sorry, I don't have that info.

223
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,916
The Council has managed
to hide it all, even from me.

224
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,625
You can blame Loki for that.

225
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:43,958
[GINJI]
Loki?

226
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,208
[inaudible]

227
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,625
[SANTA CLAUSE] After the
Blue Christmas tragedy,

228
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,375
I started following
Loki's movements.

229
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,458
He controls the World
Council thanks to the help

230
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,458
of a group of
researchers and scientists

231
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,458
called the Geniuses of Divine.

232
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,791
[HIKARI] This sounds like some
kind of crazy conspiracy theory.

233
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:05,833
[YUKARI]
If your story is true,

234
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,291
then what does Loki
stand to gain

235
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,916
from everything
that's happened?

236
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,541
[SANTA CLAUSE] He probably
wants to harness the power

237
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,041
of the Divine Gate.

238
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,916
With it, he'd be able to
build a new world from scratch.

239
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,625
Why would he do that if he's
got so much power already?

240
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,958
I think that's just
the kind of person he is.

241
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,791
He likes watching
people struggle,

242
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,500
and finds entertainment in
humans trying to survive.

243
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:27,583
[GINJI gasps]

244
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,166
I see. So that's why he
stopped Arthur's operation.

245
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,666
Spot on.

246
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,250
I warned Arthur that Loki was
planning to do something.

247
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,666
That's one of the reasons
he tried to destroy the Gate--

248
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,666
To protect the world
from any more chaos.

249
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,500
I knew he'd try to
do something extreme,

250
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:46,458
but I never thought...
he'd do that.

251
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,208
What're you going
to do now, Santa?

252
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,208
[SANTA CLAUSE] Whoever reaches
the Gate will have the power

253
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,458
to determine the future
of the entire world.

254
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm going to save Arthur.

255
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,083
I know that it's a lot to ask,

256
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,750
but will you please help me?

257
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,458
You're not seriously
asking if we'll go

258
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:08,666
to the Gate again.

259
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,375
Yeah, that would be suicide.

260
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,791
And why us, anyway?

261
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,500
Because Arthur chose
all of you for a reason.

262
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,833
[K] You spend so much time
in your own head.

263
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:31,041
And yet, you never
decide on anything.

264
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,625
I'll ask you again.

265
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:36,250
Is it the past you want to
change, or the future, now?

266
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,416
Maybe neither.

267
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,583
I just don't know.

268
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:46,333
[K] You're slowly
getting closer, Aoto.

269
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,291
You're discovering your heart.

270
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,583
[GINJI]
Hey, man.

271
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,083
[GINJI]
We need to talk.

272
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,000
[door opens]

273
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,000
Okay, so what's up?

274
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,500
[GINJI] We've decided we're
going back to the World Council.

275
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:09,875
[ALL gasp]

276
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,958
I don't want to be in hiding
for the rest of my life.

277
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:15,458
And there's no way we can help
the situation from here.

278
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,458
But it's too
dangerous to go back.

279
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,458
Did you forget Loki
tried to kill us?!

280
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,708
[GINJI] True, but we're
still alive, aren't we?

281
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,125
Maybe Arthur was really
in the wrong this time.

282
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,041
You're just gonna turn
your back on Santa Clause

283
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,541
after he saved us?

284
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,041
[GINJI] You're forgetting
that he could be lying to us,

285
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,500
for all we know.

286
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,458
Will the Council
welcome you back?

287
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,958
In their eyes,
we're all traitors

288
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,000
as Arthur's accomplices.

289
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,041
They know that we're students.

290
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,291
We can't be blamed
for following orders.

291
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,916
We hardly even knew
what Arthur wanted to do.

292
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,208
Yeah, that's right.

293
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,416
We got mixed up
in this by accident.

294
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,250
In a way, we're the victims.

295
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,666
So then, you don't think
we'll get in trouble?

296
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,625
Nobody really knows the truth
about what happened at the Gate.

297
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:58,083
And it's not like we can
get any answers while hiding.

298
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,083
He's right.

299
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,791
Let's all go back
to the Council.

300
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,125
I agree.

301
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,166
You with us?

302
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,125
[AKANE]
There is another option.

303
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,166
[GINJI]
Huh?

304
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,208
We can go to the
Divine Gate again.

305
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,625
Oh yeah!

306
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:12,708
No way!

307
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,208
Did you not see
what happened to Arthur

308
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,958
and the Knights of Round there?

309
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,833
[AKANE] Yeah, but I'm
still gonna go back.

310
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,833
Arthur was determined
to protect this world

311
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,416
no matter what.

312
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,166
The Knights of Round
gave up their lives

313
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,375
to make sure that his
mission was successful.

314
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,250
I'd much rather see his version
of the world than Loki's.

315
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,875
Hands down.

316
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,708
And I wanna know the truth
about my dad's death!

317
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,166
[MIDORI]
I'm with him.

318
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,708
I've got a friend waiting
on the other side of the Gate.

319
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,291
And I'm not going
to abandon her.

320
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,750
Please don't be
blinded by your emotions.

321
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,708
I swear, you idiots have
gone completely insane.

322
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:59,000
So Aoto, do you agree
with these two?

323
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,041
Yeah, I do.

324
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,750
I want answers, too.

325
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,208
I need to know what
happened that day.

326
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,666
[inaudible]

327
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,916
Fine, do whatever you want.

328
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,333
But when everything goes bad,

329
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,375
don't forget that
you could've joined us.

330
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,958
This means we might not
be seeing each other again.

331
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,958
Take care of yourselves.

332
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,250
I'm sorry.

333
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,375
You guys be careful.

334
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,541
This isn't right!

335
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:35,916
[YUKARI]
Don't worry.

336
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,583
We won't tell them that
we know where you're hiding.

337
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,666
[LOKI] Yukari and Hikari both
said they don't know anything

338
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,916
about the others.

339
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,791
But you'll level
with me, right, Ginji?

340
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,166
I know it's hard,
but think of it this way.

341
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,875
Now that martial law
has been imposed,

342
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,625
they're bound to be spotted.

343
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,208
If you talk to me, though,
we can capture them all safely

344
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,583
so that none of them
wind up getting hurt.

345
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,791
I don't like what
you're implying, Loki.

346
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:11,083
[LOKI] Sorry, I have a weakness
for thinly veiled threats.

347
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,291
What's going on?

348
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,416
Stop! We haven't
done anything wrong!

349
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,041
Impossible... This is
where the hideout was!

350
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,750
[MIDORI]
You replaced their memories?

351
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,583
[SANTA CLAUSE] Sort of, but
it's really not that impressive.

352
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,208
It comes with being Santa.

353
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:35,333
But it is a useful skill
if a kid ever sees me.

354
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,833
Holy crap.

355
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,333
So this means that one of those
backstabbers betrayed us!

356
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,666
Looks that way.

357
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,875
But who knows what
the Council did to them.

358
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,125
Looks like Santa Clause
pulled a fast one

359
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,708
and scrambled your brains.

360
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:49,791
What now?

361
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,666
I bet you're pretty angry.

362
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,833
I know how we can find them.

363
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:59,791
[alarm sounding]

364
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,041
I wonder what's going on.

365
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,708
[GINJI]
Hey! Bad news.

366
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,125
It looks like the Council's
discovered Santa's hideout.

367
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,458
[EFREET, UNDINE, SYLPH]
What?

368
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,125
[GINJI] They're about to
dispatch a raid team.

369
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,083
We have to warn everyone
while there's still time

370
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,583
or else they're toast!

371
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,125
We'll head out now!

372
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,000
[EFREET] Quick!
You have to get out!

373
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,125
Master!

374
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,041
Why, is something happening?

375
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,375
[SYLPH] The Council is
on their way here right now!

376
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,333
They can't be;
that's impossible!

377
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,166
[UNDINE]
But Ginji told us so!

378
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,291
[MIDORI]
Something's up.

379
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,166
[SANTA CLAUSE] Looks like
we fell into his trap.

380
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,875
[OPERATOR 1A]
Zone generation complete.

381

by autonomous Drivers.

383
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,708
Fire when ready.

384
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,583
There's nowhere to run.

385
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,708
Can you hear me?

386
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,666
Give up and come on out already!

387
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,041
Don't fight this
or you could get hurt!

388
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,666
I know you didn't
agree with me,

389
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,875
but if you stay in there,

390
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:06,125
they'll have no choice
but to drag you out!

391
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,416
Ginji...

392
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,166
Those losers have completely
turned against us!

393
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,875
[METABON] They must mean
business if they're using

394
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,750
generated zones to attack, bon.

395
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,875
I apologize.

396
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,666
This isn't how I wanted
everything to go down.

397
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,208
If you've changed your minds
and want to return

398
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,041
to the Council, go.

399
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:23,875
I get it.

00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,416
Nah, it's too late for that.

401
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,583
We're not gonna give up just
because of one little setback.

Thank you.

You sure?

Don't worry about a thing.
