1
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:14,458
[AOTO]
You're early.

2
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:19,625
Don't you have a
tutoring session today?

3
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:22,833
No, I have the day off.
For our birthday.

4
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,166
Oh, yeah.

5
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,875
I guess I'd forgotten.

6
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,833
That's probably for the best.

7
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:31,041
They're only going
to celebrate mine.

8
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,875
And that's just because I
finally became an Adapter.

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,708
I don't understand
how you can have

10
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,041
such bright, clear eyes,
big brother.

11
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,625
Our parents have put us through
so many terrible things.

12
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:49,291
Do you hate me because
I'm their favorite child?

13
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,333
None of this stuff
is your fault, you know.

14
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:52,875
Of course not.

15
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:55,583
I'm just the one who has to
deal with all their pressure.

16
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,000
[NARRATOR] After seeing
his little brother's eyes

17
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:00,541
fill up with sorrow,

18
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,958
the boy found
himself speechless.

19
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,166
Suddenly, he was
filled with regret.

20
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,708
But who could he turn to for
help when they seemed so alone?

21
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,625
Long t

22
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,708
What are you
doing at the Gate?

23
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,583
Fate has guided me
to this spot.

24
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:59,083
[LOKI] You've caught on to how
this works by now, right?

25
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:02,000
Only the chosen ones can
go through the Divine Gate--

26
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,958
Those who know true despair.

27
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,666
Those who've lost an
important piece of their heart.

28
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,958
You fell into that
category, didn't you Arthur?

29
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:13,125
But a god got in my way
before I could step through.

30
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,250
Tell me something, my king...

31
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:18,208
Do you really believe it's hope
that's waiting beyond the Gate

32
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,875
and not just more sadness?

33
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,541
Hope is a resilient force--

34
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,416
One even a god can't destroy.

35
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,708
Careful, that sounds like a bet.

36
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,666
Now, then...

37
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,000
Why don't we sit back and watch
the future unfold together?

38
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,791
[K chuckling]

39
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,458
[MIDORI]
Who are you?

40
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,208
I was right to put
my faith in you.

41
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:50,375
I knew you'd make it this far.

42
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,666
Just where... am I?

43
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,958
Looks like you're doing well.

44
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:58,333
More importantly, what
have you been up to lately?

45
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,750
What's your life like?

46
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,958
How does it feel to be
falsely accused of the crimes

47
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,416
your little brother committed?

48
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,291
Keep a close watch on Aoto.

49
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:09,583
He's about to experience
a new ocean of despair.

50
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:12,666
This is important.

51
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,958
His true nature
is about to surface.

52
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,125
Since the day his brother
killed their parents,

53
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,041
Aoto has suppressed himself.

54
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,625
He locked away his feelings
and put up barriers

55
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,458
like his cold demeanor.

56
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:31,166
He believes it was his fault
that his parents were murdered.

57
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,666
And it constantly
haunts his thoughts.

58
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,000
He carries the crushing
weight of his brother's sins

59
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,875
and crimes as his own.

60
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:41,875
His broken heart is full
of regret and sadness.

61
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,166
After all you've been through,

62
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,500
your heart's in
the same condition.

63
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,500
So what will you do?

64
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:51,041
The Divine Gate is
right in front of you.

65
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,625
I see it.

66
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,250
I'm so close.

67
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,333
Get to your feet.

68
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:01,375
It's almost time for you to
take a step through the Gate.

69
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,458
[ARITON] Do you remember
what it was like, brother?

70
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,208
Our parents didn't
always single you out.

71
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,541
Before I developed any powers,

72
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,166
they doled out their
twisted kind of love

73
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,375
to both of us equally.

74
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,875
They'd tie me to a tree
whenever it rained

75
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,875
and made you stand
across from me, watching.

76
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,541
They said the only way
they'd cut me loose

77
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,916
is if you became an Adapter.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,041
How many nights
did we spend like that,

79
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:30,750
staring at each other
in the pouring rain?

80
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,166
Brother, please, I'm cold!

81
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,333
I'm sorry...

82
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,375
I'm trying... I am!

83
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,791
[ARITON] You were always
crying and apologizing to me

84
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,333
for your failure.

85
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,708
I didn't understand.

86
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,791
Not until we switched places.

87
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,250
Being tied up
was hard, sure...

88
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,750
But having to watch powerless as
you shivered against that tree

89
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,208
was painful in a different way.

90
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,416
That's when it started.

91
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,333
You'd do anything you could
to try and protect me.

92
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,500
[ARITON] You rebelled against
our parents in full force.

93
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,708
Flunked the aptitude
test on purpose

94
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,583
despite your intelligence.

95
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,333
Anything to turn
our parents' anger

96
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,708
away from your little
brother and towards you.

97
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:17,958
Not true.

98
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,791
You actually were better
than me at everything.

99
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,458
[ARITON]
Stop lying to me!

100
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,000
I know you saw it then!

101
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:28,416
The Divine Gate revealed itself
to you before I could see it!

102
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,291
At the time, I wasn't
sure what was happening.

103
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,666
It was only later that
I made sense of it all.

104
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,416
You're... mistaken...

105
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,875
[ARITON]
Use your head!

106
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:44,333
Most people can't bear the force
of the Divine Gate. Right?

107
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,875
That's why they
lose consciousness

108
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:50,083
the first time they see it,
just like I did my first time.

109
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,916
But on that night, you proved
to be more powerful than me.

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,291
I felt the spark in you myself.

111
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,875
You're right... I guess.

112
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,708
You guess what, that
you kept the truth from me?

113
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:10,333
You could have told your
brother about your power.

114
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,708
I was afraid.

115
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,625
[ARITON] Our parents were
worthless human beings.

116
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,041
You were scared that
if they found out

117
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:20,083
you were the strongest,
they'd start abusing me again.

118
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:23,416
They could've learned a thing
or two about sacrifice from you.

119
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,791
I couldn't bear to
watch them hurt you.

120
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:30,041
So is that why you took
the blame for me that day?

121
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:33,291
When I tried to burn our house
down with them inside of it?

122
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,791
[AOTO'S MOTHER screams]
Fire!

123
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,541
[AOTO'S FATHER]
Hurry, get the extinguisher!

124
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:41,708
[AOTO'S MOTHER]
What happened?

125
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,166
We didn't leave
anything burning, did we?

126
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,916
[AOTO'S FATHER]
Dammit...

127
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,333
[AOTO]
It's my fault.

128
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:50,916
What are you--

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,375
I'm the one who did it.

130
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,833
Are you out of your mind?

131
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,458
How could you?

132
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,875
[AOTO] You deserve it
for what you put us through.

133
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,541
You little brat!

134
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,041
[AOTO'S MOTHER] We're hard
on you so you'll develop

135
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,291
strong abilities.

136
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,791
You'll thank us one day.

137
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,291
You can work for the World
Council if you're an Adapter.

138
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,166
Do you understand
what that means?

139
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,916
You'll be able to work
your way up the ladder

140
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,625
and influence the world...

141
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,583
This isn't some stupid fairytale
like chasing the Divine Gate

142
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:20,041
for a wish; this is real life
that we're preparing you for!

143
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,541
We do all of this
for you and your future!

144
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,166
Say that all you want...

145
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,708
But how can we care
about the future

146
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,041
when our present is such hell?

147
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:32,750
And besides... In the end,
this benefits you.

148
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,541
[AOTO'S FATHER] How dare you
talk to your parents like that!

149
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,500
I'll show you what hell is like!

150
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,833
[AOTO'S MOTHER]
No, stop, that's enough!

151
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,750
[AOTO'S FATHER] I'll tell you
when you can come back

152
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,208
in the house.

153
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,958
[ARITON] That incident
made me realize you were

154
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,708
a giant hypocrite.

155
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,250
You may have thought that
you were making things

156
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:01,125
better for me back then...

157
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,833
But all you did
was bring me more pain

158
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,208
as I watched how
they treated you.

159
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,958
It tore my heart up inside.

160
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,791
So thanks for nothing.

161
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:15,125
Weird... It's been so long...

162
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,583
I didn't realize I had any
more tears left inside me

163
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,583
after all these years.

164
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,208
[NARRATOR] There's a
conscious and subconscious

165
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,500
living in every person's mind.

166
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:27,666
Sometimes the
subconscious takes control.

167
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,583
Are you blaming me for
what you did to our parents?

168
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,583
Don't worry, brother.
That scene wasn't enough

169
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,416
to make me pick up a knife
and go at them.

170
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,750
They brought my wrath
down on themselves.

171
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,875
My subconscious
was full of hate.

172
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,291
Eventually I just
couldn't hold back.

173
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,791
[ARITON] Does it really matter
if it was premeditated,

174
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,291
or if it happened in
a moment of bloodlust?

175
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,250
Why make the distinction?

176
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,041
What is intent?

177
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,291
Conscious? Subconscious?

178
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,416
Where does the difference lie?

179
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,958
All the pain that
filled my heart...

180
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,541
All my feelings for you...

181
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:05,916
Mixed together, they fueled the
overwhelming fury in my soul.

182
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,583
And then one day...

183
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,500
I could barely look at you.

184
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,583
I didn't want to think about
everything you'd gone through

185
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:17,875
for me.

186
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:22,375
Your good intentions
were a burden. Worthless.

187
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,458
But do you remember, brother?

188
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,500
Before I killed our parents,
I paid you a visit.

189
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:39,750
Sorry, brother.

190
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,083
This is the only way to free us.

191
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,708
[ARITON] Even then,
your eyes were clear.

192
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:53,333
Bright and penetrating.
Watchful.

193
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,291
[ARITON] That was the night
I saw the Divine Gate

194
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:11,708
for the first time,
and finally became an Adapter.

195
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:15,541
I tasted true power
before collapsing.

196
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,375
Your eyes had been
calm and clear,

197
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,708
but I could sense
your judgment in them.

198
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,916
You had been looking down on me.

199
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,708
I wasn't judging you, brother.

200
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,250
I was trying to protect you!

201
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,000
[ARITON]
That's why I hated it so much!

202
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,583
You and I are twins!

203
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,625
You're only my big brother
by a few minutes!

204
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,166
I wasn't powerless!

205
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,666
That night...

206
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,791
Why didn't you say anything or
suggest we run away together?

207
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,666
It could've been
just the two of us!

208
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,666
Why did you choose to shoulder
all the pain yourself?

209
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,583
To indulge your ego and
feel like the better person?

210
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,041
You know I wasn't.

211
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,875
Of course! You're still
playing the martyr!

212
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,208
No, brother...

213
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:58,291
You made me this way!
Ha! Twisted!

214
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,291
[NARRATOR] The boy's demented
subconscious swelled,

215
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,000
plunging his
conscious into darkness.

216
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:09,416
He became a machine fueled by
hate and the desire to destroy.

217
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,791
His perceptions warped, unable
to see reality any longer.

218
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,166
[ARITON] You must have wanted
to run away from that hell,

219
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,666
to join me and be free somewhere
far away from our parents...

220
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,500
Didn't you?

221
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,791
Our parents were terrible,
but I still held out hope.

222
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:32,791
Always.

223
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,791
I told myself that
one day we'd go back

224
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,958
to the warm family we'd
been when we were younger.

225
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,125
All of us happy.

226
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,625
I never truly
gave up on them.

227
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,250
Heh. Well... Maybe
I was wrong about you.

228
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:56,083
You really are as stupid
as they thought you were.

229
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,708
There might have been
some good left in them.

230
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,500
[ARITON]
I don't buy that...

231
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,458
Our parents wouldn't change.

232
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:05,791
We were just tools for them.
They didn't love us.

233
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,708
And you know what else?

234
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:11,083
I'm sick of you still taking
the blame for me, big brother.

235
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,625
I've thrown away
all sense of guilt.

236
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,125
As for you, it's over!

237
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,833
I won't be your lesser anymore!

238
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,416
[SYLPH]
We finally found you!

239
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,125
Looks like somethin'
big is going down here, bon.

240
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:38,333
Undine, are you okay?

241
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,208
Poor Aoto...

242
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,500
He has to fight his brother.

243
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,416
[K]
The time has come.

244
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,625
What choice are
you going to make?

245
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,750
[ARITON] I've thrown away
all sense of guilt.

246
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:58,958
Let's go!

247
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:02,833
[ARITON yells]

248
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:11,750
No, stop it!
I don't want to fight you!

249
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,708
Don't you hurt Aoto!

250
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,083
Leave him alone! Or else!

251
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,875
You can't stop them.
Not anymore.

252
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,875
[ARITON]
Dammit, fight me!

253
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,708
[AOTO]
No! I am not going to hurt you!

254
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:24,708
[ARITON yells]

255
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:28,458
I've had enough
of your hypocrisy!

256
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,208
[SYLPH screams]

257
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,041
Look, I'm not a hypocrite.

258
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:40,125
I was simply trying
to protect my brother!

259
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,208
You're lying to yourself!

260
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:45,583
Just like all those families
who pretend to be happy.

261
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,958
And those parents who think
they can make up for anything

262
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,750
with a Christmas present!

263
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:53,333
Blue Christmas was punishment
for all of their failures.

264
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,958
This is bad...

265
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,291
The sins of the past are
starting to turn the present

266
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:02,041
into a nightmare for Aoto.

267
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,083
This fight doesn't have
to end with these brothers

268
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,541
killing each other.

269
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,958
I don't need you to
protect me from myself

270
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,500
or anything else.

271
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,750
Just like I didn't need our
parents putting me through hell,

272
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,833
using me to make their
own miserable lives better!

273
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,125
Now... Die!

274
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
[NARRATOR] Misunderstandings
between family...

275
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,208
Actions with
unexpected consequences...

276
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,291
Hands that refuse to be held...

277
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:33,541
Even though love is at the
foundation of all these things,

278
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,208
it's an emotion that
can be easily distorted,

279
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:40,000
morphing into hate,
and taking on an evil form.

280
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,958
[ARITON growling]

281
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,791
This is the end,
my dear brother.

282
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:56,083
[ARITON yells]

283
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,041
I'm coming!

284
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,708
[K] Aoto has to overcome
his demons on his own.

285
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,250
This is his fight.

286
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,916
[K] You should choose what
you do next very carefully.

287
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,833
What is your future?

288
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:12,625
[SURTR] Looks like
the humans are under the

289
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,291
Key Spirit's protection.

290
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,625
This might get tricky.

291
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,041
Damn, I hate those
stupid little brats.

292
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,541
Are you sure you're okay?

293
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,041
Yeah, I'm fine.

294
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,750
But you're hurt.

295
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,958
That explosion was nothing.

296
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,791
Now let's get inside
that Gate Room.

297
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,625
[OZ]
You're not going anywhere!

298
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,291
[OZ] It was foolish
of me to think you gods

299
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,416
would handle things reasonably.

300
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,208
Now there's only one thing an
idiotic, ruined clown like me

301
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,541
can do to make things right...

302
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,041
I'm taking back all the power
I offered up to you gods

00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,625
in the first place!

00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,041

sacrificing myself!

00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,833
It's just as I thought...

320
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,750
I knew... one day...

321
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,833
I'd be able to help you
overcome the things

322
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,458
that were holding you back.

323
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:05,500
Don't forget the past doesn't
determine who you are at heart.

324
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,916
And that the future
is up to you.

325
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,708
You're gonna be okay,
Undine, I promise.

326
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,166
Hey, you called me by
my name again, Aoto.

327
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,375
That makes me happy.

328
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,250
I'm not done yet!

329
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,041
[AOTO]
No, stop!

330
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:26,791
[ARITON yells]

331
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,291
I'm coming, Aoto!

332
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,583
[MIDORI]
I'm here!

333
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:40,000
[ARITON laughing]

334
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,583
The desire to destroy
filling your heart...

335
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:45,375
The subconscious taking
over your conscious...

336
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,958
You tried to kill me.

337
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:52,041
We're not so
different after all.

338
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,458
No...

339
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,958
It's okay.

340
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,083
I'm glad I got
to see the real you.

341
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,875
Thanks for that, brother.

342
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:03,625
But know... only one of us is
gonna survive our next meeting.

343
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:04,833
[AOTO]
Wait...

344
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,291
[ARITON]
I'm gone.

345
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:14,041
As long as you continue to
bear my sins, I'll move freely.

346
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,000
See you soon, brother.

347
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:21,000
[ARITON laughing]

348
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,791
[SYLPH]
Her wound is really deep.

349
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,791
[METABON]
It looks painful, bon.

350
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,041
[AOTO]
Undine!

351
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,333
Are you okay?

352
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:35,708
I'm so glad I was able
to protect you, Aoto.

353
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,208
I'm like you...

354
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,250
I wanted to keep you
safe like you wanted

355
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,666
to protect your
little brother.

356
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,958
Now, go.
Don't let this stop you.

357
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,833
Yeah, we'll take
good care of her.

358
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,916
You still need
to push onward, bon!

359
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,416
Don't let this be the end, bon.

360
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,958
I'm gonna be fine.
I've got them.

361
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,166
You keep moving on your path.

362
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:03,875
Let's go!

363
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:07,333
It's time to enter
the Divine Gate!

364
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,250
You have earned
the right to do so today.

365
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,958
Welcome, everybody.

366
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,416
I hope you're ready to
experience the Divine Gate's

367
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,958
true form.

368
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,000
What...?

369
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,958
That's huge.

370
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,791
[K] It's watching your conscious
and subconscious thoughts,

371
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,916
putting despair
and hope on the scale

372
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,291
and weighing the
balance between the two.

373
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,875
But what does that mean?

374
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,166
See for yourself.

375
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,208
All you need to do
is walk towards it.

376
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,333
Wait... What are you, exactly?

377
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,000
You can't be my
own hallucination

378
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,083
if everyone sees you.

379
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,375
I'm the key.

380
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,541
The guide who shepherds
those who've experienced

381
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,916
true despair towards the Gate.

382
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,166
The key?

383
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,375
[K]
Do you want to change the past?

384
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,000
Or the future, now?

385
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,541
You have the ability to
choose either at the Gate,

386
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:24,833
but you'll need to
make your decision soon.

387
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,291
You three have
earned the right.

388
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:30,666
Because your hearts
have been broken to pieces.

389
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:04,291
[SANTA CLAUSE] You took away
Arthur's ability to choose

390
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:05,666
for himself.

391
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,750
But I'm here to give
him his freedom back.

392
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:10,041
[LOKI]
What a dramatic display, Arthur.

393
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:13,208
Now let's go watch the
remaking of the world together.

394
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,708
[ARTHUR]
It's not that easy, my friend.
