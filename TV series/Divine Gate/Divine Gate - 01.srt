But not everything holds water.

A broken heart, for instance,
can't be filled.

Droplets stream down
the boy's face like tears.

that three worlds
merged into one.

Yes.

As a result, six
incredible abilities

were brought to our people.

Now, the Divine Gate
calls to those of us

who have faith--

Those of us who truly
deserve its powers.

Through the Gate,
all things are possible.

You've probably heard all this.

I bet you used to fall asleep

such magic yourself!

00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:05,875
Wow...

166
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:06,958
Man...

167
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,750
We gotta figure out
who this guy is.

168
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,125
He's got the look of a
cold-blooded killer to me.

169
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,625
You really think so?

170
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,375
It still seems to me
like the poor boy's

171
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,250
about to burst into tears.

172
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,833
Or maybe he looks like that

173
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,791
because he's able
to see the Divine Gate.

174
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,291
Would you please shut up
about that fairytale?

175
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,791
Your wish-granting
magical Gate doesn't exist,

176
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,708
so enough already!

177
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:30,750
Come on!

178
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,791
Aw! You secretly
believe in it, too!

179
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,208
You've gotta be kidding me.

180
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,875
I'm not some stupid kid, okay?

181
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,750
Please. If you don't
believe in the Gate,

182
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,166
then why're you here?

183
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,416
Lemme guess...

184
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,625
It's 'cause you wanna
use the Driver's power.

185
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,458
Or maybe become a hero.

186
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,250
Or both.

187
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,958
[AKANE]
Well, I dunno.

188
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,875
You believe! Told ya!

189
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,541
Sure, ya got me.

190
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,750
[TRISTAN] We have information
regarding the incident

191
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:57,916
on the tram.

192
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,541
It seems the attacker
came to Terrastia

193
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,625
for a contract job
two years ago.

194
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,208
He's a demon and an Adapter.

195
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,625
How is he doing?

196
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,208
He's severely injured,
but stabilized.

197
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,500
He'll live.

198
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,625
Maybe he couldn't adapt
to the environment here

199
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,125
and it drove him mad.

200
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,250
Actually, we suspect
that he might be suffering

201
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,083
from some form of
psychotic disorder.

202
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:21,291
Ugh! I hate dealing with
beings from Hellistia.

203
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,750
Those guys are the worst.

204
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,333
[YWAIN] You can't stereotype
an entire world like that.

205
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:28,000
There are good and evil
humans here on Terrastia.

206
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,750
It's the same thing
for the demons.

207
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,125
And for the fairies, too.

208
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:34,333
We all have the capacity
to be villains or heroes.

209
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,916
Well, you are
a perfect example

210
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,541
of a totally psychotic human,
so I guess you're right.

211
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,958
What'd you just say?!

212
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,500
Whatever his home world,

213
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,458
we'll punish him the way we
would punish a human criminal.

214
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,291
You got it, boss.

215
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,291
And...?

216
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,791
What about the boy
who was there?

217
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:51,791
He left the crime scene

218
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,000
before anyone
could talk to him.

219
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,541
I see.

220
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,041
I'd like to have a chat
with him and hear his side.

221
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,125
Then I'll make sure
that that happens.

222
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,500
[LANCELOT] You've taken some
kinda special interest

223
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,333
in this water-using boy,
haven't you, Arthur?

224
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,750
[ARTHUR]
Perhaps.

225
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,291
But with good reason.

226
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,416
It's the same attention I'd
give anyone with his abilities.

227
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,625
[LANCELOT]
Yeah, but you don't know--

228
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,041
[ARTHUR] If he's as
powerful as he seems,

229
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:18,333
then I will have him
attend our Academy.

230
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,833
That way he won't be a problem.

231
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,291
Something about him
rubs me the wrong way.

232
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,458
Well...

233
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,000
I certainly understand
your reservations.

234
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,000
But you'll have
to trust me on this.

235
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,375
Oh, don't worry.

236
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,083
I know what my place is.

237
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,666
Good. Thank you.

238
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,458
[BOY 1A]
So gross!

239
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,625
[BOY 1B]
Mackerel ramen?

240
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:48,958
Sounds disgusting.

241
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,125
[BOY 1A] And did you see
him put ice in there, too?

242
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,500
[GIRL 1E] He's got the
strangest eating habits.

243
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,541
[BOY 1B]
Cold, watered-down soup.

244
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,666
Well... He did kill his parents.

245
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,250
He's a psycho. For real.

246
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,375
You mean...

247
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,666
All of the rumors
about him are true?

248
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,041
My parents definitely
think he did it.

249
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,041
Apparently he was
neglected as a child

250
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,583
and went through some seriously
messed up stuff growing up.

251
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,875
[BOY 1B]
For real?

252
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,208
[GIRL 1D]
No way.

253
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,625
If he killed his parents,
then how come he's free

254
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,708
to walk around and go to school?

255
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,500
[NARRATOR] I wish the rain
would fall even harder.

256
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,416
Swallowing everything.

257
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,625
Like a muddy stream.

258
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:38,708
But even then, a rain
cannot put out a fire.

259
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,083
[BOY 1A] All right,
that's enough for today.

260
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,000
--[BOY 1B] Let's go!
--[GIRL 1B] Hold on!

261
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,083
[AKANE]
Special Advisor.

262
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,625
You called for us, ma'am?

263
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,125
[AKANE yells]

264
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,625
Didn't I tell you never
to call me "ma'am"?

265
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,000
[AKANE] Ugh!
You could've killed me!

266
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,166
[EFREET] I had faith that
you'd dodge the attack.

267
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,708
That's the reason we left the
Heaven World in the first place,

268
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,750
or do you not remember our oath?

269
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,250
It's our duty as Adapters
to use our abilities

270
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,041
to maintain peace
for the greater good.

271
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,041
[AKANE yells]

272
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,875
[EFREET]
Are you being sarcastic?!

273
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,041
So, Master.

274
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,541
What did you want
to talk to us about?

275
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,041
This morning's tram incident.

276
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,333
Or have you foiled
more crimes since then?

277
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,083
We've already heard
the news reports about it.

278
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,500
Agh!

279
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,750
[EFREET] Then this should
be a fairly quick meeting.

280
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,041
We want you to find the
water-user and recruit him

281
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,791
into the Academy.

282
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,000
[MIDORI]
Huh?

283
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,875
You want us to make
him part of our team?

284
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,125
You gotta be kidding.

285
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,875
We're always looking
to recruit more people

286
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,083
with abilities!

287
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,083
[EFREET] I'm told that Arthur
has offered him a place

288
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,125
at the Academy
several times already,

289
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,541
but the boy has
refused him each time.

290
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,458
[MIDORI]
Hmm... I wonder why.

291
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,791
[SYLPH] I dunno, but for a
human with that much power,

292
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,833
the safest place
for him to be is here.

293
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,166
There're probably
plenty of other people

294
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,166
who want to get their
hands on this kid.

295
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,958
So we're leaving it to
you two to persuade him.

296
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,166
Fail and you'll disappoint
everyone at the Academy,

297
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,166
the entire World Council.

298
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,500
[AKANE]
Huh?!

299
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,291
[EFREET] But you're not
the only one on this job.

300
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:10,000
They sent the water fairy, and
she's got a head start on you.

301
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,541
Darn. Really?

302
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,583
Don't worry. We've got this.

303
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,750
I can be super
persuasive, you know.

304
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,791
[SYLPH laughs]
Now that's the spirit!

305
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,041
Oh, I guess you
should know his name.

306
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,291
It's Aoto?

307
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,500
I feel like I've
heard that name before.

308
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:26,708
I'm sure you have.

309
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,458
It was all over the
news four years ago

310
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,833
when his parents
were found dead,

311
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,958
seeing as the media
called him the killer.

312
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:45,791
[AOTO]
Why are you here again?

313
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,041
Oh, you know.

314
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,875
Arthur told me to
talk you into joining us.

315
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,500
But really, I'm here on my own.

316
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:55,000
I guess I like being
around you or something.

317
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:58,166
[AOTO]
Another example of my bad luck.

318
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,875
What's so great
about the regular school

319
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,333
you're in now, huh?

320
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,208
At the Academy,
all your classmates

321
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,708
would be Adapters
just like you are.

322
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,166
You'd probably fit in
a little bit better.

323
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,875
I've already turned Arthur down.

324
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,250
I don't know why he thinks
you'll change my mind.

325
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,833
[UNDINE] He says we need your
power to maintain world peace,

326
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,750
but if I'm being honest,
I think you're the one

327
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,583
who needs our help.

328
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,625
Come on, Aoto.

329
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,208
Join the Academy.

330
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,291
And use it as a chance
to finally put the past

331
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,958
far behind you.

332
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,500
[ARTHUR]
Long time no see, Aoto.

333
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,791
Thank you for coming.

334
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,500
[AOTO] Figured I didn't
have much of a choice

335
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,125
when I heard that you
wanted to talk about

336
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,000
this morning's attack.

337
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,000
You know your duty.

338
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,541
[AOTO]
Are you going to arrest me?

339
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,125
Of course not.

340
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,208
Why would I? You could've killed
that criminal for all I care.

341
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,625
He deserved it.

342
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:55,916
That's not who I am.

343
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,208
I don't have that kind of power.

344
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,541
You're a terrible
liar, aren't you?

345
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,375
Well, anyway...

346
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,291
I have something for you.

347
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,750
Go on, don't be afraid.

348
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:07,958
Take it.

349
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,666
[ARTHUR] It's a Driver
created just for you.

350
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,916
Regardless of
what you might think,

351
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,500
your abilities can attract
the attention of other people

352
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,333
with strong powers.

353
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,250
Believe me.

354
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,916
Without Drivers,
we gifted humans

355
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,166
are no match for Hellistia's
monstrous demons,

356
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,791
or even the mighty
fairies of Celestia.

357
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:28,875
[AOTO]
Whatever you say.

358
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,708
But I don't want
this thing, so...

359
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,416
I'll see myself out.

360
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,208
[ARTHUR]
Here is my offer.

361
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,208
The truth.

362
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,000
I'll never lie to you, Aoto.

363
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:45,291
[ARTHUR] Let me know when
you're ready to face reality.

364
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,916
Until then, I'll be
here waiting for you.

365
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:54,875
Hey, there he is!

366
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,416
[AKANE]
Yo!

367
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,291
Hey, sorry about this morning.

368
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,208
Me, too.

369
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,500
It was a misunderstanding.

370
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,583
Sure.

371
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,916
[MIDORI]
Anyway, since you're here,

372
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,666
would you like a tour of
the Academy or something?

373
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,375
All the people here are Adapters

374
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:16,291
who can wield
special powers, like us.

375
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,958
And why should I care?

376
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,333
Oh! Well, uh--

377
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,916
Listen, we were
told to recruit you,

378
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,666
so why not make it easy on us?

379
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,875
Would you shut up?

380
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,708
What? There's no point
keeping it a secret.

381
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,166
Moving on...

382
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,250
There really are a ton of
great reasons to come here.

383
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,916
You would get the chance
to hone your ability.

384
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,333
What would you do
with my power?

385
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:39,375
You'd use me.

386
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,708
Sorry.

387
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,500
[MIDORI] We can reach
the Divine Gate together!

388
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:46,875
Our wishes will be granted!

389
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,625
I told you to
cut that stuff out.

390
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,625
You can see
the Gate, can't you?

391
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,791
I'm right, aren't I?

392
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,291
You can!

393
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,666
Even if I could...

394
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,875
I don't have any
wishes to ask for.

395
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,625
Well, I guess we can't
force you to join,

396
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:08,125
but you should know that we're
serious about what we do!

397
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,208
We're keeping the peace!

398
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,666
Remember that.

399
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,208
Oh. Also...

400
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,875
I don't like secrets, so
I'll go ahead and tell you.

401
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,375
I know what everyone
says about you.

402
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,916
That you killed your parents.

403
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,958
But I don't believe the rumors.

404
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,500
What's important to me
is that you do what--

405
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,875
Save your breath.

406
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,875
I did kill them.

407
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,625
It was my fault.

408
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,666
Come back to mock me some more?

409
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,416
You're a giant liar,
but then again, you're not.

410
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,916
You could've killed them,
but you chose not to.

411
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,083
You act like you feel
nothing, but you do.

412
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:06,083
Rain won't fall forever,
but after that day,

413
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:10,708
you refused to let the sun
shine on your heart ever again.

414
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,333
You can't even eat warm food

415
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,333
because everything
they gave you was cold.

416
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,583
Just like their hearts
were to you.

417
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,791
You don't even know who
you really are anymore.

418
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,791
You've begun to believe
all your own lies.

419
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,166
[AOTO]
Who are you?

420
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,458
[K] Just someone who's
been watching all this time.

421
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:36,083
[AOTO'S MOTHER] You make
Mommy so proud, darling.

422
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,458
[AOTO'S FATHER]
She's not alone.

423
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,458
Because of your ability,
I'm happy to be your father.

424
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,416
Please. Just shut up.

425
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,375
Sorry, Son.

426
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,416
Yes.

427
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,833
We're just so happy
you're our son.

428
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,208
Oh! I know.

429
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,375
Let's go buy that new game
you want next Sunday.

430
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:50,500
Just the three of us.

431
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,000
We'll make a whole day of it.

432
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,458
How does that sound?

433
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,416
Good idea.

434
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,375
I say we do it. Yeah?

435
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,000
[MOTHER, FATHER laughing]

436
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:14,916
[AOTO'S MOTHER]
How wonderful.

437
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,958
[laughing continues]

438
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,083
[DOG growling]

439
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,708
[DOG barking]

440
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,208
[ARITON] You've always been
a mystery to me, big brother.

441
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,500
You want to hate them,
but you can't do it.

442
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,375
You want to kill them,
but you refuse to.

443
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,375
I know everything about you.

444
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:04,041
I've seen the true
color of your heart.

445
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,583
It's blue.

446
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,750
Frozen and shattered,
big brother.

447
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,666
Deep down inside,
you're as cold as ice is.

448
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:17,833
[ARITON] I could end all your
suffering if I really wanted to,

449
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,666
but I honestly don't care.

450
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,083
You're crying on
the inside, always.

451
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:26,083
[ARTHUR] The holy Gate
has finally opened.

452
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,583
Time to see what's
on the other side.

453
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:04,541
[AOTO]
Trust me on this.

454
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,291
As a kid, I learned
you can't always act

455
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:08,083
on the things you want to.

456
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,875
[ARTHUR] You go by the
name of Santa Clause.

457
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:11,166
And yet you show up
with presents

458
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,250
even when it's not
the holiday season.

459
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:16,833
[AKANE] Even if you're in pain,
don't let it control you.
