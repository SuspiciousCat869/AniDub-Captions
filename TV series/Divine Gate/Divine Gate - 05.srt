1
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:13,333
[NARRATOR] When the light shines
bright, it creates shadows.

2
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:15,375
Just as turmoil
and darkness arise

3
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:18,416
anytime order starts to
spread across the land.

4
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:25,125
Those wholive in the darkness
are called "the Defiers."

5
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:28,250
They are the wretched people
who do not know the light.

6
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,583
[NARRATOR]
Not everyone is aware of this.

7
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:38,625
The boy still does not realize
that there is a dark world

8
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,375
just beyond the light.

9
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,291
[AKANE] Agh, This
place is so far away.

10
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,250
[MIDORI] Well, it is
in an abandoned section.

11
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,458
[AKANE] Okay, so what
does that mean, exactly?

12
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:23,916
What? You should know this!

13
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,166
It's where we're doing
our special training.

14
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,708
Of course I know.

15
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,208
Just remind me.

16
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,791
[MIDORI] It's my understanding
that it's some kinda place

17
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,541
where people can't live safely.

18
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,583
Actually, it's an
area the World Council

19
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,041
doesn't manage, bon.

20
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:37,958
Oh, gotcha.

21
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:38,875
I get it now.

22
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,333
It's just like I said it was.

23
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,125
Ha! You're as
clueless as me.

24
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,666
[MIDORI laughs]

25
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,375
[METABON] Sometimes I
worry about you two, bon.

26
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,458
Oh, wow!

27
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:57,708
What a view!

28
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,541
This is totally not what I
expected it to look like at all.

29
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,625
The abandoned section
is gorgeous!

30
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,375
There's probably more
to an area like this

31
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,750
than meets the eye.

32
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,041
What?

33
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,666
There weren't any
advisors on board,

34
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,583
so who's supposed to be in
charge of this special training?

35
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,041
What's the matter, huh?

36
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,416
Are you gettin' scared?

37
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,541
Of course not!

38
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,416
I was thinking out loud is all!

39
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,291
I hate when I feel like I don't
know what's going on, y'know?

40
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:27,041
[GINJI]
If you got a problem, go home.

41
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,166
[AKANE]
Ginji!

42
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,708
[NARRATOR] The boy can't
find interest in anything.

43
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,916
Because of this, he
searches for the Divine Gate

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,958
using a power that
favors nothingness.

45
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:41,000
His blade heartlessly
slashes everything,

46
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,583
even when he's the
one who gets hurt.

47
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,666
Ha! There's no
way I'm leaving!

48
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,583
Training to reach the Gate
is just a waste of your time.

49
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,541
I'm the one who's
gonna get there first.

50
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:53,708
Nuh-uh!

51
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:55,958
Hey!

52
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,291
Would you two
please stop fighting?

53
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,750
[HIKARI]
Yeah, calm down, you guys.

54
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,208
Let's see some smiles, yeah?

55
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,333
[MIDORI]
Hikari!

56
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,375
[NARRATOR] The girl
always seems to be happy.

57
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,375
Her smile never clouds
over or falters.

58
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,625
But a painted-on grin
can never truly cover up

59
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,041
feelings of heartache
and fragileness inside.

60
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,541
Well, hello!

61
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,500
It's good to see ya!

62
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,083
[MIDORI chuckles]

63
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,250
Hey there.

64
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,125
I didn't know you two
were coming along!

65
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,958
[HIKARI]
Yup! Yukari's pumped!

66
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,416
[NARRATOR]
The girl likes the night.

67
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,666
The tranquility.

68
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,250
The purple-hued city.

69
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,041
The deep dark shadows.

70
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:37,000
Those things all bring
the girl a sense of calm.

71
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,208
The girl is at home
in the night.

72
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,625
She loves darkness
more than anything.

73
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,791
There's darkness within you.

74
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,458
I see it in your eyes.

75
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,708
Is there something you
don't like about this place?

76
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,250
I don't have much
of an opinion.

77
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,333
[YUKARI]
Oh.

78
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,041
[BEDIVERE]
I've been waiting for you!

79
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,833
[BEDIVERE]
Wait, where are you going?

80
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:18,916
You can't just ignore me!

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,375
That's so mean!

82
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,541
You guys came from the
Academy for special training,

83
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,666
didn't you?

84
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,625
[BEDIVERE]
I'll be your trainer.

85
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,833
I'm one of Arthur's
Knights of Round.

86
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,166
Codename Bedivere.

87
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,208
Did you not recognize my mask?

88
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,458
[YWAIN] Listen, the kids know
us as the Knights of Round.

89
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,708
Since they call us "Knights,"

90
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,791
they'll instantly get
that you're one of us

91
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,083
if you wear a horse mask.

92
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,500
Y'know, like a...
like a chess piece.

93
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,125
Just trust me on this.

94
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,083
[BEDIVERE]
Yeehaw!

95
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:02,166
That stupid Ywain
tricked me again!

96
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,458
I've never been so
embarrassed before in my life!

97
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,708
Something tells me that
she's not the brightest.

98
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,708
Yeah, but she seems like a
really nice person at least.

99
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,833
So when are we gonna
start our special training?

100
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,083
Oh! Yeah, that.

101
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:19,000
Hope you brought your game
faces, 'cause it won't be easy!

102
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,250
[AKANE] All we have to do
is break up into two teams

103
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,875
and find some checkpoints?

104
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,375
Lame.

105
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,750
I was actually kinda worried
that the special training

106
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,416
was gonna be super
tough or something,

107
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,458
but so far it's been
a lot of fun!

108
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,666
[AKANE]
Whatever.

109
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,708
All I care about is
beating Ginji's group.

110
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,791
It took you guys long enough!

111
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,333
Hey, it's Breunor.

112
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:44,083
That's right! You've
found your first mission.

113
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,166
Yes, you have the high
honor of fighting me,

114
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,000
the Great Palomides.

115
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:50,958
[MIDORI]
Uh...

116
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,500
[PALOMIDES chuckles]

117
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:57,583
A duel between real men
is a competition of strength!

118
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,125
[MIDORI]
Uh...

119
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,416
Ha! All right then, old man.

120
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,250
We'll see who's
the strongest here.

121
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,791
Come on! Let's fight!

[BOTH grunting[

Why am I not surprised
he volunteered to do this?

00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,625
Don't you think this is whole
thing's kinda strange, Aoto?

125
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,458
[PALOMIDES]
What's the matter?

126
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,250
Don't tell me that's
all you've got, kid!

127
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,166
[MORDRED]
True or false?

128
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,916
Arthur's Driver is known as
the great sword, Masamune.

129
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,583
Circle for true, X for false.

130
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,333
Choose the side that is correct.

131

'Kay, game on.

It's gotta be true!

Wow, I was right.

And the blue-eyed kid
is the winner!

138
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,708
Arthur's Driver is
actually called "Excalibur."

139
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,416
Why am I always
the one who gets dirty?

140

[AKANE]
This sucks.

I can do better than that.

his father's blazing footsteps.

No matter how much time
passes, that man's image

remains imprinted in the
forefront of the boy's memory,

the way out here

for some special training?

Well, that's the story
they told us, at least.

It seems like a waste of time.

00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,791
Oh. You mean this?

163
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,291
So what is it?

164
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,625
Something important to me.

165
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:24,833
But you wouldn't get it.

166
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:25,916
How important?

167
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,041
Like, if you had to choose,

168
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,791
would you save a
friend or the necklace?

169
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:30,875
That's not fair.

170
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,916
You can't compare
things like that.

171
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,250
[GIRL]
Hmm...

172
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,250
Then, will you give it to me?

173
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,500
Say what?

174
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,250
Not a chance.

175
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,666
Okay, fine.

176
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,458
I've just always wanted
something like that.

177
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,208
Something precious to me!

178
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,208
But surely you have a
couple of things in your life

179
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,833
that you consider
special, don't you?

180
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:53,875
It's funny...

181
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,708
Happy people always
think that way.

182
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,666
Look, forget about it.

183
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,625
I'm happy that you're happy.

184
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,250
And you should be, too.

185
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,208
[GIRL]
Uh-oh, you missed a spot.

186
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,166
Right there.

187
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,458
By your ear.

188
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,458
Where, you mean, here?

189
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,000
[GIRL]
The other side.

190
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,000
[giggles]

191
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,875
You big dummy.
[laughing]

192
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,083
[MIDORI]
Akane!

193
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,375
Where'd you go?

194
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,125
Oh. There you are.

195
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,041
Is something wrong?

196
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,708
Nothing. Sorry.

197
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,041
I was talking to--

198
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,083
[MIDORI]
Hm? To who?

199
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,291
[AKANE]
Um... Never mind.

200
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,041
[LANCELOT] Now is not the
time to be playing games

201
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,708
with these kids, Arthur.

202
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,458
The most important
lessons in life

203
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,708
aren't always learned
on the battlefield.

204
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:50,333
Battles are the least of my
concerns with these children.

205
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,750
All of our decisions are
made in order to get closer

206
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,958
to the Divine Gate, right, boss?

207
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,541
[ARTHUR]
Don't forget, Lancelot.

208
00:10:56,625 --> 00:11:00,416
A fruitful harvest starts with
a single blooming bud.

209
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,958
You don't forget that
these are your students.

210
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,583
They're not a bunch of crops.

211
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,625
[MIDORI sighs]
We finally made it.

212
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,333
Aw man, I am
completely worn out.

213
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,916
Excellent work, you guys.

214
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,333
You can freshen up
over there if you'd like!

215
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,125
Hey.

216
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,750
[AKANE]
Yeah?

217
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,541
What's up with you?

218
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,291
[AKANE]
Nothing, really.

219
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,250
You have to talk to
get it off your chest.

220
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:48,083
That's what Midori says.

221
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,916
I met someone earlier.

222
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,333
Back in the woods.

223
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,666
[NARRATOR] The girl had
appeared out of thin air,

224
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,000
and then was gone
just as quickly.

225
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,666
He feared that by
talking about her,

226
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,708
she might disappear
from his memory as well.

227
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,416
Like she'd never existed
in the first place.

228
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:11,750
[BEDIVERE]
So, everyone,

229
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,958
how did you like your
special training today?

230
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:17,208
I bet I'd like it more if
I knew what the point was.

231
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,208
Of course.

232
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,250
I've wondered that as well.

233
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,166
What's that supposed to mean?

234
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,250
[BEDIVERE] You're not
the only ones in the dark.

235
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,125
I have no idea why we're
doing this sort of training.

236
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,291
All the boss said was,

237
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,416
"Every choice comes
with a consequence."

238
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,000
So I guess you should keep
that in the back of your mind.

239
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,375
That's enough talk.

240
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,375
Let's move on to
your next mission.

241
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,500
[chuckles]

242
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,916
[MIDORI] Now we're supposed
to go back to the station

243
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,541
in the dark,
without our trainer?

244
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,958
How's this supposed to help us?

245
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,000
[AKANE]
Huh?

246
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,666
[HIKARI]
Whoa... Who are they?

247
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,333
What the hell?!

248
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,625
They're shape-shifting.

249
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:56,708
This is bad news!

250
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:57,791
They look strong.

251
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,000
Watch out!

252
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:04,875
[MIDORI]
What the--?

253
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:08,625
[YUKARI]
They're Seconds.

254
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,750
Second whats?

255
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,833
[YUKARI] Don't tell me you've
never heard of them before.

256
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,166
They seek out power by
crossing the species barrier,

257
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,958
hoping they'll be able to reach
the Divine Gate by doing so.

258
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:24,791
The thing is, Seconds
don't normally attack people.

259
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,458
Something strange is going on.

260
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,375
We won't allow anyone to
trespass on our territory.

261
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,458
You're all dead!

262
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:32,833
We can take these guys!

263
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:35,666
No, our mission is to return
to the station, Ginji!

264
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,916
You're gonna run away?

265
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,041
I'm following orders!

266
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,583
C'mon, let's go!

267
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:41,625
'Kay!

268
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:57,833
Hey, it's you.

269
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,041
[GIRL laughing]

270
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,333
[GIRL yelling]

271
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,916
What the hell?! Agh! Quit it!

272
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,625
No! I'm sorry...

273
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,375
But they saw me with you.

274
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,000
They don't like intruders.

275
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,375
Okay, then...

276
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,666
You're obviously not human,
so just what are you?

277
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,000
That's where you're wrong.

278
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,958
All of us are human.

279
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,666
At least, we were.

280
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,708
But we ended up out here
because we'd be dead

281
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,208
if we stayed in town.

282
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,833
[GIRL]
They called us "Defiers,"

283
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,000
among other much worse things.

284
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,250
Do you get it?

285
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,375
Then they forced us
to live in hiding

286
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,250
because we questioned
the Council.

287
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,166
I've never heard of you before.

288
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,833
[GINJI yelling]

289
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,750
[HIKARI]
They're tough!

290
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,375
And so sad.

291
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,833
[AOTO]
Hold on! Where's Akane?

292
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,041
What?

293
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,583
He was right behind us
just a minute ago!

294
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:05,750
Let's go find him!

295
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,125
[GARETH] It would appear
some of the Seconds

296
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,291
escaped to the
abandoned section.

297
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,500
I'm unfamiliar
with their Drivers.

298
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,291
I wonder where
they obtained them.

299
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,458
From the Grimoire Cult,
most likely.

300
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,041
So you knew about them?

301
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,000
We could deploy a rescue team.

302
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,125
No.

303
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,416
And tell Bedi not
to help out, either.

304
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,333
But... the kids
don't stand a chance.

305
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,541
[ARTHUR]
Will they cross swords?

306
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,875
Perhaps talk it out?

307
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,083
Or run away
from the entire fight?

308
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:44,416
I want to see how they choose to
handle this odd turn of events.

309
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,583
[LOKI] You're putting
too much responsibility

310
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,000
on their shoulders.

311
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:55,375
[OZ] Wouldn't it be much safer
to readjust your plans?

312
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,666
[ARTHUR]
There's no need for that.

313
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,041
[OZ] Just so you know,
you can't get to the Divine Gate

314
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,083
by stacking up dead bodies.

315
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,500
[AKANE grunting]

316
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:07,958
[AKANE]
Would you cut it out?

317
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,958
I don't wanna fight you!

318
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,916
Why do you keep attacking me?

319
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,708
What did I do ever do to you?

320
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:15,916
[GIRL]
That necklace.

321
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,875
I'll get it after all.

322
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,208
Hey...

323
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:22,250
Are there any good movies
coming out these days?

324
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,875
And is that amazing bakery
near the station still open?

325
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,750
[AKANE]
Huh? What are you talking about?

326
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,791
[GIRL] We had to sacrifice
all that in order to survive.

327
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,958
We had no choice but to leave
or we would all be murdered.

328
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:40,541
Why do you get to be happy
while I live in pure misery?

329
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,625
It's just not fair!

330
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:48,541
[AKANE]
Aoto!

331
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,291
You stay away from him!

332
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,750
Oh, this is perfect.

333
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,416
Are you happy that your
friends came back for you?

334
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,208
Too bad they're a weakness.

335
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,083
They'll only drag you down.

336
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,958
[AOTO]
Akane! Now's the time!

337
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,791
Hurry and say
what's on your mind!

338
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:08,833
[AKANE]
Huh?

339
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,583
We're judged on
the actions we take.

340
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,500
But sometimes feelings are
the most important weapon.

341
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,333
[AOTO]
I didn't act when I should have,

342
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,083
and didn't say
what I should have,

343
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,541
and because of that,
I lost something important.

344
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:21,791
So talk now!

345
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:25,416
Listen...

346
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,958
I'm sorry about all of this.

347
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,125
I had no clue what was goin' on.

348
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,416
I didn't know there
were other people here

349
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,375
so far from away the city.

350
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:37,166
I can see now that we
have it much easier than you.

351
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,375
I'm so pathetic!

352
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,041
So...

353
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,291
Is there any way
that I can help you?

354
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,333
Please, just tell me
what I can do.

355
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:57,583
[GIRL]
You know...

356
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,083
I've never met someone so naïve.

357
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,583
[yells]

358
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:02,916
No, Akane!

359
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,791
[AKANE grunting]

360
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,291
[GIRL] You don't even
think of us as people,

361
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,291
so how can you understand?

362
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,791
We're "Seconds."

363
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,291
[AOTO]
But he's trying to understand.

364
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,291
That's gotta count
for something!

365
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,166
We know much more than
you blind fools ever will.

366
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,000
And we know it's pointless
to trust your motives.

367
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,416
You just don't get it.

368
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,791
Go away!

369
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,083
But why?

370
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,250
[BEDIVERE]
If I hadn't stopped her,

371
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:51,166
she would've
killed you just now.

372
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,916
There are other ways...

373
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,708
[BEDIVERE] You're a big
asset to the Academy,

374
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,625
and Arthur doesn't
want to lose you.

375
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:58,416
Now!

376
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,125
By the order of Bedivere,

377
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,083
your training is complete!

378
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,625
We knights shall
administer justice!

379
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,583
[OZ]
Such brutality.

380
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,166
They're definitely your
subordinates, all right.

381
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,875
[LOKI] But the kids
tried talking things out

382
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,541
instead of fighting.

383
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:32,791
It's a choice that will allow
them to claim their innocence.

384
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,291
Has the World
Council checked in?

385
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,000
Oh please, you don't
have to pretend you care

386
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,416
what they say.

387
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,208
I mean, you've already made up
your mind, haven't you?

388
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,541
You'll try for the Divine Gate

389
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:47,416
no matter what or who
stands in your way.

390
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,958
And you know what
responsibilities

391
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:52,750
fall on your shoulders
because of this choice.

392
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:57,625
But you've weighed your
losses, codename Arthur.

393
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,666
A successful leader
will guide his people

394
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,666
when they've strayed
from the path.

395
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,041
I chose to take on the name
of a king for a reason.

396
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:10,291
It's my duty to shepherd my
subjects in any way I see fit.

397
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:22,666
[AKANE]
I'm sorry.

398
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,375
[GIRL]
Why are you apologizing?

399
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,916
After all, you didn't
do anything wrong.

400
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,583
[AKANE]
But still...

401
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:32,625
Hey.

402
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,250
[GIRL]
You missed a spot.

403
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,458
Right there.

404
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,541
By your ear.

405
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,083
The other side.

406
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,416
You dummy.

407
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,583
[AKANE crying]

408
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,791
I guess people can be nice.

409
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,708
[AKANE crying]

410
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,333
[GIRL]
Please be happy.

411
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,500
[AKANE crying]

412
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,083
[AKANE]
No...

413
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,416
There must've been another way.

414
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,583
It didn't have to be like this.

415
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,500
Your conscious and
subconscious both agreed.

416
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:21,458
They wanted to save this girl
and protect her from harm.

417
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:26,083
But in the end, you didn't
have enough power to do so.

418
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,791
[AKANE]
Dammit!

419
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:04,000
[SANTA CLAUSE]
Just you wait.

420
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,458
I've got a great
present for you.

421
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:09,291
[LOKI] Arthur's finally
going to make his big move.

422
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm shivering with anticipation.

423
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:14,416
[ARTHUR]
I'm heading for the Divine Gate,

424
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,541
and I'd like you to join me.
