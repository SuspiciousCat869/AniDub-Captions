[NARRATOR]
The girl runs swiftly

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,208
as if she were
riding the breeze.

3
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:19,583
She doesn't realize that
the future she runs toward

may not be what she expects.

Yeah!

[NARRATOR]
The two girls run hand in hand.

15
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:49,125
They don't understand that the
bond of friendship is fragile--

16
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:52,166
That it might eventually
fracture beyond repair.

How could they know
in these happy times?

That one day...

[NARRATOR] The only thing left
will be memories and tears

Hiya, Arthur.
It's been quite a while huh?

22
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,166
Well, well,
what do we have here?

23
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,000
The trickster god Loki is
gracing us with his presence?

24
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,333
Always good to see you, Oz.

25
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,083
Summoning both of us at once.

Let me guess,
it's a special occasion?

[ARTHUR]
Yesterday, I obtained the key.

28
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,958
We're going to open
the Divine Gate, gentlemen.

29

You mark my words.

You can't be serious, Arthur.

There's no way.

32
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,375
Interesting...

33
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,916
[OZ] Even if that's true, the
Council will never approve!

[LOKI chuckles]

35
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,416
So you called us here to get

36
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,916
your impossible mission
started, is that right?

37

I honestly don't care
whether you believe me or not.

38
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,000
But it's the truth.

00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,583
Help me and you'll see that.

40
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,541
Sure. I can't say no
to a preposterous challenge.

41
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,083
[OZ] Will you quit fooling
around and be serious for once?

42
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:54,041
What happens if you do manage
to open that damn Gate?

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,583
Then I will do
whatever has to be done.

44
00:03:58,666 --> 00:03:59,666
[LOKI]
Hmm...

45

Hmph. I'll support you
with all my magic,

but on one condition.

47

Whatever happens with the Gate,

48
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,666
you have to promise me
that you'll help the weak.

49
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,791
Agreed?

50
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,666
How about you watch from
the sidelines instead, Oz?

51
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,625
I'll make sure to
save you good seats.

[LOKI chuckles]

53
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,333
It seems it's not a
challenge, but an invitation.

54
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,666
I have to admit
that I'm interested.

55
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,833
So tell me, what does the
great and powerful wizard

56
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,833
have to say about
this development?

I just hope he's actually
half as confident

Very impressive!

She's able to hold
her own against Ginji.

She's more fired up than
she usually is, that's for sure.

But things don't always end well

the zone like this.

68

at Mount Hagakure!

That's crazy!

their wish granted!

Oh, please.

Oh yeah, definitely!

Yes, It's a cutthroat world.

But someone has to be
number one, don'tcha think?

Actually, I see you as the type

in front of the finish line.

It shoulda been
a foot race instead.

Then I would have
beaten all of you jerks,

and I would've been number one!

You said something
like that earlier.

195

What's all this about
having to be "number one"?

Is something wrong?

[MIDORI]
That may be the problem.

200
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,625
Maybe if I find the Divine Gate,

201

I'll have the answer.

my number one friend, anyway?

204
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,958
[NARRATOR] The wish that
her friend shared with her

205

is a whisper in the

207

It pulls her closer
to the holy Gate.

Wait a sec.

229
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,958
Nobody wears
their ties like that,

230
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,291
even though we're supposed to.

231
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,125
It's much cuter this way.

00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,458
[STUDENT 3B]
Walk with us?

233
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,583
Yeah, sure.

234
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,625
[NARRATOR] Even though she
knows the seasons change,

235
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,333
the girl thinks
the bonds of friendship

236
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,791
will withstand
the march of time.

237
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,958
But just as the leaves
of summer yield to autumn,

238
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,375
so too do relationships
turn brittle

239
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,458
and begin to fall apart.

240
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,500
[STUDENT 3B] I heard
they're gonna have fireworks

241
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,166
for this year's summer festival!

242
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,458
I know, I'm excited!

243
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,041
It's because so many
tourists are coming

244
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,625
to visit Mount Hagakure
these days.

245
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,958
I guess we have the
Divine Gate to thank!

246
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,125
Hey, Midori.

247
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,791
You wanna come to
the festival with us?

another person with me?

Yeah, we're fine with that.

But I don't think she'd
have a good time.

254
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,583
We've noticed you're the
only person she ever talks to.

255
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,208
No, that's not the case!

256
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,541
You just have to
get to know her,

257
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,208
and then you'll see
she's a really cool person.

258
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,958
She's super nice,
and fun to be around

259
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,583
once she gets
comfortable with you.

260
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,000
[MIDORI] A bigger group
will be so much fun.

261
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,500
Just give them a chance.

262
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,291
This is the perfect way for
you to get to know everyone.

263
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,041
[ELENA] But I don't want to
get to know any of those girls.

264
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,416
Why not?

265
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,708
Because I don't need
a whole bunch of friends.

You're the only one
I need, Midori.

You're my number one
best friend.

And we're best friends.

They're my friends, too.

274
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,750
Being number one
friends is the only thing

275
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,833
that matters, though.

276

You don't need anyone else.

We can all be friends!

The only thing

in this world is each other.

I see no reason for
that to change now.

283

You remember.
We made a promise back then.

And yet, there may
never be answers.

Still, the girl can't help but
reach out and try to grasp them.

I never saw my
best friend again.

There was a lot of talk about
what happened to her back then.

But I believe she's at the Gate.

May I ask you what's

You were really particular

00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,333
Aw, you don't have to worry.

324
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:25,375
I'll make sure to keep
you safe, 'kay, Daddy?

325
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,750
That's so kind of you.

326
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,041
Thank you, Bedi.

327
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,208
And you, Gawy.

328
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,416
[LANCELOT]
What a joke...

329
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,083
[KAY]
Here we go...

330
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,416
[LANCELOT]
Hmm?

331
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,791
Oh, sorry.

332
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,291
I guess I'm just dumbfounded
that we're doing this.

333
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:38,625
Lemme guess...

334
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,916
This is all that Santa Clause
guy's idea, right?

335
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,250
Of course it is!

336
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,916
What good ever came
from an out-of-season

337
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,833
Christmas present, anyway?

338
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,083
None, I bet.

339
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,666
There's a chill
in the air today.

340
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,875
I've just the thing.

341
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,708
Some soup will warm us up.

342
00:18:56,875 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm sure that Lance
will come around soon.

343
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,250
I know.

344
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,958
I need all my Knights of Round.

345
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,375
That's why I was so
selective in choosing them.

346
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,458
[K]
Y'know, it's funny.

347
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,166
You're not even sure
why you're here, are you?

348
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,666
Sure, you have a wish
you want granted.

349
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,416
But part of you doesn't
want for it to come true.

350
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,708
Because you're afraid
of what it would mean

351
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,416
and what it would do to you.

352
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,333
You're wrong. I have no wishes.

353
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,791
Okay, maybe not,

354
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,416
but you do have a big gaping
hole inside of your heart.

355
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,500
You try so hard to hide it,

356
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,166
but you'll never
be able to patch it up

357
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,750
and make it whole on your own;

358
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,750
you're gonna need
some outside help.

359
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:08,166
I couldn't care less about
reaching that stupid Gate.

360
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,166
That's what you think, but
your heart says otherwise.

361
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,791
Deep down, you want
your wish to be granted.

362
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,375
No, I don't have a wish.

363
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,708
Have you noticed
he spends a lot of time

364
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,500
talking to himself?

365
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,250
[AKANE]
What a weirdo.

366
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,958
Let's move!

367
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,208
Let's what?

368
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,291
Wait for me.

369
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:46,250
[AKANE] Y'know, we shouldn't
be snooping around like this.

370
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,250
[MIDORI] I just wanna be able
to help out if he's upset.

371
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,708
There's probably a lot
going on in his head.

372
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,333
[AKANE]
I wouldn't be surprised.

373
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:56,125
I mean, the guy did
murder his parents.

374
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:59,250
To be honest with you,
I don't think he did it.

375
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,916
It's just way
too crazy to be true.

376
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,041
Or he must have had
a really good reason.

377
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,958
[AKANE] Come on, you've
gotta stop making excuses

378
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,083
for this killer.

379
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:14,875
Whoa, what did you do?

380
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,125
[MIDORI]
Nothing!

381
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,458
I just entered Aoto's name
in the search bar

382
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,708
and then it kicked me out.

383
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,125
But...

384
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,666
I wonder why...

385
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:29,125
[AKANE] What did this guy do
to get his files restricted?

386
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,166
[SCHRÖDINGER]
Do you still think of it, Aoto?

387
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,166
I do.

388
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,166
I remember it so vividly--

389
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,708
The night we met each other.

390
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:09,708
[AKANE]
He might've killed his parents

391
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:11,458
and caused the Blue Christmas?

392
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:12,958
That's nuts.

393
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:14,916
[BREUNOR] You are trying to
find the truth, aren't you?

394
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,166
I'll tell you.
