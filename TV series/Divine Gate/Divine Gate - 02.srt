1
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:15,916
[NARRATOR] The boy was young
when he first felt the flames.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,416
They were born from the warmth
of his father's love,

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,625
sparked by the bond
between parent and child.

4
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:23,750
This fire made him feel safe.

5
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,291
Now those flames guide the boy

6
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:29,250
as he tries to put
his life to good use.

7
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,000
He strives for
the same salvation

8
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,708
that his father pursued--

9
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:35,666
Redemption through
a cleansing fire.

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,000
The boy's blazing eyes search
the horizon for his father,

11
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,583
even though he knows that
he'll never see him again.

12
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:45,541
[AKANE yells]

13
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:50,041
[NARRATOR] He tries to live
up to his father's legacy.

14
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:51,791
To make him proud.

15
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:56,083
You're so sweaty.

16
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:01,625
Do you want me
to hose you off a little?

17
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:03,583
Yeah, no, thanks.

18
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,541
Fire and water don't mix
together very well, remember?

19
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,666
He seems kinda upset.

20
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,750
It must be because
of what Aoto said.

21
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:14,583
Save your breath.

22
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,791
I did kill them.
It was my fault.

23
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:22,291
[MIDORI] It's gotta hurt
since Akane lost his father.

24
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,500
[LOKI]
Ah, good morning, Arthur.

25
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,291
I see you stayed
the night again.

26
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,333
[LOKI]
Enjoy.

27
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,166
I made it just
the way you like it.

28
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,958
Why are you here, Loki?

29
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,250
[LOKI]
Don't sound so cold.

30
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:30,333
Every king needs a
god looking out for him.

31
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:31,750
So here I am.

32
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,000
By the way, I heard
you're trying to recruit

33
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,291
another kid with powers
into the Academy.

34
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,833
[chuckles]

35
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,250
[LOKI]
I can't wait to meet him.

36
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,750
What kind of boy have
you found for us this time?

37
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,166
Don't make that ugly face.

38
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,708
If you've taken an
interest in this kid,

39
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,208
then of course
I'm interested, too.

40
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,500
[K]
It's painful, isn't it?

41
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,833
Every time you see dry
bread and milk together?

42
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,750
Then you're reminded
of painful memories.

43
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,375
I try not to think
about those days.

44
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,541
You can try all you like,

45
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,666
but those thoughts
are gonna keep coming.

46
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,875
They're like scars
left on your heart.

47
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,000
You're forced
to relive the pain,

48
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,208
knowing it's impossible
to reach into the past

49
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,166
and change the
things you regret.

50
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,750
[MIDORI]
Hiya, Aoto!

51
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,250
I'm so glad we caught you!

52
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,208
[AOTO]
What are you doing here?

53
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,625
We came to pick you up!

54
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,250
Now we're off to the Academy!

55
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,458
You may think we're a nuisance,

56
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,416
but we're just trying
to be good friends.

57
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,583
Well, a good teacher,
in my case.

58
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,583
I'm not his friend.

59
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,041
Do these little
furry guys belong to you?

60
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,416
[AOTO]
No.

61
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,833
[MIDORI]
Oh, okay.

62
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,000
But you feed them?

63
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,875
Sometimes, when I feel like it.

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,458
That's horrible.

65
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,666
They'll grow to depend on you
and think you actually care.

66
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,500
Well, whatever the case,
they do look pretty happy.

67
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,791
[AKANE]
Think for a second, gah!

68
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:19,041
Imagine how sad they'll
feel when he betrays them.

69
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,000
[MIDORI]
You've got a point.

70
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,500
[UNDINE] Maybe it's a
little early in the day

71
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,041
to be talking about
betrayal, Akane.

72
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,750
You're forgetting
that deep down inside,

73
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,791
we all have a kind heart
and want to make the world

74
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,541
a better place
for everyone else.

75
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,333
Only sometimes our other
emotions get in the way.

76
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,416
I don't believe that.

77
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,041
[MIDORI growls]

78
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,208
I don't.

79
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,583
Anyway, we should
get on to the Academy.

80
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,541
Will it make me a better person?

81
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:44,666
[AKANE]
Who knows?

82
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,041
That's up to you,
not anybody else.

83
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,375
Besides, with--

84
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:49,041
[MIDORI] Is there something
you want to work on

85
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,458
specifically, Aoto?

86
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,083
It might help to know that.

87
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,875
You have to say
some things out loud

88
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,458
for them to become true.

89
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,708
What? Don't tell me
you've suddenly gone mute.

90
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,166
We're not mind readers.

91
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,125
[AKANE sighs]
We're getting nowhere.

92
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,958
I knew this was gonna
be a waste of time.

93
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,166
Hey, hold up!

94
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,583
Sorry about that.

95
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:25,833
He's always been impatient,

96
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,208
but it's like he's been
extra on-edge lately.

97
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,875
Plus, with all the rumors...

98
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,000
[MIDORI] I know we're asking
a lot of questions

99
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,208
about stuff that's
kinda personal.

100
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,416
We're just trying to
get to know you better.

101
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,666
Because, honestly, we feel
connected to you in some way.

102
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:45,708
[METABON]
That short fuse of yours

103
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,958
is going to get you
in trouble one day, bon.

104
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:48,875
What?

105
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,333
That was nothing
back there, man.

106
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,625
Then why're you
so frustrated, bon?

107
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,333
Just forget it.

108
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,041
Anyway, where are we right now?

109
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,541
I thought the
Council had fixed up

110
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,416
all of Terrastia's
neighborhoods.

111
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,583
You can repaint a building,

112
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,500
but that doesn't
make it new, bon.

113
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,375
Ugh, it's all so stupid.

114
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,500
That boy's a punk and
the Council only looks like

115
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,083
it's helping out.

116
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,875
[AKANE]
You know, if my dad were here,

117
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,625
he'd actually be
getting stuff done.

118
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,583
He had sway over the Council.

119
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,916
They called him
the Genius of Divine.

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,125
I think they needed him
to guide them.

121
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,541
But then...

122
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,750
There was an accident
during one of his experiments,

123
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,291
and he was killed.

124
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,500
At least, that's
what the Council told us.

125
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,541
I don't believe it
for a second, though.

126
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,666
My dad was brilliant.

127
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,166
He wouldn't have made
a fatal mistake.

128
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,833
That's one of the reasons
you're still trying

129
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,333
to find the Divine Gate,
isn't it, bon?

130
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,541
You're not sure what happened,

131
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,250
so you want to know
the whole truth, bon.

132
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,541
Shut up!

133
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:56,000
[MIDORI] Akane's tried to
follow in his dad's footsteps.

134
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:59,541
But now that he's gone,
the path isn't so clear.

135
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:00,875
Explains a lot.

136
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,625
Like why he's so hostile to me,

137
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,208
seeing as I killed
my own parents.

138
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,666
I still can't believe that,
even if you do say it's true.

139
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,000
Unless you had a good
reason for doing it.

140
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,166
Your past isn't the important
thing about you, though.

141
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,583
This is what counts.

142
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,875
Right here.

143
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:25,541
[MIDORI]
Bye for now.

144
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:26,791
See ya later!

145
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,250
[K]
Deep down, you know this,

146
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:33,000
but I'm going to say it anyway.

147
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,000
If you want to know more
about that red-haired boy,

148
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,708
you should go and find him.

149
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,250
If you do, maybe you'll
end up feeling a little better,

150
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,166
but then again, maybe you won't.

151
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,333
One thing's for sure--

152
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,666
Nothing's gonna change
if you stay still.

153
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,125
[AOTO] I shouldn't get
close to anyone ever again.

154
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,166
[K]
That's probably true,

155
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,500
but you can't
control your heart,

156
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,833
as much as you like
to pretend you can.

157
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,833
Gimme whatever you got.

158
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,291
What do you want?

159
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,708
How about all
of your change?

160

00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,458
It's not water from
the sky that drowns him,

324
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,625
but the crushing tears of
memories he'd rather forget.

325
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,791
[AOTO'S MOTHER]
Aoto, please, no!

326
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:05,875
[AOTO'S FATHER]
Stop! Don't!

327
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:06,708
[AOTO'S MOTHER]
You can't!

328
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:09,041
Don't kill us! Someone help!

329
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,375
Catch ya later, big brother.

330
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,208
Take care.

331
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,416
[AOTO]
Don't go!

332
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:55,916
[AOTO]
Wait...

333
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,166
[AOTO gasps]

334
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,083
[ARITON]
Did you see it?

335
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,541
The Divine Gate?

336
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:09,791
Behind me?

337
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,416
[AOTO yelps]

338
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,750
Ah! That hurt, big brother!

339
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,541
On second thought,

340
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,916
maybe we shouldn't see
each other ever again.

341
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:40,041
[AKANE] Even if you're in pain,
don't let it control you.

342
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,208
[ARTHUR sighs]
I'm going to call it a night.

343
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,083
[ARTHUR]
Handle the rest.

344
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,666
[TRISTAN]
You got it, boss.

345
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,125
You know, it's strange...

346
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:06,291
You go by the name
of Santa Clause,

347
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,750
and yet you show up
with presents

348
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,166
even when it's not
the holiday season.

349
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,833
Yes, but only for you, Arthur.

350
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,291
Merry Christmas.

351
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:26,125
[ARTHUR] I'm happy you finally
decided to attend the Academy.

352
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,500
They badgered me into it.

353
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:29,375
Whatever!

354
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,458
You jerk.

355
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:31,541
You came here on your own.

356
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:32,708
Hey, watch your mouth.

357
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,458
He's one of us.

358
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,708
Either way, I'm glad.

359
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,333
Now, I've got
important news for you.

360
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,666
Something very special
has come into my possession.

361
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,916
A gift.

362
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,958
Like Christmas came
early this year?

363
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,541
Yesterday, I obtained the key.

364
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,000
[MIDORI]
The what?

365
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,416
[ARTHUR] The key that will
lead us to the Divine Gate.

366
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,083
The key that will make
all our dream come true.

367
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,125
[MIDORI gasps]

368
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,541
You mean it?

369
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,958
The Gate's real?

370
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,708
Seriously?

371
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,791
The Divine Gate.

372
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:12,916
That's right.

373
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,083
And we're going to open it up.

374
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,875
[NARRATOR] The boy's
conscious and subconscious

375
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,000
both desired to move forward.

376
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,000
I must see him again.

377
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,458
I must grab his hand once again.

378
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,375
[DOROTHY] I'd ask to be
your number one best friend

379
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:04,750
forever and ever.

380
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:06,708
That's what I want
most in the world.

381
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:08,125
[NARRATOR] The wish that
her friend shared with her

382
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:10,166
is a whisper in the
background of every beat

383
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,458
of the girl's heart.

384
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:12,916
[MIDORI] Why was it
so important for her

385
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,958
to be my number
one friend, anyway?
