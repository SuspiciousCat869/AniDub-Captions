the moon turns blue.

00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:25,500
[NARRATOR] He's aware that
such a moon shines on him,

Hey, I got a question.

So... what's the deal
with you and the Council?

35

What are you talking about?

Um...

37
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,625
It's nothing, but uh...

38
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:39,875
We just...

Ugh! I'm gonna
come out and say it.

Here's the thing.

When we tried to find
your files on the server,

it said they were

Totally confidential.

So you were snooping
around in my files.

killed 666 innocent people.

So then why was it
called an accident?

[AKANE] The World Council

who used a blade
made out of water

[MIDORI] It looks like he was
investigated as a suspect,

The night we met each other.

321
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,416
[SCHRÖDINGER]
You've got the same clear eyes.

322
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,250
But you're not
the one I'm longing for.

323
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,625
I guess the first love
really is hopeless, isn't it?

324
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:07,791
Where is he?

325
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:08,916
Aoto...

326
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,583
[SCHRÖDINGER]
Since you're here, imposter,

327
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,625
I'll give you the present
I was going to give my Aoto.

328
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,375
A glorious testament
to my devotion!

329
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,000
[SCHRÖDINGER]
Samidare!

330
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,333
It's time to wake up,
my darling.

331
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:30,166
Demonstrate your power
by killing them all!

332
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,083
[BREUNOR yells]

333
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,583
Man, we gotta
stop that thing...

334
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:46,208
[NARRATOR] When he fell
in love for the first time,

335
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,083
the man gave up his boring
life to devote himself

336
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,125
completely to someone else.

337
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,125
As his obsession grew stronger,

338
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:59,750
a doll was made to stand in
for the object of his affection.

339
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,458
But when he realized that
his first love was hopeless,

340
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:09,000
suddenly a new,
untroubled love was born.

341
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,125
Right in front of him.

342
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,125
It had been there all along.

343
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,208
[AKANE yells]

344
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,625
[SCHRÖDINGER]
That was wonderful.

345
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,458
Wait! Don't go!

346
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,916
You can't just leave without
telling me where he is!

347
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,041
[SCHRÖDINGER] I'm positive
I'll see you again, other Aoto.

348
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,541
Goodbye for now.

349
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:46,791
Damn!

350
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,708
There's no way
we'll catch him now.

351
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,833
[BREUNOR]
Who were you trying to find?

352
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,333
I need you to
tell me what you know

353
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,375
about the Blue
Christmas incident.

354
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,500
It was me. I did it.

355
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,541
[BREUNOR]
Don't lie to me, idiot.

356
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,541
One day soon you're gonna
tell me everything you know.

357
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:17,833
So weird.

358
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,583
What are the odds
it still works?

359
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,500
[AKANE]
Huh? What even is this thing?

360
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:25,916
[MIDORI, AKANE yell]

361
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,291
Step away!

362
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:32,958
Hello.

363
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,541
What is your command, Master?

364
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,166
"Master"? What?

365
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,791
Does she mean me?

366
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,166
Yeah, I think so.

367
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,041
Looks like we got
a new teammate.

368
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,791
This would be the perfect
thing to post about, Aoto!

369
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,125
A picture of this
moment will make

370
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,708
for a great first entry
on your Friend Log!

371
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,333
[camera shutter clicks]

372
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,250
[MIDORI]
That looks awesome!

373
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,625
If you say so.

374
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:57,750
[phone chimes]

375
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,166
This is excellent!

376
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,458
[AKANE] Whoa, did I really
just catch you smiling?

377
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,833
[AOTO]
Uh, no.

378
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,375
[AKANE]
You totally did!

379
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,541
[AOTO]
No, I didn't.

380
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,958
[MIDORI] Ooh!
Are you embarrassed, Aoto?

381
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:27,000
[ARITON] So you finally made
some friends, big brother.

382
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:03,458
[ARTHUR] The most
important lessons in life

383
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:06,166
aren't always learned
on the battlefield.

384
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,291
[AKANE] But surely you have a
couple of things in your life

385
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:11,250
that you consider
special, don't you?

386
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:14,041
[GIRL] It's funny--happy
people always think that.
