1
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:17,916
[LOKI laughs]

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,625
[LOKI] It seems your
friends are trying to mount

3
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:21,291
some sort of rescue!

4
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,541
Don't underestimate them.

5
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:24,791
You have the upper hand now,

6
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:27,125
but that can change
in an instant.

7
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:28,791
I'm not worried.

8
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,833
Soon, I'll be showing you
the greatest tragedy

9
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,666
this world has ever seen.

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,000
I hope you're looking
forward to it.

11
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:38,333
Santa's not the kind of person
who backs down from a challenge.

12
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:39,875
[LOKI]
Maybe not...

13
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,666
But what hope
does one person have

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,750
fighting against
a bunch of gods?

15
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,333
What gods?

16
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,125
Don't tell me you forgot.

17
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,541
The gods Oz summoned
are still patrolling the paths

18
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,000
leading to the Divine Gate.

19
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:53,750
The Scandinavians.

20
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:56,208
That's right.

21
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:57,708
The same ones who
completely slaughtered

22
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,791
your beloved Knights of Round.

23
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:04,583
I hope our friend Santa Clause
had a good Christmas last year,

24
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,250
because he won't even be
able to recognize this world

25
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,250
when my plan is finished.

26
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,000
[AOTO]
What happened?

27
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,416
[AOTO]
It's you.

28
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,541
[K giggles]

29
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,583
[K]
You're finally awake, Aoto.

30
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:01,708
Do you have any idea
where we are?

31
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,583
[AOTO] Some place that's
close to the Divine Gate?

32
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:05,958
[K]
Yes.

33
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,708
This may look like a tower,
but it's really a path.

34
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,208
So... Let's go!

35
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:16,041
Those powerful gods will find
us if we keep standing here.

36
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,500
Where are the others?

37
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:22,208
[AKANE] Man, just when I thought
things couldn't get any weirder.

38
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,291
What is this place?

39
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:27,375
And what am I supposed
to do now, huh?

40
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:31,083
Hey, Midori! Or Aoto!

41
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,916
Where the hell is everybody?

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,583
Can anyone hear me?

43
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,583
[buzzing noise]

44
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,791
[AKANE]
Holy crap!

45
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,416
You can't be
serious with this!

46
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,000
I hope everyone
else is doing okay.

47
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,708
An explosion?

48
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,416
Is someone fighting back there?

49
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:18,750
Midori...

50
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,333
Dammit.

51
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,000
[PAVLOV] I'm disappointed
you didn't take 'em out, Akane.

52
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,458
[PAVLOV] Haven't you inherited
your dad's firepower?

53
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,666
[AKANE] I'm not gonna fall for
this again, you fake bastard!

54
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,000
[PAVLOV] Huh?
What are you talking about?

55
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,500
I know I've been
away for a while, kid,

56
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,208
but I assure you that
I'm the real deal...

57
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,791
Here, I'll show you.

58
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,125
One... Two...

59
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,291
Whaddaya say, kid?

60
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,333
They're inside.

61
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,916
[UNDINE]
Yeah. I can sense them, too.

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,291
[SYLPH] Guess we know
what to do, huh?

63
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,916
[crashing noise]

64
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,333
What was that?

65
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,500
Bad news, whatever it was.

66
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,083
We gotta find them!

67
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,833
Thank goodness.
You're really okay!

68
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,125
No, you stay back.

69
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,541
You're another imposter,
just like before.

70
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,916
You're not gonna trick me again!

71
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,208
Wait, what are
you talking about?

72
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,041
You better stop before
you make me really angry.

73
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,458
Midori...

74
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,208
I get it.

75
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,791
If fighting with you is the only
way to prove it's really me,

76
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:09,833
then so be it.

77
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,291
Let's see what you've learned.

78
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:23,125
If this is some kinda trick,
then I'm gonna destroy you!

79
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,583
You can come at me with
all you've got, Akane...

80
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,791
But I'm not fighting my own son.

81
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,875
If you're really my father,
give me some proof.

82
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,125
All right, kid,

83
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,750
how about the fact that
you were born ass first,

84
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,166
and blue because
you weren't breathing.

85
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,458
It was your mom who
insisted on a natural birth,

86
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:43,125
even with all the scientific
shortcuts available to her.

87
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,500
It all worked out, though.

88
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,750
You started crying as
soon as I smacked your butt.

89
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,958
That's impossible...

90
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,041
Mom said she never told anyone.

91
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:57,083
I've put you and your mother
through some really hard times.

92
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,625
Yeah, you have.

93
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:03,791
Listen to me.
You have to give up on this.

94
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,083
It's not too late.

95
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,125
I'll talk to the Council.

96
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,666
See if I can get
them to pardon you.

97
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,208
Wait. Hold on for
just a damn minute.

98
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:14,541
You have no idea what
the Council is capable of.

99
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,958
They made the Knights
of Round disappear.

100
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,541
Permanently.

101
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,125
I'm well aware.

102
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:23,541
Your dear ol' dad played a part
in that massacre as well.

103
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,125
It couldn't be helped.

104
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,416
Blame the Divine Gate for
causing this chaotic world,

105
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,375
leaving us with no options.

106
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:34,000
A fair many lives have been
lost thanks to the Gate,

107
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,708
because of all the
disasters it caused.

108
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,625
And yet, we still need it there
to maintain the fragile balance

109
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:43,041
between worlds, or else even
more chaos would rain down.

110
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,958
That's why I've devoted my
life to researching the Gate,

111
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,000
so we can truly understand it.

112
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:53,250
The Driver you use,
the subspace we call "zones,"

113
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,125
those autonomous machines...

114
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,291
They're all byproducts
of the research we've done

115
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,583
on the Divine Gate.

116
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,083
A silver lining
to all this, I guess.

117
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,250
I don't believe that
there was no other way...

118
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:10,041
How can you be so calm
about all those deaths?

119
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,416
'Cause it was for
the greater good;

120
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,541
we couldn't allow Arthur
to destroy the Gate.

121
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,541
There were casualties,
yes, but in the end

122
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,833
we saved countless lives.

123
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,916
I don't want you to
become a casualty, too.

124
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,583
Just shut up.

125
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,125
No more excuses.

126
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:27,750
Our family was already a
casualty of this stupid fight.

127
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,666
[AKANE]
All those lies...

128
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,708
And yet Mom always said
you were a great man.

129
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,083
[AKANE]
Mom, why did Dad leave?

130
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,125
And why isn't he coming back?

131
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:43,041
Is it because
he doesn't love us?

132
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:46,708
Akane, you may be too young
to understand this, but...

133
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,791
Your father can't come back
because he's out there

134
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,250
fighting for us.

135
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:55,333
Yes. It must all be for us.

136
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,458
[crying softly]

137
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,625
You destroyed us!

138
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,125
Screw the greater good if
it means sacrificing the lives

139
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,875
of everyone around you!

140
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,750
I'm not going back!

141
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,666
I'm gonna go find
the Gate again

142
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,041
and fix this!

143
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:19,625
If this is who you are,
I wish you'd've stayed dead!

144
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,625
[AKANE yelling]

145
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,750
Oh, is that so?

146
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:28,125
Then show me the
fire in your heart.

147
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,125
Let's see how strong
my selfish kid is.

148
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,625
[LOKI] Conflict is the heart
of every good story.

149
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,708
The closer our main
players get to the Gate,

150
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:43,000
the more their dreams begin
to fall apart in front of them.

151
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,500
[ARTHUR] And none of them
have even had to face

152
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,666
the Scandinavian gods yet.

153
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,458
[LOKI chuckles]
I know, isn't it wonderful?

154
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,000
Yes, it is.

155
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:54,583
This is where your arrogance
might begin to cause problems.

156
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,083
[LOKI]
Oh?

157
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,750
[ARTHUR] You plan to have these
kids open the Divine Gate

158
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:02,750
so you can remake the world from
scratch however you see fit.

159
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,875
You're oversimplifying it.

160
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,208
Though, yes,
that is the endgame.

161
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,291
But none of them will
be able to reach the Gate

162
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:13,416
without a key,
even if they are Adapters.

163
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,000
Right now only one of them
has the ability to open it.

164
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,041
The other two need
to experience something

165
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:22,375
in order to obtain
their Gate keys--

166
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:25,041
True despair.

167
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,250
That's the key?

168
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,666
[laughing]

169
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,833
Oh, and there is another
thing you forgot about, Arthur.

170
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,833
You left yourself
out of my plan.

171
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,541
I'm still going
to make you a king.

172
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,333
One who controls
this whole world.

173
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:39,416
[ARTHUR]
You're insane.

174
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,125
[LOKI laughing]

175
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:46,916
[SAINT A (DANTE)]
Ginji...

176
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,208
You knew that Akane,
Aoto, and Midori

177
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,625
were alive this
whole time, didn't you?

178
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,291
Tell the truth.

179
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,416
[SAINT B (AEGIS)] There's
no need to be defensive.

180
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,791
We're not blaming you
for any of this.

181
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:04,958
Loki was manipulating
everyone, wasn't he?

182
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,958
[SAINT C (JOHANN)] We realize
now that we should never

183
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,208
have trusted Loki.

184
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,416
His scheming has
even destroyed Oz.

185
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,458
So.

186
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,833
What do you want me
to do about it?

187
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,416
[SAINT A (DANTE)] I'll be
completely up front with you.

188
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,541
Powerful agents of Celestia and
Hellistia are now on the move

189
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:25,041
due to Arthur's selfish actions.

190
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:28,041
Like it or not, the
Council needs your help.

191
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:32,500
You still have an important role
to play in all of this madness.

192
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,625
Hang on, what
are you talking about?

193
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,250
I'm just a student.

194
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,083
[SAINT C (JOHANN)]
No, you're more than that.

195
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,791
This may come as
a surprise to you,

196
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,458
but you're the only one
here who can reach the Gate.

197
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,833
So we need your help.

198
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,666
[GINJI]
I'm the only one?

199
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,875
[SAINT A (DANTE)] It seems your
friends were important figures

200
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,666
in Celestia and Hellistia,

201
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,000
and those worlds are
looking to reclaim them.

202
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,125
You don't mean
Hikari and Yukari?

203
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,208
Um... Who's there?

204
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:05,000
[SERVANT 10A] We've come
to bring you home, Princess.

205
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,916
Princess? What do you mean?

206
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,291
Oh, hello.

207
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,125
Are you from Hellistia?

208
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,875
You don't seem surprised
to see us standing here.

209
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,916
Do you understand that
we've been looking for you?

210
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,708
Yes.

211
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,541
Suddenly everything's
starting to come into focus.

212
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,791
[ARTHUR] You couldn't have
planned a more roundabout way

213
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,333
of doing this.

214
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,250
[LOKI] I'm well aware; this
scheme has too many variables

215
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,875
for my taste, but I'm afraid
your little trick is to blame,

216
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,166
my friend.

217
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,291
Ah. So you know
about that, eh?

218
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,750
I cursed you to ensure
you were mine to control,

219
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,166
body and soul, Arthur.

220
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,666
And yet you put up resistance,

221
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,958
almost as if you
planned for this.

222
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,250
You may think humans
are weak subjects,

223
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,166
but we won't let you destroy
our world without a fight.

224
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,041
Why yes, I see that now...

225
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,875
And I know the reason
you can resist me

226
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,083
is because I only have a
part of you locked up here.

227
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,291
Tell me, my defiant king...

228
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,208
Where have you hidden the
rest of your fractured heart?

229
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,541
So there's still
some hope left.

230
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,666
[HOGNE]
I finally found you.

231
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:45,791
Come on.

232
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,166
I wanna see how much fun
you are before you die.

233
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,416
Sorry, but I don't
have time to play!

234
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,041
You're gonna have
to do better than that!

235
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,291
[HOGNE]
Where'd he go?

236
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:05,250
[OZ] That's it. I can't
take it anymore, Dorothy.

237
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,166
We're going to search for
the kids from the Academy

238
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,541
and keep them from
doing anything stupid.

239
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:12,750
Dorothy?

240
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,500
[MIDORI yells]

241
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:26,666
I'm not gonna let you tarnish
my memories of Elena anymore!

242
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,250
What are you saying?

243
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,250
[MIDORI]
She's my number one best friend!

244
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,958
I've been looking for her
ever since she disappeared.

245
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,250
Were you really thinking
of me all this time, Midori?

246
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,291
Wow, that means so much to me.

247
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,250
[MIDORI]
No way...

248
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,916
You're really Elena?

249
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,625
Well, yeah.

250
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,125
I've been trying to tell you
that from the beginning.

251
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,250
[MIDORI]
But how?

252
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,291
I've been wanting
to apologize to you.

253
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,958
Can you ever forgive me?

254
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,125
Stop right there.

255
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,833
Everything is fine.

256
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,916
It's been a long time
since the day I left.

257
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,916
Neither of us are the same
person we were back then.

258
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,791
I have comrades, and a place
where I feel like I belong now.

259
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:15,958
Comrades?

260
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:16,958
[ELENA]
Yeah...

261
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,291
So don't worry about it.

262
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,208
[MIDORI]
It's just that...

263
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,958
I've been... trying to...

264
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,625
You're the one who said our
friendship was "a little much."

265
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:25,916
Remember that?

266
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,916
[ELENA] I even go by a
new name these days.

267
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,375
Everyone calls me Dorothy.

268
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:41,250
But you can still call me Elena.

269
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,875
So much has changed.

270
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,041
Elena... This is crazy!

271
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,166
That's just life.

272
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,625
We grow and we move on.

273
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:48,666
[chuckles]

274
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:53,958
Anyway...

275
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,416
The reason I'm here
is to tell you to quit.

276
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,250
Stop risking your life.

277
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,958
Oh! Sorry...

278
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,500
I know I shouldn't
tell you what to do,

279
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,833
but I just want you to be safe!

280
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,250
Elena...

281
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,625
I found you.

282
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,791
[ELENA]
A Scandinavian god!

283
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,291
[K] Looks like we might get
there without being spotted.

284
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,458
[AOTO]
Where are my friends?

285
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,375
Don't worry.
Once they know despair too,

286
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,208
they'll join you at the Gate.

287
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,000
What does that mean?

288
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,541
[UNDINE]
Hey, Aoto!

289
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:28,791
[AOTO]
Undine!

290
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,875
Oh, good, you're okay!

291
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:38,416
Just as I suspected.
You're able to see me, too.

292
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,250
Yeah.

293
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,125
I've always been
able to see you.

294
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,708
[DOROTHY yells]

295
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,083
Pathetic humans...

296
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,875
You're so fragile.

297
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,166
[MIDORI]
This isn't your fight, Elena.

298
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,791
Get out of here
before you get hurt.

299
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,583
I'm the one she's after.

300
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:00,583
Don't worry.

301
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,041
We'll have time
to catch up later!

302
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,416
But... Wait! Midori!

303
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,000
Bet you can't keep up with me.

304
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:13,625
When it comes to running, I'm
better than anyone, even a god.

305
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,458
Ha! So you wanna have a contest?

306
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,583
Okay. I'll show you who's best.

307
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,833
Don't tell me that weak
punch is all you got.

308
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,416
Oh, I'll show you!

309
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,333
Akane, freeze. Don't move!

310
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,416
[AKANE]
Huh?

311
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,375
[AKANE]
Oh, this is bad!

312
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,583
A god from an
outlying region...

313
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,416
Guess he musta gotten bored.

314
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,416
I'd like for you
to meet my sword.

315
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,375
I wonder which of you will
be Laevateinn's first victim.

316
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,541
Watch, kid.

317
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,166
This is the true power
of science and machines.

318
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,750
[AKANE gasps]

319
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,666
What are you doing?
Stop, Dad!

320
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,041
[PAVLOV]
Now listen up.

321
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,708
You follow the path
you think is right

322
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,791
and never stop fightin', okay?

323
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,458
[PAVLOV] I'll be the one
takin' you down.

324
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,000
Excellent...

325
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,041
The father, and then the son.

326
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,625
I feel like you're
underestimatin' me.

327
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:32,916
Oh?

328
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,708
You can't dodge
that thing forever!

329
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,791
You must not have listened.

330
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,916
I said I'd take you down.

331
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,583
Akane. Take care of your mom.

332
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:18,958
For me, kid.

333
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:31,750
[MIDORI yells]

334
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,791
[HODR]
There's nowhere left to run.

335
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,208
Don't worry, I'll make
sure you die quickly.

336
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,958
It's all over now!

337
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,750
No! Why, Elena?

338
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,125
Why would you...?

339
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,208
Best friends...

340
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,333
Until the very end.

341
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,666
Elena!

342
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,000
Forgive me.

343
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,541
[AKANE]
No!

344
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,791
You can't just die
like that, dammit!

345
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:22,500
We were waiting for
you to come back, Dad!

346
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,750
You can't...

347
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,791
Not again!

348
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,291
[AKANE crying]

349
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,666
No, it can't be...

350
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:44,958
[MIDORI crying]

351
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,333
[MIDORI]
Why?

352
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,958
Elena!

353
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,791
We were finally reunited.

354
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,083
There were so many things
I wanted to tell you...

355
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,750
Why?

356
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,916
[MIDORI sobbing]

357
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,375
[LOKI laughing]

358
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,541
[LOKI] It sounds like the other
two have obtained their keys

359
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,583
to the Divine Gate.

360
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,833
But the boy who already knew
despair is the closest to it.

361
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,000
It's been such a long time.

362
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,625
I've been waiting
for you, big brother.

363
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:03,666
What's your life like?

364
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,875
How does it feel to be
falsely accused of the crimes

365
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:07,083
your little brother committed?

366
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:09,083
Of course, you're still
playing the martyr.

367
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:11,458
No brother,
you made me this way!

368
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:13,291
[ARITON] I've thrown
away all sense of guilt!

369
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:14,708
Let's go!

370
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:16,875
[ARITON] Sorry, brother.
This is the only way to free us.
