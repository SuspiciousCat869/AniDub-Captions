1
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:12,250
[LOKI] You seem determined
to go, no matter what.

2
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:13,458
[ARTHUR]
Yes.

3
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:15,541
At this point, a god
could stand in my way,

4
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:17,708
and I wouldn't even blink.

5
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,208
Such commitment.

6
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,708
You must have a
really good reason.

7
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:25,041
After all, only a fool would
dare to challenge a god.

8
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,791
You know I hate it when
you beat around the bush

9
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,541
like this.

10
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:33,375
Loki, don't tell me you're
going to try and stop me.

11
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:37,125
You're the one who's avoiding
the real subject here, Arthur.

12
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,416
Let's talk about
what's really at stake.

13
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,208
If you do reach the Divine Gate,

14
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,666
what is it you are actually
going to wish for?

15
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,333
[inaudible]

16
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:05,500
My Knights.

17
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,250
Let us begin our quest!

18
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:40,958
[NARRATOR]
Some time ago,

19
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:44,041
a holy portal known as
the Divine Gate opened,

20
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:48,291
and in an instant merged three
different worlds into one.

21
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,375
Now, an ambitious king
heads toward the place

22
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,750
where it all began
to do whatever he must

23
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,875
to bring order back to life.

24
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,291
[ARTHUR] There's one thing
I want to say to everyone

25
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,083
before we get started.

26
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,416
I don't care what troubles
may lie ahead of us.

27
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,833
I will finish this mission.

28
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,875
Once I reach that holy place,

29
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,833
I'm going to destroy
the Divine Gate.

30
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,250
He wants to destroy it?

31
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,291
What does that mean?

32
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:18,041
[ARTHUR] The Gate is the
cause of all our problems.

33
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,958
It brought chaos to our lives
when the three planes merged,

34
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,750
creating a world that's
understood only by

35
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,416
a few elite leaders.

36
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,083
They cover up
our city's dirty secrets.

37
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,500
The peace they maintain
is nothing but an illusion.

38
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,375
That's why I've decided
to return the world

39
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:34,583
to its original state,

40
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,083
the way it was before
everything changed.

41
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,500
[chiming noise]

42
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,041
[OPERATOR 1A]
The Nontron is in position.

43
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,958
Now preparing to
open the Divine Gate.

44
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,458
[OPERATOR 1A]
Ready to move on!

45
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:55,958
Is that...?

46
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,083
Where are we?

47
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,000
This path will
lead us to the Gate.

48
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,250
We still have quite
the journey ahead of us.

49
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,291
So the Gate is
inside the zone?

50
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,125
[BREUNOR]
You've got it all twisted.

51
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,625
The zone was just a byproduct
of the research we did

52
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,708
to find the Gate
in the first place.

53
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,250
[GINJI]
It's huge.

54
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,250
Is that the Divine Gate?

55
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:29,958
Strange.

56
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:30,875
You think?

57
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,125
Calm down.

58
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,416
We're still a good ways
from our destination.

59
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,750
Yes.

60
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,958
We'll pass through many
Gates before we reach it.

61
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,208
On guard.

62
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,166
For what?

63
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,458
Weapons out!

They're autonomous Drivers!

But how?

00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,833
Loki. This has
your name all over it.

67
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,416
[LOKI] There's nothing more
boring than an easy quest.

68
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,458
At least, for those
of us watching.

69
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,250
Now, let's dance.

70

Hold on!

71
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,000
Those are gods.

[OZ]
Arthur...

73
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:15,125
You have no one but yourself
to blame for this mess.

74
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:22,791
[NARRATOR]
The gods watch over the world

75
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,000
from a high place of power,

76
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,916
rarely descending
to the dirty streets

77
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,916
where lowly humans dwell.

78
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,583
Sometimes they test them,

79
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,458
but they never help them.

80
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,625
Humans have no choice
but to endure their whims.

81
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:40,416
Ha! So this is the trouble
you were talking about.

82
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,250
Scandinavian gods, huh?

83
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,166
Huh... What do ya say; do you
think we can beat 'em or what?

84
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,916
No, of course not; they're gods.

85
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,958
But we can certainly fight them
and buy Arthur some time.

86
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:53,041
Yeah, we'll distract them so
Daddy can go after the big Gate!

87
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,291
That's the spirit.

00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,208
This mission isn't over yet.

Are you sure?

00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:05,833
We don't have the
time to stand around

94
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:08,416
and try to think
of another plan now.

[AKANE]
What's going on, Arthur?

103
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,500
Are the knights seriously
gonna fight gods?

104

They're providing
a diversion for us.

But why are the
gods even here?

Against those guys,

even the Knights of Round
don't stand a chance.

They knew the path
to the Divine Gate

109

would be a dangerous one.

and keep you from reaching it.

164
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,666
[LANCELOT yells]

165
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:57,708
They're crazy.

166
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,833
Why don't they retreat?

167
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:03,250
Why would they try to
fight against the gods?!

168
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,791
I never meant
for this to happen!

169
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,375
[ARTHUR]
That's enough of that!

170
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,625
Say what?

171
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,375
Just who do you think you are?

172
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,958
[ARTHUR]
I'm a king.

173
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,958
[ARTHUR] Another subject
bows to his leader.

174
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,375
You tryin' to make
a fool outta me?

175
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,041
[ARTHUR]
Consider the natural order.

176
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,791
People rely on kings,
and kings rely on gods.

177
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:47,000
Just as subjects might mutiny
against their monarch,

178
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:50,000
a king can rebel
against a god and win.

179
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,625
I will kill a god
and become king.

180
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,000
Eventually my subjects
will revolt.

181
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,291
And you will take up
arms against me.

182
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,750
[chuckles]

183
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,833
I hate people like you...

184
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,958
...who never know
when to shut up.

185
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,250
If that's what you want,

186
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,458
I'd be happy to
kill you right now.

187
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,125
I still have much work to do.

188
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:13,708
But I promise I won't let
anyone else kill me, only you.

189
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,375
No, I can't die yet.

190
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:24,583
Not before I've gotten the
chance to kill King Arthur.

191
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,583
[ARTHUR]
Tris!

192
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,208
[ARTHUR]
Where are the others?

193
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,458
[TRISTAN]
I'm not sure.

194
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:36,916
They're probably dead.

195
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,083
Please, Boss.

196
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,541
Make it to the Gate.

197
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,041
I promise.

198
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,208
[ARTHUR]
Tris!

199
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,083
Why do this?

200
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,666
All of your Knights...

201
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,625
How can you sacrifice so many
people's lives like this?

202
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,250
The terrible weight
of this decision

203
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,458
is mine to bear for
as long as I live.

204
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:01,666
However...

205
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,500
It was all necessary.

206
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,291
But Arthur...

207
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,250
You must really wish
to change the world

208
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,333
if you were willing
to go this far.

209
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,291
[ARTHUR]
Let's continue.

210
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,541
To bring glory to everyone

211
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,458
who entrusted their
lives to my hands.

212
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,666
I refuse to let
them die in vain!

213
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,125
[NARRATOR]
Hearing this,

214
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,750
they understood the king's
commitment to his mission.

215
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,500
They realized he would
push on no matter what,

216
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:36,166
even when pain threatened
to overwhelm him.

217
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,416
It looks like
we're finally ready

218
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,416
to test this Replica out.

219
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,875
[LOKI chuckles]

220
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,791
You're going to need a trump
card up your sleeve, Arthur.

221
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,041
What the hell is going on?

222
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,041
It's hard to move!

223
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,458
Almost there.

224
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,583
The Divine Gate
is just up ahead.

225
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,708
[NARRATOR]
The king presses forward,

226
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,083
fighting against the weight
pushing down on him.

227
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,458
One final test
for a human to face

228
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,625
before he's able to
touch the power of a god.

229
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,375
Kay. Gareth.

230
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,666
Percival. Ywain.

231
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:53,333
Lamorak. Mordred. Bedivere.

232
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,208
Palomides.

233
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,375
Gawain.

234
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,416
And Tristan.

235
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:16,875
[BREUNOR]
Hey...

236
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,375
Breunor, you look
pretty pathetic.

237
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,791
Didn't think you'd
let them hurt you.

238
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:34,125
[BREUNOR] Honestly, I don't
even feel the pain anymore.

239
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:39,166
Man, I can't believe yours is
the last face that I'll see.

240
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,166
You can rest now.

241
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,375
Good work.

242
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,666
Everyone did a fine job
of buying him time.

243
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,708
[LANCELOT]
All right, you bastards.

244
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,500
Who wants to go first?

245
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,375
[SURTR] As much as I'd like
to play around with you

246
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,458
a little more, our
covenant ends right here.

247
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,625
[LANCELOT]
Ha! Is that so?

248
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,416
Is it because our
leader actually managed

249
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,666
to reach the Divine Gate?

250
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,375
I guess that means we beat you.

251
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,250
Don't be a fool.

252
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,833
It's not the Gate
that we were protecting.

253
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,208
You really are just
a clueless animal.

254
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,666
Wait, what?!

255
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,208
[SIGURD laughing]

256
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,875
This is it...

257
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,791
At last, the Divine Gate!

258
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,250
What was that thing?

259
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,291
[ARTHUR]
Why is this Replica here?

260
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,208
[ARTHUR grunting]

261
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,791
[ARTHUR yelling]

262
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,041
\I'm the only one who
should walk the path

263
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,208
they opened.

264
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,125
[ARTHUR]
You shouldn't be here.

265
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,625
They died for me!

266
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:51,708
It's no good!

267
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,375
Don't stop trying yet!

268
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,666
[AKANE]
Dammit.

269
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,750
[LANCELOT]
Hey.

270
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,875
What the hell's this
ruckus about, kids?

271
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,916
[LOKI] Did you have fun
with the Replica Burst?

272
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,000
It was a special
present for you.

273
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,416
Loki.

274
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,166
I should have realized
you secretly had

275
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,291
the Geniuses of Divine
working on your side.

276
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,041
[LOKI]
You've truly surprised me.

277
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:37,541
I didn't think you'd pay such a
hefty price to destroy the Gate.

278
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,916
You were so close, too.

279
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,625
But you're finished now.

280
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,125
You don't even have the
strength left to wield a sword,

281
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,125
much less fight me.

282
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,375
I'm afraid that means I win.

283
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:54,000
For my final proposition,
I'll give you two options.

284
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,750
The first is obvious;
you can die right here.

285
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,291
Or, you can take this sword,

286
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,291
and I'll let you live.

287
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,083
As my personal slave-king.

288
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,041
So what'll it be, Arthur?

289
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:13,333
Sorry, but I refuse to be
manipulated by you anymore.

290
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,291
Oh, of course you'd say that.

291
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,875
You never have
been afraid of death.

292
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,750
Still, I hoped you'd see reason.

293
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,916
[LOKI] Well, I guess this
is where we say goodbye.

294
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,291
I'll have to replace you
with a different king.

295
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,375
What a pain.

296
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:32,541
[ARTHUR] I'm not going to let
you have the last laugh, Loki.

297
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:49,416
So Arthur's just on the
other side of the Gate, right?

298
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,250
Yeah. Hopefully.

299
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,458
Don't worry about him.
He's not the type to die easily.

300
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:07,666
Told ya.

301
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,458
Are you okay, Arthur?

302
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,458
[LANCELOT]
Good to see ya.

303
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,750
There. You've finally
become my king...

304
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,000
...Arthur.

305
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,375
I should have killed you...

306
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:51,250
Back in the street--

307
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,750
[MIDORI]
No! Lancelot!

308
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:55,750
[MIDORI]
What the--?

309
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,750
[AKANE]
It's closing!

310
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,708
This whole place...
It's falling apart!

311
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:11,458
[ALL yelling]

312
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:04,333
[SHAKESPEARE] Do you have
something entertaining

313
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,250
planned for me?

314
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:06,708
[LOKI]
Oh, I never disappoint.

315
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:09,625
You're going to love the
disaster I've put into motion.

316
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:12,125
[SANTA CLAUSE]
I know that it's a lot to ask,

317
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,625
but will you please help me?

318
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:16,625
[GINJI] I swear you idiots
have gone completely insane.
