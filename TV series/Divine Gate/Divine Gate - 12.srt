1
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:10,666
[SANTA CLAUSE]
What are you doing over here?

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,125
Isn't it Christmas Day
back in Terrastia?

3
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:15,625
Shouldn't you be
there celebrating?

4
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,916
[ARTHUR]
No, I'm all alone.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,708
Do you not have anywhere
that you can call home?

6
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:24,083
[ARTHUR] No.
Do you think I could find one?

7
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:28,166
Well, I don't know why
you're asking me that.

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,000
But don't cry.
How about I give you a present?

9
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,708
[NARRATOR] It was in that
snowy moment the boy realized

10
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:38,208
his true purpose in life.

11
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:43,416
He suddenly understood what it
meant to be called Santa Clause.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,416
Like I said...

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,541
It is Christmas Day after all.

14
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,291
I'm gonna give you a
brand new start at life, kid.

15
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,583
Let's clean you up.

16
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,583
[SANTA CLAUSE] I may have
said I was helping you

17
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:59,416
get on your feet
back then, Arthur.

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,666
But I was the one who was
actually given a new life

19
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,833
as I watched you find your path.

20
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:09,666
You truly love this world,
and that's what inspires me now.

21
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,291
I want to bring it happiness.

22
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:16,083
I'll get you back, Arthur.

23
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:17,916
I promise you!

24
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,166
Now, then...

25
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,833
What are you all waiting for?

26
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,250
Let's go beyond the Divine Gate.

27
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,000
[AKANE]
Come on.

28
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:07,791
This is why we
came here, isn't it?

29
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:12,041
Yeah, Elena sacrificed
everything to save me.

30
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,333
This way I can bring
her back, and your dad...

31
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:18,375
I know you want to see him
again, don't you, Akane?

32
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,250
I do.

33
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:24,083
Hey Aoto. Are you gonna wish to
start fresh with your brother?

34
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,833
Well whaddaya know, Arthur,

35
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:34,666
the children have
reached the Divine Gate.

36
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,458
I never doubted them.

37
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,000
How long do you
plan to stay cooped up

38
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,833
inside your own head like this?

39
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:43,166
It's so dull, honestly I don't
know how you can stand it.

40
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,041
You could always stop visiting.

41
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,791
[LOKI] Why don't you
come out and play?

42
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,875
After all, there's someone
here who wants to say hello.

43
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,041
[LOKI laughing]

44
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,041
That's an interesting new look.

45
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,583
Hey, what's the deal?

46
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,000
Don't tell me you've stopped
believing in Santa Clause.

47
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,708
This isn't the
Arthur you once knew,

48
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:32,000
but I can assure you this
one is quite an improvement.

49
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,250
[SANTA CLAUSE]
Imbecile!

50
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,291
You think you can control him?!

51
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,916
You remember. I told you
that if times got tough,

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,791
I'd always have your back.

53
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,000
[SANTA CLAUSE]
Whose seal is this?

54
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,375
[ARTHUR]
It's from the World Council.

55
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,125
A recommendation letter.

56
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,750
Interesting.

57
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,041
Funny how things work out...

58
00:04:57,125 --> 00:05:01,083
I had a feeling this
might show up one day.

59
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,041
Something about it
feels like fate.

60
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,583
Like this letter was
destined to be delivered.

61
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:09,541
I guess that means this is
the right thing for me, huh?

62
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,708
So that's it? This is the path
you're choosing for your life?

63
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:13,916
Yeah.

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,791
Then I bet you're
gonna do great things.

65
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,166
But know that
if things get rough,

66
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,250
I'll always be here for you.

67
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:28,041
That tired look tells me
you could use a helping hand.

68
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:31,708
I'm afraid you're mistaken.
That's just relief on his face.

69
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,875
Your friend Arthur actually
hated this world, Santa.

70
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,625
Did you not see that?

71
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,250
This heartless
world abandoned him.

72
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,583
And over time,
he grew to resent it.

73
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,708
The lost, frightened
child became a bitter ruler.

74
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,375
That part was none of my doing.

75
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,750
He may not realize it,
but this is what he truly wants.

76
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,833
So who are you to stand
against his wishes, huh?

77
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,041
You don't understand
how a heart works, Loki.

78
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,750
This isn't what he wants!

79
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,625
How can you say that to someone
who's stood inside his mind?

80
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:07,916
Ha!

81
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,791
You should know that
everyone has some darkness

82
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,166
in their hearts.

83
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,208
But they've got light, too.
That's what's important.

84
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,541
You took away Arthur's ability
to choose for himself,

85
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,833
but I'm here to give
him his freedom back.

86
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,250
Now stand aside!

87
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,416
[SANTA CLAUSE yells]

88
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,291
What's wrong?

89
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,125
I thought Santa was
supposed to be jolly.

90
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,666
You're kind of ruining
your reputation right now.

91
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,416
Oh, yeah? Well I thought
gods were supposed to inspire.

92
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,666
But all I want to do is
kick your teeth in right now.

93
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,416
[SAINT A (DANTE)] How dare they
rebel against the Council?

94
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,833
[SAINT B (AEGIS)]
This whole plot is becoming

95
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,500
quite troublesome.

96
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,166
[SAINT A (DANTE)]
We have no choice.

97
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,875
Send in the other
boy immediately.

98
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,666
[LOKI] You're right.
Gods should inspire humans

99
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,416
to become their best selves.

100
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,125
And that's exactly
what I've done.

101
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:03,541
I've improved him--
Made him perfect.

102
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:07,166
Forget about the light and dark
at war in the hearts of humans.

103
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,875
I gave Arthur a gift you never
could: peace everlasting.

104
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,041
Is this really what you want?

105

[SANTA CLAUSE grunts]

[SANTA CLAUSE groaning]

107
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,750
Here goes.
I'm finally close enough.

108
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:48,666
Santa, no!

109
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,625
There he is.
It's good to see ya.

110
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,666
Took you long enough to wake up.

111
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,083
Don't worry about me.

112
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,541
I'll be fine.

113
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:58,625
So this is it?

114
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,708
The world that
lives inside of you?

115
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,500
It looks really empty.

116
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,208
Here, I brought you
a little present.

117
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,625
Pretty smart.

118
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,666
You didn't want Loki to have
full control of your heart,

119
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,958
so you hid most of it
away in this thing.

120
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,500
There was no way
I'd let that fool have it.

121
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,416
You can stop hiding now.
Come back to us.

122
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,125
It's time to go home.

123

It's not that easy, my friend.

124
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,916
Yes, it is!

125
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I've made my decision, though.

126
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:37,541
I'm sorry. They were right.

This boy...

that the taboo blood would be

passed on to
someone like him.

[MALE VOICE B] He'll bring
chaos down upon us one day.

No doubt about it.

00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,333
[FEMALE VOICE B]
He's an enemy to our world.

The best way for me to protect
this world is to stay here.

without me, my friend.

Is this really the path
you've chosen to go down?

You're such a fool.

What a dramatic display, Arthur.

143

Now let's go watch the
remaking of the world together.

Don't worry.

145

You're not going to need
a heart anymore, Your Majesty.

146
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:38,541
After all, the only thing a
puppet really needs is strings.

[K] Whatever you decide to do
once you move through the Gate

is completely up to you,

149
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,583
Well, what's the matter?

150

You've come this far,
but you're still unsure.

151

Ugh... This is kind
of a big decision!

152
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm interested to see
what you choose!

153
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,375
Will you change the past
and hope that means the world

turns out for the better?

155
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,750
Or will you keep
the past as it is now

156
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,416
so you can ensure
a perfect future?

157
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,125
Whatever you decide
will reshape the world

After all that's happened,

160
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:25,000
you have earned the right
to choose your own destinies.

161
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,291
I'm going through.

162
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,125
I'll worry about the
consequences later.

163
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,666
Yeah, I'm going, too.

164
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,083
I'm not about to just
stand still and do nothing.

165
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,375
I agree.

166
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,750
[SURTR]
No! Stop!

167
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,041
You bastards!

168
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,541
It's your fault!

169
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,500
Stupid kids.

170
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:17,541
Hey, look at them.

171
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,041
They seem pretty beat up to me.

172
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,291
They don't even have
any Drivers with them.

173
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,625
Dammit, Oz. This isn't good.

174
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,750
[OZ] I managed to get
back all of the power

175
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,416
that I'd offered up to the gods.

176
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,958
Now the future's in those
children's hands.

177
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:40,458
How dare you lowly humans try
to choose the fate of the world!

178
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,250
The Divine Gate was
never meant to be used

179
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,916
by weak mortals like you.

180
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
[K] How predictable.
Gods say that every time.

181
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,166
[K laughing]

182
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,000
If I only had my Driver...

183
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,333
This kid wouldn't
stand a chance!

184
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,083
Why don't you
approve of humans?

185
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:01,625
Shouldn't they have a chance to
decide their own fates, too?

186
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,125
Not by doing this!

187
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,791
It's too much power for the
humans to handle themselves!

188
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,416
This is how order gets lost!

189
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,791
It'll bring chaos
into the world!

190
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,916
But gods are just as
capable of making mistakes.

191
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,333
It isn't fair.

192
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:17,000
Humans do have the ability
to choose their own fate,

193
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:20,375
but how can they when gods take
away their freedom of choice?

194
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,583
You're wrong!

195
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,500
All we want is for them
to live their lives,

196
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,583
and to keep the
world moving forward.

197
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:27,583
Listen.

198
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,791
Pay no attention to these gods.

199
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,250
You must choose your
own fate, here and now.

200
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,208
That power is yours.

201
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,125
It's time for you to leave.

202
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,500
Listen to me, humans!

203
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,000
This spirit is not your ally.
Remember that.

204
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,583
You're the ones who are
causing their troubles.

205
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,916
Why shouldn't they be put in
charge of their world's fate?

206
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:55,041
These humans have real
hopes, dreams, and regrets.

207
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:59,000
They have every right to shape
their own lives as they see fit.

208
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,333
Tell me, Aoto.

209
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,208
Why do you need the gods?

210
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:05,416
After all the pain you've been
through, why trust them?

211
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,166
You're right.

212
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,125
What do you think, Akane?

213
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,666
You finally found your father
after all that searching.

214
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,958
And as soon as you did,
the gods took him away again.

215
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,208
And you, Midori.

216
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:27,333
You kept running,
never straying from the path.

217
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:31,083
Always trying to get
your best friend back.

218
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,333
Elena...

219
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,458
Why did you gods do this?

220
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,500
I've had enough!

221
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,083
Let's take 'em down!

222
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,166
You'll pay for what you did!

223
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,625
[K]
That's right. You see?

224
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,833
You're stronger than the humans.

225
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,416
But they wish from the heart.

226
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,541
That's their power!

227
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,208
It's why I led them here!

228
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,958
Damn you, Key Spirit!

229
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:10,708
I can't believe you'd...
let them do this!

230
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,500
This is why I hate humans.

231
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,291
They're just... so selfish.

232
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,916
There's no one
in your way now!

233
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,291
[chuckles]

234
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,083
[K] Here...
Let's go beyond the Gate!

235
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,375
[GINJI]
Hold on.

236
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,916
[MIDORI]
Ginji...

237
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,625
[AKANE]
What are you doing here?

238
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,166
This isn't right, guys.

239
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,791
The Gate shouldn't be
used for personal gain!

240
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,666
Okay then, what else
would you use it for?

241
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,333
The Council should be
in control of the Gate.

242
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,875
Think about it; they can use it
to help rule over everyone

243
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,333
and keep the whole world safe.

244
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,833
Do you have any idea what'll
happen to the rest of us

245
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,041
if you go through
that thing right now?

246
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,875
The Council will just disappear.

247
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,083
The world would fall
into even more chaos!

248
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,208
You don't get it. We weren't
gonna wish for big stuff.

249
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,375
[GINJI]
That doesn't matter!

250
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,833
If in your heart you don't think
the world needs the Council,

251
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,833
then it'll cease to exist.

252
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:24,333
I know this has been hard
on you, 'cause life isn't fair.

253
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,916
No matter how good
you try to be,

254
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,125
things can go off the rails
because of other people.

255
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,500
No matter how hard you
work toward your goals,

256
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,916
you may fail.

257
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,541
At the end of the day,
only a few chosen ones

258
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,791
have any real power
over this world.

259
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,333
But think about it.

260
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,708
That's exactly why we need them!

261
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,708
This world is
brimming with chaos.

262
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,666
So we need someone like
the Council in charge

263
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,000
to make it possible
for us to survive.

264
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,708
But they can change all
of that with the Gate.

265
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:59,291
It's true that the final result
isn't just a granted wish.

266
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,458
It's a reality reboot that
completely remakes the world!

267
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:04,916
Imagine it.

268
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,458
You guys can become god-like
and do whatever you want.

269
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,875
You could even destroy
the world if you wanted to.

270
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,041
Hold on...

271
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,708
Does that mean if I
get my wish granted

272
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,291
that Aoto or Akane won't be
able to have their own dreams

273
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,791
come true as well?

274
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,416
[K]
No, of course not.

275
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,875
Everything will be
morphed to fit your desires.

276
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,750
You can do anything
you dream of.

277
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:27,083
No one else's wishes
will matter anymore.

278
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:30,000
I hadn't realized there
was so much at stake.

279
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,083
[AOTO]
It makes sense.

280
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:38,291
Most wishes in life
don't come true.

281
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,666
I know that.

282
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,625
It's why I spent most
my life trying not to care.

283
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,875
But then,
Arthur changed my mind.

284
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,666
He said that caring for other
people is what makes us human.

285
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,416
That nurturing friends
or ideals or causes

286
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,500
is what makes us better.

287
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:58,250
I have changed since
meeting my comrades.

288
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,750
I'm stronger.

289
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,166
So you know what
I think about the Gate?

290
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,666
Caring for this world
is what's important.

291
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,250
Way more so than getting
my "perfect" reality.

292
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:14,583
Uh... Wait, what are
you saying? Aoto?

293
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,875
We can't rely on god-like
powers to save people.

294
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:21,583
The only way to change humanity
is for us to go change it.

295
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,791
You know...

296
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,041
I don't wanna be a stupid god.

297
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,833
I'd probably just forget
what I was livin' for.

298
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,916
We don't have to run
away from this world.

299
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,958
We could try
to fix it ourselves.

300
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:41,083
This isn't over; you guys
rebelled against the Council

301
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,958
by coming here.

302
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,500
They're not just gonna
let that slide, y'know.

303
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,541
Watch your backs.

304
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,541
Okay. I decided.

305
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:59,500
I'm not gonna risk ruining
this world for a selfish wish.

306
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,000
Yeah, I'm with you.

307
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:04,250
I don't think we should hit
reset on everything either.

308
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,750
It's settled.

309
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,416
I guess we're stuck
with the world we have.

310
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,625
Hmm... That's an
interesting choice.

311
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,125
I was wondering
what you would do.

312
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,416
But it can't be helped.

313
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,666
After all, you guys are
the ones who should get

314
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,666
to choose your own fates.

315
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,083
Key Spirit.

316
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,083
You've been by
my side for so long,

317
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:32,458
and you've given me
so much to think about.

318
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,541
Thank you for everything.

319
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,208
[chuckling]

320
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,208
You know, that's the
first time anyone has ever

321
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,791
thanked me before!

322
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:46,375
[K chuckling]

323
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,000
[LOKI] Well, that was
an intriguing show!

324
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:01,958
I offer my greatest tribute
as a token of my appreciation!

325
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,458
Loki! Stop this!

326
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:11,791
No way...

327
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,416
What in the hell did
you do to Arthur now?!

328
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,333
And why did you do
all of this? You're a god!

329
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,625
[LOKI chuckling]

330
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,208
Look at those faces.
This is my favorite part--

331
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:23,291
Watching you tiny humans
struggle, confused,

332
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,541
running around like frightened
ants beneath my shoe.

333
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,666
But why Arthur?!

334
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,166
It's simple. He's different.

335
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,083
You see...
Arthur is the chosen one.

336
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:39,083
[ARTHUR yelling]

337
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:42,708
[AOTO]
Watch out!

338
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,000
[ARTHUR]
Loki...

339
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,208
[LOKI]
Yes? What is it, Arthur?

340
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,291
You know that no
matter what you do,

341
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:05,833
you'll never be able to fully
erase hope from this world.

342
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,375
Is that what you think?

343
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,708
You must not get it.

344
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,958
All hope eventually
gives way to despair.

345
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,541
That's just the
way of the world.

346
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,000
No, you're wrong.

347
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:18,500
Despair's a path; it must be
chosen like anything else.

348
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,166
[ANNOUNCER 1A]
This is an emergency broadcast

349
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,125
from the World Council
Headquarters.

350
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:27,125
The tower collapsed inside
the zone earlier today.

351
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,125
The path to the
Divine Gate seems to have

352
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,083
disappeared completely.

353
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,583
Hey, you guys all right?

354
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:37,708
Yeah.

355
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,500
The three of us are okay.

356
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,125
[METABON]
Me, too, bon!

357
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,958
Hey, where ya been, stupid pet?

358
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,375
[METABON laughing]

359
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,333
[LANCELOT] Looks like you
guys made quite the mess.

360
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,541
Hey, guys.

361
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:56,125
Lancelot, you're alive?!
Amazing!

362
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,500
Yeah, fortunately I can't
die until I get my chance

363
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,208
to kill Arthur.

364
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,875
And besides, you didn't
really think any of

365
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,916
the Knights of Round were
actually dead, did you?

366
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,583
Turns out all of us were
saved by the greater power.

367
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,166
Is that what you're
here to tell us?

368
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,333
Yeah.

369
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,583
The path is gone for now,

370
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,875
but we're going to find
a way to get him back.

371
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,708
[NARRATOR] The rain begins
to fall, slowly at first.

372
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,375
Low points in the street
fill up, creating puddles.

373
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,083
But not everything holds water.

374
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,666
A broken heart, for instance,
can't be filled.

375
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,416
But now the children
believe without a doubt

376
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,750
that a heart can be mended
and made stronger than before.

377
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:35,000
And they know that eventually
the sun will shine again.
