1
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:23,000
[NARRATOR] The boy had
always been alone.

2
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,625
He was born and
abandoned in Terrastia,

3
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:28,333
no one bothering to raise him.

4
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,833
He felt he existed
for no reason,

5
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:34,083
all by himself in a big,
uncertain world.

6
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:38,166
Sadness filled the air around
him, saturating his daily life.

7
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,958
Where does that door go?

8
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:47,250
It can't be any worse
than on this side.

9
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,333
[NARRATOR]
The boy had no reason to stay.

10
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:01,291
He found himself in a
place of light and beauty.

11
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,708
A world called Celestia.

12
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:07,750
But this new land did
nothing to lift his spirits.

13
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:10,083
It was as though every
splendor before his eyes

14
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:12,291
was nothing but an illusion.

15
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:15,666
Even the colors dancing through
the bright sky seemed unreal.

16
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,666
[NARRATOR]
Until one day...

17
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,833
He found another boy.

18
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:26,125
One who was smiling.

19
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:27,916
Excuse me...

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,625
But where is this place?

21
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:33,750
This is Celestia.

22
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:35,916
We're near the Holy Night Town.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,875
Celestia?

24
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:39,000
Wait, hold on a second.

25
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,583
You're a human, aren't you?

26
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:43,791
What are you doing over here?

27
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:46,208
Isn't it Christmas Day
back in Terrastia?

28
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:49,125
Shouldn't you be
there celebrating?

29
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:51,083
No, I'm all alone.

30
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:52,625
[BOY]
Are you an orphan or something?

31
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:59,000
Do you not have anywhere
that you can call home?

32
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:00,708
[ARTHUR] No. Do you
think I could find one?

33
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:01,791
[BOY]
Uh...

34
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,416
Well, I don't know why
you're asking me that.

35
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't cry. How about
I give you a present?

36
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:15,916
Like I said...

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,875
It is Christmas Day, after all.

38
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:19,583
Who are you?

39
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:20,875
Uh... Well, I'm, uh...

40
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,958
Yeah, I guess that
I can tell you.

41
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,166
You see, I'm Santa Clause.

42
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,458
You're Santa Clause?

43
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:27,750
Yup, that's me.

44
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,416
It may be for
just one day a year,

45
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,416
but it's my job to make the
whole world a happy place.

46
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,000
Are you being serious?

47
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,458
If you don't believe me,
how 'bout some proof?

48
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,125
C'mon, follow me.

49
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,041
[ARTHUR]
Where to?

50
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,458
Well, to my place, naturally.

51
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,375
To show you the truth.

52
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,500
Just you wait.

53
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,625
I've got a great
present for you.

54
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,333
I'm gonna give you a
brand new start at life, kid.

55
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,333
Let's get you cleaned up a bit.

56
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,416
[ARTHUR]
Thank you.

57
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,541
[ELISABETH]
Finally! There you are!

58
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,625
I've been looking everywhere!

59
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:03,791
Who is this?

60
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:04,916
Hey, Lisa!

61
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:10,375
I just met this guy, but he's
gonna be my best friend forever!

62
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,625
Oh, really?

63
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,166
That's wonderful.

64
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,375
[ARTHUR] When the Divine
Gate opened before,

65
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,916
it merged together the
three worlds of Celestia,

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,250
Terrastia, and Hellistia.

67
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,958
And the result was utter chaos.

68
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,583
We have selfishness
to blame for this.

69
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,000
Cowardice.

70
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,958
People only cared about
themselves and their own worlds.

71
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:08,625
[SAINT A] But what can you do to
rectify this situation, Arthur?

72
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,041
I'll do whatever I have to.

73
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,916
Anything to prevent
another incident

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,541
like the Blue Christmas
tragedy from happening again.

75
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:20,166
[SAINT C] And what if you're
unable to succeed in that?

76
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,458
[SAINT B] Isn't this
why the Academy was created?

77
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,666
[ARTHUR] I've gathered
Adapters with great potential

78
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,333
here to help me.

79
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:31,416
Together we will reach the
Divine Gate on this expedition.

80
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,083
[SAINT B chuckles]

81
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,916
[SAINT C] You're certainly
obsessed with finding

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,666
the holy relic, aren't you?

83
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,958
[SAINT A] Whatever our
thoughts are on the matter,

84
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,708
we won't rob you of
the chance to imagine

85
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,708
that your goal is achievable.

86
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,583
You deserve the right to dream.

87
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,000
[LOKI] Arthur's finally going
to make his big move.

88
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,583
I'm shivering with anticipation.

89
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,500
[OZ] I don't understand
what the hell is going on

90
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,750
in Arthur's head!

91
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,416
Or for that matter, in yours.

92
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,708
You want to know what's
going on in my mind?

93
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,666
Let's just say that it's
something very entertaining.

94
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,833
[chuckles]

95
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,625
And I can't wait to
see it all play out.

96
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:14,125
[ARTHUR]
You can laugh if you want to.

97
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,291
But it's true.

98
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,375
I'm in love with Terrastia.

99
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,666
How touching.

100
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,416
You've got a bright
future as a poet.

101
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,458
Oh, keep talking, Arthur,
I'm falling for you.

102
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:31,041
You're both just
jealous of how smart he is.

103
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,250
So?

104
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,916
Go on, why have you
summoned us here now?

105
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,791
The time has come, my friends.

106
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,583
Let's find the Gate.

107
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,000
All right! Let's get a move on.

108
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,416
It seems I have more important
things to worry about

109
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,333
than what soup to make tonight.

110
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,125
Are you serious?

111
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,208
Of course he is.

112
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,500
I can tell by that
mischievous smirk.

113
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:56,791
There's no stopping the boss

114
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,333
when he gets that
look on his face.

115
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,666
Well, serious or not,

116
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,958
you know you can count
on us to follow your lead.

117
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,083
Let's stop yappin'
and get going!

118
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah, what's our first step?

119
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,250
I'll be by your side
throughout this journey.

120
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,083
I won't back down.

121
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,375
Let me ask you
one thing, Arthur.

122
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,208
What's your plan if we
do find the Divine Gate?

123
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,291
It's simple.

124
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm going to put the world
back the way it should be.

125
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,416
And what way is that?

126
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,250
[ARTHUR] Those who walk
through the Divine Gate

127
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,375
receive great power--

128
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,083
Enough to remake
the entire world--

129
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,125
To restore it to the
way it once was.

130
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,541
Now I see.

131
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,833
That's why you want to
obtain the Gate's power.

132
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:45,666
Yes.

133
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,041
I'll do whatever it takes.

134
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:52,208
And I refuse to stop until I
have completed this mission.

135
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,625
That's why I've
surrounded myself

136
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,916
with people who I can trust.

137
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,166
Those who will follow me
on this difficult journey.

138
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,375
Now then...

139
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:05,625
Allow me to lead you
as your king.

140
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:08,416
This isn't going to be
an easy expedition.

141
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,500
I'm asking that each of you
trust me with your lives.

142
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,708
[ALL]
Yes, Your Highness!

143
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,791
[MIDORI]
First place!

144
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,833
[laughs]

145
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,875
[BREUNOR]
You two always lose to her.

146
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,333
[AKANE]
Oh hey, what's up, Breunor?

147
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,625
That's Sir Breunor.

148
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:31,833
Anyway...

149
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,916
Arthur wants to talk
to you guys right now.

150
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,791
[MIDORI]
Huh? How come?

151
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,083
You can go ask him yourself.

152
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,166
Although...

153
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,000
It probably has to do
with us claiming the Gate.

154
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,875
Once there, Arthur's
gonna use his wish

155
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,958
to make this messed-up world
a better place for everyone.

156
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,250
Is this a joke?

157
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:52,875
Huh?

158
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:53,750
No, it's not.

159
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,333
So what does he want with us?

160
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,583
Look, I'm just the messenger.

161
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:57,958
Ask Arthur yourself!

162
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,916
There. That's all I had to say.

163
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,958
I wonder if he wants us to
go with him on this journey.

164
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,416
I sure hope so.

165
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,458
That's crazy.

166
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:09,166
Hey, what do you think, Aoto?

167
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,250
I bet... that whether
we go or not is up to us.

168
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,875
It's why we're here.

169
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,333
The reason behind
all of this training.

170
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:22,833
That makes sense.

171
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,333
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

172
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,791
Let's see what he wants.

173
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:26,625
Sounds good.

174
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:27,791
How 'bout I race you there?

175
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:28,958
Let's go!

176
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,458
[K] Have you decided
what your wish is?

177
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,208
Aoto...

178
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:38,000
Do you really think that finding
the Gate will make it come true?

179
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,083
I'm not sure I believe that.

180
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:43,083
But going after it must
be better than doing nothing.

181
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,208
You really have changed.

182
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,291
You're moving on.

183
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,500
But aren't you afraid that
pain might be waiting

184
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,500
for you again if you
find the Divine Gate?

185
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,083
I'm used to pain.

186
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,708
That's fine.

187
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,083
Do you want to change the past?

188
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,125
Or the future now?

189
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,416
I find empty fish tanks
to be comforting.

190
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,958
That's cool, but why?

191
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,750
[ARTHUR]
They're so full of potential.

192
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,875
I could put anything in there.

193
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,291
Huh... There are
a lot of possibilities.

194
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,333
What a cool thought!

195
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,666
That's so smart, Arthur.

196
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,083
Ehh...

197
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,833
I dunno, I think I'd rather see
a bunch of awesome fish

198
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,833
swimming around,
if I'm being honest here.

199
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,083
Is that so?

200
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,333
What about you?

201
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:46,166
The tank reminds me of my home.

202
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,166
Oh, I see.

203
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,541
Your home?

204
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,041
What do you mean?

205
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,125
Let's move on to
why I've brought

206
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,208
the three of you here today.

207
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:59,125
This world we live in
is so full of discontent.

208
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,916
Akane. Midori. Aoto.

209
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,875
I'm heading for the Divine Gate.

210
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,916
And I'd like you to join me.

211
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,750
You mean you're
seriously offering us

212
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,333
the chance to find it with you?

213
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,458
Yes, I am.

214
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,916
Of course.

215
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,166
Naturally, my Knights of
Round will be coming along.

216
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,625
In addition to you three,

217
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,916
I've asked Ginji, Hikari,
and Yukari from the Academy

218
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,375
to join as well.

219
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,500
[AKANE] But we have no
way of knowing for sure

220
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,166
that we'll find it, right?

221
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,583
[ARTHUR] You'll never get
anywhere if you think like that.

222
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,375
Have faith.

223
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,041
I need people who
believe in the Gate.

224
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,458
Only they will be able
to pass through it.

225
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,708
But what if you're not
even sure you want to find it?

226
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,625
What if you're not certain you
want your wish to be granted?

227
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,541
[ARTHUR] Just as rain
gives way to sunshine,

228
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,500
your doubts will clear.

229
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,958
I only have one wish in life.

230
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,958
And that's to claim the
Divine Gate no matter the cost.

231
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,083
This entire plan is outrageous!

232
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,625
What's the matter?

233
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,583
I actually think he's
being quite smart,

234
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:06,500
because the more help he has,
the better his chances are.

235
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,291
Yeah, but what's his endgame?

236
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,125
What will the world look
like if Arthur remakes it?

237
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:14,333
It would be interesting
to see him reshape things.

238
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,583
But you're overlooking
the fact that I don't think

239
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,375
Arthur's telling the truth.

240
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,500
It's a pity.

241
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,791
What is?

242
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,166
Just come out with it.

243
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,583
[LOKI]
Hmm...

244
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,166
I'm just saying that if
we can't trust Arthur's plan,

245
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,416
then I think we should use our
powers to do whatever we like.

246
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,666
Don't you agree?

247
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,541
Well yeah, of course we should.

248
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,333
But I didn't need you
to tell me that, Loki.

249
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,416
Excuse me.

250
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,375
[LOKI chuckling]

251
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:43,375
Ah. I'm so excited, Arthur.

252
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:47,291
I've been captivated by you
since the very first day we met.

253
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:53,541
[LOKI]
What are doing, child?

254
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,916
Who are you?

255
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,666
Oh, me? A god.

256
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,125
What? Are you for real?

257
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,208
Is it true that gods have the
power to do whatever they want?

258
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,500
Why, yes.

259
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,791
I suppose I can do anything.

260
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,666
That must be nice.

261
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,833
[LOKI]
Would you like to be a god?

262
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,625
Mm-mm.

263
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,250
I don't think so.

264
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,000
I think I'd rather be
the king of this world.

265
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,250
A fearless leader.

266
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,583
[LOKI]
Why's that?

267
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,291
The reason we have wars
is because of bad leaders,

268
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,791
but I wouldn't let that happen.

269
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,708
I'd protect this world
and its people.

270
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,291
That's why I want
to become king,

271
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:40,541
so peace can finally be
restored throughout the land.

272
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,125
And then my best
friend could make sure

273
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,875
everyone was happy forever!

274
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,166
Then it would be my pleasure

275
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,083
to help you achieve
this great dream of peace.

276
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,833
[LOKI] Just like a king is there
to lead and help his people,

277
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,833
a god must be there
to guide a king

278
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,666
and help him on his path.

279
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,166
Thank you!

280
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,250
[LOKI]
Now... Why don't we begin?

281
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,083
Well, everyone.

282
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,208
The day is finally here!

283
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,375
[LOKI] It's time for
the Twilight Judgment!

284
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,916
[OZ]
Hear me, Scandinavian gods.

285
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,375
We offer ourselves up to you.

286
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,416
Turn us dragons into blades!

287
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,416
[OZ] In times when
the weak are oppressed,

288
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,375
use the power of these
weapons to protect them!

289
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,541
[AKANE]
So... what should we do?

290
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,416
Are you seriously
asking whether or not

291
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
we should go after
the Divine Gate?

292
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:55,333
Yeah.

293
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,000
Well, I'm going for sure.

294
00:14:57,083 --> 00:15:00,291
But what you two do
is up to you guys.

295
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,666
Those things
he was talking about...

296
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,541
I will remake the
world and return it

297
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,500
to the way it should be.

298
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,250
And then become its king.

299
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,666
I guess that must be the reason

300
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,041
you want to find the
Divine Gate so badly.

301
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,083
Wait, a king?

302
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,500
Like, with a crown?

303
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:15,708
That's right.

304
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,000
And I'll be a grand leader.

305
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,958
My subjects will all prosper.

306
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,958
My good friend will ensure
happiness to everyone.

307
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,916
Who is this friend?
'Cause that's nuts.

308
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,708
He's the kind soul you
know as Santa Clause.

309
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,041
One night a year,
he brings joy and presents

310
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,958
to people all
throughout the world.

311
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,250
Oh yeah, I know
all about Santa Clause!

312
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,000
Whoa, is he really
a friend of yours?

313
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,291
Aw man, come on.

314
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,750
Don't tell me that
you think there's a real

315
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,333
Santa Clause, too!

316
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:44,666
It may be hard to believe,
but I assure you that he exists.

317
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,416
He is just as real
as the Divine Gate.

318
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,291
That's why I'm
going to reach it.

319
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:55,541
[AOTO] If we go, will our
wishes really come true?

320
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:56,708
[AKANE]
I don't know.

321
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,250
What happens if I get
to the Divine Gate

322
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,083
before anyone else does?

323
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,291
Then it'll just
grant my wish, right?

324
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,916
Yeah. You think
there's, like, a limit

325
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,583
to the number of
wishes it grants?

326
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,375
[SYLPH]
That's not how things work.

327
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,750
According to legend,
the Divine Gate

328
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,833
will indiscriminately grant
the wishes of everyone

329
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,208
who reaches it.

330
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,291
That's one of the reasons it
has caused so much chaos

331
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,375
throughout the world.

332
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,958
Yeah, Efreet is right.

333
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,916
Not all people have
honorable wishes, bon.

334
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:22,791
Well, if that's the case,

335
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,000
then we definitely have to
try to find the Gate, right?

336
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,583
Yeah, of course you do!

337
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,708
I'm guessing that you
won't wanna miss out.

338
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:29,583
Yeah.

339
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,000
I've got questions,

340
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,416
and the Gate's my best chance
of getting real answers.

341
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,916
What about you, Aoto?

342
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,833
[AOTO]
I don't think I could say no.

343
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,125
Alrighty!

344
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,041
Then let's go see Arthur.

345
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,916
[NARRATOR]
The rain begins to fall...

346
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,625
...slowly at first.

347
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,000
The dark clouds roll in,

348
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:58,625
as if to cover up each
individual's secret wishes.

349
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:02,250
But the world
is full of desires.

350
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:05,541
Wishes also known as lust.

351
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,458
[ARTHUR] Welcome to the
Divine Gate expedition.

352
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,833
Before we begin,
some introductions.

353
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,958
It's so nice to
finally meet you all.

354
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,250
My name is Oz.

355
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,625
I come from the realm
known as Dragtia,

356
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,333
and I'm at your service.

357
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,750
The name's Loki.

358
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,541
I'm from Ragnatia.

359
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:31,041
How exciting!
I'm looking forward to this!

360
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,083
I can't wait to see
what you'll accomplish!

361
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,458
If you're really from Ragnatia,

362
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,916
then that means
you must be a god!

363
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,500
To be honest, I wouldn't've
expected you to be so friendly.

364
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,416
You should never
presume to know how a god

365
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,041
is going to behave, dear.

366
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,583
You may be from Dragtia,

367
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,291
but you don't
look like a dragon.

368
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:51,041
Then again, I don't know very
much about that place at all.

369
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,875
Just as I don't know
everything there is

370
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,541
to learn about humans.

371
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,291
We can teach each other.

372
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,625
Both these dudes
seem really suspicious.

373
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:00,708
Yeah.

374
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,250
I understand what you're
trying to get at, okay?

375
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,875
[LOKI]
Thank you, Ginji, my boy.

376
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,458
[NARRATOR] Sometimes the
rain can't be anticipated.

377
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:22,458
Just as hope can come
without a warning.

378
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:25,916
However, the rain will
inevitably fall once again,

379
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,125
and hearts will
eventually cloud over.

380
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,791
Everyone knows this,

381
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,958
and yet they still
cling to hope.

382
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,208
As if they've never
been hurt before.

383
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,750
[MIDORI]
I'm gonna find you.

384
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,041
[METABON]
Why so quiet, bon?

385
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,083
What, you got
a problem with it?

386
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,500
If there's something
bothering you,

387
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,541
then get mad and
yell about it, bon!

388
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,625
Isn't that more your style, bon?

389
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,000
Would you shut up?

390
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,208
I'm just annoyed because
there's so much going on,

391
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:05,458
and I can't wrap my
head around any of it.

392
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:08,416
But I absolutely will
find out about my dad.

393
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,250
That's one thing
I can be sure of.

394
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,333
[K] I thought you
liked the shadows.

395
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,958
You've always enjoyed
quietly hiding in them,

396
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,291
holding your breath,

397
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,750
because you want to be
as invisible as possible.

398
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:20,750
But not now.

399
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,083
You're stepping
out of the shadows

400
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,208
and taking some
action for once.

401
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,541
Yeah.

402
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,666
I'm not going to just sit
back and watch anymore.

403
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,708
Because that never
works out well.

404
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:33,166
I always end up hating
myself even more.

405
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,500
[UNDINE]
Oh, hey, there you are, Aoto!

406
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,208
[UNDINE laughing]

407
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,875
Hey, did you need
something, Undine?

408
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,083
Oh wow!

409
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,375
That's the first time
you said my name!

410
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,500
Uh, yeah, I guess it is.

411
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:46,791
[UNDINE] That means
you're finally starting

412
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,208
to open up to me.

413
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,458
I knew it would happen
eventually, but I'm so excited!

414
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,916
Do you really think
that we're getting closer?

415
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,083
Just because of that?

416
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,416
[UNDINE]
Yeah, I sure do!

417
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,791
Feels like it.

418
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,125
I'm so happy!

419
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:03,000
I feel like I can do anything
to help you out now, Aoto!

420
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:03,875
[laughing]

421
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,083
So what's up?

422
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,125
[UNDINE]
Ah! Right.

423
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,500
Arthur was looking for you.

424
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,916
He said he wants to see you
alone for some reason.

425
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,958
I'm afraid that I lied to you.

426
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,625
[ARTHUR] I said that
I liked empty fish tanks.

427
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,250
[AOTO]
Okay, so you don't like them?

428
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,083
I know how scary it is
to lose something.

429
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:35,250
We're alike in
that way, aren't we?

430
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,916
That's why I'm always prepared
to lose things that I value now.

431
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,416
[ARTHUR] I want to turn the
world back to how it was

432
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,083
when Santa Clause was able
to give everyone happiness.

433
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,208
He gave me a new start
when I lost everything,

434
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,625
so I want to repay him somehow.

435
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,875
The only way I can.

436
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,541
[AOTO] It sounded like
your wish was for yourself,

437
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,583
but in fact it's selfless...

438
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,250
For someone else entirely.

439
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:03,708
[ARTHUR] You understand
because you're the same way.

440
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,958
You're always
sacrificing yourself

441
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,416
to keep something
important safe.

442
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,708
You've been protecting
your little brother, Aoto.

443
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,375
You've been his scapegoat.

444
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:16,416
[AOTO gasps]

445
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:21,375
[ARTHUR] Caring for other
people or ideals or worlds--

446
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:25,125
Anything other yourself
makes a person stronger.

447
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:28,250
That's the blessing and
the curse of being human.

448
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:02,708
[OZ]
Arthur.

449
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:05,166
You have no one but yourself
to blame for this mess.

450
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,416
[AKANE]
What's going on, Arthur?

451
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,250
Are the knights seriously
gonna fight gods?

452
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,458
[GAWAIN]
I'm so sorry.

453
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:13,375
I broke the treasure
you gave me.

454
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,208
Forgive me, Daddy.
