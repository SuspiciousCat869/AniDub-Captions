00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,750
[RADIO A] And in crime news,
a nightclub owned by

2
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:46,125
one of Ergastulum's most
powerful families,

3
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:47,291
the Cristianos,

4
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,291
was the scene last night
of a brutal attack

5
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,333
that left dozens of its Twilight
clientele dead or wounded.

6
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:54,625
Police have locked down the
club and its immediate area,

7
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:57,041
as they are said to be
pursuing multiple leads.

8
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,833
[ALEX] Barry's got
a job lined up for me

9
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:01,000
and a place to stay
till I get settled.

10
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,416
So don't worry.

11
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,916
I'll see you again real soon.
You understand, right?

12
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,333
Oh c'mon, Emilio, don't cry.

13
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,000
[RADIO A]
Experts say it's highly unlikely

14
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,291
any Twilights would
violate the Three Laws

15
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,875
to carry out such an attack.

16
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,000
For now, speculation on
the attackers' identities

17
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,125
is focused on a heretofore
unknown group

18
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:20,500
of Twilight hunters.

19
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,333
But sources tell us
no credible proof

20
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,166
for such a group has been found.

21
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,041
Police are hesitant to
pursue rumors and hearsay.

22
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,875
[ALEX]
Jeez. Gal's huge.

23
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,166
[MARCO]
Like a grizzly bear.

24
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,583
[NINA]
No, Nico's just tiny.

25
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,541
[NICOLAS screams]

26
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,458
[MARCO]
Harsh.

27
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,041
[GALAHAD]
Scary.

28
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:06,291
S'whatcha get for being
the most injured, dumbass.

29
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,083
Just a couple of
inches to the right

30
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,208
and that knife takes your lung.

31
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:13,375
After all this time, you have
no grasp of your limits.

32
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,166
This, folks, is what happens

33
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,458
when you spend years
developing your muscles

34
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,208
rather than your brains.

35
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,291
Stupid ape.

36
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,000
Hey uh, Nina?

37
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:26,541
So I've been meanin'
to ask you about this.

38
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:29,083
Does Doc Theo have
somethin' on Nicolas?

39
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,416
How does he get away with
talkin' to him like that?

40
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,416
Or is he like, secretly a super
strong Twilight or somethin'?

41
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,625
God no!

42
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,125
Doc knows he's got leverage

43
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,458
because he's one of the few
allies Twilights have here.

44
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:44,416
He's the only physician
who'll go near 'em.

45
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,208
In fact, I don't know
if you realize this,

46
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:49,208
but he makes all the Celebrer
uppers and downers himself.

47
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,833
He's got guys on
the black market

48
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,833
who supply him with
the raw ingredients,

49
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:56,541
then he compounds the batches
right here in the office.

50
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,291
No, I didn't.

51
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,416
[NINA] A brand name 'scrip
is super expensive.

52
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,958
Without Doc Theo, there's no way
poor, mostly orphaned Twilights

53
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,000
could get their hands on it.

54
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,875
[NINA] Sooner or later,
every Twilight in town

55
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,708
will end up at this
clinic looking for help.

56
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,791
[NINA] And Nico's probably come
here more times than anyone.

57
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,291
He feels so indebted to the Doc,

58
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,958
he lets him say
whatever he wants.

59
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:27,625
"Long as he doesn't tell me
'no,'" as Nico puts it.

60
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,541
I really had no idea.

61
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:34,000
[NINA] If it weren't for
the doctor, we'd be...

62
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,833
Well, you know...

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,583
[WORICK] Amanda, Karina,
Deborah, Ellen, and Sylvia.

64
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,458
They were all call
girls at Bastard.

65
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:01,791
Number Eight's Alejandro,
he was married to number 16.

66
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:06,583
Number 31 was a regular at the
tobacconist in District Seven.

67
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:10,541
Aw, shit. Number 39.

68
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,625
All I remember hearin' is how
she was from the orphanage.

69
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,625
And now Loretta Cristiano's
takin' care of her baby.

70
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,250
You know you can't
smoke in here.

71
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:29,875
Hey, Chad. Can I
ask you something?

72
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,083
[CHAD]
Hm?

73
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:35,458
What's this thing he
does with his memory?

74
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:39,083
Theo calls it "Hyperthymesia."

75
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,750
Worick remembers everything
his senses experience.

76
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:45,833
S'how the doc
explained it to me.

77
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:49,333
Bastard's had that gift for
as long as I've known him.

78
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,500
So that's the reason the
Handymen aren't with a family,

79
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:54,916
am I right?

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,708
You got it, kid.

81
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,625
If he ever decided
to switch sides,

82
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,708
he'd do some serious damage.

83
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,791
Worse than Nic, even.

84
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,333
Nobody's gonna risk keepin'
a powder-keg like that

85
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,375
in their employ.

86
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,750
No matter how smart he is.

87
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:15,125
[CHAD]
Well, nobody but Danny, that is.

88
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,750
Wonderful.

89
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:27,208
We're overrun with problem
patients and visitors today.

90
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,458
Connie, what's wrong?

91
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:31,208
Did something happen
at your shop--? Connie?

92
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,666
[MARCO] Ow! Ow!
Connie, that... that hurts!

93
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,833
Please. Take it easy. Constance.

94
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,416
C'mon, I'm still
recoverin' from last night.

95
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,250
Ah! Seriously, ow!

96
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,625
[CONSTANCE crying]

97
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:55,166
[CONSTANCE] Give me back...
the ring I gave you.

98
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,416
[MARCO]
Huh?

99
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:03,083
[CONSTANCE] Come on,
give it back, you big dummy.

100
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,583
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,708
I haven't seen you in so long

102
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,208
and here I've gone
and made you cry.

103
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,916
[THEO] So... I guess she's
still holding him hostage

104
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,458
with that ring of hers?

105
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,875
[GALAHAD] Eh, I wouldn't call
it a hostage situation, Doc.

106
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,083
Maybe like a curse.

107
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,250
[THEO]
A curse?

108
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,125
S'like the ring itself is magic.

109
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,958
Like it has control over Marco.

110
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,916
No matter how close
he comes to death,

111
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,291
the precious thing
won't let 'im.

112
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:52,375
Not before he can return
to his Constance.

113
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,000
That's some mojo.

114
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:01,083
But hell, you don't need
me to tell you that.

115
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:04,666
[THEO] Say no more.
Sounds pretty serious.

116
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:12,250
[ALEX] There's just so much
I know nothing about.

117
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,833
Like Connie and
Marco being a thing.

118
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,083
And all that Twilight stuff.

119
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,916
[ALEX]
I wonder.

120
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,291
Would I be better
off not knowing?

121
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,833
Or maybe...

122
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,416
Thanks for doin'
the laundry, Alex.

123
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,458
Sorry to impose on you.

124
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,416
Hey! Nico!

125
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,625
I thought I told you to
stay in bed, mister!

126
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,625
[NINA] No, you are
most certainly not okay!

127
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,166
Like I always say, if you
wanna get better quickly,

128
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,541
then you've gotta do
as you're told!

129
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:56,500
Come on, Ricky.
You're sure it was Erica?

130
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,750
I mean, it couldn't
a been, could it?

131
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,541
Why would she hunt Twilights?

132
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,333
Maybe you mistook her
for someone else.

133
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,833
Seriously?

134
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,833
Worick remembers the face of
every single friggin' person

135
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,708
who's ever set foot
in this mansion.

136
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,708
There is no way in hell he'd
mix her up with anyone else.

137
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:14,166
Yeah, but it makes no sense.

138
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,500
It wasn't just her face.

139
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,666
That kid who was with her
kept calling her Erica.

140
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,666
The Cristiano boys
all heard him say it.

141
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,333
And I did, too.

142
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,291
Well, that settles it.

143
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,166
All this time...

144
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,666
[DELICO]
I was sure she was dead.

145
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,041
[CHAD]
The orphanage got hit!

146
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,666
Looks like some of
them Twilight kids

147
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,500
may have already been abducted!

148
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:48,375
We've got wounded here!
Send help, and fast!

149
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,708
Yang!

150
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,583
Hey... Ricky.

151
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:08,500
They took... They took all
of the others. Everyone.

152
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,125
Erica, too.

153
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:15,791
I tried. I did my best,
but it wasn't enough.

154
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:19,541
It was so fast. Like they
came outta nowhere.

155
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,666
It wasn't your fault!
It's gonna be all right!

156
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,666
Mr. Monroe's hunting
the monsters who did this.

157
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,666
C'mon, I'm gonna get
you to Doctor Theo's.

158

[CONSTANCE]
Sorry I didn't tell you.

160
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:59,833
[ALEX] It's fine. I was
just surprised, is all.

161
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,083
[CONSTANCE] Hey, I heard you
saved Miss Cristiano's butt

162
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,833
when her club was under attack.

163
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:08,166
Oh yeah. I was jus--
Wha--? Uh. Connie?

Thank you.

00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:18,500
[CONSTANCE] Don't tell anyone
else about us, okay?

things any harder for him.

00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:26,875
Sure.

168
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,666
One more thing.

169
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,041
I want you to hold on to this.

170
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,125
A key? What's it to?

171
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:41,666
[CONSTANCE] This new war's
gonna get a whole lot worse.

172
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,083
If you wanna be alive
to find your brother,

173
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,708
I recommend you get out
of this hellhole. Soon.

174
00:11:56,875 --> 00:12:01,000
[MONROE]
I see. Already, huh?

175
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:06,583
Dammit. I figured we'd still
have a little while longer.

176
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:11,500
Suppose I should start making
preparations myself, then.

You spaced out there.

Oh. I'm good.

00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,583
She's fine. Still sleeping.

188
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,083
Don't bother wakin' her

189

until we get an all-clear
from Club Bastard.

190
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,541
[WORICK]
Long as she's here,

191
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,125
we can keep the heat
off her for a bit.

192
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,541
[ALEX]
Fine, but what about you?

193

Hold that thought.

Yeah, so there's somethin'
I gotta go take care of.

Be a doll and answer any calls.

197

Well, look who's back
on his midget-ass feet.

Keep talkin'.

[WORICK] The Three Laws
are supposed to protect

the Cristiano family,
and look what happens.

203
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,125
Only a matter of time

204
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:38,083
before Mr. Monroe's the
one under attack again.

205
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,541
I don't care how much Miles
and the other old-timers

206
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,250
say they have his back.

207

When the chips are down,

208
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:47,375
the only man in that crew
he can really trust is Delly.

209
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,166
If Nic and I
re-joined the family,

210
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,958
it would help protect
Danny a bit.

211
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,541
But even then,

212
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,000
how much better
are we gonna fare

213
00:14:55,083 --> 00:15:00,125
against guys that gave
Galahad and Marco trouble?

214
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,625
Shit.

215
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,083
Even the government watchdogs
are uppin' their presence.

216
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,541
My bad.

217
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,291
Nah, man. That was all on me.

218
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,458
[WORICK]
That's an unfamiliar face.

219
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,416

Huh...

Mm, yeah, more'r less.

222

week to see it in person.

Oh, so anyway, about those

appeared to be working alone.

We should report it
to Sir Paulklee.

You're right.
We'll send a messenger.

out there now, right?

315
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,500
to protect them.

316
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:34,375
If it weren't for the
Cristianos' logistical support,

317
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:38,333
we'd have absolutely nothing
left to fear from the Monroes.

318
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:54,166
[IVAN] Well then,
Mr. Monroe. It's time.

319
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,500
[CORSICA] All that remains
is that loathsome vixen

320
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,250
and her guild full a Twilights.

321
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,333

322
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:10,875
[DOUG]
I didn't even see it happening.

323
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:16,833
This is bad.
Like, really, really bad.

324
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,166
Ed, no!

325
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,541
[ED]
Go!

326
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:25,875
Go, Doug! Run!

327
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,041
[sniffs]

328
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,666
[laughs]

329
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,000
[CORSICA]
Level it.

330
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:11,708
Then this city will
move on its own.
