1
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:55,625
[PUNK C] Uranos, he-he doesn't
even want Monroe's head!

2
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:57,458
He's after what Monroe protects.

3
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,291
The Cristiano family!

4
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,125
The Cristianos, huh?

5
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,583
I heard their only
business now's drugs.

6
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,500
The Corsicans have
their own drug trade.

7
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,708
What's their angle?

8
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,833
[PUNK C] I... I don't
know their reasons!

9
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:12,666
All I know's what I overheard
the Corsican capos sayin'!

10
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,333
[WORICK] You work for a
Twilight-hater like Uranos

11
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:19,291
and thought it wise to
go off and hire that runt?

12
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,958
Poor guy.

13
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:24,083
It won't do any good to
send you back to them alive.

14
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:28,000
You're just a pawn who
served his purpose.

15
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,458
[MONROE]
I reached out to Chad,

16
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:47,500
made sure all their remains
got returned to us.

17
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,500
The funeral's tomorrow.

18
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,375
[DELICO]
I'm sorry, sir.

19
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,583
Yang.

20
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,916
Did you patch up Delico again?

21
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,750
Didn't I specifically tell you
to take him to Doc Theo's?

22
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:00,833
[YANG]
Uh!

23
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,500
Yes, but, sir, he told
me that he was--

24
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,541
The wound was hardly
life threatening.

25
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,625
I told Yang to go ahead
and stitch me up.

26
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,375
No use wasting the
doctor's time over it.

27
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,041
[sighs]

28
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,833
[MONROE] I know you're
tryin' to play it safe.

29
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,500
And I know there's
bad blood lingerin'

30
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:22,166
from the slavery days,
but you're people,

31
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,708
built a little tougher than
usual, but still people.

32
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,000
You're my shield.

33
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,791
Ya can't be takin'
shortcuts with your health.

34
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,166
I'd prefer to die a quiet,

35
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,500
boring death as
a senile old man.

36
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,750
And so...

37
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:41,333
...that means I need my shield
to be damn near indestructible.

38
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:46,041
I plan on hangin' onto ya
for as long as I possibly can.

39
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,416
[MILES]
Might wanna tone down

40
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,041
the "caring father figure"
routine, boss.

41
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,875
There's bound to be some
youngsters in the family

42
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,458
who get jealous if
they feel they don't get

43
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,833
the same attention.

44
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,291
And where the hell did
"Gunslinger Danny" go?

45
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,083
His name alone used to make
enemies piss their pants.

46
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:10,750
That's just rude.
People still fear me, right?

47
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,375
[MILES]
It's more like...

48
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:15,125
...they're afraid of you
squeezing their cheeks.

49
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,541
[MILES]
If the Handyman's right,

50
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,541
and the Corsicans really
are trying to muscle in

51
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,375
on our Cristiano business,

52
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:28,000
an all-out gang war in the
city will erupt, won't it?

53
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,666
That's a good question.

54
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,083
But this is Ergastulum.

55
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,500
An' considerin'
what I saw today,

56
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,083
it's the only way things can go.

57
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:45,708
[IVAN] Treatin' even foot
soldier scum like family.

58
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,083
It's giving me heartburn.

59
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,125
I know you feel the same way.

60
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,291
[CORSICA]
Why is Monroe still alive?

61
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,083
No one told me it
was gettin' jobbed out

62
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,583
to that dreadlocked
Twilight kid.

63
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:02,708
I panicked. Damn near
got killed myself.

64
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:06,500
[CORSICA] The Twilight's hiring
is on me. I'll deal with that.

65
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:09,041
I'd heard that the only
Twilight Monroe has

66
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,750
is some bullshit D/0.

67
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,166
Seems they hired
extra help, too.

68
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,041
[CORSICA] If you can, search out
their help, and eliminate them.

69
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,500
Yes, sir. Will do.

70
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,416
[CORSICA] Oh, and about those
bodies in the factory.

71
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,208
The old detective linking me
to them would be troublesome.

72
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,750
[IVAN] Don't worry, I got
a cop friend on the take.

73
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,291
Same office as that
old shriveled ol' Dick.

74
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll make sure the
investigation goes nowhere fast.

75
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,250
[IVAN]
Hmph.

76
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,125
[GASTON]
Those are expensive.

77
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,541
Don't waste 'em.

78
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,875
[MERCENARY A]
Your kid always listens.

79
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,416
[GASTON]
He better pay attention.

80
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,250
The dose I give him
is typically just enough

81
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,000
not trigger an attack.

82
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,666
[MERCENARY B]
He needs that much to walk.

83
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,166
Forget being able to
run away from this place.

84
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,208
And if somehow he did bolt, he
wouldn't last long without it.

85
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,333
He knows the key to living
any kind of life at all

86
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:11,166
is to just keep quiet and
do what the humans tell ya.

87
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,458
But, at best, we're
still talking about a life

88
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,625
that croaks in its mid-30s.

89
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:19,125
Why's a Twilight in our
unit in the first place?

90
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,958
[GASTON] Junkie whore I
knocked up had no business

91
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,750
raising a baby addict.

92
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,500
Figured if I could keep him
alive until he's in demand,

93
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,041
I could sell him
off in Ergastulum

94
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,958
and make a nice chunk of change.

95
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,500
So what happened
to your son's mom?

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,666
[GASTON]
Killed her.

97
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:41,708
[phone ringing]

98
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,750
[WORICK]
Ally's not pickin' up.

99
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:50,791
Hm?

100
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,375
Hold it there, Worick!

101
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,750
You can't smoke that in here.
We've got patients!

102
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,208
AW, come on, kid.
Just this one?

103
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:03,333
Yeah, no. But here,
make do with this.

104
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:10,833
So, uh, our boy Nic's
gonna pull through, right?

105
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:14,166
There won't be any permanent
nerve damage, fortunately.

106
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,541
And no broken bones
where he got shot.

107
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:20,083
Once his wounds heal, he'll
be all set to go back to work.

108
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:24,000
Damn straight. He's the
toughest bastard I know.

109
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:28,333
[NINA] Still, I doubt he'll
be able to walk right away.

110
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:29,791
[WORICK]
Hm?

111
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,083
[NINA]
The downers she shot him with

112
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,250
were triple the normal strength.

113
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,416
[WORICK]
Wait, triple?

114
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,250
I don't understand.
I thought the legal limit

115
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,916
was only one-and-a-half
times the regular dose.

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,708
[NINA]
Yes, but Gina's are custom-made.

117
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,666
And that crazy
little runt there,

118
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,416
she hit his kid-size ass
with four of those things?

119
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,375
[NINA] He's got a high
tolerance for downers.

120
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,583
Some people, like Nico,

121
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,500
are more susceptible
to the drug's effects

122
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:59,250
and get totally knocked out
after just a single dose,

123
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,708
but Doug there's the opposite.

124
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,625
Takes a lot for it to
have any effect at all.

125
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:08,083
Fortunately, it was only
Celebrer he got shot with.

126
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,666
Those just pierce
the skin a little,

127
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,791
so even I was able to treat him
and patch up his injuries.

128
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,250
If they'd have been
regular bullets,

129
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:17,916
then Doctor Theo would've
had to extract them.

130
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,041
[gasps]

131
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,416
Uh, Worick?

132
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,208
Oh, sorry, I was just thinkin'
how awesome you are.

133
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,541
You study hard, got
both feet on the ground.

134
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:29,291
Gonna make a hell of a doctor
someday. An' I mean that.

135
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:31,833
Thank you.

136
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:34,166
[WORICK sneezes, groans]

137
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,916
Oh, you poor guy! I'll go make
something to warm you up.

138
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,083
[WALLACE]
Well? Didja learn it?

139
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,333
Simple, right? Now
communicating should be...

140
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:08,333
When you're with me, you
can just act normally, cool?

141
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,125
And when you're with me,
sit in the chair.

142
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,500
Understand?

143
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,291
[WALLACE] It's like trying
to talk to an animal.

144
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,208
Or a machine.

145
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:29,541
Like he's... not really
a person somehow.

146
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,666
Is it that Twilights aren't?

147
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,708
[WALLACE]
No, of course not.

148
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,000
[WALLACE]
Hey, what happened to your arm?

149
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,458
That bruise wasn't
there yesterday.

150
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:48,333
[NICOLAS]
I... I fell down.

151
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:56,166
[WALLACE]
Me too. I fall down a lot.

152
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,875
[DOMENICO] What's all that
commotion out there?

153
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,708
[MAID A] A-Apparently a
riot's broken out nearby.

154
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,750
[DOMENICO] Those anti-Twilight
protestors again?

155
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,458
Get Michel and my wife
to a safe room.

156
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,750
[MAID A] Yes, sir. And what
about Master Wallace?

157
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,375
[DOMENICO]
Leave him.

158
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,250
[clatter]

159
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,291
[gasps]

160
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,625
What?! Are you nuts?!

161
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,625
[DOMENICO] Not only did
you allow an intruder

162
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:39,291
onto the Arcangelo estate,
but then you stain my lawn?

163
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,000
[GASTON]
I'm very sorry, sir.

164
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,416
Don't worry, I'll give him
a stern talkin'-to.

165
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,750
[DOMENICO growls]

166
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,708
[gasps]

167
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:54,583
[thud]

168
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,208
[DOMENICO] What was your plan?
What were you thinking?

169
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,041
That you'd ingratiate
yourself to me?

170
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,375
[DOMENICO] No, you thought
you could tame that boy

171
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,958
and then sic him
on me, is that it?

172
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:11,041
Was this just a
practice run? Was it?

173
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:17,375
No, Dad, I swear! I-I didn't
do anything! Dad, please!

174
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,458
[DOMENICO] Don't grovel like
your slut of a mother did,

175
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,916
you miserable little curse!

176
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,500
[WORICK]
Now that I think about it,

177
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,375
how'd you know we were coming?

178
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,750
[NINA]
What?

179
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:38,041
You were "Jenny-on-the-spot"
with your first aid kit.

180
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,000
Oh, uh...

181
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,125
I heard you talking?

182
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,916
Outside, in that downpour?

183
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,875
[NINA] Well, I've always
had great hearing, and--

184
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:48,833
[sneezes]

185
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,833
Jeez, kid, are you okay?

186
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,041
I'm fine.

187
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:57,333
As I was saying, I can
always tell your voice.

188
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,208
But just yours, Worick.

189
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:02,375
[WORICK] Aw, man.
Am I really that loud?

190
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,583
Guess I oughtta be more careful.

191
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,916
[WORICK]
Nic? Hey.

192
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,416
How you feel, buddy?

193
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,916
Yeah, I know, like crap.

194
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,875
I'm gonna pop back
over to the office.

195
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,083
What? Oh, a change o' clothes?

196
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:02,458
Yeah, fine. I'll bring
somethin' by later.

197
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,750
Hey.

198
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,125
Don't make me do that anymore.

199
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:11,166
Use that word "order"
on a Twilight.

200
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,791
[WORICK]
Here's the deal.

201
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,833
Corsica's on the move.

202
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,583
He's after the Cristianos,

203
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,166
which of course
upsets the balance.

204
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,041
The vics from that body-dumping
case Chad hauled us in for?

205
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:41,166
[WORICK]
They were all Tags.

206
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,541
One of 'em was even that B/2
you beat up outside Doc Theo's.

207
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,208
[WORICK] Don't know what his
connection to Corsica was,

208
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:55,000
but it's clear he was involved
in somethin' bigger.

209
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:59,250
However this shakes out,
the linchpin is Mr. Monroe,

210
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,250
savior of the Twilights.

211
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,291
And the man who's
currently got the Cristianos

212
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,166
under his umbrella.

213
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,916
[WORICK]
I owe him too much.

214
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,333
It's why I can't let anything
happen to the Monroes.

215
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,791
You're with me, right? Partner?

216
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:20,541
[MIKHAIL laughing]

217
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,875
[AIDE A]
Are you sure about this?

218
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,708
[CORSICA]
Of course I'm sure.

219
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,000
I'll be in a bad
mood if he lives.

220
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,041
[MIKHAIL laughing]

221
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,708
[CORSICA] We must make
an example of that punk,

222
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,083
so all who work for us

223
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:39,041
know they can never hire
Twilights in Corsica's name.

224
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,125
[WALLACE]
I'm beat.

225
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,916
[WALLACE]
Sign language?

226
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,000
[MERCENARY B]
What do we do?

227
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,958
[GASTON]
Get the injector! Hurry!

228
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,375
[MERCENARY A]
Yes, sir!

229
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:16,041
[GASTON] Don't let him pass out.
It'll make things worse.

230
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:19,000
[MERCENARY A]
Hey! Nicky, wake up!

231
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,208
[MERCENARY B] We can't let
anyone see him like this!

232
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,375
[MERCENARY A]
Let's get him on his feet.

233
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,000
[WORICK]
Odd.

234
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:32,166
Don't normally see fancy black
cars passin' through here.

235
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,333
[NICOLAS]
I've said it for years.

236
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:49,000
It's no use. It was
always gonna end this way.

237
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:53,000
[NICOLAS] No matter how hard
they try to help us,

238
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,375
we're just not gonna make it.

239
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,083
Nicolas.

240
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,708
Doesn't it bother you?

241
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,000
If I were you,
I would run away.

242
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,833
Come on.

243
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,583
Doesn't it make you wanna
just punch the wall?

244
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,041
[WALLACE]
Don't you ever ask... "why?"

245
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,000
[chuckles]

246
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,458
[WALLACE]
That's sloppy.

247
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:36,000
[WALLACE laughing]

248
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,125
[FEMALE RADIO VOICE A] Riots led
by anti-Twilight factions

249
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,333
at the four gates surrounding
Ergastulum have escalated,

250
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:44,541
and the Twilight hunts that
accompany them are on the rise.

251
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,500
The government has called
in mercenary forces

252
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:50,291
from all over to bring the
situation under control.

253
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:57,375
[RIOTERS shouting]

254
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,958
[MERCENARY B] Damn it!
There's too many of 'em!

255
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,375
We can't break through!

00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,625
Everyone, fall back!
Fall back, now!

257
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,666
[WORICK] Damn!
Freezin' my nuts off out here!

258
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,166
[WORICK]
She with a client?

259
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,125
Hey. Ally! I'm ho--

260
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:47,000
[THEO]
I, uh, helped myself.

261
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,958
She bit me. Scratched me, too.

262
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,291
Looks sweet enough,

263
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,750
but that stray you took in
has a violent streak.

264
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:54,875
If you're gonna keep her,

265
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,458
you might wanna try
housebreakin' her.

266
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,583
Doc Theo?

267
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,083
[THEO]
After everything you said,

268
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,958
I thought I should probably
drop by and check in on her.

269
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,458
[THEO]
The symptoms you told me about.

270
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:09,791
Seeming distant,

271
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:13,083
like she's got cobwebs
clouding her brain.

272
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:17,541
Fuzzy memories.
Having trouble sleeping.

273
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,291
Those are all textbook
side effects

274
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:24,166
of the pills pimps use to keep
their women... complacent.

275
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,250
On the street,
they're called "TBs".

276
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,208
Figured you'd already
know all about 'em,

277
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:32,875
but I guess not, huh?

278
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:36,375
Good news is, even though
they're long-acting,

279
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,041
there's hardly any
toxicity to 'em

280
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,333
and they're not
particularly addictive.

281
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:43,958
Bad news is there's
a high suicide rate.

282
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,458
As the effects wear off,

283
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,833
there are intense hallucinations
that can drive them to it.

284
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,541
As a coping mechanism,

285
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,833
they often cling desperately
to their surroundings

286
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:57,041
or to objects that
have been given to them.

287
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:00,250
Even if those things are
utterly meaningless.

288
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,750
[WORICK]
I got careless.

289
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,958
Thought she was
doing better lately.

290
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,583
Where is she?

291
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,375
Ally, thank God!

292
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,333
Did you have a customer?

293
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,125
[WORICK] Let's get
you back to the office.

294
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,708
C'mon, you're gonna
catch a cold like tha--

295
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,750
Whoa, hold on!

296
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,916
Stop it! Stop!

297
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,916
Ally! It's me! Knock it off!

298
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,041
Ally!

299
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,583
[ALEX]
No, Barry.

300
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:02,750
Please don't hit me.
I'll do it. I will. Please.

301
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,541

00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,666
[ALEX]
Worick.

303
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,708
B-Barry's right there.

304
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,875
He's always right there.

305
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,958
I know he's dead, but...

306
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,458
No, I-I have to go.

307
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,208
If I don't, then h-he's gonna.

308
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,166
[ALEX]
Oh my gosh, Worick!

309
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:41,708
I'm sorry! I have a,
uh, really hard head.

310
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,291
So, listen.

311
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,500
When you're alone with a guy,

312
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,791
he doesn't like hearin'
another man's name.

313
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,416
'Sides, who do you
think killed him?

314
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,041
[WORICK]
Heh.

315
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,958
I don't know about you,
Ally, but I am beat.

316
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,208
Man, I am tellin' ya.

317
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,500
Nothin' went right for me today.

318
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,666
Put in cuffs, job goes
sideways, then it rains,

319
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,583
and to top it off,
Nic ruined my favorite shirt.

320
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,625
Total shit show of a day.

321
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,333
But hey, I did get to touch
your sweet behind again,

322
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,875
so I guess I'm
all right now. Heh.

323
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,708
[ALEX]
Jackass.

324
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:50,541
[NICOLAS]
Master Wallace.

325
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:55,208
I'm awfully sorry.

326
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,250
[NICOLAS]
I messed it up.

327
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,625
Great. Well now what?

328
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,666
Only had the one
copy, you dummy.

329
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:11,125
What happened?
How did you hurt your face?

330
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,791
[WALLACE]
I fell down.
