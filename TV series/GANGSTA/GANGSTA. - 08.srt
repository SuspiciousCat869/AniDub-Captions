[sirens wailing]

00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:54,375
[CHAD]
Police! Move it! Outta my way!

3
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:55,958
Oh, hey, Chad.

4
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,041
What's up?

5
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,958
Got another three
Twilight victims.

6
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:01,000
Wrong place,
wrong time it seems.

7
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,875
According to witnesses, they
were jumped by an angry mob...

8
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,375
...of Normals.

9
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,250
Anti-Twilight vigilantes.

10
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,833
Yes, sir. There's no
doubt about it now.

11
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:16,166
Ha, ha. History repeats itself.

12
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:24,875
[hammering]

13
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,041
[WORICK]
Ow!

14
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,916
Are you okay?

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,500
[WORICK]
Yeah. Oh, before I forget.

16
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:34,291
One of our clients is throwin'
a little party tonight;

17
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,958
I want you to come with us.

18
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,666
Already got you a dress
picked out and everything.

19
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,583
A party?

20
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:43,458
Oh, right. The one
at Cristiano's place.

21
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:44,833
[WORICK]
Yep!

22
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,750
[CONSTANCE] Well, Handyman,
aren't you Mr. Popular.

23
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,291
Hey. Let the guys do the work.

24
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,125
Come n' sit. Have some tea.

25
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,416
Uh, I don't know.

26
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,000
I guess one cup won't hurt.

27
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,250
[CONSTANCE]
Given the kinda business I'm in,

28
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:09,625
I get plenty a customers who
don't get along with each other.

29
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:13,958
I tell 'em to take it outside,
but hey, what can ya do, right?

30
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,708
[CONSTANCE]
Here ya go.

31
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,041
[ALEX]
Thank you.

32
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,083
Your name's Alex, isn't it?

33
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,291
Uh, yeah.

34
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,125
[CONSTANCE]
Hey, I'm Constance.

35
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,500
Call me Connie for short.

36
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,916
It's good to officially
meet ya, Al.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,833
[ALEX]
Yeah, likewi--

38
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,375
Wow. It's amazing.
They feel so real.

39
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,333
That's 'cause they are.

40
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:47,458
[WORICK] Huh? What are we
chargin' 'em to work the party?

41
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,958
Discount rate.

42
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,625
Hey, I'd like to bilk
'em for more, too,

43
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,750
but you know the Cristianos are
the poorest outta the families.

44
00:03:56,416 --> 00:04:00,333
'Least the weather's clear.
Should be a nice soiree.

45
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,208
[MONROE]
When he came at me years ago,

46
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,708
it wasn't "revenge
for a friend,"

47
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,208
it was simply a Twilight
defending his contract holder.

48
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,625
[NICOLAS]
Sounds to me like

49
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:22,500
Monroe's got you thinkin' for
his bottom line instead of ours.

50
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:27,416
Wish you'd finally stand up for
yourself, Mr. Contract Holder.

51
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,791
Excuse you? You got some ner--

52
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,708
[NICOLAS] I get it.
It's because of me.

53
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:36,708
That's why you let him
walk all over you, isn't it?

54
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,250
Workin' out your guilt is fine.

55
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:43,208
Just don't take it
out on him. Or on her.

56
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,500
[sighs]

57
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,625
[JOEL]
Quit slackin', ya lazy bums!

58
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:48,833
[WORICK yelps]

59
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,166
I'm payin' for this,
I want it done right!

60
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,875
So get back to work!

61
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,375
Did ya have to poke so hard?

62
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,583
Well, well.

63
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,750
Grandma!

64
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,125
She's your actual grandma?

65
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,083
[CONSTANCE]
Mh-hm. You've met?

66
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,958
[JOEL] Surprised you're still
workin' for the Handymen.

67
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,333
I warned you about
stayin' too long, right?

68
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,666
Let alone with them.

69
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,250
Oh!

70
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,708
So you're the hooker workin' the
Off-Limits Zone she talks about.

71
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,166
[ALEX]
Uh...

72
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,791
Well it looks like you've
quit the business at least.

73
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:24,333
Yeah. She'll go back to
the life before ya know it.

74
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,000
Believe me, I've
seen it more times

75
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,041
than you'd care to imagine.

76
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,375
[chuckles]

77
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:34,416
She says that.
But just ignore her, Al.

78
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,958
When you're not around,

79
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,625
Granny just worries about you
pickin' up some psycho john

80
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:38,708
who gets too--

81
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,791
[JOEL]
Mind your own business, Connie!

82
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:43,541
[CONSTANCE] Gran'ma!
You're gonna rip my ear off!

83
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,250
[JOEL laughing]

84
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,208
You're terrible, Granny.
You shouldn't joke like that.

85
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,666
[CONSTANCE]
But seriously, Al.

86
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,458
How long are you planning
on working for the Handymen?

87
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,333
[ALEX]
Huh?

88
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,500
[CONSTANCE]
At some point,

89
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,166
you gotta go back to
your family, right?

90
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,291
[ALEX]
My... family?

91
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:10,541
Oh, sorry. Are they
not around, or...?

92
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,750
[ALEX]
Um, yeah, one is.

93
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:16,875
My brother. I have
a younger brother.

94
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,083
At least, I think so.

95
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:23,708
From what I remember,
he's somewhere in East Gate.

96
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:27,750
But... I don't even know
if he's still alive.

97
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,458
[NICOLAS]
Constance. Paint?

98
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,333
Aw, I thought that'd be enough.

99
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,541
Here, I'll get another gallon.

100
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,875
[ALEX]
How...?

101
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,458
[ALEX] How could I have
forgotten him all this time?

102
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:49,125
Someone as important
as my brother?

103
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,458
[gasps]

104
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,333
[ALEX]
I'm still-- Dammit!

105
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,458
No, I'm fine.

106
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,958
It's just my stabilizer's
worn off, that's all.

107
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:09,333
I'll be okay. I'll be okay.

108
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,125
Nicola--

109
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,833
He's gone.

110
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,583
[CONSTANCE]
Here. For your trouble.

111
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,291
Our pleasure.

112
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,375
Guess we'll see ya the next time

113
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,291
a bunch o' thugs
trash your place.

114
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,875
[JOEL]
Hold it right there, Handymen.

115
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,791
I made too much navarin.

116
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,666
Do me a favor and
eat some of it.

117
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,000
Ah! I love Gram'ma's navarin!

118
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,916
Come on! Navarin! Let's go!

119
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,083
[WORICK] Sorry to leave
you alone like that.

120
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,000
Our mom was out of the picture,

121
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:20,083
so it was up to me
to take care of him.

122
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,208
To comfort my little brother
whenever he got upset.

123
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:27,125
He should always be
in my thoughts,

124
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,625
yet I can barely remember him.

125
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:34,291
[ALEX]
His face. His voice.

126
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,250
Everything from
before Barry took me in.

127
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,041
It's like a thick haze.

128
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,750
All the memories you
lost thanks to the TBs

129
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:46,000
should start
returning gradually.

130
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:50,125
And that's comin' from Doc
Theo, so you can count on it.

131
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:53,583
And you know, once they do come
back, if you wanna go home,

132
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,791
then by all means.

133
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,458
This town ain't
any kinda place

134
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,041
for a girl like you to live.

135
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:04,416
You should get out.
Soon as you're able.

136
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,958
But till then,

137
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:09,208
well, you are more than
welcome to crash on our couch

138
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,750
for as long as ya need to.

139
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,583
[CONSTANCE]
Hey, Al! Worick!

140
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,791
Get in here, or we're
gonna eat it all!

141
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,625
She ain't playin'.
We'd better hurry.

142
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,416
[CONSTANCE]
Yo, Al! Get your butt up here!

143
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:35,791
Here we are.
Er-fuckin'-gastulum.

144
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:47,916
[ALEX]
So...

145
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,708
[WORICK]
Yeah?

146
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,666
When you said
there was a party...

147
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,625
[WORICK] Hey. Bastard is
a nice, friendly joint.

148
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,083
And, unlike Big Mama's place,

149
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,916
Twilights are always welcome
and treated with respect.

150
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:09,958
[GALAHAD] 'Sup, Mr. Handyman!
Welcome to Bastard!

151
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,750
You're late!

152
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,208
You've got a lot
of freaking nerve

153
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,000
to keep me waiting like this!

154
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,833
Ah, sorry about that,
Miss Cristiano.

155
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,416
Guess I spent too much
time pickin' these out.

156
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,541
Boom!

157
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,750
You're forgiven.

158
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,125
[ALEX]
Is that the boss' daughter?

159
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:32,541
So you must be the
new girl, Alex Benedetto.

160
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,291
[WORICK]
Oh right, Ally.

161
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:40,208
Meet Loretta Cristiano Amodio,
boss of the Cristiano Family.

162
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:44,250
The boss?
She's just a little girl!

163
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:48,166
Got a problem?
I'll have you know I--

164
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,375
Dammit! We're not all
smuggling cantaloupes!

165
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,916
Some of us have to
do more with less!

166
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,750
But I'll have you know I at
least still hold the lives

167
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,458
of all the Twilights
in my hands!

168
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,708
What's that mean?

169
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:01,791
I think I can
clarify that for you.

170
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,708
When it comes to the Four
Fathers that run this city,

171
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:08,750
the Paulklee Guild hires
out the mercenary Twilights.

172
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:12,500
The Corsica family trades
in weapons and vice.

173
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,083
The Monroe family manages
business and assistance

174
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:18,250
for the Twilights not
associated with the Guild.

175
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,500
And then there's us,
the Cristiano family.

176
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,000
We're in charge of
distributing Celebrer,

177
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,833
which is essential to the
survival of all Twilights.

178
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,166
A Tag?

179
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,291
Pardon the late introduction.

180
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:36,458
Marco. Marco Adriano,
at your service.

181
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,500
And I'm Galahad Woehor!

182
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,708
Manager of this
fine establishment.

183
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,583
Oh. What a tremendous view!

184
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:44,958
[GALAHAD chuckling]

185
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,125
[screams]

186
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,375
[LORETTA]
Ew, Gal, gross! You sick perv!

187
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,958
[GALAHAD] Hey, that's
not very ladylike, miss.

188
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,541
Ow! I'm sorry!
I take it back! Ow!

189
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:53,875
[WORICK]
Yo, Gal!

190
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:54,875
[GALAHAD]
Uh?

191
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,708
That'll be a
hundred for staring.

192
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:57,458
[ALEX growls]

193
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,750
--[thud]
--[WORICK] Ow!

194
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,500
Okay, so seven in
front, five out back.

195
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:25,500
And to the north? More, huh?

196
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:28,208
Damn, that's a lot
more than usual.

197
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,875
Just goes to show ya though,

198
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,125
these anti-Twilight
assholes never learn.

199
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:36,208
I know the Cristianos've
got money problems.

200
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,583
Their fault for not lettin' go

201
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:41,083
of their hypocritical,
unprofitable business model.

202
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,708
Still, by helpin' 'em,

203
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:46,166
we at least get a hot meal
out of it, so that's somethin'.

204
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,583
Oh, here we go.

205
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,250
And hey, partner.

206
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,500
No killing any Normals.

207
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,041
We're under strict orders.

208
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,541
We were hired to escort the
Twilights as far as the club,

209
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,375
and that's it.

210
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,833
Damn it, Nic!

211
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,416
Would it kill you to wait
until I'm finished talking?

212
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:10,791
[ALL gasp]

213
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:23,958
[piano playing]

214
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:28,416
[ALEX] Great. Worick and
Nicolas have both disappeared.

215
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,708
Figures they'd end up
working tonight.

216
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,083
Shoulda just stayed home.

217
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,875
[ALEX]
Although, it is nice out.

218
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:51,083
[ALEX] Seems like it
hasn't been in a long time.

219
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,291
I should just enjoy it.

220
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,750
It's been too long for me, too.

221
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,625
Oh. I know this.

222
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:08,250
[humming]

223
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:15,375
[singing]

224
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,791
[singing continues]

225
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,791
[MARCO]
Boss.

226
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:30,458
Isn't this risky?
A party at a time like this?

227
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:33,083
[LORETTA] That's exactly
why I'm throwing it!

228
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,500
What would you do, Marco?

229
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,291
Sit back and cower while
mobs of bigots kill Twilights

230
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,083
just because they're
born different?

231
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:43,416
[MARCO] But the situation's
changed since last time.

232
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,625
We can't risk putting
you in danger anymore.

233
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,333
[LORETTA]
Risking myself is leadership.

234
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,833
I am fulfilling my
responsibilities!

235
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,625
And you will fulfill yours!

236
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,375
Which means not letting
anyone get in the way

237
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,250
of me doing my job!

238
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,208
You got it?

239
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,541
[MARCO]
My God.

240
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,833
She sounds more and more
like her father every day.

241
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,083
[LORETTA]
Let's go, Marco.

242
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,750
Stick with me.
Things are gonna get busy.

243
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:11,791
Right!

244
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,500
[gunshot]

245
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,083
Was that... gunfire?

246
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,541
Oh, crap. Miss Cristiano!

247
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:35,416
You see that building
there 'cross the way?

248
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,708
Cops always have an eye
on this place, 24/7, 365.

249
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:41,708
[ALEX]
What?

250
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:44,083
The Cristianos
may move Celebrer,

251
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,541
but legally, they're not
allowed to openly deal

252
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,458
with Twilights themselves.

253
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:51,125
That means we can't go out
there and help the Handymen.

254
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:52,625
I'm sorry.

255
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:53,833
And when they are here,

256
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,791
I'll need you to act
like you don't know 'em.

257
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:59,791
You what?

258
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,583
[GALAHAD]
Think of tonight's party as a...

259
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,250
...temporary Twilight refuge.

260
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,250
But of course, it's got
nothing to do with the family.

261
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,125
[NINA]
You're probably just afraid

262
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,666
because you don't know yet.

263
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,375
About Twilights, I mean.

264
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,000
[LORETTA]
Hope you had a good time.

265
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:26,291
Uh, thanks, Miss Cristiano.

266
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,083
So then, Benedetto.

267
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,208
Can't use the
Handymen officially,

268
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,416
but we might just
have a job for you.

269
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,666
Uh, what?

270
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,416
[chuckles]

271
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,625
Ladies and gentlemen,
honored guests of Bastard!

272
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,541
Allow me to introduce
our new diva

273
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,125
and tonight's entertainment!

274
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,791
Now, put your hands together.

275
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:51,166
Traveling all the way from
East Gate, the Music City!

276
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,041
Alex Benedetto!

277
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,541
Thank you.

278
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,416
Our last singer quit in a huff
and left us in the lurch.

279
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,291
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on!

280
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,666
I can't sing in front
of like... people!

281
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,125
So then why the hell
are you here?

282
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,416
Worick told us
your voice rocked.

283
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,916
Said it was too good to waste
bouncing off back alley walls

284
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,833
for no one to hear but the rats.

285
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,125
[ALEX]
He's heard me?

286
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:20,958
Huh? Why'd I insist on takin'
Ally to the club tonight?

287
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,916
Good question, but
I'm sorry, my friend,

288
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,750
this is one I don't think
you can actually appreciate.

289
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:30,833
It's her singing voice.
I just really like it.

290
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,541
[grumbles]

291
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,041
So. Let's finish these
cheese-dicks off.

292
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,083
Don't wanna miss her song.

293
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:52,166
[applause]

294
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:05,166
Ugh. Erica, those guys
are seriously useless.

295
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,958
Erica, I'm so bored.
Come on, let's go already.

296
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,500
Please?
