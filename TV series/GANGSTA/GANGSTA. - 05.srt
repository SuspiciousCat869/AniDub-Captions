1
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:44,458
[TV ANNOUNCER A] ...announcement
made earlier this afternoon.

2
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:47,083
The move came in response
to the recent string

3
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,916
of Twilight slayings in the city

4
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,166
as well as revelations
that have come to light

5
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,791
regarding widespread violations

6
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,583
of their fundamental
human rights.

7
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:58,083
Appalled by stories of physical
abuse and sexual exploitation,

8
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,625
slavery has been abolished

9
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,833
with a new set of
Three Laws imposed...

10
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,333
See ya, Wallace.

11
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:06,000
[WALLACE]
Hope you hire me again sometime.

12
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,958
[TV ANNOUNCER A] Seen as a
deterrent to criminal activity,

13
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,458
these Three Laws...

14
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,458
[WALLACE] Hey, Nic!
Wanna grab something to eat?

15
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,666
We can try that fancy
place on the main drag.

16
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,916
The client I was just with

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,041
says they'll even serve
Twilights there, too...

18
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,791
[TV ANNOUNCER A] Twilights
are those individuals born

19
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,375
with the residual
genetic effects

20
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,458
of the bio-enhancement
drug Celebrer,

21
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,166
which was used in the
East-West War of Unification

22
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,458
before it was--

23
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,416
[CHAD]
They're gonna start enforcing

24
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,583
those Three Laws today.

25
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:37,000
Should go and pay your
respects to Danny later.

26
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:40,208
Least now you guys won't have
to feel quite so ashamed about.

27
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,041
[NICOLAS mumbling]

28
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,458
[CHAD]
Huh?

29
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:43,875
What was that?

30
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:52,541
[NICOLAS]
It's no use. Any of it.

31
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,958
Oh, heya, Ginger.
Here to see the boss?

32
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,041
[GINGER]
Y-Yeah.

33
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,250
[phone ringing]

34
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,958
[HAUSEN]
Hi, this is the Paulklee Guild.

35
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:16,208
Uh. 'Scuse me, S-Sir Paulklee.

36
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,541
[PAULKLEE]
Spit it, Ginger.

37
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,916
It's, it's, um...

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,583
Doug's taken a job w-without
the Guild's permission.

39
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:27,208
And it s-seems he had
a run-in with the Handymen.

40
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,625
[PAULKLEE]
The Handymen?

41
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,458
So, what kind of job was it?

42
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,250
[GINGER] Uh... Um, yeah,
that's the thing.

43
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:38,333
H-He's been hired
to kill Boss Monroe.

44
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:41,750
[PAULKLEE]
Huh?

45
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:43,958
[WORICK]
I just need you to answer

46
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:47,000
a couple of questions
for me, that's all.

47
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,458
For starters, who is it
you're workin' for?

48
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:51,875
And second,
what's the game here?

49
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,083
What kinda scheme
you try'nna pull

50
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,666
on the Monroe and
Cristiano families?

51
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,250
[PUNK C]
Go to hell, man. Seriously!

52
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,000
I ain't no goddamn rat!

53
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,625
You... You ain't gonna
get away with this--

54
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,375
[YANG]
Y-You want us to bet on 'em?

55
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,083
How can you say that, Boss?

56
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:15,625
That Tag Nico's fighting is
ranked just as high as he is!

57
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,833
We gotta help 'im!

58
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,083
[MONROE]
Oh, Yang.

59
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,416
Gunfire only gets in the
way for guys like them.

60
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,583
[YANG]
But, Boss...

61
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,875
All right, Miles,
which one ya want?

62
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,583
I'll take the Handyman.

63
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,208
Diego. Which one?

64
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,083
[DIEGO] Uh. Here, I'm
putting my money on the kid.

65
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:34,583
Hey, last call to place
your bets, guys.

66
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,416
Delico, aren't you
gonna say some--

67
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,625
[YANG]
Delico?

68
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,291
[DOUG]
Ha-ha! Finally.

69
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:16,375
This is it. This is what
I've been waiting for.

70
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,333
An A/0 who's
not in the Guild!

71
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,000
[DOUG]
Aw, shit yeah.

72
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,708
So glad I took the
assignment to off Monroe!

73
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,250
Holy...

74
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,750
Whoa.

75
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,958
[MONROE]
How many years has it been?

76
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,791
There was this one
clueless Twilight

77
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:49,208
who tried to bring down the
whole family all on his own.

78
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:53,125
He was just 14 at the time.

79
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:57,250
Had "C/3" engraved
on his scorched tags.

80
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,625
Of course,

81
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,791
it wasn't the first Twilight
attack we'd had to face.

82
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,000
But even Normals like us

83
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:06,291
could usually handle
a little bit of trouble.

84
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,625
Plus, back then,

85
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,916
the family had two guys
we'd hired from the Guild.

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,083
A B/2 and a B/0.

87
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,708
Though that false
sense of security

88
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,500
would bite us in the ass.

89
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,583
We did manage to bring
down the little prick,

90
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,750
but by the end of his attack,
the mansion was in shambles.

91
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,458
It was quite the scare.

92
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,708
How'd he do so much damage?

93
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,541
You sure he was a C/3?

94
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:29,958
We never heard all this.

95
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,208
Well, of course not.

96
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,791
While we were
fightin' off that Tag,

97
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,916
you two were still pissin'
the bed at the orphanage.

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,833
[MONROE] Yeah, and you haven't
even heard the best part.

99
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,500
His reason for hittin' us
was pretty hysterical.

100
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,333
Had nothin' to do
with bumping me off

101
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,000
or even stealing valuables, he--

102
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,416
He wanted revenge
against a Monroe goon.

103
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,291
Guy'd beat the hell
out of his friend.

104
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,541
And all this friend did
wrong was rock the sheets

105
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,833
with the girl the
goon was datin'.

106
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:54,916
You're here.

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,666
Well of course.
You're our best client.

108
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,541
[YANG]
Hey, Ricky!

109
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,000
You took your sweet time.

110
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:04,875
Yeah, sorry, I had
to make a stop first.

111
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,541
[MILES]
And what'd you find out?

112
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,666
[WORICK] Not sure if
you noticed this or not,

113
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,500
but the dudes attacking
are with the Corsicans.

114
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,333
Bullshit.

115
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,208
There's no way the Corsicans
bring in a Twilight for help.

116
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,958
[WORICK] Apparently, the
family's younger members

117
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,666
wanna make names
for themselves.

118
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,416
This hit is their bright idea.

119
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,875
[MILES]
Hmm. Dumb kids.

120
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,833
They're not thinkin' long term.

121
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,458
[WORICK]
Got that right.

122
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:32,000
Trouble is their stupidity
came with a catch.

123
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,625
[DELICO]
Hm?

124
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:36,000
A catch? Like what?

125
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,708
That Tag's a wild card.

126
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,500
[WORICK]
Ooh.

127
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,541
[YANG] Okay. I really think
we should help, guys.

128
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:05,791
Keep 'em!

129
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,833
They're a thank you gift
for breakin' my knife.

130
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,625
But to be continued, big guy.

131
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:13,500
I gotta finish the job
they hired me for.

132
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:14,916
Getting Monroe's head!

133
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,166
[YANG]
Damn it! Again?

134
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,208
Aw, hell. Grab Monroe!

135
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,125
[MONROE]
Always on task, that Nicolas,

136
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,291
even when facing
one of his brothers.

137
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,583
Such a good boy.

138
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,083
[WORICK] Hey, partner!
We're Handymen, not garbage men.

139
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,916
You're hurtin'
our brand's image!

140
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,166
The kid's comin' back.

141
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,541
Hey, wait a sec,
are you wearing my shirt?

142
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,708
You dick!
That was expensive, man!

143
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,375
[DOUG yells]

144
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,000
[WORICK groaning]

145
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:57,166
Dammit. Be a little
more gentle next time.

146
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,375
[WORICK]
Wait! Nic!

147
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,791
Ah, hell. Not again.

148
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,833
[NICOLAS]
He didn't hit the nerve.

149
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:11,375
That had to be what
he was aiming for.

150
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:15,625
I gotta end this soon.
Before the Celebrer wears off.

151
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:19,541
[WORICK]
Nic, hold up! Nic!

152
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,166
[WORICK]
That idiot.

153
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,291
Doc Theo's always warnin'
him to stop this shit.

154
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,666
It destroys his sense of pain.

155
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,916
[DOUG]
Damn, that hurts!

156
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,541
What kinda dumb fuck grabs
a guy's blade with bare hands?

157
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:34,791
I was wrong.

158
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,458
If I wanna take out Monroe,

159
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,541
I will have to take out
this bastard first.

160
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,958
[MILES] Hey, should your pal
even be doin' this?

161
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,333
[WORICK]
Nope. Absolutely not.

162
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,708
[MILES grumbles]

163
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:56,458
As a matter of fact,
Nic OD'd on Celebrer again.

164
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,625
[MILES]
That is bad.

165
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,958
[DELICO] So that's how Nic's
not even fazed by his injuries.

166
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:05,291
[WORICK] Miles, I need ya to go
contact the Paulklee Guild.

167
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,125
[MILES]
The Guild? Does that mean--?

168
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,083
[WORICK] Yeah, that Tag up
there's affiliated with them.

169
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,583
His name is Doug.

170
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:16,541
So if we or Nic kill him,
we'll really be up the creek.

171
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,916
[MILES] I understand.
No argument here.

172
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,125
[WORICK]
You better jet.

173
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,166
There's a shortcut up
that set of stairs.

174
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,583
[MILES] Right. Stop by
once you've fixed all this.

175
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,916
[WORICK]
Will do.

176
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,458
Mr. Monroe, always a pleasure.

177
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,083
I hate to leave like this.

178
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,541
That little Tag really
made things interesting.

179
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,916
[MILES] It's dangerous out here,
and you know it. Let's go.

180
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,583
[MONROE]
Oh!

181
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,916
One more thing, Worick.

182
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,875
About what you said earlier,

183
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,583
you got a key detail wrong.

184
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,541
When he came at me years ago,

185
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,000
it wasn't "revenge
for a friend,"

186
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:51,583
it was simply a Twilight
defending his contract holder.

187
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,500
Hmph. Well, I consider
us good friends.

188
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,875
Whether he does, or not.

189
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,791
[DELICO]
So, does that mean

190
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:11,708
that C/3 in the boss's
story was actually...?

191
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:19,416
[ALEX humming]

192
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:38,083
Looks like it might rain.

193
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:45,708
[DOUG grunting]

194
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,750
[MONROE]
When he came at me years ago,

195
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,250
it wasn't "revenge
for a friend,"

196
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,875
it was simply a Twilight
defending his contract holder.

197
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,833
[WORICK]
Dammit, that's aggravating.

198
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:03,000
Old bastard's right.
I know he is.

199
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:06,166
Boy, do I know it.

200
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,083
But how am I supposed
to stop this?

201
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:13,625
I mean, I gotta do somethin'
before she shows up.

202
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:17,500
Huh... Maybe I could
take out the kid's legs.

203
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,541
[footsteps]

204
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,000
[yelps]

205
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,333
[WORICK]
Too late!

206
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,166
[CHAD]
All right. I understand.

207
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,541
So, uh, what did the
Monroe family want?

208
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,875
[CHAD]
They said one of the attackers

209
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,833
was a member of the Guild.

210
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,166
[CODY]
Huh?

211
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,541
But... I thought Mr. Monroe
was fully protected.

212
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,250
Besides, doesn't this
violate the Three Laws?

213
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,250
We're talkin' 'bout
Danny and Gina here.

214
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:55,166
They'll find a way to settle
this between themselves.

215
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,416
Forget about them,
our priority is those bodies.

216
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,083
C'mon, gimme a hand.

217
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,583
Right.

218
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,250
[CHAD]
Oh, and, Cody,

219
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:15,375
don't mention the Three Laws
in front of me ever again.

220
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:18,083
Don't like 'em. Never have.

221
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,333
[DOUG]
I don't get it.

222
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,750
How am I the only
one outta breath?

223
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,916
Somethin's off about this guy.

224
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,041
After all I done to him,
he's actin' like it's nothin'.

225
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,666
[gasps]

226
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,041
A freakin' overdose?

Really? The hell're
you thinkin', bro?

00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,000
Hold on! Wait a sec!

231
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,791
[DOUG]
Uh. What?

232
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,166
Ginger?

233
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:19,333
P-Please s-stop this.
Stop fighting im-mmediately.

234
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,875
[NICOLAS] This four-eyed
chick's with the Guild.

235
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,958
[whimpers]

a rest. She's here.

Now!

00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,750
That's an order!

239
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,500
Heh. Sorry 'bout that.

240
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:05,000
Sometimes he doesn't
listen so good.

241
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:08,583
I th-think it's wise
to restrain him.

[PAULKLEE] The Four Fathers
fought tooth-and-nail

247
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,708
to put those Three
Laws into effect.

248
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:32,333
They did so in order to liberate
us Twilights from slavery.

249
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,250
And it's because of these laws

250
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,375
that what minimal rights
we have are guaranteed.

251
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:42,125
If you violate them,
it puts us all at risk.

252
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:47,250
All of this was drilled
into you as a child.

253
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:50,500
Yet you still don't
know when to quit.

You know Daniel Monroe's life

00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,916
is protected under
the Three Laws.

258
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,375
Besides, his death would
upset the balance of power

259

in Ergastulum.

Fine, I'll buy you a new one.

Oh, man! Come on!

[ALEX]
It's really comin' down.

319
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,083
I hope the boys
are someplace dry.

[ALEX]
No. It's impossible.

322
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,166
I watched him die
right in front of me.

323
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:27,083
I shot him. I did.
Again and again and again.

324
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,666
It happened.

325
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:43,958
Idiot. All this and I still...?

Oh, guys! I'm sorry!
Are you okay?

00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,791
[WORICK]
Ow.

[WORICK]
Sorry to drop in.

00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,583
Nina, dear.
Can you patch them up?

336
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:51,250
Also, do you have a phone
here I can borrow?

337
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,708
[NINA]
Uh...
