[IVAN] Damn anti-Twilights
ain't exactly the brightest,

4
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,666
are they?

5
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,750
These folks've dedicated
their whole lives to a cause.

6
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,125
Namely wipin' out
the likes of you.

7
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,500
But they don't seem to actually
know the first thing about

8
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,541
how to do it.

9
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,208
Up till now, the reason why

you cockroaches haven't
been exterminated for good

11

[muffled scream]

00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,541
[LORETTA] Hey. Not
half-bad for your first time.

18
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,208
Yeah. It was fun.

That's more like it.

22
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,208
[LORETTA]
I hear you're a working girl.

23
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,208
One of my guys says he
occasionally sees you

24
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,125
walking the streets
of the Off-Limits Zone.

25
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,875
Yeah, that's right.

26
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,458
Well, seeing as how your head's
still attached to your body,

27
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:27,166
you must have some incredible
luck on your side.

Although Inspector Adkins
and the Handymen

seem to have your back.

Anyway, my point is one
of our girls just quit.

31
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500

[LORETTA] I dunno. Feels like
you'd fit in nicely here.

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
[LORETTA]
Kidding.

35
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:49,041
My mom was one, too. A pro.

36
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,458
She lived on the streets

37
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,166
till my father fell head over
heels and married her.

38
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,708
She was the first
diva to sing here.

39
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,375
See that?

40
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,000
That's my mom.

00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,166
Wow, she's really beautiful.

42
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,708
[LORETTA] People always tell me
what a great woman she was.

43
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,000
But I wouldn't know.

44
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,708
It sucks.

45
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:13,166
She died a pointless death
not long after I was born.

46
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,458
She just couldn't handle
the TB withdrawal.

47
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,875
Escaped the hallucinations
by taking the easy way out.

48
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,041
[BODYGUARD] Boss. Guy from the
Monroe family's here to see you.

Whoa, that's a lot!

Gotta love Uncle Danny.

smell like blood?

Yeah, sorry about that.

Tch. Useless idiots.

Twilights turn on each other?

o' the anti-Twilights.

[LORETTA] I think it's clear

00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,750
this wasn't something you chose
to do of your own free will.

86

I was your target, wasn't I?

the position you're in. I do.

could've just gone after me,

you made the mistake
of attacking my men

who depend on me.

I wanna know who
put you up to this.

I'll let you go.

up in the head.

way to defend yourself.

I'll help you out the
back way. All right?

I'm sure.

161
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:36,000
You don't have to worry
about me. Okay?

162
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,125
[GALAHAD] The little shit's
not wearin' tags.

163
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,833
If he is a Twilight, he's
gotta be high enough ranked

164
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,166
that the government's runnin'
surveillance on him.

165
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,708
There's just no way
he doesn't know

166
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,541
we're part of the Four Families.

167
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,166
Unless he's a hunter...

168
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,000
[MIKHAIL]
Hey!

169
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,708
You better gimme
back those tags!

170
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,500
Or it'll be your fault
when I get in trouble

171
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:58,583
for not havin' 'em!

172
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,375
I can't do that, kid.

173
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:03,083
They belong to the
Cristianos, not you.

174
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,250
Only thing you're
gettin' is a beat down.

175
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,416
Tch.

176
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,208
I never wanted
those ones anyway.

177
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,916
So instead, what
if I take yours?

178
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,125
[MARCO]
Just as I thought.

179
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,166
His power level's the same
as Galahad's, if not higher.

180
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,166
[MARCO] And there's no
question he's faster.

181
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,791
He's dangerous. Yet on the
inside, still just a kid.

182
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,208
[GALAHAD]
All right, runt!

183
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:32,958
Play time's over.
Now we fight like men!

184
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,541
[GALAHAD yells]

185
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,458
[GALAHAD]
Nice, Marco!

186
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,083
Sweet moves there, bro.

187
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,708
[MARCO] Gal, go to the
storehouse and bring back

188
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,625
as many downers
as you can carry.

189
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,500
[ERICA]
Are you done playing, Mikhail?

190
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:53,666
[BOTH]
Huh?

191
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,875
[GALAHAD]
Hang on.

192
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,000
I've seen this girl before.

193
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,708
[MIKHAIL]
Hey, guess what?

194
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,833
I found some guys who
can put up a fight.

195
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:18,041
But then they stole my tag
collection and did this to me.

196
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:21,291
I need your help, Erica. Please!

197
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,833
[ERICA]
Indeed.

198
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,083
Aw, crap.

199
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,500
[GALAHAD]
Keep your head down!

200
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,625
Galahad!

201
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:55,333
[WORICK] Wind's blowin'
outta the southwest.

202
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,791
[gasps]

203
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,375
[MIKHAIL]
Huh?

204
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,333
Wait, this isn't a tag.

205
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,541
Hey, Erica, this guy's a Normal.

206
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,250
His blood doesn't smell
like a Twilight's.

207
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,750
Get your filthy hands off
a that, you little shit!

208
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,333
You messed up my shirt.

209
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,583
[GALAHAD]
Hey.

210
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,000
Hey, what the hell
are you doin'?

211
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,208
Drop it!

212
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,833
Back away!

213
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,916
I swear, if you touch so much
as a hair on that man's head,

214
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,125
I'll blow your brains out!

215
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,458
[MARCO]
Boss! Don't do this!

216
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,708
Run!

217
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,083
[YANG]
Yo, Delico.

218
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,708
The boss says we're all
goin' to dinner together.

219
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,416
We'll swing by the director's
place on the way back.

220
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,375
While we're at it, we can
drop in on everyone and...

221
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,833
Hey, Delico, you
listenin' to me?

222
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,375
[NICOLAS]
She's the spittin' image.

223
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:22,125
'Cept both her eyes are blue.

224
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,833
[NICOLAS] But she's
gutsier than her brother.

225
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,500
Girl's got skills.

226
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:33,291
When Chad finds out
about this, he's gonna flip.

227
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,375
Come on, man, this is nuts.

228
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:41,833
Admit it, Brown. This chick is
way too much for you to handle.

229
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,666
Give it up, faker!

230
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,833
Faker?

231
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,458
Try it all you want,
you're no match for her!

232
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,083
[NICOLAS]
Ha, ha.

233
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,291
Your funeral.

234
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,083
[LORETTA]
Gal!

235
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,416
Let Nicolas take
over here for now.

236
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,208
Come give me a hand!

237
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,291
[GALAHAD]
Hey.

238
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,333
[GALAHAD]
Miss Benedetto, let's go.

239
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,458
Yeah, but...

240
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,375
Careful, Nicolas.

241
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,250
[MIKHAIL]
Hey, stop!

242
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,666
There's no running away!

243
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,833
That door was
custom-made for us.

244
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,875
[WORICK]
The hell happened here?

245
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,375
Jeez, are these all Twilights?

246
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,458
[WORICK]
There's no blood on it.

247
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,250
Dammit, that can
only mean one thing.

248
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,625
Nic freakin' overdosed again.

249
00:16:57,541 --> 00:17:00,666
[WORICK]
Delly? No, it can't be.

250
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,916
But then, that means
it has to be...

251
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,875
[WORICK]
Erica? Fuck.

252
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,750
[GALAHAD] Sorry you got
dragged into all this.

253
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,625
Just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

254
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:25,000
So, um, what did you
mean by "faker"?

255
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,833
Is Nicolas not,

256
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:31,708
I dunno, somehow not
like other Twilights?

257
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,250
Know how they assign
Twilight ranks?

258
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,750
Strictly by physical ability.

259
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,416
Meaning, as you win more
battles and get stronger,

260
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,708
your rank increases.

261
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,708
But Nic cheats the system.

262
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:49,291
He uses Celebrer like athletes
use performance-enhancers,

263
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:52,083
temporarily boosting his
strength to the limit.

264
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,750
Then he challenges higher
ranked Tags, beats 'em,

265
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:58,541
and goes his merry way
up the ladder.

266
00:17:58,625 --> 00:17:59,958
All things bein' equal,

267
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:03,625
he should prob'ly be
about a B/5, at best.

268
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:12,000
[GALAHAD]
So in my book, he's a faker.

269
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,333
[gasps]

270
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,875
[DOUG]
Damn, Ginger.

271
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,125
I know it's an emergency,

272
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,083
but why you have to
run so fast, girl?

273
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:48,750
[WORICK]
Bravo, gang! Perfect timing!

274
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,250
My gamble paid off.

275
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,708
I knew if the Guild saw my
flare, Gina would send backup.

276
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,000
[gasps]

277
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,791
[MIKHAIL]
An S/5?

278
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:02,250
I've seen your face
before, haven't I?

279
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,583
[WORICK] Well that's unnerving.
Didn't even see her.

280
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,583
How'd she move so fast?

281
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,791
'Specially with that rack.

283
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:21,000
I see you went all-in on the
Twilight's Little Helper again.

284
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,416
What the hell're you
doin' to yourself?

285
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,833
[WORICK] Oh! You bought me
five minutes! Big deal!

286
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,416
Ya sawed-off little junkie!

287
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,791
So I broke my suspension
to rush over here,

288
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:37,416
and right off the bat, I gotta
deal with Mr. Deaf Ninja again.

289
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:39,791
[NICOLAS]
Uh...

290
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,166
[DOUG]
You don't remember me?!

291
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,375
We had a huge...

292

Their friends are from
the Paulklee Guild.

293
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,666
Whadda we do now, Erica?

[CHAD]
Our two suspects

00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,791
and the head of the Cristiano's
are still inside!

297
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,708
Cover the back exits!

298
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:01,291
I want all other men out front
searchin' for survivors.

299

Wha--?

[POLICEMAN A]
Are those Tags?

301
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,541
[POLICEMAN B]
They're traveling by rooftop!

302
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,916
[CODY] We gotta move now!
Before we lose 'em!

Stay sharp!

305
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:23,708
[LORETTA] Hey, Marco. Do you
think I made a mistake?

306
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,333
Sorry, Boss.

307
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,208
All that matters is if
you think you made one.

308

Stupid question, I know.

You wanna try explainin' to me
what happened here tonight?

00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,250
[WORICK]
Yeah, sure.

312
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,083
But before that, I need
to use your phone.

313
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,666
Gotta call Monroe.

314
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:03,083
Actually, Delico's the one
I really need to talk to.

[MIKHAIL laughing]

Yeah, we had some interference.

00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,458
But we definitely
gave the Twilights

318
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,625
a violent wake-up call.

319
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,791
The flare. I know, I know.

320
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,458
It's how they signaled
the Guild to ride in

321
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:22,041
like the friggin' cavalry.

322
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,458
There was also a certain
ash-blond Normal

323
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,750
sportin' an eye patch
on the scene.

324
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:30,041
Ya know who I mean, right?

325
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,958
O'course, no problem.

326
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,041
[STRIKER] I told ya that quiet
chick and the psycho kid

327
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,500
couldn't do it, Uranos.

328
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,500
Now that you've
got us on your side,

329
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,458
you should drop the dead weight.

330
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:44,708
[SIG] Hey, Mr. C, when's
the last guy gettin' here?

331
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:45,916
I'm not waitin' around,

332
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,666
wasting my whole night
for some stranger.

333
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,250
[MAN]
I'm right here.

334
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,625
I'm glad you made it
in one piece.

335
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,833
You have any luck finding
your missing sister?

336
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,625
No, sir.

337
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,541
[CORSICA]
Well, in any case.

338
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,625
I'm glad we're all finally here.

339
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:08,541
I hope you enjoy your
new life in Ergastulum.

340
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:12,041
Emilio Benedetto.

341
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:16,166
The Destroyers extends
its warmest welcome.
