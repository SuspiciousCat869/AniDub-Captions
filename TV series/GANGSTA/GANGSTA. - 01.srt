00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:48,291
[BARRY] Damn, girl.
You're short again.

2
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:52,916
Heh. You are one useless
bitch you know that?

3
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,625
Why don't you try bringin' in
some real money for a change?

4
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:00,125
Hey! The fuck you lookin' at?

[phone ringing]

7
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,916
[BARRY] I know that
sweet little ass of yours

8
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,916
can earn more than this!

9
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,125
[BARRY]
You hear what I said?

10
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,250
[slap]

11
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:19,958
[BARRY] You don't like
gettin' smacked around,

12
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,666
you'll find some
more johns, you get me?

13
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,208
Get me?!

14
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:28,000
Now don't you go running
off on me, Alex.

15
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,416
[WORICK]
All right, all right!

16
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:34,541
Too slow.

17
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,708
Same ol', same ol'?

18
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,000
[NICOLAS]
Mm.

19
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,208
[phone ringing]

20
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:49,500
[WORICK sighs]

21
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,708
[WORICK]
Yello.

22
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,583
Thanks for calling,
you've reached the Handymen.

23
00:02:55,666 --> 00:03:00,208
[ALEX humming]

24
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,291
[PUNK B growls]

25
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:10,000
I feel so bad to keep
pesterin' you Handymen.

26
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,625
Here, for your trouble.

27
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:12,833
Thanks.

28
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,416
[WORICK]
You know,

29
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,791
this neighborhood's been
gettin' kinda sketchy lately.

30
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,875
I worry about'cha, Granny.

31
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,541
[JOEL] Nonsense, I'm a
tough old broad. I'll be fine.

32
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,083
Besides, you fellas scare
most of the thugs off.

33
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,416
S'why I like you.

34
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,833
[WORICK chuckles]

35
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,958
[JOEL] Since you're here,
I got another job for ya.

36
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:31,958
[WORICK]
Huh?

37
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,708
Can you boys run
a package for me?

38
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,750
Shouldn't take you too long.

39
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,916
Ah, sorry, Granny,
wish we could,

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,500
but we're supposed to
meet with Chad after this.

41
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:43,500
[JOEL] All right. Well, tell
Inspector Adkins I said hi.

42
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,958
Heh. He'll be thrilled to know
you can still fog a mirror.

43
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,666
[JOEL]
Eh?

44
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,833
[WORICK]
Aw, yeah! Jackpot!

45
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,875
Sweet haul! Not bad
for a minute's work.

46
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,375
Good lord.

47
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,583
Makes me think you're
the real thugs.

48
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,125
Just promise me you
won't pick on the weak.

49
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,541
'Course.

50
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:04,333
[JOHN A]
Ah, shit!

51
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,916
--[slap]
--[ALEX grunts]

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,458
What now?

53
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,125
[JOHN A] Bitch, I ain't payin'
you to bite down on my dick.

54
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,916
Ugh. Screw this.

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,875
Shoulda gone to
the damn brothel.

56
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,958
Found a respectable girl.

57
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,916
Hey, floozy!

58
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:26,416
How many times I gotta tell ya?
This is the off-limits zone!

59
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,916
You shakin' your ass
here hurts my shop.

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,916
Take it someplace else!

61
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,083
She come around often?

62
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,291
Oh, yeah.

63
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,916
Been seeing more and
more unfamiliar faces

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,500
comin' and goin' lately.

65
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,416
They treat this place like it
was their own little playground.

66
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,333
[WORICK]
That so?

67
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,541
[WORICK]
Damn, she is stacked.

68
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,208
[JOEL] She's in with
those idiots there.

69
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,291
I'm telling you,
I've friggin' had it.

70
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,041
All these kids around here now,

71
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:59,083
they don't know the first thing
about the rules of this city.

72
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,250
Sign of the times, I guess.

73
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,500
[MONROE] All right,
if there are no objections,

74
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:22,416
I say we get today's
meeting started.

75
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,208
[MONROE]
Ah, interesting.

76
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,458
[CORSICA]
Hm?

77
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,416
The gang causing so much
trouble in town lately.

78
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,958
Those wouldn't happen to be your
boys now, would they, Corsica?

79
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,208
The ruckus last
week on 7th Street.

80
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:46,000
That was their doing, I believe.

81
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,375
[CORSICA]
Use this to clean up the mess.

82
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,791
And cool it with
the wild accusations.

83
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,125
Yeah. We'll match that.

84
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,041
[chuckles]

85
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,500
Three grand, eh? Very well.

86
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:04,791
Should be more than enough
to set things right.

87
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,000
So, Monroe, who you gonna
hire for the cleanup job?

88
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,875
A neutral party, of course.

89
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,500
[CORSICA]
Neutral?

90
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,500
[MARCO chuckles]

91
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:17,750
[CORSICA]
Hmph.

92
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,625
No one in this godforsaken
town is "neutral."

93
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,041
[MONROE]
Hm.

94
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,875
Forget about it. I'll take care
of all the arrangements.

95
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,083
What, wanna trade?

96
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,500
Yeah right.

97
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,583
[groans]

98
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,375
[WORICK]
Mm! Damn, that's good.

99
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,125
No one makes navarin
like Granny Joel.

100
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,583
[CONSTANCE]
Got that right.

101
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:04,041
So, what 'bout Chad?
S'not nice to make a cop wait.

102
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,083
[WORICK]
Oh, it's fine!

103
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,958
This here is our delivery fee.

104
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,625
And I intend to savor it.

105
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,166
What's with the damage?

106
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,041
Someone gave your place
a good goin' over again.

107
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,250
That from last week?

108
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,833
You noticed, didja?

109
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,291
This town is balls.

110
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,583
Bastards raise hell outside
the shop and steal my guns

111
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:23,916
whenever they can.

112
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,041
[WORICK]
Who are they? Got a name?

113
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,250
Some upstart gang that's
started terrorizing

114
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,833
the whole damn neighborhood.

115
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:34,833
I tried bringing it up to Chad,
but he doesn't seem to care.

116
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,541
I'm at my wit's end here!

117
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:37,916
--[door opens]
--[WORICK] Hm?

118
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,791
[CONSTANCE] Oh, wait!
If I can just tough it out,

119
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:43,291
the Four Fathers'll take care
of 'em eventually, right? Uh!

120
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,375
You dicks! Don't eat it all!

121
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,125

Ugh! Way to just
help yourselves!

They're late.

Those two are always up
to somethin'. Or nothin'.

125

[CODY] Well, Chad,
I'm thinking they stood us up.

126
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,958
We should probably
cut our losses

127
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,333
and head back to the station.

128
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:04,333
There's plenty of other work
piling up on our desks.

129
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,333
And you smoke too much
these days, you know that?

130
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,250
[CHAD]
And you sound like my old lady.

Jeez, Cody, get off my nuts.

the station, make me a criminal.

What naughty cops you are.

136

Skippin' work,
smokin' in alleys.

Hey, don't include me in that!

schedule. You're late.

Sorry, he can't resist.

from us now, buddy?

[PUNK A chuckles]

147
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:57,250
[BARRY] So a guy with one
eye and that puny Asian

148
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,291
beat your asses, and you
think the best response

149
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,500
is to run back here
and cry to me?

150

[PUNK B] Barry--
U-Uh, sir! We're sorry!

Name's Barry Abbot.

153
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:13,000
His little outfit has
stepped up activity recently;

154
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,375
trying to expand their
territory and reach.

155
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:18,708
Even started doing business
in the off-limits zone.

156
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,083
We'd love to take this creep

157
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,375
and his whole crew
down ourselves, but...

158
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,125
[WORICK] Too much pressure
coming from above

159
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,958
and your hands are tied.

160
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,125
Sounds like a certain someone
who loves making trouble

161
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,125
is pulling the
strings again, huh?

162
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,166
[CHAD]
Exactly.

163
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,958
Which is why I'm
asking you clowns

164
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,916
to deal with Abbot's operation.

165
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,166
How many men?

166
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,041
[CHAD] Depends on when
and where you hit 'em.

167
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:41,625
But I'd guess, long as you avoid
their hangout, no more than ten.

168
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,375
Thirty-five hundred. You in?

169
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,458
[WORICK]
Huh.

170
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,833
Well, not sure.
That seems a bit lower

171
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,750
than our usual cleanup fee.

172
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,375
Hm. What do we
do about the girl?

173
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,916
[CHAD]
I said the whole crew.

174
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,375
How come? Ya know this broad?

175
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:57,750
[WORICK]
Nah, nah.

176
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,000
It's just... can't the
police keep her safe?

177
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,541
Like protective custody, or...?

178
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,000
Buddy, you're gettin' soft.

179
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,333
Don'tcha realize how many
women and children like her

180
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,708
live in this city?

181
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,083
There's no end to 'em.

182
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,500
[sighs]

183
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,208
We can't be playin' favorites.

184
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:15,083
Gotta keep things neutral
to protect ourselves.

185
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:18,250
Start giving special treatment,
n' we piss off the Four Fathers.

186
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,208
Then it'll be our
heads that roll.

187
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:23,125
[WORICK] Eh. Yeah I get it,
but killing a woman?

188
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,541
That is such a downer.

189
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,916
If you don't want the gig,
better tell me now.

190
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,666
It's fine, we need the cash.

191
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,708
[CHAD]
You're a child.

192
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:32,750
Huh?

193
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,541
[WORICK]
Oh.

194
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,458
He's askin' if you're cool
with us keepin' a trophy.

195
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:41,000
Yeah, all right. That's fine.

196
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:44,125
Just don't take anything
anyone can ID.

197
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,208
[WORICK]
Don't worry.

198
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,250
Won't be anything
that'll be missed.

199
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,125
Yeah. What about the bodies?

200
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:54,083
Nope. This time, we'll
take care of disposal.

201
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:57,250
You guys just focus on
doin' what you do best.

202
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,625
[NICOLAS]
Mmm.

203
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,541
[CHAD]
Then it's a deal.

204
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,208
I'll give you the rest
when you're done.

205
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,333
[WORICK]
Right.

206
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,750
[CHAD]
Hey!

207
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,083
This is the biggest
job in a while,

208
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:15,875
so give it to 'em good
and hard, Handymen.

209
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,791
[BOTH chuckle]

210
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,458
[WORICK]
Roger that.

211
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:27,458
[BARRY grunting]

212
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,750
[CODY]
So, um. Is Nicolas, you know...?

213
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,125
[CHAD]
What? You just now noticed?

214
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,125
Some detective you are, kid.

215
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,583
[CODY]
Hmm.

216
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:06,333
I guess... I just figured
he wasn't much of a talker.

217
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:09,208
Ya gotta watch your ass
around that guy.

218
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,916
Yeah, his hearing
may be for shit,

219
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,375
but his eyes are
as sharp as hell.

220
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,791
So if you got something
private to say,

221
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,375
you better cover your lips

222
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:24,958
or else he's gonna know every
damn word outta your mouth.

223
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,708
[BARRY] Spread this around
the off-limits zone.

224
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,958
We'll take the rest
over to District Three.

225
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,208
[CAPO A]
Hey, Barry.

226
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,500
What gives? You takin'
orders from Corsica now?

227
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,500
You know well as I do District
Three is Monroe family turf.

228
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:40,875
That's the point.

229
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,333
We're gonna snatch
that territory

230
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,875
out from under their feet.

231
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,083
Once the Monroes fall,

232
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,416
the Cristianos collapse
right alongside 'em.

233
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,458
[CAPO A] Then the Corsicans
after that, huh?

234
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,833
Get ready, boys. With those
crews outta the picture,

235
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,333
Ergastulum will be ours.

236
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,041
[CAPO A]
Like the sound of that!

237
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,666
[THUGS laughing]

238
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,125
Yo.

239
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,500
[ALEX]
So yeah.

240
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,125
Can't avoid ya today,
huh, Handyman?

241
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,291
Yeah, it's funny.

242
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,708
We don't usually see
each other's faces,

243
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,416
'cept through the window.

244
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,708
Been seein' you around
here for a few months,

245
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:29,500
but I never heard your
voice till just now.

246
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:33,291
[ALEX] I'm sorry.
I, uh, got this kinda dirty.

247
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,916
No bigs; it's not mine.

248
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,291
[ALEX]
The other guy's, then?

249
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,791
Yep.

250
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:42,958
[ALEX]
Oh. Please tell him I say...

251
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,666
No way. Y'know sign language?

252
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,541
[ALEX] Just from watching you.
That's about all I know, though.

253
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,750
[chuckles]

254
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,333
[WORICK]
Why are you with that asshole?

255
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,541
[ALEX]
Got nowhere else to go.

256
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,750
Sucks, right?

257
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,583
You should leave.
He'll be pissed at me.

258
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,750
[WORICK sighs]

259
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,958
[WORICK]
Hey.

260
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,583
Hate to break it to ya,

261
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,458
but Barry's not comin'
'round here no more.

262
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:17,625
[ALEX]
Huh?

263
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,250
Barry?

264
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,333
A damn Tag?

265
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,458
[BARRY]
Shit!

266
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,791
What the fuck's
a Tag doing here?

267
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,333
[CAPO A]
No good! It's a dead end.

268
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,791
Barry, this is fucked.
There's no way out!

269
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,041
Don't move! Don't you dare move!

270
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,875
Wait, hang on! Stand down!

271
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,291
I really don't feel like
takin' on a Tag today.

272
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,875
Tell me who hired you and
how much they're payin'.

273
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:41,875
Whatever it is, man,
I'll double it, I swear!

274
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,625
Hey. You listening to me?

275
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,375
[inaudible]

276
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,208
Shifty move you
pulled there, Nic.

277
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,125
Starting without me like that.

278
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,500
Y'know, I coulda sworn
I told your ass

279
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:08,041
to sit tight till I got back.

280
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,250
Hold up.

281
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,750
You're the one who made
me go after the girl

282
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,250
in the first place
'cause you didn't wanna.

283
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,291
She said thank you
for the hankie.

284
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,250
Uh?

285
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,500
[BARRY groans]

286
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:27,083
Sorry. Guess my aim is
just a little bit off today.

287
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,666
But it'll only hurt
for a minute.

288
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,333
So grit your teeth
and bear it, will ya?

289
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:36,541
[BARRY screaming]

290
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:45,291
[BARRY groaning]

291
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:53,666
[WORICK] Hey, easy, Nicolas.
No need to be cruel.

292
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,666
I'll feel bad if
he suffers too much.

293
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,125
[BARRY]
Hey, gimme a second.

294
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:57,791
[WORICK]
Hm?

295
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:58,916
The hot girl.

296
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,458
You're looking for
the brunette, right?

297
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,458
Take her. She's all yours!

298
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,750
And drugs.

299
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:09,000
You can go ahead and
take the whole stash, too.

300
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,666
If that's not enough,
I have money!

301
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,000
Lemme fill you in on
what's really goin' down.

302
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,250
Idiots who get rich
breaking the law,

303
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:19,083
scumbags who get off
hurting women,

304
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:23,250
those are the kind
of guys... that we love.

305
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:27,416
Love... to death.

306
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,541
[WORICK]
You fall into both categories.

307
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,791
Your folks must'a been proud.

308
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,166
[BARRY]
Please, no--!

309
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,250
[gunshot]

310
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,541
You came.

311
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,166
Thought you'da make
tracks outta town.

312
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:19,375
Damn you. You took
it all away from me.

313
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,875
Now what the hell
am I supposed to do?

314
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:27,291
[ALEX] I was finally ready...
to stop fighting it.

315
00:18:55,125 --> 00:19:01,083
[ALEX crying]

316
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:16,916
[crying continues]

317
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,250
[WORICK]
Mh-hm.

318
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,791
[growls] Nico!

319
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,625
[ALEX crying]

320
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,958
[CHAD sighs]

321
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,583
[WORICK]
Hey, hey! Chad-ster!

322
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:48,000
Oh, hey. You're actually
on time for once.

323
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,791
[CHAD]
Aw, what the hell, Worick?

324
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,958
Please tell me this a joke.

325
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,833
That better not be the
girl from the picture.

326
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,583
Translate?

327
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,375
[WORICK] You told us we were
allowed to take a souvenir

328
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,916
from the job.

329
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,625
Well, I'd like you to meet...
Alex, our shiny new trophy.

330
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,208
I don't think this violates
the spirit of our deal.

331
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:17,333
What? No! Urgh! I am so sick
of you two dickin' me around!

332
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,416
[WORICK] Oh, relax.
There ain't no harm done.

333
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,833
[CHAD]
Yes there is!

334
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,458
The mafia won't turn a blind eye

335
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,625
to you helpin' one
of their damn runaways!

336
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,916
[CODY yelps]

337
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,875
[NICOLAS growls]

338
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,791
[NICOLAS]
What a pain.

339
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,916
Sure, Chad, we may be
indebted to you and the kid.

340
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,208
I get it.

341
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:43,791
But we don't take
orders from you!

342
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:47,625
I don't want you getting
the wrong idea. All right?

343
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,708
To take, one must first give.

344
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:54,000
If you don't let me and Worick
have what we want for once,

345
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:58,000
I worry the next head I separate
from a body might be yours.

346
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,500
Intense, am I right?

347
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,916
So you gonna let us
keep her, Chad, or what?

348
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,291
[growls]

349
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:06,250
Ah, fine. Do whatever
the hell you want with her.

350
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,416
Friggin' hate workin' with Tags.

351
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,208
Here's the rest o'
your money. Take it!

352
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,833
Wait you're... a Tag?

353
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,750
Pleasure doin' business with ya.

354
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,833
I'll buy ya dinner sometime.

355
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,333
[CHAD]
Tch.

356
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,208
I swear, those guys are more
trouble than they're worth.

357
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,625
Take me back to the station.

358
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:27,750
[CODY]
Oh, right!

359
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,583
[CHAD]
You got paperwork!

360
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:50,125
[WORICK]
Hey! Alex!

361
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:55,000
Down there again? How's tricks?

362
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,333
I gotta go do
a thing at a place.

363
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,250
Can you help out in here?

364
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,000
[ALEX]
Hmm?

365
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,375
Doin' what?

366
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,833
[phone rings]

367
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,166
[ALEX]
Hello.

368
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,958
Thank you for calling.
You've reached the Handymen.
