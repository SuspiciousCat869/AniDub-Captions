1
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:58,208
[YANG] You're really
going to look for Erica?

2
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,791
Acting without permission is--

3
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,500
[DELICO]
I know.

4
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,583
[YANG] Not even you
can get away with this.

5
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,000
Miles and the boss
are gonna be pissed.

6
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:10,625
[DELICO] Yeah, I'll take
my licks when I get back.

7
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:12,583
Tell 'em whatever you want.

8
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:16,791
[YANG]
Okay.

9
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,708
[YANG]
Well, shall we get goin'?

10
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,416
[DELICO]
No, I can't let you.

11
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,666
This is my problem,
Yang. It doesn't conc--

12
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,458
Yeah sure, it's not my problem.
Doesn't concern me.

13
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,666
You know, I may not
be your blood relative,

14
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,000
or even one of your
fellow Twilights,

15
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,458
but I will always
be your brother.

16
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,541
[YANG] So don't think for a
second you're the only one

17
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:46,000
who feels guilty about not being
able to protect Erica that day.

18
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,791
Besides, you're too much
of a softie, Delico.

19
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,083
If you go it alone,

20
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,750
you'll just cower at
the first sign of trouble,

21
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,291
and then you'll whimper
your way back here

22
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,583
with your tail
between your legs.

23
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,250
[DELICO]
Yeah. Sorry.

24
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:07,416
I swear I'll make it up
to you somehow.

25
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,458
[YANG]
All right.

26
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,833
Then how about
for the next year,

27
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,208
you gimme like,
half of your earnings.

28
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,166
That seems like a pretty
fair deal, don't it?

29
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,791
[DELICO]
Huh?

30
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,583
[YANG]
Dude. Kidding.

31
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:18,916
[DELICO]
Dick.

32
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:46,166
Diego. Miles. Hey. I, um...

33
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,833
We were just--

34
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,125
[MILES]
We'll expect a nice souvenir.

35
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,833
Yeah, somethin' real
nice and fancy.

36
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,333
[BOTH]
Sure thing!

37
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,583
[LORETTA]
Yes, that's right.

38
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,916
Really? Thank you!

39
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,958
[LORETTA]
Alex!

40
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,666
That was the director
of the orphanage just now.

41
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,458
He said that they've agreed
to take this little guy in!

42
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,583
[ALEX]
What? Really?

43
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,166
[LORETTA] Word was,
they had too many kids

44
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,291
and not enough room,
but apparently,

45
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:26,083
they found some foster
parents yesterday.

46
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,083
[ALEX]
Oh, that's great news!

47
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:33,375
Everything's okay now. You won't
be lonely. Right, Emilio?

48
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,291
[crying]

49
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,875
Wait, what'd you call him?

50
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,666
You know the kid's name
is Louis, right?

51
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,416
You okay?

52
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,458
[LORETTA]
Alex! What's the matter?

53
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:58,916
[ALEX]
I-I can remember... Emilio.

54
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,291
Shit!

55
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,125
We're screwed now.

56
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:15,250
Those smoke bombs'll mask
the scent of any Normals.

57
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:18,125
They know us. How we function.

58
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:21,875
They're legit hunters.
Like with a capital "h."

59
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,875
[DOUG]
I gotta go warn Chad.

60
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:27,291
If this keeps up,
then we're all dead!

61
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,666
[SIG]
Aw, lame.

62
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,166
I heard you guys
were mercenaries,

63
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,666
so I was hopin' you'd be, like,

64
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,375
some tough, jacked-up dudes
who could kick a little ass.

65
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,958
But you losers ain't shit.

66
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,875
[MARCO] Looks good.
We'll take these and the usual.

67
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,125
[CONSTANCE]
Cool deal.

68
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:21,708
But when can I expect
the rest of my payment?

69
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:24,625
Girl's gotta eat, Mr. Adriano.

70
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,250
[CONSTANCE]
How's your arm?

71
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,333
[MARCO]
A little better.

72
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,250
[CONSTANCE]
Well, don't do anything crazy.

73
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:43,166
[MARCO] Tch. You be careful
too heading back.

74
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,500
Side streets can be--

75
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:48,083
[CONSTANCE] I know.
I'll stick to the main drag.

76
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,791
[MARCO]
Tell your nanna I say "Hi."

77
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,333
[CONSTANCE]
Will do.

78
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,333
[CONSTANCE]
Hey, Marco.

79
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:08,958
[MARCO] Great. The Handymen
are rubbin' off on her.

80
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,708
[STRIKER]
What's the word, Beretta?

81
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,125
[BERETTA] Sig and Colt should be
reaching the Guild by now

82
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,083
for a showdown with Paulklee.

83
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,833
Although that
new kid's with 'em.

84
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:30,041
Are you sure we can
trust this Emilio?

85
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,208
[STRIKER]
No, but it wasn't my call.

86
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:35,333
Old Man Uranos brought him in.

87
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,875
[BERETTA] Well, Striker,
onto more important matters.

88
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,041
Where're the tobacco
shops around here?

89
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,375
I'm out and I've been
all over this place,

90
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:45,041
but I haven't seen
a single damn one.

91
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:48,083
[STRIKER] I dunno.
Haven't been lookin', though.

92
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,250
[BERETTA]
You sound busy.

93
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,875
Sorry to bug you.
I'll let you go.

94
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,041
[STRIKER]
What?

95
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:58,541
No, no. I was just
killin' some time.

96
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,375
[BERETTA] Well, if you're
lookin' for something to do,

97
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,500
go catch up with Sig
and the others.

98
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,708
[STRIKER] Aw, she always makes
such a mess when she works.

99
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,000
I end up ruining my clothes.

100
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,041
Mom, look!

101
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,583
[PASSERBY A]
That's a lotta smoke.

102
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:12,208
[BERETTA] I am so gonna
tell her you said that.

103
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,458
[STRIKER] Whatever. It's too
early for a full-on rendezvous.

104
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,750
Besides, I'm not
quite done here.

105
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,500
I got one more bit
o' time to kill.

106
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,916
Right. Sounds good.

107
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,708
Alex?

108
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:44,416
Hey, sorry to wake you.
I'm needed at the Club.

109
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,916
So anyway, I wanna
hear you sing again.

110
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,333
[STALL KEEPER]
Hmm.

111
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:02,083
Sorry, pal, ain't seen
no broad like that.

112
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,708
'Kay. Thank you
for your time, sir.

113
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,291
[YANG]
You see that motorcade?

114
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,541
I think it was Miss Cristiano.

115
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,500
Guess she got the all-clear
to leave the Handymen's

116
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,500
and head back to Bastard.

117
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:27,083
[DELICO] Whatever's goin'
down over at the Guild,

118
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,708
it's gettin' ugly.

119
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:32,208
Just hope the mess doesn't
spill over onto the boss.

120
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,875
Aw, he doesn't have
a thing to worry about.

121
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,125
He's got Miles and the other
boys for his security detail.

122
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,666
Plus Ricky and Nic
in his back pocket.

123
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,833
On the other hand,
if we don't find Erica

124
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,666
and she and her little sidekick
get to the boss first,

125
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,750
then we're all in trouble.

126
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,291
[laughs]

127
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,750
[TWILIGHT G yelling]

128
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:33,291
[DOUG retching]

129
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,416
This way! Hurry!

130
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,708
Sir?

131
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,125
[PAULKLEE]
Status report?

132
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,583
Intruders, ma'am.
We count three.

133
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,875
Smoke's cloggin'
our noses and eyes.

134
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,291
Though judging by their finesse,

135
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:36,875
it's clear we're dealing
with skilled hunters.

136
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,041
Our guys down there
are holdin' 'em off,

137
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,083
but it's only a matter of time
till they make it here.

138
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,000
[GINGER]
Sir?

139
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,458
Nah. Ain't never seen
this girl around here.

140
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:09,958
Hey, buddy, ya know, ya look
a lot like her. You two twins?

141
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:13,541
No, she's younger
than me by two years.

142
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,666
[DELICO]
Do we really look like twins?

143
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:22,500
[YANG] Oh, it's just 'cause
you're so petite. Even now.

144
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,000
[DELICO] Well, I'm still
bigger than Nicolas.

145
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,500
[YANG]
Yeah sure, who isn't?

146
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:30,125
You got about three
centimeters on him, at least.

147
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,125
Okay, maybe that's
stretchin' it a bit.

148
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,583
[DELICO]
Oh, shut up.

149
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,291
[YANG]
So what do we do now?

150
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,458
[DELICO]
It was dark,

151
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:44,083
so there probably
weren't many witnesses.

152
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,958
We're this far away.

153
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:49,458
Detective Adkins saw her leap
to the District Nine side.

154
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:52,625
So the only direction
she woulda gone is north.

155
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,166
Well, assuming she's still
headin' toward the north,

156
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,375
District Seven's a safe bet.

157
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,791
District Three's our
home turf, after all.

158
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,666
And besides, District Nine's
got the main road

159
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,958
and too many prying eyes.

160
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,041
[GALAHAD]
Ms. Raveau!

161
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,500
Oh, Galahad.

162
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,916
[GALAHAD] You all right?
Have you been hurt?

163
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,375
No, no, I'm fine, but forget me.

164
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,791
[JOEL] Did all we could
for the poor souls,

165
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:30,125
but their injuries
were just too severe.

166
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,833
What the hell's going on?

167
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,500
I mean, first it was
Loretta's place,

168
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,791
and now your colony gets hit.

169
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,416
It's almost as if--

170
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,208
Go on. Get back to
District Seven right away.

171
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:50,083
Find Constance and take
her to the Handymen's.

172
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:53,125
Yo, Normals! It's too
dangerous for you here!

173
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,125
Get as far away as you can!

174
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,958
And if you see any injured Tags,
just leave 'em there!

175
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,583
You do not wanna get
dragged into this mess!

176
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:03,083
Well, what are you waitin' for?

177
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,541
[JOEL]
Hang on! Gal, wait!

178
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,166
[PASSERBY C]
Ma'am, you can't stay here!

179
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,291
Come on, let's go! Hurry!

180
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,875
[SIG laughing]

181
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,166
[SIG]
Ah, you finally show your face.

182
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:28,791
So nice to meet you.
You crusty old bitch.

183
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,750
[SIG]
Well, what do you know?

184
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,916
There is someone here
with some talent.

185
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,791
Been a while since
I've seen anyone fend off

186
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,416
one of Colt's attacks.

187
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,958
[PAULKLEE] You sure have made
a hell of a mess, haven't you?

188
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:49,583
[SIG] You know, you might wanna
show the least bit o' gratitude.

189
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,333
I did just clean up this
huge pile 'a shit for ya.

190
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,333
Tris. Status report.

191
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,958
These people are highly skilled.

192
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:59,958
About half of the guardsmen
have now been eliminated.

193
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:03,708
I'm working up repair estimates.
Need another day.

194
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,625
My head already hurts.

195
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,416
[HAUSEN]
What's the call?

196
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,375
[PAULKLEE]
Well, I'm going back to sleep.

197
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,791
You take it from here.

198
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,791
Yes, ma'am.

199
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,375
What?

200
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,833
You're gonna sit this fight out
and just watch from a distance?

201
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,875
Queen of the roost is
just another chicken?

202
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,250
[PAULKLEE]
Shut the hell up!

203
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:25,458
[PAULKLEE]
This whole damn place is rotten.

204
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,083
You really think I give a crap

205
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,583
'cause you managed to
take out 50 or 100 guys

206
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,875
clingin' to the
side of a cesspool?

207
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,666
I'm done talkin'.
Take care of 'em.

208
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,958
[laughing]

209
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,083
Originally, I only
dropped by to say hi,

210
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,666
but now I've changed my mind.

211
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,083
So bring it! Get down here!

212
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,416
Right now! I wanna kick your--

213
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,291
Emilio, you twit! What the
fuck were you aimin' for?

214
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,666
[EMILIO] You were warned,
Sig. It's too soon.

215
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,958
So back off. Now.

216
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,458
Hey, before you go.
Who the hell are you people?

217
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:12,041
[COLT]
Destroyers.

218
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,625
Third Destroyers.

219
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,416
Agents of Uranos Corsica.

220
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,583
Mr. Adriano.
The rumors are true, sir.

221
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,875
The Paulklee Guild has
become a war zone.

222
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,541
There are two attackers.
Word is they're both hunters.

223
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:28,500
[MARCO]
Mm?

224
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,833
Worse still,

225
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,208
Mr. Galahad's already left
for the Guild on foot.

226
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,208
Wait, describe these hunters.

227
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:37,750
Tall guy. Right? Silver hair?

228
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:41,625
Should have a tattoo.
Tribal symbol on his left arm.

229
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,083
Uh, no.

230
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,583
They said it's a young man
and some crazy girl,

231
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,041
but early reports
are often wrong.

232
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,166
There might be
more than two, sir!

233
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,458
Sir, hold on!

234
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,875
[MARCO]
I'll be right back!

235
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,666
[MARCO] Please let me
be wrong about this.

236
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,416
[PAULKLEE] This'll get a lot
worse before it gets better.

237
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:17,916
[HEATHER]
Hey, let go! Let go, murderer!

238
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,250
What the--?

239
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,500
She killed her. This bitch
killed my sister Abby!

240
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,083
Fuck you!

241
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,291
[YANG]
I see. So your name's Heather?

242
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,583
And you've been out
here looking for her

243
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,166
on your own all this time?

244
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,250
This girl, Erica,

245
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,708
the one who attacked Club
Bastard and killed your sister.

246
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,125
But your poor leg.

247
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:50,666
[HEATHER] I followed her
as far as District Nine.

248
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,125
Then my leg just,
like, stopped working.

249
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,875
By the time I made
it back... Abby was...

250
00:17:56,958 --> 00:18:00,041
Her body was... already cold!

251
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:06,958
She was only six!
I was supposed to protect her!

252
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,666
[DELICO]
Heather.

253
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,208
The woman who killed
your sister is my sister.

254
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:18,333
If we don't find her soon,
she'll keep hurting people,

255
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,541
like she hurt you and Abby.

256
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:21,833
Erica's sick.

257
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,833
She's in a place there's
no coming back from.

258
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,250
It's my duty to stop her.

259
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:30,416
But to do that,
I'm gonna need your help.

260
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,291
[HEATHER]
I'll show you where. Come on.

261
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,041
[explosion]

262
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,416
[GALAHAD]
Sounds far off.

263
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,125
They've already
been through here.

264
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,083
[coughing]

265
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:54,583
[GALAHAD] Burns like a mother.
This ain't ordinary smoke.

266
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,125
What?

267
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,375
Doug, is that you?
Hey, it's Gal!

268
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,666
Yo! Over here, man!

269
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,541
Jeez, what the hell
went on here?

270
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,666
And where'd everyone else g--

271
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,375
[GALAHAD]
Doug!

272
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:14,875
Oh God!

273
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,458
[GALAHAD] Aw, stop it.
Y-You're gonna be fine.

274
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,833
Here, lemme give you
a dose of downer to--

275
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,250
Ga--

276
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:33,916
Ga--

277
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,875
[GALAHAD]
Yeah. I'm still in one piece.

278
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,541
[GALAHAD]
Headquarters, yeah.

279
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:43,666
It's a little scorched,

280
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,000
but nothin' a coat
of paint can't fix.

281
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:52,375
[GALAHAD] Don't be so dramatic.
This is Ergastulum, son.

282
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,500
I'd bet my left nut, Hausen's
already found those hunters

283
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,000
and killed them
with his own hands.

284
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,541
Yeah, Doug. I'll hang onto 'em.

285
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:09,166
Rest of us're prob'ly
right behind ya.

286
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,708
[GALAHAD]
Ya done good, kid.

287
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,166
[CONSTANCE]
Holy crap.

288
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,875
Guess I did hear an
explosion earlier.

289
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,375
Wonder if it's a gas line, or...

290
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:30,958
God. I hope everyone
over there's okay.

291
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,958
[BERETTA]
You gotta be shittin' me.

292
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,750
Spend all day lookin'
for a smoke shop,

293
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:39,833
finally find the one in town,
and it's friggin' closed?

294
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,541
[CONSTANCE]
Sorry!

295
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,375
The shop owner is out
on deliveries right now.

296
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,333
Can you hang right
here for a sec?

297
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,791
I can go inside and get
whatever it is you need.

298
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,333
What? You gonna break in?

299
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,916
Oh, it's fine.

300
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,583
I'm her granddaughter,
she won't mind!

301
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,291
[CONSTANCE]
Haven't seen her around before.

302
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:03,458
[CONSTANCE] Looks like somethin'
big went down at the Colony.

303
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,583
Seen anything about
it on the news?

304
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,333
[BERETTA]
Sorry. I don't watch the news.

305
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:11,041
I run a gun store, so over
the years I've become friends

306
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,125
with a lot of people up there.

307
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,708
I hope they got it
under control.

308
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:17,541
The Guild won't usually
take help from Normals.

309
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,333
Just hard not to worry
with so much smoke.

310
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,791
