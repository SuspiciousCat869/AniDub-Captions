1
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,958
[BARRY]
Come to Ergastulum with me.

2
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:59,708
Alex, I know you
could use the money.

3
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,750
I mean, how else you gonna
support your brother

4
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,833
and old man?

5
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,666
The guys who iced
your mom are there, too.

6
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,041
If we're lucky,
we might find them.

7
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,500
[EMILIO]
Alex, don't go!

8
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,916
[EMILIO]
I don't want you to!

9
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,083
Please don't leave me!

10
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,083
Those monsters.

11
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:30,125
If it wasn't for them,
she'd still be here.

12
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,916
Why can't someone just
kill those goddamn Tags?

13
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,041
[ALEX]
Don't!

14
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:41,500
Stop. No! Don't touch me!
Help, please!

15
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,833
[ALEX]
Why did you save me?

16
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,375
[ALEX]
I need to know!

17
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:10,416
[BARRY] I see you're startin' to
remember what really happened.

18
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,333
[BARRY]
Alex.

19
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,083
More rain.

20
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:56,416
[ALEX] Where're Miss
Cristiano and the baby?

21
00:03:58,541 --> 00:03:59,791
[ALEX]
They left?

22
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,791
[ALEX]
So that wasn't a dream.

23
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,666
Hey, Nicolas.

24
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:16,791
I think... you and I have
met before. A long time ago.

25
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,000
Nicolas.

26
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,583
Oh, um, hey, man.

27
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,958
Oh. You guys're from Bastard.

28
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:41,125
So, Nic, Miss Loretta
needs your help.

29
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,500
Gal's not back yet.

30
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,833
He's helpin' with some
emergency at the Guild.

31
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:48,750
Anyway, the boss wants you to
come stand in as her bodyguard.

32
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:55,625
Also, we've been unable to
locate Constance Raveau.

33
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,291
Because of her relationship

34
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,458
with our assistant
manager, Marco,

35
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,916
we fear someone may have--

36
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,833
We have a car
waiting downstairs.

37
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,708
Please, Nic. It's urgent.

38
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,750
Wait! I'm coming!

39
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,625
It's cold.

40
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,208
[MAN]
Wait, Destroyers? No way.

41
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,000
[CLERK A]
But why are they back now?

42
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,375
I thought they
disbanded years ago.

43
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,708
[JOEL]
Marco!

44
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,750
Ms. Raveau! I--

45
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,291
[growls]

46
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,500
[JOEL]
So are you gonna take her, too?

47
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,875
Are you gonna take my
granddaughter away from me

48
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,208
this time?

49
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,250
What? My son and his wife
weren't enough for you?

50
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,875
I guess you won't be satisfied

51
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,291
until you've taken
everything from me!

52
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,916
You Destroyer bastards!

53
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,041
Do you have any idea
the kind of strength

54
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:58,708
Constance had to muster just
to be with you, you dumb putz?

55
00:06:58,791 --> 00:06:59,458
[LORETTA]
Ma'am!

56
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:00,583
[JOEL]
Son of a bitch!

57
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,458
You promised me, didn't you?

58
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,750
That you would never put me
through that torture again?

59
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,166
And yet now, here we are!

60
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,791
Look at what you've done!

61
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,458
You did this!

62
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,916
Marco.

63
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,916
[JOEL]
With my son and daughter-in-law,

64
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,958
there weren't even any
bodies left to bury.

65
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:49,291
[JOEL] I'm not asking
for a lot here. Really.

66
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,750
I don't care if there's
nothing but a head.

67
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:56,500
Hell, even an ear or an eyeball.
Just some part of her, please.

68
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:01,125
Please, Handyman,
you have to help me.

69
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,708
Just let her...

70
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:06,250
Just let her see that damn fool
one more time. I'm begging you.

71
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,416
Let her see her man.

72
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:19,791
[NICOLAS] Whenever it rains like
this, nothin' good happens.

73
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,416
Never has.

74
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,416
[WORICK]
The District Zero explosion.

75
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,250
That was no accident, was it?

76
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,083
Yeah, about that.

77
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,375
The Destroyers
are makin' a move.

78
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:41,875
Also, Connie is missing.

79
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:45,375
I know, I just found out
about it from Miss Cristiano.

80
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,166
My guess is they're
behind that one, too.

81
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,250
I was under the impression

82
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:52,083
the Destroyers broke
up 15 years ago.

83
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,875
You sure this ain't
just anti-Twilights

84
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,125
bringin' in random hunters?

85
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:59,416
[MILES] You know
Marco's story, don't you?

86
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,833
He's a former hunter who
was once with Vtoroy Esminets.

87
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,666
I doubt his former
brothers-in-arms

88
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,958
were all that happy with
him going to the other side

89
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:11,166
and working for the Cristianos,
protectors of the Twilights.

90
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,791
That's the reason
they took Connie.

91
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,958
A big "fuck you" to Marco.

92
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,333
You can't get squishy
about collateral damage

93
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,250
when trying to corner your prey.

94
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:22,291
As awful as that may sounds.

95
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,875
[WORICK]
You tell Monroe yet?

96
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:27,291
[MILES] Was just about to.
He's in his office with Ivan.

97
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,166
Ivan? Who's that?

98
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,583
[MILES]
Hm?

99
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh, he's the new guy.
You met him before, remember?

100
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,166
He's got a scar over
his right eyebrow.

101
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,875
What, something wrong?

102
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,416
Yeah, maybe.

103
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,166
Who was it delivered the money
to Bastard that night?

104
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,791
'Cause if he was there,
then he coulda done something

105
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,083
before I sent up
that signal flare.

106
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,333
And the same goes for the time

107
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:01,416
when that runt from the Guild,
Doug, attacked you guys.

108
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,416
He was there, too, right?

109
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,333
Up till then, that street
was a secure route.

110
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,833
It had never come
under attack before.

111
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,291
Besides, that route's
so damn complicated,

112
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,583
it makes a crap spot
for an ambush.

113
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,041
If they were just amateurs,

114
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:19,000
you could've given 'em
the slip, no problem.

115
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,666
Instead, they were able
to stay on your ass

116
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,750
and predict your every move.

117
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:24,916
[MILES]
Hm?

118
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,500
[MILES]
Boss!

119
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,791
[phone ringing]

120
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,833
Yeah, Diego? We've got ourselves
situation. I can't talk--

121
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,916
[DIEGO]
Look out the window, Miles.

122
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,500
We've got a
situation of our own.

123
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,625
I know that face.

124
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:03,541
[STRIKER] Knock-knock.
Old Man Monroe home?

125
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,458
[STRIKER]
I wanna say hi.

126
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,208
Over the years, a tiny
percentage of Normals

127
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,958
have been born with
what are best described

128
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,458
as anomalous
physical attributes,

129
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,916
giving them abilities equal to,

130
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
and sometimes greater
than, Twilights'.

131
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,125
Only without any of the toxicity

132
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,666
or dependency caused
by Celebrer use.

133
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,875
You know all that.

134
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:28,958
What you may not know

135
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,750
is most of these
super-powered Normals

136
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,833
were raised to be hunters.

137
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,083
One of 'em in
particular, though,

138
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:40,500
guy called Striker, is even more
brutal than the rest of us.

139
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,541
[MARCO]
It's been 15 years

140
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,333
since the old head of
the Cristiano family,

141
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,000
your father, took me in.

142
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:55,416
But in that time, I've had
it easy. I've gotten soft.

143
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,875
I don't have the strength
to protect my master

144
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,583
like I once had.

145
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,708
Not against him.

146
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:06,250
Let alone the strength
to take back Constance.

147
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:09,541
At least... not anymore.

148
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,125
[LORETTA]
Bring me that outfit.

149
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,708
--Boss! Wait, we're right here!
--Miss Loretta! You can't!

150
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,458
Christ, I don't have cooties.

151
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:23,458
Shouldn't you be used to seeing
half-dressed girls around here?

152
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:26,500
[BODYGUARD] But you're our
boss! It's inappropriate!

153
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,708
Then bring me my
damn clothes already!

154
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:31,625
Come on! She needs clothes!

155
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,708
[LORETTA] Get my
father's old phone book.

156
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,916
Call every last
contact in there.

157
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,916
You get even one solid bit of
solid intel, you bring it to me!

158
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,875
The rest of you, split into
four teams and hit the streets.

159
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,291
Search everywhere.

160
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,500
Back alleys, markets, old
buildings, storage sheds.

161
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,875
Boss. You don't--

162
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,625
[LORETTA] It's important
we move in small numbers,

163
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,958
so the Corsicans
don't catch on, got it?

164
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,375
Boss, wait! Just listen!

165
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:00,416
Don't go. You can't put it on
the line for my personal life!

166
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,958
You're one of the Four Fathers.

167
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,500
You are indispensable
to this city.

168
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,625
You go out there,
trying to be a hero,

169
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,125
and something happens to you?

170
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,916
It won't be just the
family that's hurt.

171
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,583
All those Twilights
whose lives depend--

172
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,916
[LORETTA]
Marco Adriano.

173
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,458
You're an honorable man.

174
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:20,000
You've given everything you
have to the Cristianos.

175
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,541
Now I'm returning the favor.

176
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,041
I'd rather find danger
than let it find me.

177
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,916
[BOTH]
Time for the boss to act!

178
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,166
The Cristiano family
leaves no man behind!

179
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,708
We fight to the end!

180
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,333
[MARCO]
Sir.

181
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,583
Still need a good
bodyguard, though.

182
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,791
[WORICK] We can't take him
without Nic and the others.

183
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,250
Miles, listen.

184
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:54,083
You gotta get outta here.
Don't worry, I'll cover you.

185
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,875
Go 'n' find Monroe.

186
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,291
[WORICK]
Miles?

187
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,541
[MONROE]
Don't come lookin' for me.

188
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,375
I'm goin' to settle
things with my old pals

189
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,375
before this town goes
completely to shit.

190
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:15,125
I can't. I can't go
when he's still here.

191
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:21,416
He'll come to play chess
with me like he always does.

192
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,375
You're not part of this family.

193
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:27,041
You don't have to
stay here. You should go.

194
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,916
[GANG MEMBER C] He's broken
through to the West End stairs!

195
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,833
So what now?

196
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,875
For one, don't panic.

197
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,958
We'll trap and kill him here.
Start by closing the doors.

198
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,583
Call back the guys
on the East Wing stairs.

199
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:46,791
Now.

200
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:47,750
[GANG MEMBER D]
He's here!

201
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:48,958
Close 'em!

202
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,166
[STRIKER] You guys're
makin' me feel unwanted.

203
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,958
C'mon, stop playin' hard to get.

204
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,875
[DIEGO]
Oh shit.

205
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,000
That was a steel
reinforced door.

206
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:10,291
I guess all we'll doing now
is buying time for the boss.

207
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:13,666
Well, as long as the boss
and Miles are safe,

208
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,958
we'll call it "mission
accomplished."

209
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,583
Worick. Get out.

210
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,916
[WORICK] What? Mr. Monroe and I
share the same taste in cologne.

211
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,375
What works on Tags,
works on hunters.

212
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,875
Turn his super-senses
against him.

213
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,541
With this, we'll
overwhelm his nose.

214
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,625
Throw him off a little bit.

215
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:40,666
[WORICK]
I won't ask you your reasons.

216
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,208
You were plannin' to throw
yourself in the fire,

217
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,708
slow Striker down and buy
Monroe some time, right?

218
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,791
Not a fan of leaving you
here like that, Miles.

219
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,291
You're old!

220
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,666
Striker or not, you've already
got one foot in the grave.

221
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,583
[MILES]
Hmph.

222
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:55,833
On the other side of the coin,

223
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,833
you're just barely outta
short pants, son.

224
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,000
If you're scared, feel free
to tuck dick and run to mommy.

225
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,750
But I will gossip.

226
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,958
[WORICK] You don't have
to give me permission.

227
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:10,291
Never wanted to run more.
I'm nearly pissin' myself.

228
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,416
Well, I don't have any
diapers for ya, kid.

229
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,625
And I swear to God,

230
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,041
don't you dare shit
your briefs during this.

231
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,750
Right back at-cha.
I don't do elder care, Pops.

232
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:29,166
[STRIKER] Dude still wears
that nasty-ass toilet water?

233
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,416
He must be losin' his head.

234
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:37,291
[STRIKER] Yo! At least be
a man and show your face!

235
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,791
Not gettin' much of a workout

236
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,833
running through these weak-ass
Normals you call security!

237
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:45,583
You want I should kill
'em all? Huh, Boss-man?

238
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,291
[STRIKER]
The fuck.

239
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,416
[WORICK]
Mil--!

240
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,666
[screams]

241
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,000
Wait. Yeah.

242
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:31,166
Sorry 'bout shoulder-checkin'
ya earlier, man.

243
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,708
[STRIKER]
You're just a Normal, aren'tcha?

244
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,583
Almost had me fooled into
thinkin' you're a Twilight.

245
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,750
Sure as hell got the
stink of 'em on ya.

246
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,250
I got no interest in Normals.

247
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:47,083
Only one I give a damn
about is Old Man Monroe.

248
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,875
[WORICK] Flush all the
Tags out into the open

249
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,750
by wipin' out their
support network.

250
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,833
Thought for sure that's
why he came here,

251
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,500
lookin' to off Monroe, but...

252
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,000
Where is he?

253
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,333
He run away and abandon his men?

254
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:04,166
Damn, that's cold.

255
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,416
And here I came to see
his face after all this time.

256
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,041
[WORICK] Wait a minute, this guy
knows Monroe. Personally.

257
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,666
The hell's this about?

258
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,583
[WORICK] You really think I'd
tell you, just 'cause you asked?

259
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,000
[growls]

260
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,666
Yeah, I'm sorry, pal.

261
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,208
Boss don't have time to waste on
you, ya worthless piece o' shit.

262
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,833
But hey, make
yourself comfortable.

263
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,708
[WORICK]
Friggin' mongrel!

264
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,708
[MILES]
What are you--?

265
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,500
No, don't!

266
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,541
Worick!

267
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:01,958
[gasps]

268
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,125
Nina?

269
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,750
Doctor, it's...

270
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,000
It's Worick.

271
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:25,166
[MIKHAIL humming]

272
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,333
Mikhail. It's time.

273
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,375
Are we going?

274
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,000
[ERICA]
Come on. Wash your hands.

275
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,666
[MIKHAIL]
Okay!

276
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,833
[DELICO] You lost sight
of her around here?

277
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,125
[HEATHER]
Yeah.

278
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:56,333
[YANG] District Six, maybe?
Nah, couldn't be.

279
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:59,625
That's where the Twilight bodies
first started pilin' up.

280
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:08,166
If anything, it's here,
or farther up north.

281
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,666
That is, assuming the Corsica
family was somehow involved.

282
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:16,000
[YANG] Looks like Granny
Joel's stepped out.

283
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:19,541
Heather, what else
is around here?

284
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,416
There's some
vacant houses nearby.

285
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,041
I know where they are.
Follow me.

286
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:47,333
[IVAN] Come on, Mister Monroe,
what's the matter?

287
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,333
Let's get goin'.

288
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,958
The big guy gets upset
when he has to wait.

289
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:57,166
Well, by all means, then.

290
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:08,208
[NICOLAS]
It's no use.

291
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,875
Any of it.

292
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:15,666
[MONROE] Stand down, kid.
This ain't your fight.

293
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,916
[MONROE]
You're not like them.

294
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,375
You're just a weak and
powerless little Normal.

295
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,125
[MONROE]
Getting mixed up in this mess

296
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,333
won't make you into one of 'em.

297
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,791
You'll never be their equal.

298
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,375
No matter how far they come,

299
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:42,750
Twilights will always be beasts
who live only to obey Normal,

300
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,666
and eventually,
die for them too.

301
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:52,500
[MONROE] Wallace, you'll
never be like they are.

302
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:02,375
[WORICK] Well, it's not that
I wanted to be like them.

303
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,833
I mean... fuck.
