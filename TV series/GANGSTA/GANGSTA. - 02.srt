Hm?

00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:58,708
Hey! Jerkass,
watch where you're--

3
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,916
Oh, shit! A Tag!

4
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,541
Uh. Hi?

5
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,083
[NINA]
Whoa! Um.

6
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,375
Wh-Who the heck are you?

7
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:28,750
Where...? Where are
Nico and Worick?

8
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,333
[WORICK]
Is that Nina?

9
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:34,166
Ha! I can tell that
screech anywhere.

10
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,333
Hey, short stuff!

11
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,833
Put some clothes on.
She's a little girl!

12
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,375
[NINA]
I'm so sorry!

13
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:43,125
No! Nina! You got it all wrong!
It's not what it looks like!

Mmm.

16
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:04,083
[WORICK]
Uh, so, Nina.

17
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,375
I'd like you to meet Alex.

18
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,708
Kind of a long story,

19
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,541
but we brought her on
to answer the phone.

20
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,666
Yeah. I'm sorry
if I startled you.

21
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,750
Ah, she'll be fine. So, Ally,

22
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,750
I'd like you to
meet little Nina.

23
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,458
She's one of our regulars.

24
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,666
She works as a nurse
for Doctor Theo.

25
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,333
He's like our...
family physician.

26
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:23,958
She works harder
than most adults,

27
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,000
and she's good at it, too.

28
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:26,916
[ALEX]
Oh, wow.

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,375
Sorry I freaked.

30
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,875
I thought.

31
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,625
Well, I thought you were like,
you know, Worick's, um...

32
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,250
[NINA screams]

00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,458
Nico!

34
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,541
[WORICK]
Oh, hey. You're back.

35
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,166
"While you were out,"
yeah right.

36
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,625
[NINA]
Come on.

37
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,166
You say that every time,

38
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,833
but then you always go buy one
especially for me, too.

39
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,291
Thank you.

[WORICK]
So, Nina,

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,250
now that everyone's met,
and you've gotten your soda,

44
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,791
what brings ya by?

00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,166
[NINA groaning]

46
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,208
[WORICK]
Somethin' tells me

47
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,000
you're not just here
to say "hello."

48
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,125
Wait, let me guess.

49
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,958
Doc pissed off the
wrong tough guy again?

50
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,375
If he was just a regular
gangster thug,

51
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,500
we probably would've
gone to Inspector Adkins

52
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,250
to deal with him.

53
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,416
Yeah, say no more.

54
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,041
This guy's a Tag.

55
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,375
[ALEX]
What is a Tag?

56
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,333
[NICOLAS grunts]

57
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,333
[NINA]
Yeah, definitely.

58
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,291
One of Marco's men
stopped by the clinic,

59
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,541
and he was no match
at all for this guy.

60
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:44,541
He said he was positive this
Tag is a B Rank or higher.

Oh, wait.

Hold on a sec. Nico.

66
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,458
[NINA]
The refill on your meds.

67
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:02,208
Doctor Theo prescribes 'em,
I deliver 'em.

68
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:05,625
He said your supply
should run out soon, right?

69
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:09,000
[ALEX]
Meds? For what?

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,833
[ALEX] Deafness aside,
he looks pretty healthy.

71

Hey, Nic. I'm gonna catch up
with you later, okay?

72
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:22,583
I got a little errand
to go run first.

It is most certainly not okay!

76
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:38,458
You have to stick to
the dosage Doc tells you!

77
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,583
[WORICK]
Hey, uh, Ally?

78
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:51,208
Hate to ask,
but I need a favor.

00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,333

What about that dude she's with?

82
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,250
One with the sword.
Kill him, or...?

83
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,875
[PUNK B]
Kill him.

Hey, boys.

85
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,166
Any a you wanna come
with me, have some fun?

86

Or all of you even.
I'll give you a good rate.

[PUNK A]
Tch. I don't need no whore.

88
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:16,666
Go find a street corner.
We're workin' here.

I've been workin'
this spot for weeks.

91
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:24,166
Just no traffic today.

92
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,666
Come on. Come keep me warm.

93
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,000
You're so strong.

94
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,916
Bitch, I told ya to am-scray!

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,625
We ain't gonna say it again.

101
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,625

That sounded like...

102
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:58,416
[NINA] Very funny, Nico.
You don't hear anything.

103
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:03,208
[NINA] I think those
were maybe... gunshots.

104
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:08,041
[NINA] I'm sure it
was nothing. Let's go.

105
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:11,333
I bet Doctor Theo's gotten
tired of waiting for us.

106
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,458
[THEO] How many times
do I have to tell you?

107
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,875
I'm not interested in
partnering with anybody.

108
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,750
[B/2]
Well that ain't very neighborly.

109
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,083
I mean, you know you're gonna
get a fat stack of bills

110
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,291
if you help our crew, right?

111
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,583
[B/2]
Seems like a waste.

112
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,416
Rottin' away in this run-down
hellhole of a clinic.

113
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,250
Treatin' nasty-ass diseases

114
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,208
for whatever change the street
trash can scrounge up.

115
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:46,250
Don't you think you
deserve better, Doc?

116
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,875
I don't really mind it.

117
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,791
I like my life, and the
squalor suits me fine.

118
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,708
Now if you'll
excuse me, I have--

119
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,000
This girl works
for you, don't she?

120
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:02,583
Nina, I think it is, right?
Cute little cupcake.

121
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:06,375
Can tell she gonna be a fine
piece o' ass soon. No doubt.

122
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,541
My boys are grabbin'
her up as we speak.

123
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,541
Maybe we turn her out early.
Put that ass to work for us.

124
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,416
Yeah, you mean her?

Hey, what's the kid doin' here?

[PUNK F]
Is that a fuckin' samurai sword?

127
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm sorry to bother
you, Handyman.

128
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,625
Where's the other guy?
Playin' hooky today?

00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:30,791

did this happen?

131
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,166
[PUNK F] Uh. Boss,
there's gotta be some--

132
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:39,625
I don't want excuses!

133
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,375
I wanna know why
you shit-for-brains

134
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,666
can't get even the
simplest job right!

135
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,458
[WORICK]
Aw, man.

136
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:59,791
Have to get Chad out here to
dispose of all this garbage.

137
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:03,000
[ALEX] How 'bout a heads-up
next time you go on a rampage?

138
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,583
You ruined my top.

139
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,583
Blood doesn't come out and
I only got like two of these.

140
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,708
Ah, shit. Sorry about that.

141
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,916
I'll buy you some new clothes
later, cool? Something nice.

142
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,750
Still, though,
you're takin' it well.

143
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,541
I mean, most chicks would
be throwin' a damn fit.

144
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,625
[ALEX]
"Taking it well"?

145
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,333
I've been sick to my
stomach ever since.

146
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:28,166
How could I just help someone
murder people like that?

147
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:32,250
[WORICK] Damn. So this
guy was a mercenary, huh?

148
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,250
[ALEX]
Those aren't like Nicolas'.

149
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:43,583
But Nicolas is no
ordinary mercenary, is he?

150
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,875
Well, I guess that would depend

151
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,125
on your definition
of "ordinary,"

152
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:50,333
but he's sure as
hell not like them.

153
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:57,458
Yeah, he's a former mercenary,
but he's a Tag too, see?

154
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:02,541
[B/2] Guessin' my men met
with your good graces.

155
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,500
Eh, Handyman?

156
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,875
Been hearing stories
'bout some weirdo Asian Tag

157
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,458
running 'round
District Eight lately,

158
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,333
stickin' his nose
where it don't belong.

159
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,250
You're shorter than
I thought you'd be.

160
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,291
[NICOLAS grumbles]

161
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,750
S'all good.

162
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,666
Let's do this, my brother.

163
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,458
My boys can thank you
after it's over.

164
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,583
[THEO]
He's ranked B/2, huh?

165
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,250
Seems I was right
to call in Nicolas.

166
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:30,416
Police wouldn't stand a chance
against a guy like him.

167
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:37,416
No specific instructions.
However you see fit.

168
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,333
Just don't leave too big a mess.

169
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:42,166
Hate to cause trouble
for Inspector Adkins.

170
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,666
And of course, make sure Nina

171
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,083
doesn't get so much
as a scratch on her.

172
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:49,000
Screw that part up,
I'll kill ya myself.

173
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,625
[B/2]
S'like a bad cliché.

174
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:59,083
Jackass brought a samurai
sword to a gunfight.

175
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,291
Maybe it's a trick?

176
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,666
Either way, dude's puny as hell.

177
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:08,708
Whatever weapon he packin',
he's still a damn Low.

178
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,083
Prob'ly a D Rank, max.

[B/2]
Huh?

180
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,958
[THEO]
Says you'll last three minutes.

181
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,250
Nina, come here.

[NINA]
Uh, okay.

Stay put, you little brat!

[PUNKS gasp]

185
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,416
Let me 'splain for ya, big guy.

186
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,000
You certainly look
like a decent fighter,

187
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,958
but this guy's totally deaf,

188
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:39,875
and he still wants to
give you a handicap.

189
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,958
So it's safe to say he's gonna
wipe the floor with you.

190
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,916
[B/2]
Asshole!

191
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:01,750
[ALEX]
It's weird.

192
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,458
There are people around,

193
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,708
but we haven't actually passed
anyone directly in a while.

194
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,875
You're not from around
here, are you, Ally?

195
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,250
That obvious?

196
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:14,083
[WORICK] Mostly, I can tell
from the way you talk.

197
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:18,666
But the big giveaway is that
you don't know about Tags.

198
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:23,291
S'okay, though. I was an
outsider here once, too.

199
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,791
[B/2]
Three minutes, huh?

I'll show you!

00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,083
You're playin', right?

You wanna know what's
gonna take three minutes?!

That's how long it'll take me

to turn your face into
friggin' mincemeat!

Go inside and call Inspector
Adkins. Usual drill.

to 've lost my keys.

toying with that creep.

Are you sure?

Right. Yes sir!

Oh, shut up.

If you'd a killed him right
away like you're capable of,

then this never
would've happened!

sell your most valuable organs!

o' friggin' mincemeat.

266
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:08,083
[WORICK]
So yeah. Tags.

267
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:11,875
Ah, cripes. How am I
supposed to explain this?

268
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,333
They're like...

269
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:17,166
Well, this city's also home
to a special breed of man.

270
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,166
Distinct from normal folks
like you and me

271
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,416
in a lotta different ways.

272
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,708
As many ways as there
are names for 'em.

273
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:33,666
There's "Tags."
"Monsters." "Victims."

274
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,083
Fancy guys call 'em the
"legacy of past sins."

275
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,625
There's even a cult
that's sprung up

276
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:43,375
who worships 'em like gods. Heh.

277
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:47,041
They're special, all right,
but not that special.

278
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,833
There's a couple kinds of tags.

279
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,375
Toe tags on a corpse,
for instance.

280
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,916
Identifyin' soldiers who
got killed in battle.

281
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,041
But these dog tags on the
guys we're talking about,

282
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:04,000
they got a whole
different implication.

283
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:04,666
Which is?

284
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,833
[B2 yelling]

285
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,250
[WORICK] Their tags identify
them as something "other".

286
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,833
Acts as a warning, if you will.

287
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,875
[WORICK]
You know, like "Beware of dog."

288

really goin' at it, huh?

Yo! Nic! Nicely done!

00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,875
[B2 groaning]

291
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:41,958
Ugh. Jeez. Think maybe
you took it too far?

292
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,125
What do we do if he kicks it?

293
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,625
[WORICK]
Shit.

294
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,166
I know you guys are built tough,

295
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,666
but that's a lot to
come back from.

296
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,958
[WORICK] He was a
B2, huh? What a waste.

297
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:05,000
Siccin' someone this high-ranked
on a nobody like the doc?

298
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:08,000
Guess one o' the families
has money to burn.

299
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:15,000
[B2 groaning]

300
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,500
[WORICK]
Y'know, like "Beware of dog."

301
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,875
[CHAD]
I've told you guys!

302
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,000
Don't leave me dead
or maimed bodies!

303
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,416
Don't damage buildings!

304
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,875
And if you're gonna
fight with Tags,

305
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,583
do it someplace I
don't have to see it!

306
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,166
Jesus!

307
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,166
Can't even clean your last mess
'fore I gotta deal with another.

308
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,916
Look, man. I said we were sorry.

00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,916
This right here. This is
why your wife left you.

outta this, asshole!

nickel ride in the squad car?

00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,916
[THEO]
Call girl, huh?

315
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,750
[THEO]
Here.

316
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,333
[ALEX]
Huh?

317
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,375
[ALEX]
Uh. What is this?

318
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,708
[NINA]
Doctor Theo!

319
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,083
I just saw Worick and Nico.

320
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:37,083
I gave them the package
like you wanted.

321
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:40,291
[THEO]
Oh, good. Thanks, Nina.

322
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,875
I'm so sorry.

323
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,916
I wish the clinic had somewhere
more comfortable for you to sit.

324
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,083
But how are you feeling
now? Any better?

325
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,291
[ALEX]
Mmm.

326
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,166
Yeah, I'm fine.
But what about you?

327
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:55,375
Are you okay?
With... all of that?

328
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:58,750
I'd be lying if I said
I was totally cool.

329
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:02,208
But that's how it is here.
I'm used to it.

330
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,875
Oh. Well, I envy you that.

331
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,666
Nina, can I ask
you something?

332
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,541
Sure.

333
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,750
Aren't you afraid of
Nicolas? Even a little?

334
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,625
I get why you would ask that.

335
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:25,166
But you're probably just afraid
because you don't know yet.

336
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,916
About Twilights, I mean.

337
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,500
Wait, what are Twilights? I--

338
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,916
[WORICK]
Yo! Ally!

339
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,458
Hey, we should be
headin' back now.

340
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,541
[ALEX]
Oh, yeah.

341
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,208
[NINA]
Alex, wait!

342
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,500
[NINA]
Nico's, um...

343
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,666
Nico's not scary at all.

344
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,875
He's just a grumpy-butt.

345
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,500
All right.

346
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:58,750
We'll be in touch once we
finish with the delivery.

347
00:20:58,833 --> 00:20:59,541
[NINA]
Bye, guys!

348
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,000
[WORICK]
Let's go, Ally.

349
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,625
[ALEX]
Yeah, coming.

350
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,666
[giggles]

351
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,416
[IVAN sighs]

352
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,250
[IVAN] So, you failed
to recruit the doctor?

353
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,166
Yeah. I...

354
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,750
[IVAN] You know, you guys really
are just useless animals.

355
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,208
Absolutely pathetic.

356
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,916
[IVAN] You can call
yourselves "Twilights"

357
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,416
or whatever you want,

358
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,416
wear these stupid collars
around your necks,

359
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,166
but still, you're nothing
more than garbage.

360
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:53,041
[IVAN] Ugh, he makes
me sick. Get rid of him.

361
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,416
[B2 whimpers]

362
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,125
No! Wait! Please, just
give me another shot, okay?

363
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,583
Listen, I swear, I'm not
gonna fail you again!

364
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,833
You don't even have to pay me,
all right? I'm beggin' ya!

365
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,875
[thud]

366
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,458
[IVAN]
Thanks, but no.

367
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:09,250
I got plenty more just
like you in my arsenal.

368
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:16,083
[IVAN] Ergastulum's chock
friggin' full of 'em.
