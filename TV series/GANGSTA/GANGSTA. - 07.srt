1
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,083
I don't get it. What do you
mean you can't save him?

2
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,083
His injuries weren't
that serious.

3
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,083
[DOCTOR]
That's right.

4
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,458
He just has a minor infection.

5
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:08,458
For now, his life's not
in any immediate danger.

6
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:11,250
For now? But...?

7
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,125
[DOCTOR]
More importantly, Wallace,

8
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,208
have you seen your father yet?

9
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,916
Don't change the
subject, Doctor.

10
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,458
[DOCTOR]
They don't live for very long.

11
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,208
It happens rather frequently.

12
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,625
Mercenary groups
or mafia families

13
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:30,916
will often take in Twilights
and use them as slaves.

14
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,083
What do Twilights have to--?

15
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,750
You're wrong.

16
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,375
You're wrong!
It's not true! It can't be!

17
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:44,250
It just... I mean. I've read
all about them in my books!

18
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,958
Twilights are monsters!

19
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,083
They have huge bodies,
and they're all crazy strong!

20
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,500
[DOCTOR]
Wallace.

21
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,666
[WALLACE]
They kill without mercy.

22
00:02:56,708 --> 00:03:00,083
But not Nicolas.
He's not like that!

23
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:03,166
He's not...

24
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,333
He's not a monster.

25
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,916
[DOCTOR]
Let him go.

26
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,416
Just accept it and let him go.

27
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,625
Sure, if you have money,

28
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:16,500
you can get your hands
on some Celebrer.

29
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:19,750
But you're a smart kid, Wallace,
so you must already know.

30
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,958
Deep down.

31
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:25,916
It's not fair to fill him with
the false hope of a long life.

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,875
Put him out of his misery.

33
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,458
[gasps]

34
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,458
[ALEX]
Uh, hey. Good morning.

35
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:46,958
Sounded like you were havin'
a bad dream, so I let myself in.

36
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,625
You okay?

37
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:55,333
Yeah, I'm all good now.

38
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,625
Thanks.

39
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,291
[ALEX]
Whenever I'd have a bad dream,

40
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,333
my mother would do this
for me and I'd feel better.

41
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:07,666
Don't know if it works
as well on grown men.

42
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,958
Ya know, Ally, I think
that's the first time

43
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,333
you've ever mentioned
your past to me.

44
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:17,041
[WORICK sighs]

45
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:21,250
[WORICK]
Hey. Remember what you asked me?

46
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:26,000
You know, if I ever really
thought about the why.

47
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:29,708
I've been askin' the same
thing since I was a kid.

48
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,625
Unfortunately,

49
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,875
the answer just never seemed
to find its way to me.

50
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,291
[ALEX]
And now?

51
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:42,333
Figure it out? An answer?

52
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:55,500
[NINA laughing]

53
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,291
[NINA]
Now go that way, Nico!

54
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,375
Huh? Wait, you're deaf?

55
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,708
You mean this whole time
I was just talking to myself?

56
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,583
What the fuck, man?

57
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,666
No wonder I couldn't
get through to you.

58
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,625
How was I supposed to
know your compensation

59
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,250
was a busted up set of ears?

60
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,458
[DOUG growls]

61
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,583
[NICOLAS]
This guy's a trip.

62
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:16,916
You never said nothing;

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,791
I just figured something
was wrong with your voice!

64
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,291
God damn!

65
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,250
[DOUG]
What is that, sign language?

66
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,500
Do I look like someone
who's had enough education

67
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,458
to understand that shit?

68
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,625
[NINA squeals]

69
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:37,291
[CHAD]
What're you up to now, Doug?

70
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,916
Hey, Nicolas.

71
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,541
You know each other?

72
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,333
It's a message from
the Mercenary Guild.

73
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:51,208
Says when you get back to base,
your ass is grounded.

74
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,833
I'm headed that way now. Hop in
an' I can give you a lift.

75
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,875
[sighs] This really sucks balls.

76
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,708
I got permission last year to
take my own jobs on the side,

77
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,208
so why are they mad?

78
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,208
[CHAD]
Dumbass! Why do you think?

79
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,750
You went after
the Monroe family!

80
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:08,166
The freaking
Monroe family!

81
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,708
Shit, if you'd succeeded,

82
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:12,500
the Guild woulda done a hell
of a lot more than ground you.

83
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,625
Huh?

84
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,000
Huh? Wanna know how old Doug is?

85
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,666
Uh, Nico, you should know.

86
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,166
Doug's compensation is--

87
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,791
I meet all of the
Guild's requirements.

88
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:28,208
They let you start freelancing
on your own once you hit 20.

89
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:33,500
I'm gonna turn 21 this year,
though I may not look it.

90
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:39,541
[NINA laughing]

91
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,583
Oh my gosh, Nico! I'm flying!

92
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:52,416
Oh, man. All those chopped
up bodies were Twilights?

93
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,291
Appreciate you puttin' a rush
on these autopsies, Theo.

94
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,416
I know how busy you are.

95
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,041
Now that I've pinned
down what they were,

96
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,166
have you figured out the who?

97
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,083
Had to bring Worick down
to the station for an assist,

98
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,041
but yeah, more or less.

99
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,250
Trouble is, since they'd
had their tags stolen,

100
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,250
it's just taken a hell of a lot
longer than I would've liked.

101
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,708
[THEO] That big guy
who was making trouble

102
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,750
outside my practice
the other day?

103
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,666
He was tossed in
with the other vics.

104
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,791
What? You mean he wasn't
killed with them?

105
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,875
[THEO]
That's how it looks anyway.

106
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,916
None of the other bodies
exhibited injuries

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,250
consistent with being
restrained before they died.

108
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,916
The rest clearly fought back.

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,125
More time, and I might've
gotten better details.

110
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,666
Huh?

111
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,416
[THEO] All of 'em, though, were
pretty much in their primes.

112
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,750
Well, as far as Twilights go.

113
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,916
Now, if they'd been drugged or
somethin', that'd explain a lot.

114
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,416
But then they wouldn't have
these defensive wounds.

115
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,583
Judging from the cuts,
there was an active struggle

116
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:50,541
and they got dismembered
while still alive.

117
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,250
Corsicans only
work with Normals.

118
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,583
You really think they could
take out Twilights like this?

119
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,500
Oh, wow.

120
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,083
I was certain that was
your doing with the sword.

121
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:06,125
That pile of District
Six bodies-- Huh?

122
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,458
Um, Doug, Nico wants to know

123
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,208
why you took the Monroe job
without the Guild's okay.

124
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,916
I don't know. No reason.

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,583
Just because Gunslinger
Danny's a big shot boss.

126
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,458
Figured if I started
something with that guy,

127
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,791
I'd get to battle some
high-category bodyguards.

128
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,041
Little did I know the only
Tag Danny keeps under him

129
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,250
is some weak-ass Low.

130
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,000
Man, I can't live every
moment of my short life

131
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,000
thinkin' about those
three dumb laws.

132
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:36,083
Not exactly like I'm a member
of the Paulklee Guild by choice.

133
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,625
The truth is, I
could never figure out

134
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,833
all the unwritten rules you
got in this ghetto-ass town.

135
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,916
So wait, you're not
originally from here?

136
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,625
[DOUG]
South Gate was my home.

137
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,833
Got committed to
Ergastulum when I was 16

138
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,375
and drafted to the Guild.

139
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,625
What's wrong? Don't meet
a lotta rogue Tags?

140
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,958
What? West Gate?

141
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:00,791
You, too?

142
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,250
What's the matter, Doug?

143
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:12,958
Usually, I can't get you
to shut up if I try.

144
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:16,125
[DOUG] Yo, Pops, if you got
any work you're sendin' my way,

145
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:19,041
make sure I don't run
into him, all right?

146
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,666
Well, this is
an unexpected turn.

147
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,583
You really don't wanna have to
tango with Nic again, do you?

148
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:29,250
[DOUG] Until today, I've never
met a West Gate survivor.

149
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,958
I see. Pining for the
outside world, are ya?

150
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:36,083
[DOUG]
No. No, it ain't that.

151
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,750
[RADIO] With resistance
from anti-Twilight factions

152
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,041
continuing, the government
has again ordered

153
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,166
the mobilization
of mercenary units.

154
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,166
This move comes in tandem
with new, mandated curfews

155
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,041
for neighboring districts.

156
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:10,500
[NICOLAS]
Cap-- Uh. Captain!

157
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,375
[GASTON] Can't have any
dead weight in my unit.

158
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,458
If your symptoms
have gotten that bad,

159
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,291
it's not even worth
tryin' to sell you off.

160
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:31,875
F-Fath-- Father!

161
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,500
Don't pretend you're human.

162
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,541
You little freak.

163
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,166
Nicolas! Hey! Nic!

164
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,291
Nic, it's all right.
I figured everything out.

165
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,958
You don't have to
serve him anymore.

166
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,500
When I...

167
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,500
When I showed him the cash,
he was glad to sell you to me.

168
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,125
Look, I even got your own
Celebrer supply from the doc.

169
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,916
You'll be fine.

170
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,041
So, let's...

171
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,458
Nic, what's wrong?

172
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,583
[ALEX]
Nicolas?

173
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:44,083
I, um, brought you
a change of clothes.

174
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,250
[ALEX]
How you feelin'? Better?

175
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,208
[PAULKLEE]
This time, there were 12 bodies.

176
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,750
Autopsies haven't
been performed yet,

177
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:03,416
but I think it's safe to assume
they're all Twilights, correct?

178
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,875
Well that would be
music to my goddamn ears.

179
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:10,083
Saves me the trouble of
dealing with you directly.

180
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,916
Listen, Mr. Corsica.

181
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,166
We all know that most likely
it was your clan who did this.

182
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,458
Ma'am, I--

183
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,875
[LORETTA]
Would you destroy the balance

184
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,916
my father and his crew forged?

185
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,416
You claim to despise them.

186
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,000
But I think you're
hiring Twilights

187
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,958
whenever it's
convenient for you!

188
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:30,000
Cut the bullshit!
I've had enough!

189
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,333
You actually think I
would hire a Twilight?

190
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,416
That I would ever get in bed
with those sick freaks?

191
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,416
The thought alone makes me sick!

192
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,375
I would rather have one of
your men chop off my head

193
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,666
with a dull knife and shit
down my bloody neck hole

194
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,583
than associate with those
filthy Twilight scum!

195
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,166
What kind of hypocrite
do you take me for?

196
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,250
Stop talking out your
ass, you little twat!

197
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,666
You filthy old bastard!

198
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,916
She's the damn head
of our family now!

199
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,625
Show some fuckin' respect.

200
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,916
--Calm down, Galahad.
--Asshole!

201
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Now, now. Let's all
take a breath.

202
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,625
Bickerin' with each other won't
solve any of our problems.

203
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,583
True, this appears to
have been a massacre

204
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:11,250
only a Twilight
coulda pulled off.

205
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,708
But that doesn't necessarily
implicate any of us

206
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:17,166
or suggest anyone here
had any involvement.

207
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,791
So an outsider?

208
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,625
Are you implying the
government was behind this?

209
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,583
I'm just sayin' we shouldn't
jump to conclusions is all.

210
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:27,083
This town is crawlin' with
miscreants and lowlifes,

211
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,541
so you just never know.

212
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,333
Don't you agree?

213
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,416
[THEO]
So tell me.

214
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,041
How's your memory been
the last few days?

215
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,625
Has it been fuzzy
or had any gaps?

216
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,458
Have you lost your
sense of time at all?

217
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:48,916
[ALEX]
No.

218
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,583
[THEO] And what about Barry?
Still seeing him?

219
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:56,333
Uh, no, I... Not even once.

220
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,458
Then you're making
good progress.

221
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,166
I'd like you to keep
on takin' those pills,

222
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,083
just to be on the safe side.

223
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,625
Also, I understand
you're a prostitute.

224
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:06,875
I'm not judgin' or anything,

225
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,083
but you should be aware
that excessive stress

226
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,208
can make it more likely
for your hallucinations

227
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,791
and anxiety to return.

228
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:16,583
So try not to get in
over your head.

229
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,791
That's it. We're all done here.

230
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,250
I'll put the bill on
the Handymen's tab.

231
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,916
[ALEX]
Uh. Doctor.

232
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yeah, what?

233
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:29,500
[ALEX] Well. Um.
About your arm. I, uh--

234
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:32,083
[THEO]
Can you make sweets?

235
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:35,083
[ALEX] Well, I guess I can
manage something simple.

236
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,208
[THEO] If ya wanna apologize,
come whip up somethin' sometime.

237
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,708
Nina'd be thrilled.

238
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:45,166
[ALEX]
Okay then, I'd love to.

239
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:59,500
[ALEX]
Thank you for waiting for me.

240
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:04,541
[ALEX]
So I was wondering.

241
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:08,416
Can I stay with you
a little while longer?

242
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,583
I still haven't found
another place,

243
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:14,458
but I'll get outta your
hair soon as possible.

244
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,000
Please, Nic.

245
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:19,750
[NICOLAS]
Dummy.

246
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,041
[ALEX]
Huh?

247
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:24,000
[NICOLAS] Your sign language
is all screwed up.

248
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,500
I don't understand you.
Start over.

249
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,958
In that book.

250
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:35,958
And don't be so rough with it.
I only have the one copy.

251
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,375
He caught me smokin' these.

252
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,708
Next time he catches me with
a cigarette, he might kill me.

253
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,791
Hey, so how are you
startin' to fit in now?

254
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,958
With that new mercenary squad?

255
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,875
North Gate, weren't they?

256
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:59,166
Right.

257
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,333
What a joke.
Nothing's changed, has it?

258
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,625
For real though.
I'm sick of this shit.

It wasn't me. I swear!

I never wanted this.

You don't get to do that.

00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,000
There's no way I'm
letting you do that.

277
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,750
Not after what you've done.

278
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm not going to
let you die today, Nic.

279
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:30,875
You don't get to take
the easy way out.

280
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,750
Yours will be slow.
Nothing like theirs was.

281
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,875
You'll know a lifetime of pain.

282
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,291
Years and years
of real suffering...

283
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,291
...before you get
the privilege to die!

284
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:45,416
That's an order, Nic!
Obey your master!

00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,666
[NICOLAS]
Don't need that anymore.

286
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,291

Four Fathers' meeting.

292
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:21,416
Only Twilights allowed are the
ones ranked "capo" or above.

293
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,625
That'd explain it.
Sucks gettin' left out, huh?

294
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,708
[DELICO] Thanks, but why
aren't you or Nic there?

295
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,916
You've been escortin'

00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,250
[WORICK]
Ah, you know how it is.

298
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:37,041
We'll always be
considered outsiders.

'Sides, if I had brought Nic,

300
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,583
he'd be in the same boat as
you, Delly. Stuck out here.

[DELICO] You're pretty
calm about all this.

Even the high-ranked
ones are goin' down.

Chances are,
Nic'd be no exception.

305
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,291
I mean, the poor guy's
on his own.

306
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:55,791
You're his only contract holder,

307
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,333
and he's got no
syndicate behind him.

308
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:02,375
Somethin' happens to him,
what happens to you?

309
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,583
[WORICK]
It's okay.

310
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,041
[DELICO]
Hm?

311
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:09,625
It's okay. I bet
my father will be happy.

312
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,083
Don't you worry 'bout him.

313
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,458
He buys the farm,
it was meant to be.

00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,458
One less thing tyin' me down.

315
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:18,333
Fact, I'll probably
end up happier for it.

316
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:22,583
[WALLACE] But it's not enough.
In fact, it's not even close.

317
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:25,666
That's why I'm thinkin'
everyone else should die, too.

318
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,250
You mean that? Dude.

319
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:35,125
Sure, deep inside, I despise
Tags. Think they're monsters.

320
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,833
That's fine, I hate
all you Normals, too.

321
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:42,791
Aw, come on, Delly,
I'm just yankin' your chain.

322
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,333
You gotta lighten up there.

323
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,791
Maybe I will if ya
stop callin' me "Delly."

324
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:52,916
[WALLACE]
Nicolas... why?

325
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,291
Why don't you ever
wonder... "why?"

326
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,958
Figure it out? An answer?

327
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,750
[WORICK] I don't think
there is an answer.

328
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:11,666
[WORICK] If there was,
it'd be all over, right?

329
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,875
[TWILIGHT screaming]

330
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:20,208
Erica, I wanna take this.

331
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:23,166
[ERICA] No, Mikhail.
We only take the tags.

332
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,750
[MIKHAIL]
Aww.

333
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,875
[TWILIGHT groaning]

334
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:31,541
[TWILIGHT]
Have mercy. Please.

335
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,458
Y'brought this on
yourself, mister!

336
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:41,250
'Cause you did your friends
wrong, they abandoned you.

337
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,083
[ERICA]
We're done.

338
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,708
Okay!

339
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,416
What's wrong? Nicolas, what's--?

340
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,416
[ALEX]
Nicolas?
