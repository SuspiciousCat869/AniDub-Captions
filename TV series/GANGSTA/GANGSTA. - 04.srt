[RADIO]
And in crime news,

2
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:47,833
Ergastulum police are still
investigating the gruesome

3
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:50,750
early morning discovery of
several decomposing bodies

4
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,375
in an abandoned
District Six factory.

5
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:55,500
In a brief press release,
authorities revealed

6
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,125
that many of the remains
appear to be dismembered

7
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:01,291
by a bladed weapon, only adding
to the difficulties they face

8
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:04,750
in identifying the victims,
let alone a suspect.

9
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:08,250
Up next, stay tuned for sports
and weather, after this.

10
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:15,125
[phone ringing]

11
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,541
[DETECTIVE A]
Yeah, Central Police.

12
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,333
[DETECTIVE B]
Hey, didja hear?

13
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:22,291
Chad hauled in the Handymen
for questioning.

14
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,125
[DETECTIVE C]
What? Aw, crap.

15
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,250
Well, I just hope they don't
break anything valuable,

16
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,083
like last time.

17
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,708
It's the one in there
who gives me the creeps.

18
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:34,083
How's Adkins put up
with those pricks?

19
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,333
So let me try to explain
this to you again, Nic.

20
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:44,250
We found a bunch of chopped up
bodies in District Six.

21
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,625
Now all the cuts
are really clean...

22
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:49,125
[NICOLAS] Can never remember
this police turd's name.

23
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:52,666
Hey, Nicolas.
Are you hearing me?

24
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,583
I mean, are you seeing?

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,916
Ah, jeez. I know you're bored,
but this is important.

26
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:05,833
[CODY]
Nicolas!

27
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,333
Now you're ignoring
me on purpose!

28
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,375
You're a right bastard
sometimes, Chad.

29
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,833
You know Nic won't listen
to anyone but you.

30
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,791
Yeah, that's the point.

31
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,708
[CHAD]
I turned 56 this year.

32
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,583
[WORICK] What? You're playin'
the "old man card" now?

33
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:26,958
[CHAD]
Fuck off.

34
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,500
You and Nic are on the
downslope to 40 yourselves.

35
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,791
You're gettin' older not cooler.

36
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,125
[sighs] We're gettin' old?

37
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,458
Guess we have been doing
"unsavory work" together

38
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:37,208
for a while.

39
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,458
[knocking]

40
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,000
No way!

41
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,375
[chuckles]

42
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,541
How old are we on these posters?

43
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,500
Huh? Only 17?

44
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:54,125
Damn, Nic, you haven't aged
a day since this was taken.

45
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,458
It's your half-Asian blood.

46
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,958
It's so not fair.
It makes me sick.

47
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,833
[CHAD]
It ain't just Nicolas.

48
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,708
Neither of these
meatheads ever change.

49
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:11,125
[WALLACE]
Chad... I...

50
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:15,708
Help me. I don't know
what to do anymore.

51
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,791
[WALLACE crying]

52
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,500
Yeah, go throw those things out.

53
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:26,000
[CHAD] Well, maybe they
have changed. We all have.

54
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,541
[WORICK]
Oh yeah?

55
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:30,250
Why then, Chad, do you
have us shackled up

56
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,916
like we're some
common street thugs?

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,416
What's this really about?

58
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,375
[sighs]

59
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,625
We found this today
in an abandoned factory

60
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,416
in District Six.

61
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,541
[CHAD]
Don't give me the stink eye.

62
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,458
I don't suspect
you guys on this,

63
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,541
but if I don't at least bring
ya in, they'll ride my ass.

64
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,541
Ain't many guys around
who can handle a weapon

65
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,375
like that, right?

66
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,750
[WORICK] Yeah, most of
these cuts came from

67
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,541
a real sharp blade.

68
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,666
Damage to the bodies is so bad,

69
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,708
ID-ing the victims
is going nowhere.

70
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,500
[CHAD] Then we agree
on a trade for your...

71
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,041
..."storage" skill.

72
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,291
[sighs]

73
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,916
[WORICK] See this is why
I don't trust cops.

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,375
Your work's even
dirtier than mine.

75
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,541
[CHAD] It'd take the boys
in the crime lab forever

76
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,666
to figure this one out.

77
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,833
Cody, it's me, let's switch.

78
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,375
Show Worick everything we've
got on these factory bodies,

79
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:32,041
all right?

80
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,958
[CODY]
Eh.

81
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,625
Everything?

82
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,416
[ALEX]
I hope that guy's all right.

83
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,416
It sounded pretty urgent.

84
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,208
[JOEL]
But if I were you, missy,

85
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,708
I wouldn't be rushin'
to put down roots.

86
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,250
And certainly not with that Tag.

87
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,250
I remember the last girl
they had crashin' with them.

88
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:05,208
Poor thing nearly got
killed for her troubles.

89
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:12,000
[ALEX] I'll return this, tell
'em thanks for everything...

90
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,458
...and then I'll leave.

91
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,333
Find a new job, a new place.

92
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,583
[BARRY]
Oh, wow.

93
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,541
Please don't tell me
you're givin' serious thought

94
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:28,166
to goin' back to that, Alex.

95
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,375
You have to've realized
the truth by now.

96
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:35,708
You are who you are and you'll
stay that way till you die.

97
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,250
So embrace it!

98
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,416
Spread your legs for those
two like you did for me.

99
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,375
Trade that sweet candy for rent

100
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:45,541
and I'm sure they'll let you
stay here as long as you like.

101
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,750
[ALEX]
Stop it, Barry!

102
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:56,041
[crying]

103
00:06:56,125 --> 00:07:01,750
[ALEX] It's okay. It's okay.
This time is different.

104
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,541
Worick and Nic aren't like that.

105
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,000
There's the eager lil' beaver.

106
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:12,750
Man. Seriously, why does
Nicolas hate me so much?

107
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,500
He doesn't.

108
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,250
He just loves giving
the fresh fish a hard time.

109
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,708
Don't you start with me too.

110
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,250
[CODY]
That's all of it.

111
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,416
But I still don't
get why you're--

112
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,458
It's a fairly simple trade.

113
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,750
I'll ID all these
vics for you guys,

114
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,333
and in exchange, Chad lets
us go on our merry way.

115
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:35,666
How?

116
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,250
Even the boys in the crime
lab are at a total loss.

117
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:42,416
Their faces were bashed in and
we found no personal belongings.

118
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,041
There's no way you can help us.

119
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,875
Yeah, 'cept the thing is, I can.

120
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,375
[CODY]
Huh?

121
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,250
Number two, the white guy's arm.

122
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,291
Tattoo artist was Edmond.

123
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,458
You're gonna wanna
write this down.

124
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,416
[WORICK] Number seven was one
of Doctor Theo's patients.

125
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,041
Burn marks on his back
are old scars.

126
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:21,000
Number nine, the redhead,
was a hooker over at Harold's.

127
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,083
Didn't attract much attention.

128
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,666
But I saw her hanging
around numbers 11 and 23

129
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,958
at Connie's shop
not too long ago.

130
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,458
And number 26...

131
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,750
So how's the broad doin'?

132
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,875
[CHAD]
She still with you guys?

133
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,416
If you care about her,

134
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,541
you oughta cut her loose 'fore
she winds up like Veronica.

135
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:50,208
Here. Done.

136
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:54,500
That's pretty much everything
I can give you on those stiffs.

137
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,833
[CODY]
Yeah, but, Worick...

138
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,250
How did you--?

139
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,166
Eh, it's nothin'.

140
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,750
Just always been real good
at memorizin' shit.

141
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,000
Let's continue.

142
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,708
In the East-West War
of Unification,

143
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:21,750
[TEACHER, WALLACE]
the west developed

144
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,250
the bio-enhancement
drug Celebrer

145
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,333
[WALLACE]
and began to issue it.

146
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,833
Soon, the soldiers
who demonstrated

147
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,708
the most improvement
in physical ability

148
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:28,958
were deployed into combat.

149
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,125
But following reports of
crippling dependency,

150
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,041
many instances of
severe memory loss,

151
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,958
and even death stemming
from its toxicity,

152
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,708
the drug's use was prohibited
upon the war's end.

153
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,166
I've learned it all.

154
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,916
Don't bother coming in tomorrow.

155
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,625
That's not going to happen.

156
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,541
Master Domenico hired me to
give you a proper education

157
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,416
so the Arcangelo
family can maintain

158
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,666
its sterling reputation.

159
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,833
[GASTON] Master Wallace,
this way, please.

160
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,208
[GASTON] For the next six
months, starting today,

161
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,583
we'll be providing security
for the mansion.

162
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,375
[GASTON, WALLACE] I'm head
of the Westgate Mercenaries

163
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,458
[WALLACE]
Captain Gaston Brown.

164
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,958
Up until last week,

165
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,833
you were in charge of quashing
the anti-Twilight faction.

166
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,833
Honor to meet ya.

167
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,375
[WALLACE]
So... who's that?

168
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:49,041
[phone ringing]

169
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:49,958
Yeah, hello.

170
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,083
[gunfire]

171
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,458
What's that damn racket?

172
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:56,375
You start another
freakin' war, Danny?!

173
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,833
[NICOLAS]
Again?

174
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:01,250
That guy's really gotta start
thinkin' about his age.

175
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,041
[MONROE]
I called the Handymen,

176
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,291
but that new girl of theirs

177
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,125
told me they were at
the station with you.

178
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:11,291
Could use some backup. Tell
those boys to get down here.

179
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,458
Quicker the better, Chad.

180
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,208
[CHAD] Jesus, sounds like
a pretty rough battle.

181
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,708
You sure you don't want
us to join in, too?

182
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,250
[MONROE]
That's a generous offer, but...

183
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,458
...the Handymen would be...

184
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:34,750
...a little more expendable
in case anything should go awry.

185
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,125
[CHAD]
Damn, you are one cold bastard!

186
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,291
I thought these boys
were like sons to you!

187
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:42,125
Just send 'em
the hell down here.

188
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,583
Hey, wait a--

189
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,125
Shit.

190
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,458
[CHAD]
What's the use?

191
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:52,916
Go on!

192
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:01,958
Here.

193
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,000
But, Chad, they--!

194
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,500
Doesn't matter now. Forget 'em.

195
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,916
And bring me those damn files.

196
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,000
He's got another
new bodyguard again?

197
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,625
That kid is a real handful.

198
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,916
Not at all like the
missus, now, is he?

199
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,166
[MAID B]
Oh, you don't know?

200
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,375
The master keeps a cheap
prostitute on the side.

201
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,041
[TEACHER A]
The children of Celebrer-users

202
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,250
exhibit pronounced
genomic mutations.

203
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,625
For example,

204
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,708
their physical abilities
become unusually developed,

205
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:58,166
albeit at the expense of their
mental and emotional faculties.

206
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,625
In turn, many of these cases
require daily use of the drug.

207
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,875
While individuals vary,
on average,

208
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,000
these "Celebrer babies"
suffer shorter lifespans.

209
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,958
A trait that's earned them the
name "Tasogare," or "Twilights."

210
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:19,416
So, hey. You got a name?

211
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:26,000
Dude, you deaf?

212
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,416
Answer me!

213
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,625
Um, how come you
won't talk to me?

214
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:43,500
As your master, I order you to!
Now answer the question!

215
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:47,208
Unless my father-- Did my
dad order you not to talk?

216
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,625
Is that it?

217
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,916
[NICOLAS]
Eh.

218
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,458
Gone.

219
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,791
I can't hear.

220
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,208
Huh?

221
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,583
[WORICK]
Partners, Nic!

222
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,750
The kind who
stick together! C'mon!

223
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:11,291
You're too fast. Take pity
on a poor smoker, will ya?

224
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,750
You know damn well
I'm not going home.

225
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,083
[WORICK]
Call it loyalty,

226
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,708
call it a sense of
concern, whatever.

227
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,500
Trouble is, Mister Monroe's
a bit of a loose cannon.

228
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:26,958
Meaning we need to settle this
now, before it really blows up.

229
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,958
Well, if it isn't the Handymen.

230
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,875
Where are you boys
off to in such a rush?

231
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,000
Business, Granny!

232
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,833
Ah, criminy.

233
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:44,250
Those two are always gettin'
their asses into somethin'.

234
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:52,875
[clapping]

235
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,666
[IVAN chuckles]

236
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,375
Ah, nicely done.

237
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,666
But all this ruthless
efficiency, Delico,

238
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,125
makes things kinda dull.

239
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:03,041
Please... don't kill me.

240
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,958
[gunshot]

241
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:13,416
This is work, Ivan.
I take pride in it.

242
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,875
[chuckles]

243
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,750
[DELICO]
Let's get back to the boss.

244
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,083
What about the mess?

245
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,708
[DELICO]
That is a lot of bodies.

246
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,583
We could reach out
to Inspector Adkins.

247
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,375
Lemme call him, see what he--

248

[GANG MEMBER B]
What the hell?

[GANG MEMBER A]
Hey. Kid, you okay?

250
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,375
Shit, get back. He's with them!

251
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,583

Damn!

00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,916
Heh. You're good.

255
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,750
But that don't mean you
can play in my league.

256
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,583
[DELICO]
He's no child.

257
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,708
[DOUG]
Hey, Danny Monroe!

258
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:01,125
I thought you'd have better
bodyguards than these jokers!

259
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,583
[DELICO]
Not good.

260
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:06,833
Go link up with the
other unit. I'll handle him.

[GANG MEMBER D]
Hey.

They're all friggin' monsters.

[YANG]
The attack's stopped.

264
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:14,875
Think we may've been too quick

265
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,875
to call the Handymen
for back up.

266

--[phone buzzing]
--Hold on.

Hey, kid.

[GANG MEMBER G] You shouldn't
be out here, sport...

269
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:25,875
Delico, what's up?

270
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,958
[DELICO]
Yang! One got away from us!

271
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,583
Young male, looks like a kid.

272
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,416
Watch out for the little punk!

273
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,416
Don't let him get near the boss!

Hmm.

S'one agile little fucker.
Ya screwed up, Yang.

I'm sorry, sir.

279

[MONROE] I'm worried this
twerp's gonna spoil dinner.

280
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,333
I wanna show up with
you guys not dead.

281
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,291
You can take him, right?

00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,375
[YANG, DIEGO, MILES]
Yes, sir!

[NICOLAS sniffs]

284
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,833
What? Why'd you stop?

285

Dammit, Nic!

00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,583
Ugh. That's ripe.

Hey, he was one of Monroe's men.

288
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,833
What're you thinking about
these super clean cuts?

Looks like something
your blade--

Ah, hell. Is it?

00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,958
So, uh. Hey, Chad.

292
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,458
Can we talk about
what Worick did?

293
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,000
This smells fishy.

294

[CODY]
Huh?

00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,625
Reminds me of all the crap

that led up to the Twilight
hunts 15 years ago.

Aw, dammit!

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,958
I just stole this hoodie, too!

Now I know why they call him
"Gunslinger Danny."

300

Sure he's an old man, but his
aim's still fresh as ever.

--[MILES] That voice.

[chuckles]

304
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,291
Y'know, I find it hard to
believe that in this city

305
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,291
where the Three Laws've
been in effect for 20 years,

we still have to put up with
dumb little shits like you.

Oh, excuse me.

piss me off, dude.

If I hadn't promised to
bring you back whole,

I'd chop off that

00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,916
and been done with it.

318
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,166
[PUNK C] But are ya sure it's
cool we went to a guy like him

319
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,500
without askin' first?

320
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:36,708
If the boss finds out--

321
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,666
[PUNK D] He won't if
we keep our mouths shut.

322
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,916
And once Monroe's in the bag,

323
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,500
the Cristiano family
will be a breeze.

324
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,125
Hey, sweet-cheeks.

325
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,375

--[PUNKS groaning]

326
00:18:56,666 --> 00:19:00,458
You don't mind if I ask you
a couple questions, now do you?

327
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,541
[MAID A]
Young Master?

328
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,916
Young Master Wallace?

329
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,166
Sheesh, that boy is too much.
I swear, he must be defective.

330
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,875
[WALLACE] I'm defective?
He's the one who's defective.

331
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:17,708
If he can't hear, how's he
supposed to protect me?

332
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,291
Makes no sense.

333
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:24,333
I mean, Michel and Mom,
they have real... real--

334
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,708
[WALLACE]
Don't come in here! Get out!

335
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,375
Um, I, uh...

336
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,833
Sorry--

337
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:48,333
[NICOLAS] I can't read this,
so I'm returning it.

338
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:56,833
I, uh, guess I never
got your name.

339
00:19:56,916 --> 00:20:00,625
I'm Wallace. Wallace Arcangelo.

340
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:01,916
And you?

341
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,125
[WORICK]
Nic, hold on.

342
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,916
Nicolas!

343
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,458
That pile of bodies
they found in District Six

344
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,166
could be his handiwork, too.

345
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,958
If so, he's an
unpredictable head case

346
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,416
with no regard for
the Three Laws.

347
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,541
You get that, right?

348
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:26,666
So don't do anything stupid,
you reckless bastard.

349
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,625
[MONROE]
Things are gettin' outta hand.

350
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,083
No! Boss!

351
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,291
[DOUG]
Gotcha!

352
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:58,791
[DOUG] Quick moves.
But I nicked you, too.

353
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,375
[DOUG]
Ah, so that's it.

354
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:04,458
I knew there was somethin'
off about you earlier.

355
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,250
You wear the tags, but
you don't show 'em off.

356
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,750
Plus, you're weak.

357
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:12,125
For real, the great Monroe
family hires only one Twilight,

358
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,041
and it's a chickenshit like you?

359
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:17,666
[MONROE] Hey, even a Low like
this one can serve a purpose.

360
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,166
For instance,
he makes a good shield.

361
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,000
Hmm... But I don't
remember sayin' that.

362
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,250
[gasps]

363
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:29,416
About us havin' only one
Twilight on our payroll.

364
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,458
Nico!

365
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:36,833
[MILES]
Handyman!

366
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,541
[DOUG]
Son of a bitch.

367
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,291
You boys have seen some
shit workin' for me,

368
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,458
but you've never seen two guys
ranked this high go at it.

369
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,375
This oughta be fun.

370
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,375
[BOTH]
Boss, should we--?

371
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:10,500
[MONROE] All right, gents.
Time to place your bets.

372
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,791
[MONROE]
Who's your money on?
