00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:54,250
[WALLACE]
Dad. No.

3
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:16,166
[WORICK] Fuckin' dream.
Fuckin' memories.

4
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,416
Paradise, is it?

5
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,583
[ALEX]
Huh, he's got a tribal tattoo.

6
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,750
You going somewhere, Nicolas?

7
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,541
[ALEX]
Maybe he couldn't read my lips?

8
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:34,125
[door opens]

9
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,208
[WORICK]
Mornin'.

10
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:39,250
Oh, hey, Nic, you're here early.

11
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,791
Not my fault you get up
at dawn like an old man.

12
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,083
What's next, dinner at
four in the afternoon?

13
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,666
Uh. Ah, shit.

14
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,625
We got deliveries for
the god-uncle today, huh?

15
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:57,416
[WORICK]
Oh. Right. Friday.

16
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,833
Ally, hate to ask ya, but can
you maybe give Nic a hand?

17
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:05,958
We've got a bunch of drop-offs
to make for Doctor Theo today.

18
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,583
[ALEX]
Uh, sure.

19
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,875
But wait, don't you need me
to cover the phones?

20
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,208
[WORICK]
Nah, I got a job later.

21
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,750
If a woman answers,
it'd be... problematic.

22
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:17,458
What? You have another
job besides this?

23
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:18,708
Well, yeah.

24
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,250
In fact, I'd say it's
my main one, actually.

25
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,875
Hmm.

26
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:26,250
Hey, Nic, you seen
my good shirt?

27
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,791
[WORICK growls]

28
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,333
[WORICK]
Aw, c'mon, dude, not again.

29
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,583
Quit jackin' my clothes
n' shit without asking.

30
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,333
Huh? Whadda ya mean,
"I'm one to talk"?

31
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,750
Right. Yeah, well,
ya got me there.

32
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,166
Sorry, Master Nic.

33
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,458
I guess I "borrowed" your crap
without permission too.

34
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,958
Cool. I'll catch up to
you sometime after noon.

35
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,625
[ALEX]
Oh. Guess, that's my cue.

36
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:01,041
Hey, while you're out,
can pick me up some smokes?

37
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,250
This oughta cover it.

38
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:06,166
Wait. Eh? Oh, fine.

39
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:19,375
[ALEX] So, um, Nicolas,
can I ask you something?

40
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:22,833
This other job that Worick
has outside of the Handymen,

41
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,333
what is it?

42
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:35,208
[ALEX] Maybe if I could
sign it, he'd answer me.

43
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,916
Gigolo.

44
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,041
[ALEX]
Huh?

45
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,458
[phone rings]

46
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,583
[WORICK]
Hello. Thank you for calling.

47
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,291
You've reached the Handymen.

48
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,666
[WORICK]
It's been a while, Madame.

49
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,708
How's your husband?

50
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,291
[laughs]

51
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,416
[WORICK]
Ah.

52
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,375
So then, how much is
my body worth to you today?

53
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,916
A lot, I hope.

54
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,500
What're you up to, Handyman?

55
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,875
Walking in broad
daylight with a whore.

56
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,583
She give you a good price?

57
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,708
How many times I gotta tell ya?
I don't read hands!

58
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,791
And I know you can
speak at least a little.

59
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,250
So go on, use your words!

60
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,166
She's my woman now.

61
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,875
So don't be so hard
on her, Granny.

62
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,916
Ah, so that's how it is.

63
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,541
[ALEX]
No. Uh. Hey, wait for me!

64
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,083
[JOEL]
Must be rough for you, too.

65
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,291
Havin' to indulge him like this.

66
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,041
[ALEX]
Uh. Huh?

67
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:54,583
Sorry. What do you mean by that?

68
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,458
[ALEX]
Hey! Wait up!

69
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,875
[NICOLAS grunts]

70
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,375
[NICOLAS grunts]

71
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:15,583
[ALEX]
"Wait here."

72
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,958
Don't need to know sign
language to get that.

73
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:28,458
[ALEX] I forgot to ask Worick
what brand he smokes.

74
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:29,708
What do I do?

75
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,125
[JOEL] You're on an errand
for Worick, right?

76
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:35,375
You can stop worryin' that
pretty little face of yours.

77
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,583
I gotcha.

78
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,208
Don't know why, but
these cheap-ass things

79
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,625
are all the one-eyed
bastard ever smokes.

80
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,125
[ALEX]
So, what Nicolas just said...

81
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,916
[JOEL] Worick can't
do what it is he does

82
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,041
if someone like you is hangin'
around their place all day.

83
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,250
[ALEX]
Huh?

84
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,541
It's simple.

85
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,875
For as long as I can
remember with those two,

86
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,875
any time he has genuine
feelings for a lady,

87
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,416
he says she's the Tag's girl,

88
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,333
so his clients don't get
all bent outta shape.

89
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:07,125
[JOEL] And that, my dear, is
exactly what's happened to you.

90
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,625
[growls]

91
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,000
[gasps]

92
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,250
[ALEX]
Is that--?

93
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:17,250
Oh yeah, that old mess.
Time flies, don't it?

94
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,541
Hard to believe
it's been so long.

95
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,750
Read up.

96
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:26,041
[ALEX]
This boy.

97
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,500
"Twenty-two years have passed

98
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,833
since the shocking Arcangelo
murder-kidnapping

99
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:33,166
and the case remains unsolved.

100
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,666
After killing family
patriarch Domenico,

101
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,958
his wife Clarissa,
and their oldest son,

102
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,666
the unknown assailant
took the couple's

103
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,375
then 13-year-old younger son
hostage and disappeared.

104
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,500
Police still believe the
crimes were carried out

105
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:49,041
by a young mercenary previously
in the family's employ."

106
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,166
[JOEL] Everyone in town's
at least vaguely aware

107
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,875
of the story.

108
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,125
But I guess that's just
because Ergastulum

109
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:59,875
is the type of place that
attracts a certain type of man.

110
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,458
Wouldn't be the least bit
surprised if those boys

111
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,875
had fled here and
started over themselves.

112
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,541
But if I were you, missy,

113
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,833
I wouldn't be rushin'
to put down roots.

114
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,541
And certainly not with that Tag.

115
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:30,458
[MADAME]
You okay? Does your eye hurt?

116
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,250
[WORICK grunts]

117
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,291
[WORICK] Nah, just feels
a bit wonky, today's all.

118
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,041
I got painkillers if you want.

119
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:41,666
[WORICK]
Mm. No, I'm fine, babe.

120
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,083
[WORICK] Maybe it's just
the time of year.

121
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,833
[MADAME] They do say
changes in the weather

122
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,000
can cause old
wounds to flare up.

123
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:52,291
[WORICK]
Yeah. On rainy days it gets--

124
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,250
Well then, feel better?

125
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,125
[WORICK]
Much, actually.

126
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,125
[yelps]

127
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,541
Whoa, easy.

128
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:08,916
[MADAME chuckles]

129
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,333
There was a picture of a boy
in this morning's paper.

130
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:15,208
I swear he has your exact
same hair. It's eerie.

131
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:19,166
He's probably only 12 or 13,
but he reminded me of you.

132
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,291
[WORICK] The kid from
that old murder case?

133
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,541
Yeah, that's the one.
How'd you know?

134
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,583
[WORICK] I get it more
often than you'd think.

135
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,166
But then, I am pretty
boyish and adorable.

136
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,250
[MADAME chuckles]

137
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,875
[MADAME]
You goof.

138
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:47,041
[ALEX]
Uh. Nicolas. Should I just--?

139
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:56,541
Hey, so, you should bring
your friend along next time.

140
00:10:56,625 --> 00:11:00,125
You know, the brooding
one with the bum ears.

141
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,708
The more the merrier, right?

142
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,083
Not gonna happen.

143
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:06,208
He's got his plate more than
full with Handymen work.

144
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,458
Aw, no fair.

145
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:13,041
[WORICK] My partner ain't
a gigolo, you stupid skank.

146
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,333
So, uh, where next?

147
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,708
[inaudible]

148
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:23,958
Wori--!

149
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,750
Bye, hon. When can
I see you again?

150
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,958
Who knows?

151
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:40,125
When the cash calls, I'll come.

152
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,083
[ALEX] You always take
the back alleys, don't you?

153
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,250
How come?

154
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,708
The main roads would
be a whole lot faster.

155
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,166
They would.

156
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,291
You'll figure out why though.

157
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,833
What's that mean?

158
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,166
[WORICK] Hell of a mess
last time, eh, Marco?

159
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,416
So, your boys recovered yet?

160
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,750
[MARCO]
Hm?

161
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,041
Oh, right. You mean that
business at Theo's clinic.

162
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:15,250
Luckily, all my guys are
back on their feet again.

163
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,875
[MARCO] What happened
afterwards? To that B/2 dude?

164
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,041
Beats me. I didn't ask.

165
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,541
Remember,
collection's next week.

166
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,291
You know the drill by now.

167
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,500
[MARCO]
Hey, yeah.

168
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,416
Almost forgot,
boss wanted me to invite you

169
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,166
to his shindig next week.

170
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,333
Ha. Already?

171
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:35,625
Damn, Mister Cristiano loves
his parties, doesn't he?

172
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,208
He'd love it if you could join.

173
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,958
[WORICK]
Sure, we'll be there.

174
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,291
Not gonna say no to a good time.

175
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,750
'Sides, we wanna stay
tight with you guys.

176
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,833
[MARCO]
Likewise.

177
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:49,416
[gunfire]

178
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,291
Somebody screwed up.

179
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,416
Ah, these goddamn kids today.

180
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,416
Someone throws 'em a little
cash and they flip sides.

181
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,625
Friggin' disgrace.

182
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:58,500
[ALEX]
His face...

183
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,666
So, you guys got our package?

184
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,375
Yeah. Here's your drugs.

185
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:07,916
Convenient for us, meeting
in a back alley, Mister Monroe.

186
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,041
[MONROE]
I'm hearin' things, Worick.

187
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,791
They're sayin' you and your
Tag pal went nuts again.

188
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,250
[WORICK] W-- Hey,
I had nothing to do with it.

189
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,916
That was all Nic.

190
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,166
[MONROE] You're still
the boss, are you not?

191
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,791
Falls on you to keep our boy
there on a tight leash.

192
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:28,416
Tch. Thanks, "Dad." Why you
always takin' his side?

193
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,625
Nicolas, can I have
a quick word?

194
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,541
[MONROE] There's something
I need to ask ya.

195
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:36,916
Tell me.

196
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,666
Don'tcha think it's time you
came back to the family?

197
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,750
We value your formidable
skills and expertise.

198
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:46,166
And believe me, the capos
would be over the moon.

199
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,416
Of course, you're free
to bring Worick along.

200
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,208
Don't even care that he's
a dirty, dirty man-whore.

201
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,208
Look, I'm not tryin'
to pressure ya.

202
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:58,208
Just consider it
with an open mind.

203
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,375
[NICOLAS]
Mister Monroe.

204
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,625
I would be honored
to work for you.

205
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,250
[NICOLAS] But I'm more
comfortable in this job

206
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:11,916
than I was before,
and I like it better, so...

207
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,541
I'm sorry.

208
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,666
Ah, I see.

209
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,791
That's unfortunate.

210
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:24,041
[ALL chuckle]

211
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,416
[PROSTITUTE A] Well, if it ain't
Worick. Long time no see.

212
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,791
[PROSTITUTE B]
Look at that hair.

213
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,208
[PROSTITUTE D]
We miss you, sugar.

214
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,041
You haven't been
around much lately.

215
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,375
[WORICK]
Yeah, I know.

216
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,625
And as much as I'd love
to stick around and play,

217
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,541
today I'm here on business.

218
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,333
Sorry, girls.

219
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,125
[PROSTITUTES chattering]

220
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,500
[WORICK]
Is Big Mama in?

221
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,208
[PROSTITUTE E] Yeah, she's here.
Just a minute, okay?

222
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,875
[WORICK]
Thanks, sweetie.

223
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:52,791
[ALEX]
You're popular.

224
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:53,916
Huh?

225
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,875
Oh. That's because
I used to work here.

226
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,541
We all go way back.

227
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:01,333
Still gotta come by sometimes
for the other job, though.

228
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,750
[ALEX] You don't sound
too pleased about it.

229
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:08,958
Yeah, no. It's a
long story. Too long.

230
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,875
Nicolas? You comin'?

231
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,250
Seriously?

232
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,750
Worick, don't tell me
you're still running around

233
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,500
with that creepy Tag?

234
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,583
Jesus, just ditch
the freak already.

235
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,500
I mean, you can't even
walk down the main roads

236
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,333
if you're with him, can you?

237
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,541
Hey! Watch it!

238
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,125
Well, either way,

239
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,583
he's prob'ly just gonna croak
like the rest of those nutj--

240
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,208
[WORICK] You ever open that
nasty whore mouth of yours

241
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,916
in front of me again...

242
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,416
...and I'll add another gaping
hole between your thighs.

243
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:42,500
So, unless that's what
you want, shut the fuck up.

244
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,708
[NICOLAS]
That dumbass.

245
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:50,708
And he's always tellin'
me not to make trouble.

246
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,208
[BIG MAMA]
It appears one of my girls

247
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,333
has been less than
courteous to you.

248
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,000
Handyman.

249
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,833
[WORICK]
Big Mama.

250
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:03,041
The usual drop-off? Come on in.

251
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:10,000
[BIG MAMA] My, my, what a
pretty girl. She a new recruit?

252
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:13,625
Ah, Nicolas. Why are
you waiting out here?

253
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,708
Let me see that
beautiful face of yours.

254
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,708
[BIG MAMA]
Sorry about that, Worick.

255
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,958
This place is a
Corsican shop now.

256
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,041
You know how they feel

257
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,083
about the threat
posed by Twilights.

258
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,458
Bordellos will attract
men like Nic.

259
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,541
Twilights are basically junkies,

260
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:41,375
but their drug-induced ailments
are most dangerous to others.

261
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,125
In this town,
everything's business

262
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,708
and people only care
about what's best

263
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,375
for their bottom line.

264
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,666
[ALEX]
Ailments?

265
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,166
[WORICK]
Big Mama.

266
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,291
[BIG MAMA]
Hm?

267
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,708
[WORICK]
Um.

268
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:55,833
Do you mind apologizing to
that one call girl for me?

269
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:59,333
I was maybe a little
too hard on her.

270
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,666
[BIG MAMA]
Don't worry about it.

271
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,125
After all, she's a whore.
She's heard far worse.

272
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:10,708
Now give me my package.
I'm a busy woman.

273
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:14,000
[WORICK]
Right. It's all here.

274
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:17,583
Special delivery from
Doc Theo's office.

275
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,458
Refills of the Twilight
drug, Celebrer.

276
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:24,208
Three orders of uppers
and... seven?

277
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:27,250
Seven orders of downers?

278
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,250
Aw, jeez. Is she
really doin' that bad?

279
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,500
[BIG MAMA]
She's gotten so weak.

280
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,458
I'm afraid she can't even move
around anymore on her own.

281
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:40,166
On her good days, we're
lucky if she eats one meal.

282
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,333
She doesn't feel
much pain, at least.

283
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:45,250
Much of anything, really.
Her senses are going.

284
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,083
I don't think she's
got much longer, hon.

285
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,833
[WORICK] Well, a gigolo's
job is never done.

286
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,708
Ally, head back to
our place with Nicolas.

287
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,625
[ALEX]
Uh. Huh?

288
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,625
[ALEX]
Worick, you dummy.

289
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,000
I still have so many questions.

290
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,375
Sorry, girls, I'm busy.

291
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,541
[PROSTITUTE F] You can bring
one of my friends, too.

292
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,208
[ALEX]
Where is Nicolas?

293
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,541

295
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:01,041
Hey, Worick. Get back okay?

296
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:09,125
[breathing deeply]

297
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:13,458
[ALEX] Those long eyelashes.
They go with his hair.

298
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,000
Y'know, when he's
quiet like this,

299
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,250
he's kind of a leading man type.

300
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,916
[WORICK grunts]

301
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,333
[gasps]

302
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,791
[JOEL]
Everyone in town's at least

303
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,000
vaguely aware of the story.

304
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,041
[JOEL]
But if I were you, missy,

305
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,916
I wouldn't be rushin'
to put down roots.

306
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,541
[WORICK]
She left, huh?

307
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,625
[WORICK]
Hm?

308
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,125
Oh, Alex.

309
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:15,625
[ALEX humming]

310
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:28,708
[humming continues]

311
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,208
Ergastulum's a far cry
from paradise.

312
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,250
[ALEX]
Huh?

313
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
If ya stay in this
town too long,

314
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,000
you'll never friggin' escape.

315
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,166
It happened to me and Nic.

316
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:47,000
[WORICK]
Word to the wise. Get out now.

317
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,875
Only a matter of time before
you get sucked in too deep.

318
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,083
[ALEX]
Uh.

319
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,416
[ALEX]
How long have you been a gigolo?

320
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,625
[WORICK]
Huh?

321
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,791
Jeez, how long has it been?

322
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:11,833
I guess not long after I arrived
with Nic. I woulda been... 13.

323
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,375
Yeah, 'bout a year after that,

324
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:17,708
Big Mama saw my potential
and brought me on.

325
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,583
I mean, just look at me, right?

326
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:20,750
And if you think I'm hot now,

327
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,791
you shoulda seen me
when I was younger.

328
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,875
I still got it, though.

329
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:28,791
[ALEX] Have you ever thought
about why, though?

330
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:33,041
[WORICK] Why would you ask
something like that?

331
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,416
[WORICK]
Huh...

332
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,833
[WORICK]
But yeah...

333
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,166
[WORICK]
It's a damn good question.

334
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,416
[NICOLAS grunts]

335
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,333
[WALLACE screams]
