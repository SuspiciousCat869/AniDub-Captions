1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,916
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,916
- ( children giggling )

4
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:18,791
- HUH?

5
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,000
- ( giggles )

6
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:35,166
- KAORU-SAMA.

7
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:37,791
( humming )
- HUH?

8
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,791
AOI-CHAN?

9
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,791
HUH.

10
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,791
HUH?

11
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,500
I KNOW THAT SONG.

12
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,125
THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH,
KAORU-SAMA.

13
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,958
THAT BATH WAS
SIMPLY WONDERFUL.

14
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,750
KAORU-SAMA...
- ( gasps )

15
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,083
- IS THERE SOMETHING
TROUBLING YOU?

16
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,791
- NO, NOT REALLY.

17
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,916
ANYWAY, YOU MUST BE TIRED
AFTER A BUSY DAY LIKE THIS.

18
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,125
I LAID OUT
THE FUTON FOR YOU,

19
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,333
SO YOU OUGHT TO
GET SOME REST NOW.

20
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,458
- THANK YOU.

21
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,791
BUT WHERE IS
YOUR FUTON? 

22
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,125
- I ONLY HAVE ONE,
UNFORTUNATELY.

23
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,125
I CAN JUST SLEEP
ON THE FLOOR SOMEWHERE,

24
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,125
SO IT'S ALL RIGHT.
- I OBJECT.

25
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,791
THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE.

26
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,750
- IT'S ALL RIGHT,
I DON'T MIND.

27
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,291
- IF THAT'S SO,

28
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:38,833
THEN I PROPOSE A COMPROMISE,
KAORU-SAMA.

29
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:42,125
INSTEAD, WE COULD SHARE IT,
IF YOU'RE WILLING.

30
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,291
I-- I DO NOT MIND AT ALL.

31
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,750
- ( gasps )

32
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,416
I'M TELLING YOU THAT

33
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,625
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT ME,

34
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,708
SO GET TO SLEEP,
OKAY?

35
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:52,833
- ( clock ticking )

36
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:01,125
- KAORU-SAMA'S FUTON.

37
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,666
- AOI-CHAN?

38
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,458
YOU ARE GOING TO GO BACK
HOME TOMORROW, AREN'T YOU?

39
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,833
HUH?

40
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,333
- MUST I GO?

41
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,791
I CANNOT CONTINUE STAYING HERE
AT YOUR SIDE, KAORU-SAMA?

42
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:15,458
- WELL, IF YOU STAY AWAY
FROM YOUR HOME FOR TOO LONG,

43
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,708
I'M SURE YOUR FAMILY
WOULD WORRY ABOUT YOU.

44
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,791
- OH, I SUPPOSE SO.

45
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,750
- BESIDES,

46
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,458
THINGS ARE MOVING
TOO QUICKLY.

47
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,791
YOU'RE MY FIANCEE,

48
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:26,875
BUT I--

49
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:31,208
BUT I ONLY REMEMBER YOU
AS A LITTLE KID.

50
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,333
AND THE SAME 
GOES FOR YOU.

51
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,625
- SO THEN--

52
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,666
SO THEN YOU CAN
LEARN MORE ABOUT ME

53
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,833
STARTING RIGHT NOW.
- HUH?

54
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,791
- THE SAME IS TRUE FOR ME.

55
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,125
SO TELL ME.

56
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,125
TELL ME EVERYTHING
ABOUT YOURSELF.

57
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:47,000
- ( stammers )

58
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,458
COME ON, HURRY UP
AND GET TO SLEEP.

59
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,791
SHE'S SOUND ASLEEP.

60
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,833
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN
REALLY TIRED.

61
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:03,833
HUH?

62
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:08,375
SHE WAS HOLDING THIS BEFORE.

63
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,125
I SEE.

64
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:13,291
SHE MADE A MISTAKE AND WROTE
"DISTRICT FIVE, SECTION TWO"

65
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,833
INSTEAD OF THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

66
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,125
IT'S ALL WORN.

67
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,083
AOI-CHAN MUST HAVE KEPT
THIS NOTE CLOSE TO HER

68
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,875
FOR A LONG TIME...

69
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,750
JUST SO SHE COULD SEE ME.

70
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,125
- THE SAME IS TRUE FOR ME.

71
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,458
SO TELL ME--

72
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,916
TELL ME EVERYTHING
ABOUT YOURSELF.

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,125
- UH, AOI-CHAN.

74
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,666
- ( sighs )
- ( gasps )

75
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,916
- ( heart beating )

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,875
- ( gulps )

77
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,875
MAN, THIS IS REALLY BAD.

78
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,458
I CAN'T LET THOUGHTS
LIKE THAT GET THE BETTER OF ME.

79
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,416
I GOTTA COOL DOWN
SOMEHOW.

80
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,125
AAH!

81
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,916
IT'S HOT.

82
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,458
( gulps )

83
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,125
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

84
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:06,125
SHE SAID SHE WAS
MY FIANCEE.

85
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,500
BUT I HAVEN'T EVEN
HAD A GIRLFRIEND YET.

86
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,833
AND NOW SUDDENLY
I HAVE A WIFE?

87
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:15,125
BUT AOI-CHAN'S NOT
A BAD GIRL OR ANYTHING.

88
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,125
( sighs )

89
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,791
THOUGH IF I ACCEPT AOI-CHAN,

90
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:27,958
IT MEANS I'LL BE FORCED
BACK INTO THE HANABISHI CLAN.

91
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:31,458
HANABISHI.
HANABISHI, HUH?

92
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,458
- KAORU-SAMA?

93
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,125
- ( grunts )

94
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,125
- OH, YOU'RE STILL HERE.

95
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,541
THANK GOODNESS.

96
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,666
- WHAT'S THE MATTER,
AOI-CHAN?

97
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,458
- I WOKE UP WHEN
YOU OPENED THE DOOR.

98
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,791
AND WHEN YOU DID NOT RETURN,
I BEGAN TO WORRY

99
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,666
THAT PERHAPS YOU HAD
DISAPPEARED FROM MY LIFE AGAIN.

100
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,458
AND SO, UM, I...

101
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,625
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

102
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,791
THAT PLACE IS MY HOME,
YOU KNOW?

103
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,375
THERE'S NO WAY I'D EVER 
LEAVE IT JUST LIKE THAT.

104
00:06:58,458 --> 00:06:59,791
- YES, OF COURSE NOT.

105
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,250
I'M SO SILLY.

106
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,750
- COME ON.
LET'S GO BACK.

107
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:04,750
- YES.

108
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,791
- ♪ IT'S BEEN SUNG ♪

109
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:15,041
♪ THROUGH ALL GENERATIONS ♪

110

♪ WILL BLOOM. ♪

112
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,916
- HUH?  AAH!

113
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,125
( grunts )

114
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,458
MOM?

115
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,458
- I'M SORRY, KAORU.

116
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,791
I WON'T BE ABLE TO STAY IN
THIS HOUSE ANY LONGER.

117
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:41,125
TAKE CARE.
BE A GOOD BOY.

118
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,125
- DON'T GO!
DON'T GO, MOM!

119
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:46,875
( panting ) 
PLEASE WAIT!

120
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,833
DON'T LEAVE ME HERE
ALL BY MYSELF.

121
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,125
( grunts )

122
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,458
PLEASE COME BACK.

123
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,458
COME BACK, MOM!

124
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,666
GRANDPA, MOM IS LEAVING US.

125
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,333
PLEASE, YOU'VE GOT
TO STOP HER.

126
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,416
PLEASE STOP HER.

127
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,500
HURRY, GRANDPA.
MOM'S GONNA LEAVE!

128
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:12,208
I DON'T WANT HER TO.
STOP HER!

129
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,000
- YOU AREN'T SOME
BAWLING BABY,

130
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,541
SO STOP ACTING LIKE ONE.

131
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,291
FORGET THAT YOU EVER
KNEW THAT WOMAN.

132
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,791
YOU ARE TO BE THE HEIR
OF THE HANABISHI NAME.

133
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,791
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THIS,
KAORU?

134
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,708
- NO, I DON'T.

135
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,791
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
AT ALL.

136
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,291
I DON'T GET ANY OF IT!

137
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,791
- Kaoru: DAMN.
THAT DREAM AGAIN.

138
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,000
( grunts )
WHAT?

139
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,000
HUH?!

140
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:54,250
WHY ARE AOI-CHAN AND I
ON THE SAME FUTON?

141
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,541
I-- I BETTER GET
OUT OF HERE QUICK.

142
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,458
( murmurs )

143
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,458
THIS FEELS...

144
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:03,666
GOOD.

145
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,625
I CAN'T BREATHE.

146
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,458
( grunts )

147
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,958
( gasps )

148
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,666
- ( sighs )
- WOW.

149
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,541
SHE'S TOO CUTE.

150
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,125
( gulps )

151
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,125
I DIDN'T REALIZE IT
BECAUSE OF THE KIMONO,

152
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:24,375
BUT AOI-CHAN'S BREASTS
ARE PRETTY BIG.

153
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,375
NO NO NO NO NO.

154
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,125
I HAVE TO GET AWAY SOMEHOW.

155
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,791
IF SHE COMES TO
THE WRONG CONCLUSION...

156
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,750
- ( dog howls )

157
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,125
- GOOD.
I'M FREE NOW.

158
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,333
- Man On TV: You're not
getting away, you pervert!

159
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,458
- ( stammers )

160
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,166
- ( gunshots )

161
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,791
- Man On TV: Oh, no! Now
he's in a submission hold.

162
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:48,791
The challenger's
in big trouble. 

163
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,791
- HOLD ON.

164
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,041
AOI-CHAN!

165
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,291
( screams )

166
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,458
- Man On TV:
That was a close one.

167
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,958
- HUH?  WHOA.

168
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,708
NOW IT'S THE LEGS.
( giggles )

169
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,791
( stammers )

170
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:10,125
NO!  PLEASE STOP.
ANYWHERE BUT THERE.

171
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,791
- Man On TV: Ooh, the champion
has thrown in the towel!

172
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,125
- FORGIVE ME!

173
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,250
- ( alarm rings )

174
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,125
- ( moans )

175
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,250
( sighs )

176
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,791
OH.

177
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,458
GOOD MORNING.

178
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,666
- GOOD-- GOOD MORNING.

179
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,458
- OH! KAORU-SAMA, IS THERE
SOMETHING THE MATTER WITH YOU?

180
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,791
- THAT'S NOT REALLY IMPORTANT.

181
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:36,333
WHY WEREN'T YOU IN YOUR
FUTON LAST NIGHT, AOI-CHAN?

182
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,958
- WELL, HONESTLY,

183
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,625
LAST NIGHT I NOTICED
THAT YOU LOOKED VERY COLD

184
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,416
WITH ONLY THAT ONE BLANKET.

185
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,583
SO I GOT INTO YOUR FUTON.

186
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:49,541
UM, BUT I TEND TO CLING
TO THINGS IN MY SLEEP. 

187
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,875
WAS THAT THE CASE?
- YEAH.

188
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,125
TIGHTLY TOO.

189
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,791
- I APOLOGIZE.

190
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,750
OH, BUT KAORU-SAMA,

191
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,041
YOU HELD ONTO ME
AS IF YOU WERE COLD.

192
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,291
THEREFORE,

193
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,791
WE CAN CALL THINGS EVEN.
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?

194
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,125
( giggles )

195
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,750
- WELL...

196
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,125
YOU KNOW,

197
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:14,750
THE PROBLEM ISN'T
WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE EVEN.

198
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:27,125
- PLEASE,
HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT.

199
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,458
- WOW.

200
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:29,833
LOOKS DELICIOUS.

201
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,458
- FORGIVE ME.

202
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,208
I LOOKED THROUGH 
YOUR REFRIGERATOR

203
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,541
WITHOUT ASKING YOU.

204
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,625
- HEY, I DON'T MIND. 
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

205
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,958
THERE WASN'T MUCH
OF ANYTHING IN THERE THOUGH.

206
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,291
HOW IN THE WORLD DID YOU
MANAGE TO MAKE BREAKFAST?

207
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,291
AMAZING.

208
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,625
I'M EATING NOW.

209
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,125
- KAORU-SAMA.

210
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,958
- AOI-CHAN?
- HUH?

211
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,958
- I'LL TAKE YOU TO
THE STATION LATER.

212
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,625
I NEED TO HEAD OUT TO MY
FIRST CLASS SOON ANYWAY.

213
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:54,916
- ( gasps )

214
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,666
BUT I-- I CALLED MY HOUSE
EARLIER THIS MORNING

215
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,833
AND IT TURNS OUT THEY SAID
THAT I WOULD BE ABLE

216
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,125
TO STAY HERE FOR
A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.

217
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,458
UM...
AM I BEING A BOTHER?

218
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,791
- N-NO.  YOU AREN'T AT ALL.

219
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,458
- WELL THEN,

220
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:09,541
PLEASE ALLOW ME TO SEE YOU OFF

221
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,458
TO THE TRAIN STATION,
KAORU-SAMA.

222
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,625
- SURE.

223
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:18,458
- SO TELL ME, DO YOU LEAVE FOR
COLLEGE AT THIS TIME EVERY DAY?

224
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,458
- NO, I'M TAKING
MY TIME TODAY

225
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:23,125
BECAUSE MY FIRST CLASS
STARTS SECOND PERIOD. 

226
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,041
- OH, IS THAT THE CASE?

227
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,750
- ( giggling )

228
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,291
- Girl:
YOU ALWAYS MAKE A JOKE.

229
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:32,166
- ( laughing continues )

230
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,875
- EXCUSE ME...

231
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,458
UM, KAORU-SAMA?
- AOI-CHAN?

232
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,625
- ( gasps )
OH, IT'S NOTHING.

233
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:47,958
NOTHING AT ALL.

234
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,708
PLEASE, PAY NO ATTENTION.

235
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,500
- HUH?

236
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,958
- UM, KAORU-SAMA?

237
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,125
WHEN ARE YOU
PLANNING ON RETURNING?

238
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,583
- I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE
ALL THAT LATE, I'M PRETTY SURE.

239
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:01,875
WHY DO YOU ASK?

240
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,958
- IT'S JUST...
I WOULD REALLY LOVE

241
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,458
TO PREPARE DINNER
FOR YOU TONIGHT AS WELL.

242
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,125
WOULD THAT BE ALL RIGHT?

243
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,750
- MAKE DINNER?
FOR ME?

244
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:11,791
- YES.

245
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,791
- HEY, I DON'T MIND AT ALL.

246
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,291
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU HAD IN MIND,

247
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,625
THEN I OUGHT TO BE
THE ONE ASKING YOU

248
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:17,916
IF IT'S ALL RIGHT,
AOI-CHAN.

249
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,625
- I'M SO GLAD.

250
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,000
- I'LL DEFINITELY MAKE SURE

251
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,833
THAT I GET HOME
IN TIME FOR DINNER, OKAY?

252
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,791
- TAKE CARE ON YOUR WAY.

253
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,291
- YEAH.

254
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,666
I'M OFF THEN.

255
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,125
- YES.

256
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,708
I'LL DO MY BEST.

257
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,458
- I'M OFF.
( chuckles )

258
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:44,458
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
I SAID THAT?

259
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,125
- NOW, WELL, LET'S SEE.

260
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,333
- WELCOME.
- HUH?

261
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,208
- WHAT'LL IT BE, MISSUS?

262
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,458
- OH MY.

263
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,125
I'M NO MISSUS, SIR.

264
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:13,458
HOWEVER, I WOULD LIKE
THE MACKEREL, PLEASE.

265
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,666
- YOU BET.
THAT'S COMING RIGHT UP.

266
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,125
- ( sighs )
THAT SHOULD BE ALL OF IT.

267
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,125
BUT BEFORE I BEGIN
PREPARING DINNER, 

268
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,833
FIRST THINGS FIRST.

269
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,583
ALL RIGHT.

270
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,458
( sighs )

271
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,458
OH, GOODNESS,
THAT KAORU-SAMA.

272
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:42,125
HE CERTAINLY HAD 
A LOT OF LAUNDRY.

273
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,958
( sighs )
HUH?

274
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,500
WHAT?

275
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,750
OHH...

276
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:53,750
- SO YOU SEE, THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN CAN...

277
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:57,041
- I WONDER WHAT KIND OF DINNER
AOI-CHAN WILL BE MAKING FOR ME.

278
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,083
- ( humming )

279
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,000
( sighs )

280
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,125
THIS ISN'T...

281
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,458
A DREAM.

282
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,291
- HEY, HANABISHI.

283
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,875
WE'RE GOING OUT
DRINKING TONIGHT,

284
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,458
SO DON'T BE LATE.
- DRINKING TONIGHT?

285
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:27,958
- WE TOLD YOU 
THE OTHER DAY.

286
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,166
- YOU DID, HUH.

287
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,833
- YOU ARE COMING,
AREN'T YOU?

288
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,333
- UH, ACTUALLY...

289
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:36,125
I'M SORRY, BUT I GOT A SUDDEN
CHANGE IN PLANS TODAY.

290
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,125
- YOU SERIOUS?
HANABISHI,

291
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,083
I TOLD YOU EVERY MEMBER
OF THE PHOTO CLUB

292
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,375
HAD TO ATTEND.
- SORRY.

293
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,791
I'LL MAKE SURE
TO GO NEXT TIME.

294
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,416
- ( clock ticking )

295
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,625
- I WONDER WHY IT IS
THAT WHEN I'M WITH KAORU-SAMA

296
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,875
TIME SEEMS TO SLIP BY
SO QUICKLY.

297
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,833
IT IS A BIT EARLY,
BUT...

298
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,375
KAORU-SAMA!
- HUH?

299
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,625
AOI-CHAN!

300
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:14,375
- PLEASE ALLOW ME
TO WELCOME YOU HOME.

301
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:15,791
- I'M BACK.

302
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,125
BUT WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, AOI-CHAN?

303
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,791
- I FINISHED PREPARING DINNER
SOME TIME AGO,

304
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,083
SO I THOUGHT I'D WAIT.

305
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,291
- YEAH, BUT I DON'T THINK
I EVER MENTIONED

306
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,125
WHAT TIME I'D BE
GETTING BACK.

307
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,458
WERE YOU WAITING
THE WHOLE TIME? 

308
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,125
- OH, NO.

309
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,791
- HOW LONG WERE YOU WAITING?

310
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,458
- LET'S SEE,
AN HOUR I SUPPOSE?

311
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:35,791
- FOR AN HOUR?

312
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,625
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN
WAITING AT HOME.

313
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,791
- FORGIVE ME.
IT'S JUST...

314
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,958
I WANTED TO BE WITH YOU AGAIN
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

315
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,375
- ( gasps )

316
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,083
- ANYWAY, I WAS LOOKING
FORWARD TO SEEING YOU, 

317
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,125
SO IT SEEMED LIKE
A BRIEF MOMENT TO ME.

318
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,875
- OH, I SEE.

319
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:07,416
- UM... KAORU-SAMA?

320
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,666
- HUH?

321
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,458
- I HAVE A FAVOR
TO ASK OF YOU.

322
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,875
- A FAVOR?

323
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,791
- WELL...

324
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,291
WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT
IF WE HELD HANDS?

325
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,916
- UH... SURE.

326
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:26,333
- I NEVER REALIZED THAT
YOUR HAND WAS SO MUCH

327
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:27,541
BIGGER THAN MINE.

328
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,291
- YOU THINK SO?
HUH.

329
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,291
- YES.  HOWEVER,

330
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,833
THE HAND THAT
I REMEMBER HOLDING

331
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,166
WAS THAT OF A CHILD.

332
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,375
IT'S ONLY NATURAL
THAT IT HAS CHANGED.

333
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,000
- IF WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT CHANGES,

334
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,166
THEN YOU'VE CHANGED
A LOT TOO, AOI-CHAN.

335
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,791
- YOU THINK THAT
I'VE CHANGED A LOT?

336
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,791
- YEAH.  A LOT.

337
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,208
- HOW HAVE I CHANGED?

338
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,625
- YOU'VE BECOME
VERY BEAUTIFUL.

339
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,625
- OH.

340
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,458
OH, STOP.
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME.

341
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,458
- ( chuckles )

342
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,375
- Aoi: PLEASE,
GO AHEAD AND START.

343
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,125
- WOW!

344
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,083
LOOKS DELICIOUS.

345
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,458
THANKS FOR ALL THE FOOD.

346
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,125
( chuckles )

347
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,041
WHAT'S THIS, AOI-CHAN?

348
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,333
- OH. CHIKUZEN STEW.

349
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,166
- ( chews ) 
- HOW IS IT?

350
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,458
- MM-HMM.
- I HOPE IT IS TO YOUR LIKING.

351
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:23,458
- IT'S GREAT.
TOTALLY DELICIOUS.

352
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,125
- I'M SO GLAD.

353
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,291
PLEASE EAT AS MUCH
AS YOU WOULD LIKE.

354
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,958
THERE'S ENOUGH FOOD
FOR SECONDS.

355
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:33,291
- MMM!  IT'S THE FIRST TIME
SINCE I LEFT THE HANABISHI HOUSE

356
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,791
THAT I'VE EATEN
FOOD THIS GOOD.

357
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,125
- IS THAT REALLY TRUE?
- MM-HMM.

358
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,791
I EAT INSTANT NOODLES
MOST OF THE TIME.

359
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,458
AND WHEN I DON'T
HAVE ENOUGH MONEY,

360
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,458
I END UP LIVING OFF OF
BREAD CRUSTS.

361
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,791
- LIVE OFF OF BREAD CRUST?

362
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,958
YOU CAN'T MEAN
THAT IS ALL YOU EAT.

363
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,458
- YEP.

364
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,958
BUT THAT'S HOW GUYS
LIVING ALONE USUALLY EAT.

365
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,791
- THAT WON'T DO!
IT WON'T.

366
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,166
YOU MUST EAT SOMETHING
THAT IS MORE NUTRITIOUS.

367
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,666
YOU WILL DIE OTHERWISE.

368
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,166
- ( gulps )
YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

369
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,125
- HERE.  I INSIST 
THAT YOU EAT THIS.

370
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,750
I KNOW THAT GRILLED FISH
IS YOUR FAVORITE TOO,

371
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,291
SO HAVE SOME THIS INSTANT.

372
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,833
- THANKS.

373
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,791
GRILLED FISH
IS MY FAVORITE.

374
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:16,458
HOW DID AOI-CHAN KNOW
WHAT MY FAVORITE FOOD WAS?

375
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,458
COME TO THINK OF IT,

376
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,958
NOW THAT I LOOK AT THIS TABLE,

377
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,458
THIS IS ALL FOOD
THAT I LIKE.

378
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,333
- IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?

379
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,791
- UH, AOI-CHAN?

380
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,791
HOW DID YOU KNOW
WHAT FOOD I LIKED?

381
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,750
- WELL, TO TELL THE TRUTH,

382
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,000
I WAS CONSTANTLY WATCHING YOU
WHEN WE WERE STILL CHILDREN,

383
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,750
KAORU-SAMA.

384
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:38,500
I ALSO LEARNED MANY OTHER THINGS
ABOUT YOU DURING THAT TIME.

385
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,500
THAT YOU LIKED GRILLED FISH,

386
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,125
THAT YOUR FAVORITE COLOR
IS BLUE,

387
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,208
THAT YOU PREFER SHORT HAIR,

388
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,416
AND WHAT KIND OF SONGS
YOU LIKE TOO.

389
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,791
- SONGS?

390
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:50,791
( gasps )

391
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,458
THAT'S RIGHT.

392
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,791
I WAS WONDERING WHY
AOI-CHAN KNEW THAT SONG

393
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,458
THAT MOTHER ALWAYS SANG.

394
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,000
BUT NOW I REMEMBER.

395
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,791
IT WAS ME.

396
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:05,500
I TAUGHT HER
THAT SONG BACK THEN.

397
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,291
I'M SURPRISED
YOU REMEMBER THAT SONG.

398
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,458
- THERE'S NO WAY THAT
I WOULD FORGET THE SONG

399
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,791
THAT YOU TAUGHT ME
WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

400
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,333
I SING IT ON OCCASION
TO THIS DAY.

401
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:18,833
I FELT CLOSER TO YOU
WHENEVER I SANG THAT SONG.

402
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,708
AS IF I COULD OVERCOME
ANY PAINFUL TIMES.

403
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:22,750
- PAINFUL TIMES?

404
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,375
- YOU KNOW,
I HAVE DONE MY UPMOST

405
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,625
SO THAT I COULD BE 
A GOOD WIFE TO YOU.

406
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,791
IT WAS MY ONE DREAM TO BE
TOGETHER WITH YOU LIKE THIS.

407
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,791
I WANT TO CLEAN UP
AFTER YOU.

408
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:39,125
I WANT TO DO
THE LAUNDRY FOR YOU.

409
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,791
I WANT TO PREPARE
MEALS FOR YOU

410
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,333
THAT YOU WILL ENJOY.

411
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,458
AS LONG AS YOU WISH IT,

412
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,583
I WOULD LIKE TO
FULFILL THAT DESIRE.

413
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,625
- AOI-CHAN...

414
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:51,791
- FORGIVE ME.

415
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,125
I DID NOT MEAN
TO CHATTER AWAY.

416
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,458
PLEASE FINISH THIS
BEFORE IT GETS COLD.

417
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:57,833
- SURE.

418
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,708
- ( water sloshing )

419
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,500
- ( sighs )

420
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,916
I NEVER KNEW.

421
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,666
TO THINK THAT AOI-CHAN
HAD FELT THAT DEEPLY ABOUT ME

422
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,416
FOR ALL THESE YEARS.

423
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,458
AND SHE'S SO THOUGHTFUL.

424
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,458
SHE EVEN HAD A BATH ALREADY
DRAWN FOR ME AFTER DINNER.

425
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,791
SHE REALLY IS DOING
EVERYTHING FOR ME. 

426
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,791
WHICH MEANS, NEXT IS...

427
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,458
- KAORU-SAMA...

428
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,125
ALLOW ME TO
SCRUB YOUR BACK.

429
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,458
- IF SHE DID
COME IN LIKE THAT,

430
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,791
I REALLY WOULD
FALL FOR HER. 

431
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,125
BUT, YOU KNOW,

432
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,458
I REALLY CAN'T SEE
AOI-CHAN DOING THAT.

433
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,750
- ( knocks on door )
- ( gasps )

434
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,333
- KAORU-SAMA, EXCUSE ME?

435
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,291
- ( gasps )

436
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:41,458
- I WOULD LIKE TO
SCRUB YOUR BACK. 

437
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:44,833
SO WOULD YOU MIND TERRIBLY
IF I CAME IN?

438
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,125
- WHAT?!

439
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:51,208
- ( dogs howling )

440
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,166
- ( theme music playing )

441
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,416
- ( singing in Japanese )

442
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:24,916
- YOU BEAST! HOW DARE YOU
DO THIS TO LADY AOI!

443
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,166
- Aoi: MISS MIYABI!

444
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,791
NEXT EPISODE AI YORI AOSHI,

445
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,208
"SEPARATION."

446
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:35,166
I WILL ALWAYS BE
BY YOUR SIDE.
