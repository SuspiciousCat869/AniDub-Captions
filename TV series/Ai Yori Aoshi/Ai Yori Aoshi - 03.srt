1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,458
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,750
( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,500
- KAORU-SAMA, EXCUSE ME.

4
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:09,166
I WOULD LIKE
TO SCRUB YOUR BACK.

5
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,125
SO WOULD YOU MIND TERRIBLY
IF I CAME IN?

6
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,708
- WHAT?!

7
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,666
WAIT, YOU CAN'T, AOI-CHAN.

8
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,333
- IT IS ALL RIGHT
AS LONG AS YOU DESIRE IT...

9
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:21,791
KAORU-SAMA.

10
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,125
- ( gasps )

11
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,083
( heart beating )

12
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,000
- EXCUSE ME.

13
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,000
- WAIT, YOU CAN'T
COME IN HERE!

14
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,000
HUH?

15
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,625
YOU WERE WEARING CLOTHES?

16
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,791
- YES.
- ( yelps ) IN ANY CASE,

17
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,500
NO MEANS NO.
( yelps )

18
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,875
- ( both scream )

19
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,666
- OW OH.

20
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,333
HUH?
- KAORU-SAMA?

21
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:51,333
- ( stammering )
- ( dog howls )

22
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,958
- ( Aoi screams )

23
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,666
- LADY AOI!
( gasps )

24
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,958
OH!
- ( Aoi gasps )

25
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:00,958
- HUH?

26
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,208
- Y-Y-Y-YOU!

27
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,666
YOU BEAST!

28
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:09,041
HOW DARE YOU DO THIS
TO LADY AOI!

29
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,916
- WAIT WAIT, MISS MIYABI!
- LADY AOI.

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,500
- M-MISS MIYABI?

31
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,833
( Kaoru moaning )

32
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,750
- IS YOUR HEAD
FEELING ALL RIGHT?

33
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:30,875
I'M SO SORRY. IT WAS ALL BECAUSE
I RAISED MY VOICE SO MUCH.

34
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,208
- IT'S FINE.
IT'S PARTLY MY FAULT TOO.

35
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:37,333
BUT WHO EXACTLY IS THIS?

36
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,666
- MISS MIYABI KAGURAZAKI.

37
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,750
SHE IS THE ONE WHO
TOOK CARE OF ME

38
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,791
EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL.

39
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,916
- I SEE.

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,291
- LADY AOI,

41
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:51,791
ARE YOU AWARE OF THE POSITION
THAT YOU HAVE PUT YOURSELF INTO?

42
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,916
- BUT I--

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,625
- "BUT I" WHAT?!
- ( whimpers )

44
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:58,458
- WHAT IS SHE MAD ABOUT?
YOU SAID THIS MORNING

45
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,875
YOU CALLED YOUR FOLKS AND THAT
THEY SAID IT WAS ALL RIGHT.

46
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,625
- PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

47
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,833
WELL, ACTUALLY I...

48
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,333
CAME HERE WITHOUT LETTING
ANYONE KNOW.

49
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,125
- WHAT?
- LADY AOI,

50
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,541
IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT
YOU BETTER UNDERSTAND

51
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,166
THE SITUATION YOU ARE IN.

52
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,333
THE SAKURABA FAMILY OPENED
ITS FIRST KIMONO SHOP

53
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,625
OVER 200 YEARS AGO.

54
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,000
IT HAS SINCE BECOME
A PRESTIGIOUS FAMILY

55
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,916
THAT RUNS ONE OF THE LARGEST
CONGLOMERATES IN THE NATION,

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,833
THE SAKURABA GROUP.
YOU MUST ALWAYS REMEMBER

57
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,583
TO ACT RESPONSIBLY SO THAT
YOU DO NOT DISGRACE THE NAME

58
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:31,958
OF THE SAKURABAS.

59
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,833
- I APOLOGIZE FOR LEAVING
WITHOUT PERMISSION.

60
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:39,875
HOWEVER I AM-- I AM STILL
KAORU-SAMA'S FIANCEE.

61
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,958
- THIS MAN HERE
NO LONGER POSSESSES

62
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,875
ANY TIES
TO THE HANABISHI FAMILY.

63
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,833
THE MAN WHO WILL BECOME
YOUR HUSBAND, LADY AOI,

64
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,333
WILL ONE DAY TAKE THE
SEAT AS THE PRESIDENT

65
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,083
OF THE SAKURABA GROUP.

66
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,958
AND IT IS FOR THAT REASON
YOU MUST BE WED TO A MAN

67
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,625
OF YOUR OWN HIGH CALIBER.

68
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:56,958
HOWEVER,

69
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:00,041
THIS MAN HAS BEEN BANISHED
FROM THE HANABISHI CLAN.

70
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:04,291
HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR
FAMILY ENDED AT THE SAME TIME.

71
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:07,250
AN ORDINARY MAN
WITH NO POWER WHATSOEVER

72
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,500
COULD NEVER BE WORTHY OF YOU.

73
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:18,375
SO COME, WE MUST
RETURN IMMEDIATELY.

74
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,583
- KAORU-SAMA!
- THAT IS ENOUGH, LADY AOI.

75
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:28,291
- I WILL NOT GO. I DO NOT WISH
TO LEAVE KAORU-SAMA'S SIDE.

76
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,125
- IS IT STILL NOT CLEAR TO YOU?

77
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:33,875
- I CANNOT IMAGINE BEING WITH
ANYONE OTHER THAN KAORU-SAMA.

78
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,916
I HAVE BEEN LIVING TO THIS DAY
SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE

79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
OF BECOMING HIS WIFE.
- ( sighs ) AOI-CHAN.

80
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,875
- WON'T YOU PLEASE
CONSIDER RETURNING...

81
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,583
- HUH?

82
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,208
- ...TO HANABISHI?

83
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,541
IF YOU RETURN
TO THE HANABISHI HOUSE,

84
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:52,833
WE CAN BE TOGETHER.

85
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,875
PLEASE, IS THERE NO WAY THAT
YOU WOULD RETURN?

86
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,666
- ( heart beating )

87
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:09,833
UH, I...

88
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,833
I-- I JUST--

89
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:23,208
I CAN'T. I WON'T GO BACK
TO THE HANABISHI CLAN.

90
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,666
- ( glass breaks )

91
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,916
- OH, KAORU-SAMA!

92
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
( crying )

93
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,916
- YOU SEE FOR YOURSELF NOW,
DON'T YOU?

94
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,458
IN THE END, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT
HE IS A MAN OF LOW CALIBER.

95
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,125
COME, LET'S GO.

96
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:48,000
YOUR PARENTS ARE ALSO
WORRIED ABOUT YOU AS WELL.

97
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,208
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO.

98
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,958
BUT IN A BIT.

99
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,333
PLEASE AT LEAST ALLOW US
A BRIEF MOMENT TO SPEAK ALONE.

100
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,291
- LADY AOI.
- PLEASE, I BEG OF YOU.

101
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:04,166
ONCE WE ARE DONE TALKING, I
PROMISE THAT I WILL GO WITH YOU.

102
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,208
- YOU MAY HAVE YOUR MOMENT.

103
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:30,041
- I AM VERY HAPPY THAT I WAS
ABLE TO SEE YOU AGAIN,

104
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,583
KAORU-SAMA.

105
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,875
YOU WERE SO WONDERFUL WHEN
I KNEW YOU AS A YOUNG BOY.

106
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:39,791
BUT YOU ARE MORE GENTLE NOW
THAN I COULD HAVE EVER IMAGINED.

107
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,625
AND SO KIND.

108
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:44,458
I WOULD BE SO HAPPY
IF I COULD CONTINUE

109
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,166
BEING HERE
WITH YOU LIKE THIS.

110
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,875
HOWEVER, IF THIS IS THE DECISION
YOU YOURSELF HAVE MADE,

111
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,791
I CANNOT DO ANYTHING.

112
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,041
- ( wind blowing )

113
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,291
- THE REASON THAT I LEFT
THE HANABISHI HOUSE IS BECAUSE

114
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,291
I WASN'T A MEMBER OF THEIR CLAN
TO BEGIN WITH.

115
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,208
- WHAT?

116
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,916
- MY FORMER NAME
WAS KAORU HONJO.

117
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,291
AND MY MOTHER
KUMI HONJO WAS NEVER

118
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:20,625
ACTUALLY OFFICIALLY MARRIED
TO MY FATHER YUJI HANABISHI.

119
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:25,583
BECAUSE THE HANABISHI FAMILY
WAS OPPOSED TO THEIR MARRIAGE.

120
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,541
BUT WHEN I WAS FIVE,

121
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,541
RIGHT WHEN MY FATHER PASSED AWAY
FROM A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT,

122
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,541
THEY CHANGED THEIR MINDS

123
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,208
AND THEY SAID THEY
WANTED TO ADOPT ME.

124
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,708
MY MOTHER DID AS
THE HANABISHI CLAN ASKED

125
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,625
TO PROTECT ME FROM HARDSHIP.

126
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,416
AND BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
TO WORRY MY MOTHER

127
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,000
I PRETENDED TO BE THE HEIR
TO THE HANABISHI FAMILY

128
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,875
ALL THAT TIME.

129
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,625
BUT I COULDN'T DO IT.

130
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,458
IN THE END I JUST COULDN'T
BECOME ONE OF THEM.

131
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,541
- STOP IT!
- ( flames crackling )

132
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,791
- PLEASE STOP IT!

133
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,916
- THAT HUSSY DIED
HALF A YEAR AGO.

134
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,541
WHAT GOOD DOES THINKING
ABOUT THE DEAD DO?

135
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,916
YOU SHOULD GROW UP...
- ( gasps )

136
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,958
- ...AND FORGET THAT
YOU KNEW HER.

137
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,875
- YOU DARE?
YOU DARE DEFY ME?!

138
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,791
- ( grunting )

139
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,416
- AND WHAT'S WITH THAT LOOK?
( kicks )

140
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,875
GIVE THAT TO ME.

141
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,125
NOW!

142
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,833
YOU STUBBORN BRAT!
- ( sobbing )

143
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,458
- DO YOU EVEN UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU ARE THE NEXT HEAD

144
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,625
OF THE 300-YEAR-OLD
HANABISHI CONGLOMERATE?

145
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,583
DO YOU INTEND
TO MAKE US WASTE

146
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,583
ALL THAT TIME
AND EFFORT RAISING YOU?

147
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,708
- ( blows continue )
- ( screams )

148
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:57,625
- THAT WAS WHEN I DECIDED I
WOULD LEAVE THE HANABISHI HOUSE.

149
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:01,291
THIS IS A CHARM
THAT I GOT FROM MY MOTHER.

150
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:04,000
IT WAS THE ONLY THING
THAT I MANAGED TO PROTECT.

151
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,250
THERE IS A PIECE
OF MY PLACENTA IN THIS THING

152
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:12,666
AND IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT
I HAVE LEFT TO REMIND ME OF HER.

153
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,625
THERE ISN'T A SINGLE PERSON
LEFT IN THIS WORLD

154
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,166
THAT I CAN CALL MY FAMILY.

155
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,666
THAT WASN'T A HOME.
IT WAS JUST A PRISON.

156
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:26,791
AND THAT'S WHY
I'LL NEVER GO BACK.

157
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,791
HUH?

158
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,166
- OH, KAORU-SAMA.

159
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,125
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

160
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,875
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
VERY DIFFICULT FOR YOU.

161
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,333
- Kaoru: AOI-CHAN'S HANDS...

162
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,333
THEY'RE SO WARM.

163
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,625
WHAT IS THIS?

164
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,000
THIS FEELING?

165
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,625
IT FEELS SO FAMILIAR,

166
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,708
SO SOOTHING.

167
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,625
OH, I SEE.

168
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,625
THAT'S WHY.

169
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,833
- LADY AOI, COME.
IT'S TIME TO GO.

170
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:49,208
YOU MUST NOT STAY IN A PLACE
SUCH AS THIS FOR LONG.

171
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,916
- Kaoru: AOI-CHAN?

172
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,625
I'M SORRY.

173
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,708
IT'S JUST THAT I--

174
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,625
- Aoi: KAORU-SAMA?
- HUH?

175
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,625
- DON'T WORRY.
I WILL BE FINE.

176
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,791
THERE IS NO REASON
FOR YOU TO FEEL GUILTY.

177
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:15,041
I DISRUPTED YOUR DAILY
ROUTINES, AFTER ALL.

178
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:19,083
PLEASE, DO TRY TO EAT PROPERLY,

179
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:22,458
WATCH YOUR HEALTH
AND DON'T OVEREXERT YOURSELF.

180
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,333
- AOI-CHAN...
- KAORU-SAMA,

181
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:28,333
THERE IS NO NEED TO LOOK
AT ME WITH SUCH CONCERN.

182
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,875
I WILL BE--

183
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:39,125
I WILL BE
PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT.

184
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,000
SO PLEASE DON'T WORRY.

185
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,250
( sobs )

186
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,458
I WILL BE

187
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,291
PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT.

188
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:51,291
AFTER ALL, YOU REMAINED
THE SAME KAORU-SAMA

189
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,958
THAT I LOVED SO MUCH.

190
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,500
AND I ASK THAT YOU
PLEASE CONTINUE

191
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,791
BEING EXACTLY THE WAY
YOU ARE NOW.

192
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:01,875
ALWAYS BE THE ONE PERSON
WHOM I LOVE SO VERY MUCH.

193
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,583
I AM SORRY TO HAVE
TROUBLED YOU, KAORU-SAMA.

194
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,833
- ( echoing door closing )

195
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,250
( rain pattering )

196
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,250
- EH, IT'S HANABISHI.

197
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:57,166
- HEY THERE, HANABISHI. YOU
WANT TO GO GRAB A BITE TO EAT?

198
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,333
- HANABISHI, HEY, WAIT UP!

199
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,333
- Both: HANABISHI!

200
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:04,833
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

201
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,791
- DON'T KNOW.

202
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,333
- ( couple laughing )

203
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:21,541
- Man: BUT YOU KNOW.

204
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,833
- Woman: YOU'RE SO FUNNY.

205
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,333
- I HAVE ALREADY TAKEN
THE LIBERTY OF INFORMING

206
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,125
YOUR MOTHER AND FATHER,
LADY AOI.

207
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:51,041
BOTH OF THEM WERE
TERRIBLY WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

208
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,833
PLEASE, DON'T EVER BEHAVE IN
SUCH A HAPHAZARD FASHION AGAIN.

209
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:06,375
LADY AOI, IF SOMETHING
WERE TO HAPPEN TO YOU,

210
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,541
I WOULD--

211
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,583
- ( thinking )
KAORU-SAMA...

212
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,666
- THERE ISN'T ANYONE
THAT I CAN CALL FAMILY.

213
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,958
- ( thinking ) IT IS BETTER
THIS WAY. IF I WERE THERE,

214
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:24,583
IT WOULD ONLY SERVE TO REMIND
HIM OF WHAT HAPPENED BACK THEN.

215
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,333
BUT STILL...

216
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,166
- Girl: MOMMY!
- UH?

217
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,458
- ( crying )

218
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,958
HEY, MOMMY,
WHERE DID YOU GO?

219
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,375
MOMMY!
( wailing )

220
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,125
- MAKO-CHAN!
- MOMMY!

221
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,333
( crying continues )

222
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:55,541
- KAORU-SAMA, WILL YOU BE ALL
ALONE FOREVER FROM THIS DAY ON?

223
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,666
- ( lock clicks )

224
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,166
- I'M...

225
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,666
HOME.

226
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:12,916
( sighs )

227
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:25,750
WAS THIS ROOM ALWAYS
THIS BIG AND EMPTY?

228
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,000
HUH?

229
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:32,958
- Aoi: "LAST NIGHT'S LEFTOVERS

230
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,166
ARE IN THE POT IN
THE REFRIGERATOR.

231
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,083
PLEASE EAT IT ALL SOON.
AOI."

232
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,791
- THIS IS BAD.

233
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,375
AND I THOUGHT THAT I WAS
USED TO BEING ALONE.

234
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,416
WHY IS IT...

235
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,583
WHY IS IT THAT
I FEEL SO LONELY?

236
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,333
( sniffling )

237
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,333
- ( phone ringing )

238
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,791
- Machine:
We are not home right now.

239
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:25,000
Please leave your name
and a brief message

240
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,083
after the beep.
( beeps )

241
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,666
- Aoi: Kaoru-sama.
- HUH?

242
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,458
I apologize for troubling you
while you are away.

243
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,083
- AOI-CHAN!
- Kaoru-sama.

244
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,958
Thank goodness you are home.

245
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,000
- IS SOMETHING WRONG, AOI-CHAN?

246
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:43,375
- Uh, um, Kaoru-sama,
please rescue me.

247
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,458
- HMM? RESCUE YOU?

248
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:51,791
- I-- I HAVE TO SEE YOU AGAIN
AND TELL YOU SOMETHING.

249
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,416
I MANAGED TO ESCAPE
FROM MISS MIYABI,

250
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,166
BUT I SEEM TO HAVE
GOTTEN LOST IN THE PROCESS.

251
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,166
- You escaped?
Where are you right now?

252
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:05,416
- LET'S SEE... I BELIEVE THIS IS
THE STATION WHERE WE FIRST MET.

253
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,333
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE
SO DON'T MOVE AN INCH, OKAY?

254
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:18,041
SHE-- SHE DIDN'T GO HOME YET.

255
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,833
- I HAVE RETURNED HERE.

256
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,250
BUT WHAT IN THE WORLD
SHOULD I SAY TO HIM?

257
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,958
HOW SHOULD I APPROACH HIM?

258
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,166
I AM CERTAIN THAT
I AM BOTHERING HIM.

259
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,666
I AM ULTIMATELY BEING
A NUISANCE TO KAORU-SAMA.

260
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,583
 COMING TO SEE HIM.

261
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,916
NOT ASKING IF I COULD.

262
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,500
AND CALLING HIM OUT HERE TOO.

263
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,833
HE MIGHT NOT FORGIVE ME
FOR BEHAVING THIS WAY.

264
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,791
HE MAY BE VERY ANGRY AT ME.

265
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,291
HE COULD VERY WELL

266
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:15,166
HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO HATE ME.

267
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,625
KAORU-SAMA.

268
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,166
- AOI-CHAN!
- UH?

269
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,750
- ( panting )

270
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,333
- KAORU-SAMA.

271
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,458
UM, UM, I HAD...

272
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:32,458
SOMETHING IMPORTANT
I WANTED TO TELL YOU.

273
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,708
I'VE GIVEN IT QUITE A
LOT OF THOUGHT

274
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,916
AS I WAS WAITING FOR YOU HERE.

275
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,166
AND I REALIZE I MAY
BE A NUISANCE,

276
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,458
BUT EVEN SO, I KNOW THAT
I MUST SAY THIS TO YOU.

277
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,083
AND SO THE TRUTH IS...

278
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,458
I AM SO SORRY.
( sobbing )

279
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,625
- COME ON, LET'S GO HOME.

280
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,750
- ALL RIGHT.

281
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,166
- YOU'RE COLD, RIGHT?
THE BATH'S READY,

282
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,708
SO WHY DON'T YOU GO FIRST?

283
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,833
- I COULDN'T POSSIBLY, WHEN
YOU ARE MUCH MORE WET THAN I.

284
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,291
- UH. ( laughs )
I'M FINE.

285
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,583
SO GO AHEAD.

286
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,291
- KAORU-SAMA?
- YEAH?

287
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:10,041
- ACTUALLY AFTER
BEING SEPARATED,

288
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,625
I'VE GIVEN THIS MUCH THOUGHT,

289
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:16,250
WHAT MISS MIYABI HAD SAID
ABOUT THE SAKURABA FAMILY

290
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:20,500
AND ALSO CONCERNING
MY FATHER AND MOTHER.

291
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:25,416
HOWEVER... HOWEVER
I'VE DECIDED NOW

292
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,791
LIKE YOU I WILL PART WAYS
WITH MY FAMILY!

293
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,291
- ( gasps )
- I WISH TO BE WITH YOU

294
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,916
EVEN IF IT MEANS
THROWING EVERYTHING AWAY.

295
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,291
SO THEREFORE,

296
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,708
I ASK YOU

297
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,125
PLEASE ACCEPT ME
VOWS AND ALL

298
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,166
AND MAKE ME
YOUR WIFE, KAORU-SAMA.

299
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,708
- ( theme music playing )

300
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,500
( singing in Japanese )

301
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,750
- WHAT SHOULD I DO?
I SAID VOWS.

302
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:29,666
HE WILL SEE
EVERYTHING ABOUT ME.

303
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,416
- "AI YORI AOSHI":

304
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,750
LIVING TOGETHER.

305
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:35,666
- Aoi: OH, I CAN HEAR
YOUR HEARTBEAT.
