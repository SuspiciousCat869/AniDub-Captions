PROMISE ME

4
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,083
THAT YOU'LL NEVER
FORGET ABOUT ME.

00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:11,791
I HOPE YOU STAY WELL.

6
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,541
- AOI-CHAN.

7
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,958
- KAORU-SAMA. ( cries )

8
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,750
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO CRY SO MUCH. 

9
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:21,083
YOU'RE COMING BACK TOMORROW.
- THAT'S RIGHT, LADY AOI.

10
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:24,500
IT'S ONLY A NIGHT'S STAY
AND IT'S FOR A MEMORIAL SERVICE.

11
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:28,208
- BUT EVEN SO...
- Taeko: YOUR CAR'S HERE.

12
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,291

00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,333
- ALL RIGHT.

14
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,416
- WELL THEN, SIR KAORU,
WHILE WE ARE AWAY,

15
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,833
I TRUST YOU TO TAKE CARE
OF THINGS HERE.

16
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,333
YOU MAY USE THE MANSION
AS YOU PLEASE.

17
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:42,666
- UH, OKAY.

18
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,125
- KAORU-SAMA.

19
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,916
KAORU-SAMA!

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,583

24
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,666
- OH, ARE YOU DONE
WITH ALL THE DISHES?

25
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,583
- YUP.
- THANKS FOR THE HARD WORK.

26
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,291
- IS TINA-SENPAI
STILL ASLEEP AT THIS HOUR?

27
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,125
- PROBABLY.

28
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,041
- Taeko: EVEN IF SHE DID
MEET UP WITH OLD FRIENDS

29
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:25,291
FROM KYUSHU, DRINKING FIVE
LARGE BOTTLES OF SHOCHU

30
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,833
IS A LITTLE MUCH.

31
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,958
- Kaoru: AND I HEAR THAT TINA
DRANK THE LION'S SHARE TOO.

32
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:34,458
- ( groans ) THE EARTH'S
SPINNING AROUND AT FULL-SPEED.

33
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,166
- YOU THINK
SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT?

34
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,875
SHOULD I GO IN THERE
AND CHECK ON HER?

35
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,583
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT HER.

36
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,041
SHE'LL POP OUT
IN A LITTLE WHILE

37
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,750
AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED
LAST NIGHT.

38
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,250
- I HOPE THAT'S THE CASE.
- ( phone rings )

39
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:48,000
- OH, THE PHONE.
EXCUSE ME FOR A BIT.

40
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,791
- ( phone rings )

41
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,916
- JUST THINKING
THAT AOI-CHAN

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,250
AND MISS MIYABI

43
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,916
MAKES THIS PLACE
SEEM SO HUGE.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,416
- Taeko: WHAT?!

45
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,583
HOLD ON,
THEN DOES THAT MEAN...

46
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,791
WHAT?

47
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,041
IS THAT RIGHT?

48
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,416
YES, I UNDERSTAND.

49
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,833
- ( phone clicks )
- IS SOMETHING GOING ON?

50
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,333
- YES, YOU SEE...

51
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,250
- ALL RIGHT THEN, MINAZUKI!

52
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,000
LET'S GET OUR 
BUTTS IN GEAR!

53
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,666
- SUZUKI AND SATO.

54
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,500
- HOW DID YOU
GET HERE SO FAST?

55
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,375
I JUST HUNG UP
A FEW SECONDS AGO.

56
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,166
- HUH?
THEN YOU MEAN

57
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,791
THAT PHONE CALL
WAS FROM YOU GUYS?

58
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,333
- YEAH, IT SURE WAS.
WE CALLED FROM THE FRONT DOOR.

59
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:35,166
- COME ON, GO CHANGE

60
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,166

61
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,958
- UH, YES, SIR!

62
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:42,250
- WHAT WAS IN THAT BAG, SATO?
AND WHAT ARE YOU GUYS UP TO?

63
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,708
- YOUR AVERAGE, EVERYDAY 
PHOTO SHOOT , THAT'S ALL.

64
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,958
- YOU'RE HAVING A PHOTO SHOOT?
BUT OF WHAT?

65
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:50,250
- ( menacing laughter )

66
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,583
OF THIS BABY!

67
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,250
- A-- A TRAIN, HUH?
- YEAH!

68
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:57,083
CAN YOU BELIEVE A TRAIN
OF THE 165 SERIES

69
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,750
IS RUNNING IN KURASHIKI?

70
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,708
THE MEMORIAL TRAIN SERIES!

71
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:01,958
IS THERE A GUY
IN THE WORLD

72
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,750
WHO ISN'T EXCITED
OVER THIS NEWS?! 

73
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,416
- THERE'S ONE RIGHT HERE.

74
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,458
BUT, SATO, YOU AREN'T
A TRAIN FREAK LIKE SUZUKI,

75
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,416
SO WHY ARE YOU GOING?
- Taeko: UM, VICE CHIEF SATO,

76
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,416
IS THIS ALL RIGHT?
- HUH?

77
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,291
- AWESOME! INCREDIBLE!

78
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,958

79
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,375
- HUH? OH, OKAY.

80
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,250

81
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,500

82
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,250
THE ULTIMATE
IDOL PHOTO SHOOT.

83
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,291
COSPLAYING A ONE-DAY

84
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,208

85
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,791
- YEAH, GET IT NOW?

86
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,541
I'LL BE TAKING PICTURES
OF THE TRAIN.

87
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,125
AND SATO WILL BE TAKING
PICTURES OF OUR STATION CHIEF

88
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,875
AGAINST THE
TRAIN BACKGROUND.

89
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,958
- TAKING A TRIP YOURSELF
IS BORING.

90
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:47,041
THIS IS THE PERFECT WAY
TO TAKE COMPANY ALONG WITH YOU.

91
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,750
- COME ON.  ARE YOU REALLY
TAKING TAEKO-CHAN ALONG

92
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,125
FOR SUCH A SILLY REASON?

93
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,583
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"SILLY REASON"?!

94
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,583
- WELL, GUESS WE
BETTER BE OFF NOW.

95
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,708
- WE'RE GONNA BE BACK
BY TOMORROW.

96
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,208
- HEY, HOLD ON.
- SENPAI, I'M SORRY.

97
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,583
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST STEP

98
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,958
TO BECOMING
A GOOD PHOTOGRAPHER.

99
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,125
- LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE
USING HER AGAIN.

100
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,583
HUH? THEY'LL BE BACK TOMORROW?
IT'S AN OVERNIGHT THING?

101
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,333
HEY, HOLD ON, GUYS!

102
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,291
THAT WAS QUICK.

103
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,416
- ( thunder crashes )

104
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,916
- WHAT WAS THAT?!
IS THIS A JOKE?

105
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,583
- IT'S TRUE.
MY MEMORY-- 

106
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,875
MY MEMORY'S STARTING TO FADE!
- IT CAN'T BE!

107
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:32,375
- AT THIS RATE, I'LL FORGET
ABOUT YOU TOO ONE DAY!

108
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,625
- You can't! I don't want
that to happen, Yoske!

109
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,750
- ( show theme music plays )

110
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,333
- ( clicks )
- I'M SO BORED.

111
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,500
- Tina: GOOD MORNING.

112
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,958
( yawns )
I'M HUNGRY.

113
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:48,250
HEY, MISS LANDLORD, TAE,
WHERE'S THE FOOD?

114
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,083
- THEY'RE NOT HERE.
- THEY AREN'T? HOW COME?

115
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,750
- AOI-CHAN AND MISS MIYABI
WENT TO A FUNERAL.

116
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:57,125
AND TAEKO-CHAN WAS FOOLED INTO
A PHOTO SHOOT IN KURASHIKI.

117
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,916
- OH, IS THAT RIGHT?

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
- THERE'S BREAKFAST FOR YOU.
IT'S IN THE REFRIGERATOR.

119
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,750
- OH, WELL, THEN I GUESS
THAT MEANS

120
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:07,791
THAT WE'RE ALL ALONE IN THIS
HOUSE TODAY, DOESN'T IT KAORU?

121
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,916
- ( nervous mutters )

122
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,166
COME TO THINK OF IT...

123
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:16,750
( heartbeats )

124
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,458
( gulps )

125
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,791
( louder heartbeats )
( gasps )

126
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,208
- WE'RE ALL ALONE NOW.

127
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:28,666
WHAT IS IT, KAORU?

128
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,125
YOUR FACE IS ALL RED,
YOU KNOW?

129
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,250
- UH...

130
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,708
IT-- IT'S NOTHING.
REALLY, TINA.

131
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,416
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
WHAT ARE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT, HUH?

132
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,750
- GEEZ, WHAT AM I THINKING?

133
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,666
THINGS WOULD NEVER
END UP LIKE THAT. 

134
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,916
CALM DOWN.  CALM DOWN.

135
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,958
( nervous laughter )
- HUH?

136
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,458
- ( laughs )
DO YOU WANT OUT?

137
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,625
SORRY, BUT IF I LET YOU OUT
JUST LIKE THAT,

138
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,500
MISS MIYABI WILL
GET REALLY MAD AT ME.

139
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,416
- Tina: KAORU! COME HERE A SEC!
- HUH?

140
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,125
- WHAT'S WRONG, TINA?
GIVING UP ON COOKING?

141
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:07,166
- HEY, NOW THAT WAS A PRETTY
RUDE THING FOR YOU TO SAY.

142
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,375
- WHAT IS IT THEN?
- SORRY, BUT CAN YOU

143
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,375
HELP ME PULL UP MY SLEEVES?
- SLEEVES?

144
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,791
- THEY'RE GONNA GET WET.
COME ON, HURRY.

145
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,791
- YOU'LL HAVE
TO TURN AROUND.

146
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,291
- BUT THEY'RE ABOUT
TO GET WET.

147
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,833
JUST GET BEHIND ME
AND PULL 'EM UP ALREADY.

148
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,916

149
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,750

00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:51,000
THAT'S WHY I WANT TO RING
IT NOW, NO MATTER WHAT.

317
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,333
( strains )

318
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,625
- I KNOW YOU'LL DO
YOUR BEST, TINA.

319
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,458
YOU'RE HERE.
RING THE BELL.

320
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,791
- KAORU.

321
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,791
- WE FINALLY
MADE OUR WAY HERE.

322
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:09,541
- ( giggles )

323
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,750
- GO ON, TINA.

324
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,875
RING THAT BELL ALL YOU WANT.
- HM-HMM.

325
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,750
- ( bell clinks )

326
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,458
- ( claps )

327
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:20,708
I WISH THAT--

328
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,416
THAT THE WHOLE WORLD
WAS HAPPY.

329
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,916
- ( sniggers )
- HUH?

330
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,750
DID IS SAY SOMETHING
THAT WAS FUNNY?

331
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,208
( laughing )
NO, NOT REALLY.

332
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:34,041
( laughs )
- WHAT?

333
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,541
- ( laughing )

334
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,958
- COME ON.  WHAT IS IT?
WHATCHA LAUGHING FOR?

335
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,916
- ( laughing )
- COME ON, KAORU.

336
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,375
- ( continues laughing )
- HEY,

337
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,666
TELL ME WHAT YOU
THINK IS SO FUNNY, KAORU.

338
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:53,375
BUT I HONESTLY DO!
- WHAT WAS THAT?

339
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:56,250
( laughing )

340
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,125
- YOU SURE HAVE CHANGED
A LOT, KAORU.

341
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,250
- HUH?

342
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,666
- WHEN WE GOT TO
KNOW EACH OTHER...

343
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,583
HEY, TOP OF THE MORNING!

344
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,000
- HUH?

345
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,416
( deadpanned )
YEAH, GOOD MORNING.

346
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,583
- Present Tina: BACK THEN,

347
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,500
WELL, YOU SEEMED
KIND OF LONELY,

348
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,125
LIKE YOU DIDN'T WANT TO
LET ANYONE INSIDE YOUR HEART.

349
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,625
THAT'S WHY--

350
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,458
WELL, HONESTLY,
THAT'S WHY I INVITED YOU

351
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,250
TO JOIN THE PHOTO CLUB.
- YEAH?

352
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,333
WAS I REALLY LIKE THAT?

353
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,625
- YOU SURE WERE.  HONEST.

354
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,208
I HAVE BEEN WATCHING YOU
THE WHOLE TIME, KAORU,

355
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,916
SO I SHOULD KNOW.
- HUH?

356
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,291
- I THINK IT'S ALL BECAUSE
YOU MOVED IN HERE.

357
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,958
THE LANDLORD AND MANAGER
ARE BOTH GOOD PEOPLE.

358
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,625
THEY'RE THE TYPE OF FOLKS
THAT MAKE YOU FEEL AT EASE.

359
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,125
AND THEY DON'T EVER
LOOK AT ME FUNNY

360
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,166
JUST BECAUSE
I'M AN AMERICAN.

361
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,000
AND WHENEVER
I'M IN TROUBLE,

362
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,791
THEY REALLY WORRY
ABOUT ME.

363
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,041
JUST LIKE--

364
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:55,791
JUST LIKE WE'RE ALL
A REAL FAMILY.

365
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,291
- FAMILY.

366
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,875
( sad sighs )

367
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:03,333
- Tina: SHE'S AN AMAZING PERSON.
- HUH?

368
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,416
- THE LANDLORD,
SHE IS REALLY KIND.

369
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,583
AND SHE CAN DO
ALL SORTS OF THINGS.

370
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:12,291
SO THAT'S-- THAT'S
A TRADITIONAL JAPANESE BEAUTY.

371
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,333
I WONDER WHAT KIND
OF A LIFESTYLE

372
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,041
YOU WOULD NEED
TO END UP LIKE THAT?

373
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,333
( sighs )

374
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,208
I SOMETIMES WISH I COULD
HAVE BEEN BORN

375
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:23,000
A JAPANESE PERSON
WHO'S LIKE THE LANDLORD.

376
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,958
AND IF I HAD BEEN,
THEN I--

377
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,083
THEN MAYBE
I COULD HAVE...

378
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,875
- HUH? WHAT'S THAT?

379
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,916
- MH-HMM, AWW,
IT WAS NOTHING AT ALL.

380
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,208
( laughs ) WELL,
LET'S DRINK UP, KAORU.

381
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:41,125
- TINA.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

382
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,958
- YEAH! KNOCK IT BACK!

383
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,625
OH, YEAH.  HEY, UZUME.

384
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,166
YOU SHOULD DRINK SOME TOO!

385
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,916
- HEY, COME ON, DON'T TAKE
UZUME OUT OF THE CAGE.

386
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,166
- AWW, DON'T BE
A PARTY POOPER.

387
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,750
- THE RULES ARE THE RULES!
- PARTY POOPER!

388
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,083
I WON'T LET YOU DRINK
IF YOU KEEP TALKING LIKE THAT.

389
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,708
- HEY, THAT'S MY BEER!

390
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:58,916
- ( gulping )
- DAMN IT!

391
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,791
- AHH.  YUM.
( laughs )

392
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:04,666
- ( door opens )

393
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,666
- I'M BACK, EVERYONE.

394
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,875
OH MY GOSH!

395
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,166
( groans )
- ( mutters sleepily )

396
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,583
- OH, WOULD YOU PLEASE 
STOP THAT, TINA-SENPAI?

397
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,958
- ( engine runs )

398
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,916
- Aoi: KAORU-SAMA.

399
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,875
WAKE UP, KAORU-SAMA.

400
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,416
- ( groans )

401
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,041
WELCOME BACK, AOI-CHAN.

402
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,958
- YOU WILL ONLY
CATCH YOURSELF A COLD

403
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,708
IF YOU CONTINUE SLEEPING
OUT HERE ON THE COUCH.

404
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,750
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

405
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,833
- NO, NOT REALLY.

406
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,416
DID TINA GO BACK
TO HER ROOM ALREADY?

407
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,291
- Aoi: UM, ALSO...
- HUH? ( gasps )

408
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,416
- M-- MISS MIYABI.
- SIR KAORU.

409
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,458
- YEAH?
- WHAT IN THE WORLD

410
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:56,541
IS THE MEANING OF THIS?

411
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,958
- TH-- THIS IS...

412
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,458
UZUME?!

413
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,583
- SIR, KAORU, 
I DID TELL YOU

414
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,916
THAT YOU COULD USE
THE MANSION AS YOU PLEASED,

415
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,916
BUT I DID NOT SAY
TO LET UZUME WRECK THE HOUSE!

416
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,875
- I DON'T KNOW
A THING ABOUT THIS.

417
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,333
- DON'T PLAY 
DUMB WITH ME!

418
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:18,708
AS YOUR PUNISHMENT,

419
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,416
I WILL HAVE YOU CLEAN
THIS MESS UP!

420
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,416
AND THEN CLEAN
THE ENTIRE HOUSE!

421
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,458
- WHAT? DO YOU MEAN RIGHT NOW?
- IMMEDIATELY!

422
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:28,250
- NO WAY.
- I'LL BE GLAD TO HELP YOU.

423
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,583
- NO HELP! SO START CLEANING
RIGHT NOW.

424
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,625
- ( sighs )
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

425
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,958
- STOP STALLING AND BEGIN!
- YES, MA'AM.

426
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,541
- PLEASE LET ME GO.

427
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,041
DON'T MESSAGE THAT.
I BEG YOU!

428
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,916
- ( laughing )
- OH, PLEASE, STOP! SENPAI!

429
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,833
- LET'S DRINK
SOME MORE, KAORU.

430
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:55,166
- ( theme music plays )

431
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

432
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:24,666
- Aoi: I MIGHT NOT EVER
BE ABLE TO SEE YOU AGAIN,

433
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,250
KAORU-SAMA.

434
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,708
I'M SO LOST.

435
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:31,916
"AI YORI AOSHI:
LACE OF LEARNING."

436
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,416
I AM ALWAYS...

437
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,833
( cries )
