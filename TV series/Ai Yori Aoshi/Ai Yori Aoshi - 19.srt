1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,541
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:40,958
( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:13,875
- Tina: HEY, TAE, I HEARD SOME
PHOTOS FROM CHIKA JUST ARRIVED.

4
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,083
- Tae: YEAH, WHY DON'T
WE ALL LOOK AT THEM?

5
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:17,916
- ( laughing )
- Tina: LET ME SEE, LET ME SEE!

6
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,416
- Aoi: MY. 
- Kaoru: HOW ARE THEY?

7
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,250
- Tae: THEY'RE ALL GREAT SHOTS,
AREN'T THEY?

8
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,750
- Tina: HEY, LOOK AT
KAORU'S FACE ON THIS ONE.

9
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,666
- Kaoru: THAT SURE WAS A TOUGH
SPOT I WAS IN THAT TIME.

10
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,416
- Aoi: OH, MISS CHIKA.

11
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,333
- Tina: SHE WAS A
NICE SPUNKY GIRL.

12
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,916
- Kaoru: YEAH, I HOPE WE GET
TO PLAY WITH HER AGAIN.

13
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,416
- OH, IT'S A LETTER.
- HUH?

14
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,666
- WHAT?!
- ( train horn blows )

15
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,708
- OH.

16
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,708
OH OH.

17
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,500
CHIKA-CHAN!
- HUH?

18
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,208
( gasps, laughs )

19
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,125
IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE.

20
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:15,458
- WHAT?! YOU'RE NOT DONE
DOING ALL THE HOMEWORK

21
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,625
ASSIGNED TO YOU
OVER SUMMER VACATION YET?

22
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,875
- I WAS HOPING YOU
GUYS COULD HELP ME

23
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,958
WITH JUST THE PLACES I'M HAVING
TROUBLE WITH.

24
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,666
IF THAT'S OKAY?
- THAT WAS IRRESPONSIBLE.

25
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,208
SO WHAT WERE YOU DOING
OVER AT GRANDMA'S THEN?

26
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,000
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DIDN'T
GET YOUR HOMEWORK DONE

27
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,375
AFTER ALL THE TIME YOU HAD.

28
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,791
- BUT I'VE GOT A GOOD EXCUSE.

29
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,083
IT'S BECAUSE WHEN I LEND A HAND
AROUND THE BEACH HOUSE

30
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,250
IT ALWAYS MAKES GRANDMA
REALLY HAPPY.

31
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:39,250
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE HER
EVEN HAPPIER THAN LAST YEAR.

32
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:42,041
IS THAT BAD?
- I GUESS NOT.

33
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,458
- I THANK YOU.

34
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,625
LET ME STAY HERE UNTIL I'M
DONE WITH ALL MY HOMEWORK.

35
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:46,875
PRETTY PLEASE?
OKAY?

36
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,791
- MMM.
- YOU CAN STAY, MISS CHIKA.

37
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:50,875
- HUH?

38
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:51,833
- IF THERE'S ANYTHING
THAT I CAN DO,

39
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,791
PLEASE DO NOT
HESITATE TO ASK.

40
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,541
- YEAH, I DON'T MIND
HELPING OUT EITHER.

41
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:57,958
- JUST CONCENTRATE
ON YOUR HOMEWORK

42
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,666
AND LEAVE THE HARD STUFF TO US.

43
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,041
- OH, THANK YOU.

44
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,000
YOU GUYS ARE THE GREATEST.

45
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:07,000
- THANKS A LOT! YOU'RE
THE GREATEST, BIG BROTHER!

46
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,125
( giggling ) YEAH!

47
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,250
- CHIKA-CHAN, YOU SHOULD BE
THANKING EVERYONE HERE.

48
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,583
- Both: THANK YOU ALL FOR
YOUR HOSPITALITY, EVERYBODY.

49
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,291
- HUH?

50
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,666
( laughs )
AND THANK YOU TOO, UZUME.

51
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,166
- ( squeaks )

52
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,291
- IT'S NICE HERE.
TAEKO'S LUCKY

53
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,708
SHE GETS TO LIVE IN SUCH
A BIG AND BEAUTIFUL HOUSE.

54
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,875
I WONDER WHICH SUBJECT
I SHOULD START WITH.

55
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,208
UHHH, THIS ONE CAN WAIT.

56
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,875
( humming )

57
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,291
- ALL RIGHT,

58
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,708
I'M GONNA START WITH ENGLISH AND
GET THAT OUT OF THE WAY!

59
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,500
- THAT MEANS IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO DO MY THING!

60
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,208
- ( whimpering ) IT'S HERE.
COULD YOU TAKE A LOOK?

61
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,291
I DON'T GET THIS PART
AT ALL, MISS TINA.

62
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:04,333
- HUH? OH, THIS, HUH?
IT'S A PIECE OF CAKE, CHIKA!

63
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,291
THE THREE LEVELS
OF ADJECTIVES:

64
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,291
POSITIVE, COMPARATIVE
AND SUPERLATIVE

65
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,041
IS WHAT THE BOOK'S
TRYING TO SHOW HERE.

66
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,625
"GOOD, BETTER AND BEST"
IS THE EXAMPLE GIVEN.

67
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:16,000
LET ME THINK NOW,
HOW CAN I EXPLAIN THIS BETTER?

68
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,916
A RUNDOWN SHACK, A LOG CABIN,

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,208
THE WHOLE DARN RANCH.

70
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,666
SO, DOES IT MAKE MORE SENSE
TO YOU NOW, CHIKA?

71
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,916
- HELP ME, BIG BROTHER!
ENGLISH IS HARD,

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,166
BUT UNDERSTANDING HOW
PEOPLE FROM HAKATA THINK

73
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,833
IS EVEN HARDER.

74
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,958
- Chika: COME ON IN!

75
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:38,083
- HEY, CHIKA-CHAN, DO YOU
NEED ANY HELP OVER HERE?

76
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,625
- NO THANKS. I'M OKAY.

77
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,541
BUT I MIGHT ASK YOUR HELP
IF I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

78
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,375
- YOU SURE ARE A
GOOD GIRL, AREN'T YOU?

79
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:50,083
- ( thinking ) SHE'S DEFINITELY
TAEKO-CHAN'S COUSIN ALL RIGHT.

80
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,916
SHE WORKS HARD
JUST LIKE HER.

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,416
- SO THAT GOES RIGHT HERE

82
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,458
AND I HAVE TO REMEMBER ABOUT
THIS THING TOO.

83
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,250
- SHE'S REALLY GOING
AT AN INCREDIBLE PACE.

84
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:01,041
AND IT SEEMS SHE'S NOT GETTING
ANYTHING WRONG EITHER.

85
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,833
LOOKS LIKE CHIKA-CHAN'S
A BRIGHT GIRL TO BOOT.

86
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:05,958
- HMMM.

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,541
LOOK AT THIS, BIG BROTHER. I
DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS QUESTION.

88
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,791
COULD YOU EXPLAIN IT?
- NO PROBLEM.

89
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,291
OKAY, LET'S HAVE A LOOK HERE.

90
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,458
AHHH.

91
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,166
HMMM?
- BIG BROTHER!

92
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,416
- HUH?

93
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,958
CHIK-- CHIKA-CHAN!

94
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,875
- WHY DON'T YOU LET ME SCRUB
YOUR BACK FOR YOU, BIG BROTHER?

95
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,791
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I CAN SCRUB MY OWN BACK MYSELF.

96
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:41,541
- WHAT? YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
SHY AROUND ME, BIG BROTHER.

97
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,708
I DON'T MIND HELPING YOU OUT.
- I CAN HANDLE IT,

98
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,833
SO JUST GET OUT, OKAY?

99
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,333
- SEMPAI, IS ANYTHING
WRONG IN HERE?

100
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,916
( gasps ) NO!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

101
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,583
- UH... UH...

102
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,000
- COME ON,

103
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,041
YOU SHOULDN'T BE BOTHERING
HANABISHI-SEMPAI SO MUCH.

104
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,666
( screams )

105
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,666
- ( gasps )

106
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,583
- ( sonar beeps )

107
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,833
- ( Chika screams )

108
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:13,250
- I APOLOGIZE.
- I'M SORRY TOO.

109
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,916
I JUST WANTED TO DO SOMETHING
TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,083
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO THANK ME
FOR ANYTHING.

111
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,083
- ( whimpering ) BUT...

112
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,625
BUT I WAS HAPPY THAT
YOU LOOKED OVER MY HOMEWORK,

113
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,083
THOUGH I GUESS I GOT
A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY.

114
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,541
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THAT.

115
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,083
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
NO HARM DONE.

116
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,875
- ( thinking )
YEAH, BUT THIS MAKES IT

117
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:36,375
THE SECOND TIME THAT HE'S
SEEN ME TOTALLY NAKED.

118
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:39,708
THAT MEANS THAT THERE'S
NO CHOICE BUT FOR ME TO WED HIM

119
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,666
FROM NOW ON.
( sighing )

120
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,791
- Both: HUH?

121
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,416
- TA-DAH!

122
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,791
- ( squeals ) THAT OUTFIT
LOOKS SO CUTE, CHIKA!

123
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,083
- ( laughs )

124
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,916
LOOKS LIKE ME AND TAEKO
ARE TWO OF A KIND, HUH?

125
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,416
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ALL THIS.
I KNOW YOU LIKE TO HELP,

126
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,833
BUT DON'T GO OUT OF YOUR WAY,

127
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,708
BECAUSE YOU SHOULD BE
CONCENTRATING ON YOUR HOMEWORK.

128
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,916
- YEAH, BUT YOU'RE
ALL HELPING ME

129
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,958
BY LOOKING OVER
MY HOMEWORK, RIGHT?

130
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,458
ALL I WANT TO DO
IS RETURN THE FAVOR.

131
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:16,416
BESIDES, IF THE ONLY THING
I DID ALL DAY WAS HOMEWORK,

132
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,291
I'D BE A GIANT BALL OF STRESS.
- ( Taeko laughs ) THAT'S TRUE.

133
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:22,083
- IT'S OKAY WITH YOU,
ISN'T IT, MISS AOI?

134
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,916
- UH, IF THIS IS WHAT
YOU REALLY WANT TO DO,

135
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,583
THEN I SUPPOSE I HAVE
NO OBJECTIONS, MISS CHIKA.

136
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,291
- ALL RIGHT!

137
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,750
( humming )

138
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,583
- YOU'RE REALLY INTO THIS,
AREN'T YOU, CHIKA-CHAN?

139
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:38,791
- YEAH. ( laughs )

140
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,625
- I'LL CLEAN THE WINDOWS
THAT ARE ON THE TOP

141
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,541
SINCE IT'S DANGEROUS
UP THERE.

142
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,916
( gasps )

143
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,250
- TAEKO!

144
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,541
- ( whimpering )

145
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:00,291
- AH... HA HA!

146
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,375
- WOW.

147
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,583
THAT WAS AMAZING, MISS CHIKA.

148
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,583
- ( shouting )

149
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,375
- ( yelps )

150
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,083
( groans )

151
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,875
- OH MY GOSH, YOU'RE NOT HURT,
ARE YOU, MISS TINA?

152
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,708
- WOW, NOW THIS IS SHINY.

153
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,541
YOU DID A GREAT JOB, CHIKA.

154
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,583
- ( laughs ) HEY, MISS TINA,
SINCE I'VE GOT YOU HERE,

155
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,000
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU NEED DONE

156
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,250
THAT YOU'D LIKE ME TO
HELP YOU OUT WITH?

157
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,750
- SOMETHING I NEED DONE?
HMMM...

158
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,166
OH YEAH!

159
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,125
- Chika: A FIGHTING GAME?
- KAORU REALLY SUCKS AT IT.

160
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,625
HE'S NO MATCH FOR ME AT ALL.

161
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,416
- HEY, I'M SITTING RIGHT HERE.

162
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,791
- OKAY, ARE YOU READY?
LET'S GO!

163
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:48,875
- MM-HMM.
- READY? GO!

164
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,041
- ( both groaning )

165
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,500
- Tina: WHOA!
- ( yelping )

166
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,916
- CHIKA-CHAN GOT
A PERFECT VICTORY.

167
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,208
- ALL RIGHT!

168
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:08,125
I WON! ( laughs )
- OH MAN. I WAS SO PATHETIC.

169
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,916
- CHIKA-CHAN, I BET YOU'VE
PLAYED THIS GAME BEFORE,

170
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
HAVEN'T YOU?

171
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,833
- NO, THIS IS
MY FIRST TIME ACTUALLY.

172
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,791
I WAS JUST PUSHING THE BUTTONS
LIKE CRAZY AND I MANAGED TO WIN.

173
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,458
- YOU RANDOMLY PUSHED
THE BUTTONS? ALL RIGHT THEN.

174
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,083
LET'S PLAY ONE MORE,
BUT THIS TIME I'LL BE SERIOUS.

175
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,250
OKAY?
- MM-HMM.

176
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,083
- HEY, THAT'S THE LEGENDARY
SKILL ROBOTIC BOOMERANG!

177
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,750
OH MAN, YOU JUST PULLED OFF
THE SUPER MYSTICAL SKILL

178
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,916
THE FAIRWAY CUTTER.
NO WAY!

179
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,375
HEY WAIT, NO!

180
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,583
( screams )

181
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,333
OKAY, LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN,

182
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,291
BUT THIS TIME I'LL REALLY
PLAY SERIOUSLY.

183
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,708
- SURE, SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

184
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,250
- Tina: HEY, CHIKA, HOLD ON!

185
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,500
- ( Chika laughing )
- ( whimpering )

186
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:55,291
THAT'S THE FORBIDDEN SKILL--
THE ROCKET PLATTER HOLLOWS!

187
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,791
- ALL RIGHTY THEN!
TIME TO DO MY HOMEWORK.

188
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:03,750
OH.

189
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,708
HMM.

190
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,250
( grunts )

191
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,458
I CAN WORK ON THAT ASSIGNMENT
AFTER I FINISH THE OTHERS.

192
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,916
- Miyabi: COME IN.

193
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,083
- EXCUSE ME, MISS MIYABI,
I MADE YOU SOME COFFEE.

194
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,583
- THANK YOU SO MUCH,
MISS CHIKA.

195
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,500
PLEASE LEAVE IT
OVER THERE SOMEWHERE.

196
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,333
- THERE YOU GO.
- THANK YOU.

197
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,208
- OH.

198
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,166
OH.

199
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,791
YOUR JOB MUST KEEP YOU BUSY.
- YES, IT DOES.

200
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:02,083
THE ROOM ALWAYS ENDS UP LOOKING
LIKE THIS ONCE I START WORKING.

201
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,916
- WOULD IT BE OKAY IF I
PUT ALL THESE FILES

202
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,791
BACK WHERE THEY BELONG?

203
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,791
- I REALLY WOULDN'T MIND THAT.

204
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,583
OH, IF IT'S THOSE FILES--

205
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,916
- LET'S SEE NOW.

206
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
THEY OUGHT TO GO ON THIS SHELF.

207
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,000
THEY GO IN ALPHABETICAL
ORDER, RIGHT?

208
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,500
- THAT'S RIGHT, ALPHABETICALLY.

209
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,000
- THEN THESE GO OVER HERE

210
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,833
AND THESE GO OVER THERE.

211
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,791
- ( chuckles )

212
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,750
- SO THEN, MISS CHIKA, HOW IS
YOUR HOMEWORK PROGRESSING?

213
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,500
PLEASE DON'T HESITATE TO ASK US

214
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,458
IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO GET
STUCK SOMEWHERE.

215
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,916
- THANK YOU SO MUCH,
MISS MIYABI.

216
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,083
- HUH?
- ( laughs )

217
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,583
I'M AN ONLY CHILD, YOU KNOW?

218
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,708
SO STAYING HERE LIKE THIS
MAKES ME FEEL LIKE

219
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:49,125
I ACTUALLY DO HAVE
BROTHERS AND SISTERS

220
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,166
AND IT MAKES ME HAPPY
KNOWING THAT.

221
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,083
YOU SEE, I ALWAYS WANTED

222
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:56,250
TO HAVE BROTHERS AND SISTERS
EVER SINCE I WAS LITTLE.

223
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,250
- IS THAT REALLY SO?

224
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,916
- ENJOY YOUR COFFEE,
MISS MIYABI.

225
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,625
I DON'T WANT TO GET IN
THE WAY OF YOUR WORK,

226
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,000
SO I'LL BE GOING NOW.

227
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,041
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO HELP YOU OUT,

228
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,250
PLEASE FEEL FREE TO TELL ME.

229
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,916
- OH, I WILL.

230
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,166
SHE'S A VERY CAPABLE PERSON,
ISN'T SHE?

231
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,416
DELICIOUS.

232
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,166
- THAT'S FROM THE SONGS
OF OLD AND NEW, RIGHT?

233
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,291
IN THIS CASE THE TERM "NAGAAME"
HAS TWO DIFFERENT MEANINGS,

234
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,750
A LONG RAIN AND FEELINGS
FOR A CERTAIN THING.

235
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,708
- OH, I SEE.

236
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,541
ALLEY-OOP.

237
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,166
( sighs, laughs )

238
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,250
- Miyabi: IN OTHER WORDS,
THESE PASSAGEWAYS

239
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,833
PROVE TO BE A MEANS
OF TRANSPORTING

240
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,958
LABOR, GOODS AND MONEY
TO VARIOUS LOCALES IN JAPAN.

241
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,666
IS IT CLEAR TO YOU NOW?
- YEAH.

242
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,666
( grunting )

243
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,541
ALL RIGHT!

244
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,041
I'M ALL DONE NOW.

245
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,625
OH.

246
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,625
( sighs )

247
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,416
I CAN'T PUT IT OFF ANYMORE.

248
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,916
BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT TO WRITE ABOUT.

249
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,166
- ( Aoi humming )

250
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,833
- HMM? MMM!

251
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,708
- WOW, IT SMELLS SO GOOD!

252
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,916
- WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY
A LITTLE TASTE OF IT?

253
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,166
- WHAT? YOU MEAN IT'S OKAY?

254
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,875
- SURE, HERE YOU GO.

255
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,583
- WOW, THIS IS SO
TOTALLY DELICIOUS!

256
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,791
HOW IN THE WORLD DID YOU
MAKE THIS TASTE SO GOOD?

257
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:47,958
PLEASE TELL ME!

258
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,666
PLEASE TELL ME!
- SURE, IF YOU WOULD LIKE.

259
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,250
THE FIRST THING
THAT YOU NEED-- OH.

260
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,583
- IS SOMETHING WRONG, MISS AOI?

261
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:57,416
- OH NO, I FORGOT SOMETHING.

262
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,291
I HAD MEANT TO BUY
SOY SAUCE EARLIER,

263
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,083
BUT IT COMPLETELY
SLIPPED MY MIND.

264
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,458
- THEN WHY DON'T I GO BUY
SOME MORE RIGHT NOW?

265
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,416
- BUT I--
- HEY, I DON'T MIND DOING IT.

266
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,500
YOU JUST HAVE TO TELL ME
WHERE THE STORE IS.

267
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,416
- I APOLOGIZE. I HOPE
IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TROUBLE.

268
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,250
- ( giggles )

269
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,291
I'M GOING NOW!

270
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,125
( groans, stammers )

271
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,291
HUH?

272
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:22,625
- ( squeaks )

273
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,125
- COME ON, UZUME.

274
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,583
I CAN'T BRING YOU ALONG.

275
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,458
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO
BACK HOME AND WAIT FOR ME?

276
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,958
DID YOU REALLY WANT TO GO
OUT WITH ME THAT BADLY?

277
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,541
- ( squeaks )

278
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,750
- I GUESS IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
BUT LISTEN, YOU HAVE TO BE GOOD

279
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,291
AND STAY QUIET IN THERE, OKAY?

280
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,916
WELL, WE'D BETTER HURRY BACK.

281
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,958
I'M SURE MISS AOI'S
WAITING FOR US.

282
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,250
( gasps )
- ( growling )

283
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,208
- ( whimpers )

284
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,708
- ( barks )

285
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,625
- ( squeaks )
- ( barking )

286
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:02,958
- ( squeaks )
- HUH?

287
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,291
UZUME!

288
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,500
THIS IS TERRIBLE.
UZUME!

289
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,083
WHERE ARE YOU?

290
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,583
UZUME?

291
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,291
- OH, KAORU-SAMA.
- HMM?

292
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,500
HEY, AOI-CHAN,
I'M BACK NOW.

293
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,750
- KAORU-SAMA, DID YOU SEE
MISS CHIKA WHILE YOU WERE OUT?

294
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,375
- CHIKA-CHAN?

295
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:23,875
- Tae: YOU WERE AT
THE BOOK STORE

296
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,875
ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE
STATION, WEREN'T YOU, SEMPAI?

297
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,375
- DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?
- YES, I'M AFRAID.

298
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,000
MISS CHIKA WENT
OUT TO THE MARKET

299
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,833
TO RUN A SHOPPING ERRAND FOR ME,

300
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,291
BUT SHE STILL HASN'T
RETURNED HOME YET.

301
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,166
AND IT'S BEEN A VERY LONG TIME
SINCE SHE LEFT FOR THE MARKET.

302
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,916
- IT LOOKS LIKE SHE WENT
TO THE SHOPPING STRIP

303
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,250
OVER BY THE TRAIN STATION.

304
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,250
- I SEE. I'M SURE I DIDN'T
SEE HER AROUND THOUGH.

305
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,583
- Tae: MAYBE SHE
GOT LOST AFTER ALL.

306
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,333
- Miyabi:
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT HER.

307
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:48,625
- AND SO AM I.

308
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,125
I'LL LOOK FOR HER.
- Aoi: THEN I WILL AS WELL.

309
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,791
- Tina: SO WILL I.
- Tae: ME TOO!

310
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,875
- HOLD ON! IF EVERYONE
GOES OUT LOOKING FOR HER,

311
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,000
THEN WHAT WILL WE DO
SHOULD SHE RETURN HERE?

312
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:01,541
( sighs ) I SUPPOSE IT'S MY DUTY
TO WAIT HERE JUST IN CASE.

313
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,750
- Chika: UZUME!

314
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,291
UZUME!

315
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,083
( sighs )

316
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,875
WHERE DID YOU GO TO?

317
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,916
UZUME.
( grunts )

318
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

319
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,625
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN
UZUME SHOPPING WITH ME.

320
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,833
I'M SURE THAT THEY'LL
ALL BE ANGRY.

321
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,375
THEY'LL PROBABLY
NEVER FORGIVE ME

322
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,291
AND MAYBE THEY'LL
EVEN HATE ME NOW.

323
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:38,583
NO, I DON'T WANT THAT.

324
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,125
( sobs )
I DON'T!

325
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,875
UZUME, UZUME!

326
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,708
- ( squeaks )

327
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,750
- ( gasps ) UZUME?

328
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,208
UZUME!

329
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,291
UZUME, OH THANK GOODNESS.

330
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,833
THANK GOODNESS.

331
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,666
OH, UZUME.

332
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,250
- Kaoru: CHIKA-CHAN!

333
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,166
- BIG BROTHER.

334
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,125
- ( running, panting )

335
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,291
- YOU REALLY HAD
ALL OF US WORRIED.

336
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,458
- I'M JUST GLAD YOU DIDN'T
GET YOURSELF INVOLVED

337
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:25,083
IN AN ACCIDENT OR SOMETHING ELSE
HORRIBLE LIKE THAT.

338
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,541
- I HOPE YOU DON'T EVER DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS AGAIN.

339
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,333
YOU SCARED US NEARLY
HALF TO DEATH.

340
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,750
- I'M REALLY SORRY.

341
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,833
- NEXT TIME, IF YOU FIND
YOURSELF IN A SIMILAR SITUATION,

342
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,625
PLEASE DO NOT
HESITATE TO CONTACT US

343
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,000
AT ONCE AND ASK FOR HELP.

344
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,958
- MISS AOI!

345
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,250
- AFTER ALL,
WE'RE NOT ALL RELATED,

346
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,416
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
WE'RE NOT A FAMILY.

347
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
- A FAMILY?

348
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:52,083
- Aoi: THAT'S RIGHT.
WE ALL LIVE UNDER ONE ROOF.

349
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:56,291
WE EAT OUR MEALS TOGETHER.
WE GO TO SLEEP AT THE SAME TIME.

350
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:59,208
AND WE SHARE EVERY ASPECT
OF OUR LIVES WITH ONE ANOTHER,

351
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,250
FROM THE FUN TIMES
TO THE SAD.

352
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:04,125
ISN'T THAT THE KINDS OF THINGS
THAT FAMILIES DO?

353
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,208
WELL THEN, MISS CHIKA,

354
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:12,083
SHALL WE ALL GO NOW BACK TO
THE PLACE WE ALL CALL HOME?

355
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,208
- SURE!
( chuckles )

356
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:20,125
Chika's voice: "AND SO, EVEN
THOUGH I WAS BORN AN ONLY CHILD,

357
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,958
I HAVE LOTS OF SISTERS
AND ONE BROTHER NOW.

358
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,791
I HAVE A SISTER
WHO'S A GREAT COOK,

359
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,583
A SISTER WHO'S ALWAYS
FULL OF ENERGY,

360
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,375
A SISTER WHO ALWAYS
TRIES HER BEST,

361
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,500
A SISTER WHO'S VERY CAPABLE,

362
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:35,583
AND...

363
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,958
A REALLY GENTLE BROTHER.

364
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,541
THIS SUMMER VACATION TURNED OUT

365
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:48,791
TO BE ONE THAT I DON'T THINK
I'LL EVER BE ABLE TO FORGET."

366
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,375
ALL RIGHT!

367
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,750
I'M FINALLY DONE
WITH ALL MY HOMEWORK!

368
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,166
- Kaoru: SHH.
- HUH?

369
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,666
- ( snoring softly )

370
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,083
- WHAT?

371
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,166
I CAN'T BELIEVE TAEKO'S
ALREADY ASLEEP.

372
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,000
- SHE'S PROBABLY EXHAUSTED.

373
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,666
SHE'S ALWAYS TRYING
TO DO HER BEST

374
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,833
AT EVERYTHING DAY AFTER DAY.

375
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,958
WOULD YOU LIKE TO LAY DOWN
FOR A WHILE TOO?

376
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,583
- AH, YEAH.

377
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,458
HEY, BIG BROTHER?
- HMM?

378
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,416
- DO YOU THINK YOU COULD KEEP
YOUR HAND ON MY HEAD?

379
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,750
- SURE, IF YOU WANT.

380
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,583
- I LIKE YOUR HAND THERE,
BIG BROTHER.

381
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,416
IT FEELS REALLY NICE.

382
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,916
- ( chuckles )

383
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,583
- Chika: THIS IS
A REALLY GREAT PLACE.

384
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:48,166
ISN'T IT, BIG BROTHER?
YOU AND ALL THE BIG SISTERS,

385
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,791
YOU'RE ALL SO KIND
AND SO FUN TO BE WITH.

386
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,666
I LOVE YOU ALL SO MUCH.

387
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,500
- I SEE. FEEL FREE TO COME BY
WHENEVER YOU'D LIKE TO.

388
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,916
BECAUSE WE LOVE YOU, CHIKA-CHAN,
AND WE LOVE HAVING YOU.

389
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,625
- AND I LOVE-- AND I LOVE
YOU TOO, BIG BROTHER.

390
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,333
I LOVE YOU A LOT.

391
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,791
THANKS FOR TAKING CARE OF ME!
SEE YA!

392
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,250
IT WAS NICE SPENDING TIME
WITH YOU ALL.

393
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,416
I'LL COME VISIT AGAIN SOON.
- SEE YOU SOON.

394
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,791
- YOU'RE WELCOME TO STOP BY
WHENEVER YOU'D LIKE.

395
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,708
- I WANT A REMATCH
WHEN YOU'RE HERE AGAIN!

396
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,500
- SEE YOU AGAIN SOON!

397
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,791
SEE YOU AGAIN SOON!
TAKE CARE!

398
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,125
- GOODNESS.

399
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:39,250
BUT I HAVE TO WONDER--

400
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,208
PERHAPS THIS MEANS THAT
WE WILL BE HAVING

401
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,958
ANOTHER TENANT STAYING
WITH US SOON.

402
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,958
- ( laughs )

403
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,333
I SUPPOSE WE COULD.

404
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,291
- ( theme music playing )

405
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,166
( singing in Japanese )

406
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,250
- Aoi: TEA CEREMONIES ARE
A REFLECTION OF THE HEART.

407
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:26,583
AND EVERYTHING IS TIED
TO ONE'S HEART.

408
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:29,583
MISS MIYABI TOLD ME THAT ONCE.

409
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:32,958
AI YORI AOSHI,
"CURE."

410
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,083
PLEASE HAVE SOME TEA.
