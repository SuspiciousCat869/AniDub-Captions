1
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,125
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:41,166
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,416
- Tina: THE SEASON IS SUMMER!

4
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,875
SUMMER MEANS BEACHES.

5
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:06,791
BEACHES MEANS SWIMSUITS!
STAY WITH ME NOW.

6
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,083
FOLLOWING THAT
TRAIN OF THOUGHT,

7
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,583
IT ONLY MAKES SENSE
FOR US GALS

8
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:11,291
TO HAVE THAT ONE
SPECIAL SWIMSUIT

9
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,750
JUST IN CASE
WE GO TO THE BEACH.

10
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,916
- IS THAT REALLY SO?
- IT'S BEST NOT

11
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,583
TO TAKE HER SERIOUSLY, LADY AOI.

12
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,500
- COME ON, GIRLS! LET'S GO!

13
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:21,083
- I HOPE THEY HAVE A LOT OF CUTE
SWIMSUITS AT THE STORE.

14
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,916
ISN'T THIS EXCITING,
MISS MIYABI?

15
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,625
- IF I WERE BUYING
A SWIMSUIT, PERHAPS.

16
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:26,875
- WHAT? YOU MEAN
YOU WON'T BE BUYING ONE?

17
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,333
- Tina: MISS LANDLORD.

18
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,083
WHAT YOU DOING OVER THERE?

19
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:39,166
- OH, I APOLOGIZE.

20
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,875
- Tina: WHAT THE HECK WERE
YOU DOING, MISS LANDLORD? 

21
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,083
- Mayu: ( sighs )

22
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,000
I WONDER WHICH ONE
OF THESE SWIMSUITS

23
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,041
HANABISHI-SAMA 
WILL LIKE BEST.

24
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,750
I THINK THIS ONE
LOOKS NICE,

25
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,125
BUT I'M SOMEWHAT PARTIAL
TO THIS ONE TOO.

26
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,583
- Tina: PARDON ME, MA'AM.
- HUH?

27
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,625
- A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL
SUCH AS YOURSELF

28
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,416
WOULD LOOK MUCH BETTER
IN A SWIMSUIT LIKE THIS ONE.

29
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,833
- WHY THANK YOU.

30
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,166
HANABISHI-SAMA'S HEART
WILL BE MINE WITHOUT A DOUBT

31
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,500
ONCE HE SEES ME
IN THIS SWIMSUIT.

32
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,916
MY, WHAT A WONDERFUL DESIGN.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,625
IT'S SIMPLICITY
SEEMS TO BRING OUT

34
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,583
MY OWN NATURAL BEAUTY
IN SOME WAY.

35
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:24,750
WAIT?!

36
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,875
WHY I AM I WEARING 
A SCHOOL SWIMSUIT?!

37
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,416
- GOOD AFTERNOON, MISS MAYU.

38
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,250
- DID YOU COME HERE TO BUY
A SWIMSUIT, TODAY, TOO?

39
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,666
- HEY, YOU LOOK
GREAT IN THAT. 

40
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,541
- ( grumbles )

41
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,333
- JUST LIKE I THOUGHT YOU WOULD.

42
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,750
THAT OUGHT TO BE GOOD ENOUGH
FOR A BRAT LIKE YOU.

43
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,458
- THAT'S ENOUGH! WHY
DON'T YOU STOP INTERFERING?

44
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:41,791
- HEY, I WAS TRYING
TO HELP YOU OUT

45
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,000
IN CASE YOU
DIDN'T NOTICE!

46
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,250
- WHO SAID YOUR ASSISTANCE
WAS NECESSARY?!

47
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,625
- WELL, PARDON ME FOR GIVING
YOU MY HONEST OPINION.

48
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,833
- EXCUSE ME.
I'M SORRY,

49
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,750
BUT I THINK YOU'RE DISTURBING
OUR OTHER CUSTOMERS.

50
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,583
SO WHY DON'T YOU ALL
GO TO THE CHANGING ROOMS

51
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,375
AND TRY ON SOME SWIMWEAR?
- YEAH, THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

52
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,166
- NO, THANK YOU.
I WON'T BE--

53
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,708
- Both: I'LL TAKE
A LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE!

54
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,833
- WELL, HOW'S THIS
FOR A MATURE LOOK?

55
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,375
I'LL BE THE HEROINE
OF THE BEACH IN THIS.

56
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,958
- HOW UTTERLY GAUCHE.

57
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,666
THIS ONE IS MUCH MORE ELEGANT
IN COMPARISON.

58
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,791
EVERY EYE ON THE BEACH
WILL BE ON ME.

59
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,250
- ( both growl )

60
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,250
- THIS ONE'S WAY COOLER.

61
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,791
- BUT NOT NEARLY AS ADORABLE
AS THIS ONE.

62
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,916
- SEXY'S THE WAY TO GO.

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
- BUT THIS SWIMSUIT
IS OBVIOUSLY THE BEST OF ALL.

64
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:26,250
- NOT TOO SHABBY, KID.
- MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY.

65
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,916
- Taeko: WHAT?!
THIS IS THE ONLY ONE?!

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,500
- YES, I'LL HAVE
TO APOLOGIZE.

67
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,458
BUT PLEASE UNDERSTAND.
CONSIDERING YOUR SIZE...

68
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,416
- ( groans )

69
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,791
I GUESS SO.

70
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,666
- BUT IT DOES LOOK 
REALLY GOOD ON YOU.

71
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,250
I ENVY THE LUCKY MAN WHO'LL
BE GOING TO THE BEACH WITH YOU.

72
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,708
- HUH?
- ( both laughing )

73
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,791
- WHY'D I THINK OF HIM?!

74
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,750
WHA-AH-AH-AH!

75
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,291
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

76
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,125
THAT'S NOT
THE CASE AT ALL!

77
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,541
OH, I'M SO EMBARRASSED!

78
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,625
- ( both sigh )

79
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,041
- THE BEACH.
I WISH KAORU-SAMA

80
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,416
AND I COULD ENJOY
SOME TIME ALONE AT ONE.

81
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,750
OH MY!

82
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,291
HUH?

83
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,416
- SUMMER ISN'T SUMMER

84
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
WITHOUT BREAKING OPEN
A WATERMELON.

85
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,458
- ( sighs )

86
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:19,875
HUH?

87
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,541
- Tina: KAORU!

88
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,791
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

89
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,708
DON'T I LOOK WAY BETTER
THAN THAT BRAT, HUH?

90
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,333
- MAYU'S UNMISTAKABLY THE ONE
WHO LOOKS THE BEST HERE,

91
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,250
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
HANABISHI-SAMA?

92
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,541
- EXCUSE ME, WHY AM I
A PART OF THIS.

93
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,125
- WELL, UH... I THINK
ALL THREE OF YOU

94
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,625
LOOK GREAT
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

95
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,583
- Tina: OH, KAORU!
- Mayu: HANABISHI-SAMA!

96
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:50,666
- Miyabi: OH, I FORGOT TO
MENTION THIS, MISS MINAZUKI,

97
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,375
BUT YOUR GRANDMOTHER
SENT YOU A POSTCARD.

98
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,458
- Taeko: A POSTCARD
FROM GRANDMA?

99
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,958
- I ACTUALLY BOUGHT IT.

100
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,541
I WONDER IF IT'LL
LOOK GOOD ON ME.

101
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,541
- Tina: ( laughing )
- ( gasps )

102
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,666
( screams )

103
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,958
- DID YOU HEAR,
MISS LANDLORD?

104
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,916
THE BEACH! THE BEACH!
THE BEACH! THE BEACH!

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,375
- WHAT?
- THE BEACH! ( laughs )

106
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,833
WATER, WAVES, AND SUN!
- MUST SHE BE SO ANNOYING?

107
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,333
- WHAT IS MISS TINA
SO EXCITED ABOUT?

108
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,291
- OH, WELL,
ACTUALLY, AOI-CHAN--

109
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,083
- TAE'S GRANDMA SENT
HER A POSTCARD

110
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,333
THAT'S GOT SOME GREAT NEWS.
- HAVE A LOOK.

111
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:42,250
- MY, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.

112
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,500
- THIS PICTURE
MUST HAVE BEEN TAKEN

113
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:44,583
SOMEWHERE NEAR 
THE BEACH HOUSE

114
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:45,833
THAT MY GRANDMOTHER RUNS.

115
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,083
- OH, A BEACH HOUSE?

116
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,375
- TAKE A LOOK AT
WHAT MY GRANDMA WROTE.

117
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,958
- Tina: THE BEACH!
THE BEACH!

118
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,416
IT'S THE BEACH!

119
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,833
- HONESTLY, SUCH ENTHUSIASM
FOR SO SIMPLE A JOY...

120
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:01,166
- LOOK AT YOURSELF
BEFORE OPENING YOUR MOUTH!

121
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,083
YOU'RE MORE EXCITED ABOUT THIS
THAN I AM, GEEZ.

122
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,416
RIGHT, MISS MANAGER?

123
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,875
MISS MANAGER?
- HUH?

124
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,166
OH, YES, THAT'S TRUE,
MISS TINA.

125
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,708
( nervous laugh )

126
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:17,375
- AREN'T YOU GLAD 
WE CAME, AOI-CHAN?

127
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,250
- I AM.  IT'S NICE HERE.

128
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,583
( gasps )
- ( girls giggles )

129
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,250
- ( panting )
HUH?

130
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:27,250
TAEKO!
- HUH?

131
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,208
- IT REALLY IS YOU.

132
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,000
TAEKO!

133
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,250
- OH, CHIKA-CHAN.
- ( pants )

134
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,250
- OH!
- IT'S BEEN SUCH A LONG TIME

135
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,583
SINCE I'VE SEEN YOU, TAEKO.

136
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,875
I WAS HOPING THAT YOU'D
VISIT US AGAIN THIS YEAR.

137
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,750
- YOU'RE AS LIVELY AS EVER,
AREN'T YOU?

138
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,833
AND IS IT ME
OR HAVE YOU GROWN A BIT?

139
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,625
- I ACTUALLY GREW ALMOST TWO
INCHES TALLER THIS PAST YEAR.

140
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,000
YEAH! HUH?
- WOW, GREAT.

141
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,083
OH, I SHOULD INTRODUCE YOU.

142
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,250
THIS YOUNG LADY HERE IS--

143
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,250
- HER COUSIN,
CHIKA MINAZUKI.

144
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,666
NICE TO MEET YOU.
- NICE TO MEET YOU TOO.

145
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,083
- OH!

146
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,291
THIS GUY'S GOT TO BE
YOUR BOYFRIEND, RIGHT, TAEKO?

147
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:05,125
- ( waves crash )

148
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,041
- CH-- CH-- CH-- CH--
CHIKI-CHAN!

149
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,583
- KA-- KAORU-SAMA IS--

150
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,083
THAT IS HE AND I ARE--

151
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,791
- NO, IT ISN'T
LIKE THAT AT ALL.

152
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,625
- WHAT THE HECK YOU
TALKING ABOUT, LITTLE MISSY?!

153
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,041
- THE ONLY PERSON THAT
HANABISHI-SAMA'S FOND OF IS ME!

154
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,083
- LOOKS LIKE YOUR BOYFRIEND
SURE IS POPULAR

155
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,958
WITH THE GIRLS, ISN'T HE?
- IT ISN'T LIKE THAT!

156
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,416
- Chika: HEY, TAEKO'S HERE.

157
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,875
- HI, THERE.  IT'S BEEN
A WHILE, GRANDMA.

158
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,291
- OH, I'M GLAD THAT
YOU DECIDED TO VISIT.

159
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,750
YOU'VE BEEN AWAY SO LONG

160
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,583
THAT YOU'RE STARTING
TO LOOK LIKE A FOREIGNER.

161
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,291
- ( screaming )

162
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,375
- I GUESS IT'S TRUE
WHAT THEY SAY

163
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,125
ABOUT GIRLS CHANGING A LOT
WHEN YOU DON'T SEE THEM.

164
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:44,416
- GRANDMA, I'M OVER HERE.
- I'M JUST KIDDING.

165
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,583
THINGS'LL BE LIVELY THIS YEAR
WITH ALL THESE FRIENDS HERE. 

166
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:48,916
AND WHAT'S THIS?

167
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,541
YOU HAVE YOUR HUSBAND
WITH YOU.

168
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:54,250
- ( wails ) I CAN'T
TAKE THIS ANYMORE. 

169
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,083
- ( bell rings )

170
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,666
- LET'S GO TAKE A DIP.
- HOLD ON!

171
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,666
- HANABISHI-SAMA WILL BE
ENJOYING THE WATER

172
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,583
WITH ME FIRST.

173
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,250
- HERE.

174
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,875
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR THE DRINKS.

175
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,250
- TAE-CHAN, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO HELP ME OUT HERE.

176
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,750
GO AND HAVE FUN
WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

177
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,333
- OH, BUT--

178
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,291
- YOU'RE ALL HERE TO
ENJOY YOURSELVES.

179
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,833
SO THAT'S WHAT
YOU SHOULD DO.

180
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,208
- YEAH, GRANDMA'S RIGHT.

181
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,541
SO WHY DON'T WE GO OUT
ONTO THE BEACH AND PLAY?

182
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,958
- OH, WELL, ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO.

183
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,416
- YIPPEE! COME ON.
HURRY UP AND GET CHANGED.

184
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,916
- OKAY, OKAY, DON'T TUG
ON MY ARM SO HARD.

185
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,250
- Tina: WHOOHOO!
ARE YOU HAVING

186
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,000
AS MUCH FUN AS I AM, KAORU?

187
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,750
WELL, ARE YOU?

188
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,208
- ( gargles )

189
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,208
YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?!
- WHOOHOO!

190
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,583
I'M FLYING.

191
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,333
- AWW, I HAVE A CRAMP
IN MY LEG.

192
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,541
I'M IN DESPERATE NEED
OF RESCUE.

193
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,875
- HEY, DON'T WRAP
YOUR LEGS AROUND ME.

194
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,458
- ( moans )

195
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,916
- DON'T THINK I DON'T SEE
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PULL HERE!

196
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,125
- NOW, NOW.
- AND WHY ARE YOU TRYING

197
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,125
INTERFERE WITH
MY SUMMER LOVE STORY?

198
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:55,000
- LOVE STORY?! LOOKS MORE LIKE
A BAD ROMANCE NOVEL TO ME!

199
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,208
- YOU STAY OUT OF THIS.
SUMMER CALLS

200
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:58,666
FOR A MORE AGGRESSIVE APPROACH.

201
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,708
- THEY SURE ARE FIGHTING

202
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,458
LIKE CATS AND DOGS
OVER YOUR GUY.

203
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,916
SHOULDN'T YOU BE IN THERE
FIGHTING FOR HIM, TAEKO? 

204
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,833
- I-- I'M NOT INVOLVED--

205
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,291
- SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA LET THEM
STEAL YOUR BOYFRIEND?

206
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,916
- I TOLD YOU.
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

207
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,458
- YEAH, YEAH,
JUST GET IN THERE.

208
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,083
- ( screams )

209
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,833
- ( splashes )
- ( arguing continues )

210
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,000
- KAORU, HELP!
I'M GONNA DIE!

211
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,708
WILL ANYBODY HELP?!

212
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,458
- Chika: I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THAT, TAEKO.

213
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,125
I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP.

214
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,583
- YEAH, I KNOW.

215
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:32,458
- ( loud arguing continues )

216
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,583
- YOU WANT TO MAKE
SOMETHING OF IT?! 

217
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,458
- GET OUT OF MY WAY!
- MAKE ME!

218
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,583
- ( sighs ) I'M HOPELESS.

219
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,458
- Guy #1:
HEY, THERE, CUTIE.

220
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:41,833
ARE YOU HERE
ALL BY YOURSELF?

221
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,375
- FEEL LIKE HAVING
A LITTLE FUN WITH US?

222
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:47,500
- OH, UH, ACTUALLY,
I'M HERE, UH...

223
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,083
- WHOA.
- COME ON, BABY.

224
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,333
LET'S DO SOMETHING TOGETHER.
- ( gasps )

225
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,541
UH, I'M NOT REALLY
INTERESTED.

226
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,541
- LOOKS LIKE SHE'S GOT MORE GUYS
HANGING OFF HER AGAIN.

227
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,458
SHE SHOULD JUST LEARN
TO TELL THEM OFF.

228
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,750
I GUESS I HAVE NO CHOICE.

229
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:01,916
HUH?

230
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,833
- TAEKO-CHAN!

231
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:04,916
- HMM?

232
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,916
- HEY, TAEKO-CHAN.

233
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
- SENPAI.

234
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:12,458
- I BROUGHT A FRISBEE
ALONG WITH ME, TAEKO-CHAN.

235
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,666
WHY DON'T
WE TOSS IT AROUND?

236
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,833
- Guy #1: DAMN, SHE'S HERE
WITH A GUY.

237
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,666
- WELL, WE JUST HAVE
TO FIND ANOTHER ONE.

238
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,625
- COME ON, LET'S GO PLAY
WITH THE OTHERS.

239
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,166
- SENPAI.

240
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,625
- ( giggles )
- Kaoru: CHIKA-CHAN!

241
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,083
YOU WANT TO TOSS AROUND
THE OLD FRISBEE WITH US?

242
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,791
- SURE!
( laughs )

243
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,250
- LADY AOI.

244
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,375
ARE YOU REALLY SATISFIED
WITH JUST SITTING HERE? 

245
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:42,041
YOU'VE COME TO THE BEACH
WITH SIR KAORU, AFTER ALL.

246
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,583
- ( gasps )
OH, I'M ALL RIGHT, REALLY.

247
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,916
I DIDN'T EVEN
BRING A SWIMSUIT.

248
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,458
- OH, IS THAT SO?

249
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,000
- ( bell rings )

250
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,625
- I LIED TO MISS MIYABI.

251
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,500
BUT IT'S JUST THAT
I'M EMBARRASSED

252
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,333
ABOUT WEARING A BATHING SUIT
IN FRONT OF OTHERS.

253
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,791
- ( grunts )

254
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,916
PLEASE BE PATIENT, LADY AOI.

255
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,833
WE'LL BE ABLE TO ENJOY
SUMMER TOGETHER SOON. 

256
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,000
AH!

257
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,833
AHH AHH AHH AHH.

258
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,958
MY SUMMER, WAIT FOR ME!

259
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:32,916
- I WISH I COULD PLAY LIKE THAT
WITHOUT WORRYING SO MUCH.

260
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,583
RIGHT, UZUME?

261
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,583
- ( bell rings )

262
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,416
- AWW, YOU FELL ASLEEP.

263
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,583
( gasps )

264
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,125
CHIKA-CHAN.

265
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,458
- I SURPRISED YOU, HUH?

266
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,250
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
FOR SPACING OUT LIKE THAT.

267
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,416
HERE YOU GO.

268
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,458
- OH, THANK YOU.

269
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,583
- YOU KNOW,
IT REALLY IS SORRY.

270
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,000
- HUH?
- BEING SO SHY LIKE THAT.

271
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,375
AND NOT BEING ABLE TO SHOW
TRUE FEELINGS WELL.

272
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,708
JUST SEEING THAT MAKES ME
TOTALLY CRAZY.

273
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,916
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

274
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,250
SHE HASN'T CHANGED ONE BIT
AT ALL, THAT TAEKO.

275
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,250
- OH, MISS TAEKO.

276
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,083
- SHE'S GOT TO BE
MORE AGGRESSIVE.

277
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,166
IF SHE ISN'T, SHE CAN'T
CATCH THE HEART

278
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,125
OF THE PERSON
SHE REALLY LIKES.

279
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,666
THAT'S WHAT I READ
IN A MAGAZINE.

280
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,750
IN ANY CASE, THE POINT'S TO
KEEP PUSHING FORWARD IN ROMANCE.

281
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,791
- THAT'S TRUE.
- OH, YEAH!

282
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,416
- Aoi:
THE PERSON YOU LIKE...

283
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,291
- DID THAT THING HIT YOU,
AOI-CHAN?

284
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,583
- HERE, KAORU-SAMA.

285
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,000
- THANK A LOT.
SORRY ABOUT THAT,

286
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,541
BUT TINA REALLY PUT
ALL OF HER STRENGTH

287
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:49,958
INTO THAT LAST THROW.

288
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:53,041
HEY, AREN'T YOU GOING
TO SWIM, AOI-CHAN?

289
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,916
- WELL, I'M EMBARRASSED

290
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,208
ABOUT BEING SO BARE
IN FRONT OF OTHERS.

291
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,791
- I SEE.

292
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:06,041
WELL, THAT'S A LITTLE
DISAPPOINTING.

293
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,666
I WAS KIND OF
LOOKING FORWARD

294
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,708
TO SEEING YOU WEAR
A BATHING SUIT.

295
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,166
- ( heartbeats )

296
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,333
- Miyabi: ARE YOU
REALLY SATISFIED?

297
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,750
- KEEP PUSHING FORWARD
IN ROMANCE.

298
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,458
- AH, KAORU-SAMA.
( gasps )

299
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,041
- DON'T RUN OFF, KAORU!

300
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,041
- OUR SWEET AND PASSIONATE
LOVE STORY

301
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,500
IS ONLY JUST BEGINNING,
HANABISHI-SAMA.

302
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,458
- HEY, WOULD YOU
LET ME GO, ALREADY?!

303
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,625
- ( grunts )

304
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,208
I'M NOT LETTING MY SUMMER
SLIP AWAY THAT EASILY!

305
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,958
HUH, HUH?

306
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,333
- ( bell rings )

307
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,333
- HERE, HANABISHI-SAMA.

308
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,833
SAY AHH.

309
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,291
- IT-- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I CAN EAT BY MYSELF.

310
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,750
- COME ON, KAORU!
FORGET ABOUT EATING.

311
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,125
WHY DON'T WE
DRINK SOME MORE?

312
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,791
THE SAKE THEY MAKE AROUND HERE
IS PRETTY GOOD.

313
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,458
- Chika: MORE PLEASE.
- WHAT?

314
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,041
BUT THAT'S
YOUR FOURTH BOWL.

315
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,250
- ( giggles )
FOOD JUST TASTES BETTER

316
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,875
WHEN THERE'S LOTS
OF PEOPLE AROUND.

317
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,333
- TAEKO-CHAN.
- HUH?

318
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,166
- I COULD USE A LITTLE BIT
MORE RICE TOO.

319
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,083
- OH, SURE.

320
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,583
- HANABISHI-SAMA.
- KAORU!

321
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,291
- OKAY, OKAY.
- HERE, SEMPAI.

322
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,166
- THANKS, TAEKO-CHAN.
( gasps )

323
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,625
- I HOPE IT'S ENOUGH.

324
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,041
- COME ON, HE'D GET
A STOMACHACHE

325
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,791
IF HE ATE
THAT MUCH RICE, TAE.

326
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,375
- I'M SORRY.
- IT'S OKAY, TAEKO-CHAN.

327
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,583
I WAS HUNGRY ANYWAY.

328
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,833
- Tina: YOU'RE SUCH
A NICE GUY, KAORU. 

329
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,541
- Chika: HEY, TAEKO,
YOU'RE BLUSHING!

330
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,416
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR THE DINNER.

331
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,958
- COULD YOU
GET MORE SAKE?

332
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,000
- ( overlapping chatter )
- I WILL GO TAKE A BATH.

333
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,166
- I WAS KINDA
LOOKING FORWARD

334
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,291
TO SEEING YOU WEAR
A BATHING SUIT.

335
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,916
- WHY IS IT THAT I CANNOT
GATHER ENOUGH COURAGE

336
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,125
TO WEAR A SIMPLE
BATHING SUIT?

337
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,000
MISS MIYABI?

338
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:28,500
- ARE YOU SATISFIED
WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE?

339
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,166
- IT'S JUST--

340
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,041
IT'S JUST THAT I--

341
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,083
- OH, BY THE WAY,

342
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,583
I'VE HEARD SOME TALK REGARDING

343
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,125
A WONDERFUL SECTION
OF THE BEACH

344
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,708
THAT ONLY THE LOCALS
KNOW ABOUT.

345
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:46,166
IT'S APPARENTLY VERY ROMANTIC
DURING THE NIGHTTIME.

346
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,583
OH, WELL, IN ANY CASE,

347
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,791
I SUPPOSE THAT'S NEITHER
HERE NOR THERE.

348
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,583
- MISS MIYABI.

349
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,458
- ( clears throat )
BUT PLEASE,

350
00:16:57,541 --> 00:17:00,083
BE ABSOLUTELY SURE
NOT TO RETURN TOO LATE.

351
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,500
- RIGHT.

352
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,583
- ( snores )

353
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,583
- GEEZ, SHE REALLY
HAS TO LEARN

354
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,416
TO STOP PARTYING
UNTIL SHE DROPS.

355
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,250
- ( sneezes, whimpers )
- ( mutters sleepily )

356
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,083
- ( door slides )

357
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,791
- KAORU-SAMA.

358
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,750
- AOI-CHAN?

359
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,250
IS SOMETHING WRONG, AOI-CHAN?

360
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,791
- WELL, ACTUALLY-- 
- YEAH, WHAT IS IT?

361
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,958
- WELL...

362
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,708
THE BEACH.

363
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:40,916
- THE BEACH?

364
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,625
- COULD WE GO
TO THE BEACH NOW?

365
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,958
- ( sighs )

366
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,125
OH! OH, THAT HURT.

367
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,041
- YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT
YOUR ALL, TAEKO.

368
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,750
RUSH FORWARD WHEN
YOU'RE IN LOVE.

369
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,125
- GEEZ, WHAT KIND OF DREAM
IS SHE HAVING?

370
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,166
HUH?

371
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,083
THIS IS SENPAI'S SWEATSHIRT.

372
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,250
WHAT IS THIS,

373
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,833
THIS STRANGE FEELING?

374
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:28,916
- COULD YOU STAY STILL
FOR JUST A SHORT MOMENT?

375
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,333
I WONDER IF I COULD'VE
GOTTEN THE TWO OF US LOST.

376
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,833
- WOW.

377
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,208
IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL HERE.

378
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,291
- IT IS.

379
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,458
SAY, KAORU-SAMA.

380
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:07,625
- YEAH?

381
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:10,083
- I WOULD LIKE YOU
TO LOOK AT SOMETHING,

382
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,583
JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

383
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,125
- ( clothes rustle )

384
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,541
- WHAT?

385
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,416
AOI-CHAN!

386
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,125
WAIT, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

387
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:40,000
- KAORU-SAMA, WELL,
HOW DO YOU THINK I LOOK?

388
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,208
EXCUSE ME?

389
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,625
KAORU-SAMA?
- HUH?

390
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,458
OH, I'M SORRY.

391
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,083
I GUESS I COULDN'T
TAKE MY EYES OFF YOU,

392
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,416
SINCE I-- THAT IS,
SINCE YOU

393
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,958
LOOK EVEN BETTER
IN A SWIMSUIT

394
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,416
THAN I THOUGHT POSSIBLE.

395
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,583
SORRY, MY HEART'S RACING.

396
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,958
I CAN'T PUT IT
INTO WORDS WELL.

397
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,333
- I'M SO HAPPY TO HEAR

398
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,416
YOU LIKE HOW I LOOK 
IN THIS, KAORU-SAMA.

399
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,541
THIS AFTERNOON,

400
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,333
WHEN I WAS WATCHING YOU ALL
ENJOYING YOURSELVES,

401
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,666
I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT
I FELT A LITTLE JEALOUS.

402
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,833
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE
TO JOIN YOU.

403
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,791
PLEASE FORGIVE ME,
KAORU-SAMA.

404
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,958
- SHALL WE SWIM?

405
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,750
COME ON OVER, AOI-CHAN.

406
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,916
- BUT, KAORU-SAMA, YOU DON'T
HAVE YOUR SWIMSUIT.

407
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,250
- I'M FINE IN THIS.
- BUT STILL--

408
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,625
- IT'S OKAY.  COME ON.

409
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,000
- SURE.

410
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,000
( gasps )
- AOI-CHAN!

411
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,333
- ( both laugh )

412
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:58,458
- I GUESS I WON'T BE NEEDING
THIS T-SHIRT ANYMORE.

413
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,416
- BUT, UM, KAORU-SAMA.

414
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,541
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

415
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,541
AS LONG AS YOU'RE
THE ONLY ONE HERE

416
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,083
WHO CAN SEE IT,
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

417
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,083
- ME TOO.

418
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,625
IT'S ALL RIGHT AS LONG
AS YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

419
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,500
WHO SEES ME LIKE THIS,
KAORU-SAMA.

420
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,125
- AOI-CHAN.

421
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,291
- KAORU-SAMA.

422
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:55,250
- ( theme music playing )

423
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

424
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,916
- Taeko: THE HAND THAT HELPS ME
THROUGH HARD TIMES

425
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
IS SO KIND... TO ME.

426
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,333
SENPAI IS...

427
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:32,291
"AI YORI AOSHI--
WAVES."

428
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:35,250
SENPAI, I...
