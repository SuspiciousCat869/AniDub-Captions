1
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:34,250
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,375
- THAT SURE WAS
A SURPRISE, THOUGH.

4
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:09,333
THAT GIRL KISSING
HANABISHI SENPAI.

5
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:10,583
- THERE WAS A GIRL?

6
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:13,625
- HANABISHI-SAMA IS
 STAYING WITH MAYU.

7
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,625
- MAYU-CHAN.

8
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,833
- KAORU-SAMA...

9
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:22,541
WHAT IN THE WORLD IS
GOING ON HERE?

10
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,083
KAORU-SAMA!

11
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,541
- ( glass shatters )

12
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,083
- Mayu:
ALL RIGHT, HANABISHI-SAMA,

13
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,750
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

14
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,083
- OKAY.

15
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,708
I'M GOING AHEAD THEN.

16
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,041
- WAIT.  NOT SO FAST.

17
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,916
BE PATIENT
A LITTLE LONGER.

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,583
- UH-- OKAY.

19
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,416
- ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD.

20
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,750
- ARE YOU SURE?

21
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,375
- YES, I'M SURE.

22
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,916
- LET'S GO.

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,583
- NO!

24
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,250
DON'T TAKE THAT CARD THERE!

25
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,083
- WHA-- UH.

26
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,083
ALL RIGHT, THIS ONE.

27
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,583
- HOW LUCKY!

28
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,291
YOU JUST TOOK
THE JOKER AWAY!

29
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,625
NOW IT'S MAYU'S TURN
TO PICK A CARD.

30
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,250
- HMM?

31
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,583
- LET'S SEE, LET'S SEE.

32
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,416
WHICH ONE SHOULD IT BE?

33
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,416
( giggles )

34
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,583
HURRAY!  I'M OUT NOW!

35
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:10,750
- ( laughing )

36
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,416
LOOKS LIKE I LOST
ANOTHER GAME.

37
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,416
- ALL RIGHT, WHY DON'T
WE PLAY ANOTHER MATCH?

38
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,250
- YOU MEAN YOU REALLY
WANNA PLAY AGAIN?

39
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,500
- OF COURSE I DO!

40
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:21,916
- YOU KNOW, YOU SURE HAVE
A LOT OF DOLLS IN YOUR ROOM.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,666
- EVER SINCE I WAS LITTLE

42
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,083
AND BEGGED MY FATHER FOR A DOLL
THAT I SAW ONE TIME,

43
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,250
HE'S ALWAYS BOUGHT ME DOLLS
OR PLUSH TOYS

44
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,125
AS BIRTHDAY PRESENTS
OR AS SOUVENIRS.

45
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,625
THAT ONE WAS FOR
MY EIGHTH BIRTHDAY.

46
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,916
THAT ONE ON THE LEFT WAS
FOR MY 11th.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,625
AND THAT ONE WAS
FOR MY 14th.

48
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,166
EACH ONE WAS A GIFT
I RECEIVED FROM MY FATHER.

49
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,208
MAYU IS NO LONGER
A CHILD, THOUGH. 

50
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,916
- SHALL WE SLEEP NOW?

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,916
- SURE!

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,416
- SO, WHAT ABOUT ME?

53
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,250
UM, WHICH ROOM AM I
SUPPOSED TO BE SLEEPING IN?

54
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,958
- ( giggles )
THIS ROOM HERE.

55
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,291
- I-- I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

56
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,958
AAH!
- DON'T BE THAT WAY!

57
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,291
MAYU WANTS TO SLEEP
IN THE SAME ROOM WITH YOU.

58
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,583
PLEASE, HANABISHI-SAMA,
WON'T YOU?

59
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,125
- COME ON NOW,
 TAKE IT EASY.

60
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,291
- LADY AOI?
- HUH?

61
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,250
- YOU'RE STILL UP 
AT THIS LATE HOUR?

62
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,583
- YES, I APOLOGIZE.

63
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,333
I'LL GO TO SLEEP NOW.

64
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,166
GOOD NIGHT.

65
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,458
- LADY AOI...

66
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,708
- ( giggles ) THANK YOU
FOR STAYING, HANABISHI-SAMA.

67
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,375
- THIS IS ONLY UNTIL
YOU FALL ASLEEP.

68
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,541
- SURE.

69
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,208
- THEN I'M TURNING
THE LIGHTS OFF.

70
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,541
- ( beeps )

71
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,875
- I'M SORRY.
- HUH?

72
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,875
- MAYU IS BEING
A SELFISH GIRL AGAIN,

73
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,458
AND IT ONLY TROUBLED YOU
IN THE END.

74
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,333
- THAT REALLY ISN'T
THE CASE AT ALL.

75
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,500
- HANABISHI-SAMA,

76
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,333
MAYU IS A BAD GIRL,

77
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,166
SO SCOLD ME
WHEN I DO BAD THINGS.

78
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,625
- MAYU-CHAN.

79
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,250
NOW MAYU-CHAN,
YOU'RE NOT A BAD GIRL, OKAY?

80
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,916
SO PLEASE GO TO SLEEP.

81
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,750
- ALL RIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT, HANABISHI-SAMA.

82
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,041
SLEEP WELL, RABI.

83
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,208
- HUH?

84
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,208
RABI?

85
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,875
SHE STILL KEPT IT CLOSE
ALL THIS TIME?

86
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,666
- ( crowd chattering )

87
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,083
- HERE YOU GO, MAYU.

88
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,416
IT'S THE RABBIT
THAT YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED.

89
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,250
- ( giggles )
THANKS SO MUCH, PAPA!

90
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,125
- YOU HAVE WONDERFUL TASTE,
DEAR.

91
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,208
- YOU DON'T TURN 12
TILL NEXT WEEK,

92
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,041
BUT WE'LL HAVE TO GIVE YOU YOUR
BIRTHDAY PRESENT A LITTLE EARLY.

93
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:39,625
- HUH? THEN WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN TO MAYU'S BIRTHDAY PARTY?

94
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,250
- WE'RE VERY SORRY, MAYU.

95
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,208
- IT'S UNFORTUNATE
CIRCUMSTANCES.

96
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,375
BOTH YOUR FATHER AND I

97
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,125
HAVE TO TRAVEL
OVERSEAS TOMORROW.

98
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:49,458
- I THINK THAT I CAN RETURN
IN ABOUT TWO MONTHS THIS TIME.

99
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,625
- WE'LL HOLD THE PARTY
WHEN WE'RE ALL TOGETHER AGAIN.

100
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,833
- NO WAY, IF WE DID THAT,

101
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,708
IT WOULDN'T BE A BIRTHDAY
PARTY AT ALL.

102
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,041
- THIS IS IMPORTANT BUSINESS,
MAYU-CHAN.

103
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,250
- TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

104
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,000
- YEAH, BUT...

105
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,791
OKAY.  I UNDERSTAND.

106
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,791
- MR. MIYUKI.
- OH, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

107
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,750
- IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE
SEEING YOU AROUND.

108
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,000
- WELL, I COULDN'T MISS

109
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,375
ONE OF MIYUKI TRADING'S
LEGENDARY PARTIES.

110
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,041
- NO NO, DON'T FORGET--
THIS IS A GROUP EFFORT.

111
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,333
- MAY I GET YOU
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

112
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:27,333
- OH, YOU'RE GOING TO SPOIL ME
ROTTEN ONE DAY, MRS. MIYUKI.

113
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,333
- ( all laughing )
- MAYBE IT'S TOO LATE.

114
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,416
- HEY, PAPA,
MAYU HAS A STORY!

115
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,166
IT HAPPENED THE OTHER DAY
AT SCHOOL.

116
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,833
- I'M SORRY, MAYU.

117
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,666
I'LL BE HAPPY TO LISTEN
TO ALL OF THE DETAILS LATER.

118
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,333
LET'S TALK SOMEWHERE QUIETER.

119
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,291
- ( sighs )

120
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,250
- ( laughs )
THAT CERTAINLY IS TRUE.

121
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,208
- MAMA?  MAMA MAMA!

122
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,041
DID YOU KNOW THAT MAYU
GOT A PERFECT SCORE

123
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,375
ON THE LAST JAPANESE TEST?

124
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,041
MAMA!

125
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,458
- PARDON ME.
I'LL JUST BE A MOMENT.

126
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,125
YOUR MOTHER IS BUSY HAVING

127
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,958
A VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION
RIGHT NOW, MAYU-CHAN.

128
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,291
WHY DON'T YOU SIT QUIETLY
SOMEWHERE AND DRINK THIS?

129
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,791
- OF COURSE, I HOPE
WE CAN KEEP WORKING TOGETHER.

130
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,708
- WE'D LIKE TO INVITE YOU
TO DINNER IF YOU HAVE TIME.

131
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,666
- ( party guests chattering )

132
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,166
- MAYU.
- ( gasps )

133
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,166
- YOUR SCHOOL'S CHAIRMAN IS
WITH US TODAY.

134
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,666
COME SAY HELLO TO HIM.

135
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,833
WHAT ARE YOU BEING 
SO QUIET FOR, MAYU?

136
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,083
IT'S ONLY A SIMPLE HELLO.

137
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,250
- ( whimpering )

138
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,416
- MAYU.
- ( gasps )

139
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,916
( sobbing )
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,416
- MAYU, COME BACK.

141
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,916
- I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.

142
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,208
PLEASE FORGIVE OUR DAUGHTER
FOR HER RASH BEHAVIOR.

143
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,458
- IT'S FINE.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

144
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,958
- ( sobbing )

145
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,000
- THIS...
- ( gasps )

146
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,500
- ...IS YOURS, RIGHT?

147
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,000
- I DON'T THINK SO.

148
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,500
- BUT ISN'T THIS THE DOLL
YOU DROPPED EARLIER?

149
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,166
- I TOLD YOU
IT'S NOT MINE!

150
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,250
PAPA BOUGHT IT
'CAUSE HE WANTED TO!

151
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,916
IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH ME!

152
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,458
- ( cartoon voice )
HI, THERE.

153
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:47,500
- UH--

154
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:49,875
- THAT'S WEIRD.

155
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,041
NO ANSWER.

156
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,625
ONE MORE TIME THEN.

157
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,000
HI, THERE!

158
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,833
GEE.

159
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,708
YOU SEEM KINDA DOWN.

160
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,500
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
AROUND HERE ANYWAY?

161
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,083
- NOTHING MUCH.
- HMM.

162
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:06,250
OH, YEAH, I STILL HAVEN'T
INTRODUCED MYSELF, HUH?

163
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,916
HOW DO YOU DO?
MY NAME IS RABI.

164
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,291
RABI THE RABBIT.
LET'S GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

165
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,916
- ( giggles softly )
WHAT A FUNNY NAME.

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,375
- ( giggles )

167
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,875
HEY, AREN'T YOU GONNA TELL ME
WHAT YOUR NAME IS?

168
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,041
- MAYU.

169
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,666
MAYU MIYUKI.

170
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,083
- MAYU-CHAN, HUH?

171
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,583
THAT'S A NICE NAME.

172
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:27,583
YOU KNOW, MAYU-CHAN,
I'M ALL THE WAY OUT HERE

173
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,416
BECAUSE I WANNA PLAY WITH YOU.

174
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,125
YOUR PAPA PICKED ME OUT
OF ALL MY FRIENDS IN THE STORE,

175
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,333
AND I'M GLAD HE DID

176
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,000
BECAUSE YOU SEEM LIKE YOU'RE
A DECENT PERSON.

177
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,833
AND I'M SURE THAT YOUR PAPA'S
A REAL NICE PERSON TOO.

178
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:45,166
'CAUSE HE'S THE ONE
WHO PICKED ME, AFTER ALL.

179
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,416
- I HATE PAPA.

180
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,666
- YOU HATE HIM?
AND WHY'S THAT?

181
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,583
- THIS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE SEEN HIM IN SIX MONTHS,

182
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,458
AND HE'S NOT EVEN
TALKING TO ME.

183
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,625
HE'S NOT COMING TO MAYU'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY, EITHER.

184
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,041
ALL MY FRIENDS' MAMAS
AND PAPAS CELEBRATE

185
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,375
THEIR BIRTHDAY PARTIES
WITH THEM.

186
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,833
AND THEY ALL GET CHEERED ON 
DURING THEIR PIANO RECITALS.

187
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,416
MAYU'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO NEVER DOES.

188
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,583
PAPA AND MAMA NEVER TRY
TO DO ANYTHING WITH MAYU.

189
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,125
THEY DON'T CARE
ABOUT MAYU AT ALL!

190
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,000
- ( wind gusts )

191
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,208
- ( normal voice )
I'M JEALOUS.

192
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,291
- HUH?

193
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,291
- I'M JEALOUS, MAYU-CHAN.

194
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,041
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
A PAPA AND MAMA.

195
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,541
- WHAT ABOUT
YOUR PAPA AND MAMA?

196
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:32,666
- THEY'RE NOT AROUND.

197
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,333
- THEY'RE NOT?
THEN DOES THAT MEAN

198
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,333
THAT THEY'RE OVERSEAS?
AMERICA?  CANADA?

199
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,208
- NO.
FARTHER AWAY THAN THAT.

200
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:42,083
- SO THEY'RE IN FRANCE.
OH, I KNOW, IN ENGLAND.

201
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,250
- NO, FARTHER THAN THAT.

202
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:47,541
THEY'VE GONE MUCH MUCH
FARTHER AWAY.

203
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:51,375
- REALLY?
THEY'RE MUCH MUCH FARTHER AWAY?

204
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,916
THAT WOULD BE...

205
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,583
- I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO SEE
MY MAMA OR PAPA.

206
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,083
EVER AGAIN.

207
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,458
THAT'S WHY I CAN SAY THIS.

208
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:02,625
BECAUSE I WAS ALWAYS ALONE.

209
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,541
BEING ALONE IS REALLY SAD.

210
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:08,958
IT'S TOUGH AND LONELY.

211
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,041
BUT, MAYU-CHAN,

212
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,916
YOUR PAPA AND MAMA
CARE DEEPLY ABOUT YOU.

213
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,916
THE TRUTH IS THEY LOVE YOU MORE
THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THIS WORLD.

214
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,875
SO, PLEASE, MAYU-CHAN,

215
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,291
YOU SHOULDN'T HATE 
YOUR PAPA AND MAMA.

216
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,583
RIGHT, MAYU-CHAN?

217
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,125
- ( crying )

218
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,750
( sobbing )

219
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,916
- WELL, SEE YOU, MAYU-CHAN.

220
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,916
- YOU'RE GONNA COME VISIT
MAYU AGAIN, AREN'T YOU?

221
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,625
I'LL SEE YOU, RIGHT?
- OF COURSE.  I'LL COME AGAIN.

222
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,916
- MAYU WILL BE
WAITING FOR YOU, UH...

223
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,416
- ( laughs )
MY NAME'S KAORU.

224
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,583
KAORU HANABISHI.

225
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,125
- HANABISHI-SAMA...

226
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:07,791
- OH, BROTHER.

227
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,000
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO LEAVE NOW?

228
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,916
- HANABISHI-SAMA.

229
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:26,291
- ( both groaning )

230
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,958
- WHAT THE HECK'S WRONG
WITH THOSE TWO?

231
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,041
- Taeko: TINA SENPAI HAS
A MASSIVE HANGOVER.

232
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,541
- Sato: AND HANABISHI?

233
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,291
- HE DIDN'T GET MUCH SLEEP.

234
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,875
- NOT ENOUGH SLEEP?

235
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,500
- HANABISHI SENPAI STAYED OVER
AT THAT GIRL'S HOUSE LAST NIGHT.

236
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,000
REMEMBER? WOW!

237
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,458
WE CAN'T TAKE OUR EYES OFF
YOU FOR A SECOND, SENPAI.

238
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,916
- KAORU!

239
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,125
- WHAT?

240
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,916
- WHAT DID YOU AND THAT GIRL
DO LAST NIGHT?

241
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,833
- ( bell tolls )
- AAH!

242
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,166
MY HEAD'S GONNA SPLIT OPEN.

243
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,333
I'M DYING.
- JEEZ.

244
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:58,500
BUT IT'S A GOOD THING THAT
MAYU-CHAN DIDN'T COME TODAY.

245
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,500
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A BIG MESS IF SHE HAD.

246
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,083
- NO!

247
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:07,041
I WANNA GO TO UNIVERSITY
WITH HANABISHI-SAMA!

248
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,750
- YOUR VERY FIRST CLASS WILL NOT
BE STARTING UNTIL NEXT WEEK,

249
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,125
MAYU-SAMA.

250
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,541
- I SAID RELEASE ME!
I'M GOING WITH HANABISHI-SAMA!

251
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,750
AND THAT'S THAT!

252
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,250
- ( chuckles )

253
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,250
- OH, WASN'T THAT SUSPICIOUS?

254
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,750
- WHAT?

255
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,458
- SO SOMETHING DID HAPPEN LAST
NIGHT WITH HER, DIDN'T IT?

256
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,166
- IS THAT REALLY TRUE,
HANABISHI?!

257
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,625
- NO, IT ISN'T.
I SWEAR.

258
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:25,583
( grunts )

259
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:26,708
- KAORU!

260
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,291
- ( bell tolling )

261
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,333
- OH!  AAH!

262
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,958
- JEEZ, WHAT WAS THAT
ALL ABOUT?

263
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,416
OH, YEAH, I'D BETTER GO
CALL AOI-CHAN.

264
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,916
- ( birds chirping )

265
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
- ( sighs )

266
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,000
- I SEE.
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

267
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,041
THEN I THINK THAT
IT'S PROBABLY BEST

268
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,333
THAT WE GO OVER THE
BUDGET ONE MORE TIME.

269
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,458
YES, BUT COULD YOU
HOLD ON A MOMENT? 

270
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:58,625
- ( beeps )

271
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,375
- YOU'RE CORRECT.
IT IS POSSIBLE TO

272
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,250
MANAGE THE SAPPORO BRANCH
IN THAT MANNER.

273
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,250
- ( beeping )

274
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,583
- THE LINE'S BEEN BUSY
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME NOW.

275
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,583
- TV female announcer:
  IT'S TIME ONCE AGAIN

276
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,083
FOR SMILEY COOKING!
TODAY WE'LL BE SHOWING YOU

277
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:16,250
HOW TO MAKE A WONDERFUL 
FISH DISH, AS WELL AS...

278
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,875
- ( yawns )

279
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,541
( softly groans )

280
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,708
- WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A GANOID
FISH AT THE PEAK OF ITS SEASON!

281
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,750
IT'S CALLED KISU.

282
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,750
( echoing )
KISS...

283
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,708
- KISSES ARE AT
THE PEAK OF THEIR SEASON?

284
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:32,583
- KISSING HANABISHI SENPAI
OUT OF NOWHERE.

285
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,250
- SORRY, BUT I'LL BE
STAYING OVER

286
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,916
AT MY ACQUAINTANCE'S HOUSE
TONIGHT.

287
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,916
- I WONDER WHAT KIND OF PERSON
THIS ACQUAINTANCE IS.

288
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,083
AND LAST NIGHT, DID THEY...?

289
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,750
OH, MY!
WHAT AM I THINKING?

290
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:49,083
NO, IT IS AT TIMES LIKE THESE
THAT ONE MUST PERSEVERE.

291
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,166
ALL RIGHT, I WILL
DO SOME LAUNDRY

292
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,541
AND TAKE MY MIND OFF OF THINGS.

293
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,000
- ( door opens )
- I'M HOME!

294
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,125
- MISS TINA?

295
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,583
- SAY, SENPAI?
- HMM?

296
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:05,041
- SENPAI, WHEN EXACTLY DID YOU
HAVE YOUR VERY FIRST KISS?

297
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,791
- WHAT?  THAT WAS A PRETTY
SUDDEN THING TO ASK.

298
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,500
- SO HOW OLD WERE YOU, ANYWAY?

299
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,125
- I REALLY DON'T REMEMBER.

300
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,541
- ( gasps ) COULD IT BE
THAT IT WAS YESTERDAY?

301
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,166
- JEEZ, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?!

302
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,500
THAT WASN'T A KISS;
THAT WAS JUST A LITTLE GREETING.

303
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,458
MAYU-CHAN SAID SO HERSELF,
DIDN'T SHE?

304
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,458
- YEAH. BUT DO YOU REALLY THINK

305
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:22,791
IF NORMAL GIRLS
HEARD YOU SAY THAT,

306
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,458
THEY'D THINK THAT WAY?
- HUH?

307
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,125
- EVEN IF IT WAS A GREETING,

308
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,833
IF SOME GIRL KISSED
MY BOYFRIEND,

309
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,458
I JUST DON'T THINK THAT
I'D BE ABLE TO CONTAIN MYSELF.

310
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,833
- UH--

311
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,458
SHE'S RIGHT ABOUT THE KISS.

312
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,416
I COULDN'T HELP IT.

313
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,041
BUT IT'S TRUE THAT WE KISSED.

314
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:41,000
MAYBE I SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO HER.

315
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:44,333
BUT AOI-CHAN DOESN'T KNOW
ABOUT THIS YET.

316
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:47,125
SO I SHOULDN'T BRING IT UP
OUT OF THE BLUE.

317
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,875
- WELL, I'D BETTER GO CHANGE

318
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,625
AND GET TO WORK.
- SURE.

319
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,916
NO.  I SHOULD TELL HER.

320
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,500
IT'S FOR THE BEST.

321
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,250
- I'M HAPPY TO WELCOME YOU BACK,
KAORU-SAMA.

322
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,083
- UH--

323
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,916
YEAH, GOOD TO BE BACK.

324
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,916
- DINNER WILL BE READY
MOMENTARILY.

325
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,250
- UH, OKAY.

326
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,625
UH, AOI-CHAN?

327
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,458
- YES?  WHAT IS IT?

328
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,875
- OH.  UH, WELL...

329
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,583
I-- I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING.

330
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,916
- YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY?
TO ME?

331
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,750
WHAT IS IT EXACTLY?

332
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,416
- WELL, THIS IS SOMETHING...

333
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,041
THAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY.

334
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,041
- YESTERDAY, WAS IT?

335
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,083
- YEAH.

336
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,583
HONESTLY--
- KAORU!  ( laughs )

337
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,958
- DON'T TELL ME YOU'VE BEEN
DRINKING AGAIN, TINA.

338
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,166
- SORRY I'M SO LATE.

339
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,458
- KAORU-SAMA, I'M AFRAID
I'M STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF

340
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,625
PREPARING DINNER, SO I'LL
LISTEN TO YOUR STORY LATER.

341
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,833
- OH, UH UH--

342
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,791
- COME ON,
YOU DRINK TOO, KAORU!

343
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,666
UH, I CAN'T DRINK
ANOTHER DROP.

344
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,166
- I THINK YOU'VE DRUNK ENOUGH
FOR TODAY, TINA.

345
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,083
( sighs )

346
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,750
I GUESS I CAN WAIT
UNTIL SHE'S DONE CLEANING.

347
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,875
- ( groans )

348
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,291
ALL RIGHT THEN,
COME ON, KAORU!

349
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,291
- HMM?

350
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,291
- HOW ABOUT
A LITTLE KISS, HUH?

351
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,583
- ( spits )

352
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,791
- WHY NOT?! YOU KISSED
THAT OTHER GIRL BEFORE,

353
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:19,166
SO WHY CAN'T YOU KISS ME NOW?
- SHUT UP, YOU IDIOT!

354
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,791
- COME ON, IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE ANYTHING

355
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,125
FROM HAVING A KISS OR TWO.

356
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,500
ALL I WANT IS ONE. YOU
DIDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM

357
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:28,666
KISSING THAT OTHER GIRL.

358
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,416
- HEY, WAIT!
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO HER.

359
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,333
SHE DID IT TO ME!
MAYU-CHAN SAID SO HERSELF.

360
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,375
AND IT WAS JUST
AS A GREETING, REMEMBER?

361
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:38,291
- THEN WHY DON'T YOU
 GREET ME TOO?  OOH.

362
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,916
- THAT'S NOT THE POINT, TINA!

363
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
- OH, I SEE.
FINE THEN!

364
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,750
I DON'T CARE ANYMORE IF YOU
WANNA KISS ME OR NOT, KAORU!

365
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,750
I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO GO
KISS THE LANDLORD THEN,

366
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,416
AND I'LL KISS THE MANAGER TOO!

367
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,083
- WHAT'S THE POINT OF THAT?

368
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,250
- I'M GONNA GO DO IT
WITH TAE TOO!

369
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,208
- HEY, COME ON!  TINA!

370
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:01,083
THAT SMILE EARLIER
SURE WAS PAINFUL TO SEE.

371
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,416
( sighs )
WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW?

372
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,041
I THINK THINGS MIGHT BE STARTING

373
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,041
TO SPIN COMPLETELY OUT
OF MY CONTROL.

374
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,541
- THAT'S HORRIBLE.
I EXIST ONLY FOR YOU,

375
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,041
AND YET YOU STILL GO OFF
AND KISS SOMEBODY ELSE? 

376
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,916
AND YOU ALSO SPENT THE NIGHT
AT HER HOUSE

377
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,750
DOING WHO-KNOWS-WHAT.

378
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,375
I ASK THAT YOU PLEASE FORGET
THIS ENGAGEMENT EVER HAPPENED!

379
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,250
- ( sighs )

380
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,708
- KAORU-SAMA?

381
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,666
- UH.  AOI-CHAN.

382
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,291
- YOU HAD SOMETHING TO SAY?

383
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,041
ABOUT YESTERDAY.

384
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,375
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT
YOU MENTIONED EARLIER.

385
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:39,041
- YE-- YEAH, I DID,
DIDN'T I?

386
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,208
WE-- WELL, HOW DO I PUT THIS?

387
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,333
YOU SEE...

388
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,250
AOI-CHAN, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

389
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,375
THE ACQUAINTANCE
THAT I BUMPED INTO YESTERDAY,

390
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,541
SHE'S LIKE A LITTLE SISTER
TO ME.

391
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:52,583
THE KISS...

392
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,666
IT'S TRUE.
THE KISS DID HAPPEN.

393
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,833
BUT SHE HAD JUST COME BACK
FROM OVERSEAS,

394
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,625
AND THE KISS WAS ONLY
A GREETING.

395
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,458
PLUS, THE REASON I STAYED OVER
AT HER HOUSE

396
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:06,125
WAS BECAUSE SHE SEEMED
REALLY LONELY ALL BY HERSELF.

397
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,208
BUT NOTHING WEIRD HAPPENED
WHILE I WAS THERE.

398
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,375
WELL, I GUESS YOU COULD CALL
A KISS SOMETHING WEIRD,

399
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,416
BUT STILL...

400
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,958
- EVEN IF IT WAS A GREETING,

401
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,625
IF SOME GIRL KISSED
MY BOYFRIEND,

402
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,541
I JUST DON'T THINK THAT
I'D BE ABLE TO CONTAIN MYSELF.

403
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:30,625
- I'M SORRY.

404
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,500
I REALLY AM SORRY.

405
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,083
- KAORU-SAMA.

406
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:40,166
PLEASE, I ASK THAT YOU NOT
APOLOGIZE FOR WHAT HAPPENED.

407
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:44,125
WHEN YOU APOLOGIZE LIKE THIS,
ALL THAT IT DOES...

408
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,333
IS FILL MY HEART
WITH FEELINGS OF SORROW.

409
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,166
NO ONE UNDERSTANDS YOU,

410
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,708
OR UNDERSTANDS YOUR FEELINGS
MORE FULLY THAN I DO,

411
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,500
KAORU-SAMA.

412
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,000
NO MATTER WHAT MAY HAPPEN,
I BELIEVE IN YOU,

413
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,375
AND I ALWAYS WILL.

414
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,750
SO, PLEASE, I ASK YOU,

415
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,750
DON'T EVER APOLOGIZE.

416
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,125
- AOI-CHAN.

417
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:17,625
- KAORU-SAMA,

418
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,666
THE NEXT TIME
THERE'S A PHOTO EXHIBIT,

419
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,166
PLEASE TAKE ME WITH YOU.

420
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,333
- YEAH, I WILL.

421
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,583
I'LL BE A LITTLE EMBARRASSED
DOING IT, THOUGH.

422
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,250
- THERE'S ONE MORE THING.
- HMM?

423
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,416
- WOULD YOU MIND IF I ASKED
ANOTHER FAVOR?

424
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,250
THOUGH IT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED
A SELFISH REQUEST.

425
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,250
- IT'S OKAY.
 WHAT IS IT?

426
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,083
- WELL, HONESTLY,
WHAT I WOULD LIKE...

427
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,875
WHAT I MEAN TO SAY IS...

428
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,375
- YEAH?  WHAT IS IT?

429
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,583
- IT'S, UM--

430
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:47,083
I APOLOGIZE.
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.

431
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,458
IT WAS REALLY NOTHING.
PLEASE, FORGET IT.

432
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,791
- DON'T JUST STOP THERE.

433
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,625
YOU'VE GOT ME INTERESTED NOW.

434
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:53,958
JUST GO AHEAD AND ASK ME.

435
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,250
- OH, BUT I...

436
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,500
- THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH ASKING.

437
00:20:56,583 --> 00:21:00,000
- UH, ALL RIGHT.
IF THAT'S THE CASE...

438
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,208
THEN I, UM...

439
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,208
I WOULD LIKE--

440
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,375
I'D LIKE YOU TO...

441
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,000
KISS ME,
IF IT'S POSSIBLE.

442
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,625
- ( heart beating )

443
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,250
- ( crying )

444
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:55,166
- ( end theme playing )

445
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

446
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,916
- Tina:
HEY, TAE, WHAT'S "TANABATA"?

447
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,333
- IT'S ABOUT STAR-CROSSED
LOVERS,

448
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,916
PRINCESS ORIHIME

449
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,916
AND PRINCE HIKOBOSHI--
THE ONLY DAY OF THE YEAR--

450
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,041
- "AI YORI AOSHI--"

451
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:30,750
- Taeko: "...STAR FESTIVAL"!
- WHAT?!

452
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:32,416
THAT'S MISS LANDLORD'S
BIRTHDAY TOO?

453
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,416
- WHERE IS MY HIKOBOSHI-SAMA?
- HUH?
