1
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,833
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,250
- THAT SHOULD DO IT.

4
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,458
IN ORDER TO HAVE
INNER PEACE,

5
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:21,375
IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE
A BEAUTIFUL ATMOSPHERE.

6
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,125
- ( meows )

7
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,458
- ( sighs )

8
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,375
( grunts )
- HUH?

9
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,250
SORRY, TINA.

10
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,541
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

11
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,125
- YEAH, I'M FINE.

12
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,500
- HEY, WHAT'S WITH THIS
HUGE PACKAGE HERE?

13
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:58,791
- ( chuckles nervously )

14
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:01,250
WELL, THIS IS...

15
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,041
- HUH?
- AAH!

16
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,250
- UH...
- HUH?

17
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:09,208
- UH...
( chuckles )

18
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,166
- WOW, A FERRET.

19
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,500
HOW ADORABLE.

20
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,500
- ISN'T IT?
I GOT IT PRETTY CHEAP

21
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,250
AT THE PET SHOP
I ALWAYS GO TO.

22
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:28,041
THE VERY FIRST TIME
I SAW THAT CUTE LITTLE FACE,

23
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,583
I JUST KNEW I WOULDN'T
BE ABLE TO LEAVE WITHOUT IT.

24
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,916
HEY, DON'T YOU THINK
IT LOOKS LIKE KAORU?

25
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,916
- OH?
- HUH?

26
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,250
- ( giggles )

27
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,458
- ANYWAY, WHAT WILL
YOU DO WITH IT?

28
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,250
- THAT'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO
ASK YOU, MISS LANDLORD?

29
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,666
- OH?

30
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,541
- SEE? HE LIKES TO
PLAY AROUND LIKE THIS.

31
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,416
WOULDN'T YOU JUST LOVE TO KEEP
A FUR PET TOO, MISS LANDLORD?

32
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,416
- OH MY, IT'S SO DARLING.

33
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,500
- SHE'S ALREADY WON OVER.

34
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,916
HEY, I WONDER WHAT
MISS MIYABI WILL SAY.

35
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,291
- Both: OH.
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

36
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,208
- ( chuckles )
MISS MANAGER. 

37
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,250
- I THOUGHT IT WAS
A LITTLE ROWDY,

38
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,375
BUT THEN TO BRING
SUCH A THING INDOORS.

39
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,458
AND WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
WHEN YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD

40
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,916
RAISE THAT THING HERE?

41
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,666
FIRST OF ALL,
HAVING A PET HERE

42
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,166
WILL GET THE ROOMS DIRTY,
NOT TO MENTION THE SMELL.

43
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,791
YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT WHAT
WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE. 

44
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,125
IS THAT PERFECTLY
UNDERSTOOD?

45
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,458
AS THE MANAGER,
I HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY

46
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,083
OF MAINTAINING
THIS PLACE.

47
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,750
( groans )

48
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,916
THAT TICKLES.

49
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,791
RETURN THIS THING AT ONCE.

50
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,708
- ( sighs )

51
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,708
- MISS MIYABI?
- HMM?

52
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,750
- IS THERE NO WAY
THAT WE CAN KEEP IT?

53
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:44,000
ITS ADORABLE.
- ( sighs )

54
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,916
- MISS MIYABI...

55
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:51,208
- BUT THIS IS ALSO
A MATTER OF MISS MINAZUKI'S TIME

56
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,916
SINCE SHE'LL BE
TAKING CARE OF IT.

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,083
- Taeko: WOW, HOW CUTE!

58
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,875
WE'LL BE KEEPING
A FERRET HERE?

59
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,791
- UH-HUH.
- THAT'S GREAT!

60
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,500
- UHH...

61
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:01,833
( groans )

62
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,583
ALL RIGHT.
DO WHAT YOU LIKE THEN,

63
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,916
BUT I'LL HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO PART OF THIS.

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,250
- ( door slams )

65
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,875
- ( all sigh )

66
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,083
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT!
- HOORAY!

67
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,333
- YEAH!
- WE GET TO KEEP IT!

68
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,125
- ( scoffs )

69
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,833
- Tina: NOW THAT THAT'S SETTLED,
LET'S GIVE IT A HOME.

70
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:21,791
- Both: HUH?

71
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,583
- WELL, ISN'T IT AWESOME?

72
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,333
I FIGURED IT WOULD BE
PRETTY LONELY

73
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,291
SLEEPING IN
AN EMPTY CAGE.

74
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,833
- ( hisses )

75
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:35,041
- I DON'T THINK SO.
- HEY, WHY'S THAT? 

76
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,708
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
KAORU?

77
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,750
IT DOESN'T WANT
A BORING CAGE LIKE THAT.

78
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,791
- Kaoru: THESE THINGS
NEED TO BE BORING.

79
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,625
- ( groans )

80
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,416
- SORRY TO
KEEP YOU WAITING.

81
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,666
I'LL MAKE THE FERRET
A NICE FLUFFY BED RIGHT NOW--

82
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,833
WHOA!

83
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,500
- KAORU-SAMA?

84
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,250
- HUH, YEAH-- WHAT?

85
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,708
( grunts )

86
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,041
- I'M SORRY.

87
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,041
THAT WAS SOME
LINGERIE OF MINE.

88
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,375
- MY GOODNESS.

89
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:12,833
- Taeko: IS THIS ALL RIGHT?
MAYBE IT'S STILL TOO HOT.

90
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,291
- Tina:
YEAH, DRINK IT ALL UP.

91
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,791
- WOW, LOOK AT IT GO.

92
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,458
- OHH.
( chuckles )

93
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,208
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
VERY HUNGRY.

94
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:23,250
- YEAH, OR MAYBE
THAT STUFF'S DELICIOUS.

95
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,791
- AWW.  YOU'RE SUCH
A GOOD LITTLE FERRET.

96
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,250
DRINK AS MUCH AS YOU CAN

97
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,416
SO YOU CAN
GROW UP HEALTHY.

98
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,416
- AOI-CHAN WILL MAKE
A GOOD MOTHER

99
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,416
WHEN SHE HAS
KIDS SOME DAY.

100
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,916
- ( giggles )

101
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,750
- ( chuckles )

102
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,625
- Aoi: KAORU-SAMA?
- YEAH?

103
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,583
- IS THERE SOMETHING
THE MATTER WITH YOU?

104
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,250
- NO, NO.
IT'S NOTHING.

105
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,083
- OH.
- ( Tina laughs )

106
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,208
- ( sighs )

107
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,916
- Tina: WATCH THIS!
THIS IS FUNNY.

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,708
- ( sighs )

109
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,083
- TA-DA!

110
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,666
FISHING FOR FERRETS.

111
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,708
( laughing )

112
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,125
- ( all laugh )

113
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,916
- IT REALLY IS ADORABLE.

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,458
BY THE WAY,

115
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,583
WHAT SHOULD WE NAME IT?

116
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:02,583
- A NAME?

117
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,583
- YES.
IT NEEDS A NAME.

118
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,583
CAN ANYONE THINK
OF A GOOD ONE?

119
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,458
- LET ME SEE...

120
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,583
WHAT KIND OF NAME
WOULD SOUND COOL?

121
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:13,000
- All: HMM.

122
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,250
- ( squeaks )

123
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,250
- OH.

124
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,250
DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS,
MISS MIYABI?

125
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,916
- HUH?

126
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,583
ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THAT CREATURE

127
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,125
I'LL HAVE NO PART OF.

128
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,916
- ( all sigh )

129
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,916
- ( squeaks )

130
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,458
- ( sighs )

131
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,083
IT CERTAINLY WAS
A CHAOTIC DAY.

132
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,583
HONESTLY,

133
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:47,458
AND NO INNER PEACE
TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE.

134
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,041
( sighs )

135
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,208
AN ANIMAL.
OF ALL THINGS...

136
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,916
- ( squeaks )
- HUH?

137
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,458
( gasps )

138
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,583
MISS TINA!

139
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,583
- Tina: OH, SO THIS IS
WHERE THE FERRET WAS. 

140
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:03,916
- ( Miyabi groans )

141
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,958
- ( Tina chuckles )

142
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,708
HMM.

143
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,208
- HEY, TINA.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?

144
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,458
- OH, IT'S MISSING AGAIN.

145
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,250
- ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT THE FERRET?

146
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,250
- YEAH.
I THINK IT WOULD BE BAD

147
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,583
IF IT PLAYED PRANKS
ON THE MANAGER AGAIN.

148
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:24,583
KAORU!

149
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,916
PLEASE HELP ME
LOOK FOR IT, OKAY?

150
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,041
- HMM.

151
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,916
- ( knocks on door )

152
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,625
- MISS MIYABI,
HOW ABOUT SOME TEA?

153
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:36,708
MISS MIYABI?

154
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,041
- THAT'S STRANGE.

155
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:44,041
I'M POSITIVE THAT'S WHERE
I HAD LEFT IT EARLIER.

156
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,416
- IS SOMETHING THE MATTER,
MISS MIYABI?

157
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,791
- LADY AOI.

158
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,125
NO, IT'S REALLY NOT ANYTHING
ALL THAT IMPORTANT.

159
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:53,375
I JUST CAN'T FIND THE
FOUNTAIN PEN I LEFT HERE.

160
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,708
- FOUNTAIN PEN.

161
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,125
- HUH?

162
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,333
- ( murmurs )

163
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,833
- DAMN YOU!

164
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:00,958
- ( gasps )

165
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,916
OH NO.  IT HAS TO BE
WITH THE MANAGER.

166
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,083
- WE'RE A LITTLE TOO LATE,
I GUESS.

167
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,250
- WHERE DID YOU GO?

168
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,250
- ( squeaks )
- ( screams )

169
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,125
OW.

170
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,291
- ARE YOU OKAY?

171
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,458
- MISS MINAZUKI,
GRAB THAT THING!

172
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,500
- HUH?

173
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,708
OH!

174
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,791
AAH!

175
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,750
- LEAVE THIS TO ME.
( chuckles )

176
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,416
- OH!

177
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,375
- THAT'S NOT IT.

178
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,375
- OH?

179
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,583
( yelps )

180
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,250
OH!  OH, NO DON'T!

181
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,916
OH!  OOH, NO. NOT THERE.

182
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,208
- AOI-CHAN.

183
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,083
- ( giggles )
THAT TICKLES.

184
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,583
- COME BACK HERE, YOU!

185
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,416
- ( crashing )
- Taeko: OH, THE VASE!

186
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,250
- Kaoru: OH, OW!

187
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,541
- Aoi: KAORU-SAMA?

188
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,000
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

189
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,458
- Tina: OH!
ITS PEEING OVER HERE.

190
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,458
- Miyabi: DAMN IT,
COME BACK HERE!

191
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,041
- Kaoru: OH, BROTHER.

192
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,916
IT SURE MADE
A MESS OF THINGS.

193
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,250
- ( sighs )

194
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

195
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,625
I WON'T ALLOW ANYMORE!

196
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,125
- ( all gasp )

197
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,083
- HUH?
- ( girls gasp )

198
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,291
- YOU THERE!

199
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,958
COME BACK HERE.

200
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,583
- AND THERE SHE GOES.

201
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,333
- BOY, THE MANAGER
SURE IS SCARY RIGHT NOW.

202
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,125
- YEAH.  BECAUSE SHE'S
TOTALLY ANGRY.

203
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,458
- ITS ALL RIGHT.

204
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:32,083
I'M SURE THAT MISS MIYABI
WILL BE UNDERSTANDING.

205
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,375
( sighs )

206
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,458
- Miyabi:
STAY STILL ALREADY!

207
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,583
DAMN YOU, FERRET!

208
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,333
OH!  GO TO HELL!

209
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,791
( grunts )

210
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,833
IT APPEARS YOU'VE
FINALLY GIVEN UP.

211
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:55,500
THERE ISN'T
ANYWHERE TO RUN NOW.

212
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:58,583
( gasps )

213
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,458
IT CAN'T BE.

214
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,125
( screams )

215
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,541
- ( meows )

216
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,041
- MISS MIYABI!
- Miyabi: GET AWAY!  NO!

217
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,583
GET AWAY FROM ME.

218
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,458
DON'T COME ANY CLOSER.

219
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,875
( shudders )

220
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,875
I HATE COCKROACHES!

221
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,791
( screams )
- IT'S A COCKROACH?

222
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,000
- OH, THAT'S THE BUTTON I LOST.
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR IT.

223
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,916
- UH-- BUTTON?

224
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,583
- IT'S ALL RIGHT,
MISS MIYABI.

225
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:25,916
IT'S NOT A COCKROACH.

226
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,583
- MISTAKING A BUTTON
FOR A COCKROACH.

227
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,250
YOU SURE DO JUMP TO
SOME WILD CONCLUSIONS.

228
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,750
- ( chuckles )

229
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,791
SO, MISS MIYABI'S AFRAID
OF SOMETHING AFTER ALL. 

230
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,791
- Kaoru:
THAT'S KIND OF A RELIEF.

231
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,333
- ( groans )
- Tina: WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT?

232
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,416
- ( all chuckle )

233
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,250
- ( murmurs )

234
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,166
- ( door slams )
- UH, MISS MIYABI?

235
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,125
- I'M REALLY SORRY FOR LAUGHING
AT YOU, MISS MIYABI.

236
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,791
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO HURT YOU. 

237
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,791
- YEAH, IT'S JUST THAT
WE NEVER EXPECTED

238
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,500
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
THAT'S ALL.

239
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,958
- I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY
SHE'S REALLY MAD NOW.

240
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,916
- I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO
WAIT UNTIL SHE CALMS DOWN.

241
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,250
- ( all sigh )

242
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,916
- ( sighs )

243
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,583
- ( knocks on door )

244
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,375
- Kaoru: MISS MIYABI?

245
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,250
ITS ALMOST LUNCH TIME.

246
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,583
AREN'T YOU GONNA EAT?

247
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,916
WE'RE ALL WAITING FOR YOU.
- ( squeaks )

248
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,416
- ( sighs )

249
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,875
- HOW IS SHE?

250
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,541
- STILL NO ANSWER.

251
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:49,958
- OH, IS THAT THE CASE?

252
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,375
I SUPPOSE YOU MUST
BE HUNGRY BY NOW. 

253
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:58,083
HERE'S YOUR LUNCH.

254
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,250
GO ON AHEAD
AND HAVE YOUR FILL.

255
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,583
COME ON.

256
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,250
- ( sniffs )

257
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,916
( squeaks )

258
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,250
- ( both sigh )

259
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,916
- Kaoru: MISS MIYABI?

260
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,250
IF YOU DON'T HURRY UP,
YOUR LUNCH WILL GET COLD.

261
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:18,916
MISS MIYABI?

262
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,958
- ( sighs )

263
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,291
HE'S SURE PERSISTENT.

264
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,083
PERHAPS I'VE ALSO
BEEN PERSISTENT

265
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,250
IN MY IMMATURE BEHAVIOR.

266
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:33,250
- ( scratching at door )
- HMM?

267
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,208
WHAT'S THAT NOISE?

268
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,208
- ( squeaks )

269
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,208
- WHAT THE HECK
DO YOU THINK IT'S DOING?

270
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,583
- I WOULD IMAGINE

271
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,625
THAT IT'S WORRIED ABOUT
MISS MIYABI IN ITS OWN WAY.

272
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,250
- Kaoru: I SEE.

273
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:48,333
MAYBE IT'S WAITING FOR
MISS MIYABI TO COME OUT.

274
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,541
- IT'S WAITING?

275
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,083
( sighs )

276
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,875
WELL, I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT FERRET.

277
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,750
AS MANAGER, I CANNOT ALLOW
ANYTHING TO DAMAGE THIS MANSION,

278
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,750
EVEN IF IT IS A PET THAT
BELONGS TO ONE OF THE TENANTS.

279
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:04,291
ANYWAY, IT IS THE CAUSE OF THIS
PREDICAMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE.

280
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,291
( grunts )

281
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,958
- ( beeps )

282
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,875
- ( gasps )

283
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,166
- ( scratching at door )

284
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,166
- ( sighs )

285
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,541
OHH.

286
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,000
- OH, I'M SORRY!

287
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,916
I'LL CLEAN IT UP,
MISS MIYABI.

288
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,750
- HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
TAEKO-CHAN?

289
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:26,916
- YEAH.

290
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,583
- ( sighs )
I'M ALL OUT OF WHACK TODAY.

291
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,250
WATCHING TAE'S KLUTZINESS

292
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,333
WITHOUT THE MANAGER HERE
SCOLDING HER

293
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,250
JUST DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

294
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,458
- ( sighs )
NO, IT DOESN'T.

295
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,041
THE FOOD'S ALREADY
GOTTEN COLD.

296
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,416
AND THE FERRET HASN'T
COME BACK YET EITHER.

297
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,750
- YEAH.

298
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,916
BUT WHY IT WOULD BE
SO WORRIED ABOUT THE MANAGER

299
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,083
IS SOMETHING THAT
I DON'T REALLY GET.

300
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,875
THE ONLY THING
IT EVER GOT FROM HER

301
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,500
WAS BEING CHASED.

302
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,250
- I'M WORRIED IT DOESN'T WANT
TO EAT DURING FEEDING TIMES. 

303
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,333
PERHAPS IT WON'T EAT
UNTIL MISS MIYABI

304
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:22,208
DECIDES TO COME OUT
OF HER ROOM.

305
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,791
THE FERRET IS
JUST LIKE MISS MIYABI

306
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,166
IN THAT IT MUST BE HUNGRY.

307
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,583
- ALL RIGHT. 
LET'S GO TAKE

308
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,458
THE MANAGER'S LUNCH
TO HER ROOM.

309
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:33,208
AND WE'LL ALSO ASK HER
ABOUT THE FERRET ONE MORE TIME

310
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,166
WHILE WE'RE THERE.

311
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,916
- HMM.

312
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,416
AND NOW TO SIGN IT.

313
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,666
HMM?

314
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,958
THE FOUNTAIN PEN.

315
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,583
( sighs )

316
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,291
( scoffs )

317
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:08,833
ALL DONE.

318
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:09,833
OH.

319
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,583
IT DIDN'T HAVE TO
BE THAT ONE.

320
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,583
I COULD HAVE USED
ANOTHER PEN.

321
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,458
SO IT FINALLY GAVE UP.

322
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,125
SCRATCHING AWAY
ALL THAT TIME, 

323
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,250
IT WASN'T FUNNY.

324
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,500
( sighs )

325
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,083
( gasps )

326
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,083
( sighs )

327
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,083
- Taeko: OH, THE FERRET!

328
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,500
- HOW DID IT 
END UP THERE?

329
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:02,250
- ( squeaks )
- IT'S STUCK!

330
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,666
DON'T YOU WORRY
ABOUT A THING. 

331
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,750
HANG ON.

332
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,583
I'LL GET YOU OUT OF THERE,
OKAY?

333
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,875
- ( squeaks )

334
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,250
- STOP IT, MISS TINA.
YOU'RE HURTING IT.

335
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,916
- WE CAN'T PULL IT
OUT OF THERE.

336
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,583
THE SPACE IS TOO NARROW.

337
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,083
- WHAT NOW?
WHAT DO WE DO?

338
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,666
- ( squeaking )

339
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,916
- IF WE CAN MOVE THIS SOMEHOW.

340
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,750
( grunts )

341
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,708
- ( squeaks )

342
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,333
- ( grunts )

343
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
NO GOOD.

344
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,375
IT WON'T EVEN BUDGE.

345
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,750
- NO WAY!

346
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,625
- I'LL TRY TO
HELP YOU MOVE THIS,

347
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,583
OKAY, KAORU-SAMA?
- AOI-CHAN.

348
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,416
- YEAH, IF WE ALL
PULL TOGETHER,

349
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,625
MAYBE WE'LL BE ABLE
TO MOVE IT SOMEHOW.

350
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:42,916
- ALL RIGHT.

351
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,083
- ( squeaks )

352
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,250
- ( all grunt, straining )

353
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,916
- PLEASE HOLD ON.

354
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,583
WE'LL BE GETTING YOU OUT
VERY SOON.

355
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,250
- ( squeaks )

356
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,583
- Taeko: IT'S NO GOOD.

357
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,416
IT'S TOO HEAVY
TO EVEN MOVE AN INCH.

358
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,791
- Tina: THE FERRET'S NOT
MOVING AS MUCH ANYMORE. 

359
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,916
- Aoi: YOU SHOULDN'T GIVE UP,
MISS TINA.

360
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,583
- ( grunting )

361
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,083
- Tina: YOU CAN SAY THAT
ALL YOU WANT,

362
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:17,458
BUT AT THIS RATE,
IT'S GONNA DIE!

363
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,916
- ( grunting )

364
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,041
- MISS MIYABI.

365
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:24,000
- ( gasps )

366
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,583
- MISS MIYABI.

367
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:26,958
- OH, NO.

368
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,750
- ( squeaks )

369
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,416
- HEY, THE LITTLE GUY'S
NOT MOVING AT ALL NOW. 

370
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,333
- LET'S TRY MOVING THIS CLOCK
TOGETHER ONE MORE TIME.

371
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,458
ONE, TWO--

372
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,541
- GET AWAY FROM THERE!

373
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,750
( panting )

374
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,208
- MISS MIYABI.

375
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,333
- Taeko: MISS MANAGER.

376
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,583
- ( gasps )

377
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,750
- BROKEN OBJECTS
CAN ALWAYS BE REPAIRED.

378
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,666
WE CAN REPLACE THE THINGS
THAT CAN'T BE FIXED.

379
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,125
HOWEVER,

380
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,666
LIVES ON THE OTHER HAND...

381
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:07,916
HOLD ON.

382
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,250
ONLY A LITTLE BIT MORE.

383
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,125
( grunts )

384
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,750
- ( gasps )
- MISS MIYABI!

385
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,000
- MISS MIYABI,
KAORU-SAMA?

386
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,458
- OW.

387
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,916
- MISS MIYABI,
DID YOU HURT YOURSELF?

388
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,250
- HUH?  OH.

389
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,916
EXCUSE ME.

390
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,250
- HUH?
- ( gasps )

391
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,583
- ( squeaks )
- ( gasps )

392
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,250
- LOOKS LIKE THE FERRET'S
GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

393
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,125
- ( sighs )
HONESTLY,

394
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:36,083
THIS IS WHY I REALLY
DESPISE ANIMALS.

395
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,250
- AND MISS MIYABI'S 
OUT OF HER ROOM NOW.

396
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,625
THAT'S ALSO GOOD NEWS.

397
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:44,583
- THIS IS ALL THANKS
TO THE FERRET.

398
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,291
OH, I KNOW A GOOD NAME.

399
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,250
WHY DON'T WE NAME
THIS LITTLE ONE UZUME.

400
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,416
- YOU MEAN FROM
JAPANESE MYTHOLOGY?

401
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,458
- YES.

402
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,916
- HEY, I DON'T KNOW THAT ONE.

403
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,500
WHAT KIND OF STORY
IS THAT?

404
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,208
- IN ORDER TO LURE OUT
GODDESS AMATERASU,

405
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,250
WHO IS HIDING IN
THE HEAVENLY CAVE,

406
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,583
THE GODS HELD A PARTY

407
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,708
AND DRANK MERRILY 
OUTSIDE THAT CAVE.

408
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,250
- ( squeaks )

409
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,916
- AND THE ONE WHO
LED THOSE GODS

410
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,916
WAS DIVINE PRINCE
UZUME.

411
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,458
- ( giggles ) IT'S PERFECT.
I LIKE IT A LOT.

412
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,375
- YEAH, IT SOUNDS
REALLY COOL.

413
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,916
- HOW DO YOU LIKE IT,
MISS MIYABI?

414
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,125
- HUH?

415
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,625
UZUME.

416
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,208
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD NAME.

417
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,875
- ( squeaks )

418
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,416
- Tina:
ALL RIGHT, THEN!

419
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,583
UZUME IT IS!
( chuckles ) 

420
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,250
- WELL, ALL RIGHT.

421
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,250
- YEAH!

422
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,583
- UZUME?

423
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,583
UZUME?

424
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,250
HEY, UZUME?

425
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,750
- WHAT'S WRONG, TINA?

426
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,916
- OH, KAORU,
HAVE YOU SEEN UZUME?

427
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,541
- IT'S GONE AGAIN, HUH?

428
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,208
- I'M CERTAIN IT'S SPENDING 
TIME WITH MISS MIYABI AGAIN.

429
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,250
- ( chuckles )

430
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,583
- AWW.

431
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,791
UZUME SURE IS ALL OVER
THE MANAGER.

432
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,250
IT MAKES ME FEEL
KIND OF LONELY. 

433
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,125
I GUESS IT CAN'T BE HELPED.

434
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,458
- I'M SURE THAT WAS UZUME'S
PLAN FRM THE VERY BEGINNaING.

435
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:01,791
- YES, AND IT MUST HAVE KNOWN

436
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,333
JUST HOW KIND A PERSON
MISS MIYABI WAS.

437
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,750
- THAT SHOULD DO IT.

438
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,916
IN ORDER TO HAVE
INNER PEACE,

439
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,958
IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE
A BEAUTIFUL ATMOSPHERE.

440
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,208
OH, HELLO, UZUME.

441
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,750
WHAT DID YOU BRING ME
THIS TIME?

442
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:25,708
( yelps )

443
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,291
( screams )

444
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,750
- ( meows )

445
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,208
- NO, UZUME.
GET AWAY FROM ME.

446
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,416
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME?

447
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,791
I TOLD YOU TO GET AWAY.

448
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,666
TAKE THAT THING WITH YOU
AND GO AWAY.

449
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,666
- UZUME'S REALLY GOT
MISS MIYABI

450
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,458
WRAPPED AROUND 
ITS LITTLE PAW.

451
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,166
- IT CERTAINLY SEEMS SO.

452
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,833
- THIS IS EXACTLY WHY
I SAID I DESPISED ANIMALS!

453
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,125
- ( theme music playing )

454
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

455
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:22,750
- Tina: ( chuckles )
KAORU?

456
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,750
WE'RE ALL ALONE TONIGHT.

457
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,541
- Kaoru:
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT, TINA.

458
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,000
- Tina:
HEY, WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

459
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,791
YOU KNOW WHAT.
- Kaoru: YOU KNOW What?

460
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,583
AI YORI AOSHI,
"ONE NIGHT."

461
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:33,416
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

462
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,375
- Tina:
YOU KNOW WHAT.
