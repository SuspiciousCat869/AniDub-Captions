1
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:34,916
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:10,708
- Kaoru:
WOW, I TOOK QUITE A FEW SHOTS.

4
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,416
OH YEAH, HERE.

5
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,750
THIS IS THE CAT
I MENTIONED.

6
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,916
IT POPPED UP
EVERYWHERE I WENT,

7
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,583
FROM THE UNIVERSITY QUAD
TO BUILDING ROOFTOPS.

8
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,083
- I'D IMAGINE THAT THIS
KITTY CAT MUST BE

9
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,458
TERRIBLY FOND OF YOU.

10
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,916
- I'M PRETTY SURE
ALL IT WANTS IS FOOD.

11
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,583
AND WHEN I SAY
I DON'T HAVE ANY,

12
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:30,416
THE LOOK ON ITS FACE
JUST SCREAMS "YOU CHEAPSKATE."

13
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,791
- ( giggles )

14
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,583
- Tina:
MAN, YOU'RE SO FLIRTATIOUS

15
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,625
IN THIS ONE, KAORU.

16
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,583
TA-DA!

17
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,250
- IT'S OBVIOUS
THAT YOU'RE DRUNK

18
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,125
AND HANGING ONTO ME HERE.
- OH, YEAH?

19
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,250
- SO YOU REALLY DON'T
REMEMBER IT AT ALL?

20
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,916
- UM, WAS I REALLY?

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
- AND IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE
MESS AFTERWARDS, TOO.

22
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,291
- ( Tina chuckles )

23
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,916
- OH.
( giggles )

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,333
- HUH?

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,250
A PROFESSOR CHEWED US OUT
WHEN HE SAW US THERE.

26
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,666
- YES, I CAN SEE WHY.

27
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,416
YOU SEEM TO BE
ENJOYING YOURSELF.

28
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,333
- YOU THINK SO?
- YES, AND QUITE A BIT TOO.

29
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,666
- WHAT'S THIS? 
COULD THIS BE--

30
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,958
- YOU BET!

31
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,791
THAT'S A TAIYAKI PASTRY
FROM MITZARUGIA.

32
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,125
- OH, YOU MEAN THAT
MYTHICAL TAIYAKI STAND

33
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,833
THAT NO ONE EVER KNOWS
WHERE OR WHEN IT WILL APPEAR?

34
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,458
- BUT YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOTTEN
TO EAT IT ONCE, RIGHT, TINA?

35
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,083
- I SURE HAVE!
MITZARUGIA, THE ELUSIVE

36
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,791
WANDERING TAIYAKI STAND.

37
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,125
CRISPY ON THE OUTSIDE,

38
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,458
RED BEAN PASTE
ALL THE WAY TO THE TAIL.

39
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,000
IT WAS SO INCREDIBLE.

40
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,708
- IS IT REALLY 
THAT DELICIOUS?

41
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,916
- YOU'D JUST LOVE
TO TRY IT ONCE, RIGHT?

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,958
I WOULD.
- YES.

43
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,750
- I AM SORRY TO INTERRUPT
YOUR FUN, EVERYONE.

44
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,583
- All: HUH?

45
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,875
- SIR, KAORU.
- YES?

46
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,583
- I BELIEVE THAT YOU AREN'T
ALLOWED INSIDE THIS MANSION

47
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:53,791
AFTER 10:00.

48
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,250
- UH...

49
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,916
MISS MIYABI SURE IS
STRICT, ISN'T SHE? 

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,541
- KAORU-SAMA?
- HUH?

51
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,500
AOI-CHAN.

52
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:06,750
WHAT'S UP?

53
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,250
- UM, KAORU-SAMA,

54
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,583
IF YOU DON'T MIND,

55
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,250
MAY I HAVE THAT PHOTOGRAPH
YOU SHOWED ME EARLIER?

56
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,916
- THE ONE FROM EARLIER?

57
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:16,916
THIS?

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,208
- YES, THIS ONE.

59
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,166
OH, AND ALSO,

60
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,083
I'D LIKE TO HEAR
MORE OF YOUR STORIES.

61
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,666
- HUH?  YOU MEAN,
COLLEGE STORIES? 

62
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,916
- YES.  I LOVE HEARING
YOUR STORIES, KAORU-SAMA.

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,958
- ALL RIGHT.
IF THOSE ARE OKAY.

64
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,375
- MM-HMM!

65
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,583
- Kaoru: HEY, TINA!
YOU READY YET?

66
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,416
- Tina: YEAH!
HOLD ON, WILL YOU?

67
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,958
- MISS TINA?  DO YOU HAVE
YOUR LUNCH BOX WITH YOU? 

68
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,916
- MM-HMM.
I MAY FORGET MY SCHOOL BOOKS,

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,666
BUT I'D NEVER
FORGET THIS. 

70
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,916
- All:
WE'RE ON OUR WAY NOW.

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,250
- RIGHT.
DO TAKE CARE ON YOUR WAY.

72
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,750
- ( door closes )

73
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,666
- ALL RIGHT.

74
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,666
I'LL DO MY BEST TODAY TOO.

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,125
OH.

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,125
MISS TAEKO
CERTAINLY IS LARGE.

77
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:18,250
THERE REALLY IS
NO COMPARISON. 

78
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:22,583
I WONDER IF KAORU-SAMA
LIKES WOMEN WITH LARGE BREASTS.

79
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,125
- ( Uzume squeaks )

80
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,125
- OH.

81
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,958
- ( squeaks )

82
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,708
- UZUME, NO.

83
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,250
( giggles )

84
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,416
OH.

85
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,083
AFTER THIS, I THINK
I'D BETTER GO CLEAN

86
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,416
KAORU-SAMA'S ROOM TOO.

87
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,083
- ( knocks on door )

88
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,333
- EXCUSE ME?

89
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:03,250
I NEED TO FOLD UP
THE FUTON FIRST. 

90
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,583
( sighs )

91
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,125
( giggles )

92
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:18,083
KAORU-SAMA'S FUTON
IS SO COMFORTABLE.

93
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,041
IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE
IT SMELLS LIKE HIM.

94
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,541
THE KAORU-SAMA
THAT I DO NOT KNOW.

95
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:44,041
I'D LIKE TO VISIT KAORU-SAMA'S
UNIVERSITY ONE DAY.

96
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,250
OH, NO.

97
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,250
I NEED TO CLEAN.

98
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,125
OH, YOU WERE HERE,
LADY AOI.

99
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,583
- I WAS.  HELLO.

100
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,500
IS YOUR WORK DONE,
MISS MIYABI?

101
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,250
- YES, MOST OF IT.

102
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,333
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY...

103
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:03,666
IT IS NEARLY
THE APPOINTED TIME.

104
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,208
- YES, IT CERTAINLY IS.

105
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,125
- THEN LET US BE
ON OUR WAY, LADY AOI.

106
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,125
- RIGHT.

107
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,583
- WHY?
WHY CAN'T WE, MIYUKI?

108
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,583
- ( sobbing ) WE CAN'T...
BECAUSE YOU AND I...

109
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,916
ARE TIED BY BLOOD!

110
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,958
WE'RE BROTHER AND SISTER.

111
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,916
- WHAT?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

112
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,916
But-- but still.

113
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,916
Even so, I-- I--

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,916
I love you!

115
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,416
- Naoki!

116
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,875
- Miyuki!

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,250
- I STILL CAN'T FORGIVE

118
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,583
THAT WOMAN'S
INDECISIVENESS OVER THIS.

119
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,875
- IS THAT SO?
I THINK I CAN UNDERSTAND

120
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,375
HOW SHE'S FEELING.

121
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,083
- WE CAN'T MISS
THE NEXT EPISODE.

122
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,666
- NO.

123
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,916
- OH, THE TIME.

124
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,625
I HAVE TO GO TO
THE TOKYO BRANCH BOARD MEETING.

125
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,583
I SHOULD BE BACK HOME
BY EVENING TIME,

126
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,250
SO I WILL TRUST YOU WITH
THE HOUSE UNTIL I COME BACK.

127
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,916
- ALL RIGHT. 
DO TAKE CARE.

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,625
- ( door closes )

129
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,416
- WHAT SHOULD WE HAVE
FOR DINNER TONIGHT?

130
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,250
- We've finally found it.

131
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,375
The legendary taiyaki stand,
Mitzarugia.

132
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,416
- We are currently behind
Kanagawa supermarket

133
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,583
in Umegaoka's third district.

134
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:17,916
- KANAGAWA?

135
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,375
THE ONE NEARBY?

136
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,333
- Well, since I'm 
working by myself,

137
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,916
I really can't handle
the long lines of customers.

138
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,083
- So, it's to maintain
your service,

139
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,583
and the quality of
your pastry masterpiece too.

140
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,625
- I also like that people in
different cities could eat it.

141
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:32,791
- OH.

142
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,458
MISS TINA MENTIONED THIS.

143
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,125
- Tina:
CRISPY ON THE OUTSIDE,

144
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,250
RED BEAN PASTE
ALL THE WAY TO THE TAIL.

145
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,833
IT WAS SO INCREDIBLE!

146
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,250
- Will you be
working here today?

147
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,583
- No, I'll be moving
in about an hour.

148
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,583
- WHAT?

149
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,750
- MISS AOI'S LUNCHES
ARE AS DELICIOUS AS ALWAYS.

150
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,875
- IT'S A WORK OF ART.
- ( meows )

151
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,041
- YOU AGAIN?

152
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,458
WHAT IS IT? IS THERE
SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT?

153
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,125
- IF YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT IT'S SAYING,

154
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,541
JUST LEAVE IT TO ME.

155
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,250
- ( meows )

156
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,125
- MM-HMM.
MEOW-MEOW.

157
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,958
SO THIS SPOT'S
YOUR TERRITORY, HUH?

158
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,833
AND YOU WANT TO
LIE HERE IN THE SUN.

159
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:13,958
- ( hisses )

160
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,041
- ( yelps )

161
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,583
- ( chuckles )

162
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,583
- DAMN YOU!

163
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,791
COME BACK!
THAT'S MY FRIED CHICKEN.

164
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,416
- YOU WEREN'T EVEN CLOSE,
TINA.

165
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,000
- IT LOOKS LIKE
THAT CAT WAS ONLY HUNGRY.

166
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,208
- ( giggles )

167
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,125
- HERE YOU GO.

168
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,375
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

169
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:43,583
( giggles )

170
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,833
- BY THE WAY,

171
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,583
TRY TO EAT IT
AS SOON AS YOU CAN.

172
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,083
THEY'RE GREAT COLD TOO,

173
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,250
BUT I RECOMMEND
HAVING THEM WARM.

174
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,958
- S-SURE.

175
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,250
WELL, IT'S WARM.

176
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,583
- Next stop,
Meiritsu University front gate.

177
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,916
Meiritsu University front gate.

178
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,916
Please press the buzzer
if you wish to exit.

179
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,625
- ( sighs )

180
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,583
THIS IS WHERE 
KAORU-SAMA IS.

181
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,916
Aoi:
IS IT ALL RIGHT TO GO IN?

182
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,333
OH.

183
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,333
- ( giggles )

184
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,250
- HEY, YOU WANT TO GO
CATCH A MOVIE AFTER CLASS?

185
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,750
- SOUNDS GREAT.
OKAY.

186
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,708
- WHICH ONE?
- LET'S SEE...

187
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,916
- OH.  EXCUSE ME.

188
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,041
- Both: HMM?

189
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,083
- HERE.

190
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,791
THIS FELL OUT OF
YOUR POCKET.

191
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,000
- OH, THANKS.
- SURE.

192
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,333
- WE HAD A GIRL
LIKE HER HERE, 

193
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,458
IN THIS COLLEGE?

194
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,125
- DON'T KNOW.

195
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,250
- ( gasps )

196
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,000
( sighs )

197
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,916
LET ME PEEK IN
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

198
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,125
- ( chuckles )

199
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,583
- IF I HAD KNOWN
THIS WOULD HAPPEN,

200
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,250
I WOULD HAVE CLEANED
THIS PLACE EARLIER. 

201
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,208
- ANYTHING WILL DO, 
AS LONG AS IT WORKS.

202
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,250
- ( door opens )

203
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,833
- HEY, WE CAME BACK,
YOU GUYS.

204
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,250
- CHIEF, VICE-CHIEF.

205
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,083
WE'RE DONE BUYING
ALL THE EQUIPMENT

206
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,666
WE NEED FOR
THE PHOTO FAIR.

207
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,291
- JUST PUT IT SOMEWHERE.

208
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,250
- UH...
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

209
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,250
- Suzuki:
JAPANESE IN KIMONOS!

210
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,666
- Sato: TRADITIONAL CLOTHES
ARE THE HEART OF JAPAN.

211
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,833
- TRADITIONAL?

212
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,583
- YOU GUYS HAVEN'T
HEARD THE STORY?

213
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,708
THERE WAS A TRADITIONAL
JAPANESE BEAUTY

214
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,083
SPOTTED AROUND THE CAMPUS.

215
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,916
- A JAPANESE BEAUTY?

216
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,250
- YEAH, AND SHE'S WEARING
TRADITIONAL CLOTHES

217
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,000
FOR SOME MOVIE
THAT'S BEING FILMED.

218
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,250
( chuckles )

219
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,583
FOUND ONE!

220
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,083
- Suzuki:
GREAT JOB, SATO.

221
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,500
LET'S GO!
- YEAH!

222
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,041
- Both: HUH?

223
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,000
- ( students chattering )

224
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,583
- ( sighs )

225
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,333
AOI-CHAN'S LUNCH
WAS DELICIOUS.

226
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,041
I WONDER WHAT SHE'S DOING
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

227
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:56,750
- All: HUH?

228
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,333
- Both: HUH?
- WHO'S THAT?

229
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,833
- SO BEAUTIFUL.
DO YOU KNOW HER?

230
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,500
- SHE'S GREAT.
- WHY IS SHE WEARING A KIMONO?

231
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,250
- SHE'S CUTE.
- BEAUTIFUL.

232
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,125
- Aoi: I WONDER WHAT
I SHOULD DO WHEN I SEE HIM.

233
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,291
I WONDER IF
HE'LL BE SURPRISED.

234
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,750
BUT I MIGHT BE
BOTHERING HIM 

235
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,583
BY COMING
WITHOUT ANY WARNING.

236
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,583
- ( footsteps approach )

237
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,416
- HUH?

238
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,750
- HEY, YOU AREN'T
A STUDENT HERE, ARE YOU?

239
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,916
- IS THAT KIMONO
FOR SOME MOVIE? 

240
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,916
- UH, UM...

241
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,416
- ARE YOU A MODEL
OR SOMETHING?

242
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,083
- SO WHAT'S YOUR NAME,
ANYWAY?

243
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,791
COME ON, TELL US.

244
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,083
- ( stammers )

245
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,250
- Both:
COME ON, PLEASE?

246
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,583
- CAN I AT LEAST 
GET AN AUTOGRAPH?

247
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:35,583
- YOU SEEM
SORT OF FAMILIAR.

248
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,250
WHERE HAVE I SEEN YOU BEFORE?

249
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,416
GIVE ME A HINT.

250
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,416
- SOMETHING?
- COME ON.

251
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,708
- I'M SORRY.
- Both: HUH?

252
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,333
- Girl:
THAT WAS A GREAT GAME.

253
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,666
- A JAPANESE BEAUTY
IN TRADITIONAL CLOTHES.

254
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,166
- IT CAN'T POSSIBLY 
BE MISS AOI, CAN IT?

255
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,916
- THERE'S NO WAY.

256
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,250
WHAT IN THE HECK
WOULD THE LANDLORD

257
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,416
BE DOING HERE?

258
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,416
- ( gasps )
- HUH?

259
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,000
- Girl:
IT'S THE GIRL IN THE KIMONO.

260
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,458
- ( crying )

261
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:01,625
- Both: IT'S HER!

262
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,625
- ( panting )

263
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,625
THAT SURPRISED ME.

264
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,958
I THINK IT'S BEST
THAT I RETURN HOME NOW.

265
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,750
I WONDER WHERE
THE EXIT IS.

266
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,291
- KAORU. 
- SENPAI?

267
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,583
- Tina: WAKE UP!
- Taeko: SENPAI!

268
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,041
- HMM?

269
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,333
TINA, TAEKO-CHAN?

270
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:34,166
- KAORU, MISS LANDLORD
IS HERE ON THE CAMPUS.

271
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,500
- YEAH?

272
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,791
THAT'S NICE TO HEAR.

273
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:38,916
( gasps )

274
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,041
WHAT?!

275
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,583
- ANOTHER DEAD END.

276
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,250
KAORU-SAMA.

277
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,958
- ( panting )

278
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,791
- ( grunts )

279
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,416
- OH, NO.
SHE'S NOT HERE EITHER.

280
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,291
- I WONDER WHERE
MISS AOI COULD HAVE GOTTEN TO.

281
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,916
- Tina: WE'VE LOOKED
EVERYWHERE FOR HER. 

282
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,041
MAYBE SHE WENT HOME ALREADY.

283
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:23,000
- Kaoru: BUT WHY DID
AOI-CHAN COME HERE? 

284
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,958
- Taeko: MAYBE SHE HAD
AN URGENT ERRAND TO RUN?

285
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:29,958
- Kaoru: I HOPE AOI-CHAN
ISN'T LOST SOMEWHERE OUT THERE.

286
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,291
- ( sighs )

287
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,958
- ( bell rings )
- HUH?

288
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,375
- ( sighs )

289
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,000
- THE BOTH OF YOU HAVE
AFTERNOON LECTURES, DON'T YOU?

290
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,208
- KAORU, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING DO NOW?

291
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,916
- I'M GONNA GO LOOK AROUND
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

292
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,875
- WELL, LET US KNOW
IF YOU FIND HER, OKAY?

293
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,250
- ( panting )

294
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,791
Kaoru: WHAT OTHER PLACES
WOULD SHE KNOW ABOUT?

295
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,250
- Aoi: YOU SEEM TO BE
ENJOYING YOURSELF.

296
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,875
- ( gasps )

297
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,583
- KAORU-SAMA.
( sighs )

298
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:16,916
- AOI-CHAN!

299
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,583
AOI-CHAN!

300
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,583

302
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,583
- KA-- KAORU-SAMA?

303
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,125
( gasps )

304
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,583
- THANK GOODNESS.
SO YOU WERE HERE AFTER ALL.

305
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,416
HUH?  WHAT'S WRONG?

306
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,583
WHY ARE YOU HIDING THERE?

307
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,458
- I'M SORRY.
- HUH?

308
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,958
- FOR COMING HERE
WITHOUT ANY WARNING.

309
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,250
- ( stammers )

310
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,458
AOI-CHAN,
YOU'RE ALWAYS WELCOME HERE.

311
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,750
- HUH?

312
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,291
YOU DON'T THINK
I'M A BIG BOTHER?

313
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,958
- OF COURSE
I DON'T THINK THAT.

314
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,416
I'M HAPPY
THAT YOU'RE HERE.

315
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,375
- ( gasps )

316
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,000
KAORU-SAMA.

317
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,250
- ( stammers )

318
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,583
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
- HUH?

319
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,541
- I BOUGHT SOME
TAIYAKI EARLIER TODAY.

320
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,500
- TAIYAKI?

321
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,583
- THE VENDOR SAID
THAT EATING IT WARM

322
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,458
WOULD BE THE BEST WAY
TO ENJOY IT.

323
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,250
- AND THAT'S THE REASON
YOU CAME HERE?

324
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,416
- WELL, I WISHED TO EAT
SOME TOGETHER WITH YOU.

325
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,083
UNFORTUNATELY,
HE ONLY HAD ONE LEFT.

326
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,625
- OH.

327
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,291
OHH.

328
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,041
HERE, KAORU-SAMA.

329
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:39,791
- ( chuckles )

330
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,250
THIS END IS FINE WITH ME.

331
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,708
( chews )
MMM.

332
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,583
- ( chews )

333
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,583
IT'S DELICIOUS.

334
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,125
STANDING OUTDOORS LIKE THIS

335
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,750
WHILE EATING SOME TAIYAKI

336
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,583
SOMEHOW MAKES MY HEART
RACE A BIT.

337
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,875
- COULD THIS BE
THE FIRST TIME 

338
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,208
YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING
LIKE THIS?

339
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,166
- YES.

340
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,250
- OH, YEAH.
HOLD ON.

341
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,250
DO YOU WANNA GO OUT
WITH ME SOMEWHERE? 

342
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,333
- I'M FINISHED WITH ALL
OF MY LECTURES FOR TODAY.

343
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,791
- DO YOU REALLY MEAN IT?

344
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,625
- WE'LL GO WHEREVER
YOU WOULD LIKE TO GO.

345
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,250
- WHEREVER I WOULD
LIKE TO GO.

346
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,291
ARE YOU REALLY SURE?

347
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,458
- SO WHERE TO NOW?

348
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:20,958
SHOPPING OR A MOVIE?

349
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,000
- WELL, IF WE CAN DO
WHATEVER I'D LIKE...

350
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,458
- MM-HMM.

351
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:30,333
- THEN I WOULD LIKE
A TOUR OF YOUR UNIVERSITY.

352
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,083
- ( gasps )
A TOUR?

353
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,125
- YES.

354
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,916
- THIS IS THE CLASSROOM.

355
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,250
I ALWAYS SIT
RIGHT OVER THERE.

356
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,083
- OH, IS THAT SO?

357
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:48,250
- MAN, WHAT I WOULDN'T GIVE.
- YOU THINK SO?

358
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,916
- ABSOLUTELY, HANABISHI.

359
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,625
- AND THIS IS WHERE I ALWAYS
EAT YOUR LUNCHES, AOI-CHAN. 

360
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,666
- OH, RIGHT HERE.

361
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,625
WHEN I EAT AT HOME
FROM NOW ON,

362
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,250
I'LL ALWAYS THINK
OF THIS SPOT.

363
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,583
- ( meows )
- HUH?

364
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,583

365
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,916
- OH, IT'S YOU AGAIN.

366
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,250
- ( meows )

367
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,416
- COULD THIS BE THE CAT
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT?

368
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,250
- YEAH.  THE STRAY THAT 
POPS UP EVERYWHERE I GO.

369
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,583
- ( meows )

370
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:15,916

- ( panting )

373
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,916
- SO THE JAPANESE BEAUTY
IN TRADITIONAL CLOTHES

374
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,541
WAS YOUR LANDLORD, HUH?

375
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:24,916
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

376
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,250
- OH.

377
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,541

379
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,625
- ( camera shutter clicks )

380
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,875
- Kaoru: I WONDER IF
THIS WAS REALLY FUN FOR YOU.

381
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,291
- YES.
IT WAS VERY ENJOYABLE.

382
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,708
TODAY WAS A TRULY
WONDERFUL DAY.

383
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,250
TO BE HONEST,
KAORU-SAMA,

384
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,666
I WANTED TO SEE
THIS PLACE JUST ONCE.

385
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,000
- HMM?

386
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,416
- IT'S JUST THAT...

387
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,916
THE MORE I HEAR
FROM EVERYONE

388
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,916
ABOUT HOW MUCH FUN
YOU ALL HAVE HERE...

389
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,916

390
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,250
I SEE.

391
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,916
SO THAT'S WHY.

392
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,916
- ( giggles )

393
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,333
TODAY, I WAS ABLE TO SEE
MANY SIDES OF YOU

394
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,791
THAT I NEVER SAW BEFORE.

395
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,166
IT WAS SO WONDERFUL

396
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,916
SEEING YOU AT
YOUR UNIVERSITY.

397
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,625
I THINK I'VE FALLEN
EVEN MORE IN LOVE WITH YOU,

398
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:22,958
IF THAT'S POSSIBLE.

399
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,958
- AOI-CHAN.

400
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,875
I'LL TRY TO TELL YOU

404
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:37,750
AND WHAT I'VE HEARD.

405
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:40,083
I'LL TELL YOU...

00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,791
- TINA.

413
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,458
- YOU WERE ABLE
TO FIND MISS AOI.

414
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,625
- KAORU, YOU SHOULD
HAVE CONTACTED US. 

415
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:04,958
WE WERE WORRIED,
YOU KNOW.

416
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,166
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

417
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,125

TO HAVE WORRIED YOU.

418
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,750
- OH, MAN.
I'M REALLY STARVING NOW.

419
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,250

420
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,916
AS SOON AS WE ALL

421
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,250
( gasps )

422
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,583
I FORGET I HAVEN'T
GONE SHOPPING TODAY.

423
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:18,708
I'M SORRY.

424
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:19,791
- WHAT?

425
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,583
BUT IT CAN'T BE.

426
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,583
- THEN HOW ABOUT WE ALL
GO OUT AND EAT DINNER

427
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:24,916
TOGETHER FOR ONCE?

428
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,791

WHAT DO YOU FEEL LIKE,
TAE?

432
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,208
- HOW ABOUT SUSHI?

433
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,583
- All: SUSHI?

434
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,583
- Taeko: I MEAN,
TURNTABLE SUSHI.

435
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,791
- Aoi:
WHAT IS TURNTABLE SUSHI?

436
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,125
- Tina: IT'S WHEN THE SUSHI
SPINS ROUND AND ROUND.

437
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,916
- Aoi:
THE SUSHI REALLY SPINS?

HOW DOES ONE EAT LIKE THAT?

441
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,791

00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

443
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:23,416
- I AM MAYU MIYUKI.

00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,416
I STUDIED IN ENGLAND
FOUR YEARS AGO,

450
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:35,708
