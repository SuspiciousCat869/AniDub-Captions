1
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,583
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:41,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,541
- ( breathes deeply )

4
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,625
KAORU-SAMA.

5
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,458
- ( sighs )

6
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:32,416
( sighs )
AOI-CHAN...

7
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,791
OH, THIS ISN'T GOOD.

8
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,875
IF I KEEP THIS UP, I'LL NEVER
TURN THIS IN ON TIME.

9
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:38,875
HUH?

10
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,916
- ( gulps )

11
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,416
AAH! OH, MAN!

12
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,708
TEA SURE HITS THE SPOT
AFTER A NICE HOT BATH.

13
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,125
- TINA, WHY DON'T YOU KNOCK
BEFORE YOU COME INTO MY ROOM?

14
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,583
OKAY?
- OH, COME ON, KAORU.

15
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,916
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE
STRANGERS OR ANYTHING.

16
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,083
- QUIT IT, ALREADY.

17
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,000
SHE SMELLS GOOD.

18
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,583
UH...

19
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,166
- WE'RE NEIGHBORS LIVING 
UNDER THE SAME ROOF HERE.

20
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,041
SO WE OUGHT
TO BE NEIGHBORLY.

21
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,375
RIGHT, KAORU?
- COME ON, LET GO OF ME.

22
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,708
IF AOI-CHAN
SAW ME LIKE THIS...

23
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,250
- ( knocking )
- HUH?!

24
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,333
- ( knocking )

25
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,125
- THIS ISN'T
WHAT YOU THINK!

26
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:20,458
HUH?

27
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:27,375
- TAEKO-CHAN?
- HUH? IT'S TAE?

28
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,750
- HELLO, THERE.

29
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,000
GOOD EVENING.

30
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,666
- YES, UNDERSTOOD.

31
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,583
SO THE SAKURA
DEPARTMENT STORE'S

32
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,791
MONTHLY BOARD MEETINGS
WILL BE THEN.

33
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:44,791
HUH?

34
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,583
NO, JUST SOMETHING
ON THIS END.

35
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,666
YES, I UNDERSTAND.

36
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,625
THE YOKOHAMA BRANCH
SALES REPORT.

37
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,125
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

38
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,625
YES.  AND NOW,
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

39
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,958
- ( phone beeps )

40
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,833
- ( sighs )

41
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:08,416
- I SEE.  SO THIS IS ONE
OF YOUR SCHOOL MATES, IS IT?

42
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,000
- YEAH, TAEKO MINAZUKI.

43
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:14,083
- I'M SORRY.  I KNOW THIS
IS KIND OF SUDDEN.

44
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:17,416
- IT'S ALSO LATE. WHAT BROUGHT
YOU HERE, MISS TAEKO?

45
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,250
- ( sighs )

46
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,875
- TAE JUST GOT FIRED.

47
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,416
- SHE DID?
- YES.

48
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,750
I WAS FIRED JUST A FEW HOURS AGO
AS A MATTER OF FACT.

49
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,208
- GOODNESS.
- OH!

50
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,750
- OH, I'M SORRY.
WHAT WAS YOUR JOB EXACTLY

51
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,375
IF I MAY ASK?

52
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,875
- SHE'S A LIVE-IN HOUSEKEEPER.
- HOUSEKEEPER?

53
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,875
- YES, AND THAT'S--
AND THAT'S WHY I--

54
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,500
WHY I...
( sniffs )

55
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,583
DON'T HAVE A PLACE
TO LIVE ANYMORE.

56
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,666
- SO THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE HERE.

57
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,125
- YES.  I REMEMBERED
TINA-SENPAI ONCE TOLD ME

58
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,833
THAT I COULD
COME TO HER FOR ADVICE

59
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,666
IF ANYTHING EVER HAPPENED.

60
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,083
- OH, YEAH, I DID.

61
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,500
ALL RIGHT THEN, TAE.

62
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,750
I'LL GIVE YOU THE BEST ADVICE
THAT I CAN GIVE YOU.

63
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,791
I'M ALWAYS READY TO
LEND A HELPING HAND

64
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,291
OR TWO TO OUR
CUTE JUNIOR CLUB MEMBERS.

65
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,000
- YOU KNOW, SENPAI?
- HUH?

66
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,833
- COULD YOU NOT
MESSAGE MY BREASTS?

67
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:08,416
- OH, SORRY.
BAD HABIT, I GUESS.

68
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,291
- YOU NEVER CHANGE.

69
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,166
- SENPAI, WHAT DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD DO ABOUT THIS?

70
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,875
- HMM, WHAT CAN YOU DO?

71
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,625
- Tina: HEY, I JUST THOUGHT
OF A GREAT IDEA.

72
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,333
TAE, YOU CAN WORK 
RIGHT HERE FOR US.

73
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,375
YOU'LL HAVE A JOB
AND A PLACE TO LIVE.

74
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:24,958
AND ALL YOUR PROBLEMS
WILL BE SOLVED.

75
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,125
- YEAH?

76
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,750
- THAT'S NOT YOUR DECISION
TO MAKE, TINA!

77
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,500
- THAT'S OKAY,
MISS LANDLORD.

78
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,750
AFTER ALL, WE STILL
GOT EMPTY ROOMS.

79
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,208
- TINA!
- PLEASE!

80
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,416
PRETTY PLEASE
WITH CHERRIES ON TOP.

81
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,583
- MISS TINA, I'VE HEARD
THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

82
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:42,750
AND I TRULY WOULD LIKE
TO HIRE MISS TAEKO, MYSELF.

83
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:43,833
- HONESTLY?

84
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,416
- HOWEVER, MISS MIYABI
IS THE ONE

85
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,250
WHO HANDLES AFFAIRS
SUCH AS THESE, NOT ME.

86
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,250
- THE-- THE MANAGER?!

87
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,416
I SEE, SO IT'S HER.

88
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,083
- ( both sigh )

89
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,291
- IT'S ALL RIGHT. 
IT'S MY OWN FAULT.

90
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,291
SORRY TO HAVE
TROUBLED YOU.

91
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,708
GOOD-BYE.
( cries )

92
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:01,708
- TAEKO-CHAN!
- HEY!

93
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,916
- Aoi and Kaoru:
MISS MIYABI.

94
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,666
- UH, I'M SORRY.

95
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,791
- I OVERHEARD EVERYTHING.
- HUH?

96
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,041
- MISS MIYABI.
- YOU MEAN TO TELL US

97
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,583
THAT YOU--
- SO YOU'LL DO IT?

98
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,458
YOU'LL HIRE TAE,
MISS MANAGER?

99
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,750
- BEING SO SHORT-HANDED HERE
WAS MAKING THINGS DIFFICULT.

100
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,958
- OH!
- HOWEVER,

101
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,958
THE ENTIRE DAY TOMORROW
WILL BE A TRIAL PERIOD.

102
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,666
IF YOU PERFORM
WELL ENOUGH,

103
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,541
I'LL ALLOW YOU
TO BE HOUSEKEEPER.

104
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:30,916
IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,666
- YE-- YES.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, MA'AM.

106
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,166
I'LL DO MY BEST.

107
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,000
- ISN'T THIS GREAT, TAE?
- IT'S WONDERFUL.

108
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,708
( mutters sleepily )

109
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,250
NO, DON'T EAT
THAT ACTION FIGURE.

110
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,791
THAT'S NOT FOOD,
YOU KNOW?

111
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,500
THAT'S ONE OF THOSE
MAGICAL GIRLS.

112
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,625
( sighs ) OH!
( screams )

113
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:01,708
( thudding )

114
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,125
OWW.

115
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,708
( gasps )

116
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:08,750
MISS MIYABI, 
GOOD MORNING.

117
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,750
- HOW LONG
WILL YOU SLEEP?

118
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,625
THE HOUSEKEEPER IS SUPPOSED
TO BE GETTING UP

119
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,916
BEFORE EVERYONE ELSE.
THAT'S COMMON SENSE! 

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,583
- I'M SORRY.

121
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,166
( pants )

122
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,458
OH, I HAVE
TO CHANGE FIRST.

123
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,916
- ( grunts )
- ( bubbling )

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,875
- YOU WERE RECENTLY EMPLOYED
AS A HOUSEKEEPER ELSEWHERE, 

125
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,500
SO MAY I ASSUME THAT
YOU DO KNOW HOW TO COOK?

126
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,208
- YES, I'M NOT SO BAD.

127
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,250
THAT'S STRANGE.
- WHAT IS IT?

128
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,916
- I CAN'T FIND THE INSTANT
MISO SOUP MIX.

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,541
- ( grunts ) WE DO NOT USE
CHEMICAL ADDITIVES

130
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,875
IN THE SAKURABA HOUSEHOLD.

131
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,500
YOU WILL MAKE BROTH
FROM SCRATCH!

132
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,708
- OH, UH, OKAY.

133
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,416
- WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED
PREPARING BREAKFAST,

134
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,583
IMMEDIATELY GO AND WAKE UP

135
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,458
BOTH SIR KAORU
AND MISS TINA.

136
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:49,666
- I WILL.

137
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,166
- Taeko: SENPAI.
SENPAI, PLEASE GET UP.

138
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,500
IT'S MORNING.
- ( groans ) 

139
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,916
GIVE ME A FEW MINUTES.
OKAY, AOI-CHAN?

140
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,416
- COME ON, WAKE UP, SENPAI.

141
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,208
WAKE UP!

142
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,875
- JUST A BIT LONGER.

143
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,083
- OH!
- HMM.

144
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,708
HUH?
- ( gasps )

145
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,750
( screams )

146
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,666
- WHOA.
- HUH?

147
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,125
- WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?
- WHAT WAS THAT SCREAM JUST NOW?

148
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,375
- ( gasping )

149
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,083
- HELLO.
- UH, AOI-CHAN.

150
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,875
THIS IS-- UH...

151
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:31,125
- WHOO-HOO, KAORU,
YOU'RE A TOTAL PERV.

152
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,291
- IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.
TAEKO-CHAN FELL OVER

153
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,750
AND WE ENDED UP
LIKE THIS.

154
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,833
- MISS TAEKO!

155
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,000
- AH, I'M SORRY.

156
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,416
- Kaoru:
HEY, IT LOOKS GREAT.

157
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,125
- WHOA, YOU ACTUALLY
COOKED ALL THIS

158
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,625
BY YOURSELF, TAE?
- YES, I DID THE BEST I COULD.

159
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,875
- Miyabi: WELL THEN,
WE HAD BETTER EAT NOW.

160
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,083
- Aoi: YES, LET'S.

161
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,041
- All: WE'LL BE EATING NOW.

162
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,916
- HEY, CLAM MISO SOUP, HUH?

163
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,458
- NOTHING LIKE STARTING THE DAY
WITH A BOWL OF MISO SOUP.

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,916
- All: SANDY.

165
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,291
- HUH? IS IT NOT GOOD?

166
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,000
- MISS TAEKO,

167
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,083
DID YOU REMEMBER
TO PURGE THE CLAMS?

168
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,875
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY
"PURGE THE CLAMS"?

169
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:18,958
- ( muffled grunt )

170
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:23,083
- OH! I'M SORRY, MA'AM.

171
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,750
- HEY, DON'T GET SO
DOWN IN THE DUMPS, TAE.

172
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,416
- THAT'S RIGHT.
WE'RE ALL ALLOWED

173
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,416
TO MAKE A MISTAKE OR TWO.
- BUT STILL--

174
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,666
- WE'RE ALL ROOTING
FOR YOU, HERE.

175
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,541
SO CHEER UP.
- YEAH, GO FOR BROKE!

176
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,333
- OKAY, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

177
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,166
- SENPAI-- 
HUH?

178
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,625
- ( meowing )

179
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,458
- WILL YOU ALSO
BE ROOTING FOR ME?

180
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,583
- ( meows )
- ( giggles )

181
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,125
- SENPAI, THANK YOU
FOR THE SUPPORT.

182
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,041
THANK YOU.
I'LL DO MY BEST.

183
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,833
- YEAH, THAT'S THE SPIRIT!
- Taeko: RIGHT.

184
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,458
- ( sighs )

185
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,583
- HMPH.

186
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,291
- Miyabi: UNDERSTOOD?

187
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,750
IF THERE IS EVEN
ONE SPECK OF DIRT LEFT,

188
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,916
WE'LL REPEAT THIS EXERCISE
TILL THERE IS NONE.

189
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,333
- YES, I WILL DO
MY VERY BEST.

190
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,250
- ( grunts )

191
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,416
- MISS TAEKO.
- HUH?

192
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,083
- SUCH LITTLE EFFORT
WON'T GET THESE FLOORS CLEAN.

193
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,458
PUT YOUR HIPS INTO IT,
YOUR HIPS!

194
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,583
- RIGHT, MY HIPS.

195
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:33,083
( strains ) HIPS, HIPS.

196
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,291
HIPS, HIPS.
- THAT'S THE WAY.

197
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,916
- HIPS, HIPS, HIPS.

198
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,958
- ( gasps )
- MISS TAEKO, WAIT!

199
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,291
- HUH? OH.

200
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,708
- ( both gasping )

201
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,833
- ( sighs )

202
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,375
- I'M SORRY!

203
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,791
- ( grunts )

204
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,500
- WHOA!

205
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,916
- ( pottery breaks )

206
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,041
- I'M SORRY.

207
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:05,791
- UH, THIS VASE WAS
A FAMILY HEIRLOOM.

208
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,166
AHH!
- I'M SORRY!

209
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,541
- ENOUGH.

210
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:16,083
THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH,
MISS TAEKO!

211
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,291
YOU ARE TERMINATED!

212
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,958
- WHAT?!

213
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,000
TERMINATED!

214
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,250
N-- NO! PLEASE WAIT!

215
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,541
- Miyabi: LET GO!
- PLEASE!

216
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,625
- Aoi: MISS TAEKO.
- Miyabi: LET ME GO!

217
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:38,166
- ( whimpering )
OH, I BEG YOU, MISS MIYABI.

218
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,875
PLEASE, MA'AM!
I'LL IMPROVE. 

219
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,833
SO PLEASE DON'T
FIRE ME OVER THIS.

220
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,958
MISS MIYABI!
- YOU SHOULD FIND

221
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,250
ANOTHER LINE OF WORK.

222
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,083
- BUT I CAN'T THINK
OF BEING ANYTHING ELSE

223
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,416
BUT A HOUSEKEEPER.

224
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,916
IT'S JUST SOMETHING
I HAVE TO DO.

225
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,958
- THIS CAREER
DOESN'T SUIT YOU.

226
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,125
- ( gasps )

227
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,583
MISS MIYABI,

228
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,166
GIVE ME A CHANCE,
JUST ONE.

229
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,666
I'LL DO THINGS RIGHT.

230
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,333
I'LL DO MY BEST,
SO PLEASE GIVE ME A CHANCE.

231
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,833
I PROMISE TO PUT IN
EVEN MORE EFFORT.

232
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,791
SO I BEG YOU, PLEASE.

233
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:10,666
- MISS TAEKO,
WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT?

234
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:22,083
- ( cat meows )

235
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,666
- Aoi: MISS TAEKO.
- HUH?

236
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,291
MISS LANDLORD, PLEASE.

237
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,625
- I COULD USE A LITTLE HELP
IN HANGING THE LAUNDRY.

238
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,333
- LAUNDRY? BUT, MA'AM,
I'M NO LONGER--

239
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,916
- WELL, SHALL WE START?

240
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,375
- OH.

241
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,458
- YOU'RE A HARD WORKER.

242
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:41,958
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
MISS TAEKO?

243
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,125
- HUH?

244
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:46,208
- YOU'RE GIVING THIS
A LOT OF EFFORT.

245
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:49,041
I CAN TELL.
- MISS LANDLORD,

246
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,416
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE I--

247
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,250
I'D FEEL SORRY
FOR MY MOTHER 

248
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,708
IF I JUST GIVE UP
LIKE THAT.

249
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:59,041
- YOU SEE, SHE'S
A SINGLE PARENT.

250
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,125
MY FATHER PASSED AWAY 
WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG.

251
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,416
AND EVER SINCE THEN,
MY MOTHER RAISED ME 

252
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,291
ALL BY HERSELF.

253
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,625
- ( television chatter )

254
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,166
- ( door opens )
- ( gasps )

255
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,000
- I'M HOME.
- WELCOME BACK.

256
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,250
- UM, MOM,
UH, LOOK AT THIS.

257
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,791
MY SKIRT GOT RIPPED, SEE?
- OH MY.

258
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,666
TAKE IT OFF,
SO I CAN SEW IT.

259
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,750
- Present Taeko:
SHE ALWAYS TRIED HER BEST

260
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,708
WHEN SHE DID THINGS.
AND SHE COULD DO ANYTHING!

261
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,791
- ( chopping )
- MOM, I'M REALLY HUNGRY!

262
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,916
- HMM, JUST WAIT
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

263
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,583
I'M MAKING
SOMETHING DELICIOUS.

264
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,500
- ( giggles )

265
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,083
- Present Taeko: I GREW UP
AROUND A MOTHER LIKE THAT.

266
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,833
AND THAT'S WHY I--
I WANTED THIS JOB,

267
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,041
SO I COULD BE
MORE LIKE MY MOTHER.

268
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,750
- SO THAT'S THE REASON.

269
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,083
- I HAVE TO DO MY BEST.

270
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,083
I'M A REALLY CLUMSY PERSON.

271
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:06,500
I HAVE TO GIVE MY ALL
JUST TO BE EVEN AVERAGE.

272
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:08,875
- HUH?

273
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,208
- BUT STILL, MAYBE 
BEING A HOUSEKEEPER

274
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,208
JUST ISN'T POSSIBLE FOR ME.

275
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,708
- MISS TAEKO.

276
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,250
NOT AT ALL.

277
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,791
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S THE CASE.

278
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,791
- HUH?
- I WAS THE SAME AS YOU.

279
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,708
I AM A RATHER CLUMSY PERSON
MYSELF.

280
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,083
NOTHING I EVER DID
WENT RIGHT

281
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,416
AND MISS MIYABI
CONSTANTLY SCOLDED ME.

282
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,625
- SHE DID?
- BUT I WANTED

283
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,500
TO BE ABLE TO DO
THE HOUSEHOLD CHORES WELL.

284
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,833
AND I PUT ALL THE EFFORT
I COULD INTO IT.

285
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,916
THAT'S HOW I KNOW THAT
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

286
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,041
IF YOU TRULY WISH
TO BECOME A HOUSEKEEPER,

287
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,833
I'M SURE
YOU WILL BE ONE.

288
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,541
YOU'LL BE FINE.

289
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,958
- MISS LANDLORD, THANKS A LOT
FOR THE PEP TALK.

290
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,250
I'LL DO MY VERY BEST.

291
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,750
ALL RIGHT!

292
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:02,291
NOW LET'S GET THE REST
OF THE LAUNDRY ALL HUNG UP.

293
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,208
- ( knocking )
- COME ON IN. 

294
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,000
- WOULD YOU LIKE TEA?
- OH, AOI-CHAN, IT'S YOU?

295
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,000
- HOW IS YOUR REPORT GOING?
- PRETTY WELL.

296
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,291
I THINK I OUGHT TO
BE FINISHED BY DINNER.

297
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,541
- OH, I SEE.
I BROUGHT YOU SOME TEA.

298
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,625
SO WHY DON'T YOU 
REST FOR A WHILE?

299
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,375
KAORU-SAMA?
- HUH?

300
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,458
- MISS TAEKO
IS AN AMAZING PERSON.

301
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:31,458
- YEAH.
- BOTH MY PARENTS ARE ALIVE.

302
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,791
AND I NEVER HAD
ANY PROBLEMS GROWING UP.

303
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:37,083
I DON'T KNOW THE PAIN
THAT MISS TAEKO HAS SUFFERED.

304
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:40,416
SO THAT'S WHY I FEEL
SOMEWHAT AWKWARD AROUND HER,

305
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,625
I'M ASHAMED TO ADMIT.
- AOI-CHAN.

306
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,166
I KNOW YOU'RE DOING
THE BEST THAT YOU CAN.

307
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,333
- EXCEPT I DON'T HAVE
HARDSHIPS ANYMORE.

308
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,375
- HUH?

309
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,000
- THE ONLY THING I COULD DO

310
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,083
WAS IMAGINE IT
IN MY HEART BEFORE.

311
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,375
NOW, I'M ABLE TO SEE

312
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,791
YOUR GENTLE FACE 
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

313
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,250
I CAN TOUCH YOU LIKE THIS.

314
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:07,000
AND I'M VERY HAPPY NOW.

315
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,791
SO...

316
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:14,500
KAORU-SAMA, I HOPE
THAT YOU'LL FORGIVE ME

317
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:17,041
FOR BEING SO SELFISH.

318
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,750
- AOI-CHAN.

319
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,166
- KAORU-SAMA.

320
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,416
- ( knocking )
- ( both gasp )

321
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,250
- EXCUSE ME, SENPAI.

322
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,416
HMM? WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU DOING?

323
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,458
- HUH? OH, NOTHING.

324
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:34,916
( nervous laugh )

325
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,125
- I SEE.
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?

326
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,416
WHAT'D YOU COME HERE FOR?
- OH, YEAH.

327
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,916
HAVE YOU SEEN THE LANDLORD
AROUND HERE ANYWHERE?

328
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,916
- NOT REALLY. WHY DO YOU
NEED HER, TAEKO-CHAN?

329
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,083
- I WAS THINKING ABOUT

330
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,083
MAYBE CLEANING
THE BATHROOM TODAY,

331
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,291
BUT I COULDN'T
FIND THE CLEANSER.

332
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,083
- THEN WHY DON'T YOU ASK
MISS MIYABI?

333
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,541
- SHE'S NOT COMING OUT
OF HER ROOM FOR SOME REASON.

334
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,875
- I SEE, THAT'S A PROBLEM, HUH?

335
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:02,416
- YEAH, OH, SORRY TO BOTHER YOU
DURING YOUR REPORT WRITING.

336
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,875
I'LL KEEP LOOKING.

337
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,125
- ( sighs )
- ( Aoi giggles )

338
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,791
 - HUH?
- ( giggling )

339
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,833
- ( both laughing )

340
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,750
- AOI-CHAN.

341
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,041
- IT'S WARM HERE.

342
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,916
I SHOULD CHECK UP ON HER.

343
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,708
I'LL GO NOW.
- OKAY.

344
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,083
- I'LL JUST
STAY A BIT LONGER.

345
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,625
- HMM.

346
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,500
- YES.  HIPS.

347
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,833
( gasps )
WHOA-OH-OH-OH.

348
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,750
- ( gasps )

349
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,125
- ( thudding )
- OWW!

350
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,916
( moans )

351
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,916
( pants )

352
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,500
OH!

353
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,375
- OH, MISS TAEKO.

354
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,291
- ( gasps )

355
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,916
( gasping )

356
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,000
HM-HMM.

357
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,458
- ( chopping )

358
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,666
- Taeko: TIME FOR DINNER!

359
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,875
- Tina and Kaoru: OKAY!

360
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,083
- IT'S BEEN A ROUGH TIME
FOR TAEKO-CHAN.

361
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,250
- THE MANAGER'S
SURE BEEN TOUGH ON HER.

362
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,958
BUT I REALLY WANT TAE
TO PASS HER TEST.

363
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,250
- HEY, LISTEN, TINA.

364
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,791
NO MATTER WHAT'S
SERVED FOR DINNER,

365
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,583
LET'S SAY IT'S DELICIOUS.
- YOU CAN COUNT ON ME.

366
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,208
US KYUSHU GALS KNOW
HOW TO GRIN AND BEAR IT.

367
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,208
THEN WE'LL WORK TOGETHER
AND TAEKO-CHAN

368
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,500
WILL BE OUR HOUSEKEEPER.
- Both: YEAH!

369
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,541
- OH!

370
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,208
UH, THAT IS--

371
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,791
- I TAKE IT THAT
DINNER IS READY,

372
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,291
- Y-- YES.

373
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:02,416
- MISS TAEKO,
IF THIS IS NO GOOD,

374
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,000
YOU KNOW
WHAT WILL HAPPEN.

375
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,041
- YES, MA'AM.

376
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,708
- WHOA, WHAT A FEAST!

377
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,583
- WE'VE NEVER HAD
WESTERN FOOD HERE BEFORE.

378
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,458
- IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'LL BE DELICIOUS.

379
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:18,083
- ARE YOU READY, TINA?
- YOU BET.

380
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,250
I'M READY FOR THE WORST.

381
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,416
- HUH.
- EVERYONE,

382
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,208
WE SHOULD EAT BEFORE
IT GETS COLD.

383
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,458
- OH, RIGHT.

384
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,916
- All: TIME TO EAT.

385
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,750
HUH?

386
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,166
- HUH?!

387
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:43,166
- MY.
- WHOA, EVERYTHING'S DELICIOUS!

388
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,833
THIS IS GREAT, TAE.

389
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,625
- DO YOU REALLY MEAN IT?

390
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,208
THANK YOU FOR SAYING SO.

391
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,166
- IT'S REALLY DELICIOUS.

392
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,666
- UM...

393
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,750
- MISS TAEKO.
- YES, MA'AM.

394
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,833
- PLEASE CONTINUE PERFORMING
AT THIS LEVEL.

395
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,625
- HUH?
- THEN ARE YOU SAYING...

396
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,750
- YEAH! SHE PASSED!

397
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,750
- I-- I CAN STAY?

398
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,333
- YOU DID IT, TAEKO-CHAN.

399
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,333
- CONGRATULATIONS.

400
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,458
- YEAH! CONGRATULATIONS!

401
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,833
WELCOME TO YOUR
NEW HOME AND JOB, TAE.

402
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,333
- I'M NOT GOOD AT COOKING
WESTERN CUISINE.

403
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,000
SO I HOPE YOU'LL BE WILLING
TO TEACH ME, MISS TAEKO.

404
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:31,208
- MISS AOI,
THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH.

405
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,916
- OH, BUT I REALLY
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING AT ALL.

406
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,166
THIS IS WONDERFUL, ISN'T IT?

407
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,708
- OH, YEAH.

408
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,166

409
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,375

00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,500
- PARDON THE INTRUSION.

413
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,916
- IS SOMETHING THE MATTER,
MISS MIYABI?

414
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,208
- ONLY THAT SOMEONE'S BOOK
WAS LEFT IN THE KITCHEN.

415
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,000
- ( gasps )

416
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,125
- I THOUGHT THAT IT HAD
BELONGED TO MISS TAEKO,

417
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,458
BUT LOOKING INSIDE...

418
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:15,666
I RECOGNIZED YOUR
HANDWRITING.

419
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,708
- I WAS JUST, UM,
YOU SEE...

420
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,208
- AND THAT'S ALL
I CAME TO SAY.

421
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:26,083
- MISS MIYABI.
- YES, WHAT IS IT?

422
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,541
- THANK YOU, MISS MIYABI.

423
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000

427
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,958
YES, MA'AM.

428
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,083
I'LL TRY EVEN HARDER.

THE HOT SPRINGS. I'M SO HAPPY.

432
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:28,041
- Miyabi:
HOW WONDERFUL FOR YOU.

433
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:30,875
- Aoi: AI YORI AOSHI,
"SPIRITUAL ILLUSION."

434
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:33,083
MEN AND WOMEN
WELCOMED WITH SAKE?

435
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:36,208
- Miyabi: WHAT COULD THAT MEAN,
LADY AOI?
