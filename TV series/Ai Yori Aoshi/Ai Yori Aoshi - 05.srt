1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,916
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:06,208
- KAORU-SAMA, HAVE YOU
FORGOTTEN ANYTHING?

4
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:10,375
- NOPE. OH, THE MISO SOUP WITH
DAIKON RADISHES WAS DELICIOUS.

5
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,041
- THANK YOU FOR
THE COMPLIMENT.

6
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,041
YOU WERE SAYING HOW
THE FOOD FROM THE OTHER DAY

7
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,083
WAS TREMENDOUSLY
DELICIOUS ALSO. 

8
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,208
- EVERYTHING THAT YOU COOK
IS JUST SO DELICIOUS, AOI-CHAN.

9
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,416
- OH MY.
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME.

10
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,875
- AOI-CHAN.

11
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,833
- KAORU-SAMA.

12
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,875
- ( Miyabi clears throat )
- Both: HUH?

13
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,875
- SIR KAORU,

14
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,541
YOU DO UNDERSTAND
THE SITUATION, CORRECT?

15
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:32,875
- YEAH.
- EXCELLENT.

16
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,416
LADY AOI IS THE LANDLORD.

17
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,208
I AM THE MANAGER.

18
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,791
AND YOU, SIR KAORU,
AS ONE OF OUR TENANTS HERE--

19
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,041
- PLEASE, I'VE HAD ENOUGH
OF HEARING THAT STORY.

20
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,541
- LADY AOI.

21
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,250
- OH, I'M GONNA BE LATE.

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,208
- TAKE CARE ON YOUR WAY
TO SCHOOL, KAORU-SAMA. 

23
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:50,958
- I'LL BE GOING
ON MY WAY THEN.

24
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:54,083
- HOW RUDE OF HIM.

25
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,958
- WHAT THE HECK?

26
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,916
THERE'S NO FIRST PERIOD
LECTURE TODAY?

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,375
- I WOULD HAVE RELAXED
A BIT MORE AT HOME IF I KNEW.

28
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,875
- HANABISHI!
- HUH?

29
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,333
- YO.

30
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,125
- SUZUKI.

31
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:18,125
WHAT?
YOU'RE CLUB PRESIDENT NOW?

32
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,916
- YEP, I'M PRES,
AND SATO'S VICE-PRES.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,583
- Kaoru: I HAD NO IDEA.

34
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,500
- THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU HAVEN'T
SHOWN UP FOR CLUB STUFF LATELY.

35
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:27,750
- THAT'S NOT SO TERRIBLE
WHEN THE ONLY OTHER CLUB MEMBERS

36
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,416
BESIDES ME ARE YOU TWO.

37
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,833
- MM.  IS THAT
REALLY TRUE NOW?

38
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:34,291
- HUH?
- OH-OH.

39
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:37,625
- ( gasps )

40
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,541
- OOH.

41
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:41,875
- HEY THERE,
MINAZUKI.

42
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,541
- OH, CHIEF. 
GOOD MORNING.

43
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:49,000
OHH!
- ( gasps )

44
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,416
- ( sighs )

45
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,625
( screams )

46
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,541
- ( crashing )

47
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,500
- IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.
I'M TAEKO MINAZUKI,

48
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:00,000
A SOPHOMORE, AND I JUST JOINED
THE PHOTO CLUB RECENTLY.

49
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,666
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS,

50
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,500
BUT I'LL DO MY
VERY BEST TO LEARN.

51
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,166
I PLACE MYSELF
IN YOUR HANDS.

52
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,500
- UH... SAY,

53
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:09,708
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU,

54
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,833
BUT ARE YOU OKAY?

55
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,875
- YES.  MY BODY HAS
BECOME TOUGHENED

56
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,291
BY THESE SORTS OF THINGS.

57
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,625
- ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS 
IS PRETTY MUCH THE NORM,

58
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:17,625
FOR YOU AT LEAST.

59
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:18,875
- YEAH.

60
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,416
- OH, IS THAT TRUE?

61
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,541
- LISTEN, MINAZUKI,

62
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,041
WHEN YOU'RE WIPING DOWN
THE PARASOLS,

63
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,708
FOLD UP THE STANDS FIRST.

64
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,375
THAT WAY YOU WON'T
HAVE TO CLIMB LADDERS

65
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,875
TO REACH THEM.
- OH, I SEE.

66
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,625
I NEVER REALIZED.

67
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,375
I'LL DO THAT
FROM NOW ON.

68
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,375
- ( chuckles )

69
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,791
- CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

70
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,291
- SURE.
GO RIGHT AHEAD AND ASK.

71
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,875
- IS DRESSING LIKE THAT
SOME SORT OF HOBBY?

72
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:50,291
- HEY, WHAT HOBBY HAS PEOPLE
DRESSING LIKE THIS, YOU IDIOT?

73
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,416
- BUT THEN... 
WHAT'S IT FOR?

74
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,750
- WELL, THIS IS WHAT 
VICE-PRESIDENT SATO--

75
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,375
- Sato: WHOA!

76
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,833
( giggling )

77
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,583
INCREDIBLE!

78
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,625
THREE CHEERS FOR COSPLAY!

79
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,958
- I'M GUESSING THAT 
THE PHOTOS ARE DONE,

80
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,541
RIGHT, VICE-CHIEF?
OHH?

81
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,541
- ( screaming )

82
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,541
- UH, EXCUSE ME?

83
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,916
BUT HAVE I DONE
SOMETHING WRONG AGAIN?

84
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,583
- ( camera shutter clicks )

85
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,208
- THIS IS GREAT,
MINAZUKI.

86
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,541
<i>MAGNIFIQUE!</i>

87
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,375
<i>INCROYABLE!</i>

88
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,208
- I GET IT NOW.

89
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,833
TAEKO-CHAN MUST THINK
THAT THIS IS THE FIRST STEP

90
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,791
TO BECOMING A GREAT
PHOTOGRAPHER.

91
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,041
- ( camera shutter clicks )
- SHE DOESN'T REALIZE

92
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,750
THAT SATO'S JUST USING HER,
THE POOR THING.

93
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,708
- WELL, THEY SAY YOU SHOULD
LEARN YOUR SKILLS ON THE FIELD.

94
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,208
SO HE'S NOT REALLY LYING
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

95
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,916
- SURE SOUNDS CONVENIENT.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,541
- A CLUB MEMBER
WHO NEVER TAKES PICTURES

97
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,541
DOESN'T HAVE THE RIGHT
TO SAY THAT.

98
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,708
- AND WHO WAS IT THAT TOLD ME
TO JOIN THE CLUB IN NAME ONLY

99
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,958
BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAVE
ENOUGH PEOPLE?

100
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,416
- WHO THE HECK
TOLD YOU THAT?

101
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,583
- YOU DID, SUZUKI.

102
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,791
- ANYWAY, I DON'T GET WHY
A GUY WOULD WANT

103
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,541
TO TAKE PICTURES LIKE THAT.

104
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:07,041
AFTER ALL, REAL MEN ONLY
TAKE PICTURES OF THESE BABIES.

105
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,541
- YEAH.  ONLY IF THEY'RE
TRAIN FREAKS LIKE YOU.

106
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,041
- THERE EXISTS NO BEAUTY
THAT CAN COMPARE TO THAT

107
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,791
OF THE MIGHTY LOCOMOTIVE.

108
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,541
MANLY, NOBLE, COURAGEOUS,

109
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,208
AND SOMETIMES GENTLE.

110
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,541
WHENEVER I THINK OF TRAINS,

111
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,208
I'M ALWAYS MOVED TO
UNCONTROLLABLE TEARS.

112
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,875
( crying )

113
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,666
DO YOU UNDERSTAND,
HANABISHI?

114
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,791
- SUZUKI... THE PHOTOS.

115
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,166
- HUH?

116
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,125
( sobbing )

117
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,875
- ( camera shutter clicks )

118
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,208
- NOW THAT I THINK OF IT,

119
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,541
I WONDER HOW SHE'S DOING.

120
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,333
- HUH?  WHO'S THAT?

121
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,666
- YOU KNOW,

122
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,000
THE OTHER PHOTOGRAPHY CLUB
MEMBER FROM LAST YEAR?

123
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,708
- OH YEAH, HER.

124
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,958
WHO THE HECK KNOWS WHERE
SHE COULD BE TRAVELING. 

125
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,958
- I HOPE SHE'S DOING WELL.

126
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,791
- Tina: KAORU!
- HUH?

127
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,250
( gasps )
- ( laughs )

128
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,166
- OW.
- HUH?

129
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,375
- TINA!
- HUH?

130
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:14,166
- KAORU, I CAME HERE
FROM NARITA

131
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,833
'CAUSE I WANTED TO SEE
MY DARLING KAORU.

132
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,166
- T-TINA.

133
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,791
COME ON, WOULD YOU 
GET OFF ME ALREADY?

134
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,625
- HEY, WELL AREN'T YOU
STILL SHY AS EVER.

135
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,583
COME ON, IT'S BEEN
AN ENTIRE YEAR.

136
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,916
- ( stammers )

137
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,541
- OH, THERE'S A NEW MEMBER, HUH?

138
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,166
- I'M TAEKO MINAZUKI.

139
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,500
- AND I'M TINA FOSTER.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

140
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,166
- IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU TOO.
- ( meows )

141
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,833
- I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
TO BE SUCH A FLUENT SPEAKER.

142
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,500
- I'VE BEEN LIVING IN HAKATA
SINCE I WAS FIVE.

143
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,375
- HAKATA?

144
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,083
OH.  IS THAT THE CASE NOW?
( gasps )

145
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,250
HUH?

146
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,708
TINA, SENPAI?

147
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,833
OH, TINA SENPAI PLEASE!

148
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,208
- WHOA!  YOU SURE
GOT BIG BOOBIES. 

149
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,208
YOU'LL MAKE A GREAT
PHOTOGRAPHER.

150
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:02,208
- SORRY, BUT THAT'S HOW TINA
LIKES TO GREET PEOPLE.

151
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,875
- IS THAT REALLY SO?

152
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,541
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.
IT'S TIME TO CELEBRATE MY RETURN

153
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,541
AND WELCOME OUR NEW MEMBER
WITH AN OLD FASHIONED PARTY.

154
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:11,625
LET'S HAVE A BLAST!

155
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:12,875
- SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

156
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,708
- WHAT?  YOU MEAN RIGHT NOW?

157
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,708
BUT IT'S STILL BRIGHT OUT.

158
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,583
- SO WHAT ABOUT THE SIDE DISHES,
LADY AOI?  HUH?

159
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,875
- Aoi: KAORU-SAMA LOVES
THESE SARDINE PATTIES SO MUCH.

160
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,875
I WILL MAKE HIS SLIGHTLY
BIGGER THAN THE OTHERS. 

161
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,208
- ( chuckles )

162
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:44,208
- Tina: SEE?  LOOK,
IT'S THIS PICTURE RIGHT HERE.

163
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,875
- Sato: WOW, COOL!
- Kaoru: WHERE'S THIS?

164
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,208
- Tina: IT'S KENYA.

165
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:52,208
A HUGE OLD SAVANNAH
THAT WENT ON FOREVER.

166
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,541
AND THE SUNRISE WAS
JUST SO BEAUTIFUL THERE.

167
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,375
IT WAS REALLY BREATHTAKING.

168
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,208
- Kaoru:
WOW. AND THIS?

169
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,541
- Tina:
THAT'S AUSTRALIA!

170
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,708
I COUNTED ON HITCHHIKING
TO GET AROUND,

171
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,208
BUT THERE WERE NO CARS!

172
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,750
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA DIE.

173
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,416
THIS IS THE AMAZON.
I BROILED SOME PIRANHAS.

174
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,916
THEY WERE PRETTY GOOD EATING.

175
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,250
- AMAZING.  YOU REALLY DID
TRAVEL AROUND THE WHOLE WORLD.

176
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,458
- OH, YEAH.

177
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,250
- BUT WASN'T IT
REALLY DANGEROUS?

178
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,541
YOU WERE ALL BY YOURSELF,
WEREN'T YOU?

179
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,208
- HA!  I WAS TOTALLY FINE
AND PERFECTLY SAFE.

180
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,875
- UH...

181
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,041
LOOK AT THE TIME.

182
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,458
I'VE GOT TO GET GOING SOON.

183
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,541
- OH YEAH.

184
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,541
I GOT SOUVENIRS
FOR Y'ALL.

185
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,625
- WHAT? WHAT KIND OF
SOUVENIRS?

186
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,416
- PHOTOS OF TRAINS
AROUND THE WORLD? 

187
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,583
- PHOTOS OF COSPLAY
IDOLS AROUND THE WORLD?

188
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,541
- LIKE I'D HAVE
THAT KIND OF STUFF.

189
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,875
I'VE GOT THIS.

190
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,416
- All: HUH?

191
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,416
- IT'S BOOZE THAT
SOMEONE ALONG MY WAY

192
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,000
WAS NICE ENOUGH
TO GIVE TO ME. 

193
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,666
- IS THAT REALLY ALCOHOLIC?

194
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,666
- MAN, THAT'S SOME
QUESTIONABLE LOOKING STUFF.

195
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,875
- AND THAT COLOR
LOOKS LIKE TROUBLE TOO.

196
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,291
- CAN YOU DRINK THAT,
TINA?

197
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,916
- WHAT A RUDE THING TO SAY.

198
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:56,791
WELL, WHO FIRST?

199
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,875
- UH, I THINK I'LL
PASS ON THIS ONE. 

200
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,875
- UH, YEAH, ME TOO.

201
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,875
- AH, WHAT A BUNCH OF WUSSES.

202
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,416
- SHE DID GO THROUGH THE TROUBLE
OF BRINGING THIS BACK FOR US.

203
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,000
I'D BE HONORED TO BE
THE FIRST TO TRY SOME, SENPAI.

204
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,333
- ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

205
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,416
KNOCK IT BACK, GIRL.

206
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,750
- HMM.

207
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,791
- HEY, IF YOU DRINK IT
DOWN LIKE THAT...

208
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,208
- ( sighs )
YES?

209
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,833
- WHAT THE--?
YOU'RE ACTUALLY ALL RIGHT?

210
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,500
- YES.  OF COURSE.

211
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:22,625
IT WAS VERY GOOD.

212
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:23,958
- UH, OKAY.

213
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,083
THAT'S COOL THEN.

214
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,083
COME ON, KAORU.
IT'S YOUR TURN.

215
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,416
- UH, I'VE GOT TO GO
MAKE A PHONE CALL FIRST.

216
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,416
I'LL HAVE A GLASS
WHEN I GET BACK, OKAY?

217
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,375
- FINE THEN.  YOU DON'T
HAVE TO FORCE YOURSELF.

218
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,958
AND I BROUGHT THIS
JUST FOR YOU, KAORU.

219
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,458
( crying )

220
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,416
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
I'LL DRINK IT.

221
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,375
YOU'LL BE SATISFIED
ONCE I DO, RIGHT?

222
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,541
( sighs )

223
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,125
- YES!  THERE WE GO.

224
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,625
NOW THAT'S WHAT'S
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

225
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,333
ISN'T THIS STUFF THE BEST?

226
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,333
YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN?

227
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:56,166
SUZUKI, SATO,
YOU'RE UP NEXT.

228
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,791
- Suzuki and Sato:
YEAH, RIGHT!

229
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,166
- ( clock ticking )

230
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,666
( clock tolls )

231
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,083
- Aoi: TO THINK THAT HE
HAS NOT RETURNED

232
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,416
WHEN IT IS SO LATE.

233
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,708
PERHAPS SOMETHING AWFUL
HAS HAPPENED TO HIM.

234
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:24,208
- SIR KAORU HAS HIS GROUP OF
ACQUAINTANCES TO SOCIALIZE WITH.

235
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,750
COME, IT IS BEST THAT WE BEGIN
EATING SUPPER WITHOUT HIM.

236
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,041
- BUT STILL...

237
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,208
KAORU-SAMA.

238
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,666
- ( clock tolls )

239
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,958
- ( moans )

240
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,666
OH, I MUST HAVE
FALLEN ASLEEP LAST NIGHT.

241
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,125
- ( knocks on door )

242
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:00,250
- KAORU-SAMA? 
I'M COMING IN.

243
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,916
OH?

244
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,916
- ( door closes )

245
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:06,916
- ( sighs )

246
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,166
KAORU-SAMA?

247
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,833
KAORU-SAMA?

248
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:14,416
- ( groans )
AOI-CHAN, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

249
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,208
- OH, THANK GOODNESS.

250
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:19,541
WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED
TO YOU LAST NIGHT?

251
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,458
YOU DIDN'T EVEN CALL.

252
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,875
I WAS VERY WORRIED ABOUT YOU,
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW.

253
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,875
- LAST NIGHT?

254
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,375
- OH?

255
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,208
- HMM?

256
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,208
IS SOMETHING WRONG,
AOI-CHAN?

257
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,541
- ( moans )

258
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:36,875
- HUH?

259
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,166
- GOOD MORNING, KAORU.

260
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,750
- OH!

261
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,583
- ( yawns )

262
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:43,791
- T-TINA?

263
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,208
WHAT IN THE WORLD?

264
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,500
- MMM.

265
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,750
- UH-UH-UH.

266
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,166
WHO IS THIS PERSON?

267
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,500
- HMM?

268
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,291
HEY, KAORU, WHO'S THAT
CUTE GIRL, HUH?

269
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,083
- I-- I AM HIS--

270
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,666
THAT IS, I'M KAORU-SAMA'S--
- Miyabi: LANDLORD.

271
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,333
- MISS MIYABI.
- LANDLORD?

272
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:05,166
- YES.  THIS IS THE ESTATE'S
LANDLORD, AOI SAKURABA.

273
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,541
AND I AM MIYABI KAGURAZAKI,
THE MANAGER.

274
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:12,541
YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM
CANNOT BE REVEALED, REMEMBER?

275
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,541
THIS IS TO AVOID A SCANDAL
WITHIN THE FAMILY.

276
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,791
- YES.
I'M THE LANDLORD.

277
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,291
- UH, AOI-CHAN.

278
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,666
- OH, SO YOU'RE
THIS PLACE'S LANDLORD, HUH?

279
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,833
- I'M TINA FOSTER.

280
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,583
NICE TO MEET YOU.

281
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,291
( giggles )
- ( yelps )

282
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,958
- WHAT IN THE WORLD
ARE YOU DOING?

283
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,833
- JUST SAYING HELLO,
THAT'S ALL.

284
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,375
YOUR TURN, MISS MANAGER.

285
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,750
( giggles )

286
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,541
AW, CHEAPSKATE.

287
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,750
- IT WAS MISS TINA,
WASN'T IT?

288
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,416
IT APPEARS YOU ARE ONE OF
SIR KAORU'S SCHOOLMATES, 

289
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,875
AND ALSO THAT YOU TWO
WERE TOGETHER LAST NIGHT.

290
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,291
- ( sighs )
- LAST NIGHT?

291
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,416
YEAH, WE WERE TOGETHER
FOR THE WHOLE NIGHT!

292
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,208
- ( gasps )

293
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,208
- TINA!
- IF YOU PLEASE!

294
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,375
I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR
THE STORY IN DETAIL.

295
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,208
- SURE.
US PHOTO CLUB GUYS

296
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,708
WERE DRINKING LAST NIGHT.

297
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:57,708
- AND IT WAS ALL OF US
TOGETHER--

298
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,041
- SILENCE!

299
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,375
- ( stammers )
OKAY.

300
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,875
- CONTINUE.

301
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:05,208
- AND KAORU WAS OUT COLD
AFTER DRINKING TOO MUCH BOOZE.

302
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,250
MAN, YOU WERE SUCH A WUSS.
RIGHT, KAORU?

303
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,083
- IT WAS ALL BECAUSE OF
THAT MYSTERY BOOZE!

304
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,208
- Tina: SO NOTHING WOULD
WAKE THE BUM UP.

305
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,416
WE BARELY GOT THIS 
ADDRESS OUT OF HIM,

306
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,500
AND I WAS NICE ENOUGH
TO BRING HIM HERE.

307
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,833
BUT WHEN I DUMPED HIM
ONTO THE FLOOR,

308
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,208
I STARTED FEELING
THE BOOZE GET TO ME.

309
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,750
SO I GRABBED
THE NEAREST FUTON

310
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,416
AND SLEPT LIKE A LOG.

311
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,208
- OH.
- I SEE.

312
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,875
NOW I KNOW THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

313
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,875
I SUPPOSE THAT NOTHING
COULD HAVE BEEN DONE

314
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,541
TO PREVENT THIS SITUATION.

315
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:35,333
HOWEVER, SUCH INCIDENCES
MUST NOT EVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

316
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,000
IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?

317
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,625
- YEAH.  I'M SORRY.

318
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,541
- Tina: HEY,
THE NEXT ROOM IS FREE!

319
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:43,750
COOL.

320
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,541
- All: HUH?
- MISS LANDLORD?

321
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,250
MISS MANAGER?
I JUST GOT BACK,

322
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,833
SO I DON'T HAVE 
A PLACE TO STAY.

323
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,916
I'M GONNA LIVE HERE
STARTING TODAY.

324
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,541
- ( gasps )
- Both: HUH?

325
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,541
- CAN'T WE ALL GET ALONG,
MISS LANDLORD?

326
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,291
- NO, NOT AGAIN.

327
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,666
- WE ARE NOT CURRENTLY
LOOKING FOR ANY NEW TENANTS,

328
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,041
UNFORTUNATELY.

329
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:03,208
- AW, DON'T PLAY HARD TO GET
WITH ME, MISS MANAGER.

330
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,041
- WHEN I SAY NO,
I MEAN NO.

331
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,500
- I GUESS I OUGHT 
TO GET GOING THEN.

332
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,791
I'VE GOT NO CHOICE
BUT TO GIVE UP LIVING HERE.

333
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:14,000
- SIR KAORU.
- UH, YEAH?

334
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,750
- THERE IS NOTHING WRONG
WITH SPENDING TIME

335
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,166
WITH YOUR SCHOOLMATES,

336
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,375
BUT I WOULD BE TROUBLED 
IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND

337
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,791
LADY AOI'S FEELINGS.

338
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,458
SHE WAS PATIENTLY AWAITING

339
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,291
YOUR RETURN FOR SUPPER,
SIR KAORU,

340
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,625
AND AS SUCH HAS NOT
EATEN SINCE LAST NIGHT.

341
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:27,625
- ( gasps )

342
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:35,000
- ( door opens )
- AOI-CHAN.

343
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,541
- KAORU-SAMA?

344
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,791
- SORRY.

345
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,208
- PLEASE DO NOT APOLOGIZE.

346
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,833
I AM CERTAIN YOU
WOULD NEVER DO SOMETHING

347
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,083
THAT YOU WOULD BE ASHAMED OF.

348
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,000
I BELIEVE IN YOU,
KAORU-SAMA.

349
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,208
- THANKS, AOI-CHAN.

350
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,875
STILL, I'M SORRY.

351
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,166
- Tina: KAORU!
- HUH?

352
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,541
TINA, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING THERE?

353
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:56,708
- HEY, DON'T WORRY.

354
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,041
I TRAVELED
ALL AROUND THE WORLD,

355
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,791
SO I'M USED TO
THIS KIND OF STUFF.

356
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,541
- THAT ISN'T THE PROBLEM.

357
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,416
- BUT I DON'T HAVE
ANYWHERE ELSE TO GO.

358
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,208
THE FISH IS JUST ABOUT DONE.

359
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,375
SO DO YOU WHAT TO HAVE 
SOME BREAKFAST WITH ME?

360
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,041
- WELL, I AM PRETTY HUNGRY.

361
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,583
UH--

362
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,541
NO.
I HAVE TO BE FIRM.

363
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:13,833
TINA, WE NEED TO TALK.

364
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,708
- SURE.
SO, WHAT IS IT, KAORU?

365
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,833
- TINA, I KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE
A PLACE TO LIVE, BUT SAYING

366
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,750
THAT YOU'RE GONNA LIVE--
- ( meows )

367
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,916
( meows )

368
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,291
- HELLO.
WHO ARE YOU, KITTY?

369
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,833
- TINA, WAIT.
LISTEN TO ME.

370
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,375
- WHERE DID YOU COME FROM?

371
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,541
ARE YOU ONE OF
THE TENANTS HERE, KITTY?

372
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,208
THEN I GUESS I'LL BE ABLE
TO SEE YOU EVERY DAY.

373
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,416
- HEY, I'M NOT DONE
TALKING HERE!

374
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,875
- Tina: AW, KITTY.
( giggles )

375
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,583
AWW.

376
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,125
- ( chuckles )

377
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,541
- TINA!

378
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,541
- WHAT IS IT, KAORU?

379
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,375
DON'T LECTURE ME
SO MUCH, OKAY?

380
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,083
- WOULD YOU CUT THAT OUT,
TINA?

381
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,375
- Tina: DON'T BE SO SHY.

382
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,208
- STOP IT ALREADY,
ALL RIGHT?

383
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:54,416
- THERE THERE THERE.
AWW.

384
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,500
- ( gasps )

385
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:56,708
- ( clears throat )

386
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,833
- UH, MISS MIYABI?

387
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,166
- WELL, YOU'RE ENJOYING
YOURSELVES.

388
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,750
- THIS ISN'T WHAT
YOU THINK IT IS. 

389
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:03,875
COME ON, LET GO.

390
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,083
- THEN WHAT, PRAY TELL,
IS GOING ON?

391
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,625
- WELL, TINA WAS COOKING FISH,

392
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,208
AND THEN THE CAT CAME OUT,

393
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,708
AND WE WOUND UP LIKE THIS.

394
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,083
- I UNDERSTAND.

395
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,375
YOU NEEDN'T TROUBLE
YOURSELF WITH THIS.

396
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,833
I WILL DO IT.
JUST STEP ASIDE.

397
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,083
( screams )

398
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:21,500
- WOW!  YOU GOT BIG BOOBIES TOO,
MISS MANAGER.

399
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,583
- MISS TINA!
- SORRY, SORRY.

400
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,708
- I SWEAR.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

401
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:26,916
( gasps )

402
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,500
- WOW, AND THEY FEEL
BIG FROM THE FRONT TOO.

403
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,333
HUH?
- ( groans )

404
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,250
- ( chuckles )
- ( shouts )

405
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,583
I WILL NOT!
- IT'S NOT LIKE THEY GOT SMALLER

406
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:37,916
OR ANYTHING.

407
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,500
- AND WOULD YOU TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY IF THEY DID?

408
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,208
- I SAID I WAS SORRY,
MISS MANAGER!

409
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,583
- ( both sigh )
- COME BACK HERE!

410
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,541
- SO IN HONOR OF ME.
TINA FOSTER,

411
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,083
STARTING A NEW LIFE,

412
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,333
CHEERS!

413
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,875
( gulps )

414
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,416
AHH!

415
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,708
THAT'S GOOD.

416
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,833
- IT IS RATHER LATE
ALREADY,

417
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,375
SO I ASK THAT YOU LEAVE
FIRST THING TOMORROW MORNING.

418
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,875
- LET'S FORGET THAT FOR NOW.

419
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,000
COME ON,
TAKE A NICE LONG CHUG.

420
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:09,375
- I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO HAVE SOME.

421
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,500
- WHOA. YOU CAN REALLY PUT
THAT STUFF AWAY, MISS MANAGER.

422
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,583
THEN LET ME BRING OUT
MY SECRET STASH.

423
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,916
- YOU STILL HAVE MORE
OF THAT STUFF, TINA? 

424
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,583
- Tina: COME ON,
HAVE A DRINK.

425
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,083
- MISS MIYABI, YOU REALLY
SHOULDN'T DRINK THAT STUFF.

426
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,375
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

427
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,041
I WILL BE
PERFECTLY FINE.

428
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:28,125
I AM NO STRANGER WHEN IT COMES
TO DRINKING HARD LIQUOR.

429
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,833
- ( thuds )
- ( Tina laughs )

430
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,000
- SEE?  I TOLD YOU SO.

431
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,291
- ( Tina laughs )

432
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,583
- HEY, MISS LANDLORD,

433
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,416
YOU WANT TO HEAR SOME
INTERESTING STORIES ABOUT KAORU?

434
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,583
- HUH?

435
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,916
- TINA, DON'T YOU DARE
SAY ANOTHER WORD.

436
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,625
- WE WERE CAMPING
IN THE SUMMER.

437
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,875
KAORU WAS DEAD DRUNK
BACK THEN,

438
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,666
AND WHEN I GOT HIM
SOME WATER TO DRINK,

439
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,625
HE SAID THAT HE WANTED IT
MOUTH TO MOUTH.

440
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:54,708
- ( gasps )

441
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,333
- HEY, QUIT CHANGING THE STORY.

442
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,416
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED WAS YOU

443
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,125
POURED A WHOLE BUCKET
OF WATER ON ME

444
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,541
IN MY SLEEP.

445
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,916
- OH, SO YOU REMEMBERED.

446
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,083
I GUESS IT DIDN'T WORK.

447
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,208
- OH, THAT WAS A LIE
JUST NOW?

448
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,875
- OF COURSE IT WAS,
AOI-CHAN.

449
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,625
- IS THAT SO?
- OH, I REMEMBER ANOTHER STORY.

450
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,708
- DURING OUR WINTER
CAMPING TRIP,

451
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,416
I GOT IN AN OPEN AIR
BATH WITH KAORU.

452
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,875
AND HE GOT A CHANCE TO SEE
EVERY INCH OF MY NAKED BODY.

453
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,083
- EXCEPT IT WAS
A HEATED SWIMMING POOL,

454
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,375
YOU HAD A BATHING SUIT,

455
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,708
AND SATO AND SUZUKI
WERE THERE.

456
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,958
- GIRLS FROM KYUSHU
CAN NEVER GET MARRIED

457
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,833
IF SOMEONE SEES US NAKED.

458
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,958
- AND I'M TELLING YOU,
I NEVER SAW A THING.

459
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,750
AND ANYWAY, FIRST OF ALL,
YOU'RE AN AMERICAN.

460
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,000
- OH, I REMEMBER
DURING THE AUTUMN TRIP.

461
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,541
- ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

462
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,541
- WE ALMOST GOT STRANDED.
- I SAID ENOUGH!

463
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,333
- YOU WERE WHINING ABOUT
HOW WE WERE GONNA DIE,

464
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,208
AND IT WAS LIKE
SO ANNOYING.

465
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:45,166
- WHEN IN THE WORLD
DID THAT EVER HAPPEN?

466
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,166
- ( thuds )

467
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,750
- ( door opens )

468
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,875
- ( sighs )

469
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,583
OH?

470
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,416
KAORU-SAMA?

471
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,750
- AOI-CHAN,
YOU ALL RIGHT?

472
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,750
- I-- I THINK SO.

473
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,041
- YOU SURPRISED US,

474
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,458
DRINKING SO MUCH
THAT YOU PASSED OUT.

475
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,833
- OH.  I APOLOGIZE.

476
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,541
- WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO BRING YOU SOME WATER?

477
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,208
- NO.  I'M FINE.

478
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,916
UM, WHAT ABOUT
MISS MIYABI AND MISS TINA?

479
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,583
- OH, THEY'RE STILL BACK THERE.

480
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:22,916
- HEY, HEY!

481
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,416
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
MISS MANAGER?

482
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,833
IT'S OKAY FOR ME
TO LIVE HERE, RIGHT?

483
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,708
- MM-HMM.
( sighs )

484
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,125
- ALL RIGHT.

485
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,375
- MISS TINA...
- HUH?

486
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,291
- MISS TINA...

487
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:41,041
IS FAMILIAR WITH MANY
DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF YOU

488
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,750
THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF.

489
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,208
- IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

490
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,875
- I APOLOGIZE,

491
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,166
BUT ITS JUST THAT...

492
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,875
I WANT TO KNOW MORE
ABOUT YOU THAN ANYONE.

493
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,541
MUCH MUCH MORE.

494
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:56,083
BECAUSE I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE YOUR LANDLORD.

495
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,291
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
YOUR FIANCEE.

496
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,291
- AOI-CHAN.

497
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,041
LET'S MAKE MEMORIES.

498
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,250
- HUH?

499
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,208
- WE'LL MAKE LOTS
OF MEMORIES TO SHARE,

500
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,875
STARTING RIGHT NOW.

501
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,041
- KAORU-SAMA?

502
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,875
- RIGHT?
WE WILL, AOI-CHAN.

503
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,583
- YES.

504
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,833
- Tina: KAORU!
- Both: HUH?

505
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,375
- KAORU,
WHERE'D YOU GO?

506
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,041
LET'S DRINK SOME MORE!

507
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:32,166
KAORU, MISS LANDLORD?

508
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,750
I'M GETTING LONELY HERE
BY MYSELF.

509
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:35,875
- ( both chuckle )

510
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,708
- WE'VE GOTTEN INTO
A BIG MESS.

511
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:40,125
- BUT IT SEEMS LIKE
IT WILL BE A LOT OF FUN.

512
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,500
- ( both laugh )

513
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:43,875
- ( groans )

514
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,500
( howls )

515
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,166
- ( theme music playing )

516
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,416
- ( singing in Japanese )

517
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:24,750
- Taeko: OH, MISS AOI,

518
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,875
THAT MAID UNIFORM 
THAT YOU GAVE ME--

519
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:28,291
- Aoi: WHAT IS THE MATTER?

520
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:29,291
- Taeko: I'M HEARING
SOUNDS OF DOOM FROM 

521
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:30,750
AROUND MY BUST.

522
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:33,375
- Aoi: AI YORI AOSHI,
"FAMILY TRADITION."

523
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:35,208
MISS TAEKO,
DO YOU LIKE MILK?

524
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:36,458
- Taeko: YES.
