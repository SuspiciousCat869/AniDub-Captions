1
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,916
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,500
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,250
- ( waves crashing )

4
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,750
- HANABISHI-SENPAI IS KIND

5
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,791
AND EASY TO TALK TO.

6
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,458
AND HE'S ALWAYS
HELPING ME OUT TOO.

7
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,958
I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT BEFORE.

8
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,625
BUT HE IS IMPORTANT TO ME.

9
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:34,375
MAYBE THESE FEELINGS
THAT I HAVE FOR HIM...

10
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,333
REALLY ARE...

11
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,625
- ( chatter, laughter )

12
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,500
- ENJOY THE BEACH.

13
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,291
- AAH!  THE FOOD'S 
BURNING BEHIND YOU!

14
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,958
- AAH!
OH, MY GOSH.

15
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,125
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOT
PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS?

16
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,416
WAKE UP ALREADY!

17
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,583
- I'M SORRY.

18
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:13,916
- ( groans )

19
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,916
- Chika and Taeko: AAH!
- WA...

20
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,375
WATER.

21
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,708
- ( ringing )

22
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,666
- ( gulping loudly )

23
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,250
( exhales )

24
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,750
I FINALLY FEEL ALIVE.

25
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,000
- WOW.
IT'S ALL GONE?

26
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,375
EVERY LAST BAR OF ICE CREAM?

27
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:33,250
- MM-HMM, WE SOLD OUT
IN 20 MINUTES.  YEAH!

28
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,958
- THAT'S CERTAINLY GOOD
FOR BUSINESS.

29
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,208
YEAH!

30
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,416
- I FAIL TO SEE WHAT
YOU'RE SO HAPPY ABOUT.

31
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,208
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA
SHRIVEL UP INTO A MUMMY.

32
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,166
THE HEAT WAS
SIMPLY UNBEARABLE.

33
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,833
AND WHY DO I HAVE TO SELL ICE
CREAM IN THE FIRST PLACE?

34
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,333
I DIDN'T COME
ALL THE WAY TO THIS

35
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,583
GOD-FORSAKEN PEASANT BEACH
JUST TO DO SOMETHING SO MENIAL.

36
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:52,750
I CAME WITH THE INTENTION

37
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,750
OF SHARING A MEMORABLE
SUMMER ADVENTURE

38
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,416
WITH HANABISHI-SAMA.

39
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,666
UH?

40
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,750
- THANKS FOR THE HELP
OUT THERE, MISS MAYU.

41
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,083
HERE'S A REWARD.
- THIS IS A REWARD?

42
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,416
- WHEN WE'RE DONE WITH THESE,

43
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,583
WE'LL GO OUT FOR
OUR SECOND PASS.

44
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,791
- WHAT?!  YOU MEAN
WE'RE GOING OUT AGAIN?

45
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:07,958
- CHEERS!

46
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,333
AHH!

47
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,750
MAN, THAT'S GOOD STUFF.

48
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,250
- YOU CAN REALLY 
PUT IT AWAY, HUH?

49
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,500
YOU'RE A YOUNG LADY
OF MANY TALENTS, AREN'T YOU?

50
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,500
- YOU'RE NOT SO BAD YOURSELF,
MISTER.

51
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,208
- THANKS.
ONE MORE ROUND THEN!

52
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,833
- YOU GOT IT!
TWO MEDIUM BOTTLES, KAORU!

53
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,750
HIMEJI AND EDAMAME TOO.

54
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,250
- TINA, DIDN'T YOU SAY
YOU WERE GOING TO HELP OUT

55
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,333
WITH THE RESTAURANT?

56
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,750
- I'M EATING AND DRINKING,
AREN'T I?

57
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,583
AND THAT HELPS OUT
THE BUSINESS AROUND HERE.

58
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,583
AIN'T THAT RIGHT, MISTER?
- SURE IS.

59
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,166
- ( both laugh )

60
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,166
- FIGURES, I GUESS.

61
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,291
- OHH!

62
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,125
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT THERE?

63
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,583
- I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

64
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:42,666
- IT'S OKAY.

65
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,500
I TRIPPED OVER
THIS THING EARLIER TOO.

66
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,416
YOU SHOULD WATCH YOUR STEP
AROUND HERE.

67
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,458
- I WILL.

68
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,125
- HURRY UP
WITH THE DRINKS, KAORU!

69
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:52,250
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
- ( laughing )

70
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,333
- ( sighs )

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,875
- TAEKO.

72
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:01,708
ALL RIGHT, THEN!
THIS LOOKS LIKE A JOB FOR CHIKA!

73
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,041
- YES.  AND PLEASE
FORWARD THAT ORDER

74
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,833
TO THE MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT.

75
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:12,916
THANK YOU.

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,375
- I CAN'T EVEN MOVE
AN INCH ANYMORE.

77
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,125
- I CAN'T...
DRINK ANOTHER DROP.

78
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,333
- BIG BROTHER!
- HMM?  CHIKA-CHAN.

79
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,791
- ( giggles )

80
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,083
I THINK YOU'VE DONE
ENOUGH WORK FOR TODAY.

81
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,083
- OH, YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD
AT THIS FOR SOMEONE SO YOUNG.

82
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,250
- THANK YOU, MA'AM.
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED COOKING,

83
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,541
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

84
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,416
- ANY MAN WOULD BE LUCKY
TO HAVE YOU AS HIS WIFE.

85
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,416
- OH.

86
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,750
OH, MY.

87
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,625
I'M SO EMBARRASSED
TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

88
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,250
OH, MY GOODNESS.

89
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,375
- ( laughter )
- HEY, TAEKO.

90
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:55,875
WHY DON'T YOU GO
TAKE A BATH?

91
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,041
I CAN TAKE OVER FROM HERE.

92
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,416
- OH, IT'S OKAY.
I'LL TAKE A BATH LATER.

93
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,750
- OH, NO, YOU GO AHEAD,
MISS TAEKO.

94
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,666
WE'RE PRACTICALLY DONE HERE
ANYWAY.

95
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,083
- BUT STILL--

96
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,666
- DO YOU REALLY THINK
BIG BROTHER LIKES SWEATY GIRLS?

97
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,708
- HUH?

98
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,750
- OH.

99
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,375
WHAT'S THIS?

100
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,291
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY'S
IN HERE ALREADY.

101
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,916
MAYBE IT'S TINA-SENPAI.

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,250
- ( giggles )
GO FOR IT, TAEKO.

103
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,083
JUST ONE LOOK AND HIS HEART
WILL BE YOURS FOREVER.

104
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,083
- TINA-SENPAI,
WOULD IT BE OKAY

105
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,875
IF I TAKE A SHOWER TOO?

106
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,041
HI.

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,958
SENPAI?

108
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,083
( gasps )

109
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,666
AAH!

110
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,166
( murmuring )

111
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,125
WHY IS HANABISHI-SENPAI HERE?

112
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:12,500
- WH-- WHY'S TAEKO-CHAN HERE?

113
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:13,958
WAIT!  MY BACK.

114
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,416
AAH!

115
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,375
- IT SOUNDS LIKE
OPERATION: CUPID OF LOVE

116
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,625
WAS A
COMPLETE SUCCESS!

117
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,750
- TIME TO TAKE A BATH!
- MAYU WILL BE FIRST!

118
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,208
- ( cheering )

119
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,208
- ( groans )
- ( water splashes )

120
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,416
- HUH?

121
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,916
- ( Tina and Mayu arguing )

122
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,791
- OH, NO, WHAT DO I DO NOW?

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,208
- ( exhales )

124
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,083
THIS IS PARADISE.

125
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,541
- ( water running )

126
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,500
- HUH?

127
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:43,166
I GUESS SOMEONE ELSE MUST
HAVE COME IN HERE BEFORE US.

128
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,000
IS THAT YOU, MISS MANAGER?
OR MISS LANDLORD?

129
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,666
- AAH, IT'S TINA.

130
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,166
- WHAT SHOULD I DO?

131
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,000
IF THEY FIND
HANABISHI-SENPAI HERE...

132
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,791
I HAVE TO THINK OF
SOMETHING QUICK, OR ELSE.

133
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,250
- HEY, COME OUT, COME OUT
WHEREVER YOU ARE!

134
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,208
- ( steam hissing )
- AAH!

135
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,083
- OH, SORRY ABOUT THAT,
TINA-SENPAI.

136
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,916
- HUH?  IS THAT YOU, TAE?

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,875
YOU SURPRISED ME.
SO WAS THAT YOU ALL ALONG?

138
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,750
- YEAH.  ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

139
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,250
- YEAH, I'M FINE.

140
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,625
BUT DON'T YOU THINK
THAT WATER'S A LITTLE TOO HOT?

141
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,625
- NO, NOT AT ALL.
I'M PERFECTLY FINE.

142
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,791
- OH, OKAY.

143
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,458
I GUESS YOU LIKE IT
PRETTY HOT.

144
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,250
I'LL BE IN THE BATH
IF YOU NEED ME FOR ANYTHING.

145
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,583
- ALL RIGHT!

146
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,625
- IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU FOOLED HER FOR NOW.

147
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,125
- YEAH.  FOR NOW.

148
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,708
- ( giggles bashfully )

149
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,375
- HEY, SENPAI?

150
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,500
- ( shakily )
YEAH?

151
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,666
- I'LL DISTRACT TINA-SENPAI

152
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,291
AND WHOEVER ELSE IS THERE,

153
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,208
SO WHEN I DO--
- OKAY.

154
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,458
I GOTCHA.

155
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:51,916
- ♪ THE THUNDER CLAPS!
THE DEMON ROARS! ♪

156
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,083
♪ NOW IS THE TIME FOR US
TO DEFEND... ♪

157
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,250
- THAT'S THE MOST SENSELESS SONG
I'VE EVER HEARD.

158
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,416
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS!

159
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,208
CAN'T YOU JUST ENJOY
A BATH QUIETLY?!

160
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:08,125
- SAY, TINA-SENPAI,
MISS MAYU...

161
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,291
- HMM?

162
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,250
- WHAT ARE YOU SO
NERVOUS ABOUT, TAEKO?

163
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,458
- TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
YOU SEE...

164
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,916
MM...

165
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,833
GO FOR IT, TAEKO.

166
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,500
LOOK, THERE'S A SQUID OVER THERE
THAT'S 20 YARDS LONG!

167
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,500
WAIT, THAT'S TOO FAR-FETCHED.

168
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,166
STUPID STUPID.

169
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,416
THAT'LL NEVER GET THEM
LOOKING THE OTHER WAY.

170
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,583
- WHERE?!  WHERE?!

171
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,250
- 20 YARDS LONG--
THAT'S A LOT!

172
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,625
- THEY ACTUALLY FELL FOR IT.

173
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,291
- OH, LOOK AT THAT OVER THERE.

174
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,750
I THINK IT'S THAT OVER THERE!

175
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,416
- WHERE IS IT?!
- I THINK IT'S...

176
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,291
- ( overlapping shouting )

177
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,291
- ( grunts )

178
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,750
- THERE!
- ( water splashes )

179
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,583
- WHAT WAS THAT SOUND
JUST NOW?

180
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,500
- YEAH, WHAT WAS IT?
- UM, IT WAS--

181
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:49,625
WELL...

182
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,333
SORRY FOR STARTLING YOU.

183
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,166
IT WAS JUST ME
SPLASHING THE WATER.

184
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,666
( laughs nervously )

185
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,750
OHH!

186
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,208
- ( burbling )

187
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,708
- IS IT ME, OR DID THAT
BUCKET JUST MOVE?

188
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,208
- WHAT?!
YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN!

189
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,666
- ( exhales )

190
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,833
- SUSPICIOUS, HUH?
- IT CERTAINLY IS.

191
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,333
- I DON'T THINK
IT'S SUSPICIOUS IN THE LEAST.

192
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,166
OH, NO, IT'S ALL OVER.

193
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,458
- TAEKO!

194
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:15,958
- ( all scream )

195
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,375
- AHH.
- CHIKA-CHAN!

196
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,958
( giggles )
DO YOU MIND IF I JOIN IN?

197
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,125
- NATURALLY I'M SURE 
THAT NONE OF US MIND.

198
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,458
- WELL, I SURE DON'T.

199
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,833
WHEN IT COMES TO
THE HOT SPRINGS,

200
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,583
THE MORE THE MERRIER,
I ALWAYS SAY.

201
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,250
- MM!  HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

202
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,833
SINCE WE'RE ALL HERE,
LET'S SCRUB EACH OTHER'S BACKS.

203
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,500
- YEAH!
THAT SOUNDS KINDA FUN.

204
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,375
WE'VE NEVER DONE THINGS
LIKE THAT BEFORE.

205
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,125
DON'T YOU TWO THINK
IT'LL BE FUN?

206
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,458
- REALLY?
WASH EACH OTHER'S BACKS?

207
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,666
- WHY NOT?
I'M UP FOR THAT, CHIKA.

208
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,416
- ALL RIGHT!
LET'S DO IT THEN!

209
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,916
- WELL, THE FIRST ORDER
OF BUSINESS IS TO WARM UP.

210
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,250
- YEAH.  YOU'RE RIGHT.

211
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,750
- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE, CHIKA!

212
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,416
IF YOU WANNA SOAK
IN THE HOT SPRINGS,

213
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,208
THEN THE TOWEL'S GONNA
HAVE TO GO.

214
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,666
THAT'S THE ONLY PROBLEM
THERE IS!

215
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,791
- AAH, CHIKA-CHAN.

216
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:08,083
- IS SOMETHING WRONG, CHIKA?

217
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,083
- AH...

218
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,125
( exhales )

219
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,375
- ( chuckles nervously )

220
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,833
- ( whimpering )

221
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,666
( crying loudly )

222
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,250
STUPID STUPID STUPID
STUPID STUPID STUPID

223
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,708
STUPID STUPID STUPID
STUPID STUPID!

224
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,666
- ( girls screaming )

225
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,958
- ( panting )

226
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,958
I'M SAFE AT LAST.

227
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,916
- ( bell dinging )

228
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,916
- All:
THANK YOU FOR THE MEAL.

229
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,625
- ( humming a tune )

230
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,666
JUST LEAVE THE DISHES
OVER THERE AND I'LL GET TO THEM.

231
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:07,833
- HEY, CHIKA-CHAN.

232
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,041
THANKS A LOT FOR
WHAT YOU DID EARLIER.

233
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,625
- WOW, THIS DISHWASHING
LIQUID DOES A GREAT JOB

234
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:16,791
OF CUTTING THROUGH THE GREASE.

235
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,875
IT'S TOTALLY AMAZING!

236
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,500
- I THINK I'LL BE ABLE
TO HANDLE THE REST.

237
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,583
SO WHY DON'T YOU AND MISS AOI
TAKE A BATH, MISS MIYABI?

238
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,750
- THANK YOU.
- HOWEVER-- 

239
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,125
- IT'S FINE--

240
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,000
THE TWO OF THEM WILL BE ALL
RIGHT IN A LITTLE BIT.

241
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,000
THEY JUST GOT OVERCOOKED
IN THE HOT SPRINGS,

242
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,083
SO LET 'EM COOL DOWN.

243
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,250
- ( both groaning )

244
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,625
- SO HOT.

245
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,375
- THEN WE'LL BE GOING NOW.

246
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,041
- ENJOY YOUR BATH.

247
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,041
- IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
I SHOULD TAKE TO THE KITCHEN?

248
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,000
- NO, I'LL HANDLE
 THE REST MYSELF.

249
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,250
WHY DON'T YOU GO REST?

250
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,750
OH, ALMOST FORGOT.
- HMM?

251
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,250
- ACTUALLY, I DO HAVE
A LITTLE ERRAND

252
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,916
I'D LIKE YOU TO DO
WITH TAEKO LATER ON TONIGHT.

253
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,916
- SURE.

254
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,916
SO YOUR FAMILY
ALSO HAS A BOOTH?

255
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,458
- YES, WE ONLY HAVE IT OPEN
ON THE WEEKENDS,

256
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,416
BUT IT'S A FRIED NOODLE STAND.

257
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,750
- AND CHIKA-CHAN'S
THE ONE WHO COOKS?

258
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,583
- SHE SURE DOES.
IT'S REALLY GOOD TOO.

259
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,708
- ( waves crashing )

260
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,250
- I REALLY ENVY YOU.

261
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:33,833
I WISH I HAD A FAMILY OUT
IN THE COUNTRYSIDE LIKE THIS.

262
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,791
- MM.  YOU KNOW,

263
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,291
I'VE WANTED TO TELL YOU...

264
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,500
THAT I'M SORRY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED EARLIER.

265
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,333
- HUH?  OH, YEAH!
I'M SORRY TOO.

266
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,625
WE'D BETTER GET GOING.

267
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,625
- YEAH.

268
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,916
- THANK YOU.

269
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,500
HMM?  WHAT IS IT?

270
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,791
- THAT'S REALLY AMAZING.

271
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,208
- HUH?  WHAT'S AMAZING?

272
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,833
- YOU CARRYING THAT GAS TANK.

273
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,125
WHEN IT WAS CHIKA-CHAN AND ME,

274
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,625
IT TOOK TWO OF US TO CARRY IT,

275
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,250
AND WE STILL WOBBLED
BACK AND FORTH.

276
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,750
- I SEE.

277
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,041
- I GUESS THIS COULD BE A LITTLE
BIT TOO HEAVY FOR A GIRL.

278
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,000
- AND THAT'S THE REASON
I SAID YOU WERE AMAZING, SENPAI.

279
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,333
- WELL, I AM A GUY, AFTER ALL.

280
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,291
- ( chuckles )

281
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,458
- ( chattering )

282
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,291
- HEY!

283
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,958
I'M RIGHT OVER HERE.

284
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,958
( giggles )

285
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,916
- ( sizzling )

286
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,291
- WOW, YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD
AT THIS, CHIKA-CHAN.

287
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,458
- AREN'T I, THOUGH?

288
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,791
HERE YOU GO.
GIVE IT A TASTE.

289
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,250
- ARE YOU SURE?

290
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,208
WOW, DELICIOUS.

291
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,625
- IT IS, ISN'T IT?

292
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,583
COME ON,
TRY SOME OF IT, TAEKO.

293
00:14:58,666 --> 00:14:59,666
- BUT I'M NOT HUNGRY.
- JUST TRY IT.

294
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,458
- HERE.
- ( gasps )

295
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,541
- Chika: WELL,
THE STAND'S ALL READY

296
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:11,875
AND WE STILL HAVE
SOME TIME LEFT,

297
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,083
SO YOU TWO OUGHTA GO
LOOK AROUND A BIT.

298
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,750
- Taeko: OH, BUT--
- Chika: IT'S ALL RIGHT.

299
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,458
GO ON, GO ON.

300
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,083
- WHAT SHOULD I DO?

301
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,083
THIS FEELS...

302
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,250
KIND OF LIKE A DATE.

303
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:40,916
- TAEKO-CHAN.

304
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
- YES?!

305
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,333
- WANNA PLAY A GAME?
- HUH?

306
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:44,291
OH.

307
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,666
- SHOOT!
ALMOST HAD IT.

308
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,666
JUST A LITTLE HIGHER
WOULD HAVE DONE IT.

309
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,875
OKAY, IT'S YOUR TURN,
TAEKO-CHAN.

310
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,250
- ALL RIGHT.

311
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,916
( exhales )

312
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,416
I CAN'T DO THIS.

313
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,666
I FEEL WAY TOO NERVOUS TO.

314
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,666
MY HANDS WON'T LISTEN
TO WHAT I SAY.

315
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,625
I'LL JUST MESS UP.

316
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,041
OHH.

317
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,916
I HAVE TO ACT NATURAL.

318
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,958
HA!

319
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,125
AAH!

320
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,166
I'M SORRY, SENPAI.

321
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,583
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

322
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,541
- ( chuckles )
I'M FINE.

323
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,875
- WHY?  WHY AM I LIKE THIS?

324
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,333
THE MORE I TRY 
TO ACT NATURAL,

325
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,000
THE MORE MY BODY
REFUSES TO COOPERATE.

326
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,708
JUST THINKING THAT
I'M ALONE HERE WITH HIM...

327
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,375
OHH...

328
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,166
I'M THE WORST!

329
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,541
IT'S ALL OVER.

330
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,458
HE MUST REALLY HATE ME NOW.

331
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:52,791
- TAEKO-CHAN.

332
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,291
- UM, SENPAI?

333
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:58,416
- YOU KNOW, SPENDING TIME
WITH YOU IS A LOT OF THINGS,

334
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,416
BUT IT SURE ISN'T BORING,
AT LEAST.

335
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,125
- ( slightly gasps )
OH.

336
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:09,333
YOU-- YOU MEAN
YOU'RE NOT MAD AT ME AT ALL?

337
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,500
- HUH?  WHY WOULD I BE?

338
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,833
- BECAUSE MY CLUMSINESS MUST
HAVE REALLY BEEN

339
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,000
A NUISANCE FOR YOU.

340
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,791
- HEY, THAT ISN'T TRUE AT ALL.

341
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,125
I HAD A LOT OF FUN TODAY.

342
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,125
- WHAT?

343
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,291
- BESIDES...

344
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,375
NO MATTER WHAT TROUBLE
COMES YOUR WAY,

345
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,833
YOU ALWAYS TRY YOUR BEST
TO HAVE A POSITIVE OUTLOOK.

346
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,500
YOU KNOW, IT'S THAT,
TAEKO-CHAN,

347
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,000
THAT I LIKE THE BEST.

348
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,000
- OH, SENPAI.

349
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,208
SENPAI.

350
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,875
SENPAI, I, UH--

351
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:45,833
THERE IS SOMETHING--

352
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,583
THERE'S SOMETHING...

353
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:49,916
THAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

354
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,291
- HEY, TAEKO-CHAN.

355
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,791
- YEAH.  YES, SENPAI?

356
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,458
- BEAUTIFUL.

357
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,458
COME ON,
DIDN'T YOU SEE THEM?!

358
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,458
THOSE WERE
BEAUTIFUL FIREWORKS.

359
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,166
- ( sighs )

360
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,000
HE-- HE DIDN'T HEAR
A SINGLE WORD I SAID.

361
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,000
ALL RIGHT, ONE MORE TIME.

362
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,291
SENPAI, I--

363
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,291
- ( fireworks cracking )
- OH.

364
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,916
- OH, SORRY.
ALL RIGHT.

365
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,583
WHAT WERE WE
TALKING ABOUT AGAIN?

366
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,916
- UH-- NOTHING.

367
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,500
NEVER MIND.
- ARE YOU SURE?

368
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,791
- I'M SURE CHIKA-CHAN
MUST BE TIRED OF WAITING FOR US.

369
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,125
WE'D BETTER HURRY BACK.

370
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,583
- HEY, SLOW DOWN THERE.

371
00:18:58,666 --> 00:18:59,791
- ( chuckles )
COME ON!

372
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,750
HURRY UP, SENPAI!

373
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,875
- All: THANK YOU FOR
TAKING SUCH GOOD CARE OF US.

374
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,791
- BUT YOU CAME HERE 
TO ENJOY YOURSELVES,

375
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,958
AND I MADE YOU WORK.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

376
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,916
- PLEASE, MA'AM,
WE ENJOYED OURSELVES.

377
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,250
- WE'LL COME VISIT YOU
REAL SOON, 'KAY, GRANDMA?

378
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,416
- OH, I'LL BE WAITING
FOR YOU ALL.

379
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,041
- DON'T CRY, GRANDMA.

380
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,541
- I'M NOT CRYING.

381
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,541
- YOU'RE SO MEAN!
- ( laughter )

382
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:32,125
- Chika:
SO HOW DID IT GO, TAEKO?

383
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,750
YOU AND BIG BROTHER SEEM
TO BE GETTING ALONG REALLY WELL.

384
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,291
SO, DID YOU ASK HIM OUT?

385
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:40,250
OH, BUT I GUESS THAT'S PROBABLY
ASKING TOO MUCH OF YOU, HUH?

386
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,708
- ( giggles )
- HEY!  WHY'D YOU LAUGH?

387
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,291
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

388
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,250
- IT'S A... SECRET.
- HEY, NO FAIR!

389
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,750
I'VE JUST GOTTA KNOW.

390
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,958
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT
I'M THE CUPID OF LOVE?

391
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,291
- MM.  WELL, YOU SEE...

392
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:57,291
AFTER BEING WITH HIM TODAY,
I'VE DISCOVERED SOMETHING--

393
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,291
I FOUND OUT THAT
I'D ONLY TROUBLE HIM

394
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,333
IF I STAYED THE SAME WAY
I AM NOW.

395
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:07,750
I HAVE TO TRY HARDER.
MUCH MUCH HARDER.

396
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,750
SO THAT I CAN DO ANYTHING,
LIKE MISS AOI.

397
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:14,333
SO I CAN BE STRONG-WILLED,
LIKE MISS MIYABI.

398
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,791
SO I CAN BE BRIGHT,
LIKE TINA-SENPAI.

399
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:21,000
AND SO I CAN BE AS HONEST
WITH MYSELF AS MISS MAYU.

400
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,833
I HAVE TO BECOME
A WONDERFUL WOMAN,

401
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,291
SO THAT I AM WORTHY OF HIM.

402
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,500
AND I'LL HAVE TO TRY
EVEN HARDER THAN I AM NOW.

403
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,416
- YOU'VE SURE CHANGED A LOT,
TAEKO.

404
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,250
- REALLY?
- YOU USED TO BE SO AFRAID

405
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,041
OF SPENDING TIME
AROUND GUYS.

406
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,333
BUT WHEN YOU'RE WITH
BIG BROTHER,

407
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,000
YOU'RE VERY NATURAL.

408
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,166
THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT
HE WAS YOUR BOYFRIEND,

409
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,500
WHEN I FIRST SAW HIM.

410
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:45,958
- I SEE.

411
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,291
- YEAH.
BUT, YOU KNOW...

412
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,750
( panting )

413
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,583
BIG BROTHER!

414
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,750
HEY, LISTEN...

415
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,583
- AAH!
- ( gasping )

416
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:57,750
- AAH!

417
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,166
- YEAH!

418
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,666
...BUT, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU TAKE TOO LONG

419
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,583
TO BECOME
A WONDERFUL WOMAN, TAEKO,

420
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:07,166
I JUST MIGHT GROW UP IN TIME
TO STEAL HIM AWAY FROM YOU.

421
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,083
- ( Tina and Mayu growling )
- CHIKA-CHAN...

422
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,208
- LET'S PLAY AGAIN SOON,
BIG BROTHER.

423
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,333
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING,

424
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,666
KISSING KAORU LIKE THAT?!

425
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,125
- THAT'S RIGHT!
THE ONLY ONE HERE

426
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,458
WHO'S EVER TO KISS
HANABISHI-SAMA IS ME!

427
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,291
- WHAT?!
- YOU HAVE A PROBLEM?!

428
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,416
- ( both growling )

429
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,083
- OH.  OH.

430
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,750
- DO YOUR BEST, TAEKO, OKAY?

431
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,958
- HEY!
- ( Tina and Mayu shouting )

432
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,083
- Miyabi:
HONESTLY...

433
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,250
( sighs )

434
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,250
- Tina: COME ON!

435
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,958
- YEAH.
I'LL DO MY BEST.

436
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,958
- ( waves crashing )

437
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:55,166
- ( end theme playing )

438
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

439
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,916
- ( Tina giggles )

440
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,583
FINALLY ME AND KAORU WILL--

441
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,041
- Chika:
WHAT'LL YOU DO WITH HIM?

442
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:28,208
- I CAN'T SAY IT!
IT'S SO EMBARRASSING!

443
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:29,333
- WHAT IS IT?

444
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:32,500
- "AI YORI AOSHI:
BEDSHARING."

445
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,000
- YOU'RE GONNA GIVE A HAIRCUT
TO YOUR PET?

446
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,625
- THAT'S PET-SHEARING!
