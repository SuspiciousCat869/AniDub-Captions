- HUH?

4
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:57,208
- I AM NOT PERFECT,

5
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,916
BUT I HOPE YOU WILL
LEARN TO ACCEPT ME.

KAORU-SAMA!

10
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,333
- AOI-CHAN,
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

11
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,916
REALLY.
- ( sniffles )

( light sobs )

13
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,375
- THAT'LL DO IT.

14
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,833
HERE, THIS SHOULD WORK,
AOI-CHAN.

15

- ( giggles ) I MADE
YOUR FAVORITE TODAY.

28
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,000
- Announcer: TOKYO, TOKYO.

29
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:16,000
PLEASE TRANSFER TO
THE JR AND SUBWAY LINES HERE.

30
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,958
- WHICH IS THE ONE
I SHOULD TAKE?

31
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:30,416
( shyly )
UM, PARDON ME.

32
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,583
( gasps )

33
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,166
- IT'S ONE OF THOSE
CHERRY BLOSSOM PATTERNS.

34
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,416
- ( machine whirs )
( beeping )

35
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,916
- I WONDER WHY THIS GATE
WILL NOT LET ME PASS.

36
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,250
( gasps )

37
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,458
OH.

38
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,166
- EXCUSE ME.

39
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,625
EXCUSE ME,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

40
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,250
- OH, I APOLOGIZE
FOR THE TROUBLE. 

41
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,041
I THANK YOU
VERY MUCH. 

42
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,333
- OH, YOUR SANDAL.

43
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:26,375
- HOW TROUBLESOME.
WHAT WILL I DO?

44
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,208
- COULD YOU PLEASE HOLD
ONTO MY SHOULDER

45
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,708
FOR A LITTLE BIT.
- HUH?!

46
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,750
- IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
- SU-- SURE.

47
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:38,750
- IT'S PRETTY RARE,

48
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,500
A TSUMUGI
ON SOMEONE YOUR AGE.

49
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:43,041
- YOUR OBI HAS A NICE
DESIGN FOR SPRING TOO.

50
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:46,208
- YOU SEEM FAMILIAR
WITH KIMONOS.

51
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,875
- JUST A BIT.

52
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,083
- ( woman sighs )
- Man: THESE TWO GET IT.

53
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,583
- THAT SHOULD DO IT.

54
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,583
I THINK IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT,
BUT IT'S ONLY TEMPORARY

55
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,416
UNTIL YOU GET IT
FIXED PROPERLY.

56
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,208
- THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR KINDNESS. 

57
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,833
- OH, MY PLEASURE.
- THEN IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME...

58
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,708
- HEY, WAIT A SECOND.
- YES.

59
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,041
- THAT'S A HOKUBU LINE TICKET,
RIGHT?

60
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,875
SO THEN THE GATE
THAT YOU NEED TO GO THROUGH

61
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,625
IS WAY OVER THERE.
- OH, I WAS NOT AWARE.

62
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,958
HOW WILL I BE ABLE
TO REACH IT THEN? 

63
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,416
- LET'S SEE, YOU GO
STRAIGHT THAT WAY, 

64
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,416
LEFT AT THE T-INTERSECTION,

65
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,958
RIGHT AT THE FIRST
FLIGHT OF STAIRS. 

66
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,166
- GO STRAIGHT,
THEN LEFT,

67
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,125
RIGHT...
- UM, DID YOU GET THAT?

68
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:39,750
- SOMEWHAT. I BELIEVE THAT I'LL
BE ABLE TO FIND MY WAY.

69
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,541
SO I MUST WALK STRAIGHT AHEAD...
- LOOKS LIKE

70
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,250
SHE'LL JUST
GET HERSELF LOST.

71
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,250
IF YOU'D LIKE,
I CAN COME WITH YOU,

72
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,833
SINCE I'M ON MY WAY HOME
ON THAT SAME TRAIN.

73
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,125
- ... AND THEN TURN LEFT
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

74
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,625
YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO?

75
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,041
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

76
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,000
AND YOU REPAIRED
MY SANDAL STRAP TOO.

77
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,958
I WILL NEVER FORGET
YOUR KINDNESS.

78
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,541
- THAT'S A LITTLE MUCH.

79
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,375
- ( machine whirs )
- ( gasps )

80
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,625
- Kaoru: IT'S HARD TO SWITCH
TRAINS IN TOKYO, ISN'T IT?

81
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:06,625
- YES, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
THE PROCESS AT ALL.

82
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,416
- WHEN I FIRST STARTED
GOING TO COLLEGE,

83
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,375
I USED TO GET LOST
ALL THE TIME TOO. 

84
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,458
- OH, A COLLEGE STUDENT,
ARE YOU?

85
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,833
- UH-HUH.  I STARTED
JUNIOR YEAR THIS SPRING.

86
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,291
- YOU ARE GOOD
WITH YOUR HANDS.

87
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,041
- HUH? OH, THE SANDAL STRAP.

88
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,458
- YOU ALSO SEEM TO KNOW
A LOT ABOUT KIMONOS.

89
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,666
- WHEN I WAS A KID,
I USED TO DRESS UP A LOT

90
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,708
IN TRADITIONAL
JAPANESE CLOTHING.

91
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,458
MY MOM ACTUALLY USED TO WEAR 
THE TSUMUGI KIMONO A LOT TOO.

92
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,208
SO I'M CERTAINLY NO STRANGER

93
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:35,000
WHEN IT COMES TO TALKING
ABOUT THOSE SORTS OF THINGS.

94
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,500
SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO BORE YOU.

95
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,000
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

96
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,541
YOU HELPED ME OUT
SO MUCH.

97
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,458
I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA
WHAT TOKYO WAS LIKE.

98
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,583
AND I WAS WORRIED
ABOUT FINDING MY WAY.

99
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,250
SO MEETING SOMEONE
WHO APPRECIATES KIMONOS

100
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,875
IS TRULY A GREAT RELIEF.

101
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,250
- Announcer: TOYAMADAI,
TOYAMADAI.

102
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:55,625
WE WILL BE HOLDING HERE
UNTIL THE EXPRESS TRAIN PASSES.

103
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,833
- WE FINALLY HAVE A SEAT.
- YEAH.

104
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,125
- ONE, TWO...

105
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,833
FOUR MORE STOPS UNTIL
IZUMIGAOKA.

106
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,541
- LOOKS LIKE IT.

107
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,333
- ( thinking ) SHE SAID
IT WAS HER FIRST TIME HERE.

108
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,833
BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE SHE'S A TOURIST.

109
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,666
A BOYFRIEND MAYBE.

110
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,500
- IS SOMETHING ON MY FACE?
YOU KEEP STARING.

111
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,625
- NO, N-- NOT REALLY.

112
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,250
UM, CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
- YES.

113
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,416
- WHY ARE YOU HERE
IN TOKYO?

114
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,541
- ACTUALLY, I CAME HERE
TO SEE SOMEBODY.

115
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,708
- SO COULD IT BE A GUY?

116
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,791
- YEAH, YES.

117
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,750
- ( thinking )
AND I WAS ONLY JOKING TOO.

118
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,416
- BUT THEN I CAME HERE
TO TOKYO

119
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,291
ON A WHIM, NOT KNOWING
IF I COULD MEET HIM OR NOT.

120
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,083
I WAS UNSURE
OF THE DIRECTIONS.

121
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,250
AND I WAS TERRIFIED, HONESTLY.

122
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,875
SO I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT
IN GUIDING ME LIKE THIS

123
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,333
FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.

124
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,041
( yawns )

125
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:58,291
IT'S NOT VERY OFTEN THAT 
I STEP OUTSIDE ON MY OWN.

126
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,125
BUT FOR SOME REASON,

127
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:03,750
I FEEL MORE SLEEPY
THAN RELIEVED.

128
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:12,291
- Announcer: IZUMIGAOKA,
IZUMIGAOKO.

129
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:15,083
- WAKE UP.  WE'RE IN
IZUMIGAOKA STATION NOW.

130
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,958
- ( phone ringing )
- HEY, COME ON.

131
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,125
HEY, WAKE UP!

132
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,791
THERE GOES OUR STOP.

133
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,750
I GUESS IT'S FINE.  SHEESH.

134
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,583
SHE MIGHT BE A LITTLE CLUELESS
ABOUT THE WORLD,

135
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:34,416
BUT SHE'S STILL
KINDA CUTE.

136
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,916
- ( sighs )

137
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,041
I APOLOGIZE! WHEN DID I--

138
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:46,708
IS THE STOP MUCH FURTHER?
- IT'S COMING UP.

139
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,500
- I ALMOST SLEPT
PASSED THE STOP.

140
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,458
- YOU MEAN
A SECOND TIME, RIGHT?

141
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,458
- ( phone rings )

142
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,500
- Aoi: I REALLY DO APOLOGIZE
FOR ALL THIS TROUBLE.

143
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,875
IT'S OKAY.
ISHI IZUMI BLOCK, RIGHT?

144
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:01,333
I LIVE AROUND THERE. 
- AGAIN, I APOLOGIZE.

145
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:07,625
- SO WHAT'S HE LIKE,
THIS GUY THAT YOU'RE VISITING?

146
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,125
- GENTLE.  WE HAVE NOT
SEEN ONE ANOTHER

147
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,458
IN A LONG TIME,
BUT I DO REMEMBER THAT.

148
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,375
AND IT'S AS IF MY HEART
IS PUT AT EASE

149
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,583
EVERY TIME I THINK OF HIM.

150
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,541
( giggles )
- WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

151
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,416
- I JUST REMEMBERED THAT
AN INCIDENT FROM MY CHILDHOOD

152
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,875
WAS VERY SIMILAR TO
WHAT HAPPENED EARLIER.

153
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:31,666
THE STRAP ON MY SANDAL BROKE
MUCH LIKE IT DID TODAY.

154
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,458
AND HE REPAIRED IT FOR ME.

155
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,458
NOW THAT I THINK OF IT,

156
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,708
HE MUST HAVE BEEN GOOD 
WITH HIS HANDS AS WELL.

157
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,458
- OH.

158
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,416
YOU REALLY LOVE
THIS GUY A LOT, HUH?

159
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,083
- I DO. HE IS THE FIRST ONE

160
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,833
I HAVE EVER
LOVED IN MY LIFE.

161
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:50,000
WHEN I THINK OF HIM,
I FEEL BLESSED

162
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,833
TO HAVE BEEN BORN
INTO THIS WORLD

163
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,125
AND TO HAVE MET HIM.

164
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,833
- THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING,

165
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,750
TO FEEL SO MUCH
FOR ONE PERSON.

166
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,041
I HOPE YOU GET
TO SEE HIM SOON.

167
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,166
- ME TOO.

168
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,750
- IT SHOULD BE AROUND HERE
ACCORDING TO THIS ADDRESS.

169
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,541
YUP, NO MISTAKE.

170
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,041
IT'S RIGHT AROUND THAT CORNER.

171
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:17,000
- I WILL FIND HIM
AROUND THIS CORNER.

172
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,750
( gasps )

173
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,916
- ( siren wails )

174
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,833
- ARE YOU SURE
THERE'S NO MISTAKE?

175
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,708
- WELL, IF THE ADDRESS
IS RIGHT, THIS IS IT. 

176
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,083
- THAT CANNOT BE.

177
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,083
NO!

178
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:52,750
I THOUGHT I WOULD
FINALLY SEE HIM. 

179
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,333
THIS CANNOT BE TRUE.

180
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:02,833
WHAT WILL I DO NOW?

181
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,875
- ( rain spatters )

182
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:28,083
- Kaoru: DRINK THIS.
AND TRY TO CHEER UP.

183
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,916
- ( despondently )
ALL RIGHT.

184
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,083
- HAVING HER COME UP HERE
IS FINE AND ALL,

185
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:41,625
BUT WHAT CAN I SAY TO HER
IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS?

186
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,625
UM, ARE YOU OKAY?

187
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,666
ALL I CAN DO
IS FEEL SORRY FOR HER.

188
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,208
I WANT TO
HELP HER SOMEHOW.

189
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,875
EXCUSE ME,
BUT DON'T YOU HAVE

190
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,416
ANY OTHER CLUES
THAT YOU CAN USE.

191
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:10,541
- A PHOTOGRAPH
OF MYSELF AND HIM.

192
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,791
- BUT IT'S
A CHILDHOOD PICTURE.

193
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,666
HMM?

194
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,583
HEY, HAVEN'T I SEEN THIS
SOMEWHERE?

195
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,541
ISN'T THIS ME 
AND AOI-CHAN?!

196
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,041
- HUH? WHAT WAS THAT?

197
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:31,250
- I SAID TH--
THIS WAS A PHOTO

198
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,875
OF AOI-CHAN AND ME.

199
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,375
- THEN THAT MEANS
THAT YOU ARE...

200
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,333
KAORU-SAMA?

201
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,750
- YEAH, I'M KAORU HANABISHI.

202
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,041
- Young Kaoru: AOI-CHAN,
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

203
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,875
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

204
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,916
- Present Kaoru:
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

205
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,750
- ( gasps )

206
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,208
( gasping )

207
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,291
OH, KAORU-SAMA!

208
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,250
KAORU-SAMA! KAORU-SAMA!

209
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,125
KAORU-SAMA!

210
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,666
FOR 18 YEARS,

211
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,750
I'VE BEEN WAITING PATIENTLY
FOR THIS MOMENT.

212
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,333
- 18 YEARS?
- TO THINK THAT THE PERSON

213
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,375
WHO WAS SO KIND TO ME
WAS YOU.

214
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,833
I HAVE NEVER FELT THE FORCE
CALLED DESTINY

215
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,458
MORE STRONGLY THAN NOW!

216
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,166
- UH, HOLD ON A MINUTE.
CALM DOWN.

217
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,500
I THINK I NEED 
AN EXPLANATION.

218
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,416
- I APOLOGIZE.

219
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,208
IN SHORT, I, 
AOI SAKURABA,

220
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,916
HAVE COME WITH THE INTENTION
OF BEING YOUR WIFE.

221
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,958
- HUH?

222
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,416
WIFE?!

223
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,541
- YES, I AM TO BECOME 
YOUR WIFE, KAORU-SAMA.

224
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,208
- IT'S TRUE THAT
I REMEMBER YOU NOW, AOI-CHAN,

225
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:43,000
BUT YOU BECOMING MY WIFE?

226
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,916
- THE DREAM THAT I HAVE HAD
FOR ALL OF MY LIFE

227
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,083
IS FINALLY COMING TRUE.

228
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:51,458
COME, LET US RETURN TO THE
HANABISHI FAMILY TOGETHER.

229
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,875
- HANABISHI!

230
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,166
- ONCE YOU RETURN TO THEM,

231
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,000
YOU AND I
CAN BE TOGETHER.

232
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,750
- I SEE.

233
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,708
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

234
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,458
- KAORU-SAMA?

235
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,958
- IF THEY WANT ME BACK
IN HANABISHI,

236
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,875
THEY CAN COME
STRAIGHT TO ME!

237
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,916
TRYING TO LURE ME BACK
USING A GIRL!

238
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,208
I TRUST THEM EVEN LESS
AFTER THIS.

239
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,500
- KAORU-SAMA?

240
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:21,208
- AOI-CHAN, I WON'T
GO BACK TO HANABISHI.

241
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,208
I'M SORRY, BUT PLEASE
LEAVE NOW.

242
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,166
- ( door slams )

243
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,083
- ( Aoi cries )
KAORU-SAMA.

244
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:38,333
YOU MUST HAVE
REALLY LEFT HANABISHI

245
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,458
BECAUSE YOU
DID NOT LIKE ME.

246
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,375
- HMPH! I ALMOST 
LET THEM FOOL ME.

247
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,875
I'M SURE THOSE HANABISHI GUYS
RIGGED ALL THIS.

248
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,708
WHEN THEY FIND OUT THAT THEIR
NASTY LITTLE PLAN DIDN'T WORK,

249
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,791
I'M SURE THAT SOMEONE WILL BE BY
TO TAKE HER BACK.

250
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,083
AND IT'S LIKE I SAID.
HERE THEY COME,

251
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,833
JUST LIKE CLOCKWORK.

252
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,250
HUH?
- ( both chuckle )

253
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,791
- THEY'RE NOT FROM
HANABISHI!

254
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,333
- YOU HERE
BY YOURSELF, GIRL?

255
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:13,666
- YOU WANT TO KARAOKE?

256
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,375
- YEAH, LET'S GO KARAOKE.

257
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,625
- YOU'LL JUST CATCH A COLD
STANDING OUT HERE.

258
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,208
HEY, HOW ABOUT
A BITE TO EAT?

259
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:24,333
- WE KNOW A JOINT AROUND HERE
THAT'S GOT A GOOD OCEAN VIEW.

260
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,791
- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

261
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,875
- HUH? AND WHO ARE YOU?
- HEY, BUDDY,

262
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,250
WE WEREN'T
TALKING TO YOU.

263
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,208
- KAORU-SAMA.

264
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,166
- YOU TRYING TO STEAL HER
AWAY FROM US?

265
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,166
- WE ASKED THE GIRL OUT
FIRST, YOU KNOW?

266
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,500
- AIN'T YOU
GONNA SAY SOMETHING?

267
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,375
- IT WAS GOOD
I JUMPED OUT HERE,

268
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,833
BUT THEY LOOK PRETTY STRONG.

269
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,875
WHAT SHOULD I DO?
UM, UH...

270
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,500
- Both: HUH?

271
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,500
- SH-- SH--

272
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,291
SHE'S MY GIRL!
G-- GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT?

273
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,833
- Both: HUH?

274
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,791
- KAORU-SAMA?

275
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,166
- THAT WASN'T SMART.

276
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,250
DID THAT REALLY JUST COME
OUT OF MY MOUTH?

277
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,500
- DAMN IT! AWW!
SO SHE'S ALREADY TAKEN.

278
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:07,541
- YOU SHOULDN'T LET A GIRL
WAIT AROUND HER ALL BY HERSELF.

279
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,708
- LET'S GO.  DAMN!

280
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,000
- ( sighs ) HUH?

281
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:19,625
OH, WERE YOU SCARED?
EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT NOW.

282
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,041
COME ON,
IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW.

283
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,916
- NO, I...
( sobs )

284
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,541
AM JUST HAPPY
THAT YOU JUST SAID

285
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:31,666
THAT I WAS YOUR GIRL,
LIE OR NOT.

286
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,666
( sniffles )

287
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,583
- THAT'S TRUE.

288
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,083
A GOOD GIRL LIKE HER
WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

289
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:44,333
AOI-CHAN, SORRY. I JUMPED
TO CONCLUSIONS, I GUESS.

290
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,291
IN ANY CASE, LET'S GO BACK.

291
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,750
MY FEET KIND OF HURT
STANDING HERE.

292
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,583
OKAY?

293
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,500
- KAORU-SAMA.

294
00:17:57,083 --> 00:18:00,125
- SO YOU AND I
WERE PROMISED TO WED?

295
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,166
- YES, WE HAVE SEEN
ONE ANOTHER

296
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,208
QUITE A FEW TIMES
IN OUR YOUTH.

297
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,458
- ( laughs )

298
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,791
- HUH?

299
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,250
- ( gasps )

300
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,708
- Present Aoi:
SINCE THEN,

301
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,291
I WAS RAISED TO BE YOUR WIFE,
KAORU-SAMA...

302
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:29,000
TO DO EVERYTHING THAT
I POSSIBLY CAN DO FOR YOU.

303
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:32,208
YOU WERE NOT AWARE
OF ANY OF THIS, KAORU-SAMA?

304
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,541
- WELL, YOU SEE,
I THINK I REMEMBER

305
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,500
SOMETHING THAT WAS SAID
ALONG THOSE LINES,

306
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,000
BUT NOTHING CONCRETE.

307
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:42,500
- HOWEVER, ONE DAY, I WAS TOLD
TO FORGET THAT PROMISE.

308
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,500
SO I WISHED TO
MEET YOU IN PERSON

309
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,458
AND HEAR THE TRUTH.

310
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,333
- THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE.

311
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,291
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT LIKE
I LEFT HANABISHI

312
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,708
BECAUSE I DIDN'T LIKE YOU.

313
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:55,458
IT'S JUST A LOT HAPPENED
BACK THERE.

314
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,625
- THANK GOODNESS.

315
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:07,000
- YOU MUST BE TIRED. 
SO RELAX FOR TONIGHT.

316
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,041
- UH, UM, WILL IT
BE ALL RIGHT

317
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,875
FOR ME TO STAY HERE
TONIGHT?

318
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,916
- WELL, IT REALLY IS GETTING
PRETTY LATE, AFTER ALL.

319
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,291
I'LL GO GET
THE BATH READY.

320
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,541
OH, YOU TOLD YOUR FOLKS
BEFORE YOU LEFT

321
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,083
THAT YOU WERE COMING HERE,
RIGHT?

322
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,708
- YES, OF COURSE I DID.

323
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,083
THERE IS NO NEED
TO CONTACT THEM NOW!

324
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,041
I SUPPOSE I WILL
TAKE A BATH NOW.

325
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,541
- YOU'RE COLD, RIGHT?

326
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:30,916
TAKE YOUR TIME
AND WARM UP.

327
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,083
- I WILL.

328
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,333
- TO THINK THAT A GIRL'S 
TAKING A BATH IN MY ROOM,

329
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,000
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.

330
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,625
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
ONE'S EVEN BEEN IN HERE.

331
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,708
- ( clothes ruffle )

332
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:56,166
- WOW, WHY DOES IT
SOUND SO SEXY

333
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,791
WHEN SOMEONE TAKES OFF
A KIMONO?

334
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:02,125
- ( ruffling continues )
- ( clock ticks )

335
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,541
- HMM!

336
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,000
- 18 YEARS, HUH?

337
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,500
I NEVER HEARD
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

338
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:32,875
- ( silent )

339
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,375
- IT'S A PROBLEM.

340
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,375
SHE'S A REALLY NICE GIRL,

341
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:41,458
SO IT ISN'T HORRIBLE, 
BUT THIS IS SO SUDDEN.

342
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,666
I CAN'T GET MY HEAD
OUT OF THE CLOUDS. 

343
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,083
- ( cries )

344
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,208
( crying )

345
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,166
- HUH?

346
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,000
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

347
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,416
- N-- NO.
IT'S NOTHING.

348
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,208
- OH.
OH, OKAY.

349
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:07,791
( gasps )

350
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:14,583
- SHE WORE THIS KIND
OF UNDERWEAR?

351
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,416
UH!

352
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:41,416
- I AM SO GLAD KAORU-SAMA
DOES NOT HATE ME.

353
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:46,208
I AM TRULY BLESSED

354
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,750
THAT I WAS ABLE
TO MEET KAORU-SAMA.

355
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:55,750
- ( theme music plays )

356
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

357
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:25,791
- Aoi: I WISH TO FULFILL
WHATEVER KAORU-SAMA DESIRES.

358
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:29,208
HUH? YOU WANT TO SLEEP
IN THE SAME FUTON?

359
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,583
AI YORI AOSHI.

360
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:32,250
"SUPPER."

361
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:35,208
I WILL ALWAYS BE
BY YOUR SIDE.
