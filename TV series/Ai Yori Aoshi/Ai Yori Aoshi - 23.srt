1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,916
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,583
- Miyabi: SIR KAORU.
- HUH?

4
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,166
- Miyabi:
DO YOU REMEMBER--

5
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,416
I AM REFERRING TO THE TIME WHEN
YOU AND I FIRST MET EACH OTHER.

6
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,250
- Kaoru: OH, YEAH.

7
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:15,291
- EVEN BEFORE WE MET,
I TRULY DESPISED YOU,

8
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,583
TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST.

9
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:19,083
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED
SINCE THAT TIME.

10
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,916
AFTER SEEING HOW 
LADY AOI HAS BEEN

11
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,916
SINCE SHE MET YOU--

12
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
WHAT SHE THOUGHT,

13
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,583
WHAT SHE FELT

14
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,458
AND WHAT SHE LONGED FOR...

15
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,791
I HAVE FINALLY
BEGUN TO UNDERSTAND.

16
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,083
IF THAT TRULY
IS THE CASE NOW,

17
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,791
NO MATTER WHAT MAY
HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE,

18
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,125
I PROMISE I WILL DO
ALL I CAN TO PROTECT YOU.

19
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,750
- Tina: THIS NOTE WAS
POSTED ON KAORU'S DOOR.

20
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,916
- WHAT?  WHY WOULD HE
LEAVE LIKE THAT?

21
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,208
- DO YOU KNOW IF HE HAD
SOMEWHERE ELSE TO BE?

22
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,708
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

23
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,458
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
HOW CAN YOU HAVE NO IDEA?

24
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,916
- WHAT PART OF THAT 
DIDN'T YOU GET, HUH?

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,625
- DON'T BE IRRESPONSIBLE,
JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION.

26
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,250
- HOW'S THAT IRRESPONSIBLE?

27
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,541
- IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE
SINCE YOU'RE IRRESPONSIBLE.

28
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,250
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- OHH.

29
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,125
WOULD YOU STOP
FIGHTING OVER THIS?

30
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,625
- MR. SAIONJI?

31
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,250
- Saionji: HMM.

32
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,416
I DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS
ANY NEED FOR CONCERN,

33
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,083
CONSIDERING THE NOTE.

34
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,583
- IF YOU SAY SO,
BUT MAYU IS STILL CONCERNED.

35
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:34,250
- WHAT THE HECK'S GOING ON
INSIDE OF KAORU'S HEAD,

36
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,333
LEAVING LIKE THAT?

37
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,791
- OH, ARE YOU TRYING
TO INSINUATE

38
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,958
THAT THIS IS ALL
HANABISHI-SAMA'S FAULT?

39
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,333
- YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH THAT OR SOMETHING?

40
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,250
- COME ON,
STOP FIGHTING.

41
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,166
JEEZ, WHERE IN
THE WORLD DID YOU GO?

42
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,041
BIG BROTHER!

43
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,500
- Kaoru: THIS IS--
- Aoi: KAORU-SAMA!

44
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,458
( panting )

45
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,583
( grunts )

46
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,625
KAORU-SAMA.

47
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,041
YOU'RE HERE, KAORU-SAMA.

48
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:24,916
- I'M RELIEVED.

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,250
I THOUGHT THAT SOMETHING
HAD HAPPENED TO YOU.

50
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,458
- ( crying )

51
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,250
- ( clears throat )
- ( both gasp )

52
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,625
- Aoi: MISS MIYABI?
- UH?

53
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,125
- I APOLOGIZE
FOR TROUBLING YOU.

54
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,791
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
ALL THAT YOU'VE DONE.

55
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,791
- OF COURSE.

56
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,250
- AOI-CHAN,

57
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,750
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
WHEN YOU WERE BACK AT HOME?

58
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,083
- EVERYTHING IS FINE.

59
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,916
IT REALLY WAS
NOTHING IMPORTANT.

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,583
- HUH?  BUT...

61
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,250
- WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT
FOR US TO TAKE A SHORT WALK?

62
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,416
- GO AHEAD.
I HAVE SOME ERRANDS TO RUN,

63
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,875
SO I WILL NOT BE ABLE
TO ACCOMPANY YOU, UNFORTUNATELY.

64
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,083
- Aoi:
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

65
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,750
SHALL WE, KAORU-SAMA?

66
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:05,791
- Kaoru: SURE.

67
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,000
- ( giggles )

68
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,541
I HAVE TO SAY THAT TAKING
A LEISURELY WALK WITH YOU

69
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:20,916
IS ALWAYS ENJOYABLE.

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,250
- YEAH, REALLY?

71
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,291
- OH?  KAORU-SAMA,
LOOK THERE.

72
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:28,958
ADORABLE.

73
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,583
ESPECIALLY WITH ITS CHEEKS
BULGING OUT LIKE THAT.

74
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,625
( giggles )

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,541
- ( softly chuckles )

76
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:44,750
WOW.

77
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,250
THERE WAS A SHRINE BUILT
ALL THE WAY OUT HERE?

78
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,583
- YES.

79
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,416
ACTUALLY,
THERE'S A GOD OF ROMANCE

80
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,416
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY.

81
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,875
- Kaoru: YOU'RE RIGHT.

82
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,166
ALL THE WISHING PLATES
ARE ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS.

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,583
- ( sighs )

84
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,125
DELICIOUS.

85
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,583
- YEAH.

86
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,041
HEY, ISN'T THAT--

87
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,083
- ( giggles )

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,333
- THAT TREE.

89
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,250
HEY, AOI-CHAN,

90
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,833
I'VE BEEN AROUND THIS PLACE
BEFORE, HAVEN'T I?

91
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,541
- YES.  IT WAS HERE

92
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,541
THAT YOU AND I SPENT
OUR TIME TOGETHER

93
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,708
AFTER OUR INITIAL MEETING,
KAORU-SAMA.

94
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,416
Aoi:
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

95
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,250
WHEN I FIRST
MET YOU THAT DAY,

96
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,125
I HAVE TO ADMIT I FELT
A LITTLE FRIGHTENED.

97
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,125
THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE TRACE
OF EMOTION ON YOUR FACE.

98
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,916
IT WAS AS IF
YOU LACKED THEM ENTIRELY.

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,541
BUT WHEN WE CAME OUT
TO THESE WOODS,

100
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,250
YOU REALLY SURPRISED ME.

101
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,125
- ( Young Kaoru laughs )

102
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,916
- Young Aoi:
WAIT FOR ME, KAORU-SAMA!

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,625
COME ON, SLOW DOWN.

104
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,458
- Aoi: THE REAL YOU

105
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:06,125
WAS A VERY CHEERFUL BOY.

106
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,166
AND SLIGHTLY MISCHIEVOUS.

107
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,041
- ( croaks )
- ( screams )

108
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,708
- ( laughs )

109
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:13,916
DID I SURPRISE YOU?

110
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,291
- KAORU-SAMA,
YOU'RE A MEANIE.

111
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,166
- ARE YOU OKAY,
AOI-CHAN?

112
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,291
- THAT HURT A LOT.
( crying )

113
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,916
- COME ON, AOI-CHAN.
- HMM?

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,583
- Aoi: BUT YOU WERE
A VERY KIND

115
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,541
AND VERY WONDERFUL PERSON.

116
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,125
- ( murmurs )

117
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,458
- WELL, HURRY UP.

118
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,250
- OKAY.

119
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,583
- Kaoru: YOU KNOW,

120
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,833
I THINK I REMEMBER
BEING A LITTLE NERVOUS

121
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:39,916
WHEN I FIRST MET YOU.

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,958
- Aoi: NERVOUS?

123
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,250
- Kaoru: YEAH.

124
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,916
WELL, IT'S BECAUSE
YOUR HAIR WAS SO SHINY,

125
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,916
AND YOU LOOKED SO CUTE.

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,958
I THOUGHT YOU LOOKED
JUST LIKE A DOLL.

127
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,000
YOU WERE SUCH
A CUTE GIRL, 

128
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,083
SO I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE FUN
TO TRY TO MAKE YOU LAUGH

129
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,416
OR CATCH YOU BY SURPRISE.

130
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,750
- HUH?
IF THAT'S SO...

131
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,333
THAT'S THE REASON
YOU WERE PLAYING 

132
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,083
ALL THOSE MEAN
PRANKS ON ME. 

133
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,291
- ( chuckles )
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

134
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,291
- ( sighs )

135
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,916
- Kaoru: I REALLY HAD
A LOT OF FUN PLAYING HERE.

136
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,625
IT'S ALL STARTING
TO COME BACK.

137
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:15,916
- YOU CERTAINLY DID.

138
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,500
I REMEMBER THAT YOU WERE
ENJOYING YOURSELF.

139
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,083
- Kaoru: IT'S BECAUSE
THEY HARDLY LET ME PLAY

140
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,416
AT THE HANABISHI HOUSE.

141
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,666
- HEY, KAORU-SAMA!

142
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,916
- ( Aoi chuckles )
THAT'S WHY BACK THEN...

143
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,958
- COME ON.
WAKE UP, OKAY?

144
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:29,958
- OH.

145
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,916
- WHAT IS IT, AOI-CHAN?
- NOTHING.

146
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,291
PLEASE DON'T PAY
ANY ATTENTION.

147
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,583
- IT'S STILL SO BIG.

148
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,708
OH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

149
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,250
I THINK IT WAS
SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE.

150
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,083
OH, HERE IT IS.
I FOUND IT, AOI-CHAN.

151
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,375
- OH, SO YOU DID.

152
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,916
- Young Kaoru:
STAND RIGHT HERE, AOI-CHAN.

153
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,333
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
KAORU-SAMA?

154
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,250
- JUST WAIT A MINUTE, OKAY?

155
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,916
- IT'S NOT ANOTHER FROG,
IS IT?

156
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,583
- NOPE.  IT'S THIS.

157
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,250
- WOW.  IT'S SO PRETTY.
LET ME SEE IT.

158
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:08,333
- SORRY, BUT YOU CAN'T.
JUST HOLD STILL, OKAY? 

159
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,916
THIS IS THE GREATEST
TREASURE I HAVE

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,583
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

161
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,041
- OOH.

162
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:19,041
- YOU'RE THIS LINE,
AOI-CHAN.

163
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,375
AND I'M THIS ONE.

164
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,791
( chuckles )

165
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,125
ALL RIGHT,
LOOK AT THAT.

166
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,458
I'M WAY TALLER THAN YOU.

167
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:27,416
- WHAT?  I WANT TO
SEE YOU MEASURE US AGAIN.

168
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,083
- NO WAY.
( chuckles )

169
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,250
- PLEASE?
- NO WAY.

170
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,916
- Aoi:
IT WAS AFTER THAT DAY

171
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,916
THAT WE HAD TO
SAY GOOD-BYE. 

172
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,166
- Young Aoi: KAORU-SAMA!

173
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,250
- AOI-CHAN.

174
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:44,583
- KAORU-SAMA, I DON'T
WANT YOU TO GO BACK HOME.

175
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,166
- I'M SORRY.

176
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,166
- IS THIS FINE WITH YOU,
KAORU-SAMA?

177
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,833
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
TOGETHER WITH ME?

178
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,458
- THAT'S NOT
THE REASON AT ALL.

179
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:54,166
I REALLY WANTED TO SPEND MORE
TIME WITH YOU TOO, AOI-CHAN.

180
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,541
- THEN WHY DON'T YOU
JUST STAY HERE LONGER?

181
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,541
- I DON'T WANT TO
GO HOME EITHER.

182
00:09:58,625 --> 00:09:59,500
BUT...

183
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,250
AOI-CHAN?
- HUH?

184
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,666
- TAKE THIS.
I'LL LEND IT TO YOU.

185
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,458
- BUT THAT'S YOUR
GREATEST TREASURE

186
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,125
IN THE WHOLE WORLD,
ISN'T IT?

187
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,916
- IT'S OKAY.
JUST GIVE IT BACK TO ME

188
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,583
WHEN WE MEET AGAIN.

189
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,250
OH YEAH,
AND WHEN YOU DO,

190
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,666
WE'LL COMPARE HEIGHTS AGAIN,
AOI-CHAN.

191
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,083
OKAY?

192
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,375
- ( crying )

193
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,333
MM!  ALL RIGHT THEN,
KAORU-SAMA.

194
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,625
- IT'S A PROMISE.
- YEAH.

195
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,875
- THAT KEY WAS
ACTUALLY SOMETHING

196
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,458
THAT I INHERITED
FROM MY MOTHER. 

197
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,916
- OH?

198
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,958
- IT WAS THE KEY
TO HER OLD JEWELRY BOX.

199
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,083
BUT THE BOX ITSELF
WAS BURNED UP

200
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,041
ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER
MEMORIES OF MY MOTHER.

201
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,541
- KAORU-SAMA.

202
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:52,500
- YEAH?

203
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,458
- I HAVE HELD ONTO THIS
FOR A LONG TIME,

204
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,416
BUT I WILL NOW RETURN
THIS IMPORTANT MEMORY

205
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,041
OF YOUR MOTHER TO YOU
AS PROMISED.

206
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,250
- ( sighs )

207
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,666
THANK YOU.

208
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,250
BECAUSE YOU PROTECTED THAT KEY
ALL THIS TIME, AOI-CHAN,

209
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,083
AT LEAST ONE MEMORY
OF MY MOTHER

210
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,458
HAS MADE IT BACK TO ME.

211
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,250
- KAORU-SAMA.

212
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:20,958
I'M SO GLAD

213
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,916
THAT I MET YOU,
KAORU-SAMA.

214
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,583
I'M GLAD THAT
THE FIRST PERSON

215
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:28,916
I EVER FELL IN LOVE WITH
WAS YOU, KAORU-SAMA.

216
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:31,916
- ME TOO.

217
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,916
- ( car starts )

218
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,791
- Miyabi: "I WILL RETURN
TOMORROW MORNING

219
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,458
TO PICK YOU UP."

220
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,708
- BUT DOESN'T THAT MEAN
WE'RE GONNA...

221
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,333
Kaoru:
UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING...

222
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,166
- Aoi:
WE'RE ALL ALONE.

223
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,583
- Both: YOU KNOW--

224
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,250
- OH, I APOLOGIZE.

225
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,250
- THAT'S OKAY. IT'S NOTHING
YOU NEED TO APOLOGIZE FOR.

226
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,583
- NO, I GUESS IT ISN'T.

227
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,916
- UH, EXCUSE ME,
AOI-CHAN?

228
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,083
- WHAT?  WHAT IS IT?

229
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,750
- WOULD YOU MIND PASSING
THE SOY SAUCE?

230
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,416
- NOT AT ALL.  HERE.
- THANKS.

231
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,583
- ( gasps )
- UH...

232
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,791
- ( giggles )

233
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,916
IT'S A LITTLE FAR, 
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?

234
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,291
- YEAH, JUST A LITTLE BIT.

235
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:03,541
- UM, KAORU-SAMA?
- UH?

236
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,791
- WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT
IF I SAT DOWN NEXT TO YOU?

237
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,291
- Kaoru: UH, SURE.

238
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,250
- FOR SOME REASON, THIS FEELS
A LITTLE LIKE A HONEYMOON.

239
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,000
- UHH-- YEAH, KIND OF.

240
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,583
- OH?

241
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,250
- Kaoru:
LIKE A HONEYMOON, HUH?

242
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,916
THAT MEANS...

243
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,375
- KAORU-SAMA?
- ( gasps )

244
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:23,791
- SAY "AHH."

245
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,250
- WHERE DID THAT COME FROM,
AOI-CHAN?

246
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,916
- OH, I APOLOGIZE.

247
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,500
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO BE SO FORWARD.

248
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,250
IT'S JUST,
FROM THE EXPRESSION YOU HAD,

249
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,916
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD
ENJOY IT.

250
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,083
- HOW DID YOU KNOW?
- ( gasps )

251
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,583
- I WAS ACTUALLY
JUST THINKING

252
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,916
HOW I WANTED YOU
TO DO THAT.

253
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,708
- YOU REALLY MEAN IT?
- YEAH.

254
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,916
- WELL THEN, SAY "AHH."

255
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,083
- AHH.

256
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,083
MM!  THAT WAS TASTY.

257
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,083
- Aoi: THEN COULD 
THE NEXT ONE BE...

258
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,750
THIS ONE?
- WOW.

259
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:50,916
YOU'RE RIGHT AGAIN.

260
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,125
AHH.

261
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,458
- ( giggles )

262
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,083
- AOI-CHAN?
- HUH?

263
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,833
- ARE MY FEELINGS REALLY THAT
APPARENT ON MY FACE?

264
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,583
- OH, NO, IT ISN'T LIKE THAT
AT ALL, KAORU-SAMA.

265
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:01,916
I JUST WATCH YOU A LOT,

266
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,625
SO THAT'S HOW I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE FEELING.

267
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,625
WHAT I LIKE

268
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,791
IS THE EXPRESSION
YOU HAVE WHEN YOU'RE HAPPY,

269
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,250
AND ALSO THE ONE WHEN
YOU'RE DEEP IN THOUGHT.

270
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,250
HOWEVER,

271
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,791
WHAT I LIKE BEST IS
YOUR SMILE, KAORU-SAMA.

272
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,666
- AOI-CHAN.

273
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,333
( yawns )

274
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,250
- DID YOU HAVE
TOO MUCH FOOD TO EAT?

275
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,541
- YEAH.
( sighs )

276
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,708
IT ALL TASTED SO GOOD.

277
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,166
HUH?

278
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,458
KEEP THAT UP AND YOU'LL GET
TIRED OF LOOKING AT ME ONE DAY.

279
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,625
- NOT AT ALL.

280
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,625
I'LL NEVER GET
TIRED OF LOOKING

281
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,916
AT THE FACE OF 
THE ONE I LOVE.

282
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,833
- OHH.

283
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,500
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

284
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,625
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
TAKE OUR BATHS SOON.

285
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:48,916
AOI-CHAN,

286
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,458
WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE YOURS FIRST?

287
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,208
- KAORU-SAMA?
- HUH?

288
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,125
- WHY DON'T WE 
BATHE TOGETHER?

289
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,916
PARDON ME.

290
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,791
- ( gasps )

291
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,583
- WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT
TO SIT BY YOUR SIDE?

292
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,916
- UH, SURE.

293
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:33,916
( gulps )

294
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,583
- YOU HAVE QUITE
A LARGE BACK.

295
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,000
THERE'S SO MUCH TO WASH.
- YOU THINK SO?

296
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,916
- ANOTHER ONE OF
MY DREAMS CAME TRUE.

297
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,583
- DREAMS?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

298
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,791
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO SCRUB YOUR BACK

299
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,083
JUST LIKE THIS,
KAORU-SAMA.

300
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,000
( gasps )

301
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:00,916
- SORRY.

302
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,208
I KNOW IT'S NOT
A PRETTY SIGHT TO LOOK AT.

303
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,750
IT'S OKAY, AOI-CHAN.

304
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,000
I REALLY DON'T MIND DOING
THIS AT ALL, HONESTLY.

305
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,625
- UM...
- HUH? 

306
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:12,250
- DO THESE
OLD INJURIES STILL...

307
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,583
- WELL, YEAH, SOMETIMES.

308
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,125
BUT IT'S KIND OF STRANGE.

309
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,166
- ( gasps )

310
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,250
- I THINK IT WAS
ABOUT THE TIME

311
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,583
YOU HELPED WIPE MY BACK
IN THE OLD APARTMENT,

312
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,916
BUT SINCE THAT TIME,
THE PAIN'S STARTED TO FADE.

313
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,458
I'M SURE THAT IT'S BECAUSE
YOU'VE BEEN HEALING MY WOUNDS

314
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:29,916
OVER TIME,
LIKE YOU SAID.

315
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,416
- ( gasps )

316
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,916
- HUH?  AOI-CHAN?

317
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,125
- I...

318
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,791
I HAVE DREAMS,

319
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,500
MANY OF WHICH
HAVE COME TRUE.

320
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,166
I'VE DREAMT OF
PREPARING YOUR DINNER

321
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,708
AND DRAWING YOUR BATH,

322
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:47,916
ALL THE WHILE WAITING FOR YOU
TO COME HOME FROM WORK.

323
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,916
AND WHEN YOU
FINALLY RETURNED,

324
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,458
I WOULD ALWAYS SAY
"WELCOME BACK."

325
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,750
ON YOUR DAYS OFF,

326
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,750
WE WOULD SIT ON
THE LEDGE TOGETHER

327
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,041
AND SHARE THE PASTRIES
THAT I MADE THAT DAY. 

328
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,750
IF YOU WERE TIRED,

329
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,916
I WOULD MASSAGE
YOUR SHOULDERS.

330
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,583
AND IF IT WAS COLD,

331
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:09,375
I WOULD SIT UNDER
THE HEATED TABLE WITH YOU.

332
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:14,000
HOWEVER, THE DREAM
I WANTED MOST TO COME TRUE

333
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,916
WAS...

334
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,125
WAS TO BE...

335
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,250
YOUR WIFE, KAORU-SAMA.

336
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,375
KAORU-SAMA!

337
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,583
KAORU-SAMA.

338
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,875
I CAN'T POSSIBLY
IMAGINE ANY LIFE

339
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,416
THAT DOESN'T HAVE YOU.

340
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,958
I BEG YOU,

341
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,333
PLEASE ALLOW ME TO CONTINUE
STAYING BY YOUR SIDE.

342
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,166
I BEG YOU, KAORU-SAMA.

343
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:40,583
- ( sighs )

344
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,583
WHAT HAPPENED?

345
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,958
- ENGAGED?
- I ARRANGED IT ALL.

346
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,583
HE'S THE SON OF A TRADER
WHO'S DONE WELL IN AMERICA,

347
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,416
AND I APPROVE 
OF HIS FAMILY.

348
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,250
I MET HIM THE OTHER DAY.

349
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,583
HE HAD VERY GOOD MANNERS,

350
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,916
AND SEEMED TO BE
A VERY STRONG-WILLED MAN.

351
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,250
I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS
IF HE IS YOUR PARTNER.

352
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,416
YOU WILL BE MEETING HIM SOON.
- ( gasps )

353
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,250
PLEASE, SLOW DOWN
FOR A MOMENT, FATHER.

354
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:16,291
YOU'VE NEVER MENTIONED THIS
ARRANGED MARRIAGE TO ME BEFORE.

355
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,458
BESIDES WHICH I STILL
HAVE KAORU-SAMA,

356
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,166
AND HE'S ALWAYS BEEN--
- AOI!

357
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,125
IT'S TRUE THAT THIS
ARRANGED MARRIAGE

358
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,583
IS A BENEFICIAL ONE
FOR THE SAKURABA FAMILY.

359
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,583
BUT THAT WAS NOT
MY PRIMARY CONCERN.

360
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,208
YOUR HAPPINESS IS WHAT
WAS IMPORTANT TO ME.

361
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,583
- IF THAT'S TRUE,

362
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,250
IF MY HAPPINESS IS
WHAT'S TRULY IMPORTANT,

363
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,166
LET ME STAY WITH
KAORU-SAMA--

364
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,166
- ENOUGH OF THIS
CHILDISH MAKE-BELIEVE!

365
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,583
HE IS NO LONGER ONE OF
THE HANABISHI HOUSEHOLD.

366
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:44,250
HE'S MERELY AN ORDINARY BOY
WHO'S LOST THE HANABISHI CROWN.

367
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,916
HE CANNOT POSSIBLY
MAKE YOU HAPPY.

368
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,833
JUST FORGET THAT YOU
EVER KNEW THAT BOY. 

369
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,916
I'VE KEPT QUIET
ABOUT THIS FOR SOME TIME,

370
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,291
BUT THAT ENDS TODAY.

371
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,625
ALL RIGHT?

372
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,250
- NO.

373
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:01,083
I CANNOT DO THIS.

374
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,666
I CAN'T GO THROUGH
WITH THIS.

375
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,458
I WON'T SUBMIT TO
THIS ARRANGEMENT!

376
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,125
- THEN I FORBID YOU
TO LEAVE THIS HOUSE FOR NOW.

377
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,375
- PLEASE, WAIT A MOMENT.
FATHER!

378
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,166
- Miyabi: LADY AOI,

379
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,291
YOU SHOULD AT LEAST
MEET WITH THE OTHER PARTY.

380
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:23,041
- Aoi: NO.
I WILL NOT SEE HIM.

381
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:27,250
- PLEASE.  IS THERE NO WAY
TO CONVINCE YOU TO RECONSIDER?

382
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,500
LADY AOI...

383
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,250
- IF I DO
GO THROUGH WITH THIS,

384
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,750
I WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE
TO STAY AT KAORU-SAMA'S SIDE.

385
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,750
AND I WILL BE FORCED
TO MARRY SOMEONE

386
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,791
OTHER THAN THE ONE
I WANT TO MARRY.

387
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,500
HOWEVER...

388
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,916
HOWEVER,
I AM KAORU-SAMA'S WIFE!

389
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,625
- DO YOU INTEND TO FORSAKE
THE SAKURABA NAME, LADY AOI?

390
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,416
THE ONLY THING
THAT ACT WILL ACCOMPLISH

391
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,916
IS TO ANGER THE MASTER.

392
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,458
AND YOU WILL NO
LONGER BE ALLOWED

393
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,791
TO STEP FOOT IN THIS HOUSE.

394
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,375
YOU WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE
TO SEE SIR KAORU EITHER.

395
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,416
- ( gasps )

396
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,375
I UNDERSTAND.

397
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,583
BUT I HAVE ONE REQUEST
BEFORE I DO THIS.

398
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,750
I WANT TO SEE KAORU-SAMA
ONE LAST TIME.

399
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,208
- Kaoru:
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

400
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,208
- I APOLOGIZE,
KAORU-SAMA,

401
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,916
FOR KEEPING THIS QUIET.

402
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,583
I TRULY LOVE YOU
VERY MUCH.

403
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,000
BUT IT SEEMS THAT ALL I AM
EVER CAPABLE OF DOING

404
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,208
IS TROUBLING YOU.
- AOI-CHAN.

405
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:38,125
- HOWEVER, NOW THAT I'VE
SEEN YOU LIKE THIS, KAORU-SAMA,

406
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,500
I FINALLY UNDERSTAND.

407
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:42,958
I KNOW NOW THIS IS
THE PLACE WHERE I SHOULD BE.

408
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,750
AFTER ALL, I BELONG 
TO YOU AND ONLY YOU.

409
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,583
KAORU-SAMA.

410
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:49,916
( crying )

411
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,833
I DON'T WANT TO BE 
SEPARATED FROM YOU.

412
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,750
- I'LL NEVER LET YOU GO.

413
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,083
- Miyabi: I AM CERTAIN
THAT LADY AOI AND SIR KAORU

414
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,500
MUST HAVE ALREADY
DEPARTED BY NOW. 

415
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,583
MY PRINCIPLE DUTY

416
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:23,458
IS TO PRESERVE
LADY AOI'S HAPPINESS.

417
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,416
THIS IS RIGHT.

418
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,041
I SHOULD BE DOING THIS.

419
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:30,541
( gasps )

420
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,333
LADY AOI, SIR KAORU?

421
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,000
WHY ARE YOU TWO
STILL DOING HERE?

422
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,958
LADY AOI.

423
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,958
- ( end theme playing )

424
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,166
- ( singing in Japanese )

425
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:25,250
- Aoi: THE SKY IS BLUE
AS FAR AS ONE CAN SEE.

426
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:28,500
IT LINGERS ON
FOREVER AND EVER.

427
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:30,583
"AI YORI AOSHI:

428
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:33,291
I WILL ALWAYS
BE BY YOUR SIDE."
