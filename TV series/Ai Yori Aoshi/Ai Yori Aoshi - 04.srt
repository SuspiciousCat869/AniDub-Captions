- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:13,291
- LADY AOI,
WHY DID YOU DO THIS?

4
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,041
- AOI.

5
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,375

00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,958
- KAORU-SAMA?
- YEAH?

7
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,291
- LIKE YOU, I WILL PART WAYS
WITH MY FAMILY.

8
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,875
I WISH TO BE WITH YOU

9
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:45,166
EVEN IF IT MEANS THROWING
EVERYTHING AWAY.

10
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,375
SO THEREFORE, I ASK YOU

11
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,375
PLEASE ACCEPT ME,
VOWS AND ALL,

12
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,416
AND MAKE ME YOUR WIFE,
KAORU-SAMA.

13
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,041
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

14
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,583
WHAT I SAID WAS
SO OUTRAGEOUS. 

15
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:02,375
WHAT DID HE THINK THEN?

16
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:07,041
DID HE THINK THAT I WAS
A WOMAN WITH NO MORALS?

17
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,708
BUT I HAD DECIDED LONG AGO

18
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:12,375
THAT HE WOULD BE THE PERSON
I WOULD BECOME ONE WITH.

19
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,708
THAT EVERYTHING,

20
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,583
BOTH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL

21
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,708
WOULD BECOME HIS.

22
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:27,041
MY BODY, MY SOUL.

23
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,333
EVERYTHING.

24
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,041
WILL IT BE ALL RIGHT?

25
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:39,666
WILL KAORU-SAMA
BE WILLING TO ACCEPT ME?

26
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,833
( breathes deep )

27
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,375
I WILL DO MY BEST.

28
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,625
I'M TO BE HIS WIFE,
AFTER ALL.

29
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,125
KAORU-SAMA?

30
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,375

( gasps )
KAORU-SAMA?

35
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,041
KAORU-SAMA?
- HUH?

36
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,375
WHAT THE--?

37
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,708
( groans )
SORRY.

38
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,708
I GUESS I GOT
A LITTLE DIZZY.

39
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:33,333
- YOU HAVE SUCH A FEVER.
GOODNESS.

40
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,208
- I'M ALL RIGHT.
JUST LOOK.

41
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,041
I'M FINE.

42
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,250
( grunts )

43
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,083
- ( gasps )
OH NO.

44
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,958
KAORU-SAMA?  KAORU-SAMA?

45
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:43,958
- ( groans )

46
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,791
- ( water sloshes )

47
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,916
- THANKS FOR DOING THIS,
AOI-CHAN.

48
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,291
- IT IS ALL MY FAULT.

49
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,250
- HUH?

50
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,416
- FORGIVE ME.

51
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,500
IT IS BECAUSE OF ME
THAT YOU HAVE...

52
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:06,916
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

53
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,750
I FEEL AT EASE JUST
HAVING YOU AT MY SIDE, AOI-CHAN.

54
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,083
IT REALLY MAKES ME HAPPY.

55
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,666
- KAORU-SAMA.

56
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,041
I WILL WIPE
THE SWEAT OFF FOR YOU,

57
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,375
SO STAY STILL,
ALL RIGHT?

58
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,291
- HEY, I THINK I CAN
DO THAT FOR MYSELF. 

59
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,625
- THAT WON'T DO.

60
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,083
PLEASE, ALLOW ME TO DO IT,
KAORU-SAMA.

61
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,500
( gasps )

62
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,750
( gasps )

63
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,375
- ( groans )

64
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,041
SORRY.

65
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,666
I KNOW IT'S NOT A
PRETTY SIGHT TO LOOK AT.

66
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,625
HUH?

67
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,750
AOI-CHAN?

68
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,875
- I WILL TAKE EXTRA CARE

69
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:54,208
IN HEALING THESE WOUNDS
OF YOURS OVER TIME.

70
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,375
SO PLEASE...

71
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,375
ALLOW ME TO STAY
BY YOUR SIDE FOREVER.

72
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:03,625
I PROMISE THAT I WILL
NEVER LEAVE YOU.

73
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:04,625
- YEAH.

74
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,083
THANKS FOR CARING,
AOI-CHAN.

75
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,458
- ( sighs )

76
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,666
- ( labored breathing )

77
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,041
- KAORU-SAMA?

78
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,708
DO YOU FEEL COLD?

79
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,333
- YEAH, JUST A BIT.

80
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,375
- WOULD YOU MIND
LOOKING THE OTHER WAY

81
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,083
FOR JUST A SHORT
MOMENT OR TWO?

82
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,541
- SURE.

83
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,416
HUH?

84
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,708
UH-- AOI-CHAN?

85
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,041
- PLEASE DON'T, KAORU-SAMA.
- HUH?

86
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,166
- PLEASE,
DO NOT LOOK.

87
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,500
- SORRY.

88
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:56,458
- THIS IS THE MOST
THAT I CAN DO FOR YOU.

89
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,916
I HOPE THAT YOU 
FEEL WARMER NOW.

90
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,291
- YEAH.

91
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,041
I CAN FEEL HER WARMTH.

92
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,416
- I CAN HEAR HIS
HEART BEAT.

93
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:29,208
HOW ARE YOU FEELING NOW,
KAORU-SAMA?

94
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,875
- GOOD.  I'M REALLY
FEELING A LOT BETTER.

95
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,916
HUH?
- ( sighs )

96
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,125
- HUH?!

97
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,250
- YOUR FEVER HAS SUBSIDED.
ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL?

98
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,583
- WHAT A SHOCK.

99
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,375
- HMM.  IS SOMETHING
THE MATTER, KAORU-SAMA?

100
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,708
- ( stammers )

101
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,791
YOU SEE, IT'S ALL BECAUSE
YOU USED YOUR BODY TO NURSE ME.

102
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:50,958
- OH?

103
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,291
USED MY BODY?

104
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,208
- AND AFTER THAT PART,
YOU KNOW, WE BOTH FELL ASLEEP.

105
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,208
SO I THINK THAT'S WHY
MY FEVER GOT BETTER. 

106
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,666
YEAH, THAT'S IT.
( chuckles )

107
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,708
- OH, YOU.
THAT'S ENOUGH, KAORU-SAMA.

108
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,666
YOU SHOULD REST IN
THE FUTON FOR AWHILE LONGER.

109
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,375
- SHE'S SO CUTE!

110
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,250
IS THIS WHAT A HONEYMOON
FEELS LIKE?

111
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,666
- ( dishes clatter )
- HUH?

112
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,333
WHAT'S WRONG, AOI-CHAN?

113
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,291
UH...

114
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:26,875
- ( gasps )

115
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,208
- I SUSPECTED THAT
YOU WOULD BE HERE.

116
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,250
- MOTHER, WHY?

117
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,666
- THAT'S HER MOTHER?

118
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,250
- Aoi's Mother: WHAT IS
THE MEANING OF THIS, AOI?

119
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,791
TELL ME.  WHAT ON EARTH
WERE YOU THINKING?

120
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,458
DISOBEYING MIYABI

121
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,458
AND THEN NOT RETURNING HOME.

122
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,458
THAT NONSENSE ABOUT 
MARRYING A HANABISHI

123
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,416
IS TREATED AS IF
IT NEVER HAPPENED.

124
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,291
THIS BEHAVIOR IS
MOST UNLIKE YOU, AOI.

125
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,791
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO GIVE ME
A FULL EXPLANATION

126
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,833
OF WHAT WAS GOING ON
IN YOUR HEAD.

127
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:08,291
- Kaoru: AOI-CHAN.

128
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,166
- I COULD NOT--
- LADY AOI.

129
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,916
- I JUST COULD NOT BRING MYSELF
TO FORGET ABOUT KAORU-SAMA.

130
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,041
I REGRET LEAVING THE HOUSE
WITHOUT PERMISSION

131
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,375
AND WORRYING EVERYONE.

132
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,000
- THEN RETURN.
- BUT--!

133
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,000
- ( gasps )

134
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,708
- BUT I NOW KNOW
AFTER COMING HERE

135
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:27,625
THAT I HAVE LED A VERY FORTUNATE
LIFE UP UNTIL THIS POINT.

136
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:31,208
ALLOW ME TO RE-EXPRESS
MY GRATITUDE

137
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,041
TO BOTH YOU AND FATHER.

138
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,708
HOWEVER,

139
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,375
I HAVE FOUND SOMETHING
PRECIOUS HERE,

140
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,708
AND I AM NOT WILLING
TO LET IT GO.

141
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,291
- FOUND SOMETHING PRECIOUS?

142
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,583
- ( gasps )

143
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,375
- TO STAY BY HIS SIDE ALWAYS.

144
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,541
TO DO EVERYTHING
FOR HIS SAKE.

145
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,416
AND TO LIVE UNDER
THE SAME ROOF TOGETHER.

146
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,333
- MM.

147
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:11,000
- YOU SEE, I WAS ABLE
TO FIND HAPPINESS HERE

148
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,791
AS KAORU-SAMA'S
WIFE, MOTHER.

149
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,125
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
LADY AOI?

150
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,583
YOU ARE A SAKURABA--

151
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,041
- Aoi's Mother:
SHE USED TO BE SO OBEDIENT,

152
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,041
SO DELICATE.

153
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,041
- OH, LADY AOI.

154
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,041
- LET US GO HOME,
MIYABI.

155
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,375
- BUT MADAME.
- AOI, YOU WILL TOO.

156
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,250
- MOTHER, I SAID THAT I--

157
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,916
- WON'T YOU EVENTUALLY
BECOME INCONVENIENCED 

158
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,291
AS YOU ARE NOW?

159
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,250
YOU SHOULD RETURN HOME FIRST
AND MAKE PREPARATIONS.

160
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:05,041
YOU CAN BEGIN YOUR NEW
LIFE PROPERLY IN THAT WAY.

161
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,791
I WILL DISCUSS THIS
WITH YOUR FATHER

162
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,125
ON YOUR BEHALF.

163
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,416
SO PLEASE DON'T WORRY.

164
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,125
- MOTHER,
THEN YOU MEAN THAT--

165
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,041
- AOI,

166
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,750
YOU HAVE BECOME AN ADULT
TO MY SURPRISE.

167
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,666
- ( gasps )
MOTHER.

168
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,583
( crying )

169
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,291
- Aoi: KAORU-SAMA?

170
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,375
I'VE RETURNED,
KAORU-SAMA.

171
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,875
- AOI-CHAN.

172
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:50,916
WELCOME BACK.

173
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,041
- ( both chuckle )

174
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,083
- ( giggles )

175
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,041
- WHAT IS IT?

176
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,875
IS THERE SOMETHING
ON MY FACE?

177
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,041
- IT'S JUST THAT I'VE NOT BEEN
ABLE TO SEE YOUR FACE IN AWHILE.

178
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:15,333
- OH, YEAH.
- ( giggles )

179
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,708
KAORU-SAMA?

180
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,291
FINALLY WE CAN BE TOGETHER.

181
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,833
- YEAH.

182
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,833
BUT WE'RE GONNA BE SHARING
SOME PRETTY CRAMPED QUARTERS,

183
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,583
SO THINGS MIGHT BE
A LITTLE TOUGH.

184
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:24,916
- NOT AT ALL.

185
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,791
AFTER ALL,
YOU WILL BE WITH ME.

186
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,541
THAT BY ITSELF IS ENOUGH.

187
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,208
- ( stammers )

188
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,333
( screams )

189
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,750
EVERYTHING'S GONE!

190
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,916
HOW?!

191
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,583
- KAORU-SAMA?

192
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,041
WHAT IN THE WORLD?

193
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,708
- Miyabi: I HAVE BEEN
WAITING FOR YOU.

194
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:49,000
- HMM?

195
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:51,958
- Kaoru and Aoi:
MISS MIYABI?

196
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,375
- THIS IS ONE OF THE SAKURABA
FAMILY'S SUMMER HOMES.

197
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:05,375
IT HAS NOT BEEN USED 
IN QUITE A LONG TIME,

198
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,125
BUT YOU WILL NOW BE
USING THIS MANSION

199
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,500
AS YOUR NEW HOME AS OF TODAY.

200
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:10,708
- WOW.

201
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,041
- WHAT A SPLENDID
WESTERN STYLE MANSION.

202
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,041
- Miyabi: I AM PLEASED
YOU FIND IT CHARMING. 

203
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,791
- I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED
TO LIVE IN A MANSION LIKE THIS

204
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,375
AT LEAST ONCE IN MY LIFE.

205
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,291
- THIS IS PRETTY EXCITING, HUH?

206
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,708
- ( clears throat )

207
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,833
IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
YOUR BELONGINGS, SIR KAORU,

208
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,041
THEY HAVE BEEN
PLACED OVER THERE.

209
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,375
- OVER THERE?

210
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,375
AM I REALLY SUPPOSED
TO LIVE THERE?

211
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,541
- I ASK THAT YOU BEAR WITH
THE ODDS AND ENDS.

212
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:42,458
THIS WILL PREVENT
A SAKURABA SCANDAL.

213
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,208
- PREVENT A SCANDAL?
- YES.

214
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,541
IF THE HEIR WERE SOMEONE
BANISHED FROM THE HANABISHI CLAN

215
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,708
WITH NO TIES LEFT
TO THE SAKURABA FAMILY,

216
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,750
THERE WILL SURELY BE
THOSE OPPOSED TO IT.

217
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,916
THE SAKURABA GROUP WOULD
BE TORN APART BY DISSENT.

218
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
TO ENSURE THAT
THE OUTSIDE WORLD

219
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,125
DOES NOT DISCOVER THIS,
YOU MUST BE CAREFUL

220
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,416
TO AVOID INAPPROPRIATE
BEHAVIOR.

221
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,750
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

222
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,375
- I GUESS WE HAVE NO CHOICE
IF THAT'S HOW IT IS.

223
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,583
- ALSO, I WILL BE PERSONALLY
TAKING CARE OF

224
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,708
ALL THE MUNDANE ASPECTS
OF YOUR LIVES.

225
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,041
- OH, SO THEN...

226
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,958
- YOU'RE GONNA LIVE HERE TOO?

227
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,041
- I SAID YOU COULD LIVE
WITH LADY AOI,

228
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,666
BUT I NEVER SAID THAT
YOU TWO WOULD BE HERE ALONE!

229
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,833
- I GUESS THAT'S TRUE.

230
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,000
- IN ANY CASE,

231
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,875
IT IS IMPORTANT
THAT BOTH OF YOU FOLLOW

232
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,791
MY EVERY WORD 
TO THE LETTER.

233
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,041
IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?

234
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,708
- UH, YES.
( sighs ) 

235
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:36,041
Kaoru: THIS IS A LOT DIFFERENT
THAN THE LIFE I EXPECTED.

236
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,458
- WELL, SHALL WE BEGIN?

237
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,458
MOVING INTO OUR NEW HOME,
THAT IS.

238
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,041
NO TIME TO WASTE.

239
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,208
RIGHT, KAORU-SAMA?

240
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,250
- YEAH, I GUESS NOT.
WELL, FIRST--

241
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,583
( grunts )

242
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,500
- SIR KAORU, YOU WILL HAVE
OTHER DUTIES TO FULFILL.

243
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,875
- WHAT?
HEY, HOLD ON.

244
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,375
JUST A MINUTE,
MISS MIYABI!

245
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,666
- OH.

246
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,625
- ( panting )

247
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,500
- I WOULD LIKE YOU
TO CLEAN EVERY CORNER

248
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,375
OF THE LIVING ROOM FLOOR.

249
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:10,708
- ( screams )

250
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:11,791
( grunts )

251
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:12,916
- MY MY MY.

252
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,916
HARD TO REACH PLACES
SUCH AS THAT

253
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,875
REQUIRE A MAN'S TOUCH.

254
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,000
- ( grunts )

255
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,875
( yelps )
I'M GONNA FALL!

256
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,458
- TRY TO BE CAREFUL.
- HELP ME!

257
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,666
YOU WANT ME TO 
MOVE ALL THESE?

258
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,750
- WHEN YOU LEAVE
A HOUSE UNATTENDED,

259
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,583
IT IS AMAZING
HOW MUCH FURNITURE

260
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,375
LIES AROUND COLLECTING DUST.

261
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,000
- ( grunting )

262
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,708
- MY.

263
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,458
IF THAT IS THE EXTENT
OF YOUR STRENGTH,

264
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,041
WHAT WILL YOU DO IF SOMETHING
SHOULD HAPPEN TO LADY AOI?

265
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,208
- ( grunts )

266
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,791
HEAVE HO!

267
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,166
- Miyabi:
WHAT AN IDIOT.

268
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,041
TO THINK THAT LADY AOI
WOULD CHOOSE HIM.

269
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,458
I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THIS.

270
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,375
- ( sighs )
IT'S HOT.

271
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,041
- ( gasps )
- HUH?

272
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,583
WHAT'S WRONG, MISS MIYABI?

273
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,000
- ( gasps )
- YOUR FACE IS RED.

274
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,041
DID YOU CATCH A COLD?

275
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,000
- IT'S NOTHING AT ALL.

276
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:11,625
( gasps )

277
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,958
- BE CAREFUL.

278
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,875
- ( gasps )

279
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,500
( stammers )

280
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:21,500
YOU-- YOU...

281
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:22,833
ANIMAL!

282
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,125
- ( Kaoru screams )

283
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:30,250
WHY DID IT END UP
LIKE THIS?

284
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,583
I HAVEN'T EVEN
STRAIGHTENED OUT MY OWN ROOM.

285
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,625
( sighs )

286
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,791
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
THE FIRST DAY OF MY NEW LIFE.

287
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,791
HMM?
- OH?

288
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,041
KAORU-SAMA,
I'M NEARLY DONE MAKING

289
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,208
THE APPROPRIATE
ARRANGEMENTS TO YOUR ROOM.

290
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,541
- IT'S ALL RIGHT,
AOI-CHAN.

291
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:48,958
I CAN DO THE REST MYSELF.

292
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,666
- PLEASE, I CAN HANDLE IT.

293
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,458
IT'S NOT MUCH-- OH.

294
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,916
( giggles )

295
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,125
- HMM?

296
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,708
- I HAVE ALWAYS DREAMT
OF THIS VERY MOMENT.

297
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:03,041
I'M SO HAPPY THAT THINGS
ARE EXACTLY AS I DREAMT.

298
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,041
- A DREAM?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

299
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,708
HAVING A PLACE THAT
WE COULD CLEAN TOGETHER.

300
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,083
GOING SHOPPING WITH YOU,

301
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,083
HAVING YOU HELP ME COOK.

302
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,041
THE TWO OF US TOGETHER,

303
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:16,041
TAKING ONE THING AT A TIME
FROM NOTHING.

304
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,208
THAT IS HOW YOU CREATE
A NEW LIFESTYLE,

305
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,958
ISN'T THAT CORRECT?

306
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,958
- YEAH, AOI-CHAN.

307
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,958
THAT'S RIGHT.

308
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,958
LET'S BUILD OUR
NEW LIVES TOGETHER

309
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,291
STARTING NOW.

310
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,958
- KAORU-SAMA.

311
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,708
- Miyabi: HAVE I BEEN TOO HARSH
THESE PAST FEW DAYS

312
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:45,916
ON LADY AOI?

313
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,416
IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN WITH
HER BEST INTEREST IN MIND.

314
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,708
HOWEVER,

315
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:57,125
I HAVE NEVER SEEN HER 
SMILE SO FULL OF LIFE.

316
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:02,375
THE KAORU HANABISHI.

317
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,708
- ( clatters )

318
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,375
( gasps )

319
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,875
( gasps )

320
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,833
( yelps )

321
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,791
( screams )

322
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,083
- ( grunts )

323
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,583
- MISS MIYABI.

324
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:22,916
- OH, LADY AOI,

325
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,583
I APOLOGIZE FOR MAKING
SUCH AN OBSCENE NOISE.

326
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,041
- ( rustling )
- ( Aoi and Miyabi gasp )

327
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:30,000
- WHAT WAS THAT JUST NOW?

328
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,208
- ( chuckles )
COULD SOMETHING BE BACK THERE?

329
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,041
- SOMETHING AS IN
A BURGLAR OR...

330
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:38,041
- PERHAPS A GHOST 
OR EVEN A PHANTOM.

331
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,708
- NO WAY.

332
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:40,875
- ( clatters )
- ( all gasp )

333
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,166
- ( whimpering )

334
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:45,750
- HMM.

335
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,541
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
KAORU-SAMA?

336
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,375
- I'M JUST GONNA
TAKE A LOOK.

337
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,250
EVERYTHING WILL BE
ALL RIGHT.

338
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,708
- KAORU-SAMA.

339
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,291
- ( gasps )

340
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,708
- JUST LEAVE IT TO ME.

341
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,458
- OH, SIR KAORU.

342
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,750
- ( exhales )

343
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,375
- ( clattering )

344
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,041
- ( Kaoru grunts )
- KAORU-SAMA?

345
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,750
- SIR KAORU?

346
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:19,750
- ( both gasp )

347
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,708
- A CAT?

348
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,083
- YEP.

349
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,708
WE FOUND OUR BURGLAR,
GHOST, AND PHANTOM.

350
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,750
LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN LIVING HERE
A LOT LONGER THAN US.

351
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,416
MAYBE IT DECIDED 
TO HIDE BACK HERE

352
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
AFTER ALL THE LOUD NOISE
WE'VE BEEN MAKING TODAY.

353
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,208
- SO THAT'S WHAT
THE NOISE WAS.

354
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,541
- TO THINK I WAS SCREAMING
OVER AN ORDINARY CAT.

355
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,916
HOW UTTERLY EMBARRASSING.

356
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,958
( gasps )

357
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,458
OHH.

358
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:51,291
- UM, MISS MIYABI?
- HUH?

359
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,708
- ( stammers )
- ( gasps )

360
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,208
- ( exhales )

361
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,708
- ( clears throat )

362
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,166
- ( chuckles )

363
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,500
- ( sighs )

364
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,916
WELL THEN, I SUPPOSE THAT WE
SHOULD HAVE OUR SUPPER SOON,

365
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,041
LADY AOI.

366
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,791
ALONG WITH SIR KAORU TOO,
OF COURSE.

367
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,708
- ( both chuckle )

368
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,666
- Kaoru and Aoi:
SURE!

369
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:37,583
- WAIT, MISS MIYABI!
WHY ARE YOU LOCKING ME OUT?

370
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,916
- I FORBID YOU FROM
ENTERING THIS BUILDING

371
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,041
AFTER 10:00, SIR KAORU.
- WHAT?

372
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,041
- YOU WILL NOT QUESTION
THIS DECISION!

373
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,125
UNDERSTOOD?!

374
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,791
- ( sighs )

375
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:52,083
NOTHING'S CHANGED FROM
WHEN I WAS LIVING ALONE.

376
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:58,500
HUH?

377
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,541
AOI-CHAN?
- HMM?

378
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:08,500
LOOKS LIKE HE'S GONNA BE LIVING
WITH US FROM NOW ON AS WELL.

379
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,041
PLEASED TO MEET YOU,
MR. CAT.

380
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,458
- ( meows )

381
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,416
- ( giggles )
ADORABLE.

382
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,208
- THAT'S TRUE.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

383
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,041
- ( hisses )

384
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,291
- THIS THING IS 
DEFINITELY MALE.

385
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:23,708
- KAORU-SAMA?

386
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:24,750
- HUH?

387
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,083
- ONCE AGAIN...

388
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,708
I AM NOT PERFECT,

389
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:32,041
BUT I HOPE YOU WILL
LEARN TO ACCEPT ME.

390
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,041
- AND THE SAME GOES
FOR ME TOO.

391
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,541
( chuckles )

392
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:41,041
- ( sighs )

393
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,041
- ( theme music playing )

394
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,250
- ( singing in Japanese )

395
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:23,375
- HI, I'M TINA FOSTER.

396
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:25,458
BORN IN AMERICA,
GREW UP IN HAKATA,

397
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,958
AND CAME BACK FROM
THE AMAZON!

398
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:31,375
- Aoi: AI YORI AOSHI,
"OLD FRIEND."

399
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:34,375
- Tina: I'M NOT PERFECT,
BUT NICE TO MEET YOU!

400
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:35,625
- Aoi: UH, YES.
