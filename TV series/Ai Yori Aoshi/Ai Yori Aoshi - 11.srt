1
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:34,125
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:05,583
- WHAT?  TINA'S ALREADY
LEFT FOR SCHOOL?

4
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,250
- YES. SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD
TO GO BORROW SOMETHING

5
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,250
FROM A FRIEND FOR THE EXHIBIT.

6
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,750
MISS TAEKO ACCOMPANIED HER
AS WELL.

7
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,666
- SOMETHING FOR
THE PHOTO EXHIBIT, HUH?

8
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,250
I WONDER WHAT THOSE TWO
ARE UP TO.

9
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,750
- SOME OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS
THAT WILL BE ON DISPLAY THERE

10
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,416
ARE THE ONES THAT
YOU'VE TAKEN, RIGHT?

11
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,583
I'D LOVE TO SEE.
- ( chuckles )

12
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,750
IT'S NOT LIKE
THEY'RE ANYTHING SPECIAL.

13
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,916
AFTER ALL, I ONLY
TOOK THEM YESTERDAY

14
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,083
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE
ENOUGH PIECES.

15
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,625
- OH.  JUST A MOMENT.

16
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:33,625
- UH--

17
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:34,791
- ( heart beats )

18
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,416
- UH--

19
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,416
- THAT'S MUCH BETTER.

20
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,916
- WELL, I GUESS I'LL BE
GOING NOW.

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,041
- PLEASE TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

22
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,375
( gasps )
KAORU-SAMA?

23
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,541
EXCUSE ME.

24
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,416
- WHAT IS IT?

25
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,583
- IT'S, UM--
IT'S NOTHING, REALLY.

26
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,500
I'M SORRY TO HAVE BOTHERED YOU.

27
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,791
BE CAREFUL ON YOUR WAY
TO THE UNIVERSITY.

28
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,000
- SURE.
SEE YOU LATER THEN.

29
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,416
- ( deeply sighs )

30
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,750
I REALLY AM HOPELESS.

31
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,250
KAORU-SAMA...

32
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,250
- WE HAVE JUST ARRIVED, MADAME.

33
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,375
- MUST IT BE THIS UNIVERSITY
OF ALL PLACES?

34
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,666
- IT IS YOUR FATHER'S BIDDING.

35
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,000
- HIS BIDDING.

36
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,833
HOW LONG DOES MY FATHER INTEND

37
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,166
ON TREATING ME LIKE
A LITTLE CHILD?

38
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,166
- ( girls chattering, laughing )

39
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,625
- ( sighs )

40
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,708
- Tina: ALL RIGHT, TAE,
LET'S DO IT!

41
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,208
- ARE WE REALLY GOING
TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS, SENPAI?

42
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,041
- IT'S FOR THE PHOTO CLUB!

43
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,041
- ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DO IT!

44
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,250
- ( all gasp )

45
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,416
- COME ON OVER, FOLKS,
AND GATHER AROUND!

46
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,375
- YOU CAN'T MISS THIS EXHIBIT.

47
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,541
- YEAH, THIS SUMMER'S
PHOTO CLUB EXHIBIT IS ONE

48
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:00,833
THAT YOU'VE GOTTA SEE.

49
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,833
- PLEASE FEEL FREE TO
COME ON IN, EVERYONE.

50
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:07,083
- Both:
WELCOME TO THE EXHIBIT, BOYS.

51
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,291
- ( horn honking )

52
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,625
- HOW ANNOYING.

53
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:16,291
THESE MEN HERE-- WHAT DO YOU
SUPPOSE THEY'RE ALL GAWKING AT?

54
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:19,250
- I BELIEVE THEY DON'T
SEE CARS LIKE THIS OFTEN.

55
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,833
- WHICH IS PRECISELY WHY
I HATE JAPANESE MEN.

56
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,250
SO SIMPLE AND SUPERFICIAL.

57
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,250
THEY LACK ALL SIGNS
OF INTELLIGENCE.

58
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,583
I REALLY LONG FOR
THOSE DAYS IN ENGLAND.

59
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,083
- ( crowd clamoring )

60
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:33,166
- HUH?  DID SOMETHING
HAPPEN OVER THERE?

61
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,958
- THIS IS PERFECT.
SHALL WE GO?

62
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:35,958
- YES, MADAME.

63
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,541
- FILTHY RABBLE.
HONESTLY.

64
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,250
- I'VE GOT TWO PEOPLE
COMING IN!

65
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,916
- AND HERE'S ANOTHER ONE.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,916
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW,
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE A HIT.

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,666
- YEAH.  BUT I CAN'T SAY
I'M HAPPY ABOUT THIS.

68
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,833
- NOBODY'S EVEN TAKING
 A LOOK AT THE PHOTOS.

69
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:07,541
- THEY'RE TREATING IT
LIKE IT'S JUST SOME WALKWAY.

70
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,041
- ( sighs )

71
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,375
THE FASHIONS AROUND HERE
ARE SO TACKY.

72
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,416
HAVE THE STUDENTS
NO SHAME HERE?

73
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,291
- THE PHOTO CLUB EXHIBIT IS
RIGHT HERE!

74
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,291
AAH!

75
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,458
- ( grunts )

76
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:20,583
- ARE YOU INJURED, MADAME?

77
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:21,708
- MY BAD!

78
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,708
- HUH?

79
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,708
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.
YOU OKAY?

80
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,875
I DIDN'T LOOK
WHERE I WAS GOING.

81
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,375
OH.
- TWIT!

82
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,166
WATCH WHERE YOU STEP.
- HUH?

83
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,958
- WHAT ON EARTH
WERE YOU THINKING?

84
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:35,041
THIS IS NOT
THE GRAND PRIX, OAF!

85
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,458
- TINA SENPAI.

86
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,583
- OH.  UH, WELL, UM...

87
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,416
NICE TO MEET YOU.
HOW DO YOU DO?

88
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,083
- OH!

89
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,708
- SENPAI...

90
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,375
- SORRY, I DIDN'T
KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

91
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,875
I'M NO GOOD AT TALKING
TO FOREIGNERS, YOU KNOW?

92
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,750
- ARE YOU REALLY SURE
YOU'RE AN AMERICAN, SENPAI?

93
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,666
- ( chuckles )
I GUESS SO.

94
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,250
- HONESTLY,

95
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,500
THIS IS PRECISELY WHY AMERICANS
ARE SO BOORISH AND ILL-MANNERED.

96
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:00,916
- WHAT'S THAT?!

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,750
CARE TO SAY THAT AGAIN,
LITTLE MISS ENGLISH PRINCESS?!

98
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,625
- CALM DOWN, SENPAI.

99
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,083
- YOU HEAR ME? I SAID
CARE TO SAY THAT AGAIN?!

100
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,291
- GLADLY.  YOU'RE BOORISH
AND ILL-MANNERED.

101
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,250
- OKAY!
THAT'S THE LAST STRAW, KID!

102
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,708
- ( both growling )

103
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,541
- MADAME, PLEASE.
- SENPAI.

104
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,250
- STAY BACK, TAE!
- STAY BACK, SAIONJI!

105
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,208
- OH, WHAT SHOULD I DO?

106
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,083
I NEED HELP.  OH.

107
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:24,416
SENPAI!
HANABISHI SENPAI!

108
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,708
- UH....
- HUH?

109
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,625
HANABISHI...

110
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,208
- HEY, WHAT'S UP, YOU GUYS?

111
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,375
AND WHAT'S WITH THOSE WILD
OUTFITS YOU'RE WEARING TODAY?

112
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,583
- KAORU, JUST LISTEN, OKAY?!

113
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:39,416
- KAORU?  KAORU.
HANABISHI.

114
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,625
HANABISHI-SAMA!

115
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:41,916
- Both: HUH?

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,250
- HANABISHI-SAMA!

117
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,416
- ( both scream )

118
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,916
- ( crowd murmuring )
- ( fireworks cracking )

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,416
- ( both gasp )

120
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,083
- HANABISHI-SAMA.

121
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,458
- WHAT THE HECK?

122
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,250
- TO THINK THAT YOU ARE
A STUDENT HERE

123
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,875
AT THIS UNIVERSITY.

124
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,708
WE MUST BE TIED TOGETHER
BY THE RED STRING OF FATE.

125
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,375
THIS CAN'T BE A COINCIDENCE.

126
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,916
MAYU IS SO TOUCHED
BY THE PROSPECT.

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,708
- MAYU?

128
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,125
- HOLD YOUR HORSES THERE!

129
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,791
- OH, YOU'RE STILL HERE,
I SEE.

130
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,791
- DAMN RIGHT.
JUST WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE,

131
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,791
COMING OUT OF NOWHERE,
DOING THAT TO KAORU?

132
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,791
- WHAT ARE YOU REFERRING TO?

133
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,375
OH, YOU MEAN THE KISS.

134
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,500
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

135
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,458
- IT WAS MERELY A GREETING,
OF COURSE.

136
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:27,333
I WOULD THINK THAT YOU PRACTICE
THE SAME CUSTOM YOURSELF

137
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,333
AS AN AMERICAN.

138
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:29,500
- HUH?!  ME?!

139
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,041
KISSING KAORU ON THE MOUTH?!

140
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,500
AAH!

141
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:44,916
( panting )
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?

142
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,250
YOUR FACE IS COMPLETELY RED.

143
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,791
- SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

144
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,125
HMM!
- FIRST OF ALL,

145
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:54,458
WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH HIM?

146
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,458
- WELL, ME AND HIM...

147
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,500
UH, WELL, IT'S KINDA
LIKE THIS, YOU SEE--

148
00:07:58,583 --> 00:07:59,916
ME AND KAORU, UM--

149
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,416
- YOU AND HE ARE WHAT?!

150
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,250
- UM, I'M HIS...

151
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,833
I'M KAORU'S--
- HEY, COULD IT BE

152
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,583
THAT YOU'RE MAYU MIYUKI?

153
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,583
- THAT'S RIGHT!
I'M MAYU!

154
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,750
HANABISHI-SAMA.
- OH, WOW!

155
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,583
YOU'VE REALLY GROWN UP, HUH?

156
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,708
I ALMOST DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU.

157
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,666
- I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN AGES.

158
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,333
- YEAH, IT'S SURE BEEN
A WHILE.

159
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,541
HOW MANY YEARS WAS IT?

160
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,791
- ( giggles )
FOUR YEARS.

161
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,250
- WOW, FOUR WHOLE YEARS, HUH?

162
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,791
SO THAT MEANS YOU'RE,
WHAT, 16 ALREADY?

163
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,500
AND YOU SEEM
MORE MATURE NOW TOO.

164
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,958
- YOU REALLY THINK SO?

165
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,416
IT MUST HAVE TO DO WITH MY TIME
LIVING IN ENGLAND.

166
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,875
- IN ENGLAND?

167
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,375
OH, SO THAT'S WHY
SHE GREETED ME LIKE THAT.

168
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,166
- YOU'VE CHANGED A LITTLE BIT
YOURSELF, HANABISHI-SAMA.

169
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,333
- HAVE I?

170
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,333
- YOU'VE BECOME
A MORE WONDERFUL PERSON.

171
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,750
- ( chuckles )
WELL, THANKS FOR SAYING SO.

172
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,208
- HMM!

173
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:52,208
- LOOKS LIKE WE CAN'T GET
 A WORD IN EDGEWISE, HUH?

174
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,541
OH, YEAH, SENPAI?
WHAT WAS IT YOU WERE

175
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,083
TRYING TO SAY BEFORE...
- ( sighs )

176
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,208
- ...ABOUT HANABISHI SENPAI?

177
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,208
- IT WAS NOTHING AT ALL!

178
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,333
- HMM!

179
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,250
COME HERE A SEC.
- HUH?  AAH.

180
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,333
- MOVE YOUR BUTT.

181
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,833
THAT GIRL--
YOU KNOW HER, RIGHT?

182
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,041
- YEAH, SORT OF.

183
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,916
OH, DID MAYU
SAY SOMETHING TO YOU?

184
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,583
SORRY.
FORGIVE HER, WILL YOU?

185
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,041
SHE'S A LITTLE STUBBORN.

186
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,875
BUT SHE IS
A GOOD GIRL DEEP DOWN.

187
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,666
- WELL, I DON'T SEE
HOW SHE CAN BE.

188
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,666
- MAYU-CHAN.

189
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,500
- YES?

190
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,833
- SOMETHING YOU SAID
UPSET PEOPLE AGAIN, HUH?

191
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,416
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

192
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,916
- BUT IT WAS TRUE.

193
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,625
- EVEN SO, COME ON NOW.

194
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,500
YOU'D BETTER APOLOGIZE.

195
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,041
HEH.

196
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,500
- OKAY.

197
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,625
I SAID TOO MUCH EARLIER.

198
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,916
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

199
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,500
- OH, SURE.

200
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,125
WELL, I GUESS I DID BUMP INTO
YOU AND ALL IN THE FIRST PLACE.

201
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,750
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

202
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,500
- THANKS FOR UNDERSTANDING,
TINA.

203
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,166
IT'S A GOOD THING
THAT SHE FORGAVE YOU.

204
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,166
- YES!
HANABISHI-SAMA!

205
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,750
- NOT SO TIGHT.
( chuckles )

206
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,458
- SHE SEEMS SO INNOCENT NOW.

207
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,125
RIGHT, TINA SENPAI?

208
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,083
HUH?
IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?

209
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,416
- IT'S NOTHING, TAE.

210
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,375
- OH, MY!

211
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,166
YOU TOOK EVERY SINGLE
PHOTOGRAPH, HANABISHI-SAMA.

212
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,666
THEY'RE WONDERFUL.
- ( giggles )

213
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,833
THANKS A LOT.

214
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,750
- ( mockingly )
THEY'RE WONDERFUL.

215
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:12,916
( normal voice )
YEAH, RIGHT.

216
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,625
- THOSE ARE THE PICTURES
HE TOOK YESTERDAY

217
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,458
IN JUST AN HOUR,
SO HE COULD HAVE ENOUGH PIECES

218
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,000
FOR THE EXHIBIT.

219
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,791
- AND THEY'RE CHEAP FIVE-YEN
SERVICE PRINTS TOO.

220
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,125
- ( bell dings )

221
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,208
- WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A LOOK
AT THE OTHER PHOTOS?

222
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,500
THEY'RE REALLY A LOT BETTER
THAN THE ONES I TOOK.

223
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,916
- I'M NOT PARTICULARLY
INTERESTED IN THE OTHERS.

224
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,083
CHANGING SUBJECTS,
HANABISHI-SAMA?

225
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,583
COULD YOU PLEASE GIVE ME
A TOUR OF THE CAMPUS?

226
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,625
- SURE.

227
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:35,791
I CAN SHOW YOU AROUND
IF YOU WANT.

228
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,625
OH, AND I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO ASK YOU

229
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,125
WHAT YOU'RE HERE FOR,
MAYU-CHAN.

230
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,291
- TO GET ACQUAINTED,
OF COURSE!

231
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,625
- ACQUAINTED?

232
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,250
- RIGHT!  MAYU IS NOW
A STUDENT OF THIS COLLEGE.

233
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,208
- OHH, SO YOU GOT ACCEPTED,
HUH?

234
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:48,916
WAIT!  A STUDENT?!

235
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,375
- THAT'S RIGHT.

236
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:06,000
- SO THAT'S IT--
YOU SKIPPED GRADES.

237
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,958
- YES.  IN ENGLAND
I SKIPPED TWO GRADES

238
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,291
DURING MIDDLE AND HIGH
SCHOOLS, AND WAS ACCEPTED IN

239
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:13,125
THE RETURNING FROM OVERSEAS
PROGRAM OF THIS UNIVERSITY.

240
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,750
- WOW, THAT'S AMAZING.

241
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,083
- I STUDIED A GREAT DEAL

242
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,708
BECAUSE I WISHED TO RETURN
TO JAPAN QUICKLY.

243
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,291
- YEAH?

244
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,625
SO, I TAKE IT YOU DIDN'T REALLY
LIKE ENGLAND ALL THAT MUCH.

245
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,125
- NOT AT ALL.
I LOVED BEING THERE.

246
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:30,583
IT WAS SO SCENIC AND TIME SEEMED
TO PASS BY SO LAZILY EVERY DAY.

247
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,291
- WHAT?  THEN WHY IS IT
THAT YOU WERE IN SUCH A HURRY

248
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,833
TO RETURN TO JAPAN?

249
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,083
- BECAUSE...

250
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:41,833
BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING HERE
THAT DOESN'T EXIST IN ENGLAND!

251
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:45,000
- SOMETHING HERE IN JAPAN THAT
JUST DOESN'T EXIST IN ENGLAND.

252
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,208
IS THAT SO?

253
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:49,000
- IT CERTAINLY IS.
( giggles )

254
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,000
- THAT'S ABOUT IT
FOR THE CAMPUS.

255
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,833
- THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR THE TOUR.

256
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:57,125
I BELIEVE THAT I CAN FIND
MY WAY AROUND CAMPUS NOW.

257
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,375
- IT WAS MY PLEASURE,
MAYU-CHAN.

258
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,208
SO WHEN WILL YOU
BE STARTING CLASS?

259
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,166
- NEXT WEEK
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN.

260
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,166
- I SEE.  FEEL FREE TO
DROP BY THE PHOTO CLUB

261
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,166
WHENEVER YOU'RE HERE.

262
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,166
- I WILL.

263
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,333
UH...

264
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:13,666
ARE YOU TERRIBLY BUSY
RIGHT NOW, HANABISHI-SAMA?

265
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,083
- HUH?  NO, NOT REALLY.

266
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,625
- THEN, IF THAT'S THE CASE,

267
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,083
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN
VISITING MY HOME RIGHT NOW?

268
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,208
AND PERHAPS HAVING
SOME DINNER WITH ME?

269
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,625
IT'S JUST,

270
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,708
THERE'S SO MANY THINGS I'D
LIKE TO DISCUSS WITH YOU.

271
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,875
- HMM.  I COULD.

272
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,208
BUT I REALLY SHOULD STAY
AT THE PHOTO EXHIBIT,

273
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,791
EVEN IF IT IS BORING.

274
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,458
AND BESIDES...

275
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,583
I COULDN'T STAY
FOR DINNER ANYWAY.

276
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,708
UH--

277
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,250
- YES YES, I UNDERSTAND.

278
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,625
SO THEN I CAN COOK
A LITTLE LESS TODAY,

279
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,125
AS YOU'LL BE DINING OUT.

280
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,125
- YEAH, IT'S 'CAUSE I RAN
INTO AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE.

281
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,041
YEAH, I TOLD TINA
AND TAEKO-CHAN ALREADY.

282
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:59,166
OH, AND I THINK I'LL BE
COMING HOME A LITTLE LATE TOO.

283
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,166
YEAH.  SEE YOU.

284
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,791
UH--

285
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,458
- DITCHING US, HUH? YOU'LL
HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE THEN.

286
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,416
- AND THAT MEANS YOU'RE
GONNA BE CLEANING UP

287
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,916
ON THE LAST DAY ALL ALONE.

288
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,250
- UH, YEAH, I KNOW.

289
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,291
- HMM!

290
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,208
- UH...

291
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,416
- THANK YOU
FOR WHAT YOU DID EARLIER.

292
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,500
- OH, SURE.

293
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,041
- OH, I'VE YET
TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

294
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,541
I AM IN CHARGE OF
TAKING CARE OF MAYU-SAMA.

295
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,416
MY NAME IS RUKA SAIONJI.

296
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,625
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

297
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,583
- THE CAR IS OVER THERE.

298
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,875
- ( footsteps )

299
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,541
- BY THE WAY,
I WAS QUITE SURPRISED BEFORE.

300
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,208
TO THINK THERE WAS
ANOTHER PERSON

301
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,041
WHO MAYU-SAMA
HAD OPENED HER HEART TO

302
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,541
OTHER THAN HER PARENTS.

303
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:51,708
- I SEE.

304
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,375
SHE MAY BE A BIT
MORE MATURE NOW,

305
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:57,083
BUT SHE REALLY HASN'T CHANGED
MUCH IN THESE FOUR YEARS.

306
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,583
- YOU SEE, MAYU-SAMA IS
A YOUNG LADY

307
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,083
WHO IS PERPETUALLY LONELY.

308
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:04,958
HANABISHI-SAMA,
PLEASE TRY TO HELP HER.

309
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,833
- RIGHT HERE,
HANABISHI-SAMA!

310
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,916
- SURE.  I'LL DO
 WHATEVER I CAN.

311
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,833
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

312
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,791
- ( giggles )

313
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,291
THEY'RE SO HORRIBLE,
BOTH OF THEM.

314
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,291
MY MOTHER AND FATHER
NEVER CHANGE.

315
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,791
DURING SOCIAL EVENTS
OR NEGOTIATIONS,

316
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,583
KNOWING ENGLISH IS
A NECESSITY,

317
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,500
SO THEY DECIDED I WOULD
STUDY ABROAD WITHOUT TELLING ME.

318
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,375
AND AFTER I GRADUATED,
THEY CHOSE MY COLLEGE TOO.

319
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:36,208
NEITHER ONE OF THEM EVEN TRIES
TO CONSIDER MY FEELINGS,

320
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,583
MUCH LESS UNDERSTAND THEM.

321
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,083
IT'S HORRIBLE,
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?!

322
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,083
- YOUR MOTHER AND FATHER
DID ALL THAT

323
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,833
BECAUSE THEY CARE ABOUT YOU
AND WANT THE BEST FOR YOU. 

324
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,208
- EXCEPT THAT MAYU IS
NO LONGER A CHILD.

325
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,458
I'M CAPABLE OF
DECIDING THINGS MYSELF.

326
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,083
- SO I TAKE IT THAT
BOTH YOUR PARENTS

327
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,833
ARE STILL
AS BUSY AS ALWAYS.

328
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,791
- BOTH OF THEM ARE
CHRONIC WORKAHOLICS.

329
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,541
- MIYUKI TRADING IS
CONSTANTLY FIGHTING

330
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,833
TO BE THE TOP TRADING COMPANY
IN THE WORLD.

331
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,916
IT CAN'T BE HELPED.

332
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,458
WHERE'S YOUR FATHER NOW?

333
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,791
- HE'S IN FRANCE.

334
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,500
- AND YOUR MOTHER?

335
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,166
- SHE'S IN FINLAND.

336
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,166
SHE WAS SUMMONED THERE
BY THE ROYAL FAMILY

337
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,250
TO MAKE A NEW DRESS
FOR THE QUEEN.

338
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,166
- WHEN WILL THEY BE
COMING BACK?

339
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,000
- HMM.  WHO KNOWS?

340
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,000
ALL THEY DO IS LECTURE ME
WHEN THEY'RE HERE,

341
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,583
SO I FEEL MUCH BETTER
WHEN THEY AREN'T.

342
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,583
- HEH.

343
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,500
- IS IT NOT AS YOU REMEMBER?

344
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:41,916
- YE-- YEAH.

345
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,666
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE I CAME HERE.

346
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,583
IT SURE IS A BIG HOUSE.

347
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,416
- BUT IT'S NOT NEARLY
AS BIG AS YOUR OWN HOME.

348
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,708
SHALL WE?

349
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:51,875
HURRY ALONG!

350
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,833
( giggles )

351
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,166
- IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH
THE DISHES, LADY AOI?

352
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,625
- KAORU-SAMA WON'T BE
JOINING US TONIGHT.

353
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,083
I GUESS I'M NOT
QUITE USED TO THAT.

354
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,833
( sighs )

355
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,750
- THIS ROOM FEELS PRETTY BIG 
WITH JUST THE TWO OF US HERE.

356
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,916
- SAY, HANABISHI-SAMA?

357
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,083
WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT FOR
MAYU TO COME SIT

358
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,750
NEXT TO YOU,
HANABISHI-SAMA?

359
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,791
- HUH?  OH, SURE.

360
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,750
- HA!  HURRAY!  THANK YOU!

361
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,000
- UH...

362
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:31,958
( sighs )

363
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,250
YOU SURE EAT REALLY NEATLY,
MAYU-CHAN.

364
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,416
- YOU'RE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO
 USING A KNIFE AND A FORK?

365
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,416
- IS IT REALLY THAT OBVIOUS?

366
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,083
I'M A LOT BETTER AT
EATING WITH CHOPSTICKS.

367
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,083
- ( giggles ) I, ON THE OTHER
HAND, AM TERRIBLE WITH THEM.

368
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,583
- OH, I NEVER
WOULD HAVE GUESSED.

369
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:52,708
- ( rings )

370
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:55,333
- PARDON ME.

371
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,750
- PLEASE FETCH SOME
CHOPSTICKS FOR OUR GUEST.

372
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,416
- CERTAINLY, MADAME,
RIGHT AWAY.

373
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,083
- YOUR CHOPSTICKS
WILL ONLY TAKE A MOMENT.

374
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,250
- THANKS A LOT.

375
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,750
SAY, DO YOU NORMALLY EAT
WITH MR. SAIONJI?

376
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,416
- NO, I USUALLY EAT
BY MYSELF.

377
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,250
- HUH?  BY YOURSELF?

378
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,750
- IS SOMETHING BOTHERING YOU?

379
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,458
- HUH?  NO.
MY MIND JUST WANDERED OFF.

380
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,250
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING.

381
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,750
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
REALLY HAPPENED?

382
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,250
- ( laughs )
ISN'T IT SO FUNNY?

383
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,625
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

384
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,291
MAYU VISITED
A LONDON PARK ONE TIME

385
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,291
THAT WAS TEEMING
WITH SQUIRRELS. 

386
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,958
- SQUIRRELS?
- YES.

387
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,666
AND IT WAS AN ORDINARY
CITY PARK TOO.

388
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,416
AT FIRST I THOUGHT
IT WAS UNUSUAL,

389
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,916
BUT IN ENGLAND, SQUIRRELS ARE AS
COMMON AS PIGEONS ARE IN JAPAN.

390
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,250
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

391
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,916
- ISN'T THAT JUST SO AMUSING?

392
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,250
EVEN THE THOUGHT OF SQUIRRELS
LIVING IN NORMAL PARKS

393
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,916
WOULD SEEM PREPOSTEROUS
TO THOSE LIVING IN JAPAN.

394
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,333
- THAT'S TRUE, ALL RIGHT.

395
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,083
I'VE ONLY SEEN SQUIRRELS
IN PET STORES.

396
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,583
- AS I WAS SAYING--

397
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,916
- ( chimes )

398
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,375
- OH, JEEZ, I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S THIS LATE.

399
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,666
OH.

400
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,833
- AS I WAS SAYING,

401
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,500
ONE OF THE SQUIRRELS
JUMPED OFF THE TREE,

402
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:13,041
AND THEN FLEW STRAIGHT
IN MY DIRECTION.

403
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,583
- MAYU-CHAN.

404
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,250
- AND I--
I WAS SO STARTLED BY IT

405
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,875
THAT I FELL OVER.
- I'M SORRY.

406
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,458
BUT I HAVE TO GO.

407
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,958
- AND SO THEN--
SO THEN...

408
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,958
THE SQUIRREL...
- MAYU-CHAN.

409
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,416
- THE SQUIRREL--

410
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,250
- I REALLY HAVE TO GET GOING.

411
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,125
- PLEASE, DON'T GO!

412
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,416
STAY HERE AND LISTEN
TO MY STORY.

413
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,125
I BEG YOU!

414
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,416
PLEASE DON'T GO.

415
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,458
STAY HERE AND LISTEN
TO MY STORY.

416
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:43,458
- MAYU-CHAN...

417
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:44,958
- I'M BEGGING YOU.

418
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,958
( crying )

419
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,958
DON'T GO HOME.

420
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,708
- KAORU-SAMA,
IT'S AWFULLY LATE.

421
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,916
- ( phone ringing )
- ( gasps )

422
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,791
- I'M SORRY FOR TAKING SO LONG.

423
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:26,125
YES, I BELIEVE THAT LADY AOI
MUST BE IN HER ROOM RIGHT NOW.

424
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,416
PLEASE WAIT AND I--

425
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,583
- MISS  MIYABI,
IS THAT KAORU-SAMA?

426
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,625
- SHE'LL BE WITH YOU
IN A MOMENT.

427
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,625
- YEAH, SORRY.

428
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,500
I KNOW THAT THIS IS
KIND OF SUDDEN.

429
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,333
- IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

430
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:44,625
SO THEN YOU'LL BE STAYING
WITH YOUR ACQUAINTANCE TONIGHT.

431
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,291
YES.  I UNDERSTAND.

432
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,916
WELL, THEN, I WISH YOU
A GOOD NIGHT.

433
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,250
- FROM WHAT WAS SAID,
I TAKE IT THAT SIR KAORU

434
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,416
WON'T BE COMING HOME.
- MM-HMM.

435
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,916
IT APPEARS THAT HE WILL BE
SPENDING THE NIGHT

436
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,416
AT AN ACQUAINTANCE'S HOUSE.

437
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,208
- IS THAT SO?

438
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,208
I'LL BE STAYING UP
FOR A LITTLE WHILE LONGER,

439
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,250
SO WHY DON'T YOU PLEASE GO
AND GET TO SLEEP?

440
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,750
STAYING UP LATE IS
BAD FOR THE SKIN.

441
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,291
- I WILL.

442
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,833
- ( door opens )
- HUH?

443
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:16,041
- TINA SENPAI AND I ARE
BACK NOW.

444
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,708
- OH, MY, MISS TINA.

445
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,708
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER,
MISS TAEKO?

446
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,625
- WELL, LONG STORY SHORT:

447
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:24,541
SHE GOT INTO A FIGHT WITH 
HANABISHI SENPAI'S FRIEND.

448
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,000
- MISS TINA, CAN YOU TELL ME
IF YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?

449
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,250
- ( groans )
- OW!

450
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,666
- WHAT THE HECK'S
WRONG WITH YOU, KAORU?!

451
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,750
- ( gasps )

452
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:31,916
- OH.

453
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,666
- SHE'S BEEN LIKE THIS
ALL NIGHT.

454
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,250
- EXCUSE ME.
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?

455
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,916
- IT REALLY WASN'T ANYTHING.

456
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,916
ANYWAY, I'M GOING TO BED NOW.

457
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,750
GOOD NIGHT, MISS AOI.
- ( Tina groaning )

458
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,083
- COME ON, LET'S GET YOU
TO YOUR ROOM, SENPAI.

459
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,375
- OH...

460
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,208
- THAT SURE WAS
A SURPRISE, THOUGH.

461
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:50,625
THAT GIRL KISSING HANABISHI
SENPAI OUT OF NOWHERE.

462
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,250
- THERE WAS A GIRL?

463
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,666
AND A KISS?

464
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,208
KAORU-SAMA...

465
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:07,666
WHAT IN THE WORLD
IS GOING ON HERE?

466
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,375
CAN IT BE...

467
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,833
THAT'S WHERE HE IS
STAYING TONIGHT?

468
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,708
KAORU-SAMA!

469
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,083
- WELL, GOOD NIGHT THEN,
MAYU-CHAN.

470
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,750
- ( gasps )

471
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,416
HANABISHI-SAMA IS STAYING
WITH MAYU.

472
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,541
- WHAT?

473
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,250
MAYU-CHAN.
