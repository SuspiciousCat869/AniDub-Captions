1
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:34,916
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,000
- ( humming )

4
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:12,958
- HEY, MISS AOI,

5
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:14,791
DID SOMETHING GOOD
HAPPEN RECENTLY?

6
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,500
- HUH?
WHAT MADE YOU ASK THAT?

7
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,083
- WELL, TO TELL THE TRUTH,

8
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,333
YOU'RE LOOKING
HAPPIER THAN USUAL.

9
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:22,916
- YOU REALLY THINK SO?

10
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,416
HUH?  GO SHOPPING 
TOGETHER WITH YOU?

11
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,750
- YEAH.
IF TOMORROW'S OKAY WITH YOU,

12
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,250
I WAS THINKING THAT
WE COULD GO OUT TOGETHER.

13
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,750
OH, BUT IF YOU HAVE
ERRANDS TO RUN,

14
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:37,833
I CAN GO BY MYSELF.

15
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,541
( gasps )
- I WILL GO.

16
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,541
PLEASE ALLOW ME TO ACCOMPANY
YOU TOMORROW, KAORU-SAMA.

17
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,083
NO MATTER WHAT
THE DAY MAY BRING,

18
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,125
I WISH TO GO WITH YOU.

19
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,500
- UH, SURE.

20
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,250
- ( giggles )

21
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,583
- HUH?

22
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:57,625
- ( laughing )

23
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:04,458
I WONDER WHAT
I SHOULD WEAR TOMORROW.

24
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,875
OH.

25
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,500
THIS IS...

26
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:13,750
( gasps )

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,583
OHH.

28
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,500
( sighs )

29
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,083
- LET'S SEE.

30
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,583
MISS MIYABI WANTS
FERRET FOOD FOR UZUME,

31
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,875
TAEKO-CHAN WANTS
THE NEWEST OCCULT NOVEL,

32
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,291
AND TINA WANTS--

33
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,875
- I WANT THE VIDEO GAME

34
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,541
"FIGHTING SON-IN-LAWS THREE"!

35
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,416
- WHAT KIND OF 
A GAME IS THAT?

36
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,250
MAYBE A FIGHTING GAME?

37
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,125
AOI-CHAN.
( gasps )

38
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:57,541
- SORRY FOR MAKING YOU WAIT,
KAORU-SAMA.

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,583
- ( meows )
- ( gasps )

40
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,208
- ( meows )

41
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,250
- WOW.

42
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,291
THAT'S A PRETTY KIMONO
YOU'RE WEARING THERE. 

43
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,583
- SO THEN YOU APPROVE
OF WHAT I'M WEARING? 

44
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,458
- YEAH.  IT LOOKS
REALLY NICE ON YOU.

45
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,500
IT SUITS YOU, TOO.

46
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,000
- THANK GOODNESS.

47
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,291
- UH--

48
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,208
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SAYING
SO, KAORU-SAMA.

49
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,000
- OH, HEY,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BOW.

50
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,375
COME ON.

51
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,791
- ACTUALLY, THIS KIMONO WAS
GIVEN TO ME BY MY GRANDMOTHER.

52
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,458
- OHH, IS THAT TRUE?

53
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,416
WERE YOU CLOSE TO
YOUR GRANDMOTHER, AOI-CHAN?

54
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,458
- YES. BOTH MY FATHER AND MOTHER
WERE ALWAYS BUSY WITH WORK

55
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:38,875
WHILE I WAS GROWING UP.

56
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,333
SO SHE TOOK CARE
OF ME OFTEN.

57
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,916
SHE WAS SUCH A KIND PERSON.

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,083
I LOVED HER VERY MUCH.

59
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,583
SHE PASSED AWAY
FIVE YEARS AGO, UNFORTUNATELY.

60
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,750
- I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,458
HUH?

62
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,375
WHY DID YOU STOP WALKING,
AOI-CHAN?

63
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,250
- CHERRY BLOSSOMS.

64
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,458
- Kaoru: AOI-CHAN?

65
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,125
- UH-- OHH.

66
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,416
WHEN I WAS YOUNG,
MY GRANDMOTHER WOULD TAKE ME

67
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,125
TO SEE THE CHERRY BLOSSOMS.

68
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,541
EACH AND EVERY YEAR.

69
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,291
AND WHEN SHE DID,

70
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,500
GRANDMOTHER WOULD ALWAYS
BE WEARING THIS KIMONO. 

71
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,583
I LOVED THIS KIMONO,

72
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,333
AND I OFTEN
FUSSED OVER IT,

73
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,916
SAYING THAT I WANTED ONE
JUST LIKE IT.

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,750
- GRANDMA, AOI WANTS A KIMONO
JUST LIKE YOURS.

75
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,208
I WANT ONE, I WANT ONE!

76
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,583
- GOODNESS GRACIOUS.

77
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,250
YOU WANT A KIMONO OVER
WESTERN STYLE CLOTHES?

78
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,041
YOU'RE A KIMONO
MERCHANT ALREADY.

79
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,875
- YEAH.
DON'T YOU KNOW, GRANDMA?

80
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,125
I LOVE KIMONOS!

81
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,166
- IS THAT SO?

82
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,708
THEN PLEASE, AOI,

83
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,291
NEVER FORGET THIS ONE THING.

84
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,458
ALL KIMONOS
ARE VERY SPECIAL,

85
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:50,208
BECAUSE THEY ARE OVERFLOWING
WITH THE FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS

86
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,750
OF THOSE WHO WEAR THEM.

87
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:56,000
SO WHEN YOU WEAR A KIMONO THAT
ORIGINAL BELONGED TO ANOTHER,

88
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,125
YOU ARE ALSO WEARING
THE FEELINGS OF THAT PERSON

89
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,666
THAT THE KIMONO HAS FELT.

90
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,666
- WHAT THE KIMONO HAS FELT?

91
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,250
- YOU'RE STILL YOUNG,

92
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,125
SO THIS MAY BE
A LITTLE HARD TO UNDERSTAND.

93
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,166
AOI...

94
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,583
WHEN YOU BECOME OLDER,

95
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:10,791
THIS KIMONO IS YOURS.

96
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:11,916
- REALLY, GRANDMA?

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,916
- SO PLEASE,
WEAR IT WHEN YOU HAVE

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,125
A LEISURELY STROLL
LIKE THIS,

99
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,250
WALKING TOGETHER WITH
THE PERSON YOU'LL MARRY.

100
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:21,250
- OH, I ALREADY KNOW
WHO THAT PERSON WILL BE.

101
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,125
- OH?
- AOI WILL BE TOGETHER

102
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,625
WITH KAORU-SAMA
OF THE HANABISHIS.

103
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,250
- I SEE.
ONE OF THE HANABISHIS.

104
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,583
THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

105
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,083
IN MY YOUNGER DAYS,
I TOOK MANY A WALK 

106
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,250
WITH YOUR GRANDFATHER
WEARING THIS KIMONO. 

107
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,750
YOU KNOW, AOI,

108
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,708
YOUR GRANDFATHER LOVED THIS
KIMONO MORE THAN ANY OTHER.

109
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,750
IF THE FEELINGS
HELD IN THIS KIMONO

110
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,583
ARE ONE DAY PASSED
DOWN UNTO YOU,

111
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,916
THEN THAT BOY OF
THE HANABISHIS WILL SURELY--

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,875
HE WILL SURELY
LIKE THIS KIMONO AS WELL.

113
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:54,916
- WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,083
I DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
WHAT MY GRANDMOTHER

115
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,291
WAS TALKING ABOUT.

116
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,500
BUT I UNDERSTAND IT
QUITE WELL NOW.

117
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,125
THIS KIMONO OVERFLOWS

118
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:09,625
WITH THE LOVE YOU FEEL FOR THE
PERSON WHO'S DEAREST TO YOU.

119
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,250
- WOW.

120
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,791
THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE STORY.

121
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,083
- KAORU-SAMA.
- HUH?

122
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,416
- STANDING HERE WITH YOU
WEARING THIS KIMONO

123
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,625
MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I'M
FALLING MORE AND MORE

124
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,208
IN LOVE WITH YOU EVERY MOMENT.

125
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,583
- ( stammers )

126
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,625
- ( sighs )

127
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,416
SO THAT'S WHY I'VE ALWAYS 
WANTED TO WEAR THIS KIMONO

128
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,583
AND STEP OUTSIDE
FOR A STROLL WITH YOU.

129
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,583
THANK YOU.

130
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,250
- OH. SO THAT'S
WHAT IS WAS, HUH?

131
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,250
I'M KIND OF
EMBARRASSED BY IT ALL.

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,500
LET'S SEE, THIS LOOKS LIKE
EVERYTHING WE HAD TO BUY,

133
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:49,375
I THINK.

134
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,125
- ( chuckles )
- AOI-CHAN?

135
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,916
- LOOK AT THIS,
KAORU-SAMA.

136
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,708
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED OVER HERE?

137
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,583
- THIS PLACE IS...

138
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,750
( gasps )
OH YEAH.

139
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,583
THIS IS WHERE YOU AND I
MET AGAIN AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS.

140
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:04,583
- THAT'S RIGHT.

141
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,583
IT WAS QUITE A COINCIDENCE

142
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,583
THAT YOU HAPPENED TO
PASS BY THAT DAY

143
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,583
TO FIX THE STRAP
ON MY SANDAL.

144
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,541
I REALLY APPRECIATED IT.

145
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,916
- Kaoru: I'M USUALLY
NOT THAT NICE TO OTHER PEOPLE,

146
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,541
BUT FOR SOME REASON
THAT DAY

147
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,500
I WAS REALLY WORRIED ABOUT YOU,
AOI-CHAN.

148
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,916
- Both: HMM?
- WHAT?

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,708
HEY, WHY WON'T THIS
GATE LET ME PASS?

150
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,583
THAT'S STRANGE.

151
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,166
- ( both chuckle )
- WELL, WHAT SHOULD I DO?

152
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,833
- EXCUSE ME.

153
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,208
WHAT SEEMS TO BE
THE MATTER?

154
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,166
- OH, WELL...

155
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,250
THANK YOU FOR THE HELP
YOU'VE GIVEN ME.  SEE YOU.

156
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,250
- ( chuckles )

157
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,583
I ALMOST FEEL AS IF
MY PAST SELF

158
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,208
IS REFLECTED
IN THE PRESENT.

159
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,875
- THAT REMINDS ME,
YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU AND I

160
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,250
TOOK THE TRAIN TOGETHER
TO IZUMIGAOKA.

161
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,458
- I DO.

162
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:49,791
BUT NOW THAT
I THINK ABOUT IT,

163
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,250
IT SEEMS THAT
WE ARRIVED THERE

164
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,750
ONLY A FEW MOMENTS
AFTER WE BOARDED. 

165
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,166
- ( chuckles ) ACTUALLY,
WHAT HAPPENED BACK THEN 

166
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,833
WAS THAT YOU FELL ASLEEP

167
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,625
AND WE ENDED UP
GOING ALL THE WAY AROUND

168
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,125
BEFORE GETTING OFF
AT THE STATION.

169
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,416
- Aoi: WHAT?
IS THAT REALLY TRUE?

170
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,083
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THAT.

171
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,208
I WAS WORN OUT AFTER
ALL THE EXCITEMENT. 

172
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,916
( gasps )
WAS THAT ALL I DID, KAORU-SAMA?

173
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,333
OR WAS THERE SOME OTHER WAY
THAT I TROUBLED YOU?

174
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,958
- I'M NOT SURE
WHAT YOU MEAN.

175
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,125
- WELL, FOR INSTANCE,
SLEEP WALKING?

176
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,583
- NOTHING LIKE THAT WENT ON.
YOU SLEPT SOUNDLY.

177
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,083
OH, BUT I GUESS THERE WAS
A LITTLE DROOLING GOING ON.

178
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,583
- WHAT?

179
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,083
- NOT REALLY.
I'M ONLY KIDDING.

180
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,583
- ( sighs )

181
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,500
- HOW COULD YOU BE
SO HORRIBLE, KAORU-SAMA?

182
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:36,333
- Kaoru: I REMEMBER WHEN
I FIRST CAME TO TOKYO.

183
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,250
- KAORU-SAMA?
KAORU-SAMA?

184
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,291
IS ANYTHING THE MATTER,
KAORU-SAMA?

185
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,250
- SAY, AOI-CHAN,
WANT TO TAG ALONG?

186
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,291
- TAG ALONG?
WHERE WILL WE BE GOING?

187
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,250
- THE APARTMENT.

188
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:54,000
THE APARTMENT WHERE
I USED TO LIVE.

189
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,833
- KAORU-SAMA.

190
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,750
- THIS PLACE HASN'T
EVEN CHANGED A BIT.

191
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,541
SO, DO YOU WANT TO
GO UP TO THE ROOM?

192
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,500
- SURE.

193
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,291
- I GUESS THEY HAVEN'T
FOUND A RENTER FOR THIS PLACE.

194
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:14,291
( gasps )

195
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,458
LOOKS LIKE IT'S OPEN.

196
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,500
SURE BRINGS BACK MEMORIES.

197
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:38,458
- THIS PLACE HOLDS SOME 
MEMORIES FOR ME AS WELL.

198
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:41,000
THERE WERE SO MANY
UNFORGETTABLE MOMENTS

199
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,000
IN THIS ONE SMALL ROOM
AFTER ALL.

200
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,416
- THERE SURE WERE.

201
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,583
- OCCASIONALLY,
I HAVE THIS RECURRING DREAM.

202
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,583
- RECURRING?
- YES.

203
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:28,083
IT'S A DREAM ABOUT
BEING WITH YOU IN THIS ROOM

204
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,416
WE'RE STANDING IN,

205
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,541
BUT THE KAORU-SAMA
THAT I ALWAYS SEE 

206
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,125
IN THIS RECURRING DREAM

207
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,583
NEVER SAYS ANYTHING.

208
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:38,500
NOT A SINGLE WORD,
NO MATTER WHAT TOPIC I BRING UP.

209
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:42,458
I PREPARED MANY MEALS
FOR THAT SILENT KAORU-SAMA.

210
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,458
PLEASE, GO AHEAD AND
START EATING, KAORU-SAMA.

211
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:49,583
HOWEVER, NO MATTER
WHAT I DID,

212
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,583
WHETHER IT WAS WATCHING
TELEVISION WITH THAT KAORU-SAMA,

213
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,083
READING BOOKS WITH HIM,

214
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,250
ENGAGING IN
LIVELY CONVERSATION,

215
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:59,250
HE WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING.

216
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,708
DESPITE EVERYTHING,
HE WOULD JUST REMAIN SILENT.

217
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:06,250
I HAD NO IDEA
WHAT TO DO.

218
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,000
WHEN I THOUGHT OF
THE POSSIBILITY

219
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,916
THAT HE MIGHT
NO LONGER LIKE ME,

220
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,583
IT FELT SO PAINFUL.

221
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,125
ONE TEAR WOULD FALL
AFTER ANOTHER.

222
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,916
THAT IS THE MOMENT
I ALWAYS WAKE UP, 

223
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,916
AND THE MOMENT THAT
I ALWAYS REALIZE

224
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,916
THAT WHAT HAD
REALLY OCCURRED

225
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,458
WAS THAT I HAD
FALLEN ASLEEP CRYING.

226
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:27,916
IT'S JUST A DREAM,

227
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,916
ONLY A DREAM
AND NOTHING MORE.

228
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,916
BUT UNCERTAINTIES ALWAYS
FILL MY MIND REGARDLESS.

229
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,250
I WONDER WHY THAT IS.

230
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,166
- AOI-CHAN.

231
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,291
( gasps )

232
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,125
( sighs )

233
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,583
- I APOLOGIZE,
KAORU-SAMA.

234
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,250
I KNOW IT SOUNDS STRANGE.

235
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,250
PERHAPS THE REASON I HAVE
THIS DREAM EVERY SO OFTEN

236
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,708
IS BECAUSE
I WORRY TOO MUCH.

237
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,625
( gasps )

238
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,250
- THAT JUST
ISN'T TRUE AT ALL.

239
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,750
IT ISN'T TRUE,
BELIEVE ME.

240
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,458
- OH, KAORU-SAMA.

241
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,500
KAORU-SAMA?

242
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,708
- Kaoru: AFTER I WAS FORCEFULLY
SEPARATED FROM MY MOTHER,

243
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,583
THE DAYS BACK IN
HANABISHI WERE HARD.

244
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,916
I WAS NEVER ALLOWED
TO DO ANYTHING FUN.

245
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,541
I HATED THE HANABISHI
FAMILY.

246
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,500
AFTER MY MOTHER
PASSED AWAY,

247
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,041
THE VERY THOUGHT THAT
THE BLOOD OF THE HANABISHIS

248
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,541
WAS RUNNING INSIDE OF ME

249
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,000
WAS ENOUGH
TO DRIVE ME CRAZY.

250
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,583
SO I SAVED AS MUCH
MONEY AS I COULD, 

251
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,750
AND USED IT
TO LEAVE HANABISHI.

252
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,916
THAT'S WHEN I MOVED
INTO TOKYO

253
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,583
AND STARTED A NEW LIFE
ALL BY MYSELF

254
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,958
IN THIS APARTMENT.

255
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,916
AFTER THAT,
I WORKED EVERY DAY.

256
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,583
I COULDN'T RELY ON ANYONE
BUT MYSELF TO SURVIVE

257
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,833
BECAUSE I JUST COULDN'T
RELY ON ANYONE.

258
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,791
I WAS ALL ALONE
IN THE WORLD,

259
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,750
AND THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED
SOMETHING FOR THE FIRST TIME.

260
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,250
THAT I NO LONGER HAD
ANYONE IN THIS WORLD

261
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,458
THAT I COULD
CALL MY FAMILY.

262
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,458
AND EVERY DAY
UNTIL RECENTLY,

263
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,875
I KEPT CURSING THE WORLD
THAT I WAS BORN INTO.

264
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,791
- KAORU-SAMA.

265
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,250
- BUT NOW I HAVE
A REASON TO STOP DOING THAT,

266
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,208
BECAUSE THERE'S FINALLY
SOMETHING IN MY LIFE

267
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,375
THAT MAKES ME HAPPY THAT I WAS
BORN INTO THE HANABISHI CLAN.

268
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,708
AND THAT REASON,
AOI-CHAN...

269
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,208
- ( gasps )

270
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,208
- IS BECAUSE
I MET YOU.

271
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,916
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE HERE 
AND THAT YOU'RE MY FIANCEE

272
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,041
IS THE ONLY SAVING GRACE
OF MY BIRTH AND MY EXISTENCE.

273
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,833
- ( crying )
KAORU-SAMA.

274
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,666
- AOI-CHAN.
I'M REALLY GLAD

275
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,416
THAT YOU'RE HERE
AS MY FIANCEE.

276
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,541
I LOVE YOU,
AOI-CHAN.

277
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,458
- BUT GRANDMA,
BUT GRANDMA,

278
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:55,000
EVEN IF KAORU-SAMA
LIKES THE KIMONO, 

279
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,458
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
HE'LL LIKE ME.

280
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:57,708
SO WHAT DO I DO THEN?

281
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,208
- EVERYTHING WILL
BE ALL RIGHT.

282
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,583
YOU NEEDN'T WORRY, AOI.

283
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,666
IF THE FEELINGS
HELD WITHIN THIS KIMONO

284
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,083
HAVE PASSED ONTO YOU,

285
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,583
THEN YOUR FEELINGS 
WILL BE PASSED ONTO

286
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,416
THAT BOY OF THE HANABISHIS.

287
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,750
AND I AM CERTAIN
THAT THE HANABISHI BOY

288
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,375
WILL RESPOND TO
THOSE FEELINGS.

289
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,208
- ( crying )

290
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,875
I'M SO HAPPY.

291
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,250
I'M SO HAPPY.

292
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,666
KAORU-SAMA.

293
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,916
THIS IS THE VERY FIRST TIME

294
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,250
THAT YOU SAID
THAT YOU'VE LOVED ME.

295
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,583
THIS IS THE VERY FIRST TIME

296
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,958
THAT I'VE HEARD YOU
SAY THOSE WORDS.

297
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,458
MY FEELINGS REALLY DID
GET PASSED DOWN ONTO YOU.

298
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,416
- AOI-CHAN.

299
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,583
- PLEASE, FORGIVE ME.

300
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,583
I KEPT WORRYING
ABOUT THIS FOR SO VERY LONG.

301
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,500
WHETHER OR NOT I WOULD BE ABLE

302
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,583
TO STAY AT YOUR
SIDE, KAORU-SAMA,

303
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,583
AS YOUR FIANCEE.

304
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:47,750
BUT I DID NOT TRULY KNOW HOW
YOU FELT ABOUT ME ALL THIS TIME.

305
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,541
I HAD CONSTANTLY WONDERED

306
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,083
WHETHER YOU ACTUALLY
ACKNOWLEDGED

307
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,416
MY FEELINGS FOR YOU.

308
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,250
I FELT LIKE ASKING YOU 
MANY TIMES IN THE PAST.

309
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,916
BUT I WAS AFRAID OF WHAT
THE ANSWER MIGHT BE.

310
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,583
- SO THAT WAS IT.

311
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,250
I'M SORRY, AOI-CHAN.

312
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,583
TO TELL THE TRUTH,
I WAS A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE

313
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,666
PUTTING IT INTO WORDS,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

314
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,791
- NO, PLEASE DON'T APOLOGIZE.

315
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:13,291
YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG
IN THE VERY LEAST, KAORU-SAMA. 

316
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,333
I REALLY AM HOPELESS,
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?

317
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,125
I ALWAYS WORRY
MYSELF TO DEATH.

318
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:21,250
EVER SINCE I FIRST MET YOU
WHEN WE WERE CHILDREN,

319
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,083
I'VE ALWAYS
THOUGHT ABOUT YOU.

320
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,541
AND I STARTED TO
WORRY ABOUT SUCH THINGS

321
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,583
EVEN WHEN I WAS
STILL A CHILD. 

322
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,791
"I WONDER WHAT KAORU-SAMA
IS DOING RIGHT NOW?

323
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,916
WHAT KIND OF A LIFE
IS HE LEADING?

324
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,750
WHAT KIND OF A MAN 
HAS HE GROWN INTO?"

325
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,250
I HAD SPENT
MY ENTIRE CHILDHOOD

326
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,125
THINKING ABOUT YOU.

327
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,750
HOWEVER,

328
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,708
ONE DAY I WAS TOLD
SOMETHING VERY SUDDENLY.

329
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:49,750
IMPOSSIBLE!

330
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,375
WHY IS IT GOING
TO BE CANCELED?

331
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,500
- I HAVE NOT HEARD
ANY REASON GIVEN YET.

332
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,791
THE HANABISHI CLAN
SIMPLY TOLD US TO FORGET

333
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,500
THAT THE ENGAGEMENT
EVER OCCURRED.

334
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,250
- IT WAS THE HANABISHI CLAN?

335
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,333
KAORU-SAMA WAS NOT
THE ONE WHO SAID IT?

336
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,666
- I HAVE ONLY HEARD FROM
THE HANABISHI CLAN.

337
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,708
- THEN WHAT ABOUT
KAORU-SAMA?

338
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,916
THIS MAY NOT BE
HIS DESIRE AT ALL.

339
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,875
- LADY AOI!
- ( gasps )

340
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,458
- I'M TELLING YOU THIS
ENGAGEMENT IS OFFICIALLY OVER.

341
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,541
I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL,
BUT OUR RELATIONSHIP

342
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,333
WITH THE HANABISHIS
HAS NEVER BEEN STRONG.

343
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,041
- IT'S NOT OVER.
- LADY AOI!

344
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,916
- IT'S NOT OVER,
IT'S NOT OVER!

345
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,583
I WAS ABLE TO DO MY BEST
UP UNTIL THIS MOMENT

346
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,000
BECAUSE OF KAORU-SAMA.

347
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,083
EVERYTHING I DID WAS
FOR THE SINGLE PURPOSE

348
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,666
OF BEING HIS WIFE ONE DAY.

349
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,958
I CANNOT IMAGINE BEING
WITH ANY OTHER PERSON 

350
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,125
THAN KAORU-SAMA.

351
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,291
( sobbing )

352
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,916
- OH, LADY AOI.

353
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,916
- Aoi:
FROM THE VERY MOMENT

354
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,250
THAT I HEARD THAT ANNOUNCEMENT,
I CRIED.

355
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,250
I CRIED UNTIL
MY TEARS RAN DRY.

356
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,916
AND THAT WAS WHEN I DECIDED

357
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,541
THAT I WOULD GO WHEREVER
YOU WERE, KAORU-SAMA.

358
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,875
BUT I HAD ABSOLUTELY
NO IDEA WHAT KIND OF

359
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,083
PERSON YOU HAD BECOME.

360
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,916
TRUTHFULLY,
I WAS VERY WORRIED.

361
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,250
BUT WHEN I DISCOVERED
IN THIS VERY ROOM

362
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,000
THAT THE PERSON WHO
HAD HELPED ME

363
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,583
WAS INDEED KAORU-SAMA,

364
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,750
I WAS TRULY HAPPY.

365
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,583
AND YOU WERE JUST AS I HAD
IMAGINED YOU WOULD BE.

366
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,083
NO, YOU WERE MORE WONDERFUL

367
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,541
THAN I HAD EVER IMAGINED.

368
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,625
I AM ALSO HAPPY
BEYOND WORDS

369
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,875
THAT YOU ARE HERE AS MY FIANCE,
KAORU-SAMA.

370
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,666
- THANKS FOR SAYING SO,
AOI-CHAN.

371
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,250
- I REALLY LOVE YOU.

372
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,291
I REALLY DO LOVE YOU,
KAORU-SAMA.

373
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,875
- AOI-CHAN.

374
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,833
- KAORU-SAMA.

375
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,583
- HERE'S THE PLACE.

376
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,750
THIS APARTMENT GETS
PLENTY OF SUNSHINE,

377
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,416
AND BECAUSE IT'S IN
THE CORNER OF THE BUILDING,

378
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,083
IT TENDS TO BE
VERY QUIET HERE.

379
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,791
YOU REALLY CAN'T ASK
FOR MORE THAN THAT. 

380
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,166
HOW DO YOU LIKE IT SO FAR?

381
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,125
- Man: WOW, IT'S CLEANER
THAN I THOUGHT IT'D BE. 

382
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,625
BUT I THINK THIS PLACE
COULD USE A LOFT OR SOMETHING.

383
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,458
- IT'S REASONABLE FOR
THE PRICE RANGE, ISN'T IT?

384
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:01,125
- YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW THAT
I'D PREFER WOOD FLOORS.

385
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,250
- I LIKE THE JAPANESE
STYLE ROOM.

386
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,083
- WELL, AS LONG AS
YOU LIKE IT, YUMI,

387
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,250
I'M OKAY WITH IT.

388
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,250
- Yumi: REALLY?

389
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,833
- THAT WAS REALLY CLOSE.

390
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,333
- BUT ISN'T THIS A BIT SMALL
FOR TWO PEOPLE TO LIVE IN?

391
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,625
- I DON'T REALLY MIND
IF IT'S A SMALLER PLACE.

392
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:17,416
ALL IT MEANS IS THAT I CAN
ALWAYS BE BY YOUR SIDE, TAKASHI.

393
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,083
- Takashi: YEAH,
YOU REALLY MEAN THAT?

394
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:22,458
- Yumi: YES! I'M HAPPY WITH ANY
PLACE AS LONG AS I'M WITH YOU.

395
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,125
- I KNOW THAT NOBODY
WOULD EVER DESCRIBE 

396
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,250
THIS PLACE AS BIG,

397
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,041
BUT IT HAS PLENTY
OF STORAGE SPACE.

398
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,958
- Kaoru: STORAGE SPACE?

399
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,583
- JUST TAKE A LOOK IN HERE.

400
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,541
YOU DON'T SEE
MANY PLACES WITH THIS.

401
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:34,541
( gasps )

402
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,250
- Yumi: COME ON OUT,
MR. REALTOR.

403
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,833
WE'VE SEEN ENOUGH
OF THIS PLACE,

404
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,250
SO LET'S MOVE ON,
OKAY?

405
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,916
- OH, WHATEVER YOU SAY.
( chuckles )

406
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,500
( gasps )

407
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,125
WHAT WAS THIS 
DOING IN HERE?

408
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,583
( chuckles )

409
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,250
- ( both sigh )

410
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,750
- WE'RE IN THE CLEAR
AT LAST.

411
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:55,250
I THINK WE'D BETTER
GET OUT OF HERE WHILE WE CAN.

412
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,583
- YES.

413
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,000
( sighs )

414
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,666
DO YOU THINK THAT
COUPLE FROM EARLIER

415
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,416
WILL BE MOVING 
INTO THAT ROOM?

416
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,875
- Kaoru: YEAH, MAYBE.

417
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,875
- SOMEHOW,
I ENVY THEM A LITTLE.

418
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,208
- HUH?

419
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:11,458
- MISS MIYABI, MISS TINA,
AND MISS TAEKO,

420
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,625
IT REALLY IS FUN TO BE TOGETHER
WITH EVERYONE LIKE THAT.

421
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,458
HOWEVER, I WISH THAT
WE COULD HAVE SPENT 

422
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,291
MORE TIME LIVING
IN THAT ROOM BY OURSELVES.

423
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,166
BECAUSE THEN I WOULD HAVE
BEEN CLOSER TO YOU.

424
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,166
- THAT'S TRUE.

425
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,500
- ( gasps )
- BUT DON'T FORGET

426
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,750
THAT WE'RE STILL LIVING CLOSE
TO EACH OTHER, AOI-CHAN.

427
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,875
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT ANYMORE.

428
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,166
- KAORU-SAMA.

429
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,250
NO, I BELIEVE THAT 
I WILL STILL WORRY.

430
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,916
IT'S IN MY VERY 
NATURE TO WORRY.

431
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,416
I'LL NEVER STOP MY WORRYING,
EVEN NOW.

432
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,416
- WHAT?

433
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,666
- AFTER ALL,

434
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,875
WHEN I'M THINKING OF
SOMEONE VERY DEAR TO ME,

435
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,208
HOW COULD I EVER
JUST STOP?

436
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,833
- AOI-CHAN.

437
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,583
- SO I HOPE
YOU DON'T MIND THAT.

438
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,583
I'M GOING TO WORRY
MORE AND MORE ABOUT YOU,

439
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,416
AND IT'S ONLY GOING
TO GET WORSE, OKAY?

440
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,041
- ( sighs )

441
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:01,291
- DO YOU DISLIKE ME 
FOR BEING LIKE THAT?

442
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:02,625
- ( chuckles )

443
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,791
NO, I LOVE YOU,
AOI-CHAN.

444
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,458
- KAORU-SAMA.

445
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,416
KAORU-SAMA.

446
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,958
- UH, WE'D BETTER GET HOME,
AOI-CHAN.

447
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,583
- RIGHT.

448
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:25,916
( giggles )

449
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,416
KAORU-SAMA.

450
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,375
I REALLY LOVE YOU!

451
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,791
- ( theme music playing )

452
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,708
- ( singing in Japanese )

453
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:01,208
- Tina: HOW COULD YOU BE
SO MEAN AND CRUEL

454
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:02,583
AND EVIL TO ME?!

455
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:04,250
KAORU, YOU BIG MEANIE!

456
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:06,625
THE ONLY THING YOU
DIDN'T BUY WAS MY GAME.

457
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:09,208
- WHAT?
THIS IS REALLY STRANGE.

458
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:11,166
- ALL RIGHT!
I GOT YOU NOW!

459
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,500
COME ON.
IS THAT ALL YOU'VE GOT,

460
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:13,666
SON-IN-LAW?

461
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,583
DON'T LET THAT PANSY
SON-IN-LAW BEAT YOU!

462
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,500
( gasps )

463
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,041
- Chika: ( giggles )
CHIKA MINAZUKI HERE.

464
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:24,541
YOU'VE GOT TO
GIVE IT YOUR ALL

465
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,041
WHEN IT COMES TO LOVE.

466
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:28,125
WHEN YOU DO THIS,
THAT, AND THEN SOME,

467
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,458
MEN ARE HAPPY.

468
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,083
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT 
IT SAYS IN THIS BOOK.

469
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,416
AI YORI AOSHI,
"SHORES."

470
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,000
BIG BROTHER,
PLEASE WAIT FOR ME.
