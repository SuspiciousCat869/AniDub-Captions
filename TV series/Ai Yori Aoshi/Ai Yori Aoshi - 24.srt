1
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,791
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,416
- ( sighs )

4
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,583
HUH?

5
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:12,916
- COME ON, CHIKA.
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

6
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,083
- THAT'S RIGHT.

7
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,750
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

8
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,083
- I DON'T KNOW, GUYS.

9
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:18,750
- THEY'RE GONNA 
COME BACK, OKAY?

10
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:19,833
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

11
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,000
- YEAH.

12
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,375
- ( sighs )

13
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,333
- IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

14
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,625
- WELL, LET'S GET GOING.

15
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,291
- YES.

16
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:49,625
- ( gasps )

17
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,250
LADY AOI!  SIR KAORU!

18
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,916
WHAT ARE YOU TWO 
STILL DOING HERE?

19
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,875
- TAKE US THERE, MISS MIYABI.

20
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,375
- WHERE?

21
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,083
- TO THE SAKURABA ESTATE.

22
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,458
- Miyabi:
ARE YOU CERTAIN ABOUT THIS?

23
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:11,375
- YES, I DECIDED THIS
WITH KAORU-SAMA.

24
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,333
- YEAH, WE DISCUSSED IT
LAST NIGHT.

25
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:17,125
WE'RE SET ON
TALKING THINGS OUT.

26
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,166
- Tina:
KAORU'S AN AWKWARD GUY.

27
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,208
AND HE'S THE TYPE
THAT CAN'T LIE TO HIMSELF.

28
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,458
BUT THOSE TWO THINGS ARE WHAT'S
SO GOOD ABOUT HIM, I GUESS.

29
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,083
- KAGURAZAKI.

30
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,625
I WANT AN EXPLANATION.

31
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,791
- UH, YES.
OF COURSE, SIR.

32
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,541
ACTUALLY--
- TO TELL THE TRUTH, FATHER...

33
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,333
...THE ONLY THING
MISS MIYABI DID WAS

34
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,750
FULFILL A SELFISH REQUEST
OF MINE.

35
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,291
I WANTED TO SEE
KAORU-SAMA AGAIN.

36
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,916
I'M THE ONE
THAT'S TO BLAME.

37
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,916
SO I WILL TAKE
FULL RESPONSIBILITY

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,916
FOR ALL OF HER ACTIONS.

39
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,958
- I WILL BE THE JUDGE
OF FAULT.

40
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,750
- BUT THIS IS NOT
MISS MIYABI'S FAULT.

41
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,250
THE BLAME SHOULD FALL ON ME.

42
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,291
- AOI.

43
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,208
- I KNOW THAT I CAME
UNANNOUNCED, AND I APOLOGIZE.

44
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,750
BUT THERE WAS
SOMETHING IMPORTANT

45
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:22,750
THAT I WISH TO
DISCUSS WITH YOU--

46
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,416
- NOT ANOTHER WORD
OUT OF YOU!

47
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,333
THIS IS A SAKURABA
FAMILY MATTER.

48
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,000
- ( slightly gasps )
- NO, IT ISN'T, FATHER.

49
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,375
PLEASE LISTEN TO WHAT 
KAORU-SAMA HAS TO SAY.

50
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,916
HIS FEELINGS ARE
THE SAME AS MY OWN.

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,708
- FEELINGS, YOU SAY.

52
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,375
- PLEASE,
JUST HEAR ME OUT, SIR.

53
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,083
- I HAVE NO REASON TO DO SO.

54
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,708
- I BEG YOU, PLEASE.

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,541
- Taeko: HANABISHI-SENPAI REALLY
HAS A STRAIGHTFORWARD HEART.

56
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:52,625
THAT'S WHY
HE SHINES SO BRIGHTLY.

57
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,041
AND WHENEVER I SEE HIM,

58
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,458
I THINK ABOUT HOW I NEED
TO DO MY BEST IN LIFE.

59
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,916
- PLEASE.  PLEASE.

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,250
JUST HEAR ME OUT, SIR.

61
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,166
- I BEG OF YOU TO
HEAR HIM OUT AS WELL, SIR.

62
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,583
HE CAME HERE WITH
VERY HONORABLE INTENTIONS.

63
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,458
- YOU SHOULDN'T OVERSTEP
YOUR BOUNDS.

64
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,208
REMEMBER YOUR PLACE,
KAGURAZAKI!

65
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,416
- I WAS CHARGED WITH 
LADY AOI'S EDUCATION.

66
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,750
AND BECAUSE I'VE SERVED
YOUR DAUGHTER ALL THESE YEARS,

67
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,625
ENSURING HER HAPPINESS
IS MY PLACE.

68
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,416
- VERY WELL, MIYABI.

69
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,250
THE YOUNG MAN MAY SPEAK FREELY.

70
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,166
- THANK YOU, MOTHER.

71
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,833
- I'M IN YOUR DEBT.
THANK YOU.

72
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,250
I, AS I AM NOW...

73
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,916
I AM NO LONGER
OFFICIALLY A MEMBER

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,208
OF THE HANABISHI HOUSE.

75
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,250
THE CIRCUMSTANCES
HAVE CHANGED

76
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,250
SINCE THE ENGAGEMENT.

77
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,083
I'M JUST A COLLEGE STUDENT NOW.

78
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,666
AND I'M AFRAID I CAN'T MAKE
ANY PROMISES ABOUT THE FUTURE.

79
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,500
BUT STILL, EVEN SO--

80
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:57,375
- IS THIS NONSENSE
ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY?

81
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:00,208
DID YOU HONESTLY THINK
THAT I APPROVED

82
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,833
OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH MY DAUGHTER,

83
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,166
CONSIDERING YOUR STATE?

84
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,750
THERE ARE NO WORDS
THAT CAN DESCRIBE MY DISGUST.

85
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,333
YOU ARE THE ONE 
WHO BETRAYED US!

86
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,916
YOU ABANDONED YOUR OBLIGATION.

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,416
YOU BETRAYED THE FEELINGS
THAT MY DAUGHTER HAD FOR YOU.

88
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,916
YOU BETRAYED THE ONE
WHO BELIEVED IN YOU THE MOST

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,708
AS YOUR FIANCEE,
AND IN DOING SO,

90
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,375
YOU BETRAYED
OUR FEELINGS AS WELL,

91
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,041
AS PARENTS WHO CARE
FOR THEIR DAUGHTER.

92
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,791
YOU BETRAYED
OUR ENTIRE FAMILY!

93
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,250
SINCE YOU HAD
SOMETHING TO SAY,

94
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,916
I ASSUMED YOU WERE 
GOING TO APOLOGIZE.

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,250
I DON'T INTEND TO
LET YOU HAVE MY DAUGHTER.

96
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,125
IF THAT'S UNDERSTOOD,
THEN LEAVE RIGHT NOW!

97
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,416
- HOLD ON, FATHER!

98
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,375
- IT IS TRUE.

99
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,000
IT IS TRUE THAT
I WAS THE ONE

100
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,666
WHO BROKE THE PROMISE
TO YOUR FAMILY.

101
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,083
SO YOU COULD SAY THAT WE'RE
NOT REALLY ENGAGED ANYMORE.

102
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,916
AND I MAY NEVER BE
FORGIVEN FOR THIS,

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,625
BUT I...

104
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,625
I JUST DIDN'T WANNA
RUN AWAY ANYMORE!

105
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:50,875
FOR HER SAKE,
AS WELL AS MINE.

106
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,083
- SO THIS IS FOR AOI'S SAKE?

107
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,750
- Mayu:
HANABISHI-SAMA IS A PERSON

108
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,875
WITH A VERY GENTLE HEART.

109
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,333
GENTLE, YET STRONG.

110
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,375
I'M SURE IT MUST BE
BECAUSE...

111
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,041
HE'S KNOWN MORE PAIN
IN HIS HEART

112
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,666
THAN ANYONE SHOULD EVER
HAVE TO EXPERIENCE.

113
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,833
- I... HAVE NO FAMILY.

114
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,166
MY FATHER AND MOTHER...

115
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,083
WERE NEVER ALLOWED
TO BE WED.

116
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,250
MY MOTHER WAS SAID
TO BE UNWORTHY

117
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,250
OF CARRYING
THE HANABISHI NAME.

118
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,250
AND SOON AFTER I WAS BORN,

119
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:32,000
SHE AND I LOST MY FATHER
TO AN ACCIDENT.

120
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,458
IT WAS JUST THE TWO OF US.

121
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,458
BUT BECAUSE THE HANABISHIS
LOST THEIR ONLY HEIR

122
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,791
IN THAT ACCIDENT,

123
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,791
THEY NEEDED A SUCCESSOR.

124
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,958
SO THEY FORCED ME
BACK INTO THEIR HOUSE.

125
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,958
IT WAS THEN THAT I WAS
SEPARATED FROM MY ONLY FAMILY.

126
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,333
THERE WAS NO LOVE
IN THE HANABISHI HOUSE.

127
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:53,625
AND EVERY DAY I DREAMT OF...
- ( slap landing )

128
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,625
- ...BEING REUNITED
WITH MY MOTHER.

129
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,958
HOWEVER, THAT REUNION
NEVER CAME.

130
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,750
EVER SINCE THEN,
I'VE BEEN ALL ALONE...

131
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,083
WITH NO ONE TO RELY ON

132
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,750
AND NOWHERE TO RETURN.

133
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:22,916
I WAS LONELY

134
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,750
AND SAD.

135
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,541
IT WAS BECAUSE
I KNEW THOSE FEELINGS--

136
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,875
THE PAIN OF LOSING
ONE'S ENTIRE FAMILY--

137
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,291
THAT I ALSO KNEW THAT
I NEVER WANTED AOI-CHAN

138
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,791
TO FEEL THE SAME WAY.

139
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,291
THAT'S THE REASON WHY
I DECIDED TO COME HERE,

140
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,666
AND DISCUSS THINGS WITH YOU.

141
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,166
- SIR KAORU...

142
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,833
- IS THAT ALL
YOU HAVE TO SAY?

143
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,000
DID YOU HONESTLY THINK
THAT I WOULD JUST FORGIVE YOU

144
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,750
AFTER HEARING THAT STORY?

145
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,666
IF SO, YOU'RE A FOOLISH MAN.

146
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,083
- FATHER, PLEASE.

147
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,916
FATHER, PLEASE DON'T GO YET!

148
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,583
- AOI-CHAN'S--

149
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,583
AOI SAKURABA IS 
IMPORTANT TO ME.

150
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,333
NO ONE CAN REPLACE HER.

151
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,833
I DON'T WANNA LOSE
ANYBODY I LOVE EVER AGAIN!

152
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:03,958
- ( slightly gasps )

153
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,750
- I'M SORRY.

154
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,708
- KAORU-SAMA.

155
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,583
- WELL THEN, KAORU, AOI.

156
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:37,916
- HUH?

157
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,291
- EVERYTHING IS FINE.
- HUH?

158
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,375
- DESPITE WHAT YOU THINK,

159
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,375
YOUR FATHER HAS CHOSEN
TO ACCEPT KAORU.

160
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,791
- HOW SO, MADAME?

161
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,625
- IF HE HAD NOT
ACCEPTED KAORU,

162
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,791
THEN HE WOULD HAVE HAD
SOME SERVANTS

163
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,208
ESCORT HIM OFF THE ESTATE.

164
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,833
BUT YOUR FATHER CHOSE
TO LEAVE THE ROOM HIMSELF.

165
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,166
- ( crying )

166
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,583
- Chika:
BIG BROTHER...

167
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,583
WHEN YOU'RE HERE,
YOU KNOW,

168
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,958
I FEEL SO RELAXED.

169
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:30,458
AND I ALWAYS FORGET
ALL MY PROBLEMS.

170
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,833
- FATHER?

171
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,291
PLEASE FORGIVE MY LACK
OF MANNERS EARLIER.

172
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,250
- THE ONE THING
THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE NOW

173
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,458
IS YOUR SMILE, AOI.

174
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,333
BUT EVER SINCE
YOU RETURNED HOME

175
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,333
THE OTHER DAY,

176
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:13,458
YOU HAVE NOT SMILED
EVEN ONCE.

177
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,333
I REMEMBER THE DAY
YOU WERE BORN.

178
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:20,833
IT WAS WARM AND THE SKY WAS
A PIERCING SHADE OF BLUE.

179
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,833
MUCH LIKE TODAY.

180
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:27,000
THE COLOR BLUE HAS THE POWER
TO HEAL PEOPLE'S HEARTS.

181
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:30,333
IT'S SO KIND, SO PURE.

182
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:33,750
YOU WERE NAMED IN HONOR
OF THAT PIERCING BLUE. 

183
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,875
WITH THOSE VERY IMAGES
IN MIND,

184
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,041
I ACCEPT THAT MAN,

185
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,375
BUT I HAVE NOT FORGIVEN HIM.

186
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:44,541
IT'S ONLY THAT I ALWAYS
WANT YOU TO BE SMILING.

187
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:45,916
THAT'S ALL.

188
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,833
YOU ARE MY DAUGHTER.

189
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,666
YOU ARE MY DAUGHTER
WHO IS MORE PRECIOUS TO ME

190
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,958
THAN EVEN MY OWN LIFE.

191
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,125
- FATHER, I NEVER KNEW.

192
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,458
- THIS IS YOUR HOME, AOI.

193
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,916
COME BACK WHENEVER YOU WISH.

194
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,250
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

195
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,250
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR EVERYTHING.

196
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,916
THANK YOU, FATHER.

197
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,625
- IT SEEMS THAT EVERYTHING
TURNED OUT FOR THE BEST,

198
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:13,916
LADY AOI.

199
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,916
- MISS MIYABI, I APOLOGIZE
FOR TROUBLING YOU SO

200
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,750
ALL THIS TIME.

201
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,708
- PLEASE, RAISE YOUR HEADS,
THE TWO OF YOU.

202
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:23,541
I WAS SIMPLY DOING WHAT I FELT
WAS MOST APPROPRIATE.

203
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,041
WELL THEN, SIR KAORU,

204
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,000
I WILL LEAVE LADY AOI
IN YOUR CARE.

205
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,708
- HUH?
- MISS MIYABI?

206
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,083
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

207
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,333
- THE DUTIES THAT WERE
ASSIGNED TO ME ARE COMPLETE.

208
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,000
PLEASE FORGIVE ME,
LADY AOI.

209
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,625
I REALIZE THAT MY WORK
PERFORMANCE

210
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,583
COULD HAVE BEEN IMPROVED
IN MANY AREAS.

211
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,541
BUT IN ANY CASE,
I HOPE THAT YOUR LIFE

212
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,333
WITH SIR KAORU WILL BE
A HAPPY ONE.

213
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,291
- MISS MIYABI...

214
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,416
- WE SHOULD ALL GO BACK HOME
TOGETHER, MISS MIYABI.

215
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,916
BACK TO THE PLACE WHERE
OUR FAMILY MUST BE WAITING.

216
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,500
- I'M SURE THEY'VE GOTTA BE
WAITING FOR US.

217
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

218
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,750
- Chika:
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

219
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,250
WHY ARE YOU GETTING READY
FOR A PARTY?

220
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,416
DID YOU HEAR SOMETHING
FROM THEM?

221
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,583
- NO.  NOTHING JUST YET.

222
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,041
- THEN WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

223
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,041
IF THEY DON'T COME BACK TODAY,
THEN ALL THE FOOD

224
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,208
YOU GUYS ARE PUTTING OUT IS
GONNA GO TO WASTE.

225
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,375
- THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT!

226
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,166
I DON'T UNDERSTAND AT ALL,
EITHER.

227
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,958
- HEY, WHAT THE HECK DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING HERE?

228
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,833
- DON'T MIND THE MINOR DETAILS.

229
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,583
- COME ON, TELL ME WHY
YOU'RE DOING THIS.

230
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,833
- WE'RE DOING THIS BECAUSE THEY
MIGHT BE COMING BACK HOME TODAY.

231
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,083
- Mayu and Chika:
HUH?

232
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,250
- WE'RE PREPARING DINNER
SO IT'LL BE READY

233
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,750
WHENEVER THEY COME HOME.

234
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,375
SO WE CAN WELCOME THEM
WITH A SMILE.

235
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,291
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE A FAMILY.

236
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:45,583
- WHAT IT MEANS TO BE
A FAMILY?

237
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,333
- MM-HMM.

238
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,083
- Both: HMM...

239
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,916
- YOU TWO DON'T GET IT.
I DON'T BLAME YOU.

240
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,333
BUT YOU KNOW,

241
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,416
I'M SURE YOU GUYS WOULD GET IT
IF YOU LIVED HERE.

242
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,541
- WE'D GET IT?

243
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:58,958
- IF WE LIVED HERE?

244
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,291
- ( vehicle approaching )

245
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,416
- HUH?  OH!

246
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,875
- Both:
IS THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS?

247
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:03,916
- THEY FINALLY CAME BACK!

248
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,958
- ( all chuckling, panting )

249
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,916
- WE'RE BACK.

250
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,458
- WE'VE JUST ARRIVED HOME,
EVERYBODY.

251
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,958
- All: WELCOME BACK!

252
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,416
- MM,

253
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,583
THIS NICE WARM WEATHER WE'RE
HAVING SURE IS COMFORTABLE.

254
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,166
- IT DOES FEEL PRETTY GOOD.

255
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,000
- YEAH, I SLEPT LIKE A LOG
DURING MY LAST LECTURE.

256
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,833
- SO I'M AWAKE 
AND FULL OF ENERGY!

257
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,291
- OH, WILL YOU PLEASE STOP
DOING THIS TO ME EVERY DAY,

258
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,166
TINA-SENPAI?!

259
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,291
OHH!

260
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:44,583
- BY THE WAY, MAYU,
HOW FAR ARE YOU TAGGING ALONG?

261
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,291
- WELL, IF YOU MUST KNOW,
MAYU WAS INVITED TO SPEND

262
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,458
SOME TIME AT
HANABISHI-SAMA'S HOUSE TODAY.

263
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,875
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN "TODAY"?

264
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,291
IF YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,
YOU HANG OUT WITH US EVERY DAY.

265
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,583
- THAT'S MERELY A COINCIDENCE,
I ASSURE YOU!

266
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,916
- I DON'T REMEMBER ANYONE
INVITING YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE.

267
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,125
- MAYU MAKES HER OWN RULES
IN THIS CASE.

268
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,625
- DID THAT MAKE SENSE
TO ANYONE?

269
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,583
- ( laughs )

270
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,083
- ( squeaks )

271
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,916
- ( giggles )

272
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,166
YOU SEE?  UZUME WELCOMED ME,
SO I'M INVITED.

273
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,500
- WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON
ANYWAY, UZUME?!

274
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,750
- ( squeaks )

275
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,416
- IT LOOKS LIKE UZUME
HAS GOTTEN USED TO

276
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,125
MISS MAYU BEING AROUND NOW.

277
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,416
- ( sinister laughter )
"OPERATION: KISS THE SQUIRE

278
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,666
FIRST AS THE NIGHT
IS PROCEEDING" IS PLANNED.

279
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,541
- OH, HELLO THERE.

280
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:24,875
WELCOME HOME, EVERYONE.

281
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,750
- HEY, THERE, AOI-CHAN.
WE'RE BACK.

282
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:27,916
HUH?

283
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,083
- HEY, WHAT'S UP, HANABISHI?

284
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,125
- YOU'RE LATE, YOU KNOW?

285
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,458
- SUZUKI?  SATO?

286
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,041
- WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING HERE?

287
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,375
- Suzuki:
WE'RE MOVING, CAN'T YOU TELL?

288
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,791
- YOU GUYS ARE MOVING?

289
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,083
- SO THEN YOU GUYS ARE
GONNA BE LIVING HERE WITH US?

290
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,166
- Suzuki and Sato: HUH?

291
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,625
- WHAT THE HECK
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

292
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,458
- HEY, DON'T JUMP THE GUN
LIKE THAT, HANABISHI.

293
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,833
- ( sighs )

294
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:48,666
AHH!

295
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,666
GUESS I FELL ASLEEP.

296
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,000
- CHIKA-CHAN!
- IT'S CHIKA!

297
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,000
- ARE YOU STARTING
TO WAKE UP NOW, MISS CHIKA?

298
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,333
- MM-HMM.

299
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,333
OH, BIG BROTHER!

300
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,500
- JUST A MINUTE THERE.
WH-- WHAT DO YOU THINK

301
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,958
YOU'RE DOING WITH
HANABISHI-SAMA?! 

302
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,458
- I'LL LET CHIKA
KEEP DOING IT.

303
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,541
- YAY!

304
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,208
- I WON'T ALLOW THIS
TO CONTINUE!

305
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,041
GET AWAY FROM HIM
THIS INSTANT!

306
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,333
- WHAT EXACTLY IS
GOING ON HERE?

307
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,875
- MISS CHIKA IS A NEW TENANT,

308
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,041
AND SHE WILL BE LIVING IN THIS
HOUSE WITH US STARTING TODAY

309
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,375
- CHIKA'S A NEW TENANT?

310
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,208
- COME TO THINK OF IT,
SHE DID TELL ME

311
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,166
SHE GOT ACCEPTED INTO
A HIGH SCHOOL HERE.

312
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,500
- IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA BE 
TOGETHER EVERY DAY FROM NOW ON.

313
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,583
LOOK, THIS IS MY SCHOOL UNIFORM!

314
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:25,583
NEAT, HUH?!

315
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,041
- WOW!

316
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,625
- I WORE IT HERE, BECAUSE
I WANTED TO SHOW IT TO YOU.

317
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,083
- ( both chuckle )

318
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,583
- WELL THEN, TWO CAN PLAY
THAT GAME.

319
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,250
AH, HANABISHI-SAMA!

320
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,916
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO PULL HERE?!

321
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,125
- ( all scream )

322
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,625
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
KAORU-SAMA?

323
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,916
- HERE WE GO AGAIN.

324
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,541
- Tina: LET GO OF HIM!

325
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,208
- Mayu:
HELP ME, HANABISHI-SAMA!

326
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,541
THIS CAVE WOMAN IS
ATTACKING ME!

327
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,583
- Tina: WHO YOU CALLING
A CAVE WOMAN?!

328
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:51,916
AAH!

329
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,750
- Taeko: OH, MY GOSH,
I JUST NOTICED

330
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,416
THEY'RE ALL STANDING
ON CHIKA-CHAN!

331
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,416
- Aoi: OH, MY!
- Kaoru: HEY, GET OFF!

332
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,041
EVERYBODY OFF!

333
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,833
- ( meowing )

334
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,791
- All: CHEERS!
- ( glasses clinking )

335
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,125
- HEY, CHIKA, GLAD TO
HAVE YOU WITH US AGAIN.

336
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,208
- THANKS! I HOPE YOU'LL
TEACH ME LOTS OF THINGS

337
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,875
LIKE YOU DID BEFORE, MISS TINA.

338
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,750
- SURE THING! FEEL
FREE TO COME TO ME

339
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,375
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

340
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,041
I COULD TEACH YOU
JUST ABOUT ANYTHING.

341
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,166
- OTHER THAN
ACADEMICS, THAT IS.

342
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,500
- WHAT?!

343
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,291
- WHAT'S THIS?
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO HAVE

344
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,041
A PROBLEM WITH A GUEST
WHO'S BEEN OFFICIALLY INVITED,

345
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,041
WOULD YOU?

346
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,375
- UH--

347
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,541
MISS MANAGER!
( cries )

348
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,416
CAN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING
TO THE GUEST?

349
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,083
SHE'S BEING MEAN TO ME.

350
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,416
- PLEASE DON'T FONDLE
MY BREASTS.

351
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,541
- HUH?

352
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,208
SORRY.  BAD HABIT.

353
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,541
- THAT IS NO EXCUSE,
MISS TINA.

354
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,041
- NO, I'M SORRY!
HA HA, PLEASE FORGIVE ME!

355
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,375
- Taeko:
JEEZ, TINA-SENPAI...

356
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,625
- Mayu:
WHAT A SAD INSTINCT.

357
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,375
- WE WEREN'T INTRODUCED.
I'M RUKA SAIONJI.

358
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,541
- OH, UH, HELLO.

359
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,416
IT'S VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

360
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,166
I'M CHIKA MINAZUKI.

361
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,625
- ( wind blowing )

362
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,333
- IT'S NICE TO
SIT OUT HERE AT NIGHT

363
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:13,625
AND WATCH THE CHERRY BLOSSOMS.

364
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:14,833
- YES.

365
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,666
- THE STARS ARE BEAUTIFUL TOO.

366
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,666
- YES.

367
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,333
- OH.

368
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,791
- YOU KNOW, AOI-CHAN...

369
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,791
IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME,
THEN YOU CAN'T SEE

370
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,208
THE CHERRY BLOSSOMS
OR THE STARS.

371
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,541
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

372
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:31,541
I WANNA WATCH YOU
RIGHT NOW, KAORU-SAMA.

373
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,875
- REALLY?

374
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,083
- BOO.
- ( both chuckle )

375
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,333
- UH-- AAH.
AOI-CHAN!

376
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,666
- OH, I APOLOGIZE.

377
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,166
WERE YOU NOT ABLE
TO BREATHE?

378
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,333
- I COULD.
IT'S JUST...

379
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,375
WELL, YOU KINDA CAUGHT ME
BY SURPRISE.

380
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,833
BUT IT FELT GREAT.

381
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:48,833
- HUH?

382
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,000
KAORU-SAMA, HONESTLY.

383
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,000
- ( laughs )
SORRY.

384
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:56,500
BUT, YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T
MIND IF YOU DID THAT AGAIN.

385
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,708
- UH?

386
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,875
- ( singsongy )
WON'T YOU DO IT AGAIN?

387
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,333
- KAORU-SAMA,

388
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,708
PLEASE DON'T LOOK AT ME
LIKE THAT.

389
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:04,875
- ( laughs )

390
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,750
I'M JUST KIDDING AROUND.

391
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,833
- YES, I SUPPOSE.
- HUH?

392
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,125
- ONE MORE TIME.

393
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,666
RIGHT?

394
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,083
THERE!

395
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,708
( giggles softly )

396
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,666
- ( giggles )

397
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,416
- IN THE PAST,
I ALWAYS FELT VERY LONELY

398
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,708
DURING THIS SEASON 
OF CHERRY BLOSSOMS.

399
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,375
- YOU DID?  WHY?

400
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:35,208
- THE CHERRY TREES ARE
A FAMILY NAMESAKE.

401
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,166
AND THERE IS A LARGE ONE
WITHIN OUR ESTATE.

402
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,333
EVERY SPRING,
I ALWAYS LOOKED AT THE TREE

403
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,041
AND THOUGHT TO MYSELF,

404
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,875
"I DIDN'T GET TO SEE 
KAORU-SAMA LAST YEAR.

405
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,666
BUT MAYBE I WILL THIS YEAR."

406
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,166
I ALWAYS WONDERED IF
I WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE

407
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,625
THE CHERRY BLOSSOMS
WITH YOU SOMEDAY.

408
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,833
BUT SINCE WE'VE BEEN REUNITED,

409
00:19:56,916 --> 00:20:00,833
I WAS ABLE TO SEE THE FLOWERS
WITH YOU THIS YEAR.

410
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,666
AND THAT'S WHY RIGHT NOW,

411
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,875
I FEEL VERY HAPPY, KAORU-SAMA.

412
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,333
- AOI-CHAN.

413
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,083
WE'LL SEE THEM AGAIN
NEXT YEAR,

414
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,458
AND THE YEAR AFTER.

415
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,625
WE'LL MAKE SURE
WE ALWAYS DO.

416
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,000
- ALWAYS.

417
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,708
- YEAH.  ALWAYS.

418
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,958
- KAORU!  MISS LANDLORD!

419
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,875
YOU'RE OUT THERE, RIGHT?

420
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,416
LET'S PLAY A GAME TOGETHER.

421
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,750
COME ON!

422
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,625
- ALL RIGHT!
WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

423
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,250
SHALL WE GO BACK?
AOI-CHAN?

424
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,583
- SURE.

425
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,750
- ( theme music playing )

426
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

427
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,750
- HEY, COME ON, KAORU-SAMA.

428
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,583
I WANTED TO PLAY SOME MORE.

429
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,791
COME ON.

430
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,750
WAKE UP, KAORU-SAMA.

431
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,583
( sighs )

432
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,916
- ( birds chirping,
 wings fluttering )

433
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,666
- AHH!

434
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,291
I GUESS I FELL ASLEEP.

435
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,875
SORRY ABOUT THAT, AOI-CHAN.

436
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:58,916
MM?

437
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,916
WHAT'S WRONG, AOI-CHAN?

438
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,291
- UH, NOTHING'S WRONG.

439
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:04,416
- OH.
THEN LET'S PLAY SOME MORE.

440
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,625
- SURE.

441
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:07,125
- WHAT DO YOU WANNA PLAY NOW?

442
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:09,291
- UM... UM...

443
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,458
HIDE-AND-GO-SEEK.

444
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:11,625
- WHAT?! AGAIN?

445
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:13,625
- AW, HIDE-AND-GO-SEEK.

446
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:14,958
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S FINE.

447
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:16,791
- YAY!
