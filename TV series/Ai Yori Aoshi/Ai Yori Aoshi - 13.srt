1
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,291
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:41,208
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:08,791
- Aoi: I WONDER IF ORIHIME AND
HIKOBOSHI EVER FOUND EACH OTHER.

4
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,916
- Tina: ♪ BAMBOO LEAVES
ARE SWAYING TO AND FRO ♪

5
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,958
♪ BACK AND FORTH

6
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,875
♪ GOLD AND SILVER

7
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,708
THERE. HEY, TAE,

8
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,208
WHAT'D YOU WRITE DOWN
AS YOUR WISH?

9
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,250
- OH, ME?
I WROTE DOWN

10
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,333
THAT I HOPE I CAN
BE A BETTER COOK.

11
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:29,583
- REALLY?
-

12
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,500
I HOPE THAT I WON'T BREAK ANY
MORE DISHES TOO.

13
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,166
I HOPE THAT I WON'T LEAVE
ANYTHING TO ROT

14
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,416
IN THE REFRIGERATOR

15
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,750
AND I CAN PROPERLY LEARN
TO SORT THE RECYCLABLES.

16
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,458
WHAT ELSE? WHAT ELSE?
- YOU ACTUALLY WROTE DOWN

17
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,583
EACH ONE OF THOSE WISHES?
- SURE DID.

18
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,250
- WHAT DID YOU WISH FOR,
TINA-SENPAI?

19
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,791
- I KEPT IT SIMPLE.

20
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,875
I WISHED FOR THE HAPPINESS OF
THE ENTIRE MILKY WAY GALAXY.

21
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,666
- WOW.

22
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,041
THAT'S SO UNIVERSAL.

23
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,125
- AIN'T IT, THOUGH?
- ( both laugh )

24
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,875
- SO, AOI-CHAN, WHAT WAS IT
YOU WISHED FOR?

25
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,500
- HUH? OH, IT'S
NOTHING REALLY.

26
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:05,500
- HMM.

27
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,083
- COME TO THINK OF IT,

28
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,500
I'VE NEVER MENTIONED
THIS BEFORE,

29
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,916
BUT TANABATA IS
ALSO LADY AOI'S BIRTHDAY.

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,250
- All: YOU'RE KIDDING!

31
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,500
- MISS AOI'S BIRTHDAY...
- AOI-CHAN'S BIRTHDAY...

32
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,750
- All: IS ON TANABATA?!
- YES.

33
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,833
IT'S TRUE.

34
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,916
THIS IS A BIRTHDAY
I'LL BE SPENDING WITH YOU.

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,666
- HOW WOULD YOU SPEND
YOUR BIRTHDAYS EVERY YEAR

36
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,250
WHEN YOU WERE STILL
LIVING WITH YOUR FAMILY?

37
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:51,416
- WELL, NORMALLY,
AROUND THIS TIME OF YEAR,

38
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,083
MY FATHER AND MOTHER
BOTH TEND TO BE TERRIBLY BUSY.

39
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,083
LAST YEAR WAS
LIKE MANY OTHERS.

40
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,791
MISS MIYABI AND I
JUST HAD CAKE.

41
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,750
- HMM.

42
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,916
OH, I SEE.

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,875
THAT'S A PRETTY LONELY WAY
TO SPEND A BIRTHDAY.

44
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,916
HMPH.

45
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,750
ALL RIGHT THEN.
- HUH?

46
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,916
- WE'LL HAVE TO GET
EVERYBODY TOGETHER 

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,583
AND THROW A HUGE PARTY
THIS YEAR.

48
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,500
LET'S MAKE SURE THIS
IS A BIRTHDAY BASH

49
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:18,708
YOU'RE ALWAYS
GONNA REMEMBER.

50
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,208
- KAORU-SAMA.

51
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,708
- BUT YOU KNOW, A BIRTHDAY ALONE
WITH AOI-CHAN

52
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,208
DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE A BAD IDEA.

53
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,416
- KAORU-SAMA.
- HUH?

54
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,916
- KAORU-SAMA, 
I DO LOVE YOU.

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,750
- OH, AOI-CHAN.

56
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,666
- ( people coo )
- Woman: AWW.

57
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,333
- Both: UH...
( gasp )

58
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,666
- I APOLOGIZE.

59
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,375
I MUST HAVE GOTTEN CAUGHT UP
IN THE MOMENT.

60
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,708
WHY DON'T I GO BUY US
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

61
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,958
- UH...

62
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,791
- OH, PLEASE ACCEPT
MY APOLOGIES.

63
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:09,083
- I DON'T THINK
WE CAN BE AS OPEN AS THAT.

64
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:12,958
BUT IT'D BE NICE TO BE THAT WAY
IN PUBLIC AT LEAST ONCE.

65
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,583
I'M SURE THAT AOI-CHAN

66
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:25,583
WOULD LOOK GOOD
NO MATTER WHAT SHE WEARS.

67
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,625
WESTERN CLOTHES, HUH?

68
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:28,833
- Aoi: KAORU-SAMA.

69
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,583
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

70
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,208
YOU SEEM A BIT DAZED.
- HUH?

71
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,125
NO, I'M FINE.
- MY MISTAKE THEN.

72
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,833
HERE YOU GO.

73
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,125
THANKS A LOT.
( laughs )

74
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,583
( gasps )

75
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,250
COME TO THINK OF IT,
I DID HAVE A LOT

76
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,208
OF EXPENSES THIS MONTH,
DIDN'T I?

77
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,958
I STILL HAVE SOME TIME.

78
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:01,958
I'M GONNA DO IT.

79
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:13,125
- ( humming )

80
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,833
( gasps )

81
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,500
WELL, YOU'RE UP EARLY.

82
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:26,791
- UH...

83
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,208
- BREAKFAST IS ALREADY
PREPARED, KAORU-SAMA

84
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,250
- YEAH, SORRY ABOUT THIS,
AOI-CHAN,

85
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,125
BUT I'VE GOT TO GET
GOING RIGHT AWAY.

86
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,125
- YOU DO?

87
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,333
- I HAVE TO GET TO
THE UNIVERSITY

88
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,208
TO SUBMIT A REPORT AND
DO SOME OTHER STUFF,

89
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:38,375
SO I'M A LITTLE BUSY.

90
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,916
I WON'T NEED ANY BREAKFAST
TODAY, OKAY?

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,833
- OH, IS THAT THE CASE NOW?

92
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,916
- WELL, I THINK
I BETTER GET GOING?

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,541
- PLEASE BE CAREFUL
ON YOUR WAY.

94
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,458
- ( door slides )

95
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,958
- KAORU-SAMA IS REALLY LATE.

96
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,208
HUH?

97
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,750
YOU'RE FINALLY BACK HOME.
( laughs )

98
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:20,208
WELCOME BACK.
- I'M HOME, AOI-CHAN.

99
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,416
- IS THERE ANYTHING THE MATTER,
KAORU-SAMA?

100
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,583
YOU SEEM ABSOLUTELY EXHAUSTED.
- I'M NOT THAT TIRED.

101
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,125
- I'LL BRING YOUR DINNER
TO YOUR ROOM

102
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,750
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
- THAT'S OKAY.

103
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,291
I'M FINE.
- BUT...

104
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:39,416
- ( grunts ) 
I'M SO TIRED.

105
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:45,083
( light snores )

106
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,083
- ( knocking )
- Aoi: KAORU-SAMA?

107
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,750
BREAKFAST IS READY.

108
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,625
KAORU-SAMA?

109
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:11,333
HE'S BUSY TODAY TOO?

110
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,958
- ( metal clanging )

111
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,333
- HEY, THERE.  YOU'RE HERE 
BRIGHT AND EARLY, TEMP GUY.

112
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,916
- YOU BET.

113
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,958
- KAORU-SAMA.

114
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,333
OH, I KNOW.

115
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:31,375
KAORU-SAMA SEEMED SO
EXHAUSTED YESTERDAY

116
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,583
DESPITE WHAT HE SAID, 
SO THE ENTREES TONIGHT

117
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,083
HAVE BETTER BE
VERY NUTRITIOUS.

118
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,166
- THE SOY SAUCE IS LIMITED
TO ONE PER CUSTOMER.

119
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,333
I BOUGHT ONE FOR YOU
AND ONE FOR ME.

120
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,666
- I APPRECIATE IT.
- NOT A PROBLEM.

121
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,458
SO WHAT'S ON THE MENU
FOR TONIGHT?

122
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,916
- WELL, LET ME 
THINK A MOMENT.

123
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,166
MEAT, POTATOES, BROILED FISH.

124
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,916
AND DOES STEAMED SPINACH
SOUND LIKE

125
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,833
A GOOD SIDE DISH FOR THOSE?
- SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

126
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:57,000
OH, THEY'RE ALL
HANABISHI-SENPAI'S FAVORITES.

127
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,833
SO I'M SURE
HE'LL BE HAPPY.

128
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,833
- YES, I'D IMAGINE SO.

129
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,250
- Koaru: SWITCHING MODELS
IS NO PROBLEM!

130
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:08,791
AND YOUR PHONE NUMBER
WILL STAY THE SAME!

131
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,333
- ( chatter )

132
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,625
- Child: WOW, IT'S A BIG OLD
BEAR. CAN I HAVE ONE, MOMMY?

133
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,750
- I CAN'T KEEP DOING
STUFF LIKE THIS.

134
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,750
NO, QUITTING
ISN'T AN OPTION HERE.

135
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,250
SWITCHING MODELS
IS NO PROBLEM!

136
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,625
AND YOUR PHONE NUMBER
WILL STAY THE SAME!

137
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,375
- IT'S ANOTHER LATE NIGHT.

138
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,458
HE'S BEEN BUSY LATELY.

139
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,666
- ( engine runs )

140
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,375
- ( drilling )

141
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,375
- ( yawns )

142
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,291
- ( knocks )

143
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,208
- KAORU-SAMA?

144
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:15,208
I WONDER IF HE EVEN 
RETURNED LAST NIGHT?

145
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,541
HUH?

146
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,541
- GEEZ, I OVERSLEPT.

147
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,208
I'M GONNA
BE LATE FOR WORK.

148
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:26,250
- KAORU-SAMA.

149
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,583
( sighs )

150
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,250
IT FEELS AS THOUGH
IT'S BEEN

151
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,666
NEARLY A LIFETIME SINCE
I LAST SPOKE TO HIM.

152
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:59,750
COULD IT BE PERHAPS
THAT HE IS AVOIDING ME NOW?

153
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,958
HAVE I DONE SOMETHING

154
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,583
TO MAKE KAORU-SAMA
DISLIKE ME?

155
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:15,125
DID I SOMEHOW FAIL
IN MY ROLE AS HIS FIANCE?

156
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,708

THAT YOU'RE AN AMERICAN,
TINA-SENPAI?

161
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,041
- SURE AM.  HOW COME?

162
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,833
- AREN'T THEY USUALLY
BETTER SINGERS?

163
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,625
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
TAKE THIS!

164
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,583
ARE YOU STILL GONNA
KEEP MAKING CRACKS?

168
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,083
HEY, DID YOU SEE WHICH
WAY OUR BIRTHDAY GIRL WENT?

169
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,416

KAORU-SAMA

170
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
ON MY BIRTHDAY TOMORROW.

- Taeko: MISS AOI!
- HUH?

172
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,708
- IS SOMETHING WRONG,
MISS LANDLORD?

173
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,083
YOU KINDA BEEN DOWN 
IN THE DUMPS LATELY.

174
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:04,500
- WHAT? I DON'T THINK THAT I'VE
BEEN ACTING ANY DIFFERENT.

175
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,875
- IF YOU SAY SO.
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

176
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,583
WHAT YOU'LL BE WEARING
TOMORROW, MISS AOI?

177
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,750
MAYBE AN ELEGANT EVENING GOWN
OR SOMETHING?

178
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,375
- EVENING GOWN? BUT I--
I'M AFRAID THAT I'M NOT

179
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,708
VERY ACCUSTOMED TO WEARING
FORMAL WESTERN STYLE CLOTHING.

180
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,916
- OH, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
- WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE,

181
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,041
THEN WE'LL WEAR EVENING GOWNS
TO SPLASH THINGS UP.

182
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,125
- LET'S DO OUR BEST.
- ( sighs )

183
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,250
- IT'S FINALLY 
ALMOST THE DAY.

184
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'VE GOT TO DO THIS.

00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,291
HUH?

186
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,541
- KAORU-SAMA.

187
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,583
I WONDER IF HE'LL BE BACK
EARLY TONIGHT.

- OH.

192
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,458
- I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT
USING THESE DURING THE PARTY.

193
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,708
BUT TINA-SENPAI INSISTED
THAT WE HAD TO USE THEM NOW.

194
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:28,000
- HEY, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF.

195
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:31,041
SEE, I STILL HAVE PLENTY LEFT.

196
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,250
- ( panting )

197
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,541
I MANAGED TO EARN THE AMOUNT
I WAS LOOKING FOR.

198
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,625
( gasps )

199
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,458
EXCUSE ME,
WHERE'S THE OUTFIT

200
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,083
THAT USED TO BE DISPLAYED
OUT THERE?

201
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,500
- I'M SORRY, SIR,

202
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,083
BUT WE'RE CURRENTLY SOLD OUT
OF THAT PARTICULAR ITEM.

203
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,583
- WHAT? NO WAY. 
YOU'RE SOLD OUT?

204
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,000
DON'T YOU HAVE ANY 
IN STOCK SOMEWHERE?

205
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,416
- ACTUALLY, THAT'S
A VERY POPULAR ITEM.

206
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,000
WE'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO KEEP IT IN STOCK. 

207
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,833
IF YOU'D LIKE TO 
SPECIAL ORDER IT,

208
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,750
IT SHOULD ARRIVE 
IN ABOUT A MONTH.

209
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:08,791
- IN A MONTH.

210
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,666
IT CAN'T BE!

211
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,833
PLEASE, COULD YOU TELL ME

212
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,666
IF THERE'S ANYWHERE ELSE
I CAN FIND THAT OUTFIT?!

213
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,750
- KAORU-SAMA.

214
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:32,291
- Kaoru: THE VERY FIRST TIME
I SAW THAT OUTFIT,

215
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:33,416
I REMEMBER THINKING TO MYSELF

216
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,750
THAT IT WOULD LOOK
PERFECT ON AOI-CHAN.

217
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,791
THAT'S WHY IT CAN'T BE ANY
OTHER OUTFIT BUT THAT ONE.

218
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,500
- TO THINK THAT
HE HASN'T CALLED US YET.

219
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,625
- SENPAI SURE IS LATE.

220
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,250
- WHAT THE HECK DOES
HE THINK HE'S DOING?

221
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:59,041
- AT THIS RATE,
ALL THE FOOD'S GONNA GET COLD.

222
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,500
- Miyabi: LADY AOI,

223
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,583
PERHAPS WE SHOULD 
BEGIN WITHOUT HIM.

224
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:09,291
- UH, UM...

225
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,583
- WE'VE ALREADY WAITED
QUITE A LONG TIME.

226
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,791
LADY AOI.

227
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,666
- COULD WE JUST WAIT A
LITTLE BIT LONGER?

228
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,416
JUST A LITTLE LONGER.

229
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,916
- HMM.
- AWW.

230
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,958
- IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU WISH, LADY AOI,

231
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,708
THEN WE'LL WAIT.
- WE REALLY SHOULD.

232
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,875
A SMALL PARTY LIKE THIS ONE
WOULDN'T BE MUCH FUN

233
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,333
WITHOUT THE WHOLE GANG.

234
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:30,416
- GUESS WE'LL JUST
HAVE TO WAIT, THEN.

235
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,791
- KAORU-SAMA.

236
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,666
- WE'LL HAVE TO GET
EVERYBODY TOGETHER 

237
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,625
AND THROW A HUGE
PARTY THIS YEAR.

238
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,541
LET'S MAKE SURE
THIS IS A BIRTHDAY BASH

239
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,625
YOU'RE ALWAYS
GONNA REMEMBER.

240
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:49,125
- PERHAPS KAORU-SAMA TRULY 
DOES DISLIKE ME, AFTER ALL.

241
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,166
- ( door opens )

242
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,875
- HUH?

00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,583
- KAORU-SAMA!

244
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,125
- I'M SORRY.  I WANTED
TO COME BACK SOONER,

245
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,458
BUT I GOT
A LITTLE SIDETRACKED.

246
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:14,541
IT'S ALMOST OVER NOW,
BUT HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

247
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,541
- KAORU-SAMA.

248
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,750

250
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,750

251
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,291

- HUH?

272

- Aoi: "I WILL BE WAITING

KAORU-SAMA?

275
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,750
- HEY, AOI-CHAN.

276
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,666
WHAT'S WRONG?

277
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,458
- UM, KAORU-SAMA,

278
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,583
PLEASE, I ASK THAT 
YOU NOT LAUGH AT ME

279
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,375
IF AT ALL POSSIBLE.

SURE.

281
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:36,208
- DO YOU THINK
THIS DRESS SUITS ME?

282
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:39,291
- AOI-CHAN, THAT OUTFIT.

283
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,958
- WHEN WE WERE OUT SHOPPING
THE OTHER DAY,

284
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,166
I NOTICED YOU LOOKING
AT THESE CLOTHES.

285
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:50,291
AND I THOUGHT THAT YOU MIGHT
LIKE SEEING ME IN THIS.

286
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,500
HOW DO I LOOK?

287
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,416
( gasps )
- WATCH YOUR STEP THERE.

288
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,000
IT'S DARK HERE.

289
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,333
- PLEASE DON'T LOOK
DOWN, KAORU-SAMA.

290
00:18:58,416 --> 00:18:59,916
- HUH?

291
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,333
- I FORGOT TO BUY THE SHOES
ALONG WITH THE DRESS.

292
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,958
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

293
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,041
I KNOW IT'S
A LITTLE LATE, BUT...

294
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,958
- YOU GOT ME A PRESENT?

295
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,791
- YEAH, OPEN IT.

296
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,458
- WHAT? KAORU-SAMA!

297
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,833
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

298
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:23,541
- WELL, AOI-CHAN, IT'S FOR YOU
WITH ALL MY HEART.

299
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,291
- ( laughs )

- YOU LOOK EVEN BETTER
THAN I IMAGINED YOU WOULD.

301
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:48,958
- ( gasps )
KAORU-SAMA.

302
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,958
COULD IT BE THAT...

303
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:54,125
- YOU LOOK REALLY GOOD
IN THAT OUTFIT, AOI-CHAN.

304
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,250
- THANK YOU FOR
THE COMPLIMENT.

305
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,875
THANK GOODNESS.

306
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,916
- HMM?

307
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,375
- KAORU-SAMA!

308
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:07,958
( gasps )

309
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:11,083
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SEE
MUCH OF YOU LATELY.

310
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:14,250
SO I THOUGHT THAT
YOU NO LONGER LIKED ME.

311
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,541
( cries )

312
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,458
- I'M SORRY
IF I MADE YOU WORRY.

313
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,500
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

314
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,125
DESPITE WHAT HAPPENED,
I'M HAPPY THAT YOU AND I

315
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,916
COULD FEEL THE SAME WAY
ABOUT SOMETHING.

316
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,666
- AOI-CHAN.

317
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,916
- IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

318
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,916
- LOOKS LIKE
ORIHIME AND HIKOBOSHI

319
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,333
WERE ABLE TO SEE EACH OTHER,
OR SOMETHING.

320
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,750
- AND BECAUSE I WAS BORN
ON TANABATA DAY,

321
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,541
I ALWAYS FELT JEALOUS

322
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,083
WHEN IT CAME TO
ORIHIME AND HIKOBOSHI.

323
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,791
- WHY IS THAT?
- IT'S BECAUSE...

324
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,250
THEY WERE BOTH STILL ABLE

325
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,750
TO SEE THE PERSON
THAT THEY LOVED THE MOST,

326
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,666
EVEN IF IT WAS ONLY
ONCE A YEAR.

327
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:12,583
BUT NOW, I'LL ALWAYS BE
TOGETHER WITH YOU, KAORU-SAMA.

328
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,583
- THAT'S RIGHT.  NEXT YEAR,
AND THE YEAR AFTER,

329
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,125
AND MANY MORE
AFTER THOSE.

330
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,875
- MY WISH CAME TRUE
THIS YEAR.

331
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,375
- HUH?

332
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,916
- ( theme music playing )

333
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

334
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:23,250
- Mayu: HANABISHI-SAMA,
IS THERE ANYTHING AT ALL

335
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:24,416
THAT MAYU
CAN DO FOR YOU?

336
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,083
MAYU WILL BE GLAD
TO DO ANYTHING FOR YOU.

337
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:29,250
- Saionji: IT'S TIME.
- ENOUGH, SAIONJI!

338
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:31,125
DON'T INTERFERE!
- PLEASE WRAP IT UP.

339
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:33,083
- "AI YORI AOSHI:
SERVANT."
