1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,916
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,166
- HEY, MOMMY, CAN I HAVE
SOMETHING TO DRINK NOW?

4
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,625
I GOT THIRSTY.

5
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,916
- Mother: OF COURSE, DEAR.
JUST HOLD ON FOR ONE MINUTE.

6
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,833
HERE.
- Child: YAY.

7
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,916
- Kaoru: AOI-CHAN,
IF YOU DON'T MIND...

8
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,250
- Aoi: YES?

9
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,541
- Kaoru:
...WHEN YOU GET BETTER,

10
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,500
THERE'S SOME PLACE
I'D LIKE TO TAKE YOU TO.

11
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,583
- Aoi: KAORU-SAMA.

12
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,250
- I'M SORRY IF I FORCED YOU
TO COME ALONG

13
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,916
ON THIS SELFISH
TRIP OF MINE.

14
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,458
- OH, PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT.

15
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,000
I REALLY DON'T MIND AT ALL.

16
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,000
ON THE CONTRARY,
THE FACT YOU AND I

17
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:52,000
ARE GOING SOMEWHERE ALONE
ACTUALLY PLEASES ME VERY MUCH.

18
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,000
I'M GLAD THAT YOU
INVITED ME ALONG.

19
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,083
BY THE WAY,
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

20
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,041
- HOW DO I PUT THIS?

21
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,250
WELL, WE'RE GOING TO 
SEE SOMEONE, I GUESS.

22
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,583
- TO SEE SOMEONE?

23
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,625
AND WHO MIGHT
THIS PERSON BE?

24
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,250
- YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO
WAIT AND SEE.

25
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,416
UNTIL THEN,
IT'S A SECRET.

26
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,541
- MM?

27
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,666
OH, YOU'RE SO MEAN,
KAORU-SAMA.

28
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,250
- ( chuckles )

29
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,583
- ( both chuckle )

30
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,583
- Kaoru: OH, AOI-CHAN,

31
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,250
I WANT TO TAKE
A SLIGHT DETOUR,

32
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,375
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?

33
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:25,625
- Aoi: SURE.

34
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,250
- ( children laughing )
- CATCH ME IF YOU CAN. 

35
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,125
- SLOW DOWN!
- NO WAY.

36
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,375
- HMM.

37
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,083
EXCUSE ME, MISS?

38
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,000
CAN I HAVE THIS
COOKED PUMPKIN 

39
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,583
AND THIS FRIED CHICKEN?

40
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:40,750
NO, SCRATCH THAT.

41
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,750
LET ME GET THIS
JAPANESE OMELET INSTEAD.

42
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,250
- SURE.  JUST A MOMENT, SIR.

43
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,666
- EXCUSE ME, KAORU-SAMA?

44
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,666
ARE YOU BUYING THESE AS GIFTS 
FOR THE PERSON WE'RE VISITING?

45
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,458
- HMM?
- IF THAT'S TRUE,

46
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,916
THIS PERSON MUST REALLY
LOVE JAPANESE FOOD.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,875
- ( sighs )

48
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,125
MAYBE TWO OF THESE.
YEAH, TWO OF THOSE,

49
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,583
AND I'LL ALSO TAKE A COUPLE
OF THE ONES OVER HERE.

50
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,916
- Aoi: A FLOWER SHOP.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,458
KAORU-SAMA,

52
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:14,791
WHO EXACTLY IS THIS PERSON 
THAT WE CAME HERE TO VISIT?

53
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,041
- Kaoru: AOI-CHAN?
- HUH?

54
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,416
- THANKS A LOT
FOR WAITING.

55
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,083
WELL, LET'S GET GOING NOW.

56
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,083
( sighs )
FINALLY HERE AT LAST.

57
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,875
THIS PLACE SURE IS
A LONG WAY FROM

58
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,125
THE TRAIN STATION, HUH?

59
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,583
IT'S THIS WAY,
AOI-CHAN.

60
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,458
- UH-- OH.  COMING!

61
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,583
THIS CERTAINLY IS
VERY COMFORTABLE WEATHER.

62
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,083
- YEAH.

63
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,916
- OH, LOOK, KAORU-SAMA.

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,875
MY, SUCH LOVELY FLOWERS.

65
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:06,583
- YEAH, ALL KINDS OF FLOWERS
BLOOM AROUND HERE

66
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,416
DEPENDING ON THE SEASON.

67
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,875
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED YOU
TO SEE THIS PLACE, AOI-CHAN.

68
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,416
I'M GLAD WE CAME
ON A NICE DAY.

69
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,458
- ( giggles )

70
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,583
( gasps )

71
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,583
THIS PLACE IS A...

72
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,916
- AOI-CHAN?

73
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,416
- ( gasps )

74
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,416
- AOI-CHAN,
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU.

75
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,958
THIS IS KUMI HONJO,
MY MOTHER.

76
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,750
I'LL GO GET SOME WATER,

77
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,250
SO WAIT HERE FOR
A MINUTE, OKAY? 

78
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,916
- ALL RIGHT.

79
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,916
I'M PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

80
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,625
MY NAME IS AOI SAKURABA.

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,375
Aoi: PLEASE, ALLOW ME.
- Kaoru: THANKS.

82
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,333
- Aoi: UM, KAORU-SAMA,

83
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,916
SO WHAT KIND OF PERSON
WAS YOUR MOTHER?

84
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,250
- MMM.

85
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,583
A VERY KIND PERSON.

86
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,125
VERY KIND.

87
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,583
EVEN AFTER I BECAME
PART OF THE HANABISHIS

88
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,875
WHEN I WAS FIVE,

89
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,750
SHE KEPT SENDING LETTERS
AS OFTEN AS SHE COULD.

90
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,916
- Aoi: IT SEEMS SHE
WAS A GOOD MOTHER. 

91
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,750
- Kaoru: YEAH.

92
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:05,916
BUT, YOU KNOW,

93
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,625
WE WERE APART SO LONG.

94
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,541
I CAN'T REMEMBER 
HER FACE CLEARLY.

95
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,625
IT'S KIND OF STRANGE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

96
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,916
I REMEMBER HOW KIND
MY MOM WAS, BUT EVEN SO,

97
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,541
ASK ANYTHING ELSE,

98
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,416
AND I HONESTLY WOULDN'T
KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU. 

99
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,583
SO WHEN I COME HERE,

100
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:37,250
I BRINGS THINGS THAT
I IMAGINE SHE LIKED,

101
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,583
AND I ALSO TRY TO IMAGINE
WHAT SHE WAS LIKE.

102
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,875
BUT IF YOU STOP AND THINK,

103
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:47,208
SHE MAY NOT BE ANYTHING
LIKE THE MOM IN MY IMAGINATION.

104
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,916
MAYBE I'M JUST
HOLDING ONTO THAT IMAGE

105
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,541
BECAUSE IT'S
MORE CONVENIENT.

106
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,666
- Aoi: I DON'T REALLY
BELIEVE THAT'S THE CASE.

107
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,250
I ALWAYS ASKED MYSELF
A SIMILAR QUESTION.

108
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,916
IS KAORU-SAMA DIFFERENT
FROM WHAT I REMEMBER?

109
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,416
I WONDERED HOW YOUR
INTERESTS HAD CHANGED.

110
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,375
WHAT KINDS OF TALENTS
YOU HAD DEVELOPED,

111
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,333
AND WHAT IT WAS THAT
YOU WERE CURRENTLY DOING.

112
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,791
I IMAGINED
SUCH THINGS AS WELL,

113
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,250
BUT WHEN WE MET AGAIN,

114
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,250
I DISCOVERED THAT YOU WERE
JUST AS I'D IMAGINED.

115
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:29,041
SO I BELIEVE
I CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY

116
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:32,666
THAT YOUR MOTHER MUST BE
EXACTLY AS YOU IMAGINE. 

117
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:35,916
- THANKS, AOI-CHAN.

118
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,083
- AND I ALSO BELIEVE
THAT I UNDERSTAND

119
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,875
HOW YOUR MOTHER
MUST HAVE FELT.

120
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,791
HER THOUGHTS WERE
NEVER FAR FROM YOU.

121
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,208
I CAN UNDERSTAND,

122
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,458
BECAUSE MY THOUGHTS 
WERE JUST LIKE HERS.

123
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,416
IN ALL THOSE YEARS,
THEY NEVER STRAYED 

124
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,625
FAR FROM YOU EITHER.

125
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:58,708
- OH?

126
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,500
YEAH, I GUESS THEY DIDN'T.

127
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,500
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

128
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,250
I'M GLAD THAT
I CAME HERE WITH YOU.

129
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,583
MOM, MEET AOI-CHAN.

130
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,916
SHE'S THE ONE.

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,250
THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON
TO ME IN THIS WORLD.

132
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,250
- WHAT'S THIS ABOUT,
KAGURAZAKI?

133
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,416
- Miyabi:
I APOLOGIZE, SIR.

134
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,541
HOWEVER,
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

135
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,750
I ASK THAT YOU RECONSIDER
THIS COURSE OF ACTION.

136
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,375
THIS IS A MATTER THAT CONCERNS
LADY AOI'S FUTURE AFTER--

137
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,916
- I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.
THIS DECISION WAS MADE

138
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,583
WITH AOI'S FUTURE IN MIND.

139
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,916
AS WELL AS THAT
OF THE SAKURABA FAMILY.

140
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
AS THE ONE CHARGED
WITH MY DAUGHTER'S EDUCATION,

141
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,583
YOU SHOULD BE SMART ENOUGH
TO REALIZE THAT.

142
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,875
YOUR OPINIONS
ARE NOT NEEDED.

143
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,041
THE ONLY THING
THAT I NEED FROM YOU

144
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,083
IS YOUR COMPLETE
OBEDIENCE.

145
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:00,583
DO NOT DISAPPOINT ME,
KAGURAZAKI.

146
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,250
- Miyabi:
I'LL EXCUSE MYSELF NOW.

147
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,250
- ( laughing )

148
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,625
- Taeko:
WHAT A SURPRISE.

149
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,416
WHAT?  WHAT IS
THE MEANING OF THIS?

150
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,916
- ( laughing )

151
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,375
- ( door opens )

152
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:36,125
- OH, IT'S RATHER LATE,
BUT WELCOME HOME, MISS MIYABI.

153
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,708
- YES, IT HAS
GOTTEN QUITE LATE,

154
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,916
BUT I'M BACK NOW.
- HI, MISS MIYABI.

155
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,250
I CAME BY TO VISIT.

156
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,000
- IT'S NICE TO HAVE YOU
WITH US AGAIN.

157
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,416
- HOLD ON.
DOESN'T YOUR GAME

158
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,666
STRIKE ANYONE AS BEING
THE LEAST BIT RIDICULOUS?

159
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,916
GOING BACK 50 SPACES
WHEN THE TIDE COMES IN,

160
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
MAKING YOUR FACE
LOOK LIKE A TUNA FISH

161
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,666
WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF FOOD,

162
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,625
AND FORCING YOU TO
LOOK LIKE A CLOWN 

163
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,375
WHEN YOUR CAMOUFLAGE MAKEUP
ISN'T PUT ON RIGHT.

164
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,583
HOW IN THE WORLD
CAN YOU FAIL SO MISERABLY

165
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,250
THAT YOU END UP
LOOKING LIKE THIS?

166
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,416
HOW, I ASK YOU?!

167
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,250
- ( laughing )
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

168
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,583
AS LONG AS IT'S FUN.
- Mayu: IT IS NOT ALL RIGHT!

169
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,333
- Tina: HEY, YOU WANT TO
JOIN IN, MISS MANAGER?

170
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,416
- HUH?

171
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,250
- THIS IS A BOARD GAME
THAT I MADE UP.

172
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,125
I CALL IT
"SURVIVE OR GO HOME."

173
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,583
I'VE EVEN GOT
A TOKEN HERE 

174
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,875
I MADE JUST FOR YOU.

175
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,958
- SORRY, NEXT TIME,
PERHAPS.

176
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,750
- Chika: I GUESS THAT MEANS
IT'S YOUR TURN NEXT, MISS AOI.

177
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,000
- Aoi: OH, SURE.

178
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,958
- Tina: HEY, YOU GUYS
WANT TO GO MOON-WATCHING?

179
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,125
- DO WE WANT TO GO
MOON-WATCHING?

180
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,416
- THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW IS
THE HARVEST MOON.

181
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,916
- OH, THAT'S VERY SOON.

182
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,250
- COME TO THINK OF IT,
I'VE KNOWN ABOUT MOON-WATCHING,

183
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,500
BUT I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY
GONE TO ONE BEFORE.

184
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,791
- YEAH, NEITHER HAVE I.

185
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,208
- THAT'S NORMAL, I GUESS.

186
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,583
YOU DON'T REALLY HEAR
TOO MUCH ABOUT PEOPLE

187
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,583
GOING MOON-WATCHING
THESE DAYS, DO YOU?

188
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,250
- I HEAR THE WEATHER'S
GONNA BE GOOD ON THAT DAY TOO.

189
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,000
SO LET'S DO IT. 
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

190
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,875
- IF WE'LL BE
DOING THIS TOGETHER,

191
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,875
LET'S HAVE A PARTY.
- MM.  YEAH, WHY NOT?

192
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,250
- ALL RIGHT!
LET'S DO IT.

193
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,166
- OKAY, THAT'S THE SPIRIT.
LET'S ALL GO OUT!

194
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,250
- Miyabi: LADY AOI?
- YES, COME IN.

195
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,750
- Kaoru: WHAT?
YOU'RE GOING HOME?

196
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,750
- I AM.
BUT MISS MIYABI AND I

197
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,000
WILL BE BACK BEFORE
TOMORROW EVENING.

198
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,333
- THEN THAT MEANS
YOU'LL COME BACK 

199
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,666
JUST IN TIME FOR THE PARTY.

200
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,250
- OF COURSE.
I'LL SEE YOU ALL THEN.

201
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,750
- THAT'S A RELIEF.

202
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,375
- IT WOULDN'T BE A VERY GOOD
PARTY WITHOUT YOUR COOKING. 

203
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,583
- DID SOMETHING HAPPEN,
AOI-CHAN?

204
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,000
- ACTUALLY,

205
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,708
MISS MIYABI HASN'T SHARED 
VERY MANY DETAILS ABOUT IT

206
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,791
WITH ME.

207
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,916
SO I'M AFRAID 
I'M AT A LOSS.

208
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:57,250
BUT I'LL BE BACK
VERY SOON, KAORU-SAMA.

209
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,166
SO THERE ISN'T
ANY REASON TO WORRY.

210
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,750
- LADY AOI.
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

211
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,583
WE'LL THEN, EVERYBODY...

212
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:05,750
I WILL BE OFF NOW.

213
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:18,041
- All: TAKE CARE!

214
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,916
- ( grunts )

215
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,250
- Kaoru: MOM?

216
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,583
MOM?

217
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,583
HOLD ON, MOM.
I WANT YOU TO MEET SOMEONE.

218
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,000
THIS IS AOI SAKURABA,

219
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,125
THE MOST IMPORTANT
PERSON TO ME IN THE WORLD.

220
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,458
WHAT?

221
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,666
AOI-CHAN?

222
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,583
HEY, WHERE'D YOU GO?

223
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,583
AOI-CHAN, YOU THERE?

224
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,041
( gasps )

225
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,583
MOM?

226
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,916
( sighs )

227
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,583
- ( knocks on door )

228
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,291
- Tina:
HEY, KAORU, YOU UP YET?

229
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,875
- JUST A DREAM.

230
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,125
- Tina: WE'RE STILL NOT DONE 
SETTING UP FOR THE PARTY YET.

231
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,666
HURRY UP AND HELP OUT!

232
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,916
- ALL RIGHT.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE, TINA.

233
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,916
( sighs )

234
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,583
- MORE TO THE RIGHT.
MORE MORE MORE MORE.

235
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,083
OKAY!

236
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,291
- ( giggles )

237
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,208
- THIS IS YUMMY.

238
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,500
- HEY, WAIT TILL THE PARTY.

239
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,208
- THEY SURE ARE LATE.

240
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,875
WHAT COULD BE KEEPING
MISS AOI AND MISS MIYABI?

241
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,083
- WE WON'T BE ABLE TO BEGIN
THE PARTY AS SCHEDULED

242
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,375
IF THEY TAKE MUCH LONGER.

243
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,000
- IT'S NOT LIKE THEM
TO BE SO LATE.

244
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,666
I WONDER WHAT
COULD HAVE HAPPENED.

245
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,291
- THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
MISS AOI'S BEEN HOME IN AWHILE.

246
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,791
IT COULD BE THAT SHE
DECIDED TO STAY AN EXTRA NIGHT

247
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,416
BECAUSE SHE WAS
HAPPY TO BE BACK.

248
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,041
I'M USUALLY
REALLY HAPPY TOO

249
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,250
WHENEVER I GET THE CHANCE
TO VISIT MY HOME.

250
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,416
BUT IT'S ALWAYS TOUGH 
TO SEE THE LONELY LOOK

251
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,250
ON MY MOTHER'S FACE
WHEN I HAVE TO LEAVE.

252
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,666
- I KNOW THE FEELING.

253
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,791
IT'S LIKE THAT WITH
MY MAMA AND PAPA TOO.

254
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,333
- AND CONSIDERING
HOW KIND-HEARTED MISS AOI IS,

255
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,333
I'M SURE THAT'S WHY
SHE'S NOT BACK YET.

256
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,708
RIGHT?  DON'T YOU AGREE?

257
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,583
SENPAI?
- HUH?

258
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,458
SORRY, BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

259
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,916
I AGREE.

260
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,750
- Tina: WELL, I GUESS 
THERE'S NO HELPING IT.

261
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,208
IT WON'T BE
THE HARVEST MOON ANYMORE,

262
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,916
BUT LET'S PUT OFF THE PARTY
TILL TOMORROW NIGHT.

263
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,958
- Kaoru: AOI-CHAN.

264
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,000
- KAORU-SAMA.

265
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,916
( Aoi crying )

266
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,916
- Kaoru: AOI-CHAN?

267
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,250
AOI-CHAN?

268
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,416
AOI-CHAN, IT'S YOU.

269
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,083
- KAORU-SAMA.

270
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,291
- AOI-CHAN.

271
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,916
YOU'RE FINALLY
BACK HOME.

272
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,250
WHAT A RELIEF.

273
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,791
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU.

274
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:58,833
YOU HAD ME WORRIED.

275
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,916
- I'M TRULY SORRY,
KAORU-SAMA.

276
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,458
I'M TRULY SORRY.

277
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:04,916
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

278
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,416
IT REALLY IS, AOI-CHAN.

279
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,916
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
APOLOGIZE.

280
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,625
YOUR COMING BACK IS
ENOUGH FOR ME, REALLY.

281
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,291
- KAORU-SAMA.

282
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,541
I-- I--

283
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,250
I CAN...

284
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,250
NO LONGER BE 
BY YOUR SIDE.

285
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,583
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

286
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:23,541
- ( gasps )

287
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,166
AOI-CHAN?

288
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,250
- I AM TRULY SORRY,
KAORU-SAMA.

289
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,541
THIS IS WHERE WE MUST
SAY OUR FAREWELLS.

290
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:38,916
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

291
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,416
I DON'T UNDERSTAND,
AOI-CHAN.

292
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,541
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

293
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,583
- GOOD-BYE, KAORU-SAMA.

294
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:45,750
GOOD-BYE.

295
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,250
- HEY, HOLD ON A MINUTE,
AOI-CHAN.

296
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,375
COME BACK!

297
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,375
- GOOD-BYE.

298
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,333
- ( panting )

299
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,625
AT LEAST TELL ME
THE REASON WHY, AOI-CHAN.

300
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,291
AOI-CHAN, WAIT!

301
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,375
AOI-CHAN!

302
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:01,916
IT'S THE SAME.

303
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,708
THE SAME AS BACK THEN.

304
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,250
NO.

305
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,583
NO!

306
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,375
I DON'T WANT TO
LOSE SOMEONE AGAIN.

307
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,916
NOT SOMEONE I CARE ABOUT.

308
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:23,791
- KAORU-SAMA!

309
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,250
- ( gasps )

310
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:28,958
AOI-CHAN.

311
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,875
Kaoru: I THOUGHT SO.

312
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,083
THEY'RE NOT BACK YET.

313
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:08,583
- Aoi: BUT I'LL BE BACK
VERY SOON, KAORU-SAMA, 

314
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,916
SO THERE ISN'T
ANY REASON TO WORRY.

315
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,291
- Kaoru: MAYBE--

316
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,958
MAYBE SOMETHING 
HAPPENED TO HER.

317
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:23,916
I JUST FEEL IT.

318
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,583
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

319
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,250
I'M GOING.

320
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,750
I NEED TO GO TO HER.

321
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,291
( gasps )

322
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:40,833
MISS MIYABI.

323
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,250
- COME, SIR KAORU.

324
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:46,291
IT IS IMPERATIVE FOR US
TO LEAVE RIGHT AWAY.

325
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,291
- Kaoru:
UM, MISS MIYABI?

326
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,250
IS AOI-CHAN STILL
AT HER PARENT'S HOUSE?

327
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,916
IT'S LIKE THE OTHER DAY.
SHE'S NOT TALKING.

328
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,250
I'VE GOT SO MANY
QUESTIONS.

329
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,625
- Miyabi: DO YOU REMEMBER...
- HUH?

330
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,916
- Miyabi:
I'M REFERRING TO THE TIME

331
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,583
WHEN YOU AND I
FIRST MET EACH OTHER.

332
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,250
- Kaoru: OH, YEAH.

333
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,083
- Miyabi: IF I RECALL,
SIR KAORU,

334
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,916
I UTTERLY DESPISED YOU,
TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST.

335
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,500
EVEN BEFORE YOU AND I
MET EACH OTHER.

336
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,583
DESPITE MY YEARS OF
SERVICE TO HER,

337
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,583
YOU, A PERSON WHO HAD
HARDLY BEEN BY HER SIDE,

338
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,208
WERE THE ONLY ONE THAT
SHE COULD EVER THINK OF.

339
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,125
IT WOULD NOT BE
MUCH OF AN EXAGGERATION

340
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:42,000
TO SAY THAT LADY AOI'S EVERY
WAKING THOUGHT WAS ABOUT YOU.

341
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,916
- YOU KNOW,
I'VE ALREADY DECIDED

342
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,250
WHO I'M GONNA MARRY
WHEN I FINALLY GROW UP.

343
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,416
- HUH?
- I'M GONNA BE MARRIED TO

344
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,666
KAORU-SAMA OF
THE HANABISHI FAMILY.

345
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,000
SO I HAVE TO DO
A BETTER JOB WITH MY LESSONS.

346
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,416
I HAVE TO TRY EVEN HARDER
THAN I AM NOW.

347
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,083
AFTER ALL, IT'S SO THAT I CAN
BE TOGETHER WITH KAORU-SAMA. 

348
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,416
- ( gasps )

349
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,083
Miyabi: LADY AOI SEEMED
TO THINK SO HIGHLY

350
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,375
OF THE HEIR TO
THE HANABISHI CORPORATION.

351
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,583
EVERY TIME SHE SPOKE
OF KAORU HANABISHI, 

352
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,000
IT ALWAYS
LEFT ME WONDERING

353
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,333
WHAT KIND OF PERSON
HE REALLY WAS.

354
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,916
YET WHEN WE FINALLY MET,

355
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,791
YOU WERE AN ORDINARY
COLLEGE STUDENT

356
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,625
LIVING IN A PITIFUL
APARTMENT.

357
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:22,958
I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN YOU

358
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,083
AND YOUR EXISTENCE
IRRITATED ME.

359
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,541
WHAT WAS THE POINT

360
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,708
OF LADY AOI BEARING
ALL THOSE DAYS OF HARD WORK?

361
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,125
WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE
OF ALLOWING HERSELF 

362
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,458
TO SUFFER SO MUCH PAIN,

363
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:36,791
SO MUCH ANGUISH?

364
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:39,708
HOWEVER...

365
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,666
LADY AOI.

366
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,916
THERE IS NO REASON FOR YOU TO
BE DOING SUCH MENIAL LABOR.

367
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,333
YOU ARE THE DAUGHTER
OF THE SAKURABA FAMILY.

368
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,916
- I DON'T MIND IT AT ALL,
MISS MIYABI.

369
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,916
REMEMBER NOW,
IT'S BEEN MY DREAM

370
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,583
TO TAKE CARE OF
KAORU-SAMA LIKE THIS

371
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,250
EVER SINCE I WAS
A LITTLE GIRL.

372
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,916
- HEY, THAT LOOKS
REALLY DELICIOUS, AOI-CHAN.

373
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,250
- OH, THANK YOU.

374
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,458
- WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT
TO TASTE A LITTLE?

375
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,625
- Aoi: SURE.  HERE YOU GO.

376
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:05,916
- Kaoru: THANKS.

377
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,916
- Miyabi: AFTER SEEING
HOW LADY AOI HAS BEEN 

378
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,250
SINCE SHE MET YOU--

379
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,583
WHAT SHE THOUGHT,

380
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:14,583
WHAT SHE FELT

381
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:18,125
AND WHAT SHE LONGED FOR...

382
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,250
I HAVE FINALLY BEGUN
TO UNDERSTAND.

383
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,875
I NOW KNOW YOU'VE
ALREADY BECOME

384
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:27,166
A PART OF LADY AOI'S LIFE.

385
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,958
- MISS MIYABI.

386
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,333
- IF THAT TRULY IS
THE CASE NOW,

387
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,625
NO MATTER WHAT
MAY HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE,

388
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,458
I PROMISE I WILL DO
ALL I CAN TO PROTECT YOU.

389
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,958
- ( end theme playing )

390
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,208
- ( singing in Japanese )

391
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,458
- Kaoru: MISS MIYABI,
AREN'T WE THERE YET? 

392
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:24,958
- Miyabi:
IT'S A BIT FURTHER.

393
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:27,458
- Kaoru: THAT'S WHY I ASKED 
IF WE COULD STOP BACK THERE.

394
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:28,958
- Miyabi: STOP OBSESSING
OVER THE PAST.

395
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,791
- ( Kaoru yelps )
I CAN'T BE PATIENT ANYMORE!

396
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:33,583
- Miyabi: NO, DON'T!
( screams )

397
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:34,916
- ( Kaoru sighs )
