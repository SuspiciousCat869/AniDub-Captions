00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:31,625

00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,041
- Tina: THAT LOOKS GREAT
ON YOU, MISS LANDLORD.

9
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,291
- UH, UH...

10
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,416
- YOU THINK SO?

11
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,250
OH, I THINK ALL OF YOU
LOOK VERY ADORABLE AS WELL.

12
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:53,666
- ( laughs ) 
YOU THINK SO?

13
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,000
- BUT OBVIOUSLY MAYU
LOOKS THE BEST OF ALL.

14
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,958
SEE? SEE?

15
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,958
SEE? SEE?

16
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,291
- HEY, WHAT THE HECK

17
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,875
YOU'RE DOING HERE?

18
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:05,250
- I'M HERE TO HELP
HANABISHI-SAMA, NATURALLY.

19
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,708
HE AND I WILL BE ATTENDING

IN ORDER TO RELIEVE
OUR ACADEMIC <i>ENNUI.</i>

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,083
AND THERE, WE'LL CREATE

00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,208
AN AUTUMN LOVE STORY
FOR OURSELVES.

23
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:16,416
WHY DON'T WE SEE WHAT'S
THIS WAY, HANABISHI-SAMA?

24
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,208
- ( chuckles )
HEY, WAIT FOR ME, MAYU-CHAN.

25
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,416
- OH! HANABISHI-SAMA!

26
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,583
- WHATEVER.
- LADY AOI,

27
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,666
WHAT IS THAT OUTFIT?
- OH, UM... 

28
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,125
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S TRY ON
THE OTHERS NOW! NEXT!

00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,750
- Aoi: THE PHOTO CLUB
WILL BE RUNNING

30
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,916
WHAT THEY CALL A COSPLAY CAFE
DURING THE SCHOOL FESTIVAL

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,916
THAT STARTS AT THE COLLEGE
TOMORROW.

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,541
THEY'RE JUST
TRYING ON THE OUTFITS.

33
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,708
- COME ON, HURRY UP.
TRY ON THE NEXT ONE. 

34
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,583
- OH, RIGHT.
- LADY AOI! 

35
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,750
- HEY, I JUST REALIZED
WE HAVEN'T SEEN KAORU.

36
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,541
- MAYBE HE ISN'T DONE
CHANGING INTO HIS COSTUME YET?

37
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,916
- KAORU, HOW LONG
IS IT GONNA TAKE YOU?

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,500
- ( gasps )
NOT YET!

39
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,125
- KAORU-SAMA?

40
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,875
- ( snickering )

41
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,875
- ( girls laugh loudly )

42
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,458
- YOU'RE SO FUNNY
IN THAT OUTFIT, KAORU-SAMA.

43
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,041
- WHAT A SURPRISE.

44
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,875
I'VE NEVER HEARD LADY AOI
LAUGH OUT LOUD SO FREELY.

45
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,583
- ( sighs )

46
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:26,083
I DIDN'T WANT AOI-CHAN
TO SEE ME LIKE THIS.

47
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:29,458
- PLEASE, SIR KAORU.
- YEAH?

48
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,583
- YOU REALLY SHOULD
HOLD YOUR HEAD HIGHER.

49
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:35,958
AFTER ALL, NOT EVERYONE 
CAN DO WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

50
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,125
- ( laughing )

51
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,208
- ( chatter )

52
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,750
- AOI-CHAN! 
MISS MIYABI!

53
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,125
I'M OVER HERE!

54
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,041
- AH, KAORU-SAMA.

55
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,291
- FEEL FREE TO COME ON IN,
EVERYBODY.

56
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,958
- WELCOME TO CAFE ANIMAL.

57
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,916
- ( guys chatter )

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,125
- ( grunt ) HONESTLY,

59
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,791
WHY WAS I RELEGATED TO
THE POSITION OF DISHWASHER?

60
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,125
I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE OUT THERE

61
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,458
WRITING THE FIRST CHAPTER
OF MY AUTUMN LOVE STORY

62
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,416
WITH HANABISHI-SAMA,
NOT STUCK HERE

63
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,833
SCRUBBING POTS AND PANS.

64
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,083
- ARE YOU SEEING
WHAT I'M SEEING, CHIEF?!

65
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,583
- I'M SEEING WHAT
YOU'RE SEEING, VICE CHIEF.

66
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:29,958
I NEVER THOUGHT THE COSPLAY CAFE
WOULD BE THIS POPULAR.

67
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,416
THE PHOTO CLUB'S IN THE RED
EVERY SINGLE YEAR,

68
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,458
BUT WE'RE FINALLY GONNA
BE IN THE BLACK NOW.

69
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,541
- OUR NEXT CLUB TRIP
IS GONNA BE OVERSEAS FOR SURE.

70
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:41,708
- Both: HUH?
- ( music plays )

71
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,875
- I'D LIKE TO THANK Y'ALL
FOR COMING DOWN HERE.

72
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,708
IT'S TIME TO INTRODUCE
OUR CAFE'S SPECIAL SERVICE.

73
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,250
IT'S SOMETHING 
WE LIKE TO CALL

74
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,458
SKIN-SHIP TIME
WITH THE CUSTOMERS!

75
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,958
- SKIN-SHIP TIME?
- IS THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS?

76
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,958
SO I CAN DO THIS?!

77
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,541
- AND I CAN DO THIS!

78
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:59,458
- Both: I'M SO GLAD
THAT I CAME HERE!

79
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,000
- IS THAT REALLY A SERVICE
WE CAME UP WITH?

80
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,708
- DON'T KNOW.
- I THINK IT'S TIME

81
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,541
WE START GETTING 
THE BALL ROLLING.

82
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:06,666
HOPE YOU ENJOY THIS!

83
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:08,791
- HUH?

84
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,041
- Both: IT'S A BOA CONSTRICTOR!

85
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,583
- HUH? ( squeals )

86
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,500
- ( screaming )
- A LIZARD!

87
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,708
I HATE LIZARDS!
( screams )

88
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,958
- HUH?
- ( screaming )

89
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

90
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,000
- HUH? WHAT?

91
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,833
- WHAT THE HECK
WERE YOU THINKING, TINA?

92
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,541
NOW THE PLACE IS
COMPLETELY WRECKED.

93
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,083
AND THERE'S NO WAY
ANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS

94
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,166
WOULD WANT
TO COME BACK HERE.

95
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,708
- I KNOW YOU LOVE ANIMALS

96
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,083
AND I KNOW
IT'S THE CAFE'S NAME,

97
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,125
BUT WHAT'S WITH
THE SNAKES AND LIZARDS?

98
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,541
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I JUST THOUGHT THEY WERE CUTE

99
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,083
AND PEOPLE WOULD LIKE 'EM.
- ( hissing )

100
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,750
- AND I WENT OUT OF MY WAY
TO RENT 'EM TOO.

101
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,666
- I DON'T THINK TINA
HAD BAD INTENTIONS. 

102
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,958
SHE DID HAVE THE CAFE'S
BEST INTEREST IN MIND.

103
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,000
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

104
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,791
I KNEW YOU WOULD
UNDERSTAND, KAORU.

105
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,000
- AAH! GET IT AWAY!

106
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,666
- Sizuki: BUT THE FESTIVAL
LASTS FOR THREE DAYS,

107
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,125
INCLUDING TODAY.

108
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,500
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

109
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,416
- ( all sigh )

110
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,916
- Aoi: NOW, NOW.
- All: HUH?

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,125
- DON'T BE SO DEPRESSED.

112
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,375
YOU SHOULD ALL HAVE SOME TEA
AND CHEER UP.

113
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,916
- ( sipping )

114
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,458
( contented sighs )

115
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,083
- THAT HITS THE SPOT.

116
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,875
- DELICIOUS.

117
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,916
- I'VE NEVER HAD ANY KIND
OF JAPANESE TEA

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,416
THAT WAS THIS GOOD BEFORE.

119
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,125
- THIS TEA REALLY
IS DELICIOUS.

120
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,166
IT'S JUST LIKE
EVERYTHING ELSE YOU MAKE.

121
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,583
- THANK YOU FOR
THE COMPLIMENT.

122
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,083
- ( sighs )
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE NICE TEA

123
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,833
ONCE WE'RE JAPANESE.
- SINCE WHEN

124
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,875
HAVE YOU BEEN JAPANESE?
SINCE WHEN?!

125
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,125
- YEAH, THIS TEA 
REALLY WAS TASTY.

126
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,625
- IT SURE WAS,
BUT WE ONLY HAD

127
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,333
THE CHEAP STUFF
AROUND HERE, DIDN'T WE?

128
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:45,875
- EVEN WHEN WE USE
THE SAME TEA,

129
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,083
MINE NEVER TASTES AS GOOD
AS MISS AOI'S.

130
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,250
IT'S A MYSTERY OF LIFE,
I GUESS.

131
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,583
- THAT'S THE ANSWER!

132
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,416
THIS IS IT!
THAT'S WHAT WE'LL DO.

133
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,625
MISS LANDLORD.
- WHAT?

134
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,625
- ( hammering )

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,541
( hammering continues )

136
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,666
- HMM, THERE. 
IT'S ALL DONE.

137
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,708
- Aoi: EXCUSE ME.

138
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,250
I'M SORRY, BUT THIS IS
JUST SO EMBARRASSING. 

139
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,041
DOES IT REALLY HAVE
TO BE NAMED AFTER ME?

140
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,791
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
MISS LANDLORD?

141
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,625
THIS TRADITIONAL
JAPANESE CAFE

142
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,416
JUST WOULDN'T BE RIGHT
IF IT DIDN'T HAVE YOUR NAME.

143
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,125
YOU'VE DONE A LOT.

144
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,833
AND YOU'RE LENDING US
OUR OUTFITS TOO.

145
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,916
I DON'T KNOW HOW
WE'LL EVER REPAY YOU.

146
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
- OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

147
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,291
I'M JUST GLAD THAT 
I COULD BE OF HELP.

148
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,416
DON'T BE CONCERNED.

149
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,750
- HEY, GUYS.  THEY'RE HERE!

150
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:38,791
WE JUST GOT THE OUTFITS.

151
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,875
HERE YOU GO, TAE.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

152
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,625
- WHOOHOO.

153
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,583
- THIS IS REALLY STARTING
TO LOOK AUTHENTIC.

154
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,500
- HMM, SOMETHING WRONG,
HANABISHI?

155
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:57,000
- N-- NO.
IT'S NOTHING, SATO.

156
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,791
- HEY, DON'T
SPACE OUT ON US.

157
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,625
WE GOT TO FINISH EVERYTHING
WE NEED FOR THE CAFE TODAY.

158
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,791
- ( strained )
YEAH, I KNOW WE DO.

159
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,083
- Tina: MISS LANDLORD,
WE CAN'T HAVE UNDERWEAR ON

160
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,208
WHEN WE WEAR
JAPANESE CLOTHES, RIGHT?

161
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,333
- IS THAT SO?
- TELL ME IT'S NOT TRUE?!

162
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:22,541
- OF COURSE NOT. WEARING
UNDERGARMENTS IS PERFECTLY FINE.

163
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,791
I THINK FOR YOU,
HAVING SOME SUPPORT

164
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,291
AROUND THE CHEST
WOULD BE GOOD.

165
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,541
- YOU'RE A REAL
LUCKY GIRL

166
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,625
TO HAVE SUCH BIG BOOBIES, TAE.
- NO.

167
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:36,583
- TAKE THAT!
- OH, STOP IT, TINA-SEMPAI.

168
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,916
- LADY AOI, THE TEA ROOM
IS NOW READY TO BE USED.

169
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,791
- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE?
THE CAT OR THE MOUSE?

170
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,416
- I DON'T WANT
TO BE EITHER!

171
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,041
- I ASSUME THAT ALL OF YOU
WILL TAKE A WHILE LONGER.

172
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,125
- I APOLOGIZE.

173
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,833
I WILL NOW BE
TEACHING YOU ALL

174
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:55,041
THE FUNDAMENTALS
OF THE TEA CEREMONY.

175
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:01,250
THE TRADITIONS AND ETIQUETTE
ARE NOT DIFFICULT TO LEARN. 

176
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,750
THERE'S NO NEED FOR YOU ALL
TO BE SO TENSE.

177
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,500
- IT'S NOT THAT
I'M TENSE!

178
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,666
- MY FEET
ARE FALLING ASLEEP!

179
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,208
- THIS IS WHY
I HATE TATAMI FLOORS!

180
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:13,916
- ( both strain )
MY LEGS, MY LEGS!

181
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,041
- WOW.
- ( grunts )

182
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,166
- HEY, LOOK OVER THERE,
TINA-SEMPAI.

183
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,166
- HUH?

184
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,583
- DON'T YOU THINK
HANABISHI-SEMPAI

185
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,333
LOOKS VERY NATURAL THERE?

186
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:25,083
- HOW CAN HE JUST SIT THERE
LIKE THAT WITH NO PROBLEM? 

187
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,708
- Both: OH.

188
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,416
- TO BEGIN,
I WILL SHOW YOU ALL

189
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,791
HOW ONE MUST MIX THE TEA.

190
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,833
- Girls: OH.
- ( water pours )

191
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,041
- ( all gasp )

192
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,041
- SO FIRST OF ALL,
I WOULD LIKE

193
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,458
FOR YOU TO TRY
DOING THIS.

194
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,625
- YUCK!

195
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,416
- ( laughs )

196
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,541
- ( overlapping chatter ) 
- BY THE END OF THE NIGHT,

197
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,541
THEY MUST BE ABLE
TO DO THIS, CORRECT?

198
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,375
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- ( arguing )

199
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,958
( loud chatter continues )

200
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,125
- HUH?

201
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,375
- I SWORE THAT I'D NEVER

202
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,958
WEAR TRADITIONAL
JAPANESE CLOTHES AGAIN.

203
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,000
THE SCARS ON MY BACK...

204
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,208
THEY HURT.

205
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,416
IT HURTS.
- ( heartbeats )

206
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,416
- IT HURTS.

207
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,458
- KAORU-SAMA.

208
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,916
- OH, AOI-CHAN,
IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?

209
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,083
- I'M SORRY.
- HMM?

210
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,500
- I DIDN'T REALIZE EARLIER,

211
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,958
BUT THIS MUST HAVE
BROUGHT BACK

212
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,083
SOME PAINFUL
MEMORIES FOR YOU.

213
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,500
- IT'S OKAY, AOI-CHAN.

214
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,708
I REALLY DON'T MIND
DOING THIS AT ALL, HONESTLY.

215
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,833
HEY, COME ON,
WE'D BETTER GO BACK.

216
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,541
WE COULD CATCH
A COLD OUT HERE.

217
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,583
- I'M SORRY, KAORU-SAMA.

218
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:08,916
- HUH?

219
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,125
- I'M SORRY, KAORU-SAMA.

220
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,958
( cries )
IF ONLY I COULD JUST--

221
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,708
IF ONLY I COULD JUST
TAKE YOUR GRIEF AND PAIN

222
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,916
AND BEAR THEM IN YOUR PLACE,
I WOULD DO SO IN AN INSTANT.

223
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,083
( cries )

224
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,083
- AOI-CHAN.

225
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,583
- BUT I CAN'T.

226
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,291
HOWEVER, DON'T FORGET 
THAT I AM YOUR FIANCÉ.

227
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,416
AND AS YOUR FIANCÉ,
I CAN AT LEAST

228
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,416
SHARE THESE FEELINGS
WITH YOU.

229
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,708
SO, KAORU-SAMA,
PLEASE UNDERSTAND

230
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,958
THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO SUFFER
ALONE, NOT ANYMORE.

231
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,416
- OKAY.

232
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,791
- ( chatter )

233
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,666
- Both: THIS IS SO GOOD!
- WOW.

234
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,666
I NEVER KNEW THAT TEA
COULD TASTE SO GOOD. 

235
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,750
- CAN I HAVE
ANOTHER CUP, PLEASE?

236
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,250
- YEAH, ME TOO.
- AND ME!

237
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,666
- OH, SURE.
PLEASE WAIT A MOMENT

238
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,458
WHILE I GET SOME MORE.

239
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,208
- ARE YOU SEEING
WHAT I'M SEEING, CHIEF?

240
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,791
- I'M SEEING WHAT
YOU'RE SEEING, VICE CHIEF.

241
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,750
IT LOOKS LIKE MY GUT INSTINCT
WAS RIGHT ABOUT THIS.

242
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,625
WE'RE GONNA BE IN THE BLACK
THIS TIME FOR SURE.

243
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,708
- AND NOW THE PHOTO CLUB'S
FIRST OVERSEAS TRIP

244
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:41,500
IS GONNA BECOME A REALITY!

245
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,916
- HEY, I HEAR THAT THERE'S
THIS REALLY CUTE GIRL

246
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,625
WORKING AT
THE PHOTO CLUB'S CAFE.

247
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,750
- SERIOUSLY? LET'S GO
CHECK IT OUT THEN.

248
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,958
- LOOKS LIKE WE'LL 
HAVE MORE CUSTOMERS

249
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,333
THAN WE EXPECTED.

250
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,166
HMM? HUH?

251
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,833
- Chika: HI, BIG BROTHER.

252
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,125
- CHIKA-CHAN.

253
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,625
- MISS CHIKA, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE TODAY?

254
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:05,916
- ( giggles )

255
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
TAEKO WAS NICE ENOUGH 
TO SEND ME THIS FLYER.

256
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,000
HEY THERE, GUYS.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

257
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,833
- OH, IT'S CHIKA!

258
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,708
- THANK YOU, SIR.
COME BACK AGAIN.

259
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,333
- I APOLOGIZE.

260
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,333
YOU CAME HERE TO ENJOY
THE SCHOOL FESTIVAL

261
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,583
AND NOW WE'RE
MAKING YOU WORK.

262
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,166
- DON'T WORRY.
I DON'T MIND. 

263
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,458
- WE'RE TOTALLY OUT OF TEA.

264
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,125
CAN SOMEONE GO OUT
AND GET SOME MORE?

265
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,583
- SORRY TO RUSH YOU GUYS,
BUT WE'RE OUT OF CUPS.

266
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:32,916
SO COULD YOU HURRY
BACK THERE?

267
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,416
- I CAN'T FIND
ANY TEA CANDIES.

268
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,708
WHERE ARE THE EXTRA ONES?

269
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,916
- I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
JUST GIVE ME A MOMENT.

270
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,375
- MISS LANDLORD,
GOT SOME TIME?

271
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,166
- YES, WHAT CAN
I DO FOR YOU?

272
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,833
- YOU CAN TAKE A BREAK,
MISS LANDLORD.

273
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,708
SATO AND ME
HAVE GOT THINGS COVERED.

274
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:51,791
- NO, I COULDN'T.

275
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,250
- HEY, YOU'VE BEEN
WORKING NON-STOP

276
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,291
SINCE EARLY THIS MORNING,
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

277
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,166
- TINA AND THE OTHERS
ARE GETTING THE HANG OF THINGS.

278
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,791
- I SUPPOSE THAT'S TRUE.

279
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,083
I BELIEVE I WILL TAKE YOU UP
ON YOUR OFFER.

280
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,791
OH.  ( laughs )

281
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,833
KAORU-SAMA!

282
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,625
- HEY, AOI-CHAN.

283
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,166
- THANK YOU FOR
YOUR HARD WORK.

284
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,916
- SURE THING.
HOW'S THE CAFE DOING?

285
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,375
- VERY WELL ACTUALLY.

286
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,500
EVERYONE IS DOING THEIR BEST
JUST TRYING TO KEEP UP

287
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:21,916
WITH ALL THE CUSTOMERS 
THAT WE'VE BEEN GETTING

288
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,583
THANKS TO YOUR ADVERTISING.
- Man: TAKOYAKI!

289
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,500
- I SEE.  THAT'S GREAT.
- DELICIOUS TAKOYAKI!

290
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,583
- WHY DON'T WE HAVE
SOME TAKOYAKI, AOI-CHAN?

291
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,125
IT IS ALMOST LUNCHTIME.

292
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,625
- SURE.

293
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,833
WOW, THEY LOOK DELICIOUS.

294
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,791
- THEY'RE HOT, SO BE CAREFUL.

295
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,791
- ( blows )

296
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,666
UM, ACTUALLY, KAORU-SAMA,
YOU FIRST.

297
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,541
- HUH?

298
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,083
- Tina: MISS LANDLORD!

299
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,708
OH, THERE YOU ARE.

300
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,875
WE'VE GOT A BIG PROBLEM,
MISS LANDLORD.

301
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,125
IT LOOKS LIKE TAE
SPILLED THE TEA AGAIN.

302
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,208
- HUH?

303
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,708
- I'M SORRY, BUT CAN YOU
COME BACK NOW?

304
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,833
- YES, OF COURSE.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

305
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,333
I APOLOGIZE, KAORU-SAMA.

306
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,250
- AND WE FINALLY HAD
SOME TIME ALONE TOO.

307
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,250
UH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

308
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,458
- HEY, WATCH
WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

309
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,791
- GEEZ, ARE YOU OKAY, HIRO?

310
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:30,083
- Aoi: I GUESS I'LL GO
DELIVER THIS ORDER THEN.

311
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,583
- THE COMEDY CLUB
IS THE CLASSROOM

312
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,875
AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY

313
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,916
ON THE RIGHT SIDE.
DON'T GO TO THE WRONG PLACE.

314
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,458
- RIGHT.

315
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,500
- ( light chatter )

316
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,916
- I'M BACK.
- YO', GOOD WORK.

317
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,666
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
SOME TIME OFF FOR NOW?

318
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,083
- SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

319
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,250
I THINK I'LL GO TAKE 
A WALK AROUND CAMPUS.

320
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,708
- HI, BIG BROTHER.
- HEY THERE, CHIKA-CHAN.

321
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,166
WANT TO COME FOR A WALK?
- I ABSOLUTELY

322
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,458
WILL NOT ALLOW THAT!

323
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,583
HANABISHI-SAMA AND I
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE WRITING

324
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:00,208
THE CONCLUSION TO OUR AUTUMN
LOVE STORY TOGETHER.

325
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,791
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
OVER HERE?

326
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,708
IT'S NOT TIME FOR
YOUR BREAK YET, LITTLE MISSY.

327
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,708
- I DON'T CARE IF IT'S
NOT TIME FOR MY BREAK!

328
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,625
THERE'S PLENTY OF DISHES
LEFT FOR YOU TO WASH!

329
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,083
- LET ME GO!

330
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,583
- LET'S GO THIS WAY,
BIG BROTHER.

331
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,125
- ( gasps )
- DON'T TUG SO HARD.

332
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,916
- SORRY, I HAVEN'T
EATEN IN A WHILE. 

333
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
AND I'M REALLY STARVING.
- KAORU-SAMA.

334
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,333
OH.

335
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,250
KAORU-SAMA!
- AH!

336
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,541
( grunts )

337
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,916
- YOU'RE OKAY, RIGHT?

338
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,625
KAORU-SAMA.
( gasps )

339
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:06,666
( whimpers )

340
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,375
- EXCUSE ME THERE,
YOUNG LADY.

341
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,166
THE FOUR OF US
ARE MEMBERS

342
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,416
OF THE MEIRITSU FESTIVAL
MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE.

343
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,291
- I SEE.

344
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,416

WE WOULD VERY MUCH

345
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,458
LIKE FOR YOU TO ENTER

346
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,166

349
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,416
PLEASE, WE BEG YOU!

350
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,583
- I REALLY HAD A LOT OF FUN
TODAY, BIG BROTHER.

351
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,208
- WELL, BE CAREFUL
ON YOUR WAY BACK.

352
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,458

353
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,916
AND I'LL COME BY TO PLAY AGAIN
SOME OTHER TIME.

354
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,250

355
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,916
WE'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU.

356
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,666
- BYE.

357
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,916
I'M BACK.

358
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,791
- THANK YOU FOR
THE HARD WORK, KAORU-SAMA.

359
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,416
- AND THANKS FOR
YOUR HARD WORK, AOI-CHAN.

360
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,125
WHERE'D EVERYONE ELSE GO?

361
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,750
- THEY WENT TO RETURN
ALL THE MATERIALS

362
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,708
THAT THEY BORROWED.
- OH, I SEE.

363
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,166
- WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HAVE A LITTLE TEA?

364
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,083
- HM-HMM, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

365
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,083
YOUR TEA REALLY IS GREAT,
AOI-CHAN.

366
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,208
- THANK YOU FOR SAYING SO.

367
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,625
UM, I BOUGHT THIS EARLIER
FOR US TO SHARE.

368
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:37,250
I WANTED TO HAVE
SOME TAKOYAKI WITH YOU

369
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,458
SINCE WE COULDN'T HAVE IT
AT LUNCHTIME,

370
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,583
EVEN IF IT HAS GOTTEN
A LITTLE COLD.

371
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,208
- HM-HMM.

372
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,125
- YOU FIRST, KAORU-SAMA.

373
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,041
- IT'S GOOD.

374
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,458
- I'M SO GLAD.

375
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,458
THIS IS VERY GOOD.

376
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:10,333
IT SEEMS WE FINALLY HAVE
SOME TIME TO OURSELVES NOW.

377
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,750
- YEAH?

378
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:15,208
- YOU KNOW, TODAY WAS TRULY
AN ENJOYABLE DAY FOR ME.

379
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:18,625
BEING SO BUSY AND INTERACTING
WITH SO MANY PEOPLE

380
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,458
WERE BOTH NEW EXPERIENCES,

381
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:24,958
BUT BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T
NEAR ME TODAY, KAORU-SAMA,

382
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,041
I WAS A LITTLE LONELY
WITHOUT YOU.

383
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,333
- AOI-CHAN.

384
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,500
YOU KNOW, WHILE I WAS
OUT THERE TODAY,

385
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,083
I SAW A LOT
OF COUPLES AROUND.

386
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,291
AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF
THAT I'D LOVE IT

387
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,916
IF WE COULD WALK TOGETHER
LIKE THAT

388
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,416
AND ENJOY THE FESTIVAL.

389
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,583
- WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

390
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:44,250
YOU FELT THE SAME WAY I DID,
KAORU-SAMA.

391
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,291
I'M SO GLAD.

392
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,916
MAY I ASK A FAVOR OF YOU?

393
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,583
- HUH?

394
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:00,958
- COULD YOU STAY STILL
FOR JUST A SHORT MOMENT?

395
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,416
- SURE.

396
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,708
- I'M SORRY, KAORU-SAMA.

397
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,125
- THANKS FOR
THE HARD WORK, GUYS!

398
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,125
HUH?

399
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,083
HEY, KAORU, MISS LANDLORD,

400
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,041
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG
WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

401
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,083
- NOTHING'S WRONG
AT ALL, TINA.

402
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,416
NOTHING, HONESTLY.

403
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,750
- ( giggles )

404
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:55,250
- ( theme music plays )

405
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:58,500
- ( singing in Japanese )

406
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:25,291
- Tina: WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM!
- Taeko: WHAT'S GOING ON, TINA?

407
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:28,041
- Tina: MISS LANDLORD IS--
MISS LANDLORD IS...

408
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:29,791
- Taeko: WHAT?!

409
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,166
AI YORI AOSHI,
"INFLUENZA."

410
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,583
- Tina: MISS LANDLORD!

411
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:35,916
- Aoi: WHO ME?
