1
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:34,166
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,416
- ( door opens )

4
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,083
- Aoi: YOU FORGOT SOMETHING,
KAORU-SAMA.

5
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,708
- I FORGOT SOMETHING?

6
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:12,458
- ( chuckles )
YOUR BENTO.

7
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,583
- OH, THANKS, AOI-CHAN.

8
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:17,083
I WAS ABOUT TO MISS OUT
ON ONE OF YOUR GREAT LUNCHES.

9
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:18,250
- ( chuckles )

10
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,083
IT'S FORTUNATE THAT
I REALIZED IT.

11
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,041
OH.

12
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:27,291
- IT'S SORT OF LIKE WE'RE
A COUPLE OF NEWLYWEDS, HUH?

13
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,583
- I'M HAPPY TO
HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

14
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,250
AFTER ALL, KAORU-SAMA,
YOU AND I ARE.

15
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,791
- Tina: KAORU!

16
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,416
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE TO OUR
CLASSES IF WE DON'T HURRY!

17
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,916
- WELL, GUESS I'D BETTER
GET GOING THEN.

18
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,791
- BE CAREFUL ON YOUR WAY,
KAORU-SAMA.

19
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,208
( giggles )

20
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,208
- ( bells ringing )

21
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,250
- ( sighs )

22
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,875
THANK GOODNESS
CLASS IS OVER.

23
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,208
WHY MUST JAPAN'S
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS

24
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:07,916
BE SUCH DULL PLACES?

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,833
HONESTLY, WHAT A CHORE.

26
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,083
( gasps )

27
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:16,250
HANABISHI-SAMA!

28
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,875
- ( screams )
- ( giggles )

29
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,375
- ( screaming )

30
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,250
( groans )

31
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:28,583
- IT'S BEEN SO LONG
SINCE WE SAW EACH OTHER.

32
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,833
MAYU WAS STARTING TO GET LONELY
AFTER NOT SEEING YOU.

33
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,166
( grunts )

34
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,250
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
"IT'S BEEN AWHILE"?

35
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,916
YOU'VE SEEN KAORU AROUND
THE UNIVERSITY EVERY SINGLE DAY.

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,500
- SENPAI.

37
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:43,166
SAY SOMETHING TO ME, SENPAI.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

38
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,750
HANABISHI SENPAI?

39
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,416
- ( groans )

40
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,250
- Mayu:
WHAT? A BENTO LUNCH?

41
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,916
- YEAH, I WAS THINKING
OF EATING MY BENTO LUNCH HERE.

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,250
- OH, NO.

43
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,083
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
FORCE YOURSELF TO EAT THAT.

44
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,750
I CAN TREAT YOU TO A LUNCH
MADE BY A TOP CHEF

45
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,208
AT SOME RESTAURANT.

46
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,333
- FOOD TASTES A LOT BETTER
WHEN IT'S EATEN OUTSIDE

47
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,791
WITH YOUR FRIENDS
THAN INSIDE SOME 

48
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,125
STUFFY OLD RESTAURANT.

49
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,916
- ( sighs )
- ( chuckles )

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,250
WELL, I GUESS
I'LL START EATING NOW.

51
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,958
- All: WOW.

52
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,333
- TODAY'S BENTO LOOKS AS GOOD
AS IT ALWAYS DOES.

53
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,250
- WHENEVER MISS AOI
COOKS ANYTHING,

54
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,583
IT'S SURE TO LOOK GREAT
AND TASTE DELICIOUS.

55
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,750
- HUH?
- IMPRESSED, HUH?

56
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,291
WHEN IT COMES TO
COOKING AND CLEANING,

57
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,208
NOBODY'S BETTER
THAN OUR LANDLORD.

58
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,125
I'D BET IT TASTES BETTER
THAN THE EXPENSIVE STUFF

59
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,458
YOU USUALLY EAT.

60
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,875
- WELL, I WON'T
BE ABLE TO COMPARE

61
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,166
UNTIL I TRY
SOME OF IT.

62
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,916
- ( yelps )
GET YOUR PAWS OFF OF MY LUNCH!

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,458
- JUST BECAUSE
FOOD LOOKS GOOD,

64
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,416
DOESN'T NECESSARILY
MEAN IT WILL TASTE GOOD.

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,250
- WELL?

66
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,250
- WELL, IT DOESN'T
SEEM TO BE HORRIBLE.

67
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,916
- FIRST YOU TAKE
SOMEONE ELSE'S FOOD

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,083
AND THEN YOU
WISECRACK ABOUT IT.

69
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,041
( groans )

70
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,500
- HEY, TINA, THESE SAUSAGES
ARE HOMEMADE, RIGHT?

71
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,875
- YOU CAN TELL.

72
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,166
I TRIED TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
A LITTLE SEA ANEMONE.

73
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,833
- IT KIND OF DOES, HUH?

74
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,666
- KAORU OVER HERE 
IS THE KIND OF GUY

75
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,458
WHO'S ATTRACTED TO
US DOMESTIC GIRLS 

76
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:00,916
WHO CAN COOK AND CLEAN.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,291
( chuckles )
- HMM.

78
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,583
- TAEKO-CHAN,
DID YOU MAKE THIS?

79
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,000
- THAT'S RIGHT.

80
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,333
IT'S TEMPURA THAT I MADE
WITH CHOCOLATE COVERED TOMATOES.

81
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,375
- All: HUH?

82
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:10,583
- IT'S REALLY
DELICIOUS, YOU KNOW.

83
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,416
- YEAH?

84
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,041
- TRUST ME,
IT'S DELICIOUS.

85
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,583
- UHH...

86
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:21,916
( gulps )

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,250
( sighs )

88
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,583
- RIGHT?

89
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,541
- RIGHT.

90
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,791
- Mayu: IS A BENTO LUNCH
REALLY THAT IMPORTANT TO HIM?

91
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,750
BUT IF IT MEANS THAT MAYU
CAN SPEND QUALITY TIME

92
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,750
WITH HANABISHI-SAMA,

93
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,083
THEN I'LL TRY IT.

94
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,333
IF HANABISHI-SAMA EATS
MAYU'S HOMEMADE LUNCH 

95
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:39,583
THEN I'M SURE...

96
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,791
- Kaoru: IT'S DELICIOUS!
TOTALLY DELICIOUS.

97
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,625
I WANT YOU TO MAKE
MY LUNCH TOMORROW.

98
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,416
NO, I WANT YOU TO
ALWAYS MAKE THEM.

99
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,875
- Mayu: I WILL IF IT'S
FOR YOU, HANABISHI-SAMA.

100
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,291
- ( crying )

101
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,750
- Kaoru: I LOVE YOU. I'M NEVER
GONNA LET YOU GO, MAYU.

102
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,833
- Mayu: I'M SO HAPPY,
HANABISHI-SAMA.

103
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,333
- ( crying )

104
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,916
- Kaoru: YOU CAN EVEN COOK
GARBAGE AND MAKE IT DELICIOUS.

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,416
- Mayu: OH, YOU ALWAYS 
FLATTER ME SO, DARLING.

106
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,958
- ( crying )

107
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,500
- Kaoru: I'M GONNA EAT YOU UP,
JUST LIKE I DID THE FOOD.

108
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,250
- Mayu: OH, NO!
( giggles )

109
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,875
- ( crying )

110
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,250
- ( giggles )

111
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,875
- THE FOOD'S DELICIOUS AND ALL,

112
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,875
BUT DROOLING
LIKE THAT'S DISGUSTING.

113
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,916
YOU'RE NOT GETTING
ANY MORE OF MY LUNCH.

114
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,125
- HANABISHI-SAMA,

115
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:23,083
IF MAYU MADE A BENTO LUNCH FOR
YOU TOMORROW, WOULD YOU EAT IT?

116
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,625
- WHAT?
YEAH, OF COURSE I WOULD.

117
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,875
- YOU REALLY WOULD EAT IT?

118
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,000
THEN MAYU WILL MAKE
A BENTO FOR YOU TOMORROW

119
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,416
AND BRING IT RIGHT HERE.

120
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,583
- THEN I'LL GO BUY SOME
ANTACIDS FOR YOU TOMORROW

121
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,458
AND BRING THEM RIGHT HERE.
- ( both groan )

122
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,750
- AND WHAT PRAY TELL
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

123
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,916
- GEE, I WONDER,
WHAT COULD THAT POSSIBLY MEAN?

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,916
- ( both hiss )

125
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,916
- Mayu: WELL, I SHOULD
START COOKING NOW.

126
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,166
LET'S SEE,
FIRST OF ALL...

127
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,875
I SUPPOSE I'LL MAKE
SOME SOLE MEUNIERE.

128
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:54,125
"POUR OIL INTO
A HEATED FRYING PAN.

129
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,833
SAUTEE SOLE FOR FIVE MINUTES."

130
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,916
( gasps )

131
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,333
DON'T MIND THAT!

132
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,666
( giggles )
THIS WILL MAKE IT MUCH EASIER.

133
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,208
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS WAIT 
FOR IT TO FINISH COOKING.

134
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,166
- ( dings )

135
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,791
- NEVER GIVE UP.

136
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,416
YOU CAN NEVER HAVE
A PROPER LUNCH

137
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,458
WITHOUT SOME RICE BALLS.

138
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:16,791
( gasping )

139
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:17,875
HOT!

140
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,083
THEY MAY NOT LOOK
TERRIBLY PRETTY, 

141
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,583
BUT THEY SHOULD DEFINITELY
TASTE LIKE RICE.

142
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:27,750
( murmurs )

143
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,666
THIS CAN'T BE HELPED,
I GUESS.

144
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,583
SINCE AFTER ALL,
I'VE NEVER HAD

145
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,208
ANYBODY TEACH ME
TO COOK BEFORE. 

146
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,916
- WHENEVER MISS AOI
COOKS ANYTHING,

147
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,250
IT'S SURE TO LOOK GREAT
AND TASTE DELICIOUS.

148
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,916
- WHEN IT COMES TO
COOKING AND CLEANING,

149
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,916
NOBODY'S BETTER
THAN OUR LANDLORD.

150
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,458
I BET IT TASTES A LOT BETTER
THAN THAT EXPENSIVE STUFF

151
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,708
YOU USUALLY EAT.

152
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,458
- ( gasps )

153
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,583
WHY DIDN'T I THINK
OF IT EARLIER?

154
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,375
- THERE WE GO.

155
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:07,416
I WONDER WHAT KIND OF
DISHES I SHOULD MAKE TONIGHT.

156
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,458
COME TO THINK OF IT,
KAORU-SAMA MENTIONED

157
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,916
THAT HE FELT LIKE
EATING FISH.

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,125
- ( doorbell rings )

159
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,250
- HUH?
YES, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

160
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,750
WHO IS IT?

161
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,583
( gasps )

162
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,583
- ( students chatter )

163
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,000
- ( meows )

164
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,125
- I GUESS MAYU-CHAN'S
NOT COMING AFTER ALL.

165
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,708
- AND AFTER ALL THAT
MOUTHING OFF ABOUT

166
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,250
MAKING YOU BENTO, TOO.

167
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,458
I'M SURE THINGS DIDN'T TURN
OUT AS WELL AS SHE HAD HOPED.

168
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:36,875
- COOKING REALLY ISN'T SOMETHING

169
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,333
THAT YOU CAN LEARN
HOW TO DO WELL

170
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,750
IN ONLY A DAY OR TWO.

171
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,916
IT TOOK ME 10 HARD
DAYS OF THINKING

172
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,916
TO COME UP WITH THIS
TEMPURA RECIPE.

173
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,875
- Both:
OH, IS THAT SO?

174
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,916
- ( sighs )

175
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,250
Kaoru: I WONDER IF
MAYU-CHAN'S ALL RIGHT.

176
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,541
I HOPE SHE'S NOT 
HURT OR ANYTHING.

177
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,458
- Tina: HI, WE'RE BACK,
MISS LANDLORD.

178
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,583
- WELCOME HOME.

179
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,416
- HUH?

180
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,416
TAEKO-CHAN?

181
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,791
BUT AREN'T YOU
RIGHT OVER HERE?

182
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,333
- YEAH.
- WELL, YOU SEE...

183
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,208
TO TELL THE TRUTH,
KAORU-SAMA...

184
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,250
- ALLOW ME TO
WELCOME YOU HOME,

185
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,916
HANABISHI-SAMA.

186
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,666
- ( all stammer )

187
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,291
- ( giggles )

188
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,666
- Kaoru: WHAT?!

189
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,250
MAYU-CHAN.

190
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:27,250
- I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE 
FOR TROUBLING YOU ALL SO.

191
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:31,250
- WELL, SO WHAT THE HELL'S
THAT BRAT DOING HERE ANYWAY?

192
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,250
- MAYU-SAMA INSISTED
THAT SHE WISHED TO LEARN

193
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,583
HOW TO PERFORM
EVERYDAY HOUSEHOLD CHORES.

194
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,541
AND IN ORDER
TO ACCOMPLISH THAT,

195
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,583
SHE REQUESTED THAT
MISS AOI SAKURABA,

196
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:40,875
THE LANDLORD OF
THIS ESTATE,

197
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,750
BE HER PERSONAL INSTRUCTOR.

198
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,750
- I WANTED TO LEARN
HOW TO MAKE THE BENTO LUNCH

199
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,583
THAT HANABISHI-SAMA LIKED.

200
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,458
I ALSO HEARD SHE KNEW
HOW TO DO OTHER CHORES AS WELL.

201
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,416
I LEAVE MYSELF IN YOUR
MOST CAPABLE HANDS, MISS AOI.

202
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,625
- OH, THANK YOU.

203
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,083
- AOI-CHAN.

204
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,333
- BECAUSE SHE IS
ONE OF YOUR ACQUAINTANCES,

205
00:09:58,416 --> 00:09:59,875
SIR KAORU,
WE FELT OBLIGATED

206
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,125
TO ACCEPT HER.

207
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,000
AND APPARENTLY,
YOU HAD PROMISED THIS YOUNG LADY

208
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,000
YOU WOULD EAT HER BENTO
AS WELL.

209
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,250
- UH-- WELL,

210
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,791
THAT WAS ONLY BECAUSE...

211
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,708
- THAT'S RIGHT.

212
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,125
AND WHO BETTER TO LEARN
ALL THESE DOMESTIC CHORES FROM

213
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,250
THAN HANABISHI-SAMA'S
PERSONAL SERVANT.

214
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,416
- HIS PERSONAL SERVANT?

215
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,375
- WHAT?
THAT ISN'T WHAT YOU ARE?

216
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,875
- WHAT I AM IS 
KAORU-SAMA'S...

217
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,250
- NO, LADY AOI.

218
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:29,250
PLEASE SHOW SOME RESTRAINT.

219
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,541
- I KNOW.

220
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,458
- AOI-CHAN.

221
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:34,583
I'M SORRY.

222
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:35,958
I NEVER IMAGINED
MAYU-CHAN

223
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,541
WOULD JUST BARGE IN HERE.

224
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,916
- THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT UNSAID.

225
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,750
AND OF ALL THINGS
SHE COULD HAVE CALLED HER,

226
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,083
A SERVANT?
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

227
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,083
JUST HOW HUMILIATED
LADY AOI MUST FEEL 

228
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,250
AT THIS VERY MOMENT?

229
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,750
- Aoi: PLEASE WAIT,
MISS MIYABI.

230
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,458
KAORU-SAMA DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING SO HORRIBLE.

231
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,291
- BUT LADY AOI,
EVEN SO.

232
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,166
- KAORU-SAMA, PLEASE DO NOT
BE SO SENSITIVE

233
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,500
ABOUT HURTING MY FEELINGS.

234
00:10:58,583 --> 00:10:59,916
- WHY NOT?

235
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,583
- I KNOW THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
AND I'M FINE WITH IT.

236
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,416
- ( glass shatters )

237
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,916
- Taeko:
OH, NO, THE VASE!

238
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,125
- Mayu: MAYU WAS ONLY
DOING HER DUTY AS A MAID

239
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,750
BY REDECORATING A LITTLE.

240
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,791
IT'S THE VASE'S FAULT
FOR BEING THERE.

241
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,458
- Tina: ( groans ) WHY DON'T
YOU JUST GO HOME ALREADY,

242
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,958
YOU STUPID LITTLE BRAT?!

243
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,958
- ( sighs )

244
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,250
I'M PERFECTLY FINE 
WITH THE SITUATION.

245
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,791
( chuckles nervously )

246
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:53,708
- WHY ARE THERE
SO MANY SHEETS HERE?

247
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,750
THE ONLY LAUNDRY
THAT MAYU WANTS TO WASH

248
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,625
IS HANABISHI-SAMA'S LAUNDRY.

249
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:06,916
( sighs )

250
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,916
HUH?

251
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,375
( sighs )

252
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,583
I MAY BE A LITTLE
TIRED RIGHT NOW, 

253
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,250
BUT THIS IS
SORT OF SATISFYING.

254
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,916
ALL THE LAUNDRY
SWAYING IN THE WIND.

255
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,666
- ( chuckles )

256
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,750
I KNOW THAT FEELING WELL.

257
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,083
EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE,

258
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,708
SEEING THIS MAKES ME
FEEL VERY HAPPY.

259
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,083
IT'S THINGS LIKE THIS

260
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:39,583
THAT MAKE ME FEEL LIKE I'M
REALLY LIVING WITH KAORU-SAMA.

261
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:40,708
( gasps )

262
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,333
- COME ON, AOI-CHAN.

263
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,250
IT'S TIME TO GO INSIDE
AND HAVE SOME TEA.

264
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,875
- HANABISHI-SAMA.

265
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,166
- OH?

266
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,541
- CAN YOU BELIEVE
I HELPED PUT UP

267
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,791
ALL THIS LAUNDRY?
ISN'T IT WONDERFUL?

268
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,250
MAYU WILL MAKE
A VERY GOOD WIFE.

269
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,583
- A VERY GOOD WIFE?

270
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,833
NOW JUST HOLD ON A MINUTE THERE,
MAYU-CHAN.

271
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,250
- AND WHEN MAYU FINALLY
BECOMES YOUR WIFE ONE DAY,

272
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,916
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR ME
AND ONLY FOR ME.

273
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,625
I WONDER IF I CAN IMAGINE
HOW OUR LIVES WILL BE.

274
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:08,916
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

275
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,083
I BELIEVE YOU WANTED
SOME TEA RIGHT NOW, 

276
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,583
AND AS A MAID,
MAYU SHOULD SERVE IT TO YOU.

277
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:14,916
- WELL...

278
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,375
- ( chuckles )

279
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,500
- COME ON.
HURRY UP, HANABISHI-SAMA.

280
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:24,958
- HUH?

281
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,208
WHERE'S MISS MAYU?

282
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:29,333
- OH, SHE WENT INSIDE
FOR TEA WITH KAORU-SAMA.

283
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:32,541
- EVEN NOW, MISS MAYU'S
AS AGGRESSIVE AS SHE ALWAYS IS.

284
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,500
THAT KISS THE OTHER DAY,
AND NOW THIS.

285
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,916
- ( gasps )

286
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,583
"THAT KISS"?

287
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,500
- PLEASE HAVE SOME TEA,
HANABISHI-SAMA.

288
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:01,916
- OH, THANKS A LOT,
MAYU-CHAN.

289
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,166
- I FORGOT TO MENTION TO YOU
THAT I WAS CURIOUS

290
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,958
AND TOOK A LITTLE PEEK
AT THE ROOM EARLIER.

291
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,291
YOUR ROOM, I MEAN.

292
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,333
- YOU TOOK A LOOK
AT MY ROOM, MAYU-CHAN?

293
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,208
- IT WAS SO INSPIRING,
HANABISHI-SAMA.

294
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,583
- HUH?

295
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,583
- LIVING IN A MERE
COMMONER'S ROOM

296
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,250
IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND
THE LIVES OF ORDINARY MEN.

297
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,916
HOW UTTERLY MAGNANIMOUS
AND NOBLE OF YOU.

298
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,833
MAYU WAS SO HUMBLED
BY IT ALL.

299
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,250
AND JUST FOR YOU,
HANABISHI-SAMA,

300
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,000
MAYU WILL LEARN
THE HOUSEHOLD CHORES

301
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,666
OF THE ORDINARY COMMONER.

302
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,125
- HEY!
- ( grunts )

303
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,541
- WHAT THE HECK
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING

304
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,458
WASTING YOUR TIME
JUST SITTING THERE?

305
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,750
YOU OUGHT TO BE
DOING YOUR CHORES?

306
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,250
- AND WHAT DO YOU 
THINK YOU'RE DOING

307
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:40,208
INCESSANTLY INTERRUPTING
THE TWO OF US?

308
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,208
MAYU IS ACTING 
AS A MAID HERE.

309
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:45,333
IT'S ONLY NATURAL FOR ME TO BE
SERVING THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE.

310
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,625
- ( gasps )
- HMM.

311
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,833
- ( murmurs )

312
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,916
( crying )
MISS MANAGER,

313
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,916
THAT BRAT'S
BEING MEAN TO ME.

314
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,916
- NOW THAT WAS
A PERFECT VICTORY.

315
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,583
- ( sighs )

316
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:07,916
- Taeko: EVEN NOW, MISS MAYU'S
AS AGGRESSIVE AS SHE ALWAYS IS.

317
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,583
THAT KISS THE OTHER DAY.

318
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,250
- ( sighs )

319
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,250
- Mayu: AND WHEN MAYU FINALLY
BECOMES YOUR WIFE ONE DAY,

320
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,583
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR ME
AND ONLY FOR ME.

321
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,875
- HIS WIFE.
( sighs )

322
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,541
- ( door opens )
- Miyabi: LADY AOI.

323
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,250
- OH?  YES?

324
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,625
- IT IS NEARLY DINNER TIME.

325
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,291
WE SHOULD BEGIN
PREPARING IT.

326
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,416
MISS TAEKO AND MISS MAYU
ARE WAITING FOR YOU.

327
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,333
- OH, I DIDN'T REALIZE.

328
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,625
I WILL BE RIGHT THERE
ONCE I TAKE CARE OF THIS.

329
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:42,208
- Mayu: FINALLY,
I WAS GETTING IMPATIENT.

330
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,666
SO WHAT KIND OF FOOD DOES
EVERYONE NORMALLY EAT

331
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,583
AROUND HERE?

332
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,250
- WELL, FOR TODAY,

333
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,541
WE WERE PLANNING
TO HAVE MEAT WITH POTATOES

334
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:50,625
AND SOME GRILLED FISH.

335
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,000
- HUH?!

336
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,791
WHY DO YOU FEED
HANABISHI-SAMA 

337
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,750
THE FOOD OF COMMONERS?
- HUH?

338
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,583
- FOR A MAN OF HIS
UPBRINGING AND PEDIGREE,

339
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,416
A MORE PALATABLE AND
ELEGANT MENU IS REQUIRED.

340
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,125
FOR INSTANCE,
AS AN EXAMPLE--

341
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,541
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

342
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,041
SENPAI ACTUALLY LIKES JAPANESE
FOOD LIKE THAT.

343
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,833
- HMM.
- COMMONER FOOD.

344
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,916
- OH, LADY AOI,

345
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,041
MAINTAIN YOUR COMPOSURE.

346
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,583
- Aoi: IT'S IMPORTANT
TO MONITOR THE TEMPERATURE

347
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,416
AS YOU LET THE FLAVORS
MELT TOGETHER.

348
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,958
IT DOESN'T APPEAR
TO BE SALTY ENOUGH.

349
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,458
- WOW, YOU CERTAINLY
ARE WELL VERSED IN

350
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,125
YOUR WORK AS A SERVANT,
MISS AOI.

351
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,916
- ( stammers )

352
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,875
( chuckles ) I GUESS MY
HAND SLIPPED A LITTLE.

353
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,916
- BUT YOU KNOW, WHEN I
FINALLY MARRY HANABISHI-SAMA,

354
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,250
MAYU WILL BE MAKING
JAPANESE DISHES FOR HIM

355
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,750
LIKE THIS EVERY SINGLE DAY.

356
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,250
- ( gasps )
- OH, MISS AOI.

357
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,250
- I WONDER HOW I SHOULD
ADDRESS HIM WHEN WE'RE MARRIED.

358
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,583
- IN ANY CASE,
WHEN A DISH IS TOO SALTY,

359
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,583
IF I REMEMBER,
THE REMEDY IS TO...

360
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,958
BALANCE THE FLAVOR
WITH SUGAR.

361
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,458
- BUT THAT'S CHILI SAUCE

362
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,250
THAT YOU'RE PUTTING IN THERE,
MISS AOI.

363
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,666
- ( gasps )

364
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,875
I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.

365
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,208
- Mayu: OHH!
DECISIONS, DECISIONS.

366
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,916
I WONDER WHAT WE SHOULD
NAME OUR CHILDREN.

367
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,583
- Taeko:
OH MY GOSH, IT'S ON FIRE!

368
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,791
- Miyabi: LADY AOI,
THE RICE IS BURNING.

369
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,500
- Aoi: I APOLOGIZE.

370
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,916
- WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?

371
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,583
DID TAE MAKE DINNER TONIGHT
BY HERSELF OR SOMETHING?

372
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,916
- NO, ACTUALLY IT WAS
MOSTLY MISS AOI

373
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
WHO DID THE COOKING TODAY.
- HUH?

374
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,291
- I APOLOGIZE.

375
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,916
- AOI-CHAN?

376
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,125
- LADY AOI.

377
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,250
- MAYU DIDN'T
COME TO THIS PLACE

378
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,583
TO LEARN HOW TO COOK FOOD
IN THE WORST POSSIBLE MANNER.

379
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,625
- ( sighs )

380
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,291
- JUST A MOMENT,
MISS MAYU.

381
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,625
- MAYU-CHAN.

382
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,958
TRY NOT TO BE SO HARD
ON AOI-CHAN, OKAY?

383
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,916
SHE MAY NOT HAVE DONE
ALL THAT WELL TODAY, 

384
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,541
BUT THIS ISN'T WHAT
IT'S NORMALLY LIKE.

385
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,375
HER COOKING IS USUALLY
TOTALLY DELICIOUS.

386
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,625
- OH?

387
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,458
- BUT NOW THAT I'VE 
HAD A TASTE OF THIS,

388
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,583
IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD
IN ITS OWN WAY.

389
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,000
- HANABISHI-SAMA.

390
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,791
- YEAH, IT REALLY
ISN'T ALL THAT BAD.

391
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,666
AT LEAST, IT'S A LOT BETTER 
THAN WHAT TAE USUALLY COOKS.

392
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,458
- OH, IS THAT REALLY SO?

393
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:59,083
WELL, MY NEXT RECIPE IS
CHOCOLATE COVERED POTATOES.

394
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,208
AND I'LL MAKE SURE TO
ADJUST IT TO YOUR LIKING.

395
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,750
I HOPE YOU BEAR WITH ME
WHILE I EXPERIMENT.

396
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,250
- ( groans )
ANYTHING BUT THAT.

397
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,583
HEY, KAORU, YOU WANT TO
GET IN ON THE ACTION?

398
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,291
- WHAT?  WHY DO I
HAVE TO SUFFER?

399
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:13,625
- Taeko: HEY, HOW CAN BOTH OF
YOU BE SO CRUEL TO A FRIEND?

400
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,958
- ( all chuckle )
- KAORU-SAMA.

401
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,208
EVERYONE.

402
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:20,250
- UM, MISS AOI,

403
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,583
I KNOW THAT I WENT
A LITTLE TOO FAR EARLIER.

404
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,375
I APOLOGIZE.

405
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,541
- MISS MAYU,
AND I APOLOGIZE

406
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,500
FOR NOT TEACHING YOU BETTER.
- ( chuckles )

407
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,791
- WELL THEN, WE'D BETTER BE
TAKING OUR LEAVE NOW.

408
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,083
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR EVERYTHING TODAY.

409
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:42,250
- I HOPE YOU'RE WILLING TO TEACH
TO COOK ANOTHER TIME, MISS AOI. 

410
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,416
- I AM.

411
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,416
PLEASE COME WHENEVER
YOU WOULD LIKE.

412
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,916
- ( giggles )

413
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,083
 ( laughs )

414
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,000
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT,
HANABISHI-SAMA.

415
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,166
( yelps )
- HOW LONG DO YOU PLAN

416
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,833
TO KEEP ON HANGING
ON HIM LIKE THAT? 

417
00:18:56,916 --> 00:19:00,916
- Mayu: I'LL BE SO LONELY
WITHOUT YOU, HANABISHI-SAMA.

418
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,250
- ( car door closes )

419
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,583
- Mayu: I'LL COME BACK
AGAIN SOME OTHER TIME!

420
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,625
- Tina:
NEVER COME BACK HERE!

421
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,291
- KAORU-SAMA.

422
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,416
- ( knocks on door )
- ( gasps )

423
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,083
OH, COME IN.

424
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,583
OH.

425
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,250
WHAT IN THE WORLD
ARE YOU DOING HERE,

426
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,958
AND AT THIS HOUR?

427
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,791
IF MISS MIYABI FINDS YOU...

428
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,833
- WHAT'S THAT?
WAIT A SEC.

429
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:44,958
MISS MIYABI JUST TOLD ME 
YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME.

430
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:48,583
- Both: HUH?

431
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:49,791
( chuckling )

432
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,708
- Kaoru: I REALLY AM
SORRY ABOUT TODAY.

433
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,583
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
HARD ON YOU.

434
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:03,916
- NO.

435
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,791
IT WAS BECAUSE
I COULDN'T DEAL WITH THINGS

436
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,125
THAT I TROUBLED YOU
AND EVERYONE ELSE. 

437
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,958
I WAS NOT EVEN ABLE
TO TEACH MISS MAYU PROPERLY.

438
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,250
BUT I WILL DO MY VERY BEST
THE NEXT TIME.

439
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,958
AND I WILL TRY HARDER TO PUT
FEELINGS LIKE THAT ASIDE.

440
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,750
IF I DO NOT...

441
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,500
IF I DO NOT,

442
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,583
THEN I CANNOT BE YOUR...

443
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,208
- AOI-CHAN,

444
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,583
IT SURE WOULD BE NICE
IF WE COULD SAY IT SOON, HUH?

445
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,083
THAT YOU'RE MY FIANCEE 
AND EVERYTHING, I MEAN?

446
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,750
- ( gasps )

447
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,250
( sighs )

448
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,916
KA--

449
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,083
KAORU-SAMA.

450
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,041
KAORU-SAMA!
- ( Kaoru grunts )

451
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,416
- I'M SORRY.

452
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,250
I JUST COULDN'T
HELP MYSELF.

453
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,708
- IT'S ALL RIGHT,
I'M FINE.

454
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,125
- ( sighs )

455
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,625
I'LL TRY HARDER TO BECOME A
FIANCEE YOU WON'T BE ASHAMED OF.

456
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,708
I'LL DO EVERYTHING
I POSSIBLY CAN.

457
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,500
- YOU'RE A PERSON THAT
I CAN BE PROUD TO CALL

458
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,916
MY FIANCEE EVEN NOW,
AOI-CHAN.

459
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,250
- KAORU-SAMA.

460
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:12,916
BEING HERE AT THIS MOMENT
AND HEARING YOU SAY THOSE WORDS

461
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,541
BRINGS MORE JOY TO MY HEART

462
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,166
THAN I COULD HAVE
EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE.

463
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,416
- I CAN'T HELP BUT
WONDER RIGHT NOW

464
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,333
WHAT KIND OF A WIFE
YOU'LL BE IN THE FUTURE.

465
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,583
HAVE YOU EVER
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT?

466
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,208
- I HAVE.
QUITE OFTEN, IN FACT.

467
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:31,666
WE WOULDN'T LIVE IN
A LARGE HOUSE LIKE THIS ONE.

468
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,083
AND WE WOULD HAVE
THREE CHILDREN,

469
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,083
