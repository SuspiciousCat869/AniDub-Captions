1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,541
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:40,958
( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:10,666
- Kaoru: THE ECONOMIC EFFECT
IS A DEFLATION SPIRAL...

4
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,791
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

5
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:15,333
HUH?

6
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,583
I GUESS I FELL ASLEEP.

7
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,000
THAT'S NO GOOD.

8
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:25,916
THE DUE DATE FOR THIS ECONOMICS
REPORT IS COMING UP PRETTY SOON.

9
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,750
( grunts )

10
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,250
- ( clock ticking )

11
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,750
I'M LA-AAAATE!

12
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:41,833
UH--

13
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,875
HUH?

14
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,916
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT! WHY DIDN'T
ANYBODY WAKE ME UP TODAY?

15
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,208
WHAT THE--?

16
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,916
- OH, TINA-SEMPAI,

17
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,125
GOOD MORNING.

18
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,625
- MORNING, TAE.

19
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,875
DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S UP
WITH MISS LANDLORD?

20
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,250
- NO, I DON'T.

21
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,708
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER ALL MORNING,
COME TO THINK OF IT.

22
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,458
- ( door opens )
- All: HUH?

23
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:09,000
- GOOD MORNING.
I'M SORRY, EVERYONE.

24
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:12,000
I WAS ACTUALLY ON MY WAY...

25
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,333
TO WAKE YOU ALL...

26
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,166
- AOI-CHAN!
- MISS AOI!

27
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,583
- WAKE UP, AOI-CHAN.

28
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,583
AOI-CHAN.

29
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,500
AOI-CHAN!

30
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,916
- WHAT A FEVER.
YOU MUSTN'T PUSH YOURSELF,

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
SO PLEASE,
GO AND GET SOME BED REST.

32
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,250
- I'M ALL RIGHT.

33
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,500
THIS IS REALLY NOTHING
TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT.

34
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,916
- DON'T BE SO UNREASONABLE.
A HIGH FEVER IS VERY SERIOUS.

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,958
- Aoi: I TRULY AM ALL RIGHT.

36
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,625
I THINK IT'S JUST A COLD.

37
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,541
KAORU-SAMA?

38
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,958
THERE'S NO NEED TO BE
WORRIED ABOUT ME.

39
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,916
PLEASE, GO ON AHEAD
TO YOUR CLASSES.

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,125
- BUT, AOI-CHAN, I--

41
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,958
- I'M ALL RIGHT, HONESTLY.

42
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,541
MISS TINA, MISS TAEKO,

43
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,750
YOU'LL ALSO BE LATE IF YOU
DON'T LEAVE SOON.

44
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:07,583
- SIR KAORU, I AGREE WITH LADY
AOI'S SENTIMENTS AS WELL.

45
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,083
I WILL TAKE CARE OF HER
WHILE YOU ALL GO TO SCHOOL.

46
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,125
- ARE YOU SURE?

47
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,958
- AS I SAID, PLEASE DON'T WORRY.

48
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,083
- ( panting )

49
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,791
- Tina: KAORU!

50
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,875
COME ON,
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE!

51
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,208
- OKAY.
I'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

52
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,708
- HURRY UP, KAORU.
- SORRY, GUYS.

53
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,583
- I APOLOGIZE.

54
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:43,958
- PLEASE DON'T.

55
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,791
I SHOULD BE THE ONE
APOLOGIZING TO YOU.

56
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,250
AFTER ALL, LADY AOI,

57
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,583
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE
ATTENTIVE IN MY DUTIES

58
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,041
AND NOTICED THE CHANGE
IN YOUR CONDITION EARLIER.

59
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,875
- KAORU-SAMA...
- OH.

60
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,291
- PLEASE DON'T BE
WORRIED ABOUT ME.

61
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:02,375
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT
HONESTLY, KAORU-SAMA.

62
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,500
- OH.

63
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,791
- ( Mayu chanting )
HA-NA-BI-SHI-SA-MA!

64
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,625
WHY DON'T WE HAVE A NICE QUIET
DINNER, JUST THE TWO OF US?

65
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:15,791
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

66
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,666
- WELL, MAYU-CHAN, TO
TELL THE TRUTH--

67
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,875
- IT LOOKS LIKE TONIGHT
WILL BE A GORGEOUS NIGHT

68
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,458
SO YOU SHOULD
SPEND IT WITH MAYU.

69
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,750
DOESN'T THAT SOUND WONDERFUL,
HANABISHI-SAMA?

70
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,208
- ( growls )
YOU REALLY IRRITATE ME!

71
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:30,041
KAORU DOESN'T HAVE TIME
TO PLAY WITH YOU, OKAY?

72
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,791
- WHAT IS IT WITH YOU?

73
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,333
YOU'RE BEHAVING MUCH MORE RUDELY
THAN USUAL TODAY.

74
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:37,500
YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO RIGHT
TO TELL HANABISHI-SAMA

75
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,666
AND I WHAT TO DO
IN OUR PRIVATE TIME.

76
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,541
RIGHT, HANABISHI-SAMA?

77
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,458
- SORRY, MAYU-CHAN.

78
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,916
- OH?

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,375
- AOI-CHAN JUST CAUGHT
A COLD RECENTLY.

80
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,291
- WHAT?
MISS AOI IS ILL?

81
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,375
- YOU UNDERSTAND, RIGHT?

82
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,750
- I SUPPOSE.
BUT STILL...

83
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:58,000
( sighs )
PERHAPS ANOTHER TIME.

84
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,291
- THANKS.
- OH, I SEE NOW!

85
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,791
- HUH?

86
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:05,250
- THE KEY IS PROPER MIXING
SO THAT'S HOW YOU COOK IT RIGHT.

87
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,791
SAKI EGGNOG IS HARD TO MAKE.

88
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,375
- MAN, I SURE WISH THESE CLASSES
WOULD END ALREADY.

89
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,958
- IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE ALL
WORRIED ABOUT AOI-CHAN TOO.

90
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,500
- I'M PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT,
HONESTLY.

91
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,875
- AOI-CHAN.

92
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,375
- ( door opens )
- All: WE'RE BACK!

93
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:31,000
- WELCOME HOME. I DIDN'T
EXPECT YOU BACK SO SOON.

94
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,458
- Tina: HOW'S MISS LANDLORD
HOLDING UP, MISS MANAGER?

95
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,916
- SHH, LOWER YOUR VOICE,
MISS TINA.

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,291
LADY AOI IS CURRENTLY
ASLEEP IN HER ROOM.

97
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,500
- Tae: I GUESS HER FEVER
HASN'T GONE DOWN YET, HUH?

98
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,333
- Tina: THAT'S GOTTA BE HARD
ON MISS LANDLORD.

99
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,958
- ( sighs )

100
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,458
- Kaoru: MISS MIYABI?
- HUH?

101
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,458
UH?

102
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,458
- I UNDERSTAND.
I WILL CONTINUE

103
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,916
LOOKING AFTER LADY AOI
THESE NEXT FEW DAYS

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,958
SO I LEAVE THE HOUSEHOLD CHORES
TO YOU THREE.

105
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,166
SIR KAORU,
PLEASE CLEAN THE MANSION.

106
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,250
- SURE THING.
- MISS TINA, THE LAUNDRY.

107
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,041
- I GOT IT COVERED!

108
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,916
- MISS TAEKO,
DINNER PREPARATIONS ARE YOURS.

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
- YES, MA'AM.

110
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,125
- WELL THEN,
DO YOUR BEST, EVERYONE.

111
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,750
- EASILY SAID.

112
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,500
BUT I STILL HAVE
THIS MUCH LEFT TO DO.

113
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:39,791
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW HARD
AOI-CHAN HAS TO WORK EVERY DAY.

114
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:43,541
THERE'S LOTS TO DO.
- Tina: HELP ME, KAORU!

115
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,333
- TINA, WHAT'S WRONG?

116
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:48,250
- ( yelps ) THE WASHING
MACHINE'S OUT OF CONTROL!

117
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,041
IT'S GOT A LIFE OF ITS OWN!

118
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,000
- Kaoru: JEEZ, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

119
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,166
- THE ONLY THING I WAS
TRYING TO DO WAS GET

120
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,791
ALL THE LAUNDRY DONE
LIKE MISS MANAGER ASKED.

121
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,500
AND THAT'S WHEN--
- THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

122
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:03,583
( yelps )

123
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,083
( sighs )

124
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:11,083
- Tae: DINNER'S READY,
EVERYONE!

125
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,625
- HURRY IT UP ALREADY, TAE.

126
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,000
I'M STARVING OVER HERE.

127
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,041
- OH, SORRY TO KEEP
YOU ALL WAITING.

128
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,916
I FOLLOWED MISS AOI'S LEAD TODAY

129
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,416
AND TRIED MY HAND AT COOKING
JAPANESE FOOD.

130
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,000
THE MAIN COURSE IS
YOUR FAVORITE, SEMPAI--

131
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,416
FISH!
- YEAH.

132
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
- HERE YOU GO.

133
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,041
- ( moaning )

134
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,875
- Kaoru: THIS CAN'T BE--

135
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,416
- IT IS!
MACKEREL STEWED IN CHOCOLATE.

136
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,750
( giggles )
- All: CHOCOLATE?

137
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,083
- I FIGURED THAT
SINCE EVERYONE HERE

138
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,083
SEEMED TO LIKE
MISS AOI'S MISO STEW,

139
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,333
I'D TRY TO MAKE MY OWN
VARIATION OF HER RECIPE.

140
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,166
- ( squeaks, sneezes )

141
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,875
- HUH.

142
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,625
- Tina: THIS SURE WAS
A LONG DAY.

143
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,500
WITH THE WAY THIS HOUSE LOOKS,

144
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,250
YOU WOULD THINK WE WERE ALL OUT
SICK OR SOMETHING.

145
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,208
- Tae: IT DOES LOOK THAT WAY.

146
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:06,500
BUT THIS SHOULD BE NOTHING
IF MISS AOI DID IT ALL HERSELF.

147
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,458
- Kaoru: IT SHOULD
BE NOTHING, HUH?

148
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,541
- ( clock chiming )

149
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,375
- WE'D BETTER JUST
CALL IT A DAY, GUYS.

150
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,666
- I SUPPOSED WE SHOULD.

151
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,625
- Tina: LET'S DO
OUR BEST TOMORROW.

152
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,000
- GOOD NIGHT, SEMPAI.
- ( footsteps )

153
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,708
( door closes )

154
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,708
- Miyabi: THE SAKI EGGNOG
IS FROM MISS TAEKO

155
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,250
AND THE ENERGY DRINKS
ARE FROM MISS TINA.

156
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,291
- PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

157
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,583
I DID NOT MEAN TO MAKE
YOU ALL WORRY.

158
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,375
- DON'T CONCERN YOURSELF
WITH US.

159
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:54,000
RIGHT NOW YOUR TOP PRIORITY
IS ONLY TO GET BETTER.

160
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,791
- I KNOW.

161
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:59,041
BUT STILL I FEEL
RATHER ASHAMED OF MYSELF.

162
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:03,916
IT'S JUST THE THOUGHT

163
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,333
THAT I AM INTERFERING
WITH KAORU-SAMA'S STUDIES.

164
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:11,083
I'M USUALLY ALWAYS THINKING
ABOUT WHAT DIFFERENT WAYS

165
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,958
I CAN BE OF HELP TO HIM
IN OUR DAILY LIVES.

166
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,250
BUT AS IT STANDS NOW

167
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,583
I'M JUST A BURDEN.

168
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,041
- LADY AOI.

169
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,333
- ( yawns )

170
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,833
UH?

171
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,916
- Kaoru: GOOD MORNING, MISS
MIYABI. 

172
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,416
OH, SIR KAORU, WHAT PROMPTED YOU
TO WAKE UP SO EARLY TODAY?

173
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,916
- ACTUALLY I HAVE THE DAY OFF

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
SO I WAS THINKING ABOUT DOING
SOME CLEANING.

175
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,125
- THEN YOU MUST
HAVE BEEN THE ONE

176
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,916
WHO PUT NEW FLOWERS IN THE VASE?

177
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,583
- OH THAT?
SURE WAS.

178
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:58,500
I THOUGHT SEEING SOME PRETTY
FLOWERS IN THE MORNING

179
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,541
WOULD BE A NICE WAY
TO START THE DAY.

180
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,750
EVEN IF I COULDN'T ARRANGE THEM
AS WELL AS AOI-CHAN DOES.

181
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,458
- Tina: KAORU, COME HERE A SEC!
- HUH?

182
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,416
- HURRY UP!

183
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,208
- WELL, I'D BETTER SEE
WHAT TINA WANTS.

184
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,041
SO WE'LL TALK LATER.

185
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:18,541
- SO SIR KAORU WAS
THE ONE WHO DID THIS.

186
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,583
- IS THIS OKAY?

187
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,916
- Kaoru: YEAH,
THAT WHITE ONE IS FINE.

188
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,791
- ALL RIGHT.
HOW'S THIS ONE?

189
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,916
- THAT'S OUT.
WE'LL WASH THE PRINTS LATER.

190
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,833
- OKAY.
HOW ABOUT THIS?

191
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:32,875
- OUT TOO.

192
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,041
- I THINK THIS NEEDS
A GOOD CLEANING.

193
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,000
- THAT'S OUT TOO.

194
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,500
- THEN WHAT ABOUT THIS?
- HUH?

195
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,750
- ( screeching )

196
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,708
- HEY, IT'S JUST A JOKE!
COME ON, I'M SORRY, OKAY?

197
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,041
OW!
- ( sighs )

198
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:55,250
- ( sighs ) I CAN'T BELIEVE
THERE'S STILL THIS MUCH LEFT.

199
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,666
- IF YOU'RE GETTING TIRED,

200
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,250
WHY DON'T YOU GO TAKE A BREAK
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

201
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,791
- I'M FINE.
LET'S TRY TO FINISH THIS UP.

202
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,125
BUT YOU KNOW,

203
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,458
IT'S AMAZING HOW MISS AOI
CLEANED PLACES LIKE THIS

204
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,250
ALL THE TIME BY HERSELF.

205
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,583
- YEAH, IT IS.

206
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,291
I NEVER REALIZED JUST
HOW MUCH WORK IT TOOK.

207
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,833
IT'S ALWAYS SO CLEAN HERE.
- Tina: KAORU!

208
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,250
- ( pants )
I'M DONE WITH ALL THE LAUNDRY.

209
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,875
AND THE WASHING MACHINE
DIDN'T GO CRAZY THIS TIME!

210
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,750
I'M SO PROUD!
- IT'S LIKE I TOLD YOU.

211
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,916
TAKE CARE OF IT
AND IT'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

212
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,041
- YEAH, I SORTED THE LAUNDRY
LIKE YOU SAID

213
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,333
AND EVERYTHING WENT

214
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,250
AS SMOOTH AS A PENGUIN GOING
DOWN AN ICE FLOE.

215
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,791
- ALL I HAD TO DO WAS IMAGINE

216
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,375
WHAT AOI-CHAN WOULD
HAVE DONE THERE.

217
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:34,125
- ALL RIGHT THEN, KAORU, WHAT
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD DO NEXT?

218
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,833
- LET ME THINK NOW...

219
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:39,083
IF I WAS AOI-CHAN,
I'D GO SHOPPING.

220
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,333
SO I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE REST HERE,

221
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,291
AND YOU GUYS HANDLE
THE SHOPPING, OKAY?

222
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:46,750
- Tina: OKAY THEN, I'M GONNA
GRAB EVERY DISCOUNT I SEE

223
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,125
AND GET THINGS WAY CHEAPER
THAN THE LANDLORD.

224
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:52,458
COME ON, TAE.
- HEY, WAIT FOR ME, TINA-SEMPAI.

225
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:02,250
- THAT'S MUCH BETTER.
HER FEVER HAS STARTED TO BREAK.

226
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,458
- I THINK THAT'S
ABOUT IT FOR NOW.

227
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,583
- ( knocks )
- COME IN.

228
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,333
- I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU
WHILE YOU'RE WORKING.

229
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:20,208
- I DON'T MIND.
CAN I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING?

230
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,208
- I'M SORRY IF THIS SOUNDS
LIKE A SELFISH REQUEST.

231
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,708
THE ECONOMICS REPORT I'VE BEEN
WORKING ON IS DUE SOON

232
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,708
AND I CAN'T FIND ANY GOOD
SOURCE MATERIALS.

233
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:40,416
- SIR KAORU, ARE YOU CERTAIN
THAT YOU ARE ALL RIGHT?

234
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,208
- UH?
- IT MUST BE DIFFICULT

235
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:45,208
TO DO BOTH YOUR SCHOOLWORK AND
THE HOUSEHOLD CHORES, IS IT NOT?

236
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,916
- I CAN HANDLE THIS MUCH.
I'LL BE OKAY.

237
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,541
- OH.

238
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,916
- LET'S SEE, GLOBALIZATION...

239
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,291
THE EFFECT WHEN LOCAL ECONOMIES

240
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,000
EXPAND TO INCLUDE A CON...

241
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,041
- ( squeaks )

242
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,958
- THANKS FOR WAKING
ME UP, UZUME.

243
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,583
I'M LUCKY YOU'RE HERE
TO HELP OUT.

244
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,375
- ( squeaks )

245
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,625
- OKAY.

246
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,208
- Tae: WE'RE BACK FROM SHOPPING.
- Tina: WE BOUGHT A TON.

247
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,791
- UH. WHAT'S ALL THIS?

248
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,833
DID YOU THREE MAKE THIS?

249
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,666
- YEAH, WE FIGURED
WE COULDN'T GO WRONG

250
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,500
IF WE EACH MADE THE DISHES
WE WERE GOOD AT.

251
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,083
SO WE SPLIT UP
THE COOKING DUTIES.

252
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,958
- Tina: THIS OVER HERE IS
MY OWN SPECIAL STAMINA SOUP!

253
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,125
PERFECT FOR JUMP-STARTING
A TIRED BODY.

254
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,416
- Tae: THE MIXED TEMPURA
IS MINE.

255
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,291
DOESN'T IT LOOK GREAT?

256
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,458
I THINK I DID
A PRETTY GOOD JOB ON IT.

257
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,833
- MINE'S THE STAPLE OF POOR
COLLEGE STUDENTS EVERYWHERE:

258
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,541
A VEGETABLE STIR-FRY
WITH ALL THE ODDS AND ENDS.

259
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,375
- LOOKS LIKE WE DID A GREAT JOB.

260
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,083
LET'S DIG IN BEFORE
IT GETS COLD!

261
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,916
- BY THE WAY...
- All: HUH?

262
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,208
- DID YOU REMEMBER
TO COOK RICE?

263
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,791
- All: UH...

264
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,041
- "FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS
HAVE BENEFITTED

265
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,083
FROM THE IMPROVEMENTS
IN INFORMATION..."

266
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,666
- Miyabi: REDUCE THE HEAT!
- HUH?

267
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,458
- MISS MIYABI.
- THE HEAT IS MUCH TOO HIGH.

268
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,416
LOWER IT THIS INSTANT!
- OKAY.

269
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,916
- INCREASE IT TO MEDIUM HEAT

270
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,583
WHEN IT BOILS AND
COOK IT THOROUGHLY.

271
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,666
- I WILL.
- BUT IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,

272
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,791
PREPARING LADY AOI'S PORRIDGE
IS MY RESPONSIBILITY.

273
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,166
- I KNOW. SORRY.

274
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,083
- SIR KAORU?
- HUH?

275
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,958
- DON'T OVEREXERT YOURSELF.

276
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,833
- I APPRECIATE THE CONCERN.

277
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,666
BUT COMPARED TO THE WORK
THAT AOI-CHAN DOES,

278
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,625
THIS IS PRACTICALLY A VACATION.

279
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,416
- WHAT?
- YOU KNOW,

280
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,583
I NEVER REALIZED IT BEFORE,

281
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,916
BUT AOI-CHAN IS ALWAYS
THINKING ABOUT EVERYONE.

282
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
ALWAYS SMILING. SHE NEVER EVEN
MAKES A SINGLE SOUR FACE

283
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,416
AS SHE DOES ALL THIS
HARD WORK.

284
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,750
THAT'S OUR AOI-CHAN.
SHE REALLY IS AMAZING.

285
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,625
- SIR KAORU.
- UH?

286
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,916
- WITHOUT GREEN ONION,
JAPANESE PARSLEY AND EGGS,

287
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,541
A DELICIOUS BOWL OF RICE
PORRIDGE IS NOT COMPLETE.

288
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,541
- OH RIGHT!
LET'S SEE.

289
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,833
THAT'S STRANGE.
WHAT THE HECK?

290
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:20,291
WHERE DID THE EGGS GO?

291
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:33,083
- THIS IS ALL RIGHT.
- THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.

292
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,041
I GUESS I'D BETTER
LET YOU TAKE OVER NOW.

293
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,500
- SIR KAORU?
- YEAH?

294
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,708
- TAKE THIS TO LADY AOI'S ROOM.

295
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,000
- WHAT?
BUT I'M NOT--

296
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,875
- IT'S JUST FOR TODAY.

297
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,541
I ASK THAT YOU STAY BY
LADY AOI'S SIDE.

298
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,166
- MISS MIYABI.

299
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,833
- NOW RUN ALONG.
- O-OKAY.

300
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,750
- PLEASE, TAKE THIS AS WELL.

301
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,916
- WHAT'S THAT FOR?
- YOUR REPORT'S TOPIC

302
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,041
IS MACROECONOMICS,
IS THAT NOT CORRECT?

303
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,416
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- THEN YOU WILL FIND THIS BOOK

304
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,666
TO BE A MORE VALUABLE
SOURCE OF INFORMATION.

305
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,625
- YEAH?

306
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,375
THANKS! MISS MIYABI,
YOU'RE A LIFE-SAVER.

307
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
- A LIFE-SAVER.
UH.

308
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,458
- ( footsteps )

309
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,500
( thinking )
IT'S SO SMALL.

310
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:48,750
HER WHOLE BODY IS SO SMALL
AND FRAGILE LOOKING.

311
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,791
YET SHE'S DONE SUCH DEMANDING
CHORES ALL THIS TIME.

312
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,041
AOI-CHAN.

313
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:58,125
( gasps )
- HMMM.

314
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,291
- THAT'S RIGHT.
AOI-CHAN HAS A HABIT

315
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,208
OF CLINGING TO THINGS
IN HER SLEEP.

316
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,958
DON'T YOU, AOI-CHAN?
- HMM.

317
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,416
- OH.

318
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,291
I'M SORRY.

319
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,333
- HUH? KAORU-SAMA!

320
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:21,125
- I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
BE SITTING UP YET, AOI-CHAN.

321
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:25,916
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

322
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,333
WHAT'S THE MATTER, AOI-CHAN?

323
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,875
- I APOLOGIZE.

324
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:38,875
I'VE ONLY BEEN A BURDEN
TO YOU LATELY.

325
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,416
BUT BECAUSE I AM YOUR FIANCEE

326
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,916
I SHOULD BE DOING ALL
THAT I CAN DO TO HELP YOU,

327
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,375
SO I PROMISE TO REDOUBLE
MY EFFORTS.

328
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,958
I PROMISE!

329
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,833
- TODAY...
- HUH?

330
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,375
- ...WE TRIED TO DO
WHAT YOU NORMALLY DO

331
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,250
AND IT TOOK
ALL OF US TO DO IT.

332
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,083
NOTHING WENT THE WAY
WE WANTED IT TO.

333
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,333
AND I REALIZED AGAIN
JUST HOW AMAZING YOU ARE.

334
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:07,416
JUST THINKING THAT SUCH
AN AMAZING WOMAN WAS MY FIANCEE

335
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,166
HONESTLY MADE ME VERY HAPPY.

336
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,333
- KAORU-SAMA.

337
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:15,250
- I'LL STAY BY YOUR SIDE
FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT.

338
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,083
SO DON'T YOU WORRY.
- UH?

339
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,958
IS THAT REALLY TRUE?

340
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,958
- IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU'D LIKE ME TO DO?

341
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,916
- UH...

342
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,791
ACTUALLY...

343
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,125
WELL...

344
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,416
WELL, THERE IS ONE THING

345
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,625
THAT YOU COULD DO RIGHT NOW.

346
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:41,166
PLEASE, I'D LIKE YOU TO HOLD ME.

347
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,291
- I'D BE GLAD TO.

348
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,958
- THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY,
KAORU-SAMA.

349
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,250
KAORU-SAMA, FOR NOW,

350
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:10,250
JUST FOR NOW
PLEASE BE MINE AND ONLY MINE.

351
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,708
- WHAT?
COME ON, AOI-CHAN.

352
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,916
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN YOURS
AND ONLY YOURS.

353
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,875
- I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN,

354
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,791
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.
WHAT I REALLY MEAN IS

355
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,875
I WANT YOU TO BE
THE ONLY ONE FOR ME.

356
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,208
- ( thinking )
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

357
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,375
THAT I'VE SEEN HER WANT
SOMETHING SO MUCH.

358
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,333
NO, THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME.

359
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:33,875
BACK THEN TOO.

360
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,708
- OKAY, THAT'S THE END.
- WHAT?

361
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,333
I WANT TO BE PIGGY-BACKED
SOME MORE.

362
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:43,125
- THAT'S TOO BAD.
- KAORU-SAMA.

363
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,500
- NO MORE, THAT'S THE END.

364
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:48,416
- COME ON,
PLEASE, KAORU-SAMA.

365
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,250
- AOI-CHAN HASN'T
CHANGED ONE BIT.

366
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,416
SHE'S STILL THE SAME
AS WHEN WE FIRST MET.

367
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,458
SO DEMANDING,
SUCH A CRYBABY,

368
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:00,250
BUT SHE ONLY SHOWS
THAT SIDE TO ME.

369
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:03,541
THAT'S THE REAL AOI-CHAN.

370
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,000
AOI-CHAN?
- YES?

371
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,583
- WHEN YOU GET BETTER,

372
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,083
THERE'S SOMEPLACE I'D LIKE
TO TAKE YOU TO.

373
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,416
- HUH? KAORU-SAMA.

374
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,250
- THAT CAN'T BE!

375
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,916
UH, HOWEVER...

376
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,958
SO THAT'S THE CASE.

377
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,291
YES, I UNDERSTAND.

378
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,875
( sighs )

379
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,125
LADY AOI...

380
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,166
- ( wind gusting )

381
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,041
- ( theme music playing )

382
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,791
( singing in Japanese )

383
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:25,041
- Aoi: GOING OUT
MAKES ME SO HAPPY!

384
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:26,250
- Miyabi: COME, LADY AOI.

385
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,833
LET US GO. GET IN THE CAR.
- HUH?

386
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:31,250
BUT KAORU-SAMA AND I
ARE GOING OUT.

387
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:32,875
- I WILL BUY YOU
SOMETHING TO DRINK.

388
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:33,541
- SARSAPARILLA!

389
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,750
- HUH? WHAT IS THAT?
