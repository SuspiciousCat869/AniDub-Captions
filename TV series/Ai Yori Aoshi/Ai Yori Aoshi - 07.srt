1
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,250
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:40,833
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,750
- I HAVE ALL THE INGREDIENTS
I NEED FOR DINNER.

4
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,333
AND NOW--

5
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,416
( slightly gasps )

6
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,750
- ( birds chirping )

7
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,583
HOW BEAUTIFUL.

8
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,708
A RESORT, HUH?

9
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:31,666
I'D LIKE TO WITH
KAORU-SAMA SOMEDAY.

10
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,333
IF ONLY I COULD SEE
SUCH BEAUTIFUL SCENERY

11
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,625
TOGETHER WITH HIM.

12
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,541
( sighs )

13
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,875
WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS GOING

14
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,041
THROUGH MY HEAD BACK THEN?

15
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,000
BRINGING THESE FLYERS
WITH ME.

16
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,166
BUT...

17
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,708
BUT STILL,
WE WILL GO TOGETHER ONE DAY.

18
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,083
I'M SURE.

19
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,416
- Tina: WELL, WE JUST
HAVE TO INVITE THE LANDLORD

20
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,750
AND THE MANAGER TOO.

21
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,000
- Man: YEAH, GOOD IDEA.

22
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,166
- AFTER ALL, THE MORE
THE MERRIER, RIGHT?

23
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,916
- ( gasps )
OH, MY--

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,750
- WE'RE BACK, AOI-CHAN.

25
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,250
- UH, OH, HI.
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.

26
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,416
YOU ALL CAME BACK
RATHER EARLY.

27
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,583
- YEAH, WELL, ALL THREE OF US
JUST HAPPENED TO HAVE

28
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,916
ALL OF OUR AFTERNOON CLASSES
CANCELLED.

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,750
- MISS LANDLORD, COME WITH US.

30
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,416
WE'RE GOING TO THE HOT SPRINGS.

31
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,750
- HOT SPRINGS?

32
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,791
IS THAT SO?

33
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,208
- ( horn honks loudly )

34
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,958
- AHH!

35
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,958
THE MOUNTAIN AIR
SURE IS FRESH.

36
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,708
- ( bell rings )
- IT SURE IS.

37
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,833
WE FINALLY MADE IT.
- Taeko: HEY, EVERYONE.

38
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,916
- All: HUH?
- WOULD YOU PLEASE WAIT?

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,250
- TAEKO-CHAN?

40
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,083
- ( exhales )
HOLD ON.

41
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,208
( yelps )

42
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,041
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT THERE,
MISS TAEKO?

43
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,708
- AHH, I'M FINE.

44
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:58,083
I'M KINDA USED TO THESE
SORTA THINGS HAPPENING.

45
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:01,083
- HOLD ON, WHERE THE HECK
ARE THE LUNCH BOXES WE BROUGHT?

46
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,916
- MM?  HUH?

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,416
- ( horn honking )

48
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,416
- ( Taeko screams )

49
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,916
I'M SORRY, EVERYONE.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,916
- Sato:
AND I WANTED TO EAT IT TOO.

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,666
- Suzuki:
NOT MUCH WE CAN DO NOW.

52
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,000
GUESS WE'LL GIVE UP ON THEM
AND EAT OUT SOMEWHERE.

53
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,625
- Taeko: I'M REALLY SORRY.

54
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,458
- Tina:
HEY, CHEER UP, TAE.

55
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,750
WE'RE HAVING THE WELCOME PARTY

56
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,791
FOR NEW PHOTO CLUB
MEMBERS TODAY.

57
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,416
YOU'RE THE MAIN EVENT, TAE!

58
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,875
- Taeko: RIGHT...

59
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:30,000
- UH, EXCUSE ME, EVERYONE?

60
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,208
- YEAH?  WHAT'S UP, AOI-CHAN?

61
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,875
- IS IT REALLY ALL RIGHT
THAT I COME ALONG?

62
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,875
I'M NOT A MEMBER OF
THE PHOTOGRAPHY CLUB, AFTER ALL.

63
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,125
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

64
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,125
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT
A THING, MISS LANDLORD.

65
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,291
I WOULDN'T HAVE DRAGGED YOU
ALL THE WAY OUT HERE

66
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,708
IF IT WASN'T OKAY.

67
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,958
- YEAH, AND PRETTY GIRLS
ARE ALWAYS WELCOME IN MY BOOK.

68
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,250
- MAN, WISH I WAS
IN YOUR SHOES.

69
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,916
LIVING UNDER THE ROOF
OF A GORGEOUS LANDLORD.

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,541
- ( chuckles )

71
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:58,291
I SEE.  SO THAT'S THE WAY
IT LOOKS IN OTHER PEOPLE'S EYES.

72
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,458
- OH.
YOU ALL CERTAINLY KNOW

73
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,291
HOW TO FLATTER PEOPLE WELL,
DON'T YOU?

74
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,291
- ( all laugh )

75
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:09,250
- THE AIR REALLY IS
NICE OUT HERE.

76
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,416
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE

77
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,250
IF MISS MIYABI COULD HAVE
COME ALONG TOO.

78
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,791
- HMM.

79
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,250
THAT'S TRUE, BUT--

80
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,916
- I WAS ORIGINALLY PLANNING
TO GO WITH LADY AOI

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,083
ON THE GETAWAY TOMORROW,
BUT...

82
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,583
DUE TO WORK CIRCUMSTANCES,

83
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,875
I AM AFRAID THAT I WILL
HAVE TO PASS THIS TIME AROUND.

84
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,166
THEREFORE,

85
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,625
I'M ASKING YOU TO TAKE
THE BEST OF CARE!

86
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:34,500
THE BEST CARE OF LADY AOI,
IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?!

87
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,166
IF ANYTHING SHOULD
HAPPEN TO HER

88
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,208
UNDER YOUR WATCHFUL EYE,
SIR KAORU...

89
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,375
- MISS MIYABI SOUNDED LIKE
SHE'D REALLY KILL ME

90
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,625
IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO YOU.

91
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,041
- Tina: BY THE WAY, TAE...
- Both: HMM?

92
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,708
- ...WHEN THE HECK ARE WE
GONNA FINALLY REACH THE HOTEL?

93
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,208
- I'M NOT SURE.

94
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,625
- BUT DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT
IT WAS NEAR THE TRAIN STATION?

95
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,916
- Tina: TRAIN STATION?
- IF I RECALL,

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,583
THE TRAIN STATION SHOULD BE 
SOMEWHERE IN THIS DIRECTION.

97
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,041
- All: HUH?

98
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,750
- ( beeping )

99
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,333
- I'M SORRY.

100
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,250
MY SENSE OF DIRECTION'S
NOT SO GOOD.

101
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,583
- YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO KNOWS HOW TO GET THERE,

102
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,083
SINCE YOU MADE
THE RESERVATION,

103
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,083
SO GET A GRIP ALREADY,
MINAZUKI.

104
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:13,416
- RIGHT. THE HOTEL'S CALLED
THE MANOU INN, AND LET'S SEE...

105
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,083
LET'S SEE.

106
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,250
OH, I SEE IT NOW.
IT'S THAT WAY.

107
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,583
IF WE TAKE THIS PATH,

108
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:19,541
IT'LL BE A SHORTCUT.

109
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,125
- ( water rushing )

110
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,458
- UH...

111
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,375
I'M SORRY,
IT'S THIS WAY.

112
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,291
( chuckles nervously )

113
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,583
UH.

114
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,291
- MONKEY REGRET!

115
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,416
- ( laughing )

116
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,208
HEY, MR. MONKEY, UP HERE!

117
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,333
- I THINK IT'S OVER HERE.
( nervously chuckles )

118
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,083
- ARE YOU READY, EVERYONE?

119
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,416
- All: CHEESE!

120
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,583
- MAY-- MAYBE IT'S OVER
THIS WAY.

121
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:47,666
- ( all groaning )

122
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,958
- OH, NO.

123
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,208
- ( yawns )

124
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,208
JUST WHERE EXACTLY IS THIS HOTEL
WE'RE STAYING AT?

125
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,916
- WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR THREE HOURS.

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,916
- OH, I'M SORRY.

127
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,083
- HUH?

128
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,875
AOI-CHAN, ARE YOU DOING OKAY?
- HUH?

129
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,708
I AM PERFECTLY FINE.

130
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,958
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR CONCERN, KAORU-SAMA.

131
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,291
- GOOD TO HEAR.

132
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,750
AOI-CHAN LOOKS SO SMALL
AND FRAIL.

133
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:20,333
BUT SHE MIGHT BE
STRONGER THAN I THOUGHT.

134
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,166
- Taeko:
I'M SORRY!  I'M SORRY!

135
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,333
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED
WAS MY FAULT.

136
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,958
- TAEKO-CHAN, HOLD ON.
IF THE STATION'S THERE

137
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,041
AND THIS IS THE MAIN STREET,

138
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,625
AND THE HOTEL IS AT
THE END OF THE STREET...

139
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:35,708
UH--

140
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,625
- All: AAH!

141
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,375
- ( bell tolls )

142
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,791
- Kaoru: I WAS WONDERING WHAT
WOULD HAPPEN FOR A WHILE THERE.

143
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,291
- DESPITE IT ALL,

144
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,250
IT'S STILL GOOD THAT
WE FOUND THE HOTEL.

145
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,750
- MAN, I'M BEAT.

146
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,916
I WANNA GET TO THE HOT SPRINGS
PRONTO AND START RELAXING.

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,541
- Taeko: WHAT?!
- All: HUH?

148
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,500
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
 YOU DON'T SEE IT?

149
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,666
- I'M SORRY.
AS I ALREADY SAID,

150
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,666
THERE'S NO RESERVATION
UNDER THAT NAME.

151
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,541
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

152
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,541
I'M SURE THAT I MADE
A RESERVATION.

153
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,875
IT'S THE MEIRITSU UNIVERSITY
PHOTO CLUB.

154
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,458
- SO YOU SAY,
BUT IT'S NOT HERE.

155
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,625
- IT COULDN'T BE THAT
YOU MADE THE RESERVATION

156
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,875
FOR NEXT MONTH, COULD IT?
TAE?

157
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,208
- YOU KNOW WHAT, TINA?

158
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,250
EVEN IF WE ARE
TALKING ABOUT TAEKO-CHAN,

159
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,416
I DON'T THINK THAT SHE WOULD--

160
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,458
- OH, IT MUST BE 
THIS RESERVATION.

161
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,291
IT'S MADE FOR THIS DAY
NEXT YEAR.

162
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,750
- AAH!

163
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,750
- NO-- NO WAY.

164
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:26,666
- EXCUSE ME, ARE THERE ANY
AVAILABLE ROOMS NOW?

165
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,500
- UNFORTUNATELY,
WE'RE BOOKED SOLID TONIGHT.

166
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,291
AND THERE HAVEN'T BEEN
ANY CANCELLATIONS EITHER.

167
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,750
- ISN'T THERE ANYTHING THAT
YOU COULD DO FOR US?

168
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,416
- I'M AFRAID THAT
THERE REALLY ISN'T.

169
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,750
- KAORU-SAMA.

170
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:40,916
( slightly gasps )

171
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,416
- LADY AOI,
IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS,

172
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,541
THEN PLEASE,
USE THIS V.I.P. CARD.

173
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,500
MOST CORPORATIONS WILL DO
SOMETHING IF YOU HAVE THIS.

174
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,875
- ( all groan )

175
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,333
- I'M SORRY.
- WHAT NOW...?

176
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:59,958
- PARDON ME, ANY ROOM YOU
HAVE WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE.

177
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,666
ISN'T THERE ANY WAY?

178
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,000
- AS I SAID EARLIER,
WE'RE BOOKED SOLID--

179
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,083
HUH?

180
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,208
ISN'T-- ISN'T THIS...

181
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,375
( stammering )
GE-- GET A ROOM THIS INSTANT!

182
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,333
- Man: HUH, BUT AREN'T
WE BOOKED SOLID?

183
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,500
- JUST DO IT!
- YES, SIR!

184
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,458
- ( running footsteps )
- ( clears throat )

185
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,791
I AM TERRIBLY SORRY.

186
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,958
WE WILL HAVE A ROOM
PREPARED FOR YOU MOMENTARILY.

187
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,458
- I THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

188
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,750
- AOI-CHAN.

189
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,291
- THIS IS GREAT NEWS,
ISN'T IT?

190
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,583
- THANKS FOR THE SAVE.

191
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,000
WE CAN STAY.

192
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,916
AOI-CHAN HERE
TALKED THEM INTO IT.

193
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,291
- ALL RIGHT!

194
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,458
- THANK YOU SO MUCH, MISS AOI.

195
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,791
- YOU'RE SOMETHING ELSE,
MISS LANDLORD.

196
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,166
- EH, WAS NOTHING.

197
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,166
AFTER ALL,
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

198
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,125
THAT KAORU-SAMA AND I WILL--

199
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,958
- ( knocking )

200
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,041
- Tina:
AHH, IF THIS ISN'T HEAVEN,

201
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,041
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

202
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,333
NOTHING'S BETTER THAN
SOAKING IN THE HOT SPRINGS

203
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,000
AFTER A HARD DAY.

204
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,541
- YEAH, BUT...
( sighs )

205
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,041
IF IT WEREN'T
FOR WHAT I DID...

206
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,000
- Aoi: WHAT'S THE MATTER,
MISS TAEKO?

207
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,666
- MISS AOI.

208
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,833
I AM REALLY SUCH
A KLUTZ, YOU KNOW.

209
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:13,500
I JUST SEEM TO CAUSE TROUBLE
FOR ALL OF THE PEOPLE AROUND ME.

210
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,708
( deeply sighs )
LIKE TODAY.

211
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:20,250
I'M JUST THE TYPE OF PERSON 
WHO CAN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT.

212
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,291
- I DON'T THINK
THAT'S TRUE AT ALL.

213
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,916
MISS TAEKO.
- MISS AOI.

214
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,583
- DO YOUR BEST,

215
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,750
AND SOMEONE WILL ALWAYS BE THERE
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT EFFORT.

216
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,291
AND THAT'S TRUE
FOR THE BOTH OF US.

217
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,083
THAT'S WHY
I ALWAYS DO MY BEST

218
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,291
THINKING ABOUT
THAT PARTICULAR PERSON.

219
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,250
I CAN DO MY BEST

220
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,250
EVEN IN DIFFICULT SITUATIONS

221
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,916
WHEN I IMAGINE
THAT PERSON'S HAPPINESS.

222
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,083
SO, YOU SHOULD DO
YOUR BEST AS WELL TOO.

223
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,750
I'M SURE YOU CAN,
IF I COULD DO IT.

224
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,208
YOU KNOW I'LL BE
ROOTING FOR YOU.

225
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,375
- THANKS A LOT, MISS AOI.

226
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:58,041
- HEY, WHAT'S WITH
THE LONG FACES OVER THERE?

227
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,125
WE'RE ON A GETAWAY, AFTER ALL.

228
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,750
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HAVING
ALL THE FUN WE CAN.

229
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:03,875
RIGHT?

230
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,375
- RIGHT!

231
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,875
- Suzuki: ALL RIGHT!

232
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,791
WE CAN'T CALL IT A GETAWAY
IF WE DON'T HAVE A PARTY!

233
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,750
- HEY, THERE!

234
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,916
- WE'VE ALREADY STARTED.

235
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,958
- THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT 
A BLONDE WEARING A YUKATA.

236
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,250
- SHE LOOKS PRETTY GOOD
AT FIRST GLANCE.

237
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,750
- OH.  OW!

238
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,916
I'M SORRY FOR
KEEPING YOU WAITING.

239
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,416
- ( gulps )
- AMAZING'S ALL I CAN SAY.

240
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,416
- I THOUGHT TINA WAS
WELL-ENDOWED,

241
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,041
BUT SHE'S JUST HUGE.

242
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,333
- THANK YOU FOR WAITING.

243
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,916
- BEAUTIFUL.

244
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,416
- ELEGANT.

245
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,083
- YEAH.

246
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,208
- Tina: AND NOW IN HONOR OF
THE FURTHER EVOLUTION

247
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:48,000
OF THE MEIRITSU UNIVERSITY
PHOTO CLUB...

248
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,083
- All: CHEERS!

249
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,041
( laughter )

250
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,041
- Tina: BOTTOMS UP!
- ( gulping )

251
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,375
- ( chewing loudly )

252
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,583
- ( slurping )

253
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,625
- ( raucous laughter )

254
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,625
- SO, MINAZUKI...

255
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,541
- OH!
( coughs )

256
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,708
YES, CHIEF, WHAT CAN I
HELP YOU WITH?

257
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,916
- I'LL BE GIVING YOU AN
IMPORTANT ORDER TO FOLLOW NOW.

258
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,250
- OH?  AN IMPORTANT
ORDER TO FOLLOW?

259
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,000
- ( gulping )

260
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,541
- LOOK AT THIS PICTURE.

261
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:18,666
- HMM.

262
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,791
THIS IS...

263
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:30,625
OH.

264
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,125
WHAT IS THIS THING, ANYWAY?

265
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,125
- THAT'S A PICTURE
OF A HUMAN SOUL

266
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,583
THAT TWO COURAGEOUS FRESHMAN

267
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,291
NAMED SUZUKI AND
SATO MADE POSSIBLE.

268
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,000
- HMM.
- SO IT'S...

269
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,291
SUPERNATURAL.

270
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,750
- ( gasps )

271
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,875
- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU
HEAD OUT

272
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,416
TO THIS CERTAIN PLACE NOW.

273
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,583
IT'S A TEMPLE
THAT'S ABOUT A KILOMETER OUT

274
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,250
FROM THIS MOUNTAIN.

275
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:55,000
THAT TEMPLE BURIED DEEP
IN THE WOODS

276
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,416
IS A SPOT THAT'S FAMOUS
FOR ITS GHOSTS.

277
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,083
GHOSTS ARE GUARANTEED
TO BE THERE WHEN YOU GO.

278
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,750
ALL NEW MEMBERS ARE
REQUIRED TO GO THERE,

279
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,916
AND TAKE A PICTURE
OF A GHOST!

280
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,250
THIS IS A TRADITION
OF THE MEIRITSU PHOTO CLUB!

281
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,791
CALLED THE "PHOTO SHOOT
TRIAL OF COURAGE"!

282
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,958
AND TODAY IS THE DAY!

283
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,750
MINAZUKI, IT'S YOUR TURN!

284
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,750
AND I'LL TELL YOU NOW
THAT IT HASN'T BEEN JUST US.

285
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,958
HANABISHI AND TINA DID IT TOO.

286
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,791
IT'S A TRADITION.

287
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,708
IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU CAN'T BACK OUT OF IT,

288
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,166
SO DON'T EVEN TRY!

289
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,333
- ( shuddering )

290
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,291
I AM NEVER GOING THERE AGAIN.

291
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,500
- SO YOU'D BETTER GET READY.

292
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,500
- WOW!

293
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,833
THAT'S A WONDERFUL TRADITION
TO HAVE, CHIEF.

294
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,791
THESE KINDS OF CULT THINGS
REALLY APPEAL TO ME, YOU KNOW?

295
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,125
- MINAZUKI,

296
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,666
DO YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND
WHAT WE WANT YOU TO DO?

297
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,708
- ALL YOU WANT ME TO
DO IS FIND A GHOST

298
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,333
AND TAKE A PHOTOGRAPH, RIGHT?!

299
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,708
I WILL DO MY BEST, CHIEF!

300
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,166
WELL, THEN, I'LL BE GOING NOW!

301
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,166
- GOOD LUCK, MINAZUKI.

00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,083
I'M ALSO WORRIED ABOUT 
MISS TAEKO, KAORU-SAMA.

320
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,416
- AOI-CHAN.

321
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,916
- ( wind blowing )

322
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,125
- IT'S PITCH-BLACK.

323
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,416
FOLLOW ME.

324
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,833
AND DON'T EVER LEAVE
MY SIDE, AOI-CHAN, OKAY?

325
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,083
- RIGHT.

326
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:12,166
MISS TAEKO!
- TAEKO-CHAN!

327
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,166
- MISS TAEKO!

328
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,583
- TAEKO-CHAN!

329
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,375
- ( wood creaking )

330
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,166
- OH.

331
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,208
- THE WIND'S PICKING UP
AND THE FOG TOO.

332
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,833
- ( squawks )

333
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,000
- AAH.

334
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,500
JUST-- JUST A BIRD.

335
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,666
THAT SURPRISED ME.
( exhales )

336
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,000
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SCARY
IF I WAS ALONE.

337
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,833
( chuckles )
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, AOI-CHAN?

338
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,416
- OH.

339
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,166
I AM PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT.

340
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,875
BUT WE OUGHT TO HURRY.

341
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,541
I'M CERTAIN MISS TAEKO
MUST FEEL OVERWHELMED,

342
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,250
SINCE SHE'S ALL ALONE
RIGHT NOW.

343
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,916
- YE-- YEAH.
THAT'S TRUE.

344
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,791
I'M IMPRESSED.

345
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,375
AOI-CHAN ISN'T SCARED OF
THINGS LIKE THIS?

346
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,000
HERE IT IS.

347
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,333
- WHERE'S MISS TAEKO?

348
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,833
- TAEKO-CHAN!
- MISS TAEKO!

349
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,291
- TAEKO-CHAN!

350
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,875
- WHERE ARE YOU,
MISS TAEKO!

351
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,958
COULD SHE BE
INSIDE THE TEMPLE?

352
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,791
- MAYBE.

353
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,500
SHE'S NOT HERE.

354
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,625
WHERE COULD SHE
HAVE GOTTEN TO?

355
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,833
- UH, KAORU-SAMA?
- HUH?

356
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,291
- L-- LOOK THERE.

357
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,291
- ( whirring )

358
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,500
- IT'S HERE!

359
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,166
- Both: OHH!

360
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,708
- WHAT THE-- IS THAT YOU
OVER THERE, SENPAI?

361
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:03,541
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
ALL THE WAY OUT HERE?

362
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,416
- ( stammers )
TAEKO-CHAN.

363
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,250
- OHH, SO THAT'S IT.

364
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,458
- BUT IN ANY CASE,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, MISS TAEKO?

365
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:13,958
YOU'RE NOT HURT, ARE YOU?

366
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:17,416
- NO.  I WAS JUST SO ENGROSSED
IN TAKING PICTURES

367
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,208
THAT I REALLY WASN'T
KEEPING TRACK OF THE TIME.

368
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,916
I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE
HOW MUCH TIME HAD GONE BY.

369
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,708
- I... SEE.

370
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,625
- I'M REALLY SORRY.

371
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,083
IT LOOKS LIKE I'VE BEEN
CAUSING TROUBLE FOR YOU AGAIN.

372
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,541
- WELL, I'M JUST GLAD
YOU WERE ALL RIGHT.

373
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,666
YOU'RE DONE TAKING
YOUR PICTURES, RIGHT?

374
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,791
LET'S GET BACK TO
THE HOTEL, OKAY? 

375
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:37,791
- ( all gasp )

376
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,916
- Aoi:
THERE'S SO MUCH FOG.

377
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,250
- ( Kaoru sighs )
 THIS ISN'T GOOD.

378
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,083
WE CAN'T SEE A THING NOW.

379
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,583
- Taeko:
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

380
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,958
IT'S A STRAIGHT PATH
BACK TO THE HOTEL.

381
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,958
- PERHAPS,
BUT I THINK IT'S BEST

382
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,125
IF WE WAIT HERE
FOR THE FOG TO CLEAR.

383
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:57,291
WE PASSED BY SOME CLIFFS
AND A RIVER ALONG THE WAY HERE.

384
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,291
IF WE WERE TO STRAY
FROM THE PATH,

385
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,958
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY
THAT WE COULD END UP IN DANGER.

386
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:05,458
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
LET'S WAIT FOR THE FOG TO CLEAR.

387
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:09,333
- I HOPE THAT MISS TINA AND THE
OTHERS ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT US.

388
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,291
- ( bell dings )
- ( all snoring loudly )

389
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,500
- WHAT'S THIS?
TAEKO-CHAN'S ASLEEP ALREADY.

390
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,500
- SHE MUST HAVE BEEN
VERY TIRED.

391
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,958
- YEAH, LOOKS THAT WAY.

392
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,125
- ( shivering )

393
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,791
- ARE YOU COLD?

394
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,083
- NO.  OHH.

395
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,666
I FEEL RELIEVED NOW,
BUT...

396
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,000
- HUH?

397
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,958
- ACTUALLY,
TO TELL THE TRUTH,

398
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:39,666
IT WAS REALLY FRIGHTENING FOR ME
TO COME ALL THE WAY OUT HERE.

399
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,000
- THEN WHY'D YOU
 PUT UP WITH IT?

400
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:45,000
- WELL, IT'S BEEN
MY DREAM LATELY

401
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,916
TO GO ON A GETAWAY
WITH YOU, KAORU-SAMA.

402
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,583
- I GET IT.

403
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,333
- ( inaudible )
- ( slow piano melody playing )

404
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,000
- THE REASON
SHE LOOKED COMPOSED

405
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,375
WASN'T BECAUSE 
SHE WAS STRONG,

406
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,250
BUT BECAUSE SHE WAS
GOING OUT OF HER WAY

407
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,875
TO KEEP ME FROM
WORRYING ABOUT HER.

408
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,958
THE REAL AOI-CHAN WAS
ACTUALLY...

409
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,333
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
DON'T WORRY ANYMORE.

410
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,458
- I'M SORRY.

411
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,041
OH.  OH.

412
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:15,875
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

413
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,958
I CAN'T SEEM
TO STOP TREMBLING.

414
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,666
- MM.

415
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,375
AOI-CHAN?
- YES?

416
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,333
( exhales )

417
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,750
KA-- KAORU-SAMA?

418
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,083
- YOUR TREMBLING,
IT STOPPED.

419
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,916
- OH.

420
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,875
( gasps )

421
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,458
- ( chuckles )

422
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,625
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

423
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,458
IT MOST CERTAINLY HAS.

424
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,458
- ( both chuckle softly )

425
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:56,958
- KAORU-SAMA?

426
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,166
- AOI-CHAN!
- HUH?

427
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,791
- GOOD MORNING.

428
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,333
COME ON OVER HERE.

429
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,083
- ( exhales )
SURE.

430
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,875
THIS IS...

431
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,833
- SEE?  IT'S BEAUTIFUL,
DON'T YOU THINK?

432
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,666
- YES.  AMAZING.

433
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,625
- ( soft flute music playing )

434
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:35,333
- ANOTHER DREAM OF MINE
HAS COME TRUE.

435
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,333
- WHAT'S THAT?

436
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,500
- NOTHING.

437
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,291
IT'S REALLY NOTHING AT ALL.

438
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,500
UM, KAORU-SAMA?

439
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:50,166
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO 
TAKE ME SOMEWHERE AGAIN?

440
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,000
- HMM?

441
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,916
- THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME

442
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,750
THAT I WAS EVER ABLE TO
GO ON A FIELD TRIP LIKE THIS.

443
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,750
- SURE.  THE PHOTO CLUB
HAS PLENTY OF OTHER TRIPS

444
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,958
BESIDES THIS GETAWAY.

445
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:05,625
- I MEAN, UM...

446
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:06,750
JUST THE TWO OF US.

447
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,250
- ( laughs )

448
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,333
YEAH, LET'S JUST GO
BY OURSELVES NEXT TIME.

449
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,708
- LET'S.

450
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:15,083
- WE'D BETTER GO WAKE
TAEKO-CHAN UP AND GET BACK.

451
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,250
- MISS TINA AND THE OTHERS
MUST BE WAITING.

452
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,916
- WELL, LET'S GO.

453
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,083
- ( door opens )
- SENPAI!

454
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,750
I DID IT!

455
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,416
I GOT A GREAT PICTURE.

456
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,541
LOOK AT ALL THE GHOSTS.

457
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,916
- ( both gasp )
NO WAY!

458
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,416
- IS SOMETHING THE MATTER,
SENPAI?

459
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,583
- WELL, YOU SEE...

460
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,416
IT'S NOT AS GOOD
AS THE ONE WE TOOK,

461
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,583
BUT I'LL ADMIT THAT
YOU GOT THE RIGHT ATTITUDE

462
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,958
TOWARDS PHOTOGRAPHY,
MINAZUKI.

463
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,750
- DEVELOP YOUR TECHNICAL SKILLS

464
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,333
AND YOU'LL BE A PROUD
MEMBER OF THE PHOTO CLUB.

465
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:47,458
- YES, SIR!

466
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,416
I'LL CONTINUE TO DO
MY VERY BEST!

467
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,166
- ( bell dings )

468
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:55,125
- ( theme music playing )

469
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,125
- ( singing in Japanese )

470
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:24,208
- Tina: HEY, MISS LANDLORD,
WHAT'S WHITE AND WARM

471
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,083
AND GOES "SQUEAK SQUEAK"?
WHAT IS IT?!

472
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:27,166
- ( doorbell rings )
- Aoi: KAORU-SAMA?

473
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,500
- Tina: HUH?

474
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:31,083
- "AI YORI AOSHI:
CHERISHED TREASURE"!

475
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:32,250
( giggles )

476
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:33,416
OH, THAT TICKLES!

477
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,458
OH, NO! NOT HERE!
