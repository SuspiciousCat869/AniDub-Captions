1
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,500
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:03,375
- THEY'RE SO CUTE!

4
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,875
- ...is a very rare
breed of monkeys

5
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,833
that were brought over
from China.

6
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:10,125
Their trademark characteristic
is the golden fur

7
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,833
that covers their
foreheads, chest, and limbs.

8
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,583
Tomorrow will be 
the very last day

9
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,125
that these monkeys
will be on display

10
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,791
at the...
- ( beeps )

11
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,416
- SO TOMORROW WE'RE ALL
GONNA GO HAVE A PHOTO SESSION

12
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,916
WITH THOSE GOLDEN MONKEYS.

13
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,333
- TOMORROW, JUST LIKE THAT?

14
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,208
- I WAS WONDERING WHY
YOU CALLED THIS MEETING

15
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,416
DURING SUMMER BREAK.

16
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,500
SO THAT'S WHAT IT WAS,
HUH?

17
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,333
- LET'S MAKE THIS TRIP
MANDATORY.

18
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,583
- Both: MOTION DENIED!

19
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,083
- ALL RIGHT, IT'S DECIDED.

20
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,375
WE'LL MEET AT 10:00 A.M. 
AT THE GENFU ANIMAL PARK.

21
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:35,750
YOU'D BETTER BE THERE!

22
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,166
- Sato and Suzuki:
WOULD YOU QUIT IGNORING US?!

23
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,208
- WHAT?

24
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,375
YOU CAN'T COME WITH US?

25
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:46,916
- I APOLOGIZE.

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,583
I JUST HAVE SO MUCH TO DO.

27
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,541
NOT ONLY THE LAUNDRY,
BUT A LOT OF OTHER

28
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:51,791
LITTLE ERRANDS TOO.

29
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,541
- ( sighs )

30
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,750
THE MANAGER HAD 
SOME WORK TO DO,

31
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:58,125
TAE HAD TO SUPERVISE
THE ROOF REPAIRS.

32
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,791
WHO CARES ABOUT THAT
STUPID OLD ROOF ANYWAY?

33
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:01,916
- YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO COMPLAINED

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,541
IT WAS LEAKING
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

35
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:04,916
- DIDN'T HAVE TO
FIX IT TODAY.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,125
- ACTUALLY, IT WAS IMPORTANT
THAT THE REPAIR MAN

37
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,875
FIX IT TODAY.
THERE'S SUPPOSEDLY

38
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,583
A GOOD CHANCE
IT'LL RAIN AFTER ALL.

39
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,250
- BUT IT'S OUR FAULT,
I GUESS.

40
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,916
GIVING YOU SUCH
SHORT NOTICE.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,458
- PLEASE DON'T 
WORRY ABOUT IT.

42
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,458
TODAY'S THE LAST DAY
THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE 

43
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,416
TO SEE THE GOLDEN MONKEYS,
RIGHT?

44
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,250
WHEN YOU COME BACK,
PLEASE TELL ME HOW THEY WERE.

45
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,375
- OH, SURE.

46
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,958
MISS LANDLORD AND TAE DON'T
GET HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS. 

47
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,250
- WHY DON'T YOU
QUIT GRUMBLING 

48
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,916
AND TRY TO CHEER UP,
OKAY?

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,750
- YOU KNOW,
SUZUKI AND SATO

50
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,750
SURE ARE LATE TODAY. 
- ( cellphone rings )

51
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:46,791
- HMM?

52
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,750
HEY, I'VE GOT MAIL.

53
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,000
- ( beeps )
- AAH!

54
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,916
- I GUESS THE MAIL'S
FROM THOSE TWO, HUH?

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,333
- Tina: SUZUKI'S GOING ON
TRAIN FESTIVAL,

56
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:58,000
AND SATO'S GOING TO
A COSPLAY FASHION SHOW.

57
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,750
THOSE DAMN DESERTERS!

58
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,416
I'LL GET THOSE
BASTARDS FOR THIS.

59
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,875
- THEY FOUND A WAY OUT,
HUH?

60
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,125
- AWW!  I WAS SO
EXCITED ABOUT THIS

61
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,041
THAT I COULDN'T EVEN
SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

62
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,583
- HEY, DON'T BE SO UPSET.

63
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,916
YOU'VE STILL GOT ME,
AND I'M HAPPY TO HANG OUT.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,375
- HUH?

65
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,833
- COME ON.  I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO SEE THE GOLDEN MONKEYS.

66
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,125
- ( camera shutter clicks )

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,291
- ( laughs )

68
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,333
( humming )

69
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,125
- Kaoru: IT WAS TOUCH
AND GO FOR AWHILE THERE,

70
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,083
BUT I'M GLAD
HER MOOD'S IMPROVED.

71
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,541
- OH, LOOK, KAORU!
A PENGUIN FAMILY. 

72
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,083
( giggles )
WHAT CUTE BABIES.

73
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,750
- YOU REALLY LIKE ANIMALS
A WHOLE LOT, DON'T YOU, TINA?

74
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:44,833
- YEP!

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,708
( whines )

76
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,125
- IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?

77
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,791
WHY IS IT THAT
YOU'RE SO SAD TODAY?

78
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,916
- OH, UZUME,
IT'S JUST THAT NOBODY

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,791
UNDERSTANDS HOW I FEEL.

80
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,208
I DID WANT TO GO OUT
TO SEE THE MONKEYS, 

81
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,875
BUT SPENDING TIME
WITH EVERYONE,

82
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,958
THAT'S WHAT I FELT WAS
IMPORTANT TODAY. 

83
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,000
- THERE'S NO REASON
TO BE SO SAD.

84
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,916
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,
IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED,

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,416
DO DO AGAIN.

86
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,125
- IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED,
TRY TRY AGAIN.

87
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,958
- OH! TSURUBE SENPAI.

88
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,916
- AMAZING.
YOU SURE KNOW A LOT.

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,916
- YOU HUMANS REALLY LAUGH AND
CRY OVER THE SILLIEST THINGS.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,458
- THEY SURE DO.
BUT WHO CARES

91
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,000
AS LONG AS THEIR 
FOOD'S DELICIOUS.

92
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,625
- HEY, BY THE WAY,
WHO ARE YOU?

93
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,916
- IT'D BE SO MUCH FUN

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,875
IF I REALLY COULD
TALK TO THE ANIMALS.

95
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,041
- THAT'S JUST LIKE YOU,
TINA.

96
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,083
- ( camera shutter clicks )

97
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:32,833
- ( laughs ) THE REAL THING'S
EVEN CUTER THAN IT WAS ON TV.

98
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,250
- I'M GLAD YOU GOT
TO SEE THEM.

99
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,250
- YEAH.
HEY, DO ME A FAVOR.

100
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,083
TAKE A PICTURE OF ME
WITH THE MONKEYS.

101
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,125
- OKAY.
I'M TAKING IT.

102
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,208
- ALL READY.

103
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,333
- OH, WOULD YOU
LIKE ME TO TAKE IT?

104
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:45,125
- HUH?
- YEAH, WE'D APPRECIATE IT.

105
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,250
- COULD YOU TWO STAND
A LITTLE CLOSER?

106
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,375
- YEAH, SURE!
( laughs )

107
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,458
- UH--
- ( laughs )

108
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,583
SO, KAORU...
- HMM?

109
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,416
- DO YOU THINK THAT LADY
WHO TOOK OUR PICTURE

110
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,291
THOUGHT WE WERE
GOING OUT OR SOMETHING?

111
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,458
- GOING OUT?!
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT?

112
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,583
- OH, YOU'RE STARTING
TO BLUSH THERE.

113
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,416
( laughs )

114
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,750
- WHAT THE HECK?

115
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,291
- HUH?

116
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,250
- WHAT IS IT?
- OVER THERE.

117
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,791
LOOK AT THAT.
- WHAT?

118
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,791
OHH.  LOOKS LIKE
SOME KIND OF ATTRACTION.

119
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,958
- ( murmurs )

120
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,250
- WANT TO GO?

121
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,000
- MM-HMM!

122
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:33,375
- WELCOME TO ANIMAL FANTASY'S
ADVENTURE PALACE OF LOVE.

123
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,458
FROM THIS POINT ON, YOU WILL
SPLIT INTO TWO GROUPS

124
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,791
AND PROCEED THROUGH THIS
DANGEROUS MYSTICAL JUNGLE.

125
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,083
YOUR GOAL IS TO
FIND YOUR WAY OUT.

126
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,375
THE TREASURE OF
YOUR DREAMS AWAITS YOU

127
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,583
BEYOND THE JUNGLE!

128
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,333
AAH!

129
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,041
- ( rustling )
- ( gasps )

130
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,375
( sighs )

131
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,000
- ( screams )

132
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,041
( chuckles )

133
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,916
( panting )

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,916
HUH?

135
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,208
HUH?

136
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,416
- HUH?

137
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,916
IS THIS THE END
OF THE JUNGLE? 

138
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,791
- CHARARIN!

139
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,125
CONGRATULATIONS ON
SURVIVING THE JUNGLE!

140
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,250
- UH... OH, THANKS.

141
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,416
- MY NAME IS CHARARIN
AND I'M A FAIRY.

142
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,750
- OH, HI.

143
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,083
- ANOTHER CHALLENGE AWAITS YOU,
BRAVE YOUNG LADY.

144
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:38,083
AND YOU MUST NOW DECIDE
WHICH DIRECTION YOUR DESTINY

145
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,875
WILL CHARARIN!

146
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,541
CHOOSE ONE OF
THESE THREE DOORS

147
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,208
THAT STAND DIRECTLY
BEHIND ME.

148
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,916
THE COSTUME THAT
YOU WILL FIND INSIDE

149
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,583
WILL REFLECT
YOUR TRUE FEELINGS

150
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,750
TOWARDS YOUR PARTNER.

151
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,291
- FEELINGS TOWARDS
MY PARTNER?

152
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,750
- ( screams )

153
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,041
- THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

154
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,083
IF HE'S A FRIEND,
CHOOSE THE BLACK DOOR

155
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,208
FOR AN ANIMAL SUIT.

156
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,583
IF HE'S MORE THAN A FRIEND,

157
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,416
CHOOSE THE BLUE DOOR
FOR A UNIFORM,

158
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,083
AND A WHITE DOOR
FOR A WEDDING GOWN!

159
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,500
THAT'S THE PROOF THAT YOU'RE
TRULY IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER.

160
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,125
- IF YOUR PARTNER
MAKES IT HERE

161
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,666
AND CHOOSES THE SAME DOOR,

162
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,458
WE WILL PRESENT YOU WITH
THE TREASURE OF YOUR DREAMS.

163
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,416
PLEASE BE SURE
TO CHOOSE WISELY.

164
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,541
CHARARIN!

165
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,875
- Tina: I'D HAVE TO SAY IT'S THE
BLUE DOOR AND THE UNIFORM.

166
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,041
BUT THEN...

167
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,916
- I SEE IT'S THE WHITE DOOR,
RIGHT?

168
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,583
- HUH?!  HOLD ON!
- YOUR DESTINY HAS BEEN DECIDED.

169
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,416
IT'S CHARARIN!

170
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,916
- SOMEONE HELP ME!

171
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,833
- ( squawks )

172
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,250
- WHAT DO I DO NOW?

173
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,583
I KIND OF WENT
WITH THE FLOW AND PUT IT ON,

174
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,250
BUT I GUESS IT'S OKAY.

175
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,250
I ALWAYS WANTED
TO WEAR ONE.

176
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,916
AND IT'S NOT LIKE
KAORU'S EVER GONNA SEE THIS.

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,791
THOUGH MAYBE SOMEWHERE
DEEP INSIDE,

178
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,250
I WISH THAT HE COULD.

179
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,916
( gasps )

180
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,250
WHAT WOULD I DO

181
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,250
IF KAORU ACTUALLY
CAME IN HERE?

182
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,416
( chuckles )
THAT'D NEVER HAPPEN THOUGH.

183
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,000
IT IS ME AFTER ALL.

184
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,916
I DON'T THINK HE'D CHOOSE
THIS ROOM AND ME.

185
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,958
- Woman: WE'RE ALL DONE.
- HUH?

186
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,166
( sighs )

187
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:20,041
IF KAORU OPENED THAT DOOR
AND CAME IN HERE--

188
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,958
NO, THAT'D NEVER HAPPEN.

189
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,916
THERE'S NO WAY KAORU WOULD 
EVER CHOOSE THE WHITE DOOR.

190
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,416
BUT IF HE DID...

191
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,916
I'D BE... SO...

192
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,916
SO...

193
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,041
OH, KAORU.

194
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,583
- ( gasps )

195
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,125
( exhales )

196
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,916
- ( gasps )
KAORU?

197
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,833
- ( gasps )

198
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,500
- YOU ACTUALLY CAME HERE!

199
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,875
- TINA?

200
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,833
- YOU JERK! 
- ( grunts )

201
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,166
- JEEZ, I CAN'T BELIEVE

202
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,916
YOU CAME IN THROUGH THE
WHITE DOOR, KAORU.

203
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,666
WHAT THE HECK WERE
YOU THINKING DOING THAT?

204
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,041
HEY, WAIT A SECOND.

205
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,333
THERE'S JUST ONE ANSWER.

206
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,083
BUT WHAT I WANT TO KNOW
IS WHEN YOU STARTED

207
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,666
THINKING OF ME
IN THAT WAY.

208
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,125
I WAS SO WORRIED
ALL THIS TIME

209
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,750
AND IT WAS ALL FOR NOTHING.
YOU JERK JERK JERK.

210
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,625
- THAT HURTS, YOU KNOW!
- ( chuckles )

211
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,458
- THAT WAS CLOSE. 
I'M GLAD I MANAGED

212
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,583
TO GET AWAY FROM
THAT TERROR OF AN OSTRICH.

213
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:12,708
- HUH?  AN OSTRICH?

214
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,583
- YEAH, IT WAS
THIS HUGE ONE.

215
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,041
I GOT INTO THIS ROOM
JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME.

216
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,416
- YOU WERE CHASED?

217
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,250
YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT
YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE

218
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,750
ONE OF THE THREE DOORS?

219
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,333
- YEAH.  WAS THERE REALLY
MORE THAN ONE DOOR OUT THERE?

220
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,458
I WAS IN SUCH A HURRY,
I DIDN'T NOTICE.

221
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,125
YOU KNOW, I'VE HAD
A HORRIBLE TIME

222
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,541
EVER SINCE WE SPLIT UP.

223
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,125
I DON'T SEE HOW ANYBODY
COULD EVER FIND THIS PLACE FUN.

224
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,625
UHH?

225
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,958
( grunting )

226
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,750
- ( chewing )

227
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,750
- TINA...

228
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,583
YOU KNOW--
- ( scoffs )

229
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,250
- HUH?
- ( crying )

230
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,291
- HUH?

231
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,125
- ( crying )

232
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:05,333
- IT APPEARS TO HAVE
STARTED RAINING, LADY AOI.

233
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,750
- WHAT?  OH NO.

234
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,750
- WE'D BETTER BRING
THE LAUNDRY INSIDE THE HOUSE.

235
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,083
- LET'S HURRY, MISS TAEKO.
- RIGHT.

236
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,750
- Miyabi:
OH, I'LL HELP YOU OUT AS WELL.

237
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,500
- Taeko: THANK YOU.

238
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,916
- Woman:
A LOST CHILD HAS BEEN FOUND.

239
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,833
WILL THE FATHER OF
AKIKO NAKAZOWA,

240
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,583
WILL THE FATHER OF
AKIKO NAKAZOWA

241
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,375
PLEASE REPORT TO
THE MANAGEMENT OFFICE.

242
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,208
- YOUR DADDY WILL 
BE HERE REAL SOON.

243
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,250
- IT'S REALLY STARTING
TO COME DOWN.

244
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,833
TINA, I THINK WE SHOULD 
START HEADING BACK SOON.

245
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,583
- YEAH, I GUESS SO.

246
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,291
- OHH?

247
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,583
- ( chuckles )

248
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,791
DON'T YOU WORRY.
YOUR NEW BIG SISTER

249
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,083
WILL STAY RIGHT HERE WITH YOU
UNTIL YOUR DADDY GETS HERE.

250
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,083
- ( giggles )

251
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,041
- ( chuckles )

252
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,208
- ( door opens )
- HMM?

253
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,666
- EXCUSE ME.
- PAPA!

254
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,541
- Because it's
a stationary front,

255
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,625
the entire Kanto region
will experience

256
00:11:58,708 --> 00:11:59,750
heavy rainfall tonight.

257
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,791
There will be scattered
thunder storms,

258
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,833
and the rain will likely
become heavier during the night.

259
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,625
- ( thunder )
- ( both scream )

260
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,541
- IT'S QUITE A SUMMER STORM,
ISN'T IT?

261
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,916
- SO WHEN I WAS
WATCHING THE PENGUINS,

262
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,750
I SAW ONE OF THEM
SLIP AND FALL OVER.

263
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:18,458
- ( giggles ) BOY, YOU DON'T
SEE THAT HAPPEN EVERY DAY.

264
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,833
THE POOR PENGUIN.
- ( giggling )

265
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,916
- SEE YOU LATER,
BIG SISTER!

266
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,250
- SEE YOU.  BYE-BYE.

267
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,291
- THANKS AGAIN
FOR ALL YOUR HELP.

268
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:36,083
- I THINK WE'D BETTER
HURRY BACK HOME NOW, TINA.

269
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,125
- YEAH, SURE.

270
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,625
- Kaoru and Tina:
WHAT?!

271
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,958
- THERE WAS A MUDSLIDE
THAT OCCURRED UP AHEAD,

272
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,708
SO THE TRAINS ARE
STOPPED FOR NOW. 

273
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,333
- Kaoru: WHEN WILL THEY
BE BACK IN SERVICE?

274
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,791
- THEY SHOULD BE RUNNING
TOMORROW MORNING.

275
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,750
- Tina: TOMORROW MORNING?

276
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,583
LOOKS LIKE JUST ABOUT 
EVERY PLACE IS CLOSED.

277
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,250
- THERE AREN'T
ANY TAXIS AROUND.

278
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,750
THINGS AREN'T
LOOKING UP FOR US.

279
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,125
- MAYBE THERE'S A KARAOKE
PLACE AROUND HERE

280
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,583
WE COULD STAY AT.
- I'LL LOOK OVER THERE,

281
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,583
SO YOU WAIT RIGHT HERE
FOR ME, OKAY?

282
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:02,916
- HOLD ON, KAORU.

283
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,375
( sighs )

284
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:07,916
( shivers )

285
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,583
- ( cellphone rings )
- HUH?

286
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,750
- OH, IS THAT YOU,
MISS TINA?

287
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,083
THIS IS AOI.

288
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,416
- Tina: Miss landlord.
- Aoi: Are you all right?

289
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,916
Have you managed
to keep dry?

290
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,208
- YEAH, MORE OR LESS.

291
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,583
WE'RE NOT TOTALLY
WET OR DRY,

292
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,958
BUT WE'LL BE FINE.

293
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,166
THE REAL PROBLEM IS
THE TRAINS AREN'T RUNNING.

294
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,500
- WHAT?  THEY'RE NOT?

295
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,750
- Tina:
Yeah, unfortunately.

296
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,583
BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST
TRYING TO FIND SOME SHELTER

297
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,583
FROM THE RAIN.
- Aoi: Oh my. 

298
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,250
Shall I ask Miss Miyabi
to pick you up?

299
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,916
- Tina:
No, we'll be fine.

300
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,083
IF WORST COMES TO WORST,
WE CAN SPEND THE NIGHT TOGETHER

301
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,875
AT A PRIVATE KARAOKE PLACE.

302
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,000
- UH, SPEND THE NIGHT TOGETHER?

303
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,000
- HUH?  OH.
( chuckles )

304
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:47,208
WHEN I SAY THAT,
I DON'T MEAN THAT WAY, YOU KNOW?

305
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,583
- UH, OF COURSE NOT.

306
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:49,750
( chuckles nervously )

307
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,208
- ( both laughing )

308
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,583
- MR. SUZUKI AND MR. SATO
ARE WITH YOU AS WELL, RIGHT?

309
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,583
- UH...
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.

310
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,208
PLEASE BE CAREFUL
NOT TO CATCH A COLD

311
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,708
IN THIS DREADFUL WEATHER.

312
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,250
- Tina: Oh, sure.

313
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,750
- PLEASE GIVE MY REGARDS
TO KAORU-SAMA TOO.

314
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,458
- ( dial tone )

315
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,416
- ( sighs )
OH WELL.

316
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,583
- PHONE CALL?
- ( gasps )

317
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:15,916
UHH...
- HUH?

318
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,750
- THAT'S RIGHT.
FROM MISS LANDLORD.

319
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,791
- FROM AOI-CHAN?
DID SHE SOUND WORRIED?

320
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,250
- YEAH, BUT I TOLD HER
YOU AND ME WOULD BE JUST FINE.

321
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,333
SO WERE YOU ABLE TO
FIND A PLACE TO STAY?

322
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,583
- NO, NOT REALLY.
- OH, I SEE.

323
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,708
THINGS AREN'T LOOKING
TOO GOOD, HUH?

324
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,750
I THINK I SEE A PLACE.

325
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,083
- ALL RIGHT.
IT'S A GODSEND.

326
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,125
- ( laughs )

327
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,750
- ( both stammer )

328
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,625
- I DON'T THINK
THIS IS A KARAOKE PLACE.

329
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,375
- SURE DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE IT. 

330
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,916
- BUT THEY DO HAVE
KARAOKE MACHINES HERE.

331
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,916
( chuckles nervously )

332
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,333
- I GUESS THERE'S
A SILVER LINING

333
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,000
IN EVERY CLOUD, HUH?

334
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,916
IT'S JUST SHELTER
FROM THE STORM.

335
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,125
- YEAH.

336
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,125
WE'RE JUST
GETTING SHELTER.

337
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:13,416
- ( heart beating )

338
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,833
- ( elevator dings )

339
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,333
- ( murmurs )

340
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,666
( sighs )

341
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,208
- TINA?
- ( gasps )

342
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,208
YEAH, KAORU?

343
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,583
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

344
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,583
- TOWEL?
- OH.

345
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:39,958
THANK YOU.
I COULD USE ONE.

346
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,916
- WHY DON'T WE SEE
WHAT'S ON TV NOW? 

347
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,125
- YEAH, WHY NOT?

348
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,583
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A GREAT IDEA.

349
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:52,916
- ( clicker beeps )

350
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,916
- Oh yeah!

351
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,541
- ( both stammer )

352
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,000
- Tina: I THINK I'M GONNA
GO TAKE A SHOWER NOW.

353
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,333
- OKAY.

354
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,041
- I AM SOAKED RIGHT DOWN
TO MY PANTIES.

355
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,291
- PANTIES?

356
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,000
- YOU'RE PRETTY SOAKED YOURSELF,
AREN'T YOU?

357
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,250
- YEAH, I'M PRETTY WET,
ALL RIGHT.

358
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,125
- YOU WANT TO JOIN ME
IN THE SHOWER THEN?

359
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,916
( laughing )

360
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,458
YOU'RE CUTE
WHEN YOU BLUSH.

361
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:14,833
IT'S TOO EASY
WITH YOU.

362
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,083
- ( door closes )
- ( stammers )

363
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,625
( sighs )

364
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,291
- ( shivering )

365
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,583
- Kaoru:
♪ AND THAT'S A SMALL ♪

366
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,083
♪ FRAGILE LOVE. ♪

367
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,916
THANKS FOR PUTTING UP
WITH THAT.

368
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,791
- OH, COME ON.
YOU DID A GREAT JOB, KAORU.

369
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,708
WELL, GUESS I'M GOING NEXT.
LET'S SEE NOW.

370
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:46,208
YOU KNOW, YOU CAUGHT ME
TOTALLY BY SURPRISE EARLIER.

371
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,875
- HUH?  WHEN WAS THAT?

372
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,583
- Kaoru: WHEN YOU WORE
THAT WEDDING GOWN.

373
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,375
IT WAS REALLY PRETTY.

374
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:55,583
- UH, WHAT MADE YOU BRING
THAT UP ALL OF A SUDDEN? 

375
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:56,916
- NOTHING,
BUT IT'S TRUE.

376
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,583
- ( chuckles )
THANKS, KAORU.

377
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,916
YOU KNOW, NOW THAT
I THINK ABOUT IT, 

378
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,875
I GUESS THAT MAKES YOU
THE FIRST PERSON

379
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,041
WHO'S EVER SEEN ME
AS A BRIDE, GOWN AND ALL.

380
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,583
- YEAH?

381
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,250
I GUESS IT DOES,
DOESN'T IT?

382
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,583
BUT IT SORT OF 
MAKES ME WONDER

383
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,125
WHAT KIND OF MAN
YOUR GROOM WILL BE.

384
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,791
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED?

385
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,375
- UH-HUH.
I HAVE.

386
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,458
I'VE ALWAYS PICTURED
THAT MY GROOM WOULD BE

387
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,583
A LONELY KIND OF GUY.

388
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,333
THAT WOULD BE
A SIDE OF HIM

389
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,666
THAT HE WOULDN'T
SHOW THAT MUCH. 

390
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,791
AND ALSO,

391
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,375
HE'D BE REALLY REALLY GENTLE.

392
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,250
NO MATTER HOW MANY 
STUPID THINGS I DO,

393
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,625
HE'D JUST LAUGH
AND SAY I'M HOPELESS.

394
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:41,750
NOW IF ONLY I COULD
FIND A GUY LIKE THAT.

395
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,541
- WOW. YOU THOUGHT OF
ALL THE LITTLE DETAILS, HUH?

396
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,083
AND OF COURSE, YOU'LL LIVE
IN A LOG CABIN, RIGHT?

397
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,458
WITH A BIG LAKE
IN THE BACK?

398
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,250
- OF COURSE!
I'LL BE SURROUNDED

399
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,708
BY KIDS AND ANIMALS.
LOTS AND LOTS OF BOTH.

400
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,250
- THAT'S PRETTY EASY
TO IMAGINE WITH YOU, TINA.

401
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,125
- ( chuckles )
GUESS IT GOES TO SHOW YOU

402
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,833
THAT YOU KNOW ME
PRETTY WELL, KAORU.

403
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,750
- I SUPPOSE. THOUGH I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU LIKE ANIMALS SO MUCH.

404
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,250
- HMM.

405
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,083
WELL, IT'S BECAUSE 
ANIMALS CAN'T TALK,

406
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,500
SO PEOPLE HAVE TO TRY TO
UNDERSTAND HOW THEY FEEL.

407
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,583
OF COURSE
THERE ARE PROBLEMS,

408
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,250
'CAUSE PEOPLE CAN TALK.

409
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,416
BUT PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS
SAY THEIR TRUE FEELINGS

410
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,791
ALL THE TIME.

411
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,625
I'D LIKE TO GO SEE ALL
THE ANIMALS I MET ON MY TRIP

412
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:19,666
ONE MORE TIME.

413
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,166
- HUH?
- WHAT?

414
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,250
WOULD YOU BE LONELY IF I WASN'T
AROUND YOU ANYMORE, KAORU?

415
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,583
OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T BE.
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

416
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,083
- I WAS LONELY.
- ( gasps )

417
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,333
- Kaoru: YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO GOT ME INTO THE PHOTO CLUB

418
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,125
MY FRESHMAN YEAR.

419
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,416
WE ALL DID SOME
PRETTY STUPID THINGS BACK THEN.

420
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,916
IT MADE COLLEGE FEEL LIKE
A FUN PLACE TO BE.

421
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,750
BUT THEN, YOU DISAPPEARED
OUT OF THE BLUE.

422
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,250
AND GOING TO COLLEGE
DIDN'T SEEM AS FUN ANYMORE

423
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,291
WITHOUT YOU AROUND.

424
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,291
I CAN LAUGH NOW
WHEN WE GO TO COLLEGE,

425
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:52,166
AND THAT'S ALL 
BECAUSE OF YOU.

426
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,458
SO PROMISE ME THAT YOU'LL
NEVER DISAPPEAR AGAIN

427
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,500
LIKE YOU DID FOR
THAT ONE YEAR, OKAY?

428
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,458
- MAN.  HOW CAN YOU KEEP SAYING
ALL THAT EMBARRASSING STUFF?

429
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,083
YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT DRUNK?

430
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,833
- ( chuckles )
MAYBE I AM.

431
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,000
- JEEZ, I'M STARTING
TO FEEL COLD AGAIN. 

432
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,041
I'M GONNA GO TAKE
ANOTHER SHOWER.

433
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:25,458
MOM AND DAD WOULD PROBABLY
NEVER FORGIVE ME FOR DOING THIS,

434
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,916
BUT IT'S OKAY...

435
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,583
IF IT'S WITH KAORU.

436
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:33,541
- HUH?

437
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,958
- YOU SHOULD TAKE
A SHOWER, KAORU. 

438
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,000
- YEAH.

439
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,541
( yelps )

440
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,500
- ( gasps )

441
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,958
( gasps )

442
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,750
- ( stammers )

443
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:51,958
( gasps )

444
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,500
- I'D BETTER GO
TAKE MY SHOWER NOW.

445
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:09,625
TINA SEEMS REALLY DIFFERENT
TODAY FOR SOME REASON.

446
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,916
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

447
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,958
WHAT'S THE RIGHT
THING TO DO?

448
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,291
( grunts )

449
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,291
WHAT THE HECK
WAS I THINKING?

450
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:29,000
TINA'S A FRIEND.
SHE'S JUST A FRIEND.

451
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,458
TINA?

452
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,875
YOU KNOW, TINA,

453
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,250
I DON'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA

454
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,125
TO DO ANYTHING THAT
JEOPARDIZES OUR RELATIONSHIP.

455
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,916
I CONSIDER YOU
A GOOD FRIEND,

456
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,250
AND I CAN'T THINK
OF YOU AS ANYTHING MORE.

457
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,250
AND ALSO,
TO TELL THE TRUTH--

458
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,416
- ( moans )
- HUH?

459
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,375
- ( sighs, snoring )

460
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,791
- ( stammers )

461
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,958
- ( chuckles )

462
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,458
JEEZ.

463
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,083
THIS IS JUST
LIKE YOU, TINA.

464
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,291
- GUESS I SORT OF FELL ASLEEP
LAST NIGHT, DIDN'T I?

465
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:30,250
- HUH?  YEAH, YOU DID.

466
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,916
- IT WAS KIND OF
A STRANGE NIGHT, HUH?

467
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,833
- IT SURE WAS.

468
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:38,500
- SAY, KAORU...
- HUH?

469
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,583
- DO YOU THINK
IT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT

470
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,083
IF I COULD
HOLD YOUR HAND?

471
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,291
- WHAT?

472
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,166
YEAH, I DON'T REALLY MIND.
SURE.

473
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,833
- ( laughs )
