1
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,666
[HERMES] Shouldn't you be
chopping wood right now?

2
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:14,833
[KINO]
Shh!

3
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,083
Better luck next time.

4
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,416
[gunshot]

5
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,041
[HERMES]
Something the matter?

6
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:59,583
[HERMES] You look like you're
about to eat a bag of sand.

7
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:00,875
Oh, no.

8
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:03,083
I mean the sausage
is definitely a little cold,

9
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:06,000
but that doesn't hurt
the flavor too much.

10
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,041
I was just...

11
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,291
[HERMES]
Just what?

12
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,916
[KINO] Thinkin' about
our time with Master.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,875
[HERMES] Hmm...
That's unusual. Which time?

14
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:17,541
[KINO] One of the times she got
the jump on me during training.

15
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:19,625
[HERMES]
Why that?

16
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:21,666
[KINO]
Good question.

17
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,375
Oh. Right, it's 'cause
of the sausage.

18
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:26,416
After that, we ate
some exactly like this

19
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,458
and she told me a travel story.

20
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:30,750
[HERMES] Like from back
when she was young?

21
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:32,500
[KINO]
Yeah.

22
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:34,375
I think I remember it
being about a country

23
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:36,625
with a tall clock tower.

24
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:39,000
It actually might be
pretty close by.

25
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,375
[PARTNER]
Master?

26
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,708
[MASTER]
What is it?

27
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,000
Well, we'll reach
the next country pretty soon.

28
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,750
Once we do, I think we should
sell the rest of the gems there.

29
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,458
[MASTER]
Hmm.

30
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,875
Look, we're running
dangerously low

31
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:28,416
on food and fuel.
So we're gonna need some cash.

32
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,458
That, or something
we can trade more easily.

33
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,916
You know, like liquor.

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah, you're right. That said...

35
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,916
Make sure to sell high, right?

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,333
Don't worry. I'm aware.

37
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,208
[PARTNER]
Hey, this country seems nice.

38
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,333
Looks like their technology's
fairly advanced, too.

39
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:56,250
In a place like this?
Gems are worth a fortune.

40
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,958
[MASTER] I see an awful
lot of police officers.

41
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,125
[PARTNER]
Yeah, same.

42
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,541
This could be
one of those countries

43
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,458
with a military police force
that doubles as an army.

44
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,250
What I've seen
of these countries,

45
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,916
it's important not to
let your guard down.

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,833
Bad public order?

47
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,833
Actually, the crime rate
is quite low here.

48
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:17,958
I'd bet.

49
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,291
As long as you
don't count the crimes

50
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:22,208
of the people in power, that is.

51
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,875
Roger that.

52
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,500
Why don't you take it
easy at the hotel,

53
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:29,208
n' let me handle this?
I'll be back by lunchtime.

54
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,375
[MASTER sighs]

55
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,208
[POLICEMAN C]
So there you have it.

56
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,875
Your lover was found in
possession of illegal drugs

57
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,250
and promptly arrested.

58
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,708
[MASTER]
I understand.

59
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,500
Though, I should make
one small correction.

60
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:03,166
The man is not my lover.
We simply met on the road.

61
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,000
Forgive me for assuming.

62
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,583
[MASTER]
Where is he right now?

63
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,250
He's in an underground
detention cell, sweetheart.

64
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,666
You have an underground
level, too?

65
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,625
This police force seems
very well-funded.

66
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,583
[POLICEMAN C] Oh, yeah, this
building used to be the palace,

67
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,708
back when our
country had a king.

68
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,958
There's so much history here
that we decided to preserve

69
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:26,416
the clock tower,
as a cultural monument.

70
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,875
It's currently
a shared headquarters

71
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:31,375
for multiple branches
of government.

72
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:35,250
But, everyone knows that
we're the ones in charge here.

73
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,958
So this is really
just the police HQ.

74
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,875
[laughs]

75
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,666
That's good to know.

76
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,083
Things are just
as I expected, then.

77
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,541
[POLICEMAN C]
Come again?

78
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,708
I do understand the situation,

79
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:52,000
but as you can clearly see,
I'm a traveler.

80
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,625
I wonder if you'd
be willing to show mercy,

81
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:58,625
and use your authority to issue
exile as his punishment.

82
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:02,250
[POLICEMAN C]
Hmm... 'N what'll you give me?

83
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,000
I can go this high.

84
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:11,500
No. That pittance is
out of the question.

85
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,666
You should get out of this
country while ya can, though.

86
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,916
I'll do you a favor and keep
quiet about your attempt

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,708
to bribe a police officer.

88
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,625
In that case,
I will gladly do just that.

89
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,250
This man is little more
than a stranger to me,

90
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,708
so it's not like I
owe him any loyalty.

91
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,958
If he committed a crime
and got arrested,

92
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,708
there's nothing I can do.

93
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,208
I'll leave him behind.

94
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,333
[POLICEMAN C]
Wise decision.

95
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:39,166
I don't suppose you'd permit me
to give him a final farewell?

96
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,333
[POLICEMAN C]
'Fraid not.

97
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:43,625
Possession of drugs
is a serious crime.

98
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,000
Please, sir.

99
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,750
I would appreciate any
assistance you could offer.

100
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,583
[POLICEMAN C]
Ah-- Hmm...

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Sis, you came!

102
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,500
I knew that you would rescue me!

103
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,708
How many times have I told you
not to do something illegal?

104
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,291
[PARTNER] Wait, what?
I was falsely accused!

105
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,416
Perhaps you can prove that
when you face your trial here.

106
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
I'm overdue in another
country right now,

107
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,916
so... I can't really
wait for you.

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,083
[PARTNER]
Oh, come on!

109
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,333
I've never so much
as touched an illegal drug,

110
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,625
let alone tried to bring
'em into another country.

111
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,750
[POLICEMAN D laughs]
Tough break, punk.

112
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:25,000
Maybe this'll teach ya to keep
a closer eye on your pockets.

113
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:28,291
After all, you never know
what might slip into 'em.

114
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,791
[laughs]

115
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,250
One last thing.

116
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,500
You know that super-secret
case I have that I've never

117
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,250
revealed the contents of?
It's yours now.

118
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,833
Use it to fund
your travels, okay?

119
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,708
And don't let it
go for cheap, either!

120
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:46,666
When I bought the thing, it cost
me 434 silver coins, no less!

121
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,291
[MASTER] Hmph. I'll do as
you say. Thanks for the gift.

122
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,291
[PARTNER]
Hmph.

123
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,208
[POLICEMAN C]
Visit's over.

124
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,250
[MASTER]
Right.

125
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,125
[PARTNER sobs]

126
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,625
[POLICEMAN E]
These are the man's belongings.

127
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,208
What about the gems he had?

128
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,708
Or the money he was going
to exchange them for?

129
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,208
Ah.

130
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,541
Well, we assumed it was the
capital he used to purchase

131
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,750
those illegal substances,
so we went ahead

132
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:16,500
and confiscated
all that as evidence.

133
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,166
Of course you did.

134
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,375
[MASTER]
A silencer. Plastic knife.

135
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:54,625
Thin wire cord.

136
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,750
And poison capsules?

137
00:08:56,833 --> 00:09:01,375
Just about every tool
an assassin might need.

138
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:05,166
Good grief. What was this
kid doing before I found him?

139
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:11,833
[tower bell rings]

140
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,916
About that woman
you had us tail.

141
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,500
I'm told that she left
the country peacefully.

142
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,916
That so?

143
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,375
See to it that she
never gets in again.

144
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,833
That woman was trouble,
I could tell.

145
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,250
Right.

146
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,000
By the way, sir, our director
is currently dining with

147
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:29,416
a few statesmen,
but... he gave me a message.

148
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,625
He says you did an excellent
job, and your cut's been sent.

149
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:36,166
[POLICEMAN C] Good. You all
did a fine job as well.

150
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,708
Thank you, very much, sir.

151
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,791
What should we do
with that man now?

152
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,791
[POLICEMAN C] We could just
exile him and be done with it,

153
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,583
but if we put him to trial,
the state could get 20 years

154
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,666
of hard labor out of him.

155
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,750
It's a tough call,

156
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,875
so I might have to
roll some dice.

157
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,000
[MASTER]
All right.

158
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,333
Ahh, not bad.

159
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:12,541
Night vision.
Now this is a handy toy.

160
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:18,208
[yawns] Maybe I'll have
time for a quick nap.

161
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:36,916
[MASTER]
Now then.

162
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,000
--[MAN A] What?

163
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,041

Ah, this is nice...

164
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,375
--[MAN A] So warm!
--[bang]

165
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,125
[MAN A]
Huh...?

166
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:11,458
[police sirens blaring]

167
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,125
Stay in your homes!

[yawns]

169
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,083
[POLICEMAN H]
Run! You see those fires?!

170
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,166
Someone planted bombs
around the building!

171
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,666
It's gonna collapse,
let's get out of here!

172
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,875
[POLICEMAN I]
Should we release the prisoner?!

173
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,500
[POLICEMAN H]
Hell no! Forget about him!

174
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,333
--You wanna die in here?
--Like I said,

175
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,875
I knew you'd save me.

176
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,375
Thanks, Master.

177
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,500
Yeah. You know you're
a crap apprentice, right?

178
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,000
Guess that's fair.

179
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:43,875
Sorry I let my guard down.
Say, what'd ya think of my toys?

180
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,208
Were they helpful?

181
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,208
[MASTER]
Yeah, to some extent.

182
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,041
Once you finish changing,
we're getting out of here.

183
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,000
What's the plan after?

184
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,083
[MASTER]
Whole country's on alert,

185
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,791
so we can't escape it yet.

186
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:58,208
[PARTNER]
I hear ya. So what can we do?

187
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,500
What would we do
if it were up to you?

188
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,291
If it were up to me?

189
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,958
I'd probably look for
somewhere obscure to hide.

190
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,041
You know, like a random attic
or a sewer pipe

191
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,375
we could hole up in.

192
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:09,916
Then, after three days or so,

193
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
once they've worn
themselves out lookin' for us,

194
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,541
we could either try
and sneak out of here,

195
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,583
or launch a quick,
surprise offensive.

196
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,583
And hopefully shoot our way out.

197
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,500
You're on the
right track at least,

198
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,041
but not quite there.

199
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,625
Oh, yeah?

200
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,291
[MASTER] Three days is about the
right length of time to wait.

201
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,500
But instead of hiding...

202
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,083
We'll what?

203
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,750
[MASTER]
We'll make a scene.

204
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,500
Every now and then
it's important to test

205
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,333
your abilities to the fullest.

206
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,500
We wouldn't want to get rusty.

207
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:40,375
I bet the view from the top
of this tower is lovely.

208
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,666
Yeah.

209
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:46,416
[HERMES] Whoa. So what
happened after that?

210
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,416
Well, as she predicted,
the police armory

211
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,250
was in that same building.

212
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,291
Thanks to the
commotion that she caused,

213
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,291
all the police who would've
guarded it were gone.

214
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,250
So, the two of them
leisurely loaded up a cart

215
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,041
with weapons and ammunition.

216
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,750
[HERMES]
That is terrifying!

217
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,875
Talk about adding
fools to the fire!

218
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:06,958
[KINO]
You know what?

219
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,333
That kinda works.

220
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,500
[HERMES]
So, uh...

221
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,708
You gonna finish
the story, or what?

222
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,125
[KINO]
Yeah.

223
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,333
Then they found
a provisions storeroom,

224
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:20,583
and loaded the cart with as much
food and water as they could.

225
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,458
[HERMES]
And then? And then?

226
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,833
[KINO] They took it up
to the highest floor.

227
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,083
[HERMES]
The highest floor?

228
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,500
But they'd be trapped, right?

229
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,625
[KINO]
Escaping wasn't quite the goal.

230
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,583
Instead, Master and her
apprentice climbed

231
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,291
to the clock tower roof.

232
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,333
The highest point
in the country,

233
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,666
and prepared to
make their stand.

234
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,791
They used explosives
to cut the cable on

235
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,833
the only elevator, which
made it to drop to the basement.

236
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,583
[HERMES micmics explosion]

237
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,125
So later,

238
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,583
when the police finally finished
restoring order to the city

239
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,500
and tried to go
back to their HQ.

240
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,750
[HERMES]
Ka-bang?

241
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:52,916
[KINO]
Yup.

242
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
[HERMES]
So they killed them one by one?

243
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:58,458
[KINO] No. That's what
was amazing about Master.

244
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,125
She didn't kill any of 'em.

245
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,125
[HERMES]
No? What do you mean?

246
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,208
[KINO]
She was an incredible marksman.

247
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,875
So, she aimed to
incapacitate without killing.

248
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,416
Shot their knees
and shins, mostly.

249
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,750
[HERMES]
Ah!

250
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,083
So when more police came
to help the wounded ones,

251
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:16,541
she could shoot them, too.
Classic sniper tactic.

252
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,666
--Nope, she let them be.
--[HERMES] Huh?

253
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,041
When people came to
help the wounded,

254
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,708
she just let them go.

255
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,750
She also didn't shoot
anyone who ran away.

256
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,416
[HERMES]
Why not? What for?

257
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,833
[KINO] I asked her
the exact same question,

258
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,375
and she tried to have
me answer it myself,

259
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,291
but I couldn't figure it
out till she got further

260
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:33,500
into the story.

261
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:34,708
[HERMES]
I give up, too, then.

262
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,375
For now, at least.

263
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,333
Go ahead.

264
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,291
She knew full well
that the two of them

265
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,958
wouldn't stand a chance
of breaking through

266
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,750
that gate on their own.

267
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,708
So instead of trying to escape,

268
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:48,041
she sat tight where she was
and waited for the country

269
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,958
to open the gate 'n
bring her a car.

270
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,208
Which they later did.

271
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,541
[HERMES]
Oh, I get it now.

272
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,291
[KINO] By holing up
in that clock tower,

273
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,416
they made it impossible for
half of the government

274
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,125
to get to their jobs.

275
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,750
And that put a lot of
pressure on the police

276
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,291
to do something about it.

277
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,333
But--

278
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,833
[HERMES]
They'd be shot.

279
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,958
[KINO] Yup. I don't think
she aimed for the legs

280
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,041
out of any compassion, either.

281
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,750
It was devious.

282
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,041
Since none of the police
were actually killed,

283
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,916
they didn't feel the need to
avenge their fellow officers.

284
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,541
[HERMES]
That does make sense.

285
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,125
Oh, and the apprentice
they imprisoned

286
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:22,041
on false charges?
He got really into it.

287
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:25,333
Every single officer he shot
went straight to the hospital.

288
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:26,916
[HERMES]
Ah...

289
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,750
Then they wrote
the police a letter.

290
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,333
Put it in a nice envelope
and dropped it down.

291
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:35,208
They used all of the police's
own equipment, of course.

292
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,250
[MASTER]
"To whom it may concern.

as our grave. We shall
defend this position to the end.

302
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,833
We'll fight till
our bows are broken,

303

316
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,458
has promised to launch an
assault on the tower

317
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:25,666
this evening.

318
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,958
I guess we can
take it easy till nightfall.

319
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,916
[HERMES]
Kinda dumb he told the news.

320
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,083
Yeah. Master said
the same thing to me.

321
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,166
The broadcasts were
a big help, apparently.

322
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,208
They always knew what
the police had planned.

323
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:41,500
[HERMES] So, how many days
did they hole up there?

324
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,416
Three days and three nights.

325
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,291
[POLICEMAN C clears throat]
Can you idiots hear me?

326
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:51,708
We have the tower surrounded.
There's nowhere to run.

327
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,041
You'll die up there
as you wished.

328
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,333
Or, if you don't die
up there, we're gonna

329
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:59,000
hang you after dragging
you through the streets.

330

[PARTNER]
Hmph.

331
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,208

So preparse yourselv--

[POLICEMAN C]
Bandits!

334
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,250
Your position up
there is untenable.

335
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,541
But if you come down
quietly, and surrender.

336
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,833
We are now willing
to spare your lives!

Heh.

[POLICEMEN whimpering]

339
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:27,958
[POLICEMAN C] Do you people have
anything you'd like to say?

340
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,875
If so, we'll graciously
hear you out.

[POLICEMAN C] Good morning,
esteemed travelers.

343
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,000
I come bearing a message.

344
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,916
If you two wish to leave
this country, we will gladly

345
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,791
permit you to do so,
and have thus,

346
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,541
for your convenience,
provided you with this truck.

347

[POLICEMEN scream]

348
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,875
Huh?

349
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,791
[POLICEMAN C]
From the bottom of our hearts.

350
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:08,000
We earnestly request that you
stop holding our tower hostage

351
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,166
and leave this country.

352

--[rapid gunfire]

Make it stop... Please...

We give up...

355
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,916
If you feel that
strongly about it.

356
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,208
I suppose you could persuade us
to leave your country

357
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,250
instead of dying in this tower.

358
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,750
[gasps]
D'you really mean it?

359
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:35,625
[MASTER]
Depends. What'll you give me?

360
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:36,708
Uh...

361
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,958
I said, "What will you give me?"

362
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,208
[POLICEMAN C]
Ah...

363
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,541
[POLICEMAN C]
Let's see...

364
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,916
How about the
amount I've written here?

365
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,583
[POLICEMAN C]
We can go higher!

366
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:51,750
So yeah.

367
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,791
Apparently, that's
how it all ended.

368
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,333
[HERMES]
She's a demon.

369
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,458
[KINO] And thus, Master extorted
cash from their government,

370
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,750
and they departed
the country safely.

371
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,375
[HERMES] And they
lived happily ever after.

372
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,083
I enjoyed that story.

373
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,666
[gasps]

374
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,125
[HERMES]
Look, there it is.

375
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,583
[KINO]
Perfect timing.

376
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:13,791
[tower bell chimes]

377
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:14,791
[HERMES]
It's octagonal.

378
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,125
This must be the spot.

379
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,875
[KINO]
And there's the old clock tower.

380
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,416
[BOY A]
Mama, look!

381
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,041
[laughter]

382
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,791
[HERMES]
Kino. Over here.

383
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,166
[KINO]
Hmm?

384
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,333
[HERMES]
There's a plaque.

385
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,375
[HERMES]
What does it say?

386
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:44,541
Uh, something about
the government being corrupted.

387
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,916
[OLD MAN A]
I can fill you in.

388
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,166
[KINO]
Hmm?

389
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,375
That plaque was erected
in honor of a pair of

390
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,458
brave heroes who
saved our country

391
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,791
and gave the people liberty.

392
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,625
[HERMES]
Brave heroes, huh?

393
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,041
I'm a traveler,
but I'm curious about

394
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,958
your country's history.

395
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,666
Would you mind
telling me more about it?

396
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,166
Sure, I'd be happy to.

397
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,208
A couple decades ago,
when I was still a young man,

398
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,541
the government of this country
was rife with corruption.

399
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,791
[HERMES]
Oh? Go on, please.

400
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,833
[OLD MAN A] Our standing
police force was guilty of

401
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,958
the lion's share of wrongdoing.

402
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,625
And no one had the courage to
stand up to them on behalf

403
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,500
of the people's
right to liberty.

404
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,708
Not till those travelers came.

405
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,000
[HERMES]
What did they do?

406
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,083
[OLD MAN A]
They rallied the will

407
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,583
of all of us citizens
behind them.

408
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,583
And then they petitioned
the government to reform.

409
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,458
Did it in this very building.

410
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:36,916
[HERMES]
Incredible.

411
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,291
[OLD MAN A]
After that,

412
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,875
our politicians and policeman,
deeply moved by

413
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,666
the passion of
those brave souls...

414
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,208
Why, they grew ashamed
of their wicked deeds.

415
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:49,333
And they vowed to do better
from that moment forward.

416
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,625
[OLD MAN A]
Thanks to those travelers,

417
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:54,083
our country is now both
pleasant and prosperous.

418
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,708
We're living happily ever after.

419
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,625
[GIRL A] Hey, Grandpa,
why do your stories always end

420
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,958
with "happily ever after"?

421
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,250
I see.

422
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,375
So that's what this
plaque commemorates?

423
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,416
Yes, that's correct.

424
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,708
The event is now recorded in
our country's history textbooks

425
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:12,833
as the "tale of the two
travelers of justice."

426
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,666
I'm sorry to change the subject,

427
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,208
but what happened
to your left leg?

428
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,916
I noticed that a lot
of the elderly in this country,

429
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,375
the men in particular,
seem to be using canes.

430
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,458
Well, men can be
rather reckless,

431
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,916
and accidents happen.

432
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,250
[GIRL gasps]

433
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:37,958
[HERMES]
So what do you think?

434
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,208
Did he lie to us?

435
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:42,125
You already know that, right?
It's obvious.

436
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,541
[HERMES] Heh. But what
an optimistic country.

437
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,333
It's good to think positively.

438
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,875
Sure, within reason.

439
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,125
[HERMES] But what do
you think would happen

440
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,916
if Master visited again?

441
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,833
--Huh?!

Don't worry. She's not here now.

443
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,916

Right. 'Course not.

444

So, face forward and drive.

445

Yeah. Will do.
