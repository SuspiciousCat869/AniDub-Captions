1
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:15,333
[KINO] This might
not make sense, but...

2
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:18,375
[HERMES]
Don't worry about it. Go ahead.

3
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:23,041
[KINO] Sometimes I...
wonder if I'm a hopeless fool.

4
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:28,625
Underhanded, petty...
All the things I don't wanna be.

5
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:33,916
I'm not sure why, but...
Sometimes, that's how I see it.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,083
Sometimes, that's the
only way I see it.

7
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,041
But in times like those,

8
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:42,125
I just have to look
around at the world.

9
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,083
The life flourishing around me.

10
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:50,125
Just by seeing these wonders,
I become wholly beautiful.

11
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:53,541
These things are precious to me.

12
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:57,750
I want to learn about them,
as much as I can.

13
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:00,375
That's probably why
I keep traveling.

14
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,958
[KINO]
I know this life won't be easy.

15
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:08,416
There's sadness and pain
on the road ahead.

16
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,208
But I don't think that
means I should quit.

17
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:13,291
[HERMES]
Hmm?

18
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:17,000
[KINO]
I like traveling. It's fun.

19
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:19,500
Even if people try to kill me.

20
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:22,750
Even if I have to
kill them to stay alive.

21
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,333
That doesn't change
my mind about this.

22
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:27,625
Besides...

23
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:29,375
[HERMES]
Besides?

24
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:32,083
[KINO]
I can stop anytime I want.

25
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:35,708
So, I might as well keep going.

26
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,375
That make sense?

27
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:39,833
[HERMES]
Frankly? Not so much.

28
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,916
[KINO]
It doesn't have to.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,708
[HERMES]
No?

30
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,458
[KINO]
To be honest...

31
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:48,750
...maybe I just think
I know why I do this.

32
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:51,875
Maybe I'm just another lost kid.

33
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:56,000
Maybe I'm travelling,
so I can figure all that out.

34
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,250
[HERMES]
Hmm...

35
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:02,166
[KINO]
Well... I'm going to sleep now.

36
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,541
We've got a long way
to go tomorrow.

37
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,583
[yawns]

38
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,208
Goodnight, Hermes...

39
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,791
[HERMES]
Goodnight, Kino.

40
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,625
[HERMES] So, are we
in the next country yet?

41
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,791
Don't worry,
we're almost there now.

42
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,375
[HERMES] The last time you said
that, we were two days out.

43
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,875
[KINO] That's what "almost
there" meant in that country.

44
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,000
[HERMES]
Uh-huh.

45
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,000
Oh?

46
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,333
[HERMES]
Hey, it's a horse.

47
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,166
[KINO]
Looks like someone's there.

48
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,625
Let's stop. Say hi.

49
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:01,708
[MAN A]
Hmm?

50
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,000
Hey there.

51
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,125
--Good afternoon.
--[HERMES] Hello.

52
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,291
Are you two from
the country up ahead?

53
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,750
No, but I'm on my way
there right now.

54
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:23,208
Hey, so am I!
Isn't that a nice coincidence?

55
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,708
Say... how 'bout you
carry half my stuff?

56
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,666
--'Fraid I can't do that.
--[HERMES] Same.

57
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,458
Aw, man, and here
I thought you were friendly.

58
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,041
[KINO] I could've said yes
and then made off with it.

59
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,583
[MAN A]
Hmph.

60
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,375
I'd get there first, with plenty
of time to sell it all, too.

61
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:40,041
Pfft. I guess.

62
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,375
But, hey, forget that.

63
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,375
What've you heard
about this country?

64
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:46,208
I don't know too much about it,
but someone told me

65
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,833
that people are
very polite there.

66
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,833
[laughs]

67
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,625
What kind of idiot
told you that?!

68
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,291
They couldn'ta been
further off the mark.

69
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,833
Hmph.
I'll tell ya what I know.

70
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:01,291
In that country,
you can kill people.

71
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,375
[HERMES]
Wait. What do you mean?

72
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:06,750
They don't have any laws against
murder--it's legal there.

73
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,208
Though, for some reason,
it's still a crime to steal.

74
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,958
So is that the reason why
you're wanting to go there?

75
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:15,541
[MAN A]
Yeah! I'm startin' a life there.

76
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,333
In the country
where I was born,

77
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,541
law and order
were stupidly high,

78
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,166
and everyone got
along out of fear.

79
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,083
Couldn't even try
startin' a damn fight

80
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,875
without getting locked up.

81
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,375
That's why I up and left.

82
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,791
[HERMES] So, what about
once you've moved?

83
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,416
[MAN A]
Hmm? Who knows?

84
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,333
Maybe I'll try and
find work there.

85
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,166
Ooh!

86
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,208
Or maybe I'll find someone
I don't like 'n kill 'em.

87
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:46,291
I can be myself in this place--
that's what matters.

88
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,500
[HERMES]
Oh.

89
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,875
[MAN A sighs]
Anyway.

90
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,125
That's not all I heard
about this place.

91
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,791
They say Regel
himself lives there.

92
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,625
--Who's that?
--[HERMES] Don't know him.

93
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,750
You guys must be from
deep in the sticks.

94
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:04,875
Regel is a mass murderer.
'N he's just about world famous.

95
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,083
He headed up a cell of
bandits in the big country

96
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:10,583
south of here. Some folks
called him a terrorist.

97
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,541
Regel got caught once.

98
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,416
But naturally,
he broke out of his cell

99
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,250
before they could hang him.

100
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,833
That went down
a few decades ago.

101
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,666
And nobody's
heard about him since.

102
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,083
Which tells me that he must've
made off to this country.

103
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:28,208
I bet he's been living out
his days killing freely there.

104
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,958
Surely, he's carved out
his own little empire.

105
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,833
A guy like me
could learn from him.

106
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,541
Thanks for sharing.
We'll be heading out now.

107
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:36,833
[MAN A]
What?! C'mon!

108
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:40,166
Aw, fine. You're no fun
at all, ya know that?

109
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,416
[engine revvs]

110
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,416
Hey. You really won't
help me carry anything?

111
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,250
Nah, it is your stuff after all.
I'm sure you can manage it.

112
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,166
[MAN A]
Hmph.

113
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,625
[gasps]

114
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,458
[HERMES]
Think that's it?

115
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,833
[KINO]
Hmm. Probably.

116
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:19,250
[HERMES] Might be
dangerous if he was right.

117
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,625
Possibly.

118
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,083
[HERMES]
Got Cannon ready?

119
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,583
[KINO]
Of course.

120
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,291
[HERMES]
And the Woodsman?

121
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,708
[KINO]
Always.

122
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,833
[HERMES]
In a good headspace?

123
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,333
For now, at least, yeah.

124
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,500
Well, let's go.

125
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:42,458
[INSPECTOR A]
Just a three day stay, is it?

126
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,625
And that motorrad you're on,
you're bringing it, too?

127
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,083
Yes, if that's all right.

128
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,416
I should tell you--

129
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,083
Murder isn't prohibited
by law in this country.

130
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:55,750
Killing is legal. Be you
a citizen, or just a visitor.

131
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,791
Everyone within our borders is
free to kill anyone they please

132
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,208
regardless of
circumstance or motive.

133
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,750
Do you understand that?

134
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:03,875
[KINO]
Yes.

135
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,458
[INSPECTOR A]
And despite that,

136
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,666
you genuinely still
wish to enter?

137
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,333
[INSPECTOR A]
Very well. Go ahead.

138
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:43,083
[TOWNSFOLK chatting]

139
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,125
[HERMES]
Hmm...

140
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,291
[KINO]
What a strange country.

141
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:05,083
[HERMES]
Hmm? Seems pretty normal to me.

142
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:08,166
[KINO]
Yeah. It does seem normal.

143
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,416
The streets are clean and
full of friendly people.

144
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,333
I hardly see any police.

145
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,583
The stores don't have
especially heavy shutters.

146
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:20,666
They're even nice to travelers
here, and the food's good, too.

147
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,791
[HERMES]
So what?

148
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:27,000
[KINO] By all appearances,
this is an orderly society.

149
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,000
Doesn't that seem odd?

150
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,541
[HERMES]
Oh, I get it.

151
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,875
You were hoping to see gangs
of ruffians strutting around.

152
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,875
Guys knifing each other over
women in the bars maybe.

153
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:39,416
Or like a mean stray dog with
a human hand in its mouth.

154
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,125
Yeah, that would've been great.

155
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,250
Too bad.

156
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,541

that's for sure.

313
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:59,041
Just an average citizen.

314
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:02,916
A nice old man who goes
by the name of Regel.

315
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,041
[gasps]

316
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:09,000
Sorry to do this, but you see...

317
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,416
...you're dangerous.

318
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,208
[MAN A]
Wait... Regel?

319
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:17,083
[grunts, rasps]

320
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:34,875
[MAN D] It's never easy...
killing another.

321
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,541
Safe travels to you.

322
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,333
Thanks. Uh...

323
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,333
[gasps]

324
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,541
[HERMES]
Hey, it's a horse.

325
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:59,875
Yeah. Looks like
someone's there.

326
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,958
Let's stop. Say hi.

327
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,666
Hey.

328
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:16,708
Afternoon.

329
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:17,958
[HERMES]
Hello.

330
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,625
Tell me. Are you from
the country up ahead?

331
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:23,125
Nah. I'm travelling right now.

332
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,666
Although, my friend
and I did spend

333
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,083
the last few days
visiting there.

334
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,708
I see.

335
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,250
Could I... ask you something?

336
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,458
What is it?

337
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,875
Thing is... I rode a
very long way to try to

338
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:37,208
get to that country,
because I heard it was safe.

339
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,666
Do you know? Is it true?

340
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,875
Yeah, no doubt about that.

341
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,083
[MAN E sighs]

342
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,208
Though to what extent,
might depend on

343
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,666
your perception of things.

344
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,916
My home country...
It was not a good place.

345
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,083
I had to fight
just to stay alive,

346
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,916
and I killed a lot
of people there.

347
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,833
Decent men that just wanted
to live normal lives.

348
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:04,541
I never want to kill again.
I want to live somewhere safe.

349
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,208
In that case...
you'll like it there.

350
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:10,500
Even if it seems a bit wrong
at first, stick it out.

351
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,958
Really? Thank you.

352
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,041
[KINO]
Well... We'll be on our way.

353
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,416
Oh. I wanted to know
one last thing.

354
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,791
Uh... Well... Forget it.

355
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,291
That's a weird thing
to ask about.

356
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,750
I'm heading there now--
I'll find out soon.

357
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:27,791
Farewell, then.

358
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:28,958
[MAN E]
Yeah.

359
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,083
I wonder if it's true
what they say...

360
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,416
...that in that country,

361
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,416
they serve mountains
of crepes for dessert.

362
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,708
[HERMES]
Hey, Kino.

363
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,166
What's up?

364
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,375
[HERMES] I've been meaning
to ask this for a while now.

365
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,041
Why only spend three days
in each country?

366
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,000
There was a traveler
I met a long time ago.

367
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,041
[KINO] ...who said that was
about the perfect length.

368
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,166
[HERMES]
Huh. Good to know.

369
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,750
[HERMES]
Kino. You asleep yet?

370
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,291
[KINO]
Yes. Wide asleep.

371
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,625
[HERMES] Motorrads are
happiest when they're running.

372
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:48,458
And going on a journey
means running every day.

373
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,750
Therefore, we love to travel.

374
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:54,000
[KINO]
Okay? Where is this coming from?

375
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:57,791
[HERMES] Sheesh. Don't you
know what a soliloquy is?

376
00:22:57,875 --> 00:22:59,458
[KINO]
You mean a syllogism.

377
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:01,500
--[HERMES] That's what I said.
--[KINO] What about it?

378
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,791
[HERMES] Well. Mostly,
I just like similes,

379
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:07,916
but then I got to wondering why
you decide to keep travelling.

380
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,541
I mean, I know you don't
have a place to call home,

381
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:14,041
but you've been in so many
rough situations on the road.

382
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,708
Nearly been killed even.

383
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:19,041
Don't you ever think about
finding a place to settle down?

384
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:21,125
As good of a shot as you are,

385
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:23,708
I bet you could find
a job anywhere.

386
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:26,916
Or you could've made a living
back at master's place.

387
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,375
[KINO]
You're right.

388
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:31,208
A reasonable person
would've stopped by now.

389
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:34,625
[HERMES] Yeah? And why
are you so unreasonable?

390
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:36,875
[KINO sighs]
Well...

391
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:42,083
[KINO] This might not
make sense, but...

392
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:46,833
[KINO]
"Colosseum."
