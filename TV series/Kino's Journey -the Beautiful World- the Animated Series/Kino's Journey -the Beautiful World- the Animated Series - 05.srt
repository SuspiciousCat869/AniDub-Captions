1
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:41,125
Here's our first
president's memorial hall!

2
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:42,791
[KINO]
It's... nice.

3
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,208
[HERMES]
Hmm...

4
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:45,875
[FEMALE GUIDE] I know that
it may seem a bit modest.

5
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:48,166
He's so loved that it
could've been a palace.

6
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,708
But throughout his life,

7
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:52,500
he despised decadent grandeur,
and we wished to honor that.

8
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:55,041
Therefore, we chose the simple
home that he retired in

9
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:57,666
to be his memorial hall.

10
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,208
[HERMES] He basically founded
this country, right?

11
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,625
[FEMALE GUIDE]
Absolutely!

12
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:04,500
He was originally a
traveler like me, right?

13
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,416
But he just happened
across this place?

14
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,791
That he did.

15
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,375
Though it wasn't happenstance
so much as destiny!

16
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,000
[GUARDS]
Hmm.

17
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,958
[FEMALE GUIDE] He was drawn
to the beauty of our country

18
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,458
and decided to take up
residence here.

19
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,000
He brought with
him an abundance

20
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:21,166
of knowledge and experience,
and used it to help the people.

21
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,083
Then, he led us to overthrow
our old, corrupt government.

22
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,375
becoming our
first true president,

23
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:29,291
and leading this country
down the path to liberty!

24
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:30,541
[HERMES]
I see.

25
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,083
So what kind of things
are memorialized here?

26
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,125
Huh? A fine question.

27
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,750
Let's go inside now
so you can see for yourself.

28
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,125
Please, take your time,

29
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,958
look around as much
as you'd like.

30
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,541
[HERMES]
It's just a house.

31
00:02:58,625 --> 00:02:59,750
[KINO]
Hush.

32
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,083
Huh.

33
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,208
Is there something
in that room as well?

34
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,583
Why, yes!

35
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,750
That's where we display all
of the equipment he used

36
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,791
when he was still a traveler.

37
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,500
[HERMES]
Sounds interesting.

38
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:17,958
[FEMALE GUIDE]
What to show you...

39
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,000
[FEMALE GUIDE]
Oh, look at this!

40
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:24,083
It's the trowel he
used for gardening!

41
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,666
Wherever the first
president went,

42
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,958
he would keep
this with him,

43
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,958
hanging from the side
of his travel bag.

44
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,333
Now why do you think that is?

45
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,541
Uh, hard to say.

46
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,125
I'll tell you why!

47
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:37,208
It's because he had a deep and
enduring love for all flowers!

48
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,916
With that little trowel,
he would plant seeds

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,583
and leave flowers wherever
his adventures took him!

50
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,208
And that is a verified fact!

51
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,208
[HERMES] That's for using
the bathroom, right?

52
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,875
To dig holes when you
have to take a dump.

53
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,666
You really didn't
need to say it.

54
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,375
[FEMALE GUIDE] Isn't this
rare, engraved knife beautiful?

55
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,916
[HERMES]
Kino.

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,041
Didn't we go to a country that
was selling that kinda knife

57
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,000
as a cheap souvenir?

58
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,291
They called it
the "lucky knife"?

59
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,541
Uh-huh.

60
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,916
[HERMES] Someone actually
used one of those?

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,125
Who knows,
maybe it really was lucky.

62
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,458
Huh? What was that?

63
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:14,416
Oh, it's nothing. This
tour is very interesting.

64
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,333
I know, isn't it?

65
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:19,791
Each of these items gives us
a tiny peek at his greatness,

66
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,625
benevolence,
and abundant wisdom!

67
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,875
You should enjoy seeing this.

68
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:29,625
It's the first president's
favorite helmet!

69
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,875
[HERMES]
His helmet?

70
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,416
He wore that when
he was riding his vehicle?

71
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,583
He certainly did.

72
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,125
[KINO]
Hmm.

73
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,250
[HERMES]
Then...

74
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,750
His vehicle?
We have it right here.

75
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,875
It's displayed in
a room of its own.

76
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,750
[FEMALE GUIDE]
What do you think?

77
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:59,750
He travelled all across the
world, on this very motorrad.

78
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,541
His life back then must've
been a lot like yours.

79
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,125
[KINO]
Oh, yeah?

80
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,541
To be honest, I've never
seen one of these.

81
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,375
Well, aside from Hermes, I mean.

82
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:09,791
[FEMALE GUIDE]
Imagine that!

83
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,125
He continued using it
to get around every day,

84
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,625
even after he'd settled
in our country.

85
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,125
After he passed away,

86
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,166
the council voted
unanimously to preserve

87
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,166
this precious vehicle forever.

88
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,833
It's maintained by
our best mechanic.

89
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,333
From now until the end of days,

90
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:28,375
it'll stay right here,
in perfect driving condition.

91
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,208
We shall forever
maintain this symbol

92
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,791
of our country's founder,
as a testament of

93
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,041
our gratitude for all
that he did for us.

94
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,666
Does this motorrad
speak to people?

95
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,541
Like how Hermes does?

96
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,708
Indeed.

97
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,041
I'm told that it would
speak frequently.

98
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,083
But that was a long time ago.

99
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:50,000
It must've been saddened
by its partner's passing

100
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,333
because it hasn't spoken
to anyone since.

101
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,000
[KINO]
Is that so?

102
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,125
[HERMES]
Hey. Uh, guide lady?

103
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,375
Would you mind
stepping out for a sec?

104
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,458
Maybe he'll say something to me.

105
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:07,375
My, that would be
exciting indeed if it did!

106
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:10,375
If it does say anything to you,
please let me know.

107
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,625
Could be napping.

108
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,208
You sleep all the time and
you're still fairly young.

109
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,250
[MOTORRAD]
Hey, twerp.

110
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,541
[gasps]

111
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:34,750
[HERMES]
Hey, old man.

112
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,333
[MOTORRAD]
Must be nice.

113
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:40,083
Getting to run free every day.

114
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,625
[HERMES]
It is nice.

115
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,666
We don't travel every day,
but just about.

116
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,208
[MOTORRAD]
This place is Hell.

117
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,708
[HERMES]
I bet.

118
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:53,250
[MOTORRAD] Motorrads
were born to be ridden.

119
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:59,500
We exist to be ridden.
Not to be kept on display.

120
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,125
[HERMES]
That is Hell.

121
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,958
[MOTORRAD]
Hey, human.

122
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:09,375
Get me out of this place.
Ride me. Lemme feel the wind.

123
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,625
Sorry, I can't do that.

124
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,208
[MOTORRAD]
Fine.

125
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:17,375
Then at least smash me
to pieces so this life can end.

126
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,875
Can't do that either.

127
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,375
The people of this country
wouldn't understand.

128
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:25,291
In fact... I bet I'd end up
getting smashed to pieces next.

129
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,208
[HERMES]
It'd be a problem for me, too.

130
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,041
Kino's planning
to leave tomorrow,

131
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,291
and I'd like it to be on me.

132
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,458
[MOTORRAD]
I see. Well.

133
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:40,375
Then there's
nothing more to say.

134
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,000
Is there?

135
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:52,875
Hold on!

136
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,583
Be safe! And good
luck on your travels!

137
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,125
I appreciate it.

138
00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:00,583
[gasps]
Mm. Hey, uh...

139
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,041
Would you mind telling
me how you first got

140
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:05,333
started out as a traveler?

141
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:08,583
My reason for starting
out was rather violent,

142
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,166
but when I think back on it,

143
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,208
what really made it
happen was that I wanted it

144
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:17,000
to happen, even though
nobody else did. So.

145
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,291
'Kay, then, what
would I need to do

146
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,458
to become a traveler
just like you?

147
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,833
Can I start out the
same way that you did?

148
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,333
Mom and Dad
say it's a dumb dream,

149
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,750
that I should be happy
inheriting the inn.

150
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,583
But I don't wanna
be an innkeeper.

151
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,541
I wanna leave this place
and see the world like you!

152
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,958
I wanna be a traveler.

153
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,416
[KINO]
I can't really help.

154
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,958
[BOY groans]

155
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,375
[KINO]
That said...

156
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,458
There is more than
one way to become one.

157
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:44,625
[BOY]
Ah?

158
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,291
You know the first
president's motorrad,

159
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,583
in the memorial hall?

Hey, traveler.

Did she say anything about me?

Oh, I see.

We were happy together,

she left me here,

[HERMES]
And here.

224
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,750
I've been a friend
of that poor man

225
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,250
for more than ten years
at this point.

226
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,125
These days, I work
for the government.

227
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:13,000
But once, that government
was led by a brutal tyrant.

228
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,875
We were policemen
before the revolution began.

229
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,916
But quite early on, he became
one of the revolution's leaders.

230
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,166
Five years ago,
the people made our move.

231
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,958
He led the squad tasked with
eliminating the royal family,

232
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,875
and I joined under him.

233
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,041
He had a sweetheart back then.

234
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:35,333
A farmer's daughter, who would
visit the city every few weeks

235
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,375
or so to sell vegetables.

236
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,916
They started
seeing each other the year

237
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,833
before the revolution, back when
it was still being planned.

238
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,666
They got along quite well.

239
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,583
I was certain they'd end up
getting married someday.

240
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:57,000
But no. You see,
the revolution was nigh.

241
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,833
As soon as he learned
the date on which

242
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,916
the operation was
scheduled to take place,

243
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,541
he went to his beloved.

244
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:03,916
The mission had to stay secret,

245
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,958
but he didn't know
if he'd survive.

246
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,041
And so, to be fair to her,

247
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,458
he sent her away.

the revolution succeeded.

250
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:20,208
Yes, it did indeed.

251
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:23,041
We stormed the palace in force.

252
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:27,083
The king was trying to escape
by car, with his family.

253
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,291
But our leader
hurled a grenade at them,

254
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,708
destroying the whole car.

255
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:36,250
[MAN B]
He was truly a brave man.

256
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:40,333
In that moment,
the revolution was won.

257
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,250
But then we all saw it.

258
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,083
Inside of the car...

259
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,583
Even dressed in
her royal garments,

260
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,083
it was clearly his beloved.

261
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,416
[HERMES]
What?

262
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,166
She was the
princess in disguise.

263
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,750
Both of them had
secrets, it seems.

264
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,333
So his love...

265
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:02,291
There's no chance of her coming
back to him, because she's dead.

266
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,833
Afterwards,

267
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:07,125
realizing not just that he'd
fallen in love with a princess,

268
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,791
who represented everything
he stood against,

269
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:13,041
but also, that she'd
died by his hand.

270
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,875
It was too much.

271
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,916
He lost his mind.

272
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,875
He should've become a key figure
in the new government.

273
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,166
One of our heroes.

274
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,291
But he began to ask people,
"Where did she go?"

275
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,500
Try as we might,

276
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,166
none of us could get
him to face reality,

277
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,125
Eventually, a doctor
told him that she'd gone

278
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,041
on a journey, but would return.

279
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,625
He lied.

280
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:37,791
In this country,

281
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,625
citizens aren't
allowed outside the walls.

282
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:43,958
But in his madness,
he forgot that well-known rule.

283
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:47,375
And moved out into the woods,
so he could wait for her.

284
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:53,958
For five years, that is
the way he's lived his life.

285
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,583
The new government built
a home for him out there

286
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,875
and hired someone
to take care of him,

287
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,166
but it proved difficult
to find a caretaker

288
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,000
who could last at the job.

289
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,083
Most just couldn't
keep up the lie.

290
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,166
And the current one?

291
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,416
She actually was a traveler.

292
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,375
We found her on
the verge of collapse,

293
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:17,000
around three years ago.

294
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,708
As an outsider, who wouldn't
know what had happened,

295
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,541
we thought she'd
be a perfect fit

296
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,041
And was she?

297
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:26,750
Yes, I'd say that she's done
her job exceptionally well.

298
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:30,041
Although, he has yet to show
any signs of improvement.

299
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,583
His delusion endures.

300
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:34,916
But, to be frank,

301
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,458
he may well be better
off this way.

302
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,833
We owe everything to that hero.

303
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,750
That's why we lie to him,
and it's why

304
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,750
we'll continue lying to him.

305
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,458
He'll wait for that
girl until the day he dies,

306
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,250
and she'll never come back.

319
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,166
Oh, I see.

320
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,708
All right, well,
we'll be on our way now.

321
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,125
[HERMES]
Later.

322
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,625
Hold on.

323
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,500
May I offer you some tea
perhaps, as a thank you?

324
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,375
Has an interesting aroma.

325
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,125
What kind of tea is it?

326
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:21,958
Honestly, I have no idea,
but I do enjoy it.

327
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,125
And it's delicious.

328
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,291
You're right about that.

329
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,333
[MAN]
So. Listen, traveler.

330
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,958
You're gonna end up in
all kinds of places, right?

331
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,041
If you do happen
to meet my love--

332
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,625
Yeah.

333
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,250
I'll be sure to tell her that
you're still here, and to hurry.

334
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,375
Please, and also, thanks.

335
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,791
Say, um...

336
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,708
I could've sworn I heard an
engine running just now.

337
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,208
Makes me wonder if there
isn't someone at the gate.

338
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,250
[MAN gasps]
Really? It might be her.

339
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,416
I have to go check!

340
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,375
[WOMAN]
Wait, put on your jacket first.

341
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:55,708
[MAN]
I'll be fine!

342
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,666
[HERMES]
Are you sure about that?

343
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,750
I didn't hear anything like
an engine out here.

344
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,250
Yes. I need him occupied.

345
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:10,958
Can't really talk to you two
with him right there, now can I?

346
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:14,541
He'll be out for a while,
so we can take our time.

347
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:15,875
Everything worked out.

348
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,291
All my siblings escaped.

349
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,500
They live in a neighboring
country now.

350
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:24,666
I know that they're safe
and comfortable there.

351
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,458
And I'm right
where I want to be.

352
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:30,125
Living beside the man I love.
Albeit, not as myself.

353
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,541
Seriously?

354
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,583
You're saying that
you're the princess?

355
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,291
[WOMAN]
Mm-hmm.

356
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,875
[HERMES]
Oh, I get it.

357
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,416
That's nice. Go on, please.

358
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,083
As you've gathered,

359
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,625
I was born a princess
of this country.

360
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,958
One day, our spies reported
news of a coming revolution.

361
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,875
Which is why
I, myself, became a spy.

362
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,333
I fostered a false
relationship with that man,

363
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,083
passing information
to my father

364
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,333
so we could escape
with our assets.

365
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,458
[HERMES]
Uh-huh.

366
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,958
But at some point,

367
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,458
while I was posing as a farmer's
daughter to fool this man

368
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,166
into loving me,

369
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,625
I ended up falling
in love with him, too.

370
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,416
Eventually, it came
to an end though.

371
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,583
And as I'd planned, he brought
me the information I needed.

372
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,541
Was it when he decided
to break things off with you?

373
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,958
That's how you knew the
attack would come soon?

374
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,250
Yes.

375
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,791
Our doubles fulfilled
their duty that day.

376
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,375
Everything else went
according to plan, too.

377
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:34,208
And I resolved to forget,
to pretend I'd never met him.

378
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:37,791
How did you end up
coming back here?

379
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,333
[WOMAN] I would sometimes
speak with the spies

380
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,291
of that neighboring country.

381
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:45,125
I learned from them that my love
had killed "me," and fallen ill.

382
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,041
[WOMAN]
And then...

383
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,708
I learned that they were looking
for someone to take care of him.

384
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,708
I debated what
to do for some time.

385
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,916
And this is what I came to.

386
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
[HERMES]
You don't say.

387
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,958
It took some
hard work to do this.

388
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,958
First, I had to
persuade my parents.

389
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,916
And next, I became a traveler.

390
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,333
And once I made it back here,

391
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:11,000
I had to arrange things so I'd
be hired as his housekeeper.

392
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,291
When you were first reunited,
what did he say to you?

393
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,416
What you'd expect, I guess.

394
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:21,041
He... said that he'd be glad to
have me, until she returns.

395
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,875
I was quite elated.

396
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,083
[HERMES]
Really?

397
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,500
Of course.

398
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:28,041
It's a romantic thing to hear
from the man you love.

399
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:31,458
He's still waiting.
And after such a long time.

400
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:34,833
He may not know,
but I'm with him.

401
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,166
I'm good at lying to that man.

402
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,041
I've done it since the
very first day we met.

403
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:43,083
And I'll probably live out
my life with him right here.

404
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,291
Still lying.

405
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,125
And still very much in love.

406
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,416
[WOMAN]
It's okay. I'm happy.

407
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,583
Thank you. I enjoyed your story.

408
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,875
[HERMES]
Yeah, me, too.

409
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:01,291
[MAN sighs]
There was no car.

410
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,708
Guess it was just the generator
they run for heat at the gate.

411
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,958
Because nobody
came through today.

412
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,125
I'm sorry, dear.

413
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,500
When will she come back?

414
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,541
She promised that she would,
but she never said

415
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,791
when that would be.

416
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,166
I couldn't tell you when,

417
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,291
but... I'm sure she'll
come home someday.

418
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,333
You say that,
but what if...

419
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,125
What if she's never coming back?

420
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,791
What if she's forgotten
that she ever met me?

421
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,416
There's not a chance.

422
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,000
I know she couldn't forget
loving you even if she tried to.

423
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,541
Not ever.

424
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,625
They're heading out.

425
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,541
Do you think they'll
pass on my message to her?

426
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,250
I'm sure it'll be fine.

427
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,041
Hold on, I hear an engine.

428
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,666
Someone must be coming!

429
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,708
Wait, it's probably just Hermes!

430
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:05,041
[WOMAN] Now...
What should I make for lunch?

431
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:12,833
[HERMES]
Kino, hold up.

432
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,250
Behind us.

433
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,208
--[MAN] Let go of me!
--[MALE SOLDIER C] Please, stop!

434
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,375
[grunting]

435
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:21,041
[MAN]
Traveler! Wait, please!

436
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,291
[MAN] There's something
I'd like to tell you.

437
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,708
A message to pass
to your sweetheart?

438
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:30,083
[MAN]
No.

439
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,000
I guess it just didn't feel
right to letcha leave

440
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,958
with only two-thirds
of the story.

441
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:38,833
I want it this way.

442
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:41,375
I'm happy with
things as they are,

443
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:44,333
and I don't wanna spoil
what anybody else has.

444
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:47,375
Not my friend's life as
a spy for the old king.

445
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:50,333
Not the kind feelings
of those who know nothing.

446
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:53,375
Not the new system we created
through the revolution.

447
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:56,333
And lastly, definitely not
the life I share

448
00:22:56,416 --> 00:23:00,125
with the woman who wasn't
just using me after all.

449
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:02,916
This is my way
of protecting that.

450
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,958
This is the life I've chosen.

451
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:09,416
I see.

452
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,791
[HERMES]
You're a liar.

453
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:14,416
Everyone in
this country's a liar.

454
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,250
[MAN]
Hmph. Well, I'm heading back.

455
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,166
I guess this is goodbye.

456
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,208
Yeah, I guess so.

457
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,500
Best wishes to both of you.

458
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,041
[HERMES]
Take care, hero!

459
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:27,958
Give our regards to
your housekeeper.

460
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:32,250
[KINO]
You ready?

461
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:33,916
[HERMES]
Born ready.

462
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:46,916
[KINO]
"In the Clouds."
