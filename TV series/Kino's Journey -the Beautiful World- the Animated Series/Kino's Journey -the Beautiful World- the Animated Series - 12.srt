00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:46,416
[KINO sighs]
The sun's so warm on my back.

2
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,541
It's starting to make me
feel a little sleepy.

3
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:50,625
[HERMES]
Don't give in to it.

4
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:52,000
We'll fall.

5
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:54,458
And I wouldn't
want that to happen.

6
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:58,250
It takes way too much effort
to stand you back up after.

7
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:01,041
[HERMES] So that's why it
always takes you so long.

8
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,958
Here I thought you just
enjoyed watching me suffer.

9
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,791
Hey, it isn't my fault
you weigh so much.

10
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,916
Maybe you should
try going on a diet.

11
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,708
[KINO]
What're those?

12
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:14,375
[HERMES]
Hmm. Oh, it's a flock of sheep.

13
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:15,916
You think so?

14
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,291
[KINO]
Yeah, you're right.

15
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,750
[HERMES]
I think they're wild.

16
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,833
[KINO] And it looks
like they're resting.

17
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:26,708
Not a bad way to live.
Let's try not to bother 'em.

18
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,666
[bleats]

19
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,750
[SHEEP bleating]

20
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,958
[HERMES]
So much for not bothering them.

21
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,416
Yeah.

22
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,875
[HERMES]
Sheesh, talk about cranky!

23
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,375
Are they tryin'
to eat you or what?!

24
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,250
Well, I doubt
they wanna eat you.

25
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,416
[HERMES]
I'm almost offended by that.

26
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,791
C'mon, Kino.
Gun it! Let's move!

27
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,125
Think we're far enough ahead?

28
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,583
[HERMES]
Uh. Kino...?

29
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:57,583
I've got bad news.

30
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:58,583
Huh?

31
00:02:58,666 --> 00:02:59,875
[SHEEP bleating]

32
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,375
[gasps]

33
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,083
Gonna have to take
you off-road, okay?

34
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,708
[HERMES]
Keep an eye out for rocks.

35
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,250
[KINO]
What's going on here?

36
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,166
I've had more than my fair
share of scary encounters

37
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,666
with wild animals, but...
Why are these sheep so evil?

38
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,708
[HERMES] You've hunted sheep
for your dinner before,

39
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,375
so technically,
this is just payback.

40
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:38,750
D'ya think they'll let us go
if I say I'm really sorry?

41
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,625
[HERMES]
I'm goin' with a "no."

42
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:44,083
We'll just have to keep goin'
til they wear themselves out.

43
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,833
Persistent, aren't they?

44
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,000
[HERMES]
So shoot 'em.

45
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,125
We can have ram steak tonight.

46
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,166
I don't have nearly
enough bullets.

47
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,333
And besides that, I'd rather
not kill unnecessarily.

48
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,791
Let's just run.

49
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,125
[HERMES]
Wait, no. Hit the brakes!

50
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,958
[HERMES]
Whew! That was a close one.

51
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,250
[KINO]
What the...?

52
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,666
[HERMES]
It's called a ravine.

53
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,916
They're like canyons
but narrower.

54
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,875
We'd be in real trouble
if we'd fallen down there.

55
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,125
Nice save. Thank you.

56
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,875
[HERMES]
Sure, glad I could help.

57
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,166
But I think we're
in trouble anyway.

58
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,500
[KINO]
Hmm?

59
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,625
--[SHEEP bleating]
--[KINO] I almost forgot.

60
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,583
[HERMES] No point in
trying to put up a fight.

61
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,416
You should just
escape on your own.

62
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,916
Where to?

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,166
[HERMES] Down the ravine.
You should be able to climb it.

64
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,583
But it's definitely too
steep for the sheep.

65
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,125
[KINO groans]

66
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,000
[KINO]
And what about you?

67
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,083
I mean, I could
slide you down, but--

68
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,541
[HERMES]
I'm pretty sure I would break.

69
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:51,083
Just lay me down right here.
They won't hurt me.

70
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,541
[KINO] Hmm... What if
we tried to jump it?

71
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,875
There's still time to go back
and build up some speed.

72
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,250
[HERMES]
There's no way!

73
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,666
I mean if we had a stunt ramp,
maybe, but we don't.

74
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,500
[gasps]

75
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,000
[HERMES]
Hurry up! Start climbing.

76
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,791
And take your bag with you.

77
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,333
[KINO sighs]

78
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,166
[KINO] I promise
I'll come back for you.

79
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,083
[SHEEP bleating]

80
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,458
[KINO grunts]

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,458
[KINO growls]

82
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,500
Damn you!

83
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,333
[HERMES]
Don't do it!

84
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,708
These guys
aren't bothering me,

85
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,875
so I guess they target humans.

86
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,083
I think your best bet
it to leave the area

87
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,375
so they lose interest.

88
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,208
Try and climb up
on the other side.

89
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,875
Doesn't look
like that's an option.

90
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,125
[HERMES]
All right.

91
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,916
Then you'll have to walk
upstream till you can

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,083
find another way outta there.

93
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,875
Yeah, I'll give that a try.

94
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,166
I'll come back for you
as soon as I'm able.

95
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,458
Hang tight till then.

96
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,041
[HERMES]
Sounds good.

97
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,916
I mean, hey, it's not like I'm
not gonna starve or anything.

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,750
So, take your time.

99
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,625
Who knows? Maybe I can talk
some sense into these guys

100
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,791
while I'm waiting for you.

101
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,541
Didn't know you spoke sheep.

102
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,875
Somethin' all motorrads
can do, or just you?

00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,000
[HERMES]
I don't yet. They'll teach me.

104
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,750
Right. See ya soon.

105
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,916
[KINO] I only have a
few days' worth of food.

for trouble with you guys.

And annoying, too.
What's your deal?

111
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,708
Don't you have
a home to go back to?

he couldn't escape.

117
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,166
[KINO]
It's just one man.

118
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,000
He wasn't able to
see the ravine in time.

119
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,375
Drove his car right into it.

120
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,375
After crashing,
he prob'ly climbed out

121
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,833
of it to try and escape.
But the sheep were closing in.

122
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,958
[KINO]
He had a broken shin.

123
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:45,291
He must've realized he had
no chance of outrunning them.

124
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,500
[KINO]
Oh.

125
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,333

I'm glad you taught me
how to use these, Master.

I found it by the ravine.

[HERMES]
All right, well, good work!

Why don't you drive that
thing to the next country

00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,541
and call for backup?

[KINO]
Think about it.

148
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,250
There's no guarantee
they'd be willing to come

149

this far out just to help us.

150
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,083
[HERMES] That's true,
but what chance do we have

Hey, Hermes. You're not
leaking fuel, are you?

damage you at all?

[HERMES]
Nope, we just cuddled.

All right...

00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,500
You sure know how
to put on a show.

Hermes!

[HERMES]
Welcome back.

170
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,666
[KINO]
Good to be back.

171
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,166
[HERMES]
Pretty clever plan.

172
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,958
So... What now?

Huh...?

00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:18,333

Huh?

Kino, you're... not serious?

00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,041
Are you?

183
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,583
You're the one who said
we could jump it with a ramp.

184
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:32,958
[HERMES]
I said maybe.

185
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,083
And I was obviously joking!

186
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,458
[KINO]
Too late to turn back now.

187
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,583
Ready?

188
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,250
[HERMES]
Kino, this is cruel!

189
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,916
You know, if I didn't need you
to get outta this predicament,

190
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,166
I would hand you division notes.

191
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,416
[KINO]
Divorce papers?

192

Yeah, those!

--Okay, fine. Let's go.
--[KINO] Roger.

194
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:57,125
[HERMES] Accelerate gently, lean
forward, and keep me straight!

195
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,833
That's a lot to ask.

196
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,541
[HERMES]
That is a crazy brave sheep.

197
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,208
Y'know if you're gonna eat one,
it should be one like that.

198
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,833
You'll absorb its strength.

[BRAVE SHEEP bleating]

Hermes. Let's go!

Jeez. Screw it! I don't care!

00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,625
Here we go!

Oh, no, no, no, no-no--

00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,125
Oh, yeah!

[HERMES, KINO scream]

00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,000
[HERMES]
Kino... You alive?

211
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,833
I'm fine, not even injured.

212
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,583
Didn't mean to fall, though.

213
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,208
Sorry.

214
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,791
I did everything you said
except keeping you straight.

215
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,958
[HERMES]
Hey. All's well that te--

216
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,375
Ends well.

217
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,916
--Heh. I'm glad ya screwed up.
--And why's that?

218
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,291
[HERMES]
Because thanks to that fall,

219
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,458
I took the brunt of
the impact on my side.

220
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,958
If not for that, I think
I'd've taken some damage.

221
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,625
A blown-out tire at least.

222
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:33,041
There's a chance that
my frame would've busted.

223
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,500
[HERMES]
Hey. Come back!

224
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,458
Stand me up!

225
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,083
[KINO]
Why'd you fight so hard?

226
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,583
Normal predators
would've given up.

227
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,833
Do you hate humans that much?

228
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:56,958
[KINO]
We made it.

229
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,375
[HERMES]
Somehow.

230
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,708
[INSPECTOR A] Whoa, I haven't
seen a traveler in ages.

231
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,208
Like, literally.

232
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,708
No one's entered the country
through this gate in years.

233
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,541
My job was gettin' kinda lonely.

234
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,041
[KINO]
You don't say.

235
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,500
[HERMES] What do you think
this country'll be like?

236
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,041
[KINO] As long as they
have beds, I don't care.

237
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:19,166
[HERMES]
Yeah. You do look tired.

238
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,291
[KINO]
The second I get in there,

239
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:26,083
I'm jumping into the first bed
I see, and passing out.

240
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,291
[INSPECTOR A]
Oh, yeah. Traveler.

241
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,041
Since you came through
the eastern plains, tell me.

242
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,500
Did you run into any sheep?

243
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:36,000
[KINO]
I sure did. Quite a few of them.

244
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,416
[INSPECTOR A]
Truly? That's wonderful news!

245
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,000
See, they were originally
bred in our country.

246
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,708
We'd have them fight
for entertainment.

247
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,458
You bred those
sheep for pit fights?

248
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,666
Yeah, same as
you'd do with dogs.

249
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,541
We would pit a pair of sheep
against each other in the ring.

250
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:55,041
Then, as they fought by butting
heads, we'd watch and take bets.

251
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,208
It used to be a very
popular past time

252
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,125
for the citizens
of this country.

253
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,291
We used selective
breeding to create strong,

254
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:05,000
courageous sheep with extremely
aggressive dispositions.

255
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,791
From what I've heard, they
were borderline bloodthirsty!

256
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,583
[INSPECTOR A]
But...

257
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,083
But what?

258
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:15,125
Proponents of animal rights
put a stop to all that.

259
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,333
So we took those sheep out
to the eastern plains

260
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,083
and released them.

261
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,791
I'm excited to hear
they're doing so well.

262
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,083
Once I'm off work, I'll have
to let the other citizens

263
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,541
know the good news.

264
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,208
If you two would
please follow me.

265
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,541
I'll show you inside.

266
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,541
[KINO sighs]

267
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,250
[HERMES]
What'll you do?

268
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,125
Tell them?

269
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:48,958
[KINO] I know
that nothing's certain,

270
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:52,250
but I'm pretty sure
this is the nicest spot

271
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,125
for a hammock in the world.

272
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:59,083
Wow. This is perfect.

273
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,083
[HERMES]
You know, I'm a motorrad.

274
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,958
Not a tea table.

275
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,541
By the way, you're gonna
regret not taking advantage

276
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:09,416
of this perfect riding weather.
You're being wasteful.

277
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,125
[KINO]
I disagree.

278
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,583
There's only one way to
truly take advantage of

279
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:17,333
weather like this.
And that's with a nap.

280
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:21,500
[HERMES sighs] I hope you melt
right into that hammock.

281
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:25,791
[KINO giggles]
That doesn't sound so bad.

282
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,208
My journey's at an end now.

283
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:32,250
I'm goin' to sleep.
Right here.

284
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,166
[HERMES]
Yup! Roger that!

285
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,708
Kino's journey ends right here!

286
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,833
Wait, if your journey's over,
then what'll I do?

287
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,458
[KINO]
Whatever you want.

288
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,958
I, for one,
will be taking a nap.

289
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,166
[HERMES]
'Kay.

290
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,666
And what about once you wake up?

291
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,000
[KINO]
When I wake?

292
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,791
I'll start my journey.

293
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,541
[HERMES]
"Start" it? You lost me.

294
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,208
[KINO]
It's how you think of it.

295
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,750
Know what I mean?

296
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:00,041
If I decide this is the end of
my journey, that'll be that.

297
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:03,666
The journey ends with
me taking a nice nap.

298
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,041
And once I wake up
from that nap,

299
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,291
if I should happen to decide
to set out on a journey...

300
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,500
Well, that will be the start
of a brand-new journey.

301
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,541
[HERMES]
I still don't get it.

302
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,125
[KINO]
It's like this.

303
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,291
You can change your situation.

304
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,208
just by changing the way
you think about it.

305
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,791
[HERMES]
So?

306
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,916
[KINO]
So, that's it.

307
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
[HERMES]
What?

308
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,166
[KINO]
Forget it.

309
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,375
Thinking about
complex stuff like that

310
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,416
makes me feel exhausted.

311
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,083
[HERMES] Okay,
all I'm hearing is that you

312
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,208
really wanna take this nap.

313
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:40,125
[KINO] Mm-hm.
And so, my journey ends.

314
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,750
If this were
a serial radio drama,

315
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,958
then this would be
the last episode.

316
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,958
The grand finale.

317
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,625
[HERMES]
Gotcha.

318
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,000
[KINO] We'll start the
sequel when I wake up.

319
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,166
So hang tight until then.

320
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,333
[HERMES]
No problem.

321
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,500
Can do. In fact,
it's all I can do.

322
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,166
Can't move on my own, after all.

323
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,750
[KINO chuckles]
Don't worry.

324
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,916
I can't move
without you, either.

325
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,833
Not with all the luggage
I've got you carrying.

326
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,708
[HERMES]
Well, be sure you wake up.

327
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,083
Wake up, and start
your new journey.

328
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,208
Or else.

329
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,333
[KINO]
Sure thing.

330
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,791
Well. Goodnight, Hermes.

331
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,791
[HERMES]
Sleep tight, Kino.

332
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:31,416
[HERMES] You know,
the journey we just finished?

333
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,291
It was lots of fun.

334
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:07,875
[KINO groans softly]

335
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:09,458
[HERMES]
Kino. You awake?

336
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:12,291
[KINO grunts]
Yeah. I'm up.

337
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,500
[KINO grunts]

338
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,833
[KINO]
Ah! There.

339
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:26,750
Now then.

340
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:29,666
Let's get this journey started.
